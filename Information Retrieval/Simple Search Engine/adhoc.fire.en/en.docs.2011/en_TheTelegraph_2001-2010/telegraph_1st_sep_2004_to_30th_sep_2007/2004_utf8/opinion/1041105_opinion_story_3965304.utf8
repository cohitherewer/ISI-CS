 SLIPPED PAST

 What distinguishes Indian legislative assemblies is the oscillation of mood. People either sleep or fight. In the interim, they either drone or scream. The ritual melodrama inside assemblies gives them a surreal ambience, the full potential of which is reached only occasionally. One historic occasion was a day in the Uttar Pradesh assembly in 1997, when the air above the speaker?s head buzzed with missiles, in the shape of microphones, slippers and nameplates. That prompted a renewed series of instructions about model conduct for legislators, suggestions about training and about raising the education level of new entrants into the hallowed rank. 

 Like much in India, all this merely reinforced the illusion that bad behaviour by those in power can be corrected. Legislators in Orissa have just reminded the nation of that. Mr Anup Sai of the Congress threw his slipper neatly across the room after the information and public relations minister instructed the television cameras to be turned off when everyone was getting hot under the collar. The Biju Janata Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party government has evidently leased out a forest area in Kalahandi for an alumina refining plant without proper environmental clearance. There was nothing democratic on either side in what followed the steel and mines minister?s reply to the opposition. What was most embarrassing was the chief minister?s injury ? his foot was trapped by a desk overturned by rampaging legislators. The surreal aura of a typical Indian assembly is further enhanced by the fact that the legislators had been scheduled for Art of Living lessons immediately after. It is unlikely that the legislators would need lessons for living it up from professional wise men. They do it quite well untaught.

 DIARY

 Not a typical day in the Lok Sabha, if one were to go by the number of empty chairs or the energy of the legislators. The opposition was trying to take Natwar Singh apart for his alleged indiscretions about NDA?s foreign policy in his comments to a South Korean daily, while Congressmen tried hard to make up their mind over how much enthusiasm they should show in defence of their ever-scowling foreign minister. Matters came to a head when the treasury benches referred to the hijacking of the IA flight to Kandahar, just to prove what a mess Jaswant Singh had made of the foreign ministry. As Congress MP, Pawan Bansal, tried hammering in the point for the nth time, the BJP MP from Bhilwara, VP Badnore, threw the Congress a googly ? what would their government do if terrorists decided to hijack a plane with Sonia Gandhi on board? Commotion reigned as Bansal tried to figure out which could be more dangerous to him ? his answer that the government would remain firm could mean his showing scant regard for madam, while his plea that the UPA would try to negotiate would invalidate his own criticism of Jaswant. Madam meanwhile sat silent, probably thinking about how much she could trust her foreign minister to do the bargaining. 

 Besides the problem of Ram Vilas Paswan, there came the train accident and then the row with the EC in quick succession. The turn of events has left Laloo Yadav in a daze, if only a bit. Quite naturally, he is out finding the root of his troubles. And he seems to have got it ? Lord Viswakarma, who is his favourite god. According to the railway minister, the lord is upset with him for having failed to pay his respects every morning to a deity placed inside the rail mantri?s chamber. Laloo has reportedly pulled up his personal staff for the lapse. They have been asked to regularly light diyas and agarbattis to make up for the sin. 

 Back in business. We are talking of Makhan Lal Fotedar, the long-time retainer of the Nehru-Gandhi family, who had been sulking ever since Sonia Gandhi denied him nomination to the Rajya Sabha earlier this year. He had also been served an eviction notice by the Ghulam Nabi Azad manned urban welfare ministry. Fotedar has now been nominated to the three-member panel set up by madam herself to negotiate the seat-sharing formula with the indomitable Laloo for the forthcoming assembly polls in Bihar. Sure this is not another punishment?

 Whoever said the resident of 10 Janpath is more accessible now should check his notes again. The entry rules have become more rigid. There?s a theory behind this ? madam cannot keep the word of all those who come to seek her favour, nor can she be seen to disappoint any for that could mean declining popularity. So visitors are kept to the minimum. Fair enough. But the theory could perhaps be communicated to old generation Congresswallahs like Rafiq Zakaria, noted scholar and much-sought-after during the Maharashtra elections, who was turned away by the gate-keepers several times? At least that could stop the theory from falling on its face!

 Somnath Chatterjee?s resignation, if it were allowed to be carried through, would have had more damaging consequences than apparent. Not only would it have left the lower house without a guiding light, it would have led the upper house into similar chaos. Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, vice-president and speaker of the Rajya Sabha, seemingly expressed his desire to quit his post in parliament since he too was disgusted with parliamentarians? behaviour. The buzz in political circles is that Bhairon is preparing his grounds to become the next consensus president. But then our legislators could also push people into taking extreme decisions!

 The memory of another famous birthday earlier this year has been given a quiet burial. Politicians now plan for less risky and more expensive gifts than polyester saris to be given away to more respectable people than poor women voters. Which is probably why the 134 councillors of Delhi Nagar Nigam will reportedly get a gift of laptops on New Year?s day on the occasion of the birthday of the state Congress chief, Ram Babu Sharma. This is apparently by the order of the chairman of the standing committee of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Mukesh Goel, once a beneficiary of Sharma?s munificence. The question is will the gifts be put to use by councillors, most of whom are allegedly school drop-outs?

 Superstar Jaya Bachchan seems to be taking her real-life roles very seriously ? both that of a Rajya Sabha MP, and of the chairman of the UP Film Development Corporation. She has made a successful debut speech in parliament, and is now working keenly on her political career. This is clearly evident from her efforts to brush up on her Hindi, apparently on the request of the chief minister himself, who felt her proficiency in English wasn?t going to help her much. Apart all this, there is also her official involvement in films. The mix however has its own set of problems. The office assistant of the Samajwadi Party office in parliament, a man who has seen many governments come and go, was heard grumbling about how actresses treat politics. Pointing at a poster in the party?s office of a film workshop organized by Jaya, he said, ?Now look Jaya B?s PA has come and plastered this on this wall. Of what purpose is this in parliament and to parliamentarians?? Well, it could sharpen politicos? acting skills for one.

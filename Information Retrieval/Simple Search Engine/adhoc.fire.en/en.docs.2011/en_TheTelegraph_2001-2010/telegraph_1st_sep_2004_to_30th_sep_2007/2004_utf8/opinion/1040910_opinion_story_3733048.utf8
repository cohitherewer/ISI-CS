 ON THEIR OWN TERMS

 Another point of view

Desert in Bloom: Contemporary Indian Womens 

fiction in English Edited by Meenakshi Bharat, Pencraft, Rs 450

The paradox in the title indicates the difficulties 

women writers have had to attain a degree of success. This holds true not only 

of India but also of the whole world. Meenakshi Bharat, the editor of this book, 

quotes Anita Desai who remarked in 1983, ?It is sad, this complete desert? There 

is very little fiction written by women in India.? More than two decades later, 

things have changed considerably and for the better, and Bharat declares emphatically, 

?The burgeoning presence of ?women writers? of fiction in English is too significant 

and exciting for anyone to miss, overlook or ignore.?

 Women have always told stories but for a long time, they stuck to the oral tradition for the simple reason that, denied education, they did not have access to the written word. Even now, not many women write fiction in English. But the few who do often give voice to the feelings that their less- privileged sisters would like to articulate.

 It is to Bharat?s credit that Desert in Bloom does not present only the critic?s point of view. Of the 18 essays in the book, nine are in the first section, ?Critical Readings?, and three in the second one called ?Critical Reviews?. The rest, by creative writers, are put together in the last section called ?Speaking for themselves?. 

 In the first section, I enjoyed reading Yasmine Gooneratne?s essay on Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, which is a profile of a writer that only another creative writer can provide. Radha Chakravarty feels that Anita Desai?s novels ?problematize the relationship between language, history, culture and identity in ways that are consonant with current debates in theory?. Jasbir Jain looks at male narrators in novels by women writers, with special focus on Nayantara Sahgal (Mistaken Identity), Anita Desai (In Custody) and Githa Hariharan (The Ghosts of Vasu Master). She concludes that their strategy is ?to create alternative possibilities which are androgynous and which are an acknowledgement of the presence of the feminine within the larger social discourse?. 

 Another interesting essay is Rajeshwari Sunder Rajan?s ?The Heroine?s Progress? which looks at the politics of how women negotiate for power within the family, as well as attempt to escape it. Many of the essays turn to Shashi Deshpande?s works. Of these, ?On Her Own Terms? by Meenakshi Mukherjee focusses on the way in which Deshpande?s Small Remedies incorporates a large number of social nuances although at first reading, the novel may appear introspective. 

 Arundhati Roy and her The God of Small Things have been so much written about that one wonders if there is anything left to say on the subject. Rukmini Bhaya Nair?s essay ?Twins and Lovers? proves that there is. 

 The number of Indian women writing in English has increased considerably in the last decade or so and it is not possible to include critical essays on all the writers in a single volume. One hopes Bharat will bring out a companion to this volume, focussing perhaps on the women fiction writers of Indian origin like Bharati Mukherjee, Chitra Divakaruni Banerjee and others, and analyzing their work along with issues that concern them.

 PLAYING TO EMPTY GALLERIES

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 What about having matches featuring teams from the subcontinent outside its bounds?

 Watch the space behind

 Take a look at a few facts pertaining to the finals of the ICC Champion?s Trophy in London just over a week ago. It was a Saturday and the hosts were playing. What?s more, they were the favourites to win the finals, a status that hasn?t come England?s way for quite some time. (It is a different matter that they lost to the Caribbeans.)

 Now take your mind back to the empty rows of seats you saw on television, wishing all the time that you were at the Oval, witnessing one of the most incredible comebacks in one-day cricket?s history.

 A colleague?s husband was in Birmingham when the matches were being played at Edgbaston. For obvious reasons, he made a dash for a ticket to the India-Pakistan semi-final match. Even more predictably, he failed to procure one. So he went and watched the other semi-final between the home team and Australia instead. 

 Thank god this was England, where there are enough expatriate Indians and Pakistanis to fill the grounds whenever either of the two teams play. (The increasing demand for Bollywood stars in London and Leicester and Manchester may also be studied in this connection.) And since both teams progressed to the semi-finals, the organizers must have managed to break even.

 Of course, cricket in England has long lost out to soccer in popularity. In fact, at a match between Oxford and Cambridge at Lord?s, I was mildly surprised to hear chants that are commonly heard at Wembley. There are some who attribute the change in allegiance to England?s declining fortunes in cricket. Why, then, have the deserters refused to come back now that the team has got back to its winning ways?

 I could attempt to answer the question, and indeed, there could be a large number of reasons. But what I really want to do is propose an idea. What about having all the matches featuring the subcontinental teams outside the subcontinent, and the rest in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh? For instance, a series between India and Sri Lanka could be held in England, while a triangular tournament involving Zimbabwe, Kenya and New Zealand could take place in India. In both cases, of course, the cricket board of the host country will pay the boards of the participating countries an agreed sum of money. 

 In the first case, the large subcontinental diaspora is going to ensure that ticket sales are decent. And past international tournaments in India have proved that even a match between Kenya and Zimbabwe draws over 10,000 spectators to the ground. 

 Could there be a better blueprint for cricket as it may be played in future? For those who dream of an egalitarian world, this would give the boards of the big and small cricket-playing countries equal opportunities to make profits. As such, it is far advanced than the WTO?s draft declarations. 

 Last of all, the rich cricketers of the subcontinent will find better shopping malls to spend their money at. And those from Australia and England excellent charities to get involved in.

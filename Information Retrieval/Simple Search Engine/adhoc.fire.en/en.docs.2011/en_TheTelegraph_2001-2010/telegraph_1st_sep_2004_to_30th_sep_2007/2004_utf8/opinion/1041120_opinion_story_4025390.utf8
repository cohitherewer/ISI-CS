 RICE

 AND

 SHINE

 Coming first is by now second nature to America?s chief diplomat. And it?s also clear that Condoleezza Rice is de facto member of the globe?s First Family

PEARLS 

OF WISDOM

On Iraq: 

...we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom 

cloud 

 On September 11: ...no silver bullet... 

could have prevented the September 11 attacks

 On Pakistan: Our new approach... combined 

the use of carrots and sticks to persuade Pakistan to drop its support for the 

Taliban.

 The segregated and isolated road from Birmingham, Alabama, to the centre of power in the White House and now to the position of America?s chief diplomat may have been a long one for Condoleezza Rice but she shows no fatigue. She has a habit of making history with every move, and appearing on the lists of ?firsts? is by now her second nature. This week she became the first black woman secretary of state and with it, ?America?s face to the world?. She is one tough face after Colin Powell ? a moderate and her mentor ? whom she replaced, closing the circle of hardliners on US policy. Her most famous phrase so far was: ?Punish France, ignore Germany and forgive Russia?, after these troublesome Europeans refused to fall in line about Iraq.

 Rice?s biggest qualification today is not her expertise in Soviet studies, her fluency in four languages or even her dogged discipline. It is her unique relationship with the world?s most powerful man ? George W. Bush ? whom she has coached, guided, tutored and defended since the early days of his candidacy in 2000. The two are said to be in a ?mind meld? where she can often finish his sentences. They have conversations based on body language and a few words. She made a faux pas when she said at a party, ?As I was telling my husb... As I was telling President Bush.? She is unflinchingly loyal to the point of sounding absurd on Sunday talk shows where she regularly appears as ?His? voice. It is unclear who changed whom more, but Rice has clearly developed a more ?moralistic? view of world affairs after years in the ?realistic? wing. The relationship is supremely symbiotic with the two reinforcing rather than balancing each other?s views. It is almost as if Bush expresses his instincts and she translates them into policy. Such influence and power was exercised last by Kissinger as Nixon?s secretary of state.

 The real story may never be known because Rice is extremely discreet about her role as a de facto member of America?s First Family. But she is often spotted with the Bushes at Camp David on weekends in her ?smart casuals?, taking long walks with her boss. They have also bonded over a love of sports, with Condi?s lifelong ambition being to become the commissioner of the National Football League. Both grew slightly teary at the White House ceremony during the announcement.

 Such is her value that the early-to-bed, no-partying Bush turned up last weekend at her surprise 50th birthday party organised by the British ambassador. Since she didn?t know and wasn?t prepared, a red Oscar de la Renta gown awaited her to slip into. Very few women can boast of such treatment from the creamiest layer of Washington?s elite male club. When the world?s minor players talk to Rice, they know she is speaking for her President. A far cry from Powell, a likeable but marginalised man.

 With Rice heading the state department, there is little likelihood of ?dissent?. The kitchen cabinet is now officially complete with US foreign policy in Rice?s hands. Whether vice-president Dick Cheney and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld ? with whom Rice has clashed in the past over the Iraq policy ? will try to marginalise her, now that she will move a few blocks away from the White House, remains a question. She was unable to control the two men as Bush?s national security adviser and official gatekeeper. She also failed miserably to weigh the bad intelligence on WMDs, al Qaida?s missing links with Iraq and the general mismanagement of the war. But White House flies on the wall insist that Rice?s deployment to the state department will tighten Bush?s control over the national security apparatus and end the public sparring among cabinet members.

 The Cheney-Rice rivalry is evident because Cheney?s people feel that Rice is not as solidly in the ?moralist? camp as they are, or a fervent believer of realigning the world. During the Cold War the ?moralists? in the Republican Party wanted to defeat Communism, while the ?realists? wanted to hold it at bay. Today, the moralists and neo-conservatives want to create democracies all over the world and change regimes, while the realists tread much more cautiously. Bush has certainly pushed Rice towards the moralist cause but whether she is a complete convert is unclear.

 Seen as a high-impact presence, Rice is brassily self-confident and optimistic. She has managed to acquire more mentors than even the best. She is gifted in the art of being a prot?g?, her list of patrons grown impressively long over the last 20 years. Chevron even named a 1,29,000-ton tanker after her after she served on the board of directors from 1991 to 2001.

 Rice was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on November 14, 1954. Her father, John Wesley Rice, was a school counsellor and a Presbyterian minister while her mother, Angelina, was a teacher. The family lived in a middle-class, black community, where education was a high priority. She was pushed to dream big and then go out and realise it. A classic overachiever, she refused to let racial barriers limit her. And she used oodles of discipline to get there. Only discipline could have ensured her training as a concert pianist, a competitive ice-skater and a Ph.D at 26. She is said to rise by 5 am, run on the treadmill in her apartment at the famous Watergate building and appear at her desk by 7 am. But she finds time for music ? she has played with Yo Yo Ma. She practises with her chamber music group and often performs for friends. Significantly, her favourite composer is Brahms. ?I love Brahms because Brahms is actually structured,? she once said.

 Her ties with the Bush family go back to Papa Bush?s tenure when she was his Soviet expert. In Clinton?s era, she was the provost of Stanford University. When Bush junior came to Washington, so did she.

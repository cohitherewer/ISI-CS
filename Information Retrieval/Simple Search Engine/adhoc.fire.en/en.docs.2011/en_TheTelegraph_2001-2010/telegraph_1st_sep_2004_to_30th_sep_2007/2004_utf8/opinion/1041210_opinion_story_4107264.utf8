 WOMEN IN LOVE

 The Chandigarh police are in a soup. And the Amritsar police have given up. Two young women from the Sandhu Colony of Amritsar, aged 25 and 22, have not only run away together, but have also let their families know that they are now married. They will come back only if an affidavit allowing them to live together as a couple is produced. The families are scandalized, and the mother of one of the girls has seen in this the dawning of kalyug. But the police have been unable to register a case so far, because there is no ?clear? law against same-sex marriages. The law lies in the lack of it. The various marriage acts are applicable only to man-woman pairings. By that argument, no same-sex marriage is legal. It is true that the law is not clear, but that is a mild construction to put on actual practice. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code expressly forbids intercourse ?against the order of nature?. This law implicitly makes homosexuality illegal in the country, because it is taken for granted that the ?order of nature? is decided by the heterosexual majority or the ?natural? segment of society. 

 Section 377 is usually thought of in association with homosexual men: anatomy may have something to do with that. It is as if same-sex love among women does not exist. Compared to the growing visibility of homosexual men all over the country and the reach of their campaign for rights across classes, homosexual women still remain largely invisible. Isolated groups of activists are now more vocal than before, especially among writers, film-makers, academics and lawyers. At the level of everyday life, however, the homosexual woman?s lot remains irredeemably tragic. Her sexual orientation is an added burden on the already overloaded bundle of pressures, social and economic, that she must bear. In a society cruelly harsh to difference, a woman who demands legitimacy for a same-sex relationship displays unimaginable courage. The alternative is the black despair manifested in the suicide of two teenage girls who walked hand-in hand into an oncoming train in Bongaon recently. Homosexuality is considered an unspeakable evil, a shameful disease. But even within this larger context, homosexual men have more options than homosexual women, more manoeuvring space and escape routes through society?s evasions. That the women are now erupting through the iron curtain of invisibility augurs ill for iron-handed sex legislators.

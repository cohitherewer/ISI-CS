 NUCLEAR IS SEXY, AGAIN

 Gwynne Dyer

 ?The worst possible nuclear disasters are not as bad as the worst possible climate change disasters,? declared the Centre for Alternative Technology in Britain recently, urging ?a modest revival of nuclear energy.? And while Europeans and North Americans are still reluctant to build new nuclear power stations, recalling the disasters at Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island around two decades ago, Asians have no doubts: China plans to build two large new nuclear reactors per year for the next 16 years.

 In the rest of the world, the number of new nuclear reactors under construction barely balances the number being retired at the end of their lives. But it?s boom time in Asia: 16 of the 27 nuclear power stations now being built worldwide are in China, India, Japan and South Korea. That is largely because Asia has had no similar reactor disaster that alienated public opinion, but there are signs that European and American governments are also starting to reconsider new nuclear power plants.

 Only a year ago, the whole nuclear power industry was facing a death sentence in the West. No new nuclear reactor had been ordered in the United States of America for 25 years, and only one was under construction in all of Europe (in Finland). Indeed, a number of European countries that currently get much of their electricity from nuclear power generation, including Germany (28 per cent), Belgium (55 per cent) and Sweden (58 per cent), had decided to phase out their existing plants. The last-minute reprieve was almost entirely due to the growing anxiety about global warming.

 Oil scare

 Russia?s decision to ratify the Kyoto accord on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is making the idea of paying for excess carbon emissions a reality, which transforms the economics of low-carbon energy sources like nuclear power. Oil at $ 54 per barrel doesn?t hurt the competitiveness of nuclear energy either.

 As the International Atomic Energy Agency noted recently, nuclear power?s 16 per cent share in global electricity generation saves around 600 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year. In contrast, electricity generated by burning fossil fuels accounts for one-third of the entire human contribution to greenhouse gases worldwide. The whole nuclear power cycle from uranium mining and reactor construction to waste disposal has a carbon emission cost comparable to solar power and wind power ? so suddenly, nuclear is sexy.

 The nuclear power lobby has leapt on this new argument. But is this going to push the world back into a major commitment to nuclear energy?

 Nature power

 In many ways, the case for nuclear power today is different from that 20 years ago. Modern reactor designs are less complex and thus safer than their predecessors, using fewer pumps and other moving parts, and far less of the pipes and cables where problems most often occur. They produce around one-tenth the nuclear waste as older designs, and there are better methods of disposing of the waste. However, reactors take an eternity to build ? 8 to 10 years is the normal construction time ? and their capital cost is immense.

 Solar energy, wind and other natural forces can be exploited to meet rising demand for electrical power far more quickly: Britain hopes to generate 15 per cent of its electricity from wind in the next five years. Simple conservation measures are even faster and cheaper. The Rocky Mountain Institute calculates that saving a given amount of electricity by using energy more efficiently costs only one-seventh as much as generating the same amount of energy through nuclear power.

 So expect to see a few more nuclear power stations, even in Europe and North America, but not forests of the things.

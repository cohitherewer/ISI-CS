 MUM?S

 THE

 WORD

 In the mother of all brawls that is now rocking the Reliance behemoth, all eyes are on 70-year-old Kokilaben. But she is 

not ready to take sides. 

Not yet

FAMILY 

FEUDS

 THE PATHAKS: 

In a dispute over the 75-million-pound pickle empire, Shantagaury Pathak sided 

with son Kirit against her daughters 

 THE BIRLAS: Differences surfaced after chartered 

accountant R.S. Lodha staked claim to the late Priyamvada Birlas assets 

worth Rs 5000 crore

 THE BAJAJS: Rahul and younger brother Shishir 

were locked in a dispute over family assets worth Rs 2000 crore.

 Mom?s gonna yell ? the billboard on Mumbai?s buzzing Western Express Highway announces. The visual shows two school-going boys in mud-splattered clothes trying to wrest a football from each other. The ad announces Reliance Energy?s new initiative of demystifying the monthly electricity bills and giving its subscribers a choice in reading it in their mother tongue. With the drama over the reported differences between the Ambani brothers, the hoarding has been attracting eyeballs by the dozens. Mumbaikars have been trying to read symbolic meanings into the ad and wondering where the behemoth called Reliance Group will head in future.

 While the Sensex swerves up and down through the day, reacting to even the slighest tremor emerging from the epicentre of Sea Wind, the Ambani residence at Cuffe Parade, the corporate world has been spending agonising time over the possible impact if the Reliance empire splits vertically. But many believe the real key to what course the reported dispute between Reliance head honchos, Mukesh and Anil Ambani, takes, will remain with one person ? the Ambani matriarch, 70-year-old Kokilaben. 

 Last year, Anil Ambani defeated nominees like cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, actor Shah Rukh Khan, President Abdul Kalam and music director A.R. Rahman to be voted as the MTV Youth Icon. In his speech, he specifically thanked his mother for imbibing the right values in him.

 It is Kokilaben?s over-riding influence on both her sons that many Reliance watchers feel will steer the Rs 90,000-crore strong conglomerate out of its current hour of crisis. She maintains a low profile and is not as visible on Mumbai?s social scene as her daughters-in-law, Nita and Tina Ambani. But, her influence on both her sons and the family is clearly visible. Her presence at any Reliance function assumes significance and is generally taken as a sign that all?s well in the family. No wonder then that politicians close to the Ambani family and friends in the corporate world have been trying to persuade Kokilaben to step in and mediate between her two sons. Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh and Andhra Pradesh governor Sushil Kumar Shinde are reported to have telephoned her to iron out any differences between Mukesh and Anil.

 The storm on Mumbai?s jittery stock market started last week with a cryptic comment by Mukesh Ambani in a TV interview, which hinted that differences over ?ownership issues? did exist and they were in the private domain. Immediately after, speculative stories flashed in the media, he travelled to the US.

 On his return from the US, Mukesh Ambani issued a statement saying that his previous statement about ?ownership issues? had been torn out of context by the media, but did not issue a categorical denial of any reported differences with his younger sibling. 

 The Ambanis have been asked innumerable times about their differences, and have always candidly admitted that they do lead contrasting lifestyles, but they are committed to their father?s vision of making Reliance a powerful global company. ?At a personal front, he (Mukesh) is extremely different from me. His motto is potentially ?I am living to eat?, and mine is ?I am eating to live?,? Anil Ambani said in a TV interview in March this year. Compared to Mukesh, 44-year-old Anil led a flamboyant life, and remained in the media spotlight for reasons ranging from his 5 a.m. morning jogs to walking into the Rajya Sabha as an MP. Lately, tinselworld?s rumour mills had also been working overtime spinning stories of his close friendship with a beauty queen-turned-starlet until the actress categorically denied them earlier this month.

 But if it was father Dhirubhai who provided professional inspiration to the sons, mother Kokilaben made all the decisions at home. It was Kokilaben who spotted a young Nita Ambani during a dance recital at Birla Matoshri and chose her as her daughter-in-law. Anil?s marriage to glamorous Tina Munim was also solemnised after her blessings. It was also with her strong support that both Nita and Tina ventured into social activities. Nita Ambani runs the Dhirubhai Ambani International School in Mumbai and the Hurkissondas Hospital, while it was on Kokilaben?s initiation that Tina Ambani planned to support the cause of senior citizens and launch a magazine for the elderly.

 As the drama threatens to spill over into a possible legal battle, many of Mumbai?s eyes would look at the Reliance Energy hoarding and wonder.

 Pilgrim?s regress

 Sir ? Laloo Prasad Yadav has finally jumped on to the religion bandwagon (?Before the poll, the puja?, Sept 18). But that is entirely apt, given that he is the Union railways minister. What is not so apt is the advocate of communal harmony performing puja at Tirupati with the fanfare that would be easier to associate with Narendra Modi. Not that Laloo Yadav shuns religious celebrations. Holi is an important annual event at 1, Anne Marg, Patna. But it is less of a religious occasion than an opportunity to show the family?s closeness to the masses. The minister?s wife and chief minister of Bihar, Rabri Devi, observes Chhat Puja every year with great ardour, providing the media with great photo-ops. But again, it is seen as a domestic ritual of the good wife and seldom as a religious event. But after the Tirupati pilgrimage, the messiah of Bihar may have to attend a few more iftaars than usual.

 Yours faithfully,

Seema Nagraj, Mumbai

 Number of problems

 Sir ? The census department?s incompetence defies belief. It now turns out that the much-vaunted ?higher Muslim growth rate? is owing to the inclusion of Jammu and Kashmir in the 2001 census ? which makes it appear that the entire state?s population has been born in the Nineties. If Kashmir is excluded, the reports say, the growth rate of Muslims has fallen. Any high school statistics student would have been failed for making such a mistake. On such a politically sensitive subject, it constitutes unpardonable negligence or politically motivated manipulation. The persons responsible should be immediately pulled up and the error publicly declared. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shankar Gopalakrishnan, London 

 Sir ? Kajal Chatterjee?s view that Hindus should not have a problem if India were to turn into a Muslim-majority nation is quite mad (?Figure it out?, Sept 14). If India really becomes a Muslim-majority state, it will no longer remain a secular state since no country ? from Indonesia to Tunisia ? where Muslims are majority, is a secular state. Turkey is the only Muslim country that has had some experience of secularism although it has been ruled in the recent past by the Islamic Welfare Party and its flag still flaunts Islamic signs. Where is secularism in Pakistan and in Bangladesh? If Muslims become the majority in India, it will become Pakistan, so feels Ashis Bose, the demographer. That may take 370 years. Or less, if we have many like Chatterjee among us.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? We in India learn that the growth rate of Muslims here is many times more than that of Hindus and we generally believe it. Therefore it did not come as a surprise when the recent analysis on the census report divulged that Muslims have grown faster than Hindus during 1991-2001. And it was ?alarming?, according to some quarters. But soon it was detected that the 1991 census figures did not take into count Jammu and Kashmir and Assam. Consequently the modified comparative figures came out to be much less ?alarming?. 

 Sumit Mitra deals with the issue in his ?Get the numbers right? (Sept 14) and ?Train from Bangladesh? (Sept 15). In the first, he points out that ?Muslims in India have always grown at a faster rate than Hindus. Now the difference seems to be narrowing down.? He also shatters the popular belief that high growth rate of Muslims is due to the prevalence of polygamy among them. He quotes figures to show that polygamous marriages are found more among Hindus than Muslims. He argues low infant mortality or low female literacy also cannot explain the ?high growth rate of Muslims?. 

 Having exonerated the Muslims of all their lapses, some of them nurtured by popular belief, Mitra arrives at the conclusion that Muslim infiltration from Bangladesh is solely responsible for the spectacular Muslim growth rate not only in Assam and West Bengal, but also in Bihar, New Delhi and Mumbai. Bangladesh, he points out, is a country of ?abject poverty and rural poverty and a non-existent public distribution system?. India too is not a rich country. Is it in good taste to make such comments about our neighbour even if they happen to be true? In his second piece, Mitra refers to Murshidabad as the only Muslim-majority district in West Bengal ?with little interference from the state in the lifestyle of the district?s majority community?. But how is it related to the issue being discussed? He even takes recourse to a comment of Henry Kissinger who had commented on the birth of Bangladesh that ?it might set a precedent for the creation of other Moslem States, carved this time out of India?. If we had not protested when Kissinger had written that, we must do so now when someone quotes him, for raising the alarm for the so-called rising Muslim population. Interestingly, it was reported on September 15 that in West Bengal, the growth rates of Hindus and Muslims have gone down by 7.16 per cent and 11.52 per cent respectively during 1991-2001. So what is the alarm all about?

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Instead of cribbing about the rise in the Muslim population, why don?t Hindus either increase their own numbers or stay quiet?

 To plan or not to plan a family is one?s personal choice, one of the few basic freedoms every individual has, no matter what his religion, social status, or personal wealth. To infringe upon this right with government-sponsored programmes is appalling. Throughout India?s history, our population has been our biggest asset. Let it continue to be so, irrespective of its composition.

 Yours faithfully,

Haricharan Ghosh, Calcutta

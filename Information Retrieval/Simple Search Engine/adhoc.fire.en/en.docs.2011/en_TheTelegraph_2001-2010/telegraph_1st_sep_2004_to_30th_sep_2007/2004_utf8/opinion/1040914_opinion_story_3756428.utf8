 ALWAYS AT YOUR BECK AND CALL

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 The mobile has occasioned not only a revolution in consumer culture, but also in social behaviour

 Keeping in touch

 There was nothing remarkable about the young man walking down the street. Khadi kurta, jeans, open sandals, shaggy hair ? he was the archetypal aantel. Except for the mobile he was speaking into. Not that there was anything particularly out of the ordinary about that. After all, one hears of boys taking mobile phones to school, showing off their latest Nokias, and girls chattering nineteen to the dozen into them during the recess. Housewives carry them around as badges of their husbands? wealth and generosity; electricians, plumbers and the like too have discovered their uses. I have even seen a young boy talking on a cell-phone held in one hand while, with the other, he clung on to the door of a crowded public bus. 

 That I noticed the young man at all perhaps has to do with the fact that his attire evoked a stereotype ? of someone too taken up with cerebral pursuits to respond to the lures of consumerism, a stereotype into which the cell-phone just did not fit. Maybe this shows how useless stereotypes are for making sense of human diversity. Or maybe it is time to revise the antel stereotype to include the cell- phone, given that the latter seems to have become an inseparable part of our lives, almost like a bodily appendage. 

 And how fast. Statistics from the TRAI website say that there are 33.69 million mobile subscribers in the country now, up from 1.9 million just four years ago ? an incredible growth of 159 per cent, and that soon India will overtake China as the country with the most mobile phone users. 

 How has this minor revolution happened? It is a revolution, no doubt, because it was only a generation ago that we were queuing up to get one of those solid black ITI dial-ups installed in our homes. It is a revolution also because, in just a few years, the mobile phone has gone from being a luxury item for the rich to something a large section of the masses feel they ?need?. How is it that Indians have suddenly discovered the virtues of always being on call when they are on the move? There has always been the small baby or the sick grandmother at home, and job recruiters have always chosen to call just when one has stepped out for a moment. 

 Perhaps, our pockets feel good enough to take on the monthly drain, as well as that occasioned by the need to upgrade, to keep up with the Joneses, changing technology, fashion?or the weather. What it definitely is, is a testimony to the success of the cell phone companies? marketing strategies.

 But the revolution has not just been one in consumer culture. It has also been a revolution in social behaviour. If the mobile is especially useful as a digital leash for employers or spouses, it has been used with as good a purpose by truant employees or adulterers. 

 There has also been a conflation of the public and the private, especially when the most intimate of conversations are conducted in a crowded metro, or inside a share-taxi whose darkness gives one the illusion of privacy. It gives being ?alone in a crowd? a whole new meaning. But of course, one is never alone; there are always the eaves droppers (to be sure, many a time there is little choice but to listen) who are afforded tantalizing glimpses into other lives, other worlds.

 THE OLD ORDER LURKS

 GWYNNE DYER

 It?s not just Ukraine?s fate that is at stake in that polls that took place on Sunday; it is probably Russia?s as well. If the Kremlin?s favoured candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, wins, then Ukraine will end up inside a Russia-dominated common market that also includes the authoritarian regimes of Belarus and Kazakhstan and effectively recreates the old Soviet Union. Any hope of Russian democracy re-emerging from the wreckage would go from slim to non-existent. 

 The democracy that is at risk at the moment, however, is Ukraine?s fragile and much-abused version of it: Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Belarus?s Stalinist dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, both showed up to support Yanukovych just before the first round of voting on October 31. Yet, when all the votes were counted, the main democratic candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, managed to end up with a wafer-thin lead. The other 18 candidates were eliminated, and both Yushchenko and Yanukovych made it to the second round.

 But nobody trusts the totals from the first round. Indeed, some time back, a group of senior police officers from Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine wrote to the speaker of the parliament, Volodymyr Lytvyn, detailing massive election fraud in the first round.

 Post-modern games

 It?s all going to happen again this time, the Kharkiv whistle-blowers warned, and no doubt they are right. Yet, despite having stuffed the ballot boxes to guarantee a first-round Yanukovych victory, the authorities wound up announcing a final count that put Yushchenko slightly ahead and forced the contest into a second round. They did so because, had they declared a Yanukovych victory, there would have been mass civil disobedience in the streets.

 The game that is being played in Ukraine is distinctly post-modern. The outgoing president, Leonid Kuchma, wants to ensure the election of a reliable successor, Viktor Yanukovych, who will not launch awkward inquiries into how most of the existing government?s members became disgustingly rich. Viktor Yushchenko, who gained a reputation for honesty as the head of the national bank and then cracked down on corruption as prime minister until Kuchma?s pals had him dismissed for wrecking their scams, has gained the public?s trust, and would certainly win in a fair election.

 It must therefore not be a fair election ? but since Ukrainians are not fools, it must not look too unfair, either. 

 Hope in failure

 A Yanukovych win would mean that Ukrainians had voted to shrink their ties with the E uropean Union, the main source of the recent and long-overdue surge in economic growth in the country, and had instead chosen to expand their ties with the still decrepit economy and increasingly authoritarian political style of their former Russian rulers. Intuitively, most Ukrainians would not believe such a result. 

 The goal of Kuchma, Yukanovych and their Russian allies is to come up with a win that just barely passes public inspection and does not provoke mass civil disobedience. They can only get even within hailing distance of their goal because of their divisive appeals to Ukraine?s substantial Russian minority ? offering them official-language status, visa-free travel to Russia, and dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship ? but even then the problem lies in the fine-tuning. 

 If the Putin-Kuchma-Yanukovych combine succeed, then Ukraine?s 50 million people will shortly be swallowed up in a post-Soviet union that incorporates all the corruption of the original, but none of the idealism. If it fails and Yushchenko?s centre-left coalition wins, then it is possible to imagine Ukraine joining the EU 10 or 15 years from now. It is also possible to imagine Russia itself returning to democracy and joining the EU. But only if the present project fails.

 LEFT TO ITS OWN DEVICES

 Gwynne Dyer

 The rhetoric had been getting harsher for months, as Taiwan?s leaders stoked popular fears of Communist China?s intentions in an attempt to push through a controversial $18 billion arms purchase from the United States of America. It reached a peak when president Chen Sui-bian warned that the People?s Liberation Army now has 610 ballistic missiles aimed at the island, with the number forecast to 800 by next year ? enough to wipe out most of Taiwan?s defences in a few hours. Prime minister Yu Shyikun went further, calling for Taiwan to develop its own offensive missiles to deter a Communist attack. 

 Blood-curdling stuff, even if none of the warheads on those missiles would be nuclear. China reacted with fury to the suggestion that Taiwan might make a retaliatory strike against cities on the mainland.

 The US, preoccupied with Iraq and the elections, made virtually no response to China?s threats, but many countries in the region had been warning Taiwan for months that if it got into a shooting war with China, it was on its own. 

 Home alone

 Unfortunately, very few Taiwanese leaders understand this. Foreign minister Chen Tan-sun responded to Singapore?s warning by accusing it of ?hugging China?s balls?. But by late September, the message was starting to get through. Taiwan?s defence ministry back-pedalled rapidly on Yu?s talk of firing missiles at Shanghai, denying any intention of creating a ?balance of terror? with the mainland. And then, on October 10, Taiwan?s National Day, president Chen Shui-bian, went into reverse on all fronts.

 He praised China?s reforms, welcomed the new leadership in Beijing, and called for an arms control agreement between the two governments to dispel the ?dark forces? that were gathering in the Taiwan Strait. More dramatically, he said that he was ready to resume the political dialogue between Taipei and Beijing, dormant for five years because of the pro-independence stance of his Democratic Progressive Party ? and that he was willing to do so on the very basis that he had always rejected in the past.

 When Taiwan and China first opened direct talks in 1993, the Nationalist Party was still in power in Taipei, and it had no objection to negotiating on the basis that there might be two rival regimes at the moment, but there was only ?one China?. The Nationalists had retreated to Taiwan after losing China?s civil war but they were as determined as the Communists that the motherland must eventually be reunited. They just differed on who should be running it.

 Old game

 The first DPP president, Lee Teng-hui, caused a rupture in the talks when he called for a ?special state-to-state relationship? between the two countries in 1999, and until now Chen Shui-bian has followed the same line. His declaration that he is willing to resume talks on the basis of ?one China? was a huge climb-down.

 As China?s economy grows, its importance to its trading partners, including the US, makes them ever more reluctant to confront Beijing over Taiwan, and the Iraq quagmire makes Washington doubly reluctant to contemplate further military commitments in east Asia. Taiwan is on its own, and the old DPP game of talking about independence in order to get the Communists to threaten Taiwan, thereby driving resentful Taiwanese voters into the DPP?s arms, is over.

 The more level-headed elements in the DPP never really believed that an independent and internationally recognized Taiwan was a possibility; now they will have to stop pretending to the voters that it is possible. The best they can hope for is a prolongation of the status quo until, some day, China becomes a democracy and reunification becomes a more palatable prospect.

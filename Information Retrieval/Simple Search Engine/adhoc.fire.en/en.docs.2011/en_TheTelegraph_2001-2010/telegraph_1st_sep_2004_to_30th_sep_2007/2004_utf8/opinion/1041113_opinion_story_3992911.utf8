 Letters to Editor

 Selling land or selling out?

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s excitement about the two Indonesian companies? $350 million investment in West Bengal is not contagious at all (?Foreign funds find Bengal home?, Nov 9). It is one thing to have funds to invest and quite another to put them to proper use. Recall how the state has been losing its precious wetlands to garish housing estates. It is a pity that the foreign funds, while promising a million other dreams, will hasten the thoughtless destruction of the city?s ecology.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Mandal, Howrah

 On slippery ground

 Sir ? The recent hike in cooking gas prices will burn a hole in the pockets of the middle classes (?PM sticks to oil price rise?, Nov 8). But one wonders why the government chose such fractional amounts to price the cooking gas. The rise in the price of LPG by Rs 21.70 effectively means a rise of Rs 22, and the customer will pay Rs 310 since the balance 30 paise will not be returned. It will be the same for other petroleum products. The foregone change will amount to a sizeable sum and it is a pity that it will only add to the dealers? profits. Policy-makers are hardly being practical, especially since small change has become scarce in the market.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The rise in petroleum prices may be justified, keeping in mind the increase in crude prices globally. But a thought should have been spared for the middle class which will bear the brunt of the price hike. What the government could have done at this stage is look into the misuse of oil. Politicians and bureaucrats are entitled to government cars and use them liberally ? for dropping children at schools, for marketing and for other personal uses. Such extravagance ought to be curbed and ministers? pay packets revised. 

Yours faithfully, 

S. Chakraborty, Calcutta 

Sir ? Administered pricing of petroleum products was supposed to have been lifted by now. But this seems next to impossible. The government could come up with strategic plans to reduce import of petrol products, increase indigenous production, devise ways for the conservation of fossil fuels and encourage alternative energy resources. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It appears that our politicians were waiting for George W. Bush to win the elections to raise petroleum prices so that they could pass the buck and escape public backlash (?Bush win costs Indians dear?, Nov 5). International crude prices are lower than they were a week back. A comparison between the oil prices in the US and India is enough to show the enormous amount we have to shell out for a litre of petrol. In all the hullabaloo over rising prices, it would be nice if the government were to make it clear what the actual price of petrol and the rates of taxation are. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.J. Borkakoty, Dibrugarh

 Sir ? It is not unknown that fuel prices are dictated by price movements in the international market. The erstwhile National Democratic Alliance government followed this dictate only to be shouted down by the Congress then. The latter have resorted to the same move now that it is in power. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Rangamati, Midnapore

 Parting shot

 Sir ? We all knew Ashok Mitra was close to the loony fringe, but his ?Policy of the principle? (Nov 12) indicates that his prose has gone far beyond that. Will Mitra please care to explain what he means by ?principle of the policy of the principle? or ?the principle of the principle of the policy??

 Yours faithfully,

M. Srivastava, Calcutta

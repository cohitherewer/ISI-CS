 Letters to Editor

 Kiss but don?t tell

 Sir ? Now that a kiss has become front page news, I am forced to ask why has Indian journalism become so devalued (?Kareena hisses at kissing pictures?, Dec 17)? It is disgraceful to witness the media trying to sell such a non-event as news. The political stage has already been taken over by cine stars, who are honoured with one-fourth of the news pages every day. Do we really need to bring people?s private moments onto the page? The media needs to draw a line and keep a dignified distance from trivia.

 Yours faithfully,

Sudipta Sengupta, Dhanbad

 Not above board

 Sir ? The board examination proposed by the West Bengal Primary Education Council at the end of class IV might bring a change in the fa?ade of a system, but what about the quality of education (?Failed young?, Dec 13)? Failing a student so early in life will solve no one?s purpose, in fact, it is going to make the situation more difficult for a child who will suddenly have to live up to the pressures of ?passing? a board exam when he should not be taking any examination at all. The council must understand that the result is not the last criterion to judge a student?s capability, certainly not for students who are not old enough to grasp the real purpose of this type of examination. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raza M. Kamal, Gaya

 Sir ? Failure in class IV can cause a student to drop out or lead to an inferiority complex. As it is, the suicide rate is exceedingly high in the state. If the council is desperate to introduce the examination, it should enable students to have more than one chance to clear the examination. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 Sir ? I agree that the decision of the West Bengal Primary Education Council to hold a state-level examination to promote students to class V is nothing but a gimmick. Not only will it not improve the system, it will create unnecessary burden on children who are yet to understand the difference between a ?pass? and a ?fail?. Unless the whole educational set-up is overhauled, another examination will not have any impact. However, the move to introduce English from class I is welcome.

 Yours faithfully,

Tamanna Parween, Gaya

 Parting shot

 Sir ? On December 10, Human Rights Day, G.D. Birla Sabhaghar hosted a performance by Loknaad, a group formed by Vinay Mahajan and Charul Bharwada (?Taking the path less trodden?, Dec 15). Through their words and songs, the two brought out the suffering of victims of violence. Young people are the agents of social change. But that evening, the auditorium was filled mostly with middle-aged people. Why are the youth so unconcerned about issues like corruption, child labour, violence, religion and so on that will affect them the most in future?

Yours faithfully, 

Shalini Gupta, Calcutta

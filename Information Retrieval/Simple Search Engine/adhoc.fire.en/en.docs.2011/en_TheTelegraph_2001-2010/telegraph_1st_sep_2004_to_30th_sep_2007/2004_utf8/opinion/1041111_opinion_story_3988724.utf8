 RANK AND BILE

 The judiciary has too much on its plate. Aggrieved officers of the Indian Air Force rushed to the Delhi high court to challenge the recommendations of the air force?s promotion board. The board had recommended the promotion of four officers to the rank of air marshal while denying the same to the two complainants. According to the high court, the promotions were discriminatory and the promotion policy of the air force lacking in credibility. It has ordered the formation of a new board and a fresh policy for promotions. The court felt that the IAF?s promotion policy violated Article 14 of the Constitution, that is, the right to equality.

 Promotion within an organization is an internal matter, to be worked out on the basis of requirements generated by the kind of work the organization does. It is a professional, and often technical, issue. Every organization has its own internal problems and conflicts, and its interpersonal dynamics have to be managed by its own checks and balances. Asking the judiciary to be arbiters in a matter internal to the organization, where there has been no cognizable violation of the law of the land, is to put the court in the position of having to intervene in a matter that should strictly be resolved within the organization concerned. This is disadvantageous in a number of ways. For one, this kind of complaint loads the court, which is heavily burdened, further with cases that should not come to it at all. Then again, it invites the court into areas that are really not under its purview. This is particularly damaging, since it disturbs that delicate balance that separates the judicial from the executive. In the IAF case, for example, the court has stepped directly into an internal promotion policy. It is also demoralizing for the organization being put through its paces. Making institutions defensive does not help transparency in the long run. If a new policy is needed, the impetus should come from within an organization, not be imposed on it by a powerful external agency.

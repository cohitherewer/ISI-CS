 WHATS THE RIGHT PRICE? 

 - Drug manufacturers to meet the minister on Sept. 24

 Medicines, says Ram Vilas Paswan, must be affordable to the common man. But imposing a blanket price control has its own hazards. G.S. Mudur and Swagata Sen report

Drug inspector call him X, for he wishes to remain anonymous probably didnt know just how big an apple cart his daylong assignment was going to upset. Under orders that emanated from the very top the new chemicals and fertilisers minister, Ram Vilas Paswan X called on over 25 drug stores around the Capital. His task: to find out exactly what levels of profit segments of the drug industry were reaping. He came back with a figure of 2000 per cent.

The findings didnt please Paswan. And hes set into 

motion what may turn out to be an effective crackdown on excessive profiteering 

by drug companies. He has proposed that companies expose their profits to the 

public. And this, the minister hopes, will shame the industry into voluntarily 

reducing prices.

Brand 

appeal 

 Opponents of price control say 

market forces would help reduce prices. If free-market features work in the pharmaceutical 

sector, top-selling brands would almost always sell at the lowest prices. Instead, 

surveys indicate that top-selling brands are also the higher priced brands. 

 A brand of acyclovir priced at Rs 1666 had a market of Rs 3.1 crore, 

compared to another brand of acyclovir priced at Rs 812 which made Rs 57 lakh 

over the same period.

 A brand of gliclazide priced at Rs 65 per strip had a market of Rs 7 crore, 

compared to a less expensive version of the same drug which got only Rs 66 lakh.

 Antibiotics cefataxime, amoxycillin, roxithromycin, erythromycin and norfloxacin 

are all price leaders as well as brand leaders.

Drug prices always a contentious issue are under 

the arc lights. A section of the government is not with the minister on the move, 

and the drug industry itself is worried about the repercussions of the initiative. 

But health activists, long campaigning for lower drug prices, have welcomed the 

proposal. And the minister himself is up in arms against what he believes is an 

industry rip-off.

 Such trade margins are totally unreasonable and unacceptable, Paswan said. The government, he held, would make it mandatory for companies to print the cost of production on the packaging of medicines in addition to the existing maximum retail price (the maximum that consumers can be charged), thus making profits in the pharmaceutical trade channels transparent.

 Paswans hope is that the disclosure of the high levels of profits would push prices down. Consumer education and awareness would lead to its own logical conclusion and high trade margins might get reduced, if not abolished, Paswan said.

 The minister, clearly, is working against the tide, for over the past 25 years, the government has steadily been taking medicines out of the price control basket. Now, Paswan has even set up a government panel to examine whether more drugs need to be placed under price control. 

 The governments common minimum programme promises to ensure that life-saving drugs are made available to consumers at reasonable prices. Paswan has also ordered the ministry-run National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) to track the prices of 300 drugs that the ministry has classified as essential medicines.

 Not surprisingly, this has set off alarm bells across the drug industry and even within sections of the government which believe the measures may stifle the local industry.

 Price control will kill sections of the industry and hurt consumers, says Daara Patel, secretary general of the Indian Drugs Manufacturers Association (IDMA), maintaining that profiteering is not exorbitant. Price control, it argues, is a disincentive to manufacturers and will lead to companies abandoning drugs on which government fixes prices.

 Patel cites a study tracking growth trends in Indias pharmaceuticals sector, revealing sharp differences between drugs whose prices are controlled and those not in the control basket. The investigation, conducted by the market research agency, AC Nielsen-ORG MARG and often used by sections of the government to argue against price control shows that sales of drugs whose prices are not controlled grew by 9 per cent last year, while sales of those under price control declined by 1 per cent.

 While the industry may have its own interests in mind, price control has its detractors even among government officials. Price control selectively acts against domestic drug manufacturers, says a top official in Paswans own ministry. The government has the authority to scrutinise the itemised production costs of only local industry while fixing prices. It has to blindly accept figures for production and freight quoted by foreign drug companies.

Line 

of Control

Over theYears 

 1962 

The year of the Chinese aggression. Government decided to freeze prices of all 

bulk drugs (the chief ingredients of a drug) and formulations (the packaged drugs 

sold in the market) under the Defence of India Act.

1966 

Four years into freezing prices, the government realised it wouldnt work 

forever, as manufacturing costs kept on rising. At the behest of the NPPA, it 

decided to defreeze drug prices.

1970 

The most important year as far as Indian pharmaceutical companies are concerned. 

Drugs were brought under the Essential Commodities Act, and it was decided that 

there would be no product patent for drugs, but a process patent. Which effectively 

translated into one drug company being able to sell a product developed by another, 

as long as they manufactured it by a different process.

1979 

At the recommendation of the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO), 347 drugs were placed 

under price control. These drugs were classified as life-saving drugs, although 

the definition of life-saving has never been clear. For example, a 

drug for blindness came under the list.

1986

A revised policy recommended by the DPCO and the first attempts at market reform 

brought down the list of controlled drugs to 142.

1995 

This time, the number of controlled drugs was further brought down to 74. That 

is the number that exists today, despite a fresh DPCO report being released in 

2002 which sought to bring it down to 28. By this time the drug industry in India 

had reached colossal proportions. Competition and market forces were expected 

to lower prices.

2002

The fresh recommendation by DPCO to cut it down further to 28 was buried under 

a court case. Its still stuck.

2004 

Ram Vilas Paswan came to the aid of the country which now has 17,000 drug companies. 

The minister ordered the tracking and monitoring of 300 medicines deemed essential 

by the health ministry.

Drug manufacturers are slated to meet the minister on September 24, where they will put forward the industrys concerns. The manufacturers also plan to tell the government that ordering companies to print ex-factory prices would be an encroachment on company privacy, and ask why the government is singling the drug industry out.

 But there is always another side to a story. Independent drug industry analysts and non-government agencies are scoffing at the suggestion that competition reduces prices of drugs. Analysts point out that trends in the pharmaceutical sales show that drugs do not follow classic market behaviour the largest share of the market for the least expensive product. Industry analysts point out several instances where the highest priced brand of a drug actually enjoys the highest market share. For instance, the most expensive brand of an anti-hypertension drug called enalapril has been the market leader for 15 years.

 But that is simply because drugs are not like any other consumer item. Its downright stupid and selfish to equate drugs with other consumer products, says Dr Chandra Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, an independent drugs journal. For the consumer, the decision to buy a drug is involuntary and unavoidable. A drug is the only item where the decision to buy is not taken by a consumer but by either a doctor or a chemist.

 Exorbitant profiteering in the industry is largely dependent on excessive, inappropriate, and even illegal prescriptions and sales, says Gulhati. And non-government organisations (NGOs) working on health issues stress that doctors dont always keep in mind patients abilities to afford medicines when prescribing. 

 They argue that doctors are more likely to be influenced by the promotional campaigns and incentives from drug companies. Theyre preying on the vulnerabilities of desperate people, says Dr Amit Sengupta, a member of the Peoples Health Movement, an NGO focusing on public health.

 Those arguing for lower drug prices also question the ethics of a section of the government using private surveys to make a case against price control, stressing that there are vested interests involved. The pharma division of ORG-MARG, for instance, is currently owned by an international pharmaceutical research company. The governments own price control body, the NPPA, also relies on data provided by ORG-MARG. How ethical is it for Indian policy-makers to rely on data disbursed by a multinational with little understanding of reaching health to Indian people? asks S. Srinivasan, managing trustee of LoCost, a non-profit trust in Baroda that manufactures generic drugs at low cost.

 Some manufacturers claim that high-priced brands are good quality drugs. Rajesh Jain, joint managing director of Panacea Biotec, a leading manufacturer of nimesulide, stresses that some brands are expensive because of high production standards and research and marketing costs. However, one industry source points out that two brands of nimesulide produced by two companies with comparable quality standards have a massive price difference; one costs a retailer about Rs 25, the other, Rs 4.

 The issue shows few signs of an early resolution. An IDMA source says it may offer the minister a six-month freeze in drug prices, claiming that its members are already exercising price restraint keeping in mind consumer affordability.

 The drug industry representatives plan to ask the minister to focus on the post-2005 era when product patents will come into effect. They are worried about the likely impact of new patent laws that may force Indian companies to stop manufacturing patented products. As a signatory to an international trade agreement, India has to amend its patent laws granting product patents to drug companies. 

 Until now, Indias drug industry has burgeoned thanks largely to reverse engineering in other words, copying drug molecules through novel processes. Post-January 2005, product patents will change that.

 Thats the real challenge that the industry and the nation faces, says Patel.

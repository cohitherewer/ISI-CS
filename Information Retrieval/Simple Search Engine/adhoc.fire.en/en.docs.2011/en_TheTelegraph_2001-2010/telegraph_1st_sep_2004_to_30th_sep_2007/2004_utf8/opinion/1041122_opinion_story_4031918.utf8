 GOING BEYOND WORDS

Twenty- Twenty / Bharat Bhushan

 Tied loosely

 One of the outcomes of the visit of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to The Hague for the India-European Union summit earlier this month was that the two entities entered into a ?strategic partnership.? The summit has been described as ?historic? and the strategic partnership as symbolizing ?a qualitative transformation? of the relationship.

 A fine weave of words but perhaps slightly far from the truth. There is a feeling among the Europeans that India still has little perception of the EU?s emergence as a new pole in international relations. The security concerns of India and Europe, they argue, border on the same region ? from the Hindukush to the Mediterranean. These concerns are not only about nuclear, chemical and biological weapons but also about terrorism and relations with Islam. Yet, they think that India does not relate with the EU as a security entity.

 The EU is the largest economic grouping in the world but it has not yet emerged as a unified security entity. India, therefore, relates with it essentially as an economic bloc. The EU is India?s largest trade and investment partner. But it is also quite protectionist. It has been raising difficult environment and labour issues at the WTO that go against India?s interests. It has also launched the largest number of anti-dumping investigations against India. There are some who believe that the EU is deliberately bloody-minded in entangling India in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy web.

 Although the votaries of the EU complain that India still prefers to deal with its constituents on a bilateral basis, they also make use of the incompleteness of the federation to their advantage. ?They shuttle you between Brussels and the national capitals on tricky issues? is the common perception in New Delhi.

 Foreign policy essentially remains a national policy in the EU despite some coordination. India cannot deal with the EU as a state because it does not have a common foreign and security policy. India also prefers to deal with France and Britain, not because they are smarter but because they are permanent members of the United Nations security council. In the security council, their views are derived from their membership of that body and not as EU members. The other EU constituents, especially Germany, do not think of the present security council as a democratic or representative body. The six-monthly rotating presidency of the EU has also contributed to the security council?s unsatisfactory relationship with the EU.

 The new constitution of the EU envisages a foreign minister for the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers. Meanwhile, the differing views among the constituent countries have meant that the policy that emerges is the lowest common denominator on each issue. This may not be congenial to New Delhi?s interests.

 That the EU is not a unified security organization becomes clear on the issues of nuclear proliferation. New Delhi finds it more pragmatic to deal with Britain and France on these issues, as they are nuclear weapon states. The other EU members, in India?s perception, end up taking an ideological position on nuclear weapons.

 In the case of frontier technologies, especially the global positioning satellite project, Galileo, the EU would like India to invest nearly $ 300 million but refuses to share the military codes for the project. It claims that such codes have also not been provided to China. China may be a potential adversary but that cannot be the case with India. New Delhi is, therefore, right in trying to explore a similar GPS project called Glonass with Russia, which is more likely to share information. The project could, therefore, be more participative.

 India is interested in participating in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project (nuclear fusion technology) but what good is it if the EU is going to remain bound by the Nuclear Suppliers Group? The technology may not be supplied to India at all.

 There seems to be an apparent convergence of Indian and European interests on multipolarity. But Britain does not believe in multipolarity. It also does not see itself as European. Britain has always kept Europe divided and even today does not want it to become strong so that the continent remains digestible for its ally, the United States of America. France disagrees but its notion of multipolarity is different from Germany?s. Germany in fact seeks to work with the US and has no desire to make the EU a counterweight to Washington.

 EU?s east European countries have a very pro-US mindset. They had a harrowing time during the Cold War and still suffer from the mindset of victims. They are not inclined to the re-emergence of Russia as a major power and do not believe in multipolarity. There is no consensus on the issue within the EU, despite the Franco-German leadership in the matter.

 Under these circumstances, what does strategic partnership mean? It means that Europe is finally taking note of the conventional wisdom that in the next decade India will emerge as a regional and global power. Aware of their small size, both geographically and economically, the members of the EU see the economic potential of dealing with a population of over one billion and with an economic growth rate of 5 to 6 per cent becoming a huge market. The EU is developing a stake in that market.

 Behind this, of course, is the fact that all the major players in EU support India?s membership of the security council ? Britain and France directly, and there is an agreement with Germany of mutual support for each other?s candidature. There also seems to be a recognition that India?s nuclear capability means that it will have an important role to play in any non-proliferation regime, though not necessarily in the treaties.

 Europe also feels the need to engage India, which has a huge Muslim population, on Islam. Europe is caught in the contradiction of building walls against Islam and mulling Turkey?s entry to the EU at the same time. It will be eventually unavoidable and perhaps Europe will realize that it is better to have a moderate state structure in Turkey than to leave the country to fend for itself. But to come to that unambiguous conclusion, Europe needs a dialogue with Islam to understand how its moderate tendencies can be encouraged.

 However, New Delhi also has to reciprocate the logic of the relationship by giving content to the strategic partnership. However, it does not seem to be making the choices it needs to make to develop the special relationship it seeks with Europe. Concerns other than strategic seem to determine whether or not orders should be placed for Airbus or French Mirages and Scorpene submarines. Commercial and often corrupt considerations then supersede the strategic relationship that we seek.

 New Delhi, therefore, must also take the blame for not giving Europe a stake in the relationship. Otherwise, how can the strategic partnership with EU provide a balance to the US and Russia? If real content is not lent to the relationship, the annual India-EU summits are likely to remain only public relations events for the prime minister of the day. We Indians are superb with working on the basis of vocabulary. What is needed is action.

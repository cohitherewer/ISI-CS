 Letters to Editor

 Food for all

 Sir ? Mary Kate Olsen, if she has recovered completely after her 6-week stint in a clinic for an eating disorder, can take another shot at fame (?Celebrity ?thinspiration? for teens on the Net?, Nov 18). She could inspire her fans ? teenage girls bonding over their eating disorders on the internet ? to do a spot of relief work. This would be by pooling in the money saved by way of their modest eating habits and donating it to one of the United Nations? numerous famine-relief programmes. What they deny themselves so earnestly will be a blessing for those denied of it.

 Yours faithfully,

Arati Ghosh, Calcutta

 In gay abandon 

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Turn it down? (Nov 15), mentions that environmental activists as well as the West Bengal Pollution Control Board have blamed the administration for inaction against those who have flouted the noise pollution rules set by the judiciary and the Central government. The WBPCB is no less inactive in dealing with public complaints against pollution. One such complaint by the residents of Bhowanipore was lodged with the board ? No. 2002-11/854 dated December 5, 2002 ? against persisting noise pollution as well as the insufferable smell in the area. In spite of a number of reports of the PCB scientist and environment engineers supporting our cause, senior law officers keep stalling the case. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Bhattacharya, Calcutta 

 Sir ? I reside in Hazra in south Calcutta, adjacent to a slum whose residents celebrate Kali puja. On the two days of the puja, we had to put up with loud firecrackers, drums, conches, not to speak of loudspeakers, from early morning till around midnight. The racket created was well above the permitted decibel level. Rationalizing with the revellers and polite requests were of no help. We did call up the local police station only to be told that the noise pollution was transient and we were best advised to put up with it and wait till the festivities were over. This conversation took place at 1 a.m. in the morning. 

 One cannot perceive what entertainment is derived from such raucous celebrations. Laws against noisy firecrackers and the pollution they result in continue to exist, but these laws are openly flouted and the police remain mute spectators. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arin Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? The whole of the south-east side of the Rashbehari Avenue crossing has been taken over by a growing number of footpath dwellers. The irony is that despite the pay-and-use toilet nearby, these people have chosen to use the recently beautified boulevards. They had organized two Kali pujas right on the footpaths, with pandals and blaring loudspeakers even when the police station is hardly a 100 metres away. The entire area also stinks, since the open spaces are used for garbage sorting or as cooking spaces, but none of the administrative departments care to notice the same. What does the mayor, so eager to beautify the city, have to say about this pollutant? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Out and About

At 69, Shyam Benegal is discovering the unbearable 

lightness of being. Art house cinema?s eminent director is now working on a contemporary 

comedy and a musical. ?It?s about how television impacts on a backward village,? 

says Benegal of the first film. The second will be operatic in structure and will 

therefore, unlike most of his other films, have lots of songs. So Karan Johar 

finally has competition? Your guess is as good as mine.

Asiana ahoy! 

 Ritu Beri

First it was food (curry, chicken tikka masala). Then music (the Rishi Riches). And now, Asians are making sure that British lifestyle will never be the same again. Harrods, that great British establishment which fell into ?wrong hands? a few years ago when Mohammad Al Fayed took over, is going Asian with a vengeance. And Indian designer Ritu Beri has been entrusted with the task. Beri is currently head-hunting for henna artists and potters. There?s going to be home decor, fashion, yoga, astrology and nature cure, all under that one ?hallowed? roof. Post-colonial hangover?

 Gil Alon 

If being a Buddhist in a Jewish country wasn?t radical enough, Gil Alon is doing a play on clones. The Israeli playwright is in Delhi this week with Mr C, a solo act about a clone who addresses a seminar. Don?t look for connections. Just that both Buddhism and cloning sell.

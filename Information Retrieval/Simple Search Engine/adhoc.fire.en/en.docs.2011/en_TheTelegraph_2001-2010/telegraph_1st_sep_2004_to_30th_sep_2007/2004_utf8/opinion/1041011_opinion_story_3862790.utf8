 ENGAGING NORTH-EAST MILITANTS

Twenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan

 Neighbourhood bully

 Two questions are being asked in the Indian establishment in the wake of the recent series of bomb blasts in Assam and Nagaland. Should the government talk to the insurgent outfits alleged to have been responsible? And secondly, how should New Delhi deal with those neighbouring countries which harbour these groups? While Myanmar has been fairly cooperative, Bangladesh is causing some serious concern. 

 Paresh Barua of the United Liberation Front of Asom has made a public offer of a dialogue only a day after the blasts. The National Democratic Front of Bodoland has declared a cease-fire ? presumably hoping for talks.

 It would be difficult to deny the importance of a political dialogue, as the issues being raised by the militant groups are political in nature. The problem of India?s North-east is not one of law and order and only obliquely a question of lack of development. Both the law and order situation and development indicators are perhaps much worse in some Hindi heartland states, for example.

 The problem in the North-east is peculiar. Only two per cent of the boundaries of the northeastern states is with the rest of India, 98 per cent is with Bhutan, China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Walls were erected after the Partition in 1947, through what were traditionally unified territories with constant movement of people. Irrational demarcation of state boundaries further accentuated the problem in post-independence India. Racial and tribal consciousness remain extremely strong in this area and the cultural and linguistic influence of the neighbouring countries continues to hold sway. The spread of Christianity has also rapidly Westernized some of these tribal societies and created a heightened sense of sub-national identity. This is a society in ferment where people feel alienated and powerless. Their traditional community support structures are eroding and nothing has filled the vacuum. The ruling political groups are like pirate ships ? their political affiliation merely a flag of convenience.

 New Delhi?s attempts at resolving the North-east?s problems have been either to throw money at it or to send in additional security forces. The greater portion of the development funds sent from New Delhi is divided among the ruling elite as a matter of right. The extortion demand of the militant groups is merely ?their share? of the loot. The security forces sent to curb militancy do not always behave towards civilians in a manner befitting a democracy.

 This vicious spiral of organized loot by the politicians, extortion by the militants and the increasing disenchantment of the ordinary folk cannot be broken with the help of the military. A political solution has to be sought for this malaise ? and dialogue with the militant groups is a step in that direction.

 That offers for a dialogue ? directly by the ULFA and indirectly by the NDFB ? should continue to be made even after terrorist attacks is being seen by some as a mere ploy to take the heat off the militant outfits. There are those who believe that some top ULFA and NDFB leaders are controlled by external forces inimical to India and that they are not sincere about a dialogue. In fact their role so far has been to sabotage any demand for a dialogue from within their organizations.

 However, Paresh Barua?s condition that any talks should be about ?sovereignty? makes it impossible for the Indian government to even contemplate a dialogue. The sovereignty of the Assamese people lies with them and not with anyone else. Besides, such a move would have a negative impact even on the Naga peace talks. If forced into competition with the ULFA, the Nagas may also end up hardening their stance on sovereignty-related issues.

 Barua would be better advised to suggest ?unconditional? talks ? no pre-conditions either from ULFA?s side or from New Delhi?s. This would leave the question of sovereignty open as it could be discussed along with a host of other issues that might be of concern to both sides.

 There are those who argue that ULFA should be weakened, as it was after the Bhutan operations last December, before being engaged in a dialogue. However, experience shows that killing ULFA cadres in Assam does not weaken its leadership. In the prevailing situation of large-scale unemployment and general alienation, the ULFA can easily recruit some more youngsters who are happy to get paid employment while espousing a cause.

 Meanwhile, the top leadership of the organization sits in Dhaka or Chittagong, protected ? some Indian observers believe ? by powerful elements in Bangladesh and funded both by them and other anti-India forces.

 The only way to make political talks viable in this context is to put pressure on Bangladesh to make it difficult for Indian insurgent groups to use its soil. Bangladeshi commentators have written reams in their newspapers about how their country has become a conduit for the illegal-arms trade.

 In April this year, the largest ever consignment of illegal arms was intercepted while being offloaded from two trawlers at a government-owned jetty in Chittagong. The jetty belonged to the government-owned Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Ltd. The arms seized included nearly 1,300 AK-47s, 25,000 hand grenades, 2,000 grenade launchers, 400 Uzi guns or semi-automatic spot rifles, 150 rocket launchers, 100 Italian-made Tommy guns, 6,400 sub-machine-gun magazines and 18.40 lakh rounds of bullets. And this was only a part of the consignment!

 The botched-up April landing threw up enough facts to encourage speculation about links between political leaders and the illegal arms trade in Bangladesh. The fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami leader, Mati-ur-Rahman Nizami, is the industries minister under whose charge the jetty falls; some of the ships that were berthed at the outer anchorage of Chittagong and from which the weapons were believed to have been unloaded belonged to a close associate of prime minister Khaleda Zia?s Bangladesh National Party; the seized trucks were later released at the intervention of people close to the BNP leadership; and the magistrate inquiring into the case found that the FIR had been doctored. Does joining these dots add up to a picture of Bangladesh?s complicity? One does not know. Perhaps Bangladesh has become so ungovernable that many entrepreneurs exist besides the state.

 The increasing incidents of illegal-arms trade in Bangladesh and the fact that Indian insurgent groups move around freely in that country, raise many doubts in the Indian mind about the role of Dhaka. Putting pressure on Bangladesh in this context is translated by some to mean applying an economic squeeze .

 It will be a sad day when, say, for example, Dhaka?s attitude to India?s militancy-related concerns becomes a hurdle for the Rs 100 crore humanitarian flood relief from New Delhi. It will be equally disastrous if the hardliners start arguing that India should re-look at water treaties to punish Bangladesh or stop the cattle trade at least this November during Ramadan. The proponents of this line argue that international opprobrium against such measures would be short-lived and that these measures would be seen as part of India?s war against terrorism.

 However, one thing is becoming increasingly clear ? while engaging the North-east militants in a dialogue, pressure must not cease on Dhaka not to let its territory be used for anti-India activities. Bangladesh owes it to India as a good neighbour to do the right thing.

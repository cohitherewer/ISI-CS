 HOW THE MYTH CRUMBLES

This Above All / Khushwant Singh

 In evil hour

 Two myths have been exploded in recent years ? one is that you have to be cast in the heroic role to become a hero; the other is that all people are basically peace-loving. Both were exposed as untrue after reading the strictures passed by our Supreme Court on the Gujarat government presided over by Narendra Modi. Gujarat massacres took a toll of over 2,000 Muslim lives.

 Two-and-half-years ago, who had heard of Qutubuddin Ansari or Zaheera Sheikh or Bilkis Bano? After frenzied mobs descended on them, they were in all our newspapers and journals. Ansari was a poor tailor in Ahmedabad. His tear-stained face with hands joined in prayer, begging for his life to be spared, appeared on front pages. It touched the hearts of millions who felt ashamed that one of their fellow citizens was subjected to such humiliation. Zaheera, still in her twenties, saw her family?s Best Bakery torched and 14 relatives butchered before her eyes. Bilqis Bano, five-months pregnant, was gang-raped while her three-and-a-half-year old daughter was killed along with several of her relations. 

 Zaheera swore that she would not marry till the perpetrators of the crime ? whom she recognized and named ? were adequately punished. However, a few weeks later, when she was escorted to the court by the local MLA of the BJP, she recanted and said that because of the din and the smoke, she could not recognize any of the assailants. She took to wearing a burqa covering her from head to foot and fled to Mumbai. 

 Bano was made of sterner stuff and stuck to her story. The station house officer refused to register her complaint. When she wanted to be medically examined, she was told that the doctor would inject her with poison. When the cases came up for hearing, the public prosecutor acted like a defence counsel. All the accused were acquitted for lack of evidence. To such low depths had fallen the police and judiciary of Gujarat.

 Nothing would have been heard of these atrocities if human rights activists had not prodded the National Human Rights Commission, presided over by the retired chief justice of the Supreme Court, A.S. Anand, to file a petition in the apex court. Besides passing strictures on the Gujarat government, the court ordered the CBI to investigate the cases and trials to be held in Mumbai. The accused have been re-arrested and are under protection of human rights activists. Both Zaheera and Bilqis will now be able to come out with the truth. In the months to come during which men accused of arson, rape and murders will be tried, we will hear a lot about them. Two women, whose identity few people besides their relatives, neighbours, and friends were aware of, will become household names: heroism will be thrust upon them.

 The myth of one community being more peace-loving than others should be treated with derision, as there never has been any substance in it. The myth was blown to smithereens in the nation-wide communal conflict during Partition ? the killings in Calcutta following ?direct action day? called by the Muslim League, massacres of Muslims in Bihar, of Hindus in Noakhali, of Hindus and Sikhs in the North-west Frontier Province and Western Punjab, of Muslims in East Punjab. They made mockery of claims that Hindus were a non-violent people as were the Muslims, that since the word Islam meant peace, they never indulged in wanton violence. We had some experience of how shallow the Hindu claim of being committed to peace was in the killings of Sikhs following the assassination of Mrs Gandhi, and two-and-a-half years ago, of the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat following the torching of the Sabarmati Express at Godhra.

 It is ironic that it should be Gujarat that has become the epicentre of sectarian violence. Bapu Gandhi was born here. After he returned from England as a barrister-at-law, his most important client was a Gujarati Muslim trader who took him to South Africa to sort out his business litigation in that country. It was in South Africa that Gandhi evolved and put into practice his faith in satyagraha (truth force), passive resistance and sarva dharma samabhava or equal respect for all religions. When he returned to India, he set up his ashram on the banks of the Sabarmati, after which the ill-fated Sabarmati Express is named. 

 Gujarat honoured its greatest son by naming its administrative set up Gandhinagar. It is from Gandhinagar that the chief protagonist of Hindutva, L.K. Advani has been elected to parliament more than once. It was from the Somnath temple in Gujarat that Advani launched his rath yatra to Ayodhya, which led to the destruction of the 16th century-Babri Masjid. It nurtured the seeds of communal hatred which led to Hindu-Muslim riots in different parts of our country culminating in the massacre of innocent Muslims of Gujarat. Advani and his supporters should have a lot on their consciences and much to answer to their gods. In their own way, they have exploded the greatest myth that we Indians are peace-loving because we are sons of Bapu Gandhi.

 The wonder that is India

 My friends, this is India, you see,

 Not France, Britain or Germany

Nothing here is blamed on bumbling fools

 And true to form, as bad workmen, 

 we blame our tools.

 When calls to caste and creed

Make people hack each other to death

 Or erstwhile friends curse each 

 other with every breath,

Or when the Bombay market goes up or down, 

 Be sure my friends, ?tis the work of 

 some small time fixer in the town.

When pesky little states insist on changing borders,

 When once peaceful people refuse to 

 obey social orders,

The reason for this mischief you will understand,

 Is the meddling, wayward corrupt 

 politician who has a hand,

Who then can rule this politically blighted land?

 The urbane, suave, gentlemanly 

 Vajpayee and his saffron band, 

 Or the enigmatic Sonia of the 

 vacuous wave and Congress hand.

Either way, where does the Indian voter stand?

 Fearfully perhaps, back to the polls 

 soon we will go,

 For shaky governments never have 

 anything to show.

 For you and me, dear friends, 

 oratory or a meaningless hand wave,

 Means but one thing at the polls ? 

 just another close shave!

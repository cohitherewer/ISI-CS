 GET THE PARTY GOING

 Malvika Singh

 L.K. Advani has taken over the BJP and is threatening to revive its dwindling fortunes. The beaming faces of the leadership ? Naidu, Advani and Vajpayee ? have been removed from the billboards outside the party headquarters. The new hoarding has the lotus and the BJP spelt out in large letters. The earlier bombast seems to be giving way to a more subdued ?campaign?. The new statement appears to be a serious demand for hard work from members of the party. The hype has vanished.

 Advani has always stood by what he believes in and has not hedged his bets like some of his senior colleagues. He is committed to the core ideology of the BJP. The moving away from the ?doublespeak? we were inflicted with is bound to lessen the confusion in the rank and file of the BJP/RSS as well as in the public perception of what the party stands for. This honest approach makes sense. Where are Jaswant Singh, Arun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and suchlike, in the new scheme?

 Feroze Varun Gandhi, according to the newspapers, may soon be chosen the youth leader of the RSS. It does come as a surprise because his father and paternal family were always ideologically and politically opposed to the RSS and the Jan Sangh. He has consciously broken away from the Congress, but then, generational and ideological shifts are known to happen and this is one such instance. 

 The BJP and RSS have maintained that their leadership emerges from commitment to the party and its ideology, starting at the grassroots, which is why one is left baffled by the excitement in the party generated by the entry of a Gandhi into its fold. It is coming across as oneupmanship. It will be interesting to see Feroze Gandhi grow into his role as an RSS leader, in sharp contrast to the political ideology of Feroze Gandhi Sr, Indira and Sanjay Gandhi, his direct family.

 Today, the BJP is, once again, clearly stating its commitment to Hindu nationalism and a common identity. The Congress is committed to the Indian nation with all its diversity. The choices are clear for the people of India. The electoral economic agenda of both are to deliver the infrastructure for this country and encourage entrepreneurship to flourish. Both have neglected the rule of law and its administration, thereby throwing the country into chaos and corruption. Without a radical shakeup in this area, India will never be able to move ahead. We will continue to be exploited ruthlessly by the politician and the administrator.

 Hide the babus

 Even in areas that governments foolishly view as low priority, like tourism, the thoughtless and inexperienced interference with the constant changing of rules and parameters, a huge revenue-generating machine is being destroyed. Today, for some obscure reason, India is seen worldwide as a prime destination. If we are to make this a reality, we will have to get our airports to function in a civilized manner like elsewhere in the world, we will have to clear our great historic sites of pimps and touts. The babu will have to be hidden from view and reprimanded harshly for being officious, unpleasant and slow.

 Last week, in the Ranthambhore Game Park, where entry rules change with each passing day, tourists were denied entry. Having flown in from different parts of the world to see the wildlife of India, they were put through administrative harassment, of a kind that one did not experience even in Soviet Russia. Small wonder that Africa, with its successful wildlife tourism policy, has captured the world market and, more important, its wildlife is multiplying with tourist ?patrols? while ours is fast dwindling at the hands of forest departments, the so-called protectors. We need to be released from backward mind-sets.

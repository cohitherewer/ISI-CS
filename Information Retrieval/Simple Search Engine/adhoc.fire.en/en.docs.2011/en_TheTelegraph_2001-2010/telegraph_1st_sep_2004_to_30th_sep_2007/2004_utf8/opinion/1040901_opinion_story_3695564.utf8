 HOW TO SELL CULTURE

 SHOBITA PUNJA

 The Olympic Games are over, and many in India feel that this large and wonderful country has much to do and miles to go. The 2008 Beijing Olympics is going to be a grand affair the Chinese are very good at showcasing their culture and giving it a contemporary look. They know that their culture sells and brings welcome dollars to their country.

 Our tourism ministry has confessed that visitors to India this year have added Rs 15,000 crore to the Indian coffers. That is no small amount. Where do our (very insignificant) 2 million tourists go during their visit to India? Did they visit any heritage sites? Did they visit our beaches, our beautiful mountains, and how many of them visited temples, palaces and other heritage sites in this huge and ancient nation?

 If the answer were to be known, then the government could decide (on behalf of its citizens) that heritage is worth saving for it will bring in more revenue to India. In this way, the heritage areas and their local economy could benefit from such visits. Then we need to prepare ourselves for this business of tourism. The 15,000 crore needs to be spent judiciously to develop infrastructure around these areas so as not to damage the fabric of the sites, but to enhance it. We need the best of designers and architects to address the question so that the authenticity of the historical site remains the major experience for the visitors. We need to meet the visitors needs and requirements with well designed bathrooms, clean drinking water, good motorable roads not constructed through lowest quotations, but created by the best designers India has.

 We need to find ways of making tourism sustainable, for which we have to evaluate how the natural and cultural resources are being used and to ensure the least damage to our irreplaceable heritage. If the stone staircase up to the Taj Mahal are being worn out by 10, 000 visitors on a weekend, then we need to take some hard decisions. The principle being that in spite of what we earn from tourism, we need to choose the path that least harms our heritage. So national wildlife parks are closed during the monsoons so that the forest can recoup and the animal-breeding season is not disturbed. We may make a little less money, but we have taken stringent steps to ensure that our heritage is not adversely affected in the bargain.

 Live theatre

 There is so much in our heritage that can also be used and re-used to serve the infrastructural needs of the tourist industry. Local vernacular examples of houses can be re-used imaginatively as eateries and restaurants, old buildings that are no longer in use can be converted into charming bookshops and craft-centres. Old buildings that once were famous and much loved in the city can be refurbished to serve local needs without changing the essence and heritage significance of the sites. A good case in point is the restoration of the Star Theatre in Calcutta. This famous and much-loved building, once Calcuttas premier theatre, was built in 1890 by the actor, Girish Chandra Ghosh, who spent all his personal earnings to give Calcutta the gift of a place to keep its theatre traditions alive. 

 Over the last 20 years, the Star Theatre was abandoned and, because of its prime location in the city, became the envy of large developers who wished to demolish it. In 1991, it was consumed by fire, but it rose again like a phoenix from its ashes, when the Calcutta Municipal Corporation decided to restore the site, add new sustainable components and give to the city a theatre complex for art-lovers. The new Star Theatre, with the restored old faade, will have shops and a food plaza that will bring in the revenue to maintain the site, and an art gallery and a state-of-the art auditorium to keep the theatrical arts alive for generations to come.

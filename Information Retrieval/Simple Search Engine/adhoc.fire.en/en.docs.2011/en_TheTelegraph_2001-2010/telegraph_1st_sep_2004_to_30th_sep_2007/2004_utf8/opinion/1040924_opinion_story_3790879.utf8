 FOR A SUCCESSFUL MIX

 Take a closer look

 Is it possible to know what kind of fiction people want to buy or borrow? Given the fact that it is nearly impossible to get one?s hands on reliable information ? and there is no such thing as a definitive bestseller list other than simply a series of approximate guesses compiled by various newspapers on the basis of leading booksellers? lists, how do publishers decide whether a novel by a relatively unknown author would sell? Hit-and-run market research, or commissioning on the basis of hunches and personal contacts, can hardly be relied upon these days. Readers today are a wilful lot who think twice before they part with their cash. 

 Publishers may claim to know the secret but there is no fixed formula for a successful mix. The heady formula of glitz, sex, romance of the Eighties, with some violence thrown in, no longer works as there is far too much amateur competition. A mystery of sorts, like some unsolved historical puzzle ? Dan Brown?s Da Vinci Code or Caldwell and Thomason?s The Rule of Four ? springs to mind. But it has to go a little beyond the usual formula. Since it is impossible to pin down the ingredients, the sensible thing would be to seek out the telling anecdote or surprising example, one which illustrates the larger picture. 

 When this is done, two simple facts stand out. The reader is interested in a work based on facts with a generous dose of imagination. that would carry the story along. We read to be better informed and entertained at the same time. 

 Anchored in historical or contemporary facts, the factual references never weigh too heavily on the reader?s mind or interrupt the flow of the narrative. Amitav Ghosh?s The Hungry Tide based on the Sunderbans comes immediately to mind. If properly researched ? and this includes field studies ? the book has a chance to make it big. 

 Language and style play a crucial role to make the plot sound authentic. Language has to be close to the bone. To make the voice real, Indian authors, writing in English, have to incorporate the language?s colloquial style. G.V. Dasani did it in his classic All About H. Hatterr. He has influenced a lot of young writers, even Salman Rushdie acknowledges that he has learnt a trick or two from him. 

 But language, style and subject matter aren?t enough. The plot matters a great deal to make it to the charts, which roughly boils down to unpredictability or how things work out in the end. The reader must keep moving on just to know ?what happens next?, he should be kept guessing and be unable to anticipate the next move. 

 Put all these factors together and one concludes that a bestseller is nothing except a philosophy expressed in images. No philosophy, and what you get is a couple of editions. A bestseller is the one that lasts and needs a few more reprints than the rest.

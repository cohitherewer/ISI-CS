 Letters to Editor

 Who spoils for a fight?

 Sir Governors seem to be the favourite whipping boys of politicians. After the fracas involving the removal of the governors in four states, it is now the turn of T.V. Rajeswar Rao, governor of Uttar Pradesh, to face Mulayam Singh Yadavs ire (Mulayam spoils for varsity fight, Sept 2). But Mulayams criticisms of Rao, for consulting Delhi and favouring the reintroduction of English in the curriculum, are way off the mark. Rao has every right to consult the Centre, especially on contentious issues in this case, a Muslim minister was to be appointed as pro-chancellor of a university for life. Moreover, his views on English are not irrelevant. More than any other language, English has the potential to help students pursue higher studies and get jobs. Mulayams description of this as an affront to Hindi proves that he is a politician who panders to narrow, sectarian interests.

 Yours faithfully,

 Mohammed Arif, Calcutta

 Equally guilty

 Sir The strained relations between the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, have been exposed once again in the Avtar Singh arrest episode (Potshots at police again, Aug 29). A similar spat had occurred between the two when some criminals had been arrested from the Yuba Bharati Krirangan guest house in Salt Lake three years back. This time, Chakraborty has made no bones about police excesses. Perhaps, for this self-proclaimed Marxist, running a flesh trade in a hotel, constructed illegally on a wetland and without a valid license, is a lesser evil than police high-handedness. 

 Chakraborty has alleged that the police arrested Avtar after they failed to nab the notorious criminal, Hathkata Dilip. But the truth is that the police found eight couples from different rooms during the raid on Merlin Park, making it obvious that the owner, Avtar, was running a sleaze racket from the premises. It is a known fact that whenever miscreants close to the minister are arrested, Chakraborty unlike other politicians, seldom denies his association with the accused and comes to their rescue. Hence the allegations against Avtar have had no bearings on him.

 This may not surprise the people. But what is worrying is the ministers brazen attempts to shield Avtar by accusing not only the police, but also the government, of which he himself is a minister, of committing excesses. On the grounds of accountability and credibility, two things Bhattacharjee is very particular about, Chakraborty ought to vacate his chair, while a probe is ordered against him? 

 Yours faithfully,

Tridib Roy, Calcutta

 Sir Avtar Singhs arrest was in retaliation to the recent arrest of a Trinamool Congress leader from a resort on Diamond Harbour Road. Such raids are mostly eyewash, or at best, sponsored by political opponents. A hotel constructed on a water body and run without a proper licence speak of failures of the civil authorities and law enforcers; and the law, like the chief minister said, will take its own course. But why were the people inside the hotel arrested? If consenting adults have sex behind closed doors, it should not be the lookout of either the state or the society, especially of the law enforcers. No one has appointed them to be moral guardians of people who want to have some harmless fun.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Avtar Singh has been arrested by the police, and the judges will hear the case in due course and give their verdict. So far so good. But why was Avtars house and car attacked by protestors?(Vice heat on house, Aug 18) Ironically, the media has also publicized the incident in a manner which made it seem that such forms of protests are acceptable. Those who carried out the attack on Avtars properties should be arrested and given exemplary punishment. The media should also refrain from glorifying such acts of vandalism.

 Sir The allegations of police high-handedness by the state transport minister only go to prove his own close ties with criminals. In spite of a government ban against the sale of alcohol on Independence Day, drinks were sold freely in Avtars hotel on August 15. This, apart from the allegations of flesh trade, is a punishable offence. However, Chakraborty doesnt seem to understand this. Moreover, how can the minister equate Avtars arrest with that of his own along with Jyoti Basu during the Naxal era? That was a political incident. There is no way in which one can compare it with the present incident in which a former athlete has been arrested for running a sleaze racket from his own hotel.

 Sir The involvement of sportsmen like Avtar Singh in such a filthy business is a matter of shame. According to Anil Biswas, state secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, as a member of the CPI(M) is answerable to the party, but not for anything her husband may have done. But if the charges against her husband are true operating a sleaze racket and using his wifes position to influence the administration she cannot deny her own responsibility in this matter. Moreover, the truth behind the Merlin Park Hotel episode may never be known as the probe panel set up by the CPI(M) would take every step to save the party from the blushes.

 Yours faithfully,

Srabani Sarkar, Dinajpur

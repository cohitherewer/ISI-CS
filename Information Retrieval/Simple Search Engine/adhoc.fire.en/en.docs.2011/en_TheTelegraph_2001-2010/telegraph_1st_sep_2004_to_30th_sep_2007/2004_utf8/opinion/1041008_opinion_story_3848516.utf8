 A WORLD OF INFORMATION

 Virtual presence 

 Many scholars are posting their research papers and studies on-line. This is not simply because they get a worldwide audience but because publishers have rejected them or have such a long lead time before publication that the authors would rather go it alone before their work becomes dated. So, in printed books, you now have three sets of acknowledgements ? original sources, secondary sources and published articles in journals and websites.

 Scholars who had feared that websites would not add significantly to their CV need not fear ? they are accepted, provided they have had an X-number of ?hits? on the net. Incidentally, the same criterion goes for the countless PhDs that are published ? mere publication is not enough. 

 So, shouldn?t online publications be accepted within the larger family of books? If you accept them ? you have to in the internet age ? how do you go about accessing research papers on the net? With the advances in information technology, it has become quite simple. Go to any of the search engines ? Google, Yahoo or others. Punch in what you are searching for and various sites open up. Then pick and choose; links within the sites lead you on to more.

 The real problem with the search is not whether you will get the information you are looking for but that there will be too much of it. To get around the problem quickly, the researcher has to frame the question precisely and stick to the essentials of what is required. In other words, research methodology has to be fine-tuned if the researcher is not to lose himself in the jungle of information.

 But this goes for sites that are posted free on the net. For more specialized information, there are ?paid-for? sites which can be accessed on payment of an annual fee. A password is given and you enter the archives only when it is punched in. For instance, if you want to access the archives of the New York Review of Books or The Economist you need to pay an annual fee or subscribe to the print edition. Much the same goes for specialized institutional libraries.

 It?s simple once you know the ropes or have the money for subscriptions or for downloading articles. (Usually only extracts are given and if you want the full article, some payment has to made, mostly through the credit card.)

 If you are still stuck, there is a new crop of library assistants to help out ? these are ?knowledge workers? (like ?fact-checkers? in editorial offices) who are trained to make their way through the information highway. Any information that you may require is accessible ? provided it is not highly classified, in which case it wouldn?t be posted. But what is surprising is how much information is available on tap, including on defence and strategic matters.

 Expectedly, there is a fair amount of sheer bumph but there is some solid material too, especially that posted by leading scholars in various fields. But how good or relevant it is, is for the researcher to decide. The information is there, take it or leave it.

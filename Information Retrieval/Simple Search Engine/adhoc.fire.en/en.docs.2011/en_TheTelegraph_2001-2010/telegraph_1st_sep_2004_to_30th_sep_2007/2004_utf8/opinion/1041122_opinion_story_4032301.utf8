 KEY TO HOPE

 A gesture is symbolic on many levels. By freeing the Kangla Fort of occupation by the Assam Rifles, the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, has, first and foremost, fulfilled a demand of the Manipuri people. Beyond this gesture, there is the symbolic assurance of a change of attitude in New Delhi, that is, a desire to respond to Manipuri aspirations instead of the traditional apathy. The assurance is symbolic, but the ?handing over? of the fort to the Manipuri people does have strong emotional impact. The fort is central to the people?s history, the state?s royal heritage and its struggle for freedom against foreign invasion. Its ?dispossession? is deeply tied up with the Manipuris? sense of dignity and pride. The message of ?restoration? matched exactly the prime minister?s promise to the state?s people, of justice and peace and belonging. He also laid the foundation stone for the extension of the Jiribam-Tupul railway track, emphasizing the importance of linking the state capital more easily to Delhi and the rest of the country.

 All these, together with the bestowing of Manipur University with Central university status, were important first steps, but also comparatively easier ones. The similarities with Mr Singh?s Kashmir visit are too striking to be missed. Imphal was shut down by the Revolutionary People?s Front on the day of his visit. A few days earlier, suspected militants had abducted three government engineers, while a grenade-burst near Kangla Fort had injured sixteen people about a week ago. Yet the knottiest issue that faces the United Progressive Alliance government today is the Manipur people?s demand of the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. Mr Singh has constituted a committee to study the act, either to modify it or to replace it with a more ?humane? law. But, ask members of the Apunba Lup, an umbrella organization at the head of the campaign against AFSPA, what took the prime minister so long? Mr Singh, on his side, is not willing to accept the Apunba Lup?s ?deadline? for a decision, even if he has been unconventional enough to include a social activist for the region in the committee. Another issue is the inquiry into Thangjam Manorama?s death, allegedly at the hands of Assam Rifles men. The follow-up on these issues will ultimately determine whether Mr Singh is being able to change the course of New Delhi?s relations with Manipur.

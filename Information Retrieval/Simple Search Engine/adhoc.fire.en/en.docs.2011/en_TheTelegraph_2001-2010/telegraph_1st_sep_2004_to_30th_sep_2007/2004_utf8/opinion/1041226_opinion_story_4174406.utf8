 TOO WARM FOR CHRISTMAS

 Calcutta has never had the good fortune of even dreaming of a white Christmas. The propinquity of the Tropic of Cancer makes snow in Calcutta beyond the realms of possibility. Despite this, Christmas in Calcutta has never been associated with perspiration. Traditionally, burra din in Calcutta meant a nip in the air made bearable by a mellow sunshine. After sunset, a light jacket and a couple of chhota pegs made for comfort and cosiness. This year things have been startlingly different. There is no sign of winter. Even early mornings and late nights are not cold by any stretch of the imagination. Woollens still remain wrapped in mothballs. In clubs, where the dress code is in place, gentlemen look visibly uncomfortable in their ties and jackets. There is no convincing explanation for this state of affairs. Weathermen speak of some low-pressure trough which is blocking the cold wind from coming in from north India. This does not explain why there should be a low pressure phenomenon in West Bengal at this time of the year. Prophets of doom see in the abnormal weather signs of the global warming, which is supposed to melt the ice cap in the South Pole, raise water levels in the Indian Ocean and thus flood the low-lying areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. Others see in the changed climate the play of El Nino.

 The vagaries of climate have not succeeded in dampening the spirit of Yuletide in Calcutta. Christmas in Calcutta has always been special, perhaps because Calcutta is quintessentially a product of the Indo-British encounter. Christmas has been transformed here into burra din, a festival in which Christian and heathen, Britons and Indians, the rich and the poor come together to carry forward the message of peace and goodwill, not to speak of merrymaking. Some of the graciousness of an earlier era has disappeared but the city is suddenly lit up for a few days to usher in Christmas and the New Year. This year too men, women and children were out to enjoy the spirit of Christmas even though the weather played spoilsport. For believers, the night may have been holy but it was by no means silent.

 Festivals and the weather are inexplicably and inextricably associated. The Durga Puja brings to mind blue skies, and Christmas, a cold day with a breeze and beautiful sunshine. But uncertainties of the weather have brought, in recent memory, heavy showers during Durga Puja; and this year?s Christmas celebrations have been somewhat incomplete because of the absence of the chill factor. The incompleteness could not take away from Calcutta?s celebratory mood. The people enjoyed themselves even as the traditional cold failed to appear.

 THE OUTSIDER

 India?s first prime minister was born great and his daughter achieved greatness, but P.V. Narasimha Rao, who died yesterday, had greatness thrust upon him as prime minister. He was pitchforked into the prime ministership because of the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. When Rao took over the reins of power, very few people envied him and even fewer expected him to deliver. India was on the brink of bankruptcy. The chess board of international relations was changing fast with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism. In the emerging context, India?s ship of state appeared to be rudderless. Internally, the morale of the Congress party was low with Rajiv Gandhi dead and the smoke from the Bofors gun polluting the air. The principal enemy of the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party, appeared to be on the crest of a popular Hindu wave. Under these circumstances, and as the head of a government that had a razor-thin majority in the Lok Sabha, all the chips seemed to be loaded against Rao. But with Kautilyan shrewdness, Rao began the process of putting together the bits and pieces to forge an effective and credible government.

 There are two spheres on which Rao left his indelible and enduring mark. One was the economy and the other was foreign policy. Rao realized that the Indian economy could not be sustained if it remained tied to the old socialist policies. He decided to open up the economy. He initiated a policy of liberalization and globalization which was carried through by his finance minister, Mr Manmohan Singh. Without fanfare and in the teeth of considerable opposition within the Congress, Rao dismantled the socialist scaffolding of the Indian economy. By 1993-94, it was clear that the Indian economy had entered a new era dominated by private enterprise. This achievement was possible because of the loss of credibility suffered by the project of socialist planning and the pressure brought upon Rao?s government by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But Rao had the political will to pioneer economic reforms and to put the Indian economy on a radically different track. Rao?s other achievement was to turn the prow of the ship of state away from Moscow and to make it face Washington. He also perceived the importance of Asean for India?s political and economic aspirations. Even today, India?s economic and foreign policies function within the broad framework created by Rao.

 His political skill lay in making radical changes appear as a continuation of old policies. He was a self-proclaimed Nehruvian who broke with the tenets of Jawaharlal Nehru. In his roman-?-clef, Rao described himself as the insider; he was actually the outsider in Congress politics. His days in political wilderness testify to this.

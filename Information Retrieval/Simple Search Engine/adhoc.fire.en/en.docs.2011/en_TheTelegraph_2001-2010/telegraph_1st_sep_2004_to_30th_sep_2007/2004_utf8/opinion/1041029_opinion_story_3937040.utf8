 CHIEF CONCERN

 Running in the same place seems to be a very satisfying activity. Or so the smiling faces of Congress and Nationalist Congress Party leaders in Maharashtra would suggest. Eleven days of playing at ?can?t budge me? has resulted in a fairly close repetition of the earlier arrangement of governance in the state, with a possibility that Mr Sushil Kumar Shinde, the former chief minister, might come back to his chair. But the Congress is in no hurry to name names at this point. It is happy to have kept the chief minister?s chair, in a reversal of the 1999 principle, when the earlier Congress-NCP alliance government was formed with the chief minister coming from the largest single party. The arguments the Congress offered against the NCP?s insistence that it take the chief minister?s chair since it had given the legislative assembly two more members than has the Congress, were strange enough. The mandate, which completely cut off the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, was for the coalition as a whole, led by a Congress chief minister. This belief, reportedly emanating from the Congress president herself, has triumphed. No doubt it is difficult for the Congress to ask Mr Shinde to walk off after having led the coalition to a thumping victory. 

 The NCP seems to have blinked a little too hard after the eleven long days. It does have two more cabinet ministers and a minister of state, two portfolios that the Congress held and the deputy chief minister?s chair, but it has not got the portfolios it wanted. Perhaps rumours that the NCP is to gain something in the Centre in return may have something in them. But the spectacle of the tug-of-war did no one any good; it looked particularly shoddy on the Congress?s part. The party leading the coalition at the Centre looks rather less than dignified squabbling over a chief minister?s chair for close to a fortnight. A show of confidence would have worked better.

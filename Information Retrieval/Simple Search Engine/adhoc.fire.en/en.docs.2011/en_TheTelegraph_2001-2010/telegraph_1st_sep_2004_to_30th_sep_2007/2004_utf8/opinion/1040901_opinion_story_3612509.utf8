 AFTER THE DEED IS DONE

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 You enter the state housing registration offices through the gate marked exit, and leave through enter. And thats only the beginning

 Buying a flat is like running long-distance hurdles. One has to find (and like) a property, engage in lengthy bargaining with the realtor, and then run to a bank for help with money. But all this pales into insignificance when one confronts the final hurdle the registration of the flat.

 A morning in August found the three of us my mother, my sister and I making a brave attempt to accomplish this very deed. There had been a let up in the overnight rains and the car made its way through the slushy streets in rush-hour traffic. We had picked up the realtor on our way. He, probably like other realtors, wore three gold chains, ate lunch from an aluminium dabba and smiled only after the buyer had put his pen on the dotted line. The car swerved right near the high court, and we entered the West Bengal Housing Registration building. I noticed that everyone used the Exit gate to enter the premises and walked out through the gate with Enter written on it in bold, black letters. 

 The sight which greeted us inside was surreal. Three decrepit buildings formed a close ring around a dry fountain painted a garish pink. Lawyers in short black robes and long white trousers scurried about, carrying dusty old files. One unfortunate fellow, who seemed to be in a tearing hurry, tripped on the length of his own trouser. On the staircase we were accosted by one of his kind. Without a word or even a look, he made us sign on three different sets of papers and melted back, spirit-like, into the crowd. For a moment, I thought of checking if his toes were pointed backwards.

 Soon, we found ourselves in a small room where the registration officer sat. There was more darkness than light inside, more files than computers and more mayhem than order. Nothing was a mouse-click away anywhere, I thought. The entire ambience was inimical to any kind of work. 

 We were jostled from one corner to another, drifting between conversations that covered a range of emotions the disappointment of failure (Apnar aajke hobe na dada, ek mash pore ashben) to the elation of success (Boudi, aar chinta nei, kaaj hoye gechhey). When our turn came, we found ourselves facing the registration officer a small, sweaty man with beady eyes. He started by asking us our names. On hearing mine, he remarked, Amra ki shotto juge phire gelam naki? I thought it brave of him to crack a bad joke in front of a sea of unfriendly faces. Then he proceeded to ask us about the flats technical details, to which (in spite of the realtors coaching class held earlier) we gave all the wrong answers. Exasperated with the heat, we were past caring about complicated details. So was he, I guess.

 After that, it was time to fill more forms. Except that this time, we were required to put our fingerprints all ten on paper, three times over. The impression of my right ring-finger looked suspiciously similar to my sisters. But the man at the desk didnt seem to mind.

 We were then told that our ordeal was over. The three of us trooped out with jubilant faces and inky fingers only to discover that we had to report back to the same place to solve yet another puzzle called mutation.

 OUR LIVES, OUR STORIES

 Lonely and strong

Moving on 

By Shashi Deshpande, Viking, Rs 450

Shashi Deshpande?s new novel has several themes. Foremost 

among them is that of writing itself. The novel begins with a man sitting down 

to write and wondering how to begin. In the next chapter, we have his daughter, 

Manjari, sitting down to tell us her story. She starts, after the death of her 

orthopaedist father, by talking about her problem of not knowing what to do with 

the piles of Marathi magazines that carry the stories written by her mother. 

Although Manjari is the narrator of the story, she is not a writer. She is a scribe of sorts, typing out manuscripts for others. She is also a reader herself within the story, as she reads her father?s diary, revisits her mother?s stories, and discovers the hidden curves of their lives. Close to forty, she is alone ? her children are away, her husband died years ago, her parents are dead ? and lives in the house where her father died. She has a lodger who travels frequently. 

 But a woman, living alone, is rarely permitted to live independently. So she begins to be visited by men who want her to sell the property. Stubbornly, she decides to stay and fight, learns to drive a car, and wonders if she can drive it as a taxi. She learns to use a computer and decides to type manuscripts.

 Moving On is Manjari?s voice ? that of a typical middle class woman, often rushed into a marriage and often living in small houses on roads that smell of shit. Yet Manjari is fearless, wanting to fight and live on in her father?s house on her own terms. It is about the courage and forbearance of an ordinary person trying to live according to her principles, and her belief in the strength of goodness. 

 This is also the story of families ? those into which we are born, and those from which we escape into the ?real world outside?, only to return to its demanding embrace when we are older and, perhaps, wiser. 

 Moving On is also the story of the body, its secrets and relentless demands, and the ways in which it lives on, after death, in successive generations.

 This is about the whispers of the underworld that thrives in the cities around us, grabbing property, terrorizing people. It is also about the over-world of people called RK and BK, of two-wheelers and scrabble games, and the ordinary person?s fear of the State, the police machinery and its ways. When the police inspector assures Manjari that they will eventually find her lodger, she hopes fervently that they don?t. ?I hope you never do get your hands on him,? she thinks.

 The book also explores the act of writing, and the ways in which words can mean different things. Manjari talks of a time when RK had gone to Potsdam (when it was still East Germany), and how he saw a palace named Sans Souci (?Without Grief?), built by a melancholy king. The words were written with a comma between Sans and Souci: ?Was it then ?Out Grief?, as Shakespeare might have put it? Or was the comma a kind of superstitious pause, as if the king was afraid of spelling out his wish too clearly...??

 But most of all, the book tells us the story of ordinary people like us ? middle class, working people, working also at life, trying to retain relationships and friendships, and their sense of identity. It is a novel about the way we were, and the way we are today. But it also finds a way to connect to our deepest losses.

 However, even after all the heart-wrenching grief, there?s something left in this deeply moving book. A hope. ?There?s at least this left among the ruins: I never regretted anything.?

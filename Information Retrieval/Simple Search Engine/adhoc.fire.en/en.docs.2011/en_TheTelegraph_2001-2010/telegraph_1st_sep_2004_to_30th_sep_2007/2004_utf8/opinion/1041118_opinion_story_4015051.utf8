 TIME FOR PEACE

 It seems to be a time of new peace initiatives in the North-east. The prime minister?s promise to open peace talks with the United Liberation Front of Asom adds to this air of optimism. That Mr Manmohan Singh conveyed his message of peace to the well-known Assamese writer, Ms Indira Goswami, has its own significance. It suggests that New Delhi can be responsive to any peace overtures even before these come directly from the militants themselves. Mr Singh had recently sent out a similar signal on Manipur. Ms Goswami?s meeting with the prime minister also happened at an important time for peace moves in the region. The ceasefire by the other major militant group in Assam, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, has set the stage for the state government?s peace negotiations with it. A section of the National Liberation Front of Tripura has also offered to talk to the Centre and the state government. Mr Singh?s response to Ms Goswami?s message of peace should now encourage ULFA to talk directly to New Delhi and Dispur. The rebel leaders should read the signals from the authorities right and seize this moment of hope. They owe it to the people of Assam, in whose name they have been waging their secessionist battle for nearly 25 years. 

 There would be hurdles on the way, though. The ULFA has been fighting for a ?sovereign? Assam and has always wanted peace negotiations to be held in a ?third? country. Both New Delhi and Dispur have often suspected the conditions to be a ploy to avoid peace overtures. That such conditions need not necessarily be a stumbling block has been proved by the Naga peace talks. The Naga rebels, too, had talked of the same conditions before they sat at the negotiating table. The ULFA?s complaint that no previous government cared to talk to them may not be entirely true. On the other hand, leaders of the group seemed to have different opinions on talking to the government. If it is serious about starting a peace process, ULFA needs to show some positive signs. The first step could be the declaration of a ceasefire, as the NDFB has done. Ms Goswami?s note to the prime minister, which mentions the killing of about 5,000 people due to the insurgency, gives a measure of the Assamese tragedy. But the success of any peace agenda will depend on the rebels accepting the futility of this endless blood-letting.

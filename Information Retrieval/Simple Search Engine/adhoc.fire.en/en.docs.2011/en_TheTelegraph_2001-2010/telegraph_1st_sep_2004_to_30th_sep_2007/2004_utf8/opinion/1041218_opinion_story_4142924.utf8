 WORD

 AND

 ACTION

 He?s translated A Suitable Boy into Hindi and has an impressive bloodline. But governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi would rather be known as the bridge between state and Centre 

 Significant Others

 West Bengal governors with a mission: 

 Viren J. Shah: Renovated the Raj Bhavan and 

 organised training for its staff

 Padmaja Naidu: Went about reading poems by 

 her mother Sarojini Naidu to raise funds during the 

 Chinese 

 attack

 Dharma Vira: The former ICS officer took it 

 upon himself to help clean up bureaucracy.

 A brown, grimy, teak board hanging on a wall in the southwest wing of the Raj Bhavan bears the names of all governors of West Bengal since 1947. Chakravarti Rajagopalachari is at the top of the long list. Right at the bottom ? so far, that is ? is Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Rajaji?s grandson.

 ?It?s a great honour,? Gopal Gandhi, the newly-appointed governor of West Bengal, says at the Raj Bhavan ? the imposing relic of the Raj in the heart of Calcutta. But the thought that his maternal grandfather once occupied the chair he is enthroned in only ?enhances? his ?sense of responsibility?, he says, with a self-effacing smile.

 It?s not easy, though, to be the grandson of two great thinkers, Rajagopalachari and Mahatma Gandhi, the latter being his grandfather from his father?s side. But Gopalkrishna Gandhi, a bureaucrat-turned-envoy-turned-governor, has always carried the burden of expectations on his lean shoulders with remarkable ease and elan.

 Given a choice, Gandhi, Bengal?s youngest governor at 59, would rather be known for what he is and not for his lineage. He has, in fact, barred his aides from mentioning it in his CV. There is, after all, a lot else to talk about, for his track record is impressive ? as an administrative officer and a diplomat.

 His aides marvel at the stark difference between him and his predecessor, industrialist Viren J. Shah. If Shah, short and stocky, was dashing, bordering on the flamboyant, Gandhi, tall and lean, is quiet and unassuming. And, if there is one thing that he hates, it?s talking about himself.

 Ask him about the novel he wrote or the play he penned, the former Stephanian, with a Masters in English literature, will gently remind you not to describe him as a ?novelist or a playwright because writing one novel or play makes you neither?. Nor would he like being called a translator because he turned Vikram Seth?s A Suitable Boy into Hindi. He is, nonetheless, happy that Seth was ?quite pleased? with the translation, the idea of which was born during a conversation he had with the author in London two years before the book was published in Hindi in 1998.

 But he acknowledges that he has a love for words and that he would have been a journalist today if Rajaji had not willed otherwise. ?My maternal grandfather had suggested that I try for the Indian Administrative Service, saying that I must feel, experience and understand my country before I tried to write about it,? Gandhi says in his first interview as governor. He cleared the exams in 1968 and moved to Tamil Nadu, his cadre. 

 Twenty-four years later, he felt he had ?enough experience of the country? and could now try and do something different without ?jeopardising? his retirement benefits. Shortly after he took voluntary retirement in 1992, he was appointed director of the Nehru Centre in London. That was just the beginning of his diplomatic career. The next 12 years would see him as India?s high commissioner in South Africa and Sri Lanka and finally ambassador in Norway.

 Gandhi is clearly not one to believe that the post of governor has outlived its usefulness. In a country as diverse as India, he feels the need for ?a bridge? between the state and Centre. ?There are elected representatives of the people, but the governor plays an important part in maintaining the national perspective in a state,? he says.

 But at the same time, he has no illusions about the post either. Try though he will to be ?different,? he says he might end up being another ?decorative? governor. But he is, nevertheless, keen to travel, meet people, understand their problems and the issues without ?interfering? in the work of the administration. After all, during his long tenure as an IAS officer ? which included stints as secretaries to former Presidents R. Venkatraman and K.R. Narayanan ? he had learnt to ?place the public judgement? above his own.

 And he is determined to remain humane and humble, as he has always been. Trudging down the corridor of power in India and elsewhere, he realised time and again the ?folly of arrogance?.

 He will, for instance, never forget the lift ? as he puts it ? on President Nelson Mandela?s aircraft when he was the envoy in South Africa in the mid 1990s. As the plane touched down, he saw Mandela pick up a blanket he had wrapped himself in on the flight, dust it, fold it ? ?once, twice and thrice? ? and then hand it to the stewardess like a Christmas gift.

 ?Here was a man, who was a Nobel laureate, President of a country and a hero of our time, but the way he showed respect to the stewardess was unbelievable,? he says. What made it more poignant was that the stewardess was a white woman.

 In West Bengal, don?t be surprised if you find Gopalkrishna Gandhi folding his own blankets, metaphorically speaking.

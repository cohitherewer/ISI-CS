 CHANGE THE RULES OF THE GAME

 Unless the obscurantist Press Note 18 is scrapped, foreign investors will continue to see the government as being partisan, writes Jayanthi Iyengar

 On the move

 The prime minister?s visit to the United States of America is over. The much-awaited announcements on either the dilution of the provisions of the anachronistic Press Note 18, or its total withdrawal, have not taken place. For the Manmohan Singh government, this can only mean sacrificed opportunities at the altar of coalition politics, since senior bureaucrats and advisers had gone to great lengths to informally brief the media about such an announcement being in the offing during the visit.

 What is Press Note 18? The Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which oversees foreign investment policies, grants approvals and regulates foreign investments, is a department of the government. New Delhi?s foreign investment policy is not backed by any statute, but is regulated through departmental circulars. The contentious note is the 18th press note issued by the department of industrial policy and planning of the industry ministry on December 14, 1998. 

 It states that companies which have or which have had any previous joint-venture or technology transfer or trademark agreement in the same or allied field in India, cannot seek clearance for their foreign investment proposals using the automatic approval route. Instead, they would have to seek case-by-case clearance from the FIPB. Further, the technology investor would also have to satisfy the FIPB that the new proposal would not, in any way, jeopardize the interests of the existing joint-venture, or technology or trademark partner, or other stakeholders.

 This means that in order to ?satisfy? the FIPB, a foreign joint-venture partner has to obtain a ?no-objection? certificate from his existing joint-venture partner if he wants to exit from the partnership and start a competing unit. In many cases, the Indian partners do not want to grant this certificate. As a result, many foreign companies are stuck in uncomfortable alliances, where their joint-venture partners neither allow them to opt out nor to grow separately.

 Many in India today argue that the Chinese have similar and more stringent rules and yet foreign investments continue to pour in. The Chinese are in no way defensive about the unfair treatment being meted out to foreigners. But there is a fine difference here. The Chinese, like Indians, opted for the joint-venture route to invite foreign investment. The basic logic was that this would aid transfer of technology and create hitherto unknown skill-sets based on international best practices. The latter has rarely happened since the owners of technology, who have invested heavily to develop it, are rarely willing to transfer it to their joint-venture partners in lieu of being allowed to operate in a foreign country.

 Interestingly, the Chinese, who have more leftists to convince at home than Indians can ever dream of, have stuck to their guns. Entry is still largely by the joint-venture route, subject to minimum capital requirements ?which India would not even dare to impose for fear of losing even the handful of foreign investors it has. However, the Chinese have created an enabling environment, because of which every time Greenspan decided to cut interest rates during the last two years, capital flew straight from Washington DC to Beijing.

 The Indian story is different. Though India started by saying that it wanted foreign capital only through the joint-venture route, that too in the infrastructure and other capital-shy sectors, it ended up relenting gradually, because there were few takers for the great Indian miracle at that time. Today, if one reviews the 13-year-old foreign direct investment policy in the country, one would find that it was more keen on delivering an unpalatable medicine to people in small doses than opening up the market on the basis of some predetermined national goals. Thus we find in India early FDI investors who came in with a 26 per cent stake, then enhanced it to 51 per cent, then 74 per cent and finally to 100 per cent, when the policy was gradually eased in their respective sectors. There are also companies which came in later and entered as wholly- owned subsidiaries (that is 100 percent foreign ownership) of their parents. Then there is the third category of companies which came in as joint-ventures only because the policy demanded this of them at that time of their entry.

 What is significant about Press Note 18 is that it came into force nearly eight years after the announcement of the new industrial policy of 1991, which dismantled the licence-permit raj and spelled the death-knell of state planning as the chosen tool for development. What is even more interesting is that Press Note 18 was inserted in foreign investment policy norms not in 1991 at the time of opening up, but in 1998, long after the Bombay Club members ? comprising industry stalwarts like Rahul Bajaj ? had stopped demanding protection in the name of a level-playing field. 

 A decade later, the new generation which has taken over the reins of the Indian family businesses from the forefathers of the Bombay Club, as well as the new generation entrepreneurs who are running new companies, no longer worry about the foreign threat and demand protection. With the development of companies like Bharat Forge and brands like Indica, it is clear today that Indian industry has come of its own and is no longer afraid of competition. The government does not have to play the benign and biased goal-keeper.

 So what stops the government from withdrawing Press Note 18, if it has outlived its utility? Political fallout, of course. There is also the fear of being perceived as being pro-foreign investment and industry, and the concern about how Indian companies, which may have spent time and money in developing the joint-venture brand, should be compensated. After all, it is not always that Indian promoters blackmail the foreign joint-venture partners, as is now being claimed by the government pointsmen. In fact, there are several instances where the foreign partners have tried to ease out the Indian partner once the former?s interests relating to entry and acceptability have been served.

 For the government, a way out of this impasse may lie in offering a one-time option to foreign partners ? who were forced to come in through the joint-venture route because of policy requirements ? to exit from existing alliances at the end of a sunset period. This period could be five years. The FIPB could even propose a standard exit price to be paid by the foreign partner ? say as a percentage of the profits ? as one time concession to this set of companies.

 Such an approach would allow the Indian partners to plan their own future investment strategies during the sunset period when the old law is phased out and a new one comes into force. This exit option would apply only to foreign companies which came in as joint-ventures because of policy, and had to remain so because of Press Note 18, though the investment caps in their sectors had been relaxed. Other foreign companies which chose to come in as joint-ventures despite being offered the option of going it alone, would be required to slug it out in courts ? the way disputes between joint-venture partners should be resolved, if amicable solutions are not possible.

 The main advantage of this approach is that Indian industry would have the time to prepare for the eventuality of running an independent operation. Foreign investors would get the message that the Indian government, though committed to safeguarding the interests of domestic industry upto a reasonable level, would also take care of their interests during a crunch.

 Currently, there are reports of the FIPB permitting foreign partners to exit in certain cases even when no objection certificate has been furnished. In the case of RKKR Infotech?s dispute with Honeywell, FIPB reportedly turned down the plea for intervention from the domestic partner on the ground that the joint-venture was set up prior to the issue of Press Note 18 in 1998. 

 However, these are not solutions. Though logical, they are merely contingency measures. The government must bell this troublesome cat. Otherwise, it would be unnecessarily carrying the burden of being protectionist and partisan, when such an approach is outdated and unnecessary.

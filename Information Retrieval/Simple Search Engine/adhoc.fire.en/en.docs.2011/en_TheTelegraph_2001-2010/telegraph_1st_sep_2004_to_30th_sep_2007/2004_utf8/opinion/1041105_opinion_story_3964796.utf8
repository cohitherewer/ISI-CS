 FORGED FRIENDSHIPS

THE LAMBS OF LONDON

By Peter Ackroyd, 

Chatto amp; Windus, pound; 9.75

Fakes, forgeries, literary lives and London are evidently 

the abiding interests of Peter Ackroyd?s life. Whether by a stroke of luck or 

by clever sleuthing, he has worked out a happy ? or not-so-happy ? convergence 

of the four in The Lambs of London.

 The Lambs are the brother and sister duo, Charles and Mary. Charles works at the Dividend Office of the East India House on Leadenhall Street, frequents the Salutation and Cat pub, exchanges literary notes with his sister when he returns home sober, and contributes essays to journals like Westminster Words. Mary, a portrayal no doubt influenced by Woolf?s ?Shakespeare?s sister?, finds the company of a hostile mother, senile father and infirm maidservant deeply claustrophobic, seeking solace in reading and her brother?s company.

 But this book turns out to be not the story of the Lambs after all. For what starts out as a docile sub-plot gradually devours the Lamb family-saga, assigning the Lambs smaller roles in the larger drama. And this is the story of William Henry Ireland, the seventeen-year-old son of a bookseller. Ireland features in the history of English literature as the man who claimed to have discovered, and later confessed to having forged, a set of Shakespearean manuscripts. The ?papers? included a new play, Vortigern, and a billet-doux to Anne Hathaway with a lock of hair attached. 

 In Ackroyd?s account, Ireland plans the fabrications first as an innocent surprise for his Shakespeare-worshipping father, Samuel. With his literary ambitions, Samuel cannot resist using the papers to earn instant fame. When the Shakespeare scholar, Edmund Malone, verifies their authenticity, William is encouraged, resenting all the while that his father should become famous riding on his hard work. From here follows the ?discovery? of Vortigern, Shakespeare?s unstaged play about an English king. 

 The lives of the Lambs get entwined with the Irelands? when Charles buys a book from the Irelands? bookshop, to deliver which William Ireland pays a visit to the Lambs? house on Laystall Street. A friendship is struck between Mary and William, catalysed by their mutual love for Shakespeare. But Mary?s feelings run deeper, though hardly reciprocated by William, excited as he is with the wonders of his pen. The seeds of a romance are buried when Mary overhears William confessing the forgery to his father. She comes back home, and, in a fit of madness, kills her mother.

 This is not the greatest literary thriller ever told. But as a tale of two lives brought to ruins by familial oppression, it does succeed. And 18th-century London has seldom been brought to life in such loving detail.

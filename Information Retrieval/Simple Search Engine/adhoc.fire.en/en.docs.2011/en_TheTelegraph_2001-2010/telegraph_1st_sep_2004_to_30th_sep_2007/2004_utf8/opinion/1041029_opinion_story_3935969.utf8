 GAZA FIRST

 It takes a great deal of disorientation to think of Mr Ariel Sharon as the harbinger of peace. But his evident determination to start the withdrawal of Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip forces the world to do precisely this. After bitter wrangling, he has persuaded the Knesset to approve by vote, for the first time in 37 years, the evacuation of Jewish settlers from the land that they have been encouraged to occupy and colonize since 1967, when it had been wrested from Egypt. This is, by all means, a historic move, whose symbolic import has to be profound for Jews and Arabs alike. Yet, Mr Sharon being Mr Sharon, it is hedged by equally profound mistrust and resentment on every side. The fact remains that any process has to begin at the beginning. And Mr Sharon seems to have begun something that his most resolute opponents would be loath to reverse, whatever their apprehensions regarding his motives. This is the only way the ?road map? could have got off the ground, and never mind now if someone who had seemed to be its most vicious obstacle has played the opening gambit.

 Mr Sharon?s pawn, many Palestinians suspect, is the Gaza Strip, and letting it go will only secure and improve his advantage over the West Bank, where the ravages of occupation continue unabated. Mr Sharon and his deputies are simultaneously giving out to the Israeli public the hints of a parallel design. Giving up Gaza puts the peace process ?in formaldehyde?, and Israel gets to do ?the minimum possible? in order to win the approval of Messrs Colin Powell and Kofi Annan. It is also significant that Mr Sharon calls this his ?unilateral disengagement plan?. The Palestinians are not a party to this plan, and this strategic withdrawal is not being used to arrive at a comprehensive peace agreement. It does not also help to have Hamas and Islamic Jihad celebrate this as the triumph of terror.

 What the Islamists celebrate the Zionists resent. So, the danger of civil war in Israel is quite real as outraged settlers, theocratic rabbis and the nationalist far-right unite to regard Mr Sharon, hitherto their champion, as suddenly turned public enemy number one. And the centre and left in the Knesset ? the opposition Labour and the secular Shinui parties ? find themselves part of an imminent coalition of the willing headed by the prime minister. It must have been surreal too for the doves to hear the hawk assuring Palestinians, ?We did not seek to build our country on your ruins.? Pragmatist or traitor, visionary or villain, Mr Sharon has been brought around by the compulsions of history to make such a statement in the Knesset. While their leader lies mysteriously ailing in Ramallah, his successors uncertain, it is up to the Palestinians as well to make sure that what Mr Sharon holds out to them turns out to be an olive branch.

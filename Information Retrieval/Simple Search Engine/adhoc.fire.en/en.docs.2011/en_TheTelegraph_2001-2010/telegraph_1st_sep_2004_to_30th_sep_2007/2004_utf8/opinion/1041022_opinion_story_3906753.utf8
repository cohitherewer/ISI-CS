 Paperback Pickings

 A season for idol worship

Durga Puja: Yesterday, Today amp; tomorrow by Sudeshna Banerjee (Rupa, Rs 95) could be said to fill the gap created by the dearth of books in English about the Bengali?s favourite festival. Banerjee traces the origins of rituals and the points of divergence in the way they are followed by different groups of worshippers. She does these with a journalist?s eye for the off-beat fact, while also chronicling the waning of the large zamindari pujas and the emergence of the urban community affairs. The bibliography and notes provided at the end are useful. More valuable, perhaps, are documents such as the invitation to the ?Grand Nautches on Doorga Pooja Holidays?, where Baboo Prankissen Holdar humbly declares that ?he will be happy to furnish [the guests] with Tiffin [sic.], Diner [sic.], Wines amp; c,...?

 The Crow Chronicles by Ranjit Lal (Penguin, Rs 350) is an allegory of politics and governance in the manner of Orwell?s Animal Farm. But of course, the high-voltage drama that is Indian politics is in a class of its own. So you have characters such as His Excellency Shri Khatarnak Kala Kaloota Kawa Kaw Kaw, Depraven Craven Raven, Pinky Stink Tainted Storkji and Dr Thappad Maaro Saala BC. All the stock characters in Indian politics put in their bit to make the jungle raj in the Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur, a runaway success. Trying to identify the real-life characters in the beasts and birds is quite a tickle. Interestingly, the painting on the cover is by the former prime minister, V.P. Singh.

Hollywood: The 100 Greatest Films by Derek O?Brien (Penguin, Rs 275) is, it is best to say, one man?s list of his 100 favourite Hollywood movies. It is almost certain that 10 similar lists prepared by 10 avid Hollywood buffs would not have the same films as O?Brien?s, although there would probably be a few in common. For, as O?Brien must be well aware, even his ?Hollywood viewer archetype ? no fuss, no nonsense, eagerly waiting for the next Friday Night Classic? does have his preferences. A Western aficionado might just consider Once Upon a Time in the West more worthy of inclusion than Roman Holiday. But yes, it is fun making these lists. And if there?s trivia on the side, it is surely on its way into the quiz-kid?s library.

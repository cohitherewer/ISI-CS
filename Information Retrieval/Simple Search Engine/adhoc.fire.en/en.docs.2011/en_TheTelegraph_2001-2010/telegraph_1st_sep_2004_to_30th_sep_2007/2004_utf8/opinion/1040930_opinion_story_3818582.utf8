 NOT JUST A SPORTS STORY

 Gouri Chatterjee

 It is huge money, enormous power, blinding glamour. It provides the opium to our masses. It stands to reason that many believe the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India is the second most important job in the country (notwithstanding an erstwhile Times of India editor?s claim that his was the second most important job in the country after the prime minister?s). 

 It is unfortunate, therefore, that the high drama surrounding the election to this post was left to the tender mercies of cricket reporters alone. Even when the dramatis personae were way beyond the ken of the regular cricket reporter.

 Most sports journalists, like most sportsmen, are uncomplicated souls, concerned only with what they see on the field, happy to treat behind-the-scenes antics as none of their business. Investigative journalism has never been their forte. They are in awe of the stars they cover and too comfortable with the sports administrators they deal with. 

 So much so that even though most cricket reporters were fully aware of the rampant betting and match-fixing, the real expos? of this scourge of Indian cricket was not on any sports page but in Outlook magazine and by Aniruddha Bahal, who is hardly a regular sports journalist.

 It was too much then to expect such an ingenuous bunch to track and plot the shenanigans of a seasoned politician like Sharad Pawar or reveal the foolproof system of patronage that Jagmohan Dalmiya has built up over the years and could now call upon. 

 The reports over the last ten days, ever since the Maratha strongman decided to make an entrance, have been trembling with untold stories of deal-making and horse-trading and quid-pro-quos that would add up to a complete picture of the power nexus in India. To have seen it as just a sports story was to diminish ourselves.

 Better than dullness

 Turn from the bland, anaemic coverage of the BCCI elections in the Indian press to the build-up to the first of the three US presidential debates on Friday morning (Thursday evening US time) in the American media and you know what journalistic hype is all about. And the debate doesn?t even end with a winner?s crown for anyone rightaway.

 In fact, even after all the reports and articles and talk shows before and after, there is no clear evidence that the debates influence voters in any significant manner. For all the talk of the first debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, which Nixon is supposed to have lost to his shifty eyes and five o?clock shadow, the figures show that Kennedy had a one-point lead before the debate and one-point after.

 It doesn?t really matter. No one denies it all adds up to a jolly good show. Even the copious laments by intellectuals that this is leading to sizzle over substance perk things up. Surely politics as entertainment is better than politics as dullness. 

 Clear priorities

 There are many reasons Congressmen are said to be unhappy with the prime minister?s press advisor, Sanjay Baru. A PhD in economics, he is much more educated than most of them. A political neophyte, he allowed his boss to be interviewed by the RSS mouthpiece, Panchjanya. But his worst crime, according to these loyal flag-bearers of the 119-year-old party, was his eager dash across the lobby of a London hotel to get the autograph of Hrithik Roshan! ?The PM?s media advisor should have avoided going to the actor like a teenager,? a Congress leader is reported to have said. Baru refuses to be chastized. ?I would any day make my daughter more happy,? he says. Good that he has his priorities clear. Usually, press advisors are merely the stick to beat the prime minister with.

 BAD EXAMPLE

 Members of parliament are always busy. But their business need not bring them to parliament even when it is in session. Attendance in parliament is perhaps a low priority although it is not in session the whole of the year. Sitting in on the meetings of house committees is an equally dispensable duty. The Congress chief?s comment on the MPs? ?poor attendance? sounds embarrassingly like a schoolmistress?s disapproval of truancy, but it is clear from her restraint that Ms Sonia Gandhi has been driven to it. The embarrassment should be on the other side. The elected representatives evidently feel no need to discharge the most obvious duty to their electorates, that they should be present in parliament where they are supposed to represent their voters? interests. Ms Gandhi has emphasized the importance of the bills that will be presented during the short winter session, reminding her party MPs that these bills have a particular relevance in the context of the Congress?s manifesto and the common minimum programme. That the party chief should be compelled to mention this at all is an indicator of the scale of indifference among the MPs. They have apparently made it impossible for a leader to abandon the schoolmistress rhetoric. Ms Gandhi?s censure included an admonition to the MPs to set an example to others instead of pointing to MPs of other parties, who do not come.

 However innocuous absenteeism may look, it is a telling symptom of the political culture that the MPs have embraced. Ms Gandhi has seized on a trend that is really the manifestation of the MPs? indifference to mundane everyday work. Bills and debates, when they are not directly related to the operations of power that change equations between rivals or between the MP and his vote bank, can be given the go-by. Self-importance and the sense of being above all norms and perhaps above the law are also part of this psychology. If the Congress leadership is thinking of a change in the political culture, this is as good a place to start as any.

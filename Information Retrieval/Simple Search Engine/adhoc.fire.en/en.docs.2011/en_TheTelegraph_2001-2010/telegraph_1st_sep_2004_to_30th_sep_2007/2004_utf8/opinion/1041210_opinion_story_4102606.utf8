 THROUGH THE PRISM

 Looking back

The in-between world of Vikram Lall 

By M.G. Vassanji, 

Viking, Rs 425

In August this year, Ngugi wa Thiong?o, Kenya?s eminent 

Gikuyu writer, returned to the country with his wife to deliver a lecture after 

two decades of self-imposed exile. During his stay, four armed men entered the 

couple?s apartment, robbed and beat them, raped Ngugi?s wife, and burned his face 

with cigarette butts. 

 However, Vassanji?s book argues that Kenya was not like this in the past. It was once a country where Africans lived in harmony with Indians who came in as indentured labourers from the subcontinent. As the young Indian-African protagonist, Vikram, tells us: ?One day, Dadi exclaimed, to something Deepa had said about Saeed?s Masai looks, But his mother was such a beautiful Masai girl! There was a stunned silence, and then Dadi said quietly, Yes, Sakina-dadi was a Masai girl when Juma-dada married her long ago.? This is Nakuru, a Kenyan town with its Indian provision-store next to Mrs Arnauti?s Greek caf?, and its traditional Masai-Kikuyu rivalry that unfolds in the time of Empire. A friendly world, where an Indian Muslim can marry a Masai woman while other Indian men look for wives from ?home?. 

 Vikram, his sister Deepa, and their Kikuyu friend, Njoroge, whose grandfather, Mwangi, is the common gardener in the settlement, make friends with two British children, Bill and Annie Bruce. It is the fifties and Vikram?s father listens with rapt attention to radio reports of the new queen?s coronation. Resentment towards imperialism is, however, growing, especially in the form of rising Mau Mau atrocities despite British attempts to relocate the Kikuyu. The Mau Mau comes to Nakuru as well. In a gruesome attack, they kill the entire Bruce family, including the two children.

 The British crack down is equally brutal. They repeatedly round up the Kikuyu for questioning; they send them, wearing their papers tied around their necks, in trains to other settlements packed like cattle; and sometimes they just try to have some cruel fun.

 Things are not much better in independent Kenya either. The African state turns not only upon the British, but also upon other non-Africans, trying to seize property and looking for ways to launder their black money; and the disquieting ghost of the former Mau Mau is yet to be exorcized. Within the Lall family, too, there are deep fractures: Deepa?s love for Njoroge is fiercely opposed by her mother.

 Vikram?s is literally an in-between world. Growing up in Kenya, he is only dimly aware of his Indian heritage.The increasing unrest forces his parents to move to Nairobi and the children lose contact with Njoroge. Later, Vikram moves to Dar-es-Salaam to study; finally, after being caught in the web of political and financial intrigue that free Kenya becomes, he moves to Canada. 

 Vassanji?s novel is a nuanced and deeply humane account of childhood, family, friendships, and Africa. However it does have its flaws ? while describing Vikram?s life in politics, it tries to tell too much: there are far too many characters and we only get a fleeting glimpse before they disappear. The account of Deepa?s doomed relationship with Njoroge, too, fails to impress.

 Vassanji?s fifth book, is a post-colonial novel, trying to understand the complexities of the present through the prisms of the colonial encounter and everything that followed. And as the attack on Ngugi demonstrates, such an understanding is urgently needed.

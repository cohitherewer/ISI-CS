 WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY

 POT SHOT

 Why are top-10 lists such a rage? 

 It?s an oft-repeated line at end-of-term school meetings. Don?t push your kid too hard, don?t push him into the rat race of marks, whether he makes it into the top 10 in his class is hardly important ? says the principal with a sepulchral face. On the other side of the table anxious parents sit looking guilty, while the kids, if they are around, dream on about Tom and Jerry. The funny thing is, at home, the same principal or parent spends his spare time flipping through a magazine story on the top-10 B-schools, while the child sits goggle-eyed in front of the TV, watching teen idols vie for top prizes. But then those are different rankings altogether.

 Human beings, like most school principals, are hypocrites. They refuse to see one simple fact ? we, as a species, are obsessed with number games. Take, for example, the buzz in the British press a few days back. Gone With the Wind, the epic American Civil War saga starring Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh, has been declared the most-watched in a list of top-10 films in British history. The list also has Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Star Wars and The Jungle Book. Apparently, 35 million-odd people have watched Gone With the Wind since its release in the UK in 1940. And how did the British Film Institute arrive at this figure? Elementary. All they had to do was take accurate stock of ticket sales over the past six decades, and bingo! The figure had emerged. And in case you wanted to know, the second film on the list was The Sound of Music, with around 30 million tickets sold since 1965. Now that?s a hell of a lot ? five million separating the top two films. But honestly, does it really matter to you ? or to any member of the audience ? whether Gone With the Wind sold more tickets? All the films on the list are acknowledged classics. For us, the von Trapp-family singers are as fascinating as Scarlett O?Hara and we don?t need sales figures to show us that. But organizations actually thrive on this kind of work. Just imagine, people tirelessly rummaging through dusty film archives for months to bring you these figures.

 So what is it that attracts people to such meaningless jumbles of numbers? And if they weren?t popular, monstrosities like The Guinness Book of World Records wouldn?t be compiled with such care. My gut feeling is that figures fascinate because they make things easy. 

 The convenient packets of numbers generated by these top 10s are a perfect tool for ordering the world around us. All human beings have an aversion to not knowing, and these lists satisfy our desire for codified knowledge. We look up ?believe it or not? lists precisely because we want to know who the fattest, or tallest, men in the world are. And though I have no idea what that much money looks like, it?s still great to know that Bill Gates is the richest on the top-10 list with over $46 billion to stuff his wallet with. So next time don?t think twice before pushing your kid towards the top 10 in his class.

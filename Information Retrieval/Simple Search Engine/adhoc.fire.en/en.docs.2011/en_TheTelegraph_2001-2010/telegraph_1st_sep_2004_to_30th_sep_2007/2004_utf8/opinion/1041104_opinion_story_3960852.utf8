 TIME TO GO ON ANOTHER PAPER CHASE 

The mid-term appraisal of the tenth five year plan may 

help assess how far the goals of the NCMP can be realized, writes S. Venkitaramanan 

The author is former governor, Reserve Bank of India

 Revisiting the goals 

The Planning Commission has issued a paper on the 

approach to the mid-term appraisal of the 10th five year plan. This is an exercise 

in which the ?foreign agents? were to have been involved as members of consultative 

committees. But these have since been disbanded by the deputy chairman, leaving 

economists, both of the left and the right, without a platform. They now resent 

the decision, but then they had asked for it.

The approach paper is now out, obviously for discussion 

in the public domain. It also lays out the broad issues that could be the subject 

of discussion (and a possible face-off?) with the finance ministry, mainly in 

respect of resources. The paper discusses the feasibility of attainment of the 

targets laid down in the 10th plan. The rate of economic growth in 2002-03 was 

4.6 per cent and that in 2003-04, 8.3 per cent, averaging 6.4 per cent for two 

years. The goal of 8 per cent, indicated in the national common minimum programme, 

may be out of sight. Indeed, even in order to reach the average of 7 per cent, 

as indicated in the plan, the pace of growth has to be well above 10 per cent 

in each of the two remaining years. This seems difficult, says the approach paper.

An important issue raised in the paper relates to 

the erosion of resources for the plan in particular, and for the fisc in general. 

The resources position expected in the remainder of the plan is likely to be more 

difficult than was visualized at the time it was framed. The problem has doubled 

as the NCMP has laid down new priorities of outlays in sectors such as health, 

education, irrigation, watershed development, railway modernization and, in particular, 

the employment programme. The MTA has to examine the resources position critically 

in the light of the NCMP. If the choice is between the NCMP and the 10th plan, 

will the left still hold the NCMP sacrosanct and insist that the plan works out? 

Or could it be argued that NCMP itself is a mandated extension of the plan? 

As of now, the allocations for the plan have been 

running lower than the targets. So far, in the first three years of the plan, 

the allocations have been 44.2 per cent as against the targeted 54 per cent. The 

position in the states is more difficult, particularly because of the poor resources 

picture in the power boards. In addition, they are still weighed down by the impact 

of the pay commission award. The MTA will have to assess the extent of the impact 

of each of these factors, keeping in view the additional commitments imposed by 

the NCMP.

The approach paper hints at the large allocation of 

resources that the national employment guarantee programme will require. Its estimate 

is that for rural areas alone, the cost of implementing the programme will be 

between Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 40,000 crore. Though the burden could be shared 

between the Centre and the states, the latter will inevitably transfer the burden 

to the Centre through demands for either additional Central assistance or finance 

commission devolution or both. The approach paper lays out the need for examining 

this in the context of the resources picture and the feasibility of increasing 

the employment cover of existing investment expenditure, especially in rural areas. 

The profile of the employment guarantee programme is, therefore, still to be defined. 

Referring to unemployment in general, the approach paper indicates that the tenth 

plan has identified the reform of labour laws as a critical factor for industrial 

growth. The planners are hell-bent on inciting the left. The planners have referred 

to the need for securing land rights in order to implement the programme for investment 

in waste lands and degraded lands. The issue is politically sensitive. Will state 

administrations be prepared to bite this bullet?

The approach paper recognizes the need for the improvement 

of extension systems in agriculture. It also touches on the need to reform research 

and development activities. These are areas on which the Swaminathan commission 

will deal with more competently. There is perhaps no need for the MTA to revisit 

the same grounds. 

The paper touches on another politically divisive 

subject when it refers to the need to reform agricultural marketing, removing 

the impediments imposed by the Essential Commodities Act. The NCMP however prescribes 

the opposite. The paper thinks it is necessary to review the situation. The act, 

with all its draconian restrictions, does impede the development of private sector 

initiatives in agricultural marketing. There is an obvious need to approach the 

issue with a full understanding of the problem and its complexity as well as the 

political sensitivity which may mask many vested interests.

With respect to the education sector, the approach 

paper confronts the issue of lack of resources for the major initiative ? the 

Sarva Siksha Abhiyan. How long will the Centre and the states continue to paper 

over the problems imposed by gaps in resources in this critical sector? Now that 

right to education has been declared a fundamental right, there is yet another 

prospect. The courts can intervene, says the approach paper. This will only increase 

the space for judicial activism, which has already extended from sports to environment. 

This is a recognition of the incapacity of political governments to ?govern? and 

take hard decisions.

The approach paper notes that the infrastructure presents 

serious problems. It asserts that the MTA has to assess the scope for increasing 

capacities through a combination of enhanced public investment and attracting 

private-public partnerships. Whatever the public-private mix, there can be no 

solution for the infrastructure problem so long as the political class fights 

shy of charging the consumer what it costs to provide an infrastructural service 

? be it power, transport or water supply.

In regard to the power sector, the approach paper 

notes that there has been serious under-investment since the ninth plan period. 

State electricity board reforms are already well behind schedule. The paper notes 

that ?populism? by state governments continues to be an impediment to following 

a rational electrification strategy. This appears to be a case of whistling in 

the dark. Populism is apparent in every political manifesto, including that of 

the previous political dispensation. How is MTA to resolve this dilemma?

This approach to the MTA shows that the review itself 

will test the negotiating skills of both the Planning Commission and the finance 

ministry. There is always an element of constructive tension in the Indian arrangements 

for economic governance. The planners have the urge to ?grow? investment, and 

the finance ministry has a tendency to rein in outlays for reasons of fiscal prudence. 

The conflict between the advocates of large investment and those of fiscal austerity 

is not unique to the present government. Observers recall that in 1986, Manmohan 

Singh himself as deputy chairman of the Planning Commission had a confrontation 

with V. P. Singh, the then finance minister, when he pressed for a larger plan. 

The issue was resolved after considerable discussion, 

first mediated in vain by P.V. Narasimha Rao and then decided by the then prime 

minister, Rajiv Gandhi, himself. The deux ex machina was the familiar device 

of deficit financing. Deficit finance in the order of Rs 40,000 crore was assigned 

as a ?resource? for the plan finance and the advocates of the larger plan romped 

home triumphant. Will we see a repeat of the same ploy ? ?fiscal responsibility? 

and ?budget management? notwithstanding? Only the mid-term review will help unlock 

the puzzle.

 OLD CURIOSITY SHOP

 Politics and films have a large area of overlap. Success in both arenas is dependent upon the responses of the public. Both are also to do with acting for audiences. So it is natural that filmstars are often lured into politics either as a candidate or as a campaigner to get the crowds past the turnstiles. But what is not that easily explained is the entry of a fashion designer into the political arena. Ms Shaina NC, a designer who is famous for the number of ways she can wear a sari, is all set to be the candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party from Bandra in Mumbai. Even though she is undecided, she is a loyal soldier who believes that she has no choice if the party asks her to contest the elections. Designer clothes are still exclusive things despite the proliferation of shopping malls and chic boutiques. So there is a question mark hovering over Ms Shaina?s public exposure. The party?s preference for her might very well be determined by the fact that Ms Shaina?s mother is a Muslim and Bandra is predominantly a Muslim community. Behind the fashion show, the BJP is making hard-headed political calculations.

 It could be argued that the induction of Ms Shaina is a sign of the growing appeal of politics as a vocation. Such an argument may, however, turn out to be too facile. For one thing, she comes from a political family. Her father, Mr Nana Chudasama, is a former sheriff of Mumbai. For another, she herself has evidently been a loyal BJP foot-soldier for some time. This is apparent from her readiness to accept the party?s decision even if her own mind is still not made up about being a candidate in the forthcoming elections. She, in fact, wants the party to make up her mind for her. She cannot be taken as a new entrant into politics even if this is her electoral debut. Her political and ideological mind has been made up for some time and she has already tied her fortunes to the BJP bandwagon.

 The BJP may not be rewarding her for her loyalty alone. The BJP spin doctors in Maharashtra, especially the veteran war horse, Mr Pramod Mahajan, see an apparent fit between Ms Shaina and the party?s perception of the voter profile of Bandra. The Muslim angle has already been touched upon. As a fashion designer, the party expects that she will be able to reach out to the affluent sections of Bandra and her skills with a sari will be able to woo the traditional voters.

 The choice of Ms Shaina has only the appearance of a novelty. The calculations at work are those that have driven electoral politics for a very long time. These calculations may not be as old as the sari but they do hide a a multitude of sins and are not half as aesthetically appealing as the nine yards of cloth which is one of the most elegant ways to dress the female form.

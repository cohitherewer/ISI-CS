 END GAME

 The Calcutta high court order against bandhs has prompted a rare moment of sympathy between two arch-enemies. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has declared that the Trinamool Congress is certainly not ?untouchable? as far as discussions about implementing bandhs is concerned. The section of the CPI(M) that either feels the need to play to its constituents? gallery or is simply unaware that times have changed since the glorious days when the CPI(M) headed the bandh culture, feels all political parties must have a discussion about the judiciary?s interference into the right of disruption. The courts? orders target disruption, not the right to protest. The only way out for bandh-seekers is to conflate the two and argue that the court is going against the right to protest. But the high court has left no scope for equivocation. It has followed the earlier Supreme Court order, which says that the very use of the word ?bandh? implies coercion. As such, it goes against the fundamental right of the citizen to free movement, and is therefore unconstitutional. Political parties charged with such violation could be penalized by fines or, in extreme cases, by derecognition. The Shiv Sena is unlikely to forget the Bombay high court?s recent action against it. 

 The ground is slippery for the CPI(M). The chakka jam coordinated by the CPI(M)-affiliated Centre of Trade Unions was not at all as unsuccessful as the state government would like to give out. The police may have arrested CITU activists as they claim; it made no difference to the disruption. It is interesting that CPI(M) leaders are sending different messages in the same breath: one, the Trinamool Congress bandh is bad, two, the CITU is a trade union not a political party, three, all political parties must meet and discuss the relevance of bandhs. The truth, as usual, is simple. Most people do not like bandhs, and bandhs are terrible for the state?s image and economy. Politicians and the state government must stop hemming and hawing and just make up their minds.

 BACK TO THE MESSAGE

 It is entirely appropriate that a Muslim, a Hindu and a Sikh namely Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mr Manmohan Singh visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar on the 400th anniversary of the installation of the Adi Granth or the Granth Sahib in Harmandir. No other religion of India represents the composite character of Indian culture and civilization as well as Sikhism, and the Granth Sahib is the sacred book of the Sikhs. It was compiled by the fifth guru Arjan (1563-1606) at Amritsar. He located and collected the texts of the contributions of his predecessors. He then selected the genuine compositions of the previous four gurus. After this, he selected a spot called Ramsar and began to dictate the text to Bhai Gurudas. This work was finished in August 1604. For the Sikhs not only is the book holy, but its provenance is also sacred. It was put together by Arjan and brings together all the hymns of the gurus and others, like Farid, Sur Das, Mira Bai and Kabir, who shared ideas similar to those advocated by Guru Nanak. But the songs of the Granth are not arranged by authors or themes but according to 31 ragas, each marking a particular time of the day. The hymns are simple and profound and are imbued with the spirit of devotion and love.

 The religion that Nanak preached was monotheistic, tolerant and non-violent. The society he envisaged was casteless and the god he worshipped was formless. His religion appealed to the peasants of Punjab and its adjoining areas who derived from the simple message faith, strength and sustenance. For them, Nanaks words represented the soul of a soulless world. But the Sikhism of Nanak underwent a radical transformation under the aegis of Guru Gobind Singh (1666-1708). Under him, Sikhism moved from pacifism to militancy. This transformation was largely the product of a time and a historical context. Punjab, the heartland of Sikhism, was caught in the turmoil of Mughal politics and the attempts of successive Mughal emperors to control Punjab as a secure buffer against invasions from the North- west. The ensuing confrontation between the Mughals and the Sikhs transformed the original religion of Nanak.

 This militancy led to the identification of Sikhism with the rise of political extremism in Punjab in the Eighties. The result was a series of disasters for the Sikhs. First came the attack on the Golden Temple to flush out terrorists from its precincts. In retaliation to this came the assassination of Indira Gandhi and following that, the killing of Sikhs in Delhi and its environs. There is an urgent need to return to the original message of Nanak and the Adi Granth. Sikhism needs it and India needs it too.

 DIARY

 Whoever said the best way to a man?s heart is through his stomach, couldn?t be more correct. The route to the same spot in a woman seems to be quite different, as two greying males in the saffron family found out recently. After dumping a bewildered LK Advani among his partymen at the meeting, Uma Bharti supposedly went back to the bosses the next day. Advani had, by then, managed to regain some equanimity, and was ready to serve the sadhvi the delicious soup his wife Kamla had rustled up. Uma apparently groped for words to apologize for what had happened. The t?te ? t?te came to an abrupt end as Advani cut Bharti short while she was making references to some of her erstwhile colleagues. Uma?s next halt was at AB Vajpayee?s. The out-of-work poet talked a little politics and wished her well. The meal served was entirely satvik, sans garlic and onion, and is said to have greatly pleased Bharti. The aftertaste, however, was anything but pleasurable. It will take a while before both men can digest the contents of Uma?s parting gift, the letter bomb. Antacids for them?

 The minister of state for civil supplies, Mohammad Taslimuddin, has already exchanged his views about the lack of work for junior ministers with the prime minister. So he was delighted when the vital charge of the commodities market exchange appeared to fall on his lap. This portfolio is crucial for any altruistic politician who dispenses favours generously to those who seek him. Taslimuddin was beside himself with joy when he received a dispatch of a report on the review of commodities. That was till Sharad Pawar, minister in charge of civil supplies, brought him down with a thud, saying the file had been wrongly delivered. Calls for a heated exchange of words?

 The indomitable Laloo Prasad Yadav recently discovered he is less of a king than he supposed he was. Although the RJD leader managed to board the flight to join the delegation that flew out to attend Yasser Arafat?s funeral, he survived some anxious moments. His passport was in a court?s custody in Ranchi and Laloo had to secure its permission to travel abroad. It was only after the CBI told the court that it had no objection to the accused being given his passport that Laloo was granted permission to leave. Humbled? Lets hope so.

 Should we call him Mr Political Correctness? PC had been a successful lawyer before donning the mantle of the country?s finance minister. Now that he wears a different hat, he often has to pass judgment on matters concerning his former clients. So that he is not misconstrued, PC makes his own notes on such files, ?In this case I do not want my judgment to influence the cases since I had represented them earlier in my capacity as a lawyer...?. Are other lawyers-turned-politicos listening?

 In the Madhya Pradesh civic polls, the left, despite its negligible presence, seems to have stolen a march on its rivals, the BJP and the Congress. The magic mantra is public toilets ? to be constructed at one kilometre intervals in the state capital and other big cities. The idea has also been a major hit in the rural areas where the left plans to have such amenities within a radius of every five kilometres. For a state which is said to have only one public toilet for about two lakh people, there couldn?t be a better way to net votes.

 Extended agony for ND Tiwari, who has already expressed his wish to quit as Uttaranchal CM. The leader is supposed to have stopped taking interest in administrative affairs, and politicians and bureaucrats are already trying to shift their allegiances to a safer bet. Tiwari has trained his sights on the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai which is to be vacated by Mohammad Fazal later this month. Fazal had brought about sweeping changes in the Raj Bhavan, including allowing the holding of film mahurats and dance performances. Tiwari just might add more variety.

 The RSS seems to have taken Bharti?s allegations against the boorhas seriously. KS Sudarshan might be vacating his place for a younger Mohan Bhagwat soon. Watch this space.

 Delhi is a crude if not a cruel city. Which is why the flow of the Diwali gifts has been re-routed, although they have not stopped their journey to the saffron side altogether. People still dropped in to meet the BJP bigwigs, but without either urgency or eagerness. It goes without saying that it is the Congress camp which now finds itself awash with the bhets. There are the invariable and unavoidable collections of seasonal dry fruits, baskets of pistachios and expensive pens. A hotelier recently even gifted a minister a diamond-studded wristwatch, and the politico?s wife some designer jewellery. Meanwhile, the Punjab government once again thought it best to use the occasion to advertise the state. A hamper containing tins of sarson ka saag, cheese, pickles and woollen pullovers of an internationally-known brand manufactured in Ludhiana made it to the houses of select politicians, journalists and socialites. No beating the sardars!

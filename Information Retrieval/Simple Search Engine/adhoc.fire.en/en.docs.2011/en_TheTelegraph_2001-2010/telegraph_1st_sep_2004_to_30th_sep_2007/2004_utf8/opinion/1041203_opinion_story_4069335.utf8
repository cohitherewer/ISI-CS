 FASTER, HIGHER, STRONGER 

 Immortals among us

GREAT INDIAN OLYMPIANS

By Gulu Ezekiel and K. Arumugam, 

Field Hockey, Rs 320

Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore?s silver medal in double-trap 

shooting at the 2004 Athens Olympics led to a lot of euphoria. But it prompted 

few books on his life and career. This gap has now been filled by this slick book 

on 19 great Olympians of India. It has been co-authored by Gulu Ezekiel, a sports 

commentator, and K. Arumugam, a hockey statistician. 

 In the 108-year history of the modern Olympics, India has won most medals in hockey ? eight gold, one silver and two bronze. Seven hockey players have been profiled here ? Dhyan Chand, Balbir Singh, Leslie Claudius, Shankar Laxman, Charanjit Singh (India?s 1964 Olympics-gold-medal-winning skipper), Mohammed Shahid and Balkishen Singh. There are six profiles of athletes and one each of wrestling (K.D. Jadhav, the 1952 Helsinki Olympics bronze medallist), tennis (Leander Paes), football (Neville D?Souza, the only Indian to score a hat-trick in the Olympics), weight-lifting (Karnam Malleswari) as well as two of the outstanding shooters, Anjali Bhagwat and Rathore. 

 The highlight of this book is a complete list of Indian Olympians from 1900 to 2004, arranged alphabetically. Another highlight is a clever use of anecdotes. 

 Sample these. Before the Indian hockey team departed for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Lal Bahadur Shastri told it, ?If you lose the gold medal, people will say after Nehru, India is not doing well...So in your winning lies my prestige.? Balkishen Singh?s comment on a wayward decision is also memorable ? ?Umpires are like watches, they never match.?

 Rathore?s recovery from a patella fracture and a prolapsed disc to an Olympic medal is well known. The chapter on Rathore gives a vivid account of how he moved from fifth in the qualifiers to finish with a silver medal in the finals. There is also a description of how Rathore took up shooting just 5 years ago at the range of the 9 Grenadiers.

 The profiles also provide a fascinating insight into the inept functioning of sport officials in India. K.D. Jadhav had to arrange for funds to go to Helsinki. Sports officials did not help, but the principal of his alma mater, Ram College in Kolhapur, sold his house to raise the money. The famous athletics coach, Ilyas Babar, was not included in the official Indian contingent for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. He borrowed money to fly to Montreal and guide his prot?g?, Sriram Singh, in the final of the 800 metres. India?s most successful hockey coach, Balkishen Singh, was never given a long -term contract. He coached India in six different spells but never for longer than two years.

 The agony of P.T. Usha and Milkha Singh, who narrowly missed out on bronze medals in the 1984 and 1960 Olympics respectively, is aptly narrated. So is the grit of Paes and Malleswari, who won bronze medals in 1996 and 2000. 

 The book has delightful titbits of information. For example, Shanker Laxman was the first goalkeeper to become captain of an international hockey team and the only one to have played in three successive Olympic finals. Norman Pritchard?s little-known acting skills in the theatres of London and New York are mentioned. Under Balkishen Singh, the Indian hockey team lost only two of its 14 meetings with Pakistan. Few know that the international football player, Neville D?Souza, also excelled in hockey. 

 Well-researched, the book is both entertaining and informative. It is a must-have for all Indian sports fans.

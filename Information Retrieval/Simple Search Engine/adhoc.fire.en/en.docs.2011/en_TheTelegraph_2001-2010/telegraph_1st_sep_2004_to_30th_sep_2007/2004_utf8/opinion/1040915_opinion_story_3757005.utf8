 NO FLAPPING

 Ms Uma Bharti?s ruckus dishonours far more than the tiranga. With politics severing itself completely from civilized or constitutional behaviour, it is of little import whether the national flag is being carried or hung or moved about in the proper way. So the Supreme Court is right in criticizing the litigant who has seen Ms Bharti?s conduct as dishonouring the tricolour. But, more generally speaking, how earnest should Indians be about ?honouring? the national flag? In a mature democracy that respects, more or less, the rule of law, and does so with a relaxed and natural civilizedness, should reverence for national tokens be enforced by rigorously formulated rules? Promptly standing up for even a snatch of the national anthem, or feeling deeply insulted by a woman in a tricolour cocktail dress is quaintly patriotic. But knee-jerk touchiness on such matters could be a waste of energy and the courts? time. After all, it is only in India that such schoolboyishness is at all taken seriously. It is time Indians learnt to respect, in a properly adult fashion, what these tokens actually stand for, rather than getting red in the face with superannuated feelings of outrage. 

 Most other modern democracies have incorporated a healthy dose of irreverence in their public conduct with regard to the nation and its hallowed symbols. Union Jack boxer-shorts and Star-and-Stripes lingerie raise no eyebrows whatsoever, although both countries have their ?flag codes?, which, like many other Neanderthal acts and bills, are quietly ignored. India should stop feeling insecure at the drop of a hat about its citizens? allegiances. The latest amendments to the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, made by the previous government, are a perfect expression of such paranoia. It threatens with imprisonment whoever ?burns, mutilates, defaces, defiles, disfigures, destroys, tramples upon or otherwise brings into contempt? the national flag. Indians calmly tolerate most of these actions being performed with impunity on their fellow citizens. Some of the righteousness that anthems, flags and symbols elicit from patriotic Indians could indeed be directed towards feelings and values that would be of far greater use to the country than sentimental and histrionic tokenism.

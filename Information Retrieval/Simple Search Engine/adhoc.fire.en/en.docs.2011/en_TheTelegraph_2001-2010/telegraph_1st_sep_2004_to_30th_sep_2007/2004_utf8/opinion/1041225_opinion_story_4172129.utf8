 MAMA

 KNOWS

 BEST

 She has celebrated birth, looked at death, stayed at home upon her children?s wish and tried to foster peace between siblings. Clearly, 2004 has been the year of the Indian matriarch 

 Here?s looking at you, Mom. On Christmas Day, when the world ? or a part of it, anyway ? recalls another Mother, the Virgin Mary, we raise a toast to a phenomenon that has seldom been publicly saluted: the Indian Mother, aka the Mother of all Mothers. 

 It?s nice to be recognised; and especially so for an Indian mom, whose main role has been within the four walls of her house. But 2004 was different, for it saw a spew of mothers hit the the news. 

 On a hot summer?s day, a mother called Sonia did what women often do ? she gave up a well-paid job (even before she could take it up), because, it was said, her children wanted her to be home. Six months later, another hausfrau was in the news. This one, called Kokilaben, is also doing what mothers are supposed to ? she is trying to bring about peace between her two quarrelsome sons.

 Elsewhere, too, mothers have been in the news. There is the gutsy Sujatha, who fought ? and lost ? the battle to help her terminally ill son die so that he could donate his organs. On the flip-side, there is Tulsi ? the much-loved and equally-hated small screen daughter-in-law-turned-mother ? who is slated to shoot her wayward son, Ansh.

 Clearly, this was the year of the Mother. And what?s significant is that Indian mothers ? otherwise modest and retiring ? are stepping out into the public domain and making headlines. So far, despite the fact that mothers have always had a role to play, nothing that they ever did called for a news story or a photograph ? unless, of course, the mother was called Pamela Anderson. 

 If there was one wing of the media that periodically doffed its cap to the Essential Indian Mother, it was Hindi cinema. For long years, the Indian mother in Bollywood films has been an object of veneration, an emotion best explained in a dialogue between two estranged brothers in a film called Deewar. 

 In the much-remembered sequence, Brother One boasts to Brother Two of his bungalows, cars, money and fame. ?But what do you have?? he asks the younger brother, who thinks for a while and says: ?I have Mom.? 

 The year was also significant, because on October 13, Nirupa Roy ? who, more than anybody else, symbolised the soul-sacrificing screen mother ? died. She was the quintessential mom, the one who brought up her offspring singlehandedly in scores of films, sewing clothes through the night to keep the fires burning. 

 There are, of course, mothers and mothers. Yet, there is often a thread that binds them. Take Sonia Gandhi. Though spectacularly different from the screen roles that Nirupa Roy immortalised, she did something that the screen mom would have approved of. 

 Kokilaben?s position in the Ambani household is said to be equally significant, though it?s not yet clear what kind of a role the matriarch expects to play to unite the bitter brothers. What is known is that she has an over-riding influence over her two sons, and is quite a formidable presence in Sea Wind, the Ambanis? multi-storeyed apartment complex on Cuffe Parade. 

 Remember, it was Kokilaben who spotted a young Nita at a dance recital and decided that she was going to be her elder daughter-in-law. And it was Kokilaben who urged the younger daughter-in-law, Tina, to work for the aged.

 A few other mothers here and there have made the news. Some are chalking out new paths for themselves. In February this year, an Indian woman gave birth to her twin grandchildren after agreeing to be a surrogate mother to her London-based daughter.

 Somewhere, a mother celebrated birth, somewhere else she looked at death. On December 17, when K. Sujatha lit her son?s funeral pyre in Hyderabad, she was fulfilling one of the two wishes voiced by him. She couldn?t keep his other wish ? that he be allowed to die ?but has said that she will continue her fight for terminally ill people?s right to euthanasia. 

 Tulsi, at a farcical level, is waiting for her son to die, too. But when she kills her son in an episode of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi to be aired in 2005, it will be because the evil boy deserves to die. And all that producer Ektaa Kapoor will do is coin a new adage: the hand that rocks the cradle also holds a gun. 

 All in all, it?s the mother?s day out. You could even call it the Year of the Matriarch.

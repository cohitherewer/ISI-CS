 Letters to Editor

 The governing game

 Sir ? The political culture of India seems to have boiled down to this ? you go against the book, I try to go one up on you in that too. And so, the Congress tries to carry forward the Bharatiya Janata Party?s policy of appointing governors from among partymen or party-loyalists. The image of the governor in India has always been one of an apolitical person, often an academic or with significant contribution to society. Of course, there have been governors close to particular parties, but even they had the necessary distance from direct party activities. Not so today, when Madan Lal Khurana quits as governor to devote more time for party work, and Sushil Kumar Shinde is given a gubernatorial lollypop in exchange for the Maharashtra chief minister?s chair (?Governor shuffle speed-up to pacify Shinde?, Oct 31). Give up hope, all ye who still see impartial streaks in Indian politics.

 Yours faithfully,

Shekhar Gupta, Calcutta

 No safety blanket

 Sir ? The molestation of a Polish woman in Calcutta has proved once again how unsafe the city?s streets are for women. The chief minister?s comments prove, also for the umpteenth time, that Bengal?s communists can never change their spots (?Sorry Chief Minister, we women feel unsafe?, Oct 26). Why make claims of superior law-and-order management when incidents around the city suggest exactly the opposite? I have seen teenage girls walking freely on the streets of Mumbai well past midnight without an inkling of fear. Can we imagine such a scenario in Calcutta, even in the high-security zone around the residence of Bengal?s chief minister? Can Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee claim that he can let his own daughter move around the city after ten at night without feeling worried? 

 I must mention here that I got so frustrated with the ruling communists of Bengal that I wanted to see what the real communists were like. So I accepted an offer from a Chinese company to work in Shanghai. Here I find a good percentage of taxi-drivers are ladies and they drive until 11 pm and even later. Can Buddhababu guarantee such freedom for women in his state?

 Yours faithfully,

Subir Sil, Shanghai

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Feeling unsafe? (Oct 27), points out quite correctly that in Marxist West Bengal, it is not safety alone which is at stake, but the entire administration?s understanding of the place of women in society which has made the state unsafe for women to live with honour. The Communist Party of India (Marxist)?s understanding of women is clear from its recent diktat ordering a man to sacrifice his ear, or pay Rs 22,000 for outraging the modesty of a woman. Is Rs 22,000, then, the price of a woman?s modesty, according to the party in power?

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Notwithstanding the claims made by the chief minister of West Bengal that his state is an ?oasis of peace?, eve-teasing and harassment of women on the streets of Calcutta are not merely common but, in fact, quite rampant. Cases that are reported represent only the tip of the iceberg. Most cases are not reported as the victim is usually regarded as a ?fallen woman? and because family ?honour? must be preserved at all cost. There is also fear of retaliation from organized criminal elements who enjoy the patronage of political masters. Even when cases are reported, there is very little sympathy from a chauvinistic and overwhelmingly male police force that is often known to question the victim?s ?character?.

 If the recent incident of molestation of a Polish woman in the affluent residential area of south Calcutta has ruffled some feathers in the administration, that is only because the involvement of a foreign national could sully the state?s reputation internationally. Calcuttans should not begin to think that their lives will brighten up after this one incident. 

 Not too long ago, in a somewhat similar incident, a woman returning from work and a male colleague accompanying her were harassed and severely beaten up in a suburban railway station by a group of local goons. On New Year?s Eve, 2002, four drunk off-duty policemen, teasing and harassing a woman in central Calcutta, killed another policeman, Bapi Sen, because the latter protested. Some years back, a deaf and mute minor girl was raped by policemen. Can we still hope that the molestation of a Polish woman will act as a wake-up call for the state administration, when several incidents before it did not?

 Yours faithfully,

Saumitra Banerjee, Hereford, UK

 Sir ? In Calcutta, a Polish national can report her assault to the police, but a woman living in the city would rather not. The officer taking down the information is likely to ask what the woman might have done to ?provoke? the assaulter, and if the woman is not malleable enough, the law-keepers could treat her the same way that the assaulter did. Has anyone cared to find out how many of the cases reported in the papers are carried to their logical, legal end?

 Yours faithfully,

Gita Datta Ray, Calcutta

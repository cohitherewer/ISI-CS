 CLASSED IN

 ?Alas, slowly will Tamil perish/ As languages of the West flourish.? This was a Tamil poet?s fear in the early 20th century. But Subramania Bharati?s apprehensions were unfounded. Tamil has now found its saviour in none other than the government of India. Just before the prime minister flew out to the West, his cabinet made two declarations: the Prevention of Terrorism Act was repealed, and Tamil was made a ?classical language?. This pairing is, indeed, bizarre. One might be tempted to commend the versatility of the United Progressive Alliance for combining governance and erudition with such effortless elegance. But it would be better for both governance and erudition if the government did not mix them up, and kept well out of the latter. The study of classical languages and literatures waxes and wanes in centres of learning all over the world. But no other government has taken it upon itself to ?declare?, after due bureaucratic process, that ancient Greek, Latin, Chinese, Persian or Arabic are classical languages, thereby ensuring a sudden improvement in the quality of their study. In fact, even Sanskrit is not yet ?officially? a classical language in India. But nobody, in India or outside, has ever disputed its status as one.

 This is not to dispute Tamil?s claim to such recognition. It is as old as Latin and older than Arabic; it emerged as an independent tradition, with almost no influence from Sanskrit or other languages; and its ancient literature is vast and rich. Tamil also has its own aesthetics, poetics and grammatical tradition. But a nation or region?s consciousness of its own linguistic heritage, and the translation of this consciousness into scholarship and creativity, cannot be given to it externally by the state. This happens through a long historical process that ranges from the purely academic to the vitally popular. And attracting more funds for the study of Tamil is not enough reason for the state to expedite this process. 

 The UPA government?s elevation of Tamil is, of course, far from disinterested, and seems to have been done against the recommendations of some of the academic members of the Centre?s ?committee of languages?. A promise to this effect was in the UPA?s common minimum programme, and the president?s first address to parliament had also raised hopes ? particularly of Mr M. Karunanidhi, leader of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. It is ironic that the DMK?s anti-Hindi movement in the mid-Sixties was set off by the Congress?s insistence on making Hindi the country?s sole official language. Northern Bihar had positively wept with joy when India?s previous prime minister promised to include Maithili in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. In many-tongued India, the politics of language can never be above populism ? even when the standards being invoked are nothing less than classical.

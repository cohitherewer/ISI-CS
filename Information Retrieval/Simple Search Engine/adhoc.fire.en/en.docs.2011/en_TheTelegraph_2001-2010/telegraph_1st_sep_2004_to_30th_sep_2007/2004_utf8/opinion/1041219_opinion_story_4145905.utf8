 RIGHT TO DIE

 Death is the only thing certain in life. Another way of conveying the paradox is to say that the right to death should be the logical complement of the right to life. But the point is not always that simple and most societies are profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of euthanasia, the right to end one?s life voluntarily when one is terminally ill. In India, a country that criminalizes suicide, euthanasia is yet to emerge as an important item on the legislators? agenda. The death of K. Venkatesh in Andhra Pradesh has suddenly brought this issue under the glare of public attention. Venkatesh, who died on Friday, was suffering from muscular dystrophy. A few days before his death, fully aware that he would die once the ventilator was switched off, his mother had appealed to the Andhra Pradesh high court, to let her son die before his organs became unfit for donation under the curse of the disease he was suffering from. The court had turned down the plea on the grounds that Venkatesh was not brain dead and the law allowed donation of organs only in cases where the patient was brain dead.

 The intellectual foundations of euthanasia go down to the problem of individual freedom. In Western political philosophy, or at least in one dominant strand of it, the state is seen as a restraining influence on an individual?s freedom and on his desire to be the complete master of his own life. Advocates of the state as an arbiter of human affairs see the state as a regulator of human desires and freedoms in the name of the greater good of the collective. Proponents of euthanasia argue in favour of taking death (in cases of terminally-ill patients) outside the domain of law and the state. They claim that it is an individual?s life and when an individual is certain that he can go on living only with the help of machines and without dignity, he should have the right to die when he chooses. There is no higher ethic, they argue, than the freedom of choice to die with dignity. This extreme case of individual freedom ? extreme because an individual, by choosing euthanasia, exercises a freedom to end all freedoms ? has put law-makers in most countries in a quandary. Euthanasia, in legal terms, is a hard case and thus makes for bad laws.

 In India, the case for euthanasia is complicated by societal realities which could leave it open to gross abuse. The judiciary is justified in its lack of confidence in cherished Indian institutions like the family. There is always the fear that greedy relatives might mislead a widow in order to grab her property. There is the fear, given the nature of medical facilities available in India, that the term ?terminally ill? may not be properly used and valued. The levels of education and enlightenment in India do not suggest that the arguments for and implications of euthanasia will be properly understood and appreciated. In India, there will always be the danger that euthanasia will not be the affirmation of individual choice that it is supposed to represent.

 Venkatesh?s plea, in a way, highlighted one aspect of the fear of abuse. He predicated his wish to die on his desire to donate his organs. Traffic in human organs is one of the most pernicious and lucrative trades that are known. Venkatesh?s wish to die was thus based, not on the argument of dignity and choice, but on the pursuit of do-gooding. He wanted to die to benefit others. This cannot be the basis for euthanasia, which is premised upon more sophisticated notions than that of sacrifice and goodwill.

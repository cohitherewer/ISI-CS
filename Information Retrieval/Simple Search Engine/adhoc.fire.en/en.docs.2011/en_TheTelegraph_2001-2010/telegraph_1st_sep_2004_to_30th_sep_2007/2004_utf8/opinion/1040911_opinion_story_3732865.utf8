 Letters to Editor

 Things people say

 Sir ? Kate Winslet, somewhat infamous for her sharp tongue, has shown that she has a way with words too. She has been telling the press that her becoming a mother had enabled her to take on roles that would otherwise be beyond her (?Motherhood good for career, says Kate?, Sep 7). True as it may be, is it also not true that her ?career? had taken a downturn after her sole hit, Titanic? And that she was not exactly plagued with offers before she bagged the one she is gushing about now, in Finding Neverland?

 Yours faithfully,

Poulomi Roy, Calcutta

 Cheap thrills 

 Sir ? The description of the first-year students? ragging at the School of Planning and Architecture in New Delhi is both shocking and disgusting (?Perversion twist to ragging?, Aug 27). It is now obvious that the general tendency of college authorities to play down ragging incidents and the absence of a Central legislation to classify ragging as criminal offence are responsible for the perpetuation of ragging in Indian colleges. The National Human Rights Commission ought to grill the SPA principal to get to the truth of the matter because letting the students off with just a fine and suspension casts considerable doubt on the gravity of the situation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? I have endured and witnessed brutal ragging as a student in a professional college and have observed certain things. It is more often the case that the effect of ragging on a young person of 18 or 19, who is away from home for the first time, is seriously underestimated. Coping with the pressures of academics and adjusting to an alien environment are difficult and daunting enough. And ragging, in these circumstances, is often the straw that breaks the camel?s back. Even a petty or otherwise innocent harassment becomes intolerable, to say nothing of the brutal and sadistic torture of the sort that the students of the SPA were subjected to. 

 Again, it is simplistic to say that one who is ragged will rag in turn. I have seen many of my seniors who did not rag anyone; nor did many of us rag our juniors. There were still others who subjected their juniors to worse humiliation than what they were subjected to. Such kind of behaviour is a psychological aberration and weeding out students displaying such behaviour is a better idea than punishing them with suspension and fines. Such ?punishments? are unlikely to change the students. 

 It is also true that ragging can never find a place in any institution without the covert support of the staff, who prefer to look the other way and never interfere unless they are forced to. Students can, and do, turn to their senior for help in academics and this very fact deters them to make official complaints against ragging. In sum, unless attitudes change, ragging will persist as just another ill in the Indian academic set-up.

 Yours faithfully,

B. Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir ? Many among those who rag know where to draw the line. However, many of them are also immature enough to cross it. This often leads to stubborn stances being taken by both the raggers and the victims. Ego clashes follow invariably ? the offenders are driven by an urge to put the juniors in place. And it is usually the case that students who get ragged accept the inevitability of the situation and adapt accordingly. 

 Dissuasion of complaints, by threat or by use of force, affects the victims psychologically. The offenders get affected when they are rusticated. Given that the effects of ragging are all extreme and irremediable, strict anti-ragging laws ought to be introduced and implemented in all states at the earliest. 

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Roy, Calcutta

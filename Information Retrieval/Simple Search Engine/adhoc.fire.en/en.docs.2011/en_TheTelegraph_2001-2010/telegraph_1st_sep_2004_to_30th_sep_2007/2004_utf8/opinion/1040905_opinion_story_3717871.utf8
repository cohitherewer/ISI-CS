 DIARY

 Dharam Singh might be congratulating himself for the finesse with which he first lured the fire-spewing sadhvi from her lair and then dropped her like a hot potato. But there might be a different and quite unlikely hero behind all the drama a 1984-batch IAS officer from Karnataka, a favourite of the former Madhya Pradesh CM. The MP government had requisitioned his services a month back and the request was about to be granted when the Hubli court directive changed it all. This was the third time such a thing was happening. The said officer had served Uma in the youth affairs ministry during the Vajpayee era, only for a month though, since the PM changed the sadhvis portfolio soon. Apparently, Uma then asked the officer to join her in the coal ministry. But by the time the formalities were completed, Uma had been divested of the portfolio and instructed to hit the road for the MP poll campaign. Polls over, and firmly ensconced in the CMs chair after seven months, Uma had thought the time was right to beckon the civil servant to boost the handloom sector. Destiny obviously read the message differently.

 Destiny again. And the hasmukh chief minister of Maharashtra, Sushil Kumar Shinde, was found elaborating on his to policemen on one of his visits to the state police headquarters a few days back. It is quite another matter why the CM has found it necessary to see policemen instead of voters on the eve of the state assembly polls. Anyway, Shinde seems to have reminisced before his men in uniform how about 33 years ago, when he had joined the intelligence wing of the Mumbai police, he had taken on the responsibility of keeping an eye on a cartoonist who had floated a political party called the Shiv Sena. Three decades later, he said (and here the policemen seem to have been expected to nod their heads in approval) he felt that he was still doing the job. Keep at it Shinde!

 Olympian Aslam Sher Khan has taken the longest jump ever. A national hockey selector, Khan wonders why we cannot opt for decentralization and restructuring when such reforms have become the mantra of success in IT, communication, industry and so on. The former sportsman is supposed to have asked the PM to scrap the Union sports ministry altogether. This is not to spite Sunil Dutt, obviously, but Khan is merely thinking of how the ministry has become a bureaucratic stronghold and a source of foreign junkets for ministers. Well thought, Khan. How about the other ministries?

 Gun ho! The gun culture seems to have permeated Indian politics so widely that politicians suffer from deep depression and identity crisis if they are denied security cover. Congressman Lal Singh, who had defeated the BJPs Chamanlal Gupta in Udhampur, made his insecurities public at the budget session in parliament, saying he felt threatened as he was within target range of Kashmiri militants. His complaint was heeded and he was given a pistol for his safety. On arriving at Jammu to a rapturous welcome, Singh proudly took out his gun and fired at the ground, probably to impress the gathering. That was when it all happened. The bullet recoiled, and went back at Singh, grazing his leg. He was promptly hospitalized. When the local police force rushed to take a written statement of the injured man, Lal Singh recoiled in horror, fearing his toy would be taken away. In a desperate attempt to shoo away the policemen, Singh is known to have quipped, The pistol is mine, the leg is mine. 

 Whats up guys? Manmohan Singh should have a similar question for his party members, particularly after the goof-up at the recent AICC session. While the text of Sonia Gandhis speech was given out in advance to the media, the PMs was not handed out despite repeated requests from scribes. The media sec, Tom Vadakkan, argued that the PIB was supposed to provide it. When he was told the PIB couldnt have, he passed on the buck to the PMO, which apparently was still in the process of preparing it. There was however no sign of it, and journos were asked to download it from the net. Just a faux pas?

 This is one infection Arjun Singh likes his predecessors practice of receiving the high and mighty in his ministry, be it the FM, the planning commission bosses and so on. Barring of course, Pranabda. Too mighty for Singh to take on?

 Should we call it doctoring the doctor? Senior doctors at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences are apparently aghast at the chutzpah of the Union health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss. His earlier adventure of appropriating the AIIMS guest house till he got his accommodation in a suitable ministerial bungalow had already upset the fraternity of doctors. Now Ramadoss is supposed to have made it his business to let medicos know that as a qualified doctor, he knew as much as anyone of them about health and medicine. That Ramadoss should deign to advise none other than a renowned surgeon like Dr P. Venugopal, who has taken over as director of AIIMS, is found to be most disconcerting. The doctor is reportedly the only Indian surgeon till date to have successfully done a heart transplant at AIIMS. Docs feel that such a doc could certainly do without Ramadosss help. Ramadoss obviously has a different prescription.

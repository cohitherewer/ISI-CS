 TRIED AND TESTED

 Robert Bruce had a point, but it seems to have inspired the wrong kind of effort. The Constitution expressly warns against discrimination on the basis of religion, since India is a secular nation. But reservations for Muslims have repeatedly been proposed, on the premise that most members of the minority community are underprivileged. This is a deliberate confusion of principles, one that the Andhra Pradesh high court has indirectly pointed out while striking down the state government?s order providing 5 per cent reservation for Muslims. It has directed the chief minister, Mr Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, to set up a new backward class commission, which would be able to monitor reservations in order to see that the ?creamy layer? is eliminated. The emphasis, therefore, is on lack of privilege springing from economic backwardness, rather than from belonging to a particular community of which most members are underprivileged. The court has found the survey of the minority commission unsatisfactory, on top of the fact that the report was not made after consultations with the backward class commission.

 The politics of backwardness has turned out to be rather shameless in India. Reservations within a fixed time frame for underprivileged groups are one thing, and a purposeful attempt to provide sops in return for votes is quite another. The Congress government in Andhra Pradesh has not made itself popular by muffing this up. It does not get its vote bank, but gets laughed at by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad which filed the public interest litigation against the order, and is also told that its defence of the order in court was deliberately weak. The government may have been quite serious in its desire to help the underprivileged, but it should have known that confusing the principles of minority religion and economic backwardness would lead to failure. Suspicions about its motive are inevitable. This also gives the Bharatiya Janata Party a handle to bring up ?appeasement? and ?half-measures?, words that denote the Congress?s incompetence and also help to ignite the religious chauvinism among the majority community. Ultimately, though, the local issue is not as important as the principle behind the judgment. Selecting the underprivileged should be ?scientific?, and not based on reasons of political expediency or correctness.

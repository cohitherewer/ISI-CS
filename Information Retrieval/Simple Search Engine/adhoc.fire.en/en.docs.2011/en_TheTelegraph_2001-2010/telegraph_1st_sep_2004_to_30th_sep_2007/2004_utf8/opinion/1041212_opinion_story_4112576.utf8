 Letters to Editor

 A quiet hero

 Sir ?The muted celebrations around Anil Kumble?s achievement are, perhaps, symptomatic of the kind of man he is (?Mind more free now?, Dec 11). Kumble has always been the one to go about his job quietly instead of basking in the adulation of his fans. This has enabled him to scale greater heights unlike someone like the young Parthiv Patel who let success go to his head. Had Patel, like Kumble, not rested on his laurels, he wouldn?t have been cooling his heels off the field while his team is busy touring Bangladesh. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Ronobir Mitra, Calcutta

 Tread with caution

 Sir ? The security threat to Indian cricketers is much more severe in Bangladesh than in Pakistan. It was the personal involvement of Pervez Musharraf, his active interest in the game, his posturings for the promotion of friendship, and in consequence, the guarantee of quality intelligence, as also popular support that made India?s tour of Pakistan earlier this year incident-free. But this is not the case with Bangladesh. There has been no words of solace from the Bangladesh prime minister herself. Besides, we must remember that the political situation is very fluid in Bangladesh, where intelligence agencies have not managed to curb jihadi activities. 

 Nothing could be more heinous than connecting the Gujarat carnage with cricket. How will the killing of Indian cricketers avenge the injustice? Moreover, it should be pointed out that a majority of Indians have already shown their anger against the perpetrators of the crime in various ways. Indian courts are also doing a fine job by trying to bring justice to victims. The threat is thus unjustified. Do the jihadis realize that dead cricketers will do no good to the people in India they wish to show their sympathy with?

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The recent threat by the declared terrorist outfit, Harkat-ul Jihad, to the Indian cricket team should not be taken lightly. One can never forget the tense moments during the recent border dispute with Bangladesh, when Indian soldiers were gunned down. During one test tour of Sri Lanka, New Zealand cricketers received similar threats from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The New Zealand cricket boards assessed the situation first and the wellbeing of the team members before sending the players. Let us hope the Indian cricket board has been as thorough as its New Zealand counterpart in assessing the situation in Bangladesh.

 Yours faithfully, 

R. Sekar, Angul

 Sir ? It must be abundantly clear that the danger posed by the Islamic militant groups in Bangladesh is not a figment of the imagination. Those who have been harping on the futility of the American war against terrorism will now realize that they have completely misunderstood the nature of the problem. At least now they can stop complaining that the United States of America has been shadow-boxing. In India, the threat to the Indian cricket team should make the critics of terrorist laws like the former Prevention of Terrorism Act or the current unlawful activities (prevention) bill, think twice about their objections. One also hopes that Bangladesh is sincere in its efforts to make foolproof arrangements for the security of the visiting Indian team. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

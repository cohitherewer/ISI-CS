 AFTER THE LAST PAGE IS READ

 Remnants of a rich past

The Moth Eaten Howdah Of The Tusker 

By Indira Goswami, 

Rupa, Rs 395

It is true that much is lost through translation. 

But if a work is rich in its content, its essence will be conveyed even after 

being translated. Indira Goswami?s The Moth Eaten Howdah Of The Tusker is 

one such work that impresses in spite of the translation. Reading her novel is, 

as Bhisham Sahni puts it, ?an unforgettable experience?. The book captivates the 

reader, evokes a sense of awe and continues to haunt and probe the mind, long 

after the last page is turned.

 The novel is set ?at the dawn of Independence? in a sattra, a Vaishnavite monastery, in south Kamrup in Assam. In the narrative, Goswami portrays the religious and spiritual heads of the sattras being threatened of their authority by the rising popularity of the Communists. Indranath, the future satradhikar (head of the sattra), is a sensitive youth who is caught in this tragic moment of transition, a tussle between tradition and modernity. The howdah and the majestic tusker here are symbols of the gossain?s tradition and authority. The moth-eaten howdah and the death of the sattra?s last tusker, Jaganath, work as a powerful image in expressing the latent tragedy of the tale. 

 Inter-woven with the main narrative is a poignant tale of the miseries of women, especially the widows in the sattra. The tragedies of Durga, Giribala and Saru gossainee are different threads of the narrative. Once woven together, they work as a comment and critique of the plight of the Brahmin widows. The widows are forced to follow mindless rituals ? and their life becomes an endless process of killing desires until their entire entity is, as it were, erased. Giribala?s death in a way invokes the agnipariksha of Sita. The woman is forced to purify herself at every stage until she consigns herself to fire. 

 The narrative has a tragic quality, enhanced with the sensuous and poignant descriptions of nature. Descriptions like ??The colour of mud walls seemed to him the same as the dull, brownish-grey colour of a vulture?s feathers. The pulp of red pumpkins with their seeds lay rotting and drying on the tattered thatched roofs like blotches of dried reddish-brown blood. He could smell the odor of pan leaves being fried over a fire. Indranath had a feeling of walking in a graveyard?, reveal a kind of primeval beauty in the decay that overbears the atmosphere. 

 Numerous words used in the narrative are from the Kamrupi dialect. And the reader has to refer to the notes to understand the text. This does interrupt smooth reading but adds a lilt to the narrative, thereby making the language a perfect medium for the unfolding of a tragedy. Goswami uses both native words and almost archaic English words like ?espied? ? however, this style is not jarring. In fact, this curious usage makes the language appear distant. This effect in turn enhances the tragic environment.

 Goswami creates before us a world that is distant, but one which becomes a part of the reader?s life. Not only the story but also words and phrases from her narrative are thought-provoking. To take an example, ?Only the one who goes alone, who walks alone, can find out whatever he wants to know?, is rich in meaning even when taken out of context of the novel.

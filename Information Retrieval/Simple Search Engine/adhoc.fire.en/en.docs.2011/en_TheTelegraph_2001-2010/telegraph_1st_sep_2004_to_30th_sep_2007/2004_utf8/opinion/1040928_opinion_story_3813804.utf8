 MEETING POINT

 The positive outcome of the meeting between India?s prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, and Pakistan?s president, Mr Pervez Musharraf, will be widely welcomed. It would be na?ve, however, to believe that a breakthrough in India-Pakistan relations is about to happen. Expectations of a dramatic turnaround in bilateral relations after single meetings are based on a lack of a real understanding of the history of India-Pakistan relations. Indeed, it is only through a slow process of incremental steps that peace and stability can be achieved in the region. Few could, however, have expected that the first meeting between the new Indian prime minister and the Pakistani president would be as successful. Mr Manmohan Singh termed the meeting as historic and one which could lead to a new beginning in relations between New Delhi and Islamabad. In fact, the joint statement, which emerged after the meeting, may well be counted as an important marker in India-Pakistan relations. Both India and Pakistan have agreed to strive to restore normalcy in the spirit of the January 6, 2004 statement signed by the then prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and Mr Musharraf in Islamabad. 

 The two sides have also agreed that confidence-building measures of all categories under discussion between the two governments should be implemented as soon as possible. Although there is no explicit mention of cross-border terrorism, it is clearly implied in the reference to the January 6 statement, which categorically commits Pakistan not to allow territory under its control to be used by terrorists against India. The statement also commits the two sides to a dialogue on Jammu and Kashmir and to evaluating all possible options for a peaceful negotiated settlement of the issue. It is unfortunate that sections of the Bharatiya Janata Party have criticized the prime minister for bringing Jammu and Kashmir to the forefront. This criticism is short-sighted and unwarranted. India, for some time now, and especially during the last few months of the BJP-led government, has been willing to engage Pakistan in a dialogue on Jammu and Kashmir. This is based on a few assumptions: most important, that the Pakistan government needs a dialogue on Jammu and Kashmir to satisfy domestic constituencies. Moreover, the process of dialogue would lead to a realization within Islamabad that there is no quick solution to the Kashmir problem, and the process of talking itself would help to create an atmosphere of stability. 

 In other words, Mr Singh has only built on the policies of his predecessor. In this sense, the New York meeting reflects continuity rather than change. The road forward will hardly be easy, but at least a good beginning has been made.

 PLAYING FOR PRIDE AND PASSION

 India?s dismal showing in Athens was not surprising. But a sporting boom appears to be round the corner, writes Uttam Sengupta

 Killed with generosity

 Sixteen tribal schoolboys boarded a train to New Delhi in 1977. Barring two, none of the boys had ever seen a train, let alone board one. They represented the hockey team of S.S. High School, Khunti, then a subdivisional town 30 kilometres from Ranchi. Their mission: to play in the junior Nehru Cup tournament. 

 Most of them had grown up playing hockey with crude, home-made sticks. Some played for their village in the inter-village Khassi tournaments, in which the prize would usually be a goat. This lot were lucky to have received professional coaching at school, which had been recognized as a resource centre by the then National Institute of Sports, Patiala. But this was the first time they were venturing out of their little hamlet. 

 Most of them were unfamiliar with shoes, preferring to play barefoot or at best in canvas shoes. Some of the organizers felt sorry for them but many more were clearly bemused. The scorn, however, gave way to admiration as the boys played uninhibited hockey, completely baffling their opponents and dazzling the few spectators who would turn up. 

 When they reached the semi-final, even newspapers were forced to pay some attention. And then, miracle of miracles, they were actually through to the finals. It was to be a face-off between the combined West German schools? team and the boys from Khunti. The two teams were invited to a reception by the West German ambassador. The tribal boys did not have to follow German to understand that they were getting condescending looks. To add to their woes, their regular goalkeeper had fallen ill and was ruled out for the finals. 

 That night, recalled their coach later, the boys assured him that they would win the next day. And they did. Neither poverty nor lack of exposure or physical training and facilities could come in their way. They suffered from malnutrition, came from poor families but played for pleasure. Medal-hunt was not their priority. 

 Their spectacular performance in Delhi was also a turning point. Talent scouts from para-military outfits and other organizations descended on the hamlet and whisked away many of the players with the lure of lowly-paid jobs in the Border Security Force or the Railways. Their education incomplete, the boys played dazzling hockey for a few years and then burnt out. The rest of their lives, the 22-, 24- or 26-year-olds were destined to spend as semi-literate sepoys or guards with nothing to look forward to. The amazing but tragic story of these tribal boys flashed through the mind as one watched the Indian hockey team play in the Athens Olympic Games. 

 Norman Pritchard from Calcutta was on a vacation in France when he was persuaded to participate in the Paris Olympics of 1900. He won two silver medals in athletics. Since that somewhat fortuitous beginning, India has stumbled from one Olympic to another, winning far fewer medals than smaller and poorer countries like Ethiopia, Burundi or Costa Rica. It should never have come as a surprise because the absolute number of serious sportspersons in the country has never been very large. 

 Without the ?critical mass?, it becomes difficult to select the best for international competitions. The probability of one thousand archers throwing up winners will always be less than the probability of that from ten thousand archers engaged in serious archery. Both policies and social attitudes, however, come in the way of achieving that critical mass. One can only cite the example of a few thousand privileged young people who throng the nightclubs every evening in the Indian metros. They have, arguably, the time and the money to spend on leisure but not the inclination for even elitist games like squash or billiards. Deserted playgrounds in colleges and universities also bear testimony to the general indifference among the youth to any kind of sporting activity. Barring two or three states, a tiny minority of students in the entire country play hockey. Yet, the national aspiration is for the hockey team to be world-beaters. 

 Many of those who do take sports seriously in schools and colleges, do so for certificates they can use for various concessions under the ?sports quota?. The ?quota system?, which continues to thrive in Indian sports, influences sporting activities in various ways. The government of India, for example, sanctioned in 2002-03 a grant of Rs 27 lakh to the All India Football Federation, but Rs 30 lakh for the billiards body. The fencing federation ended up getting Rs 80 lakh and squash Rs 96 lakh. There was clearly no method in the madness. Even the Wushu association (most would wonder what it might be) was granted Rs 75 lakh while the tug of war federation got Rs 16 lakh. Much has already been written about federations and how undemocratic they are and how they distribute favours to the chosen few. But while cleansing the federations is important, it is even more necessary to ensure that young people take to sports and play for pleasure first. Medals can follow.

 Indian swimmer Shikha Tandon was eliminated in the heats at Athens while Anju Bobby George came sixth in the finals in long jump. But the difference between them and the eventual gold-medal winners was just about three seconds in swimming and 24 centimetres in long jump. 

 The gap between Indian and international athletes is narrowing steadily and there is certainly hope on the horizon. We do, however, need to take stock of policies, strategy and systems that we have put in place. We have flirted, half-heartedly, with both the Soviet strategy of nurturing sporting talent with military drill as well as with the American model of allowing sports to evolve into a multi-billion dollar industry. The Indian army launched Operation Olympic Medals and set up an Army Sports Institute at Pune three years ago. The ASI identified disciplines like boxing, archery, rowing, shooting, weightlifting and sailing, in which it felt Indians stood a chance of winning medals. Young boys have been identified and rounded up from all over the country, given the rank of havildar, and are being trained, some by foreign coaches. 

 A better strategy would have been to first train Indian coaches abroad. The government too has become generous towards the chosen few. The Indian hockey team went off to the United States of America for a fitness camp, ahead of Athens. The lifters took off for Belarus while the shooters went to Europe. The 16 members of the hockey team, according to reports, were selected at Dusseldorf by 13 officials who flew to Germany for the serious business of team-selection. 

 There are other indications to suggest that the Indian industry is finally waking up to the potential of sports other than cricket to generate both revenue and employment. The tie-up between the Indian Olympic Association and the Confederation of Indian Industry to promote Olympic sports and surveys on Indian sports done by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Price Waterhouse-Coopers India are welcome pointers, never mind the latter?s prediction that India would return with at least ten medals from Athens. 

 The government needs to concentrate on creating infrastructure and training facilities so that enough trained physiotherapists and coaches, groundsmen and sports administrators are produced to cater to the boom which appears round the corner. The concern for medals and bids for the 2016 games should wait till we succeed in managing the basics.

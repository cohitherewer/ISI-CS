 THE PHANTOMS OF THE WAR

 Looking at Iraq now, N.J. Nanporia wonders if the non-existent WMDs might have been a secret between Saddam and Bush

 Down, but not out

 In the aftermath of the attack on Iraq, countless questions have been asked without acceptable answers being found for any of them. Among these, the most inexplicable, and the one that invites controlled speculation, runs as follows. Given that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction, why didn?t he open up his country to full inspection by the United Nations and avoid the devastation, chaos and humiliation of apparent defeat? Supplementing this is a related question: why did he do everything possible to suggest that he had something to hide, and go through the motions of fending off increasing pressure from the West and the UN?

 One tentative answer from Hans Blix was that Saddam suffered from a ?fixation with Iraqi notions of honour?. Perhaps ?honour? was a factor in the Iraqi leader?s calculations, as also the prestige he derived and enjoyed from the nuclear status that it was widely presumed Iraq had acquired. It could be said that both the United States of America and Saddam cooperated, for different reasons, in building up the myth of a WMD-armed Iraq. As part of this myth, the US spoke of ?shock and awe? and Saddam of a ?mother of all battles? ? neither of which were borne out by the scenario that unfolded. The sporadic Iraqi resistance was stage-managed and though sufficiently determined to surprise the Americans, confirmed their belief that no ?mother of all battles? was about to take place.

 Lines of communication were attacked; Iraqi troops and irregulars were, in the words of General Richard B. Myers, ?tenacious, audacious and ferocious?; and complaints were heard that the ?enemy we are fighting is a bit different than the one we war-gamed against?. Yet all this did not discourage the Americans from penetrating deeper into Iraq. In the intoxication of the rapid advance on Baghdad, the coalition noticed ? as everyone else did but did not account for ? a series of ?vanishing acts?. The presidential guards did not resist; the generals ordered Iraqi forces to ?cease fighting and pull back?. The 51st Iraqi division ?surrendered?, only to reappear. Other forces ?melted away? while Saddam?s cousins reportedly ordered them ?not to fight against the US-led coalition?. The word ?phantom? occurs in the war coverage of this period to describe the disappearing act; and this in turn led the Americans to believe what they were always inclined to believe ? that the resistance, though initially stubborn, would, in Dick Cheney?s words, collapse like a ?house of cards?.

 This belief was further fuelled by the Iraqi failure to blow up the oil fields and key bridges, or to destroy the dams to flood the trails of the American advance. Though a bit puzzled, the Americans explained this away as a failure of Iraqi morale, even as a confirmation that the Iraqis welcomed the intervention that would topple an oppressive dictator. No wonder then that the rapid American advance on the capital, one of the fastest in the chronicles of war, was acclaimed as a ?stunning? achievement and at the cost of negligible casualities. The supposed architect of this ?success?, Donald Rumsfeld, was effusively congratulated and the technique of a swift, high-technology and concentrated attack was elevated to the status of a new doctrine of war. Euphoria, even at this stage, was sustained by the deeply-rooted conviction that the invaders would be widely ?welcomed? by the Iraqis and that their attack would be followed by uprisings by the Kurds and the Shias.

 In the context of what is happening in Iraq now, with insurgency rising by the day, it is impossible not to conclude that Saddam deliberately and calculatedly trapped the Americans in the quagmire Iraq has turned out to be. He understood that whatever he did or failed to do, the Bush regime was committed to attack, that he was faced with a war he could not hope to win. In short, as John Scarlett, the former British chairman of the joint intelligence committee and since promoted head of MI6, has pointed out, ?Hussein made fools of Western agents.? But if Saddam knew that the coalition would attack ? irrespective of anything, he also knew that George W. Bush probably knew that Iraq had no WMDs.

 Is it conceivable that Iraq would have been attacked at the risk of inviting a retaliation by possible WMDs? While, for Saddam, the non-possession of WMDs was his ?secret? weapon that drew America into the quagmire, Bush?s ?secret? was that, though he publicly denounced Saddam for hoarding WMDs, privately he was motivated to attack by Saddam?s WMD innocence. A dim awareness of this was responsible for the reports of a ?deal? between Bush and Saddam. This is improbable as a fully-conscious, deliberately-negotiated agreement; it is less improbable as an intuitive understanding of each other?s motives. Saddam had declared, ?If they come we are ready. We will fight them in the streets, from the roof-tops, house to house. We will not surrender.? What sounded at the time as war-time rhetoric now emerges as a truthful blue-print of how the Iraqis planned their resistance.

 Not long ago, Bush had announced that the US had ?kicked the Vietnam syndrome?. But from the rapidly multiplying evidence, it is obvious that it hasn?t. The upshot ? the entire tragedy of Iraq is founded on a pack of lies. The accusation that Iraq had WMDs and was about to attack the West was a lie. Saddam?s insinuation that he had WMD status was a lie. The conventional resistance in the opening stages of the war was a deception. There was no pre-emption because there was nothing to pre-empt. There was no shattering failure of Western intelligence insofar as its unpublicized conclusion ? that Iraq was in no position to launch an attack on anyone ? was the basis for Bush?s unilateral act. Saddam misled the Americans into anticipating a conventional war, in which the advantage was overwhelmingly in favour of the US and the Bush administration. Meanwhile, Saddam prepared for an indefinite guerrilla campaign going far beyond the formal end of the war, seemingly symbolized by the toppling of his statue. Attack the coalition forces, Saddam said, in small numbers and when their advance slows, attack them again.

 This is what is happening, with the coalition forces tied down in a situation from which there is no visible exit other than an ignominious retreat. The Pentagon claimed that it had put together the ?finest plan in military history, a plan covering every contingency?. What it overlooked was the small matter of a classical guerrilla campaign by a resistance, fuelled by nationalist as well as Islamic sentiment, and with the support of all those insurgency organizations everywhere whom the Bush regime has so successfully provoked.

 A sense of the reality behind the illusion was awakened by the circumstances in which Saddam was discovered in his spider hole. Western opinion on the issue of Saddam?s future had alternated between killing him outright and bringing him to justice ? with an ill-concealed preference for the first and only a routine doffing of the cap to the second. Rumsfeld had even admitted that ?the chances of stumbling on him are zero?. Yet that was what allegedly happened and the Americans now face the unpleasant prospect of a trial in which some disagreeable disclosures are likely to be made. Uday and Qusay were summarily shot down ? why was Saddam spared? How much simpler it would have been for Washington if the father had met with a similar fate. That it didn?t lends credence to reports that Saddam was found, not by the Americans, but by the Kurds who then brokered a deal with Bush?s people.

 The video footage of Saddam?s capture shows American soldiers ?stumbling? across the entrance to the spider hole, with a piling on of circumstantial detail that seems suspiciously overdone. Throughout the Iraqi affair, the line between information and disinformation has been blurred to the point where nothing is what it seems. The Kurds, it must be assumed, had far better chances of discovering Saddam than the Americans. They had, and have, the advantage of local knowledge. They would have welcomed the prospect of getting some leverage for a bargain with the Americans, who in turn would have good reason to keep the true story of the capture under wraps. 

 How else to explain Bush?s opting for a trial of Saddam under ?Iraqi? jurisdiction, with all the complications and embarrassments this might entail? That Saddam wasn?t killed as soon as he was found is a story surrounded and suppressed by a conspiracy of silence. Many may wonder how a man denounced as a tyrant, a monster and a thug can ever expect a fair trial. The fiction that he will get one is yet another lie among many others.

 KILL THE NEW BILL

 Gyan Pathak

 The Lok Sabha has finally scrapped the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act, but made way for another controversy in the form of the unlawful activities (prevention) bill. Whether the opposition blocks the passage of the bill in the Rajya Sabha is not important. The real question is ? what will this new bill achieve?

 That question, however, seems to have been put on the backburner by the bill?s critics. Although the National Democratic Alliance, as also some allies of the United Progressive Alliance object to the bill, they, in their own ways, facilitated its passage in the Lok Sabha. The former staged a walk-out and the left abstained from voting. Yet a decisive negative vote could have killed the bill. 

 The left, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party believe that certain provisions of the new legislation are similar to Pota?s and run the risk of being misused. Pranab Mukherjee and Shivraj Patil have promised to hold detailed consultations with MPs after the passage of the bill. But does the bill need to be passed before the government holds consultations?

 Lame duck

 The excuse for bringing the new bill is the same as that for Pota ? to fight terrorism. Pota lasted 32 months despite the trouble taken by the BJP to get it approved at a special joint session of Parliament after the bill failed in the upper house. But it could not curb terrorism. On top of it there were allegations of it being anti-minority and a convenient political tool against rival politicians. 

 Pota gave the state unbridled powers to deal with any suspect. Confessions to the police made admissible evidence in court, the accused could be kept in custody for a year without bail or judicial scrutiny, and the onus was on him to prove his innocence. The BJP government later bowed to public pressure and gave statutory powers to review committees which could be approached by individuals.

 Repealing Pota was a promise that the UPA had to keep. But this does not justify replacing one controversial bill with another. The problems of terrorism cannot be resolved by a new bill, particularly one that is first implemented stealthily by an ordinance and then passed without discussion. Also, remember, it was during the time of Poto, the predecessor of Pota, that the attack on Parliament happened. The law in itself did not prevent the attack. It merely gave officials, indifferent to their responsibilities, the power to save their skin. 

 As before

 Another reason why the UPA thought of one more such act is international. According to a UN resolution of 2001, all signatory countries are required to have some anti-terrorist acts. But this act is just as lame as any, and as prone to misuse. The definition of ?terrorism? is wide; most of the offences covered by it relating to the use of explosives, disruption of public order, destruction of property, sedition and so on are already made punishable under various laws. There is an overlapping of definitions and confusion in matters of ?conspiracy? and alleged support for ?terrorism?.

 Another problem is the bill?s jurisdiction. It has been extended to activities outside the country. But extra-territorial jurisdiction can be effective only when other countries enact similar laws and give us right of jurisdiction. As for banning organizations, the same problem remains. The Supreme Court recently struck down the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami-Hind. Even in the case of the Students? Islamic Movement in India, the government failed to justify the ban. As for the telephone tapping, the ambiguity persists despite the Supreme Court guideline in 1997. Critics even say that the provisions of the new bill in some matters are more dangerous than those of Pota. Do we need it then?

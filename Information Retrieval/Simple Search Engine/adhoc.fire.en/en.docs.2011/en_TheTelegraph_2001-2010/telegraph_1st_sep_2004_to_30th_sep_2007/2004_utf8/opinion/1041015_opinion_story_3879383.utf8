 RIGHT FROM THE WORD GO

The Ancient Olympics 

By Nigel Spivey, Oxford, pound;16.99

Nigel Spivey teaches classical art and archaeology 

at the University of Cambridge and is eminently qualified to write a book that 

brings to the fore the social mores and the political agendas connected with the 

ancient Olympic games in Greece.

 In this well-researched book, Spivey clears some common misconceptions connected with the ancient Hellenic games. The perceived notion is that the ancient Olympic games were competitions which promoted philosophy, spread goodwill and brought together warring states. Noth- ing can be farther from the truth. The ancient games were no occasion for relaxation or frolic. They had in them all the features of modern Olympics ? poli- tical intrigue, social upheaval, regional prejudices, deceit and treachery.

 Whoever says that the ancient Olympics upheld the best of human values knows little of what went on behind the scenes. Even Pierre de Coubertin*, the French aristocrat who is the architect of modern Olympics, did not quite fathom the rivalry and enmity that the ancient games at Olympia generated.

 Winning was what mattered at the games. Performers were willing to pay any price, even to die, in order to win because winning meant glory, understanding and cooperation between the city-states. The arena was highly politicized with neither the competitors nor the city-states willing to make any concession or compromise. However, Spivey at the same time maintains that despite the heat of battle and the intense competition, the Olympics at least exhibited an aura of civilized existence. In the author?s words, it was ?war minus the shooting?.

 The Olympic games as an institution has a long, awesome and distinctive heritage. Yet, over the years, the ancient Olympic games have not received due attention from researchers. Currently, emphasis is laid mostly on the modern version of the Olympic ideology at the cost of authenticity of the ancient ideals. This has led to a myopic, disbalanced outlook.

 Spivey?s work is a pioneering effort. He has dug deep into the legend of the Hellenic culture to reveal traces of social behaviour, political acts and the aesthetic appeal of classical antiquity. He has expanded the mythology of Olympia by which the Greeks elevated sporting prowess to heroic status.

 Questions as to whether there was any link between athletics and military training, did the Romans change the existing ethos, was emperor Nero really an Olympic champion would surely appeal to discerning readers.

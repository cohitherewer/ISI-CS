 VICTIM OF ITS OWN SUCCESS

 Gouri Chatterjee

 If you had dismissed the shimmering, shiny red screen behind the Aaj Tak newsreader as some tacky interior decorator?s idea of a bad joke, don?t. To Aaj Tak?s bosses ?the colour red is being used predominantly to signify the speed of news delivery?. If that leaves you wondering, you are not alone. Maybe someone there remembers the bright red pillar boxes the Indian postal service had when snail mail was sabse tez. 

 If Aaj Tak?s much-touted image makeover fails to galvanize its flagging popularity, it will not, however, be the fault of the new studio and the touched-up logo and the new faces, etc. the channel launched this Monday. It?ll be because Aaj Tak remains a victim of its own success. It is the Hindi channel all its rivals have copied so that now there is little to choose between one and another. And the new-look Aaj Tak is just that. And that can never be enough.

 For any one to stand out among the gaggle of similar-looking, similar-sounding, similarly-formatted Hindi news channels, it has to have a dramatically different content. One that takes a stand and stands for something. Not like at present, when all the channels seem to be in favour of a free market and a strong Centre and other such concepts. Does anyone really believe India is so homogeneous? 

 Of course, that?s the channels playing safe. And as long as they try to keep everyone happy, we?re stuck with news studios that will look more and more like Bollywood sets. Nitiin Desai, the set designer of Devdas, has already designed one for a news channel.

 Tainted tribal

 You can take a tribal out of his forest, but you can?t take the tribal out of him. So Shibu Soren believed you could stand for elections, become an MP, go to Delhi ? and thereby become part of the mainstream. That?s the tribal in him, simple, na?ve, trusting. Still wondering why the press is ready to put him in the headlines but not give him a hearing at all. Why the press will parrot the charges against him but not investigate what he did wrong. 

 Soren obviously has a lot to learn. Such as that tribals are of interest to the mainstream press only as long as they remain true to character: wild, uncontrolled, uncivilized. So the press would rather not know that Soren was only paying tribute to a tribal leader when he allegedly violated section 144 in 1999 (one of the charges that make him ?tainted?). Or that his 1999 violation of the People?s Representation Act (making him ?tainted? yet again) really amounts to a missing printline in some of his election posters. Or that Soren hardly ?ordered? the killing of 11 people in Chirudih (as ?reported? in a recent cover story of India Today on tainted ministers) but had simply addressed a meeting which was attacked and fired on, which led to rioting and the death of 11 people.

 Poor Soren can?t even crib. Jharkhand high court may cancel his bail. And there is nothing in the papers his lordship reads or the TV he watches that could give him a different image of tribals, even one the Santhals revere like a god.

 Sex and style

 What is the feminine gender of chairman? Or spokesman? Easy. Chairperson or spokesperson. Obviously you have learnt your English from newspapers and news channels. That?s the media?s way of expressing gender sensitivity. Now, the American news agency (wire service in Americanese) has decided to call a spade a spade, or a woman a woman. The 2004 AP stylebook (last revised in 1977), asks correspondents to use ?spokesman/ spokeswoman?. Why it isn?t ?spokesperson? for all I don?t know. It could be that AP feared the men might protest. The stylebook does say, ?Use ?a representative? if you don?t know the sex of the individual.?

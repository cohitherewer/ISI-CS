 NIGHTWATCH

 Of the few things left remarkable beneath the visiting moon, the Taj Mahal happens to be one. But looking at it in moonlight is not as simple a pleasure as it sounds like. A whole structure of rules, charges and prohibitions have now accreted around the building and its gardens, and most of them are for worthy reasons. Callousness and corruption have not spared the site, largely because of greed. First, the Taj has long been a victim of environmental abuse. Factories along the Jamuna and the drying up of the river have caused irreparable damage to the marble, and to the firmness of the structure itself. The minarets could also be tilting. Tourism has its myriad hazards as well. Finally, the Rs 175-crore heritage corridor scam, possibly involving the highest names in the Uttar Pradesh government, would have built parks and shopping complexes near the Taj, had it not been for the Supreme Court?s intervention. And the apex court has been consistently involved in actively protecting the Taj from all sorts of human depredations. The court?s latest role has been to allow provisionally the viewing of the Taj at night, in the light of the moon, with a number of restrictions in place.

 It is unfortunate that the Centre, the UP government and its municipal infrastructure, the Archaeological Survey of India and Indians themselves have not been able to look after this treasure without the regular interventions of the Supreme Court. The highest judicial body in the country should not have had to spend its already strained resources, particularly time, on these executive matters, for which there already exists a whole network of bodies and provisions. No democracy can remain long in a state of health if the judiciary is repeatedly expected to implement the laws which, ideally, it is only supposed to interpret and protect.

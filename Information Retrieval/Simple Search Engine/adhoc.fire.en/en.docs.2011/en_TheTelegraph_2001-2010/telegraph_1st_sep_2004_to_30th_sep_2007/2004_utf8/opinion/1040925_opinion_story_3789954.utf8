 PULLING A FAST ONE

This Above All / Khushwant Singh

 Tastes of life

 Late in the days left to me, I have come to the conclusion that I?ve been an impostor all my life. I have written several books on religion and history of the Sikhs, published translations of hymns from the Gurbani without ever having read the Granth Sahib from cover to cover. Nevertheless, when people refer to me as a scholar of Sikhism, I protest so mildly that they think I am being modest. It is the same with Urdu. I have published a lot of my translations from Urdu into English in my novels and my columns. My vocabulary of Urdu is woefully inadequate. So I read a lot of the Urdu verse in Hindi, which I read with difficulty because Hindi translations have footnotes with meanings of difficult words. People often look upon me as a scholar of Urdu. But my friend, the late Ali Sardar Jafri, who helped in translating Iqbal, told me on my face, ?You don?t know any Urdu.? His remark hurt me but I know he was right.

 I am now trying to fill up gaps in my knowledge by devoting my entire summer vacation reading the Granth Sahib in the morning. I devote my afternoons reading Urdu poets from Meer and Ghalib to Faiz, Kaifi Azmi, Javed Akhtar and others. So the mornings are devoted to reading praises of the lord, the importance of the guru for spiritual elevation, the need to conquer lust, anger, desires and arrogance by squashing one?s ego and renouncing wine and women. The afternoons are spent reading of the joy that drinking, making love to women and boys with rosy cheeks and rounded bottoms provide. In the morning it is saints glorifying the name of the lord, in the afternoons it is mockers of sheikhs, maulvis and mullahs. I have become a split personality. By the time my vacation is over, I will have finished my first complete reading of the Granth Sahib. I will have also gone through the diwans of Urdu classical masters and modern poets. I fear I will end up as a schizophrenic in need of psychiatric help.

 I comfort myself by believing that Ghalib must have faced the same dilemma. His Muslim friends, who followed the Shariat strictly, must have chided him for not saying his prayers regularly and his indulgence in wine. A man who had known want, woe and fear, a man who begged for a pittance from the king, I wonder, how could he decide so quickly to change his ways and give up drinking. To wit:

??So have I lived and passed my days

How can I bring myself to say that God exists,

God the Bounteous Giver, God the Beneficent?

 For God?s possible for those who lead 

 happy sheltered lives,

And know God?s grace and his loving care.?

 Sauda, another great master of Urdu verse, was even more outspoken on the joys of drinking:

Saaqi gayee bahhar, dil mein rahee havas

 Too minnaton say jaam dey

Aur main kahoon kay ?bas?

 (O Saki, gone is the spring of youth,

 Remains but one regret in this 

 heart of mine

 That thou has never pressed 

 the goblet in my hand,

 And I protested ?I?ve had 

 enough of wine?)

 By the time the day is over and I turn indoors for my sundowner, I am a thoroughly confused person. I pour myself a hefty slug of Scotch-n-soda and put on my cassette player. I refrain from putting on keertan out of respect for people who would consider it a sacrilege, and instead listen to Bach, Beethoven or Mozart. I come to the comforting conclusion: impostor is too strong a word for me, but humbug fits me to a tee.

 Snuffed out

 In Victorian England, use of snuff as a nasal decongestant was common practice in high society. Gentlemen carried small silver snuff boxes in their pockets, put a pinch of the powder on the back of their left hand, and elegantly raised it to their nostrils. By the time I went to England, using snuff had all but disappeared. There was only one single shop on Charing Cross Road between Leicester Square and Cambridge Circus which sold snuff of different varieties and had some silver and gold snuff boxes on display. Being a nosey type, I bought the cheapest box and a tin of snuff. I tried some. It was very pleasant. Fragrance induced a couple of sneezes and certainly cleared my nostrils. At that time I was not aware that snuff was produced from tobacco, nor that sniffing it amounted to taking it. My enthusiasm for snuff was soon snuffed out.

 I was aware that many Indians sniffed nasvaar as they took hafeem regularly. None of my friends or acquaintances used nasvaar and I assumed that its use had died out in India as it had in England. I was in for a surprise.

 One afternoon a couple of youngmen with their wives and children descended on my home in Kasauli. They were very well turned out: the men had solid gold karas, ladies in chiffon silks, with diamonds sparkling in their ear lobes and nose-pins. One of them took out a miniature telephone-cum-camera from the pocket and started taking my snapshots. ?This must have cost a packet,? I remarked. ?Not much,? he replied, ?Around Rs 25,000?. It was evident they were a rich family. I asked one of the men what they did? ?Business,? was his one-word reply. ?What kind of business?? I asked. He handed me his visiting card. It read Vikas Grover: Managing Partner, Six Photo Snuff Factory, Gidderbaha. So snuff has not been snuffed out in India. it has millions of addicts.

 A game with a difference

 A friend of mine has a son who is in the habit of destroying his toys. When the boy turned five, I gave him a toy car made of solid steel. It was a great success and he did not let go of it all evening. His parents were surprised that the toy was still one piece. When I said goodbye to the birthday boy, who was still playing with my gift, he asked me: ?How do you break this thing??

 In all seriousness

 Teacher: What do you understand by the word ?responsibility??

 Ghanta replied: ?Madamji, if three out of the four buttons of your blouse are broken, then the whole responsibility rests on the fourth button.?

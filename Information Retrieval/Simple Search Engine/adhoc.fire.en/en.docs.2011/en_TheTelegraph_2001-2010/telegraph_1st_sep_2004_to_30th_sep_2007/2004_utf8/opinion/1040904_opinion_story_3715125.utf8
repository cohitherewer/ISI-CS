 Out and About

Its not fair, all the good guys are directing ads. But thats why commercials are getting better and films, trashier. After Tarsem surreal Singh made an actress out of an over-rouged Jennifer Lopez in The Cell, hes moved closer home and is directing Aishwarya Rai in the Namibian desert for a jewellery commercial which he promises will be esoteric (what else?). Meanwhile, Cold Mountains Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella has also come up with a brilliant liquor ad. Looks like its ad venture time for Hollywood.Mona Singh

Happy days for the J-serialwallahs. Theyve even got 

the most photographed Indian non-beauty to grace postage stamps and collectibles! 

Thats how televisions favourite braced, umbrella-ed and squarest-ever secretary, 

Jassi, celebrated her first screen birthday this Wednesday, by being the first 

TV character to make it to the Indian postage stamp. I had never thought of making 

it this big, gushed the beautiful Mona Singh, aka Jassi. And now its time for 

the plain-Jane look to become fashionable.

Zeenat Amans playing Mrs Robinson in the Indian version of The Graduate, who seduces her daughters boyfriend. The visibly excited actress says, Its a challenge to live up to Anne Bancroft (the film) and Jerry Hall (the West End play). Well, whatever makes her think she will?

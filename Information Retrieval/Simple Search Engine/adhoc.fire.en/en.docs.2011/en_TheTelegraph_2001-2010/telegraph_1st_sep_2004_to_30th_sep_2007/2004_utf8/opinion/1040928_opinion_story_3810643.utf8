 OFF TARGET

 Professionals get compensated according to their responsibilities and in terms of their performance. Cricketers, now that the artificial line dividing professionals and amateurs is getting blurred, have to be treated by the same yardstick as professionals are in other spheres. The Board of Control for Cricket in India has announced the contract system for graded payments. This makes eminent sense since there is something odd about a system that compensates Sachin Tendulkar and, say, Parthiv Patel in the same manner. The dependence of the Indian cricket team on Tendulkar, and the prodigious talent on which this dependence is based, should fetch him a higher price in the marketplace. In fact, a case can be made to place him above the A-category which promises players Rs 50 lakh per annum. But Tendulkar?s example, however invidious it might sound on the surface, only serves to underline the logic of the principle underlying the system of graded payments.

 The soundness of the logic notwithstanding, there are certain aspects of the graded system of payments which demand further review and clarification. For example, what happens to a player who is dropped from a series because of lack of form? Under the new system, he will be rewarded for not playing, or for not playing up to the standard expected of him. To take another example, what happens to a player against whom a disciplinary action is taken? There is no doubt that cricketers, like other sportsmen, have very short professional lives. At the most, a cricketer can play for 15 years. A player therefore needs to have his future livelihood protected. In a professionalized world, this is a natural and justified expectation. But this does not mean that a cricketer should be rewarded for non-performance. It is clear that in a bid to keep the cricketers happy, the BCCI has abandoned some of the links in the relationship between work and reward in sports.

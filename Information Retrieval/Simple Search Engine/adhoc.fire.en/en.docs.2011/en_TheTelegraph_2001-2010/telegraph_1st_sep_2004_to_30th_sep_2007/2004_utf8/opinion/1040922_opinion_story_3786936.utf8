 VITAL PARADOX

 Sustained engagement with the United States of America is in India?s vital national interest. The visit of the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, to New York and Washington offers an important opportunity for the new Indian government to ensure that bilateral relations gain further momentum. Indeed, the decision by the Bush administration to implement the next steps in the strategic partnership has helped to create the right environment for this. But India-US bilateral ties do present a paradoxical picture. For instance, there is continued suspicion in India of American policies towards south Asia. Some of this tension, of course, is a legacy of the Cold War, but this sentiment is kept alive by the US?s relationship with Pakistan. 

 Resentment at the manner in which Pakistan seems to continue to be rewarded despite its support of terrorism within India is palpable as is the perception that the US has double standards in dealing with terrorism. Similarly, there is a widespread feeling that Washington is not sufficiently sensitive to Indian security concerns or its aspirations of being a great power. The Indian elite are clearly uncomfortable with the US?s hyper-power, and this found expression in India?s quiet disapproval of the manner in which Washington handled the military intervention in Iraq. The controversy in the US over business process outsourcing to India, and the sparring between Indian and American negotiators in various multilateral trade-related forums over the pace of liberalization in agriculture and services, continue to demonstrate to New Delhi the current limits of the relationship with Washington, and the fact that American self-interest will in no way be compromised in the process of building a relationship with the world?s largest democracy. 

 These concerns, of course, must face up to the tremendous growth in bilateral relations in virtually every field since the beginning of this century. Cold War estrangement has changed to engagement of a high order, including in the military field. The relationship was given a further fillip by Mr George W. Bush?s announcement, in January this year, of the NSSP. The next steps included an agreement to expand cooperation in three specific areas: civilian nuclear activities, the civilian space programme, and high-technology trade. The NSSP declared that the relationship between the US and India is based increasingly on common values and common interests. India?s multi-faceted relationship with the US in 2004 seems to be more secure than it has ever been in the last 50 years. Not only is there greater connectivity at the levels of the political leadership and senior officials, but the bandwidth has also expanded. Mr Singh?s visit can help in putting India-US relations on an even more firm footing.

 MOUNTAIN RAGE

 Barun De believes it is no coincidence that most major terrorist networks are located in inaccessible mountainous terrains

 Alive and booming

 Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism have been overemphasized as the main factors in all contemporary civil strife. Iraq is the most recent example of the falsity of this theory. Violence and repression there have been neither just colonialist, nor just Sunni or Shia. Historically grounded in narrow, chauvinist faction feuds, they culminated in Saddam Hussein?s aggrandizement. It now seeks justification in the liberation struggle against the United States of America. 

 There is nothing Islamic about nuclear proliferation or intra-state violence by local bullies who covet government funds. Or about the ethnic cleansing of black people in Ruanda-Urundi or Sudanese Darfur, or that of the Uighur Muslims in Turkestan or the Kashmiri Pandits. 

 The rage that produced such disparate forms of repression of cultural diversity, and sometimes genocide, leading to mass flights from hearth and home, are distempers of the brawn rather than mere disorders of the brain. One type of region where this has lately become common is that which has suddenly lost a specious prosperity generated earlier by exogenous forces such as ?hill stations?.

 During the fin-de-si?cle ?long decade? from 1989 to September 2001, much of the clandestine bombing, hostage-taking, mass slaughter, and social blackmail of capitalist enterprise took place in rough and inaccessible mountain terrain. It was concentrated in a sickle-like chain, sweeping south-east from the Austro-Italian Alps through Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Anatolia, Kurdistan, the Caucasian lands and Armenia, into northern Iran, Afghanistan, and then down from the Tian-Shan, Alai, Pamir and Karakoram ranges in the Himalayas to the south-east Asian knot that ties the Indian North-east with Myanmar, Chinese Yunnan and Laos.

 Social relations pivot on the power equation in these regions. The balance of power has been historically determined in the mountains by modes of production in the plains. Throughout the 20th century, the hills were politically and economically incorporated by plains states. These treated mountain-dwellers as social inferiors ? porters, guards, hill guides, waiters, mess-boys in some regions such as Montenegro, the northern Caucasus, Afghanistan, Nepal or north Burma; as mercenary infantry in the Turkish or British Indian armies. This is as true of relations between the Russians and the Chechens as it is of modern India with the Gurkhas, or Burma with the Kachims.

 Yet, social groups within the mountains did certainly have minds and traditions of their own. Reduced to proletarian subjects of nationalities whose capitals were mostly in the plains (except in cases like Simla, Darjeeling or Chimgan to which bureaucrats shifted to escape the summer heat), the traditional hill intelligentsia never gained an organic solidarity with their plains, middle-class neighbours. Their spiritual problems, customs, sports or feuds ? over scarce resources such as cultivable land, streams, trade routes, or the cutting and culling rights of timber, grapes or other crops ? all escaped the comprehension of the 20th century globalizing, ruling class. As did their lack of participation in plains? civil society or in mainstream nationalism, instead of the local patriotism that they generally espoused.

 The Nineties? insurgencies in the mountains were more in the nature of intifadas, struggles for autonomy in the shape of an alternative socio-economic order. These were different from earlier movements in the vicinity during the Seventies and Eighties. For instance, in Punjab, Kashmir and Sind, the Shia uprising in the Middle East or in the Shan and Karen native states in Burma. The older insurgencies had sought conciliar separation from the centre. Now, the underclasses ? alienated from the sub-elites of the older movements ? had taken off at a tangent, taking recourse to a fanatical militancy, in a bid to attract the attention of the media. 

 Repeated violence and methods of intimidation have made the objects of terror increasingly blas? and more inflexible ? so that more and more hostages are being sacrificed, while the murderers and blackmailers who capture the headlines are either amnestied or ?encountered? but rarely caught, since public trial would expose the collusive links of business, political or paramilitary agencies. Hideouts among friendly inhabitants in the mountain terrain give licence for the criminalization of what may have been once legitimate grievances neglected by distant authorities. 

 The Pankisi Gorge in the central Caucasus facilitates extremists escaping Chechnya to take shelter in Georgia. The Tien Shan foothills north of Chimgan have trails easy for the hardy Uzbek youth to pick up dollars from the Hizb-ut-Tahrir ransom-takers in Batkent in Kyrgyzstan or the Karategin ravines of nearby Tajikistan. Other examples are the ridges of the Pir Panjal in southern Kashmir, Rolpa or Ilam in western and eastern Nepal along India?s Himalayan borders, the eastern Bhutan border with Arunachal Pradesh, the Manipur-Nagaland-Mizoram borders with Myanmar or the tangle of hill minorities in the south-east Asian heartland. In India itself are the hideouts and social refuges of the Chambal ravine banditry or Veerappan?s old shelters in the Cauvery uplands between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. 

 Merely gunning down the bosses without looking into the grievances that sustain mountain rage will solve no fundamental problem. Specifying the geo-social locale common to Shamyl Basayev, Juma Nomonghani, Mast Gul, ?Prachanda? Dahal, or even petty social bandits is only a first step to identifying why social groups give sympathy, sustenance or shelter to violent dissent against civil society. Serious research has not yet been done into why those who live among such discontents accept perversions of social norms and political culture. Borders have become porous, frontiers are flouted and small arms have proliferated, thanks to transnational market deals, financed by extortion from local business. All of this is now accepted as ?rules of the game?. 

 The path to seeking alternatives to these counter attacks on ?internal colonialism? by the plains people has to start with the historical recognition that early 20th century latifundial cultivation and its plantation economy were already dying out by the Eighties in the minds of hill people. Small farmers, skilled craftsmen, or martial communities, once controlled by Western colonialism, now need new ideas, a new social ethic, industrial discipline and empowerment. The way forward lies in a ?Swiss model? ? endogenously generated socio-economic diversification, dairying in the lower slopes, food processing and medicinal plant cultivation on the higher slopes, sorting out the problems of river use at a trans-border level, local business and technical training, as well as better maintenance of the mountain habitat. 

 Where they exist, the hill intelligentsia must be positively encouraged to work within national mainstreams ? and not be rejected with suspicion as potential allies for terrorists.

 LULL AFTER THE QUAKE

SADDLE THE WIND

By Jess Foley, 

Century, pound; 11.40

Sarah named her daughter Blanche, as the girl was 

born fair. Ollie, Sarah?s husband, could not quite approve of that, because he 

doubted if their fifth child could have much to cheer about in the kind of bleak, 

spartan life their meagre means would thrust her into. Sarah, though, resolved 

to make things different for her.

 Different it turned out to be, but not quite in the way Sarah wanted it. It all started when Sarah moved out of her small village habitat of West Country and reached Hallowford Savill. There, in that ?big house?, Blanche grew up in the company of Marianne, both becoming fast friends. After sixteen years, an engagement is set between Marianne and Gentry, an Italian aristocrat from Messina in Sicily. 

 Blanche suddenly finds herself caught in the middle of the proposed match. To add to her woes, he is overpowered by Gentry?s passion one day. Meanwhile, Marianne loses all her parental property, after which Gentry agrees to marry her, if only to save her from committing suicide. 

 As the couple travel back to Messina, a crestfallen Blanche goes about restlessly looking for a mooring in life. She eventually marries Alfredo, another Italian gentleman, and then gives birth to Adriana, her daughter by Gentry. The relationship soon begins to sour, and Blanche decides to walk out of it with her daughter. At the precise moment that she reveals the truth about her daughter?s parentage to Alfredo, the great Sicilian earthquake, one of the worst in Italian history, strikes. The tremors within their relationship seem to erupt into a great natural calamity by some cosmic design.

 Saddle the Wind is Jess Foley?s third novel. Set against the backdrop of the late 19th and early 20th century England, the novel traces a woman?s journey through life and relationships. The tests that life puts Blanche to are too difficult for a humble girl of labour-class origin to grapple with. In many ways, Blanche is similar to Abbie, the strong but flawed heroine of Foley?s first novel, So Long at the Fair. The greatest strength of Blanche?s character comes from her stubbornness, perhaps also from the fact that she makes no attempt to hide her weaknesses. Neither does she flinch from hitting back when she feels that her dignity is under threat. There can be found in Blanche?s portrayal traces of the women?s-lib English heroine of the 19th century. 

 A sedate, tender and delicately nuanced narrative endows this trans-national romance with a distinct charm which the reader is sure to find appealing.

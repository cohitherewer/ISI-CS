 BHOPAL BONANZA

 It could be made to look like a bonanza. The last part of the compensation money for survivors of the Bhopal gas tragedy will be paid in soon. Most of the 105,000 survivors are pitifully poor, or have been impoverished by the medical costs of the tragedy. So Rs 1,503 crore had initially seemed an inconceivable fortune to most. But the actual dimensions of the injustice being done them ? by Union Carbide and by their own government ? has now been driven home. Each person or family unit will receive something between Rs 25,000 and Rs 55,000 ? an absurdly inadequate sum, given the survivors? medical debts and, of course, the extent of the damage that has been done to their bodies and lives. And this is the truly inconceivable quantity in the entire matter ? the magnitude of the outrage in allowing one of the world?s worst industrial offenders to get away with a crime of such proportions.

 The aftermath of the tragedy, lasting for twenty years, has been one of protracted and inhuman exploitation ? the power of very big money to ride roughshod over the basic human rights and entitlements of some of the most unfortunate and marginalized people in the world. And this is not only because of the economic might of Union Carbide and Dow Chemicals, but also because of the cravenness and corruption of the Indian bureaucracy. The Madhya Pradesh relief commissioner has recently informed the Supreme Court, through the Centre, that around 11,000 compensation claims are yet to be processed ? after twenty years. Besides, with time, the extent of the human damages is being made clearer, so that the distribution of the compensation money will be done on very different calculations from how the amount was fixed almost two decades ago. Nobody talks of the extradition of the Union Carbide chief any more ? he has been let off by time. And Dow Chemicals is refusing to clear the huge amounts of toxic wastes still in the factory premises, polluting the air, water and soil of the city.

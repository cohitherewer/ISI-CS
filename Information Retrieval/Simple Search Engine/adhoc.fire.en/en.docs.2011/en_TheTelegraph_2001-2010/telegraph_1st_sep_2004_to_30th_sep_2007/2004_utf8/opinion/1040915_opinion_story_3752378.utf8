 SAVE IT FROM DECAY 

Shobita Punja

 There are different degrees of conservation and a variety of interventions to choose from but each has a price tag.

 The quickest and most efficient way is what the doctor prescribes ? ?prevention is better than cure? and we know that it is certainly cheaper. To clean one?s house of stagnant water is quicker, requires a little effort and is far less expensive than taking malaria pills, and suffering in hospital.

 Conservation needs to be approached in the same commonsensical way. The first step would be to prevent deterioration. Vegetation growing out of drains along the side of the building can be removed quite easily and this can save the entire building from being taken over by roots and cracks that get filled with water, causing the building?s fabric to weaken.

 The next step would be to prevent further deterioration and decay. The consolidation of the fabric, the strengthening of the physical material of the building, ensures that it will endure. Here no new parts are being added, only the original fabric of the building is strengthened. The strengthening of the wall using traditional techniques helps to match materials and fabrics so that they can age in the same way. If for example the paint of a painting is peeling away from its background the correct and appropriate use of a little adhesive, to strengthen the painting would be far quicker and safer than having to reconstruct the entire picture anew. In the same way grouting the wall of a building with cracks is a way of strengthening the structure and making it more durable.

 Putting it back

 Restoration on the other hand differs from consolidation in that the purpose is to revive the original concept of the object. Here one can replace missing parts, integrate new additions and complete the missing aspects of designs that may have faded or been destroyed. Restoration then is far more expensive than mere consolidation as the intervention is far greater. Imagine there is a ruin of a building and the remains are such that one cannot expect a layperson to understand how it looked originally. If the building is of some importance then restoration will be attempted to revive the concept of the building by remaking and restoring the walls or staircase so that everyone can see the plan and form of the original building. 

 Reproduction is another concept, where the entire building or artifact is copied and remade. The Bamiyan Buddhas that was destroyed in Afghanistan, is being remade by the Chinese at great cost, and will replicate the size and dimensions of the original.

 All over again

 This is where prevention is better than cure. It is far less expensive to protect and preserve the original than to reproduce it later or replicate the entire object or building.

 There are occasions when reconstruction is necessary. When the Aswan dam was being built and was to flood over the magnificent Egyptian sculptures of Abu Simbel made during the reign of Rameses II 4000 years ago, UNESCO and the rest of the world gathered enough funds to ensure that the temple was carved out of the rock block by block and each numbered piece was reconstructed again at a safer site. A similar and most spectacular job was done to two small temples along the Narmada valley when the dam was being built. The Nagarjunakonda dam that was to sweep over the remains of ancient Buddhist sites in Andhra Pradesh also had to be rescued in a similar way by ASI.

 So it is critical for us to realize that preventive conservation, that is, timely action taken to prevent damage and decay is the preferred method as all other techniques and degrees of conservation are far more expensive and time-consuming. Will the world see sense in common sense?

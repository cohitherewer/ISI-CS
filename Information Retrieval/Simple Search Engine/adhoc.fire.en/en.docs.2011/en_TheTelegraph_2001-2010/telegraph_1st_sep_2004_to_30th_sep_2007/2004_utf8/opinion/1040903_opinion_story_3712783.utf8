 DEATH AND LIFE IN BHOPAL

 XPOSURES (Green- peace, Rs 500), subtitled Portrait of a Corporate Crime, collects the photographs taken by Raghu Rai of the Bhopal gas tragedy immediately after the leak at the Union Carbide factory on the night of December 2/3, 1984, and then in 2001-02, when he returned to Bhopal in order to document the ongoing disaster. xposure is an overwhelming, often unbearable, portfolio, showing the continuing human costs of corporate irresponsibility. This is Gangaram and his family. He came to Bhopal from Maharashtra after he got leprosy. He got cured, only to get struck down again by the effects of the gas: All of us have breathing problems and we have become dependent on others. Rai captures moments from the lives of the thousands of men, women and children still battling against monstrous injustice.

 KILLING NEGLECT

 Doing well in life can be risky business in Bihar. Successful professionals and businessmen are more likely than others to be targeted by criminals. The killing of a surgeon in Patna is another dark reminder of the state of insecurity in Bihar. That the doctor fell to his assassin?s bullets despite seeking police protection in advance has a chilling message. The incident shows that someone targeted by a criminal has little hope of protection by the law. It also suggests that criminals wield more power over men?s lives than the state or its institutions. The doctor had to die because he refused to submit to his killer?s demand for what is known as ?protection money?. The fact that 35 doctors were kidnapped for ransom over the past 15 years is no mere cold statistics; it is symptomatic of the horror and insecurity of life in Bihar. There have been others ? businessmen, lawyers and teachers ? who fell victims to kidnappers demanding huge sums as ransom. In some cases, criminals kidnapped young schoolchildren and forced their parents to pay ransom. The strike by doctors to protest against their colleague?s killing also follows a pattern. After each kidnapping or murder, colleagues and compatriots of the victim protest in much the same way, if only to signal the pity of their situation. 

 The state?s reaction, on the other hand, is usually a shame. This time too the chief minister, Ms Rabri Devi, seems to be appallingly unconcerned about the collapse of the healthcare system due to the doctors? strike. True, the officer-in-charge of a police station has been transferred and some relatives of the suspected killer have been detained by the police. But the actions are clearly too inadequate to inspire the striking doctors? confidence in the government?s ability or willingness to take on Bihar?s underworld. In fact, there is a public perception, not entirely wrong, that the state administration lacks the will to wage a full-fledged battle against criminal gangs. It is not so much a problem of the efficiency or morale of the police force. The problem lies in the long shadow of the criminal over the state?s politics. With politicians as their protectors, criminals apparently have little to fear from the law. The doctors may have to call off their strike in a few days, as others have done before them. But it is difficult to hope that anything will change before the next killer strikes.

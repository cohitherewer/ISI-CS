 Letters to Editor

 No farewell for friends

 Sir ? The death of a player on the field is tragic beyond words. But sadness gives way to frustration and anger to find only legal wranglings awaiting the dead hero?s family. Cristiano de lima Junior probably came to India to earn more money than he could back home in Brazil, where his talent would be considered average. Each year, footballers travel to India from African and Latin American countries in search of greener pastures ? those like Enyilord Lawrence, who died suddenly earlier this year. Lawrence?s body was stranded in Calcutta for over a week because his family in Nigeria was too poor to pay for its passage and in the eyes of the government of India, he was an illegal immigrant. The likes of Junior and Lawrence come to India to do nothing more noble than earn money. But with their football, they pay for every penny they earn. Don?t we owe them a better farewell?

 Yours faithfully,

 Estella Sardar, Howrah

 What?s the difference?

 Sir ? A perusal of the proposed amendment to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 exposes the deception and the doublespeak of the political elite. The addition of chapters IV, V and VI, which make the act a replica of Prevention of Terrorism Act, goes against the commitment made by the United Progressive Alliance in its common minimum programme.

 To be fair to the government, some of the most abhorrent provisions of Pota like admissibility of confessions (section 32) and the presumption of guilt in cases of unauthorized possession of arms (section 4) have been dispensed with. However, almost all other provisions of Pota which had contributed to its well-deserved infamy, have been retained. The wide and open-ended definition of terrorism, and the provisions on terrorist organization and guilt by association have been reproduced. The wisdom of adding a new chapter on ?terrorist organizations? is questionable given that the original Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act had an elaborate framework for outlawing ?unlawful organizations. Such a declaration was to come into effect only after confirmation by a tribunal consisting of a high court judge. The absence of similar safeguards in the new chapter is critical.

 More alarming is the conspiracy of silence within the media and the intelligentsia on this fraud. This would only legitimize the culture of erosion of civil liberties, an objective that the previous government and its brainchild, Pota, failed to achieve.

 Yours faithfully,

Saurabh Bhattacharjee, New Delhi

 Sir ? Pota was introduced by the earlier National Democratic Alliance regime sidelining all norms of political consensus. Ironically, the same government put off several other bills like the one on women?s reservation in legislatures citing the lack of political consensus even though MPs committed to support the bill exceeded a three-fourth majority. Provisions of existing laws are sufficient if enforced properly. Pota was a foolish tool given by the NDA government to chief ministers who did not hesitate to misuse it against their political opponents.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

 Sir ? What was the need to repeal Pota? Democratic governments need to muster every resource to tackle terrorism and ensure the safety of citizens. The repeal of Pota should be seen in the light of the introduction of anti-terrorism laws in the United States of America and United Kingdom. Shouldn?t the Manmohan Singh regime have looked into the misuse of Pota and rectified the mistakes, instead of repealing the act? It is also frustrating to see the left?s opposition to the amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. This is a watered down version of Pota, but the left is still not satisfied. If it is argued that these anti-terrorism acts encroach upon the liberty of citizens, then the dastardly acts of violence by terrorists also violate the individual?s right to live. There are always more victims than terrorists, so should we sacrifice the lives of innocent Indians to protect the individual liberty of terrorists? 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Rights issue

 Sir ? Soham Gupta ? and all those who agree with his letter, ?Unfair game? (Dec 4) ? should know that a city-based animal-rights group, People For Animals, had filed a PIL way back in 1998 in the Calcutta high court, on behalf of the hapless animals in the Calcutta zoo. Gupta could also read ?Cages score a zero in zoo norms? (Nov 17). As for missing the ?once-in-a-lifetime? chance to see sea-lions perform, I wonder how many people felt deprived at the cessation of the original ?circus?, held in Rome, when people watched the hungry lions devouring early Christians. It is a well-known fact that circus- and zoo-animals live only one-fifth of their expected life span. Many species have become extinct owing to their indiscriminate removal from their natural habitat.

 Yours faithfully,

 Purnima L. Toolsidass, Calcutta

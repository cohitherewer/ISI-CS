 SIGNS OF A RECOVERY 

At long last, the IMF?s World Economic Outlook 

is cautiously optimistic about the prospects of the global economy, writes S. 

Venkitaramanan 

 When the twins meet 

The World Economic Outlook, released 

last month, is the International Monetary Fund?s report on the global economic 

scenario. It is usually issued at the time of the semi-annual meet of the Bretton 

Woods twins. This year, finance ministers of the world met in Washington to deliberate 

on the problems of developed and developing countries. Such meetings are important 

occasions for finance ministers and central bank chiefs to exchange ideas and 

seek advice from experts. It is thus appropriate that the IMF issues its WEO 

on such an occasion. It provides food for thought, a necessary diversion from 

the festivities that accompany the gatherings of the world?s treasurers and bankers.

The WEO 2004 is the second of a series to be 

prepared under Raghuram Rajan, a product of the Indian Institute of Management, 

Ahmedabad and the University of Chicago, who was handpicked for the job of counsellor 

and director (research) of the IMF. This latest report lives up to the high reputation 

of its predecessors, which have all been looked up to as representing the collective 

wisdom of the IMF?s experts on the global economic scenario.

The WEO notes that the global economic recovery 

has become increasingly well-established. World economies are now expected to 

grow at 5 per cent in 2004, the highest in nearly three decades. For 2005, the 

IMF experts put their growth estimates at 4.3 per cent. As for India, the WEO 

predicts a growth rate of 6.4 per cent for 2004 and 6.7 per cent for 2005. China 

is set to establish higher rates of growth of 9 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively 

for 2004 and 2005.

The United States of America is estimated to grow 

at 3.6 per cent in 2004 and 2.9 per cent in 2005, and Japan at 4.4 per cent and 

2.3 per cent respectively. Evidently, the stimulative policies of the Japanese 

government and central bank have had a beneficial impact, and deflation is no 

longer evident. The area under the euro is slowly recovering and is estimated 

to grow at 2.2 per cent in 2004 and 2005. 

But, the grim prospects on the energy front ? a reflection 

of the scorching pace of growth of China, and Asia in general ? may spoil the 

rosy picture. While crude prices have reached a high of $50 per barrel, the WEO 

makes a forecast of around $29 a barrel for 2004. However, it admits that the 

low levels of spare global capacity are leading to concern that global oil production 

may not be able to cope with the unanticipated short-term supply stock.

The imbalances in the global economy continue to be 

dominated by America?s twin deficits ? on the current account and in the budget. 

The US is likely to have a current account deficit of nearly 5.3-5.4 per cent 

in 2004 and 2005. This is compensated for by the current account surpluses of 

Japan, the newly industrializing economies of Asia and the regional surplus of 

the areas under the euro. In financial terms thus, the Asian countries? surplus 

is sustaining the deficit of the US in terms of fund flows ? loans to the US and 

investment in US securities. The size of the US?s current account deficit ? standing 

at 5 per cent ? is a cause for alarm and would have led to decisive action to 

bring about adjustments if encountered in developing countries. There is a separate 

law for the rich and for the poor of the world.

Short of devaluation, a credible solution to the US?s 

current account imbalance seems unlikely. This requires action at both the global 

and national levels. WEO 2004 does not indicate any specific approach but 

stresses that all countries and regions should play a part in addressing global 

imbalances. The key policy requirements include medium-term fiscal consolidation 

in the US to boost savings, structural reforms to boost growth prospects outside 

the US and greater exchange-rate flexibility in Asia, consistent with an orderly 

reduction in the current account surplus. WEO 2004 notes that while progress 

is being made, in varying degrees, on the first two heads, little progress has 

been made with the third. 

While at the Dubai meet of the IMF and World Bank, 

the former had stressed on the need for a revaluation of China?s currency in order 

to remedy the US?s current account imbalance, the latest WEO is more circumspect. 

It discusses possible options for exchange-rate management ? pegged, intermediate 

or floating. It is biased in favour of a floating regime, although individual 

countries may find the move to pure floating difficult.

The report specially cites India as a successful case 

of a transition from a currency pegged to the dollar to a managed float in March 

1993. It notes that while India initiated greater exchange-rate flexibility when 

economic policy reforms were still in progress, the managed float has been maintained 

without much distress, even during times of international market turbulence. A 

well-deserved pat on the back from the bastion of international financial prudence!

Turning to India?s macroeconomic situation, here is 

the WEO?s summary of its prospects. ?India?s GDP growth is projected at 

6.4% in 2004... Large budget deficits and high and rising levels of public debt 

remain the Achilles? heel of the economy. Beyond long-run sustainability concerns, 

high public borrowing may choke off the nascent recovery in private investment 

needed to sustain the expansion. The newly-elected ruling coalition intends to 

effect ambitious fiscal adjustment to balance the current budget by 2009...while 

increasing expenditure in priority areas...While this target path appears broadly 

appropriate, the supporting measures that were recently proposed will take time 

to be implemented and yield results. In view of this uncertainly, expenditure 

increases should be contingent on progress on the revenue front. Accelerating 

structural reforms...remains key to step up potential growth and reduce poverty.? 

These views are shared by economists in India who favour revenue increases instead 

of compressing expenditure. 

The WEO devotes a lot of attention to the problems 

faced by developed countries by the ?greying? of their people, the fiscal burden 

of higher pensions and medical expenditure. Possible solutions lie in opening 

the doors to immigrants ? a solution that is politically explosive, especially 

in the context of rising unemployment and existing racial tensions. 

Overall, the WEO offers a clear outline of the problems 

posed by the developments in the world economy. Whether the finance ministers 

will listen to such well-meant advice is not too certain. A crisis, such as the 

one the global economy faces, calls for decisive action. But whether such action 

will be taken depends on various factors. It is ultimately politics that governs 

economics. With the presidential elections in the US, the scene is particularly 

unclear. The statesmen of the world will do well to listen and act, rather than 

be forced by the trauma of a crisis to undertake the necessary adjustments.

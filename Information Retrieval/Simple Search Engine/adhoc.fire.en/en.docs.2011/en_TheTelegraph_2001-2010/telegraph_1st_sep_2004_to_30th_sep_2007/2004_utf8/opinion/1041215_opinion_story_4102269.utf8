 PUT UP A UNITED FRONT

 Gwynne Dyer

 It?s not even a free trade area yet, but when it grows up it wants to be just like the European Union. The whole history of the continent is against it, of course, but then Europe?s previous history didn?t leave much room for optimism either.

 On December 9, the leaders of every South American country except the three Guyanas gathered in Ayacucho, Peru, to sign the preamble to the foundation act of the South American Union. They chose Ayacucho because that was where South American patriots defeated the last Spanish royal troops and ensured the independence of the Spanish-speaking half of the continent exactly 180 years ago this month. But the single, united republic that Simon Bolivar dreamed of was swiftly defeated by the realities of geography.

 The Portuguese-speaking half of the continent has always been a single country because communications are relatively easy in Brazil. But the mountains and rivers that divide the rest of the region ensured that there would be nine separate Spanish-speaking republics (with about the same total population) in the other half. Now they want to change all that.

 Drive left

 The original concept of the SAU came from Brazil?s last president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who invited the other South American presidents to Brasilia in 2000 for a first-ever continental summit, but the idea has been vigorously backed by his successor, Luis Inacio ?Lula? da Silva, and by the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. Both men, unsurprisingly, are on the left: South American solidarity has grown more attractive as the United States of America has moved right and many South American governments have moved left. But there is more to it than that.

 South Americans were acutely conscious that as the rest of the world moved into trading blocs, their continent was being left behind once again. The EU, the North American Free Trade Area and the Association of South-East Asian Nations were old news, but Washington?s proposal for a hemisphere-wide, US-led Free Trade Area of the Americas threatened to extinguish any prospect of a common South American future and goaded many local patriots into action.

 The SAU is not meant to be just a free trade area. Its founders are talking about a parliament for the whole continent, and even about a common currency in the end. Their model is explicitly the EU, which grew to its present scope of 450 million people in 25 countries speaking 18 languages by similar stages over five decades. They believe that South America, with 400 million people in ten countries speaking only two languages, can do it even faster. They may be right.

 First steps

 The ceremony at Ayacucho was a modest start: the 10 presidents signed a two-page preamble to a constitution whose contents will be discussed in detail at a conference six months later. But this month should see the signing of a free trade deal between the two existing trading blocks in South America, Mercosur and the Community of Andean Nations, which together include all the SAU members except Chile. That is a real signal of intent.

 It will obviously be years before anything like a true South American common market, let alone a unified political space, begins to emerge. Already, Chile and Uruguay, are openly sceptical about the prospects of success. In fact, if the US so wants, it could probably seduce some potential SAU members away with special one-to-one free trade deals and wreck the whole plan.

 But there is little sign of that happening soon, and after a couple of years the momentum towards the SAU will start to build up. After centuries in a corner, South America may be joining the world at last.

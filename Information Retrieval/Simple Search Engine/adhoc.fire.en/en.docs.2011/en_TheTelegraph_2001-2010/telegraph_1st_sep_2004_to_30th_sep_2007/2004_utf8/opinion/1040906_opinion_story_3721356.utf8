 MORE, PLEASE

 On Saturday, Mr Manmohan Singh gave the first press conference by a prime minister in 12 years. It is understandable that Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee should not have cared to face the press. He was not quick on his feet, and analytical thinking, so important in giving convincing answers, was foreign to him. His fort was one-liners thrown at the pursuing press at an airport and how it was all lapped up! But it was not just he; Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao also gave few press conferences. The prime ministers opening joke was about throwing a pigeon himself amongst the cats. Clever as it was, it showed that he too is not immune to mediaphobia. At the end of his unread speech, he returned to the theme: the press, in its desire to grab headlines and seek sound bites, should keep the national interest in mind, and not promote petty and divisive politics. An admonition from the prime minister was not out of place, especially in the Vigyan Bhavan which looked like a swank version of a classroom in Delhi School of Economics. But to make the press an accomplice in the pyrotechnics of Ms Uma Bharti or the disruptions in parliament led by Mr L.K. Advani is to blame the messenger. The Bharatiya Janata Party would indulge in the same theatrics if the press were not there. They could have been locked up without any fuss in the absence of the press; but surely that is not what the prime minister meant.

 Democracy is a way to expose divisions and to settle differences in a peaceful manner, and it is better to let ink flow on the pages of newspapers than blood on the streets. That Indian democracy is somewhat rambunctious is undeniable; and our neighbour, Bangladesh, gives us a chastening lesson in the dangers of excessive exuberance. But the fault lies elsewhere, particularly in the fact that force and money are major currencies in control of votes; and the press is the only institution, however feeble, that exposes this fact. As to the petty political games that go on, the press may be an accomplice, but politicians are the players. 

 The press is not without its faults, but they lie more in incompetence and misanthropy than in lack of patriotism. And the way to combat them is to educate it the way Mr Singh tried to do. If he answers questions before an audience of 300, at least some will get his message right, and the rest will be seen to be wrong. He should point this out to his colleagues. Instead of preventing them from speaking to the press, he should encourage them to talk openly in press conferences as he did. He should lecture them on it; they are enough to fill a classroom. And the more live demonstrations like the one on Saturday he gives them, the better.

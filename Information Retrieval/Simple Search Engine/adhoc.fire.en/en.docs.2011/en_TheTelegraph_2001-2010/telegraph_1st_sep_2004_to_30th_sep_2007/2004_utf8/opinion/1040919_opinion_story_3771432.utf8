 DIARY

 A yatra or a daur (race)? Clearly, our sanyasin does not know. AB Vajpayee?s loaded comment recently that the BJP would go to the next polls under a ?younger? leadership seems to have set off a rat race among the second-rung leaders in the party, and two women are not willing to be left behind. The only problem is that one?s race with the tiranga is proving to have been a false start now that the other?s Savarkar yatra is looming in the horizon. Those suspected of being responsible for the sudden acceleration in the pace of the latter, Sushma Swaraj that is, are Pramod Mahajan and M Venkaiah Naidu. The sadhvi?s followers never stop blaming them for belittling their leader?s sacrifice only so that Uma would never go down in history as the one who brought the party the crown in Maharashtra. Which is why they have brought in Swaraj, they allege ? one who didn?t budge from her chair in the Rajya Sabha despite the rantings against Sonia, and one who has hardly anything to do with Savarkar. While a fuming sadhvi contemplates her sanyas in the Himalayas, another leader, already in forced sanyas, laments on his being left out of the Maharashtra show altogether. When asked about his absence from the scene, ABV is supposed to have told scribes, ?Shayed vahan meri zaroorat nahin hain?. Perhaps?

 While the media assess the PM every 100 days, 10 Janpath is seemingly conducting a regular review of its ministers? performances. Apart from the usual top scorers, a person who?s reported to have got a smiley from madam is K Natwar Singh. The man, known as a Cold War foggie, has supposedly won over even his detractors by his superb show. The 100-day record of this septuagenarian shows 62 meetings with foreign ministers, and interaction with at least 50 ambassadors or heads of missions in India. Not a mean achievement at all, considering that a major part of the 100 days must have also gone into travelling. Old, as they say, is gold.

 The minister for school education in Madhya Pradesh, Archana Chitnis, cannot fathom why everyone is so upset with her after she accomplished the rare feat of sending 21,000 rakhis on raksha bandhan. Well, the expense for this precious gift had not only to be borne by her department, but Chitnis also has teachers up in arms because she got members of this noble profession to do the menial job of ferrying rakhis for her. Poor Chitnis. She doesn?t understand why some brothers can?t run errands for a sister.

 After AK Antony?s exit, the spotlight shifted to two men ? ND Tiwari, who?s never been more uncomfortable in his chair as the CM of Uttaranchal, and Amarinder Singh, who never seemed more comfortable in his gaddi. Despite the poll debacle in Punjab, Singh made his position unassailable by the popularity generated by his controversial stand on the SYL canal issue. Now there is another feather in his cap. At the celebration of the 400-years of the Guru Granth Sahib, Amarinder summoned the state Congress chief, HS Hanspal, to read out Sonia Gandhi?s message to the congregation of the Sikh gentry before he spoke himself. The Akali leaders and the SGPC squirmed, but the job was done. Singh had given madam a rare honour, and added more cushions to his chair. Wonder if any such events are waiting to happen in Uttaranchal.

 The lieutenant general of Delhi is not Sheila Dixit?s only problem. There is also Jagdish Tytler, whose open defiance of the CM is raising many an eyebrow. Tytler seems to habitually drop out of meetings presided over by Dixit, even those that concern his own constituency. He, apparently, prefers to take up such matters with the urban welfare minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, than sit with Dixit. Tytler has even gone to the lengths of suggesting that it is Dixit who is orchestrating the campaign against him for his role in the 1984 riots. Tut tut! But is it really Tytler, or the long arms of 10 Janpath, trying to cut Dixit to size?

 This one is his own man, despite being projected as the sadhvi?s successor. Babulal Gaur in MP has dismissed not only the journos appointed by Uma Bharti as her advisers, he has appointed a three-member committee to probe the corruption in construction projects undertaken during Bharti?s times. Tough man! 

 The times, they are a-changing. At the AICC headquarters at 24, Akbar Road, the interiors now have a plush look ? new carpets, new sofa sets, new curtains, expensive chairs. Even the old computers are gone. They are said to have been replaced by state-of-the-art machines. Each day, fresh flowers are placed in vases that once showcased plastic ones. The AICC?s media department has never had it so good, even when Subbirami Reddy paid for its upkeep. Girija Vyas, who heads it, has reportedly brought in a huge table and marbles from Rajasthan. And at the gate, they say, there is no mercy for lesser mortals. Only those in chauffeur-driven fancy cars are allowed in. The winds of change are blowing even in the left offices. Both Ajai Bhavan and Gopalan Bhavan have been blessed with air-conditioners. But these, leftists swear, are only for the media. They are never switched on when the party discusses the poor in these rooms. Any takers for that?

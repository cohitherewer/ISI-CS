 Letters to Editor

 Retired hurt

 Sir ? Reading Bob Woolmer?s interview, where he reminisces about the former South African skipper, Hansie Cronje, was a touching experience (?If Hansie so desired, his team would have walked off the Table Mountain?, Nov 28). Woolmer is right in saying that the manner in which Cronje was hounded and shunned after the match-fixing scandal was uncalled for. Yes, Cronje made a mistake. But he also had the courage to admit it, while many cricketers continue to deny to this day charges of their involvement in this sordid episode. Why was Cronje singled out for such harsh treatment? Was it to save the skins of some big names who were just as guilty, if not more? Cronje should have been given a chance to give back something to the game he loved so much ? had he run a cricket academy and helped scout fresh talent, none but South African cricket would have benefitted. 

 Yours faithfully,

Akash Gupta, Calcutta

 The wrong choice

 Sir ? In ?The verdict and after? (Nov 26), Ashok Mitra talks about ?American imperialism? and the ?war of liberation against American might?? ideas that have become irrelevant today. Our denouncing the US through editorials and demonstrations has very little impact on the hawkish policies of the Pentagon. So it would be better if we learnt to live with this country and use it for our benefit. In his article, Mitra sheds copious tears for Iraqis, Vietnamese and Afghans, conveniently forgetting the plight of some people near home ? Kashmiris, people in the North-east or the farmers in Andhra Pradesh. Moreover, Mitra?s disparaging views about the US brings him dangerously close to lauding the terrorist attacks of September 11. 

 Indians are not the Chinese, their protests mean nothing to the US. One more thing. Mitra seems to favour the protectionist Kerry over Bush, who is in favour of outsourcing jobs to India. So, does he prefer unemployment in India to the fulfilment of the interests of the American working class?

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra?s interpretations of George W. Bush?s electoral success is rather amusing. He seems to have completely missed the point behind ?the Deep South and the backwoods of Middle America? voting for Bush. Bush?s victory is based on his conservative stand on gay marriage, abortion and stem cell research ? issues that are more important to American voters than a ?policy of global aggrandizement?. Mitra also seems to attach undue importance to India in America?s scheme of things. Europe and China have more influence on American foreign policy than India. One final question. Would Mitra please explain how Indians are going to be ?the most earnest supporters of imperialist wars the Americans propose to launch henceforth?, especially when these ?wars? are figments of the imagination of a few people like him? 

 Yours faithfully,

Supratim Sanyal, Maryland, US

 Sir ? Some of the views expressed by Ashok Mitra in ?The verdict and after? are contentious. According to Mitra, the US would find it difficult to win the war against terror. The same holds true not just for that country but also for other countries fighting the spectre of terrorism ? India in Kashmir and Russia in Chechnya. Mitra also says that the capitalists and prosperous agricultural producers are responsible for Bush?s victory. This is not true ? not all capitalists and agriculturists support Republicans. 

 Mitra?s contention about the US having imperialist designs is a product of his fertile Marxist imagination. It is no longer profitable to have colonies for raw materials, as the latter can be purchased in the international markets. Keeping a colony is a costly affair too ? the Indian government recently announced a Rs 24,000-crore package to appease the Kashmiris. Mitra would be well-advised to shed his 19th century mindset and get tuned to modern ideas.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra is at his acerbic best in ?The verdict and after?, blaming Americans for voting in favour of an imperialist government. Mitra is also right in asking the Indian government to deal cautiously with the US, more so since the Bush administration is close to Pakistan and outsourced jobs from the America have become a major source of income for Indian companies.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Six months back, my ration card was confiscated by the ration dealer as I had defaulted on drawing rice and wheat. However, I got the card back when local people intervened on my behalf. After this incident, I started drawing kerosene only from that particular shop. But two months ago, my kerosene supply was also stopped by the same man. He said that according to a new circular, kerosene would be now be sold at Rs 20-25 per litre. Most of the ration-shop owners are part of an evil nexus which includes criminals as well. Some have even confiscated the ration cards of their customers so that they could sell the kerosene denied to them at a premium.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Aslam, Calcutta

 RELIVING A PAINFUL PAST

This above all / Khushwant Singh

 Looking ahead

 Two nightmares no Indian would like to recur is the one following the assassination of Indira Gandhi and the other following the attack on the Sabarmati Express at Godhra railway station. In both cases, for crimes committed by a handful of criminals, the entire communities they belonged to were punished in the most diabolical way. What made these pogroms sinister was that the administration took no steps to prevent them and was even suspect of having connived with the perpetrators. If the first had been put down with an iron hand, the second might not have occurred. Since those responsible for the first remain unpunished, those guilty of the second may go scot free as well. Both are reminiscent of Nadir Shah?s order for a general massacre of the city?s population to teach it a lesson for the murders of a few of his soldiers. The main difference is that while Nadir was a foreign marauder, our two pogroms were carried out by our own countrymen. Nadir?s general massacre took place in the 18th century; our two took place in the 20th and 21st centuries in independent India. 

 I have never wanted to relive October 31 or November 1, 1984. I had to when I sat through Sashi Kumar?s Kaya Taran, meaning chrysalis or pupa of moth or a butterfly. It is based on a short story in Malayalam by N.S. Madhavan, entitled When Big Trees Fall ? words borrowed from Rajiv Gandhi?s explanation of the widespread anti-Sikh violence of November 1984. His story is based on a true incident in Meerut, where a Sikh woman and her seven-year-old son running to escape a gang of murderers were rescued and given shelter by nuns of a Catholic convent. Sashi Kumar expanded his theme and linked the killings of Sikhs in northern India with the killings of Muslims in 2002 in Narendra Modi?s Gujarat.

 Among the stars are Seema Biswas who acted Phoolan Devi in Bandit Queen, and the cricketer Bishen Bedi?s son, Angad. It is a highly emotional film with the moral, ?Never allow such things to happen again in our country.? Though the dialogue is in Hindi, it is far too sophisticated to make a box office hit; no songs, no dances but lots of tear-jerkers.

 Tomorrow is yet another day

 I had the privilege of having Zohra Sehgal and her Pakistani sister, Uzra Butt, over for dinner. Zohra is two years elder to me; Uzra two years my junior. Both sisters are fitter than I am both in mind and body. Zohra (92) has a phenomenal memory. She can recite reams of Urdu poetry by the hour without looking at a scrap of paper. I learn Uzra (88) does much the same in Lahore. The two sisters conceived, concocted and enacted a dialogue between them, Ek the Naanee (Once there was a grandmother), which draws packed houses in India and Pakistan. 

 What is the secret of their physical and mental fitness? From Zohra, I gathered that she eats very little and lives largely on soups and broths. She spends an hour every morning on the roof, strolling about and refreshing her memory of Urdu poetry. She has cut down her social life to the minimum and refuses to give interviews either on the phone or in person unless it is paid for. I chided her when she came to wish me on my 90th birthday. I said, ?Zohra, I hear you charge a fee for talking to anyone? Is that true?? She beamed a smile and put out an open palm of her hand, ?Haan ? yes, lao fees do, pay me at once.?

 From Uzra I picked up another clue to longevity. Both sisters had been with Prithvi Theatres and then with Uday Shankar?s dance troupe doing Bharata Natyam. I asked Uzra whether she was still dancing. ?There are not many takers for Bharata Natyam in Pakistan. But this time in India, I have been learning Odissi ? it is less mechanical and more sensuous. I find it more fulfilling.? I was amazed; to learn a new form of dancing at the age of 88 is truly defying the passage of years. 

 Moral: If you want to prolong your life, look forward to doing something in the tomorrows to come.

 The blundering sanyasin

 BJP now wonders, if it was sane

 or a sin, to put a Sanyasin

 to run the affairs of a State;

 It was not a Sadhvi?s cup of tea

 And it turned out to be

 Heady stuff that did create,

 Visions of grandeur, illusion

 of achievement great.

Bloated with praise she grew larger than life,

Generating envy, jealousy and strife.

The gloss dimmed, the veneer did crack,

To discredit and dethrone the party hack,

A court summon came handy excuse,

She had to be martyred; she couldn?t refuse

With loss of chair she had lost her base,

 In party too she didn?t find a place.

 She couldn?t stand the loss of glitter,

 And that made her jittery and bitter

 She breathed fire, became wild,

 Attacking left, right and the front,

Both Loh Purush could not stomach such affront? 

?It?s minority bashing?, came a hushed awaz

?An OBC Uma, Muslim Naqvi, Shahnawaz?

 It had to burst, this balloon blown

 And BJP should have known, 

They had to reap what they had sown.

 A hearty invitation

 Noted on a signboard in Chandigarh: ?Singh?s Chicken, Fully Airconditioned?

 Anniversary: Santa always pronounced J for Y or U. Dialect-wise he substituted B for V. He would utter, ?I am still a Jung man of 70. I served in union Bank of India for 40 years.?

 One day he invited Banta, ?You are most heartily invited to our bedding anniversary.? All the visualization of Banta ended up in smoke when he reached his home.

 MORE CHAOTIC THAN EXOTIC

 Malvika singh

 Sonia Gandhi has done it again. She has proved drawing-room critics wrong, all those who spent the last few years authoritatively claiming that the Congress, led by her, would not get more than double digits in the general election. Her party alone notched up 145 seats. The party those same drawing-room-wallahs supported, the BJP, dropped from 182 to 130 odd. Sonia Gandhi addressed a large and prestigious gathering at the Hindustan Times-sponsored summit in Delhi, and she made no bones about reminding all those scrambling around her, felicitating her, that they were totally off the mark, disconnected from the reality of India. They must feel rather foolish having led the ?foreigner? chant and discovering to their horror that they in fact were the foreign Indians. Reading this news, sitting in a village in Rajasthan, was rather heartening!

 With the winter settling into north India, visitors and travellers are flocking to the subcontinent. Rajasthan, for one, is crawling with tourists. All looking forward to an ?exotic? holiday, but being confronted with pot-holed roads as they travel from one fort to another, pimps and beggars accosting them at every corner, touts and hawkers waylaying them, pulling at their sleeves, conmen making hay, and wherever the babu has to play a role, harassment. With the Incredible India campaign swamping the world, some basic infrastructure should have been put in place. Major sites should have been cleaned, municipalities should have been ordered to remove excreta that adorns most imposing entrances to monuments and forts; information kiosks, legitimate money changing booths, clean public toilets, caf?s and simple necessities for all travellers should have been put in place. It takes nothing except determination.

 Plain foolish

 In most countries, tourism and culture are both interconnected and very important as an economic ministry because of the economic activity that it generates. Only in India, where there is great need for employment outside of the metropolitan cities and where the service sector needs to be supported and encouraged, where revenue generation is imperative, do we treat this area of activity as secondary and peripheral. We are just plain foolish. Tourism is a state subject, and is under the jurisdiction of state governments. Rules, regulations and the mindset towards travel, culture and tourism are therefore inconsistent, changing from place to place. This is a huge irritant for the traveller. The frequency with which ?rules? are changed at the whims of politicians and babus, makes it impossible for a substantial international appeal.

 Why would anyone in their right minds want to pay large sums and get harassed in return? Why would travellers who have paid for first-class travel and treatment, want to be subjected to sub-standard quality and high-handedness from petty officials? One way out would be to make tourism and culture a Central subject, with forest and environment. This way there will be a consistency in approach and attitude, and the industry could well go into a boom phase. At the rate we are going, India will, yet again, lose its position in the world of travel. Kerala showed the way, but Rajasthan has not been able to match that quality.

 New areas must be opened up and a cohesive policy towards travel and tourism needs to be put in place, one that is welcoming and not based on some archaic attitude of a bureaucrat who knows no better. Collectors who rule the districts need to be put through a crash course on etiquette and manners and need to be told that government interference should be minimal. The less the babu is allowed to fiddle, the better. Only then will India be able to attract the world to share its great heritage.

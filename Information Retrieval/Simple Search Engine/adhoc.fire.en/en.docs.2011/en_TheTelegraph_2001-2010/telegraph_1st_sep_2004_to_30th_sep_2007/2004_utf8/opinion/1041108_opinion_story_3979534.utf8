 TWO MORE

 There is nothing like rounding off the festive season with a bandh or two. And there is always something in the air that could be turned into a cause for ?popular? protest. The politics of bandhs in West Bengal now has a wicked life of its own that is impossible to subdue by any institution of the civilized world. The SUCI and the CPI(ML) Liberation have severally called two bandhs on November 17 and 22. The first is a 24-hour statewide bandh and the second a 12-hour one. There is a medley of things that are being protested against ? the rise in prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas, while vegetable are getting dearer. Besides, the Trinamool Congress has mounted a fresh bout of protesting against the Left Front?s alleged hobnobbing with criminals. This might well ripen into a bandh, inspired by the eminent muse of protests in Bengal, Ms Mamata Banerjee. There is a rudimentary political logic behind these bandhs, involving the state government?s ?secret understandings? with the Centre. But the great cause being served is, of course, the fate of the poor and the middle-class.

 The absurdity of these situations lies in this invocation of the ordinary citizen, on whose behalf these protests have to be kept up. Every right of the citizen is violated by these bandhs, and the illusion of a popular consensus still features as the rhetorical prop to these events. Paralysing the state at every possible level, causing every kind of inconvenience to ordinary life, bandhs undermine the very foundations of citizenship. The judiciary has tried to bring this back to order, but without the active cooperation of the police, its efforts have so far proved humiliatingly to no avail. Symbolically, the courts? ?failure? in this respect is perhaps the keenest measure of the lawlessness that political parties nurture in the state.

 DEEP, DARK BONDS

Tietam Brown, 

By Mick Foley,

Jonathan Cape, pound;10.25

Tietam Brown, a novel written by Mick Foley, 

weaves in various themes within its fold. For instance, the novel tells us the 

story of Tietam, a sadist wrestler with a terrible past. However, more specifically, 

Foley?s book talks about Tietam?s relationship with his son, Antietam (Andy) Brown, 

? a strange and disturbing bond which is marked by savage antagonism and bereft 

of warmth, love or affection. 

 Although Tietam is one of the key characters in this novel, the protagonist is, however, not the father, but the son, Andy. Both Tietam and Andy share a rather unique first name. This is so because there is a tragic history behind the family name of the Brown clan. Andy owes his first name to his great-grandfather, Sean Brown, who died in 1862, defending the Union in the battlefield of Antietam in Sharpsburg, Maryland, during the American civil war. This incident set a tradition in the Brown family ? the name, Antietam, became a part of first names in the family.

 Foley?s novel also incorporates psychological elements. For example, his narrative explores the trauma of Andy?s childhood. Andy lost his mother when he was only three years old. To make matters worse, he was also a victim of sexual abuse ? Andy was sexually exploited by the men with whom he was forced to stay. 

 These incidents left an indelible mark on Andy?s mind. When he could not take any more of this abuse, he decided to avenge his humiliation by wreaking a terrible revenge ? Andy hunts down his tormentors and kills most of them. Those who survived his wrath were left seriously injured.

 The novel begins with Andy, trying to turn over a new leaf after spending seven long years in a reform school. It is the early Eighties and Andy?s father, Tietam, receives his son cordially. About the same time, Andy, who is now a student at the Conestoga High School, falls in love with his classmate, Terri. 

 During his stay with his father, Andy discovers the darker sides of Tietam?s character. Andy?s father turns out to be a man who wallows in sexual promiscuity. Andy is forced to become a reluctant privy to his father?s sexual escapades. As a result of this, Andy?s personal relationship with his father deteriorates, culminating in a terrible climax. At the same time, his romance with Terri ends on a tragic note. Left alone with his sufferings, a forlorn and disconsolate Andy decides to dig into his father?s shady past.

 Nick Foley?s prose is crisp and engaging. The novel is also streaked with a dash of humour and suspense. On the flip side, the author?s depiction of Tietam?s sexual perversity is likely to leave the readers with a bad taste in their mouths.

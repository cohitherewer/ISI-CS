 A LITTLE MORE CREDIT FOR TILLING THE SOIL 

Integrating agricultural loans with the marketing of 

rural products may be one way to ensure greater offtake of rural credit, writes 

S. Venkitaramanan 

 Special needs 

Rakesh Mohan, presently secretary in the department 

of economic affairs and formerly a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, 

has written a comprehensive review of agricultural credit in a recent issue of 

the RBI bulletin. It is an insightful survey of the problems and prospects in 

this vital sector. He has placed the issue in its proper historical perspective, 

tracing the origin of its growth to the nationalization of banks and the introduction 

of allocations for priority sectors in the late Sixties. The survey is timely, 

since the government of India is set on course to double agricultural credit in 

three years, as promised by the finance minister in his last budget speech. Immediately 

after the budget, the finance minister had called meetings of the RBI and bankers. 

These have resulted in a burst of activity which has promised suitable actions 

to achieve the government?s ambitious goal. 

Over the years, the problems of agricultural credit 

have been analyzed threadbare by many committees of experts. There was the Khusro 

committee in the late Eighties, among whose far-reaching recommendations was the 

setting up of a national cooperative bank. The idea of an NCB, which received 

a rather hostile response from many quarters, has not seen the light of day. Perhaps 

it is just as well, with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development 

already fulfilling at least part of the role envisaged for the NCB. Then there 

is a recent painstaking study by V.S. Vyas which is still being considered by 

the authorities. 

A useful metric to measure the growth of agricultural 

credit is its ratio with the rural component of the national and state gross domestic 

product. This is so because the ratio of credit to GDP as a whole, instead of 

rural GDP, has to take into account the declining ratio of agricultural output 

to GDP, which is a feature of economic development in India, as in other countries. 

Mohan points out that the ratio of agricultural credit to rural GDP has risen 

steadily from 0.5 per cent in 1950-51 to 8.7 per cent in 2001-02. This compares 

with the slower growth of the ratio of agricultural credit to total GDP from 0.3 

to 2 per cent in the same period. The general increase in the former was primarily 

due to the impetus given by the nationalization of banks in the Sixties.

Mohan?s review points out that according to studies, 

there has been an increase in the share of credit from banks and institutions, 

leading to the marginalization of the money lender. The ratio of institutional 

credit to total resources required by farmers has gone up from 31.7 per cent in 

1971 to 63.2 per cent in 1981 and 66 per cent in 1991. However, these statistics 

should not mislead. They mask the continuing active role of the money-lender who 

acts as an intermediary even with respect to bank loans in rural areas. He is 

preferred as a convenient channel to take on and mitigate risks. He also has the 

ability to quickly assess the creditworthiness of the ultimate borrower ? the 

farmer. 

Be that as it may, the ground reality is that the 

farmer is still very much in the grip of moneylenders who, directly or indirectly, 

have control over marketing too. The stories of farmers? suicides in drought-prone 

areas usually turn on the compulsive demands for repayment of loans drawn from 

usurious moneylenders, by impecunious farmers, who are buffeted by adverse weather 

and market conditions. While it is true that the traditional money-lender is a 

pest, there may be some merit in incorporating him into the credit distribution 

network, subject to necessary safeguards. After all, even today, the money-lender 

disperses credit quicker, albeit at higher rates. The banks have to learn some 

of his methods, though not all.

The prospects of the finance minister?s thrust for 

increased spending depends a lot on the improved performance of commercial and 

cooperative banks. In this context, Mohan notes that the credit/state GDP ratio 

varies wildly in different regions of India. In the north, it is one per cent 

while it is two per cent in the south, for the period 1996-2001. This discrepancy 

in credit intensity is disturbing because it is the same bank management with 

similar mindsets that disburses more credit in the south compared to the north. 

Why do public sector banks lend more aggressively in the south for agriculture 

than in the north? This is an issue, which requires analysis in detail. While 

Mohan mentions this fact, he does not suggest a solution which may, perhaps, lie 

in removing the perceived difficulties in the north compared to the south.

Mohan?s review also addresses the perception of the 

higher risk in agricultural lending. He cites statistics of non-performing assets 

in agricultural credit which emphasizes that it is less risky than lending to 

other priority sectors, such as small-scale industries. The ratio of NPAs is 12.8 

per cent for agricultural lending as compared to 20.6 per cent for small-scale 

industries, but it is higher than the figures of 9 per cent for the non-priority 

sector. These figures seem to support the view that agricultural credit is more 

risky and that bankers have to be more cautious. 

While the government is right to focus on increased 

flow of agricultural credit, it must also tackle issues relating to risk mitigation 

in agriculture. This requires a holistic approach, including the extension of 

an appropriate insurance mechanism without transferring too much risk to the general 

fisc. Besides, reforms in laws, which would ensure the fear of quick repossession 

by banks in cases of default, will encourage bankers to lend to farmers more aggressively. 

Mohan discusses the difference between the Sixties, 

when the Green Revolution took place, and the circumstances today. At the time 

of the Green Revolution, agricultural output was more foodgrain-oriented than 

it is now, when the situation is characterized by greater diversification of output. 

There have also been systemic changes in the marketing structure. Increasingly, 

large distribution networks are taking over from small retail stores. Lenders 

to farmers have to factor in these new developments, including the need for facilities 

to handle horticultural produce. 

There is need to invest in cold-storage chains and 

warehouses for perishables, in general. Simultaneously, there has to be a modernization 

of credit ?products? available to lenders, in order to keep pace with the change 

of products in the agricultural and marketing set-up. Changes in demand patterns 

too are a result of increasing incomes, which lead to higher preference for non-food-grain 

items. As a result of modernization, consumers increasingly buy from large distribution 

networks, which are more efficient and offer supplies at lower costs. Credit flows 

have to fit these new trends.

The missing link in the credit structure seems to 

be the lack of integration with marketing. In this context, one must recall that 

the success of the milk revolution led by V. Kurien turned a great deal on the 

links between milk producers? marketing co-operatives and credit flows. Those 

who lent money to the milk producers were also involved in marketing the product. 

So much so that repayment dues were recovered from sale proceeds. A similar integration 

of credit and marketing may be feasible if lending institutions link closely with 

new marketing institutions, especially the supermarkets, who procure agricultural 

produce. A lien on sales by credit agencies is a sure way to recover loans promptly. 

Obviously, purveyors of credit face complicated problems. 

It is important that the solutions are not a mixture, as before, of tried and 

failed remedies. The time has come for holistic thinking, to integrate the approach 

to credit and marketing, to diversify lenders? products to suit the new agriculture 

and marketing environment. 

While the goals of P. Chidambaram are, no doubt, a 

good thing, they offer a difficult challenge to the ingenuity of North Block as 

well as the RBI. The farmers? commission led by M.S. Swaminathan, one of the architects 

of the Green Revolution, can play a useful role in initiating new solutions to 

the old problems of improving credit flows to agriculture. And on this depends 

the government?s efforts to alleviate poverty among the rural masses.

 FEELING UNSAFE

 Molesting women while worshipping the Mother is a typically Indian paradox. And the chief minister regarding this as evidence of the peacefulness of his state makes it even more typical. In the most recent and publicized case, the woman who was allegedly harassed and molested on the evening of Navami was Polish. So a senior policeman at Lalbazar feels patriotically enthused to salvage the reputation of his city in the eyes of the world. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has also noted the woman?s foreignness: she obviously did not know enough about his state when making such sweeping allegations about how unsafe it is for women. In all this chauvinistic damage control, the meaning and reality of violence against women in public spaces get cleverly brushed aside. A great many women strongly feel that this is not a stray case, as Mr Bhattacharjee would like to think, and that public occasions like the pujas or the Book Fair continue to make them feel unsafe.

 There have been two more reported cases of the ?outraging of women?s modesty? on Navami. (The phrase itself is a hive of problematic attitudes to women.) On Dashami night, in Ichhapur, four young men picked up a 14-year-old girl, who has alleged that one of them has raped her. The men are in custody, and the girl has been sent for medical tests. But a senior officer of North 24-Parganas police could not help adding that ?the girl doesn?t have a very good reputation either?. And this brief insinuation, made about a sexually roughed-up 14-year-old, reveals why a police station in West Bengal might feel just as unsafe to a girl or woman as schools, hospitals, roads or public vehicles, where numerous reported and unreported cases of sexual violence are played out every day. This is not simply a question of confused and brutalized gender relations, but also of local concentrations of power, especially party-political power. Nor is it a purely urban problem. The tackling of violence against women by the party-powered shalishi courts in the villages and districts also provides bizarre instances of ?conciliation? ? a rapist let off after being ?fined? Rs 10,000 in Murshidabad recently ? that trivialize violence against women in the same way as do more official forms of justice. What is at stake here is not just the issue of ?safety?, but the state administration?s understanding of the place of women in a civilized social order.

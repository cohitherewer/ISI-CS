 STRAIGHT OUT OF AFRICA

SCRIBBLING THE CAT 

By Alexandra Fuller, 

Picador, pound;16.99

?At least it?s not salvaged tourist meat in the deep 

freeze. Ha, ha.? Though Fuller laughs while making this comment, her discomfort 

is evident, and it becomes pronounced in the next sentence where she says that 

she once thought of this situation as improbable, not any more. 

 Such a situation will be ridiculous to most of us who will read this book, in all probability tucked away in some cozy corner of our secure worlds. We are aware of countries like Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. We know about wars, famines, AIDS and our awareness might at times lead us to imagine these horrors. Fuller takes us through them to reveal that our worst nightmare is the reality in Africa.

 Her previous book, Don?t Let?s Go to the Dogs Tonight, was an autobiographical work in which she relived her experiences of growing up in Africa. With Scribbling the Cat she returns again to the continent, this time to Zambia to to visit her parents.

 During this visit she meets her neighbour, K, a born-again Christian and a veteran of wars who bears the scars both mentally and physically. Driven by K?s memories and her own urge, they undertake a journey from Zambia via Zimbabwe to Mozambique, to visit the theatre of war and comprehend the past.

 What starts as a story of an aging man ? who was raped at the age of fourteen, was forced to join the war soon after school, was betrayed by his wife and who lost his son ? slowly becomes his confessions of the atrocities he and his mates had unleashed on black Africans. The past and the present intermingle in the book to create a ghoulish reality ? K narrates how he tortured a woman to death by shoving a whole spoon of sadza (porridge) into her private parts; Fuller narrates her more contemporary experience of meeting young boys who, on being offered potato chips by her, pretended that they were not half- starved. Yet Fuller knew that this was the first food that had passed their lips for some time. When these boys coaxed a cigarette from her, Fuller hopes ?no one was at home feeding chips and cigarettes to my children.? 

 There are some poignant moments. As when K says ?there are probably parts of Africa where almost anyone over the age of ten is an old soldier and has held an AK-47 in his hands and let its fire chatter into human flesh?, or when he says that the average mortality rate in Mozambique is 35 because if not war and starvation then surely AIDS will devour one by then. 

 Like Fuller one has to ask oneself how does it matter what kind of car one drives? what one eats? what one wears? ?When you get down to it, what can matter more than being alive? But then what? You?re alive and then??

 IN HOUSE

 It would have helped if ?family planning? had not become such a loaded term in post-Emergency India. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board is not too comfortable with it, although it is the vice-president of the board, Mr Syed Kalbe Sadiq, who has brought the subject up. But the term alone is not the reason for the board?s discomfort. Contraception has been a debated subject within the community, with learned opinions differing on its exact status vis-?-vis religious pronouncements. The immediate context of the vice-president?s concern is the recent census report. His wish to discuss steps to promote education and family planning among the less privileged in the community makes an implicit connection between the two issues. Education and family planning together could also turn out to be a two-pronged assault on poverty. However, there is a larger context to Mr Sadiq?s proposal. Reform is in the air in the community, and the board has already been debating changes in the norms of divorce according to the personal law. Some adjustments are also being made in the traditional education system. Relatively better-off and educated members of the community, especially in the cities, reportedly see the importance of contraception. They are certainly aware of the examples of countries like Bangladesh, Iran and Indonesia. 

 The arguments articulated against Mr Sadiq?s proposal have chiefly to do with the purview of the board?s powers. The issue shall be debated, but it would not be possible to implement any resolution that might evolve. Arguments based on interpretations of the religious law, too, have been propounded. Perhaps there is some substance in the milder objection that Mr Sadiq should have avoided making a public statement on the subject, since reform in various spheres is already taking place in the conservative community. Controversy could stall reform and the growth of awareness. There are indications that the birth rate among the minority community has dropped in West Bengal, although demographic changes because of infiltration may skew figures considerably. Political hijacking of the agenda ? the Bharatiya Janata Party has already expressed great enthusiasm ? could mess up a serious reform process too. Even though extraneous factors complicate the issue, the possibility of reform and modernization can only be promising.

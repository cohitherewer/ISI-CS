 BEYOND REVOLUTION

 Humanist above all 

M.N. Roy, Radical Humanist: Selected Writings 

Compiled by Innaiah Narisetti, Prometheus, $ 28

M.N. Roy was one of the foremost Indian revolutionaries 

and attained international fame early in his career. According to his biographer, 

Shibarayan Roy, he was ?...an unique figure...because unlike any other of his 

contemporaries, he took an active and leading part in revolutionary movements 

in four continents?.

 Roy (1887-1954) joined the revolutionary movement in Bengal in 1905. He was involved in the revolutionary movement in Mexico and was the founder-secretary of the Mexican Communist Party. Later, he was invited to Moscow and was closely associated with Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, Bukharin, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, Gramsci and other leading figures of the communist movement. His differences with Lenin on ?Colonial Questions? ? which were later included as supplementary thesis in the Second Congress of the Comintern (1920) ? brought him immediate recognition as a leading Marxist theoretician. He left Russia in 1928 and spent the next two years in Germany and other parts of Europe, before secretly coming back to India. 

 Thus Roy had the unique opportunity of observing two very powerful totalitarian political systems ? Stalinist socialism and Hitler?s Nazism ? closely. But he rejected both and instead came up with a philosophical theory popularly called ?Radical Humanism?.

 This book is a selection of essays which offers readers a glimpse of Roy?s political and philosophical ideas. Two chapters, ?The Way Out? and ?New Humanism?, are taken from Roy?s most famous book, Reason, Romanticism and Revolution. 

 Though Roy didn?t attempt a systematic formulation of his ideas, his approach to the contradiction between individual and society is pertinent even today. But his solution to the problem is fraught with contradictions. 

 Roy tried to broaden the scope of parliamentary democracy ? ?Parliament should be the apex of a pyramidal structure of the state reared on the base of an organised democracy composed of a country-wide network of people?s committees.? In India today, participatory government ? through panchayats and other bodies ? and the involvement of various citizens? forums and NGOs in development work, is being practised. But the limitations of these are also evident. Multi-party democracy may have saved us from totalitarianism, but political institutions are yet to become true vehicles of the people?s will. Foreseeing this, Roy had warned, ?Democratic practice should not be confined to periodical elections.? 

 But his solution to this is utopian ? ?...government composed of spiritually free individuals accountable...to their respective conscience, is the only possible guarantee for securing the greatest good to the greatest number.? This smacks of Lenin?s theory of relying on a group of professional revolutionaries to lead the backward masses in a social revolution. Aware of this, Roy tried vainly to defend his ideas from allegations of elitism. 

 Like many social philosophers, Roy was concerned that his theories were based on a strong ethical foundation. Roy even hoped that radical humanism would be able to accommodate and explain all social and philosophical problems. His formulation of the concept of freedom echoes Rabindranath Tagore?s thoughts on the subject (?Where the mind is without fear?), and his criticism of the role of political parties in a democracy is reminiscent of M.K. Gandhi?s musings. Again, unlike contemporaries, he believed that revolution should not be restricted to the political and economic arenas, but that there should be a simultaneous improvement in the fields of education, culture and health of the common people. One must admit that this approach has not lost its relevance and importance even today.

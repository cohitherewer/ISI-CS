 LEFT WITHOUT REASON

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The infantile questioning of government and its policies is carried on relentlessly by those men and women who opted to sit out ? the classic syndrome of the big bully who wants everything his way without the responsibility. Viewers switch channels the moment Bardhan appears on the screen that he is hogging these days. Uma Bharti?s appearances are a comic relief and contrasted to this is Manmohan Singh who remains dignified and purposeful. These varying images only enhance the growing respect for the prime minister. His opposition is doing his PR for him, and for free.

 We have news that all the consultative committees of the planning commission have been disbanded. Well done! But, true to form, the left is up in arms?the members want their representatives in government committees despite being in the opposition benches. They really are the giddy limit. They should just drop the government, bring in some khichri of a third front government with Mulayam and Surjeet at the helm, wait a few days for squabbles to start and we can go back to the polls next year. So much for the responsible left. They are painful. They are so dictatorial and arrogant. They want it all their way despite being a marginal national party. Great relief that all the consultants are out, right, left and centre and ?foreign?. The government should take whatever decision it thinks correct and get on with it. There is much to do and the last thing needed is frustrated grumbling from a generation past.

 Top heavy

 The French government?s position on turbans is a terrible insult. It is unimaginable that a ?progressive? country can be so utterly parochial. It is these ridiculous positions that nurture hate and give birth to violent retaliation. It is amazing how limited the intellectual calibre is of countries that are part of the first world?they behave like the fourth world when it comes to humane issues based on virtues such as tolerance. Will they allow Manmohan Singh, when he is on an official trip to their country, to visit a school, or enter the presidential palace? The French ambassador in India must answer this question. Indians need to boycott the embassy here for the racist stand of the French government. It is unacceptable in a civilized world.

 The BCCI saga was another nauseating happening. It has put cricket back to where it was just after the scandals of match-fixing had been exposed. It is all so corrupt, devious and manipulative that one wonders whether the only and true skill that Indians have is the great ability to function in an underhand manner. Amorality seems to be the name of the game, accepted as the norm, and we sure are playing it with aplomb. And, the final straw ? Bansi Lal?s son, the new cricket chief whip, assures us all that Dalmiya will not interfere in day-to-day functioning. In other words, he will merely manipulate and play his games from behind the scenes. Ouch!

 Gandhi Jayanti, and it is mandatory that no shop can lift its shutters ? business comes to a grinding halt and the atmosphere is one of depression. Surely his birthday should be celebrated, shops should be open, roadside haats should be encouraged, melas sponsored. People should be having fun, rather than be brooding with boredom and nothing to do, having to listen to the platitudes of politicians hailing the Mahatma and what he stood for as they themselves, with great perseverance, demean and destroy his values. This hypocrisy has become the recurring theme on October 2. It is time to change the mood, to reiterate the principles of honesty, austerity, integrity and pride. Those very men and women who have declaimed on television about the Mahatma need to shed their greed and corruption first, set the standard and lead the way from the ?top?. Will our leadership be able to rise out of their petty consumerist desires?

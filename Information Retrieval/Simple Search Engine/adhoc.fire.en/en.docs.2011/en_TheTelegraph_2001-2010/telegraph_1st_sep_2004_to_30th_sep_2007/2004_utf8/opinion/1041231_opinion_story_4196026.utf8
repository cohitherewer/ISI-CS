 HISTORY PASSED BY THEM

EUROPEAN CALCUTTA by Dhrubajyoti Banerjea (UBS, 

Rs 595) is subtitled, ?Images and Recollections of a Bygone Era?. It traces 

the growth of the city, under the impetus of the colonial project, from three 

non-descript villages on the banks of the Hooghly to its heyday as the capital 

of British India, and thence to its present decrepitude. Banerjea tells the story 

of Calcutta through those of its landmark buildings, its important thoroughfares 

and localities ? Lal Dighi, Writers? Buildings, St Paul?s Cathedral, Esplanade 

Row, Chowringhee. This book is valuable for the insights and anecdotes, gleaned 

from tomes in the Darjeeling Gymkhana Club and the Calcutta Club libraries and 

volumes of Bengal: Past and Present. But the rather stodgy arrangement 

and presentation of the rare photographs and sketches are a disappointment.

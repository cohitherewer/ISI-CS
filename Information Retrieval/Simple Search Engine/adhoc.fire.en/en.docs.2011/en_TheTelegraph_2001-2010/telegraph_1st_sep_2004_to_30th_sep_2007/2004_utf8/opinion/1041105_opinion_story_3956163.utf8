 WHAT?S COOKING?

 Something smells nice

 The more things change the more they stay the same. This is true of publishing as well. While there have been significant developments in publishing in the past decade, thanks to new print technologies and the internet, the steady sellers continue with previous popular themes. Books on topics of contemporary interest like business, do-it-yourself, health (especially yoga), human relationships and spirituality continue to have steady sales provided they are well produced and written for the common reader. Topics that seem to be on the way out are biographies and memoirs of celebrities who no longer have much clout.

 But cookery and travel are two areas that have shot up in the mass market. Every publisher has both on his list. Why? More leisure and more disposable middle-class income? Or is it because the media devote time and space to food and travel? Or because pricing is flexible, since plus or minus Rs 30 won?t make a difference to a potential buyer? It is all of these.

 That there is a growing crop of foodies interested in ?trying out? regional recipes can be seen by the steady growth of specialty restaurants that cater Goan, Bengali, Hyderbadi, Kashmiri or Awadi food in the metros. No longer is Indian food synonymous with north Indian Punjabi or south Indian cuisine. Publishers, who take their cue from market trends, have followed up by commissioning titles based on regional foods across a range not heard of before.

 But cookery books have two problems. First, chefs can?t write and thus their ?copy? has to be heavily edited or written by a ghost writer. The latter has to be a foodie of sorts with the ability to write clean copy, a combination not easy to find. Second, every cook-book has to be backed up by colour photographs of the dishes, which means a photographer who specializes in close-up photography with the proper equipment for lighting and shades has to be commissioned. Put these together and you have heavy originating costs added to the cost of manufacturing. But they are worth the investment because they sell, year after year. 

 Travel guides like Lonely Planet, Fedor?s, Thomas Cook Guides or our own Outlook Weekend Guides (a huge success story) telling you where to go, places to stay in, the cost of travel with tips on what to see have had an enormous response because of increased leisure travel. But travel guides have their problems: the cost of field research, the necessity of updating the information year after year and the cost of commissioned photos. Both cost a lot and unlike cookery titles, they are not one-off costs. But the traveller prepared to spend money doesn?t mind putting in an extra Rs 500 for a good guide.

 You can see a great many new titles in both areas because publishing has become part of the entertainment industry now.

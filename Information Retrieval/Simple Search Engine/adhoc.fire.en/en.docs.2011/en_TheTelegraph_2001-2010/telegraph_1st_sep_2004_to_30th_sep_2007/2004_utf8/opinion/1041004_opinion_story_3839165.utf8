 Letters to Editor

 On a turning track

 Sir ? It is very kind of the Board of Control for Cricket in India to clarify in court that it is a non-state body and that the Indian cricket team represents, not India, but the BCCI (?Govt caught behind in court?, Oct 1). In fact, this was a great relief, particularly for cricket-haters like me. We are now absolved of the responsibility of patriotically cheering for the ?Indian? team. At the same time, one feels a little sad for those ? including thousands of expatriate Indians ? who have been flocking to the grounds all this while thinking they were cheering their country. I suppose those Indians who feel inclined to support Pakistan in cricket will be able to do so without being sneered at. One hopes that our media, The Telegraph included, will now stop singing paeans to ?Team India?, since we have it on the best possible authority that there is no such thing.

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

 Sir ? The stakes were truly high. The winner would gain control over India?s fastest-growing one-billion-dollar cricket industry. Naturally, our politicians flocked to Taj Bengal. Their purpose: to become office-bearers of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. If successful in their mission, they could lay their hands on the BCCI pie, in other words, on the unchecked flow of wealth from advertisements and sale of telecast rights. 

 With stakes that high, the drama and suspense witnessed at the BCCI elections in Calcutta was only to be expected (??Umpire? Dalmiya bowls, wins, Sept 30). Sadly for India, where cricket is religion and cricketers are gods, politicians and non-sportsmen make money at the cost of the blood, sweat and tears of the Gavaskars, Kapil Devs and Tendulkars. I cannot recall a single cricketer who has become president of the BCCI. Look at the other cricket-playing nations such as Australia, England and West Indies, where the likes of Don Bradman, Colin Cowdrey and Clyde Walcott have been presidents of the respective boards. Only in India is it possible for sporting associations to become fiefdoms of politicians and businessmen.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why did the Union agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar ? also one of the main players in Maharashtra politics ? choose to spend three days in Calcutta, trying to become the BCCI president, when the Maharashtra assembly elections are just days away? Could it be because the post of BCCI president is one of greater profit and prestige than a berth in the Union cabinet? 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The hype around the BCCI elections is no measure of the task that lies ahead of the new president. There are at least seven cases against the BCCI in different courts of the country (?Cricket telecast war escalates?, Oct 2). The most prominent among these involve the telecast rights for the upcoming India-Australia series. It will be interesting to see how Ranbir Singh Mahendra, the new president, handles the current crisis.

 Yours faithfully,

Rasmita Rath, Cuttack

 Sir ? The election for the BCCI presidency and the finals of the ICC Champion?s Trophy were full of drama and thrill. At Edgbaston, England were the heavyweights, just as in the BCCI elections, Sharad Pawar was a bigger name than Ranbir Singh Mahendra ? rather like Ian Bradshaw who took the match away from England. Rain interrupted play in the Champion?s Trophy final, while wrangling over legal technicalities delayed the election process by quite a few hours in the BCCI elections. The only difference, probably, is that the West Indians are celebrating their hard-earned victory, while Ranbir Singh (or should we say Jagmohan Dalmiya?) cannot. There are just too may cases hanging over the BCCI?s head for the new president to celebrate. 

 Why can?t there be a regulatory body under the sports ministry to control the functioning of the sports associations just as there is a company law affairs department in the finance ministry to oversee private companies? Besides ensuring free and fair elections for the BCCI presidency, this would also spare us the humiliation of seeing our sportspersons being disqualified from the Olympic games?

 Yours faithfully,

M.R. Sridharan, Kanpur

 Sir ? It is ironic that while cricket has become the public obsession in India, cricket administration continues to remain the private circus of one or two individuals. Someone ought to file a public interest litigation for the results of the BCCI elections to be declared null and void. Also, a clause must be inserted somewhere in the rulebooks whereby only former and present cricketers may be eligible to become members of the game?s controlling bodies.

 Yours faithfully, 

Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? It might be a good idea to corporatize the BCCI (following the example of the International Cricket Council). The last resort would be to nationalize it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

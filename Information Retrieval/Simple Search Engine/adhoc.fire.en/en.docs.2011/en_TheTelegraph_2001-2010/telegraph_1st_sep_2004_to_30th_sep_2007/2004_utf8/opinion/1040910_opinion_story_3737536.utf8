 THE CRUEL SEASON

 NEHA SAHAY

 As in India, the season of heat waves, drought and floods is on in China. While the numbers dying in heat waves aren?t anywhere as large as in India, this year it reached 39 in just one city: Guangzhou.

 Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong, the province that was chosen to herald the new ?open door? policy of Deng Xiaoping in 1980. Now China?s richest province, Guangdong accounts for 28 per cent of the country?s foreign direct investment. Its capital is home to thousands of foreigners, and boasts of all the landmarks of China?s new metros ? international lifestyle brands, skyscrapers, traffic jams, western food outlets, an underground railway; seven-star government-run hotels where even the cleaning women wear rimless glasses. 

 With the highest per capita urban consumer expenditure in all of China, Guangzhou is one of the few cities to have banned beggars from public view. It is in Guangzhou that 39 persons died of heat stroke, the highest toll in any one city.

 Build up

 Almost all of these were construction workers, the youngest aged just 20. Most construction workers are migrant labourers ? among the unprotected sections in today?s China. Thanks to rapid urbanization, rising foreign investment and middle class incomes, the construction industry is one of the fasting growing industries here. The prospects of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the 2010 Asiad in Guangzhou have only boosted its growth. More and more migrant labourers bend double in the blazing sun building expressways, or perch themselves on scaffoldings, demolishing old buildings and constructing new commercial landmarks. All this contributes to making these cities hotter than ever. Guangzhou recorded 38 degrees thrice this summer; compared to thrice since 1951.

 Reports about construction workers being deprived of their wages and getting fired after injury appear quite often in the state-controlled press. But this summer, some lucky workers are being provided traditional Chinese tea, known for its ability to help body temperature adjust to climate, by contractors. As for the rest, they must simply follow the advice ? avoid working in the sun. 

 Adding to the heat

 But even those not working in the sun are inconvenienced by the heat wave. Lights are being dimmed in China?s neon-lit cities, thanks to energy shortages. One peculiar feature of China?s cities is the coloured lights everywhere at night, not just on billboards. Bars and discos have dazzling lights in the gaudiest of colours. But strangest of all are the horizontal bands of coloured light lining the terraces of tall buildings, and the laser searchlights from the top of skyscrapers.

 Guangzhou?s motorists have been complaining that the bright lights are a major cause of accidents, but only when energy consumption outstripped supply was a decision taken to dim neon lights after 10 pm. In Shanghai, neon lights are switched off whenever the temperature goes above 35 degrees.

 Like the heat, the energy shortage also affects different sections differently. While small workshops have been shut down for now, commercial users in big cities have been directed to keep air-conditioners set at between 24 and 28 degrees, instead of 22. Air-conditioning is the norm in urban China: many heat wave victims have been babies and old people unable to adjust to frequent air-conditioner use. In Beijing, the municipal office has been switching off its air-conditioners between 6 pm and 7am. Guangdong has scrapped the 10 per cent discount on power rates. Conventional measures followed by less affluent societies such as power cuts and staggered working hours are also being followed, with even bureaucrats sweating it out once a week.

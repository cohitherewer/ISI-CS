 GROWING PAINS

 How much will real gross domestic product growth in 2004-05 be? Given the high base following 8.2 per cent growth in 2003-04 and the negative impact of the monsoon, most forecasters will bet on around 6.5 per cent, about 0.5 per cent having been shaved off from earlier predictions, although the monsoon was not as bad as was originally feared. The first quarter figure of 7.4 per cent is therefore a pleasant surprise for the government and the ministry of statistics and programme implementation is already crooning about 2004-05 growth possibly crossing 8 per cent. The ministry bases its optimism on first quarter growth being broad-based across all major sectors, compared to 2003-04. For instance, both manufacturing and services produced 8 per cent, while agriculture had 3.4 per cent. 

 There are three caveats to the ministry?s optimism. First, first quarter growth in 2003-04 was 5.3 per cent and the higher base effect will therefore materialize later. Then, some of the GDP growth in the last couple of years was driven by the construction sector, especially road construction. Yet, the first quarter of 2004-05 shows a construction growth of 3.6 per cent, compared to 5.9 per cent in that of 2003-04. That does not augur well for the national common minimum programme target of 7 to 8 per cent growth.

 Third, the link between monsoon, agricultural growth and GDP growth is complex. For example, there was a good monsoon in 2003-04 and this resulted in a good rabi crop in 2004. The consequent income growth and increase in agriculture-led demand affect not only the first quarter of 2004-05, but possibly also the second quarter. So the impact of the inadequate monsoon of 2004-05 is yet to be felt on the GDP figures. How bad was the monsoon really? What is important is not just overall rainfall, but also its spatial and geographical distribution. In hindsight, the kharif crop of 2004 was not that bad, although it is too early to judge the rabi of 2005. Because of timelags, any agriculture-cum-monsoon-led disaster will not be felt before the third quarter of 2004-05. So the third and fourth quarters are when the government should celebrate. The Planning Commission has already confirmed the obvious, that the tenth plan?s growth target of 8 per cent is now impossible. While in opposition, the Congress argued that the National Democratic Alliance had reduced India?s trend rate of GDP growth from around 6.5 per cent to around 5.3 per cent. Now that it is in government, the United Progressive Alliance has to figure out how to jack up growth, if not to the tenth plan?s 8 per cent, at least to the NCMP?s reduced target of 7 to 8 per cent. Despite the NCMP, that plan has not emerged, notwithstanding expenditure in social and rural sectors promised in the NCMP. If anything, the Planning Commission has highlighted the incompatibility between this increased expenditure and deficit reduction targets.

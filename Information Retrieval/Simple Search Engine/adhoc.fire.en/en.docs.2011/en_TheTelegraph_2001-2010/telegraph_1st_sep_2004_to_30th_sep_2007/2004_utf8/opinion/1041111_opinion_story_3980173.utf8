 Letters to Editor

 Rubbing it in

 Sir ? Laloo Prasad Yadav?s wisecrack about the hike in fuel prices helping diabetics must rank alongside Marie Antoinette?s command to ?let them have cakes? in callousness (?Galloping gas price; oil to cost more?, Nov 5). There is a time for levity and there is a time for seriousness. The government had no choice but to raise domestic oil prices in view of the sky-rocketing international prices. Also, there is no denying that it will hit the middle class, if not the poor, very hard. So there was need to explain the decision and assuage fears. Yadav?s rubbing it in confirms all our notions about the government?s inherent insensitivity. Perhaps Yadav can afford to be insensitive because higher fuel prices do not affect Bihar where the roads are almost unmotorable, and where most people are too poor to need LPG. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Roy, Calcutta 

 Worst case scenario

 Sir ? Zahira Sheikh?s U-turn on the eve of her appearance before the Mumbai court indicates the pressures at work on her (?Worst nightmare in Best case?, Nov 4). That the case had to be transferred to another state is itself a travesty of justice. Zahira should be left alone. There are hundreds of other cases in Gujarat which need to be looked into. The Supreme Court should, suo motu, take cognizance of these cases and probe the reasons for witnesses turning hostile. Unless this is done, the delay in delivering justice will make a mockery of the legal process. One of the greatest tragedies of communal riots is that the guilty always get away without punishment. We have to wake up to this fact and modify our laws in such a way that the state can also be made culpable for these crimes.

 Yours faithfully,

Ram Puniyani, Mumbai

 Sir ? The hearing of the Best Bakery case should be stopped immediately as both money and valuable time are being lost on the case without any result. Zahira Sheikh has lost her credibility in the public eye. Her repeated turnarounds will have serious repercussions, as others may lose the courage to remain consistent in their statements. As far as Teesta Setalvad is concerned, it is immoral on Zahira?s part to bring baseless allegations against her.

 Yours faithfully,

Diana Sahu, Cuttack

 Sir ? Zahira Sheikh?s ever-changing testimonies in the Best Bakery case prove that she is not faithful even to the memory of her family members who were burnt alive. Her motive is anything but respectable. It is a pity that nongovernmental organizations have placed their faith on such a person to uphold the flag of secularism.

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjoy Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir ? The prime witness in the Best Bakery case has managed to fool the nation and its judiciary repeatedly. She should no longer be allowed to continue with the sham. The courts should investigate whether money has changed hands. Other riot victims have also pointed fingers at NGOs, accusing them of using the victims to further their own interests. The allegation should be properly looked into. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? However hoarse secularists may cry about Zahira Sheikh?s loss of credibility, the episode has only exposed the truth about the lives of the Gujarat riot victims who are caught between the devil and the sea. Nobody, be they politicians or social activists, has any real concern for the lives, peace and wellbeing of the people who suffered. While the Hindutva brigade was after their lives, honour and property, the secularists are exploiting them for their political or personal agenda. Qutubuddin Ansari, the famous face of the riot, was given a hero?s welcome in Calcutta, and was thoroughly exploited for political reasons before and during the Lok Sabha election. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? No one can stoop so low as Zahira Sheikh. She is humiliating the woman who tried to seek justice for her. Does it not appear strange that instead of taking Zahira to task for harassing and defaming the state government and pushing so many ?innocent? people behind bars, Gujarat should accord her a hero?s welcome? 

 Zahira?s irresponsibility will have a serious fallout. It will now thoroughly discourage NGOs from pressing for justice for the Gujarat victims. She should be punished for misleading the court and wasting its time. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It will remain a mystery why Zahira Sheikh retracted her statement. She was fighting for those who had lost everything in the Gujarat riots ? their family , their homes and even their identity. She was their only chance of getting justice. Her changing of her statement shows that she is either under intense pressure from political leaders or that she has sold herself for the sake of wealth and a better life.

Yours faithfully, 

Syed Shaarikh Ahsan, Jamshedpur 

 Sir ? Zahira Sheikh?s going back on her statement means that the Narendra Modi government will now manage to browbeat the judiciary and human rights activists like Teesta Setalvad. Public opinion in the country is not strong enough to take on Modi and his goons, who are hellbent on saving the guilty. The only way to insulate the witnesses from pressure from outside is to take them into protective custody. The order for Zahira?s arrest can be issued either by the apex court or by the trial court.

 I recall an instance when some policemen in Calcutta were accused of raping a woman inside the police station. A conscientious police commissioner had the victim detained in the police headquarters till her deposition was over. The accused were all convicted.

 An attempt to influence witnesses amounts to contempt of court. But the law to save witnesses from harassment and intimidation is inadequate and needs to be spruced up.

 Yours faithfully,

Syed Ataunnabi, Calcutta

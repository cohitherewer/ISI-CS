 THREAT VALUE

 The dollar is under threat. In the last three years, it has dropped by 35 per cent against the euro and 24 per cent against the yen. Left to the market and free of distortions, a currency?s equilibrium value is impossible to determine a priori. However, there are estimates that the dollar might drop by 30 per cent more. This has implications for international trade and payments, much beyond the present blame game. In this, it is easy to pick on the United States of America, with a current account deficit projected to be 6 per cent of the American gross domestic product in 2006. High US government borrowing and low household savings drive this current account deficit, and the magnitude is such that most other countries in the world would have been driven bankrupt. That has not happened yet because foreigners have been willing to finance the deficit by investing in US assets, although there are signs that, with inevitable dollar depreciation, this is changing. This is more than a matter of purchasing future dollar sets, because estimated at $ 11 trillion, the stock of dollar stocks is considerable and might also be pulled out. In an unipolar world, with the spectre of terrorism, the American position seems to be that foreigners ought to continue to subsidize the US, and cuts in American government expenditure are out.

 On the face of it, this is an untenable proposition, but the truth is more complicated. Several Asian economies (China is not the only one) have, de facto or de jure, pegged their currencies to the dollar. To ensure export competitiveness, currencies have not been allowed to appreciate and dollars have been bought, contributing to global liquidity that manifests itself in asset bubbles and low US bond yields, stimulating US consumer expenditure.

 To add to the problem, lacklustre growth in Europe and Japan has added to American current account deficit. Looking beyond the blame game, it is obvious that the status quo is in for a shock and this transcends worries about export competitiveness consequent to a depreciating dollar, a worry that also recurs in India. In international payments, the dollar has functioned as a reserve currency, and the euro is not yet in a position to be a viable substitute. As the early Seventies demonstrate, such erosion has given painful shocks to the global financial system, and costs will not be borne by the American economy alone. There is the real prospect of rising interest rates driving the US economy into a recession. Compared to that kind of exchange-rate adjustment, slashing the budget deficit is globally an easier option, although it is a hard one for the US.

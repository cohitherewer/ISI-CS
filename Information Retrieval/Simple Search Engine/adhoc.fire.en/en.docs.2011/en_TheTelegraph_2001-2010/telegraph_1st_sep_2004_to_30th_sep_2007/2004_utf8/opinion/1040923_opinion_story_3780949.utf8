 Letters to Editor

 Don?t go by the rules

 Sir ? The national security advisory board headed by J.N. Dixit has not been very innovative in drafting the ?national anti-hostage taking policy? (?Delhi policy gun for hostage crisis?, Sept 20). Does a change in stance from ?no negotiation? to ?no compromise? really make sense? There is a very thin line separating the two. If there is another hijacking like the one in Kandahar, it is difficult to believe that the government will want to give up the option of a mutual agreement by paying a ransom or exchanging jailed terrorists for the hostages? freedom. Besides, it has often been seen that more resourceful countries have failed to tackle hostage crises despite having stringent policies and laws. To attempt to stick to rules in such situations, as the draft suggests, would be absurd. It would have been more practical had the board spent its time and resources in appointing people adept at finding a way out, according to the exigencies of the situation. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Amit Das, Calcutta

 Hardly novel

 Sir ? The tone of Ashok Mitra?s article, ?Prisoner?s dilemma? (Sept 17), was refreshingly different from the reverence with which the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and similar such international financial institutions are usually written about. If one read only the English newspapers in India, one would be convinced that the above mentioned agencies have never done any wrong, even though almost every country that has attempted an IMF programme has experienced either a collapse in growth or a large increase in poverty and inequality. It is now commonly known that the east Asian crisis was greatly aggravated by the IMF and the World Bank. Yet it is too much to expect our fawning economic commentators to mention this. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shankar Gopalakrishnan, London

 Sir ? As an economist, I have to say that ?Prisoner?s dilemma? was all sound and fury signifying nothing. What are the exact complaints that Ashok Mitra has against the Washington Consensus? What is he advocating? That the left should not have complained, protested and obstructed the induction of representatives of the IMF and American consultancy agencies into internal official committees that shape the government?s economic policies? Then again, is he really advocating that the states be given the autonomy to print money? 

 This article is yet another example of the repressed emotions that are conveying a sense of hopelessness about what the future holds for India. There have been many instances where academics have pointed out potential social and economic problems (without giving adequate explanations for them) but have offered no constructive suggestion as to how such problems can be solved. May we hope to dismiss such ad hoc scepticism and look for a more constructive suggestions from intellectuals like Mitra?

 Yours faithfully, 

Shanto Ghosh, California

 Learn the lesson

 Sir ? The suicide of 16-year-old Priyanka Das raises many questions, especially as she blamed her geography teacher for driving her to take the extreme step (?Blaming teacher, girl kills herself?, Sept 17). But the incident should be enough reason for school authorities to sit up and take note of some teacher-student relationships ? more so the manner in which many teachers handle students. 

 Teachers have to be more sensitive to the fact that primary and secondary school students have impressionable minds. Schools must create a secure and confidence-building environment for them. Excessive criticism will only push students to further stress and pose a deterrent to their growth. 

 Yours faithfully,

Manav Jalan, Calcutta

 Sir ? The survey conducted by non-governmental organizations after Priyanka Das?s suicide has highlighted how the lack of self-esteem is increasingly becoming a big problem among schoolgirls. Another point needs to be mentioned in this context. 

 Many students, usually in the English-medium schools, come from affluent families. They are often the only child or with one sibling at the most, and much pampered. This makes it difficult for them to develop self-confidence. It is common in Calcutta to see parents accompanying their children whenever they appear for an important examination. By being overprotective, parents prevent the child from learning to take important decisions on his own. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abdus Samad, Incheon, South Korea

 Sir ? Suicide seems to have become an easy way out for many children. While the authorities look into the whys and wherefores of the matter, the plight of parents need to be taken into consideration too. Many of them face economic constraints, and the ever-increasing school fees are becoming a burden for many. One cannot discount the fact that this reason may drive many students to commit suicide in the future.

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

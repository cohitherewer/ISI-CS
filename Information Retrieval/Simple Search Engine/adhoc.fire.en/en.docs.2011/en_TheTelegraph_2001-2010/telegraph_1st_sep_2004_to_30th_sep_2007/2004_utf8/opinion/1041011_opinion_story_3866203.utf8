 TRADING CHARGE

 Pavements are for everything but walking. Calcutta has never been kind to pedestrians, and the wide, even pavements once laid out along its broader streets have been subjected to various unhappy fates long since. For a long time many lay in miserable disrepair, their trenches and heaps of loosened stones traps for the unwary ankle. Although some of these have now been sacrificed to the project of widening thoroughfares, others have been taken over by traders of all kinds and degrees of prosperity, ranging from those who lay out their wares on a piece of cloth on the broken flagstones to those who have perfectly respectable looking shelters and electric lights in their shops. The pedestrian is forced on to the road or dangerously close to the outer edge of the pavement, unless he wants to get caught up among the crowds of buyers who surround each stall. The public interest litigation asking for the removal of illegal bazaars in the Metiabruz area is therefore extremely useful; it is just surprising that similar PILs were not filed earlier.

 The Calcutta high court has ordered the removal of all illegal bazaars that block movement, cause traffic jams and increase pollution. This initiative, if taken seriously, will not only be of immense use to citizens, but it will perhaps also give the city a slightly less untidy look. The sight of heaps of offal next to temporary grocery stalls hardly inspires positive feelings about the civic sense of the city?s inhabitants. The order has been given an interesting twist. The court has asked the complainant organization to put in advertisements in the newspapers advising citizens to become members of the ?bazaar hatao? campaign. Citizens? participation is of great importance in a project of this sort. The advertisements will do the job of both informing the readers and raising awareness. It would additionally mean addressing at least one major component of the problem: the buyer whose patronage allows the illegal bazaars to flourish. That the bazaars are there at all has more to do with the patronage of politicians and policemen, but such a power nexus would become useless if the buyer is successfully weaned away. That is not easy, because uncivic habits are as intransigent as illegal bazaars. But a people?s movement for better living conditions is likely to be more sustainable than an occasional court order and a series of PILs.

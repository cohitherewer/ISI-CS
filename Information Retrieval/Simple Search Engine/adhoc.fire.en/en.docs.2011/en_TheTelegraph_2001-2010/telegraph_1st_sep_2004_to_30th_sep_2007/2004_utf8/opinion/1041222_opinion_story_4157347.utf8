 CASHING IN

 How politicians thrive on a votes-for-cash strategy is one of the worst kept secrets of Indian democracy. But only someone like Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav can brazenly pretend that there is nothing wrong about it. There is a sinister disregard for all norms and codes of public conduct in his seemingly ridiculous reaction to the Election Commission?s charge against him. Faced with apparently irrefutable evidence, he could not deny that he had distributed money to some people even after the schedule for the assembly elections in Bihar had been announced. What he did was even more offensive ? he sought to defend his action in the name of the people. It may be tempting to laugh at his attempted self-defence, but it is no laughing matter. The plea that he had distributed the money to people who had wanted him to ?greet them with sweets for becoming the railway minister? is too facetious to be taken seriously. 

 But Mr Yadav?s cynicism brings into focus a deeper malaise in the electoral system. It is not that politicians do not know what actions of theirs or those of their parties constitute a violation of the EC?s rules. It is their open manipulation of the popular will and their shameless subversion of the law that threaten Indian democracy. Mr Yadav knew that he had violated the rules, but he obviously thought that he would not be held accountable for doing so.

 Unfortunately, years of lukewarm responses by the EC to such abuses emboldened the politicians. They became reckless in their use of money, muscle power and other unfair methods because they feared no punishment. The EC?s action against Mr Yadav and his Rashtriya Janata Dal reflects a new anxiety to clean up electoral politics. In fact, the party faces a truly difficult test. While the EC has sometimes taken individuals or parties to task for indulging in unfair electoral practices, it has never before threatened to de-recognize a party on such charges. This should be a warning to all politicians and parties who routinely violate the poll codes. This is a lesson also for the parties which have their own reasons to gloat over Mr Yadav?s discomfiture. Irrespective of whether the RJD eventually loses its recognition or not, the EC must use the opportunity to discipline the parties. The episode must have come as a major embarrassment for the United Progressive Alliance and also for the Congress, which is the RJD?s electoral ally in Bihar. The Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies in the National Democratic Alliance would naturally see an opportunity in it. But the larger interests of democracy and of a healthy political process demand that the parties help the EC?s clean-up drive. Buying or selling votes is an insult to the people whom the politicians claim to represent. Politicians have played the dangerous game for far too long.

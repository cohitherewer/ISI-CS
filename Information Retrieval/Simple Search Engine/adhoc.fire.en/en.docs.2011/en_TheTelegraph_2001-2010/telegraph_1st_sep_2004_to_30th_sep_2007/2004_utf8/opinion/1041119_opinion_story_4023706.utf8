 WITH A MISSION IN MIND

 From Oslo to Iraq and the Road Map: Essays By Edward W. Said, Pantheon, $20.50

 Apart from his stature as the foremost intellectual of his time, Edward Said was also a spokesman for the cause of Palestine. He himself was an Episcopalian Christian from Nazereth. This book brings together some of Said?s last essays on events in west Asia and the attempts to arrive at a workable peace. They cover the period, December 2000 to July 2003. They thus end with the breakdown of the peace process through the Israeli reoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza, 9/11, the US bombing of Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. All the essays collected here, save one, were contributed to Al Ahram, an Arabic newspaper published from Cairo. English readers thus get an idea here of what Said had to say to an Arab audience. He argued with a passion that the West had failed to understand Palestinian humiliation. In these essays, Said is seen to be pursuing three interconnected themes: the truth about the Israelis? treatment of Palestine; the need for Palestinians and other Arabs to accept the reality of Israel and to engage with it; and the failure of Arab leadership. 

 ALL THE DICTATOR?S MEN

 Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar By Simon Sebag Montefiore, Phoenix, ?9.99

 Stalin was a dictator par excellence and the horrors he unleashed on the people of Russia have also been written about. This book is about the small coterie that surrounded Stalin and helped bolster his rule and his oppression. Stalin had his inner circle and the coterie was formed of men like him, as mean and mediocre. The inner circle was also haunted by intrigue, betrayal,brutality and even debauchery. Stalin was at the centre and rather enjoyed the sordid life. The company he kept when he was at the height of power was in sharp contrast to the company he was forced to keep in the original Bolshevik Party. The latter under Lenin, especially the leaders, consisted of men of high intellectual calibre who lived simply and were committed to the cause of revolution. Stalin?s coterie resented any form of intellectualism, most of it consisting of boors who hankered after power, privilege and women (often each other?s wives). Montefiore narrates a sordid tale with a remarkable grasp over sources, many of them unknown and untapped.

 DULL BUT WORTHY

 Dalit Assertion and the Unfinished Democratic Revolution: the Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh By Sudha Pai, Sage, Rs 550

 The emergence of the BSP as a major political force in Uttar Pradesh has upset many a political apple cart. For one thing, it has completely taken away the Harijan (read Dalit) vote from the Congress. The BSP represents Dalit empowerment and political articulation. In this heavy-duty monograph, Sudha Pai analyses the social transformation BSP represents. This is a worthy book and, like most worthy tomes, very dull. It can only be read through with many a suppressed yawn.

 Letters to Editor

 Sing, dance, and be an idol

 Sir ? The Oxford English Dictionary says than an idol is ?a person or thing that is admired very much? or ?a statue that is worshipped as god?. These days, with the nation-wide craze among the youth to become the ?Indian idol?, it seems attaining idolhood is easy. There are also India?s Best Cine Star, Super Singer and many more talent-hunt programmes on the many cable television channels, which try to cash in ? and with great success so far ? on middle-class India?s desire to be part of the glamour world. But can anything be more absurd than this? Brain is not something that is required to be successful in these competitions, which have sparked off a mad rush among young boys and girls to possess the perfect body. With programmes such as Item Bomb gaining ground, things can only get worse from here. Perhaps we should be thankful that we still have shows such as India?s Child Genius.

 Yours faithfully,

Akash Das, Jamshedpur

 Conserve that energy

 Sir ? National Energy Conservation day was celebrated on Dec 14. Energy resources are depleting every day, and the rate of depletion is accelerating with development. Use of renewable resources is not getting as much popularity as it should. Coal is the only dependable solid fuel which is expected to keep the Indian industry running for decades to come. The current reserve of coal is estimated to be 240 billion tonnes. At the present rate of consumption, it should be able to cater to the requirement of thermal power plants for at least 250 years from now. But the way coal is produced in India is extremely wasteful. A considerable amount of coal is allowed to get lost. A little effort can extend the coal age for the country.

 All coals in virgin state contain coal bed methane, which is primarily methane gas, with small amounts of carbon dioxide or nitrogen. This natural gas is trapped in the cleats, cracks and fissures of the coal in the form of solid solution. Almost all the coals, coking or non-coking, high-ash or low-ash, contains CBM in small or big quantities. The gas remains intact in virgin coal, but starts oozing out the moment the coal is de-stressed during mining by underground or opencast methods. The methane present in coal beds has caused disaster in underground coal mines all over the world. To reduce the hazard from methane explosions, mines are ventilated to reduce the methane content in the underground mine atmosphere. The methane gas thus released from the coal mines goes to the atmosphere to add to the greenhouse gases. 

 Recently, the government has identified a few coal blocks, which have been allotted to public sector units and private entrepreneurs for exploration and extraction. However, harnessing of CBM from those blocks and commercially utilizing it is still a distant dream. Further, those coal blocks are all in the virgin areas, where actual mining is not expected to happen before 35 to 40 years. And what about the working mines where methane gas goes up to the atmosphere every day? 

 The rate of emission of methane from a coal mine of Degree I to III gassiness in India varies from 1-10 cubic metres per tonne of coal output. One can imagine the huge quantity of CBM that is going to the atmosphere if left untapped. This natural gas, if extracted from the mines, can help the nation in two ways. One, it will be a new source of eco-friendly fuel that can be used for the generation of electricity, running of automobiles, and so on; and two, it will arrest the increase of greenhouse gases. 

 Another energy resource that is not getting wasted is the coal reserves in the thin seams. Extraction of the thin coal seams (less than one metre) is not viable by the present mechanized underground or opencast mining methods. As a result, these seams are not extracted and are either left unused, or thrown in the spoil heaps in opencast mines. Technologies are available to gasify these coals under the ground itself and use the gas as fuel for various purposes, including generation of electricity. In the current scenario of limited energy resources, these amount to criminal wastage. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided last year that crude oil price should swing between $ 22-28 per barrel and now it is hell-bent upon ensuring that the price does not fall below $43. This is bound to have adverse repercussions on the economy of the third-world countries. Under these circumstances, these countries must try to reduce/replace imported oil by raising their levels of electrification, and stressing on hydel and nuclear power, gasification of coal, coal washing, implementation of CBM schemes, producing hydrocarbon indigenously or through foreign collaboration, and finally, by encouraging renewable energy. Unfortunately, as far as India is concerned, there is little transparency in disclosing the details of the policies.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

House on air 

 Sir ? The launch of two dedicated channels for transmitting live the sessions 

of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha appear to be a sheer wastage of public money (?House 

goes live on DD?, Dec 14). As it is, the telecast on DD-I was one of the least-viewed 

programmes, where one could see only mud-slinging, quarrels and shouting by members 

of parliament. Although it is immensely entertaining to see the antics of our 

MPs, one has to skip office or professional duties to be able to watch the telecast. 

And there are only a few in both houses who are capable of attracting viewers? 

attention through their oratorical skills. The money would have been better spent 

on building social infrastructure. 

Yours faithfully,

S. Chaudhuri, Guwahati

 Sir ? Somnath Chatterjee did the right thing by pulling up Doordarshan for blacking-out the proceedings of the Lok Sabha on December 2 and telecasting the cricket match between India and South Africa instead. Chatterjee should also ask Doordarshan to make its programmes such as Sansad Samachar and Parliament News livelier by including video-clips from day?s proceedings in parliament.

Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

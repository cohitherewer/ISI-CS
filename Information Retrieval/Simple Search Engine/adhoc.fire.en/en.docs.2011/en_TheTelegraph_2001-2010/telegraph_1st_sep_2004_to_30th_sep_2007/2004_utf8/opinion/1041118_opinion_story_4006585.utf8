 Letters to Editor

 Shame on screen

 Sir ? As an admirer of the works of Bibhuti Bhushan Bandyopadhyay and Satyajit Ray, I was ashamed to find that Bengalis (and Indians) have been so unsuccessful in protecting and promoting their cultural treasures. At a special screening of Aparajito at the Arts Picture House in Cambridge recently, I was overwhelmed to see that the house was almost full with mostly British film-lovers. But no sooner did the film start than the poor quality of the print made the audience feel uneasy. The sound was equally poor, especially in the first half of the film. The sub-titles were inadequate, and many scenes depicting various aspects of Bengal?s rural life went without sub-titles, as did some dialogues in Hindi. Even the name ?Aparajito? was unexplained. It must be to Ray?s credit that nobody left the hall. The organizer finally announced that a complaint would be lodged with the distributor so that future film shows do not suffer. The next screening is Apur Sansar, and I already feel apprehensive.

 Yours faithfully,

Joyobroto Sanyal, Cambridge

 Sir ? The detention of the sankaracharya of Kancheepuram, Jayendra Saraswati, could trigger off a nightmarish series of events (?Kanchi seer held?, Nov 12). Given the position the sankaracharya holds in the minds of Hindus, the police should have exercised restraint in executing their orders. While not a single day passes without crimes taking place under the nose of the law-keepers, unusually prompt action was taken against the sankaracharya. This is enough to raise questions about the real reasons behind the arrest.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? November 2004 is a bad month for the holy men and women of India. First, Uma Bharti was suspended from her party. Then a Tamil sanyasi was questioned by the state?s police in connection with the kidnapping of the wife and daughter of an industrialist, and also about his sexual exploits with his female devotees. The final nail in the coffin ? however blasphemous this might sound ? was the arrest of the sankaracharya of Kanchi on charges of murder. When the sankaracharya, Jayendra Saraswati, left the mutt in 1987 without informing anybody, there were speculations about him becoming a householder. He had apparently left the mutt because his senior did not encourage his social reform programmes. When he wanted to attend the renovation of a Hindu temple in Tamil Nadu, it was made clear that he was not welcome. His blessings for the anti-conversion law in Tamil Nadu were passed by. His suggestion to replace the original idol in Palani, a temple town in Tamil Nadu, with a golden idol was hated by the public and the purists. His alleged wish to change the Balaji temple at Tirupathi to a Saivite temple was greeted with disbelief and shock. 

 But all this did not deter him from initiating social service programmes. He is perhaps the only well-known religious leader to visit slums. The original Sankara?s philosophy was that the whole world is an illusion. Sitting in Vellore jail, the present-day sankaracharya, must be convinced about the truth of the statement.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? There was no justification in sending the police team from Chennai to Bangalore en route Hyderabad in a state-owned Cenna aircraft. This must have cost the state exchequer lakhs of rupees. The sankaracharya is no Dawood Ibrahim who would try to escape. Just as there was no need to arrest M. Karunanidhi in the dead of the night, the seer too did not have to be disturbed in his puja to be put behind bars. The Centre should investigate and take measures against the erring officials.

 Yours faithfully,

Lakshmi Sekar, Angul

 Sir ? The arrest of the Kanchi sankaracharya was an important milestone in the history of the Indian judicial system. It is no use trying to hide the fact that the arrest was a political one, but it takes a lot of guts to arrest one of the most important figures of the majority religious community of the country. In a country where the ruling coalition lost the elections because it did not raise the Hindutva issue, the arrest of the sankaracharya is like an explosion. Corrupt politicians may also take this as a warning that they could be exposed any time. But the question is: why the sankaracharya and not some corrupt top-notch politician? Perhaps the time has not yet arrived in India when politicians and commoners are equal before the law.

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The disciples of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam have been subjected to pain, confusion and humiliation by the arrest of their religious mentor. The arrest also augurs a bad time for the Hindutva-based organizations of the country. It is no secret that corruption exists in many of the well-known religious organizations which possess enormous wealth. Since there is not a single instance where the prosecution of a public figure has resulted in actual punishment, one can very well imagine where the Kanchi case is headed.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Kanchi sankaracharya has been allegedly involved in the murder of a sacked mutt employee, A. Sankararaman, who had threatened to expose financial bunglings within the shrine. Murder of whistle-blowers is not uncommon. Satyendra Dubey, too, had to pay with his life for knowing too much about the corruption in the Golden Quadrilateral project. But it is ironic that the Tamil Nadu chief minister, who is herself facing charges of tax evasion and disproportionate assets, should ask her police to arrest the seer late at night.

 Yours faithfully,

V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? It appears that there is at least a prima facie case against the Kanchi sankaracharya. It is unlikely that the Tamil Nadu government and police would take such a huge risk to arrest him, only to be discredited later, if they were not already in possession of some solid evidence. The circumstances of his arrest apart, the sankaracharya does not deserve special treatment, being the prime accused in a murder case. Jayendra Saraswati?s arrest signals that our democratic institutions, though far from perfect, are at least working. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Banerjee, Hereford, UK

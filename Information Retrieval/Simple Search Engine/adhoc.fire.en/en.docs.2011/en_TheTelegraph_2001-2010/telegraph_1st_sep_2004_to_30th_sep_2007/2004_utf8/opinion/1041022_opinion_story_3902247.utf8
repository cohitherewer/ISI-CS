 ALL IN THE MIND

 - Suspended somewhere between life and death

 On a comeback trail

THE COMA 

By Alex Garland, 

Faber and Faber, pound; 9.99

?The Beach is the book to have; its author?is 

the man to have? gushed the British Vogue, introducing Alex Garland to 

its readers in 1996, shortly after the publication of his best-selling debut novel. 

Dubbed ?Beach Boy? by the media, the 26-year-old found himself in the dubious 

position of playing sex icon and literary sensation to a near-cult following that 

included journalists and the general public. That his novel was, subsequently, 

made into a movie starring Leonardo di Caprio didn?t exactly help matters. Spectacular 

success, riding simultaneously on youth, talent and photogenic appeal (Garland 

is unquestionably ?dishy?), tends to raise hackles and unrealistic expectations. 

It also lends credence to rumours of a crippling writer?s block the author supposedly 

suffered before he produced his latest work. That The Coma, which follows 

a screenplay, ?28 Days Later?, has attracted a great deal of flak and is being 

dismissed as a trial run on Garland?s part to overcome his creative stasis, is 

par for the course.

 Admittedly, not all the allegations levelled against The Coma are baseless. Complaints, for instance, are rife that the book?s pages have been deliberately left unnumbered so as to conceal the paucity of textual matter and that the book is ?bulked up? with woodcut illustrations by Nicholas Garland, political cartoonist with The Daily Telegraph and, incidentally, the author?s father. While the novel?s unnumbered pages are certainly an inconvenience for reviewers, the senior Garland?s eerily-beautiful chiaroscuro of images intensifies the menace that pervades its most mundane moments. As for the ?insubstantial? text, if size were crucial to the worth of a book, one wonders why a slender, 137-page memoir ? a publishing sensation way back in 1997 ? should return to haunt us as we explore Garland?s novel. For The Coma resonates with faint but unmistakable echoes of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, a mesmerizing account by the late Jean-Dominique Bauby of his experience of the ?locked-in? syndrome, the medical phenomenon of an active mind trapped within a paralyzed body.

 Detractors have criticized The Coma?s storyline for being as slim as its volume. They?re right, of course. Nothing much happens in the novel, except in the mind of the young protagonist, after he is beaten unconscious by thugs on an underground train, lapses into coma and is hospitalized indefinitely. However, neither the victim nor the reader is ever certain as to where hallucination takes over from reality and sanity teeters into madness, lending the narrative its ever-present element of suspense. The account of the ?journeys? undertaken by Carl in his altered state of consciousness is so compelling that it pulls the reader along in spite of himself. And anyone who has been seriously ill cannot but empathize with the feelings of disorientation and helplessness that Carl endures. However, the angst that underpins largely unfulfilled lives like his is something all of us can identify with at some point or the other in our own secret voyages of soul-searching and self-discovery.

 Garland?s particular achievement, however, lies not so much in his ability to engage us in the thought-processes of a man clinging to the peculiar logic dictated by his altered state of being, as in his portrayal of the contradictory nature of human compulsions. All through the book, Carl agonizes over whether he will ever regain consciousness and the extent of ?the psychological fall-out? he may suffer, if he does. When the novel draws to a close, he is afraid of facing anew the demands of his humdrum, meaningless existence in the real world. For when ?you wake, you die?, he confesses, and ?I want to hold it off as long as possible?. The Coma derives its distinctive mood and momentum from that terrifying ambiguity.

 Ending in a stream of randomly-juxtaposed words ? one of the many disconcerting sensations that have been tormenting Carl from the time he lost consciousness ? the novel offers no conventional conclusion. To readers who have taken exception to the author?s refusal to divulge either Carl?s full name or the nature of his profession before disaster struck, this is a cop-out. Yet, there are others who will be so moved by the disturbing beauty of the writer?s prose and his sensitive exploration of a comatose man?s reflections on the ambivalent nature of his predicament, that having seen the novel through to its unsettling close, they may well be tempted to return to the earlier chapters in an attempt to decode those tantalizing jumbles of apparently unrelated words. For a work turning on an ostensibly flimsy plot, that?s quite a remarkable degree of reader curiosity and involvement. However, our lack of certainty as to what lies beneath ? treasure or a void ? is, perhaps, Garland?s trump card. The former pin-up boy won?t be so easily pinned down this time.

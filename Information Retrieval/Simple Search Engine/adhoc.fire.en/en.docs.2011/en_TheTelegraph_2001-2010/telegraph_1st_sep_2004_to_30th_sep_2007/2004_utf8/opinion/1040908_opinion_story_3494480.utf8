 FOR SMOOTHER DELIVERY OF JUSTICE

 Changes in the rules that govern the removal and appointment of judges are integral to ensuring judicial probity, argues Sankar Sen

 Make them accountable

 Some time back, the judges of the Punjab and Haryana high court proceeded on mass casual leave after a spat with the chief justice of the high court. The unseemly episode was triggered by the chief justices issuing notices to two judges for accepting free membership of a club that was embroiled in litigation. The flash strike undoubtedly lowered the image of the judiciary. 

 Of the three branches of the state, it is the judiciary which is still held in high esteem. Unfortunately, danger to the integrity of the judicial system comes from within, and not from outside. Bad appointments, poor supervision, unattractive salaries, absence of any process to check corruption have taken their toll. But what can be done to pull up errant judges and ensure judicial accountability? The Malimath committee on reforms of the criminal justice system says that the judiciarys credibility can be ensured only when it is transparent and accountable.

 The Constitution guarantees the independence of the judiciary, but the judiciary also remains subject to the rule of law, as anybody else. Article 225 gives the high courts power over subordinate courts. Unfortunately, this power is not properly exercised. Corruption in subordinate courts has now become a matter of public concern. As early as 1962, the Santhanam committee, in its path-breaking study of corruption, had said that, Corruption exists in the lower ranks of the judiciary all over, and in some places, it has spread to the higher ranks also.

 However, as far as the high courts are concerned, there is none to exercise power over them, not even the Supreme Court. In that sense, the high courts are independent, though their judgments can be reviewed by the apex court. A former chief justice of the Supreme Court once bemoaned the lack of integrity among certain judges of the high courts and mentioned the difficulties of disciplining them. 

 Article 124(4) of the Constitution says that a judge of the high court or Supreme Court can be removed from office by the president for proved misbehaviour or incapacity only if no less than two-thirds of the members of both the houses of parliament present and voting agrees to it. In post-independence India, there has been only one impeachment motion in 1993 to decide on V. Ramasamy, a Supreme Court judge. The impeachment motion failed, even though the enquiry committee held that serious charges of misconduct had been proved against the judge, warranting his removal.

 Recent reports of misconduct of some high court judges have shaken public confidence and given rise to a dangerous perception that if judges are guilty of misconduct, nothing can be done about it. It has thus become imperative for the judiciary itself to take meaningful steps and come forward with some credible solutions. It has to devise a system of judicial accountability that will protect the higher judiciary from its errant members. 

 In the high courts, the chief justice is regarded as first among equals and does not exercise any real control or authority over his colleagues. This has led to the erosion of the discipline which is absolutely necessary for the efficient functioning of the institution. The Malimath committee took note of the fact that judges do not attend courts punctually, they reserve judgments for long periods and acted vindictively against some lawyers. The chief justice has no power to look into these complaints. If he is empowered to scrutinize such cases and take prompt action, many of these problems will be nipped in the bud. The chief justice should be authorized and empowered to take some corrective measures like censuring of judges, withdrawal of judicial work from the judge for a specified period, advising judges to seek transfer or voluntary retirement, and disabling judges from hearing a particular class of cases or in which a particular lawyer appears. If the measures are inadequate or ineffective, the chief justice of the high court should also have the power to move the chief justice of India, who in turn should have the power to transfer the aberrant judge or move for his impeachment.

 In the United States of America which faced similar problems because judges could be removed only through impeachment the Judicial Councils Reform and Judicial Conduct and Disability Act, 1980 was enacted. The act provides for a judicial council for each circuit and the National Judicial Conference at the apex. They have been given powers to censure a judge, to request him to seek retirement, or to see that no cases are assigned to a judge for a limited period. Under this law, a committee of fellow judges recently investigated complaints against a federal district judge, John McBryde. He was reprimanded and suspended from hearing new cases for a year. McBryde pleaded that one years suspension was akin to temporary impeachment which amounted to a violation of judicial independence guaranteed by the US constitution. His pleas were rejected and the US supreme court accepted the argument of the solicitor-general that the judicial independence protected by the constitution was meant to insulate judges from interference from other branches of the government, and not from oversight by other judges.

 I n order to enforce judicial accountability, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct for judges Restatement of values of Judicial Life in May 1997. Another resolution required the chief justice and judges of the Supreme Court and high courts to declare their assets. The resolution could become the basis for the much-needed legislative action with necessary constitutional amendments. However, in trying to ensure judicial accountability, utmost care has to be taken to ensure its independence.

 The present system of dealing with complaints of misconduct against judges is shrouded in secrecy, and contempt laws hang like the sword of Damocles. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, prohibits exposures that would scandalize the court. The act does not say that it is for the courts to interpret the meaning of the word scandalize. The truth can never scandalize. M.N. Venkatachalaiah, former chairman, National Human Rights Commission, and former chief justice of the Supreme Court, was fond of quoting Louis D. Brandies sunlight is the best disinfectant and electric light is the most efficient policeman.

 Judicial probity is also closely linked with appointment of judges in the higher courts. For instilling respect for the judiciary in the public mind, it is necessary that persons of integrity and professional competence are appointed as high court and Supreme Court judges. The previous system of judicial appointments by the executive (1950-93) in consultation with the judiciary was substituted by a judicial collegium of five senior judges. Now the question of setting up a national judicial commission to deal with the appointment of judges is under active consideration. 

 But mere change of institutional mechanism will not help, nor will the use of technology. A transparent procedure of selection has to be devised so as to ensure that the selected judges can command public confidence. The Malimath committee recommended that a set of guidelines be evolved laying down relevant qualifications and attributes of character that are necessary to be a good judge and indicate the evidence or materials from which these can be inferred. This may ensure that irrelevant considerations or favouritism do not substantially influence the appointment of judges.

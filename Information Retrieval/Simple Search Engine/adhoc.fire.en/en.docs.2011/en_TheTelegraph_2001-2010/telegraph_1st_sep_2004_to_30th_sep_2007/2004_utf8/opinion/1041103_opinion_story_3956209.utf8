 MADE LEGAL

 Wearing several hats comes easily to Mr Pervez Musharraf. Now, both houses of Pakistan?s parliament have seen and endorsed his point of view, allowing Pakistan?s president to continue as its army chief as well. Sceptics might argue that the parliament has only done what Mr Musharraf wanted in order to legitimize his rule. And this latest endorsement caps a process for the man who seized power in a coup and had his presidency approved by a phoney referendum. There is, however, a cruel irony in the parliamentary nod to the president?s wish. For, he had the constitution amended and given himself the power to dismiss a government and dissolve a parliament at his sweet will. Despite the noises that opposition parties may make, Pakistan?s parliament today is what Mr Musharraf makes of it. This was evident in the justification that the upper house of parliament gave itself while passing the bill for his continuation as the army chief: he needs to hold both posts to facilitate the war on terrorism and to safeguard Pakistan?s territorial integrity. Mr Musharraf had said much the same thing ? in almost the same words ? when he hinted that he might not keep his promise to quit the army post by this year-end. 

 Curiously, Mr Musharraf may not have to worry much about possible reactions to this latest episode. The world that frowned on his seizure of power through an army coup in 1999 has changed dramatically since then. He has been able to project himself, and Pakistan, as an important ally in the international war on terrorism. In fact, Pakistan has been rewarded by the United States of America with economic and military benefits for its role in that war. The debate over the state of democracy in Pakistan has receded into the background as the world preoccupies itself with the new threats of terror. This was clear in the Commonwealth?s decision to lift the suspension on Pakistan, which was expelled from it after Mr Musharraf?s coup. The secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Mr Don McKinnon, has suggested that it would have no problem with Mr Musharraf continuing as the army chief if the parliament approved it. Mr McKinnon should know better the choices before Pakistan?s parliament. Despite some protests at home, Mr Musharraf may face no immediate threat to his rule. But it is a different story for democracy in Pakistan.

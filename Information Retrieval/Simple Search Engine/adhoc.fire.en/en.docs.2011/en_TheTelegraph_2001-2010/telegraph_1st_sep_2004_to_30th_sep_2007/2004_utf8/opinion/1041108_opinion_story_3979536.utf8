 Letters to Editor

 Friend today, gone tomorrow

 Sir ? Kanti Biswas, the school education minister of West Bengal, has suddenly threatened schoolteachers with a nine-page code of ?professional ethics?. The code, among other restrictions, bars them from smoking in public and from offering tuition (?Public smoking ban for teachers?, Nov 6). What can the matter be? Have that section of teachers, which has never had it so good since they became the Left Front?s trusted vote bank, not been paying their hafta regularly to the Alimuddin Street coffers? Or have the communist rulers woken up to the fact that teachers who give private tuitions sometimes earn Rs 50,000 a month or more? That surely is too much for our communist leaders to handle. But didn?t these teachers switch their loyalty from the previous Congress regime almost overnight so that they could keep alive their unholy racket with help from the ruling party? 

 Yours faithfully,

Jyoti Sanyal, Calcutta

 Catch 22

 Sir ? The arrest of Dilip Banerjee, better known as Hatkata Dilip, reminds me of the Lok Sabha polls, when a member of my family went to cast his vote, only to find that the job had already been done by somebody else (?Hatkata Dilip in confess cry?, Oct 31). When he inquired further, he was ?requested? by the people at the booth not to kick up a fuss about the irregularity. Several incidents like this occur in and around Calcutta every time there is an election. The hiring of criminals by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to intimidate voters, rig votes, incite violence and evoke fear among people is a common practice in Bengal. Now that the party has a bigger role and responsibility at the Centre, it should make earnest efforts to decriminalize its entire organization, not only for the improvement of its own image, but in the larger interests of democracy.

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur

 Sir ? The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, stated publicly that he was determined to put Hatkata Dilip behind bars. But when Humayun Kabir, an upright police officer, successfully nabbed the criminal, he was immediately transferred from his post of the sub-divisional police officer of Salt Lake. Whether Kabir?s new job as deputy superintendent of police, intelligence branch, marks a promotion or demotion is not clear yet. But it will certainly deprive Kabir of the opportunities to round off criminals and make Calcutta and its suburbs a less dangerous place to live in. The move has cleared doubts, if ever there were any, about the politicization of the police and bureaucracy.

 Yours faithfully,

A.C. Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The arrest of Dilip Banerjee, followed by the quick transfer of Humayun Kabir, is a brazen display of the clout Subhas Chakraborty wields in his party and the decision-making process of the state government. One can only pity the helplessness of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in monitoring the activities of his associates and party-members.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Although I would still like to think that in comparison with some of the other states, criminal activities in West Bengal is still within controllable limits, I was dismayed to read that the police officer who had successfully nabbed a much-wanted criminal has been shunted to a low-profile position. This will demoralize the entire police force. 

 Only a few days ago, I attended a meeting chaired by a senior officer of the Thakurpukur police station. He had to face the ire of the residents of a satellite township because of the deteriorating law and order situation there. He had promised help despite a shortage of personnel at his disposal. Now, after the Avtar Singh and Hatkata Dilip episodes, I wonder how anybody can expect honest services from the police department, whose hands are tied by the politicians. Who would want to do good work when it is likely to be greeted with ignominious transfers? 

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? When asked about the transfer of Humayun Kabir, the chief minister conveniently passed the buck to the inspector-general, Chayan Mukherjee. But what could Mukherjee tell us? Kabir?s reputation as a tough and straightforward officer is well-known. Cops like him face a no-win situation: if they fail to catch a criminal, they are called incompetent, and if they do, they are demoted.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? If the activities of political goons did not affect the lives of ordinary citizens, then the recent robbery in the Capital Electronics showroom in Ultadanga and the attack on the Bajoria family in Salt Lake are enough to drive fear into their minds. I think it is time for the governor to request president?s rule in the state.

 Yours faithfully, 

A.S. Ahmed, Calcutta

 Sir ? No matter what the establishment says about Humayun Kabir breaking ?rules?, it is quite clear that Kabir?s superiors and the political masters are behind his transfer. When has protocol been important in the matter of catching a feared criminal?

 Yours faithfully,

Shuvamoy Saha, Pittsburgh, US

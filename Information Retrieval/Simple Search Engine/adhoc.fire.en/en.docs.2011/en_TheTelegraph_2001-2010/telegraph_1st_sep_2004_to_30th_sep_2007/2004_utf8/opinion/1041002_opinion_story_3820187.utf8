 Letters to Editor

 Laughter is the best medicine

 Sir ? How do we interpret Aishwarya Rai?s non-stop giggles at Tussaud?s (?Wax eloquent? Hee-hee?, Oct 1)? The embarrassment of having to watch her reflection in public or a forced attempt to hide the dissatisfaction of having to look at a figure that hardly resembles her? Most probably the latter. Like the Amitabh Bachchan replica at Tussaud?s, the figure, features, hair and skin match those of the star perfectly. Yet the wax model, for some strange reason, looks different. Indian artisans who make clay models to decorate roadsides do a better job.

 Yours faithfully,

 Falling behind

 Sir ? At a time India is supposedly undergoing the infotech revolution, Anjan Mukherji?s experience at a branch of the State Bank of India shows that several government bodies are still incapable of providing even the basic facilities (?A completely burnt-out case?, Sept 16). Public sector organizations, and the SBI is one, lack in their awareness and use of e-commerce. If there were problems with the income tax form circulated through the internet, Mukherji?s SBI branch should have suggested ways out instead of harassing him. If the manager is in no position to serve his client, what is his use? E-commerce is now the buzzword, and public banks have to know how to provide it to their customers. We are not paying our taxes simply to keep the home fires of government employees burning. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? I empathize with Anjan Mukherji for the harassment he has had to undergo at a SBI branch. But the story is not the same everywhere. At my SBI branch in Behala, I could deposit my income tax in a single ticket window and in no time. The stamped challan counterfoil or ITNS 280, however, had to be collected a couple of days later. A single rectangular seal, carrying the same dimensions as the vacant space on the challan, had all the requirements ? bank branch with its 7-digit BSR code, the dates of the tender and realization of the cheque, the 5-digit serial number.

 I appreciate Mukherji?s efforts to create awareness, but I get the impression that he has not studied the requirements carefully. At one place in his article he clearly distinguishes between the 7-digit BSR code and the 7-digit challan identification number. At another, he says that the challan identification number has 5 digits. But the latter, that is the CIN, is not a particular number. It comprises three things ? the 7-digit BSR code of the bank branch, the 5-digit serial number and the date of deposit. Mukherji?s SBI branch is to blame for the confusion. Also, Mukherji?s apprehension that records at the tax office will not reflect his deposit is unfounded. Besides the CIN, there is also the safeguard of PAN inter alia standard information. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ranesh Chandra Dey, Calcutta

 Sir ? Anjan Mukherji?s grouse should be directed at his own SBI branch. I have had no problems depositing my income tax through public sector banks like the SBI and the United Bank of India. The new form that is concise and simple. Only one page has to be filled in while the earlier challan had to be filled in in quadruplet. The cash or cheque has to be deposited at the bank together with the challan and the pay-in-slip given by the bank. One can come back later to collect the counterfoil of the challan with the bank?s stamp on it. This takes little time while earlier, one had to wait for two or three days till the cheque was cleared. There is also an on-line facility for depositing records with the National Securities Depository Limited. The form 280 can also be used to pay corporate tax and wealth tax.

Yours faithfully, 

S.K. Choudhuri, Calcutta

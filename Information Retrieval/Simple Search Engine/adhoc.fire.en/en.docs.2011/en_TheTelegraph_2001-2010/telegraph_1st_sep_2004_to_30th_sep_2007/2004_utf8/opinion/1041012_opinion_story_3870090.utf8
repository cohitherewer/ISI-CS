 NOT A FIT

 There are certain kinds of violence that civilized society accepts in order to be civilized. Making public the deeply private is one such. Bringing out the travails of a breaking marriage under the glare of the courtroom is a painful experience, but it is something that people have to go through so as to spare themselves further personal pain. There is violence done to the sense of the private in the very act of applying legalese ? however humane the terminology ? to a complex psychological situation which has evolved out of a shared sexual and emotional history. The clash is manifested in the inadequacy of the expressions used to describe particular complaints, the reductionism that often makes agonizing problems appear to be either absurd or pathetic. But it is manifested most clearly when complaints such as ?irretrievable breakdown? are considered too ?light? a ground for ending a marriage, because this is one ground that cannot be objectively proven.

 It can be accepted as valid ground when the divorce is by mutual consent. But when this is the ground offered in a contested divorce, as in the recent case of Mr Shyam Sunder Kohli and Ms Sushma Kohli, it becomes a problem. If the husband claims that the marriage is irretrievable, and the wife expresses willingness to live with him, the situation is hardly simple. Divorce laws need to be applied with some care in a country where women?s social and economic insecurity makes them such easy victims. In this case too, the husband had earlier charged the wife in court with ?cruelty and desertion?, but it had then appeared that the woman had been forced to leave the husband?s house. And no cruelty could be proved against her. The court?s remarks have been made in this context, since the husband?s credibility is rather low. But how far can a legal institution go to force a person to continue with a marriage when he clearly has no wish to do so? Would it then have to decide which relationship is healthy and which is not? The law can ensure the weaker party?s economic security, but beyond that is a grey area. Yet, it cannot encourage suits such as Mr Kohli?s, who seems to be making excuses to get rid of his wife. But by saying so, it runs the risk of appearing to take a moral stand. However broad-based the divorce laws and however wise their application, they can never seem to fit exactly the contours of a disintegrating personal relationship.

 HOME-GROWN WISDOM

Signifying the Self: Women and Literature 

Edited by Malashri Lal, Shormishtha Panja and Sumanyu Satpathy, 

Macmillan, Rs 375

Feminism has finally come of age in India. Academics 

in India have started evolving their own notions, instead of simply borrowing 

concepts from Western feminists and trying to make them fit the Indian context. 

This book tries to cover the wide range of feminist thinking in India that has 

found expression in literature, autobiography and films. Even art, if one considers 

the exquisitely designed cover, based on a painting by Arpana Caur, which hints 

at the suppression of women?s creativity by men.

 The opening essay in the first section, ?Writing Lives?, looks at the complex relationship between nationalism and gender through two autobiographies. These are Amar Jiban by Rassundari Debi, the story of a self-effacing woman in a joint family who teaches herself to read and write in the face of stiff opposition, and Amar Katha by Binodini Dasi, whose reactions to stereotyping are far sharper. Sachidanand Mohanty writes a wonderful essay on the early women writers of Orissa who constitute a significant, though largely forgotten, literary tradition. 

 A Dalit woman is doubly exploited, as Mahasweta Devi?s works vividly show. Radha Chakravarty looks at some of her stories and is convinced that her different roles as journalist, political activist and writer are all ?part of the same emancipatory effort?. In his essay on Telugu Dalit women?s poetry, M. Sridhar extends the term Dalit to include Muslim and Christian women, arguing that they too have been oppressed by upper-caste Hindus. This point is debatable since the oppression of Dalit women is far more acute, especially because of their poverty.

 Insurgency too hits women hard. Indira Goswami, one of the writers taken up in Pradipta Borgohain?s essay, is an instance of committed social activism by an eminent author. Borgohain?s essay brings to mind the writings of the Sri Lankan writer, Jean Arasanayagam.

 Malashri Lal expresses concern about Indian women writers in English refusing to be categorized as ?women writers?, a label they see as limiting. She feels, ?The gap between women?s writing and an avowed ?feminist position? is to be bridged through a theoretical discourse grounded in India but incorporating the gains in vocabulary and concepts deriving from western academia.? 

 Shormishtha Panja addresses the important and controversial issues raised in Tagore?s Choker Bali ? the new woman, the position of widows, and marriage and the space it demands. It makes one wish for another one on Ghare Baire, which too deals with the new woman against the backdrop of the freedom movement.

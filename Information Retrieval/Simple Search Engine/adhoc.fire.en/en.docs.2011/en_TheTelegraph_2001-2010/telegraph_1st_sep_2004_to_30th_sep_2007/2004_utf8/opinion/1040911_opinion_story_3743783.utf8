 TO

 A

 TEE

 Vijai Singh has been thrown out of more golf clubs and tours than he cares to remember. But now the Fijian world champ is at home anywhere on the globe 

SINGHS 

MOTTOES

 ' I seldom drink 

alcohol. I am careful about what I eat. And no lsate meals. 

 My brother Krishna was a better player than I was. Maybe, 

I had more fire in my belly.

 I am working harder. There is no telling what I am going 

to do when I am 42.'

 The gentlemen who had driven down from New Delhi to Gurgaon in their Volkswagens and Renaults that winter afternoon were far from amused. Vijai Singh had overhit his approach shot and it had landed beyond the fairway, somewhere behind the trees. ?You said this guy is as good as Tiger Woods,? said a greying, gin- and-tonic type, turning towards one of his friends, ?Were you serious?? The friend?s answer was drowned in the cheers as the tall and swarthy golfer played an impeccable recovery shot that had even his rivals, Kapil Dev and Jyoti Randhawa, in that 2002 friendly game nod in appreciation.

 But earlier this Monday, the riposte was well and truly delivered in faraway Boston. There, in an atmosphere crackling with electricity, Singh ended an emperor?s reign and brought democracy back to the world of golf. By sinking a birdie putt in the final hole to win the PGA Deutsche Bank Classic, the 41-year-old Fijian of Indian origin halted Tiger Woods? uninterrupted 264-week run at the top and became the world?s no. 1 golfer.

 For the cocky CEOs and the industrialists who came to the DLF golf course that sunny November afternoon, it was a perfect management lesson from the PGA tour: Anything?s Possible. For Singh is not blessed with the genius of a Woods, the flair of a Seve Ballesteros or the gifts of Jack Nicklaus. 

 His is a triumph of work ethics that human resources managers can only dream of. It is about a raging fire in the belly that made him, as a child, practise on the beach hitting balls at low tide, that forced him to run across airfields to reach a golf course, and later, made him work as a nightclub bouncer. Much of Singh?s battle to become the best were essentially the trials of a Third World player trying to find his way into a First World sport.

 Coming from a modest background ?his father was an aeroplane mechanic ? and being born in a country with few serious golfers and fewer courses was a huge disadvantage for someone who wanted to play professionally abroad. Financially hard-up but supremely confident of his skills, Singh would occasionally sell off his prizes ? cameras or stereo sets ? even before he had won them in local tournaments. 

 When 19, Singh flew out to Australia to try his luck as a professional. The dark-skinned golfer wasn?t allowed entry into some clubs and practised in soccer fields. And he was often mired in controversies. Singh was banned from playing in Australia on the charge that he had not settled a financial debt. And it got even worse when he was banished from the Asian tour for two years for filling up a scorecard inaccurately in Indonesia, something he still denies.

 So the golfer, with dreams of playing with the best in the world, was forced to work as a club professional in the rain forests of Borneo, helping out fat American oil executives with their swing. Somewhere in those jungles, golf became more than a passion for Singh. It became a mission.

 He played even in Africa. When the six-feet-two-inches-tall golfer won his first tournament in Nigeria in 1988, everyone cheered. Nobody had seen a dark-skinned man win a golf tournament before.

 The slow and steady journey to the top from then on has resulted in three Golf Majors ? the 1998 and 2004 PGA championships and the 2000 Masters ? and over 33 million dollars in career earnings. 

 Singh, who lived in a bare single-room set in Borneo, now has a beach house in Florida where he lives with wife Ardena, son Qass, his six German shepherds ?Loppy, Snowy, Rover, Tyson, Silver and Teddy Bear ? and 2,000 DVDs.

 But it is his gruelling work ethics, and not easy life-style, that is talked about these days. His idea of a holiday, the joke goes, is to practise for just six hours a day. Singh is not known to waste any sunlight.

 The controversies have continued to nag him, though. The Fijian landed in the roughs when he said that woman golfer Annika Sorenstam didn?t belong to the men?s tour when she received an exemption to play on the PGA circuit.

 But in the past few months, his march to the summit ? 10 titles in the last 20 months ? has hogged the headlines. And now that he has reached the top, India too can bask in reflected glory and argue that there is nothing wrong with its sporting DNA. The India link, after all, is something that even Singh acknowledges. ?My roots are Indian. My nationality is Fijian. But I am of Indian origin,? he had said in Delhi in 2002. ?Coming here, in a sense, is coming home.?

 At the top of world golf, Vijai Singh is already home.

 SHOULD WE CLEAR THE WAY?

 Shobita Punja

 The new director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India, C. Babu Rajeev, has a few targets to meet in his new assignment as the head of India?s largest government-run institution for heritage properties. Under the ASI, there are 3,500 monuments that are deemed to be of national importance and are protected by the blue placard of the ASI that declares the monuments of historical and national significance. Of these, 26 have been declared by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites, and of this group, Rajeev says, the ?Taj Mahal is topmost priority?. When asked how he plans to protect these gems of India?s history, one of the things he said was that ?construction within 100 m of the protected monuments would be tackled in the next six months?.

 UNESCO has prescribed that there be at least a 100-metre area around a protected monument where all new construction is strictly prohibited. Within the next 200 metres construction is restricted, and within the 300-metre limit around the building, new construction is to be regulated. None of these regulations has been applied in India in any actual sense. ?It is not about increasing or decreasing the 100 m distance,? says the new DG, ?but taking a stand on the court ruling and fixing an appropriate cut-off distance. Then comes the eviction of hawkers, squatters and illegal occupants from monuments.?

 This is a commendable statement and should be welcomed by all who see the finest examples of Indian architecture being swallowed up by urban squalor. The entrance to most ASI-protected heritage sites is usually a dangerous mess of illegal constructions, persistent hawkers and tacky tourist shops. 

 Window to the past

 However, there is a counter-argument that is equally strong and must be heard. What was the run-up to the Brihadesvara temple in Thanjavur in the 10th century when it was built? Was the entrance to the temples of India not lined with shops selling items for worship, necessary for prayer, food and refreshments for weary travellers and pilgrims? Was the area around mosques and temples sanitized with green English lawns and flowerbeds one thousand years ago? Surely not!

 So there is an argument to ?interpret the site? correctly and to give the visitor a ?living experiential idea? of what the area may have looked like a thousand years ago. In the same vein it would be sad and historically incorrect to see a historic building isolated and set apart from its context. The building would look as sad as animals in a zoo, rather than being comfortably protected in their natural habitat 

 The notion that people should see a monument that looks like a deserted museum, a dead structure, is losing ground because it gives the wrong message and an inaccurate historical picture. Therefore, it is critical to see the building as a window to the past ? a brief glimpse of a world gone by, that in its time the building played a vibrant role in the lives of people and the city and was invested with meaning, with social, economic and cultural relevance.

 What we need then are creative historians who can aid ASI in finding this relevance and these lost cultural contexts. Did temples and mosques always have shops around them, were they the places in the past where craftsmen sold their wares? 

 If the answer is that in India the road leading upto the royal fort or temple or shrine was once busy and lined with streets selling exquisite wares, then we have to find a creative way of interpreting history and of restoring that context. We have to find the most imaginative manner possible to restore this setting if it has disappeared, and ensure that the surroundings do not disturb the protected site, are free from garbage, and yet retain the ?idea? of what it may have been like in the past.

 INDIA RISING

 Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited has signed an agreement for acquiring Tyco Global Network, based in the United States of America, for $ 130 million. Earlier, the Reliance group acquired another US-based company, Flag Telecom. All too often, discussions regarding foreign direct investment are about India as a host country and about what India can do to improve the domestic environment. Historically, Indian joint ventures abroad have had doubtful success, especially in Africa and south-east Asia. The present spree of shopping abroad through acquisitions seems to be based on sounder commercial considerations. Tata Motors has eyes on Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company in South Korea, and the Tatas also have the largest-ever FDI project in Bangladesh. VSNL and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited are in Nepal and Mauritius, Indian Oil Corporation is in Sri Lanka and Nepal and Essar Telecom is in Lebanon. Hindalco has bought copper mines in Australia, Sterlite in Zambia. Pharmaceutical companies have been on acquisition sprees in Britain, France, China, Netherlands, the US, United Arab Emirates and Bangladesh. Information technology and education service companies are everywhere. 

 There are several reasons for the Tetley phenomenon. First, interest rates are low, spliced with excess liquidity with companies. Second, external commercial borrowing and overseas investment policies have been liberalized. Third, higher domestic transaction costs drive companies abroad to tap comparative advantages. Fourth, there is explicit intention to jump over-protectionism through tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Fifth, selected Indian companies are more competitive now. Witness how the paranoia over the Chinese manufacturing threat has disappeared.

 Unfortunately, recognition that Indian companies can metamorphose into multinational companies or transnational companies has still not materialized. The government?s own Economic Survey has detailed information on FDI inflows, but precious little on FDI outflows. The proposed Investment Commission is about FDI into India, not about FDI out of India. When the left is up in arms about the diabolical behaviour of MNCs and TNCs, it presumes these are of Western, if not American, origin. Several years ago, the then ITC chairman used to talk about ITC becoming the first Indian MNC. That may not have happened. But years down the line, one can see the makings of other Indian MNCs. When anti-globalization protestors begin to throw stones at Indian MNCs in Davos or Kathmandu, India will truly come of age, and one can perhaps detect signs of that in the anti-outsourcing backlash. However, some Indian companies are being pushed out because of lacklustre reforms at home. That is undesirable, because multiplier effects are greater if investments occur at home. Payment of taxes and employing labour abroad are fine as long as these flows do not result from other distortions.

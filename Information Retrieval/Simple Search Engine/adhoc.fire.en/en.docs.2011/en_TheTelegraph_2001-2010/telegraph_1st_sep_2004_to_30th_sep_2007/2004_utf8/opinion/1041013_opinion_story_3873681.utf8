 WINNING WAYS

 In politics, as in social life, party-hopping can pay rich dividends. The important thing is to choose the right party at the right time. Mr Gegong Apang did precisely that by choosing to return to the Congress before the elections in Arunachal Pradesh. Not only has the Congress come back to power in the state, but Mr Apang is all set to become its chief minister again. The outcome of the polls was predictable once he deserted the Bharatiya Janata Party and merged his Arunachal Congress with the Congress. His action may have smacked of political opportunism, but that is hardly an issue in Indian elections. Winning the polls is all that matters. Questions of party or other loyalties matter insofar as they help candidates or parties win the elections. But the BJP has little moral right to complain about Mr Apang?s party-hopping. Although the BJP had no member in the state assembly, it formed a government in Arunachal Pradesh when Mr Apang, in his earlier somersault, got the majority of the Congress legislators to desert the Congress and join the BJP. Having been chief minister of the state for 20 uninterrupted years in his earlier regime, he is now set to outdo Mr Jyoti Basu?s record of 23 years in power in West Bengal. The party-hopping will only be a footnote to his success story.

 However, Mr Apang cannot afford to be too carried away by the mandate to get its message wrong. Notwithstanding his own stature in the state?s politics, it remains primarily the victory of the Congress. Mr Apang?s return to it clearly put the Congress miles ahead of its rivals in the electoral race. But that does not make it his personal victory. It is doubtful if he could lead any other party or a combination of local parties to such a victory. This is proved by the fact that the BJP won nine seats even after his desertion. It would be na?ve to undermine the performance of the BJP, which did not have a single seat in the last assembly. It is up to Mr Apang now to use the mandate for the good of not only the Congress but also the state. Despite the victory, the interests of the Congress would be harmed if Mr Apang uses it to settle scores with his old party rivals, particularly the state party chief and former chief minister, Mr Mukut Mithi. Given the state?s economic backwardness and problems related to ethnic militancy, he should have better things to do.

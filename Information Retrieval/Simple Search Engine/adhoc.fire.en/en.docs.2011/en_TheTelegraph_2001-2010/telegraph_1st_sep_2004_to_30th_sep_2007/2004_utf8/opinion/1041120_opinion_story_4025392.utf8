 Out and About

He always knew the recipe for a good total. Now, hard 

though it is to imagine Matthew Hayden wielding a spoon and wearing an apron, 

the batsman will share some of his other recipes in a cookbook to be out next 

year. It?s a first for an Aussie cricketer, but somehow, Indian dishes find a 

special place. The book, a mixture of mouthwatering delicacies and homespun philosophy 

shared around the barbecue, will feature the chilli Mumbai lagoon crab, dal and 

mango chutney, even a decent pav. And then, there are the typical Queenslandian 

bangers and mash. Now, if only Matty had shared his other recipe with our cricketers...

Diana Hayden

Bollywood has just turned Princess Diana into a supermodel. Diana Hayden?s role in Ada, set for a February 2005 release, is believed to be based on the Peoples Princess, except she?s a glamour doll. The ex-Miss World is tightlipped, saying, ?We start shooting from November 1.? Gulshan Grover plays Charles; newcomer Rajeev Singh, Dodi Al-Fayed; and Vasundhara Das the Camilla Parker-Bowles of the piece. From the looks of it, the name Diana might be the only thing common between real and reel life.

 WHOSE GAME IS IT ANYWAY

 The state has an inherent propensity to increase its jurisdiction and area of operation. That is the only charitable explanation there is for the claim, on the part of the government of India, to make the Board of Control for Cricket in India one of its innumerable organs. The Centre held that the BCCI is a ?state?. The claim has no factual basis since the BCCI does not depend on the government of India for funds or for anything else. The government does not control the affairs of the BCCI. But the bigger absurdity of this attempt to usurp the BCCI into the state is located at a more intellectual plane. The state of India and its various institutions have been willed into existence by the people of India. The state and its institutions enjoy their power and their position because they embody the will of the people. This is the essence of a democratic state where the will of the people is akin to the voice of god. Hence the statement, vox populi, vox dei. The BCCI is a voluntary association established by like-minded people. The will of the people of India has nothing to do with such an association.

 The point is much more important than a mere academic one since it has a critical bearing on practical matters. It is not possible for a group of Indian citizens to come together to form a Lok Sabha of their own. But it is possible, in the world of sports, for another body to be set up to rival the BCCI. Indeed, such a thing did happen in the world of cricket after the Kerry Packer raid. Packer demonstrated that it was possible to lure away the best players from the International Cricket Council. A similar thing was done many years ago by Jack Krammer to the world of tennis. No single body, by definition, can have a monopoly over any sport. It is possible that certain bodies, because of circumstances, come to regulate, even dominate, the administration of a game. But this is not to say that the status of such a body is unassailable. The state can be assailed, but only by people who either deny or want to rewrite the will of the people. This crucial difference between the state and voluntary associations should not be ignored because the blurring of the distinction undermines the importance of the will of the people.

 The idea of a maximalist state has an innate drive to incorporate everything, even those that do not embody the will of the people, into the body of the state. The government of India?s move to make the BCCI a ?state? is an example of this drive. There is something fundamentally anti-democratic in the move since it seeks to extend the state into the voluntary associations formed by individuals. Such associations form the bulwark of civil society which is distinct from and at a distance from the state. The merging of the state and civil society has ominous connotations. But to make the BCCI a ?state? is bizarre enough to get a mention in the world book of gaffes.

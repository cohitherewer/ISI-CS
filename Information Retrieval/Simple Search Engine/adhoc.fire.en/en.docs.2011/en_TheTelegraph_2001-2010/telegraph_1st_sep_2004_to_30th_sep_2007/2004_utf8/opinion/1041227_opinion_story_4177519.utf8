 OUT OF THE BOX

 Mr Manmohan Singh has realized that the project of liberalization that he initiated in his finance minister avatar cannot remain confined to the economy. The idea of freeing individual enterprise and energy which is at the very core of liberalization has to pervade the realms of the government and education. In India, the latter is critical since many of the intellectual assumptions of liberalization are not even properly known and understood. Education policy in India has always been state-driven and top-heavy. Even under the present dispensation, there is a propensity for the ministry of human resource development to strengthen and perpetuate the state?s control over education. This is, ironically, a carry-over from the previous government in which Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, the HRD minister, treated education as his own bailiwick. The present minister, Mr Arjun Singh, despite all his ideological differences with Mr Joshi, is no different except that he chooses men who share his views. Under both men, ideology prevails over merit. The prime minister has made it clear that education reforms cannot proceed along this path. He has appointed Mr Sam Pitroda as the head of an experts? committee that will look into a range of issues related to education reforms.

 Two of the areas that the prime minister wants to look into relate to public-private partnership and the entry of foreign universities. The choice of these areas suggest that Mr Manmohan Singh is keen to lower the level of the state?s involvement in higher education. This will free funds for the primary sector which should be the state?s primary concern. The choice of Mr Pitroda is also significant since he not only masterminded the telecommunication revolution in India, but he is also a well-known champion of private enterprise. His appointment will serve to take pockets of higher education outside the control of vested interests. The minimalist state, the end product of liberalization, is still a distant dream but it is reassuring to see it as a part of the prime minister?s policy concerns.

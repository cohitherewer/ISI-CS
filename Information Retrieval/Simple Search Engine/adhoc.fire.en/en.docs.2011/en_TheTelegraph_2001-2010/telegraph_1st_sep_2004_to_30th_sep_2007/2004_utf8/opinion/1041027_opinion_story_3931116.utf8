 Letters to Editor

 Little problems

 Sir ? In a country where women give birth on the road, infants are left to die in garbage vats or are killed by power cuts, it is nice to know that concern for an injured four-year-old could summon an army of nine doctors in a jiffy (?Hospital in tizzy over Priyanka son mishap?, Oct 26). Would doctors have similarly been performing their ?duty? on a Sunday had it not been a Nehru-Gandhi child? Unlikely. And there lies the tragedy of our billion-strong nation. Here, it is lineage and money that give human life its value. That is why it is so ?normal? to have 20 children die every week in the only referral hospital for children in West Bengal while an entire hospital is thrown into a tizzy over a single child in another part of the country. A child is a child is a child. Let us not send another, with the saline still on, to die on the street because its parents are not part of the ruling family.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Winner takes most

 Sir ? Sharad Pawar, and not Sonia Gandhi, has emerged the clear winner in the Maharashtra assembly elections (?Winning trend?, Oct 18). The enhanced status of the Nationalist Congress Party in the coalition will go a long way in giving it a strong political leverage in any government, be it in Maharashtra or at the Centre. 

 The real loser has been the Shiv Sena, more so than the Bharatiya Janata Party. The ageing Balasaheb Thackeray has lost much of his teeth, and the glaringly public succession struggle between his son and nephew has not helped the party. Even as a senior partner in the alliance, the Sena could not project a strong chief ministerial candidate before the polls. Its vitriolic personal attack on Sonia Gandhi backfired by alienating a substantial section of linguistic and religious minorities as well as liberal-minded Maharashtrian voters. Besides, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party, although failing to win even a single seat, played spoilsport by taking away a sizeable chunk of the lower caste votes that might have gone to the Sena-BJP combine.

 Yours faithfully,

Saumitra Banerjee, Hereford, UK

 Sir ? Arunachal Pradesh also had its elections recently. Our economist prime minister did not have the time to visit the state. Nor did he have the inclination to turn Itanagar into Denver. Arunachal does not give his party money nor MPs. So it is not India. Then came the elections in Maharashtra. Manmohan Singh rushed there and declared that Mumbai would be Shanghai if his party won the elections. Maharashtra gives many things to political parties and politicians. If a person from the North-east has to go to Europe or the United States of America, he must travel to Delhi or Mumbai and spend thousands of rupees more than his co-citizens from the north or south or west. Why the disparity, Mr Singh?

 Yours faithfully,

Rajat Gupta, Guwahati

 Sir ? Overconfidence killed the cat for the National Democratic Alliance. Despite having paid the price for it less than six months back, it has made the same blunder in the Maharashtra assembly elections. But the greatest upset in the polls was the victory of Arun Gawli despite reports that his henchmen prevented opposition parties to even monitor the booths. The police officers who used to chase Gawli will now find themselves in a peculiar dilemma of having to salute him as a member of the legislative assembly. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The squabbling between the Congress and the NCP over the chief minister?s post does not augur well for democracy. One hopes that Sonia Gandhi will restore order. The policy of giving the chief minister?s chair to the largest party should be strictly followed, as has been done earlier in Maharashtra and recently in Karnataka, although Jammu and Kashmir was a special case. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? There is no denying that the BJP is in a catch-22 situation. There will surely be chintan baithaks by the BJP to find out what went wrong. As for Mayavati, who dreamt of becoming the king- maker in Maharashtra, she should now realize that it is best she confine herself to Uttar Pradesh.

 Yours faithfully,

Shadab Ahsan, Gaya

 Sir ? At an election rally in Maharashtra, Manmohan Singh declared that he was carrying a ?message? from Sonia Gandhi for the people to vote against the Hindu right. Why should our prime minister act as anyone?s messenger? Such an act lowers the dignity of the high office that Singh holds. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir ? To prevent post-poll bargains, chief ministers should be elected by a secret vote with an absolute majority among the elected legislators. The chief minister should also be made liable to be removed by a no-confidence motion signed by at least one-third of the MLAs, who should also mention an alternative choice for the post. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

 Letters to Editor

 Careless with words

 Sir ? A political greenhorn, Rahul Gandhi, recently admitted to ?excesses? during Emergency, just as casually as he had dismissed Jaya Bachchan?s sentimental statements as a ?bundle of lies? (?Rahul steps into Emergency row?, Oct 15). If the last has got Big B to hint that an understanding of the ?relationship? between the families was beyond Rahul?s grasp, the first admission has sent the Congress scurrying for cover. For one, this , together with the heat generated by Anupam Kher?s allegation, might ultimately force the Prasar Bharati into passing Prakash Jha?s documentary on Jayaprakash Narayan without cuts. If it doesn?t, there is the double whammy of bad publicity coupled with Mulayam Singh Yadav?s threat of screening the documentary in Uttar Pradesh. Could madam please recall her son and give him a few more lessons in restraint?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Off limits

 Sir ? The Left Front government, which is not used to being held accountable, has once again entered into a confrontation with the judiciary which questioned the government?s failure to better road conditions in the city (?Foul cry opens road-fix coffer?, Oct 13). This reaction conforms to a familiar pattern. It is reminiscent of what happened with the Amitava Lala ruling which opened a hornet?s nest by banning political rallies. Just as it did then, the administration is now on the offensive. Personal accusations are being hurled at the judges and the judiciary is being accused of being ?politically motivated?. One would probably concur with the assertion that ideally, the judiciary should not meddle in the affairs of the executive. But what happens when the executive fails to deliver? 

 Let us not forget that but for the court?s active intervention, one would have been forced to breathe more polluted air, many more patients would have suffered from the onslaught of crackers during the Kali puja and loudspeakers would have continued to deafen. 

 Yours faithfully,

Saumitra Banerjee, Hereford, UK

 Sir ? Instead of spitting venom on the judiciary, our politicians should learn to behave themselves. We are tired of hearing complaints against ?judicial activism?, interspersed with comments on the ?arbitrary? nature of the selection and dismissal of judges. The reasons behind judicial intrusion are not far to seek. Much of today?s judicial prowess stems from the failure of the legislative and the executive, the two other pillars of democracy, to assert themselves, or to discharge their duties. 

 No one likes to go to court for fun. It involves a lot of money, time and energy. Yet people still go to court as there is nowhere else to go to seek justice, be it against left hooliganism or the rallies that block the road, or against the carnival on the Maidan. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? It is ridiculous that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should be complaining about the judiciary overstepping its jurisdiction when there are numerous instances of his government and officers flouting court orders. When the executive cannot show the judiciary the respect that is its due, Bhattacharjee has no business complaining against judicial activism.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? As Altamas Kabir indicated, the advocate-general is supposed to protect public interest and not that of political leaders (?Court glare on VIP comments?, Oct 15). But the way Balai Ray, the advocate-general, defended the chief minister only establishes that the contrary is true. Public trust in the judiciary will grow manifold if some action is taken against the chief minister or the secretary of his political party for their contempt of court. One should not forget that the Indian court has shown the strength to send a leader of the stature of Indira Gandhi to jail for undermining the respect of the judiciary.

 Yours faithfully, 

Kunal Saha, Columbus

 Sir ? It is quite astonishing that even government bodies have acquired the audacity to take the high court for a ride. It is unusual that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation should have only one lawyer in its panel, and that he too could plead that he was busy enough to forgo a court summon. One can easily understand the plight of ordinary citizens at the hands of such civic bodies. Year after year, the municipal bodies spend money on road repair. Once repaired, another government body, be it the telecom department or CESC or the public works department, digs them up again. The road then lies unrepaired till after the rainy season and the cycle is then repeated. Why cannot we take loans from foreign organizations like the World Bank to repair roads in such a way that they do not require to be repaired every year? All organizations providing public utility services should also device ways to do underground work without digging up an entire stretch. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The ruling party of West Bengal is accountable to none. They are the messiahs of the people and the Central government exists only till the left wants it to. The Left Front?s endeavour to pass the controversial block-level pre-litigation board bill 2004 is an attempt to bypass the judiciary. The cadre have their own panchayat to intervene in social and even family matters. The top leaders of the party, instead of disciplining its wayward workers, go their own way abusing judges and the judiciary. The transport minister has even warned us that a time may come when the court will interfere in our food habits and life style. We are not worried about that. It is preferable to be governed by the court than by hooligans.

 Yours faithfully, 

Sujit Kumar De, Calcutta

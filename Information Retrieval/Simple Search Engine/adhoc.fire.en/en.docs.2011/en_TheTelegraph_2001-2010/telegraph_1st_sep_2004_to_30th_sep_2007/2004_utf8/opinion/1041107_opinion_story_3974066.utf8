 RED ALERT FOR SMOKE

 There are some exercises that communists love. One is the exercise of preaching virtue. To instruct others from a position of superior morality gives them an incomparable thrill ? which is why they lap up such tasks as making model codes of conduct. This time, the West Bengal government has gone quite overboard with the list of don?ts for teachers of government and state-aided schools. The penalties for violation of the new model code awaiting publication should be indicative of the gravity of the crimes listed. The penalties include censure, withholding of one or more (not exceeding three) annual increments, fine up to a month?s basic pay and dismissal. From this list, it would be natural to await the recitation of teachers? offences with bated breath, full of fearful wonder at the darkness of soul they evidently mask. 

 But the very first don?t in the model code is an anticlimax worthy of the highest comedy: ?Teachers should never smoke, consume alcohol or narcotic substances in public while they are in service?.? It seems West Bengal is being rapidly turned into a never-never-land where a teacher can be dismissed, or maybe just fined his entire month?s salary, for smoking in public. Or perhaps Mr Kanti Biswas, the minister for school education, inhabits a world of stark black and white, where crimes, professional offences or failures, and habits that the minister disapproves of, are all of equal weight. And in it, smoking and consuming ?narcotic substances? are at par. So are smoking and drinking on the one hand and giving private tuition on the other, because the second ban is on private tuition. And Mr Biswas should really clarify what he means by consuming alcohol and narcotic substances ?in public?. It seems too horrifying for speculation. From his pure, high moral ground, the world is full of sin and perversity. His model code has been forged to fight it.

 Teachers are not the most powerful social segment. It is easy to dictate terms of public conduct to them, and to threaten them with fines and dismissal. If there is any logic at all in ordering them not to smoke publicly as a part of professional conduct, why should the same logic not apply to, say, doctors? And how can one section of schoolteachers, or of teachers in general, be subjected to this ban, and not others? If all teachers, everywhere, at every level, were requested not to smoke in classrooms, or even within school, college or university buildings, it might have made some sense. There is another, more serious, question here. The government had earlier professed itself anxious about the ill effects of private tuition. Now, by merging that with the smoking-drinking ban, it has proved itself not just confused, but actually quite frivolous. The pure-as driven-snow attitude does not quite come off after all.

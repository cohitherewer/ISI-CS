 NEVER

 AT

 HOME

 It takes more than a fondness for painting, farming and horse-riding to manage this ministry. And Shivraj Patil may find that out to his cost

and procedures.

 If Union ministers were given report cards, Shivraj Patil would be dreading his grades. For in every possible subject ? from Manipur and Nagaland to Kashmir ? he has demonstrated that problem-solving is not quite his forte. In his four-and-a-half months in office, the Union home minister has never been at home with success.

 No minister in the Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance government is as much under the hammer as the suave Maharashtra politician, who turns 69 next Tuesday. The Northeast is still in turmoil, while violence shows little signs of easing in Kashmir. And Shivraj Patil looks helplessly on as parts of India burn.

 Patil?s position is clearly shaky. Though some in the Congress believe his job is still safe, Left political circles insist that Patil is on his way out. Some speculate that if the Congress comes to power in Maharashtra, Patil may be eased out of the Centre and made the chief minister of his home state.

 Few would have considered that as probable last May, when Patil?s name was surprisingly announced for a post that many thought was the Number 2 position in the government. Congress insiders maintain that Patil was party supremo Sonia Gandhi?s choice. Having served ably as her deputy in the 13th Lok Sabha?s Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP), the Maharashtra politician enjoyed Sonia?s trust.

 ?He is honest with his assessments and gives you the true picture. And that is highly valued by any leader,? says a former Union minister. ?That apart, he has wide experience in governance,? he says. Which is why, a Congress leader argues, Sonia was keen to give him a high-profile portfolio even though he lost his seat in the last Lok Sabha elections. ?For her, giving him a portfolio lower than that would have meant underemploying him,? says the Congressman.

 In hindsight, it seems that Sonia should have stuck to her original plans of giving home to Pranab Mukherjee. Undeniably, Patil is a seasoned politician well-versed in parliamentary affairs, someone who has also performed well as Lok Sabha Speaker, and as a minister of state for defence as well as defence production.

 But home ministry is new territory for the Congress politician, who is also fond of painting and farming. The job demands a different set of skills. The man in the hot seat is expected to engage amiably in dialogue with groups with serious political grievances. It is the job of a minister who has to appear empathetic and flexible, even without actually being so.

 Patil?s first stern test came when Manipur erupted in July after Thangjam Manorama, a 32-year-old woman, was allegedly raped and shot dead by the army. Even as the northeastern state took to the streets, Patil reacted in slow motion. When he finally visited Manipur almost two months later and met Apunba Lup, the apex body of 32 agitating groups in the state, he hardly had anything to offer. To most agitationists, Patil came across more as a by-the-book bureaucrat than a sympathetic politician willing to engage.

 More than a month since then, little has changed. His refusal to even discuss the issue of lifting the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act has been interpreted as a sign of arrogance. ?The agitationists feel,? says an Imphal-based journalist, ?that the Union home minister cannot solve their problem. They want to talk to the Prime Minister?s Office.? And, to this end, they even met the state governor last week. That?s a big red mark in his report card.

 The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) is not happy with him either. The group was perturbed when he said he was willing to talk to all militant organisations, overlooking the fact that a long negotiation process was already on with the NSCN (I-M).

 Even in strife-torn Kashmir, Patil?s performance has been sub-par. His pronouncement that any dialogue would take place ?within the four walls of the Constitution? angered the Hurriyat moderates in favour of holding ?unconditional talks? in the Valley. Later, the minister softened his stand, but by then the damage had been done.

 In fact, soon after taking up the new job, Patil had promised to visit Kashmir. Over four months later, the Valley still awaits his first visit, now likely to take place later in October.

 Of late, though, the minister has been faster on the draw. Patil made a quick visit to Nagaland on October 3, a day after its capital Dimapur was rocked by bomb explosions. And as terrorists went into overdrive in Assam in the following days, he has been quick to announce additional army and paramilitary support for the state.

 Not everyone is convinced, though, that Patil is the right man for the occasion. The general view is that the home ministry needs somebody who has the political imagination as well as the ability for strategic thinking. And the Congressman who lost his first Lok Sabha election this year in Latur, his pocket borough since 1980, could be better off elsewhere. ?Patil is a capable man,? says a senior Congress leader, ?but he is not a very political home minister.?

 But former Union minister and political analyst Arun Nehru feels that Patil is being made the fall guy. He says what is happening in the Northeast is not the home minister?s individual responsibility but the Cabinet?s collective responsibility. But even Nehru admits that the home minister has not been pro-active enough in his efforts.

 Time, one could say, is running out for the Maharashtra politician. As someone who is fond of horse-riding, Patil should know that it is dangerous to let the reins slip out of control. This could have been a home run in his long political career. Right now, Shivraj Patil is more home alone.

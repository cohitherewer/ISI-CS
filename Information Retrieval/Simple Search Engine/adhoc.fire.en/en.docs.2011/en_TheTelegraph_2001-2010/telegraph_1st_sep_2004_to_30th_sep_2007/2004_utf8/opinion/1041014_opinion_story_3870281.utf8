 Letters to Editor

 Our white saviours

 Sir ? On my way to Calcutta from London recently, I met a bunch of British youngsters at Heathrow airport, probably coming to offer Calcuttans charity. They were hardly out of their teens, but were brimming with smugness about being the saviours of a city. Calcutta?s appeal to the world is largely as a place of squalor and suffering where one goes to offer solace to the poor. As a person born and brought up in Calcutta, I felt humiliated by the attitude of these ?white saviours?. I think some restrictions should be imposed on charity-workers, proudly bringing succour to the city. Their intentions are almost always noble, but they do incalculable damage in the long run. They take back a unidimensional view of the city which helps perpetuate certain myths. The mayor?s pet project, erecting a statue of Mother Teresa on Park Street, will do nothing to explode these myths.

 Yours faithfully,

Aroup Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Age of unreason

 Sir ? Kenneth Bigley was alive when Sunanda K. Datta-Ray wrote ?Caught between? (Oct 9). By the time we read it, Bigley was dead, his prime minister ?could not? manage to save him. Every death in Iraq is unfortunate, more so now that we know the invaders had merely wanted the oil. But more striking is the revelation that the Iraq invasion had not been in response to 9/11 nor was it a sequel to Afghanistan. 

 But will Bigley?s death now force the American and British governments to acknowledge that the ?age of Western imperial control of Asian nations is past?? Unlikely. Datta-Ray refers to ?Islamophobia? and the Muslims? ?huge problem of isolation?. There lies the answer to why the West continues to retain its control over Asian nations. 

 The Western powers have divided the countries between Muslim and non-Muslim ones. The former are known more by their religious identity than a national one. All Muslims are looked down upon for any wrong done by any Muslim group anywhere in the world. It is not surprising that in such an environment, some Muslims will maintain a low profile while others will seek the protection of a religious platform. The dominant West gains, either way. So long as the divisive trick remains unexposed, the age of imperial control will continue. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Sunanda K. Datta-Ray manages to capture the Anglo-American psychology that fed the Iraq war. There now remain no doubts about the illegality of the war. 

 It is remarkable how the so-called ?civilized? West can indulge in barbaric activities. What is remarkable is the invaders? attitude to their own citizens. If the former do not feel apologetic about starting the war, they should also be prepared to pay its price, even if it amounts to letting go of some of the prize-catches in return for the lives of its innocent citizens. How George W. Bush intends to protect the US while allowing Americans to be slaughtered is a mystery. Bigley?s case should warn the Americans and the British about their selfish and unsympathetic leaders. It should also remind them that they alone can prevent the catastrophe their leaders are hell-bent on accomplishing.

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur

 Sir ? Although Sunanda K. Datta-Ray compels us to ponder the ethical implications of the war on terror, one cannot wish away some troubling questions. What has become a boon for the terrorists is the indifference of bigger nations to eliminate them totally. Take the Beslan tragedy, which failed to stir the conscience of Vladimir Putin. In the muddle, the possibility of any external intervention in Russian politics was completely ruled out. Maoists atrocities have made the lives of the Nepalese people hellish but all that China and India have done is remain spectators to the rampage. Before questioning the honesty of American moves, shouldn?t ?conscientious forces? look at their own cowardice? One cannot understate the importance of the fact that unlike other countries, the US did not turn a blind eye to dangerous developments. It is another thing that this responsibility does not fit in very well with its larger designs. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? Kofi Annan merely reiterated Michael Berg (the father of slain Nick Berg), who said that the Iraq war had been ?fought for greed? (?Annan says war illegal, doubts polls?, Sept 16). But more than Annan, it is a mediocre film, Michael Moore?s Fahrenheit 9/11 , which stirred the American conscience. The film blames Americans for being ?dumb? enough to believe their government. 

 One man could have saved Iraq and the world from this calamity. That is Annan himself. He should have shocked the world by resigning when the US kept the UN out of the decision-making process. He has made a mockery of the UN by clinging to his post. The world is not fooled by his statement, coming at the fag end of his second term.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Narasimhan, Bangalore 

 Sir ? The slap on the wrist from Kofi Annan is also a part of the US policy to allow its known collaborators to restore their credibility so that it can use them again to further its aims. Both Israel and Iraq need fresh initiatives, and Annan?s statement may be seen to mark the beginning of the change. The pressures on George W. Bush seem to be so daunting that he needs outside support to attempt a drastic change of policy. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ghulam Muhammed, Mumbai

 ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT THE FORCE 

A responsible way to promote higher standards of policing 

is to professionalize the force and upgrade training, writes N.R. Madhava Menon

 In the way of rights 

The Indian police is not as bad in protecting human 

rights as they are made out to be by the media and civil liberties organizations. 

Before condemning the entire force for the lawlessness of a few, it is necessary 

to clarify the criteria for judgment and to respond to the explanations for failures 

advanced by the police themselves. For irrational and motivated criticism will 

do more harm than good to society.

True, there has been deterioration in the standards 

of policing. This is partly a reflection of the all-round decline in public life 

and governance. Despised by the civil society, criticized by the judiciary, humiliated 

by criminal gangs and exploited by unscrupulous politicians, the policeman today 

is more sinned against than sinning. An increasing number of them are killed or 

maimed every year while protecting society from criminals and terrorists. They 

neither receive any worthwhile training in protection of human rights nor are 

they rewarded for human rights-friendly conduct. On top of it, they are paid poor 

salaries and are expected to be available on duty all the time. The stress and 

the fatigue are enormous, yet they are expected to perform miracles in disciplining 

an increasingly indisciplined society. 

All this is being said not to justify police brutality 

but to seek a sense of proportion and an understanding of the situational reality. 

A responsible way to promote higher standards in policing is to professionalize 

the police and upgrade the quality of police training. Unfortunately, this is 

not done, particularly among the lower ranks of the force. There is no idea of 

constitutional values and the standards of behaviour expected of them. Neither 

the existing curriculum in police academies nor the teaching material and methods 

employed show concern for human rights. The recommendations of the National Police 

Commission and the Gore committee on training have not received adequate attention. 

Poor public cooperation, inherited colonial structures and a corrupt work culture 

have put the police in a hostile relationship with constitutional norms and human 

rights.

One of the main sources of popular dissatisfaction 

with the police is the employment of ?third degree methods? during investigation 

of crimes. Despite statutory controls on police powers and increased supervision 

by the courts, the use of such extra-legal methods has not stopped. But there 

are today a variety of investigative tools which are less invasive, more reliable, 

highly cost-effective and totally human rights-friendly. Of course, this calls 

for heavy investment in terms of infrastructure and training of personnel. But 

in the long run, it is cost effective and supportive of the goals of criminal 

justice. It is more so in areas like cyber crime, organized crime and economic 

offences where the stakes are high and any price for good investigation is never 

considered unwarranted.

There is, of course, one difficulty. Scientific evidence 

is still not admissible in all cases, and wherever admissible, its probative value 

is not what it ought to be. The rules of evidence drafted 150 years ago need to 

be suitably modified. There are already some initiatives in legislating the use 

of DNA printing and cyber forensics. If legal education takes cognizance of the 

technology and prepares the legal fraternity to correctly appreciate scientific 

evidence, it is possible to disband practices inimical to human rights.

There are two ways to influence police conduct. The 

modern method of behaviour control, which is democratic and more positive in result, 

is based on education and training. In this scheme, reward and punishment operate 

as a secondary support system; change is sought through motivation, professionalization 

and provision for alternative strategies for achieving work satisfaction. Socialization 

is a process which achieves such positive conduct. Professionalization begins 

with initial training and matures with proper organizational environment and peer-group 

influences. What is required is political will, organizational commitment and 

community support for the changes to be brought about in a phased manner.

Given that the bulk of police personnel belong to 

the constabulary, the programme has to begin with them. A manageable programme 

has to be evolved in consultation with select groups of constables themselves. 

The consequences of non-conformity with the new norms should be made known to 

every member of the force and violations should be dealt with expeditiously and 

ruthlessly. Service registers should have columns to record the degree of policemen?s 

adherence to human rights standards. No police medal or other honours should be 

conferred on anyone who does not have a human rights record worthy of emulation. 

There must be a cell in every police station for fair, expeditious handling of 

public grievances. 

A few years ago, the Karnataka police academy organized 

a course on human rights for 150 newly recruited sub-inspectors. It was part of 

their year-long induction training course. A set of reading materials was given 

to the men to enable them to appreciate the importance of human rights. 

A manual on human rights training in the police force 

was also published by the National Law School, Bangalore, which co-sponsored the 

event. It stressed on: one, substantive information on human rights standards 

? drawn from the Constitution, the laws, judicial decisions, reports of commissions 

and committees as well as from international human rights instruments ? for the 

police; two, identification of police skills appropriate to human rights-friendly 

behaviour in different work situations; three, development of motivational factors 

to sustain the search for human rights information and skills even after the training; 

and four, identification of norms of ethical and moral conduct as part of the 

personality development plans of individual policeman by self-sustaining strategies. 

An important aspect is the involvement of police officers who have a reputation 

for protecting human rights, as also NGOs which work with women, children, lower 

castes and so on to share their experience.

It is said that criminal justice is the true mirror 

of the degree of civilization of a society. If one were to assess the status of 

the criminal justice system in terms of the constitutional provisions and their 

impact on criminal law, criminal procedure, evidence law and so on, the Indian 

system will easily be graded in the human rights-friendly category. Its foundations 

are democratic and its working is governed by the rule of law. The threat to human 

rights from the criminal justice administration arises mainly in the exercise 

of discretionary authority conferred on enforcement agencies under the laws of 

criminal procedure. The way these agencies have been structured and administered 

during the colonial period to a large extent determined the standard and quality 

of their services. The adoption of a Constitution in 1950 did not mean concomitant 

changes in the attitudes and practices of criminal justice agencies. This suited 

the political class which found tremendous power coming into its hands by letting 

the system continue. 

The result has been large-scale abuses of police powers, 

often with the knowledge and connivance of politicians. Even to this day, the 

ruling parties are not prepared to give the police a chance to professionalize 

and be accountable. The Police Act of 1861 is still the organizational legislation 

even though several commissions have uniformly recommended the repeal of the act 

in order to create an independent agency to oversee police operations.

There are people who explain the situation in terms 

of the prevailing social standards and even justify the lawlessness giving comparisons 

to more lawless societies elsewhere. If such people are in charge of politics 

or law enforcement organizations, it will be difficult to reverse the degradation 

which has taken already set in. But the law-abiding people of this country deserve 

a better deal from the police, the prosecution, the lawyers, the court and the 

prison system.

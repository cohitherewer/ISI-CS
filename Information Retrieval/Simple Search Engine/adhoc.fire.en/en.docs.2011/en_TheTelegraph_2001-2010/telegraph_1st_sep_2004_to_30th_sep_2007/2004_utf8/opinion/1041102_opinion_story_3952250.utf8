 AGE OF WISDOM

 The will to retire is not very strong among most Indians. The resistance is rooted in reasons both economic and psychological ? in that order. In a country where jobs are difficult to get and retirement benefits far from adequate for dreams of well-heeled leisure, voluntary retirement schemes are always regarded with suspicion. It is no wonder, therefore, that the secretarial staff in the Congress secretariat at the party?s 24, Akbar Road headquarters are nervy and suspicious at being offered the VRS. They sense the iron hand in the velvet glove ? perhaps refusing the scheme will not help, there may be retrenchments in the offing. The party is keen to downsize its staff, and get a smaller and younger workforce as part of its drive to cut down expenses. Streamlining the establishment and reducing expenditure are the immediate goals of reform, but there is a broader issue involved. Should political parties think of a retirement age for everyone, and not just secretariat employees? 

 There have been debates, sometimes without resolution, in many countries over a retirement age for party officials and all politicians. Presidents, for example, in the presidential system of government, are allowed a fixed number of terms should they seek re-election. In the parliamentary system, the prime minister and his ministers face no age bar either. But India?s array of elder statesmen invites such a debate. So far, the premium an ancient civilization places on wisdom has stressed the value of experience. Given the complexity and variety of the country?s socio-economic formations and the many-sidedness of its regional, religious and caste equations, experience is an essential acquisition for an effective politician. The argument in favour of elder statesmen is a strong one. At the same time, there is also a plea for young blood. The infusion of fresh viewpoints, especially from those more in touch with a rapidly changing new generation, can be quite rejuvenating for any political party. In the age of increasing professionalism, a career in politics could come to mean specialization in particular spheres, which could bring about efficiency of a different kind. An image-conscious era might even welcome new faces. The jury is still out on this though. But forward-looking reform might make serious thinking about the issue inevitable. A consensual resolution, for that alone will be acceptable, will be hard to reach.

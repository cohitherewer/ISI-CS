 MORE STAYING POWER

 Debabrata Mohanty

 Bikram Keshari Deo is the Bharatiya Janata Party?s Lok Sabha member from Kalahandi, where this member of the royalty has a sprawling house. When he was a member of the Orissa legislative assembly six years ago, he was allotted a house which he should have vacated within 15 days of his election as a member of the Lok Sabha in 1998. Parliament members are not eligible for government accommodation in the states as they get it in New Delhi. But it is December 2004, and Deo, like several others, stays on.

 The problem has become so alarming that the Supreme Court has asked the Orissa state government to submit a list of illegal occupants. The estate department revealed in its affidavit that there are 279 illegal occupants, including 21 MLAs, MPs, former chief ministers and an IAS officer. 

 Like Deo, the Biju Janata Dal MP, Prasanna Acharya, too should have vacated his quarter in July this year after he was re-elected to the Lok Sabha. Acharya continues to stay, citing the marriage of his daughter as reason. Similarly, the former BJP MLA and now MP, Dharmendra Pradhan, continues to occupy a house in the heart of Bhubaneswar. Since April this year, the department of general administration had begun to charge him rent at penalty rates while serving him an eviction notice. Pradhan has not bothered to pay.

 Clingers all

 VIPs have to pay 10-times the usual rent if they occupy government property illegally. This, however, has not been a deterrent. Three former chief ministers, including Hemananda Biswal and Giridhar Gamang, are still occupying their quarters despite the GAD having cancelled their allotment. Biswal argues that as a former chief minister he is entitled to a government quarter. But GAD officials say that there is no such rule for former CMs. The rule applies only to former prime ministers who are under special protection.

 The problem is not merely with politicians. Bureaucrats like C.T.M. Suguna, now collector of Mayurbhanj, continue to occupy their bungalows. Suguna had got her duplex bungalow when she was the director of the Orissa health system development project. 

 Staying put in government accommodation is a trait that goes beyond political affiliations. Congressmen Prasad Harichandan and Srikant Jena have retained their quarters through sheer ingenuity. Harichandan has got his quarters allotted in the name of the sitting Congress MLA, Niranjan Patnaik. Jena has done the same. This has become common practice among former MPs and ministers.

 Look no further

 In Bhubaneswar, the state government has over 11,000 quarters which are invariably under the unauthorized occupation of either peons, school-teachers, lecturers, politicians or bureaucrats. The estate department is hard-pressed to find accommodation for newly-elected legislators. The department has fixed norms for allotting houses, and it serves routine eviction notices. But it presses no further. Politicians have also evolved ways to get around the GAD. For example, the Orissa Gana Parishad president and former minister, Bijoy Mohapatra, who has got a stay order from the high court against his eviction. 

 For its part, the GAD is desperately trying to augment its supplies. Tuhin Kanti Pandey, the department?s special secretary, says that 744 more quarters are being built on the outskirts of the city. But the VIP squatters should learn from the former chief justice of India, M.N. Venkatachaliah, who moved out of his government bungalow in Delhi the day after he quit office. Politicians, of course, are different. They prefer to wait, in anticipation of a comeback even if their voters think they don?t deserve one.

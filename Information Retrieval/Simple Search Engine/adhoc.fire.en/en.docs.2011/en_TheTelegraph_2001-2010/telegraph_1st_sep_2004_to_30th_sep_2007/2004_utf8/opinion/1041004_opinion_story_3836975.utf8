 STING SEASON

 It?s malaria-time again, and Calcutta is coping badly, as usual. In fact, the situation could be worse this year. There seem to have been two more deaths in Tiljala, although the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is yet to confirm that malaria has been the cause of death. This would make this season?s death-toll in the city as high as six already. Last year, there were 13 deaths. In ward 65 of the Corporation alone, the number of people already down with malaria is alarmingly high. Over 49,000 people had malaria last year, out of which 3,600 had the malignant variety. The civic authorities predict that this year?s numbers could go up to 54,000, although they say ? in the same breath, and quite inexplicably ? that fewer people will get malignant malaria. Seventy per cent of the blood being tested at the School of Tropical Medicine is infected with the virus. It is remarkable how full the statistics become as situations get worse in West Bengal?s health sector. 

 It is also remarkable that the mayor knows the name and objectives of the WHO?s malaria programme. Yet, in spite of ?Rollback Malaria?, he also believes that the eradication of the disease is ?impossible?. The mayoral council has, however, decided to launch five mobile malaria clinics for door-to-door services. But the hapless residents of ward 65, most of whom are slum-dwellers, give a much more grim picture of the CMC?s activities among them. The health unit is almost dysfunctional, with no stock of medicines, regular spraying of repellents and awareness programmes to speak of. Three years ago, the mayor had promised to build a malaria hospital in Kalighat ? no signs of that yet. It is no wonder, then, that the Calcutta high court has asked the civic authorities to put in the relevant figures, together with an outline of their prevention and awareness programmes. Yet again, it has fallen upon the court to do the job of the civic bodies.

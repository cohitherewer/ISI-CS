 Letters to Editor

 The good son

 Sir ? Nirupa Roy?s death did not cause much of a ripple in Bollywood (?Bollywood?s model mother no more?, Oct 15). Of course, deaths were never more than a strategic event in the world of Hindi films, and unannounced deaths like Roy?s are difficult to accommodate in its tightly-written script. No wonder none of the screen gods, who played son to Roy and vanquished scores of armed men singlehandedly with her blessings, turned up to bid her the final goodbye. But think not for a moment that the great Indian filial tradition is dead. Sanjay Dutt was proving it the day Roy died ? floating his own company, S.O.N (?Son shine?, Oct 15). The queerness of the name fades into inconsequence when it emerges that the acronym stands for ?Son of Nargis?. (Nargis, incidentally, was Mother India.) So what if the Amitabh Bachchans forgot to be ?the good sons??

 Yours faithfully,

D. Pal Chowdhury, Calcutta

 God of small industries

 Sir ? The report, ?Small-unit clusters in the offing? (Oct 11), is a little too optimistic. The government?s economic policy on this sector has been misdirected over the past half-a-century. Small-scale units are not embodiments of efficiency because of their size constraint. They often over-employ, are poor in technology and overtly labour-intensive and thus cannot compete in the international market. As a result, the government has to either subsidize them, or act as their chief buyer, or put up tariff walls around the market to prevent entry of foreign firms. 

 The consequences of these measures are a poor fiscal situation, unavailability of cheap products to customers and no incentive to grow and increase efficiency. Our textile sector has been killed with such kindness. Indian firms are unable to compete with Chinese, Pakistani and even Bangladeshi ones, constantly losing markets in the United States of America and the European Union, and are tipped to lose more after quotas are dumped in 2005. The story is the same in the retail sector, where protective tariffs have prevented the rise of an Indian Tesco or Walmart. Dumping the pro-small-scale industries attitude may cause short-term pain to the laid-off workforce, but in the longer term it would result in Indian multinationals emerging, employing a larger number of people, and competing successfully with foreign firms. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The third all-India census of small-scale industries, based on the field study done in 2001-02, ought to open the eyes of the government. It reflects the consequences of policy failure, of exposing small units ? whose vulnerabilities are well-known ? to the winds of liberalization, without first ensuring that the safety net is in place. The survey trims the routinely spouted figure of 3.21 million registered small units to 2.26 million, and reveals that as many as 0.89 million (or 39.38 per cent) of these units were not merely sick, but were actually closed! 

 The current situation would be worse, considering that, till recently, the high interest rate regime swallowed up huge chunks of the value of output, in many cases even exceeding it. Another welcome trend reflected is the shift away from being manufacturing units (from 90 per cent in 1987-88 to 66 per cent now) to service sector units. Although the argument that for an identical investment of capital, small units generate several times more jobs than larger units is still valid, the employment per small unit has shrunk from 6.3 workers to 4.5, meaning that the number of jobs generated in these 2.26 million registered small units has shrunk from 14.24 million to 10.17 million. If this is an indication of enhanced productivity or value addition per worker, it should be welcomed. Even more interesting is the survey?s estimates that 9.15 million units (that is, over four times the registered units) are not registered. Sixty per cent of them operate in rural areas, doing business with no support from the government. 

 I became an entrepreneur 30 years ago. While irresponsibility on infrastructure continues to plague industry at large, and small industry in particular, the costs of infrastructure, and taxes, have multiplied several times. From my experience, I have come to believe that in India, small units survive not because of, but in spite of the government.

 Yours faithfully,

 A new smile this puja

 Sir ? Millions of rupees are spent every year by the Durga Puja organizers to create pandals and idols which last for only five days. However, over the last few years, the organizers seem to have lost all sense of scale. Last year, a pandal made out of boondi won huge acclaim. This year too, we are going to witness a few made out of foodstuff such as candies, cashew nuts and so on. And this in a country where thousands of people go without a square meal a day, and 63 per cent of children go to bed hungry. Wouldn?t it be wonderful if the organizers of the pujas bought with all their money a smile for the poor and the hungry? 

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

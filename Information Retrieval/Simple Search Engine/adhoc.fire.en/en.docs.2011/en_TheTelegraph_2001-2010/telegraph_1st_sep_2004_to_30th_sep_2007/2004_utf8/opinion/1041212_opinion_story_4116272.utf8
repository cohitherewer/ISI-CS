 A NAMELESS JOY

 Great writers are not always great public speakers. Mr Salman Rushdie is that rare personality who has the gift to enthral readers and listeners. On Thursday evening, at a function organized by The Telegraph, he spoke on his craft and on factors that influence it. It was a memorable evening for those who heard him because Mr Rushdie has the gift of saying profound things with an extraordinary lightness of touch and humour. It was more than a performance, since Mr Rushdie created for himself the role of a public intellectual who communicates to his audience his views on issues that belong to the domain of the republic of letters. This is a sphere of activity that is shunned by most Indian men of letters. Or when they do engage in it, they expose their own narrowness of vision and their prejudices. 

 This was not always the case. One has only to think of Rabindranath Tagore and his innumerable interventions in public life. But modern knowledge and its pursuit have become victims of increasing specialization. The range one associates with humanist learning has all but disappeared. The intellectual who can bring together a high level of knowledge, understanding and passion on a variety of subjects and can communicate their interconnectivity in an accessible way is now an endangered species. Even in the Western world, where the public intellectual has been a part of public life since the time of the Renaissance, such interventions are becoming rare. There was a time it was always possible to read or hear the views of men like Isaiah Berlin, E.P. Thompson, Jean Paul Sartre or Edward Said. It was never necessary to agree with their views but they always helped people to think and engage. They, in the words of Saul Bellow which Mr Rushdie so movingly quoted, opened up the universe a little bit.

 Mr Rushdie moved with effortless ease, on Thursday evening, from films to storytelling to narrative techniques to truth in art. His digressions and anecdotes were as important to his communication skills as the depth of his argument and vision. He made it clear that his mind was not subservient to any authority or cause but was loyal only to his own intellect and craft.

 He could with great humour recall his own predicament as a writer and a teller of tales. He could admit how his mind has changed and convey to his listeners his unending sense of discovery. He reminded his listeners that he continues to seek that elusive quality called truth in art and life because he refuses to become some kind of institution, because he refuses to apply any kind of closure to knowledge and the communication of knowledge. The way Mr Rushdie conveyed all this made it sound all so easy, but as anybody who has followed his career knows, the journey has been nothing if not hazardous and even life-threatening.

 The republic of letters, as Mr Rushdie pointed out, does not have any boundaries. The artist knows of no nation save that of his own imagination. The much-quoted term ?imagined community? has the greatest resonance in the republic of letters. It was to this republic that Mr Rushdie, as a public intellectual, invited his audience. The entry into the republic is as difficult as the exit is easy. Calcutta and The Telegraph are grateful to Mr Rushdie for the invitation.

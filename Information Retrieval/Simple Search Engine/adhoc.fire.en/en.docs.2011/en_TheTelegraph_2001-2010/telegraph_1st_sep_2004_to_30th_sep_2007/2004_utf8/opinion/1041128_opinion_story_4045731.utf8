 Letters to Editor

 To cut a long story short

 Sir ? It happened only once, and it was some nine years ago on September 8, 1995. A 15-minute bandh was called by the Left Front?s district committee in North 24-Paraganas, to protest against an issue. Since a bandh is only a means of showing anger, can?t all political leaders arrange them to be of a shorter duration ? say, for an hour or so instead of the usual day-long ones? Three bandhs in a span of half-a-month, and on the same issue, trivializes the whole concept of a bandh. 

Yours faithfully, 

Sujit Kumar Sen Gupta, Manirampore 

Behind the smoke

 Sir ? The West Bengal government should clarify what it means by ?public? with regard to its proposed ban on smoking for schoolteachers (?Public smoking ban for teachers?, Nov 6). If ?public? is restricted to the area ?within the environment of an educational institution?, the government is perfectly entitled to impose a ban. 

 However, the rationale for such a ban must not be the enforcement of a ?moral? code of conduct for teachers ? rather the reduction of health hazards for schoolchildren exposed to passive smoking. Unfortunately in India, public awareness of such risks, even among the urban educated, is generally low. 

 The ban should ideally be extended to all educational institutions other than state-aided schools, hospitals and public buildings as has been proposed. And it is best that the government ensures that all teachers perform their duties properly and brings the errant teachers to book. That is precisely where the government?s jurisdiction should end. Experience elsewhere has shown that excessive moral whipping by a ?nanny? state only encourages clandestine behaviour and corruption. A more realistic and pragmatic approach instead may save the situation.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Banerjee, Hereford, UK

 Sir ? The code of conduct proposed by the state education minister, Kanti Biswas, will instil a modicum of discipline in school administrative bodies and confidence in the student community, if it is followed to the letter. 

 Care should be taken to see to the code?s proper implementation. A monitoring agency should be formed to see to the educational institutions? compliance with the rules. The private tuition ban for schoolteachers, which has been included in the code, had been introduced quite some time back, but the dismal results are for all to see. 

 Besides, enforcing professional ethics alone will not act magically to improve the status of education in the state. The government should also take into consideration other important issues. There are many schools that do not have a principal or headmaster. Besides, many secondary and senior secondary schools are hopelessly crammed, with high student-teacher ratios. This precludes meaningful education. What steps are being taken to address these problems? 

Yours faithfully, 

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan 

 Sir ? Teachers are students? guardians in school, and children vest a lot of faith and trust in them. Naturally, a teacher?s sense of morality plays a big role in their education. A code of conduct is in place but what the administration missed out on was the influence of politics in the educational arena. There are shameful instances of teachers being appointed on the basis of their party affiliations. 

 The code has conveniently made allowances for teachers to go on strike, contest elections and form unions. Unless politics is divorced from education altogether, such codes of conduct , apparently taking the high moral ground, make little sense. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abdus Samad, Incheon, South Korea

 AS WOMEN COME INTO THEIR OWN 

 Women in Haryana are displaying a new assertive- ness as they reject the veil, refuse to marry illiterate men or to abort a girl child, writes Gajinder Singh

 Stepping out

 They may still be burdened with work and have to contend with inebriated spouses at home, but the winds of change are catching up with women in Haryana. The age-old tradition that subjugated women in the state is slowly and steadily being eroded. The Haryanvi woman is trying to seek a better life for herself and to rid herself of the veil that has been foisted on her against her wishes. She has not only started making efforts to seek education but is also striving hard to try and understand the world beyond the village. While the days of hiding behind the veil are not over yet, the Haryanvi chhori has begun to assert herself and demand her rights. 

 Meet 19-year-old Gulabo from Buhrain, a village in Jind about 30 kilometres from the district headquarters. Gulabo has studied till class X. ?Manne to para-likhe chhora se shaadi karni se (I want to marry an educated boy)? she says, much to the bewilderment of the village elders. She hides her face, from strangers and occasionally even family members, behind a long veil, but Gulabo says she can discard it at any moment. 

 With the plummeting sex-ratio ? the worst since independence ? there are no dearth of marriage proposals for her from land-rich but uneducated boys. But she is adamant. No illiterate husband for her. ?I have tried numerous times to get her married. But I am yet to get a proposal from a family whose boy is literate and doing well in life. My daughter wants to marry someone who will respect her for what she is. She says she does not mind being the workhorse of a family, but her husband has to be literate. A commodity difficult to find,? Gulabo?s father, Suraj Singh, laments.

 Gulabo is not the only woman thinking such thoughts in Haryana. There are Basanti and Jalebi in Kalawati, Gita and Banno in Gangoli, Sarita and Sadhana in Nidana. The list is endless.

 In most villages in Kaithal, Sirsa and Jind, the list of eligible bachelors is growing. Some consider the phenomenon an off-shoot of female foeticide while others feel the reason could be the new assertiveness of women. 

 ?Haryana?s economy will crash without women as practically every household chore is done by them. From tending the fields and looking after livestock to rearing children, they work like robots from early morning till late in the night. The only time men can be found working is during the sowing and harvesting season. Travel anywhere and you will find men lazing around, playing cards, discussing politics, cracking jokes and enjoying long puffs from the hukka. Call the women and you will be told that they are away on the farm or fetching water,? a deputy commissioner of police, Rajeev Sharma, explains.

 ?There are many hurdles in the path to greater freedom. For far too long we have been seen as second-class citizens. The birth of a girl is still seen as a sin despite the fact that she works like a machine. Female foeticide continues to be practised in the state, though secretly now. If ultra-sound tests have been banned, girls are taken next door to Uttar Pradesh for abortions,? says Basanti.

 Intriguingly, the problem of female foeticide is more acute in urban areas than in the villages. ?It is easy to make the illiterate villagers understand the harm female foeticide is causing the state. Getting the literate classes to understand is much more difficult. The threat of the danda does not work in towns and cities. The realization must come from within and women can play an active role here,? Jind?s chief surgeon, Narveer Singh, advocates.

 The age-old system of wearing a veil too is being questioned. ?The veil has made me anonymous, unapproachable, isolated and resentful. It has imprisoned me regionally and individually,? says Banno, who too has asked her parents to look for an educated boy for her. ?I will not tie the knot till I am convinced my future husband realizes that I am human too and only education can make him feel that way.? 

 Most of the women, both young and old, that this writer met, had never heard of any reform movement. ?Raja Ram Mohun Roy! Oh kaun se (Who is he)?? asked Jalebi. The Arya Samaj movement, though strong in Haryana, did not touch her. The great Haryanvi leader, Sir Chhotu Ram, who did so much for the uplift of the peasants, ironically, neglected her. Even Mahatma Gandhi?s championship of women?s rights did not improve her lot. She remains tied to the khunta (wooden peg used for tying animals) and cannot cross the laxman rekha drawn by man. 

 ?We are getting more and more cases of women refusing to undergo abortions because they are carrying a girl, though the numbers are still small. The government has done a lot of work in the villages on the issue. Like the need for education, women are beginning to understand the ill-effects of female foeticide,? a village doctor explains. 

 The refusal of girls to marry illiterate boys has helped reverse another age-old custom. Earlier, getting a match for Haryanvi men in the armed forces was very difficult. Today, even the most traditional families do not hesitate to arrange their daughter?s wedding to a man in green or khaki. The change, villagers say, is the result of changing perceptions among women themselves. ?Earlier, it was the fear of having your daughter in the house for most of the year that haunted us. The girls too girls considered themselves widows if married to someone from the defence forces. Now they take pride in saying they want to marry a fauji. It is better than getting married to an illiterate person,? said the Kalawati sarpanch, Balraj Singh.

 Most of the boys who are finding it difficult to find brides are in the age-group of 18-35 and belong to the Jat and Rajput communities. Some have married outside their castes and many are even scouting for brides in Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa. ?Bauta sochan ki fursat nahin. Vansh chalana hai. (There is no time to think. We have to carry on the family)?, says 25-year-old Hardeva. Uneducated, even girls from his own caste have spurned him. ?I wish I had studied,? he rues.

 Realizing all this, the ruling Indian National Lok Dal party has announced a series of measures for women, a first for any government or party in the state. To begin with, girls in villages are being provided with bicycles to go to school with the promise that they can keep them if they continue beyond class VIII. Toilets, to be used exclusively by women ? a rarity in the state ? and manned by them, are also being built. Earlier, women were forced to relieve themselves in the open after dark. The measures have discomfited the opposition, since elections are scheduled for early next year. Also, a proposal to provide 33 per cent reservation for women in the INLD during the assembly polls is being seriously considered.

 Though slow in coming, the new assertiveness among Haryanvi women is being felt all around.

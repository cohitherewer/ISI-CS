 NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND

 Recorded history

Hitler and his generals: Military conferences 1942-45, 

the first complete stenographic records of the military situation conferences 

from Stalingrad to Berlin, 

Edited by Helmut Heiber and David Glantz, 

Enigma, $ 65

Heiber and Glantz?s book contains verbatim records 

of these military conferences. Hitler blamed the German debacle at Stalingrad 

on military officers disobeying his orders. So, to prevent himself from being 

misquoted and to provide a record for posterity, he ordered that all of what he 

said during these conferences should be taken down by the seven typists who were 

employed for this task. Out of the nearly 10,000 typed pages, about 1000 pages 

survived when Berlin fell to the allieds. These constitute the subject matter 

of this book.

 These records show the absolute control Hitler had over his subordinates. Whatever he said was met with very little opposition from the generals. Hitler, according to Heiber, had an eye for detail and continuously pushed, cajoled and even threatened his subordinates. Often, the fuehrer would be seen arguing with his generals over the number of tanks and assault guns in the panzer divisions. 

 Hitler had a profound knowledge of ordnance. He had correctly pointed out that unless the German light fighters were equipped with heavier weapons, they had little chance against the heavily armed American bombers, something which Luftwaffe experts failed to realize.

 The typed pages also reveal the myriad shades in Hitler?s persona. Once, the news of the death of his favourite general was met with a curt ?oh? from him. On another occasion, when he was told about the rapid advances made by the Red Army, the fuehrer digressed from the topic and started sharing his views on women. On some occasions, he admitted that he had seriously underestimated the Russians, who, according to Hitler, were ?pigs?. He also showed very little remorse for the loss of German lives in the war.

 That the Nazi regime was riddled with factionalism is also apparent from these accounts. The generals maintained an agent in Hitler?s court who represented his master?s interests. Even when the collapse of the Reich was imminent, Goering, unlike Fegelin, was seen criticizing Himmler in front of the Fuehrer. 

 There has been a radical shift in the historiography of the war. Instead of focussing on military strategy and technology, historians are now more interested in the trials and tribulations faced by the unknown men who fought the war rather than in trying to portray it as a ?white man?s burden?.

 Although these developments are welcome, one must not forget that millions died because of the decisions taken by a few. And Hitler definitely belonged to this group of the chosen few. Hitler had not written his autobiography. The conference records fill this gap to an extent. They show how Hitler, even during the last conference, was ranting about his imminent martyrdom as time ran out for the architect of the Third Reich.

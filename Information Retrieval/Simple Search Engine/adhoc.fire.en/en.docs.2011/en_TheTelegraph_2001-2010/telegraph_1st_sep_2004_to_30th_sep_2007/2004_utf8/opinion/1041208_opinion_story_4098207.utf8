 NO FRESH AIR

 Can West Bengal afford to make its students environmentally aware? Those in charge of carrying out the Supreme Court?s directive earlier this year to make environmental studies compulsory in schools and colleges seem to be having a very difficult time with the idea. The state?s board of secondary education and its council for higher secondary education are both in a deep muddle over every aspect of the new subject. The NCERT has drawn up provisional syllabi, which the court had approved. But the board and council are at a loss with trying to coordinate the teaching and examining of the subject. The resultant chaos is a good index of how far from being innovative and adaptable the entire infrastructure of education happens to be in the state. The sheer number of institutions and of the students in them is, of course, a very real challenge. But the problem is also with a certain kind of rigid and unimaginative pedagogy. 

 Environmental studies demand an open and inter-disciplinary approach, which requires not only a certain breadth of interests in individual subject teachers but also intelligent and motivated coordination between teachers who teach different subjects. Besides, each school or college should be able to adapt the syllabus according to its own resources and local interests and issues. Schools in the Sunderbans and those up north in the hills might choose to teach the same subject in very different ways. So the syllabus and methods of examination should encourage and make room for such variations. The rest of the problems ? the red-tape and the nitty-gritty ? will work themselves out only after the innovations are taken on in the right spirit. The principle behind the Supreme Court?s directive was surely not to burden students with more information, and teachers and examiners with another set of joyless chores. The apex court was concerned with the development of a certain kind of awareness, that is both caring and vigilant. Perhaps a government that has for years made no effort whatsoever to stop vehicles from poisoning citizens with their emissions, and insists on playing a criminally callous political game with the issues of air pollution and groundwater conservation, does not really want young people in the state to start thinking seriously and independently about such things.

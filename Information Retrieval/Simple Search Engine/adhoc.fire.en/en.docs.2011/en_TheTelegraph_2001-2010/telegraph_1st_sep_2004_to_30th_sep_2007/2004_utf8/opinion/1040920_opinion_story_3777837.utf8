 TOO COMMITTED

 This has become a government with omission of reforms and commission of commissions. The mind boggles at the number of task forces, commissions and boards that have been set up and additional ones are in the offing, the investment commission prominent in the pending list. The two latest announcements concern the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council and the National Commission on Enterprises in the Unorganized/Informal Sector. The second was originally supposed to be called the national employment commission, but the government presumably realized the folly of trying to ensure employment through a commission. Two groups within the Planning Commission (the Montek Singh Ahluwalia and S.P. Gupta reports) have already examined the employment issue. That apart, there is the proposed legislation on right to employment, being pushed by the National Advisory Council and the reservation for backward castes agenda, being pushed by the group of ministers. Consequently, beyond ensuring employment to the exalted members, there would have been nothing for the employment commission to do. Will the renamed National Commission on Enterprises be any different? For a start, transaction costs faced by Indian business are indeed significant and these must be borne in mind before import duty reductions, multilateral or bilateral, take place. Indeed, the competitive disadvantages need to be measured and quantified.

 But the Planning Commission has now been rejuvenated and should get down to serious business, beyond pushing infrastructure and annoying the left. Couldn?t the Planning Commission have done these studies? For that matter, the Tariff Commission and Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices should also have natural advantages in undertaking such studies. Instead, the United Progressive Alliance government believes in setting up fresh commissions. Lest one forget, there will be a board for public sector units to examine similar issues for the public sector. The newly announced National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council will presumably examine it for the private organized sector, with investment issues shoved to the investment commission. 

 For agriculture, we already have the Agriculture Commission. And for the unorganized and informal sector, we must have the National Commission on Enterprises. Unless one believes in postponing reforms or has the objective of parking people who could not be otherwise accommodated in these bodies, this is a most peculiar way of approaching the problem. In diverse sectors, ranging from banking to steel and petroleum and oil and gas, UPA ministers have been arguing for mergers and acquisitions. Those arguments of synergy and economies of scale apply equally to ministries. And they also apply equally to these various commissions. Taxpayers? money is involved and requires accountability.

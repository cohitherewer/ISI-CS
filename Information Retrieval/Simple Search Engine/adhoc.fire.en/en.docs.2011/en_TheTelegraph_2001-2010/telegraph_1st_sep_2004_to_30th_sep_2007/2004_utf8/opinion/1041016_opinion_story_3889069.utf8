 IN THENAME OF THE FATHER

 These are trying times for Uddhav Thackeray. Despite his parent?s blessings, it?s today?s Maharashtra Assembly election results that will define his true position in the Shiv Sena

 Uddhav Thackeray does not roar ? he doesn?t even bare his fangs. Unlike his father, Shiv Sena boss Bal Thackeray, the 44-year-old executive president of the party does not claim that he is a tiger of a man. The closest that he came to a tiger, says his official website, was when he shot one, and that too, with a camera.

 In Sena circles, an unwillingness to roar should be a disqualification for anybody hoping to lead the party. Clearly, Uddhav ? officially anointed the would-be head of the Sena by Bal Thackeray last month ? lacks the aggressive postures of his father and cousin, Raj Thackeray. Raj, stubbornly refusing to give up hopes of leading the post-Bal Thackeray Shiv Sena, is just waiting for Uddhav to slip. And the result of the Maharashtra Assembly elections ? out later today ? will decide just how sound the ground is under Uddhav?s feet.

 This election was Uddhav?s baby. Not only did he choose most candidates, he also drew up the poll strategy ? though, says an insider, ?in consultation with? his father.

 ?It?s an acid test for him especially when Raj has publicly declared his desire to become chief minister in case the Sena-BJP forms a government,? a Sena-watcher says.

 These are trying times for the Sena. In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, it lost most of the seats it contested ? including the two fought by former Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi and firebrand Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Nirupam. Bruising defeats in the Assembly elections will not only dent the confidence of the Shiv Sainiks in Uddhav, but will provide Raj with a stick to beat his cousin with in a struggle for power.

 Sena leaders, however, have no doubts about the political heir of Bal Thackeray. For them, the issue was settled a long time ago when Balasaheb quietly threw his weight behind Uddhav, favouring his son over his nephew.

 It was only a matter of time before Bal Thackeray set the decision in concrete. First, Uddhav was appointed working president and then, a year ago, executive president of the party. He is now second in command. And it is official.

 His first test came during the election to the Birhanmumbai Municipal Corporation in February 2002. He selected the candidates, decided the campaign strategy and managed the actual poll. And the Shiv Sena managed to lick the Nationalist Congress Party-Congress combine, retaining its control over the crucial civic body in the commercial capital.

 But even as the first feather in Uddhav?s cap fluttered in a mild sea breeze, he launched the controversial ?Mee Mumbaikar? campaign last year to ?instil a sense of belonging in those who made it big? in the city. Before long, the so-called civic movement had degenerated into a tirade against non-Maharashtrians living in the city.

 Accusing the non-Maharashtrians of seizing jobs and opportunities from the Marathi-speaking people, Sena workers trashed shopping malls, demanding jobs for the ?sons of the soil?. The Sainiks also vandalised the railway recruitment board office in Mumbai, accusing the railway ministry of giving jobs mostly to Biharis.

 As the situation threatened to spiral out of control, Uddhav was forced to call the campaign off. The Assembly elections were around the corner, and the party?s leaders did not want the campaign to affect their election prospects.

 Uddhav?s role in the party is, clearly, under a scanner. He faced a near-revolt when he decided to drop several sitting MLAs in the Assembly elections. He argued that the decision was based on the feedback he had got from workers. But there were angry murmurs in the party that tickets had been denied to those perceived as being close to Raj Thackeray.

 The battle between the young Thackerays shows few signs of petering out. For the two ? both former students at the JJ School of Applied Arts ? are mirror images of each other. If Uddhav is cool, calm and soft-spoken, his cousin is fiery, imperious and temperamental. While Uddhav sticks to a sober kurta and pyjama or jeans and T-shirts, Raj dresses colourfully and flamboyantly. Raj apes Balasheb, to the hilt, down to Balasaheb?s mannerisms and choice of strong words. Like the Sena supremo, he also has a way with people.

 ?After Deshmukh (the former Congress chief minister) came Hasmukh,? he told an election rally in Ahmed Nagar, referring to chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde. ?He always smiles, whether there are suicides of farmers or deaths of children from malnutrition.? Like his uncle before him, the rhetoric helps him connect with crowds.

 Not surprisingly, Sena workers see the reflection of Bal Thackeray not in his son, but in his nephew, who resembles his uncle. ?Raj always takes care to be seen as the worthy successor of his uncle,? a Sena leader says.

 But looks ? or words ? will not warm the cockles of Balasaheb?s heart. The Sena has come to rely on Uddhav after Balasaheb anointed him in true dynastic fashion.

 An electoral success would bolster that. And an upset could bring about a change.

 SUCH A LONG JOURNEY

 Home away from home 

Counterflows to Colonialism 

By Michael H. Fisher 

Permanent Black, Rs 795

It was a cold, clear September day in the year 1613. 

Hostile winds had driven the ship carrying Mariam, an Armenian-Indian woman, who 

was travelling to England for the first time to a shore just off Ireland. Her 

husband, William Hawkins, an English diplomat, merchant, sea - captain and adventurer, 

had died on board along with most of the ship?s crew and passengers. Helpless 

and heart-broken, Mariam nevertheless befriended and later married fellow passenger 

and English merchant, Gabriel Towerson. With him, she finally reached London where 

she stayed on for many years. 

 Like Mariam, many Indians had travelled to, and settled in, England for different reasons since the early 1600s. Counterflows to Colonialism is about these Indians. It is a delightful account of the history of the period between 1600 ? when the East India Company came into being ? and 1857 ? the year of the Sepoy Mutiny, after which many aspects of life for Indians in Britain changed considerably. The story is told from the point of view of Indian travellers and settlers in Britain.

 The author, Michael H. Fisher, writes, ?The mainstream of colonialism undoubtedly consisted of the movement of Britons outwards as they traded, conquered and ruled India. Yet a mounting ?counterflow? of Indians entered Britain, living there and producing knowledge in ways that compelled British responses?. So much so that by the mid - 19th century, ?tens of thousands of Indian seamen, servants, scholars, soldiers, students, envoys, royalty, officials, merchants, tourists, and settlers had all journeyed to Britain?, writes Fisher.

 Fisher weaves wonderfully descriptive tales around these individuals. He not only traces the compulsions that drove them to distant shores but also provides interesting details about their lives. We are told for instance, that Mariam?s mother and brothers were reluctant to see her leave and the couple ? Mariam and Hawkins ? tricked them into believing that they were visiting Goa.

 The book also provides glimpses into the way both the Indians and the British responded to each other and how their relationship changed from one of symbiosis to colonial dominance.

 Fisher?s book is a product of painstaking research. The material he has sifted through is vast and scattered. Fisher himself points out, ?Some twenty Indians variously wrote books in Arabic, English, Nepali, Persian and Urdu about their experiences there, assessing and often critiquing as well as praising aspects of Britain. Some published their books in Britain, others simply circulated them as manuscripts among their peers in India. Dozens printed self-advertisements or pamphlets in the British press. Many more wrote autobiographical letters of petitions, or testified before Parliament, London courts, and at meetings of East India Company stockholders or directors?.

 The British, too, recorded their impressions of the Indians. For instance, ?The conversations, comportment and appearance of Indians in Britain, British official census, tax, judicial and other documents recorded thousands of Indians, intermixed with Britons.? Many of these have been reproduced in this book.

 Fisher?s work is a recreation of the history of a much-documented period from an exceptionally original point of view. It is also a tale about the lives of many unknown, but real characters.

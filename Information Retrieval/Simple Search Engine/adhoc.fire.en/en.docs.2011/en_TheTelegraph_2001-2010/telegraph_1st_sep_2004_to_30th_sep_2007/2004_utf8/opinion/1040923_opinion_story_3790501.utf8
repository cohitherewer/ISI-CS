 LEFT BALLYHOO

 It is obvious from the storm in a teacup whipped up by a handful of left-leaning economists that they have very little to do. They are also, despite their academic credentials, stricken by the well-known left affliction of hypocrisy and doublespeak. The economists have got very hot under the collar because of the presence of foreign consultants in the Planning Commission. They threatened to resign unless the consultants were forced to quit. Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, had to climb down and give in to the most unreasonable demands of the left economists. Obviously, Mr Ahluwalia was advised by his political masters since the left parties provide crucial support to the Congress-led coalition government. The consultants came from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and McKinsey amp; Company. The left economists felt that the presence of experts from these bodies infringed on the sovereignty of the Planning Commission, which was an organ of the Indian state. It is okay to take money from the World Bank and the ADB, as the left government in West Bengal does, but it is impossible to sit at the same table with representatives of these institutions. McKinsey amp; Co. has done extensive work at the behest of West Bengal?s communist chief minister, but the consultants are untouchable in the Planning Commission because they allegedly enjoy the patronage of the government of the United States of America. It is difficult to imagine anything more preposterous from people who are supposed to be educated and learned.

 The presence of foreign experts as consultants in the sphere of economic policy has a long history in India. Until a few weeks ago, it occurred to no one that this compromised India?s sovereignty. This allegation is somewhat rich coming from the leftists since their prescriptions, till a decade or so ago, all came at the behest of foreigners based either in Moscow or Beijing. It is also ironic that the protests come from a group of academics who at some points in their careers enjoyed funding for their research from foreign funding agencies. Nobody doubts the left?s claim to make contributions to national life and to the powers of the Indian state, but to make that claim credible, the leftists will have to avoid stooping to cheap and petty pressure tactics.

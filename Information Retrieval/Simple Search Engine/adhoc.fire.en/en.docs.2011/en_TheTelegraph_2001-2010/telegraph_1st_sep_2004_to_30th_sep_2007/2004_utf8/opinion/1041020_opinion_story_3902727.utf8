 POLITICS OF GAS

 Commerce often succeeds where politics fails, especially in these market-driven times. The Tata Group?s decision to invest nearly $2 billion in new projects in Bangladesh could do more to ease relations between Dhaka and New Delhi than politicians and diplomats have been able to do in recent years. Most important, this investment ? the biggest in Bangladesh?s history ? should dispel the perception in Dhaka that India has only an exploiter?s interest in its economy. The steel plant, the power generation project and the fertilizer unit that the Tatas plan to set up in Bangladesh could give the industry-starved country?s economy a major boost. Of particular interest in the agreement that was signed during Mr Ratan Tata?s visit to Dhaka last week was the clause guaranteeing the supply of Bangladeshi gas to the planned units. The supply of gas to India or its use by an Indian company has long been a major political issue in Bangladesh. As a result, the economic benefits of the country?s gas reserves have been lost in skewed political and diplomatic debates. It speaks of the Tata Group?s sound business sense that it ignored these debates to decide on the investment. 

 Ironically, the Tatas? decision has come at a time when relations between the two countries have been rather cold. New Delhi has been concerned about the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in Bangladesh. This, and the use of Bangla- deshi territory by militants from India?s Northeast, have become a major security concern for India. Bangladesh?s refusal to even admit the presence of these militants on its soil, let alone take action against them, has been a major irritation for South Block. Bangladesh takes much the same position on the other Indian complaint of illegal migration from across the border. It is time Dhaka realized that the idea of insurgency as a tool of diplomacy has been discredited all over the world. Some recent remarks by Bangladesh?s foreign minister, Mr Morshed Khan, have only complicated matters further. Trade and commerce between the two countries have thus been held hostage to strained diplomatic relations. Dhaka must realize that it could immensely benefit from the large and expanding Indian economy if only it responded positively to the latter?s security concerns. Once the cloud of mistrust clears, it could be easier to remove other bilateral irritants.

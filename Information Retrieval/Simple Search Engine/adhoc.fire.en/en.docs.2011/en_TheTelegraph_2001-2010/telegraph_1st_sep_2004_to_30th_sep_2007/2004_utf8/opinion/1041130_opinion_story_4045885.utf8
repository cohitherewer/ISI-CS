 GODMEN AND CITIZENS

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Ask yourself a question: why did the BJP leaders do their little hunger-strike drama on Parliament Street in Delhi instead of doing it outside the math in Tamil Nadu? Were they scared of what Jayalalithaa would have done to them? Is that how motivated they are about the issues that they protest against? Is it merely a minor political jig? And, since when has Chandra Shekhar, along with George Fernandes, become so holier than thou? It was comic to see these characters do their nautanki without audience or applause. The only reaction was, what?s up with all those aged men and middle-aged women? Are they against the law taking its course? Are they supporting people charged with conspiracy to murder? Have godmen got a special prerogative? Do they want godmen and politicians to be above and beyond the law? Do they want to establish a special privileges act for themselves, separating them from the people? And, is that not a symptom of true fascism? 

 No wonder that with this kind of mindset they did nothing to reform the horrors that beset our society. Rape, dowry-killings and extortion are some of the social evils that none of the leaders on this particular hunger strike sought to demolish. Advani did not go on strike when rape or dowry-killings happened. Why? Is it because godmen were not the accused? What will they say and do when a godman is found indulging in rape? Will they condone it as a spiritual exercise?

 Over the last six years, the incidence of traditional assaults on women has increased and the worst cases of dowry demands on women who have had conservatively arranged marriages, often leading to death, flood our newspapers. Harassment of women is rampant. In our villages, the police stand like silent spectators when women of lower castes are brutalized by the higher castes. The manner in which the higher castes behave is untenable in civilized society. How come the proponents of Hindutva have not gone on a fast unto death to bring an end to the horrors of their society?

 Fringe radicals

 Instead of over-reacting to the custody of the Shankaracha- rya, they should be doing a padyatra across India, since they are out of work, denouncing the evils of Hindu society and calling for true social reform. Surely women in the BJP like Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti need to make this their call ? end dowry, end uppercaste brutality on the less privileged, cease assaults on women. What is the point of daily prayer and worship, the protection of temples and godmen, if these politicians are not concerned about the daily horrors inflicted by Hindus on Hindus, as a start, based on caste and class, in urban and rural India alike. 

 Then, the attack that has been conducted with regularity on other minority communities, by the same brigades, is yet another imperative reform that needs the attention of all civilized people, regardless of caste, faith and creed. Who better to deliver this than the party that prides itself on being the staunchest proponent of Hindutva? Since it was not able to dilute corruption, or reform the judiciary and the administration, or make the necessary political correctives when it was in power, a correction of malpractices in society that survive and grow under a contorted umbrella of Hindutva, needs to be their special mission. They claim to understand the faith, the philosophy, the religion better than anyone else and should therefore be in a position to extract the purest values and introduce a cleansing process in this society. As they claim to be the protectors of the faith, the ?believers?, it must become their responsibility to introduce a sense of dignity to life and living for all Indians, men and women, if they want Indians to accept them. Otherwise they will be the representatives of merely radical Hindus on the fringe.

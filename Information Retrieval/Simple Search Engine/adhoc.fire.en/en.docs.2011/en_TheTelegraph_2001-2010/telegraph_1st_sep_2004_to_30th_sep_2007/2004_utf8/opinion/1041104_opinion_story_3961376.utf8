 FINE LINE

 Court cases have a propensity to pop up at the wrong time. Mr L.K. Advani, made chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party for a fifth time, could have done without the Allahabad high court?s reopening of the Babri Masjid case right at this moment. Far away in Maharashtra, the Best Bakery case is being heard again, transported out of Gujarat at the Supreme Court?s orders. Its impact may be less direct, but hardly pleasant for the BJP. After all, the BJP still has not been able to plant its feet firmly on the ground after the unexpected descent from cloud nine in the Lok Sabha elections. The defeat in Maharashtra, following so soon after, has left the ground shifty and mysterious. Mr Advani is being compelled to tread a fine line between Hindutva-selling and ?nationalism?, to please the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad on the one side and National Democratic Alliance allies on the other. 

 The NDA allies are unlikely to go for Hindutva or for the glorification of the Ram Janmabhoomi programme. And the BJP has need of its partners with the Bihar elections barely three months away. It would like to form an anti-Laloo Yadav front including Mr Ram Vilas Paswan. Against this, the Rashtriya Janata Dal is thinking of a calibrated tie-up with the Bahujan Samaj Party to prevent Mr Paswan?s incursion into particular backward classes vote banks. Nor can the BJP duck the vociferous criticism of the RSS, which is convinced that the BJP?s failure in the general elections is due purely to its moving away from the Hindutva agenda. The VHP is threatening to form a new front that will also revive Kashi and Mathura. Mr Advani?s assurances at the BJP national council that the building of a Ram temple at Ayodhya had become ?inevitable? were even more inevitably undercut by his words of caution, that overt Hindutva campaigns with rath yatras might whip up a negative reaction. The tightrope is slippery; his efforts at moderation had to be glossed by Mr Arun Jaitley immediately after, because the NDA partners had turned jumpy at the mention of temple-building. No wonder Mr Advani is finding nationalism a safer ideology to spout than Hindutva. But the BJP still has not managed to get down to the brass-tacks. What went wrong? As long as it evades the necessary soul-search, Mr Advani will have to keep on treading gently. It is the BJP?s dream he might tread on.

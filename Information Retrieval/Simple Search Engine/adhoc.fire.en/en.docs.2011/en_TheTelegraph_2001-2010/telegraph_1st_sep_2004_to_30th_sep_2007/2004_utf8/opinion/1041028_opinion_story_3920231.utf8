 ROUND AND ROUND THEY GO, ENDLESSLY

 The Centre needs to tackle the issue of integration ? the main demand of the NSCN(I-M) ? if there is to be lasting peace, writes Nishit Dholabhai

 Muivah and Swu: talk to us

 The NSCN(I-M) leaders? acceptance of the invitation to visit New Delhi later this year is a reason for worry more than it is one for optimism regarding the progress of the negotiations. The president of the outfit, Isak Chishi Swu, and its powerful general secretary, Thuingaleng Muivah, last visited Delhi in January 2003. The talks failed. Two years later, the NSCN (I-M) leaders will undoubtedly be more aggressive in their negotiations. 

 Although both Delhi and the NSCN (I-M) say that ?everything is positive?, in reality it is not so. Integration of all Naga-inhabited areas ? the main demand of the rebel organization ? is like a proverbial fishbone stuck in the gullet of the negotiating sides. 

 In Nagaland, the NSCN (I-M) has succeeded in triggering a public outcry on the pace of the talks and on the importance of ?unification of the Naga homeland?. A few days before the talks were to begin, NGOs like the Naga Hoho, the Naga People?s Movement for Human Rights, the Naga Mothers Association and the Naga Students Federation held a two-day seminar in Kohima. The Hoho, which is the apex body of Naga tribes, had set up a ?working group on integration/unification of Naga homeland? a few weeks ago.

 The seminar was inaugurated by none other than the state chief minister, Neiphiu Rio. The latter aggressively campaigned for integration, promising his support as well as that of his government. Public opinion has apparently started to accept that there is a strong local sentiment in favour of the outfit?s demand ? especially since there is no S.C. Jamir to say otherwise!

 What the Centre needs to do now is keep the peace in the region. Negotiations are already in danger of breaking down, notwithstanding the willingness of the two rebel leaders to visit New Delhi once again and hold talks with the prime minister, Manmohan Singh.

 In August, when a group of Nagaland legislators met Swu and Muivah in Bangkok, they were told in no uncertain terms that the talks would break down unless some headway was made on the demand for integration by next July, when the ceasefire is due for yet another extension. In the last seven years, but for vague statements about ?positive talks?, neither the Centre nor the NSCN (I-M) has announced any concrete decision.

 As a result, the people?s anxiety turned into impatience and the impatience is slowly giving way to anger. This is where the danger lies. Public pressure is being stepped up on the NSCN (I-M) to prove its mettle even as people have begun rebelling outright against the rebels? ?tax collection? and intimidation as well as the in-fighting among the many groups. There was a recent article about how a solution to the Naga problem was far off because the rebels had got used to plush apartments and a luxurious lifestyle and could not brave life in the jungles anymore.

 All this has had an effect and the NSCN (I-M) is on its toes now to bring about a breakthrough of some sort or return to the jungles in order to prove its credibility to the masses. Subtle movements towards that goal have already begun. The NSCN (I-M) leaders have made much of their activists being kept ?almost like prisoners? at the designated camps. A compromise was reportedly struck with the Centre and the issue seems to have cooled, at least for now. 

 The NSCN (I-M)?s recent move to dictate education policy in schools is another example of the outfit?s determination to assert its image as the ?government of the people?s republic of Nagalim?. 

 Yet, another angle was added to the already complex situation on October 2, with the twin blasts in Dimapur killing 27 people and injuring more than a hundred. No one claimed responsibility, but the National Democratic Front of Bodoland is alleged to be the prime suspect. But if one goes into the details of the NDFB?s motive to attack Dimapur, far away from Bodo areas, it will give the Centre one more reason to be serious in its talks with any of the Naga outfits. 

 Many in the establishment whisper that the NDFB was, in some way, trying to get even with the NSCN (I-M). The two outfits are said to have had an understanding in the past about arms and ?tax? money. Be that as it may, the crux of the matter is that peace in the North-east will depend mainly on the way the Centre goes ahead with the peace talks with the NSCN (I-M), considered to be the most powerful umbrella organization in the region. 

 The cradle of complex tribal relations, the North-east cannot be protected by simply talking to Bangladesh or effecting a Bhutan operation or getting into a deal with Myanmar so that it does not support militants from Nagaland or Manipur. An umbrella organization for dozens of outfits in the region, the Isak-Muivah faction of the NSCN could be the key for a return to total mayhem, or to a new era of prosperity in the North-east through the building of ties with south-east Asia. 

 Quite shrewdly, the outfit has thrown the ball in Delhi?s court. It is time now for the latter to find a solution instead of procrastinating endlessly. While sovereignty is perhaps not so much on the minds of the NSCN(I-M) leaders, it might still be a second destination if, and when, integration or a semblance of it is achieved.

 If one considers the North-east as an integral part of the country, then talks have to begin in earnest with the rebels and be brought to a conclusion. It might well be remembered that the Naga issue has been simmering for more than five decades now. Development may have come to Nagaland in the past seven years of relative peace but once again, voices are being raised by hardliners on what is more important ? peace or a solution.

 A solution, the NSCN (I-M) claims, is only possible with integration. But the Centre has not denied the possibility of acceding to the demand nor is it going ahead with building a consensus by inviting the major contenders in the hills, like Manipur, to the talks. 

 How the new government at the Centre views the situation in Nagaland will become increasingly important over the next year as the rebels turn on the heat. Procrastination and a divided attitude are sending a mixed message at the grassroots? level, and delaying the government?s dream of integrating people in the North-east into the national mainstream.

 Time is certainly running out for both parties given that three months have gone by since the extension of the ceasefire. In sum, it will be a dangerous year ahead unless a resolution is reached and the hope for peace is translated into concrete measures. If this does not happen, it will be guerrilla wars in the Naga hills once again, the effect of which will spread to the entire region, and beyond, this time.

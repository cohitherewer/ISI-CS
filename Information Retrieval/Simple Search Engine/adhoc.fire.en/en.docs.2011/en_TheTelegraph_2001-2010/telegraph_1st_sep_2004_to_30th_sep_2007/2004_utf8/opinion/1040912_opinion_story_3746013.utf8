 DIARY

 As a Congresswoman, Sheila Dikshit may be glad that her party is back in power in New Delhi, but as chief minister of Delhi she is anything but happy. For while she had built up a comfortable working relationship with Lt Governor Vijay Kapoor, a BJP appointee, the present incumbent and 10 Janpath insider, Banwari Lal Joshi, is giving her sleepless nights. Rumour has it that Governor Joshi simply sits on files cleared by Dikshit?s government, waiting for clearance from the party high command before putting his name on it. But Dikshit has not been two-time chief minister of Delhi without learning a few tricks herself. Nowadays, it is not Joshi but the media which first gets to hear of important decisions of the state cabinet like the Delhi Master Plan. After the media have gone to town over the imminent developments, there is little the governor can do but fall in line and, perhaps, vent his ire on Renu Sharma, the Delhi government spokesperson who briefs the press. When titans clash it is the lesser mortals who take a beating.

 Don?t be taken in by the BJP top brass?s angry rhetoric in the Uma Bharti affair. They are actually quite grateful to the Congress for Bharti?s amicable exeunt from the chief minister?s gaddi in Bhopal. For the sanyasin had really been rubbing everyone ? state BJP workers, her cabinet colleagues, and even the central leadership ? the wrong way with her high-handedness, her whimsicality and her tendency to shoot off her mouth at the slightest opportunity. 

 In fact, the standing joke in BJP circles is about the three Gs which did Bharti in ? gau, gomutra and err...Govindacharya. The former CM?s cow fixation is well known, but what is little known is that every morning, officials had to hunt for a cow for her to feed before she had her own breakfast. Worse, on Saturday, the cow had reportedly to be black, else a hungry Bharti would turn her caustic tongue on the officials. And as for Govindacharya, the general feeling is summed up by this comment that Bharti?s brother is alleged to have once made ? ?People call him a think tank, but he is actually a septic tank.? 

 A Gandhi in the BJP is not quite a square peg in a round hole, but it?s close. Ask Feroze Varun Gandhi, who recently spent six hours with the RSS sarsanghchalak, V Sudarshan, in Nagpur. For the young man, it was supposed to be an introduction to the various aspects of the sangh parivar?s activities, but it turned out to be an exposition by Sudarshan on contemporary history. The latter?s views on Nehru, whom the saffronites blame for much that is wrong in India today, had even Feroze rattled. For the moment, political loyalty has proved to be thicker than blood. Which also shows how politics runs in the Nehru-Gandhi veins. 

 Politics is all about getting your work done and no one knows this better than Mulayam Singh Yadav. The adroitness with which the Samajwadi Party chief had Javed Usmani inducted into the PMO had even bureaucrats rubbing their eyes in disbelief. Mulayam apparently approached HS Surjeet ? who can never refuse the Samajwadis anything ? because he knew that Sonia Gandhi would not be amenable to a request from him, but would never say no to papaji. The political juggernaut, it seems, can take unexpected turns.

 Times change and the man who once wore nothing but a dhoti now prefers a safari suit. Some would say that moving with the times is only natural, but not BS Shekhawat who took a jibe at the change in AB Vajpayee?s sartorial preferences at a public function. He then recalled how Deen Dayal Upadhyay had held a national executive meet at a dharamsala in Kota ? taking a dig at the present leadership?s preference for five-star hotels. To the amused and amazed audience, it seemed as if the vice-president was trying to do a Vajpayee on Vajpayee. But perhaps Shekhawat should pause to draw a lesson from the way the former PM has been sidelined in the party. 

 Rahul Gandhi is a conscientious MP who went to Amethi on rakshabandhan, paid surprise visits to several villages, proferred his wrists to any girl with a rakhi and gave them Rs 100 in return. Only he told no one about it ? neither the media nor his own partymen. Just goes to show how much he has to learn yet.

 Salman Khurshid is learning Urdu at the ripe old age of 50 plus. Nowadays, all his letters to partymen are written in the language under the watchful eyes of his tutor ? a part-time lecturer at Jamia Millia Islamia , who also works at the AICC. The former chief of the Uttar Pradesh party unit and grandson of the former president, Zakir Hussain, was brought up in the environs of Jamia Millia but left to study abroad before he could pick up more than a rudimentary knowledge of his mother tongue. Thus the perception gained ground that Khurshid was a vilayat-returned elite who couldn?t possibly understand the aam mussalman ? a perception that hadn?t helped his political career much. Khurshid has been trying to rectify the perception by brushing up his Urdu, as well as attending mosque on Fridays and keeping rozas. Well, one is never too old to start learning something.

 BOOK THAT CHANGED THE SKIES

 Lesson in the sun

THE BOOK NOBODY READ: IN PURSUIT OF THE 

REVOLUTIONS OF NICOLAUS COPERNICUS 

By Owen Gingerich, 

Heinemann, pound; 7.95

It is difficult to believe but it is true that before 

the middle of the 16th century, nearly everybody in the Western world were of 

the opinion that the sun went around the world. This was the view of the astronomer, 

Ptolemy, which the church of Rome accepted and advocated. This opinion began to 

change with the publication in 1543 of the book called On the Revolutions of 

the Heavenly Spheres by Nicolaus Copernicus. Arguing directly against the 

orthodoxy, Copernicus presented a radically different structure of the cosmos 

which had the sun at its centre.

 The prevalent view of the book, popularized by Arthur Koestler, says that no one took notice of Copernicus?s tract. Koestler famously described it as the book that nobody read. Owen Gingerich, professor of astronomy and the history of science at Harvard, refused to accept this evaluation of the 16th-century magnum opus on science and astronomy. Thus began a journey of love and obsession.

 Gingerich took a simple path to disprove Koestler. He decided to track down every single existing copy of Copernicus?s book and then try and reconstruct that book?s history and readership. The method was simple, but the task was laborious. This book is the account of the journey that took him to various libraries across the world, from Aarhus to Beijing to Coimbra to Dublin, from Melbourne to Moscow, from St Gallen to San Diego.

 The idea that such a refutation of Koestler was possible and highly likely occurred to the author when he came across a first edition of the book in the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. This particular volume was annotated from beginning to end. If the book was so neglected, why was this particular volume so carefully studied? Some amount of detective work revealed the annotator to be none other than Erasmus Reinhold, the leading astronomy teacher of northern Europe.

 Beginning in Edinburgh with an astronomer?s copy, Gingerich ?found copies owned by saints, heretics, and scalawags, by musicians, movies stars, medicine men and bibliomaniacs.? But for him the most interesting and significant were the copies once owned and annotated by astronomers, since these ?illuminate the long process of acceptance of the sun-centred cosmos as a physically real description of the world?.

 The annotations of astronomers in the various copies of the book provided valuable clues about how Copernicus?s heliocentric universe won peer-group recognition before it became part of scientific learning and then of popular consciousness.

 Ownership is of course no index to readership. Neither is annotation a good index of readership. Many people owned the book but did not read it and similarly many read the book but did not annotate it. Gingerich offers no qualitative evidence about the book?s circulation. But the book certainly was not Koestler?s ?worst seller?. Gingerich?s footwork to demonstrate this is admirable.

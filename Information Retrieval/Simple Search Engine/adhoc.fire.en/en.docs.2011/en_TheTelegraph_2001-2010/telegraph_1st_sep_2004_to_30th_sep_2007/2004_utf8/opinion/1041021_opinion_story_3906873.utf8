 FIRST HURDLES

 The first hurdles are often the most difficult to cross in peace talks. It is a good omen that both the Assam government and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland have overcome mutual suspicion and begun the first round of peace negotiations. After the gruesome killings in a bomb blast in Dimapur in neighbouring Nagaland and yet another massacre of innocent people in Assam?s Kokrajhar district, the peace moves have rung in a time of hope for the North-east. Given the chequered history of peace talks in the region, it is possible that the dialogue with the Bodo militants would run into some difficulties. But the two sides cannot afford to let the problems derail the peace process. How the NDFB honours its commitment to a six-month ceasefire will be a crucial test of its sincerity regarding peace. Sceptics have argued that the NDFB?s truce offer is actually a ploy to buy time and rebuild its bases that had been destroyed in recent anti-insurgency operations. Even if this suspicion has some basis, it is no reason for not giving peace a chance. If the militant Bodos can be persuaded to lay down arms, both Dispur and New Delhi can use the example to initiate peace moves with the United Liberation Front of Asom.

 However, the Assam government has to work on another front to strengthen the peace initiative. As with many other ethnic insurgencies in the North-east, Bodo militancy has its roots in a feeling of political and economic deprivation. For decades, the Bodos felt alienated from Dispur?s rule and also from the mainstream of Assamese politics. The problem has been solved, albeit partially, with the setting up of the Bodoland Territorial Council last year. The council has fulfilled the Bodos? aspiration for self-rule and kindled their hope of a better economic life. But the transfer of power from state governments to such autonomous bodies is often caught in bureaucratic and other wrangles. Assam?s chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, has thus taken a timely step by transferring 39 subjects to the council?s jurisdiction. That this has been done at the start of the peace talks is of much significance. The success of the council is absolutely necessary to give the Bodos their rightful place in the larger Assamese society. But the council can work to the Bodos? satisfaction only in an atmosphere of peace.

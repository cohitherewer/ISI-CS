 THE RULER AND HIS SUBJECTS

Robes of Honour: Khilat in Pre-Colonial and 

Colonial India, 

Edited by Stewart Gordon, 

Oxford, Rs 395

The practice of Khil?at can be traced back to the 

Sino-Mongolian heritage ? Chinese emperors gifted silken robes to the leaders 

of nomadic bands to incorporate them into the state. This custom was also prevalent 

among Mongols, Delhi Sultans, Mughals and Marathas.

 In Islamic polities, security chiefs received robes of honour along with weapons from the rulers as rewards for their loyalty thereby establishing a personal bond with the king. 

 The Mughals used to manufacture robes for Khil?at in their karkhanas. Some of them were purchased while others were obtained as tribute from vassals. Under the Mughals, the ceremony however became a graded affair. Superior robes denoted higher status of the recipients in the eye of the Padshah. 

 These fragile political entities were continuously threatened by factional feuds. One way to maintain peace was through the practice of Khil?at which was actually a symbol of fealty. The exchange of robes functioned as visible representations of state authority. It also played an important role in generating solidarity among the ruler and his subjects. 

 The practice of ?giving? and ?taking up? of pan, a predominantly Hindu practice, was similar to Khil?at. The royal gift of pan was also used to foster new political relations. Interestingly, this practice was not unheard of among Mughals. Both the Khil?at and the practice of pan were grand affairs. These events also indicated that personal relations were as important as impersonal institutions like the bureaucracy. 

 The centrality of these practices among Mughals, according to one contributor, proves that the Mughal empire was a patrimonial, bureaucratic entity. Significantly, when the reigns of power passed on to the British, they refused to be drawn into the complexities of this culture in order to devise a centralized bureaucratic state. By focussing on the non-institutional basis of political power in pre-colonial India, this book enriches our understanding of pre-modern political structures in the subcontinent.

 MISSED CHANCE

 Only diehard cynics would refuse to give peace a chance. But the cynicism that marked the United Liberation Front of Asom?s rejection of the prime minister?s offer of peace-talks is also a great betrayal of the Assamese people. Here, at long last, was a fresh wind of hope blowing through the North-east, symbolized by the visit of the two rebel Naga leaders, Mr Isak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, to Nagaland just before Christmas. In Assam, too, the Bodo militants? ceasefire signalled the same air of expectancy. The prime minister?s initiative had capped that moment of hope. Instead of seizing the opportunity, the ULFA took to devious arguments to reject the offer. But its vain attempt at grandstanding is simply out of tune with the times. The veteran Assamese writer, Ms Indira Goswami, who had urged the government to open the peace-talks apparently at the ULFA?s behest, represented the overwhelming popular mood. In rejecting the offer, the rebels have not only dashed the people?s expectations, but also exposed their inability to take advantage of a rare chance. Even a flawed peace could have given the ULFA a kind of moral authority which it cannot hope to achieve with its blood-soaked mutiny. 

 The irrationality of the ULFA?s arguments for turning down the offer of peace can hardly be overstated. Its ?commander-in-chief?, Mr Paresh Barua, was reportedly upset on two counts. He argued that the invitation should have come from Mr Manmohan Singh himself, and not from his office. Mr Barua also saw no merit in the offer because it made no mention of the ULFA?s demand for a ?sovereign? Assam. This is specious reasoning at its worst. Mr Barua had to be extremely na?ve to expect that the prime minister would offer the ?sovereignty? of a state of India on the negotiating table. No matter how unreasonable that demand was, the government did not allow it to stand in the way of the peace offer. That the offer was ?unconditional? suggested a genuine attempt on New Delhi?s part to start a peace process similar to the one with the Nagas. The Naga leaders had also talked of ?sovereignty? for their people, but this did nothing to detract from that peace process. Mr Barua never commanded the authority in Assam that Messrs Swu and Muivah do in Nagaland. He now looks like a small man who cannot see a big chance when it comes his way.

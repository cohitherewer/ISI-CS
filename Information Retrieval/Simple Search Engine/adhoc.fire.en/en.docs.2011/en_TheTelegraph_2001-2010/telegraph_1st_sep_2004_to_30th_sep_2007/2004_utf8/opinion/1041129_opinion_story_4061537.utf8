 PRODIGAL POLLS

 Transparency should be a mindset and not a set of closely guarded rules. This seems to be the principle that prompted the Election Commission to make the public aware of how much money political parties spent, or claim to have spent, for the last Lok Sabha elections. Access to information ought to be at the heart of a democratic society and polity, and the EC wants to place the figures for each party in the public domain, so that citizens and voters can judge for themselves the ethical implications of such expenditure. This is a point that the commission is eager to drive home ? its job is not simply to be a watchdog, but also to increase public awareness and judgment ? and quite rightly so. And the figures remain fairly staggering, even after taking into account the geographical and demographic sweep of the Indian elections. Questions of wastefulness and corruption cannot therefore remain far from such disclosures.

 The Congress claims to have spent Rs 125 crore, each of its 400-odd candidates having used up more than Rs 30 lakh of party funds. It is significant that the Bharatiya Janata Party has not yet submitted its accounts. The obscene prodigality of its India Shining campaign has already aroused a fair amount of debate. Yet this debate has been mostly politically motivated, and not quite the expression of public outrage, from a principled and ethical point of view, as the EC would like to see. The commission has appealed to the public conscience, but is naturally wary of playing an unduly proactive role. In the last elections, for instance, the use of film and television stars and models for campaigning by both parties had reached some sort of a frenzied pitch. How expensive was that, and do these figures reflect those expenses? Besides, such populist strategies assume certain kinds of public mentality, if the mind has anything to do with it, and only the public can question and disprove these assumptions, thereby changing the culture of campaigning itself. This is precisely the sort of change that the EC is unwilling to impose from outside, and wants to foster internally by publishing these figures.

 KEEP THEM IN CHECK

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 A leading vernacular daily recently quoted the Central Vigilance Commission saying that it had identified 371 tainted civil servants who were awaiting ?clearance for action? against them. But there has already been an unusual delay in decision-making, and this has enhanced both the quantity and quality of corruption. Each delay in the process of law and lenient action against erring personnel have emboldened a host of other fence-sitters.

 The CVC corruption statistics itself is a revelation. Charges have been brought against 118 employees in customs and central excise, 58 in telecommunications, 44 in the Delhi Development Authority, 42 in the Delhi government, 15 in information and broadcasting, 26 in income tax, 38 in urban development and 30 in the railways. 

 We?ll discuss two cases (in both the names have been changed) to get a better idea of how corruption works. One Kalyan Kumar Paul and Kamal Kishore Swarup have been charged with the suspected offence of ?conspiracy to cheat the government of India to cause wrongful gains and criminal misconduct by abusing official position as public servant?, thereby violating provisions in both the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

 Why blame them?

 The main aspect of this crime was the acceptance of a grossly undervalued rate declared by the assessee and the release of the consignments without proper penalty. The result was the loss of one crore rupees to the government exchequer. Think of the other Pauls and Swarups, and the extent of loss they inflict on the government together. 

 But why blame the officials? It could have been a genuine error of judgment. Besides, if these officers were corrupt, how come they were never accosted in 30 long years? 

 The doubts are genuine and they would have stood their ground had the corruption-counter wing of the federal government of India not detected something extraordinary. 

 During the ?check period?, Swarup?s income from his salary and other sources were found to be around Rs 11 lakh, and Paul?s about Rs 9 lakh. Yet their assets were found to be disproportionately large, as large as Rs 98 lakh for Swarup and Rs 44 lakh for Paul. The amounts must be mind-boggling for the common man negotiating the potholed roads, breathing the noxious fumes from vehicles and fighting unemployment; but no big deal for custodians of public fund and managers of the state.

 Tip of the iceberg

 But why should anyone haul up the Pauls and Swarups for their ?hard work?? That is because Paul and Swarup are not alone. They no longer constitute the microscopic minority making money at others? expense. The problem is despite being aware of them, the ever-suffering, tolerant public will not ?interfere? in another?s ?internal affair?. 

 Why this tolerance? It is probably because lower down the scale every one also gets a free hand to do their own ?jobs?. The juniors support the ?deeds? of their officers, and this is true for any region in India. Bosses ensure that their supporters are retained on ?humanitarian? grounds in case they err. This nexus is playing havoc on the morale of the vanishing breed of honest civil servants in India.

 There have been several cases of corruption where the stakes ranged from a few hundred to a few thousand rupees. The punishment however was duly meted out. The bigger the corruption, the better the chances of escaping the dragnet because the purchasing power of the big fish can never be doubted. Which is why a charged Paul and Swarup will continue to reveal only the tip of the iceberg.

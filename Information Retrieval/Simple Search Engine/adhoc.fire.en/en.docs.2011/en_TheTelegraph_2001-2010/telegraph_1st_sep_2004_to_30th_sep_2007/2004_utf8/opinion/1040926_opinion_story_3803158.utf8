 Letters to Editor

 Lightness of being

 Sir ? The handbag is part of the woman?s enigma and no woman worth her salt would want to reveal what?s in it. Little wonder that women interviewed in ?What?s in your handbag, ma?am? Well, umm?? (Sept 20) act so clueless about their bags? contents. One thing bothers. How is it that the umbrella is missing from women?s bags in Britain and India, given that both are so prone to sudden showers? Another thing. Women?s bags may carry ?unnecessary? things, but they are much lighter than men?s briefcases ? the reason women suffer less from a frozen shoulder or spondylosis.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Clear position

 Sir ? Unfortunately, it has come to my notice that Elena Banik, an artist of standing, has made certain allegations in respect of two of my exhibits shown recently. In view of her allegation, I would like to make my position clear.

 Umbrella is a medium of expression and therefore, no creative artist can have total monopoly over it. Just for instance paper is a medium, which is used ubiquitously. Just as the human form is used universally and no creative person has monopoly over it.

 The use of the umbrella and gas cylinder as a form and expression cannot be the sole patent of any artist. The matter, which is crucial in this case, is what is expressed and how it is expressed contextually. For instance, Picasso and Braque have explored identical issues, ideas and concepts without having to be blamed of mutual ?plagiarism?. Together they propounded a new wave in the field of cubism in the early 20th century. Another typical example is Luncheon on the Grass by Manet. It had been variously interpreted by leading artists of subsequent generations including Picasso himself. This was not tantamount to plagiarism in conceptual and creative terms.

 Therefore, Elena?s Woman?s Face on a dimensional cylinder has no bearing on my work where I have only used the motif of a gas cylinder stitched on cloth as a metaphor for my concept of ?domesticity?.

 The above works were started way back in 2002-2003 and were selected long before my interlude with Banik?s works in November 2003 (incidentally I was not shown any gas cylinder or umbrella). It seems strange that after seven years of training in art, a popular artist like Elena is oblivious of basic tenets of contemporary artistic thought. A deliberate attempt has been made on her part to malign me and insult my professional standing. Elena is a promising artist and it is sad that her talent is being expended in this kind of puerile activity, which is detrimental to the artistic health of contemporary Indian art.

 Yours faithfully,

Shreyasi Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Power pinches

 Sir ? I am sure that a large number of consumers of CESC have been stumped by the hefty increase in the electricity bill for August. The CESC management has tried to justify the increase, but consumers are not all convinced. Surprising, this increase has come just days after R.P. Goenka?s assurance that he would look into the complaints of consumers. More flabbergasting is the inaction of the ruling and opposition parties. CESC needs to step up their vigil on illegal electrical connections, and metre-tampering. Just advertising that ?power theft is a crime? will not do. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Dutta, Calcutta

 Sir ? With the recent hike in electricity charges, electricity is getting quite unaffordable for middle and lower-middle class families. Moreover, the rates charged and the various slabs have become quite incomprehensible. Then there are the mysterious ?arrears?. Is the CESC taking advantage of its monopoly? 

 Yours faithfully,

B. Datta, Panihati

 THE BOY

 BEHIND

 GEORGE

 Karl Rove?s election strategy followed a simple rule of thumb: never be gentle with the enemy. And now the tactics of Bush?s political advisor stand vindicated 

 When Walter Cronkite spoke out against the Vietnam war on his evening news bulletin way back in the Sixties, US President Lyndon Johnson said, ?If I?ve lost Cronkite, I?ve lost the nation? ? or words to that effect.

 The day the latest bin Laden tape was aired, Cronkite, now long retired, was on CNN?s Larry King Live and the discussion naturally turned to Osama?s direct address to the American people. ?I?m a little inclined to think that Karl Rove, who is a very clever man, set bin Laden up to this thing,? Cronkite said, half in jest of course.

 That?s the sort of humourless joke the US President?s political advisor ? a college drop-out who is often referred to as ?Bush?s Brain? ? evokes. Karl Rove, they say, can do anything. It is just the tone of the voice that will tell you whether the speaker admires or loathes him.

 But George W. Bush?s political mastermind would revel in this kind of a reaction. This, after all, was the centrepiece of his campaign strategy for Bush?s reelection: divide and polarise. A great believer in Machiavelli?s rule of force ? ?A prince is respected when he is a true friend or a downright enemy? ? he ruled that there was no point in being emollient to enemy clans. The anti-war movement should be defeated, he argued, because it will always hate us. Such antagonism, the argument went, would also energise his own clans. Hence the emphasis on the cowboy-style ?for-us-or-against-us? slogans.

 Rural America understands and appreciates that language. All the better if this is deplored in New York and Los Angeles ? seen as Sodom and Gomorrah in the rural western states. Hence, too, plans to amend the US constitution to define marriage and noises about banning abortion, called, appropriately enough, wedge issues.

 For Rove, however, it was not a matter of faith or belief or political ideology; but one of tactics and cold, dispassionate logic. For him, winning is all. Even in his first ever contest, when he ran for the chairmanship of the nationwide College Republicans ? almost tearing the heart out of this student body ? he mounted a no-holds-barred campaign that shocked his contemporaries. Rove challenged the legitimacy of every delegate who voted for his opponent, and came up with an entirely bogus alternate slate of delegates he claimed had greater standing. The matter was ultimately decided in Rove?s favour by the then head of the Republican National Committee, a certain George Herbert Walker Bush. It?s a tie that has grown stronger over the years.

 With Bush Sr?s help and guidance, Rove soon found his true calling: managing elections for others, in his own way, as if the candidates were his business clients. A Texas politician gave an inkling of the process to a New Yorker reporter earlier this year. During his campaign, ?I was in favour of talking about higher education and judicial selection,? the politician recalled, but ?Karl said, ?You may be right, but people don?t care. It doesn?t compel people to vote for you. You have to stay with the issues that compel people?.? Like most Rove candidates, he stayed relentlessly ?on message?.

 With George Bush, who thanked him in his victory speech on Wednesday as the ?architect? (the President?s more personal nicknames for his campaign mastermind are ?Boy Genius? or ?Turd Blossom?), his relationship is quite special. Their first meeting is still etched in his memory. ?It was the day before Thanksgiving, 1973,? Rove told a reporter recently. He was to hand over to the son coming down from Harvard the keys to the family car.

 ?I can literally remember what he was wearing,? Rove said. Bush was in an Air National Guard flight jacket, cowboy boots and blue jeans that even had a circle etched out in one of the back pockets to house such stuff as a tin of snuff or tobacco. ?He was exuding more charisma than any one individual should be allowed to have,? Rove said.

 Rove saw more in Bush then than anybody else. Later, he was to say, ?(George Bush) was the kind of candidate and officeholder political hacks like me wait a lifetime to be associated with.? And with The Return of Bush as a dream project, ?architect? Rove conceived his election campaign, drawing up a battle between the conservative values espoused by Bush and the liberal ideas represented by his opponent. Values won. And, clearly, so did Rove.

 THE HOUSE THAT SYKESES BUILT

 The Library 

The big house: The story of a country house and its 

family 

By Christopher Simon Sykes,

HarperCollins, pound;20 

This is a book redolent with memories and nostalgia 

of an era that has vanished. It is like reading Brideshead Revisited, that 

unforgettable evocation of aristocratic life, only that this is not fiction. Christopher 

Sykes is writing about his ancestral home where he spent his childhood and adolescence.

 The Big House is a great country mansion at Sledmere in the middle of nowhere high up in the Yorkshire Wolds. The first stone of the house was laid in 1751 by Richard Sykes. The history of the house reflects not only the changing social history of England but also the eccentric character of some of its inhabitants. The Sykeses were raised to a baronetcy in the 18th century and the fourth baron, Tatton (1772-1863), was one of the great sights of Yorkshire in his time. He sold the family?s Guttenberg Bible to support his fox hounds. His son was an even bigger eccentric. He wore eight coats which he kept discarding as the day wore on. This enabled him, he maintained, to keep his body temperature constant. On May 23, 1911 when the grand house caught fire (the fire was to destroy the house and it had to be rebuilt), the fifth baron, also called Tatton, was sitting down to lunch. Henry Cholmondeley, the agent, burst into the dining room to tell Sir Tatton that the house was on fire and that he must leave at once. But the old man was interested in nothing but his food. ?I must finish my pudding,?? he declared, ?finish my pudding.?? Obviously, he had his priorities right. When asked about the fire, he said in his laconic fashion, ?These things will happen, these things will happen.??

 Nobody quite expected the house to be rebuilt after the fire. But people hadn?t reckoned with the determination of the family and the love they had for the house. The 20th century version of the mansion was also on a grand scale. The author takes his readers through a tour of the house and they pass, after entering the house through the back door which everyone uses, from the Lift room to the Staff Cloak room through a heavy swing door to the Blue Stairs; opposite the stairs is the Turkish room and below, down a flight of stone steps, are the Gentleman?s Cloakroom and the Gun Room. There is also, on the ground floor, the Horse Room, the Music Room, the Boudoir and Dining Room.

 Ascending the grand stone staircase, the reader is taken into the most magnificent and the most unexpected room in the building. This is the Library which was built on a monumental scale. It stands two storeys high with a vaulted ceiling inspired by the Baths of Caracall and Diocletian in Rome and running the entire width of the house, with nine windows overlooking the landscape and a 120-foot long polished mahogany floor.

 Sykes blends together moods, anecdotes and history to breathe life into the Big House. One major reason for his success is the fact that nothing in the house was ever thrown away. The house was thus full of memorabilia; bric-a-brac collected through the years had their own stories to tell.

 This is a magnificent tribute not only to an unusual house but also to vanished supremacies.

 PRISONS ARE FUN

 The spirit of India ? the sort that cannot, sadly, be ?showcased? in festivals abroad ? is often found in the most unusual of places. In jails, for instance. The typical Indian prison is a fascinating microcosm of the entire nation. Bihar traditionally takes the cake here. Patna?s legendary Beur jail is a better-furnished annexe of the state assembly. Pappu Yadav has been running multiple empires, criminal and political, with the help of the jail?s excellent communications network. An entire parallel ecosystem runs in each of these prisons with varying degrees of sophistication. These involve complicated and perfectly functioning hierarchies and infrastructures, involving money, intoxicants, political clout and myriad other forms of ?influence?. But West Bengal is catching up fast ? on a less high-tech, but certainly more hilarious, scale.

 The other day, the West Bengal secretary of prisons happened to drop in at the Dum Dum central jail in the evening, and ran into a wonderful communal feast being prepared, of all places, on the watch-tower of the prison. He looked up, the door of the watch-tower opened, and an inmate, serving a sentence, emerged from inside in his prison-uniform. The astonished secretary went up to investigate, and found a lavish banquet being cooked by five inmates, with the prison?s rations, the partaking of which was evidently going to break the ranks in that institution. Inmates and jailers were gleefully at it together, and the secretary discovered that this was the usual form of merrymaking in the prison, embracing just about everybody in its communal spirit, from ordinary prison-guards to the chief head warder and the jail superintendent. (Perhaps only an HIV-positive inmate would be rudely left out of the fun.) Investigations, inquiries, complaints, reports and so on have been mentioned by the secretary. But who exactly will be conducting these and on whom? Threats of severe punishment have also been made. But the network of indiscipline and lawlessness is far too sprawling at the moment for a few heads rolling to make any difference. This is the prison from where criminals like Sheikh Vinod have escaped. The secretary has also found out that the walkie-talkie system inside the prison does not quite work. The feast on the watch-tower is the stuff of comedy. But it is also the tip of a menacing iceberg that deserves to be taken with the utmost seriousness.

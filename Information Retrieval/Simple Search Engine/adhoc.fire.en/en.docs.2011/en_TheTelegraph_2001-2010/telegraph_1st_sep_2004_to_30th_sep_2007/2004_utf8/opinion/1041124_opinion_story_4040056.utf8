 HOPE RENEWED

 No peace initiative can be built on unreal foundations. The new hope for peace in Assam may be lost if the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom sticks to unrealistic demands. During his first visit to Assam as prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, therefore, did well to be straightforward about the peace offer to the ULFA. While he invited it to begin a dialogue with the government once again, he made it clear that India?s territorial integrity was not a matter of negotiations. This unambiguous message needed to be sent out to the ULFA, which is so keen to put the issue of Assam?s ?sovereignty? on the negotiating table. The rhetoric on ?sovereignty? is part of the secessionist movement in several states in the North-east. Naga or Bodo rebels also fought to create their own ?sovereign? territories. But that did not stop them from joining peace talks with the government. The prime minister?s peace offer was the second in recent days, the first being his response to the initiative by the well-known Assamese writer, Ms Indira Goswami, at the ULFA?s behest. It is the ULFA?s turn to prove its credentials for peace by responding to the offer. 

 Realism marked the prime minister?s response to the other knotty problem that Assam has lived with for long ? illegal migration into the state from Bangladesh, and how to stop it. He shared the concern of Assam and other north-eastern states over such migration. But he did not accept the suggestion from the All Assam Students? Union that the Illegal Migration (Determination by Tribunals) Act be scrapped. On the contrary, he thought that the law should be applied to other states to deal with similar problems. He could not have been unaware of the limitations of the act or of its inability to solve the problem in Assam. But his argument must have been based on fears that scrapping the act would open a Pandora?s box and unleash massive social tensions between the native Assamese and other communities. The argument may have its validity, but New Delhi needs to devise better methods of stopping illegal migration into the North-east for security reasons. The native community?s fear of being swamped by such migrants caused horrible ethnic killings during the Eighties. The Assam Accord of 1985 promised to settle the issue once and for all. But politicians have kept the issue alive. A realistic solution of the problem is long overdue.

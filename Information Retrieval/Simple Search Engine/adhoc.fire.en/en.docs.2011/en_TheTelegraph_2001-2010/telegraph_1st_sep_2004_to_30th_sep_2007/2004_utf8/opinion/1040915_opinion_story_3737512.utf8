 FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARK

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 Can you really be certain only of things you see in the harsh light of day?

 Moonstruck

 Have you ever heard the footsteps of a ghost? I have. On a stormy, rain-lashed summer night in Calcutta. At the time, I lived alone in a rented room on the ground floor. It was past midnight and after dinner I had gone to bed with a book of short stories and a glass of hot chocolate.

 At first, it was a faint, hollow, rhythmic sound that seemed to come from a distance. Then it grew louder, coming forward slowly but surely. Through the open window, gusts of wind rushed in, sweeping in shadows and whispers of things I knew weren?t really there.

 Yet, I couldn?t really be sure. How could I know that the long, lonely arm with the bony fingers that beckoned to me was really the leafless branch of the neem tree in the courtyard?

 An electric wire must have snapped because the table lamp went out. There was a flash of lightning and a loud crack of thunder.

 The footsteps came nearer. Grew louder. No soft, soundless steps these but steady and sure, as though determined to reach some destination.

 It stopped just outside my door. I heard a shrill sound.

 The backdoor ? the one with the loose metal clasp that doesn?t lock ? swung open and then slammed shut. 

 How could I really know that it was the wind that slammed the door shut and not a lost visitor from the depths of time, who came in with the storm and decided to stay, shutting the door behind? After all, I had heard the knock on the door, but did not answer. ?Who could be knocking at my door at this unearthly hour,? I thought. 

 Can you really only be certain of things that you see in the harsh light of day?

 After that night, I heard the footsteps again and again.

 But it was not until the winter of that year that I had the courage to drag myself out of the security of my warm blanket to try and catch a glimpse of this night prowler.

 It was a strange, blue, misty moonlit night. Standing out on my balcony, I waited for the footsteps to arrive. Stray dogs howled. Cats wailed. One by one the lights went out in the neighbourhood windows. Through the silence, the next door neighbour?s grandfather clock chimed. Twelve ghostly gongs.

 I waited.

 And then I heard them. At first from far away, as though from the past, bringing back untold tales from aeons ago of people whose lives never made it to the pages of history. Tales of people whose voices were never heard and faces never seen. In the hollow sound of the footsteps of this messenger of the night I could hear the message: nothing is born to blush unseen.

 As the footsteps grew louder, I saw a figure covered in white draw slowly forward. It came nearer, until it stood beside my balcony, where the street come to a dead end.

 I don?t think it expected to see anyone standing in the shadows because it looked at me, startled.

 In the pale light of the moon I saw nothing in the eyes of the night watchman. He stood at the end of the road and blew his whistle. He paused for a moment and then turned away.

 Yes, they?ll tell you that those are not the footsteps of a ghost, but only the night watchman?s cane striking the asphalt of the Calcutta streets. But I know better.

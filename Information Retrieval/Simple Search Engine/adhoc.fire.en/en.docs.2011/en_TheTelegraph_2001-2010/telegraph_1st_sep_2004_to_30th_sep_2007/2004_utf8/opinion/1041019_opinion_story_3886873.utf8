 ALL EYES ON THE CARNIVAL

 Whoever is the next president, certain trends in the US will favour India, argues Alok Ray

 On guard

 The presidential election campaign in the United States of America is entering its last stage. What are the major issues being highlighted in the campaign? And what implications do they have for India and the world?

 The television debates amused in that they showed the way the US media hyped up non-issues. Television commentators repeatedly showed clippings from earlier debates to show how voters were swayed. For instance, George W. Bush Sr was seen to look at his watch often while debating against Bill Clinton and Al Gore sighed considerably while debating with Bush Jr. All these, according to commentators, made significant difference to election results.

 Clearly, the most important issue before the American public now is the Iraq war. John Kerry?s position is that the belief that Saddam Hussein had WMDs had made him support the war. Now that he knows better, he wants to bring American soldiers home as early as possible. As a way out, he wants to develop a broader global coalition to take over matters from the Americans in Iraq. He also feels that the pursuit against Osama bin Laden should have been more relentless. The war in Iraq, Kerry believes, diverted American forces from al Qaida. 

 Bush?s attack against Kerry is manifold. First, Kerry supported US intervention in Iraq on the basis of the same intelligence reports that Bush had seen. Kerry is being wiser after the event. Further, the global coalition is not a realistic option any more. Which country is going to join hands with the US after Kerry announces that it is a ?wrong war?? Moreover, even if it is a wrong war (Bush does not concede that) Americans will have to fight it out alone (with a little help from Tony Blair). 

 According to Bush, the US has the right to make a pre-emptive strike anywhere in the world to protect American lives, with or without global support. Kerry, in turn, criticizes Bush?s policy on the ground that Iran and North Korea are far bigger nuclear threats than Saddam. He thinks that Bush should have tried bilateral diplomacy with Korea and Iran. 

 The interesting thing is the inconsistency in the stands of both the candidates. Kerry criticizes Bush for foregoing multilateral efforts in Iraq, but he wants to pursue bilateral diplomacy with Iran and North Korea on the ground that multilateral efforts have not proved fruitful there. Bush, on the other hand, abandoned multilateral action against Iraq but is in favour of multilateralism in North Korea and Iraq.

 Bush argues in favour of his aggressive pre-emptive anti-terrorist actions by citing that no terrorist attack has taken place in the US after 9/11. Kerry writes off this argument by saying that an attack may be in the offing as even terrorists need time to plan. Besides, there has been no significant improvement in intelligence gathering or checking illegal immigration through Mexico, or gun control in the US which allows almost anyone to procure a AK-47. 

 From opinion polls it seems evident that strong pre-emptive strikes a la Bush are still considered a better guarantee for US security than any multilateral global coalition. Most Americans are not concerned about the loss of non-American lives and hence would support even a ?wrong war? if it is in the US?s interest. I was in the US as a PhD student at the height of the Vietnam war. The campuses used to vibrate with protest rallies. No such thing is visible now. Perhaps the reason is that unlike the Vietnam war, this war is being fought with professional US army personnel, with no drafting of civilian students. So the ?morality? of the war is not being debated.

 Apart from the direction taken by the war on global terrorism, the other big concern for India is the debate on outsourcing. Bush is in favour of outsourcing of jobs to countries like India and China as long as American business is gaining. Though Kerry is not opposing outsourcing as such, he thinks that US tax laws give American companies a lot of tax advantages when they move their business and profits abroad. He is in favour of changing tax laws to create a level-playing field so that US labour would not be subsidizing the export of jobs abroad with their tax money. Kerry does not mind if jobs continue to go abroad after that is achieved. Bush thinks that the basic problem is not one of tax laws but lack of skills among American workers. His solution is to improve the quality of school and college education, as also greater access to vocational training courses. 

 Neither Bush nor his critics point out that even if Americans have the necessary skills, jobs will go abroad as long as comparable skills are available abroad at a fraction of US wages. No amount of rhetoric can stop that. 

 The most that US policy can do is prevent the entry of foreign workers by stricter immigration restrictions, but that would reduce the competitiveness of American companies in the US. Eventually it would hurt US jobs as US companies will not be able to sustain competition from cheaper goods and services produced abroad. So, irrespective of who becomes the president and whatever the rhetoric, outsourcing will continue.

 Finally, the debate on how to reduce US medical costs has some implications for Indian drug companies. Kerry is in favour of cheaper import of drugs from Canada. Bush is against this on the plea that ?unsafe? imports from third world countries may find their way through the Canadian route. Bush is trying to protect US drug companies which cannot compete with cheaper imports. 

 Kerry is more with the middle class and poor Americans who cannot afford costly medicines. So if Indian drug companies can set up manufacturing facilities in the US and produce generic drugs at lower costs, specially in collaboration with US drug companies, they would prosper, whoever is the next US president.

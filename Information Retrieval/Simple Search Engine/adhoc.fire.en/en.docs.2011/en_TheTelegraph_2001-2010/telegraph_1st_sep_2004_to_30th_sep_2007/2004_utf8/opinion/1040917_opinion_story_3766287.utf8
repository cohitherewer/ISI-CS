 TALLY HO

 ?The unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible?? was Oscar Wilde?s memorable definition of fox-hunting. Even if one were to ignore Wilde?s description of the gentry as ?the unspeakable??, there is no denying that there is something bizarre about a group of toffs running with their hounds to corner a poor and frightened fox. The argument that fox-hunting is a very old English custom is a spurious one since it is an invented tradition, not more than 200 years old. Moreover, it is not a sport ? if a sport it is ? that is enjoyed by the entire landed gentry. The campaign against fox-hunting has no class label attached to it. It is more a sign of changing concerns of society and the environment, and of new and altered modes of entertainment and leisure. This shift is a reflection of changes within English society engendered by what has come to be known as the Thatcherite revolution. The emergence of the Essex man ? the affluent white collar worker ? reduced the importance of the gentry in English life even more than what the Labour Party had done after World War II. Today the Essex man and his progeny have been won over by the New Labour of Mr Tony Blair. The Conservative Party today is nothing more than a country party, a mere shadow of its Thatcherite incarnation.

 This churning in English society explains the decline of interest in activities like the fox hunt. There has also been an increase in awareness about the environment and about the importance of preserving certain species which are under the threat of extinction. The fox in England is one such specie. The entire notion that human beings should enjoy themselves by harming and killing an animal has come under the shadow of cruelty. The same set of social reasons ? the abolition of landed gentry, princes and zamindars, and a greater concern for the environment ? led to the disappearance of the shikar as entertainment in India. That the pro-fox hunting lobby?s advocacy of tradition is disingenuous is proved by the shameless violation of the sanctity of the House of Commons by some of its members. English society has always been slow to change, gradualism is its byword but this cannot be an alibi for obstinately hanging on to a practice that is neither old nor an integral part of rural life. At an age when the lords themselves are an endangered species, they should perhaps be more sympathetic to the plight of the fox.

 UNEASY ALLIES

 Partners in a coalition are not necessarily natural allies. In fact, some partners in the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre are rivals in state-level politics. Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mr Ram Vilas Paswan may both be ministers in the UPA government, but they are no friends in Bihar. And, with the elections in their home state drawing near, it is not unexpected that their political rivalries will outweigh their partnership in the Union government. But even legitimate political rivalries cannot justify the mutual mud-slinging in which the two leaders engaged in public. It embarrassed the Congress-led government and aided the opposition ? which demanded a statement from the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, on the spat between two of his cabinet colleagues. It is obvious that the compulsions of coalition politics prevent Mr Singh or the UPA chairperson, Ms Sonia Gandhi, from taking the two ministers to task. Mr Yadav and Mr Paswan, who have kept quiet since the opposition?s outcry, did not cover either themselves or the UPA in glory by stooping so low in their zeal to conquer Bihar. 

 It is possible, though, that the rivalry between the two ministers will show up again as the Bihar elections come closer. At the heart of it all is Mr Paswan?s ambition to dethrone Mr Yadav as the uncrowned king of Bihar. Some recent developments in the state?s politics seem to have fuelled this ambition. Mr Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party has carved a niche of its own among the backward communities, many of which had so far been loyal to Mr Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal. By breaking away from the Bharatiya Janata Party, Mr Paswan also hoped to cut into Mr Yadav?s seemingly unassailable control of the Muslim vote. Also, the decline of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance?s fortunes in Bihar has considerably weakened the challenges earlier posed by Janata Dal (United) leaders such as Mr Nitish Kumar and Mr Sharad Yadav to Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav. Mr Paswan, therefore, sees a rare opportunity for himself in the coming polls. The NDA, too, is keen to wean him away from the UPA. But Mr Paswan?s return to the NDA or any deal he might strike with it will definitely alienate Muslim voters from his party. Given their political equations in Bihar, Mr Paswan and Mr Yadav will continue to be uneasy allies in New Delhi.

 Letters to Editor

 Consolation prize

 Sir ? The national awards ? be it for films or sports ? have always been steeped in controversy. Each year, a few disgruntled voices are heard, complaining of favouritism and neglect. The familiar stories were all there when the Arjuna awards were announced this year (?Khel Ratna for Anju, Soma gets Arjuna?, Sept 16). For instance, why was Soma Biswas, a pathetic 24th in heptathlon in Athens, chosen ahead of J.J. Shobha, who came a creditable 11th in the same event, for an Arjuna? There was something rather unusual too: Rajinder Singh, the same person who was sacked 24 days before the Athens Games as the chief coach of the Indian hockey team, was given the Dronacharya award. This is akin to offering bouquets to someone after showering him with brickbats. What about the ignominy Singh had to face just a month back? Can a Dronacharya award be any compensation for that?

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Palit, Calcutta

 Misplaced sympathies

 Sir ? Our security personnel cannot possibly fight terrorists while their hands are tied behind their backs (?Licence to murder?, Sept 14). Why is Ashok V. Desai so perturbed about Gujarat policemen shooting dead two foreign terrorists and their Indian accomplices, and that too only when the forces were fired at? Would it have pleased him if the policemen had got killed instead, like so many of their compatriots, getting killed every day in the hands of terrorists. This reminds me of the killing of two terrorists in a New Delhi shopping mall by the police. It was followed by accusations of a false encounter based on the statement of a well known felon which stood thoroughly discredited later. K.P.S. Gill has his faults, but it must be admitted that he saved the country from disintegration by destroying the most dangerous militancy in a long time to come. About Manipur, the less said the better. The state is the hotbed of so many anti-national and anti-social activities that it is almost impossible to keep track. Freedom of expression is fair enough, but does one have to haul our men in uniform ? fighting and dying in dozens to keep us safe ? over the coals to prove one?s liberal credentials? 

 Yours faithfully,

P. Gupta, Guwahati

 Sir ? Ashok V. Desai does not take into account the trials and tribulations that Indian soldiers have been through since Independence. I don?t know how many of our serious academicians manage to interact, or are even interested in interacting with the ground realities. Instead of condemning the soldiers, it would be more appropriate to criticize the blatant politicization of institutions like the army. Why do our intellectuals fail to rise above their ideologies? Or how could the author miss the growing incidents of attacks on the soldiers deployed in Kashmir and other terror-ridden parts of the country? 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Mind your language

 Sir ? Words such as ?shikhandi? (transvestite), ?paltu? (lapdog), ?dalal? (broker), ?piyakkad? (drunkard), ?fakkad? (bankrupt) and so on belong to the lexicon of the less educated (?No f-word yet, just shikhandi to begin with?, Sept 11). Respectable persons would use more refined synonyms of the same words. That is why it is hard to believe that the word, shikhandi, was used by the former finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, and that too to describe the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. Even Kalyan Singh, the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, called Singh a paltu. Given that they are prominent public figures of the country, Singh and Sinha must learn to exercise greater control over their tongue. No wonder our politicians and political system have became a laughing stock all over the world.

 Yours faithfully,

Daliya Daspurkayastha, Silchar

 Sir ? Yashwant Sinha was in a panel discussion on television the night Manmohan Singh presented his first budget in 1991. In that discussion, while Singh was explaining the grim situation India then faced, Sinha cut in to say that as the erstwhile finance minister (in the mercifully short-lived Chandra Shekhar cabinet), he did not consider the situation as grave. Singh said firmly that it was only because Sinha was sleeping! 

 As born-again finance minister in the Vajpayee government, Sinha is guilty of manipulating statistical data to make India ?shine? when in reality, it did not. Now he, along with his party leaders, is attacking Singh in the most indecent manner, little realizing that their efforts will prove counter-productive.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Narasimhan, Bangalore

 Sir ? It is not correct to translate ?shikhandi? as transvestite. As far as I know, shikhandi means an effeminate man/warrior. Again, the word ?effeminate? means womanish, unmanly, weak. To translate shikhandi as transvestite, which means a man deriving particular sexual pleasure from dressing in women?s clothes, is wrong. An effeminate person should not be confused with a transvestite.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

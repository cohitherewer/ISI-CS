 THE HUMAN TOUCH

Culture and Public Action 

Edited by Vijayendra Rao and Michael Walton, 

Permanent Black, Rs 395

Culture has for long been seen as something primordial 

or mystical, or as a source of hegemony. But these views have not proved useful 

as a guide to public action. The essays in this volume underline the role of social 

and cultural factors in shaping human behaviour, and the need to study them along 

with economic and political theories. 

 Sociologists, anthropologists and historians often complain about how economists pay little attention to culture in the development process. A. Sen, in his essay, feels that the neglect must be remedied. For Sen, the question is not whether culture matters, but ?how? it matters. For most economists, the goal of development is to maximize material well-being. But Sen interprets well-being in terms of a person?s ?capabilities? ? the potential to convert entitlements over goods and services into a range of ?functionings?. The translation of potential into functionings is a product of active choice by the individual as an agent. However, the effectiveness of the agency depends on a broad context, which includes social and cultural institutions.

 A. Klamer builds on Sen?s point that culture is an end in itself and that it has the ability to inspire, express and symbolize collective memory and identity. 

 M. Douglas argues that most societies can be sorted according to their mix of sub-cultures, and that the interaction and co-existence of subcultures are a useful way to understand the ?joint production of meaning? in a society. 

 A. Appadurai?s essay focuses on the adverse terms in which the poor negotiate the ?norms that frame their social lives?. He suggests that there is a need to strengthen the capacity of the poor to exercise their ?voice?. After all, development is all about empowering the poor.

 Two case studies illustrate the relevance of culture in public action. In the first, S. Harragin shows how the failure to heed notions of kinship in the social structure and a misreading of the responses to aid as corruption, caused relief workers to miss early signs of a famine in south Sudan and thus prevent it. In the second study, a medical team headed by S. Jana succeeded in containing the spread of HIV-AIDS among sex-workers in Sonagachi by treating them with respect and by understanding their subculture and the power structure that dominates it. According to C. Jenkins, recognizing the internal cultural logic of high-risk groups is the right approach in policy intervention.

 The book does not resolve all debates but deepens our understanding of the role of culture in public action. The essays will interest students of culture and development studies, and policy implementation.

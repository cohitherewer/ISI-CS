 TRACES OF A GREAT PAST

MASTERPIECES OF INDIAN ART (Roli, Rs 1,975) 

collected by Alka Pande is another reminder of the wonder that was India. There?s 

a touch of irony though. Most of the sculptures, miniatures and textiles presented 

here are no longer in India. They have been painstakingly assembled from galleries 

and museums all over the world, but mostly from Britain, America and Europe. Pande 

pleads that the selection is ?subjective? and may not conform with the more popular 

list of ?masterpieces?. The regulars are there, however, like the Ajanta-Ellora 

paintings and the Chola sculptures. This 18th-century miniature, Chira haran, 

has also been seen before. There are also rare ones like the 11th-century map 

shawl from Kashmir and the miniature depicting the killing of Adham Khan. But 

in all, another addition to the innumerable coffee-tablers on Indian art.

 FILL IN THE BLANK

 A political vacuum tends to become the anarchist?s workshop. The Maoist menace in Nepal has long been a case in point. It should, therefore, be welcome news that Nepal?s prime minister, Mr Sher Bahadur Deuba, plans to hold elections to the country?s parliament in April. His announcement to this effect will go a long way to end the current political impasse, which has helped the Maoists? destructive designs. One would recall, however, that Mr Deuba was appointed interim prime minister by King Gyanendra for the specific task of conducting the polls. It is another matter that most of the political parties questioned the legitimacy of his appointment, which came in the wake of the king dissolving the earlier parliament. Mr Deuba can redeem his position only by keeping his commitment to the polls and handing over power to an elected prime minister. Notwithstanding his move to reopen the peace talks with the Maoists, he cannot afford to allow the rebels to stall, or interfere with, the polls. Recent political developments in Nepal have harmed the cause of its fledgling democracy and made the people wary of the king?s motives. Any further delay in re-starting the political process will cause more public discontent and thereby help the Maoists. 

 But the success of Mr Deuba?s plan to hold the elections will depend largely on whether he can take the parties along with him. And, it is important that he earns the confidence of not only the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), but also the Nepali Congress. The CPN(UML) joined his government, responding to his call to make it an all-party government, while the Nepali Congress declined the offer. It is up to Mr Deuba to persuade the parties that he would conduct the polls in a non-partisan manner. What his government does in the next few months will decide how the parties will respond to his moves. Obviously, it is no longer relevant for the parties to reiterate their demand for the restoration of the dissolved parliament. Even if they continue to question the legitimacy of Mr Deuba?s regime, the elections clearly are the only road ahead. An elected government will have a greater legitimacy even in dealing with the Maoists. The important thing is to fill up the current political vacuum.

 SINGING THE WRONG TUNE

 Politics has a tendency to overwhelm values and integrity. Think of the young Rajiv Gandhi when he became prime minister. He was fresh, totally uncontaminated by the unseemly side of politics and eager to break from the stereotype of the Indian politician. Very soon, within a few months into his prime ministership, the image of the clean prime minister had evaporated and Rajiv Gandhi appeared to be no better or no worse than other Congress leaders. The system had overwhelmed the individual. A similar process seems to be at work with the present prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh. Mr Singh?s distinction is that for over three decades he has walked the corridors of power, as bureaucrat and as minister, but has escaped the taint of being a politician. He has been in politics but has never been of it. Unlike others in politics, Mr Singh has come across always as sincere, outspoken without being abrasive and as a man whose integrity has been above reproach and suspicion. He has also been unique in Indian politics in that he has refused to compromise his high standards for political gains. He has been in the political life of the country but has not descended to the level of playing at politics.

 There are signs though that this image of the prime minister is poised for a change. Mr Singh went out of his way recently to advocate reservations in the private sector. According to him, reservations are a way of demonstrating the private sector?s social responsibility. This, to say the least, is a trifle surprising, coming from one of the major proponents of the free market and competition in India. One would have expected Mr Singh to argue that jobs should be available only on the basis of merit. Similarly, Mr Singh spoke against an ?uncritical endorsement of the hire-and-fire approach? even while he stressed the need for flexibility in labour markets. It is clear that Mr Singh has begun to speak like an election manifesto. Mr Singh, the advocate of the free market, and Mr Singh who is pro-reservation and anti-hire-and-fire cannot obviously be the same person. The apparent contradiction raises a big question mark about Mr Singh?s sincerity, one of his principal assets.

 Mr Singh has undeniable political compulsions. He heads a coalition government supported by left parties, which are pushing him to be more and more populist. Mr Singh thus faces the real test of a leader. He has to speak up for what he really believes to be the best for India?s future. He must speak up for that even if his views are not popular and are not amenable to populism and the garnering of votes. Given his track record of unimpeachable integrity and uncompromising sincerity, Mr Singh must say what he believes to be right even if that makes him unpopular with the left. Otherwise, Mr Singh will become indistinguishable from others who are in politics. That will be a consummation not to be wished for in Indian public life.

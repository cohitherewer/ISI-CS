 DONKEY WORK

 Three hundred donkeys and 5,000 mobile phones. These were the essentials, together with Russian jeeps, helicopters and a cargo plane, that the UN had to organize for the Afghan elections. Although the official counting starts today, some ballot-boxes are still on their way down from the Hindu Kush on donkey-back. There are also the 114,000 polling staff, mostly locals, and no independent monitors willing to brave the risks. The whole thing would cost the UN around ?111 million. Critics who think that the elections were premature and just an American propaganda exercise feel that this sum should have been spent on health and education instead. Yet, the fact remains that elections have happened in this epically rugged, ravaged and unruly terrain. About 90 per cent of a registered electorate of 10.5 million have voted, although there are no official turnout figures. Forty per cent of these voters are women. The threatened boycott of most of Mr Hamid Karzai?s rival candidates seems to have been successfully averted too, and the violence threatened by the taliban, in their dread ?night-letters? put up everywhere, has not been inordinate so far. Afghanistan has not held any form of election since the late Sixties, and has never directly chosen any leader. So it would be well to put cynicism aside and see this as some sort of a triumph ? of something that looks like democracy. For a nation without any democratic infrastructure, and impoverished by invasions, warlords, insurgents and opium, this is a milestone in the progress towards modernity.

 The exit poll augurs well too. Mr Karzai, a Pashtun Afghan face that the international community likes to see, could be heading for a landslide victory. This exit poll was conducted by a Washington-based think-tank, associated with President Bush?s own party. So the stakes do not lie simply in the establishment of democracy in Afghanistan. If the United States of America, its allies, the UN and the Nato manage to see the show through, including the parliamentary elections in April, then there might be hope for Iraq. This, in turn, would bode well for Messrs Bush and Blair with regard to their respective electorates. Meanwhile, the phones and donkeys will have to work very hard indeed to keep candidates like General Abdul Rashid Dostum convinced that being a democrat is a nicer option than being a communist or a mujahedin or a warlord, since he has actually been all three in the past.

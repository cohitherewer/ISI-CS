 NEW ALLY

 The visit to India by Myanmar?s top military leader, Mr Than Shwe, is significant for a variety of reasons. Although the visit may dishearten supporters of Myanmar?s pro-democracy leader, Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, it is clearly in New Delhi?s interest to engage with the military junta in Yangon. The benefits of the visit are already visible. India and Myanmar have signed a framework agreement aimed at denying sanctuary to anti-India militant groups operating out of Myanmar. Under the understanding, both countries have committed themselves to further promoting cooperation against terrorists. This also includes cooperation against arms smuggling, money laundering, drug trafficking, organized crime, international economic crime and cyber crime. Myanmar?s territory has been used repeatedly by insurgent groups in the North-east as a base to mount operations against Indian security forces. This has continued over the past decades, particularly during the years that India had refused to have any truck with the military regime. 

 Given Myanmar?s latest commitment to cooperate, militant groups will find it difficult to sustain their presence in the country. This alone should make it worthwhile to maintain good relations with Yangon. India has also to ensure that China does not make further inroads into Myanmar. In recent years, Beijing has carefully cultivated the military regime and there were reports, in the last few years, that China may be allowed by Yangon to construct a naval facility in the Myanmar country-region. Clearly, this facility could be used to monitor Indian naval movements and to contain the Indian presence in the Indian Ocean. By engaging the military regime in dialogue and cooperation, it may become possible to limit Chinese designs and influence in Myanmar. In addition, Myanmar is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations and India?s gateway to south-east Asia. There has been an increase in bilateral trade, but clearly there is much more that can be done. Constructive engagement with Myanmar is in India?s interests. However, the cultivation of India?s self-interests has to proceed gingerly since India cannot be seen as a supporter of a military junta. Engagement should not become advocacy.

 GUDIYA?S CHOICE

 Arif or Taufiq? Does Gudiya really have the power to choose in this bizarre problem play of one woman, two husbands and an unborn child? She does not, and she never did. And this absolute erasure of agency, or even of personhood, at the heart of her two ? perhaps three ? marriages is what this episode in rural Haryana and Uttar Pradesh brings out in its starkest form. The erasures are multiple. Not only is the question of Gudiya?s choice occluded, but her second, and now former, husband Taufiq, suddenly deprived of both wife and offspring, is also a strangely absent and silent figure. His powerlessness is radical, perhaps even more so than Gudiya?s. And the unborn child, illegitimized by law, embodies the very opposite of personhood, its fate rendered uncertain at every level by forces entirely external to its imminent existence as a human being.

 To what, then, are so many human agencies subordinated in this situation? The woman and men have called it kismet, but as a network of determining powers and pressures, nothing could be less metaphysical. First, there is the sharia as invoked by Gudiya?s family, and interpreted and used by the clerics and panchayat members of her village ? first, to invalidate her second marriage to Taufiq, second, to re-validate her first marriage to Arif, and third, to define the conditions of the child?s paternity. ?I am not above the sharia,? Gudiya has declared. Then, there is the larger system of male proprietorship of the woman, as claimed by Gudiya?s first husband, Arif, in terms of his and his local community?s izzat as a man and war-hero. He was the only man in his village to ride to his wedding on an elephant, and must therefore win his private Kargil War. Finally, there is the power of money. Taufiq is much poorer than Arif, who, as an army man, will soon be flush with arrears and compensation.

 Within this pre-modern grid of powers and interests, what is the role of Gudiya?s subjectivity, her own wishes and desires, and of that entire vocabulary of love, choice and privacy associated with modern companionate marriage? Perhaps the only way she could have made, and she does make, her own voice heard is by asserting her motherhood, invoking a primordial, supra-legal bond with the child she is carrying in her body, her raison d??tre: ?Where I go, the child goes with me.? And in this, she seems to have made Arif listen to her and let her keep the child, although Taufiq might legally claim it back from her when it grows up. 

 So when Gudiya comes on television to play out her crucial moment of decision, she uses the language that the media would most like to hear. Yet, in the story of kismet versus pyaar that she is made to enact in public, it is only Arif?s ?love? that seems to matter. It is when Gudiya is made most visible that she is most absent.

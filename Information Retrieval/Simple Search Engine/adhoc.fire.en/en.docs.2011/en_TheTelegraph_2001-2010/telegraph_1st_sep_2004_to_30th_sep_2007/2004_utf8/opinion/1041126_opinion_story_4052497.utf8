 Paperback Pickings

 Skate wings with capers and parsley

Scandal takes a holiday (Century, ? 6.60) 

by Lindsey Davis is another one of this prolific author?s humorous crime 

romps in a solemnly detailed classical setting, complete with Homeric epigraph, 

a two-page dramatis personae, complicated family tree, map and note on 

topography. In the wealthy town of Ostia, in 76 AD, Marcus Didius Falco appears 

to be enjoying a holiday. But when his girlfriend, Helena, arrives carrying a 

batch of old copies of the Daily Gazette ? with the intention of catching 

up on the latest scandal ? Falco is forced to admit to Petronius his real reasons 

for being there. ?Infamia?, the pen name of the scribe who writes the gossip column 

for the DG, has gone missing, and Falco has been entrusted with bringing 

him back from his lazy, drunken truancy. Before long, Falco?s enquiries lead him 

into the world of piracy. Why would pirates have taken Infamia? And if they have, 

will he be found alive?

Cloudstreet (Penguin, Rs 395) by 

Tim Winton has been marketed in India as part of the Modern Australian Classic 

series and is an epic portrayal of post-war working-class Australians. Two rural 

families flee from separate catastrophes to the city and find themselves sharing 

a great breathing, shuddering joint called Cloudstreet, where they begin their 

lives again from scratch. ?You can see that figure teetering out over the water, 

looking into your face, and you can see the crowd up on the treethick bank behind 

him finishing this momentous day off and getting ready to wonder where he is. 

And you can?t help but worry for them, love them, want for them ? those who go 

on down the close, foetid galleries of time and space without you.?

Keywords: gender (Vistaar, Rs 195) edited 

by Nadia Tazi collects six perspectives on gender from six disciplines and 

six regions of the world: Africa, America, the Arab world, China, Europe and India. 

The Keywords project ? born of a ?propitious encounter? between a Chinese, an 

American and a French publisher ? ?offers fundamental notions from different cultural 

points of view, taking a hard look at a common object with a view from afar?. 

It therefore aims to produce ?an intercultural dialogue and an exploration of 

globalization with, as point of departure, local points of view on essential themes 

such as experience, gender, identity, nature and truth.?

 Dawn (Zubaan, Rs 295) by Arupa Kalita Patangia is Ranjita Biswas?s translation of a contemporary Assamese novel. Set in a small town in Assam before Independence, this is the story of the headstrong Binapani whose only support is her grandmother, Jashodha. Binapani is married to a much older man whom she has always disliked. Drudgery and children follow, and just when she is about to give up on joy, a chance encounter with an old friend brings change.

French leave (Ebury, ?4.55) by John Burton Race is a memoir of Michelin-two-star chef?s year (?of escape and discovery?) in a rural farmhouse in south-west France with his wife, six children and pet Labrador. He discovers a way of life rooted in simple, timeless pleasures ? visits to the local market, fishing in the Black Mountain and exploring the neighbouring towns and villages. There are also wonderful, impossible recipes: roasted skate wings with capers and parsley, calf?s kidneys with Montpellier butter, cauliflower soup with truffle oil, shad grilled in anchovy butter, zander in a herb Beurre Blanc, partridge with a white wine sauce, pot-roasted pork with thyme-flavoured beans.

 DIARY

 Ghulam Nabi Azad takes his duties as Union parliamentary affairs minister very seriously indeed. And, evidently, he doesn?t think his work is limited to ensuring everything goes smoothly on the floor of the house. The physical and mental well-being of his charges also concern him. So his ministry has decided to organize some ?sports and cultural activities? on the weekends for MPs to ?relieve the stresses and strains of Parliamentary debates?. Azad has also discovered a higher purpose: inculcating sportsmanship to ?make the parliament function in the true democratic tradition?. A letter has been dispatched to all parliamentarians telling them about the minister?s proposal. The letter also asks MPs to chose at least three events ?in which you would like to take part...on the basis of aptitude and interest?. The choice ? golf, tennis, squash, badminton, table tennis, cricket, swimming, quick-step walk, tug of war, opening of knot, lemon in spoon race, one-hand roll the ball, musical chairs, ball in the bucket, three-legged race, passing the ball, sack race, hitting the post with hockey stick, rolling the wheels, lawn bowling, kho kho, kabaddi, dart board and shooting. Azad, it seems, has something for everyone ? male and female, old and young, strong and feeble. It just remains for our legislators to put on their running togs and take the greens for some fun and games. 

 Politics is a great leveller. Once, not too long ago, Sharad Pawar was giving speeches against Sonia Gandhi, accusing her of being a videshi pretender to the PM?s chair. And there he was on December 9, joining the hordes making their way to 10 Janpath to greet Sonia on her birthday. Pawar might have justifiably felt that he was sealing a bond of friendship with the Congress president. He might also have justifiably felt that he had earned a return greeting on his own birthday, three days later. So Pawar stayed parked at his residence all morning. Finally, at around 12.30 pm when the lady still hadn?t arrived, he left for work. Sonia tried to make amends by attending the party Praful Patel hosted for Pawar in the evening, and wished him a long life. Pawar continued to sulk at first, but his mood improved as the evening wore on, at least, where it was directed at Sonia. His ire now turned on Manmohan Singh. Quite inexplicably, for the soft-spoken PM had come up to greet him. Perhaps it was safer to re-direct his anger at the good doctor.

 Why was Uma Bharti expelled after her short brush with reality TV, and not Smriti Irani? That?s the question BJP-watchers are asking everywhere. The answer, it seems, lies in the Advani household. Both LK and his wife, Kamala, are supposedly great fans of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, especially Tulsi Virani. Apparently, it was at the Advani?s initiative that Smriti was approached by Pramod Mahajan with an offer to join the BJP. The party president also surprised everyone by inducting Smriti in the national executive. Advani is not to be blamed too much. His confusion between reel and real is one many Indians share.

 Now that India is no longer Shining over the BJP, every politician worth his weight in votes is making a beeline for the Congress. The rumour mills are agog with names ? big and small ? who are waiting to join the party leading the UPA. Smriti Irani, Arif Mohammad Khan, Najma Heptullah, Sunil Shastri, PA Sangma, and closer home, Mamata Banerjee and Subrata Mukherjee. While it?s a huge compliment for the Congress, Sonia Gandhi had better be careful about these migratory birds. They didn?t bring the BJP any luck.

 Since the ?kursi? is what they live and spend a good part of their lives fighting for, seating arrangements in parliament are a touchy issue. Especially, in this Lok Sabha, which has more leaders than followers. Thus it was that for the six months now, the government and the opposition were locked in a duel about where to sit Chandra Shekhar and HD Deve Gowda. The NDA could not find front-row seats for its own stalwarts, so it expressed its inability to accommodate them. AB Vajpayee, LK Advani, VK Malhotra, Kalyan Singh and Anant Kumar occupy the six-seater facing the treasury benches. The two seats in the next block, vacated by Somnath Chatterjee and Mulayam Singh Yadav, have been given to George Fernandes and Anant Geete of the Shiv Sena. And so it fell to the UPA to find space from its own quota for the two ex-PMs. All?s well that ends well, but let?s hope the TV cameras don?t find Deve Gowda snoozing on the front rows.

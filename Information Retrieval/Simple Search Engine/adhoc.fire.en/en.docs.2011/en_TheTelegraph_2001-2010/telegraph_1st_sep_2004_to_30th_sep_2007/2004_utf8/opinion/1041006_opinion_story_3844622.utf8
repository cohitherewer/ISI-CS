 FALL OF A FORUM

 Every politician goes through a lean season. That is, however, no reason to write him off, especially if that politician has been as resourceful as the former speaker of the Lok Sabha, Mr Purno A. Sangma. But the collapse of Mr Sangma?s Northeast People?s Forum barely a year after its inception is a different story. One could, of course, argue that the forum never had much of a chance as a viable political formation. Although Mr Sangma projected it as a common platform for all anti-Congress parties, it never really became any such thing. It was more Mr Sangma?s personal platform than anything else, and its anti-Congress plank was little more than his personal grudge against Ms Sonia Gandhi. Its appeal to even the anti-Congress parties in the region proved limited once the Asom Gana Parishad refused to join it. Mr Sangma?s importance too was largely diminished after Mr Sharad Pawar parted ways with him and took away most of the Nationalist Congress Party with him. In fact, the founding of the forum was a measure of Mr Sangma?s diminution in national politics ? he was back to his local politics. The demise of the front shows that he has failed to find his feet even there.

 However, there is a larger story in the forum?s fall than just Mr Sangma?s failure. It reflects the failure of the Bharatiya Janata Party to hold on to its allies in the North-east after its fall from power in New Delhi. Although the forum came into being primarily at Mr Sangma?s initiative, the BJP, as the biggest anti-Congress force, was its life-blood. For a party which never had much of a presence in the region, the BJP sought to cynically use the forum for its own gains, often at the cost of its allies. No wonder, therefore, that the chief minister of Nagaland, Mr Neiphiu Rio, who was the forum?s chairperson, has blamed the BJP for the outfit?s disintegration. Considering the fact that the BJP is a partner in Mr Rio?s coalition ministry, his remark is an unambiguous condemnation of the BJP?s abuse of the coalition dharma. But the BJP?s overreaching ambition in the North-east had earlier prompted it to break its alliance with the AGP in Assam. Its result was bad for the AGP, but much worse for the BJP in the last assembly elections in the state. Ironically for a party that once boasted of its success in coalition politics, the forum?s brief history has shown the BJP in a poor light in the North-east.

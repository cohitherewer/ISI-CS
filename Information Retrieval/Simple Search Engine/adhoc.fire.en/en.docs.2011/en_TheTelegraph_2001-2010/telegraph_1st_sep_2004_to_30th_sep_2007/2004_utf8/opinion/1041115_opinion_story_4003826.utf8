 TURN IT DOWN

 Making a nasty din is remarkably easy. And it is just as difficult to discipline man-made noise with the fear of punishment. The problem reaches a kind of peak during Kali puja and Diwali, when aural damage is taken to be divinely licensed. Over the last few years, legislation regarding optimal decibel levels during festivities, from fire-crackers and loudspeakers, had achieved a genuine control over noise pollution during the pujas. This is a two-way process, depending as much on general civic awareness as on effective enforcement. But this year, the situation in greater Calcutta has worsened again. A record number of banned fire-crackers have been used in the last few days, and the number of complaints against noise has also been unusually high. Environmental activists as well as the Pollution Control Board have both blamed the administration for failing to enforce the noise rules set by the judiciary and the Central government. The problem can be tackled at a very basic level. Even before the noise is actually made, it ought to be possible to suppress the manufacture and sale of the banned fire-crackers, most of which are still sold in the open market.

 Calcutta is supposed to be the most damagingly noisy Indian city. Its noise culture does not remain confined to festivities, and is a daily phenomenon resulting from a combination of callousness and ignorance. The fact of noise pollution is still not realized by most citizens, perhaps because they have taught themselves to cope with other, more obviously harmful, forms of pollution in their daily lives. Traffic noise, horns, loudspeakers in metro-stations, shops (including bookshops) and the presence of loud music just about everywhere have banished most forms of peacefulness from the experience of the city. This has also bred a culture of inconsideration and sheer bad manners, actively fostered by such things as mobile phones and car-jingles or stereos. In this context of nerve-wracking ostentation, the flouting of the noise laws is not surprising.

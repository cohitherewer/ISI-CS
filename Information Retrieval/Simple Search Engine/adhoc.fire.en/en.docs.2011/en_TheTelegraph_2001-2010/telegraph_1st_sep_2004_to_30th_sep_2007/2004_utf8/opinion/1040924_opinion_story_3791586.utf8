 OF HUMBUGS AND HYPOCRITES

PARADISE AND OTHER STORIES 

By Khushwant Singh, 

Viking, Rs 295

This collection of short stories by Khushwant Singh, 

the enfant terrible, carries through a specific and explicit agenda ? that 

of lashing out at some of the customs and beliefs couched in Hindu, Brahminic 

and Sikh cults. Singh ridicules astrology with its regulation appendage of palmistry, 

numerology, gemology and the like. He also comes down heavily on the ?exaggerated 

piety? of the Indian way of life, epitomized by the either pretentious or puerile 

Indian sex life. As the author?s note informs, Singh?s impatience with the fact 

that ?India steadily declined to become a nation of humbugs and hypocrites? prompted 

him to pen these stories.

 What Singh seemingly misses out is that the so-called irrationalities and inconsistencies are almost invariably the distinguishing attributes of the histories of the once-colonized nations like India. The ?nation? Singh narrativizes in this collection is less an outcome of degeneration (as supposed by Singh) than a product of a somewhat disruptive continuation of conflicting and non-coeval trends. Singh refuses to recognize that Indians have learnt to live with contradictions from their colonial experiences. 

 The stories, however, come through as mock parables, woven round some implicit morals, and linked to mores of Indian sexuality. In the first story, ?Paradise?, the protagonist, Margaret Bloom ? who arrives at Baikunth Dhaam in Haridwar from New York seeking spiritual solace ? discovers in disappointment that suppressed and depraved sexuality is part and parcel of the ?sacred? Indian life. ?Life?s Horoscope? is a hilarious account of a Brahmin youth who models his sex life on the prescriptions of Vatsayana?s Kamasutra ? which to him is an inviolable sex manual.

 ?Zora Singh? focusses on a lecherous and scheming engineer cum parliamentarian, who is awarded the Bharat Ratna. ?Wanted: A Son? is the story of a Sikh housewife giving birth to an illegitimate son and how this is na?vely interpreted as an act of divine benediction by her unsuspecting in-laws. Strikingly different in tone and temperament is ?The Mulberry Tree?, which delineates a loner?s unflagging emotional attachment to tree, only interrupted briefly by his infatuation with a woman called Karuna.

 His street-smart and vitriolic prose notwithstanding, Singh is not at his introspective best in this collection of stories. The parables read like patched-up fragments from an author?s notebook and the morals suggested are largely superficial. No wonder that, by way of an acknowledgement, Singh, rather unwittingly gives away his concern for the ?readability? of his own stories.

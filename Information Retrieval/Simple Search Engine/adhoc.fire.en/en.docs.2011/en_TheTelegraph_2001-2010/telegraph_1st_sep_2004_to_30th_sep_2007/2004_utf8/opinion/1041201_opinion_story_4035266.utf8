 IN SEARCH OF A CREATIVE ALTERNATIVE

 Terra Madre celebrated an honest agriculture that does not lie about prices and does not exploit the earth or its caretakers, writes Vandana Shiva

 In a world dominated by fear and fragmentation, dispensability and despair, a magical gathering of food communities ? Terra Madre ? took place in Turin, Italy, from October 20-22, 2004. Slow Food ? the movement that has put the culture of growing and eating good, healthy and diverse food at the heart of social, political and economic transformation ? had brought together 5,000 members from 1,200 food communities in 130 countries under one roof. And in spite of their diversity and differences, everyone was connected ? through the earth, food, the common web of life and common humanity ? to each other.

 Over the past decades, food production, processing and distribution have shifted out of the hands of women, small farmers and producers and are being monopolized by global corporate giants like Cargill, Monsanto, Phillip Morris and Nestle. Small producers everywhere are being displaced by the unfair competition from heavily subsidized agribusiness. The anti-globalization movement has focused on the unfairness of global trade rules that are pushing farmers into debt and suicide. At Terra Madre, small producers gathered not just to curse corporate globalization but also to keep alive small decentralized biodiversity production that does not put a burden on the earth for food.

 The vibrant energy of Terra Madre came from the resilience of producers who have continued to save and share their diverse seeds, live their diverse cultures, speak their diverse languages and celebrate their diverse food traditions. There were a community of dried mango producers and the entomophagous women (women?s associations who harvest, process and sell edible insects) of Ouagadougou, the Baobab community of Atacora, basil growers and pesto genovese, makers of Liguria, nomadic shepherds from India and Kirgbity sheep breeders from central Asia, jasmine rice producers of Thailand and Basmati rice producers of India.

 The world of Terra Madre reflected the real world of people. This was not the world of the World Trade Organisation, which can only think of agri-business, which allows only five commodities (soya, corn, rice, wheat, canola) to account for most of the agricultural trade, only one company to account for 94 per cent of all genetically-modified seeds planted anywhere in the world, and most of the food grown to be eaten not by humans but by billions of captive animals in factory farms. In Terra Madre?s world, small farms produce more than industrial farms, using fewer resources; biodiversity protects the health of the soil; and the health of people, quality, taste, nutrition are the criteria for production and processing.

 Terra Madre was a gathering of small producers who refuse to disappear in a world where globalization has written off diversity of species and cultures, local economies and indigenous knowledge. Not only are small farmers and local food communities refusing to go away, they are determined to shape a future beyond globalization. As Granny Almanac, the Italian minister of agriculture and forestry stated in his introduction to ?Terra Madre?: ?What is original and truly revolutionary about Terra Madre is that by selecting the food communities least susceptible to industrial process ? hence distinctive for the authenticity and quality of their produce ? it attempts to place small-scale food producers at centrestage.... Diversity is the ground for the turnaround of our food systems...Diversity is both the resistance to monocultures and the creative alternative.?

 Terra Madre provided an opportunity and platform to articulate another paradigm of food. During the opening ceremony, Carlo Petrini, the founder of Slow Food, gave a call to everyone to defend the rights, knowledge and creativity of small producers all over the world. ?Let us become co-producers?, he said. ?To consume means to destroy... ?Consumption? was the name earlier given to tuberculosis... In the act of eating, we have already participated in production. By eating organic, we have said ?no? to toxics, and supported the organic farmer. By rejecting GMOs, we vote for the rights of small farmers and people?s right to information and health. By eating local, we have taken power and profits away from global agribusiness, and strengthened our local food community. Eaters are therefore also co-producers?.

 The industrialization and globalization of our food systems divide us, North-South, producer-consumer, rich-poor. The most significant source of our separation and division is the myth that industrial food systems produce more food and hence are necessary for removing hunger. However, small, biodiverse organic farms have higher output than large industrial monocultures.

 Prince Charles reminded the gathering during the closing ceremony that one of the arguments used by the ?agricultural industrialists? is that it is only through intensification that we will be able to feed an expanded world population. But even without significant investment, improved organic practices have increased yields and outputs dramatically. A recent United Nations-Food and Agricultural Organisation study revealed that in Bolivia, potato yield went up from 4 to 15 tonnes per hectare. In Cuba, the vegetable yields of organic urban gardens almost doubled. In famine-ravaged Ethiopia, sweet potato yields went up from 6 to 30 tons per hectare. In Kenya, maize yields increased from 2.25 to 9 tons per hectare. And in Pakistan, mango yields have gone up from 7.5 to 22 tons per hectare. 

 In the inaugural ceremony, I had drawn attention to the fact that globalized industrialized food is not cheap, it is too costly for the earth, for the farmers, for our health. The earth can no longer carry the burden of ground water mining, pesticide pollution, disappearance of species and destabilization of the climate. Farmers can no longer carry the burden of debt, which is inevitable in industrial farming. Suicide by 25,000 farmers in India in a short span of 6 years is a symptom of the deep crisis in the dominant model of farming and food production. This system is denying the right of food and health both to the billions who are hungry and the billions who suffer from obesity. It is incapable of producing safe, culturally appropriate, tasty, quality food. And it is incapable of producing enough food for all because it wastes land water and energy. It uses ten times more energy than it produces, ten times more water then ecological agriculture. It is thus ten times less efficient. 

 Even the labour efficiency is a myth since all researchers, pesticide producers, genetic engineers, truck drivers, soldiers engaged in wars over oil, are part of the industrial food production system. If all the people involved in non-sustainable food production were counted, the ?labour? efficiency of industrial food would also be lower than ecological food. When agriculture becomes like war, fertilizers and pesticides that have their origins in wars replace internal farm inputs, food becomes non-food. Trade based on false prices, and unfair exchange is not trade, it is exploitation. That is why I proposed at Terra Madre that the agreement on agriculture in the WTO should be renamed as agreement on non-trade in non-food.

 The fact that industrial food is cheap is not because it is efficient. It is ?cheap? because it externalizes all costs ? the wars, the diseases, the environmental destruction, the cultural decay, the social disintegration. And it is supported by subsidies ? $400 billion in rich countries ? by transport subsidies, by environmental subsidies and the largest subsidy that is paid through people?s lives.

 For us, Terra Madre was a celebration of an honest agriculture in which prices do not lie, which does not exploit the earth and the earth?s caretakers. Terra Madre was a celebration of our practice of living economies in which we co-produce with the earthworm and the spider, with the mychorizzae and the fungi. We are all connected in the web of life, and its food that spins that web. As the ancient Taittiriya Upanishad has stated: 

 ?From food, all creatures are produced...

 Beings are born from food, when born they live by food, on being deceased, they enter into food.?

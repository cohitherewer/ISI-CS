 LEFT MANOEUVRE

 Mr Manmohan Singh has held on to the baby but has thrown out the bathwater as well as the bathtub that held the water. He has dissolved all the consultative committees of the Planning Commission and has thus resolved the controversy created about consultants belonging to foreign agencies. The controversy was created by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and a group of economists owing allegiance to it. These economists refused to serve on a panel which had members drawn from the World Bank and other foreign agencies. There is no need to reiterate the absurdity of this protest by the left economists. What needs to be noted is the manner in which the prime minister has neatly side-stepped the leftists. This was not a move that the left had quite expected. They were content that they had put Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission ? ?a World Bank man?, according to the nonagenarian Mr Jyoti Basu who, of course, has never had any person contaminated by the World Bank anywhere near him when he was chief minister of West Bengal ? under severe pressure. The left?s efforts at petty blackmail are at an end, for the nonce only.

 The qualification, ?for the nonce only?, is used advisedly since the left?s options in the present political conjuncture are seriously limited. If the Congress is critically dependent on the left for the survival of the United Progressive Alliance, the left too has compulsions to continue with its support. The left cannot afford to let the UPA fall, as this would enable the Bharatiya Janata Party to romp home to power once again. This continuing support to the UPA cannot possibly come easily to the left since there are many policies of Mr Singh?s government which the left cannot openly accept and endorse. To its own constituency, however small that might be outside West Bengal, the left has to show that it does not accept such policies. Hence the emphasis in public pronouncements and posturings of the left leaders that they are setting the terms for the UPA, that they are prone to bite and not just bark, and the apparent tendency to exert pressure on the UPA on matters that are relatively minor.

 These shows of protest are important for the left for through them they speak to their constituency and demonstrate that left policies have not changed. The left has changed, and changed radically ? Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his policies in West Bengal are examples of the change ? but it has to show its followers that it hasn?t. It is not easy to do an ideological turnaround while pretending that it isn?t doing one. The left is in the midst of such a manoeuvre and is doing it rather well, even if some of the consequences are rather odd and funny.

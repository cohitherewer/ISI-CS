 Letters to Editor

 Overdose of religion

 Sir ? Individual freedom is endangered not only when democracy is overthrown by military takeovers, but also when the courts tell you what to wear and what to eat. The judgment of the Pakistan supreme court banning exotic cuisine is not just regressive, it even limits the freedom of choice. There are far more important issues for the supreme court to discuss than the marriage menu. What has an innocent plate of tikka kebab got to do with Islam? Pakistan already has an overdose of Islam, let the courts not add to it.

 Yours faithfully,

Meraj Ahmed Mubarki, Calcutta

 Cold welcome

 Sir ? Is it not strange that Calcutta?s children are going to miss a ?once-in-a-lifetime? opportunity to witness the feats of the sea-lions in the Russian Circus just because some animal rights organizations object to it? If animal-rights-wallahs want to preserve so-called animal rights, they must first take a tour of our very own Alipore Zoo, where both the authorities as well as the visitors take every possible measure to violate animal rights. Where are these people when elephants don?t get adequate water to drink in the zoos? Where do they vanish when tigers and lions are confined in claustrophobic cages? One can be quite sure that the Russian circus is quite careful about the wellbeing of its animals for the Russians, fortunately, are not Indians.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that The Telegraph is one of the sponsors of the Circus on Ice. I say this because I saw the show on November 28 and felt cheated. I had bought tickets for Rs 300 for my family, but our seats were in the worst possible place. Not merely could we not see anything apart from the faces of the performers, but every time we stood up to have a better view, there were loud protests from those behind us. These people were just as irritated as they too had shelved out Rs 300. The next day, I complained to the Celebrity Management Group which informed me that the ticketing had been done by Choice Events amp; Trade Private Limited. When I rang up the latter, they shouted me down, asking me why I should assume that a Rs 300 ticket should be better placed than that of a cheaper denomination? They disconnected when I tried to argue. Will anyone tell me why I was wrong in my assumption?

 Yours faithfully,

K. Acharya, Calcutta

 Unfair game

 Sir ? I entirely agree with Ramachandra Guha?s argument about Anil Kumble (?In praise of a good man?, Nov 27). Kumble?s talent has been underestimated by the Indian squad, which is why he is still considered dispensable for the team. This just explains why winning continues to be a difficult feat for Team India. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.N. Bose, Calcutta

 Sir ? John Wright has often said that the Indian team tries to perform with seven batsmen. Apart from the ?petty role? played by coaches in matters of selection, doubts have also been raised about the team management. Add to this BCCI misgovernance. As the Indian team made no effort to strengthen its bowling, Pakistan routed them in the Platinum Jubilee match in Calcutta. 

 Among numerous other concerns, selectors should specifically see that they make room for talented players. As for Kumble, one should say that our tail-enders do not realize that it is essential that they fully exploit other aspects of their game. Which means Irfan Pathan and Kumble should not only bowl but also bat and field well to be ranked among the giants like Ian Botham and Kapil Dev.

Yours faithfully, 

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

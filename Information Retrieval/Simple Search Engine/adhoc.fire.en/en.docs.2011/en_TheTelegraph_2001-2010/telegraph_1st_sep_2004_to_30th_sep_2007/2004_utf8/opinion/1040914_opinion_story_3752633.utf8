 MONEY BRAKE

 The Reserve Bank of India has now done something about inflation, after having taken note of it in the annual report. For the week ending August 28, the point-to-point wholesale price index inflation rate is 8.33 per cent. More important, there have been four successive weeks of 7 per cent plus inflation. So far, the anti-inflationary package has consisted of duty cuts on petroleum products and steel, with possible further duty cuts on sugar and edible oils. That apart, the RBI has attempted to suck out excess liquidity by selling treasury bills and, with government securities having run out, through sales of market stabilization bonds. With higher inflation from September 2003, the point-to-point WPI inflation would have eased because of the higher base and transitory factors like the truckers? strike or delayed monsoon having slackened. The consumer price index inflation is also significantly lower. 

 However, on such a touchy matter as inflation, the government is unlikely to take chances and monetary policy has now joined the anti-inflationary package. The cash reserve ratio has been hiked to 4.75 per cent from September 18 and will increase to 5 per cent from October 2, back to levels prevailing in June 2002. This certainly goes against the trend of the progressive decline in CRR, but its present impact on interest rates or liquidity is limited.

 For instance, the CRR hike will suck an estimated Rs 8,000 crore out of the banking system, but surplus funds with the banking system are Rs 80,000 crore. More important is the added measure of reducing interest paid on CRR deposits from 6 per cent to 3.5 per cent, hypothetically pressurizing banks to lend more to ensure existing spreads and less hypothetically, improving the RBI?s balance sheet. In the process, this interest rate has been delinked from the bank rate. The drop in prices of government securities and increase in yields are both expected. There is clearly some expectation of interest rates hardening, especially because global interest rates have also increased, notwithstanding statements to the contrary by both the finance ministry and the RBI. Whether the bank rate (repo rate) will eventually be increased is a function of how inflation pans out. If that should happen, investments will suffer. While the prime minister has recently blamed the National Democratic Alliance for pumping excess liquidity into the system, the required deficit reduction is something the United Progressive Alliance is also grappling with. For instance, in its approach paper to the mid-term appraisal of the Tenth Plan, the Planning Commission has recently pointed out that goals of deficit reduction under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act and increased expenditure required by the national common minimum programme are contradictory.

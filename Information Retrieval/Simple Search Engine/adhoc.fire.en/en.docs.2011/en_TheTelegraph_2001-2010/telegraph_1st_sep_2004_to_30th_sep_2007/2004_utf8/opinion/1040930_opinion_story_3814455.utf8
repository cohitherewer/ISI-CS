 Letters to Editor

 A spoilt lot

 Sir ? The introduction of graded payment for Indian cricketers can be best described as a retrograde step (?Enter, cricket cash system?, Sept 27). Cricket is a team game where success depends on collective performances and not individual ones. Then why should there be a difference in the pay packets of players? This is likely to impair the team spirit of our national side. The contract system suffers from a few other problems. Sehwag, who was drafted into the national side later than Zaheer Khan, is sitting pretty on top while the Indian speedster found himself slotted in the middle rung. Moreover, the decision of rewarding players who have not found a berth owing to injury or the lack of form defies logic. Going by the recent performances of the Indian team, one is tempted to say that the board should do away with paying hefty sums to our cricketers. That money would have found better use in supporting young talent outside cricket. 

 Yours faithfully,

Niladri Sen, Calcutta

 Dangerous games

 Sir ? Rudrangshu Mukherjee, in the article ?Child?s Play? (Sept 19), offers some valuable insights. Particularly that one must not make distinctions between different kinds of violence by categorizing them as good or bad after one?s own prejudices towards the perpetrators. Mukherjee, like many others, has correctly pointed out that oppressive political regimes often create conditions that prompt a violent retaliation from those who are the subjects of their oppression. But in a unipolar world ? where there is only one superpower which holds its sway through coercion ? it becomes difficult to differentiate between the violence inflicted by terrorists and that perpetrated by the superpower. 

 Surely no one believes that this election year in America will end without that country being directly or indirectly responsible for incidents of violence in any corner of the world. We cannot ignore such possibilities, as this is what American domination is all about. And, given the fact that each incident of violence has important repercussions in the gamble called American election ? an exercise in which the world?s most coddled and cowardly folk choose between two very similar political parties in a democratic manner ? must we not conclude that these horrors are engineered primarily by those who continually reinforce the electorate?s sense of fear and insecurity in every conceivable manner? 

 Indians, living far away from the United States of America, fail to see its sinister agenda. Or maybe, like Israel, India has its dirty secrets too that colour its perception of America.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Rudrangshu Mukherjee would have done well to expand on the fundamental cause that encourages terrorism ? the calculated conversion of a socio-political or a socio-economic problem (for example, Chechnya and Nepal) into a security issue in order not to break the impasse. This logic is also applicable to the North-east ? Nehru initiated the infamous Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act of 1958 against the Nagas. In the process, the army was made into a convenient scapegoat whereas the manipulative politician got away. 

 Three factors have contributed to the rise of terrorism in modern times: first, the former Soviet Union?s naked aggression in Afghanistan; second, Iraq?s attack on Iran and Kuwait which has destabilized west Asia, and third, the US?s partisan foreign policy based on the belief that what is good for America is good for the world. Only a multipolar world, comprising the European Union, a Eurasian bloc, a Russia-China-India triad, the Organization of Islamic Conference and the US, will induce stability and correct the malfeasance in domestic and international statecraft. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? ?Child?s play? reflects our consternation at the indifference of the votaries of humanitarianism to the Beslan bloodbath. Surprisingly, these intellectuals have let us know in no uncertain terms that they condone the heavy-handed policies of the US. Why is it that their barbs are never directed at the militants who behead common people in Iraq or gun down innocent children in Beslan. These incidents cannot be alluded to only with respect to the predatory misadventures of a superpower. Moreover, it is difficult to agree with Partha Chatterjee when he says?...when the structures of domination in the world are so deeply rooted in the ability to deploy massive and efficient violence, it is neither possible nor justified to insist that those who fight against unfair domination must at all times eschew the use of political violence...?. His lucid observation overlooks the danger of meeting violence with counter-violence. At some point, the approach of a radical intellectual converges with that of a religious fundamentalist, except that the latter?s fervour for, and justification of, his act is steeped in religion. An intellectual should not embrace violence as an ultimate tool for solving societal problems. The moment he resorts to violence, he effectively abandons his finer mental faculties for savagery.

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Beslan revealed a hitherto unknown aspect of terror. So far terrorists have been targeting sensitive installations and symbols of power. But this time they have trained their guns on hapless children. Was it the collapse of the Soviet Union, which has opened up pockets of terror in this part of the world. Collective action by different countries, and not ad hoc individual efforts, alone can end the scourge of terrorism.

 Yours faithfully,

Diana Sahu, Cuttack

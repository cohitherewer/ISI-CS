 ENTERING THE ENVIRONMENT 

- The greening of the left has probably been good for it 

POLITICS AND PLAY / RAMACHANDRA GUHA

 About the querulous left 

This article is about an interesting, important, but 

as yet little-analysed phenomenon in contemporary Indian politics the entry 

into the environmental movement of the organized left.

Through the Seventies and Eighties, Indian environmentalists 

were the target of sharp attack by the two established communist parties, the 

Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The Communists 

distrusted the environmentalists because they worked with social groups fisherfolk, 

pastoralists, tribals whose interests were different from, and sometimes even 

opposed to, the interests of their own core constituency of workers and peasants. 

Thus when industrial pollution killed the River Chaliyar in Kerala and put hundreds 

of small fisherfolk out of business, the CPI(M) worked to keep the factory going, 

even though it was owned by one of Indias least-liked capitalist families, the 

Birlas.

Communists opposed environmentalists, in practice; 

but they also opposed them in theory, for asking critical questions of modern 

science and technology, and for suggesting that modern industrialization might 

face ecological limits. Greens were, from the classical Marxist point of view, 

merely a bunch of reactionary Luddites. But, it was suggested, they were not merely 

foolish but also dangerous playing into the hands of the American imperialists 

who did not wish to see India emerge as a strong and self-reliant power.

Let me recall here a conversation, held c. 1981-2, 

with a friend who had been an undergraduate with me in Delhi. I was in the early 

stages of a dissertation on the Chipko Andolan, and had just spent several days 

in the company of Chipkos leader, Chandi Prasad Bhatt. My friend, on the other 

hand, was now an active member of the CPI(M). When I explained to him what I was 

working on, he commented that if it opposed the felling of forests, the Chipko 

movement was on the side of reaction. For forest felling fuelled the paper industry, 

where laboured the advanced guard of the working class, who would lead the proletarian 

revolution of the future. From the point of view of the Marxist catechism his 

logic was irrefutable. But it left me feeling uncomfortable. How could a man of 

such manifest sincerity and social commitment as Chandi Prasad Bhatt be, even 

objectively speaking, a reactionary?

At the time, Indian environmentalists were often dismissed 

as CIA agents a charge, ridiculous though it was, not so easy to shake off, 

at a time when American foreign policy disadvantaged India, and when there was 

an Indo-Soviet Friendship Treaty in place. But in 1989 the Cold War ended. Then 

in 1991, two events even more momentous for Indians took place: the Soviet Union 

broke up, and India embarked on a programme of economic liberalization, upturning 

decades of an autarkic, state-directed policy of economic development.

In this, radically changed, context, Indian Marxists 

began to look more benignly upon Indian environmentalists. Ecology now became 

a handy stick to beat the enemy with. For the manifest reality of environmental 

degradation shot a hole in capitalist triumphalism; this was one illness 

the market could not cure. On the contrary, it seemed to make it worse.

Many greens shared this suspicion of the market; albeit 

from a communitarian, rather than socialist, point of view. Liberalization and 

globalization, they argued, encouraged avarice in individuals and undermined social 

solidarity. Thus, through the Nineties, Marxists and environmentalists made common 

cause against the opening out of the Indian economy. They worked together, for 

example, in struggles against the Enron power plant in Maharashtra and the Cogentrix 

unit in Karnataka.

There were good, solid reasons for opposing Enron 

and Cogentrix. Both these projects were rushed through by corrupt politicians, 

and both would have negatively impacted the environment and local communities. 

However, this opposition to specific projects soon became subsumed in a wholesale 

denunciation of the market and globalization. The fact that Enron and Cogentrix 

were foreign-owned was crucial here; for it helped paint them as agents of an 

aggressive Western imperialism.

The movements of the Nineties helped strengthen the 

strand of the environmental movement that privileged opposition above all else. 

Both Reds and Greens began speaking of a second independence movement to free 

India from the forces of neo-colonialism. The rhetoric became more extreme. 

Few talked any more about reform in the energy, water, transport or forest sectors. 

Instead, the call was for systemic change, for the overthrow of the present 

corrupt regime and its replacement with a presumably perfect one.

The playwright Michael Frayn has said of his fellow 

British leftists that they find it easy to jeer, but very hard to do anything 

positive or constructive. Long before him, George Orwell had also commented with 

feeling on the generally negative, querulous attitude of the left-wing intellectual. 

This kind of obligatory, knee-jerk, anti-establishmentarianism is in fact characteristic 

of radicals everywhere.

In India, though, this negativism had been tempered 

by the heritage of Gandhism. For Gandhi knew that even the enemy had something 

to offer you; thus his respect, for example, for notions of British justice and 

equality before the law. He knew also that it was not enough to oppose exploitation 

 one had to work towards less exploitative alternatives; thus his revival and 

upgradation of village crafts, and his emphasis on manual labour for all, regardless 

of caste.

This, so to say Gandhian, heritage was once a very 

visible presence in the Indian environmental movement. It informed the work of 

Chandi Prasad Bhatt, who has strong claims to being the first modern Indian environmentalist, 

and also to being the greatest. It inspired countless others to work on practical 

programmes of water management, energy conservation, afforestation, and recycling. 

And it encouraged scholars to chart practical policy alternatives to projects 

and practices that destroyed environments and livelihoods with them.

Tragically, these reform-minded environmentalists 

have no voice in the media, which tends to give space only to extreme views, to 

ignore work being done, solidly but quietly, to restore ravaged ecosystems, to 

conserve water and plant trees, to promote energy-efficient technologies. The 

times call for a proactive and constructive agenda for environmentalism. What 

we hear, however, is a mostly negative and reactive one. Prodded by the media, 

and by the left, environmentalists are encouraged to whole-heartedly oppose the 

market, the state, globalization, enterprise. This might perhaps get them some 

(short-term) attention, and a few (also short-term) converts, but at the cost 

of a further alienation from the majority of Indians.

For the ordinary Indian is not an extremist. He, and 

she, are not totally pro-development, or pro-environment, or pro-large dams, or 

pro-indigenous peoples. He, and she, want opposing interests to be harmonized. 

That, indeed, is what democracy is about the harmonizing of competing interests.

In the Seventies, when the environment was thought 

to be a rich persons fad, it was perhaps understandable if activists (and writers) 

used high-blown rhetoric, if they, so to say, were prone only to scream and shout. 

But thirty years down the line such methods are less acceptable, and less productive. 

There is a greater acceptance now of the need for sustainable technologies and 

ways of life. What people now want are solutions, methods and means to harmonize 

the conflicts between different social classes or communities, and between human 

aspirations and the needs of nature.

At the same time, the aspirations of Indians for a 

less deprived lifestyle have greatly risen. They want better houses, better means 

of transportation, decent clothing, good food the kinds of things that can only 

be provided through the more efficient use of resources.

The Greening of the left has probably been good for 

the left; exposing it to aspects of social deprivation that it previously ignored. 

But whether the company of the comrades has been good for the Greens is another 

matter altogether.

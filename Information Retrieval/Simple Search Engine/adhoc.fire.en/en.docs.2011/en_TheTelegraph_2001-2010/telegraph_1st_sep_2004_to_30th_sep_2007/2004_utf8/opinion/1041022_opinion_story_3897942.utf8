 Letters to Editor

 Language barrier

 Sir ? West Bengal?s education minister, Kanti Biswas, may feel pleased with his efforts to improve the standard of English taught in the state (?Kanti sings Joshi tune?, Oct 12). But what is intriguing is Biswas?s belief that only a collaboration with British funding agencies can achieve this. This means British teachers training resource teachers here, who will in turn train teachers in different parts of the state. Such a grand plan is risible because the already cash-strapped state government can ill afford it. Biswas would have done better to turn to the scores of English teachers in the city who are equally capable. In fact, not too long ago, the British government was advertising for English teachers from India to teach the Queen?s language to youngsters there. Besides, the latter will be far less intimidating to teachers from rural Bengal and hence, more effective in communicating with them. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Shubhra Roy, Calcutta

 On the horns of a dilemma

 Sir ? It is difficult to understand why Ashok Mitra has chosen to attack the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, saying that he went out ?with a begging-bowl beseeching funds from Western capitalists? (?The golden age?, Oct 15). The business community in India had keenly looked forward to Singh?s visit to the United States of America and what use would such a visit be if Singh did not capitalize on it? What is wrong with inviting foreign investments for India when the government has focussed on development as its primary objective? 

 Mitra may be right in observing that foreign investors will only want to invest in India if the economic prospects are good. The foreign companies India is inviting will surely not invest only on the assurances given by the government, especially with so much uncertainty in the political sphere. Singh is only doing what is needed of him if we are to fulfil our development goals without glitches. But this must not be interpreted to mean that India is entirely dependent on foreign funds to develop its infrastructure and basic amenities.

 Besides Mitra is hardly being practical when he says that things will look up if the rich start saving for purposes of national development. With so many different sections of the rich in India, this is easier said than done. Before casting aspersions on the prime minister?s strategies, Mitra would do well to remember that Singh was the brain behind the economic reforms and the boom of the Nineties. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra?s arguments reveal the immorality and the mindlessness of the materialistic pursuits of the affluent, who prefer to distance themselves from the larger problems of society. Not only are the poor in India often deprived of the benefits of the government?s development programmes but many a time they are also humiliated by the rich who believe in an ostentatious display of wealth. 

 The UPA should not forget that one of the principal reasons the previous government did not make a comeback was its inability to strike a chord with the poor, who still form a large percentage of the population of India. In dealing with India?s ?development dilemma?, a system needs to be evolved that gives primacy to the welfare of this deprived class. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It was rather amusing to read ?The golden age? as proof of just how carried away Ashok Mitra got while writing about India?s ?development dilemma?. Bank loans for cars have become quite common these days, but one has not yet heard of similar loans for refrigerators and music systems to facilitate purchase ?by the affluent?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Saptarshi Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra extolling of the Chinese success story would be incomplete without an allusion to the pragmatic communist, Deng Xiao Ping. Deng?s famous maxim, ?to be rich is glorious?, embodies the innate human urge to enhance his wealth, unless one is the self-abnegating kind. Mitra observes that the rich in India prefer jewels and cars to development. This frantic rush for assets is to secure the future against the impermanence of cash and also because they are status symbols. 

 In this context, India has not been doing too badly over the years. Household consumer goods of all shapes, sizes and uses have found their way into nearly every corner of the country. However, consumption disparities figure quite prominently, especially in places like rural Bengal where consumption does not measure up to that in other parts of the country. 

 While speaking of development, another point deserves mention ? that of migration of villagers to urban areas in the hope of a better standard of living. Focussing only on micro-level rural development, without looking at industries at all, is one cause for the exodus. 

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra deserves praise for so clearly pointing to a few important facts about India?s development. We want India to become a ?developed? country but are unwilling to make the sacrifices that are needed. We want world-class infrastructure, but are unwilling to pay the level of taxes that is needed to finance it. Come budget time and we use the media to pressurize the finance minister so that he resorts to populist measures. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil M. Caleb, Calcutta

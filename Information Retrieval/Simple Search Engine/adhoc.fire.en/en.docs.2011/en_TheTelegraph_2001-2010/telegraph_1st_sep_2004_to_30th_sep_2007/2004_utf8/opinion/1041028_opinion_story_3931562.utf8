 NOT YET FREE

 The Reserve Bank of India?s mid-term review of annual policy is along expected lines, at least for macro indicators of growth and inflation. The gross domestic product growth projections for 2004-05 have been lowered. This is attributed to delayed and deficient rainfall and high global oil prices, compensated for partly by buoyant exports and industrial growth. The impact of oil prices on inflation is sharper. Compared to the 5 per cent inflation expected in May 2004, the RBI now expects annualized inflation to be 6.5 per cent. There must therefore have been some temptation to hike the bank rate from 6 per cent or the cash reserve ratio from 5 per cent. Such changes need not necessarily be linked to the bi-annual ritual and interim hikes are possible. 

 However, it cannot be anyone?s case that the RBI is completely independent and in the growth versus inflation trade-off, the government must have instructed the Central bank that growth was the priority. There is also the ulterior motive that high interest rates increase costs of government debt and given the National Common Minimum Programme?s expenditure compulsions, government borrowing is likely to increase more. At the moment, there is a liquidity overhang, but once that eases, government borrowing can crowd out private investments. That will hardly be desirable when private investments are showing some signs of recovery. By hiking the repo rate to 4.75 per cent, the RBI has sought to suck some liquidity out of the system. Excess liquidity is largely due to capital inflows, coupled with reluctance to allow rupee appreciation. Indeed, capital inflows have now slackened and sooner or later, interest rates will harden. Deposit rates are artificially low, and as the RBI has argued earlier, low deposit rates have not been adequately matched by low lending rates. The dilemma has thus only been postponed. Global oil prices will not drop significantly, not with China?s continued demand and the winter demand. Government borrowing cannot be curbed, notwithstanding the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.

 Non-food credit has exploded in the first six months of 2004-05, compared to 2003-04. And the compulsion to increase credit flows to priority sectors like agriculture will also continue. Hence, although the RBI has not moved to a higher interest rate regime yet, the signals are clear. Bond prices have already crashed following the mid-term review. This is a knee-jerk reaction, but only in part. Interest rates have hardened in developed countries and India cannot indefinitely postpone the inevitable. Indeed, the experiences of the United States of America and Britain indicate how far India has to go in making the RBI truly autonomous of the finance ministry and the government.

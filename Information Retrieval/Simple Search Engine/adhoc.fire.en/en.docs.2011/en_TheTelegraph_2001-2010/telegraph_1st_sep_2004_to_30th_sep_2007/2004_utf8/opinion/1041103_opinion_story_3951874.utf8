 WAITING FOR A MIRACLE

 Raju Mukherji

 Miracles happen once in a lifetime. It is thus ridiculous to expect the magnificent victories at Calcutta and Chennai in 2001 to be repeated in 2004. The exploits of V.V.S. Laxman and Harbhajan Singh in those matches are now part of cricketing history. 

 After the successes at Australia and Pakistan in early 2004, a new season awaited India. A season that the Indian players began with no preparation at all. Cricket took a backseat as graded payments, television rights and BCCI elections took precedence. You reap as you sow. Thus invariably, the defeats at Sri Lanka, Holland and England heralded the signals.

 But then who has the time to notice the ominous signals? Neither the Board of Control for Cricket in India nor the players. They were far too engrossed in their non-cricketing agendas.

 Sachin Tendulkar?s ?tennis elbow? made a mockery of modern medicine. The genius went on nursing his ailment for months ? the marks of 16-years? of constant play without rest. Why cannot we accept the fact that for any sportsman over 30, injuries are bound to happen time and again?

 Our national selectors are so irresponsible that they even selected an unfit Tendulkar for the first two tests. This too must be a record. Has any cricketer in the nearly 130-year history of test cricket been selected despite being so evidently unfit?

 Wrong picture

 The impression created by the Indian players as well as former-cricketers-turned-experts was that Adam Gilchrist?s Australia would be no match for India. Indian cricket- lovers were informed that Shane Warne and Glen McGrath would no longer be the threats that they were. The reasons shown were McGrath?s long lay-off owing to injury and Warne?s lack of success on previous tours to India.

 What our experts did not take into account was that the Aussies were hardened professionals itching for revenge. They had not forgotten the 2001 series and were busy preparing to avenge the defeat. When our players were dancing to the dictates of sponsors and haranguing for graded payments, the Aussies were hard at work.

 Australia does not look at past performance when selecting players. Every single individual in the XI, no matter who he is, has to be worthy of his place in the team by virtue of his current form, which obviously includes his physical fitness. They do not believe in medical certificates. Even a performer like McGrath had to prove his physical fitness. Our national selectors give two hoots about the form of the individual players. For them the only consideration is a fitness certificate!

 Revenge attack

 The very fact that he had not done well enough on the previous tours to India was itself a motivating factor for Shane Warne. His pride in his own performance made him determined to prove to his detractors that he was capable of capturing wickets on Indian soil and against Indian batsmen. Why couldn?t the Indian ?think-tank? even visualize something as obvious as this?

 The absence of Ricky Ponting in the Australia line-up brought into focus the talent of Simon Katich and Michael Clarke. The two youngsters exposed the limitation of the Indian attack. 

 On the other hand, the most deserving of our young players ? like Sriram of Tamil Nadu ? was not even thought to be good enough to be in the XV. Believe it or not, our national selectors actually thought an injured Tendulkar is a better bet than a young, aspiring talent. Herein lies the tragedy of Indian cricket today. It is time the men who matter in Indian cricket realized that miracles do not happen every day. Miracles happen only once, if at all, in a lifetime.

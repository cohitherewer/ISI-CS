 POWERS TO BE MISUSED

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The CBI seems to be losing its veneer of being a non-partisan investigating body and is increasingly coming across as an arm of whichever is the party in power. It must be a department cursed by all those innocents it has humiliated and victimized. Rajiv Gandhi is one example. After years and years, our former prime minister was fully absolved of all the accusations hurled at him, mercilessly, by his opponents. Then the owners and employees of Tehelka were reduced to virtual bankruptcy. Satish Sharma?s cases have been withdrawn. The credibility of the CBI and its officers leave much to be desired. Maybe the time has come to put the CBI under the aegis of Parliament and not the government in power in an attempt to make it respected, legitimate and acceptable. 

 It was ridiculous for the police to arrest the CEO of baazee.com and that was the view across the board. People were disgusted with the action. The young reacted by saying that this country was nowhere near ready to support entrepreneurial start ups because of the draconian manner in which the authority behaves when it is unable to comprehend new businesses, approaches, attitudes and international mindsets. Harassment by the police and the archaic administration are huge dampeners on new enterprises. The honest young would rather move out of this country with their creative ideas because India does not give them a chance. Anyone who does not want to get into the web of extortion and corrupt practices has no place on our commercial stage. 

 To make legitimate money and create wealth through hard work is seen to be wrong and harassment invariably follows success. Success is unacceptable in the eyes of the authority and honest endeavour with success cuts into the potential filling of their personal coffers.

 Legitimate grouse

 The arrest of the CEO of baazee.com also brought forth the ridiculous aspect where people were wondering why the chief minister of Delhi had not been arrested because she is, as CM, the landlady of Palika Bazaar, the porn market of the capital. Sunil Mittal too, since his company transmitted the MMS, and the board of DPS School because the students were from there. It was absurd, and made us look like some pathetic third world country stuck in a time warp.

 This brings one to the question of police reform. It is time police acts are looked at carefully and some of the draconian powers withdrawn. Personal vendettas are more often than not settled through these acts and powers with the payment of illegal money. Equally, the force needs to have better working conditions and appropriate tools to do their jobs honourably, like they once did. It is urgent to rework the laws of this land to assist a democracy rather than use the laws set by the oppressor to deal with the ?natives?. 

 It is these draconian laws that have given our politicians and the authority that administers us, the cocky and authoritative stance that they adopt. They behave no differently from the Brits. Till these radical changes are not brought into play, life and enterprise in India will be miserable and those thousands that exploit us, preventing growth, change and development, will continue to rake it in to stop the blooming of India. 

 Someone was describing a massive raid on their business headquarters in Mumbai, where apparently, the raiding officers were more concerned about negotiating a ?deal? that would stop the raid and bury the complaint. The sums discussed were mind-boggling for most professionals. Where is that honest point of reference where legitimate complaints of extortion will be dealt with without future harassment by the concerned agencies and the police force? When and how will legitimacy come into the lives of Indians?

 Letters to Editor

 The dogs know better

 Sir ? The report, ?Curb criminals, muzzle mongrels (Dec 15), was heart-warming. Despite the arch references to the chief minister?s daughter, who was allegedly responsible for saving the lives of the street dogs on Palm Avenue, the policemen emerged as humane individuals. An aside. Three years ago, my neighbourhood used to be a garbage dump. Street dogs lived on rotten left-overs. Local citizens initiated a cleanliness drive and the mongrels had to migrate elsewhere, or starve to death. Over the years that awareness has dissipated. Citizens have begun to litter the streets and the mangy, ill-fed canines are limping back. Perhaps here is a lesson for us ? keep the city clean, or man?s best friend (risking death at the CMC?s pounds) will keep trying to howl civic sense into us, night after night.

 Yours faithfully,

 Prosenjit Roy, Calcutta 

 Save a life

 Sir ? I am a retired NRI physician who has trained at some of the world?s largest and best-known trauma centres and emergency medicine faculties. I am alarmed at the erroneous information in the editorial, ?Left to die? (Dec 13). The golden period after a cardiac arrest is not 45 minutes, as mentioned, but only 10 minutes. If there is no blood circulation to the brain, resulting in lack of oxygen, the brain suffers irreparable damage. So cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (cardiac massage, mouth-to-mouth breathing) must be started within 10 minutes. Any further delay will result in the condition known as ?brain death?. However, the one exception to this urgent administration of CPR is cold -water drowning, where the brain is already protected from oxygen deprivation by the cold temperature of water. CPR can then be started any time, along with a slow and cautious re-warming of the body. 

 It is a pity that nothing is being done by the administration to improve emergency services for the general public. My sister died a few months ago of a heart attack. She was conscious when taken into the ambulance. She died in the ambulance even though the hospital was five minutes away. She was not given any CPR. In today?s educated society, it is criminal to call a van an ambulance just because it is equipped with a blinking red light and a siren. My sister would have been alive today if that ?ambulance? had been staffed with trained paramedics and had an automatic defibrillator, a device that generates computerized ECG readings and gives an electric shock, when indicated, to regulate the rhythm of a dying heart. The cost of an automatic defibrillator is also a fraction of that of a van. The government should consider de-licensing all ?ambulances? which lack these. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.K. Datta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Left to die?, says that very few people in West Bengal know how to deal with cardiac arrest. But why only West Bengal? This comment could well be made of the entire nation. Those who know how to deal with cardiac arrest must form a small percentage out of the entire population. The Dempo striker, Cristiano de Lima Junior, could have been saved by CPR. Was anybody present on the field aware that Junior had suffered a cardiac arrest and needed CPR? Anybody could be taught to do it, yes. But then, don?t we all know the basics of first-aid? How many times have we actually witnessed people practising first-aid, especially in accidents? There are so many medical fundamentals that we are supposed to know in our daily lives, but never use. 

 The editorial says it all. But what else can be expected in a state where all political parties united a few days ago to shut down shop? Do we expect people to learn sensible things like CPR ? a term that will be Greek to most? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Arta Mishra, Cuttack

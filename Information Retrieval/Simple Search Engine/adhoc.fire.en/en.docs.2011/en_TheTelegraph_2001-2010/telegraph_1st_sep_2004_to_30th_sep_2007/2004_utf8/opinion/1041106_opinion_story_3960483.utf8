 Letters to Editor

 Sin no more 

 Sir ? Now sex sells in the Vatican too (?Vatican stamp on ?original sin??, Nov 1). But then is this a sign of the church finally ?opening up?? Far from it. While it is okay for ?church-going? Roman catholics to have more sex, there are, presumably, no such concessions for us, poor atheists. Neither is the papal leadership willing to change its views on other pertinent issues like homosexuality or abortion. Like our film producers, clerics in Rome seem to have discovered that skin, rather than faith, works wonders for arresting falling attendance.

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Water woes

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra does have reasons to be pessimistic about the proposal to interlink rivers in India (?Taking on nature?, Oct 29). The real question, according to Mitra, is whether we should use the funds needed to finance this mega dream to meet other basic, and more pertinent, needs of the hour. His point is well taken. But even if the funds were better used elsewhere, would it solve the country?s water problems, as Mitra asks. 

 One more thing. Mitra reminds us of the many acrimonious exchanges that have taken place between states over the distribution of water. One cannot say for sure that such disputes would stop once the project is completed. More important, this proposal is bound to cause severe strain on India?s economy and ecology, strain relations between states and benefit only the privileged sections of society.

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir ?The proposal to interlink Indian rivers is, undoubtedly, a noble one. But the cons far outnumber the pros. Consider these points. First, those who devised this grand plan may have a fertile imagination, but they lack the capacity to execute a plan of such magnitude. Second, the plan to link rivers is not practical. It is only natural that in a large country like ours, one state faces shortage of water while another experiences floods. Such things are beyond human control. Finally, the project?s implementation will involve the displacement of human beings and animals from their habitat. Cannot the government, as Mitra rightly asks, put available resources to better use? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The proposal to interlink rivers, which is expected to benefit people living in arid states and those affected by floods, was long overdue. Besides generating employment, the project, if executed successfully, will help solve the problem of water distribution in India.

 Yours faithfully,

 Chicken please

 Sir ? In ?Smells from the kitchen? (Oct 23), Khushwant Singh writes, ?In Bengali homes no chicken or chicken eggs are eaten; they prefer to eat duck and duck eggs.? Sadly Singh?s information is outdated. Chicken has always been a favourite with Bengalis. I remember my mother cooking chicken on a portable stove without any scruple 60 years ago. Today, chicken dishes are available in all eateries serving non-vegetarian fare. But duck is not easily found in the market and is rarely served on social occasions. Singh had better change his views about kitchen fads in Bengal fast.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? Two naughty Bengali ladies cracked a joke when they told Khuswant Singh that Bengali Hindus do not eat chicken or chicken eggs because Muslims relish chicken. Singh, the simpleton that he is, took them seriously. Was Singh so short on matter for his column that he had to rely on such stuff?

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

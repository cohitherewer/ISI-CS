 KING WITHOUT THE CROWN

THIS ABOVE ALL / KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Partners in the struggle

 Late on the night of January 16, 1941 Subhas Bose dressed as a maulvi with a beard, fez on head and long coat. He was driven out of a house in which he was on remand and escaped to Dhanbad. He had assumed the name of Mohammed Ziauddin. From Dhanbad across UP, Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province, he entered Afghanistan as a Muslim pilgrim. He made contact with the Italian legation, took an Italian name ? Orlando Mazotta ? and was smuggled out to Soviet Russia. From Moscow, he was flown to Berlin in April 1941. It was from Nazi Germany?s radio that the world heard that Subhas Bose had thrown in his lot with the Axis powers ? Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and monarchist Japan under military dictatorship. 

 Bose was neither a communist nor a fascist. He was single-minded in his quest for freedom for India and was willing to join any power at war with India?s British rulers. To him, the means of doing so were of marginal importance; what mattered was the end. That put him at variance with the two men who mattered most in India?s struggle for freedom ? Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Gandhi was the king-maker. He had his differences with both Nehru and Bose. But in the end he decided to put the crown on Nehru?s head. Why?

 This is the theme of Reba Som?s latest book, Gandhi, Bose, Nehru: And the Making of Modern Mind. Reba has published many books on Indian politics. She is the wife of Himachal Som, Indian ambassador to Rome and mother of Vishnu of NDTV. She is an exotic beauty and has as beautiful a voice as a face. Her cassette of Rabindra Sangeet was released last year.

 Gandhi had a common bond with Bose and a firm attachment to Hindu faith and tradition. However, Bose?s Hinduism was quite different from Gandhi?s. Gandhi was a Vaishnavite, a strict vegetarian, teetotaller and propagated non-violence. Bose was a Sakta, worshipper of Kali and Durga. Being an upper middle-class bhadralok Bengali Kayastha, he was a meat-eater. This often created problems for the Bose household when the Mahatma came to stay with them in Calcutta. They had to get a herd of goats which were first examined by Gandhi?s secretary, Mahadev Desai. He peered into their faces and chose one with a chaste look before she was milked for Bapu?s breakfast.

 Bose also did not believe in passive resistance; few Bengalis did. For them fight for freedom required use of bombs and pistols, as had been used by Bengali terrorists of the Anusilan Samities and the Jugantar Party. Bose?s mentors were not Gandhi but Vivekananda, Aurobindo and C.R. Das. He believed in building corps of men and women volunteers who were physically fit, putting them in military uniforms and disciplining them like soldiers. More than this, Bose took on Gandhi?s candidates at Indian National Congress elections and won. He had to pay the price for his audacity. Nehru was careful enough never to get into confrontation with Bapu and became his favourite son.

 Nevertheless, when Bose arrived from Germany and surfaced in Japan to re-organize the Indian National Army, he became India?s hero number one. Nehru kept his cards close to his chest and refrained to comment on Bose and the INA, till he was sure that Bose had been killed in an air crash in 1945. He cashed in on the people?s enthusiasm for the Azad Hind Fauj and addressed mammoth meetings all over the country, defending officers of the INA against charges of treason. He was a more astute politician than Bose.

 One of the ?ifs? of recent Indian history is what would have happened had Bose arrived in India as a conqueror for freedom? There is little doubt he would have put Nehru out of the picture. His great strength were his Hindu roots but without any anti-Muslim prejudices displayed by many of our Hindu netas of today. Bose was not an obscurantist; he was forward-looking and would have speeded up modernization of the country because by temperament he was also dictator.

 Reba Som?s book makes fascinating reading. The issues she deals with are now of academic interest but nevertheless compel the reader to fantasize where India could have got under the leadership of a dynamo like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

 Saddammed to a rat hole

 Bush is fine; Saddam is a swine,

Vices are all yours; virtues are all mine!

Ours is a ?Coalition?; His a ?Gang of thugs?,

If ya fall out of us, we gonna pull out all your plugs!

They run away from the battlefield, we do a ?tactical 

retreat?, 

It it?s ?bravery of being out of reach? ? We are really 

hard to beat!

When Bush?s ratings go down like Niagara

?War? works on us like, kinda ? ?Political Viagra?

 We do ?collateral damage?; 

 Saddam?s is genocide,

Which one is justified ? we are there to decide!

He attacks to ?loot?; we invade ?to liberate?,

Give us a place to land; we are there to fornicate!

Iraq is a big green pasture; we?ll grave it at our 

own sweet will,

First we pull down their pants; then we?ll send them 

the bill!

The whole world is our Colony ? North Pole to South 

Pole,

Trespassers will be prosecuted, or ? Saddammed to 

a rat hole!

If you are not with us, you are against US,

No arguments, and mind your tongue ? ?You Ass?!

We have to drill or kill we have Texaco, Nixxon n?Shell

Its our sacred belief that ? World IS A BIG OIL WELL!

We gotta get it for ?twenty cents a ton?

Man, Barrel of Oil comes out of Barrel of Gun!

Bush?s last sigh is, Moor?s ultimate delight

The political temperature in US is ? 9/11 Fahrenheit!

 Old drink in old bottles

The old man took martini ten pegs a day without fail

All his friends? entreaties were of no avail.

 When he was in some sense

 They urged him to try abstinence

He refused, saying it was too late to try a new cocktail!

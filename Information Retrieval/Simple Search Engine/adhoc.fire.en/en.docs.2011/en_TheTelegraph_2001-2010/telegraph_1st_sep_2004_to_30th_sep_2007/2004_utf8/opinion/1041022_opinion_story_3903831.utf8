 STORIES TO ENTERTAIN

 Popular haunts

A FACE IN THE DARK AND OTHER HAUNTINGS: 

Collected stories of the Supernatural 

By Ruskin Bond, 

Viking, Rs 250

Most tales of the supernatural are ghost stories. 

And ghost stories are enjoyed by almost everybody, even those who do not believe 

in ghosts. A gripping ghost story may well cause a ?willing suspension of disbelief? 

as the plot unravels itself. Besides, Ruskin Bond argues that a good ghost story 

can make you mull over the mysteries of human existence, and raise the possibility 

of another layer of life outside our material selves ? something akin to a soul 

force, the aura of a person that lingers on after the body is gone. And it makes 

its presence felt in different, and often unexpected, ways.

 It would appear from Bond?s stories that ghosts are almost always melancholy spirits looking for a lost love or a lost home. They are unquiet, unhappy souls, sometimes haunting the place they once knew. Frustrated or betrayed lovers and wives who committed suicide or met with with an accidental death, reappear as ghosts in captivating stories like ?Listen to the Wind?, ?Wilson?s Bridge?, ?Whistling in the Dark?, ?Topaz?, ?The Ghost in the Garden? and ?Susanna?s Seven Husbands?. 

 Old houses are most popular with resident ghosts. Besides in India, as Bond points out, the peepal tree takes pride of place in tales of the supernatural. ?The Haunted Bungalow? describes how ghosts in peepal trees attack unwary passers-by and play havoc with their lives. 

 Sheer malignity, almost motiveless, is characterized by the rich and pitiless Susanna, in the story ?Susanna?s Seven Husbands?. It is widely believed that she disposed of all her husbands and is still looking for her final victim after her death. 

 As a writer of ghost stories and supernatural tales, Ruskin Bond may not rank with acknowledged masters of the genre as M.R. James, Walter de la Mare and Hugh Walpole. But he does succeed in building up suspense and also incorporates an element of humour. To quote Bond: ?The stories were written to entertain rather than to instruct. They are not all frightening, or spooky, the supernatural has its funny side too, as some of the stories will testify.?

 TURN AROUND

 The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, has redeemed a pledge he made during his recent visit to Assam. His office has moved fast to invite the United Liberation Front of Asom to peace talks. That the invitation has been conveyed through the Assamese writer, Ms Indira Goswami, does nothing to detract from the government?s sincerity to start a dialogue with the rebels. Ms Goswami had carried a message to the prime minister last month from the ULFA, expressing its willingness to begin the long-awaited peace process in Assam. It is significant that the government had offered to hold ?unconditional talks?. Its significance lies in the fact that the message from the ULFA had insisted on the talks centering on its idea of ?sovereignty for the Assamese people?. Although New Delhi has reservations about the issue of ?sovereignty?, as the ULFA put it, it did not stop the former from sending out the invitation. Obviously, there is a genuine desire on the government?s part to go the extra mile to give peace in the North-east every conceivable chance. This is reflected not only in the sustained peace efforts with Naga rebels, but also in the first-ever agreement on a ceasefire between the government and the Bodo militants in Assam. 

 The ball is now in the ULFA?s court. By agreeing to the mediation by Ms Goswami, the militants too sent out a positive signal. They now have to seize the moment and leave past indiscretions behind. The ULFA also cannot afford to miss a larger point about the Centre?s new peace initiatives. Just as the militancies in the region were once dependent on each other, the peace processes could also bind them together. The issues in Nagaland would obviously be different from those in Assam or Manipur. The approaches to specific issues could also differ. Different rebel organizations could have differing perceptions of territorial and other issues. But the overriding factor is the new climate ? and a new mood ? for peace. The ULFA ? or any other insurgent group for that matter ? cannot ignore the change in positions of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Isak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah. Having led the country?s longest insurgency for over half-a-century, these leaders are now talking of a new faith in non-violence. The ULFA would be betraying the cause of peace ? and of Assam ? if it fails to reciprocate New Delhi?s gesture.

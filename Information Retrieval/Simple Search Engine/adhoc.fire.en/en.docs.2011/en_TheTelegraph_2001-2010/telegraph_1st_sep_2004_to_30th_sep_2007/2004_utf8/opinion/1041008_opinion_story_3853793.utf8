 STATES? RIGHTS

 Suddenly defenders of India?s national security and sovereignty have become dime a dozen. The offer of the ambassador of the United States of America in New Delhi to Mr Tarun Gogoi, the chief minister of Assam, that help from the FBI would be forthcoming to track down terrorists in the North-east has raised hackles in predictable places. This anger is misplaced for a number of reasons. The first of these was pointed out by the home minister, Mr Shivraj Patil, who clarified that the ambassador?s offer was in keeping with the bilateral cooperation agreement on countering terrorism. The US ambassador, Mr David C. Mulford, was acting in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the agreement. Since the cry of interference has come from left quarters, it can be assumed that the objection arises because the offer has come from across the pond. If such offers had come from communist regimes, when they existed, no such outcry of interference would have ensued.

 The objections are misplaced for more serious reasons as well. India is a federal polity in which the states enjoy substantial powers under the Constitution. The states have also, over the years, resisted efforts on the part of the Centre to centralize resources and decision-making. The states, led by the Left Front government in West Bengal, have also objected to the arbitrary manner in which the Centre allocates resources to the states. The states have consistently, and with great justification, argued for greater autonomy. There is a case for saying that pointing out the anomalies in the Centre-state relations and arguing in favour of greater federalism have been one of the major contributions of the left in the debates concerning the working of the Indian polity. It needs to be pointed out from the same premises of federalism that it is impossible to object to any government?s attempts to secure the help of any agency, external or internal, for solving a law and order problem which is a state subject. Nothing should stand in the way of a state administration seeking a bilateral agreement with a country. The US administration has articulated a profound concern about the growth of terrorism across the world. It also has more sophisticated instruments to check terrorism than is available in India. The offer to help in the North-east grows out of this concern. It should be welcomed. It should also be emphasized that the offer from the US sends a strong message to those of India?s neighbours, who may be involved in sponsoring the violence.

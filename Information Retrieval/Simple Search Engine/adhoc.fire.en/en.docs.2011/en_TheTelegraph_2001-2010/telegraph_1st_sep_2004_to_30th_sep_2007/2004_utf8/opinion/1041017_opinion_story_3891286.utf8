 DIARY

 Didi?s newly-launched Jago Bangla should have been a test of strength for Ganashakti. Instead, it has caused another ripple of laughter in the left camp over what they say, ?Radhikar prem chotke gechche?. They are talking about Radhika Ranjan Pramanik, former CPI(M) MP, who recently joined the Trinamoolis after much drama. A red fresh in her hands, didi set about to reconquer the world. Pramanik was assigned to bring out Jago, and the former left rose to the occasion, providing most of what went into the making of the paper. Things went on smoothly till he received a copy of the newspaper just prior to its release last Wednesday. In it, Mamata figured as the editor-in-chief, and her cronies made up most of the names on the editorial board. Radha was named as ?chief adviser? and his contribution to the paper was not even hinted at in the inaugural function that followed. Pramanik, quite expectedly, has hit the ceiling. Attempts are being made to bring him around. He has been asked to take heart in the fact that even Subrata Mukherjee does not figure in the list. There are braver words from the mayor himself. He is supposed to have said that such swift and decisive changes are common in editorial boards the world over. The international look, already?

 There?s nothing quite like a spot of out-of-power to improve politicians. It has worked wonders for Amit Jogi, at any rate. He spends most of his time these days in Marwahi, the assembly seat his father gave up when he won the Lok Sabha elections and which Amit hopes to win. He no longer goes to five-star hotels or orders walnut cakes from Delhi. Amit even seems to be trying to shed weight and if friends are to be believed, has stopped thinking about dinner while eating lunch. But will all this impress the voters? Let?s weight and watch.

 You take down my portrait, I take down yours ? seems to be the direction in which the oneupmanship game between the UPA and the NDA is headed. If Mani Aiyar had a Veer Savarkar plaque removed from Cellular Jail, George Fernandes had Sonia Gandhi?s removed from the Speaker?s Hall at the Constitution Club. But does Fernandes, so full of spleen at the Nehru-Gandhis, know that Sonia?s portrait was put back as soon as he left the premises?

 Scribes in West Bengal recently found themselves horribly cornered in their own cosy corner at the Writers?. Ever since they had their room relocated to the other end of the corridor that also houses the CM?s quarters, the press has had a free run ? the endless cups of tea were on the house and so was the telephone which was ?freely? used. Now the phone is not working. An inquiry revealed that the arrears amounted to some Rs 50,000. The telecom department has, quite expectedly, cut off the line. The question that has been bothering newshounds is could the department have acted without the knowledge of the media?s darling, Mr Buddha Bhattacharjee, who mans the show in the house? 

 It?s a sign of the times that while Final Solutions, the documentary on the Gujarat riots, has been passed by the censors, Prakash Jha?s biopic of Jayaprakash Narayan has run into troubled water. And why not? Of Bansi Lal, VC Shukla, Ambika Soni, Maneka Gandhi, the villains of that era in the public perception, the first two have just returned to the Congress fold, the third is an important party functionary while Varun Gandhi is said to be knocking at the doors of the family enterprise. Add to that the presence of a Jaipal Reddy, defensive about his socialist past, at the helm in the I amp;B ministry, and JP didn?t have much of a chance. Why blame Reddy when even Laloo Prasad Yadav, among JP?s most vocal followers, is busy finding fault with Jha for his knack for courting controversy, needlessly. Did he not name the main villain in his film, Gangajal, after his brother-in-law Sadhu Yadav? Indeed, UPA or NDA, the more things change, the more they remain the same.

 Give the babus an inch, and they want a mile. The Centre may have announced a Rs 661-crore bonanza for its employees, but IAS officers of the rank of add. secretary are unhappy at the PMO?s order fixing a 24-month tenure for the appointment of secretaries. This would stop the promotions of all those with less than two years to retire. The officers are hoping that like all government decrees, this one too will be observed more in the flouting.

 Laloo Prasad Yadav wants an image makeover. He feels that he and his party have been associated enough with the rustic-simpleton image. The RJD chief is now looking for someone who is articulate, telegenic, fluent in English and who will be better accepted in the drawing rooms of the educated city folk. In short, nothing less than the BJP?s Arun Jaitley or the Congress?s Kapil Sibal who will bat for Laloo at various forums and, more important, in front of the television cameras. Even his bet? noire, Mulayam Singh Yadav, has a string of celebrities, from Jaya Bachchan to Jaya Prada, rooting for him, besides, of course, the street-smart Amar Singh. The BSP boss, Mayavati, too has found a couple of sophisticated lieutenants, including a former advocate-general of Uttar Pradesh, recently. 

 Interested candidates may contact Prem Chand Gupta, Laloo?s confidant and the company affairs minister, for vetting.

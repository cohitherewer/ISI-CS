 Letters to Editor

 Unequal before law

 Sir ? Yet another example of globalization having an impact on local administration. The state chief minister promises personal attention in the case of the alleged molestation of a Polish tourist while the owner of Pink Giraffe doesn?t even rate a correct recording of his murder (?Polish woman cries molestation in city? and ?Eatery tenant beaten to death, Oct 25). Time for all good Calcuttans to seek NRI status. Would the good consuls resident in the city help? All for a good cause of course. A foreign citizenship will ensure that citizens do not have to resort to filing writs of mandamus in city courts to enforce action by the keepers of the law. This will reduce the case load of courts without the legislature resorting to contentious bills of dubious value ? bills that permit snipping off of ears and fines of Rs 10,000 for rape. Indeed, why wasn?t this Polish lady referred to the local shalishi court? 

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Datta, Calcutta 

 Poll pot

 Sir ? K.P. Nayar?s ?Peccadillo polls? (Oct 20) demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the American electorate. Nayar?s argument that Americans? preoccupation with Mary Cheney?s sexuality points to their obsession with ?trivia?, dismisses a serious social debate that has become a big-ticket issue in an ideologically-divisive election year. Mary Cheney is openly gay and deafeningly silent on her father?s role in an administration that seeks to limit her rights. The widely known yet systematically evaded fact of Mary?s sexuality has been insinuated in press briefings and stump speeches until John Kerry put an end to the whispering in the last presidential debate. By doing so, Kerry aggravated the thorn in the side of the Bush administration, which has been attempting to restrict the rights of homosexuals and to bar gay marriage. In the circumstances, how can Mary choose to remain gay and attend the Republican national convention? How can her father, as the steward of Bush?s policies, support an effort to limit constitutional protections for a portion of the American population, which includes his own child? Mary has become the poster girl for gay rights activists decrying the Bush administration?s hypocrisy and its overwhelming insertion of religion into politics and governance. The brouhaha over Mary points to a surge in political awareness and civic involvement missing from past elections. 

 In fact, Nayar?s charge that ?about half of America?s voting-age population couldn?t care less?, paints a completely misleading portrait of the level of political involvement during this year?s elections. According to recent Gallup polls, 12 per cent of registered voters and 51 per cent of 18- to 29-year-old voters say they will vote for the first time today. In fact, both Bush and Kerry camps have made a transparent bid for the youth vote by sending their children out on the campaign trail. But the sophistication of the Kerry children, the adorable Edwards? little ones and the trendy Bush sisters? cheeky political irreverence is a stark contrast to the icy and unreadable Mary. Who is Mary Cheney? And how does she reconcile the political with the personal? The question begs to be answered. And her answer, if she chooses to give one, will not be trivial. It will be a brave acknowledgement of the incongruities of being gay in America today and an exercise of those inalienable freedoms granted in the US to all, regardless of age, sex, race, religion, ethnicity, nationality and sexual preference.

 Yours faithfully,

Nabin Laskar, Charlotte, US

 Sir ? In all their campaign speeches, the Republicans spoke only of fear, whether of Yasser Arafat (a little exaggerated), or of al Qaida (justified), or of what Iraq was (not justified), and of the quagmire-like terrorist incubator that it has now become. During the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt declared that ?the only thing we have to fear is fear itself?. After Pearl Harbour, he led us to victory over Nazi Germany and the Japanese empire in three-and-a-half years. For the last three years, Bush has constantly told us to be afraid. Three years after 9/11, he has defeated nothing except our ability to have the world?s nations follow our lead. Kerry calls upon us to be stronger, smarter, fearless and united. I know whom I?ll vote for.

 Yours faithfully,

Jeffrey R. Mazor, Hollywood, US

 Sir ? India has many armchair conscience-keepers in the media. Lately, George W. Bush seems to have become their favourite whipping boy. These people were silent spectators when the taliban massacred the Afghans, and destroyed the thousand-year old Bamiyan Buddhas. We didn?t hear them when Saddam Hussein killed his adversaries ruthlessly. In fact, Bush and Tony Blair have saved millions of people. Funnily, these hypocrites supported Indira Gandhi when she sent troops to liberate East Pakistan. Bush and Blair should know there are millions of people on this part of the globe who think that they should lead their countries so that people remain assured of free society all over the world. Extremists in any garb cannot be supported.

 Yours faithfully,

Padatik Roy, Jasidih 

 Sir ? The residents of Chino Valley, who foiled plans by Americans of Indian origin to build a temple on the grounds that the ?third world? would descend on their peace haven, displayed a parochialism typical of the American mid-west (?Temple in US raises ?Third World? horror?, Oct 6). It is a disturbing display of intolerance resulting from blinkered vision of the world beyond. It is the reason Sikhs were targeted after 9/11 simply for sporting beards and turbans. The clubbing of the lesser worlds with all the ills that are presently taking a toll on ?the great American way of life?, cannot be avoided unless the Americans are presided over by someone in the Oval office who has the magnanimity, humanity and understanding of the world that lies beyond the US.

 Yours faithfully, 

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? The US is the most powerful nation in the world today, but do we have to make such a to-do about today?s elections in that country? 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Patnaik, Cuttack

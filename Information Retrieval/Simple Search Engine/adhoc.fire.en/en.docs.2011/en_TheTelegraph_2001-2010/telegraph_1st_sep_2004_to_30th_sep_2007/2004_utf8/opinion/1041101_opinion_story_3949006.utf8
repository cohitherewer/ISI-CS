 WORRIED AT LAST

 It is human to avoid problems. One of the signs of the government?s humanity is its reluctance to confront ugly issues, allowing them to get uglier and infinitely more complicated. The home secretary has recently conveyed the state government?s decision to ?collect data? from non-governmental organizations, the police and local administrative bodies about the trafficking of women. A sudden ?jitteriness? at the scale of the problem seems to have brought the government to this state of surrender. It is pitifully short of illumination, about a phenomenon that has not only persisted but has grown alarmingly over the years. So now it needs the help of NGOs for data that will make up the total picture. The latter organizations would attest that the phenomenon is not new. The government?s declared awareness is.

 Trafficking is a form of organized crime inextricably tied up with poverty and need. To say that in all cases girls are lured away with promises of lucrative jobs and dream marriages is an over-simplification. There is real ignorance in a lot of cases, but there is also a deliberate avoidance of the truth or even full knowledge on the part of the family or guardians in many others. The only solution for this is economic betterment. Besides, West Bengal not only provides source areas for trafficked women but is also a smooth corridor for women from Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries being taken to distant parts of India, to Pakistan and to west Asia. A methodical clampdown by the state would be a serious obstacle in this route, but for that, the government must know fully what it is taking on. Then there is the enormous problem of the return home after rescue and reestablishment, materially and psychologically, in the life that had been left behind. Social awareness, counselling and career options are as necessary as the cutting down of red tape in the matter of transferring girls from rescue shelters to their homes, whether in this country or in a neighbouring one.

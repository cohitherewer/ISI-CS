 Letters to Editor

 Crossing the bar

 Sir ? It is true that Muslims largely are not taking the mainstream route, because of illiteracy among other reasons. But summarily dismissing them as being unwilling to accept Indian culture is not quite right. Sunanda K. Datta-Ray writes about the observance of the gaye halud ritual in Bangladesh (?Unnumbered heads?, Sept 25). But if you go to the villages of West Bengal, you will find lots of such instances of cultural infusion. My mother says, whenever someone touches rice with his foot by mistake, ?Maa Lokhhi, paa lagate nei? (It is goddess Lakshmi, don?t touch it with your feet). Although we do not worship idols, Nabanna is observed by Muslims in several places in West Bengal. In school, our religion never came in the way of organizing Saraswati puja. The truth is that modern educated Indians follow neither Hinduism nor Islam, but Americanism. 

 Yours faithfully,

 A bunch of chokers

 Sir ? Yet again, India lost a crucial match. That too, to Pakistan. While several theories are being forwarded, a dispassionate analysis would reveal that the single most important factor responsible for the loss was non-performance by the captain. Take one look at the statistics, and you will find that while Brian Lara, Stephen Fleming, Ricky Ponting, Michael Vaughan, Marvan Atapattu, Inzamam-ul-Haq have contributed more frequently to their teams? success than Sourav Ganguly has. On how many occasions in the last two years has our so-called lucky captain performed with the bat when his team needed it the most? His bowling is also on the wane and the less said about his fielding, the better. He is no Mike Brearley as a captain either, only a paper tiger.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? What can you say of a team in which the ICC-adjudicated ?best batsman of the year? comes in at number five and the bowler recognized as the ?emerging talent of the year? by the ICC gets to bowl only 9 of his allotted 10 overs? That they topped the batting and bowling figures respectively in that match against Pakistan last Sunday is a tribute to their skills as well as their combative spirit. Perhaps our Captain Courageous did not want to ?expose? young Pathan, so he himself came on to bowl. For Yusuf Youhana, whom Pathan had repeatedly dismissed during the recent Pakistan tour, this provided the much-needed break. The result: a cool, calculated match-winning 81. 

 Rohan Gavaskar, the player with the most impressive surname in Indian cricket, should now realize that his moment in the sun has come and gone. Not that he was ever impressive enough to deserve an India cap. And what about Kumble? At a time when he is bowling at his best ever ? a fact acknowledged by the skipper himself ? he finds no place in a crunch match! His absence was felt even more, since Tendulkar the bowler was unavailable. I have a question for Sourav Ganguly: ?Do you keep a track of your losses ? If yes, could you kindly ponder over your win/loss record barring Bangladesh, Kenya and Zimbabwe??

 Now that it has been proven without a doubt that without Tendulkar this is a team of nine pygmies and two giants in Dravid and Pathan, a little humility and introspection may well be in order.

 Yours faithfully,

Imtiaz Chowdhry, Calcutta

 Sir ? The dismal performance of the Indian cricket team at Edgbaston against arch rivals, Pakistan ? their third defeat in a row ? has exposed the psychological weakness of the team. This was India?s chance to show that they can perform without Sachin Tendulkar. They failed spectacularly. In contrast, look at the way the West Indian ninth wicket partnership added 71 runs to the score and wrested victory from the jaws of defeat. India, on the other hand, has made a fine art of clinching defeat from the jaws of victory.

 Yours faithfully,

Anjanabha Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir ? The recently-concluded ICC trophy in England was nothing short of a farce. With teams like the United States of America, Bangladesh, Kenya and a depleted Zimbabwe, the excitement that a cricket tournament generates was no longer there. If the aim of the ICC is to promote cricket around the world, it is certainly not going to happen by placing the top international teams with the rookies. Kenya, which reached the semi-finals of the last World Cup in 2003, have not played competitive cricket for 18 months before the Champion?s Trophy. We just saw what being out of the game for 18 months does to a team with potential. 

 The minnows should be made to play competitive cricket amongst themselves for some more time. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Troubling silence

 Sir ? This is with reference to Rudrangshu Mukherjee?s article, ?Child?s play? (Sept 19). I would like to know why is Arundhati Roy, who fulminates against the violence of the United States of America, silent about Beslan?

 Yours faithfully,

Julie Bose, Dehra Dun

 THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER STORY

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 Barkha Dutt has it so right. She is visibly moved as she speaks about the bereft children of Nagapattinam, as she pleads with businessmen in Mumbai for help, as she shares her experiences with her colleagues in other tsunami-devastated spots in India. 

 She isn?t trying to hide her emotions and be ?objective? as reporters are supposed to be. She isn?t even trying to score points by showing up administrations struggling to get their relief act together. She appears overwhelmed by the magnitude of the disaster ? and that is how it should be.

 Compassion is what the millions struggling to piece their lives together need right now ? from governments, from relief workers, and also from journalists whose adrenaline seems to flow only when they roam from one disaster to another. Human misery of this magnitude cannot be, ought not to be, just another story.

 Of course we need them to tell us about the horrendously tragic losses as well as the uplifting tales of heroic escapes and human values. (Heart-rending stories that are prising open wallets around the world ? though I am cynical enough to wonder what would have happened if the seabed had heaved in, say, July when foreign tourists do not throng the beaches around here.)

 But sticking a mike in front of a bereaved mother or confronting exhausted rescue workers with searching questions can appear voyeuristic and exploitative unless handled with great sensitivity. And for that you have to have genuine concern. Sans that empathy, all those reams of special reports, fancy graphics and competitive relief funds could appear to be tawdry sales gimmicks that cheapen a great tragedy. 

 Maybe that is why the blogs have been such an instant hit even in the times of 24x7 coverage. Fresh sites devoted solely to the disaster (eg tsunamihelp.blogspot.com started by Bombay bloggers Rohit Gupta and Peter Griffin) or existing sites given over to the tragedy (like Jaffna-based Fred Robart?s www.thiswayplease. com/extra.html) speak straight from the heart. On Sunday, Robart had posted the telling photograph of a blue car wrapped around a palm tree. On Tuesday, he promised ?the next photograph will be of something more positive?. Because ?everybody has stepped up?, and there are heartening examples of community values all around. Evidently, he is not into selling sorrow. 

 Honestly obliged

 Before the sea took away thousands, there was one death that also drew notice, but for different reasons. The death was of former prime minister Narasimha Rao but what was really noteworthy was the amazingly honest assessment of the modern-day ?Chanakya? that the media suddenly dished out. 

 Reports of the death itself were accompanied by comments that talked about the great liberalizer?s ?dark side,? pointed out his many failings, and even raised questions whether he would be remembered as India?s worst prime minister. For a media that swore by the ?speak no evil of the dead? dictum, this was a sensational departure indeed. 

 Contrast this with the fulsome praise former US president Ronald Reagan?s death received in the US media last June for one whole week and the difference could not be more spectacular. 

 India 1, US 0 would you say? Or, did the media in both countries take their cue from the reigning political climate to come up with such opposing results? Damning Rao was unlikely to be taken amiss by Sonia Gandhi, given the well-known differences between the two. Bush, on the other hand, was keen to wear the Reagan mantle as he rode into re-election. The media, in the first world or the third, had no problem in obliging the powers-that-be.

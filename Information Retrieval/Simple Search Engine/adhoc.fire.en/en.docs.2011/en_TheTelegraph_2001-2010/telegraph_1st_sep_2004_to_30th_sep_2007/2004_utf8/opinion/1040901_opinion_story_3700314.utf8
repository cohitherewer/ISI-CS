 PLEASING POLICY

 The commerce ministry was set up in the beginning of World War II to ration imports. German U-boats were sinking the British merchant fleet and shipping capacity was constrained. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president of the United States of America, came to Britains succour with the lend-lease programme; Britain could import from the US without having to pay till the end of the war. But it could not import without limit; the British empire had to allocate dollar imports within set limits. It was to handle these rationing requirements that the commerce ministry and its executive arm, the chief controller of imports and exports, were set up. 

 India announced the removal of quantitative restrictions on imports on April 1, 2001. At that point, import rationing should have ceased and the commerce ministry should have disappeared. But it had long ago developed other business. Indian import duties were high; exporters should not have to pay them on imports embodied in exports. But they could not import without paying duty without limit. Their imports had to be tailored to their exports; that created scope for an ever more complex array of controls. These are what the commerce minister presides over; and on April 1 he announces major changes in them. 

 Mr Kamal Nath got the chance to announce his first policy yesterday. He begins his tenure with high ambition: doubling of Indias market share in world trade in five years. Assuming a 10 per cent growth in world trade, this requires Indian exports to grow at 16 per cent a year. Exporters who raise their exports at rates over 20 per cent will get special duty credits. Now that Mr P. Chidambaram, the inventor of service tax, is back, it is going to get more onerous, and service tax credit for exporters was overdue; Mr Nath has promised it. He remembered the stress of his government on agriculture and employment, and announced incentives for exports of the products of farms and labour-intensive industries. The minister obviously spent his three months in office in intense interaction with exporters. Many small changes are noticeable in the policy, which can only have emerged from attention to suggestions in detail. This user-friendliness in policy is to be welcomed. But it is an approach that can benefit only current exporters; potential exporters may have quite different, and sometimes opposite needs. Simplifying red tape is always a good idea. But the red tape is necessary only because the government levies import duties that have to be rebated on exports. It would fall aside if the duties were not there. At a time when the government is concerned about inflation, it would be a good idea to reduce as many duties to zero as possible especially on industrial inputs. That is in the finance ministers bailiwick, but it is to be hoped that the commerce minister will keep up unrelenting pressure on him to reduce duties.

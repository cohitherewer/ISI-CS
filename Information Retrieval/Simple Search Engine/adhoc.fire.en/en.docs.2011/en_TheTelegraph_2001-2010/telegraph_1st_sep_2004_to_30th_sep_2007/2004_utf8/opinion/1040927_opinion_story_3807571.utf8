 LOSING GROUND

 It is difficult to change the culture of a city by law. But the Calcutta high court is adamant. It wants the Brigade Parade Grounds to be maintained in a ?condition so that parade can take place at any time of the year?. So the court has ruled against any kind of construction on the grounds, and people carrying weapons or even party flags will not be allowed entry. This effectively rules out not only fairs, but also, and much more importantly, political meetings and rallies. The point of the ruling is, of course, civic and environmental. The city needs a well-maintained open green, not so much for parades, as for the normal and healthy outdoor activities of its citizens. But the reactions have been immediate, and the main grievance is political. A ruling which makes it impossible to hold rallies on the grounds can only be an infringement of the ?democratic rights of the people?. Although this opinion has been expressed by a member of the Forward Bloc, most political parties seem to be of this opinion. But the principal objector has been the ruling Left Front, encouraged by none less than Mr Jyoti Basu. But Ms Mamata Banerjee and the mayor seem to be equally outraged.

 First, there is no point invoking tradition in this matter. But sentimentalizing or politicizing a long history of damaging and inconvenient disruptiveness and lawlessness in the name of democratic rights can only result in the general degradation of a city?s political culture. The people of Calcutta are just as much entitled to a clean, healthy and orderly environment in which they can go about their lives with a minimum of hindrance. This, too, is a democratic entitlement. Everything that is wrong with Calcutta, from a civic and environmental point of view, can be made out to be part of a cherished tradition. But this is no justification for its perpetuation. The court has been fighting a long and thankless battle on behalf of most Calcuttans with regard to the deeply entrenched culture of bandhs and rallies in the city. A city in which the high court often throws up its arms in despair, having tried in vain to legislate against party-political disorderliness, must not have reached a certain minimal level of civic consciousness. And the police, who must actively implement such rulings, are the least likely to cooperate.

 STILL BARKING

 The left has had its way and the LPG price hike has been partly rolled back. But the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is still barking and wants the diesel price-hike of November 4 to be reduced as well because global oil prices have softened. As is normal, the CPI(M) is mixing up issues. Change in global oil prices should be mirrored in changes in domestic prices of petroleum products, provided the administered price mechanism ends. But no one wants the APM to go, except for petrol. What muddies matters further is the lack of obvious correlation between global crude-oil prices and domestic prices of petroleum products. Indirect taxes and refining margins confuse the link. The import parity principle was accepted for petrol and diesel, but not for liquefied petroleum gas or kerosene. And even for the former category, decisions were indefinitely postponed. Yet the principle is simple. If sale prices are lower than costs of production (import costs plus taxes plus refining costs), there is a subsidy, and someone must meet the difference. There can be a case for subsidizing a poor household?s consumption, but is there a case for subsidizing a product regardless of who consumes it? For instance, why subsidize kerosene if it is smuggled across the border to Bangladesh ? surely, international fraternal feeling does not require this ? or used to adulterate petrol?

 Why subsidize LPG if car-owners substitute unsafe and subsidized LPG for relatively safer, but more expensive, compressed natural gas? Subsidization of the poor is best done through direct cash transfers, not by messing up product prices. Even if the latter is attempted, it is best done by identifying the poor and subsidizing their consumption, while preventing leakage. Across-the-board subsidization is not the answer. That is partly the reason why LPG cylinder prices were increased by Rs 20 on November 4, a decision that still stands, notwithstanding the left?s protests. But that still leaves a subsidy of Rs 138 per cylinder, and this was supposed to be wiped out through monthly increases of Rs 5. 

 This increase decision has now been rolled back, because of the imminent winter session and state-level elections. Even if softening in global prices means that the subsidy is now less than Rs 138, there is no denying that it is Rs 125 plus. The government bears this cost by compensating public-sector refining companies (oil pool account by another name) and the poor bear this cost by incurring opportunity costs of missed government expenditure or through deficits and inflation. The relatively poor cross-subsidize the relatively rich. The left may bark in the name of the poor, but it ends up biting the poor.

 HEART LESS

 Weighing-scales are disreputable in India; they are tricked out to give one side advantage over another. So it is not surprising that the uneven balance of the scales in real life should affect the abstract scales of justice as they balance the rights and wrongs within society. If the police are occasionally inconvenienced with an arrested rapist on their hands, for example, they often think that the best way out is to get the criminal married off to the victim, if he happens to be just a ?local boy?. The Amherst Street police station recently hosted such a shotgun wedding within its precincts, where the offender had been remanded to police custody for 14 days. The incarcerated young man?s girlfriend had brought a complaint that after she was pregnant, her boyfriend first suggested that she end her pregnancy, and when she refused, demanded dowry in cash and a room in the girls? natal home. He was arrested and booked under sections 420 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code, that is, for cheating and rape. But the bizarre twist was given by the police, who persuaded him that if he married the girl now she would let him off. Else he could be looking at up to seven years? imprisonment. But a newly-married girl would be unlikely to persist with a case against her husband and her unborn child?s father.

 That is the way this kind of comfortable social justice works, no matter how helpful the actual law is. In this case, it has erased the facts of fraud, cruelty, blackmail and a total lack of feeling on the part of the man. The victim?s willingness to marry him under the present circumstances suggests the various social and economic pressures to which she is being subjected ? it is easier to marry the father of her child than continue with the case. No one asks what kind of a husband or father such a man would make, or whether a marriage based on mutual disrespect should be consciously sponsored by society: the questions are irrelevant. It is worse when there is no previous relationship between the criminal and the victim, and the rapist is made to marry the victim by local leaders and the police. Here the complete erasure of the reality of violence and fury that lies behind rape is as terrifying as its enforced linking with an act of love. Justice works in strange and convoluted ways when a woman is concerned; the first thing society tends to do when an appeal is made to the law is to try and tie up loose ends before the male offender can be brought to trial.

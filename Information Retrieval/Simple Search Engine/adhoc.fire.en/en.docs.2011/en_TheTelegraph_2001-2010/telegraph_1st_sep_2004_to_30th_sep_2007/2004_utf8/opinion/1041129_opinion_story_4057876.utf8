 NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN

 Excerpts from the World Conservation Union?s Red List of Threatened Species, 2004

 Trends in the status of threatened species: The Red List Indices show that the status of birds and amphibians continues to deteriorate...For birds the RLI demonstrates that their status has deteriorated steadily since 1988, which was the year that birds were first completely assessed. A preliminary assessment of amphibians demonstrates similar rates of decline since 1980. However, amphibian species closest to extinction have shown a much steeper rate of decline in status.

 ...Population trends are available for 260 Cycads (Cycadopsida, 288 species in total), and of those, 79.6 per cent (207 species) are declining, 20.4 per cent (53 species) are stable and none are considered to be increasing.

 Geography of the Red List ? Most threatened species occur in the tropics, especially on mountains and on islands. Most threatened birds, mammals, and amphibians are located on the tropical continents: Central and South America; Africa, south of the Sahara; and tropical south and southeast Asia. These realms contain the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests that are believed to harbour the majority of the earth?s living terrestrial and freshwater species. Therefore, the patterns evident for mammals, birds and amphibians are likely to be representative of most terrestrial taxonomic groups.

 The distribution of threatened marine species is poorly known...initial findings indicate that threatened marine mammals are concentrated in the northern Pacific Ocean and threatened seabirds, chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, rays and chimeras) and seahorses...in the eastern Indian Ocean and southwest and west-central Pacific.

 The uneven distribution of threatened species means that a number of countries have a disproportionate number of species at risk of extinction...Countries with a high number of threatened and threatened endemic species include Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia and Mexico. Other countries or territories holding particularly large numbers of threatened species include Colombia, India, new Caledonia, Peru, South Africa, and Vietnam...Additional countries characterized by particularly high proportionate threat in multiple taxa include Madagascar, S?o Tom? and Principe, and the Seychelles.

 Patterns of distribution of threatened species are relatively congruent between the taxonomic groups analysed. Differences are primarily driven by underlying range-size distributions among taxonomic groups (e.g., birds tend to have much larger range sizes than amphibians) and by ecological limitations of specific taxa (e.g., birds are better able to disperse over saltwater than amphibians).

 A KERRY IN EVERY BUSH

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 In Bush-land, where ?you are either with us or against us,? it all depends on which paper you are reading, which channel you are watching, which website you are scrolling down. If you get the New York Times or watch CNN or ABC or go to salon.com, you will have no doubts that John Kerry won all three debates hands down or that he was the more ?presidential? of the two. If you pick up the New York Post or Washington Times or switch to Fox News or scan blogs like Power Line, the president simply ?KO-ed? Kerry in the second and third debates, ?just slaughtered him?. In a closely fought election, the media too is deeply and bitterly divided.

 So sharp are the differences that a lot of its energies are going not just in covering the rival campaigns but in ?exposing? each other. There are so many stories on the media that you begin to wonder who the real contenders are in this election season. Whether it is the CBS Evening News ?exclusive? on Bush?s service records that turned out to be fake or the caricature of John Kerry by Fox News as a ?metrosexual? who enjoys getting manicures, complete with fabricated quotes, or the memo written by ABC?s political director to his reporters to probe the Bush camp?s ?distortions? about Kerry, or Sinclair Broadcast Group?s plans to show, just a week before the presidential election, an hour-long film that portrays John Kerry as betraying his fellow Vietnam soldiers, as ?news? on its 62 channels nationwide, several in crucial states like Florida and Wisconsin, the media has been making as much news as it has been breaking in the last three weeks. The fight is getting uglier by the day and is unlikely to end with the end of polling on November 2. Watch this space for updates.

 Paper count

 With the polls still in a dither, now is the time for all good newspapers to come to the aid of their candidate. Sunday saw a flood of newspaper endorsements that ranged from the stately New York Times (for Kerry) to the popular Chicago Tribune (for Bush) to the weekly Lone Star Iconoclast (Support Kerry, it has told its 425 or so subscribers in Crawford, Texas, George Bush?s hometown). In fact, if newspapers? votes were enough, the regime change in Washington would be a done thing by now. Challenger John Kerry has gained the editorial backing of more than 45 papers while incumbent George Bush has only around 30 papers rooting for him, the magazine, Editor and Publisher, reports. ?Kerry also has more large papers on his side,? it adds, ?maintaining his ?circulation edge? at nearly 3-1, with approximately 8.7 million circ to Bush?s 3.3 million.? But will this make a difference? A CNN poll showed 88 per cent have neither any clue nor any interest in who their paper supports.

 Our president too

 It?s so patently unfair. Even a mountain goat in the Himalayas will be affected by the elections in America (it may mean more or less carbon monoxide in the air), but all we non-Americans can be are mute witnesses. Enough to drive one to desperate acts. Like the scheme hatched by Britain?s Guardian newspaper last week. This virulently anti-Bush paper has adopted one county, ?which is balanced on a razor?s edge between Republicans and Democrats? in the crucial state of Ohio, and is asking people across the world to write to voters there to persuade them to vote to defeat George Bush. At least three have written already: scientist Richard Dawkins and writers John Le Carr? and Antonia Fraser. But the traffic from the other side of the Atlantic has been far heavier. They say: KEEP OFF. And not so politely either. How small-minded can the Americans be? After all, their president is our president too, wherever in the world we may be.

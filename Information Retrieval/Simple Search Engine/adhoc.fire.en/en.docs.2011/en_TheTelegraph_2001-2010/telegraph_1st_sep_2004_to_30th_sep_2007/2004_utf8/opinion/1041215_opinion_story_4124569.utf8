 Letters to Editor

 Think out of the box

 Sir ? Ruchir Joshi?s ?Turning red? (Dec 12) expresses the disgust of millions of television viewers who are subjected to what Joshi aptly calls ?carpet bombing? by television advertisements. If someone were to take into account commercial-induced rise in blood pressure and related health hazards, especially during cricket telecasts, an interesting statistics might emerge. Joshi?s disillusion with the sorry situation is quite understandable but his suggestion of setting up an ?independent television standards body that regulates the ratio between programming and advertising? is unlikely to improve matters. The inspector raj is still a palpable reality in India. The only action that might have some effect is the summary boycott of the products whose advertisements have been causing distress to viewers. Only a drastic drop in sales can discipline the companies.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Eagle-eye view

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra?s ?A gleam in the eye? (Dec 10) misleads the reader about the causes of India?s rather uneven economic growth. He castigates widely respected international agencies like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund without remembering that if they hadn?t bailed out India a decade back, its balance of payments, and thereby its economy, would have been in a mess. Second, India survived the 2003-04 drought to post an 8.1 per cent growth rate. As a similar agricultural boom is impossible to repeat without another drought, it is natural that the growth rates came down to 6.5-7 per cent at the start of this fiscal year. When unforeseen events like the hike in international crude prices and the uneven monsoon hit the economy, the growth rates had to be naturally revised again. Thus there is no conspiracy behind India?s growth figures. The same kind of revision happens in the left?s holy land ? China. 

 The growth rate of 10 per cent should not shock Mitra. The east Asian tigers sustained such growth rates for decades. India can do the same, and despite the left, not because of it. Mitra may be right in saying that the manufacturing sector employs the most people. But has he questioned why other sectors don?t? Poor infrastructure, age-old labour regulations, patronage to small and medium enterprises, licence raj and high taxes strangle the other sectors. Mitra?s mockery of India?s IT sector is a slap on the face of the hardworking men and women in this industry. Indian IT is here to stay and the world is taking note of it. Does Mitra realize that his cries of foreigners whisking money abroad have long been discredited? What about the fat profits Indian companies bring home? Also, if a foreign company makes profits and expands in India, it not only employs more people but also fuels the economy. On the other hand, the increased disposable income of the new workers means more demand in the economy, which means increased output, and growth.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The gloom in Ashok Mitra?s article is stifling. But his pronouncements that massive growth in the services sector will still leave millions of those who are dependant on the agricultural sector cold are contrary to the picture we see all over the developed world. The growth capacity of the farm sector is limited and agriculture has nowhere contributed significantly to a developed economy. It is imperative that India too stop laying stress on its agricultural economy. Incidentally, in many of the prosperous countries, the services sector employs as much as 50 per cent of the population. Only this sector has the potential to raise the people of this country out of poverty. And without IT, the services sector will be a lame duck. IT itself may not have sufficient employment potential, but its back-up support to the services sector, as to all sectors, cannot be under-valued.

 Yours faithfully,

A.C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? For once, things have been put in the proper perspective. The so-called economic wizards have long been suspected of manipulating figures to suit their interests. Ashok Mitra only shows how. We need more people to show the illogic of India?s ?projected? economic growth. Yes, certain sectors will grow, and certain pockets will have more money, but only at the cost of those rural millions who already have nothing but their lives to spare.

 Yours faithfully, 

 M. Srivastava, Calcutta

 Flying over

 Sir ? Whenever a flyover is unveiled in Calcutta, the chief minister assures us of another. There is not an iota of doubt that he will deliver one, but the problem lies elsewhere. Almost all the projects executed by the Left Front bear the stamp of some deficiency or the other, particularly where design is concerned. Which is why not as many have benefited from these projects as ought to have. Take the flyovers over Gariahat or A.J.C. Bose Road. They have been unable to prevent traffic snarls and the problem will only aggravate. One can confidently say the same thing about the Park Street flyover as south-bound traffic will continue to halt at the crossing with Middleton Street. Such schemes should be put in the public domain for a free flow of opinion before they are finalized. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Ananda Biplab Chanda, Calcutta

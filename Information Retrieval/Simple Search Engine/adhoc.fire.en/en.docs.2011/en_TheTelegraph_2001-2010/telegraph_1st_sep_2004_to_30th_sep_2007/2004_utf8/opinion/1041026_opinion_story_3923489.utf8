 PROMISE OF PEACE 

 Rituals can sometimes capture the real thing. If the self-exiled Naga rebels pray in Nagaland?s churches during the next Christmas, it may well be a turning point in the Naga peace talks. The latest round of talks between the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Thuingaleng Muivah and Mr Isak Chisi Swu, and New Delhi?s emissaries in Bangkok has ended in a new hope. By accepting the Centre?s invitation to come to India in December, the two leaders have sent out a welcome signal both for the peace talks and for the people of Nagaland. Their passage to India may not mean the coming of lasting peace in that troubled state, but it will add significantly to the peace rites. It will also be a great leap forward for the rebels who once insisted on having the talks only in a ?third? country. Obviously, the NSCN leaders would not have accepted the invitation if they were not satisfied with New Delhi?s commitment to an early and peaceful end to the 55-year-old Naga insurgency. And the Centre, too, must have accepted the NSCN?s commitment to the seven-year-old ceasefire in Nagaland as proof of its genuine desire for peace. 

 Difficulties, though, remain on the road to peace. The biggest of them is the NSCN?s demand for an integration of all Naga-inhabited areas into a greater Nagaland. Such areas are part of several other states such as Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. It is not just a question of geography; the political impact of an integration of these areas into present-day Nagaland may be unsettling for the whole of the North-east. At the same time, this is crucial to the NSCN?s idea of the Nagas? identity as a racially and culturally distinct people. There is no denying that the creation of the northeastern states out of old Assam was arbitrary. But it could prove extremely difficult to redraw these states? boundaries without inciting violent ethnic rivalries. Both New Delhi and the NSCN need to take the present situation in the region into account in tackling this sensitive issue. By contrast, the other contentious issue of ?sovereignty? of the Nagas may prove easier to handle. The NSCN has indicated that its idea of sovereignty does not mean secession from India. Even if the two sides have different approaches to these issues, the talks so far indicate a common agenda for peace. The important thing is not to let the problems outweigh the promise of peace.

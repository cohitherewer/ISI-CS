 NOT THE FINAL OVER

 Uddalak Mukherjee

 During Australia?s recent tour in India, the batsmen of both the teams decided to ?walk? without waiting for the umpire?s decision when they thought that they had nicked one to a fielder. While cricket-lovers were pleased with the camaraderie on show, very few spared a thought for the poor umpires. A majority of on-field decisions, today, are taken with the aid of technology. And if batsmen decide to don the role of umpires, it wouldn?t take long for Messrs Shepherd and Co to find that their jobs are on the line.

 There is no doubt that technology has minimized the percentage of human errors in cricket. But it has also presented umpires in poor light, by showing that even the very best make costly mistakes. And with the International Cricket Council encouraging the use of technology to rid the game of errors, umpires are now increasingly playing second fiddle to devices like the Hawkeye. In the 14 matches played in the group and the semi-final stages of the ICC Champion?s Trophy in Colombo, the umpires made use of such gadgets on no less than 57 occasions. 

 Not just this. Newer and continuously evolving forms of technology like the Snickometer and Hawkeye are familiar features in cricket today. This has raised the fearful proposition of the game being played without umpires in the future.

 Human touch

 There are very good reasons for not striking out umpires from cricket. Some of the new technologies introduced are far from perfect. Worse, they are often inconclusive. For instance, the predictive curve, used by the Hawkeye to judge lbws, is unreliable. Recent studies have also shown that umpires beat the savvy Snickometer consistently, when it came to judging a close edge.

 Umpires give the game a distinct flavour. Very few moments can match the drama and excitement of that when an umpire raises the dreaded finger in a slow, teasing manner after an appeal. Some umpires are also, what is known in cricketing parlance, ?characters?. Their physical attributes and idiosyncrasies have become part of cricketing lore. Imagine cricket without David Shepherd?s antic of hopping about when the score of the batting team reaches ?unlucky? 111, or the theatrical gestures of Billy Bowden. Not to forget our very own Swaroop Kishen, whose ample girth, according to a former great, made it difficult for bowlers not to collide with him while running in to bowl. Banishing these men for the sake of accuracy would make the game a dull affair. 

 Second fiddle

 There are other problems as well. For instance, the continuous referrals to the third umpire during a match often disrupt the flow of the game. However, the demands of the mo-dern game are such that one cannot abjure the use of technology. The only manner in which umpires can remain relevant to cricket is by upgrading their skills. 

 In this respect, the ICC needs to hold skill-enhancing workshops more frequently. The appointment of the former Surrey player and coach, Keith Medley, as the ICC?s umpires? high performance manager is, therefore, a significant step. Cricket officials must also think along the lines of chopping some deadwood in favour of fresh faces in the ICC?s elite panel to minimize errors.

 Technology is a tool that is meant to assist human beings. But it can never be allowed to lord over its creator. If this holds true of other aspects of human life, why should there be a different rule for the game of cricket? Technological innovations are welcome as long as they help umpires do a better job. But it would be a pity if machines, rather than men, start taking decisions on the cricket field.

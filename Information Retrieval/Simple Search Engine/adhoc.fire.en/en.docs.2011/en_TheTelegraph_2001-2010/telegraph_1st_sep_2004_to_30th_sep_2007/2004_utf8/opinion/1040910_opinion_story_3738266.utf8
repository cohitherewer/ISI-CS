 RAT IN THE WRONG

 The little mouse in the fable freed the great elephant by chewing through the knots in its huge net. But the rat that wandered into the substation that fed electricity to the Salt Lake stadium, where the India-Japan return match in the World Cup qualifiers was being played, had greater success. It managed to plunge the stadium into unexpected darkness for almost half-an-hour. It had made its mark, posthumously, on the international stage. For soccer-lovers in Bengal, this was a day of double shame. At least they have grown used to watch their team lose, and 4-0 was a better figure than the earlier 7-0 any day. But the day had been special for them for another reason. Calcutta was hosting an international team in a game of soccer, it wanted to put on its best show. The interruption was an acute embarrassment. The gracious remarks of the guests did nothing to alleviate the Calcuttans? sense of shame.

 As ministers registered discomfiture and Mr Priya Ranjan Das Munshi scuttled up and down to placate the Fifa match commissioner, officials of the state electricity board took things with enviable calm. They felt that they had averted a frightful disaster by quick thinking, and were rather surprised at all this excitement. A rat had incinerated itself on one of the cables, and the substation was beginning to smoke. What could they do but shut off the feeder and find the source of the smoke? They had made all arrangements for a smooth game, but rats are unstoppable. Given the culture of casualness and lack of accountability on which such officials have been bred, they are genuinely incapable of anticipating the obvious question: what fall-back arrangements did they have for any emergency failure at all, including suicidal rats? In case they have not noticed, power cuts are back in Calcutta in any case. True, these can happen anywhere in the world, but somehow, with the rat and the casualness, this incident is typically Calcutta. It is to be hoped that the chief minister?s dreams of turning the state around will not be undercut by rats in cables.

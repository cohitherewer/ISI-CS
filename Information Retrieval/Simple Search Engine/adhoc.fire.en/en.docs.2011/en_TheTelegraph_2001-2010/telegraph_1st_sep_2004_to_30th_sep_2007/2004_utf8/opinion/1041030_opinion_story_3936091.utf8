 IN THEIR HANDS

 Early next week, the oldest democracy of the modern world will elect its president. The presidential election in the United States of America is perhaps the most significant election in the contemporary world. No other hustings appropriates so much media space and on no other election hinges the fate and the future of the world. This has nothing to do with the size, physical or demographic, of the US. It has to do with the enormous clout that the US enjoys in the world. The president of the US is without doubt the single most powerful person in the world. His attitudes, his priorities and his policy initiatives will have an impact not only on the people of the US but also on other countries and their populations. A US presidential election thus has global repercussions. The elections to be held on November 2 have generated a little more than the usual heat and controversy because of the incumbent president who is seeking election to a second term.

 Mr George W. Bush?s presidentship began on a tumultuous note and continued on a similar pitch through his tenure. Mr Bush, it will be recalled, won on a very narrow margin and many believed that the margin had been manipulated and that he had actually lost. But this controversy was nothing compared to what followed: the devastation of 9/11; draconian domestic laws to weed out terrorists; the bombing of Afghanistan; the failure to capture Osama bin Laden; the war against Iraq; the failure to find weapons of mass destruction; allegations of intelligence failure and fabrication of evidence. All this was compounded with certain not-so-pleasant facts pertaining to the domestic economy. US businesses today are employing 900,000 fewer people than they did when Mr Bush took office. Employment in industries outside the services sector is down by 2.6 million. Wages are also falling in real terms.

 If all this sounds like a recipe for an electoral disaster for Mr Bush then the impression is wrong. Mr Bush is still a notch ahead of his closest rival, the Democratic candidate, Mr John Kerry. It will not be an exaggeration to suggest that Mr Kerry has failed to capitalize on the growing disillusionment about Mr Bush and his policies. There will be many eyebrows raised in surprise and much rejoicing if Mr Kerry pulls off a near-impossible victory. Mr Bush has not been the most convincing of presidents. The verdict, one way or the other, will be narrow ? and given last year?s experience, the verdict will also be genuine but many Americans will rue the fact that they were faced with such a poor choice. The choice the US voters make collectively will determine more than their own future. Many aspects of contemporary history will be affected by the decision made by US citizens.

 FORCED DOWN

 Sterilization already carries an ugly historical baggage in India. But in the country?s largest and most populous state, population control has become another means of reinforcing existing forms of social oppression. Both the sexes are victims in different ways, and in an inconceivably massive scale. Medical officials in three districts of Uttar Pradesh have recently announced a ?guns for sterilization? policy. According to this, a single-barrel shotgun could be obtained against two men sterilized, a revolver licence against five. Almost immediately, this policy has become a vehicle for feudal oppression. A rich farmer has allegedly had five of his farm labourers forcibly sterilized at a clinic in order to obtain a gun licence. A range of criminal methods, from deception to coercion, was used to sterilize these poor and illiterate men. All five have lodged complaints with the police and registered a case with a lawyer, but to little avail. UP?s sterilization target this year is 930,000, and the means of meeting this increasingly involve practices that dispense with even the most rudimentary elements of reproductive health as well as human rights.

 Poverty, backwardness and caste oppression, together with political apathy, massive corruption and a complete lack of governmental accountability, provide the background to the horrors of coercive sterilization in UP. A 2003 report on the state?s health services, based on government data, shows that 35,000 women were dying every year from maternity-related causes, without any reaction from the government. Around 40,000 women go through childbirth every year without trained attendants; 15,000 women become pregnant every year because of sterilization failure. Only 3.2 per cent women had been visited by any health-worker in a year?s time, and 4.4 per cent of pregnant women received complete check-up during pregnancy. The conditions in which men and women are sterilized are also uniformly appalling, and there is almost no pre-counselling or follow-up. The concept of reproductive choice is alien to such a scenario. And this must be compounded by the failure of literacy programmes in the state in which literacy among women is 42.98 per cent, and in some places as low as 21 per cent. In the absence of all mechanisms of accountability, invasive and potentially coercive methods of birth control become particularly dangerous means of oppression.

 Letters to Editor

 Picture imperfect

 Sir ? Samsung electronics, a leading camera-phone maker, has come up with a user guideline to ensure that customers use these gadgets more ?ethically? (?Code for camera phones?, Dec 22). But the chances of flouting the ?don?t?s? remain as high as ever ? there are no laws to tackle this menace as yet and neither has the use of camera-phones been banned from public places. And since when did Samsung become so virtuous? Wasn?t it the same company that used an advertisements featuring two models snapping pictures on the sly to hard sell its camera-phones?

 Yours faithfully,

Biplab Basak, Calcutta

 Just plea

 Sir ? The Andhra Pradesh high court rejected K. Venkatesh?s wish to die so that he could donate his organs on the grounds that he was not ?brain dead? (The Indian Penal Code allows donation of organs only for patients declared ?brain dead?). The court?s decision led to the prolonging of the patient?s misery ? Venkatesh, who was suffering from muscular dystrophy, had developed chronic pneumonia and most of his organs were malfunctioning by the time he died. 

 Under the circumstances, what is the harm if one wants to commit euthanasia? Couldn?t the court possibly have made an exception for Venkatesh who had no chance of recovery? Perhaps, it is time for the judiciary to look at the issue of euthanasia in a new light in order to alleviate the sufferings of terminally-ill patients. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Sen Gupta, Manirampore

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Right to Die? (Dec 19), correctly states that euthanasia is a complex phenomenon and that there are very good reasons for not legalizing it. Those who support euthanasia say that human beings should have the freedom to put an end to their lives. But one would like to ask, how then would euthanasia be different from suicide ? something which is deemed illegal in our country? If a terminally-ill patient loses his will to live, he should be subjected to regular counselling rather than bestowed with the right to take his own life. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Nirmala, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Andhra Pradesh high court was right in rejecting Venkatesh?s plea for voluntary death. No society, in its right mind, can allow a person to take his life legally. That is something that goes against humanity. There is also the possibility of abuse if such a provision were indeed brought into effect. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

 A name?s everything

 Sir ? Park Street was rechristened Mother Teresa Sarani and her bronze bust was unveiled at the Camac Street crossing recently. While the renaming of the street is welcome, one only hopes that the Calcutta municipal corporation makes arrangements to keep the mother?s statue clean. The statues of many leaders in and around the city are in a pitiable state ? covered with bird droppings and filth. The statues are cleaned only once a year, when it is time to celebrate the birth anniversaries of these famous faces. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 nSir ? Park Street is synonymous with all that is best in a metropolis ? glittering restaurants, fast cars and a relatively smooth road. The street?s footloose image is in sharp contrast with that of Mother Teresa, who was a picture of solemnity and austerity. The city fathers should have kept this in mind before changing the name. But is Subrata Mukherjee listening?

 Yours faithfully,

Debasish Chaterjee, Calcutta

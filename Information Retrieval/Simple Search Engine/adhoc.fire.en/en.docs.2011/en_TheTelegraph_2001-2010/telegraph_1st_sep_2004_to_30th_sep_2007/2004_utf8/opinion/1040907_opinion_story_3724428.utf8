 PULLING OFF THE SHUFFLE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The latest comic strip that tells us what the present priorities of the BJP/NDA are, is really quite funny Atalji taking step after painfully slow step followed by all his sycophantic band of fawning attendants doing the BJP shuffle, looking for a room in Parliament House for this ageing neta. They say he needs to sit near an easy exit! Wouldnt it be best to push him about fast and efficiently in a wheelchair? Comfortable and safe. 

 The next strip describes an event hosted by the former first foster family, whatever that is supposed to mean, to launch a book, a compilation of speeches that were edited and put together under the thematic, coalition politics. It was attended by a larger and more comprehensive group of old faithfuls and one unlikely person, Inder Gujral, who, for all his life, has professed to be fiercely anti-BJP. In recent years he has been very much a part of their gang. What a bizarre turnaround and one wonders why? Maybe Sonia Gandhi and her handling of the last election as well as the post-election script, has made some of these old men, creations of the Congress, hugely insecure and irrelevant. On an NDA platform, they can sit at the high table! Gujral continues to be fted by the NDA and probably relishes it. 

 Another strip shows the BJP/NDA members animatedly jumping up and down because one individual damned Veer Savarkar. If only they had been as energetic, agitated and active when in power, denouncing all that was going wrong with the polity, attacking Modi and the genocide in Gujarat, halting the fake shining-India campaign intended to bluff the public, et al. They were rather silent on all of that, proving that they were in fact supporting those horrors. Being so vociferous about the Savarkar issue only goes to prove how reactionary they are, how anti-democratic, how intolerant of any position and opinion that is contrary to theirs. 

 Caught napping

 Many has-beens in the Congress, particularly from Maharashtra, are indulging in the same chant. Blame game. They will not lose the election because of what Mani Shankar Aiyar has said about Savarkar, but because the ruling Congress alliance in the state has botched up governance there. The Congress in Maharashtra should stop being silly about why they are on the back foot in the state it is because of failures to deliver, economically, socially and politically. 

 To think Mayavati can go there, split the Dalit vote that is not with the Sena/BJP, and bring the election to a 50/50 situation speaks volumes about the ineptitude of Shindes party and his leadership. Irrelevancies of the worst kind seem to obsess the losers on both sides.

 The supreme indecency of Yashwant Sinha when he referred to Manmohan Singh as Shikandi the eunuch in the Mahabharata only proves Sinha does not deserve to be in the public domain. The reference to Sonia Gandhi as that Italian woman also shows up these Indian men and some women, uncouth in their speech, as the worst specimens of Indian society. The less we have to hear these people, the better. 

 Manmohan Singhs press conference on Saturday has put his detractors and a hostile press into a quandary. They have all been caught napping. Stupidly, they interpreted quiet grace and dignity to be weak traits. This, because of the bombastic and undignified public political rhetoric we had been assaulted with for the last many years. Our press had celebrated the BJP handouts, all the stuff that turned out to be unacceptable to the normal people of this country. They showed themselves up as being totally out of sync with the reality and, alas, in tandem with the rulers. The prime minister has exposed their assessment of him, in a single press encounter.

 BRING BACK THE OLD STING

 It is time for the feminist movement to revisit some issues and think of strategies to make health a fundamental right, writes Rajashri Dasgupta

 Battle-weary

 So who still thinks this is a post-feminist era? As I throw away some dusty files, I realize that the case for basic women?s health rights has to be made all over again. On issues of violence, greater investment in public health, on indiscriminate medicalization of women?s bodies, commercialization of healthcare and aggressive population policies ? these were battles the feminist movement contended with more than two decades ago. They now need to be fought again.

 In the domain of concepts, undoubtedly, some territory has been won, however grudgingly. Thanks to the women?s movement, there is an acceptance that a woman is not merely a womb and her role in society goes beyond motherhood. Today, there is a greater understanding of the fact that health is intrinsically linked to women?s larger social and economic reality and that violence ? rape, infanticide, dowry death and domestic violence ? has an adverse impact on women?s self-esteem and overall well-being. The Alma Mater in 1978 was a victory for health activists. At the global level, a holistic policy was envisaged that saw health as a matter of socio-economic development. It drew attention to the need to address the underlying causes of ill health and diseases. But the battle had just begun. 

 Fundamental to good health and well-being is economic, social and political justice. Women?s health has been adversely affected by the resurgence of the policies and politics of hate and exclusion, both at the national and international level. With neo-liberal policies dictating the current global economic restructuring, the poor have been further marginalized and food security undermined through cuts in welfare spending. The three richest officers of Bill Gates? Microsoft have more assets (upwards $140 billion) than the combined GNP of the 43 least-developed countries, and south Asia remains one of the most deprived regions in the world with 600 million below the poverty line.

 It?s this abysmal poverty that is inextricably linked to death and illness. According to the UN?s Food and Agriculture Organization, in 2001 the number of undernourished people in south Asia shot up to 798 million from 780 million in five years; WHO 2000 data for the same region shows 30 per cent of the children under five years are malnourished, and by some estimates, more than 10 million annual deaths of young children are directly or indirectly attributable to malnutrition. Closer home in West Bengal, women?s nutritional status is the worst in the country, with their 400-500 calorie intake far short of the recommended daily allowance, and 63 per cent suffering from anaemia. Despite various government policies, every second girl child below six in the state is malnourished.

 With the aim of linking these local, specific health concerns to global, universal issues, a zonal consultation was held in Calcutta on December 11 and 12. It was hosted by the West Bengal-based Swaastha, a women?s health network, and was part of the process that would lead to the 10th International Women and Health Meeting in Delhi in 2005. Apart from West Bengal, the December meet focused on regions not been covered sufficiently like Bihar, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, which have poor public health infrastructure.

 To prevent the IWHM from becoming an international, one-time event in the capital, Indian activists have started a democratic process of zonal consultations, which focuses on grassroots issues and the concerns of marginalized groups like religious minorities, Dalits and tribals. About six such consultations are being organized in different parts of the country. In the meet in Calcutta, there were personal testimonies of women who narrated how public health services had become increasingly inaccessible to them.

 The IWHM has its roots in the global women?s movement and includes a wide range of networks and women?s organizations. The meet on ?Health Rights, Women?s Lives: Challenges and Strategies for Movement Building? had wide-ranging themes built around public health, reproductive and sexual rights, politics of population policies, medical technologies affecting women?s rights and violence of the state and family. The objective is to learn from the lived experiences of women to provide direction for future struggles, policy and research. ?The idea is not merely to network and explode myths masquerading as data. The real challenge is to rebuild and strengthen the movement, ? said an IWHM organizer.

 Feminists are only too aware that governments? agendas are dictated by other priorities ? like increasing militarization. Pakistan spends almost 5 per cent of its GDP on the military, Sri Lanka spends an equally significant percentage on its army. A recent report by the International Institute of Strategic Studies said that India?s defence budget for a 1.2 million- strong military has gone up by 21 per cent. In actual figures it is Rs 586 billion, 30 per cent of which goes to procuring weapons, military research and development as the country embarks on large-scale development and deployment of missile systems.

 What is obvious is that funds are available, but not for development. In India, cuts in the social sectors have led to a decline in public health outlay ? 0.9 per cent of the GDP at the turn of the century from 1.3 per cent a decade ago, making it one of the lowest in the world. In contrast, the United States of America spends 50 per cent of its public expenditure on health. In other words, the majority of the poor in India, earning less than $ 2 a day, have to meet 80 per cent of the cost of their healthcare. So critical is the situation that the new government?s common minimum programme promised to increase the outlay on public health to at least two to three per cent of the GDP in the next five years.

 Following in the footsteps of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, left-ruled West Bengal, in the name of ?reforms?, has laid out the red carpet to private corporates in the name of promoting partnership in healthcare. Some services in public hospitals have already been entrusted to the private sector with the assurance of more. Given the low social and economic status of women, minorities and Dalits, their access to public health services is even more constrained. This requires the feminist health movement to revisit old issues and explode existing norms in order to re-organize and think of strategies to make health a fundamental right, just as the right to life and safety.

 The health movement faces the challenge of pulling together diverse strands as never before and at the same time dealing with the dangers of co-option and collaboration. Activists realize that the movement can progress and find common ground for solidarity globally only if it respects differences and diversity and can re-infuse the political sting of the earlier years. Otherwise, the territories gained and battles fought since the Seventies will be lost in an even more vicious backlash.

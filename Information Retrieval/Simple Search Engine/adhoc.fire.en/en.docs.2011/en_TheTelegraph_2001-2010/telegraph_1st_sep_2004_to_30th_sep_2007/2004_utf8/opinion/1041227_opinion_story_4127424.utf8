 REVOLUTIONARIES OF ANOTHER KIND 

Hugo Chavez has done much to improve the lot of poor 

Venezuelans but, in the process, he has also gathered many enemies, writes Achin 

Vanaik

 The lone ranger 

Fidel Castro?s mythic status among the poor in Latin 

America has been long secure, but it is Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, 

who is today the continent?s most charismatic figure. Unlike his counterparts 

elsewhere (barring Castro), Chavez is both a man of action and an intellectual. 

A voracious reader, Chavez made the inaugural address at the ?World Meeting of 

Intellectuals and Artists in Defense of Humankind? held in Caracas from December 

1 to 6, 2004, in which he referred to numerous writers, poets, philosophers and 

political thinkers from Lorca and Unamuno, to Russell, Diderot, Voltaire, Rousseau 

and Nietszche, to Marx, Trotsky and Leonardo Boff (of liberation theology fame). 

Unafraid to call Falluja the Guernica of our times, 

Chavez presents a dramatic contrast to the reticence of most other leaders in 

this area. He can, in a moment, go from coolly and rationally arguing that socialism, 

Bolivarianism and ?Christianism? are united by an essential commitment to social 

justice and to the poor, to emotionally declaring that the soul of Brazil lay 

in its shanty towns and that the soul of Latin America was indissolubly merged 

with Africanism. No wonder then that he has polarized Venezuelan society as never 

before.

Chavez is loathed by the country?s richest 20 per 

cent. They see him as a closet Communist and Fidelista who, by imposing capital 

controls, has prevented their capital from going abroad, as well as enforced far 

stricter tax-collection standards. American oil majors, backed by Washington, 

hate him. Oil extraction royalties, once pegged at 1 per cent, are now 17 per 

cent. The country?s petroleum industry (PDVSA) ? once a state within a state ? 

has been wrested away from the nexus of external oil companies and their domestic 

collaborating classes, and their patronage-client networks. For the first time 

in Venezuela?s history, ?oil for the people? has become a reality. The world?s 

fifth-largest oil producer has a shocking 44 per cent (at a conservative estimate) 

of its 25 million population below the poverty line. 

The government of the United States of America is 

even more incensed, not only because it has lost its Trojan Horse in the Organisation 

of Petroleum Exporting Countries but also because Chavez does not hesitate to 

forcefully and publicly denounce its imperial ambitions and its use of terrorism 

to fight terrorism. 

The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are 

fearful that Chavez?s neo-populist rejection of their neo-liberal dogmas could 

prove ?infectious?. Health and education are now constitutionally sanctioned fundamental 

rights, provided to the majority of the poor free of user charges. Pocket editions 

of the constitution are being printed on a large scale and distributed free so 

that people can become aware of their rights. There is a conscious policy of promoting 

greater food self-sufficiency (over 70 per cent of foodstuffs are currently imported 

despite abundant fertile land) through distributing land to tens of thousands 

of peasant families. There is also stress on the development of competitive public 

and cooperative sectors in light manufactured goods ? all anathema to the Bretton 

Woods twins.

Some 25 per cent of Venezuelans are broadly sympathetic 

to Chavez and another 25 per cent are wavering, while 30 per cent would die for 

him. Such passions, for and against, are a testimony to the fact that Venezuela 

is undergoing a genuine upheaval whose fate is uncertain though Chavez is politically 

at his peak. His resounding victory in the August 2004 referendum was followed 

in October by the capture in the elections of 21 of the country?s 23 states and 

270 of 335 municipalities. The military is firmly under his control as ever.

Chavez?s real political genius, however, has been 

in the way he has redefined Bolivarianism as the guiding spirit and the ideology 

of his political project. Simon Bolivar, though born in Venezuela and a national 

hero, is the continent?s greatest symbol of independence against colonialism. 

Bolivarianism, therefore, has mass appeal across national boundaries making Chavez 

a threat to elite regimes elsewhere. His decisive innovation was to elevate to 

heroic status Simon Rodriguez, Bolivar?s one-time teacher and a radical humanist 

who left a body of writing expressing his commitment to justice for the poor. 

This has provided a social content to Bolivarianism that it never possessed earlier. 

Simultaneously, it has also given it indigenous ideological roots that protect 

Chavez from right-wing charges of ?importing? Communism, even as he disconcerts 

the traditional Latin American left which looks in vain for the Marx-inspired 

cadre-based party that is supposed to be backing any such progressive project.

In less than two years, Chavez has transformed social 

policy and practice by building independent structures parallel to the corrupt, 

bureaucratized and inept official ministries of health and education. In most 

barrios (working class neighbourhoods) throughout the country, there now 

exists an integrated community complex. Well-equipped medical clinics staffed 

by 17,000 Cuban doctors, dentists, surgeons (who live and eat with local volunteer 

families) provide quality treatment for free, and do it with respect for the dignity 

of patients. In keeping with the Cuban concept of public health, there are Cuban 

instructors and sports facilities. Neighbourhood soup kitchens provide two meals 

a day to the identified homeless. To complete the picture, there will be a subsidized 

supermarket for cheap basic foodstuffs, a modest cultural-recreational centre 

and elementary education facilities for young and old illiterates, with secondary 

schooling and technical colleges and universities for the more advanced. The overall 

result is the emergence of vibrant community-based structures that can become 

the foundation for the construction of a nationally coordinated system of popular 

democracy. This, in turn, can ensure the long-term success of his Bolivarian revolution, 

eventually outlasting Chavez himself. Indispensable today, he must not remain 

so tomorrow.

Internal and external obstacles remain. An amazing, 

near-one-million militants, organized into ?electoral battle units?, were responsible 

for Chavez?s referendum victory despite absolute media hostility. One-third must 

now become committed cadres, organized into ?social battle units?, to carry Chavez?s 

project forward by outflanking the corrupt and faction-ridden Fifth Republic Movement, 

the party that formally supports Chavez. Over the next decade, the moribund, reactionary 

and pro-US civilian bureaucracies must be revamped, difficult though it is, by 

the infusion of young blood trained to be professionally competent. 

Externally, what can the US political establishment 

and its Venezuelan cohorts do, or hope for? Occupied in west Asia, a direct US 

invasion is ruled out for the time being. The best option for Chavez-baiters is 

a three-pronged strategy. Ideologically, wage the fiercest possible propaganda 

campaign against him. Economically, try and destabilize his rule by whatever means 

including sabotage. Militarily, encourage the Columbian army and government to 

carry out an unofficial war in Venezuela. But the most effective short-term measure 

would be the assassin?s bullet, a possibility made all too real by the recent 

killing of Chavez?s public prosecutor in a car-bomb explosion.

In all likelihood, Chavez will make an official visit 

to India early next year. It is too much to expect an Indian government, so ideologically 

in hock to neo-liberalism and so keen to forge a strategic alliance with the US, 

to try and understand, let alone endorse, Bolivarianism. But for narrowly pragmatic 

reasons, New Delhi might see some merit in deepening trade and investment ties 

with Caracas, exploring the possibility for greater South-South political cooperation, 

and promoting wider, stronger and freer connections between civil society in both 

countries. Just this much will be welcome.

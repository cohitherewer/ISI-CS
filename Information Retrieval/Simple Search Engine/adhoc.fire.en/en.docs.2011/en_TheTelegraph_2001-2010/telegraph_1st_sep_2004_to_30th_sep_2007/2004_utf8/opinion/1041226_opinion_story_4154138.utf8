 Letters to Editor

 From the oven into the fire

 Sir ? With her uncanny ability for taking u-turns, getting mired in allegations of corruption and keeping herself on the front pages, Zahira Sheikh should enter politics. I have no idea how good a baker she was, but as a politician, she will give everyone a run for their money. She is a minority (both in gender and religion) and has been hard done by (at all levels ? from NGOs to the NDA). She can?t fail to capitalize on her past. If she stands for elections, our voters are sure to vote for her ? even though she can?t tell a single truth.

 Yours faithfully,

B. Shah, London

 Candid camera

 Sir ? Whether or not the recent photographs of Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapur in a Mumbai restaurant were fabricated hardly matters. What is shocking is the media?s intrusion into the private life of the two filmstars. By hounding celebrities thus, the media are indulging in yellow journalism.

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmistha Nag, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is amusing to read the frantic statements of Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor claiming that the pictures of them in a ?lip-lock? were an ?invasion of privacy?. But how is that so? The cameras did not follow them into the bedroom. They were kissing in a public place, in full view of many people. It is time celebrities got rid of their double standards. If they have no qualms about using the media to further their careers, they should not crib when the media use them for sensational ends. 

 Yours faithfully,

B. Purkayastha, Shillong

 Sir ? The Kareena-Shahid episode has led to suggestions that a moral code of conduct be introduced for journalists. But, more relevant, what about a code of conduct on how celebrities should conduct themselves in public places?

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

 Sir ? ?Public displays of affection?, or PDAs, have been much in the news lately. PDAs have become a social reality that we must learn to reconcile to. The sangh parivar and other self-appointed custodians of public morality have tried hard to curb PDAs. But it is obvious that they are out of touch with the aspirations and ethos of the new generation, which is unfettered by religious dogmas and antiquated moral codes. And what is wrong in expressing affection in public, as long as it does not hurt anyone? It is better to be honest and bold than hypocritical and cowardly. Of course, the two filmstars photographed kissing have only been bold about expressing their affection for each other in public, not when it came to standing up for their actions.

 Yours faithfully,

Omar Luther King, New Delhi

 Sir ? The fracas over the Kareena-Shahid kiss, coupled with the Delhi school sex scandal, brings to the fore the dangers of gadgets like the camera-phone. These incidents, which may seem very small, could change our social behaviour forever. We are now more likely to be on our guard even at private moments, since not only can our pictures be taken without our consent or knowledge, but they can also be posted on the web in a distorted form. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmi Adhikary, Calcutta

 Sir ? So what if Kareena and Shahid were caught kissing in a restaurant? They may have been rehearsing for a forthcoming film. We have ceased to think anything of kisses on screen, so why should smooching in a restaurant be so indigestible? Is this not double standards?

 Yours faithfully,

Abhinandan Prasada, Shahgunj

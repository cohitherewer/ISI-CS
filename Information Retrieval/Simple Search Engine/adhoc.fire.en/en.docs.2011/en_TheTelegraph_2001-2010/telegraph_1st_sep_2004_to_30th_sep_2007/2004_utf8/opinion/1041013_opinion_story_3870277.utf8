 Letters to Editor

 Knocking on the door

 Sir ? The globalization of trade may be a half-realized dream, but the globalization of war is something that has already been achieved. Look at the way live shells and mortars from the Iraq wars are turning up in Indian scrapyards (?Scrap shells trail branches to Africa?, Oct 11). George W. Bush?s ?war against terror? is no longer in faraway Iraq, it is right at our doorstep, lurking in the drains, lying slyly by the roadside waiting to ambush those who don?t know of the danger. Terrorists? operations too are on a global scale. Witness their targeting of the underground railway in Madrid in the West or a nightclub in Bali in the East or their kidnapping of Indian truckers and a British engineer. Perhaps, in the end, no one anywhere will remain untouched by the violence. And that is the most frightening thought.

 Yours faithfully, 

Ramesh Chakraborty, Jamshedpur

 Slippery customer

 Sir ? In defending Pervez Musharraf, S.L. Rao unfortunately plays the devil?s advocate (?Business with Pakistan?, Oct 11). Musharraf who, even Rao admits, is given to changing political colour frequently, is quite unreliable. Hence it is doubtful whether we can ?do business? with him. Musharraf, Rao says, ?observed the very adverse impact of Islamic fundamentalism on Pakistani society and image in the world?. Then how could he commit himself, among other things, to the self-defeating task of propping up the fundamentalist taliban regime in Afghanistan which harboured Osama Bin Laden and his band of terrorists? Not surprisingly, the Frankenstein?s monster Musharraf created spiralled out of his control. Post 9/11, Musharraf cooperated with the United States of America, and not because he had a sudden change of heart and became ?an enemy of terrorism?, as Rao would have us believe. Had he not done so at that stage, the Americans would have probably done to him what they did to the taliban rulers across the border. Musharraf is no fool not to understand that.

 Last but not the least, friendship, by its very nature, is bilateral and is based on mutual trust and respect. The recent explosions in the North-east strongly suggest that the ISI is still active in India. This cannot go on if the seeds of friendship between the two countries are to be sown. Pakistan must stop supporting all forms of cross-border terrorism and subversive activities on Indian soil first. Only then should it be deemed worthy of friendship.

 Yours faithfully,

Saumitra Banerjee, Hereford, UK

 Sir ? Manmohan Singh should be commended by his political colleagues for sending out the right message with his ?business with Pakistan? comment, instead of being criticized for it.

 The roots of the problem can be traced to the different ways in which the two countries have grown. India has always tried to progress through indigenous research and development. The IITs, IIMs and medical colleges (the lives of many Pakistanis have been saved in Indian hospitals) are the backbone of the economy and have ensured its independence and competitiveness with the best in the world. Pakistan, on the other hand, has always relied on borrowed resources. The US took advantage of Pakistan?s underdevelopment to make overtures to it and thus keep an eye on India. China too has played a similarly two-faced role. But Pakistan has realized after the Kargil debacle that neither the US nor China will go against India. 

 Pakistan was pushed into the corner after 9/11 and it is admirable how it has made the most of the situation. But although this has made Islamabad the enemy of the terrorist outfits, one should not forget that some of the most sophisticated terrorists in the world still operate out of that country. And that Kashmir ? which is still the ?key issue? between India and Pakistan ? continues to inspire all of them.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Pervez Musharraf?s intentions of resolving India-Pakistan conflicts may not be as sincere as S.L. Rao is inclined to think. One must not forget that the former is a dictator who has usurped office by ousting a democratically-elected government. He does not have any objective of developing a ?peaceful and prosperous? Pakistan, and definitely not by compromising on Kashmir. Besides, what has Musharraf done for us to think that his aims coincide with ours? Neither the Kargil war nor the Agra summit inspire confidence. India has many a time extended a friendly hand to Pakistan, but has been disappointed every time. The core issue for Pakistan remains Kashmir, and if the general has softened his stand of late and is trying to curb cross-border-terrorism, it is simply because of pressure from George W. Bush. The latter wants Pakistan to mend its image so that the world does not think he is taking the help of a terrorist nation in his ?war against terror?. But things would be very different if there is a change of guard in Washington after the November elections since a Democrat president may ease the pressure on Pakistan.

 Is it not sad that after so many years of conflict and efforts to resolve them, the leaders of the two nations sit down to discuss serious issues like cross-border terrorism and Kashmir, and come out to declare unanimity over petty matters like the initiation of bus services and issue of visas?

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur

 Sir ? One step forward and two steps back has always been the story of Indo-Pak relations. In the circumstances, statements like ?we can do business with Pakistan? mean absolutely nothing.

 Yours faithfully,

Raktim Guha, Calcutta

 Just a thought

 Sir ? The puja spirit has reached a fever pitch all over the city, with busy shoppers thronging the streets, pandals coming up everywhere on the roads, and the municipal corporation doing some last minute patch-ups after last week?s deluge. Festivities apart, most offices will remain open during the pujas. It would greatly help the harried lot who work in them if the police were to keep at least the main thoroughfares in the city free of congestion.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Chatterjee, Calcutta

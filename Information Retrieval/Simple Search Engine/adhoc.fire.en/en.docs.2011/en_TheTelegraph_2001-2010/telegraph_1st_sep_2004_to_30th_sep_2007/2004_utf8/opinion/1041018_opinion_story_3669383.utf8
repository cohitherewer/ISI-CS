 FROM ONE JOB TO THE NEXT

 More flexible labour laws which permit retrenchments and the use of contract labourers are needed if India is to emulate the success of the south Asian economies, writes S. S. Chawdhry

 Keeping success in mind

 The Delhi high court order late last month restraining airport employees from going on a one-day strike will be welcomed by entrepreneurs perturbed by reports that the government was mulling a law which would make the right to strike a fundamental right. 

 The high court?s anti-strike order was more in keeping with recent developments in newly-industrializing Asian countries like China, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan where contracts are steadily replacing life-time employment. After shaking off colonial rule, most of these countries had embraced state control and licensing. Major industries were controlled by the government and labour policies were directed towards maintaining industrial peace and stability. Also, trade unions were a part of the political parties, and wielded such power that most laws were tilted towards protecting the workmen. 

 From the Eighties and Nineties, these countries were forced to liberalize labour laws not in tune with the changing economic scenario. Earlier, countries tried to manufacture all they needed and there was hardly any competition. But after the World Trade Organisation was formed, controlling cost of production became the most important factor in order to face up to competition. In the changed market-oriented set-up, only the most efficient and cost competitive would survive. 

 In South Korea in the Nineties, the hegemony of the FKTU, the government-mandated confederation of unions, was broken and another central organization, the KCTU, was born. Labour laws permitting lay-offs and the use of temporary labour were enacted and employers were allowed functional and numerical flexibility. 

 Singapore has one of the most stable and functionally flexible labour policies in Asia, which is focussed on providing foreign investors with stable, cheap and flexible labour laws. Strikes are prohibited in industries deemed ?essential to the economic development process?. No bargain is permitted on transfers, promotions, job assignments, terminations and hiring. 

 In Malaysia, union confederations were allowed to be incorporated only as societies and not as trade unions. These could not be politically active. The employees? right to strike was circumscribed by rules that stated that once the process of conciliation started, the strike had to stop. 

 Ensuring the flexibility of numbers appears to be the key in the Philippines to reducing head count and restructuring industrial relations in view of the competition from China and Vietnam. And the means to enforcing this is sub-contracting. Under this system workers are engaged on short-term contracts and cannot be made permanent. In manufacturing, about 25 per cent of jobs are done by such workers. 

 In Japan, the practice of life-time employment, developed in the late 19th century in the silk industry by employers forced to compete for scarce labour, has almost been given up. In recent times, many jobs have been lost to casual/temporary workers as a result of downsizing. There has been a sudden and dramatic increase in outsourcing in Japan. The number of ?dispatched workers? employed by sub-contractors has increased from 1,40,000 in 1985 to 8,90,000 in 1998, while part-time workers have risen from 4.7 millions to 11.1 million in the same period. The Japanese diet enacted a law providing legal support for limited-period employment contracts in March 1998. The National Personnel Authority has even recommended pay cuts for government servants to match the decline in wages in the private sector. 

 Prior to the Eighties, China had state ownership of industries, the implicit guarantee of life-time employment and administered allocation of labour, centralized planning of production and distribution, centralized wage setting and human resources policy, a rigid labour market with little inter-enterprise or regional mobility and the absence of price - or efficiency-driven controls over industry. 

 In the last two decades, all this has changed. The change in economic policy has brought about decentralization in state-owned enterprises and led to the entry of a large number of foreign businesses and the formation of joint-ventures and special economic zones all over the country. The Chinese government enacted a new labour law in 1994 that sought to create a new industrial relations system within the socialist market economy. Under this system, each unit has a union which gets a company-supported office, 2 per cent of the wage bill and the salary of the union representatives. Foreign enterprises must have a ceiling of 1.5 times the wages of the state-owned sector. 

 Employment contracts are short term, highly specific and impose restrictions on employees that can be unilaterally changed by the employer. In large state enterprises, the emphasis is on productivity and numerical flexibility with wages tied to performance, leading to the extensive use of contract labour and retrenchments. There is greater variation in earning, specially within an industry, based on the different economic conditions of firms. In low-cost, labour-intensive manufacturing centres dominated by investors from Hong Kong, industrial relations is characterized by low wages, refusal to follow minimum wage laws, blatant violation of labour laws, high rates of wild-cat strikes and labour disputes and little job security. 

 Against these conditions in Asian countries, Indian laws and practices are even now suffering from lethargy and red tape. China has had a continuous GDP growth of over 8 per cent but in India, only last year could we attain 8 per cent GDP growth. Although the government has been talking about bringing changes in labour laws for over 20 years, political parties are divided and are still debating the pros and cons of falling in with the WTO provisions. But the more time we take in changing our human resources policies, the slower will be our growth. In India we still work under the practice of life-time employment. We continue with the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act which prohibit layoffs and closure of loss-making units. The need of the hour is to change all labour laws, which inhibit faster industrialization. 

 Instead of encouraging contract labour, many states take pleasure in prohibiting it. Employers are being forced to make temporary labourers permanent even in areas which are not their main activity. In India, labour laws come under the concurrent list instead of being on the Union list. As a result, states vie with each other and do not hesitate even to change Centrally-enacted laws to prove to the masses that they are friends of the working class. They forget that by doing so, they are not serving the interests of the state or the working classes in the long term.

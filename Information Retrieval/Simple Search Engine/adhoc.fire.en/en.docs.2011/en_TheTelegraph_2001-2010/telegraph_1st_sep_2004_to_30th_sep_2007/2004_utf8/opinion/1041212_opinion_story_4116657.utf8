 DIARY

 Last Thursday, when all roads led to 10 Janpath (some even bypassing the way to Parliament), on the occasion of the 58th birthday of its resident, a set of close family friends decided to keep a track of the guests making a beeline to wish madam. A discussion followed in the evening about the eventful day and about who could be anointed the most surprising visitor. There were several suggestions ? Mayavati? MF Husain? No. It was Sharad Pawar, the Maratha strongman who withstood two recent knockouts with a more surprising elan ? first the BCCI defeat and then the sellout to the Congress in his own fiefdom. On this birthday, however, Pawar decided to forget all that and more ? his own daughter?s snide remark on the phone from Singapore some years back (?I hope you won?t stand in the long queue with a rose to greet Sonia?) which had kept him away from the birthday celebrations or his own belief that it was all a blatant display of sycophancy. And we only blamed public memories for being short!

 A quaint smile spread over the face of the prime minister when the two Naga leaders, Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, presented Manmohan Singh with a spear as a sign of peace. It didn?t take long for the leaders to understand the prime minister?s response. A spear was obviously very different from a dove or a rose not only in shape but also in its use. Which is why Muivah lost no time in explaining to the PM that the offering of a spear is a well-established Naga tradition. Once a spear is accepted, it is taken as an end of hostilities. Lets hope new generation Nagas remember the spear?s traditional meaning.

 Years after Laloo Yadav stopped the saffron rath in his badlands, he has once again taken on a saffronwallah. But no matter what inspired Laloo to rake up the case of Gauri Sabharwal, once daughter-in-law of LK Advani, the move has not gone down well with either his opponents or allies. The Congress feels Laloo should have stayed away from a family dispute. As for the saffronites, they are said to be trying to build up a case about Laloo and his female friends. Rabri be warned!

 Politics is a family business for the Shastris and they are back to party-hopping. The eldest son of Lal Bahadur, Sunil, has quit the BJP, in patriotic response to changing times. But the development has made younger brother, Anil (who allegedly sees himself as the sole claimant to his father?s legacy) very nervous. Sunil had thought he would get a rousing welcome in the Congress, but he has been asked to wait. Congress leaders say Anil had to work hard to achieve this stalemate. Undeterred, Sunil has floated his own party called ?Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan Congress?. It seems like we have to watch out for news snippets which will announce its merger with the Congress or Anil floating his own sequel to JJ,JKC. Keep your eyes open.

 The Ambanis seem to be losing their grip on not merely the business empire. The family tussle has been a liberating experience for both the media and politicians. While the hitherto taciturn media have had an open season in reporting about the controversial group, politicos have suddenly become tongue-tied when it comes to defending Reliance. When the CPI(M) MP, Nilotpal Basu, focussed on Reliance Infocomm?s alleged frauds, R-positive members sat squirming in their seats without offering either a rebuttal or a digression.

 It?s still hard times for Ajit Jogi, who now has to fight the BJP over crumbs. Recently, he found that the ministerial bungalow, which had been allotted to him by the director, estates, had been usurped by BJP MP and former CM, Kailash Joshi. Time for some black magic!

 Plain magic. And choreographer-turned-director, Farah Khan found time to work it at her nikaah ceremony, when she brought back the Khans together. Shah Rukh and Salman had not been on talking terms ever since the latter had stormed into a shooting of a love scene between the former and Salman?s ex-flame, Aishwarya Rai. Sallu had apparently asked Rai not to do the intimate scene with Shah Rukh, which made the latter hit the ceiling in rage. A heated exchange followed, which nearly brought the heroes to blows. 

 All that was somehow forgotten that precious evening when Farah got up and first invited Shah Rukh to dance with her to the famous Murder number, and then asked Salman to join them. Farah moved away, but the two kept on dancing. A short while later, Shah Rukh apparently went up to Sallu, who welcomed him with open arms. Another Bollywood tear-jerker, should we say?

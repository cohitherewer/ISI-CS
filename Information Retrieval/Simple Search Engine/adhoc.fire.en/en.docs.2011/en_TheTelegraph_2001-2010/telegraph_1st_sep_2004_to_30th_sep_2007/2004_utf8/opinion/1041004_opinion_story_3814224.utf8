 WAITING FOR A SURPRISE

 Gwynne Dyer

 American intelligence sources are leaking hair-raising tales of Iran?s alleged nuclear weapons programme. Norman Podhoretz, editor of Commentary, and godfather of the neo-conservatives, says, ?I am not advocating the invasion of Iran at this moment, although I wouldn?t be heartbroken if it happened.? Israel has recently taken delivery of 500 ?bunker-buster? bombs from the United States of America to destroy deeply-buried nuclear facilities. Is the long-predicted ?October surprise? that clinches the election for George W. Bush going to be an attack on Iran?

 Last month, Yadollah Javani, head of the Revolutionary Guards political bureau, reassured Iranians that neither the US nor Israel would dare an attack. ?The entire Zionist territory, including its nuclear facilities and atomic arsenal, are currently within range of Iran?s advanced missiles, quot; he said. Thus ?neither the Zionist regime nor America will carry out its threats.?

 Some of this is nonsense. Podhoretz?s grasp of military realities is inferior to a beauty queen?s: the US is far too over-stretched militarily in Afghanistan and Iraq to contemplate invading Iran, which is much bigger and stronger than both of them put together, and Israel cannot invade Iran, having no common border with it.

 Right time

 Javani is also talking through his hat. Iran?s Shahab-3 missiles can reach Israel and strike at American forces in west Asia, but since Iran certainly has no nuclear weapons at the moment, that only means that it can drop a few high-explosive warheads on them. There is no effective Iranian deterrent to American or Israeli air strikes aimed at destroying the country?s nuclear facilities, which is far more likely than an actual invasion.

 Israel?s prime minister, Ariel Sharon, would be seriously tempted to launch a ?preemptive? strike against Iranian nuclear facilities if he could get a green light from the US. This would eliminate a potential threat to Israel?s nuclear weapons monopoly in the region and also boost Sharon?s popularity in a difficult period at home. For Sharon in fact, October would be better than later, because he can be sure that President Bush is still in office. John Kerry might say no.

 From the White House?s vantage point, it?s probably too soon to say. At the moment, the numbers are looking good for Bush and he probably doesnt need an ?October surprise? to win. But it?s something you might want to have up your sleeve just in case the Kerry campaign started to take off.

 No loss, no gain

 And here?s the funny thing: the Islamic radicals who took back control of the Iranian parliament in rigged elections last spring and hope to unseat moderate president Mohammad Khatami next year would privately welcome an attack. They know that most of their fellow-countrymen are fed up with repression at home and confrontation abroad. They need something to drive ordinary Iranians back into their camp, and what better than the patriotic fury that would be unleashed by a foreign attack?

 Even if they do have a nuclear weapons programme to hide, their advisers would say that a single round of air attack on widely dispersed and deeply-buried facilities could not cripple it ? and if there isn?t one, then there is nothing to lose. In fact, they have a lot to gain politically from an attack. Their uncooperative behaviour towards the International Atomic Energy Agency suggests that they fully understand that.

 When the decision-makers on both sides have something to gain politically from a certain action, it becomes a possibility. But no more than that. The final decision would be Washington?s, and if Bush?s poll numbers begin to look shaky by mid-October, the possibility of an attack on Iran may rise considerably.

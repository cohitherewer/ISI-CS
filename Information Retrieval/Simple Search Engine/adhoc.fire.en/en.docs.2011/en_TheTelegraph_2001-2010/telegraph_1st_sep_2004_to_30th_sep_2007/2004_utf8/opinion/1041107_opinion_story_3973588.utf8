 DIARY

 Birthdays are a wonderful time to fix old foes. So Arjun Singh must have thought when he chose November 5, his birthday, to tell reporters that PV Narasimha Rao, and the Congress leadership under him, were responsible for the Babri demolition. The announcement was meant to set the cat among the pigeons, since many of those who call the shots now ? Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, P Chidambaram ? were once part of the Rao regime. Sadly, Sonia Gandhi too chose Nov 5 ? though it wasn?t her birthday ? to clear the air about her children?s political future, her equations with the UPA government, Pakistan, and so on. Naturally, the media was more interested in this rare candid-speak from Mrs G, and the HRD minister?s ?bombshell? fizzled out. But the thakur hasn?t given up. At 75, he reckons he is young enough to have many more opportunities to fix Rao.

 B?day boys, it seems, no longer have a good time. On October 30, which happens to be Pramod Mahajan?s birthday, he woke up to find that Uma Bharti had made his day by saying she had declined to join LK Advani?s team because Mahajan was a part of it. As a result, all the journalists he had considered to be such great pals were swarming his house, asking inconvenient questions. Mahajan escaped with difficulty. He shut himself in a room and for the next 30 minutes was on the phone, complaining to someone that he hadn?t been treated so badly since 1980 when he became BJP gen-sec for the first time. And that he was leaving to catch a flight to Mumbai to celebrate properly! Perhaps, the sight of Vilasrao Deshmukh in Mantralaya would set the jolly mood.

 Asked to chose between beard and party ? Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi knows which one he prefers. For a long time, the BJP spokesperson and the only visible Muslim face of the saffron party was being pressurized by the RSS to get rid of his beard. The latter?s argument was that every time Naqvi appeared on television, the party?s vote-share went down by 2 per cent. Perhaps, the knickerwallahs of Jhandewalan had counted among M Venkaiah Naidu?s many sins the fact that he had failed to fire Naqvi or even to get him to shave off his beard. So, when LK Advani came calling on the RSS bosses in Nagpur, presumably, one of their conditions of support was that Naqvi would have to go. And so Naqvi went. Wonder if Sukumar Ray would have approved of Naqvi?s attachment to the hair on his face? 

 Now that he is approaching 90, Harkishen Singh Surjeet has decided that it is time to call it a day. The momentous decision is to be announced at the CPI(M) party congress in Delhi next year. The three-time party general secretary will be replaced by the 50-something Prakash Karat. But what will Mulayam Singh Yadav and even Sonia Gandhi, who confesses to being highly impressed by the grand old man of secular coalition politics, do without his gentle guidance and mediation?

 Free-loading, thy name is Indian politician. Electricity, telephone, fuel ? the resources of the nation are, they believe, at their disposal, to use and not to pay for. But books? The other day it came to light that Jaswant Singh?s monthly newspaper bill comes to about Rs 14,000. In contrast, the prime minister tots up a mere Rs 2,000 a month. It was the perfect juicy bit of gossip to feed to the press hounds, until it occurred to someone in the UPA that perhaps such a hefty bill was not such a shameful thing after all. And that Jaswant Singh could even use the opportunity to show off his eclectic reading by releasing a copy of an itemized bill which would reveal that he subscribed to several foreign publications on world affairs. It?s good for him then that the Rajya Sabha secretariat foots the bill.

 It was supposed to be a dream second coming ? in dolby sound and full colour. But at the premier itself, the remixed Mughal-e-Azam ran into trouble. The grand bash in Mumbai this Friday fell flat. Dilip Kumar, the only remaining member of the film?s principal cast, stayed away. K. Asif?s son did not turn up from London. And technicians of the city-based Indian Academy of Arts and Animation were upset at being kept out of the credits when it was their painstaking work that had made the new edition possible. Thankfully for the organizers, Aamir Khan turned up and obligingly posed with the disgruntled lot. At least they would be in the picture (with Aamir), if not on the credits. 

 Some said it with flowers. But Sahib Singh Verma seemed to think that a king-size box of Chyavanprash would better convey his happiness at LK Advani?s re-ascendance to the BJP presidency. Advani didn?t seem to disagree. He couldn?t stop laughing and agreed that his party definitely needed the fortifying ayurvedic concoction. He said that it reminded him of an incident from the life of George Bush Sr. Apparently, the young Bush Sr had been asked to write an essay in school about the most emotional moment in his life. He wrote about the death of his sister. But as he was finishing, he noticed that he had used the word ?tear? too many times. So he looked up a thesaurus, picked on ?laceration?, and substituted tear with it a few times. Needless to say, he failed. Lesson of the story: verbal dysfunction runs in the American first family. But in the context of the BJP, what was this story meant to indicate? Semantic confusion?

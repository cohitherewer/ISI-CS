 Letters to Editor

 A case for reforms

 Sir ? One wonders which is more intriguing among the facts pertaining to the St Kitts forgery case ? that the Central Bureau of Investigation has failed to ?complete the chain of conspiracy? linking Chandraswamy, or that it took just a local court and more than 20 years to acquit him (?Chandraswamy off St Kitts hook?, Oct 26). The outcome also serves as a reminder that such cases hog the media?s attention only for a little while ? and then get dragged on silently for years in some court or the other. When this is the fate of such a high-profile case, think of all the pending cases which keep getting stalled on some pretext or another. In all our talk of reforms, we perhaps devote too little attention to judicial ones. Does it really take so long to gather relevant information on a case? Or are we destined to live with delayed, and therefore denied, justice all our lives? 

 Yours faithfully,

Arati Ghosh, Calcutta

 Questions without answers

 Sir ? While Veerappan?s death was welcome news, the whole episode raises more questions than it answers (?Jungle justice catches up?, Oct 20). If one were to believe that four of the special task force men made an entry into Veerappan?s inner circle and later enticed him into the ambulance where he was trapped and ultimately killed, then the obvious question would be, why was the same strategy not deployed to catch the brigand much earlier? 

 It is also undeniable that had Veerappan been in custody, it would have been disastrous for the numerous politicians and officials who allegedly facilitated his reign of terror for all these years. It is more likely that he was silenced on higher orders rather than being trapped and killed in an encounter as the official reports have been claiming. As for the eagerness of politicians and former policemen to take credit for Veerappan?s death, it would have been hilarious if it were not so revolting. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir ? The STF of Tamil Nadu, led by K. Vijayakumar, and that of Karnataka, deserve kudos for the success in Operation Cocoon notwithstanding the disappointment that the dreaded bandit could not be captured alive. One wonders what became of the huge sum of money that he received as ransom for releasing the Kannada superstar, Rajkumar, as well as his exact relation with top brass of the police.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul 

 Sir ? J. Jayalalithaa need not have gone overboard in her joy that her ?government?s resoluteness? had paid off and announced a reward of Rs 3 lakh and promotions for all the 752 STF personnel involved in the capture and killing of Veerappan. There is more to the charade ? of appointing the STF and funding its activities for so many years to net Veerappan ? than meets the eye. Apart from the intriguing munificence, one must also contend with her loyalists likening her to Durga slaying the Mahishasura, pointing out too that the killing coincided with Navratri. How much more mindless fawning must we take.

 Yours faithfully,

Saptarshi Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Veerappan?s violent death in the encounter only bears out the saying that a man who lives by the gun also dies by it. And going further, just as it is said that behind every successful man there is a woman, it can be said that behind Veerappan?s successful eluding of the police were powerful politicians. It is alleged that Veerappan enjoyed patronage and protection of politicians, businessmen and the police force of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. But one question that will always bother is why such a fuss was made so that a DNA test could not be conducted on Veerappan?s body. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.R. Sridharan, Kanpur

 Sir ? Veerappan met with an ignominious death no doubt. But it is ironical how the police arranged for an even more ignominious cremation for him ? with firewood and a couple of truck tyres and kerosene (?Bandit buried, sceptics dig ground?, Oct 21). What could be more unfortunate for a person surrounded by tons of sandalwood for most of his life? 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? Veerappan has been expensive for the police, both in terms of lives lost, money and the time spent in trying to hunt him down, also in terms of the ivory and sandalwood that he smuggled out of the country. But the truly difficult task still waits to be done ? of exposing those politicians and bureaucrats who extended patronage to Veerappan. The menace, for all we know, may just have begun.

 Yours faithfully,

Diana Sahu, Cuttack

 Beauty bane

 Sir ? Aishwarya Rai makes it to the front pages no matter what she does. The world premiere of the much-hyped film, Bride and Prejudice, in London, where Rai spent a considerable amount of time with her fans, was perhaps one such event which credited such an important positioning in the papers (?Never mind the fur, Ash does a Cruise?, Oct 6). She needs to be told, however, that if she were serious about the success of her first English film, she should have looked for other things to wear than fur and especially in London of all places. 

 Yours faithfully,

Atanu Dey, Diphu, Assam

 Sir ? Keats?s saying ?A thing of beauty is a joy forever? provides much food for thought when one witnesses the picture-perfect Aishwarya Rai drawing more criticism than appreciation these days. Critics feel that her exceptional good looks is getting shadowed by her ?plastic? expressions. But is it necessary to either deify or dash her to the floor at the drop of a hat? Why cannot she be treated more neutrally like other Bollywood actresses? Surely stunning looks can be no sound reason to assess her calibre differently?

 Yours faithfully,

Manisha Mishra, Cuttack

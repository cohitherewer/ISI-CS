 THE READER IS KING

 Final judgment

Editors need writers and writers need good editors 

to process their talent for the reader. But between the editor and the author, 

it is the editor who best understands this readership. Authors know their subject, 

editors specialize in knowing the audience. They analyse the segments of the market 

and study the spectrum of success and failure in collaboration with the marketing 

department.

Three questions. How far should an editor go in processing the author?s manuscript for the market? How much change would he be justified to make and how does he deal with recalcitrant authors? Second, what is the minimum that the editor must ensure? Third, is the editor?s permanent alliance only with the reader?

 It is well-known that no two editors in the world would edit a manuscript the same way. Editors have their priorities, but these are decided by what they understand of the reader. But no reader wants to read more than what is minimally required. Good editing thus means not what needs to be put in but what can no longer be cut out.

 It means purging sentences of useless words and paragraphs of useless sentences. This is not an exercise that is easily done and requires some years of experience and a considerable amount of background reading to be done judiciously. Recalcitrant authors, who refuse to accept any change, have always been difficult to handle. There is no golden rule to tackle them except perhaps ?time and patience? and the hope that the author will come around to seeing the editor?s point.

 Language, clear and simple, is an extremely important factor for the Indian reader. Often this results in oversimplification of complex subjects, but it is better to be simple and readable than not to be read at all. This is the most important criterion for all textbooks; it doesn?t matter for fiction or literary criticism which has a minority readership in any case.

 There are basic guidelines for editorial revisions of a text which can be divided under three heads: content, readability and impact. Content means information or a body of facts; analysis and interpretation which mean facts are organized, not merely enumerated; balance, where opinions are clearly distinguished from fact and where more than one side of the argument is presented so that the reader has a fair chance to judge the reliability of the information; lastly some originality which shows an ability to go beyond earlier thoughts on the subject. 

 Many factors like concreteness and clarity make for ?readability? but perhaps the most important is that language should be close to the spoken word rather the purely formal meaning.

 Lastly, the impact that a book would make. Put it another way, it means relevance or how a work relates to current or enduring interests of a specific readership. It is important that readers are clearly identified and ?approached?, either through retail outlets or by direct mail orders.

 As to whether an editor owes his final allegiance to his reader, the answer is yes. Without the reader in mind, why else does the author and the editor make the book?

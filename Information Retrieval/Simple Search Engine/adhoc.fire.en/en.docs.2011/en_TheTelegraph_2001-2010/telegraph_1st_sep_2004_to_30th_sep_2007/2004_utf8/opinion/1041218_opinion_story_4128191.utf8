 TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE

 This above all / Khushwant 

 Singh

 Watering hole

 We set up lofty ideals for ourselves only to compromise with them to save our skins. The commonest example is the resolve never to tell a lie ? and then lie like troopers to get out of awkward situations. I am a typical example of someone who swears by the truth and lies all the time to avoid people I don?t want to see. In my home in Kasauli I have put up a plaque in a prominent place with a quotation from Shakespeare: 

 This above all:/ to thine own self be true;/ And it must follow, as the night the day;/ Thou canst not then be false to any man.

 I look at it when I go in and out of my bedroom. My phone rings: ?I am so-and-so. Can I see you for a few minutes today at any time convenient to you?? he or she asks. Without a pause I change my voice into one of a doddery old man?s on his death bed. ?I am sorry, I am not all well,? I reply. ?The doctor has forbidden me from receiving visitors. Call me after a few days when I am better.? And return to solving my crossword puzzle in undisturbed peace. I don?t suffer any pangs of guilt at having lied. And I did not offend him or her. This kind of petty lying has become second nature. I have also told bigger lies, but taken care not to hurt too many people.

 The compromise formula I have accepted is taken from James Joyce?s A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man. His creed runs as follows: ?I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my church; and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use ? silence, exile, and cunning?But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a life-long mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity too.?

 Joyce would have readily forgiven my trespasses because I fully subscribe to his resolve to speak without fear of consequences about my family, country and religion. And if trouble follows then I keep mum, run away or lie my way out of it. Many great men like Galileo had to lie to save their lives. All life is sacred, one?s own more sacred than others. It is neatly summed up in an Urdu couplet:

 Haq acchha,/ Magar haq key liye koee aur marey/ To aur acchha/ Tum bhee koee Mansoor ho,/ Jo soolee charhoo?/ Khaamosh raho!

 (Truth is good:/ If someone else dies for the truth/ It is much better:/ Are you some kind of martyr to be hanged?/ Remain silent.)

 A forbidden pleasure

 Next to love, love of liquor is the most popular theme in Urdu poetry: from Meer Taqi Meer down to Faiz Ahmed Faiz, they extolled the joys of drinking. The trend continues with Ahmed Faraz, the leading Pakistani poet. Though forbidden (haraam) by their Islamic faith, most of them were hard drinkers. But to my dismay I find that though they wrote a great deal about maikhanas (taverns) and sakis (wine-servers), there is no evidence whatsoever that there were any in existence anywhere in India till the Europeans made their presence felt in our country. Thereafter the Portuguese had their taverns, as did the French and the Dutch. The English did not replicate their pubs but confined their drinking to their exclusive, whites-only clubs or bars of hotels. If there had been any maikhanas or madhushalas, they would have had names as have pubs in England. None can be found in works of prose in Urdu, Hindi or English.

 First allow me to deal with the Urdu poets? love of liquor. One of the most popular poems of Meer Taqi Meer is Yaaro mujhey muaaf rakho, main nashey mein hoon ? friends forgive me for I am somewhat drunk. Asadullah Khan Ghalib made no secret of his liking for Scotch and French wines; he made his sundowner into a ritual: a bath, fresh clothes, then whiskey or wine delicately scented. He took a sip or two before he picked up pen and paper to compose verses. He was often smitten with guilt and resolved to give it up. The resolution to become a teetotaller did not last very long. To wit:

 Ghalib chhutee sharaab par phir bhee kabhee kabhee/ Peeta hoon roze-e-abr-o-shap-e- Mehtab mein

 (Ghalib foreswore wine but from time to time it is true/ When clouds gather in the skies and nights lit by the moon,/ He breaks his vow and takes a sip or two.)

 He also writes of the maikhana, saki, the rivals (ghair) he met there and the beloved with whom he exchanged glances, which were more eloquent than speech. I am convinced that all these maikhanas, sakis and lovely women he flirted with his eyes were figments of his poetic imagination. All the drinking our poet-authors did was in their homes or in entirely male gatherings. Their mehfils took place in the houses of courtesans; the women they fell in and out of love with and often bedded were professionals.

 It does not matter whether maikhanas or madhushalas did or did not exist, nor whether wine-servers were women or young boys, our bards of yore conjured up fictitious but magical poetry extolling them. To wit, Ghalib?s lines:

 Ishq say tabeeyat nay zeest ka mazaa paayaa/ Dard kee dawaa paayee, dard la-dawaa paayaa

 (From love I got the lust for living;/ To ease my pain it gave me something for sure;/ I also found that such pain hath no cure.)

 High and happy

 Women tipplers, they say, are 

 tilting the scales

 And fast catching up with the males

 In their quest for liberty, equality, 

 eternity, fraternity.

 Beaten up by their drunken husbands

 They are fast making amends 

 For their inferiority

 In both towns and country.

 And the report says, Dayanand 

 and Damyanti

 In the fort town of Jhansi

 One evening came home high 

 And under their roof began to fly;

 ?Dinner, O get me dinner,? Dayanand demanded

 ?Quick, you cook, I am starving,? Damyanti responded.

 He caressed and coaxed her,

 And there was a tide

 Which he pushed aside

 At which his manhood asserted 

 and he commanded,

 At which she was greatly offended

 And kicked his behind

 And hid herself a bit;

 He ran for her in a fit

 And without his knowing, his foot 

 got caught in it 

 And his dhoti was gone;

 But he was in a heat

 And ran on into the street

 Where he met his neighbours freely

 And has since provided immense joy

 To the entire locality.

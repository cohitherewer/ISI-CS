 RELY ON THE MEDIA

Gouri Chatterjee

 Now they tell us. That no one really knows who owns India?s largest industrial house. That ?money was diverted from the cash cow, Reliance Industries Limited, to finance projects and charities that were promoted due to personal whims of the family members and/or their loyalists?. That not all Reliance shareholders (aka the Reliance family) knew about all these investments. 

 That one brother may have collared 30 per cent of the shares in one of the new investments while leaving the mother company with only a 12 per cent stake and a bill of something like Rs 1,200 crore. That?. Grisly details hinting at something rotten in the nation?s largest business empire have been flooding the media for over a month now. 

 Things the media had never told us before and would never have if the feuding Ambani brothers had not decided to use the media for their slugfest. Senior business journalists frankly admit that all the catch-up stories of sweat equities and funds diversion are gifts from one of the brothers who seems to be on a do-or-die mission to destroy the other. ?How could we?? these seasoned journos demand. ?It?s an absolute maze, the corporate holdings of Reliance. And only four of its 600-odd companies are listed.?

 Fair enough. If even the government hesitates to take on Reliance, why blame a reporter on deadline. As it is, reporting Reliance was never easy. The company has always been famous for its media management. Earlier, it used its considerable powers of persuasion to plant hostile stories about its rivals and prevent unflattering stories about itself. If anyone dared to step out of line, advertisements dried up instantly, lawsuits often followed. (One newspaper still has a Rs 2,000-crore case hanging perilously over it.) The one and only book to take a clear-eyed look at India?s first business family, Australian journalist Hamish McDonald?s Polyester Prince, is banned in this country.

 R-positive

 Puff pieces endowing the Ambanis with almost magical powers, glowing accounts of their business acumen, unquestioning acceptance of their figures are not only easier to do, they are safer too. Nobody protests flattery, even if it is blatantly untruthful. 

 So all journalists became R-positive and did not allow anyone to suspect that the two brothers may not carry on ?like Ram and Lakshman? after the death of their legendary father. Rather, the paeans of praise to Ambani senior, junior and future, unleashed with the passing of the patriarch, must have put even their PR department to shame. No one learnt the empire builder had died intestate ? till the brothers began to squabble over their legacy. So much for the concern for Reliance?s 35 lakh shareholders that is now dripping from every report. 

 To be fair, that?s what business journalism has been reduced to the world over ? a well-oiled cog in a publicity machine for big business interests. Remember ?big bull? Harshad Mehta splashed on magazine covers as a stock market genius. The egg on the US media after the collapse of the dotcom boom and Enron has barely congealed. 

 In a world where money is god, it makes very poor business sense to tell readers, viewers or just ?eyeballs? that the big winners are either very lucky ? or, well, crooks. Instead, heroes are built and investment tips doled out and the repeated mistakes put down to occupational hazards. 

 So make no mistake, it will be business as usual if the brothers kiss and make up one of these days. Till then, it will be all Reliance all the time and we may be facing a National Reliance Media Year. But what you will learn will depend on which brother your reporter has access to. Hardly the best way to make sense of corporate India. But what choice do you have?

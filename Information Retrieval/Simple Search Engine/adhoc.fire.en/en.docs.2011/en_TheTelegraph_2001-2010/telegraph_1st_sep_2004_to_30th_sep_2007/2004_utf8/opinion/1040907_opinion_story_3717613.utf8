 Letters to Editor

 Proud and prejudiced

 Sir One of the notions that the Iraq war has confirmed beyond doubt is that wisdom will never be George W. Bushs strong point. If it were, then he would choose his words a little more carefully than saying the United States of America has fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for power, but because the lives of its citizens were at stake (Bush sleepless in New York, Sep 4). It is really incredible how he continues to expect people to take him for his word, so what if he has always looked and acted like the cat which has just swallowed a canary? The world knows Bush had intentions of invading Iraq long before 9/11, as well as it now knows how he had manipulated its citizens opinion in favour of the war. What the world would not mind knowing is what leads Bush to claim that now America and the world are safer. Not the increasing display of hatred against Americans outside the US, surely? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Sudipta Ghosh, Ranchi

 Price of freedom

 Sir Although the cold-blooded killing of 12 Nepali hostages in Iraq is condemnable, the reactions of the Nepali citizens are no less so (Criminal rage, Sep 3). The Nepali Muslims just like the Nepali Hindus share no bond with the Iraqis. And yet, they have to pay the price for following the same religion as the men who killed the Nepali hostages in Iraq. It is a typically subcontinental phenomenon that local people are attacked for religious crimes committed by a completely alien set of people in a different geographical location. Remember the hatred unleashed against the Bangladeshi Hindus after the demolition of the Babri Masjid by saffron-minded Indian Hindus, or the communal disharmony which inspired Taslima Nasreens novel, Lajja? 

 In spite of all the technological progress being made, certain societies continue to possess a peculiar mindset as far as liberalism and tolerance are concerned exposing the ugly face of communalism and racism whenever an untoward incident occurs. It is time people understood that technology, opulence or economic reforms will not guarantee a safe world. A greater tolerance for all people, irrespective of their language, religion, caste or colour, will. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 Sir Sukhdev Singh, Antaryami and Tilak Raj, the three Indians who were held hostage in Iraq, have finally been reunited with their families, ending a drama lasting 42 days (Hostages in freedom amp; fury, Sep 2). However, the price of Rs 4.6 crore paid by their employer, Kuwait Gulf and Link, as ransom, is no mean sum. 

 It may be remembered that all this while the minister of state for external affairs, E. Ahmed, has been saying that it is not the governments principle to talk to terrorists and that no ransom would be paid. This does not make much sense. There is no guarantee that such episodes will not be repeated in the near future, especially because thousands of Indians are still working in Iraq.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

 Sir E. Ahmeds remark that the government has maintained its principles on the hostage issue and has overseen the release of the hostages without forsaking its values was irrational. He should, rather, realize that were it not for the efforts of KGL, which had to incur a cost of nearly a million dollars to facilitate the safe release of the seven hostages including the three Indian truck drivers, India would now have been in the same situation as Nepal.

 Yours faithfully,

Diana Sahu, Cuttack 

 Sir The heroic welcome accorded to the Indian hostages is incomprehensible (VIP reception awaits freed trio, Sep 3). All the more because E. Ahmed was personally present at the airport to receive them. While it is true that their captivity caused much worry, it is also true that they had violated visa rules to go and work in Iraq. The Indian government had to go through unnecessary trouble because of them. Legal action against them will act as a deterrent to those who are ready to flout rules of emigration in the hope of earning in dollars. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Clarion call

 Sir It is heartening to know about the declining support for the Centre for Indian Trade Union (City Support for Citu on decline, Aug 31). The militancy unleashed by these organizations over the years has resulted in lockouts, strikes and industries fleeing West Bengal. The only philosophy of the unions is to fight for the rights of the working class and view all industrialists as oppressors who have done no good for the state. 

 Take the example of any industrial city Jamshedpur comes to mind readily. The infrastructure, social uplift and standard of living there give reason enough to have more and more industries here. Is it not time that unions like the Citu understood this simple fact and did something constructive rather than going about with inane protests, striking work and paralyzing the state? I hope good sense will prevail and the union will work to better conditions in the state rather than think solely of their narrow interests. 

 Yours faithfully,

Soumitra Bhattacharyya, Vienna, Austria

 Sir So the Citu has lost 10 per cent of its members in three years. Shibani Sengupta, Citus Calcutta vice president, may say that their work is not confined to organizing bandhs and striking work. This is anything but true. Every time I visit West Bengal, I hear cries of bandh karo, bandh karo. The Citu is advised to be more industry-friendly and not shout merely for a raise in salary and bonus. I have a request to them dont force industries to move to other states create an environment for a healthy work culture. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abdus Samad, Inchon, South Korea

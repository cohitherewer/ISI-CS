 MORE FRIEND THAN FOE

 Malvika Singh

 Why has the Congress given a rather inconsequential politician like Uma Bharti this lease of political life? She would have been deemed a failure as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh within another year and would have disappeared from the public space ? instead, her party is using her to launch yet another unpleasant attack on Sonia Gandhi. She will be raving and ranting as she travels on her flag march. Waste of time, waste of editorial comment. The wisest thing that the media could do in this situation is ignore her ?trip?, shenanigans and unpalatable rhetoric. It would become a damp squib operation, something her actions deserve to be. The manner in which the Uma ?episode? has been managed by her opposition makes one wonder if the opposition is in fact on her side.

 This saffron-robed politician is questioning people like Montek Singh Ahluwalia and his credentials; a few days later Bharti is damning Sonia and hailing Ahluwalia; she is being polite, for the moment, about Manmohan Singh, but who knows when she will start that tirade ? what is she at, what is she all about, and when she will twist and turn her earlier statements? It is bizarre, perverse behaviour. Why cannot these limited minds understand that a practitioner of the free market economy like Ahluwalia, who has seen the upside and the downside, is in a far better position to find appropriate ways, means and a delivery mechanism, to address the larger and more important issue of the devolution of a better standard of living to those who have not been in the prosperity loop so far. For someone who believes in the free market, it is a great challenge to deliver the goods across the board, if only to prove the worth of that same free market.

 Why lose it?

 And, it is not just the Bhartis, the Bardhans too have joined the chorus in a high toneless pitch, not willing to give anyone the time of day to begin the process of adjustment and reform for the poor. Bardhan?s party was unable to make a recognizable dent in five decades. They failed. Why then this constant verbal bashing? The CPI is as abusive as the BJP. It?s just abuse of a different kind but abuse nonetheless. Manmohan Singh and his team are most definitely attempting to restructure much that has gone wrong over the years. Surely an intelligent, committed and ?patriotic? opposition should give them a hand. Our present opposition goes on and on about its great nationalist fervour but it has done more damage to the national strengths of India than any other political grouping.

 The recent bogey the BJP has created and which it is actively nurturing ? the rising birth rate of Muslims and Christians ? is so despicable and inhuman that the mind boggles. Why does the BJP hate Muslims, or for that matter, Christians? It must answer this simple question. It has a very strange interpretation of Hinduism and the ?Hindu way of life?. Dislike and hate are usually what normal human beings feel towards those who are nasty, cruel, treacherous and suchlike. It should have nothing to do with the language you speak, the stratum of society you come from or the faith you believe in. Why this animosity? Why this paranoia? Why this obsession? Why this deep insecurity? The BJP must be accountable for this to the Indian people. Only a few months ago Atalji was busy wooing those same ?multiplying Muslims?. Why this turnaround? These are dreadful inhuman and divisive games that are being played out. It is a shameful legacy that we are leaving behind for the next generation.

 India has not had a bloody revolution. We pride ourselves on that ? we were a tolerant and civilized social order, one that absorbed other cultures with ease and came to terms with diversity making it a national strength. Why lose it?

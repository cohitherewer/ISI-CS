 BRIGHT CITY, FADING LIGHTS

 The 350th anniversary celebrations of the Taj are yet another occasion for the Uttar Pradesh government to score a political point, writes Tapas Chakraborty

 Contested site

 When the Mulayam Singh Yadav government of Uttar Pradesh decided to move the Supreme Court with a request to allow ?night-viewing? of the Taj, it had a plan to sell a fairy tale experience to its foreign tourists, augment the state?s sagging tourism industry and boost Mulayam Singh?s image as a politician. 

 There is no doubt that the Taj acquires a special aura at night, particularly on the moon-lit autumn night of the sharadpurnima. Fresh from the monsoon shower, the sparkling monument unfolds its beauty as the moon climbs up in the sky. The Taj gardens remain heady with the fragrance of the autumnal flowers. The Yamuna waters shimmer with the reflection of the moonbeams. And when the moon reaches the Taj?s largest dome, the monument becomes aglow with a sudden flash of light, sending visitors into raptures. Till 1984, tourists were allowed to feast their eyes on this spectacle. Not anymore. 

 Twenty years down the line, the Taj has ceased to be an icon of Indian tourism. This Mughal monument is the site on which rival political leaders fight their battle of political oneupmanship. In her stint as chief minister in 2003, the Bahujan Samaj Party leader, Mayavati, had drawn much attention to the Taj when she tried to go ahead with her plan of building her infamous ?corridor? on the west bank of the Yamuna for recreational activities for tourists. The then Union minister for tourism, Jagmohan, blew the whistle on Mayavati, who then found herself on a collision course with the Centre.

 After a year as chief minister, Mulayam Singh finds himself drawn as inexplicably to the Taj as Mayavati had been. He has unveiled a six-month long itinerary around the Taj on the plea of promoting tourism. This has led to a worsening of his relations with the Centre, which has cold-shouldered his plan. But Mulayam Singh?s enthusiasm about the Taj was supposed to be a message for Mayavati ? to show her how, despite her trying to destroy it, the former had endeavoured to protect it. 

 However, if Mayavati?s move to go ahead with the Taj corridor betrayed her lack of respect for rules of conservation, the Samajwadi Party leader?s use of the Taj shows a similar will to ride roughshod over regulations that seek to protect the country?s heritage.

 Mulayam Singh?s tourism officers went their own way to plan a huge cultural show on Mehtab Bag on the other side of the Yamuna. They decided to illuminate the Taj the way it was done up during the Yanni show in the Nineties, and planned similar cultural shows on the site of all the monuments in Agra. And finally, they wanted night-viewing to be reinstated, without caring to take into account what this might mean to the fragile environs of the Taj. However, the Uttar Pradesh tourism ministry, apparently, did not flout any Archaeological Survey of India norm. All the programmes were organized at sites 500 metres away from the monument. But, as protection experts point out, this is not enough.

 As the Supreme Court also repeatedly reminded the state government, there needs to be an impact assessment report done on each programme and submitted to experts, which would then be the basis of the court judgment. The state government itself has to do its own bit for protecting the monument before launching any such programme. The existing reports on the decaying state of the Taj were unambiguous in their assessment. The officers should have gone through them to acquaint themselves with the ways in which heritage sites like the Taj, the Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri need to be protected. 

 As far as the Taj is concerned, the monument is facing threats from both man-made and natural forces. A report as early as 1940 had warned about how the four minarets had begun to bend from their axis, how cracks had surfaced and how the structure had begun to tilt. One of the key factors causing Taj?s decay is the drying of the area, including the siltation of the Yamuna. The builders of the monument chose this site because the river was wide. The abundance of water and the flourishing greenery at Mehtab Bag was supposed to protect the Taj from the dust and pollution borne by the north-westernly wind. The wind is still there, but not the expanse of water in the river. Even 20 years back, the Yamuna used to have a lot of water during the monsoon. Now even in monsoon, it looks like a dirty nullah.

 The lack of moisture in the ambience, the smoke and dust have been taking its toll. The Supreme Court has reasons to be worried over the failure of the state to take note of the environment assessment reports. 

 The state government, on its part, smelt a Central government conspiracy in the issue. The chief minister was clearly annoyed on September 27, when he inaugurated the 350 years of the Taj programme. ?Such a rich heritage of Taj co-exist with the poor Agra. The night-viewing would surely have boosted the local economy. It is unfortunate. To get a clearance for that from court the state government has to deploy big advocates to fight a long, legal battle?, he said.

 Mulayam Singh went on to deplore the way the number of foreign tourists was decreasing in Agra, ?It is about a two lakh fall in the annual turnout of foreign tourists?, Mulayam Singh reminded the congregation at the Agra fort. ?Come what may, we will promote event tourism in Agra and watch out, you can see a remarkable change in Agra?s economy?, exhorted Agra?s member of parliament, Raj Babbar, stubbornly.

 Both Mulayam Singh and Raj Babbar may have made a point by arguing that tourism is the driving force behind the local economy. But the dwindling economy of the district of Agra as well as the rest of the state may be because of other reasons. Let?s start with a basic question. Why hasn?t Agra been spruced up? Why does everyone who come to watch the Taj prefer not to stay back in the city for the night? The hotel industry here is in fact facing a slump. Among the reasons for this are the steady decimation of the city?s infrastructure and increasing encroachment in the vicinity of the monument, which makes the place more and more unattractive.

 The roads are narrow and congested. The educated, unemployed hang out on the streets without engagement. It may not be bad to cash in on history, but this alone is not enough to have a tourism industry running. To save Agra from an economic apocalypse, the city needs a visionary. Khajuraho had reacted to a similar problem by planning to open a casino to stop tourists from running away. The move, it goes without saying, had kicked up a storm. 

 But one does not need to go as far as that. Cleaning up the city, diversification, altering the goals of tourism, tying up government departments to make the visit to Agra more than worth the tourists? money are surer and better ways of protecting Agra from dying out. The Bharatpur bird sanctuary is just 36 kilometres away from Agra. Can?t the two state governments of Rajasthan and UP team up to promote green tourism?

 Perhaps no. Political will and sensitivity are one thing and political rhetoric another. A small cultural programme on September 27 was a specimen of how the state officers had taken liberties with the ASI norms. On that day, hundreds of vehicles of VVIPs thundered through the fragile passage leading to the patch of green inside the Diwan-e-aam of the Agra Fort, where the programme was organized. 

 The ASI, which had given permission to the state government to hold the programme, is clearly not happy. It has received reports that security vehicles of the VVIPS had been allowed to ply through the old monument, giving off toxic diesel and petrol effluents. The ASI will be sending a report to the Supreme Court on this. It is obvious that all this negative publicity has hit the state government hard. But is it all without good reason?

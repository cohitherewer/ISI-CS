 A CONSUMER?S WORLD, AFTER ALL

Shoveling Smoke: Advertising and Globalization in 

Contemporary India 

By William Mazzarella,

Oxford, Rs 595

The author calls this book an ethnographic study of 

mass consumerism in India?s globalized marketplace. It is set in the world of 

India?s advertising business. In part, this book outlines how advertising for 

national consumer goods is produced in metropolitan India, and also the anxieties, 

commitments and contradictions that accompany this practice.

 Mazzarella rightly notes that as a key spokesman for, and direct beneficiaries of, the new consumerist dispensation, the Indian marketing and advertising business scaled unprecedented heights in the Eighties and Nineties. As a consequence, both their practices and statements became the flashpoints for the ideological discussions of the day.

 The author theorizes the practice of advertising as a kind of public cultural production ? the production of the image of a commodity. Through a discussion of the Kamasutra condom campaign, he examines the manner in which consumerism in the Eighties was put forward by the Indian advertising business as an alternative social ontology. 

 He analyses the specific content and career of the Kamasutra campaign itself: ?In particular I have tried to show how the notion of an aspirational community, which arrived in the 1980?s as the model of society united by distinction, depends upon the doubleness of the aesthetic, a doubleness?becomes mobilized through the form of the commodity image.?

 Mazzarella dispels the apprehension that consumerist globalization may lead to ?cultural imperialism?. On the contrary, he feels, it provided an opportunity for a ?comprehensive revitalization of Indianness?. Globalization per se and therefore its brokers ? the local advertising and marketing industries, were rehabilitated as a force for ?cultural effervescence? and Indian pride vis-?-vis the rest of the world.

 Again, globalization acquired a populist face through a revival of the representation of consumerism as an ?unbeatable sensitive index? to the innermost needs of the population. Ironically, given the way the value of foreign brands was embedded in the postcolonial politics of distinction, globalization was being seen by many commentators as an opportunity to redress the humiliations of the colonial experience.

 In sum, the triangular interaction between consumerism, globalization and advertising in all its ramifications has been well-analysed by the author. The long list of works cited can be of immense value to researchers in this field. However the author?s penchant for stiff expressions could occasionally make it a rough journey for the reader.

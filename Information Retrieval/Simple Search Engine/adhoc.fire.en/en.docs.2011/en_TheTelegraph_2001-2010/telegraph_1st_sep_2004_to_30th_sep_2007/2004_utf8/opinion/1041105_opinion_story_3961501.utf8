 Paperback Pickings

 Strong among the barbarians

The Arts In Britain: A History (Pimlico, 

?5.80) by Roy Strong is a useful, but expectedly conservative, ?comprehensive 

introductory overview? of the arts in Britain, written as a continuous unfolding 

narrative. It came out in 1999, and this is a new edition in paperback, with fewer 

pictures, to make people read, rather than merely look at, the book. The earliest 

reference to Britain is in Virgil?s ?First Eclogue?, where the Britons are described 

as ?cut off...by the whole width of the world?. Strong starts here and ends with 

an epilogue on consumer culture, ?the barbarians of commercialism already at the 

gates of civilization? (shades of Kenneth Clark). In between are Camelot, The 

Faerie Queene, the Earl of Arundel (above), Horace Walpole, Prince Albert 

and the Royal Opera House. Strong feels the need for this rather fastidiously 

distinguished panorama because of what is happening to the arts in Britain now 

? ?squeezed out of the curriculum and fashionable fads such as political correctness 

re-presenting the past as though through a distorting glass?. Strong sketches 

in his own achievements in the introduction: ?I have spent half a century looking, 

reading and listening to everything connected with the arts in Britain, both past 

and present. In addition I have directed two major national collections, the National 

Portrait Gallery and the Victoria amp; Albert Museum, both of which have enshrined 

within them much of what any educated person would regard as the essence of our 

civilization.? 

Wind Flowers: Contemporary Malayalam Short Fiction 

(Penguin, Rs 250) edited by V. Abdulla and R.E. Asher is an 

elegant collection of English translations of the works of such eminent writers 

in Malayalam as Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, O.V. Vijayan, 

Kamala Das, Sarah Joseph, Paul Zachariah and M.T. Vasudevan Nair. Abdulla was 

an important publisher and translator in Kerala and Asher is professor emeritus 

of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh.

Look After Yourself...No One Else Will (Blackie, 

? 7.99) by M.S. Rao is subtitled ?How to bypass the medical profession 

and stay healthy?. Rao describes himself as a ?wholistic [sic] medical 

practitioner? who ?wrests control from the doctor and puts us in charge of health, 

illness and treatment?. For Rao this attitude to mainstream medical practice is 

an expression of a philosophical position (?doubt everything?), as well as a political 

stance in favour of ?participatory democracy? and ?freedom of information?. But 

this is also a highly readable practical guidebook, with sections on illnesses 

and their treatment, diet, alternative therapies and women?s health.

Martin Luther King, Jr. (Routledge, Rs 350) 

by Peter J. Ling is part of the new Routledge Historical Biographies series, 

which provides ?engaging, readable and academically credible biographies written 

from an explicitly historical perspective?. Ling is an American Studies specialist 

and his approach to this celebrated African-American is through a thorough re-examination 

of the Civil Rights Movement, showing how King grew into his leadership role and 

kept his faith when the movement weakened after 1965. There is a handy chronology, 

a glossary of organizations and a guide to further reading. This photograph shows 

King sitting in a jail cell in the Jefferson County Courthouse on November 3, 

1967.

 Letters to Editor

 Little master, long shadow 

 Sir ? Ask any cricket-lover, and he will tell you that Zaheer Khan?s world record of the highest score by a no. 11 batsman is a bigger story than a double-century by Sachin Tendulkar. And this is because the surprise factor in the first achievement ? even if the opponent is Bangladesh ? is completely absent from the second. India, and the world, expects Tendulkar to score many more tons and double-tons, but a 75-run innings from Zaheer Khan comes once in a long time. But who will tell that to our press and media, slaves that they are to the market? As if the lists of achievements and comparisons with Sunil Gavaskar the previous day were not enough, on Zaheer Khan?s day too, the spotlight remained trained on Sachin ?tennis elbow? Tendulkar, senior by several playing years to Khan. This is hardly the way to encourage young players to put in their best for the country.

 Yours faithfully,

 A.C. Chandra, Calcutta

 Talk of the show

 Sir ? The complimentary cards issued for Salman Rushdie?s ?talk-show? in Calcutta categorically assured everyone seats on a ?first-come-first-served? principle. What they did not say was that the best seats would be reserved for the VIP guests. Had the so-called VIPs really turned up, the senseless bias would have been vindicated. Rushdie himself could not have been happy to see a number of empty seats in the first ten or twelve rows, fiercely guarded by impassive security personnel and incorrigible on-the-spot organizers. The episode could lead us to question who are really interested in a particular event. If Rushdie and his wife could arrive early in the auditorium to give a no-holds-barred photo-session, why was the audience threatened with dire consequences for carrying cameras? It did not occur to the organizers, perhaps, that people might want to take pictures of their favourite author which the press photographers were freely allowed to do. Mobile phones were not allowed either, but the organizers were seen using them inside the auditorium. More paranoia does not necessarily ensure better organization. Less fuss often does. 

 The questions put to Rushdie could have been filtered. The moderator seemed to be in a bit of a hurry to wind up the talk. Had the table been properly fitted, it could have spared us all an embarrassing moment. Without intending to crib or nitpick, I must say that a little fine-tuning is all that was required. I am nevertheless grateful to The Telegraph for bringing Salman Rushdie to our city.

 Yours faithfully,

Shyama Prasad Choudhury, Calcutta

 Doodling Yankees

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha sounds rather immature and rash when he says that ?the sporting preferences of the Americans are a sign of their cultural backwardness? (?The sports of empire?, Dec 11). The sports played by a country, or the food eaten by its people, or the dresses worn by them are not the yardsticks for measuring the country?s cultural forwardness. Americans know how to form a queue, an American office staff wishes a customer on their first meeting, an American driver stops or slows his car if he finds someone crossing the road. Yes, these are my experiences from the United States of America, which I would certainly consider as a superior culture. 

 I myself do not like baseball or basketball or American food, also Korean food, but I cannot say that Americans or Koreans have a backward culture. We, Indians, urinate and spit on the streets, fight in railway compartments for a seat, push aside others to get to the front of queues. And yet, we are the flag-bearers of a great culture. How would it feel to have an American journalist castigating it? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is true that the games the Americans play are reflective of their personal as well as national character. On the other hand, the games the British passed on to us are of a different order. While cricket is by definition a gentleman?s game, soccer hinges on artistry and footwork. These games are a combination of elegance, intelligence and art, all of which Americans lack. The games they play are a raw exhibition of power and brute force. Baseball, for instance, is played with a caveman?s club, and the way people barge into each other in American football could throw light on a number of recent American misadventures such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and even Abu Ghraib. 

 No wonder neither baseball nor American football is an Olympic sport. These sports illustrate that Americans are brutal even in their leisure. Such traits are hardly the characteristics of a cultured society. These are reflected not only in their games, but also in their fashion and lifestyle. The sooner we realize this and stop aping them, the better.

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur

 The voice that was

 Sir ? The demise of M.S. Subbulakshmi has created a void in the world of Carnatic music that will be impossible to fill. Not only because she had mesmerized millions with her voice, but also because her dedication to her profession was unparalleled. It is remarkable and worthy of mention that she had donated most of her financial rewards to charitable institutions. How many of our current crop of singing stars can claim to have done that? It would be a fitting tribute to MS if the government insistutes an award in her name to be awarded each year to the best Carnatic singer in the country.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

 Sir ? The readers of The Telegraph are not surprised to find the news of M.S. Subbulakshmi?s death appear unaccompanied by a photograph of the singer. There was no formal obituary either. But when the Calcutta daily could give a similar treatment to Kanika Bandyopadhyay and Basanta Chowdhury ? two of the biggest cultural icons of Bengal ? why should one expect it to go out of its way to bid farewell to an exponent of Carnatic music?

 Yours faithfully,

Sipra Sengupta, Calcutta

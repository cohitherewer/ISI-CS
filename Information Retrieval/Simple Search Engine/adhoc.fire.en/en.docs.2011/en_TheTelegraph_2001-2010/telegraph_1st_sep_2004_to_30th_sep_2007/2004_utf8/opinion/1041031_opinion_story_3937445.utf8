 Letters to Editor

 They also make steel

 Sir ? Indians have little to rejoice at the news of Lakshmi Mittal becoming the world?s largest steelmaker (?Merger moulds steel superman? Oct 26). His company till now has not made any significant investments in India and it is doubtful whether there will be any in the near future. Mittal?s group has expanded simply by acquiring small sick steel plants all over the world. Unlike Nippon Steel of Japan, which has revolutionized steel technology, Mittal has little to be proud of.

 Yours faithfully,

Raja Sen, Dhanbad

 At your service

 Sir ? Bibek Debroy in ?Running the dawk? (Oct 27), has pressed for the corporatization of the Indian postal service on the lines of the British system. This is a great idea no doubt, but this alone cannot ensure optimum efficiency. If postal services remain a public sector undertaking or ?public limited? company, the consequences are well-known. It will continue to be a loss-making unit, which the government will try to subsidize. The only solution is to privatize it, with a negligible government share. More government control means more political interference and trade unionism. For now, it is necessary to computerize post offices, ensure discipline through proper training and monitoring, delivery on schedule and greater flexibility in operations.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Our postal system needs a dose of modernization which can only come through competition and its transformation into a business enterprise, if not a public limited company. The same should be done with Indian Railways. 

 But Europe tells a different story. Look at the vastly improved railways of France and Germany, both of which are nationalized as compared to the privatized British rail system which is in a shambles. In both France and Germany, the railways operate as a corporate entity unlike in India. A vast railway network such as India?s cannot operate efficiently with bickering private firms, but it should certainly undergo a dose of corporatization. This will bring greater efficiency and transparency.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Indian postal services is a fossilized remnant of the raj, but still the only choice of the poor in remote areas. Its corporatization might affect its services in rural areas since the focus might get shifted to ensuring greater efficiency in the urban zones. Contrary to what Bibek Debroy thinks, there are still people who cannot afford to pay for ?better? services. 

 Yours faithfully,

L. Mahanta, Dhubri

 Forsaken place

 Sir ? Anyone visiting the temples of Raja-Rani, Siddeshwar and Mukteshwar or the Lingaraj Mandir in Bhubaneswar should be prepared to get a shock of his lifetime. Besides the temples being poorly maintained and unclean, the first two temples have become a haven for anti-social elements. The way such historical temples are being maintained in Tamil Nadu and other parts of southern India is to be seen to be believed. 

 It is unfortunate that even though Bhubaneswar has several major temples which have been anointed ?protected monuments?, the Archaeological Survey of India is yet to spend on the upkeep of these structures. Given that Orissa has a flourishing tourism industry, the chief minister should take up the issue with the Central tourism ministry and ASI so that sufficient funds are allotted for the preservation of these rare historical monuments.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

 Letters to Editor

 Milk of human frailty

 Sir Poor Daya Nand, the Haryana milkman who was sentenced to jail for plying his trade following the norms passed down to him by his ancestors (Milkman in hot water, Sept 1). What would happen if our law-keepers were to put every milkman who sold diluted milk behind bars? And what of the poor quality of milk supplied by the government milk-producers? I remember the deposits of cream on top of the milk bottles which came from the state governments milk plant in Haringhata. Why punish Daya Nand alone?

 Yours faithfully,

Samir Banerjee, Calcutta

 City of indifference

 Sir I got stranded in a traffic jam at Esplanade on September 1, because the left parties and their followers had taken out their dreaded mahamichhil. From the posters the marchers carried, it appeared that one of the issues was protest against American aggression on Iraq. As far as I know, communist philosophy believes in the existence of only two categories of people in the world the exploited class and the exploiter class. The two are locked in an eternal fight on whether profit accrued through production and sales is filtering down to the actual producers. It was quite obvious that for the enthusiastic rallyists, the United States of America is the exploiter and Saddam Hussein the exploited. But is it fair to regard a dictator who curbed his own peoples right for freedom of expression and speech, as exploited? 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir The picture on the front page on September 2 brought tears to my eyes (No time to pause for Calcuttas dead. Iraq, of course, is more important). But that was perhaps because I was not part of the mahamichhil, far away from the city that I am. Had I been walking along with the sea of humanity, who knows, a lifeless body in the middle of a road would have failed to get my attention too. Kudos to Amit Datta for being such a sensitive bearer of the camera. We cry for Iraq, we protest against injustice in other countries, but do not pause to look at our own backyards. What use do the people of Iraq have for the compassion of the people of Calcutta? Will it help them secure a better living? If it wont, then why make it difficult for the people of the city to earn their daily wages? Singapore, without any resource of its own, is successful because of an absence of rallies and bandhs and policies directed towards the well being of the citizens.

 To show our concern, we do not need a bandh or a rally to disrupt the normal functioning of the city. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chaitali Tarafdar, Singapore

 Sir Nothing could have illustrated better the double standards in our everyday lives than the picture of a dead woman on a rain-soaked road, passed by thousands of men and women rallying for the cause of Iraq. It is good to know, however, that there are a few sensitive people around us still, who play the role of the little boy in the story about the emperors new clothes. Are we going to ponder for a moment before moving on to the more important things in our lives?

 Yours faithfully,

Sarbani Datta Gupta, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir In the finance bill 2004, there is a provision to raise the threshold for stamp duty charged on receipts. This means that transactions which required revenue stamps worth Rs 500 would now require 5000-rupee stamps. Since the bill has been passed without discussion, it is the governments duty to notify people through advertisements in the media.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Banerji, Chennai

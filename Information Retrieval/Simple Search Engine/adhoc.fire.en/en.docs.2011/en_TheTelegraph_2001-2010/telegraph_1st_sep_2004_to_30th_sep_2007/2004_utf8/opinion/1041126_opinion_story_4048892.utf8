 LEFT OVER

 Impeach the prime minister. How quaint it sounds now ? almost as absurd as the Queen of Heart?s ?Off with his head!? The motion to impeach Mr Tony Blair over Iraq has turned into a joke even before it has been formally defeated in parliament. The idea was launched by the heterodox socialist MP, Mr Adam Price, of the Welsh Plaid Cymru. Mr Price?s motion asks the Speaker to set up a committee of MPs to investigate Mr Blair?s conduct in the run-up to the Iraq war, and decide if there are grounds to set up a criminal trial of the prime minister, with the lords acting as judges. The last time such a thing happened was in 1806, when Henry Dundas, an ally of William Pitt the Younger, faced impeachment for financial misconduct in the French wars. Medieval impeachment was revived by parliament against Charles I?s ministers, and was famously brought to effect against Warren Hastings at the end of the 18th century. The dusty volumes from the parliamentary library would tell Mr Price that impeachment can be theoretically used for ?high crimes and misdemeanours beyond the reach of law or which no other authority of the state will prosecute?.

 Mr Blair has been cleared already by four separate inquiries in Britain. Mr Bush is still the president of the United States of America. And Falluja has fallen. So the 20-odd MPs and a rag-tag band of dissenting writers, actors and rock-stars, who want to bring Mr Blair to trial, can only be made to look like Guy Fawks?s straw men ? harmlessly and ridiculously obsolete. It is time to move on from such notions as misleading parliament, fabricating WMDs, undermining the constitution, or even international law and democratic accountability. In the same way, when Vanessa and Corin Redgrave take time off Shakespeare and cinema to start the Peace and Progress party, and talk about decency and human rights, Guantanamo and asylum policy, they are only those dear old lefties, left over from the Sixties and Seventies.

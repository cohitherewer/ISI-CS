 Letters to Editor

 Behind enemy lines

 Sir ? As the report, ?Buddha turns US best bet? (Oct 13), shows, the votaries of economic reforms have lately found a way to get around left obstructionism ? invest in West Bengal. It?s wonderful for the state, of course, which, had been starved of fresh investments. But just because the left have taken up cudgels on behalf of American MNCs doesn?t mean that the latter have become saints. It just means that the poor and the exploited now have one political formation less to fight for them. 

 Yours faithfully,

 R.P. Sharma, Calcutta

 Fickle fame

 Sir ? Ravi Shankar and Ramachandra Guha lament Rabindranath Tagore?s lack of international fame and then irrationally blame the Bengalis for protecting their hero (Freeing our heroes?, Oct 2). Just like a person seeking the truth will arrive at the Bhagavad Gita, Koran or the Bible, any person who likes literature will arrive at Tagore. Blaming Bengalis for not marketing Tagore adequately is ludicrous. Just as fine wine cannot be rushed, the works of Tagore cannot be thrust upon the masses. 

 Ravi Shankar may have gained his 15 minutes of international fame in the West by jumping on to the Beatles bandwagon, but is it a lasting or a fleeting fame? Many years from now, Tagore?s work will remain, he will be better known and his genius more acclaimed, but it is questionable whether the widely-marketed Ravi Shankar will have the same impact.

 Yours faithfully,

Diya Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? We have failed to project our dead heroes in own own land, let alone glorify them abroad. So taken up are Indians by sectarian interests that they ignore all those concerns which do not serve these. Add to this their blind following of Western ideals. No wonder the houses of our literary giants and other historical monuments are in such a dilapidated state. Is it surprising that foreigners continue to have half-baked perceptions of India? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? Aveek Sen?s cogitations on a letter written 100 years ago by Rabindranath Tagore to his niece, Indira Devi, led me to bring down my copy of Chhinnapatra. My copy of the letter ends with the poet?s observations on a portrait of Beethoven hanging in his cabin. It is obvious that Tagore was aware of Beethoven?s deafness and also of his explosive genius. In 1894, there were no discs of recorded music, nor were there any phonographs to play them. The previous owner of the boat may have been enchanted by Beethoven?s masterpieces and may have hung up the portrait of the composer on the cabin of his boat. The portrait of Beethoven was probably already there when the poet procured the boat. But when and where did Tagore listen to Beethoven? Before 1894, Tagore made two journeys to Europe, as a student in 1878 and again for a short period in 1890. During his first visit, he stayed two years in England. It is possible that during this period, he had occasion to attend concerts of orchestral music and also operas, and thus learnt to appreciate (and assimilate) the nuances of classical Western music. 

 Could Sen throw some light on this?

 Yours faithfully,

Manojendu Majumdar, Calcutta

 Written in the stars

 Sir ? The income tax department?s advertisement in The Telegraph on October 13, 2004 goes, ?Whatever your stars may foretell, after filling your tax returns you can be sure of one thing...? Is it not unfortunate that the department is encouraging an occult practice like astrology?

 Yours faithfully,

 Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Letters to Editor

 Viewers? choice

 Sir ? Somnath Chatterjee seems to be in a time warp. He perhaps thinks that India continues to have only one television channel and whatever the government prescribes, the people must see. No wonder he was angry with Prasar Bharati officials for telecasting the India-South Africa test match instead of Zero Hour deliberations in Parliament (?DD picks cricket, gets House stick?, Dec 3). But the officials only had the interests of Prasar Bharati in mind. With the option of a hundred channels, it is the consumer who decides what he will see. By beaming Zero Hour on DD, people cannot be forced to see what their MPs are doing, burning up taxpayers? money. If live TV debates between American presidential candidates can make way for a baseball match, why cannot Zero Hour be adjusted with cricket, especially if the speaker thinks it is so important that Indians should see it? 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 No foreigners please

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra in ?Reforms gone haywire? (Nov 29) makes the point that foreign participation in a country?s development can only be at the cost of the domestic producers and consumers. While misplaced policy-making and hasty approval for Enron-like projects should by shunned, I am shocked at the forcefulness with which Mitra (mis)characterizes all efforts by Indian policy-makers to involve foreign participation of some sort. 

 In the Fifties, many developing countries, including India, adopted import substitution policies in the belief that protecting trade would lead to industrialization and growth. By the Eighties, the failure of this strategy and the social costs and inefficiencies associated with it were demonstrated in a number of studies, of which I am sure Mitra is aware. 

 Interpreting reduction in tariffs as subsidy to foreign firms is crude and biased economic thinking. In 1991, India?s average tariff rate was 128 per cent and the maximum, 355 per cent. Any economist will agree that such high levels of distortions are harmful to consumers as well as producers and cannot lead to growth in the long run. We live in a globally integrated world and it is na?ve of policy-makers to even imagine keeping the country in isolation. Mitra seems to be suggesting just that ? at least so one infers, since he remains characteristically mum about what alternatives India has to a cautious liberalization policy in order to foster growth and competition.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra has at last had a revelation ? that serving foreign interest is a sin. Will Ashok Mitra now declare that opposing the Indian freedom struggle and working as agents of the British during World War II were not an innocent mistake but a sin; working in this country to further the interest of foreign communists was a sin; and that opposing the Indians during the Chinese aggression in 1962 was a sin? As also his ideas on Kashmir, opposing India and supporting the claims of Pakistan and China, which are against the national interest and in furtherance of foreign interests, are a sin? However, it is doubtful whether he ? his thoughts stunted by 19th century dogma ? realizes the paradox and fallacy of his arguments.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra sees the world through a Marxist haze and allows his biases to colour his opinions. His views are always rabidly anti- American, anti-rich, anti-capitalist. If foreigners are so bad, why did his comrades in the West Bengal government invite McKinsey to come to their rescue? Why did they spread out the red carpet for Bill Gates and sundry other CEOs to induce them to invest in the state? Not everything foreign is good, but to say that everything foreign is bad is stupid. From Satyajit Ray to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, all go to the West for medical treatment. 

 Besides, his theory that the government does not want to lower excise duties on petroleum because it would offer relief to domestic consumers makes no sense. Why will the politicians not reduce duties to lower prices and thus garner votes? Can Mitra answer why the left government in the state did not reduce duties on petroleum, the highest in India? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra wants to turn the clock and take India back to the licence raj. His concerns about Enron are justified. However, the debacle at Dabhol was not caused by economic reforms, but by a mismanagement of the bidding system. Mitra?s concerns about free trade are laughable. Just two decades ago, the cars on the street were prehistoric, colour TV was rare, and computers and mobile phones were beyond the reach of the middle class. Economic liberalization has brought in competition, which has brought down prices and kicked laggard Indian companies into shape. Mitra talks about the problems of Indian farmers after the opening up of the agricultural sector, but he forgets that the real blame should lie with the socialist mindset which has resulted in the fragmentation of farms and made difficult farmers? access to credit.

 Also why should we pay high taxes? Has the government given us good infrastructure, a conducive business environment, good public services or healthy law and order conditions? Yes, foreigners know more than us in many sectors. It is the refusal to accept this that has held us back. The consumer has no nationality, especially in a poor country like India. We want the best and the cheapest, desi or not.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

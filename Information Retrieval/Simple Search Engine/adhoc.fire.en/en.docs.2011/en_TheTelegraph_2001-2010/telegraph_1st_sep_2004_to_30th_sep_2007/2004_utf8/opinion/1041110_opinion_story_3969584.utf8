 Letters to Editor

 Second coming

 Sir ? In voting George W. Bush into power for a second term, the American people have endorsed his policies at home and abroad, and now must bear the retrospective blame for the invasion of Iraq and the detention of innocents at Guantanamo Bay. They have chosen religious fundamentalism, political unilateralism, continued influence-peddling by big corporate entities, and further erosion of civil liberties in return for a wholly illusory sense of security. One hopes they did so conscious of the consequence of their actions. On second thoughts, the Democrats would have done much better to chose a candidate who was radically different from Bush, instead of John Kerry who was a clone of the former on virtually every issue. Also with Bush?s victory Indian astrologers have established a perfect record of failure in their political predictions this year. First they claimed the BJP would win; then, that the UPA would collapse in September; and now, that Kerry would win. Can there be a better illustration of the idiocy of astrology?

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir ? This time, unlike in 2000, George W. Bush has won a decisive mandate. Although the differential margin was only 3 per cent, it translated into a convincing 3.5 million votes. Bush is thus the first president of the United States of America, since his father in 1988, to have won an outright majority. There were also no allegations of serious electoral misconduct during this year?s presidential polls, even though each party had kept about 10,000 lawyers on standby. Even in the clincher in Ohio, Bush won convincingly despite the fact that the state faced significant job losses and other economic problems during his first term. To rub salt into the Democrats? wound, the Republicans have also secured a comfortable majority in both the US Senate and House of Representatives.

 All these lead one to conclude that politically America has moved to the right, as Swapan Dasgupta contends in ?In their own hands? (Nov 5). Nine-eleven has changed the mindset of America. The average American now values personal and national security above everything and has clearly reposed faith in Bush as the nation?s ?saviour? in the strategic ?war on terror?. It would be wrong to assume that Bush?s support base is restricted to the Christian right and the conservatives since, compared to 2000, greater numbers of minority black and Hispanic voters favoured Bush.

 Whether Bush, with his new found ?compassionate conservatism?, now reaches out to his opponents within America and outside in an attempt to achieve the ?centre ground? remains to be seen. As for the Democrats, they cannot hope to capture the presidency if they do not carry at least some of ?middle? America with them. Winning ?liberal? coastal states like California and New York is clearly not enough. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? I agree with the editorial, ?Divided Empire? (Nov 5), about the US being a divided country. George W. Bush will, in all probability, not pursue a middle path that will unify the country. While the editorial cites divisive policies like gay marriage and abortion, it overlooks the storm brewing over the patriot act, which expires on December 31, 2005. Created in the name of the war on terror, this act restricts the civil liberties of Americans of foreign descent; those with black and brown skin stand at a higher risk of abuse. Also worrisome for aspiring India students, visa policies may not get any easier in the second Bush regime, and finding funding in universities may be harder. I also anticipate a large spending cut in American universities to contain the mounting fiscal deficit.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Bush?s victory brings to mind the way the people of Gujarat voted Narendra Modi back to power. In sum, Bush seems to have played on the fears of not just the Americans but of people all over the world.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is good that all the efforts of the Boss and his party of peaceniks, who depicted Bush as short on grey matter, a liar, and made him the butt of rude jokes, have been defeated. It is only someone strong and resolute like Bush who can hope to counter the Islamic fanatics.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? George W. Bush?s victory should not surprise at all. Despite being unable to capture Osama bin Laden or combat terrorism effectively, Bush has been chosen over John Kerry because the former is considered the best person to deal with terrorism. He is thought to be someone whose first priority is the safety of his people no matter what he has to do to ensure it. Americans have proved that oil has more value for them than blood. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Nazia Sultana, Gaya

 Sir ? The headline, ?Bush Kerries On? (Nov 4) is, even by The Telegraph?s very low headline standards, rather ridiculous ? it trivializes an election that is expected to have serious echoes in the US and in most parts of the world. Mainstream Indian newspaper editors should keep in mind that in these 24/7 web-edition times, the printed word is accessible to anyone anywhere. Juvenile headlines reflect poorly on a country that has an otherwise excitingly vibrant media.

 Yours faithfully,

Rupali Ghosh, Tokyo

 Sir ? It will not be wrong to say that the Osama tape proved the masterstroke for George W. Bush?s re-election campaign. I feel sorry for John Kerry who had a more pragmatic line on all major issues like Iraq, terrorism and unemployment. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shadab Ahsan, Gaya

 Sir ? The American voters? choice did not surprise me. Having a new president now when the world is tackling such a grave problem as terrorism would have certainly given the extremists an edge. But I am baffled over the timing of Osama bin Laden?s taped message. The renewal of his threat appears well-calculated, but what was it intended to do? From India?s point of view, Dubya?s re-election is a good development. It means that our policymakers will not have to redefine their policies. Had a new president come in, they would have been scratching their heads over security and trade issues, especially outsourcing and terrorism. Our leaders must now extract the maximum benefit from the favourable scenario.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? George W. Bush?s re-election has ominous global implications. Gallup polls indicate that Bush was preferred mainly by Americans who were highly religious and went to church once or more times in a week. Who would have anticipated that? After all this was an election in the 21st century, in America, not in west Asia. Reportedly, a large number of Catholic voters turned away from John Kerry, a Catholic, and voted for Bush, a Protestant, because of the latter?s strong anti-abortion stance. Now, many in the US fear that Bush will appoint more ?pro-life? judges in the supreme court, in a bid to over-turn the historic Roe versus Wade ruling and make abortion a ?crime? even when the pregnancy is the result of rape. Homosexuality is another area where Bush enjoys the support of the religious right. In these elections, citizens in 11 states were asked whether they supported a ban on gay marriage and all eleven voted to approve the measure. The Bush regime is also likely to continue with the ban on federal funding for stem cell research under pressure from radical religious groups, bringing to a halt this critical area of medical innovation. 

 Another striking feature of the US elections has been the division of support for the candidates depending on geographical location. The east and west coast states overwhelmingly voted against Bush, while the south, south-east and most of the middle strongly favoured him. Also, while most people in the cities favoured Kerry, the entire rural community voted for Bush. This picture of America will disconcert people in India for most of whom the US is a land where religious or sexual discriminations are virtually non-existent. 

 Contrast this with India, where a political leader would surely be kicked out of office if only one religious group favoured him. Bush?s victory has thus set back in time not just the Americans but the entire world. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

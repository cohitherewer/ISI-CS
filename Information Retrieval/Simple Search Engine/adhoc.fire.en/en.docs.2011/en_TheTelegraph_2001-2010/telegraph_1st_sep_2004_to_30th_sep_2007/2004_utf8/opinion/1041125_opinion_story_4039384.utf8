 HUNGER STRIKE

 Fasting once in a while is good for health. The leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party must have had this well-known medical dictum in mind when they decided to undertake a relay hunger-strike to protest against the arrest of the seer of Kanchi. In a country that has seen far too many futile demonstrations of protest, this one probably takes the cake. It had no impact. Not a murmur of sympathy was heard for the seer or for the BJP leaders. The relay hunger-strike was an exercise in futility. This futility is a reflection of a profound crisis of identity within the BJP. Under the leadership of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and during its tenure in power, the BJP moved away from Hindutva. It did not jettison Hindutva, but the latter was not the prime mover of its programme and its actions. Mr Vajpayee made governance the most important item on the agenda of the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance. Out of power, the BJP is like a rudderless ship. There is an undertow within the BJP to take the party back to its Hindutva moorings. There is also a force that wants to keep the BJP a pro-liberalization and a modernist party. This contradiction is yet to be discussed and resolved within the party.

 It would appear though from current trends that the pro-Hindutva lobby within the BJP is prevailing over the other one. Mr Vajpayee, when he joined the hunger-strike, kept the company of certain elements whose religious fanaticism and obscurantism cannot, in any way, be reconciled with an emphasis on modernism. The view that the seer of Kanchi should be treated with special care because of his religious standing is utterly spurious and out of tune with the spirit of modern law. Everybody is equal in the eyes of the law; a person?s religious standing should be of no consequence to the judiciary and to the custodians of law and order. There is a strong propensity within the BJP ? and even Mr Vajpayee is not free from this propensity ? to treat the seer as being above the rule of law. Unfortunately, the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, has also voiced similar sentiments. Mr Singh should be aware of the consequences of making concessions to ?soft? Hindutva. If both the present prime minister and his predecessor have their eyes on the Hindu vote, they would do well to remember that the arrest of the Kanchi seer had little or no impact on the Hindu mind.

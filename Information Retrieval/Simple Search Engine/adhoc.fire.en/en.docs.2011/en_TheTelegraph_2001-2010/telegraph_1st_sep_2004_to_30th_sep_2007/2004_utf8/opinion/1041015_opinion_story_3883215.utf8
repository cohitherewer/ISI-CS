 WAY TO GO

 The ministers of West Bengal are ever preoccupied with weighty matters. So devoted are they to the metaphysical aspects of their onerous duties that they are quite oblivious to the physical pain and discomfort that afflict every ordinary traveller on Calcutta roads. It is not as if Calcutta has special secret roads for ministers to travel on. Yet the horrifying disrepair of the city?s roads seems to have escaped the ministers? notice. And some of them find it extremely irritating that the high court should, in response to a public interest litigation, actually ask for something to be done about the roads, and expect the urban development minister to be present in court as chairman of the Kolkata Municipal Development Authority. This is really not the court?s business, feels the chief minister, and some other ministers after him. Working out the bounds of the court?s exact jurisdiction is, no doubt, far more important than repairing roads and pavements that are the source of not mere discomfort, but serious danger. Twisted ankles and hurt backs are only to be expected, but what is far more dangerous is the possibility of broken limbs from falls, especially in ill-lit areas in the evening. The congestion just before the pujas has been exacerbated by the agonizing slowness of cars because of the road surface, although even that is not enough to prevent damage to the machines.

 But there has been some response to the high court?s strictures. The government is going to release Rs 8 crore for smoothing out the potholes before the pujas, although some of the money allocated for Salt Lake will also be used for repairs after the festival is over. This promises some relief, if the work is done, but it underlines the ad hoc nature of the cure. There are really more questions than answers. How is it that so many roads, some recently mended or widened or given a shiny surface, concertedly show such deterioration with a little use and some help from the rain? Why do so many roads remain partly fenced off for unending repairs, causing traffic jams as the holiday season nears? For how long have busy thoroughfares, such as Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and College Street, been deteriorating? In this context, the evil-minded may be tempted to ask how quickly the proposed pothole coverings will wear off. The people of Calcutta hope they will last the season. It is too much to hope for more.

 WHERE IT PINCHES 

 Shaming the shameless is a tough job. The Rajya Sabha member of parliament, Mr Fali Nariman, has decided to take on the job, by proposing that the allowances of MPs be cut during the time the house is adjourned and proceedings disrupted. Mr Nariman has put forth a non-official bill to this effect, although there are doubts whether a private member?s bill has much chance of being passed. That, perhaps, is not the larger point. The proceedings of parliament (disentitlement of allowances) bill, 2004 expresses the frustration many legislators are feeling about the continued disruption of parliament by the opposition ever since the United Progressive Alliance came to power in New Delhi. It is a sign of the times that the bill could not be tabled because parliament was adjourned one week before schedule. The acrimonious conflict between the government and opposition had made it impossible for any business to be conducted.

 ?No work, no pay? is an excellent principle, especially where the elected representatives of the people deliberately waste public money without conducting the public business they have been entrusted with. But it has to be said that disruption of parliament is not new in India, it has happened repeatedly over different issues and has brought forth the same kind of protest and exasperated computations of the sums of public money wasted each hour. In spite of sporadic suspensions, no effective mechanism has been put in place to prevent such disruption. It is rather disgraceful that the need to discipline MPs should be so urgently felt, but there is no doubt that something should be done. Mr Nariman?s bill is meant to pinch. If passed, it would not only cure the Bharatiya Janata Party-led opposition of its incorrigible daily tantrums, but it would also ensure comparatively uninterrupted, civilized functioning of the parliament in future.

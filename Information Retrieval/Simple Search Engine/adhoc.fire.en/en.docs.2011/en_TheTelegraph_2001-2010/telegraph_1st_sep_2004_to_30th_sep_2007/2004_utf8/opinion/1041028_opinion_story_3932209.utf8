 I DON?T THINK I SAID THAT

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 They call it ?misstatement?. The president of the United States does not lie when he says, as he did during his last debate with his challenger, ?I just don?t think I ever said I?m not worried about Osama bin Laden. It?s kind of one of those exaggerations,? and other such whoppers. According to the American media, they are just ?misstatements?.

 Of course it is not easy to call the most powerful man in the world a barefaced liar, not when the chances of his returning to power are 50:50. (Though that hasn?t stopped the right-wing media, especially Rupert Murdoch?s tabloid, New York Post, and his Fox News Channel, from using far cruder language to hold John Kerry accountable for stating, ?This is a president who hasn?t met with the Black Congressional Caucus,? and other such misdemeanours.)

 Whatever the euphemism, the point is that verifying the claims and counterclaims made by both the presidential contenders in their debates, stump speeches and advertisements, or ?fact-checking,? is a big thing in the American media today. Did Kerry actually vote 98 times to raise taxes as Bush says?

 Has the job loss under Bush been as depressing as Kerry paints it? Is Bush right when he says Kerry?s health plan will leave patients at the mercy of bureaucrats? (Answers: not really, not wholly, no.) May be the journalists are trying to make amends for their unquestioning acceptance of the Bush administration?s claims about Iraq?s WMDs. May be it is competition from websites like FactCheck.org, campaigndesk.org and sundry blogs that have spurred them on. The websites are certainly faster at this game than they are. But the press is still playing it safe. Carefully evenhanded, it has not spelt out who is the more egregious of the two. That could be too big a risk, even if they are just misstatements.

 Doing theatre

 America is the birthplace of the television talk-shows that we have now become familiar with in India ? two or four persons, evenly divided to represent two sides of the issue, slug it out in front of the camera, egged on by the anchor (this breed can hardly be called the moderator), to present us with a programme full of sound and fury signifying nothing. But that?s television for you, we are told, that?s entertainment.

 Well, not for everyone. Not for Jon Stewart, who has set the American media on its ears by appearing on one such show last week and lambasting the anchors (there are two) for ?doing theatre when you should be doing debate?. They were ?hurting America? by their ?partisan hackery,? Stewart told the show?s aghast hosts, describing himself as ?someone who watches your show and cannot take it anymore?.

 The cheering began with the audience in the studio of the show he tore to pieces. Of course, whatever Jon Stewart, host of the hugely popular Daily Show, a self-professedly ?fake news? comedy show, says, America does not take lightly. Stewart is quite a cult figure, especially among the coveted demographic section in all media worldwide: the youth. Even then, the sort of reaction his comments have evoked, amidst this all-consuming presidential election, only signifies that Stewart has touched a chord that goes well beyond him. Let us hope it won?t stop at talk alone. Only then can things change in India too.

 Comedy festival

 There is no reason for Arabs to have anything to laugh about in Bush?s America. Yet, this month saw a three-day Arab-American Comedy Festival in New York, that was as funny as it was sad. Take Aron Kader on the American media?s portrayal of events in Palestine. It was, he said, summed up by a headline that could easily have appeared in any of the papers here: ?Palestinians Attack Bullet With Body.?

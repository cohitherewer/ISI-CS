 FAILING MASTER

 - The unmaking of essences

 Is the light dying?

MAGIC SEEDS

By V.S. Naipaul, Picador, Rs 495

The word that would perhaps best describe Willie Chandran, 

the hero of Naipaul?s earlier novel, Half a Life, is ?drifter?. A character 

in Magic Seeds describes her former lover as a ?drifter?: ?she made it 

sound almost technical, almost an occupation that might be entered in social security 

or other government forms. Occupation: Drifter.? The point, of course, is that 

a drifter has nothing to occupy him, and this lack, when afflicting a novel?s 

hero, could be mirrored in its apparent lack of focus, in the failure of its segmented 

narratives to add up to something that might be admitted under a recognized generic 

label. Chandran is once more the central figure in Naipaul?s new novel, ?central? 

in the sense of being the reluctant picaro whose failure to belong provides the 

episodes with an uneasy narrative logic.

 Chandran, who had left India to spend half a life in England and Africa, is egged on by his sister living in West Berlin to join the Maoist guerrillas in India. He spends seven years with them, and ends up in prison. The setting and the time are imprecise, but this could work well with readers not too bothered with the details of the history of Maoism in India. Chandran meets a wide range of people drawn to the movement, educated urban sympathizers with fragile loyalties, untouchables and peasants with their cricket-like physiques, their mute hatred and their animal terror, small-town aspirants crippled by useless education and piling debts. He begins to acquire a sense of the revolutionary?s life from the inside, appreciates the exigencies of a cruel struggle and the need for comradeship, accepts the inevitable measure of criminality. But he comes to feel that this too is a form of non-belonging ? this willing suspension of everyday sociability and decency, the smouldering hatred beneath the rhetoric of justice and austerity.

 The Indian segment of the novel has every predictable moment of the Naipaul nightmare: Muslim invaders destroying all promises of indigenous civilization, the shame aroused by shabby airports, rancid smells, unhygienic food, tasteless clothes, bad plumbing, and functional sex, the sense of an entire people denied every human grace. India was never quite what Naipaul had made it out to be, although we loved the young Naipaul for wearing his hurt and disgust on his sleeve. The best of writers will age, and even if India changes, Naipaul won?t. 

 However, Naipaul tries to place his pet peeves in a larger context, and Chandran moves to London after his release from the Indian prison. He finds that London is no longer the city he remembered. There has been a great churning in the world and the streets are full of the debris of failed civilizations he had left behind ? south Asians, blacks, Arabs. The enigma of this second arrival has a rather quick and baffling resolution. Through the lives of Chandran?s English hosts, we are given a glimpse of a society fast losing its ?integral? character. Former council-house tenants, now mostly owners, behave as depressingly as ever, with social benefits to support their new taste for fast cars and fancy weddings. Decayed aristocrats get involved in property scams, respectable middle-class professionals scrounge around for sex among the vestiges of the fast-dwindling ?servant class?, and white women copulate shamelessly with blacks and Pakistanis determined to people Britain with dichromic Calibans. This is how the new Sir Vidia speaks, and admirers will scarcely be consoled that the novel will on occasions remind them of the way the old Naipaul used to write.

 Magic Seeds is a more ambitious novel than Half a Life, especially in its effort to gather in its uneven narrative folds one of the most persistent of Naipaul?s themes: the unmaking of essences. ?It is wrong to have an ideal view of the world,? Willie tells himself at the end of the novel. ?That?s where the mischief starts.? In order to undermine every ideal view, Naipaul needed a narrator with an unsettled self, at home everywhere and never at home anywhere. Traveller, migrant, sexual adventurer, spiritual seeker, writer, revolutionary, murderer, and would-be missionary ? Chandran, we can easily see, should serve as the accomplished rhetor for this narrative of non-happening. The drifter?s career of impressive failures is linked by his desire not to choose, to retreat from events, to regard commitment as an intellectual escape, and to keep his thought oddly distanced from what he says and does. 

 There is one activity that Chandran comes to like: he takes a course in architecture as training for the job he finds with a London magazine. He is drawn to its blend of inspiration and technology, its dispassion, its suspicion of a reducible message. Chandran feels he has come to this supreme form of art too late, one cannot unmake one?s life at fifty. It is tempting to read into this attraction the wistfulness of an ageing craftsman, who is starting to find the all-too-hard material of the present resist his masterly hand.

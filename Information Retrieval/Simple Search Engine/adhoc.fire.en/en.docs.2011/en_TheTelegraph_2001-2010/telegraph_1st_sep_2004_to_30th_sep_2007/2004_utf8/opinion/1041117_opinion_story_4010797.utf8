 SMILE IN PLACE

 In India, the ruling party?s agenda often becomes the government?s business. The distinction between partisan and administrative priorities gets even more blurred if elections are round the corner. It is easy to understand, therefore, why Jharkhand?s chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, made the state?s fourth foundation day celebrations look like a political campaign. In a few months? time, he has to lead a rather disjointed coalition in Jharkhand?s second assembly polls. The fall of the Bharatiya Janata Party from power at the Centre will prove to be a major handicap for him. The bickerings within the state unit of the BJP have also not helped matters for the National Democratic Alliance. But the biggest challenge for Mr Munda may come from a resurgent Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, a partner in the United Progressive Alliance now ruling in New Delhi. No prizes for guessing why Mr Munda decided to mark the foundation day by distributing land ownership documents to some 34,000 farmers and by handing over the management of the mid-day meal scheme to women?s self-help groups.

 The chief minister was happy to ?see the smile on the farmers? faces? at the foundation day ceremony. Obviously, he would like all this largesse to help him smile when the time comes for the polls. The problem is that far too many sections of the state?s people have little to cheer about. Large parts of Jharkhand have been hit by a severe drought, causing thousands of people to starve. Mr Munda?s announcements had a bitter counterpoint in a non-governmental organization?s decision to take out a ?funeral procession? on that day to protest the administration?s failure to tackle hunger and starvation in the villages. And, the killing of a schoolteacher by the Naxalites a day earlier brought to life once more the terror that stalks the state. Good governance, rather than poll gifts, is what Jharkhand needs. But then, politicians have their own ideas of serving the people.

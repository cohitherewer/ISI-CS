 Paperback Pickings

 I could have been elsewhere

 My nine lives (John Murray, Rs 395) 

by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala begins with the intriguing sentence, These chapters 

are potentially autobiographical: even when something didnt actually happen to 

me, it might have done so. Each of these nine lives explores an avenue of possibility, 

mixing fantasy and actuality, re-inventing origins, destinies, accidents and complications 

which always work themselves out in the same way. Born in Germany of Polish parents, 

and having lived in England since the age of twelve to marry an Indian architect, 

Jhabvala soon felt at home wherever I happened to be, at the same time I held 

back, almost deliberately, from being truly assimilated. This is an interesting 

experiment with fiction and memoir-writing, conducted with a sort of lucid and 

candid impulsiveness and eccentricity, combining an Anglo-Saxon literary sensibility, 

a Central European background and an Indian sense of lifes muddles. The opening 

Apologia has a grammatical error: I may not have outgrown the common childish 

fantasy that ones real parents are someone different, somewhere else.

The cardamom club (Penguin, Rs 250) 

by Jon Stock invokes Norman Tebbits infamous 1990 Cricket Test, followed 

by a Trollope quote, One is patriotic only because one is too small and weak 

to be cosmopolitan. Raj Nair, ambitious and patriotic, is posted to Delhi with 

his first MI6 job. His cover is of a resident doctor at the British High Commission. 

Then his father is arrested in Britain on spying charges, and Raj realizes that 

he is up against a secret, colonial organization working at the very heart of 

Whitehall, The Cardamom Club. But I needed a break from Britain, too, some anonymity. 

And in this bland no-mans land out here on National Highway 8, near the Indira 

Gandhi International airport, I could listen to a Filipino band singing the Beatles 

and imagine, just for a moment, that I was nowhere.

Promising picture or broken future? (Asian 

Centre for Human Rights, Rs 350) offers a critique of and recommendations 

on the government of Indias draft National Policy on Tribals. According to this 

commentary, the draft policy is seriously flawed and continues to employ archaic 

characteristics to identify indigenous and tribal peoples, and fails to incorporate 

the lessons learnt from the evaluations of the existing policies and programmes 

and laws since the president of India issued the first notification to recognize 

the Scheduled Tribes in 1950.

Sarpa Satra (Pras, Rs 150) by Arun 

Kolatkar is an elegant volume, designed by the poet himself, that contains 

a single long poem in English. Kolatkar, who writes in both English and Marathi, 

takes up the sarpa satra sacrifice in the Mahabharata, performed 

by Janamejaya in order to annihilate the Nagas or the Snake People. But Kolatkars 

story is told from the point of view of the Nagas. Kolatkars Jejuri had 

won the Commonwealth Poetry Award.

The diary of a space traveller amp; other stories(Puffin, 

Rs 250) by Satyajit Ray collects twelve stories featuring the eccentric 

genius and scientist, Professor Trilokeshwar Shonku. They originally appeared 

in the revived Sandesh and in Anandamela throughout the Sixties 

and the early Seventies. All the stories are translated by Gopa Majumdar (who 

has also translated Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay and Ashapurna Debi), except Corvus, 

which had been translated by Ray himself.

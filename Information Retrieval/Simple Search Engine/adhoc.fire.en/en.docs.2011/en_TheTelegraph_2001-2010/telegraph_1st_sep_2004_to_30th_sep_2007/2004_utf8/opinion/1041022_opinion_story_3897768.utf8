 JOURNALS SPELL SUCCESS

 Big business

Science, technology, medicine (STM) journals are very big business. In fact, in the allocation of funds in the central universities? libraries and research institutions, over 50 per cent of the budget is for journals and the rest for books and software packages, hardware like photocopiers and computers, and soiled stock replacement. 

 There are over 2,000 STM publishers, together publishing 1.2 million articles a year in about 16,000 periodical journals. University libraries must purchase the leading journals, whatever their price, and often at the expense of less-exalted works. But everyone is not satisfied. Academics, universities and the government providing funds are worried that publishers are getting away with murder. As librarians and other end-users like researchers and graduate students see it, the problem is one of monopoly. No library has the funds to subscribe to every journal that comes along, and they stick to key journals that capture the lion?s share of important articles because researchers want their papers to be published in such prestigious journals. 

 But prestigious journals cost money and are not easily accessible. Rapidly increasing subscription rates have compelled libraries to cut back on the number subscribed. Library committees, that decide what comes in and what goes out, consist of department heads and the chief librarian. These heads use their clout and opt for journals instead of books. 

 There is no indication that subscription rates for STM would stabilize in the near future. Elsevier, a British-Dutch MNC and the world?s largest STM publisher, had post-tax profits of 17 per cent in 2003. Decent as it appears to be, Elsevier claims this is just enough to ensure sustainability given the number of research papers that are included in its journals. 

 STM journals have always turned in a decent profit. And they do it in four ways. First, a great deal of the composing of scientific-mathematical matter is done in India at one-tenth the cost of that in Europe. The quality of composition is error-free and the internet ensures that time and distance are no hindrances.

 Second, since subscriptions are paid for in advance, there are no cash flow problems that are endemic to book publishers. Third, there are no price restrictions. Elsevier and others could price their journals ten times the unit cost and get away because of the quality of research published. And lastly, many young researchers pay to be published because this is the quickest way to be noticed. 

 What is the way out? First, much needn?t be made of photocopying key articles. Contrary to what is believed, this is no violation of intellectual property rights as long as it is not done for commercial purposes. Second, after a limited period of monopoly, research papers should be freely available on-line. 

 With the way things are going, it is clear that the days of huge profits are over with open access that is bound to come, sooner than later.

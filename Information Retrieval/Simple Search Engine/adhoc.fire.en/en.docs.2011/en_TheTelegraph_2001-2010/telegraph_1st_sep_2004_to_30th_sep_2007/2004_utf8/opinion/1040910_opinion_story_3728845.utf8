 Letters to Editor

 Don?t play with numbers

 Sir ? The Hindu right has a penchant for politicizing even the apolitical. Witness the furore over the census findings on the religious composition of the country (?Census shows growth shift?, Sep 7). The sangh parivar has already started hooting about an imminent ?Muslim takeover?, and blamed ?growth shift? on ?Bangladeshi infiltration?. However, the fact that these findings are intended to help correct social imbalances and not settle political scores seems to have eluded the hawks. Why is there no attempt to set straight the skewed female sex ratio in all religious communities instead? Or to increase literacy, a sure way of arresting population growth among the minority community. With India all set to become the most populous nation, the saffron brigade would be better off fighting the population problem instead of communalizing the issue.

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil Sen, Calcutta

 A shaky start

 Sir ? Hundred days of Manmohan Singh has not been able to fulfil the aspirations of the people. Inflation is at an all-time high of 8 per cent. There has been a hike in gas and petrol prices, while stock prices have come down. The interest rates on provident fund have been slashed and the State Bank of India has increased the price of its fixed-rate housing loans. All these factors indicate that the United Progressive Alliance has not had a promising start. Moreover, its alliance with Muslim organizations ? the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen and the All India Muslim League ? and the induction of tainted ministers like Laloo Prasad Yadav show that the present government has reneged on its promise of providing secular and clean governance. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? In his first hundred days in power, Manmohan Singh has shown that he is a prime minister with a difference. Singh has stressed on a code of conduct for politicians ? something which very few leaders talk about. Perhaps he is well aware of the history of corruption in the Congress rank and file. The Tehelka, coffin, stamp paper and other scandals have shown how all-pervasive this malaise is. Corruption among politicians, judges, officials and businessmen has ruined our economy and tarnished the country?s image. India?s welfare lies in punishing the corrupt and recovering their ill-gotten gains. This requires the greatest of political and judicial wills. Perhaps Singh should start by removing the tainted ministers and ordering the judiciary to expedite corruption cases.

 Yours faithfully,

B. S. Ganesh, Bangalore

 Sir ? The world seems to be full of contradictions. We have a prime minister who publicly announces that corrupt elements have no place in politics, but does not follow this policy in principle (look at the composition of his ministry). Singh had also mentioned that Mani Shankar Aiyar?s views on Veer Savarkar were his own. But he did not explain whether Aiyar had the right to remove Savarkar?s plaque. Even 56 years after independence, people are arrested for hoisting the tricolour on Indian soil. While intellectuals sermonized the National Democratic Alliance on how to behave in parliament, they kept mum when the Congress boycotted parliament over the George Fernandes issue. 

 The media and the Congress once lambasted N. Chandrababu Naidu for his agricultural policies which apparently drove farmers to commit suicide. But the suicides continue even under the new Congress government. Inflation is on the rise, labour has taken to strikes and agitation and one corner of the country (Manipur) is burning. Yet, after hundred days, the media think the UPA?s performance is satisfactory. This only adds to the confusion of R.K. Laxman?s ?common man?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak Chikhale, Guwahati

 Sir ? For the majority of Indians, Sonia Gandhi and not Manmohan Singh, is the prime minister of the nation. Congress chief ministers rush to Sonia for her approval before taking a decision, be it on the river dispute, transfer of governors, reservation of jobs or the arrest of Uma Bharti. Singh has a small support base. Neither has he won an election. The bottomline is that Singh is not his own master. He is only an interim arrangement till Rahul Gandhi comes of age. 

 In the last hundred days, Singh?s sole achievement has been his curt dismissal of the NDA delegation. Had Atal Bihari Vajpayee done the same to Sonia Gandhi, the media would have asked for his head. Why this double standard? If one were to ask the man on the street for his opinion, he would probably say that Vajpayee is a world class statesman, while Singh is just a good economist. 

 Yours faithfully,

Neela Sengupta, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? During its hundred days in office, the government has had to battle several crises ? Shibu Soren, natural disasters, violence in Kashmir, the hostage crises in Iraq, spiralling inflation, the truckers? strike, the passage of the finance bill and so on. However, one cannot always assume that a government will make its mark from the beginning. Manmohan Singh?s real test lies in weathering more severe storms in the future.

 Yours faithfully,

Bibhabari Rath, Cuttack

 BACK TO FALLUJA

 It is impossible to know what is going on in Falluja now. The ?embedded? reports are precisely that. There is very little apart from what the American military authorities choose to let the world know. The city is too dangerous for independent journalists, and there is practically no contact with the civilians who have not managed to flee. But it has been estimated that there are still tens of thousands of them in there. This is the second time that American forces are staging the Seige of Falluja, this time with additional Iraqi forces. The city is supposed to be a rebel stronghold, harbouring Saddam Hussein loyalists and the Arab militant network headed by an alleged al Qaida ally. Lieutenant General John Sattler has rallied his troops with a speech that describes this as ?America?s fight? to ?liberate? Falluja from being ?held hostage by mugs, thugs, murderers and terrorists?. The marine commander?s words seem to imply that these categories are distinct from the civilians who have not been able to flee the city. Yet, the total number of civilian deaths in Iraq so far is an estimated 100,000. This is not surprising. The commander of the US Regimental Combat Team 1 believes in letting civilians know that coalition forces are in their city by a heightened display of force: ?That?s one of the reasons why we have such a large show of force, so people realize they should really evacuate.? Those who do realize, but still cannot flee ? the most vulnerable and the physically incapacitated ? are then assumed to be ?potential insurgents?, and all remaining cars are treated as possible suicide bombs. The state of emergency declared in the city would make such identifications perfectly legal.

 Baghdad, Samarra, Nassiriya were all besieged with equal fanfare. But within days, the militants were back and in greater numbers. This is not a fairy-tale war that progresses from city to city, flushing out the ?enemy?, towards an eventual ?peace?, followed by elections and then democracy, the happiest of endings. The real end is still nowhere in sight.

 WATCH THEM PERFORM

This Above All / Khushwant Singh

 Caged in

 The best time to watch antics of politicians on the make are elections: before names of candidates are announced by the parties, during the campaign and after results are announced. To start with, aspirants swear by their undying loyalty to the party. If he or she does not get the ticket, he or she will go into a sulk, do his or her best to get the party nominee defeated, or join another one. If the party nominee wins, in all probability, he or she will return to it. The following couplet by T N. Raz of Panchkula sums it up neatly:

Party todeeyey, phir jodeeyay, phir todeeye

Rang lay hee aayegee mauka-parastee ek din

 (?Break up the party, reassemble it, break it up again?, I say

 I am sure your opportunism will bear fruit one day)

 Go down the length and breadth of the country and you will find party hoppers in every state of the Union who have made it big: Amarinder Singh, Bhajan Lal, Bansi Lal, Kalyan Singh, Ajit Singh ? I could go on and on with my list but will end with Sharad Pawar, the role-model for aaya Rams-gaya Rams. 

 The reason behind the success of party-hoppers is that the two major political parties of the country, the Congress and the BJP, have a lot in common. So changing loyalties when the situation is favourable does not lead to much soul-searching or bad conscience. The one exception are the communists. Though split into two, they have definite commitments to their ideals which leave less scope for bargaining. 

 To the best of my recollections, the only two card-holding communists who switched over to the Congress when the opportune moment came were Mohan Kumarmangalam, to become a minister in the central cabinet, and Rajni Patel, to become head of the Congress in Maharashtra.

 Ear to the ground

 I am not quite deaf but getting harder of hearing by the day. Friends are too polite to draw my attention to my growing infirmity, but members of my family are more outspoken. My wife, who has been dead over three years, never spared me when I asked her to repeat what she had said with a question ?hain?? She would snap back and exclaim; ?Dora! Why don?t you have your ears examined?? Now everytime a stranger calls on me, my son, if he is around, tells him or her: ?Speak a little loudly?. 

 There are pros and cons about hearing aids. I had a Canadian friend, a well-known art critic who had one connected to a battery tucked into his front pocket. I asked him if it wasn?t a nuisance. ?No,? he replied firmly. I have it switched on when I am out on the road so that I can hear cars hoot to get out of their way. I also have it on when attending musical concerts. Its only in parties when people begin to bore me that I switch it off and switch on a smile on my face to appear as if I am all ears.?

 Two of my friends have acquired hearing aids. Prem Kirpal, now 96, got one from Paris at the enormous price of Rs 1.5 lakhs. He hardly ever uses it. When I asked him why, he replies na?vely: ?The battery will run out and I?ll have to get another one from Paris.? Bharat Ram, who is the same age as myself, also uses a hearing aid but has to cup his ears to catch what anyone is saying. 

 The artist Satish Gujaral lost his hearing as a child: he was able to teach himself to speak in English without being able to hear what he was saying. Then he found a living hearing-aid in his comely wife, Kiran, who has taught him to read her lips and hand gestures. He gets over his handicap by doing most of the talking and reducing what he has to hear to the minimum. Some years ago, he went to Australia for ear surgery which would restore his hearing to normal. For some months he kept up the pretence that he could hear sounds he hadn?t heard before. Actually the surgery did nothing for him. 

 I am not yet a gone case. I can hear people sitting close to me without much difficulty. I have problems hearing people who speak too softly, go on at the speed of machine-gun fire or go on interminably mimi, mimi, mimi. Then I assume the mien of the smiling Buddha and occasionally grunt to indicate I am following what is being said. My only fear is that the person might ask me a question. I answer it with a benign smile. I also have problem answering telephone calls. 

So far I have got away with it. I still enjoy classical 

music on my satellite radio, follow news and comments on TV channels. If I am 

hard of hearing, its other peoples? problem, not mine. But use hearing aid to 

help them out? No. I often wonder if deaf people are cremated or buried with ear-plugs 

and batteries or sent to the other world as deaf, as they were on the day they 

died!

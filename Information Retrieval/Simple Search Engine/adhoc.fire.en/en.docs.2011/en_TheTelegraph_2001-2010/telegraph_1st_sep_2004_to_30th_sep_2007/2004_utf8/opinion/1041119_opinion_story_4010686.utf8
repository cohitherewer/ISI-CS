 AN AUTHOR?S GUIDE

 What sells?

 Every author likes to think that his book will reach out to the masses. In reality, it is the core appeal of a book on which its sales potential will be judged. A little honesty on the author?s part will save him time and the disappointment that comes with repeated rejection slips. 

 It is important that the author asks himself what his book is trying to achieve and what its market is. Are there enough people willing to buy the book at a price of, say, Rs 100 or so? It would be a mistake to churn out 100,000 words in the expectation that a publisher would be unable to resist such obvious effort and dedication.

 Take a look at the ground situation. Too many weighty manuscripts are sent to publishers who have neither the energy nor the time to wade through reams of what might turn out to be the blockbuster of the century but will more probably not become one. It is best that the author clears the proposal with the publisher before striking out on his own. Besides, since the publisher now solicits almost 90 per cent of manuscripts by commissioning authors instead of waiting for them to turn up, it will ensure that the typescript is carefully examined when it is finally submitted for publication. 

 The first step for an author would be to make a synopsis and a sample chapter. It is possible for a bad book to follow a good synopsis, but it is a rare case for a good book to follow a poor synopsis. An experienced publisher knows this, almost instinctively, better than anyone else. 

 The synopsis should begin with a clear justification as to why the author thinks the book will sell. The marketing department looks for a book?s unique selling points, or the lack of them. As an example, there should be some memorable catch-phrases in the synopsis ? ?The first authorized biography of a Dalit leader based on hitherto unpublished letters and diaries.?

 It isn?t enough to claim that the book will attract the general readers. Marketing boys want the author to be specific ? exactly who the general readers are, where they are concentrated and whether they would pay the price for the book. 

 There are other details that deserve attention. What is the intended size of the book, that is, the approximate number of words? This has an important bearing on production costs and therefore the price. It is best to stick to the 100,000-125,000 word limit, which would make a finished book of approximately 250 pages in the usual format for adult readers. Anything more would deter publishers because it only means more investment. Besides, most readers are pressed for time and don?t want bigger books. 

 Then again, will there be illustrations? If so, will they be black and white or colour? And who will acquire and pay for them ? the author or the publisher? 

 Finally, in what form will the typescript be submitted ? in the traditional typed copy or in a floppy? Publishers prefer the latter because it saves the costs of composing and proof-reading and therefore cuts the time taken for producing the book.

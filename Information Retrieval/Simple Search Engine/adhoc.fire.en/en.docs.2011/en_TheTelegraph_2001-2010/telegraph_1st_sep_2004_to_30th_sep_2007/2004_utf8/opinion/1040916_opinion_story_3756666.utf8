 Letters to Editor

 Man, I feel like a woman!

 Sir ? This is with reference to Manmohan Singh being called ?Shikhandi? by Yashwant Sinha, for his ostensible lack of control over the government. One expected at least the women?s organizations to react to this sexist remark privileging ?masculinity? as the repository of power. It reminds one of the days when Indira Gandhi was called ?the only man in her cabinet?. What makes the current remark in particularly bad taste is that it comes at a time India is slowly recognizing the humanness of transgendered people. The continued use of hijra/ shikhandi/chhakka as derogatory terms in public life will make their struggle that much more difficult. Shabnam Mausi might hold out some hope for these beleaguered people, but how long will India wait, for instance, to have a hijra prime minister? One only wishes Manmohan Singh had the ovaries to tell Sinha, ?Man, I feel like a woman!?

 Yours faithfully,

Rakhi C., Durgapur

 Disposable income

 Sir ? In ?More on rural Bengal? (Sept 8), Omkar Goswami tries to show a mismatch between the recent high growth of per-capita GDP in West Bengal and the consumption standards in its villages. Unfortunately, he fails to locate the reason for the mismatch since he does not look into where the increase in GDP is coming from. According to the Statistical Abstract, West Bengal 2001-02, there has been an increase of about Rs 30,000 crore ? or 62.5 per cent ? in the state domestic product at constant prices between 1993 and 2000. In per capita terms too, the growth was a high 44.7 per cent. But this increment came largely from the non-agriculture sector. Agriculture ? livestock, tea plantation, floriculture, orchard, vegetable, fishery and forestry ? contributed a mere 12.6 per cent, or Rs 3,800 crore, to this increase. Of course, unregistered manufacturing activity in which the rural participation is quite high, contributed Rs 2,300 crore (about 8 per cent) to the increase. In contrast, the banking and insurance sector added Rs 7,500 crore (25 per cent); real estate and business services, 8 per cent; trade, hotel and restaurants, 16 per cent; communications, 3 per cent; construction 4 per cent; public administration, 7 per cent; registered manufacturing 6 per cent ? all activities dominated by urbanites. Thus rural people?s share not being commensurate with their numbers (72 per cent of the state?s population) it is not surprising that their standard of living has not improved even after the upsurge in agricultural production in the Eighties.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Datta Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? If Omkar Goswami plumbs census data to show a contradiction between West Bengal?s ?proclaimed? growth versus its relative lack of rural prosperity, in another survey conducted by a popular news weekly too, the state appears in very poor light. The objective of the latter study is to capture the quality of life-at-work and life-after-work across the country. The 30 states have been classified into 20 big and 10 small. West Bengal falls in the big category. 

 Evaluation has been made on eight critical parameters that shape business environment and quality of life. West Bengal?s rank ? parameter-wise ? is as follows: Agriculture, 8; consumer market, 13; law and order, 14; health, 11; education, 13; infrastructure, 14; investment scenario, 18; budget and prosperity, 14. On over-all performance, West Bengal occupies 14th rank. So when our MIT-trained finance minister dishes out statistics to extol the SDP growth and a high per capita GDP growth in his next budget speech, we must, Jatayu-like, say, ?Highly suspicious, Felu babu, highly suspicious indeed.? Does Asim Dasgupta really believe that he can fool all the people all the time?

 Yours faithfully,

Debaki Nandan Mandal, Calcutta

 Predictable results

 Sir ? Maharashtra and Arunachal Pradesh are going to the polls next month. But votes will be counted in Arunachal Pradesh much before polls are held in Maharashtra. Thus it is not unlikely that the election results of the northeastern state will be used by the winning party to influence voters in Maharashtra, with the help of a section of the media. And with the former chief minister of Arunachal, Gegong Apang, returning to the Congress, one can lay a safe bet on which party will emerge victorious. In view of all this, the Election Commission had better defer the counting in Arunachal Pradesh to after the elections in Maharashtra, so that voters may cast their ballots unbiased.

 Yours faithfully,

Padatik Roy, Jasidih

 Sir ? The EC, which is preparing to hold elections in Maharastra and other states, must find a way to prevent criminals from entering legislatures using money and muscle-power, who then go on to become ministers. Since parties are interested in the winnability of candidates and not their honesty, the EC must come to the aid of citizens. In addition to the usual affidavits, it should obtain information on candidates from police stations and reject those ineligible. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

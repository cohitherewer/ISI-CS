 Letters to Editor

 Behind all that glitter

 Sir ? Indians have always been known to be obsessed with gold, but the phenomenon seems to have reached unprecedented levels lately. At least, it seems so going by the number of advertisements jewellers have placed in the media and the many hoardings they have put up all over the city. Whether people are actually buying gold or whether it is only the jewellers who are creating a hype in the hope that people will do so is unclear. But what is clear is that the gold rush is an indication of the lack of options for small investors today.

 Yours faithfully,

 Ramgopal Guha, Calcutta 

 Air pocket

 Sir ? The Delhi high court?s order quashing the recommendations of the Indian air force?s special promotions board should be deemed a wake-up call by air headquarters (?Cloud on air marshals?, Nov 9). It is often seen that capable officers are filtered out at the level of lieutenant colonel/colonel. Perhaps, they are not very ambitious or it is their outspokenness that has curtailed their rise. It seems that the armed forces are in need of officers who will order their men to engage heavily-armed enemy soldiers with their bare hands, even as the demand for modern arms is gathering dust. In the coming years, war is going to be technology-driven ? all the more reason why yes-men should not be at the helm of affairs. The armed services must re-frame its promotion policies to bring in a sense of justice, equity and belonging. The present case also underlines the need for a promotion policy, an armed forces tribunal as well as an additional grievance redressal mechanism for the army.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? The Centre?s reaction to the Delhi high court order indicting the air force and Union defence secretary is shocking, even though the judges gave detailed instances of bias against the two air vice-marshals bypassed for promotion. The defence minister should have sought clarifications from the indicted persons and for the changes in promotion rules giving increased weight to performance before the promotion-board. The ministry must also make public the arguments of the air chief and the defence secretary to clear rumours about lobbying in the armed forces.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba 

 Sir ? The two air marshals were bypassed for promotion because of the discretionary powers of the promotion board. The same may be the case with promotions in PSUs. The stand of the officers who moved court is appreciable. It is time the defence forces and other government bodies made changes in the their promotion policy, putting emphasis on merit.

 Yours faithfully,

 Only oil

 Sir ? I am a poor woman living in the Park Circus area. I draw a paltry amount of kerosene from the local ration outlet. The owner has stopped giving me kerosene on the plea that I do not draw foodgrains too. I stopped buying foodgrains from the ration shop because their prices are equal to or more than the market rates. I demanded to see the government notice which empowered him to stop my kerosene, but the shopkeeper refused. I suspect an unholy nexus has come up between kerosene and foodgrain ration shops. Since kerosene can be got for cheaper than the market price, ration shop owners are being pressurized to stop giving kerosene to hapless people like us. They are probably diverting our quota to black-marketeers for a commission. I request the state government to step in. Also why not bring in a kerosene-only card? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sahera Bano, Calcutta

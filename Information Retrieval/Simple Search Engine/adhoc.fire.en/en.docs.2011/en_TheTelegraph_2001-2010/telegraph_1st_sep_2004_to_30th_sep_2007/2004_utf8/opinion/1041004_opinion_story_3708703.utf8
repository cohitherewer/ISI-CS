 GREY MAKES VULNERABLE

 Close monitoring by the police is needed to help prevent crimes against the growing numbers of the elderly in India, writes Sankar Sen

 Demographic ageing, a global phenomenon, has reached Indian shores too. Since World Elderly Day has just been celebrated on October 1, it is time to focus on the issues arising out of people living longer and the rising grey population of the country. There are 70 million people above the age of 60 in India today, and this number is going to rise to 177 million by 2025. One of the many problems faced by elderly citizens, particularly in urban areas, is the fear of crime. This year has been particularly unfortunate for the elderly in Delhi. There were 11 cases of gruesome murder of older people, both male and female. The sensational double murder of Lieutenant General (retd) Harnam Singh Seth and his wife created widespread panic in the capital. However, a significant rise in crimes against the elderly has been noticed all over the country. 

 Studies by criminologists in the West show that many older persons are reluctant to go to the police to report crimes against them for fear of reprisals. This makes them especially vulnerable to re-victimization. Research also indicates that the elderly endure far greater fear for their safety than is warranted by their actual victimization rates. 

 Various factors are responsible for the escalation of crime against the elderly. First, loneliness. Many old persons are forced to live alone and hence in the event of any attack or crime against them, do not get help immediately. Second is their dependence. Because of their inability to live on their own, they are forced to employ domestic help without first verifying their antecedents. This makes them vulnerable to attacks by criminals and other species of confidence tricksters. There are a number of cases, particularly in Delhi, of domestic servants involved in crimes against their employers. 

 Further, because of failing health, the elderly can be easily overpowered. Age magnifies the likelihood of victimization. Many of the elderly try to solve the problem by reducing exposure to potentially threatening situations. Because of crimes or the fear of crime, they do not venture out and develop a fortress mentality.

 The elderly find the consequences of crime far more devastating than younger people, who have more years to overcome physical, mental and financial shocks. Broken limbs, as a result of encounters with criminals, or the loss of savings to a conman may diminish an older person?s quality of life and make some of them live their last years in fear and distress. Elderly persons also remain susceptible to financial frauds. The FBI, in the United States of America, revealed a deliberate targeting of older persons by tricksters. Many of them have insurance, pensions, proceeds from the sale of a house, and other savings that make them attractive targets for criminals. 

 Many older people think that they are safe from crimes when they are in their house. But criminals use the telephone to trick people out of their savings. Telemarketing fraud is believed to cost Americans $40 billion a year and older people form a disproportionately large section of the targeted group. It is necessary to take senior citizens? fear of crime more seriously and find imaginative ways to improve their quality of life. It is aptly said that a society is judged by how well it protects its children and the elderly. The neglect of elderly persons? concerns, including their fear of crime, contributes to their belief that they are seen as being disposable and obsolete. The fear of crime, visible in the eyes of the elderly today, serves as a mirror of our future.

 Elderly persons should necessarily follow a few security measures like going out in a group, keeping a dog as a pet, keeping vital telephone numbers handy, informing the police and neighbours if they are suspicious of someone, and insisting on getting their domestic servants verified by the local police. They should also try not to be a recluse, make an ostentatious display of cash and jewellery, trust strangers or open doors to unidentified persons, and ignore any suspicious incident.

 Sometimes law enforcement officers who contact the senior citizens are young and have little experience of working with the elderly. In the US, some police departments have created special positions called the law-enforcement gerontologists. They deal with the crime and abuse-related problems of the elderly and explore opportunities for the latter to contribute to crime-prevention programmes. By developing a rapport with the elderly, the officers identify their problems and then recommend ways to minimize the risk. They also alert the senior citizens about crimes being committed against the elderly.

 In Japan, the elderly have been singled out for special outreach by the police. Police officers regularly telephone older citizens who live alone to check on their well-being. They observe ?silver days? when policemen drop in at the homes of the elderly. Particular efforts are also being made by the Japanese police force to draw them into crime-prevention organizations. 

 Some of the initiatives by the police in India too deserve mention. The Mumbai police, with the help of non-governmental organizations like Dignity Foundation and Agni, have embarked upon programmes to prevent crimes against senior citizens. Under these programmes, officers visit the houses of senior citizens staying in the areas under their jurisdiction on a regular basis. There is also an Alert Citizen Watch scheme launched by Mumbai police, encouraging the people to report crimes against senior citizens and the dangers of any crimes they might be exposed to.

 Delhi police have also embarked upon innovative programmes to create a sense of security among senior citizens. Under this scheme, schoolchildren are motivated to visit senior citizens on weekends to share their problems. The results so far have been encouraging. However, Delhi police?s Servants Verification Scheme is going through a rough patch ? the attempts to get information from other states on servants working in middle-class localities in Delhi have drawn a blank. Residents are also reluctant to get their domestic help verified as they feel that the latter would feel insulted and leave. 

 Perhaps community-policing, with an emphasis on face-to-face contact, may give the elderly their only access to help. For it is evident that the elderly need police protection to savour the golden years of their lives.

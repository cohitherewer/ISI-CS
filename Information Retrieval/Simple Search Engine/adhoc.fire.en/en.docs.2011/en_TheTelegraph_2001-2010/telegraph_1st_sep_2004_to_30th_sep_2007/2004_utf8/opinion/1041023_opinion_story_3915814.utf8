 Out and About

 Mira Nair isn?t one to forget her old ties. The filmmaker?s latest project, The Namesake, might be getting all the hype because she signed on our very own Konkona Sen Sharma, but there?s more to it than that. Nair is casting Badal Sircar, her one-time guru, in a cameo in the film. Not just that, she came to meet him in Calcutta on her last trip here, and told us later that she knew him from her early years in the city, worked as his assistant and learnt a lot from him. Meanwhile, Irrfan Khan and Abhishek Bachchan have joined the cast. So now you have three more reasons to wait for the film.

 Pamela Anderson

 Amazon.com describes Pamela Baywatch Anderson?s Star as a ?funny, sexy and compelling? book. It must have been all those things, because it?s No. 8 on the New York Times? bestseller list now, with the actress (ahem!) so enthused she wants to thrust a sequel on us. The Playboy model also claims that the novel, which has caught on owing to its graphic content about everything from a gangrape to limousine sex, is autobiographical, adding she had to tone it down because her co-author, Eric Shaw Quinn, couldn?t handle the sex even when she said it was real. Pam?s thrilled she can officially call herself a bestselling author. You were always a bestseller Ms Anderson, it was just your other ?skills? that sold. Even now, we?re not sure it?s the book... 

 Sam Mendes

 From beauty to the beast. Oscar-winning 

 director Sam Mendes (of American Beauty) straddles the entire 

 gamut of possible subjects. He?s now been roped in by Dreamworks 

 Pictures to mastermind a Broadway revival of the story of 

 everyone?s favourite monster, Shrek. But the talented Mendes 

 will be taking his time about it. The show doesn?t go on 

 the boards till January 2006.

 SOME BIRTHDAYS ARE NOT SO HAPPY

 The contrasting plights of the BJP in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh explain the differences in the birthday celebrations of the two states, says Nalin Verma

 The two neighbouring states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have many things in common. Both were created within 15 days of each other in the same month ? November ? four years ago. Both are governed by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Both have strikingly similar topography, demography and landscape. Rich in mineral resources, both states are endowed with much natural beauty.

 But there was a striking contrast in the way the two states celebrated their birthdays. The former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, landed in Raipur on November 1 to inaugurate the week-long celebrations to mark the creation of Chhattisgarh. The party president, L.K. Advani, came from New Delhi on November 7 to mark the end of the celebrations which included performances by renowned exponents of Indian popular and folk traditions like Teejan Bai, Ravindra Jain and Anuradha Paudwal. Lakhs of people gathered at the Science College grounds to see Vajpayee inaugurate the proceedings. The entire state bore a festive look with colourful banners and buntings dominating the skyline all around.

 The scene in Jharkhand on November 15, its birthday, was just the opposite. A small group of people, mainly drawn from NGOs and self-help groups, gathered to watch the chief minister, Arjun Munda, play chief guest and host. Munda?s 11 cabinet members were special guests at the function. And the cultural show ? quite ordinary by all accounts ? at the end proved a damp squib because few people turned up to watch. 

 Not that Munda did not invite dignitaries. He tried, in vain, to meet the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and invite him. He also approached Vajpayee and Advani. But no one was available. It seems the vice-president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, had initially agreed to come but backed out at the last moment, leaving Munda to carry on all alone at the sprawling Morhabadi grounds. The anniversary of Jharkhand?s creation, which was the fruit of the sacrifice of hundreds of lives, seemed like a non-event. A visitor would be forgiven for not even noticing that the state was celebrating its birthday, because Ranchi ? the state capital ? had neither banners, nor buntings nor decorations of any sort.

 Munda tried to justify the absence of party heavyweights by saying that he ?wanted the celebration to look like an official function and not an affair of the party?. But few are ready to accept Munda?s logic. How could he explain the fact that even the governor, Ved Marwah, chose to be away in New Delhi on November 15? How could he explain the absence of his predecessor, Babulal Marandi, who had celebrated the state?s first birthday with the then Union home minister, Advani, as chief guest?

 Though Munda, his ministers and his supporters are fighting shy of answering these questions, political observers attribute the difference in the scale of celebrations to the difference in the BJP?s condition in the two states. Jharkhand presents a picture of gloom for the BJP, while Chhattisgarh offers the party hope and prospect.

 In Jharkhand, the BJP managed to win only one of the 12 Lok Sabha seats on offer in the state in the May elections. In contrast, the party won 11 out of the 12 Lok Sabha seats in neighbouring Chhattisgarh. Jharkhand was a boon to the Congress-led alliance, while Chhattisgarh was the same to the BJP, at a time when it lost the crown in Delhi. Again, Raman Singh had replaced the redoubtable Ajit Jogi in Chhattisgarh, establishing the BJP?s hegemony in the assembly elections in December last year.

 Bested in the Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP apprehends a fierce battle with the Congress-led alliance in the assembly elections in February next year. Even optimists in the BJP are fighting shy of predicting the party?s return to power in the polls, for which preparations have already begun. In Chhattisgarh, in contrast, the BJP government of Raman Singh looks set to last for the next four years.

 Besides, the BJP is in turmoil after Uma Bharti gave a body blow to its pride within 15 days of the birthday celebrations in the two states. Jharkhand?s birth anniversary celebrations are also said to have been affected because the BJP?s top leaders were occupied with the crisis arising out of Bharti?s actions.

 There was also a sharp difference in the tenor of the speeches the two chief ministers delivered at the anniversary functions. Raman Singh exuded the confidence; while his counterpart in Jharkhand, whose prospects look uncertain, made populist promises about creating 60,000 jobs for unemployed youth in the state before December. Needless to say, few people believe Munda can fulfil his promise.

 Sure of staying in power for the next four years, Singh enumerated the ?actions? his government had taken for the development of the state. He explained how his government?s Rs 9,368-crore budget for 2004-2005 reflected its social and developmental commitments, how the ?Chhattisgarh Amrit Salt Scheme? had freed tribals from the clutches of middlemen and how the government-sponsored scheme to provide food to the poor at the rate of Rs 5 a meal had been benefitting rickshaw-pullers and daily-wage workers. Raman Singh went on to explain others measures like the waiving of agricultural loans worth Rs 118 crore, the launch of 179 minor irrigation projects and the formation of 91 primary forest committees to ensure an improvement in the lot of farmers and forest-dwellers. A study of the ground reality is needed to ascertain the veracity of Singh?s claims. 

 But what was obvious was that he was not under any pressure to make populist announcements. Earlier, Singh had personally inspected the preparations, met the cultural troupes to inquire about their welfare and done everything to ensure the success of the anniversary celebrations. And he succeeded.

 In contrast, Munda looked a defeated man. He arrived at the celebrations venue in a helicopter at 1. 30 pm, spoke for 35 minutes and disappeared, leaving the artists and dancers drawn from the rural areas of the state to entertain the audience. But the crowd too vanished after Munda and his cabinet colleagues left the dais, so that soon the artists outnumbered the audience in the Morhabadi grounds. 

 The day after the birth anniversary, the leader of the opposition in the Jharkhand legislature, Hussain Ansari, remarked, ?This was the last time Munda and the BJP celebrated the birth anniversary. They will not get the opportunity to celebrate it next year for we will replace them.? The February elections will test Hussain?s claim.

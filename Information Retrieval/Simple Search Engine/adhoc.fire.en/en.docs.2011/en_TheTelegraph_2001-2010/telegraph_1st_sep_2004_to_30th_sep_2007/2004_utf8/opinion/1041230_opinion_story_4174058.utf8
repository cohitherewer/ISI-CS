 HOPE FLOATS WHERE ALL ELSE DROWNS

 The Iraq war is no more important in the global scheme of things than poverty or climate change. Gwynne Dyer presents the big picture of 2004

 Darfur, Sudan: no end to despair

 The world has been on hold this year. Interesting and important things have happened in many countries, and people have scarcely noticed that international politics is becalmed ? but it is. The normal business of the planet has pretty much slowed to a halt and we are all gently drifting downstream together while we wait to see what becomes of the United States of America ? and, as a result, of the rest of the world, for the US is still a key player in almost every game. 

 The war in Iraq is not really very important, because Iraq itself is not all that important in the global scheme of things, any more than Vietnam was a generation ago. What matters is the way this war is shaping America?s relations with the rest of the world, and in that sense, Iraq has the potential to be a far bigger turning point than Vietnam.

 Two popular perceptions of what is happening dominate the world at the moment. One, held mainly by Americans, sees a world beleaguered by such a huge terrorist threat that all the old rules have to be abandoned. The US, they believe, is carrying the main burden of this ?war against terror? while other countries shirk their share of the load. Most people in other countries, and most of their governments, see terrorism as a much smaller threat. Certain measures need to be taken to contain it, but it is nowhere near big enough to justify scrapping all the rules of international behaviour we have painfully built up over the past half-century.

 Most of the other great powers on the planet are beginning to see the US as a rogue superpower. Yet everybody is deeply reluctant to confront the US directly, since that would just hasten the collapse of the multilateral order they still hope to save. The result has been a lengthy pause in which these powers refuse to approve of or assist the American adventure in Iraq, but avoid any open defiance of American power.

 Instead, they are waiting ? for the resistance war in Iraq to grow into a second Vietnam that will turn the US public against the whole neo-conservative project. They half-dread the collapse of the dollar, but half-look-forward to it as a blow that might shift American policy.

 They are on hold, in other words, and will stay that way as long as they possibly can ? because the alternative is to start creating alliances and building up their own military power in order to contain the US. Do that, and you have started to lay the foundations for World War III, so nobody wants to go there.

 The great event in Europe was the ?big bang? expansion of the European Union from 15 to 25 members on May 1. The EU is neither a federation nor an empire, but it?s much more than a customs union. In fact, although Ukraine still has no promises from the EU, the popular hope that it might eventually become an EU member provided much fuel for the demonstrations in late November and early December that undid a rigged election, unseated a corrupt post-communist oligarchy, and set the country on the road to democracy. Something similar, though less dramatic, happened in Romania in December.

 Russia continued its drift back into authoritarian rule, with President Vladimir Putin winning a second term in March, thanks in large part to terrorist attacks by Chechen fighters in a war that he himself did much to trigger. He used the school siege that killed 331 people in Beslan in September as a pretext to proclaim an interventionist doctrine that mirrors the US doctrine of ?preemptive war?. 

 By contrast, the big western European countries had a year so tranquil that even the umpteenth miraculous escape of the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, from conviction on corruption charges ranked as big news. But there was one exception: Spain, where terrorist bombs on commuter trains in Madrid killed 190 people in March. The Spanish, who had firmly opposed their government?s support for the US invasion of Iraq, responded by voting the conservative People?s Party government out three days later. 

 The dominant motif in the Middle East during 2004 was the war in Iraq, but the single great event was the November death of Yasser Arafat, the embodiment of Palestinian aspirations for the past 40 years. But it was a measure of the success of the US-Israeli strategy for rendering him irrelevant that his death actually changed very little in terms of the realities and possibilities of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. A successor (Mahmoud Abbas) is to be elected chairman of the Palestinian Authority on January 9, but the notion that this represents a ?fresh opportunity for peace? in the region is fantasy. The peace process is frozen at the moment, and the freeze is likely to remain so long as the American hegemony in the Middle East endures.

 Events in Asia unfolded a good deal more smoothly, as they generally do these days. China, which lays no claim to being a democracy, had its own orderly hand-over of power, with the 78-year-old former president, Jiang Zemin, relinquishing his last lever of power, his control of the Central Military Commission, to his successor, President Hu Jintao, at the Communist Party?s central committee meeting in September. The main focus of the year, however, was China-Taiwan relations, which grew more tense with the re-election of Taiwan?s president, Chen Shui-bian, who narrowly survived an assassination attempt a day before the vote.

 The economic crisis of the late Nineties was long past, and prosperity was returning even in Japan. Indonesia elected a new president in July ? the first ever to be chosen by a direct popular vote ? and Malaysia also became much more democratic when Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi won a landslide victory in the March election. But there was no similar sense of glaciers melting in Singapore in August when Lee Hsien Loong, the son of the former prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, formally took over as the new prime minister.

 In October, hardliners in the junta in Myanmar removed the closest thing to a moderate in their midst, the prime minister, Khin Nyunt, in a mini-coup. The president of Philippines, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, surprised absolutely nobody when she declared in August that the country was in a fiscal crisis. Cambodia changed kings, Thailand blundered into an insurgency in its Muslim-populated southern provinces, the ceasefire in the long war between Sri Lanka?s Tamil minority and Sinhalese majority more or less held, and Pakistan?s General Pervez Musharraf was still in the saddle at year?s end despite widespread anger that he had broken his promise to give up command of the army this year.

 Africa presented its usual deceptive face to the world ? a mini-genocide in Darfur in Sudan, civil war in Ivory Coast, civil and religious strife in Nigeria, the threat of renewed war in eastern Congo ? as if Africa?s main problem was war. It is not, and it isn?t AIDS either. It is poverty, which is mostly the result of catastrophically bad government. So the important news from Africa is that there are increasing numbers of good governments, democratically elected, that serve the whole population rather than some narrow tribal base. In just the past month there have been two elections, in Ghana and Mozambique, that returned that kind of government. Things are bad in Africa, but not without hope.

 Which leaves Latin America, the media black hole from which only occasional news of disasters reaches the outside world. We had the usual ration of that this year, with excited reports of the not-quite-coup that unseated President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti in February and of the near-death experience of the left-wing Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, in the August referendum on his rule. We hear far less about the miraculous recovery of the Argentine economy, about the remarkable progress that the Brazilian president, Luis Inacio ?Lula? da Silva, has made in shifting resources towards the poor while building Brazil?s influence abroad, and about the South American Union that was launched in Ayacucho early this month.

 It all makes for a somewhat more hopeful balance-sheet than the one we usually see. It?s the big-picture stuff that is really worrisome. Oil hit $40 a barrel in May and has stayed above that price ever since. Climate change is galloping up on us faster than ever (though at least Russia ratified the Kyoto accord, which finally brings the treaty into effect). The whole international system that has kept the war between the great powers at bay for the past six decades is now under challenge. The pessimists are starting to fear that things are spinning out of control. So a sane and happy New Year to us all.

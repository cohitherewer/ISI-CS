 DIMINISHING NUMBERS

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the World Conservation Union?s Red List of Threatened Species, 2004

 Habitat destruction and associated degradation and fragmentation are the greatest threats to assessed terrestrial species. Habitat loss appears to be by far the most pervasive threat, impacting 86 per cent of threatened birds, 86 per cent of threatened mammals and 88 per cent of threatened amphibians. Habitat loss will remain a dominant threat, as there is no sign that human transformation of the landscape is showing. 

 Threat process vary both within and between taxonomic groups...Over-exploitation is a major threat to mammals, impacting 33 per cent of threatened species. For birds, over exploitation and invasive alien species are of similar importance, both impacting about 30 per cent of threatened species...For threatened amphibians, the major threats are different, with 29 per cent of species being affected by pollution (including climate change) and 17 per cent by disease (particularly chytridiomycosis). The interaction between disease and extreme climatic events (drought) is the leading hypothesis for widespread amphibian declines.

 Threat processes in the marine and freshwater systems are poorly understood. However, it appears that over-exploitation is presently the greatest threat to marine species... Incidental mortality as a result of fisheries is an increasing threat, affecting seabirds, marine mammals, and other marine species. Habitat loss is likely [to be] the most severe threat to freshwater species followed by pollution and invasive species.

 Threat processes are dynamic and change over time....

 People and threatened species are often concentrated in the same areas. This is especially true in much of Asia (in particular south-east China, the Western Ghats of India, the Himalaya, Sri Lanka, Java (Indonesia), the Philippines and parts of Japan, and in parts of Africa (especially the Albertine Rift in central Africa and the Ethiopian Highlands).

 The number of threatened species is likely to rapidly increase in regions where human population growth rates are high. Future conflicts between the needs of threatened species and rapidly increasing human populations are predicted to occur in Cameroon, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Madagascar, Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, Tanzania and Venezuela.

 Countries that currently have a low human population density but a high rate of population growth could be opportunistic places for pre-emptive conservation initiatives... 

 Countries that have the most threatened species tend to be those that are least able to invest significant resources into conservation.... 

 Globally-threatened species frequently require a combination of conservation responses to ensure their continued survival. These responses encompass research, species-specific actions, site and habitat based actions, policy responses and communication and education.

 The majority of threatened species require substantially greater action to improve their status. While many species already receive some conservation attention many others do not.

 Species can be, and many already have been, saved from extinction. However, this requires a combination of sound research, careful coordination of efforts, and, in some cases, intensive management.

 Improving the effectiveness of conservation action requires a better understanding of the needs for such action across species, the extent to which it is being applied, and the effects it has had in preventing species extinctions.

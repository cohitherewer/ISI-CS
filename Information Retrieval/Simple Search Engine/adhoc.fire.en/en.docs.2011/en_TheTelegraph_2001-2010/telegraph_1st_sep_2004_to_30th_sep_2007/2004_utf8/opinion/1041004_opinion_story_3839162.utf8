 THE OTHER SIDE OF ASSETS 

- The RBI annual report says little about inflation management 

S. VENKITARAMANAN

The annual report of the Reserve Bank of India for 

2003-04 covers the financial performance of the central bank during the period, 

besides giving an exhaustive review of macroeconomic developments in the country 

during the year. While one is, no doubt, interested in the expert analyses of 

the economic developments, the fact remains that there can be too much of a good 

thing. We had only recently been served an excellent review by experts of the 

government of India, drawing on the expertise both of the RBI and the government 

of India in the Economic Survey, which came in July 2004. The same ground was 

covered by the RBI in its monetary and credit policy survey of May 2004. The finance 

minister himself covered the same area in his budget speech. We wait now in readiness 

for the next round of the RBI?s reviews of the economy in the October 2004 monetary 

and credit policy statement.

While I do welcome the feast of reasoned analyses 

given by such reports, I think it is possible to restructure the frequency of 

such reviews more appropriately so as to conserve our scarce analytical resources. 

Also, frequency fatigues the interest of the targeted audience. It would perhaps 

be better if the RBI and the government consider a more effective sequencing of 

their economic surveys.

The annual report of the RBI for 2003-04 is statutorily 

mandated to be presented to the government of India every year. It primarily lays 

out the accounts for the year 2003-04 for the bank itself. The latest accounts 

show that during the year, the gross revenues of the RBI declined compared to 

the previous year. Whereas in 2002-03, the gross income of the RBI was Rs 23,185 

crore, it declined to Rs 14,323 crore in 2003-04 in spite of accretion of reserves 

under management. The reasons obviously lie in the decline in global and domestic 

interest rates.

The rate of return on the RBI?s foreign currency assets 

declined from 3.1 per cent in 2002-03 to 2.1 per cent in 2003-04. This reflects 

the fact that the RBI invests its foreign reserves mostly in debt-securities of 

the developed countries, which have been giving low yields of late. The problem, 

however, is that the bulk of the foreign currency assets, which are so invested, 

are made up as a result of liabilities incurred by India to foreign lenders and 

investors, who earn in India significantly more than they can in their own countries. 

This is particularly true of non-resident Indians and other foreign investors, 

who make it a point to invest only if they can get a good return ? better than 

the yields in their own markets. The net result is that we pay out more as accrued 

returns on liabilities we incur, while on our assets invested in developed economies 

we earn just the going rate. This is, perhaps, a necessary price to pay for security. 

But, it is, in effect, a mug?s game.

There must be better alternatives, which combine security 

with good returns. I venture to suggest one or two. One is to place a part of 

our reserves with some of our better-managed banks and financial institutions 

and allow them to lend foreign exchange to our corporate organizations, whom we 

allow to borrow the same in external markets. The return on external commercial 

borrowings will definitely be higher than the returns RBI gets on gilts in developed 

countries. Once a careful selection of borrowers is made, access to ECB through 

placement of the RBI?s foreign exchange assets with Indian scheduled banks can 

improve the earnings of these banks and hence those of the RBI on forex assets.

Another thought, which the orthodox may shudder at, 

is the Singapore example. The city state of Singapore alone has forex assets of 

the same order as India. It deploys a major part of these assets through an investment 

vehicle, the Singapore Government Investment Corporation managed by Tamaesk Holdings. 

Reports are that the latest returns of Tamaesk come to nearly 18 per cent per 

annum, compared to the merely 3 per cent or less earned by RBI. This calls for 

a highly professional management and political non-interference. Professionals 

of Indian origin are among those who help SGIC to earn its high returns. The Singapore 

model, which will result in the RBI morphing into a profit-earning foreign institutional 

investor, is worth looking at.

One result of the comparatively lower income of the 

RBI is an increase in the fiscal deficit of the government. As a result of the 

lower gross income, the RBI has a lower surplus to contribute to the government. 

The figures in the latest annual report show that, as against Rs 9,354 crore contributed 

in 1999-2000, the surplus transferred came down to Rs 5,400 crore in 2003-04. 

This is, indeed, a serious fiscal consequence of the RBI?s current policies.

The annual report has devoted considerable space to 

analyses of macroeconomic developments of 2003-04 and its prognosis of the scenario 

for 2004-05. What it says is important from the point of view of its stance on 

inflation. The report seems to take the view that while the wholesale price index 

has shown an increase of a sharp order in the recent period, the same is not true 

of consumer price index. The wedge between the two indices is relied on by the 

RBI as a source for solace. But ultimately the CPI catches up with the WPI. The 

shield, which is given by increasing competitiveness in the retail sector, is 

weak in India. The producers have power to inflict their higher prices on the 

consumer so long as our import barriers remain.

The annual report does not disclose any indication 

of the RBI?s intervention to use weapons of monetary policy, like cash reserve 

ratio and interest rate, to counter inflation. Its attitude seems to be based 

on the premise that the present inflation is mostly based on ?global? factors 

and that ultimately the global inflation will settle down. There seems to be a 

feeling of complacency about the overall inflationary pressures, based on the 

country?s high level of forex reserves and food stocks. But all that is just the 

beginning of an anti-inflationary policy. How anti-inflationary measures will 

work out depends on how the government handles imports and distribution of essential 

commodities and on the efficacy of competitive forces. Hopefully, the coming monetary 

and credit policy will give a clearer indication of the RBI?s thinking on the 

matter. 

I was struck by a revealing table on the net investment 

position of India in the external sphere. The table shows that the total foreign 

assets of India (including the RBI?s foreign currency assets) at the end of March 

2003 came to $94 billion, whereas the liabilities came to $154 billion ? showing 

a net excess of foreign liabilities to the extent of $60 billion. This is 11.8 

per cent of our GDP. The table also shows that this figure represents a decline 

from 21 per cent of GDP in 1997.

That means we are currently incurring more liabilities 

to foreign creditors and investors, even as we are accessing more foreign currency 

assets. Every dollar of foreign direct investment or that by FII is a liability 

no less than debt is. Even though we have forex reserves of $119 billion, these 

assets are built up on the back of an increasing burden of liabilities, which 

accrue costs.

True sustainability of balance of payments comes about 

only when we accumulate reserves on the basis of an improved net balance of trade 

surplus in both goods and services. This can come about only when we structure 

our trade policies appropriately to be friendly to exporters of goods and services. 

The price of a sustainable balance of payments is an environment that favours 

and encourages exports ? tax policy and trade policy are inextricably inter-linked 

in this regard. Hopefully, the United Progressive Alliance government?s latest 

effort is a good initiative in this direction.

The RBI?s annual report points out a number of possible 

directions in which India?s macroeconomic management can be improved. On the question 

of inflation management, it does not, however, reveal much. After all, it is the 

privilege of central bankers to surprise the markets. It was a wise central banker 

who said that central bankers exist to take away the punch bowl just when the 

party gets going. Is Dr Reddy waiting to fine-tune his attack on inflation at 

just the time when the party gets going in the market of India? Will he unleash 

the weapons of inflation destruction in his October policy or earlier? Only time 

can tell what the governor of the RBI holds in his armoury and chooses to use 

against inflation that threatens to block India?s progress towards growth with 

stability.

 Letters to Editor

 Perfect bliss

 Sir ? There?s no biz like showbiz, and no greater story for a media starved of celebrity news than the ever-impending marriage of one Liz (Hurley) (?Birthday with scent of a wedding?, Nov 5). It also works the other way. Such reports seem to be doing wonders to keep a middle-aged British actor with a progressively decreasing star appeal in the public eye. Witness the frequency with which Hurley makes her guest appearances in India, which now has its papers looking international. Already a happy marriage of interests!

 Yours faithfully,

S. Sen, Calcutta

 Slippery ground

 Sir ? The violent scenes in the Orissa state assembly were possible only because legislators enjoy undue immunity from law, especially within the house by virtue of Article 105(2) (?Chappal charge in house brawl?, Nov 4). This immunity should be abolished to eliminate wastage of public money that goes to the drain each time the proceedings of the house are disrupted. It may be recalled that members of parliament of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (Soren) could not be punished for taking bribe to vote in favour of the then P.V. Narasimha Rao government because the apex court ruled that the courts had no jurisdiction over the action of MPs, that is their votes, or anything said by them while the house was in session. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C.Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? The bedlam in the Orissa assembly has once again lowered the dignity of the legislature. It seems that legislators forget that their show is watched by the people through a live telecast. This is not the first time that such an incident has occurred in any legislature. As the editorial, ?Slipped past? (Nov 5) notes, the Uttar Pradesh assembly has witnessed a similar situation. Unfortunately, the 60-point code of conduct for legislators is still unrecognized and more flouted than practised. The unruly members of the house who disrupt the proceedings should be punished so that others do not follow their example.

 Yours faithfully,

Kishore Kumar Soma, Hyderabad

 Sir ? The chappal-throwing in Orissa assembly provides a glimpse into the mindset of the elected representatives. This, ironically, is a reflection of our own mindset. Why do we allow people, who believe that violation of democratic ideals alone constitutes realpolitik, to occupy important forums? Why have we allowed mafias and incompetent people to carve out a place for themselves in society and politics so easily? 

Yours faithfully, 

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Slipped past?, mentions only the incident in Uttar Pradesh. We should also recall a similar and more humiliating spectacle in the Tamil Nadu assembly during the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam regime when J. Jayalalithaa had her sari torn by a DMK member of the house in the course of a heated argument over the Cauvery waters. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul 

 Parting shot

 Sir ? During the pujas, I was distressed to see foreign tourists standing in long queues to get a glimpse of the idols and pandals, a showpiece of art and craftsmanship. Moreover, at the Outram Ghat, I witnessed another such tourist, who was trying to take a snap of the idol, being shoved and pushed by the crowd. Can?t the government make separate arrangements for these people to view the pujas in order to promote the sagging tourism industry in the state?

 Yours faithfully,

Sandeep Sethi, Calcutta

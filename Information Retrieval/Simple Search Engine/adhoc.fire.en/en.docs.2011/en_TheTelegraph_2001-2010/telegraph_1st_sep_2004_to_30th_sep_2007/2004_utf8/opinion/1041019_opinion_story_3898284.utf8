 PEOPLE?S WAR

 Last week?s violence by the People?s War in West Midnapore district throws up a new challenge to Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The outfit had struck in Midnapore and Bankura districts several times in the past two years. But the latest strike came in a dramatically different context. It happened at exactly the same time when the PW was preparing for its long-awaited talks with the Andhra Pradesh government. The talks in Hyderabad are politically significant for two main reasons. First, the PW is the strongest of the guerrilla outfits in the country. And Andhra Pradesh has long been its strongest base. Peace between the government and the PW in that state could pave the way for similar peace initiatives in other states where Maoist outfits have been active. That precisely is why even the Union home minister, Mr Shivraj Patil, is anxious about the outcome of the talks in Hyderabad. The strike in Midnapore, in which six jawans of the Eastern Frontier Rifles were killed, also came within days of the PW merging with the Maoist Communist Centre to form the Communist Party of India (Maoist). The talks notwithstanding, the formation of this new party could point to a new danger.

 The challenge before West Bengal?s chief minister has been complicated by these new developments. He cannot afford to submit meekly to the PW?s violence and invite it to peace talks in Calcutta. That would give a wrong signal, both to the PW and to the people of the state. The PW?s influence in West Bengal is still very limited, compared to its spread and power in Andhra Pradesh. Mr Bhattacharjee has taken the right line by refusing to talk to the group unless it gives up its politics of violence. However, his government must take more imaginative steps to isolate the Maoists from the common people in the backward districts of the state. The government also needs to take more realistic steps to alleviate poverty in these areas which helps the PW entrench itself there. It is possible that the Marxist rulers of West Bengal had been lulled into thinking that the Maoists would not target a state where land reforms had made some progress. In recent years, the Maoist threat has spread to many more states, such as Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Mr Bhattacharjee cannot afford to underestimate the potential of the threat worsening in West Bengal.

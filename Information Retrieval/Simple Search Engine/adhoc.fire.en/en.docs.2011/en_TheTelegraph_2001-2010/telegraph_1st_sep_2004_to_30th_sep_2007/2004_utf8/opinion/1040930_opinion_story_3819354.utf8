 BLARE OUT

 Politics, in the hands of the British prime minister, Mr Tony Blair, has ceased to be the art of the possible. It has become the art of the disingenuous. Addressing the Labour Party?s annual conference, Mr Blair admitted to his partymen that the reason why he went to war with Iraq was wrong. The evidence that Mr Saddam Hussein was amassing weapons of mass destruction was incorrect. This has been known for some time. Mr Blair has taken his own time to confess that his decision, which led to the loss of British lives, was based on fundamentally flawed premises. It is possible that this evidence was fabricated to bolster an a priori decision to wage a war against Iraq. Mr Blair has chosen to admit this at the present juncture because he knows that he has to go to the people next year. The Labour Party has been visibly embarrassed by its leader?s blatant purveying of misinformation. The admission by Mr Blair ? the closest he has come to saying that he is sorry for dragging Britain into an avoidable war ? is dictated more by political calculations than by sincerity.

 Moreover, Mr Blair has covered up his admission by declaring that he has no regrets about removing Mr Hussein. This is being too clever by half. The reason for going to war with Iraq was the ?fact? that Mr Hussein was creating an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. That fact was wrong. If Mr Blair admits this, how can he still justify the removal of Mr Hussein? If the war was to remove a tyrant, irrespective of whether he had weapons of mass destruction or not, then the matter takes an even more ominous turn. It would appear from this logic that Mr Blair is suggesting that he believes that he and his partner, Mr George W. Bush, the president of the United States of America, have the right to remove tyrannical leaders anywhere in the world. In other words, they have scant regard for the sovereignty of nation states and for international law. It is difficult to believe that Mr Blair might actually argue this in a public forum. Therefore, it must be assumed that Mr Blair is either unaware of the contradictions inherent in his statements or is deliberately being disingenuous. Mr Blair knows that he can take neither the British people nor the Labour Party for granted. The absence of a viable Tory opposition should not make Mr Blair become too smarmy for his own good.

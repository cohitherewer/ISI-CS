 TOOLS IN ITS RESERVE

 S. VENKITARAMANAN

 In the light of the rising inflation, observers had been eagerly awaiting the Reserve Bank of India?s credit policy, released on October 26. Contrary to market expectations, the RBI has not raised interest rates to control inflationary pressures. The governor observed that the rising inflation is primarily due to extraneous factors ? oil and commodity prices. Thus a rise in interest rates could affect growth. He also noted that the consumer price index has been raised at a relatively lower rate compared to wholesale price inflation. The governor added that further action on the fiscal front, initiated to reduce the impact of the global oil prices on inflation, was not possible as it would affect revenue.

 The mid-term review of the annual policy, taking into account factors which condition growth, including the monsoons and the global oil price rise which limit India?s GDP growth, estimates that the rate of growth here will remain in the range of 6 to 6.5 per cent, not higher. The policy statement notes the rise in the commercial banks? credit to various sectors till October 1 ? by 11.3 per cent in the current year compared to 4 per cent the previous year. Non-food credit registered a robust increase of 11.5 per cent compared to 6 per cent the previous year. 

 Comfortable figures

 Commercial banks? investments in bonds, debentures and shares of both public sector and private sector had declined during the period by 4.8 per cent as compared to 1.1 per cent the previous year. The policy statement also notes the total flow of resources from scheduled commercial banks, including these investments, which increased by 9.9 per cent. This means there has been a rise in the investment tempo, which augurs well for GDP growth.

 The policy statement acknowledges that the position of reserves is comfortable and justifies the current stance on exchange rate management. It is significant that exports, both manufacturing and services, have risen substantially in the period under review despite various pressures. The RBI statement reiterates the broad principles that have governed exchange rate management in the recent past. It also notes that the level of foreign exchange reserves will be maintained taking into account not only the anticipated current account deficit, but also liquidity at risk. 

 Honeymoon over

 The current account, however, had been in surplus continuously for the last three years. This trend continues. The policy statement does not have any significant observations on how to enhance incentives for exports, except mentioning that transaction costs will be reduced as a result of implementing the recommendations of various committees.

 As usual, the policy statement covers a large area although the interest of the financial community is concentrated on what it does to the interest rates. The rest of the statement is, in a sense, a review of actions taken by the RBI on various committees? recommendations and on the implementation of various reports. All this could be conveniently covered in a separate progress report and need not clog the policy statement, which should essentially focus on macro-economic variables.

 Whether the caution sounded out by the governor with respect to interest rates and other tools of monetary management will be sufficient to handle the inflationary trends in the economy is debatable. One can only hope that the governor will be in a position to react if an adverse situation develops on the inflationary front which calls for more drastic action. At the moment, he is keeping these instruments in reserve. The markets would surely welcome the absence of shock, although the policy statement has sufficient indication that the honey moon with low interest rates is over.

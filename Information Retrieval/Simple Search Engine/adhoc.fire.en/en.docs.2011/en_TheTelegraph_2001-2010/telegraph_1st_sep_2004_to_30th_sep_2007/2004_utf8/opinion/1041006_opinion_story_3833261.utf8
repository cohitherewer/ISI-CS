 Letters to Editor

 With an eye on terror

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra has, unfortunately, not dwelt on the possible fallout of continued insurgency in Nepal (?A terror in every bush?, Oct 1). The Maobadis are crossing over to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in large numbers to escape the heat of the clampdown on them. West Bengal is not safe either as the armed movement, too close for comfort, can stoke separatist movements in the state. We already have our plates full, with Bangladesh seemingly in no mood to stop being a haven for the dissidents of North-east India and the Inter-Services Intelligence, who are carrying on their agenda of dismembering India. It is very much in India?s interest to assist the Nepalese government to get its house in order. Besides, Mitra seems to have gone a trifle overboard in his apprehension of future American involvement in reining in our recalcitrant public sector employees when they go on strike. Does he think we are a banana republic? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra starts with a flourish ? ?Thus spake the army chief of staff...?. I believe he meant the chief of army staff. But this error is a minor one considering the others that he proceeds to make in his article. He says that enough evidence has already been collected to raise doubts about the army?s version of the events in Manipur. But how credible is this, since the court of inquiry instituted by the army is still in progress and the judicial commission on the Thangjam Manorama is yet to come up with definite conclusions? 

 Mitra condemns General N.C. Vij for what he has said about the Manorama incident. But a similar line has been heard from other spokespersons in the past, those both of the army and the Assam Rifles. Why single him out for attack? Mitra has been irresponsible in casting aspersions on the army, undermining this institution and asking for the removal of the army chief. He even goes to the extent of saying that the army can actually be a threat to the country?s integrity. This is a shame since he sleeps comfortably under the very blanket of security that the army provides him. Besides, if the army is such a vile force, why did Mitra?s comrades (in power in West Bengal) seek the army?s help during last year?s crackdown on militant camps in Bhutan?

 Hypocrisy and duplicity come naturally to Mitra and his kind. He directs his barbs at Manmohan Singh for going to New York to address the UN general assembly and meet George W. Bush. But he is neither critical of nor does he enlighten us about the purpose served when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his cabinet colleagues fly off to the West.

 Mitra?s criticism of Indian aid to Nepal to fight the Maoists is ludicrous. But then, communists have always been anti-Indian, not to forget their shameful role during the freedom struggle ? they even went to the extent of calling Subhas Chandra Bose a fascist. That they corrected themselves later is only to be attributed to political compulsions and not a change of heart. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jaideep Mazumdar, Madhyamgram

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra has observed that ?The Maoists have put to excellent use the collective resentment of Nepal?s masses against the monarchy, the Ranas and the carpet-baggers from India; they are waging, in effect, a three-in-one war of national liberation?. It needs to be recalled that non-violent ways can also be used to bring about a change of government; and this has been amply proved by Gandhi?s struggle against the British, and also by Nelson Mandela in South Africa. If the Maoists of Nepal really have a mass base, power will eventually come to them. However, they are not the repository of all wisdom. It is only fools who resort to violence to assert their views. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is ludicrous that Ashok Mitra should term armed insurgencies in Nepal as wars of national liberation. The world has seen enough of these to realize that such movements entail nothing but mindless bloodshed. Left politicians in the country continue deluding themselves about revolutions, but they are deluding no one else ? the Maoists are as oppressive as the people they claim to be fighting against, namely the monarchy, the Ranas of Nepal and the ?carpet-baggers? from India. And the fact that they control two-thirds of Nepal?s countryside does not lend them any credibility. Remember the taliban?

 Yours faithfully,

Y.V. Nanda Kishore, Calcutta

 Sir ? It came as a rude shock to see a communist economist suddenly turning into a defence and foreign policy expert. Why should The Telegraph be party to the slander against an organization without which India would have been bartered between Pakistan and China? 

 Yours faithfully,

Jennifer Da?Costa, Marmagao

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra thinks that the US concept of global terrorism is everybody?s staple diet. Further, by taking the examples of Bhagat Singh, Surya Sen, Binoy Bose and Rajguru, he reminds us that these heroes were taken for terrorists simply because the British considered them to be so. They were branded as anarchists because their struggle went against British interests. Are the Americans, in their so-called war against terror, following the British example ? that is, putting the ?terrorist? tag on anybody who dares to defy it? 

 The British had followed a divide-and-rule policy in India. Are the Americans doing the same in its war against terror, specifically categorizing Muslims as terrorists?

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Saving grace

 Sir ? Its been a trying time for the left, and not merely because it had to struggle so hard to stop the shroud over its criminal side from being lifted by an overzealous cop. Humayan Kabir seems to have forced the party to brainstorm more seriously than even the strongest of all capitalist threats. The end was the ?Rule-break theory for Kabir transfer? (Nov 4), obviously in the absence of any other plausible excuse. Here was a police officer, angry and hopelessly straight, who brooked neither official protocol nor political weight in frightening out every skeleton in the red cabinet. How could he be held back? It was impossible to slight his honesty (his superiors grudgingly concede) nor his intention. Haul him for his modus operandi then ? his ?indiscipline? and proximity with the media! But have they really managed to outsmart Kabir without falling on their faces?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Survival of the fittest

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha believes that Jawaharlal Nehru ?nurtured a multi-party system? (?Why India survives?, Oct 30). But did such a system actually exist during Nehru?s tenure as prime minister? The Congress ruled the roost in those days, winning successive elections with little resistance from other parties. It was only during Indira Gandhi?s time that the party faced real opposition, both from within the party and outside. But even with such little resistance, and despite Nehru?s claims of being a ?socialist?, his government did not hesitate to impose an outright ban on the Communist Party in the early post-independence years. Neither did Nehru have much qualms about unfairly dismissing Kerala?s Marxist government of E.M.S. Namboodiripad ? the first communist government in the world that came to power through ballot and not bullet ? in July 1959. 

 Nehru stifled his own party and concentrated virtually all powers in himself so that the party played second fiddle to his government. Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru?s mentor, was no better when it came to adherence to democratic principles. Remember the spat with Subhas Bose? Gandhi also used his influence to dissuade Sardar Patel from becoming the first prime minister of independent India even though 9 of the 15 provincial councils voted in Patel?s favour.

 The Congress has had a long history of subservience, blind worship of individuals and flouting of democratic norms. That unhealthy trend continues even today.

 Yours faithfully,

Saumitra Banerjee, Hereford, UK

 Sir ? It is not clear why Ramachandra Guha has left out the Indian postal services from his survival kit. Perhaps the shining steel and piercing siren have taken his breath away, much like Apu?s and Durga?s, leaving little for the ?dak harkara? immortalized by Sukanta Bhattacharya. Be that as it may, the brand of cricket which Guha believes binds India is certainly not British. For the Brits it was one way to bask in the sun on a lazy winter noon. It does not fit into the category that prescribes waving shirts from the Lord?s balcony.

 Yours faithfully,

K.K. Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha fails to take note of some developments which have paralysed the country?s institutions. Although he is quick to condemn Indira Gandhi, Vir Savarkar and Laloo Prasad Yadav, he chooses to ignore the destructive tendencies of the communists. Right from rubbishing India?s freedom as ?fake?, they have openly defied many of the nation?s inherent values. 

 Another thing Guha fails to note is the way mediocrity has come to rule the nation. Our policymakers are guilty of promoting it in various names, sometimes to ?honour? the sentiments of the minorities, at other times to create ?equal? opportunities for all. Everyone has the right to live with dignity, but should it be at the cost of excellence? 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? Contrary to what Ramachandra Guha thinks, it is not Hindu chauvinism that partitioned India. It is either religion or language that binds the nation. Since India is multi-lingual, it is only religion that can hold the nation together. Otherwise, it will break up like Yugoslavia.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? India may have survived as a geographical entity, 

but only just. Its identity as a nation-state is still not clear to its residents. 

Which is why both the North-east and Kashmir continue to pull in two different 

directions. This is also the reason why non-indigenous candidates are hounded 

out of examination centres in Bihar, Assam and Maharashtra. Even now, petty issues 

like river-water sharing spark off riots between two states. Bengalis are driven 

out of Mumbai and Assam and icons like Tagore and Satyajit Ray are ridiculed outside 

Bengal only because they are Bengalis. 

Had India really imbibed the ideas of Tagore, Gandhi and Ambedkar, tribals would have been given their due. It is precisely because the windows are closed and knowledge is not allowed to flow freely that Hindutva continues to be attractive.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 NO COUNTRY IS SAFE ANYMORE 

Religious bigotry, intolerance and the discourse of 

exclusivity are affecting the entire subcontinent, and not merely Bangladesh, 

argues Mollica Dastider 

 Rising tide in Bangladesh 

?It is a question of ideology. We are against fanaticism 

while they are against secularism?, claimed a shaken Sheikh Hasina Wajed, opposition 

leader of Bangladesh, after surviving an assassination attempt during a political 

rally in Dhaka. The rally was, among other things, to protest against the government?s 

sponsoring of religious extremist forces. Politics in Bangladesh, in keeping with 

the trend in the subcontinent, has taken a decisive turn towards extreme polarization 

on this issue. While the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its radical Islamist 

allies insist on a more explicitly Islamic identity of the Bangladeshi people, 

the opposition Awami League has been forced to spell out its anti-fundamentalist 

position. 

?[It] is high time for all to offer a united resistance 

[to religious fanatics],? Hasina urged, ?otherwise none [in] this country will 

ever be safe.? However, Begum Khaleda Zia?s political secretary told the BBC that 

Bangladesh remains ?established and identified as a moderate Islamic country?. 

But the recent assertions of Islamist terrorist groups in this fourth-largest 

Muslim majority country of the world clearly shows that battle lines are drawn 

between the fanatics, democrats and ?secularists? here.

The growing erosion of secular values is well demonstrated 

by the visible apathy of the BNP regime in bringing to book the zealots who indulge 

in terror. The alarming rise in Islamist militancy is particularly evident in 

north-eastern Sylhet and the Chittagong provinces, where subversive activities 

reached a peak in May this year. While a grenade attack injured the visiting British 

high commissioner at a Sufi shrine in Sylhet, the militants killed a senior Awami 

League leader in Satkhira, murdered a newspaper editor and, more recently, killed 

another Awami League activist in Sylhet. Besides threatening to stop the circulation 

of the country?s leading daily, Pratham Alo, for reporting extremist activities 

in Chittagong, they have managed to back up their persecution of the Ahmadiya 

community with a government ban on the latter?s worship and literature. These 

developments, together with the apparent unconcern of the regime in expediting 

investigations into violence, only underscore the belief that the BNP?s coalition 

partners ? Jamaat-e-Islami and Islamic Oikya Jote ? simply do not want the government 

to pursue the terrorists. The public reiteration of the jihadis to kill 

Hasina Wajed further exposes the immunity enjoyed by them in the country?s civil 

and political space.

Even though the Awami League has been at the receiving 

end of extremist ire, its secular credentials are also open to question. When 

it enjoyed power in the past, the party showed a clear lack of political will 

to check the activities of pro-taliban Islamic radicals, apparently so as not 

to lose support of the Islamic constituencies in the country.

Hasina Wajed?s public appearance as a devout Muslim 

during the 2001 general elections illustrated this aptly. Furthermore, on the 

eve of the elections, when systematic violence was unleashed against religious 

minorities in the countryside to deter them from exercising their voting rights, 

the Awami League did little to resist the persecution. Despite its well-entrenched 

support base in rural Bangladesh, the party sought to silently tide over the episode, 

lest it be branded anti-Islamist before the general elections. Nonetheless, its 

current desperation to save Bangladeshi civil and political society from fanatics 

calls for the urgent attention of democratic forces of all hues.

From the partition of Bengal on the basis of the ?two 

nation? theory, to the assertion of Bengali nationalism against Pakistan to the 

latest refashioning of an Islamic identity ? the history of Bangladesh has proceeded 

in a strange spiral. If the native peasantry?s Islamic identity was the original 

ground to secede from a Hindu zamindar-dominated Bengal, for East Pakistan, 

this identity mattered little during its struggle against the Urdu-speaking Pakistani 

rulers. Yet the centrality of Bengali language and cultural nationalism that so 

animated the liberation of Bangladesh seems powerless today to resist a return 

to an orthodox Islamic fold. In effect, this Islamic Bangladeshi identity aims 

to dissolve, once and for all, the shared space of Bangladeshi people with the 

Indian and Hindu Bengalis, and to deny the cultural traditions that upset all 

exclusive nationalist frameworks and religious borders. 

The BNP is now intent on appropriating Islamic symbols 

for its legitimacy. But the supervening role of Islam was reiterated in the Eighties 

when General H.M. Ershad declared Islam as state religion. This process has met 

with sporadic but powerful public resistance, but has been unleashed once more 

in recent years. The aim is to drive a permanent wedge between the Islamic and 

the syncretic Bengal, erasing residues of the secular Bengali nationalism once 

upheld by the constitution of Bangladesh.

Of course, the rise of ?Islamophobia? in the Anglo-American 

bloc makes it easy for fundamentalists across the world (Christian right, the 

Zionists and Hindutvavadis) to equate Islam with terrorism. But the appeal 

of Islamist militancy among the poor and marginalized in Muslim majority countries 

is also taken as a licence by political elites to flirt with the forces of Islamic 

obscurantism. The primary identity of the Bangladeshi people is an emotional and 

ideological battleground today, making it extremely vulnerable to intolerant discourses 

of exclusivity.

In fact, rather than isolate the case of Bangladesh, 

one needs to recognize that religious bigotry, intolerance and the discourse of 

exclusivity are factors affecting the subcontinent ? partitioned once on these 

grounds already. Such factors have not only led to a renewed and bitter polarization 

between the religious right and the tolerant liberals around us, but there is 

also a distinct parallel in the modus operandi of the forces involved. 

In its new avatar, religious majoritarianism has shrewdly resurfaced as a majority 

community-based nationalism, trying to eliminate inherent differences in our plural 

contexts, targeting minorities and fomenting waves of assault and subjugation 

in a ploy to gain political power. The overwhelming presence of the Hindutva forces 

in India, the first-ever electoral success of Jamaat-e-Islam in Bangladesh and 

the pro-taliban Muttahida Majlis-e Amal in Pakistan, are all symptomatic of this 

particular development. The polarization in Bangladesh between Muslims and non-Muslims 

is no different from that in India.

Should this be taken to mean that religious extremism 

in one country is in reaction to the extremism spawned in the neighbouring land? 

This theory has many takers even among seasoned observers who explain the developments 

in Bangladesh as a response to prior developments in India and in the West. Not 

surprisingly, Bangladeshi fundamentalists warm up to such explanations quite easily, 

and their representatives spare no effort in underscoring the point. No one can 

deny that the demolition of the Babri mosque in 1992 and the subsequent rise of 

the Hindu right in India did play an extremely significant role in the process. 

But the adoption of this reaction theory in effect leads one to unduly ignore 

the internal factors behind Bangladesh?s Islamization, factors that reveal the 

relative lack of its development under successive regimes. More important, such 

a view wrongly pits the Hindu right and Islamist right as antagonist forces, missing 

their underlying proximity in action and rhetoric.

The factor that binds these forces together is their 

identical hate campaigns against the respective religious ?other? ? Muslims in 

India and Hindus in Bangladesh. The so-called cultural nationalist agendas are 

premised upon excluding the ?other? in each context, which becomes the ?self? 

in another location. This is how they draw a positive sustenance from the mutual 

conflict, targeting in common the democratic ethos of the region. Thus, we are 

told that ?nationalism is another word for Hindutva? by the Bharatiya Janata Party 

after its chintan baithak in Goa, or that Uma Bharti is a?staunch nationalist? 

fighting the ?pro-Muslim, anti-national? Congress in India. 

On a similar vein, the Bangladeshi Islamists adopt 

a nationalist pose and dismiss the minority persecution in their country as mere 

?anti-Bangladesh campaign? by the ?pro-India? opposition of Sheikh Hasina. Together, 

they constitute a south Asian political fraternity, and this is what political 

analysts need to recognize.

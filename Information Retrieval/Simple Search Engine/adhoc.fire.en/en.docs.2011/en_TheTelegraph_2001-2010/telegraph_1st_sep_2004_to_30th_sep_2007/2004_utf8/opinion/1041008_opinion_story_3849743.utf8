 Tales, codes and faux pas

Mosquito and Other Stories: Ghana-da?s Tall Tales (Penguin, Rs 200) by Premendra Mitra is Amlan Dasgupta?s crisply readable translation of some delectable Bengali stories, which started appearing in periodicals from the mid-Forties. Ghana-da is a sort of Munchausen or Mandeville of the post-War Calcutta mess-bari ? the fantastical raconteur of 72 Banamali Naskar Lane. An entire generation of readers ? children and adults ? learnt about Sakhalin Island, the orang-pedeck and Schistocerca gregaria from the Ghana-da tales. Premendra Mitra was a poet, novelist, essayist, short-story writer and film-maker, who wrote these stories for the pure delectation. ?What must have appealed to us about these stories then, I realize, was the absence of any apparent didactic intent,? Dasgupta writes in his introduction, ?The exotic settings, the audacious inventiveness, the sheer power of the narratives were what counted.?

Dante?s equation (Orbit, ?7.99) by 

Jane Jensen is one of those apocalyptic bestsellers in which the future of 

mankind hangs in balance because of a threat to American national security. It 

moves from a school outside Jerusalem, through a laboratory in Seattle to a lecture 

hall in Orlando, thus ranging across the diverse, but connected, worlds of rabbinical 

cryptology, wave-pattern theory and national security. This is a giddy and characteristically 

alarmist mix of science, philosophy, the occult, history and religion ? because 

Jensen believes that ?beyond good and evil anything is possible?.

Something black in the lentil soup (Penguin, 

Rs 250) by Reshma S. Ruia is an irreverent portrayal of three parallel 

cultures ? British, Indian and British-Indian ? by a writer who is described as 

?somewhat of a cultural hybrid [the use of ?somewhat? is wrong here]?. Kavi Naidu 

is a Delhi poet, pompous and sentimental, who goes to London to compete for the 

Commonwealth Poetry Prize, where he is in for every kind of culture-shock. Among 

others, Naidu meets the suave and enigmatic Seth, India?s most celebrated literary 

gent and Naidu?s nemesis for many years. Resolutely refusing to see the pitfalls 

awaiting him, Kavi stumbles from muddle to faux pas to disaster.

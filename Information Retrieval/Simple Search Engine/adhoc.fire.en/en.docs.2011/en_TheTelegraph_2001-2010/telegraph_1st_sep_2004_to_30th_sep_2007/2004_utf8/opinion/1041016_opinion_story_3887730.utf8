 JUST FRIENDS

 The police are human, they are allowed to make mistakes. They might, by mistake ? or mistaken good intentions ? confine the minor victim of a reported rape in the police station for two days instead of the alleged rapist. That is what happened recently at Hariharpara in Murshidabad district, when the father of a Class VI student brought his daughter to the police station with a complaint of rape against a local young man. That the latter is in custody now is the result of the father?s determination: the Murshidabad superintendent of police ordered the arrest in response to the parent?s written complaint to him.

 But it is not as if nothing had been done. The local leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) took over the task of judgment and decided to fine the alleged rapist the sum of Rs 10,000 at a ?conciliation? meeting. The local police did not find anything awry in this friendly method of smoothing over a violent crime and held the victim with the promise of a medical test that never took place. It can be inferred that the conciliation meeting at Hariharpara would have been the model of the shalishi courts that the party has been proposing. The uproar that followed the proposal has, for the time being, stalled the formation of these bodies, but it is quite clear that the concentration of power in the local party committees is quite enough for such ?judgments? to take place anyway. Summary judgments, especially in cases involving women, are very often made by local bodies. Public beatings, stripping and parading of women are common, and women are sometimes asked to apologize even when it is clear that they have been raped. ?Conciliation? in the case of rape or molestation results in marriages of the rapist to the victim, or the paying off of the victim?s family by the rapist?s. Once given the quasi-official authority of a shalishi court, such local bodies will be able to hush up crimes against women without glitches, and protect criminals that they feel are on their side. Social criminality on this scale is difficult to conceive of, but its dangers can be imagined even from a case like the one in Hariharpara.

 There is another aspect to the ?judgment? that must be explored. One reason behind it is the apparent consideration for the victim: a local leader has suggested that proper police procedure now would cause problems during the girl?s marriage. It is heartening that the girl?s father is more interested in justice. But the attitude is familiar ? support for a sexual criminal masquerading as paternalistic protectiveness. It is the same logic that makes people believe that marrying off a girl to her rapist is both justice and conciliation. The refusal to acknowledge the meaning ? or even the existence ? of violence against women is one of the mainstays of this kind of popular justice.

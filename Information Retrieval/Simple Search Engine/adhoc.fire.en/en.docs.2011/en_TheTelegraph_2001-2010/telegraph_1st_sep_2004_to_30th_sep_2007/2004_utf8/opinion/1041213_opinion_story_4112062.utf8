 DIGGING UP MORE DIRT

 A high court order quashing the Tangarpada mining lease agreement may have sullied Naveen Patnaik?s image, writes Debabrata Mohanty

 Tainted shine

 The pristine image that the Orissa chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, had carefully preserved over the last four years suddenly looked vulnerable when a division bench of the Orissa high court quashed a joint venture between the Industrial Development Corporation Limited and Jindal Strips Limited for mining chrome ore in the Tangarpada area of Dhenkanal district.

 The high court order came even as dozens of investors interested in setting up multi-million tonne steel plants were making a beeline for this sleepy state. But it was not just the quashing of the agreement that has dented Patnaik?s image. Equally damaging were the court remarks that the state government acted in a lackadaisical manner, if not deliberately, with a view to showing undue favour to the Jindals while granting approval.

 ?Every state action must be informed by reason...Rule of law contemplates governance by law and not by humour, whims or caprices of men to whom the governance is entrusted for the time being,? noted the division bench comprising the chief justice, Sujit Burman Roy, and the judge, A.S. Naidu. They were borrowing the language of a Supreme Court judgment in the 1991 case, Delhi Transport Corporation vs DTC Mazdoor Congress. The bench directed Idcol to go in for fresh bidding and specify clearly in a fresh tender about the proposed value addition it required while exploring the mines. Though the court did not quite castigate him, the judgment was enough to jolt the chief minister. 

 Idcol had selected Jindal Strips as its joint venture partner for ex-ploring and operating the Tangarpada chrome ore mines following global tenders floated in October 2002. Though Idcol was granted the Tangarpada mining lease in 1986, it failed to move earth over the area until 2002 owing to the lack of finances. Following the government?s permission, Idcol decided to seek a private partner to explore the area. Accordingly 27 bidders responded to the tender of which only four ? Jindal Strips, Visa Industries, Tata Steel and Jindal Steel and Power ? remained in the fray.

 Later, the first three submitted financial bids. However, Idcol selected Jindal Strips on a technical consideration and did not even open the bids of the other two parties. Idcol argued that Jindal Strips had proposed the maximum value addition (by setting up a stainless steel plant) for the state, overlooking the fact that it had quoted a lower price for the chrome ore compared to the other two. The state government later approved Idcol?s proposal. Surprisingly, TISCO and Visa Industries were not officially informed by Idcol about the rejection of their bids. After the opposition raised the issue in the previous assembly, a house committee was formed to look into charges of corruption in the deal. The committee scrutinized the financial bids, which had not been opened until then. But before it could complete its inquiry, the assembly was dissolved.

 The court said that Idcol officials had not considered the effect of the incentives and exemptions claimed by Jindal Strips on the state exchequer and on the public interest. ?If exemption is granted to Jindal Strips for 20 years in respect of sales tax, Central sales tax, entry tax alone as demanded by them, Central and State governments will lose revenue to the extent of Rs 20,000 crores over a period of 20 years on this score alone,? the court said. ?The government gave its approval in a most mechanical manner without applying its minds to the relevant facts of the case,? it went on.

 The high court also observed that Idcol?s technical committee had not dealt with the important issue of the eligibility of Jindal Strips. The committee also did not consider the aspect that Jindal Strips did not have much experience in the exploration of chromite ore since it had never explored in Orissa which had 98 per cent of the country?s deposits.

 Describing it as a milestone, the leader of opposition, J.B. Patnaik, claimed that the court verdict on the Tangarpada mining lease had put a question mark on other mining deals signed by the government. The combined opposition has now paralyzed assembly proceedings for the last five days, beating cymbals and gongs inside the house and demanding the criminal prosecution of Naveen Patnaik as well as his resignation. The opposition has even submitted a memorandum to the governor with these demands.

 The opposition is now targeting Patnaik over the joint-venture agreement between the state-run Orissa Mining Corporation and Vedanta Alumina that is setting up a one-million-tonne alumina refinery at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi district. The opposition parties allege that the OMC-Vedanta agreement was signed in violation of environment and forest laws and is not in the interests of the state. 

 Patnaik, however, has defended his government?s mining policy and has gone on appeal before the Supreme Court. To counter the opposition attack, the Biju Janata Dal has printed five lakh booklets to put across its point of view. The 12-page booklet reportedly gives a detailed account of the Tangarpada controversy to establish that Patnaik had no hand in selecting Jindal Strips to explore the Tangarpada mines. The booklet lauds the achievements of the government during the last five years and puts the blame on the officials.

 But many feel that the opposition may have overplayed the Tangarpada mines issue. Political analysts believe that J.B. Patnaik has not been able to inflict much damage on Naveen Patnaik as people are yet to forget the former?s tenure as chief minister. J.B. Patnaik, who earlier was rejected this year at the hustings for his misrule and crony nepotism, had headed one of the most corrupt regimes in Orissa.

 While Naveen Patnaik weathers the aftershocks of the court verdict, the state?s all-powerful bureaucracy has come in for flak with the court saying that there is need to minimize the scope of arbitrary use of power. ?It is inadvisable to depend on the good sense of the individuals...It is more improper and undesirable to expose the precious rights like rights to life, liberty and property to the vagaries of individual whims and fancies. Individuals are and do not become wise because they occupy high seats of power and good sense, circumspection and fairness do not go with the posts, however they may be....In particular, in a society pledged to uphold the rule of law, it would be both unwise and impolite to leave any aspect of life to be governed by unfettered discretion of an authority when it can conveniently and easily be covered by the rule of law.? It is a wisdom the officials must heed to avoid a controversy like Tangarpada in future .

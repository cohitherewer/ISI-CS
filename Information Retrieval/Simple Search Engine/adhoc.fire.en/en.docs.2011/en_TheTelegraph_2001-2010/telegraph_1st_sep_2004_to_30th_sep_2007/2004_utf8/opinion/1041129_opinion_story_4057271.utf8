 UNCLE TOM OUT OF HIS CABIN

 In refusing to see the difference between ?time wasted? and ?time lost?, Clive Lloyd went against the spirit of cricket, writes Raju Mukherji

 On the backfoot

 There are just too many Uncle Toms in the International Cricket Council. These black and brown men seem to be in a race among themselves to keep the white man happy. Not that the white man expects such flattery, but servility is in the genes of some people.

 The decision of the former West Indies cricket captain Clive Lloyd, the match referee for the recent India-Pakistan one-day match at Eden Gardens, reeked of ignorance of the spirit of cricket. He punished India for slow over-rate by suspending the Indian captain for two tests. According to the letter of the law, Lloyd was correct. But then, cricket is not about printed laws alone. There is a far more important issue ? the issue of the spirit of the game.

 Lloyd, in his hurry to punish the brown man, did not use his judgment in the manner a quality judge would. He failed to see that the extra time played on that night was not ?time wasted? but ?time lost?. ?Time wasted? would imply a deliberate wastage, whereas ?time lost? would mean time spent owing to factors beyond human control. What can a human being do, if nature decides to take charge?

 Every cricket-lover and the media observed on that day that the match ended late because of the unprecedented volume of dew on the field. After each delivery, the ball had to be wiped and dried. The slippery outfield made running risky. So, for the sake of safety, the soles of the boots of the fielders and bowlers had to be cleaned quite often.

 Unfortunately, Clive Lloyd could not see beyond the rims of his spectacles. He went by the word of law instead of using his discretion to view the circumstances involved. This shows that a top-class player need not be a top-class judge. The responsibilities of a judge are obviously different from a player?s.

 Another important issue was that not one man in the stands or in the media box complained about the extra time that the match was played. They too realized that the players were not playing the delaying game. The game was played in the best of spirit as enunciated in the Preamble to the Laws of Cricket. The time that the injured players like Salman Butt and Rahul Dravid spent in treating their injuries on the field was well within their rights. The rival teams gave no quarters, nor expected any in return. And when the match was over, they embraced each other. This is what sport is all about. The match was indeed a grand advertisement for the game of cricket.

 Unfortunately, one man had different ideas. Lloyd decided that he would use the rod. He probably thought that he was keeping the white man happy. It was a silly form of racism that reflected bias, ignorance and pettiness. The gravity of the decision was lost on him. Sitting alone on the judgment throne, he lost his vision and perspective. He just could not judge the ambience or the environment of the fantastic battle in progress. He had made up his mind to act tough and show the world that he was the boss.

 This decision of Clive Lloyd would not surprise cricket-followers. Ever since Lloyd came to the forefront as a match referee, he has been flexing his muscles and power a little too often. And that too particularly on brown cricketers. Shoaib Akhtar and Sourav Ganguly are his favourite targets.

 It is indeed ironical that Lloyd should suddenly decide to act as an innocent man after all the misdemeanours of his own playing years. Lloyd is one captain whose track-record regarding the spirit of the game is extremely poor. Is this not the man under whose captaincy West Indies would generally bowl about 12 overs per hour? Is this not the man whose fast bowlers resorted to intimidatory bowling tactics in the Kingston test of 1976? Is this not the man under whom the West Indian fast bowler, Michael Holding, kicked down all the stumps when an appeal was rejected by the umpire in a test in New Zealand? Where were Lloyd?s standards of sportsmanship at the time?

 If the readers would care to remember, it was the same Clive Lloyd who had called off the World Cup semi-final between India and Sri Lanka just because some plastic bottles were thrown on the field. Yes, bottles were thrown on the field that evening. But Lloyd should have remembered that bottle-throwing was a West Indian pastime in the Fifties. No test in the West Indies was ever abandoned because of it.

 During the World Cup semi-final, had Lloyd shown a little more patience and diligence, the nuisance could easily have been brought under control and the match played till the end. But he had other ideas. He wanted to prove to the world that the Eden Gardens crowd was far too volatile and uncivilized to host an international cricket match. Now, after retirement, Lloyd is all set to forget his past in Guyana. He is now a resident of the United Kingdom. He wants to keep the white administration of the ICC happy. Lloyd, the great captain and cricketer, has been a great disappointment as a match referee.

 Now that the ICC arbitrator, Tim Castle, has overturned his decision, would the ICC be pragmatic enough to remove Lloyd from the high pedestal? He has lost his credibility. The players and the spectators have lost faith in him. It is time that the ICC removes the man whose bias is all too apparent. Uncle Toms invariably perish. They never win in the long run.

 MORE ON RURAL BENGAL 

- Rural Bengal is hardly better off than Orissa, Bihar or Assam 

Omkar Goswami

Is there any point to which you wish to draw 

my attention? [asked Watson] 

To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.

The dog did nothing in the night-time.

That was the curious incident, remarked Sherlock 

Holmes. 

 Arthur Conan Doyle, Silver Blaze.

In my previous article, I had touched upon an uncomfortable 

contradiction between economic growth and prosperity in rural Bengal. On the one 

hand, West Bengal seemed to have achieved strikingly impressive growth in agriculture 

as well as state GDP throughout most of the Nineties. On the other, National Sample 

Survey data suggested that real (inflation adjusted) levels of consumption of 

rural households in Bengal had worsened compared to the all-India average between 

the early Nineties and 2001-02. The growth in agricultural productivity and output 

was not resulting in proportionately higher rural consumption expenditure. I had 

concluded that there was a disjunction that needed careful investigation.

Instead of finding any meaningful answer to the riddle, 

I have discovered many other bits of evidence that reinforce this contradiction 

between West Bengals growth versus its relative lack of rural prosperity. 

Let me take you through another set of indicators this time using the Census 

of India data for 2001.

According to the state GDP data, West Bengal can be 

classified as a High-Medium state. In longhand, it means that during 1993-2000, 

the state enjoyed high per capita GDP growth (a very impressive 6.5 per cent per 

year), with medium per capita GDP (almost Rs10,400 in 1999-00, measured at constant 

prices). That puts West Bengal in an enviable cluster of well-performing states 

such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and ranks it better than Kerala, Andhra Pradesh 

and Himachal. Indeed, if we go by this yardstick, only Gujarat can claim to have 

both higher per capita GDP growth as well as per capita GDP than West Bengal.

In 2001, 43.5 per cent of rural Indian households 

had electricity connections whether these worked or not is a different story. 

Again, Himachal topped the list with almost 95 per cent. For a seemingly power- 

surplus state, West Bengals track record was pretty tragic. Merely a fifth of 

the rural households in the state had electricity for lighting, with only Orissa, 

Assam and Bihar being worse off.

The flip side of this is the percentage of rural households 

that used kerosene for lighting. In 2001, the all-India rural average was 55.6 

per cent. Not surprisingly, at 79.2 per cent, rural West Bengal was way above 

the all-India average, with Uttar Pradesh (including Uttaranchal), Orissa, Assam 

and Bihar for company.

Lets move on to television sets, scooters and motorcycles. 

In 2001, almost 19 per cent of rural households in India owned a TV. Punjab topped 

with over 60 per cent, followed by Himachal with over 50 per cent. In contrast, 

only 13 per cent of rural households in West Bengal owned TVs which was only 

a bit better than Assam, Orissa and Bihar. As far as ownership of scooters and 

motorcycles went, the national average was 6.7 per cent of rural households. In 

West Bengal, it was 3 per cent, which was just a tad better than Bihar.

The condition of houses in rural West Bengal is also 

completely out of gear with the states seeming growth in agricultural income, 

productivity and GDP. According to the 2001 census, 41 per cent of rural households 

in India had permanent or pucca dwellings. It was less than 25 per cent 

in rural West Bengal and, yet again, the state was better than only Orissa and 

Assam. As far as the materials of roofs were concerned, 24 per cent of rural households 

in India consisted of brick, stone or concrete; in West Bengal it was 12.6 per 

cent. Regarding the material of outer walls, almost 48 per cent of rural households 

in India had walls of brick, stone or concrete; again, West Bengal was way below 

average at 26.7 per cent sandwiched between Orissa and Assam.

That brings me to what I consider the worst bit of 

housing statistic. Over three-quarters of rural households in West Bengal did 

not have any source of drinking water within their homestead; and of these, 84 

per cent didnt have any electricity. These translate to staggeringly large numbers: 

8.55 million households in the state going elsewhere to fetch water; of which 

7.18 million had no electrical connection. In 2001, only Orissa was worse off 

than this.

These data are from the Census. For one, everyone 

considers the Census data to be extremely reliable. For another, it is for the 

population as a whole and, hence, bereft of any sampling bias whatsoever. Therefore, 

the evidence cant be brushed aside as machinations of a global bourgeois conspiracy.

There are only one of two ways in which I can think 

of squaring such data with West Bengals apparent growth in agriculture and state 

GDP. The first is that while there have been improvements in all the indicators 

between 1991 and 2001, these have not been substantive enough to lift rural Bengal 

from being a part of the Orissa-Bihar-Assam cluster. In other words, the villages 

of Bengal may be better off than before but that the improvements are nowhere 

near good enough to rank in the top half of the national sweepstakes. That would 

be the charitable explanation. From being desperately poor, the villages have 

risen to being merely poor which is still far removed from being better than 

average.

If these were substantively correct growth rates, 

then one ought to have surely seen much more significant improvements in the countryside. 

In the absence of such progress, and given the metronomic precision with which 

the growth rolled off year-after-year, I have to revert to Lalmohan Gangulis 

(a.k.a. Jatayus) oft-used phrase, Highly suspicious, Felu-babu, highly suspicious 

indeed.

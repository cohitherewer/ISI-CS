 ON THE PREDATOR?S TRAIL

Monster of God: The man-eating predator in the jungles 

of history and the mind 

By David Quammen, Hutchinson, pound; 25

Man has been waging a battle for survival against 

predators in the animal kingdom from time immemorial. This conflict has claimed 

many lives. But modern technology and sophisticated weapons have ensured that 

humans have the upper hand in this battle at present.

 It is being estimated that the population on earth may touch the 11 billion mark in another 150 years. The birth of every child puts pressure on the natural landscape, turning forests into farm lands and rivers into gutters. This, writes Quammen, has brought the predators to the brink of extinction.

 A visit to the Gir forests, famed for its lions, was the starting point of this book. The King of the jungle faces a bleak future. ?As settlements and agriculture increasingly claimed the landscape, lions lost caste as well as habitat, they were transformed from the kings of the forest to ecological brigands?, writes Quammen. 

 Other predators like the saltwater crocodile in northern Australia, the brown bear in the mountains of Romania and the Siberian tiger are threatened with extinction too. Trailing these predators through some of the most difficult terrains in the world, Quammen is fascinated by the relationship between the predators and the people who live among them. 

 Quammen livens up the book with engaging anecdotes ? crocodile skins fetch a heavy price in world trade while tiger skins cost hundreds of dollars if the animal has been killed in its winter fur.

 Another talks about how the Romanian president, Nicolae Ceausescu, turned the brown bear into his pet quarry. A ruthless dictator, Ceausescu adhered to the ancient notion that a strong leader must also be a great hunter and plundered the forests of Romania. His tally of slain bears remains unmatched even today.

 According to Quammen, the man-tiger conflict in India has a long, bloody history with tigers ending on the losing side. In 1877, tigers killed 800 people. Between 1902 and 1910, the number was 851 and it soared to 1603 in 1922. But this figure fell as tigers became scarce in the late 20th century.

 As late as 1982, tigers were still killing nearly 45 people in the Sunderbans and about 20 in the Kheri district along the north central border. There are two possible reasons for tigers turning into man-eaters in these areas ? the shortage of natural prey due to human encroachment on the tiger habitats and the increasing incidents of the wild beasts straying into human settlements located in the periphery of the jungle.

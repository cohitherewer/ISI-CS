 Places that don?t fit in

Falling off the map: some lonely places of the 

world (Penguin, Rs 225) by Pico Iyer collects little travel 

pieces of ?loneliness and space?. Iyer thanks the brothers at the Immaculate Heart 

Hermitage in Big Sur ?for offering peace beyond measure and the perfect place 

in which to think about loneliness and space?. There is a prettily, and occasionally 

glibly, written opening chapter describing Iyer?s personal notion of the ?Lonely 

Place?: ?Lonely Places are the places that don?t fit in; the places that have 

no seat at our international dinner tables; places that fall between the cracks 

of our tidy acronyms (EEC and OPEC, OAS and NATO).? This idea is then linked to 

a more private one of the traveller?s solitude. Iyer?s pieces range over North 

Korea, Argentina, Cuba, Iceland, Bhutan, Vietnam, Paraguay and Australia. ?In 

the twilight of Australia, the foreigner can catch an intimation of what Melville 

calls ?the great America on the other side of the sphere?, and so a sense of how 

everything brings him back to the natural state where he began: a lonely person 

in a Lonely, Lonely Place.? It is difficult to exorcise the Rough Guide from this 

kind of travel-writing-which-is-trying-to-be-more-than-travel-writing.

With one lousy free packet of seed (Profile, 

Rs 195) by Lynn Truss is a thoroughly entertaining saga of misunderstandings 

by a writer, columnist and broadcaster who had started out as a literary editor 

with a blue pencil. Her best known work is one on punctuation, called Eats, 

Shoots amp; Leaves. This one is her debut novel, and features 48-year-old 

Osborne Lonsdale, a down-at-heel journalist, mysteriously attractive to women, 

who writes a regular celebrity interview for Come Into the Garden. But 

there is also a TV sitcom star Angela Farmer, Gordon Clarke, a teenage inventor 

of organic virtual reality programmes, Lillian, the neurotic secretary with a 

mail-sorting phobia, and Michelle, the obsessive sub-editor who has a secret crush 

on Osborne. 

Barbarians at the gate (Arrow, ?5.20) 

by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar is a bizarre financial mock-epic, as 

rivetting as a thriller, about the largest corporate takeover in American history. 

With a stake of $25 billion, the battle for the control of RJR Nabisco during 

October and November 1988 became a symbol of the greed and power-mongering of 

the Eighties. The rules were simple: Never pay in cash, Never tell the truth, 

and Never play by rules. Burrough and Helyar are Wall Street Journal men 

who received, for their coverage of the RJR Nabisco takeover, the Gerald Loeb 

Award for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism.

The great war: perspectives on the first world 

war (Pimlico, ?8.50) edited by Robert Cowley collects thirty 

essays by some of the most eminent military historians on every aspect of World 

War I, perhaps the true turning point of the 20th century and history?s first 

total war ? the Massacre of the Innocents at Ypres in 1914, the Gallipoli campaign 

(described from the Turkish side), naval warfare as the British and German sailors 

experienced it at the Battle of Jutland, the near breakdown of the American commander, 

John H. Pershing, and the rarely told story of the British disaster on the Tigris 

River in what is now Iraq. There are pieces by Jan Morris, John Keegan, Michael 

Howard, Stanley Weintraub and John Bowers.

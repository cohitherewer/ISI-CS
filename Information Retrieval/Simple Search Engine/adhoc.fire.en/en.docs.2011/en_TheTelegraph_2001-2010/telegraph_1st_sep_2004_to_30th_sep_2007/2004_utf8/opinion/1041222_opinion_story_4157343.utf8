 JUNK YARD

 Antiquated is not always antique. This simple truth needs to be reiterated in India which is an antique land full of antiquated laws. One such law forbade photography in Indian airports. Now, in a bizarre twist, the ban has been lifted for all domestic airports but the law holds in all international airports in India. It is difficult to understand the logic of the distinction being made in the given context. What is even more difficult to comprehend is the need for such a law. Given today?s technology, it is easy to photograph in great detail any airport in any country. But laws like these continue to be promulgated and remain in place. It is still forbidden to take a photograph of the Howrah Bridge, or Rabindra Setu, as one is supposed to call it these days. Another law prohibits photography in the Calcutta Metro. These laws were made before modern technology made possible the taking of pictures from satellites. But they continue to flourish and even when they are changed, the attempt is risible. Only a bureaucrat with a lot of time on his hands and with the iron firmly in his soul could have conjured up the distinction between international and domestic airports mentioned above.

 Indians are paranoid about security. Some time back, defence ministry officials had proposed that maps issued by the Survey of India should not show contour lines and should not highlight the intersections between latitudes and longitudes. The fear was that contour lines on maps reveal the lie of the land to enemies. Nobody remembered that the use of remote-sensing satellite images has made the lie of the land of all countries an open secret. This proposal, like the law prohibiting photography in airports, had no basis in fact or logic. Such laws and proposals are rooted in a mindset that finds ecstasy in controlling things for the sake of controlling things. The mindset harks back to an era that is now in the dustbin of history, and that is exactly where antiquated laws should go.

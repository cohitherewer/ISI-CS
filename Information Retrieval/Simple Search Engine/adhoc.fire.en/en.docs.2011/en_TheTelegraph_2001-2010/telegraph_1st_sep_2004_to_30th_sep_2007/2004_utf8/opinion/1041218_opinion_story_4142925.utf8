 Out and About

 When in Hollywood, do as actors 

 do. Which means: unless you?re the big star, take whatever?s 

 on offer. Naveen Kama Sutra Andrews learnt that long ago. 

 After stellar roles in English Patient and Bride amp; Prejudice, 

 the actor has just been tapping the paranoid sentiments 

 of millions of Americans with his role of Sayid, an Iraqi, 

 in the ABC series, Lost. It?s about a group of plane-crash 

 survivors on a mysterious island. Andrews?s USP is that 

 he doesn?t wait for Indianised roles, he just takes up whatever 

 comes his way. Take a cue, Ash Rai!

 Martina Navratilova

 Who better to teach the ?art of 

 living? a successful life than Martina Navratilova? And 

 come February, she?ll visit the land of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar 

 as part of a unique power-ladies conference titled ?Strength 

 of a Woman: Celebrating Success?, organised by The Art of 

 Living Foundation. The conference could also see actress 

 Maria Shriver (aka Big Arnie?s wife), Queen Noor of Jordan, 

 Sushmita Sen and Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, among others. But 

 it?s Martina we need. Maybe, she could even get Leander 

 Paes to get off the ramp and on to the court for a while.

 Shyamolie Varma

 Before you ask, ?Shyamolie Varma who??, here?s a refresher. ?Shy? was a supermodel, the muse of Pierre Cardin, before she shied away from public view 13 years ago. She?s back as an artist now, with her exhibition, ?Cosmic Brush?, in Mumbai. She says painting helped her cope with stardom during her heyday. Now don?t ask, ?What stardom??

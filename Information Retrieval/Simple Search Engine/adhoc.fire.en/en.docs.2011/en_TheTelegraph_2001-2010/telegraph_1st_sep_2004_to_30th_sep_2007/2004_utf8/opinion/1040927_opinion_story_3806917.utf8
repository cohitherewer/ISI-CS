 LET?S BET ON THE FUTURE

 Gwynne Dyer

 Yudhoyono is actually quite a serious man who was seen by his army colleagues as efficient and incorruptible, but even his closest adviser, Muhammad Lutfi, admitted: ?This election is not about policy. This is a popularity contest so we sell (him) like a brand image.? It?s enough to give you doubts about the future of Indonesia?s new democracy. 

 It is not just Indonesia. There has been an avalanche of new democracies in the past 20 years, and there are doubts about the quality of democracy in a lot of them. At the same time, many people in these countries have become nostalgic for the sheer stability of the old regimes: in a poll conducted by the Asia Foundation last December, 53 per cent of Indonesians agreed with the statement: ?We need a strong leader like Suharto (the former dictator, overthrown in 1998)...even if it reduces rights and freedoms.?

 What works better

 The UNDP has calculated that 81 countries moved towards democracy in the Eighties and Nineties, and that by 2002, 140 of the world?s almost 200 independent nations had held multi-party elections. The old-fashioned tyrannies are a dwindling minority, and this year will see more free elections than ever before: 110 of them, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.

 Most of the world?s democracies are new, and many are still suffering from the economic upheavals that accompanied the process of democratization. The voters are inexperienced, so demagoguery works better than in the older democracies. There is also the disillusionment that comes when people realize that changing the political system does not solve all the country?s problems. It just changes our way of dealing with them, hopefully for the better, but it?s bound to take some time for the benefits to become apparent.

 Collective wisdom

 When a society opts for democracy, it is betting that the collective wisdom of the majority is superior to the judgment of any single powerful individual or group. That is almost certainly true in the long run, but it can be quite wrong in the short run. On the other hand, the kind of individuals who rise to power in tyrannies are even more prone to catastrophic errors of judgment.

 Take Indonesia. The 31-year Suharto dictatorship, covering most of the country?s independent history, delivered economic growth, but siphoned off most of the profits for the benefit of a narrow elite of the dictator?s cronies and collaborators. The three presidents who have governed the country in the six years since Suharto?s overthrow, chosen by a parliament where interest groups that were powerful under the old regime still had much influence, were disastrous in different ways, but all were incapable of addressing Indonesia?s problems effectively.

 By contrast, in the first election where Indonesians were allowed to vote for a president directly, they have rejected the do-nothing incumbent, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and also the man expected to be her successor, indicted war criminal General Wiranto ? in favour of the plodding sincerity, dogged honesty and fine singing voice of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The popular wisdom may not be all that sophisticated, but it probably isn?t wrong, either.

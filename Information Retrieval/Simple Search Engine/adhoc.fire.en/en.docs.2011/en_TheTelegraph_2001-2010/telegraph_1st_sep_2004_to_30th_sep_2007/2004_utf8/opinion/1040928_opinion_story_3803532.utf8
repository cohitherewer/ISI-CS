 Letters to Editor

 Indefensible strategy

 Sir ? It is exasperating to see the left, especially Jyoti Basu, criticizing Montek Singh Ahluwalia so vehemently (?Left five line up against Montek?, Sept 22). Its objections only unmask the party?s hypocrisy. If accepting advice on our economic policy from foreigners is so reprehensible, why do the leftists refer back to the gospel of Marx or the sermons dished out by Kremlin or Beijing, some of which even threaten our national interests? While it is true that the IMF-prescribed policies have resulted in crises in many Latin American and east Asian economies, it has to be remembered that these countries are not comparable to India both in terms of development as well as size. Besides, mentioning Joseph Stiglitz?s book, Globalization and Its Discontents, to substantiate his claims does Basu?s image no good. Has he not heard of Jagdish Bhagwati?s In Defense of Globalization? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Aruni Mukherjee, Earlsdon, UK

 Sir ? It is surprising how the left, which is the beneficiary of the World Bank-IMF largesse, can be so peeved at the presence of their consultants in the Planning Commission. One remembers how the left booed Robert MacNamara and strongly objected to the money granted by him as president of the World Bank to India. Now the left has no qualms in courting officials from such institutions (World Bank projects worth millions of dollars are in the pipeline in West Bengal). 

 It is known that some past and present members of the left have received their political baptism at institutions patronized by the US and west European governments. Many have honed their intellect in the academic institutions of those very nations which they have come to despise. Were they disillusioned after their sojourn, or were they keen to take the best of both the worlds ? The left may come to repent its objection to foreign consultants the same way it now repents its decision to ban English at the primary level.

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Left or right, inclusion of any agent or person, who owns allegiance to some other country, in the planning bodies of another country, does not speak highly about the latter country?s capability to take care of its own affairs. It is like calling over a rich neighbour to plan the monthly budget of a poor household. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjoy Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir ? Regardless of the merits of the left?s ?ballyhoo? over the presence of foreign consultants in the Planning Commission, one can say that now that the left has tasted blood, it will be on the prowl. Beware UPA.

 Yours faithfully,

K.R. Rangaswamy, Madison,US

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Left ballyhoo? (Sept 23), against the left-leaning economists ignores the bulk of their letter. The leftists pointed out that the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and McKinsey have all given recommendations that serve the interests of international banks, multinational corporations and so on, while ignoring the interests of the countries being advised. Almost every non-governmental study of the debt crises and structural adjustment programmes reveal so. 

 Moreover, Ahluwalia?s justification for including them ? that the Bank has given India large loans ? violates both economic and common sense. But instead of debating these matters in-depth and with the respect they deserve, why say that these economists have ?very little to do?? 

 Yours faithfully,

Shankar Gopalakrishnan, London

 Sir ? The left is going out of its way to object to the inclusion of World Bank and ADB officials in the Planning Commission. May we hope that the Marxists? hostile views against these officials will soon change and give way to a more favourable one ? like the one they now have about the industrialists and capitalists they are wooing to invest in West Bengal? There is reason to hope that they will. The Marxists were once vehemently against the use of computers but things are not as dismal now. It just takes time before the Marxists see things in the right perspective. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The presence of foreign consultants in the Planning Commission is a necessary evil ? they are not hired merely for their expertise but also to act as interlocutors to maximize harnessing of resources from other agencies and nations. The dissenting economists in the commission?s advisory bodies would serve the nation better if they stayed put in their assignments and acted as the conscience-keepers of the nation by monitoring the activities of the foreign consultants. Their threat to quit unless the latter are removed is queer and their motive, questionable. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.P. Singh, Sahagunj 

 Sir ? The events surrounding the left?s dissent points to the need for re-orienting the principle of coalition governments. This will save them from being dictated by their allies, especially since the latter often lack the ability to adopt a balanced approach to solve a crisis. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? Along with the left-leaning economists of the Planning Commission, the leftist historians who have found their way into the human resource development ministry should also quit.

 Yours faithfully, 

S.N. Behera, Sambalpur

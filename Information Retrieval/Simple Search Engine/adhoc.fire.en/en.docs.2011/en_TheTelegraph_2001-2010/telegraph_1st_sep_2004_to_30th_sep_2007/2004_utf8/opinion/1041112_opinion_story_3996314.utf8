 ON A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PEDESTAL

 Nirmalendu Bikash Rakshit

 Only days back, the chief minister of West Bengal observed that the judiciary was overstepping its jurisdiction and intruding into domains legally reserved for the legislative and executive. His view is shared by many others. The contention is that the Constitution has assigned specific duties and responsibilities to the three organs of government. Crossing the limits would create problems since smooth working of the government requires mutual trust and respect among the three.

 In the recent past, court strictures on political rallies, puja pandals blocking roads, condition of roads, reservation of seats on the basis of religion and so on have been seen as ?overstepping? this limit. Changes in the procedure of the removal of judges have been prescribed so that the judiciary is made more accountable to the legislature. A judicial commission headed by the chief justice of India has been recommended to make judges more accountable. 

 There can be no doubts about the division of authority but in reality, the organs of the government cannot be completely independent or equal in power and position. That would mean a blind acceptance of the theory of separation of powers. There, in fact, can be two types of power distribution ? the British and the American type. 

 Sovereign authority

 In the first, the parliament is ?sovereign?, and hence dominates over the other two organs. Though sovereignty is the attribute of the state, the British parliament possesses it as well. According to A.V. Dicey, a law enacted by parliament can never be declared null and void by the courts. Moreover, no court of England can invalidate a constitutional amendment made by the parliament. Above all, the parliament can pull down the executive and even dismiss a judge. The parliament in England is thus the most powerful organ.

 In the case of the United States of America, the makers of the constitution probably had an inherent suspicion about human nature. They believed that power had a natural tendency to corrupt, and thus even the popular representatives could damage the rights and liberties of the people. They thus reposed power in the judiciary. They did not explicitly grant such an overriding power to the Supreme Court, but Article3(2) and Article 6 tacitly placed the judiciary on a higher pedestal.

 Service security

 Justice C.J. Marshall enunciated the doctrine of ?judicial review? by which the supreme court established its superiority over the other two organs. Marshall claimed that as judges had to take an oath to preserve and protect the constitution, if an act of parliament or an executive order contravened the provision of the constitution, the judges had to declare it ultra vires and void. 

 Though India largely follows the British model, it eagerly emulates the American principle. Article 13(2) informs that if a law passed by the legislature or an act of the executive affects a fundamental right, it may be declared null and void by the Supreme Court. Articles 32 and 226 give the individual the privilege to move court against an infringement of a fundamental right. Article 131 says that the Supreme Court can decide whether parliament or a state legislature has made any law beyond its allotted power.

 Thus the superior courts of India have the legal right to keep the other organs under restraint. This is why the Constitution guarantees service security to judges. If in the US the judiciary has usurped this authority, in India, the Constitution itself has offered it to the judiciary for the preservation of liberty, democracy and the rule of law.

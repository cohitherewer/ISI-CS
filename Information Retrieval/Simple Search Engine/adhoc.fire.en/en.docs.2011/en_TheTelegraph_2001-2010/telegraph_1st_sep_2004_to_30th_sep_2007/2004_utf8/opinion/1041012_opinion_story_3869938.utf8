 BREATHTAKING

 Calcuttans will simply have to learn to live with it, and to die of it. The West Bengal government is either too inept to ever meet the national vehicular emission standards, which came into effect from October 1, or it could not care less. Perhaps it is a bit of both. But the unruffled naturalness with which the transport department has resigned itself to its own failure to do anything at all about the fatal levels of vehicular pollution in Calcutta is truly astounding. The story of this failure is a long and disgraceful one of apathy, inefficiency, cluelessness, corruption and treachery, each of shockingly criminal proportions. But what takes the cake this time is the nonchalance with which the matter has been quietly turned into a non-issue. And it has probably really become one. Hellish hospitals, impossible roads, poisoned drinking water ? if such things can be prolonged for long enough in Bengal, then sooner or later people get used to them. They even become part of the city?s unique, and therefore celebrated, way of life.

 The situation is hopeless at two levels. First, this is a civic failure. The government and its various civic bodies have concertedly shown their indifference to the physical well-being of the people. Clean air and water are the most basic entitlements of all citizens, and the state has failed them here. The pollution control board, the transport and public vehicles departments, and the police must all be held jointly responsible for this. When the government was unable to meet the last Bharat-II deadline in April, it tricked its way out of accountability by fastening on the October 1 deadline. It was then warned by the court to not treat the intervening period ?as a holiday?. But it has done nothing whatsoever in that time, and has written to the Centre for yet another extension of the deadline. Second, the government?s five-year-long disregard of the directives of the Supreme Court and the Calcutta high court on this matter points to a kind of anarchy that strikes at the heart of governance. The judiciary is not supposed to be wasting its time over such things, in the first place. And to be ignored repeatedly by the government undermines the authority of the judiciary in a way that is profoundly detrimental to the health of any polity. Meanwhile, the state seems to be getting away with chronic misgovernance as well as slow murder.

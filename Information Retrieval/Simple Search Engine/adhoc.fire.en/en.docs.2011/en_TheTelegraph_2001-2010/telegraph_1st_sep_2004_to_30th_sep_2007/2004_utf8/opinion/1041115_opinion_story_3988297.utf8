 HERE COMES THE REAL BUSH FIRE

 In the end, ?moral issues? were more important than Iraq. But George W. Bush need not bother with US public opinion any more, writes Alok Ray 

 Hand in hand

 All pre-poll surveys predicted a close race ? a virtual tie between George W. Bush and John Kerry. Exit polls even indicated a Kerry victory. Nonetheless, Bush, the ?accidental president? of 2000, won another four-year term in 2004 by a margin of 3.5 million votes, winning 51 per cent of popular votes. How to explain this?

 Several theories are doing the rounds. According to the most popular media theory at this moment, ultimately the decider was not the Iraq war but the so-called ?values? or ?moral issues? like abortion, gay marriage and embryonic stem cell research. Exit polls indicate that about 80 per cent of the people who considered these to be the priority issues voted in favour of Bush. Further, more than 50 per cent felt that moral values were more important to them than the state of the economy. That is the reason why Bush won decisively in the mid-west and the southern states, which are by and large more conservative, religious and faith-based than the so-called liberal belts of the north-east or the west coast. 

 Eleven states put the issue of gay marriage on their ballot papers (as a kind of referendum) and in all these states, voters voted by 60-70 per cent against the legal rights of gay marriage. In fact, keeping such issues on the ballot may have given the signal to voters (a clever Republican election strategy) that these are the priority issues (not the Iraq war or the job situation or social security or health insurance or the huge budget deficit) before the nation on which referendum is being sought by this election. The gay marriage issue lit up the old abortion issue ? the question of when life begins and the right to end it by choice ? as well as the growing concern that the lifestyles of Hollywood stars are undermining the good old Christian values which the average American holds dear to his heart.

 Many thought that the record registration and turnout of young voters would help the liberal Democrat position in the polls. But this was swamped by the mobilization of voters by the churches and various faith-based organizations in crucial states like Ohio.

 Of course, the Iraq war and the fight against terror mattered to voters. But on that, the majority of voters seem to have accepted the Bush position. They are certainly not happy with the way the Iraq war has gone and the mounting loss of American lives, being shown on television everyday. But they are not sure of the vacillating position of Kerry and his untested leadership to save America from the terrorists. They would rather go with Bush who has shown his ?toughness? with the terrorists even though he has sometimes targeted the wrong people. In fact, many believe that it is the dogged tough stand of Bush against terrorists all over the world that has saved America from another 9/11-type catastrophe.

 There is another interesting revelation here. A survey by the University of Maryland found that about 70 per cent of Bush supporters believe that the US has sufficient evidence that Saddam Hussein was closely associated with al Qaida. Further, about one-third of Bush supporters believe that weapons of mass destruction were actually found in Iraq. Many of these Americans are religious watchers of a single news channel? Fox TV ? that is unabashedly Republican. So, there are reasons for arguing that a good deal of credit for Bush?s victory should go to misinformation and ignorance among a large section of voters about the reality of the Iraq war.

 Then there is the power of visuals. A particularly moving commercial on television was one where Bush, with tears in his eyes, is shown to embrace and comfort the daughter of a 9/11 victim. The girl clings to him almost as if he were her lost father. Such emotional promotionals enhanced the image of Bush as a humane person among the electorate, no matter what the rest of the world might think about him

 As far as the loss of jobs in the US is concerned, most Americans seem to have accepted that the slowdown in the US economy had started even before Bush took over from Bill Clinton. And they are convinced that it is mainly due to the end of the global information technology boom and part of the business cycle. The 9/11 tragedy is supposed to have further aggravated the problem. Bush cannot be held responsible for that. In fact, by saving the US from another such attack, Bush has actually saved the economy from facing more uncertainty.

 No doubt, Bush has gone for huge tax-cuts which have benefited the rich rather than the poor. He has not given any clear plan to cut down expenditures or reorient spending to benefit the majority. As a result, the massive budget deficit ? $5 trillion over the next 10 years if the Bush tax-cuts are made permanent ? would continue with great peril for future generations of Americans. In fact, Bush is in favour of tax simplification, which may imply that he may go for a less progressive tax system by moving towards a more uniform income tax rate, a greater reliance on sales tax and abolishing taxes on dividends on grounds of double taxation. He is against the import of cheaper drugs from Canada to protect the US drug industry, though it would keep the cost of prescription drugs beyond the reach of many Americans. 

 On social security for retired people, he prefers more contribution from individuals and less from the state. Further, the funds in these individual accounts would be invested more in the stocks and bonds issued by the private sector. Although these may hurt the relatively poor and middle-class American workers and benefit the corporate sector, these issues are far too subtle for the average voter, who can be, and have been, swayed much more by the ?values? rhetoric and misinformation. As a letter to the editor put it: ?The Democrats have become so liberal that they don?t fear God any more.? Who can argue with this position on the basis of logic?

 Finally, what about the policy towards the rest of the world in the next four years? In Bush?s words, he has earned ?political capital? and he intends to spend it now. Many fear that he and his advisors would interpret his victory as a mandate to have more of the same things. This may mean the same one-sided stance in Israel-Palestine conflict, the continuation of support to authoritarian regimes (like the current Saudi rulers) so long as they promote US economic interests and discard them (like Saddam Hussein) if they behave differently. 

 Under Bush, the majority global opinion would be ignored if that is in the interest of US business ? more than ever before. With handsome Republican majority in both houses of the Congress secured, Bush need not even have to bother too much about US public opinion any more.

 Early and late Tintin 

The aDventures of Tintin In the Land of the Soviets 

 amp;

Tintin and Alph-Art

One wily Gaul, a druid and a menhir delivery man; 

and a young journalist and his friend, a former sea-captain: these set of characters 

from two different comic strips captured the imagination of the world and continues 

to live in the collective imagination of millions of readers. There are no prizes 

for guessing the names. Asterix, Getafix and Obelix, and Tintin and Captain Haddock 

have already become the stuff of legends.

 The two books under review are the first and the last of the series. Tintin in the Land of the Soviets first appeared in 1929 in a children?s supplement to a Belgian daily newspaper, Le Vingti?me Si?cle. Herg?, Georges Remi was then only 22 years old. The other book, Tintin and Alph-Art, was begun in 1978 and remains unfinished. Herg? didn?t know where the story would lead. This is more in the form of an outline, even the drawings were not complete, though the dialogue was. The last pages of this book reproduce a series of unpublished documents, recently discovered, that shed fresh light on the ?incomplete conclusion? of the story.

 Tintin in the Land of the Soviets bears marks of an artist and a story-teller trying to come to terms with his chosen form. There is no colour of course, and the drawings are not as clear and as strong as they became in the later books. This is most evident in the depiction of Snowy, Tintin?s pet dog. But already some of the familiar features of the Tintin tales are in place. Tintin?s integrity and courage are unshakeable; his narrow escapes already suggest that he is invincible; Snowy more than once comes to Tintin?s rescue. The speed of the adventure is enough to keep a child spellbound. The unforgettable humour of the later volumes is absent because neither Captain Haddock nor Professor Calculus makes an appearance in this earliest of Tintin?s exploits.

 One remarkable feature is the way Herg?, even as early as 1929, perceived the oppressive and fraudulent character of the Soviet regime. The lies, the torture chambers and the deprivation of the people are all encountered by Tintin. It is remarkable that Herg? caught on to this reality at a time when some of the great minds of the 20th century were swearing by the ?achievements? of the Soviet Union.

 Herg??s last work sees the maestro in full flow. All the familiar figures are in place, including Bianca Castafiore. There is an encounter between Haddock and avant garde art and another between him and a mystic. What more could one ask for. The Captain describes the mystic as an ?ectoplasm?. Like many of the other terms used by Haddock, this too is unforgettable. It is a pity that Herg? did not get to finish the story.

 Neither of these two books quite rise to the level of some of the best Tintin stories. Nonetheless, they are delightful and the unfinished story offers a glimpse of how Herg? worked.

 EXTRAORDINARY

 Death or the Lok Sabha. Such is perhaps the choice of destiny for mythically lawless Indians like Veerappan and Phoolan Devi, although it did not end up being a choice for the latter. Failing health and general superannuation compel the most hardened criminal to aspire for legitimacy. Veerappan?s periodic demands for amnesty and his interest in a ticket from Tamil Nadu?s Dharmapuri ? where, ironically, he was shot down ? attest to this. His life and crimes were a prolonged indication of that strangely elusive, yet no less enduring and shocking, traffic between the legitimate and the illegitimate in Indian politics. That a criminal career could look, quite naturally, from smuggling ivory and sandalwood, extortion and murder towards the legislative assembly should surprise very few hardened watchers of Indian politics and society. Veerappan had even managed to give to his wild demands the ?political? flavour of the moment ? nationalist, socialist, anti-TADA, pro-Cauvery, pro-Tamil Eelam, or whatever. And if he had wanted to go for the respectability of a legislator, then he would perhaps have had not one, but two states bidding for him. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, rather their respective chief ministers, police and special task forces, have managed to sustain their spirit of competition over him for a remarkably long time. Hunting Veerappan must have become an addictive game.

 Veerappan is said to have committed his first murder in 1969. Since then an astonishing number of policemen, STF men, forest officials, apart from herds of elephants and forests of sandalwood trees, have succumbed to his greed, vengeance and brutality. Regimes have changed numerous times in the two states. Chief ministers have come and gone. Yet Veerappan, and the shadowy nexus of patronage, protection and intimidation that he embodied, have gone on, unabated and unhindered, almost magically, for more than thirty years. This is why the STF?s boast of a ?stunning, two-track intelligence gathering? that got him at the end sounds stunning in quite another way. Why did the best manpower, intelligence and funding from two states take three decades to get the man? But the STF, at least, has not whiled away the years, as the Sadashiva commission report could reveal, if it is ever published. Veerappan?s tribal kin and castemen will have other stories to tell about this undoubtedly ?extraordinary intelligence operation?.

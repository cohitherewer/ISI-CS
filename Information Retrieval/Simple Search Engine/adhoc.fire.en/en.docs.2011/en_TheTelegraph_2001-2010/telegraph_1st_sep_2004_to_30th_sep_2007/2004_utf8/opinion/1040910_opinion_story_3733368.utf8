 LIFE IS A ROMP

DREAMING TO SOME PURPOSE: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY By Colin 

Wilson,Century, pound;12

?When I was sixteen, I decided to commit suicide? 

? that is how Colin Wilson starts to write about his life. No doubt, this is an 

exceptionally stunning beginning to an autobiography. But, for Wilson, this is 

more than a literary device to shock the reader into attention. Wilson?s autobiography, 

which may be said to articulate his existential angst, demands a more sensitive 

interpretation. 

 Like his French forerunners Sartre and Camus, Wilson was intensely stirred by ?suicide?, asking whether it was the only meaningful act in an otherwise ?absurd? universe. In his own way, he reminds one of the French situationist, Guy Debord, who thought that the modern man, in this ridiculously ?spectacular? society, was posed with only two options ? revolution and suicide.

 But Wilson is not exactly a revolutionary, neither is he an existentialist pessimist like Camus. In his autobiography, he calls himself a ?romantic nihilist?, obsessed with sex and given to voracious reading. He believes that there may have been a meaning of life, even if that meaning resides outside it. 

 This, he prefers to call ?the outsideredness? of the universe, defining the twentieth century as the ?age of defeat?. Wilson?s non-stop sexual escapades and intellectual pursuits were primarily attempts to stave off ?attacks of panic? and boredom. But these also provide him with a ?focus? in life, which, he felt, was sorely missing in the unsettling dispersion that life embodied.

 In his first book, The Outsider (1956), which made Wilson a name to reckon with, he explored the despair of an age. His subsequent books like The Origin of the Sexual Impulse, A Criminal History of Mankind, The Occult, Beyond The Occult prove Wilson?s fascination with off-beat subjects involving people who have been swept aside by modern civilization. 

 As such, Wilson?s autobiography represents a map of this intellectual journey, which took unpredictable turns ever so often. Similarly, it comes through as a compilation of many biographies as Wilson, an anarchist turned mystic who now conceptualizes ?the pyramid of consciousness?, has lived many lives. He is brutally frank about his sex life, and frankly brutal about driving home his convictions. There are no half-measures in his style, nor even stray attempts at appearing consistent. Can anyone deny that these are the qualities all of us love in an autobiography?

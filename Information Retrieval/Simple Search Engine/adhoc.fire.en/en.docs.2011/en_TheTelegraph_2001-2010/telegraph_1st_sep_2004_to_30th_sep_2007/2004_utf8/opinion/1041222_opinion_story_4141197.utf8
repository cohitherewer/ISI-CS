 TUNED TO SMALLER NEEDS

 Abhijit Bora

 Often, when there is a cricket match played anywhere in the world, Doordarshan broadcasts it on its national channel. It then blacks out all other entertainment programmes, including regional language transmissions. The problem is that there are thousands of people who would not like to miss their favourite programme on TV or radio for anything, not even for cricket. And they probably do not subscribe to satellite TV (which telecasts DD Sports) ? which is basically an urban phenomenon. 

 What moral right does Doordarshan have to restrict our right to choose programmes? One might argue that the large terrestrial networks of DD and All India Radio have to take care of a 103-crore population. Besides, India has numerous ethnic groups, distinct in culture, dialects and languages. How can the government cater to all?

 What is the alternative? One option could be the ?de-massification? of the media, to ensure the freedom of expression of all ethnic and religious communities. Another solution could be decontrolling the country?s airwaves to allow participation of the private sector ? NGOs, voluntary agencies, educational institutions, communities and so on. 

 By the people

 Community radio or smaller TV stations and newspapers are best suited for this. Besides ethnic groups, environmental pressure groups, political parties and other organizations would find this a convenient medium of expression. Of course, no society could allow each ethnic group to exercise its freedom of choice. Yet, in India, where the airwaves are still the exclusive preserve of the government, it would help to have different channels in the electronic media. Allowing FM broadcasts in the private sector has been a timely move on the part of the government in this context, and most such ventures have been successful so far. 

 A community radio is a medium that is participatory in nature and brings together community members to design, produce and air programmes based on local issues. As no Central authority imposes the programmes, it is culturally closer to the people. The audience is treated as a resource, not as mere consumers of branded products in the guise of programme software. 

 Success stories

 The example of the successful Kheda communication project, initiated several decades ago in Gujarat, can be cited here. A small TV transmitter had been set up on an experimental basis for a year for a target audience and all the programmes aired had been designed and produced by the local people. The project became so popular that it was continued beyond the experimental year. 

 In a country where the freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed by the Constitution, why does the state hesitate to decontrol electronic media? Yet this alone would enable groups with certain missions to propagate their views. The Central government has strong regulations which do not allow establishing private radio or TV transmitters. Any organization that is interested in transmission has to do it through the existing transmitters belonging to Prasar Bharati. And the latter is often unwilling to concede prime time to private parties. 

 Nevertheless, voluntary organizations have been successfully working in this direction for several years now. These include the Deccan Development Society, VOICES, Ramana Maharishi Academy for the Blind, Kutch Mahila Vikas Sangathan and Alternative for Indian Development.

 Community radio possesses great potential in a country where ?participatory? and ?social responsibility? roles of the mass media are still relevant. The small-scale media needs to be encouraged more.

 Nobody?s children

The Juvenile Justice System in India:

From Welfare to Rights

By Ved Kumari, 

Oxford, Rs 625

The Constitution of India recognizes the special status 

of children through articles such as 15(3), 24, 45, and so on. The National Policy 

for Children, adopted in 1974, also declares children as one of the most important 

national assets. And in tune with the constitutional directions, laws have been 

enacted to cover matters such as adoption guardianship, labour, education, delinquency 

and flesh trade. However, despite the constitutional vision of a healthy and happy 

child, protected against abuse and exploitation, majority of Indian children continue 

to live without a childhood. It is worse for juveniles facing the law enforcement 

machinery. Ved Kumari critically examines the working of the juvenile justice 

system in India as it exists today.

 The concept of juvenile justice was derived from the idea that juvenile delinquency and problems of youth in abnormal situations are not amenable to resolution within the framework of conventional criminal law. The juvenile justice system, therefore, is not only designed to respond to the needs of young offenders, but also to provide specialized and preventive treatment services for children and young persons as means of ?secondary prevention?, rehabilitation, and improved socialization. While examining the historical development of the JJS in India, Ved Kumari argues that the timing and content of the developments have a close relationship with the reforms taking place elsewhere in the world rather than with the demands of the children in the country. The JJS in India, owing its origin to British rule, also witnessed a policy shift from ?welfare? to ?rights?.

 While analysing the legislative processes relating to juvenile justice, Kumari shows that there is a marked difference in policy and enforcement. Moreover, till date the Central government has failed to enact a uniform law on juvenile delinquency for the whole country. The judicial processes are marked by tension between the protective approach of the Juvenile Justice Act and the traditional approach to dealing with crime. While the higher courts in most cases promote the care-and-protection philosophy of the JJS, there is very little awareness in the lower judiciary about the procedural differences between the trials of accused adults and children. Kumari asserts that the judicial process does not reflect the need for training and sensitizing the lower judiciary to the problems of children. 

 The central argument of this book is that only piecemeal measures are taken for the care and welfare of delinquent and neglected juveniles. And such measures are bound to go awry in the absence of a holistic approach to the problem of juvenile social maladjustment. Studies show that children committing crimes, as well as those taken charge of in order to prevent crimes, are not given proper care. The institutions and the case-work services are inadequate in terms of diagnosis, counselling, and planning of rehabilitation. Many institutions do not have vocational training programmes. The correctional institutions do not equip children with necessary skills for them to take care of themselves after they are released, and the main socializing agents ? the caretakers ? are ill-paid, ill-qualified and ill-informed. The three main components of the JJS ? law enforcement, adjudication, and correction ? operate haphazardly at best. Lack of coordination and of autonomy of component parts lead to an inadequate utilization of resources, thus impeding the process of justice. 

 Based on published primary sources, Ved Kumari?s work is a comprehensive macro-level study of the historical, legislative, executive, and judicial processes relating to juvenile justice in India. The book is a must-read for child-welfare agencies and NGOs as well as policy-makers, officials and educationists.

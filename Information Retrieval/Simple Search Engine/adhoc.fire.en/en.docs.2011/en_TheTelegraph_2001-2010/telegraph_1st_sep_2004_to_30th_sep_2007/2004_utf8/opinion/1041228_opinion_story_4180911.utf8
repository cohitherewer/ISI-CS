 MORE OF THE SAME YEAR AFTER YEAR

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 Baba cakes, hot chocolate and long queues on Christmas Day 

 Going out to get some pastries when one feels like devouring them does not need careful planning, does it? Ideally, no. But come the Yuletide season, one needs to factor in the supply side of the cake story, given the Calcuttans? fetish for having a slice of the ritual ?Boro diner? cake.

 Smitten by the festive cheer and having decided that there was no better way to lift our sagging spirits (try working on a day when the rest of the world is partying), a colleague and I decided to hop across to a well-known confectioner on Park Street to get the goodies and celebrate at work. 

 But a ghastly sight awaited us. Now a queue is not something that one associates with that dear old cake shop (at least not as usually as one does with Sree Leathers). But the queue was there ? and that dear old cake shop had been transformed into the PYT stuff. A rather nice-looking young man in a suit was going crazy guarding the doors, through which primary, secondary and tertiary queues were vying to get in. We finally reached the head of the queue only to be told that we were in the line for reserving tables in the shop and that the takeaway queue was a separate one. Sheer brand loyalty saw us through the ridiculousness of changing queues and starting from scratch. A street urchin meanwhile cashed in on the situation by dolefully asking the impatient queuers to buy some of his imported chewing gum. 

 There was also an interesting exchange between our handsome guard and a customer. The latter was trying to sell his idea of letting in people only for a fixed time and then ushering them out. It was a good thing that he was politely snubbed. Imagine timing your purchase to avoid being led to the door ignominiously! 

 It wasn?t a very pleasant feeling to be inside though ? what with scores of eyes watching your movements through the glass panes and pleading silently that you ?get the hell out? of there. The more serious-looking seemed to be calculating the probability of their getting into the shop and getting what they wanted. The answer to the latter was tending to zero with every passing second. Which is why one attendant suggested that we buy the ?baba? cakes to fill in the shortfall in our order.

 I did ask why on earth they were called so ? but the glare I got in return only reinforced my disinclination to know any more about the puny cakes. I gave up on the baba, just as I had given up trying to fathom why nearly everybody had to make such a fuss about sipping their hot chocolates and eating their cakes in situ on XMas day. After all, 90 per cent of the same crowd do the disappearing act for most of the other days that are not Christmas. 

 Buying the cakes was an ordeal alright ? with wrong bills and pretty packets whose pink handles gave away the moment you lifted them off the counter, and more so with having to make yourself heard over the sudden spurts of carols being sung to the accompaniment of a synthesizer. Perhaps they could sing to the people in the queue next time, for they definitely looked as if they could do with some entertainment.

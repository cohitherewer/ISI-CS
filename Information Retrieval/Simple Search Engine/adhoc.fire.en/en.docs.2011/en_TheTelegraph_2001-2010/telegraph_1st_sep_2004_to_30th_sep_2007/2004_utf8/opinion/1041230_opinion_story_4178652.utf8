 Letters to Editor

 Monumental lapse

 Sir ? Taj Mahal will never cease to be the target of human depredations ? be it industrial pollutants, Rs 175 crore scams by politicians (which seems to have been averted, but only just) or moonlight rendezvous which will obviously entail much more than a simple view of the monument. It obviously takes much less to walk in and do yoga ? as Vikram Chowdhary and his students demonstrated (?Yoga by Taj? Not impossible?, Dec 28). What surprises is how was this circus, replete with furiously clicking cameras and spectators, allowed to continue for more than two hours with no intervention or investigation from the authorities. Chowdhary, contemptible as his actions are, has actually proved to us that neither the Central Industrial Security Force nor the Archaeological Survey of India are up to the task of being entrusted with the monument?s maintenance and security. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Mandal, Calcutta

 House-keeping

 Sir ? Though not entirely unknown, the fact that not more than five per cent of the total members in both the houses of parliament bother to participate in its proceedings came as a surprise (?Nostrum for parliament??, Dec 24). And, as Ashok Mitra points out, the main reason is the members? lack of knowledge of and their inability to speak in either Hindi or English. This is a pity, especially considering that the members are elected from their constituencies by the people in the hope that their problems and demands will be heard. Besides, a lot of money is spent on these elected members by the government. If they are forced to remain tongue-tied, what purpose will they serve? 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? There seems to be a paradigm shift in Ashok Mitra?s usual stand on computers and the onslaught of information technology. How else can one explain his honest suggestion that IT facilities be availed of to improve the working of parliament by helping non-English- and Hindi-speaking MPs overcome the drudgery of the sessions? A passing thought. Given that he is so disdainful of the software revolution, why does he forget that he uses one of crucial components of the revolution to write his fortnightly criticisms against job losses arising out of the induction of computers? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? A nation which does not dither in spending considerably on developing its nuclear facilities, missions to the moon or on defence, should not have any problems in adopting the technology (as in the United Nations) by virtue of which parliamentarians can speak in their respective mother tongues and have their speeches translated simultaneously to the other Indian languages. Moreover, only the languages listed in the Eighth Schedule need not be given all the importance. For, if a Kurmi, Bodo or Balti representative from Jharkhand, Assam or Jammu and Kashmir respectively wants to speak and be heard in parliament, arrangements should be accommodated accordingly.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 Sir ? It will be wonderful if we can really use information technology, as Mitra has suggested, for translating house proceedings for the benefit of all of its members. That will take some more time. But till that is worked out, can it not be ensured that all parliamentarians be polite or patient enough to listen out their counterparts speaking in their mother tongue? 

 Yours faithfully,

Saptarshi Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Is it not absurd that parliamentarians have to speak only in Hindi or English? And that those who choose to converse in their mother-tongue will have to notify the presiding officer well in advance to have arrangements made for translators? Does this not hamper their participation?

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The parliament is no longer graced by the presence of statesmen like Jawaharlal Nehru, B.R. Ambedkar and Hiren Mukherjee. But what adds colour is the presence of members with a variety of backgrounds ? film stars, industrialists, as well as criminals. 

 For these people, participating responsibly in the running of a government is understandably an alien task and far more difficult than pulling the trigger of a gun or signing contracts in business houses or delivering film dialogues. Almost all of them have achieved the status of an MP or MLA not as a result of their genuine concern for politics, but simply by cashing in on their popularity and financial status. Take the example of Navjot Singh Sidhu. One does not associate him with anything other than using the willow against the ball, and, more recently, making people laugh with his ?Sidhuisms?. How does he aspire to become a seasoned politician? 

 It is a similar story for Dharmendra and Dara Singh. This is not to undermine or underestimate them, but given the current circumstances, India could really do with a leader who can who can revolutionize politics with his thinking. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

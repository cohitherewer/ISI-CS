 AFTER DOLLAR DREAMS, THE NIGHTMARES

 Alok Ray fears that unless the US government mends its profligate ways, a global currency crisis, brought about by a fall in the value of the dollar, may be in the offing 

 Buy until you drop

 Chairmen of the US Federal Reserve are highly responsible, patriotic people. They do not cry wolf, unless they see one. Recently, Paul Volcker, the predecessor of Alan Greenspan (the current chairman), said that he thought there was a 75 per cent chance that a currency crisis would develop in the United States of America in the next five years. Greenspan, too, has expressed concern about the future of the dollar, unless the US?s huge budget deficit and current account deficit are brought under control. 

 This year, the US budget deficit is projected to be around $430 billion. With George W. Bush returning to power, more tax cuts and an increase in spending on the war against terror and domestic security are likely to follow, pushing it further up. The US?s current account deficit is more than $570 billion ? around 6 per cent of its gross domestic product. For most countries, 2 per cent is considered the danger mark. 

 Yet, the main reason the dollar has not yet plummeted is that the central banks of countries like Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea have stopped their currencies from appreciating by buying up excess dollars from the market and adding these to their foreign exchange reserves. This intervention has created an additional demand for the dollar which has kept its value artificially high.

 Further, a large part of the forex reserves of Asian countries is invested in US government securities. This inflow of foreign money has kept interest rates low in the US, despite the government borrowing massively to finance its budget deficit. 

 American consumers are able to maintain their high standard of living by buying foreign goods cheaply, since the value of the dollar is artificially propped up. They are also able to finance their consumption by borrowing cheaply. The Asian governments do not mind this arrangement since it enables them to sell goods to Americans, which creates jobs and adds to their income.

 What would happen if the dollar were not artificially propped up? Look at the dollar-euro exchange rate, which is mostly determined by market forces. The euro has appreciated by more than 50 per cent in the last three years. Some argue that the dollar would have depreciated less against the euro if the Asian nations, with their massive trade surpluses, had allowed their currencies to appreciate against the dollar. At present, the burden of adjustment for the rapidly rising US current account deficit falls mainly on the euro-dollar exchange rate.

 This situation is unlikely to continue indefinitely. For one, Asian countries like South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand have been rebuilding their reserves since 1998. They lost a large part of their reserves in the Asian meltdown of the Nineties when they tried to maintain the value of their currencies and arrest the flight of capital by selling forex. Eventually, their currencies fell and they lost their reserves. So, once they have a prudent level of reserves, they will not want to buy dollars any more. Any slackening in the current pace of addition to the dollar reserves by these countries would mean a fall of the dollar against their currencies.

 Two, the key to reversing the current trend lies with China. The Chinese government?s policy of maintaining a fixed exchange rate between the yuan and the dollar by continuously buying up dollars from the market is adding to the domestic money supply and fuelling investment expenditure by banks at low rates of interest. This is leading to an ?overheating? of the economy, which has already started feeling inflationary pressures. 

 The Chinese government is under increasing pressure from Western countries to revalue the yuan against the dollar. The Chinese have resisted so far. A higher value of the yuan may slow down the growth of Chinese exports, thus blunting one source of excessive demand leading to overinvestment and inflation. 

 As the inflationary cost of maintaining a peg to the dollar increases, Beijing may decide to revalue the yuan. In fact, China has raised interest rates for the first time in many years. If China revalues further, other Asian countries, whose major concern is competition from cheap Chinese goods, may follow suit since they can then afford to let their currencies be more market determined.

 Unlike in the past, there are now good alternatives to the dollar as a reserve asset. So, as expectations that the dollar will fall heighten, all investors ? foreign central banks as well as US private investors ? will switch from the dollar to the euro or yen or yuan. 

 Analysts estimate that if the US continues with its current profligate policies, the dollar may need to fall between 20 to 40 per cent against major currencies in order to correct its balance of payments problem. And the sooner it mends its ways, the softer would be the fall of the dollar.

 China may soon find it in its self-interest to let the yuan rise against the dollar. But the case for Japan letting the yen appreciate is not so clear. The interest rate in the US is low (below 2 per cent) but it is still higher than the near-zero interest rate in Japan. So, borrowing from the domestic market and then using yen funds to buy dollars from the market and investing them in US government securities is still profitable for the Japanese central bank. If it increases money supply and inflation, it is also good for the Japanese economy which is suffering from falling prices. Moreover, a cheap yen is good for Japanese exports. Consequently, Japan may drag its feet in letting the yen rise against the dollar, unless the US and Europe put sufficient political pressure on Japan.

 But why should the rest of the world bother about the dollar?s fall? Well, simply because the biggest loser if the dollar falls would be the rest of the world, which holds a large part of its forex reserves in dollars. For the US ? the biggest debtor in the world ? debts are denominated in dollars. So, a dollar devaluation would mean that when the US repays its debt in dollars, the lender nations would get back less in terms of purchasing power over goods and other currencies. In a sense, the US would be defaulting on a part of its debt by stealth. The rest of the world would then end up paying the price of the US living beyond its means.

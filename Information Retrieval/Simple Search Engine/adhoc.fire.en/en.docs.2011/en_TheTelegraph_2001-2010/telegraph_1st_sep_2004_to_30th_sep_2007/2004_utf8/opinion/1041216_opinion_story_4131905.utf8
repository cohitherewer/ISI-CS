 NO COPPING OUT

 Responsibilities are common, as well as differentiated. And a fair division of these responsibilities is the main agenda at the 10th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, finishing in Buenos Aires tomorrow. COP 10 is important for the world, and for India. First, global temperature and the sea level are rising alarmingly, largely owing to the greenhouse effect, for which human beings are entirely responsible. But the greatest responsibility has to be borne by the wealthy, industrially advanced, developed nations. The United States of America remains the world?s greatest polluter, followed by China. India, together with countries like Brazil, although a developing nation, has been contributing to climate change in a major way by burning fossil fuels and releasing methane through livestock and rice paddies. Yet poor countries cannot afford to cut down emission at the expense of development. COP 10 will help by spelling out in practical, equitable and sustainable terms what needs to be done and by whom. Second, now that Russia has ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the Protocol will become legally binding on the parties from February 16, 2005. The US has notoriously held out against ratifying for its own economic interests. (Australia, Monaco and Liechtenstein have also not ratified.) COP 10 will therefore give the countries under the Protocol a crucial opportunity to put pressure on the US to declare its commitments.

 Paradoxically, the complex free-market mechanism by which the US has been evading commitment is also a legal, practical and global solution to the problems of mitigating and adapting to climate change. Through carbon-trading, countries which cut emissions below their agreed targets sell the excess as credits to countries that still have some way to go. European countries favour a tax to make it harder for rich nations to buy permits abroad to avoid making cuts at home. But the US has argued that emissions-trading should operate under free-market principles, and wants voluntary commitments from developing countries. This has been resisted by India, China and a few others. Buenos Aires will therefore have to be the place where developing countries like India will have to get the developed ones to support their adaptation activities from bodies constituted by the UN like the Global Environment Facility, which now has around $100 million for precisely such a purpose.

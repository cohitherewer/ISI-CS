 BEFORE ALL IS LOST

 Shobita Punja

 It was in the 19th century that a new interest in antiquarianism grew in Europe and pervaded the life and thoughts of great men of letters like Sir Walter Scott and John Ruskin. In the 1840s, Ruskin introduced the idea of ?trusteeship? for ?heritage?. In his book, Lamp of Memory, he writes that ? ?old buildings are not ours, but belong partly to those who built them and partly to all the generations of mankind who are to follow us?. William Morris translated Ruskin?s ideas into action with the foundation of the Society for Protection of Ancient Buildings in 1877.

 The idea of trusteeship suggests that ancient buildings bear witness to a time past, a history of people and communities that preceded us, and also introduces the idea that we are obliged to protect these witnesses for generations that will follow us. To assume our role as trustees of the past requires first a magnanimous sense of ownership ? that we are caretakers, not owners, of the natural, cultural and living heritage of this land. 

 Trustees of the past

 We need government policies that reflect the political will of this nation to hold the beauty of this country in trust for the future, to realize that the feeble remains of our forests, wildlife parks and heritage sites are but the last remaining clues to the wonder that was India. We need the government-protected heritage areas to draw a policy of community participation and involvement so that people feel that these treasures belong to them and are not government property. 

 This would require a major mind-shift for, since Nehru?s times, public property, ASI buildings and national parks are seen by many to ?belong? to the government, not as public areas held and cared for by the government in trust for the people. People think nothing of writing their name on the seat of a public bus or on a thousand-year-old monument for there is no sense that this bus or building ?belongs to me?. The subtlety of the idea is that it not only belongs to just me, but to us, and it is ours to give to others to enjoy even when we are dead and gone. This mind-shift requires a certain kind of education and a different mindset ? something that does not appear to be prevalent in schools today.

 Start at home

 This sort of education cannot be taught out of textbooks but requires practice in living. Values of truth, kindness, caring for what is yours and what belongs to others require practical experience. You cannot teach truthfulness or ?not to tell a lie? through a textbook, you need to be in a situation where a lie is possible and then choose not to lie and tell the truth, whatever the consequence. Such education needs to start at home, at the school and college level and reach every citizen of this country. A sense of caring without ownership, a sense of concern with no right to the property, compassion with detachment ? this should be easy to Indians who understand this philosophy. So why isn?t it happening? 

 We need to begin by drawing the cognoscenti and the educated caring ones to express their outrage when heritage is damaged, when their cites are ruined by unplanned development and careless planning. We need articulate people to engage in discussions on whether the government has a right to run a road through a fragile forest, to block the corridor that wild elephants take on their annual migrations, the right to tear down ?our? old handsome GPO and build an uninspiring structure, or to deny the rights of tribal communities to perform their rituals. We need heroes and heroines to stake their claim, to embrace the rivers and mountains, cultures and communities and to reclaim what is ours by right. Things are changing, but we need the whisper to become a shout, before all is lost.

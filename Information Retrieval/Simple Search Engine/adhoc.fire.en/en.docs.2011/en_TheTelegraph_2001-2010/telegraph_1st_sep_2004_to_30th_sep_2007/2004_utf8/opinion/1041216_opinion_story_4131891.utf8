 MISSED TARGETS

 Missed fiscal targets are most of the time results of poor discipline and inefficient management. It is clear from the mid-year review presented by Mr P. Chidambaram that the finance ministry will be unable to meet the annual targets on deficit reduction. The principal concern is with the revenue deficit which in September stood at 79 per cent of the budget estimate, whereas the target had been fixed at 45 per cent. The fiscal deficit at 39 per cent of the budget estimate was below the target of 45 per cent. But for this no credit accrues to the finance ministry because this reflects the accounting benefits that the Central government receives from states exchanging their high-cost loans. If the apparent brightness of the fiscal deficit is thus explained, the poor performance on the revenue deficit front is explained by low growth of revenue in excise, customs and corporate income taxes. The first two items have grown by only nine per cent over the first half of last year and corporate income taxes by a mere seven per cent over the same period. These figures in no way reflect overall macroeconomic indicators. Manufacturing grew by eight per cent in real terms. Imports grew by 34 per cent and more between April and September 2004: this is in no way reflected in the nine per cent growth in customs duties. The growth in corporate income tax is also not in consonance with corporate profitability. Mr Chidambaram held out the promise of streamlining tax collection and administration but his own mid-year review suggests that much still remains to be done in this sphere.

 One big reason for fiscal indiscipline in India is the overwhelming presence of subsidies. Both the mid-year review and the Economic Survey noted this point. Without gainsaying the importance of this point, it must be admitted that the poor revenue compliance is at odds with the overall sense of optimism that pervades the entire economy. The review itself articulates this optimism. This optimism is by no means misplaced. This is precisely what makes the fiscal slippages so disturbing. Mr Chidambaram?s reputation is of a minister who has no time for either indiscipline or inefficiency. It can only be hoped that he will clear the weeds in his own garden. Otherwise, they will hold back economic reforms.

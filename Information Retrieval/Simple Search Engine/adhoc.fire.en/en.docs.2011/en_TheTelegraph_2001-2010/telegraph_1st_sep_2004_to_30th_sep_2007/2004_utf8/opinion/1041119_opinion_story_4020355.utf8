 DIFFERENT TOUCH 

 A different approach may sometimes signal hope. The visit of the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, to Kashmir seems to hold the promise of difference. It is not just the package of Rs 24,000 crore, intended for development and economic healing of the state, that is striking. It is also the quality and value that he has made to inhere in the concept of peace ? or, expanded, ?peace with dignity? ? that suggest a difference of vision. The prime minister?s recent promise of reducing troops in Kashmir began to be fulfilled on the day of his visit, a low-key touch of drama which could help reinforce the sense of his sincerity. Most important, his focus is the people of Kashmir, and in his speech at the rally this was the point he made with almost emotional emphasis. In talking of a ?new? Kashmir, he was also suggesting new and unknown roads to it: he would talk to anyone who abjured violence, and peace in Kashmir could be worked for even before a conclusion was reached in the dialogue with Pakistan.

 It is too early to say if the psychological moment for this approach is exactly right, for the Kashmiri people are tired of violence and tired of promises from New Delhi. But the gentle disentangling of the issue of disagreement with Pakistan from the sufferings of the people in Kashmir is noticeable, as is the steady condemnation of violence. This is an edge a little sharper than a razor?s, because Mr Singh has reiterated in Kashmir his earlier position on talks with Pakistan. He has made clear that Mr Pervez Musharraf?s recent suggestions about resolving the Kashmir issue have not changed India?s stand, that is, no redrawing of international boundaries and no further division on the basis of religion. Exactly how sharp the edge is was obvious during his visit. Not only had the hardline Hurriyat group, supported by the United Jihad Council, a platform of 15 militant organizations, called a strike in Srinagar, but also, far more dangerously, two extremists were discovered and killed after a three-hour gunfight some little distance away from the rally venue. There are, inevitably, questions about the reduction of troops. How much closer to normalcy is Kashmir as far as militant strikes are concerned? And can Pakistan, even with the best of intentions, stop all militant activity? No answer can be simple. Mr Singh?s approach, if followed up consistently, might bring forth some answers.

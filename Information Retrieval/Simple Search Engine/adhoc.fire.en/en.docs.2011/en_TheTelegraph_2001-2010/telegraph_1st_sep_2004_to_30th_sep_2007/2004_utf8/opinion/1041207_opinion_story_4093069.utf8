 FESTIVAL AMID THE RUINS

 MALVIKA SINGH

 A wonderfully sunny, early-winterish December morning in Delhi was the setting that launched the Old World Theatre Festival supported by Mahindra and Mahindra. The lawns of the Habitat Centre in Delhi were scattered with rose and marigold petals, orange and pink banners fluttering in the breeze. This year, M.S. Sathyu, Satyadev Dubey, Makrand Deshpande and Mahesh Dattani are on stage along with collegiate productions, all of which have been sponsored by the organizers. It was Anand Mahindra and Rohit Khattar of Old World Hospitality who saw the empty space crying out for some theatrical activity in Delhi. Today, this festival has become a regular yearly event.

 As a young man, Anand Mahindra would have liked to become a documentary filmmaker when he returned to India from the US. Instead, he is the vice chairman and managing director of Mahindra and Mahindra. But, he has always been drawn to the arts and since he is in a position today to spur on and sponsor such activity, he has done so. He has put his money where his heart is. If only more and more successful corporates would look seriously at participating in the larger cultural aspects of this country, ranging from museums to conservation activity, to supporting theatre and film, to encouraging new publishing, to sponsoring the special skills of India, we would have an edge in the world that other countries would find difficult to match. Money and resource are essential for the development of these strengths. Government patronage must give way to private-sector initiatives.

 Time to change

 Star Television too has been sponsoring a play here and a recital there, which makes for a beginning. It would be wonderful if they supported a Festival of India in Delhi every year, one that could bring shows of music, dance and theatre, every day for six days, exhibitions of archival and contemporary photography, contemporary art, the best of the Indian crafts of textiles (Bidri, for example) or anything else that captures the imagination. It could make for interesting programmes on the TV channel as well. There are many spectacular open-air venues in Delhi amidst ruins, gardens and fort-walls. These should be brought to life with care, as it is done everywhere in Europe. Money is often generated from such shows for the conservation of the monuments or parkland. Delhi desperately needs a high-calibre ?festival? to showcase the best, much like the arts festivals in Edinburgh and Avignon that are internationally famed.

 Our politics has become so sordid, parochial and regressive, and our administration, across the country, inept, corrupt and unable to deliver the basics. To counterpoint that reality, we ought to project and endorse the positive and lively aspects of Indian culture. As we move away from our dependence on the bureaucracy and government, our lives will improve qualitatively. We must energize those in the private domain, and enlightened leadership should encourage and assist such individuals and groups. Government should get on with doing its primary job ? running the villages and cities, providing basic infrastructure, maintaining law and order. They have failed so far, and they must now deliver.

 Countries that were worse off than us have got their act together. South-east Asian nations have lifted their people out of their abject poverty. We have been left far behind. Figures may show development and change, but on the ground life gets more impossible with every passing day. Cities wallow in filth, villages are neglected, water and electricity are in a mess. At another level, we have more than most going for us without the infrastructure. We will never be able to capitalize on the myriad strengths of this subcontinent, mutilated by corruption and exploitation. Time to change!

 DRESSED DOWN

 It must be a strange experience to get beaten up by one?s colleagues for what one has chosen to wear to work. And that too, with umbrellas. (Such an experience is likely to be strange in the way it combines the infuriating and the comically absurd.) Yet this is precisely what Ms Aparna Sarkar allegedly had to put up with in a district girls? school in West Bengal. She had started coming to teach in a salwar-kameez, instead of a sari, for which the school authorities had prevented her from signing the register and stopped her salary for a couple of months. The managing committee has now unanimously resolved to prevent her from signing the register if she refuses to wear a sari, and when she still insisted on signing, in a salwar-kameez, two of her colleagues allegedly used their umbrellas on her. They were both women of some seniority, like the head of the school, who feels quite as strongly that Ms Sarkar could jolly well come in a sari if that happened to be the school?s ?norm?. This is after the government has directed all state-aided schools to allow their teachers to wear the salwar-kameez. Ms Sarkar teaches in a girls? school. So, presumably, the norm exists to set the girls a good example, and not to protect the students from titillation or corruption by provocatively or outlandishly clad teachers.

 Sartorial regulation remains a way of oppressing women, especially working women, in public or institutional space. This is perpetuated not only by powerfully moralistic men, but also by other women. An unsavoury mix of envy, malice, prejudice and conservatism passes here as pro-priety or morality. Ms Sarkar?s experience, and that of another teacher a few months ago in a Chakdaha college, have been extreme enough to attract the attention of the media. But less extreme, yet no less irritating, expressions of such ?disapproval? must be common in many schools in the city and districts. Many teachers and heads of school, of either sex, had objected to the liberal thrust of the government?s circular, behind which was the state women?s commission?s firm assertion that what women wear to work is entirely a matter of their own choice, based on convenience, comfort and discretion. It is demeaning for women to have to waste their time and energy protesting against such a mindless form of puritanism. But they cannot afford to give up.

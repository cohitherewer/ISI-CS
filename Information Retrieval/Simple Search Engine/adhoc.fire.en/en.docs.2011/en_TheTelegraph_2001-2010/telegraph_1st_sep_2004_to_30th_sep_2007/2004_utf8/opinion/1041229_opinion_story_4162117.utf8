 Letters to Editor

 Without generosity

 Sir ? The trip to Iraq on Christmas eve is unlikely to salvage the tarnished image of the defence secretary of the United States of America, Donald Rumsfeld (?Rumsfeld boosts morale in surprise visit to Iraq?, Dec 25). The few hours spent with the soldiers is just an attempt to show his ?softer side?. But if his machine signatures on letters sent to families of dead soldiers are anything to go by, it is obvious that Rumsfeld harbours no genuine feelings for his marines. The opinion polls plainly show that most Americans are even less convinced of a ?feeling? Rumsfeld. The defence secretary acknowledges that much ?depends? on recruitment and training of US troops. But what about improving the equipment provided to US soldiers in Iraq or increasing awareness of the soldiers? contribution to the ?sweep of human history? at home? Why will they continue to die, desperate and unsung?

 Yours faithfully,

Payal Banerjee, Calcutta

 Take it easy

 Sir ? The report, ?Laloo?s cash show draws EC lash? (Dec 21), shows how good Laloo Prasad Yadav is at capturing and retaining the limelight. He has done it earlier and this time, too, he could hardly have been unaware that charity, after the election date had been declared by the Election Commission, would be regarded as a cognisable offence. But people always remember the law-breaker more than the one who abides by it. Witness the undying popularity of Veerappan, Phoolan Devi and other underworld dons. Laloo Yadav is obviously aware of mass psychology and exploits it to the hilt. The more rigid the EC is in cracking its whip, the better the result for the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief. The tiff with the EC will allow him to draw more sympathy from his voters on the eve of the assembly elections. 

 Yours faithfully,

Debyani Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? Laloo Yadav exemplifies the political evils that demand urgent reforms. There was first the infamous ?chaara? scandal, then the shameless display of wealth and extortion during Misa?s wedding, the kidnappings that forced the law courts to pass strictures against the RJD state government and now the distribution of money to voters. These are sufficient proof that the RJD runs a jungle raj in Bihar. Only drastic reforms in the system can check the Bihar-virus from spreading elsewhere in the country. The remedy lies in restricting voting rights to those with two children, persuading the intelligentsia to contest elections and preventing politics from becoming a family business.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? When Laloo Yadav was taken to Beur Jail, he put his wife in the chief minister?s chair. We thought things in Bihar had reached its nadir. We were wrong. Laloo Yadav has yet to reach his limits. By doling out Rs 100 notes to Dalits in front of the camera and assuring free train-rides, he has mocked Indian democracy. When will the EC take some concrete action against him?

 Yours faithfully,

Arunava Choudhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? Instead of admitting that he has violated EC regulations, Laloo Yadav continues to argue that he has done nothing wrong in giving money to Dalits. If he were genuinely concerned about the poor, he should have launched programmes and policies to improve their condition ? something he has failed to do ? instead of increasing his own wealth. Together with Shibu Soren, the Laloo Yadav episode is a blot on the UPA government. The Congress should rethink its alliance with the RJD in Bihar.

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

 Sir ? First it was Lalji Tandon, then Laloo Yadav, and now the Janata Dal (U) leader, George Fernandes (?George caught in Laloo boat?, Dec 26). It is sad to see politicians take undue advantage of the poor. They are given saris, sweets or cash prior to elections as payment for their votes. Politicians do not think twice about violating the code of conduct and the EC cannot do much about it apart from lodging cases against them. It can take no action. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Nazia Sultana, Gaya

 Tripped up

 Sir ? The chief minister is given to making tall statements about all that is being done to encourage tourism in the state. But is the state tourism department up to the task? We had booked a two-day trip to the Sunderbans for December 25-26. It included a trip by bus to Basanti, a launch ride to Sajnekhali where we would stay for the night and a visit to two other tiger watch-towers. A simple itinerary that was dogged by delays at every step. But what took the cake was the final bit. A technical fault in the launch delayed us and we reached Basanti at 5 in the evening (instead of 3.00), to find that the bus that should have taken us back to Calcutta had left. There were children among us, some had to go to work the following day, so we had no option but to persuade a private bus to take us back. All?s well, some may say, except that our fellow passenger, a female foreinger, must surely have failed to catch her 8.35 train to Benares.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Gupta, Calcutta

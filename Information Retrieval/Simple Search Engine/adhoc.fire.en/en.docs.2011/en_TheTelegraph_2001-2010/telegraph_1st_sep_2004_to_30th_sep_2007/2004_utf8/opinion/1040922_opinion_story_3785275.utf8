 FOR A SONG

 Patriotic zeal could be a terrible waste of time. In India, the national flag and anthem continually cause controversies of varying degrees of pettiness or banality. The cumulative effect is not only of wasted public resources, but also of a sad trivialization of the country?s political culture itself ? democracy reduced to mindless, or mischievous, enthusiasm. Mr Sanjeev Bhatnagar has been gently asked by the Supreme Court to wonder if he might wish to keep his sentiments about the national anthem to himself. Mr Bhatnagar had taken it upon himself to bring to the court?s notice that the mention of Sindh in the national anthem is an objectionable anachronism. It was not so when Rabindranath Tagore composed the song; but history has moved on, and ?Kashmir? should now replace ?Sindh?, so that Pakistan?s sovereignty is not violated and Indian feelings are not hurt. He has spent a lot of time going into the legalities of such a petition, and feels emboldened by Rajendra Prasad?s declaration that changes in the anthem may be authorized by the government ?as the occasion arises?. The court has suggested that Mr Bhatnagar might bring his feelings to the Centre?s notice.

 But anthem-induced sentiments may not always be quite as innocuously disproportionate as those expressed by Mr Bhatnagar. Mr Narendra Modi had recently whipped up considerable local reaction against a school textbook in Kerala accidentally dropping ?Gujarat? in its printed version of the anthem. This, he felt convinced, was a deliberate insult to his state and its people, and called for an ?intensified agitation?. His counterpart in Kerala has apologized for this ?inadvertent omission?, and one hopes that the matter has been laid to rest. Mr Modi?s patriotism has ensured Gujarat?s place in inventories less illustrious than Tagore?s. Mr Bhatnagar?s emotions are certainly less incendiary than Mr Modi?s. But it is time sensitive Indians learnt to be sensible too.

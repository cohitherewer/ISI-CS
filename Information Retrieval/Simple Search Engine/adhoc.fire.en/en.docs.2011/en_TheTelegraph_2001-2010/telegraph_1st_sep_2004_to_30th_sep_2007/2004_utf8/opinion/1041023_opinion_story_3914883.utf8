 GODDESS IN THE CITY

 In ritual terms, Calcutta?s four days of annual celebration come to an end today. But tomorrow being Sunday, the celebrations might linger on till Sunday evening when most of the images will be immersed. The four days of Durga puja, at the onset of autumn, articulate a most peculiar paradox. In a purely physical and material sense, the city comes to a standstill. Traffic becomes even slower, walking becomes impossible with millions of people out on the streets, and business comes to a halt. But in another sense, the city comes alive. Calcutta, despite its poverty, its deprivation and its lack of certain amenities, is suddenly gripped by a new spirit of joy, gaiety and abandon. Cynics might dismiss these few days as a safety valve Calcutta requires to maintain its equanimity for the rest of the three hundred and sixty one days. But such a view would ignore the zest for enjoyment, the eager wait and the sense of involvement that are visible during the pujas. The Durga puja is a unique social and cultural experience which the people of Calcutta and the rest of West Bengal ? and perhaps wherever there is a cluster of Bengalis ? cherish.

 One aspect of the socio-cultural experience is embodied in the creativity visible in the making of the images and the pandals. At one level ? and this is a relatively new phenomenon ? there is a drive towards novelty. Thus the making of the images with odd things. This year, one puja boasted of an image made from lozenges. Previous years have seen images made from broken gramophone records and other equally unlikely objects. But at another level, there is a visible tendency to reinvent tradition. Artisans not usually connected with the making of images have been employed by some of the puja committees to create Durga and her entourage. This year there was an image made out of dokra work. Previously terracotta has also been used. These are attempts to create a new kind of aesthetics associated with image-making. At yet another level, the pandals and their decorations are innovations in the genre of kitsch.

 Traditionally, Durga puja was celebrated in a temple built within the compound of a wealthy man?s estate. It was a private form of worship with limited social access. The social aspect of the puja was opened up when localities in Calcutta began to organize pujas through public subscriptions. These pujas are not held in a temple but in a public space ? a park or a road ? which is sacralized for the four days. This is a major refashioning of public space. Questions are being raised about this kind of refashioning because pujas now encroach upon public space and thus inconvenience people. Organizers of pujas who block roads to erect their pandals cannot argue that the road belongs only to the residents of the locality. Public worship must show public concern. Greater social awareness can only enrich Calcutta?s four days of euphoria.

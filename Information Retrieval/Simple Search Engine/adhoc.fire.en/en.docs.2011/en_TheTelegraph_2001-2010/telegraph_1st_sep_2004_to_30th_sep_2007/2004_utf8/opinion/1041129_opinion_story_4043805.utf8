 GOING UP IN SMOKE

 Gwynne Dyer

 Somebody had to lead the way, but who would have thought that it would be Bhutan? Last week, the tiny Himalayan kingdom became the first country to ban smoking altogether: indoors, outdoors, on mountain-tops, in the out-house, everywhere. It is now illegal to sell tobacco in any form in Bhutan: individuals caught doing so will pay a $ 210 fine and businesses will lose their licences. But you know that what the Bhutanese government has just created is a smuggling industry.

 The government knows it, too. ?If any foreigner is caught selling tobacco products to Bhutanese nationals, he will be charged with smuggling,? Karma Tshering of the Bhutanese customs told the BBC just after the ban came into effect. ?Tobacco will be treated as contraband.? Like alcohol during the prohibition era in the United States of America, or like ?drugs? during the current wave of moral panic in the world.

 Bhutan?s underworld will start to grow and get rich off the tobacco ban, but it will be some time before outright bans on tobacco in bigger countries create the kind of global bonanza for criminals that the alcohol and ?drug? bans did. 

 Same results

 It is true that tobacco is a bigger health risk than ?drugs?. It?s even greater than the health risk involved in drinking alcohol. But it rarely hurts anybody except the user, so why is it anybody else?s business?

 In public spaces that must be shared, it is everybody?s business: non-smokers have a right to be annoyed by other people?s smoke. But to extend that ban to all indoor public spaces including bars that wish to cater only to smokers and their consenting friends, as New York city did last year, Ireland did this year, and even Poland will probably be doing in five years? time, is simply intolerance fuelled by ideology.

 It?s a relatively small act of intolerance, but more will follow. The Bhutanese, being a bit out of the mainstream, have misread the cultural signals and jumped the gun, but absolute bans on tobacco use even in private are probably no more than five or ten years away in some major jurisdictions. That will, of course, create the same pattern of organized crime and the same huge illegal cash flow that previous bans on alcohol and ?drugs? did. Why would it be any different this time?

 No reason

 The proportion of persistent smokers in the populations of developed countries will probably stabilize in the end in the same 10-15 per cent range as the number of regular ?drug? users in those societies, whether or not there is a ban on tobacco. Smoking rates have been dropping steadily for decades now due to medical fears and social pressures, but an irreducible residue of hopeless addicts and determined rebels will remain in every country no matter what is done. The temptation will be to punish them for their persistence and rationalize it as being ?for their own good.? It is a temptation that should be resisted.

 Preventable deaths happen because of smoking, but also because of speeding . Yet we are not going to fit devices restricting all cars to 60 mph. Societies that have a long cultural commitment to alcohol are probably not going to ban it again, even though alcohol abuse is involved in a large proportion of the cases of domestic violence, street violence, and accidental deaths in those societies. And we are certainly not going to ban junk foods, even though obesity shortens people?s lives.

 Neither what we ban nor what we permit is decided on a rational basis. It is driven by social panic and moralistic propaganda, modified to some extent by traditional prejudices, and decided almost entirely without regard to the real consequences. Tobacco is now shifting into the category of things that may be banned, regardless of the damage done.

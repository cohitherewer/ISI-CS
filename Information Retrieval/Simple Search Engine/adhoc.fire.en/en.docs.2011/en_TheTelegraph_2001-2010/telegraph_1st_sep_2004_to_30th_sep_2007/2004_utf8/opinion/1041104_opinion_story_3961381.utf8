 TWO CHILDREN

 The abuse of power is at the heart of rape. Yet, from the point of view of law, this generalization must be able to accommodate a diverse range of scenarios. And around each such scenario there is usually some form of conscious silence or disavowal. The overlap between rape and juvenile justice legislation ? with its particular forms of inequality, disempowerment and abuse ? has recently been brought to public notice when a 13-year-old schoolboy was arrested for raping a girl of eight in Dhantola, West Bengal. The radically unsettling nature of juvenile crime is further driven home by the boy?s claim that he raped the girl ?because he liked her?. Here are two ?children? who also happen to be a rapist and his victim, belonging to families who know one another. It is significant that the girl?s father?s first instinct was to ?settle? the matter out of court and not go to the police, so as not to expose his daughter to the invasive judicial and evidentiary process. It is even more significant, and remarkable, that the local panchayat chief refused to go in for such a settlement and insisted on a police case. ?Conciliation?, arranged through shalishi courts in the districts and villages, is a common alternative to a police case, and ends up trivializing the offence. To what extent, it may be asked, is the Indian juvenile justice system equipped to deal with child sexual offenders and their juvenile victims? On the other hand, the violent sexual abuse of children by family members, neighbours, teachers or other ?trusted? people is still a matter of evasion or suppression, and this is reflected in the legal definition of rape.

 It is, therefore, crucial that the draft proposal for the redefinition of rape thinks through these areas of darkness relentlessly. Not only should the notion of rape be taken well beyond heterosexual penetrative sex, but the centrality of power in relations between offender and victim should also be thought out in a nuanced manner. The idea of increasing prison terms for sexual assault by public servants becomes meaningful in this context of power and the special accountability that comes with it ? in situations involving custodial rape, for instance. The Supreme Court has expressed its fears that defining rape more broadly might ?result in chaos and confusion and not be in the interest of society?. But there has to be a shift from seeing rape as the violation of female chastity to that of an individual?s dignity or sense of self.

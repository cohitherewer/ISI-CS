 Letters to Editor

 Relatively innocent

 Sir ? Is there any reason to be shocked at the Bombay high court allowing Iqbal Kaskar to contest the elections (?Dawood kin?, Sept 22)? He is only the younger brother of a man with a multi-billion dollar crime network, who allegedly has connections with international terrorist groups; a man wanted in connection with the Mumbai blasts where hundreds were killed. In a country where ?tainted? ministers are dime a dozen, Kaskar is as pure as driven snow ? after all, he is not a criminal, himself.

 Yours faithfully,

R.N. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 

 Intimate problem

 Sir ? Surya Moudgal, who refused to be examined by a male doctor during the mandatory medical tests before recruitment into the Indian army, must realize that the army is still very much of a ?boy?s club? (?Woman fights army on medical tests?, Sept 23). If she got her commission, she would command male soldiers, mostly from rural India where attitudes to women continue to remain chauvinistic. It is only lately that, thanks to the efforts of the army higher-ups, the troops have started accepting women as their bosses. 

 Medical examination is integral not only to recruitment but there are also periodic medical check-ups in the army. Each time Moudgal cannot be examined by a lady since there might not be one around where she is posted, for the first five years at least. Anyway, women everywhere are going to male gynaecologists for pre- and post-natal check-ups and surgeries. Those with scruples, like Moudgal, should learn to accept such things ? unless, of course, someone misbehaves. For such cases, there are forums to seek redressal. Moudgal, especially, should not complain since she has decided to don the uniform of her own will, and in the army, certain procedures cannot be compromised with.

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Sircar, Tezpur

 Sir ? The authorities in the Indian army should learn a lesson from Pakistan where even autopsies on women are not allowed to be carried out by male doctors. They should ensure that in cases where lady doctors are easily available, women should be examined only by the latter. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? One would be right to say that Surya Moudgal was being over-sensitive when she insisted on a male gynaecologist. The army officials who refused her too cannot be blamed ? women soldiers cannot afford to have too delicate sensibilities. But what is difficult to condone is the rudeness of the male doctors. Why couldn?t they merely mark a negative against Moudgal and let it go at that. But no, they had to make sarcastic and sexist comments like, ?The doctor will only see and not touch.? That is precisely why Moudgal is so incensed at the Indian army. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shubhra Sen, Ranchi

 Among brothers

 Sir ? The report, ?Poll bell tolls for Punjabee Bradree? (Sept 21), in the Metro section of The Telegraph has hurt a lot of seniors and elderly members of the community who have contributed towards the progress of the Bradree. The report?s description of one camp contesting the election as ?rebel? does not justify the purpose for which the Bradree was formed. This is an election to serve the community and and not about the rivalry between the BJP and the Congress, as mentioned. Several members of the community are directly or indirectly supporting our mission to restore brotherhood and love, for which the Punjabee Bradree was formed.

 Yours faithfully,

Kapil Katyal and two others, Calcutta

 NO WINS OR LOSSES

 Gwynne Dyer

 With the right policies, this is a war we can win, this is a war we must win, and this is a war we will win, said Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry, in Tennessee on August 31. The war on terrorism is absolutely winnable, repeated his vice-presidential running mate, senator John Edwards. That is utter drivel, and they must privately know it, but truth generally loses to calculated lies in politics.

 This outburst was prompted by president George W. Bushs brief brush with the truth about terrorism the previous weekend, when he told an interviewer that he did not really think you can win the war on terror, but that conditions could be changed in ways that would make terrorists less acceptable in certain parts of the world. For a moment there, you glimpsed a functioning intellect at work. Such honesty rarely goes unpunished in politics.

 This heroic attempt to grapple with reality was a welcome departure from Bushs usual style I have a clear vision of how to win the war on terror and bring peace to the world, he was claiming recently and so his opponents pounced on it at once. What if President Reagan had said that it may be difficult to win the war against Communism? asked John Edwards, in one of the least credible displays of indignation in American history.

 Useful rhetoric

 Bush promptly fled back to the safe terrain of hypocrisy and patriotic lies. We meet today in a time of war for our country, a war we did not start, yet one that we will win, he told a veterans conference in Nashville on September 1. But it is not a time of war for America, and it cannot win.

 Some 140,000 American soldiers are trapped in a neo-colonial war in Iraq (where there were no terrorists until the US invasion), but their casualties are typical of colonial wars: fewer than one per cent killed a year. As for the three hundred million Americans at home, exactly as many of them have been killed by terrorists since 9/11 as have been killed by the Creature from the Black Lagoon in the same period. None. 

 The rhetoric of a war on terror has been useful to the Bush administration, and terrorism now bulks inordinately large in any media. On the front page of the International Herald Tribune, that carried the story on Bushs return to political orthodoxy on terrorism, four of the other five stories were also about terrorism.

 Ghost war

 In other words, 36 of the quarter-million people who died on this planet on August 31 were killed by terrorists: close to one in eight thousand. No wonder the IHT headlined its front page A Deadly Day of Terror. Although it would have been on firmer statistical ground if it had substituted the headline A Deadly Day for Swimming.

 Bush spoke the truth, when he said that the war on terror cannot be won. It cannot be won or lost, because it is only a metaphor, not an actual war. It is like the war on crime, nobody ever expected that the war on crime would one day end in a surrender ceremony where all the criminals come out with their hands up, and afterwards there is no more crime. It is a statistical operation, and success is measured by how successful you are in getting the crime rate down. Same goes for terrorism.

 You could do worse than to listen to Stella Rimington, the former director of MI5, Britains intelligence agency for domestic operations: Im afraid that terrorism didnt begin on 9/11 and it will be around for a long time. I was very surprised by the announcement of a war on terrorism because terrorism has been around for 35 years...[and it] will be around while there are people with grievances...One can be misled by talking about a war, as though in some way you can defeat it. As Bush said before his handlers got the muzzle back on.

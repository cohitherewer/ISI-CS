 Letters to Editor

 Hiding behind jargon

 Sir ? Has Shaukat Aziz, the prime minister of Pakistan, ever been to management school? Why were his answers to journalists? questions full of terms and phrases ? such as ?cherry-picking?, ?out of the box?, ?trust deficit?, ?slam dunk? and ?strategic balance? ? straight out of a corporate boardroom (?Hard seed inside Aziz cherry?, Nov 25)? As if the diplomatic jargon emanating from New Delhi and Islamabad were not enough, now we have Aziz making the developments in the Indo-Pak talks as opaque as possible to the ordinary people of the two countries. The people, unfortunately, do not imbibe confidence from the confidence-building measures, nor can they grasp the significance of secretary-level meetings. But they do understand that when politicians take recourse to obfuscatory language, more often than not, they are trying to fudge the real issues.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Ghosh, Calcutta

 Lady with the gun

 Sir ? The kind of harassment faced by Pinki Pramanik at the Habibpur railway station is exactly the kind of obstacles strewn in the everyday path of underprivileged women of the mofussil (?Pistol pops out of shooting-star athlete?s kit?, Nov 23). And if a woman happens to be an athlete, men derive additional pleasure in abusing, assaulting and, if they can manage it, raping her. In Pramanik?s case, the obvious question that arises is: what authority did the panchayat pradhan have to search her handbag? If he was suspicious, he should have called the police, and asked Pramanik as well as the men who had ?brought? her to him to wait till the police arrived. 

 Yours faithfully,

Gautam Ganguly, Michigan, US

 Sir ? As correctly pointed out in the report, ?Superfast rise and fall of Pistol Pinki? (Nov 24), the incident involving Pinki Pramanik is the latest in a series of scandals involving Bengal sportspersons. But the cases of Sashti Duley, Dipankar Roy, and Avtar Singh are significantly different from that of Pramanik. The soccer duo of Duley and Roy, who were accused of harbouring a criminal, were sent to police custody and were paraded before the press and television cameras, to their utter humiliation. Bengali TV channels even reported that the police used methods of torture while ?interrogating? them. The media, rather than protesting, joined in the fun. So much so that the duo?s fellow footballers had to launch a campaign to get them freed on bail. In Avtar Singh?s case too, despite flimsy evidence, he was subjected to much ignominy in public. His wife and legislator, Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, was not spared either, although there was nothing to prove her complicity in the case.

 In contrast, Pramanik, found illegally carrying an unregistered weapon, has been showered with sympathy. She seems to have got away even with changing her version of the story. She has found sympathizers among the police, lawyers and the media. On top of that, her complaint of assault against the young men who had dragged her to the panchayat pradhan has landed them in a soup. It is clear that women can get away with anything as long as there are men to blame and men to feel sorry for them.

 Yours faithfully,

Suvrajit Saha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Subhas Chakraborty has done his bit for another sportsperson in trouble. He has given a clean chit to Pinki Pramanik, who was found with a pistol in her bag recently. Whether she is guilty or otherwise is a question best left to the courts of law. But Chakraborty?s statement is enough to tell us that the police administration dances to the tune of the ruling party. No doubt the police will be unable to gather the evidence required to prove her guilt.

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

 None to their aid

 Sir ? The story of a prisoner being forced to live a primitive existence because he is HIV-positive, underscores the need for greater awareness about AIDS in India (?Shunned for fear of AIDS?, Nov 23). The reluctance of the warders at the Alipore Central jail to even serve food to the HIV-infected prisoner shows the level of ignorance about HIV among ordinary people. Public knowledge about any disease primarily comes from doctors. Unfortunately, there have been reports of doctors refusing to treat AIDS victims for fear of contamination. AIDS is a relatively new disease which came to the knowledge of the world scientific community only in the Eighties. Most senior Indian doctors had graduated from medical school by then. It must be made mandatory for these doctors to learn about AIDS. For unless our healers become knowledgeable about the disease, can we ever hope to increase awareness among the public? 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US 

 Sir ? I fully agree with the editorial, ?Unmentionable? (Nov 24), that the Roman Catholic Church?s ban on condom use is a dangerous obstacle to the prevention of HIV/ AIDS among Indian Catholics. But the statement that India is ?second only to sub-Saharan Africa in the magnitude of its crisis? is inaccurate in two ways. First, according to the latest UNAIDS report, in terms of the absolute number of HIV-infected persons, India (5.1 million) is second only to South Africa (5.3 million). Second, in terms of the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS crisis, India is at present in a far better situation than South Africa or sub-Saharan Africa. Since our population (1,048 million) is much larger than South Africa?s (44 million), the prevalence of HIV-infected adults in India is less than 1 per cent, against South Africa?s 13 per cent. 

 The HIV/AIDS crisis in India is not expected to become as acute as in South Africa or sub-Saharan Africa, at least in the near future. But noting the recent trend of increase in its prevalence in India, it is desirable to strengthen our efforts to control the spread of the disease without creating unnecessary scare about it.

 Yours faithfully,

Moni Nag, New York

 Letters to Editor

 Playing to lose

 Sir ? Must we suspend our objectivity every time a Bengali, or a Calcuttan, comes close to making it big? Why do we kick up such a fuss over Sourav Ganguly, whose captaincy is mediocre at best? He may well appear more confident than he can make his team-mates feel, but cricket matches are not won in the mental department, although being strong there helps. Let?s face the truth, our team will never perform well so long as Ganguly is captain. Let us also not be under any illusion, the team that takes the field consists of eleven of Ganguly?s ? not the board?s ? chosen men. Which is why Sadagoppan Ramesh, averaging 40 in test cricket, was not given half as many chances as the Sehwags and Kaifs were. And still, we will go on putting Ganguly on a pedestal and add his name to our pantheon. For, as Bengalis, we have been trained to appreciate one who plays politics the best.

 Yours faithfully,

V.S. Giri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ian Healy?s account of the Bangalore test between India and Australia was full of bias and unwarranted criticism (?Sub-standard wicket backfired on India?, Oct 12). He came across as a child who has got his wish at last. The fact is that India continues to remain a hindrance to Australia?s quest for supremacy in test cricket. They lost the last series in India and had to swallow their pride in Australia. Steve Waugh had to retire without realizing his dream of beating India in India. 

 The frustration is clear in Healy?s comments. But he goes ridiculously far when he tries to pull down Harbhajan Singh who, incidentally, captured 11 wickets in the match, while showering praises on Shane Warne who only got a handful and even got hammered by a rookie such as Irfan Pathan. Australia won the match alright, but it did little to improve Warne?s record in India. Or dampen the success of Harbhajan Singh against the Australians which reads a stupendous 43 wickets in the last four tests. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suresh Behera, Ranchi

 Sir ? We claim to be potential world-beaters in cricket, but our top-order batsmen display extreme irresponsibility, as if to prove the contrary. The banner in the Chinnaswamy stadium which read, ?India have found new opening pair in Pathan and Harbhajan?, sums up the crisis.

 Yours faithfully,

Urvashi Kaul, Kharagpur

 Sir ? It is best that we get used to watching our team lose more often than it manages to win. Where are things going wrong? The Indian captain is not a mean orator. Every time the team loses, he says things such as, ?The boys must pull up their socks and be positive.? He sounds utterly convincing, but, sadly, things show little signs of looking up. This year, except for the series in Pakistan, we have lost everything and still, the captain calls the team the second best in the world. Imagine then the huge gulf that must exist between the best and the second best.

 Yours faithfully,

Wriddhaayan Bhattacharyya, Calcutta

 Sir ? Is the absence of Sachin Tendulkar affecting the performance of the team a little too much? Some of the most experienced batsmen in the world seemed to have taken it upon themselves to prove that Tendulkar is indispensable, rather than trying to make up for his absence. Perhaps they should pay more attention to their responsibilities on-field than on their business commitments.

 Yours faithfully,

Rasmita Rath, Cuttack

 Sir ? I agree with Lokendra Pratap Sahi that ?[Billy] Bowden... should be in a circus and not the elite umpires? panel? (?Bowden adds to India?s woes; Aussies four wickets from win?, Oct 10). Of course, India?s dismal batting performance cannot be blamed on the umpires. But shouldn?t there be some kind of accountability where umpires are concerned? A couple of atrocious decisions when the Indians were struggling for survival certainly had an impact on the outcome of the match. Is it fair that players are mercilessly penalized at the faintest show of dissent, while the umpires go scot-free even after pronouncing one wrong verdict after another? 

 Yours faithfully,

Hemanta K. Dutta, Shibpur

 Sir ? If Billy Bowden had stopped at adjudging Irfan Pathan caught behind when the latter?s bat had not touched the ball, he could have been excused. But he repeated his mistake by declaring Virender Sehwag out leg before wicket when the inside edge was too thick to miss. This is probably a hint for the International Cricket Council to introduce a fee-cut for umpires who make such glaring errors, as Sunil Gavaskar once suggested.

 Yours faithfully,

Dipakranjan Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? The performance of the Indian team under Sourav Ganguly has been pathetic. The absence of Sachin Tendulkar of late has shattered the myth that Ganguly is the greatest captain India ever had. It is now clear that India?s run of success was because of the presence of Tendulkar rather than a result of Ganguly?s exceptional captaincy. And the less said about the captain?s personal contribution, the better. Time without number, he has run himself ? or, worse still, the non-striker ? out by trying to take a non-existent run. In the Champion?s Trophy, poor Mohammed Kaif had to sacrifice his wicket so that the captain could keep his. The team needs new blood. Could the selectors please remove the deadwood?

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Tulshan, Calcutta

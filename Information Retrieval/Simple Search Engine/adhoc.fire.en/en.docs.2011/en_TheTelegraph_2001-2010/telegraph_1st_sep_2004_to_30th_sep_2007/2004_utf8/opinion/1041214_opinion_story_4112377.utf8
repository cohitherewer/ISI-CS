 WITH SERIOUS INJURY TO OUR CONSCIENCE

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 Why don?t we realize that in an emergency, a few seconds can make all the difference?

 The journey back from office is generally as uneventful as a normal working day ? queuing up at a Metro rail ticket counter, descending a flight of stairs and entering a vestibule full of glum faces. Things took a different turn recently when the train in which we were travelling made its scheduled halt at the Kalighat station. A large number of drowsy passengers were rudely awakened from their reverie by the piercing screams of a woman in our compartment. Others, however, continued to doze. 

 As we rushed towards the door, we saw, much to our horror that a woman had slipped on the platform in her effort to get on the train. One of her legs was stuck in a usual gap ? between the carriage and the platform. She lay writhing, screaming with pain (and in panic) even as we realized that her foot was getting burnt as it was in contact with the wires under the carriage. 

 By then, all hell had broken loose. A man who had attempted to help the woman from inside the compartment got the shock of his life ? a low dose of electricity. Most of the passengers had now spilled on to the platform and stood in a circle around the suffering woman, trading opinions about what could possibly be the next best step. There was no way in which any medical help, or even a stretcher could make way through that crowd. Worse, there was no sign of the power supply being turned off even though more than a couple of minutes had elapsed. By then, the woman had received considerable injuries to the lower part of her leg. The acrid smell of her burnt rubber soles hung about in the compartment for a while. 

 ?Puro body current hoye gyache dada?, shouted a co-passenger with nervous excitement. Other irate passengers were demanding that the train be started, feverishly tapping the windows with their knuckles. 

 Help, however, arrived. The motorman had managed to contact the control room and the power was turned off. A stretcher arrived and the woman was carried off for medical attention. We resumed our journey, shaken by what we had witnessed.

 At the terminal station, on approaching a man with a semi-official air, we were told that the incident was ?a first? in the history of the Metro Railways. However, the management would look into it, he promised. Yet, many of our questions had been left unanswered. 

 For instance, why was there a gap ? large enough to slip into ? between the platform and the train? Why is it not possible for the motorman to turn off the power without first contacting the control room, which then proceeds to perform the task? In an emergency, the time taken by this long-drawn process can virtually make the difference between life and death. 

 In this particular case, had the power been switched off a little earlier, the woman would not have suffered such serious burns or trauma. More important, why are medical attendants or even first-aid kits not available at the stations? The authorities seem to be more concerned about security threats than emergencies like the one that happened.

 The following day, a tiny report appeared in one of the dailies. It said that a woman passenger had ?tripped? and fallen down while ?alighting? from a train and that her injury was ?not serious?. But I, along with many others who saw the incident happen, have a different story to tell.

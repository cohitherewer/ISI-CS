 HOW TO MAKE A MOLEHILL OF A MOUNTAIN

 The UPA regime?s desire to help farmers is all very well. But a return to the pre-reform days of dangling subsidies is not the answer, writes Satrujit Banerjee

 Problem of plenty

 After the 2004 general elections, the refrain of all the constituents of the United Progressive Alliance government, led by the Congress, was that more needed to be done for the agricultural sector. India was not ?shining? for farmers, they opined, and the government had to undertake ?reforms with a human face? to alleviate their misery. This would go down well as a worthy left-of-centre cause which would also garner rural votes. Thus, the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, drastically hacked power tariffs in the last budget, increased agriculture credit by a whopping 30 per cent and raised fertilizer subsidies.

 It is no secret that farmers are discontented and that their advancement has not kept pace with the country?s GDP growth over the last decade-and-a-half, especially that in the last six-seven years. However, the tools used in the last budget to address their plight reflect the short-sightedness of politicians. 

 Just one or two good monsoons result in a mountain of unsold produce, especially foodgrains. In July 2002, the government had an unsold mound of over 63 million tonnes of foodgrains, against a recommended buffer stock of around 17 million tonnes. Worse, it seems the Food Corporation of India cannot even provide a shelter for the unsold stock and a significant portion simply rots. This explains reports in the media of rodents feasting on these mountains. 

 In 2002 again, India had its worst drought in half-a-century. But even this was not enough to flatten the mountain. The National Democratic Alliance, which was in government then, resorted to unprecedented foodgrain exports in excess of 10 million tonnes, by providing huge subsidies. 

 The mountain still would not flatten. So the government dumped huge quantities on the public distribution system, needless to say, at below-cost prices which the shopkeepers lapped up. But even after all these strenuous exercises, the foodstocks hovered at around 20 million tonnes.

 Thus we have a situation where tax-payers are subsidizing both fertilizers and agriculture credit (which, understandably, has above-average defaults), and then re-subsidizing the sale of the produce which is in excess of the country?s requirements. 

 In short, all the talk about neglect of the agricultural sector is grossly exaggerated. When it is the system which existed before 2002 that has resulted in the unprecedented food mountains, is there any need for additional production? An interesting aside was provided in a recent insightful article by P.K. Joshi, Ashok Gulati and others in the Economic and Political Weekly which shows that through the Nineties, the annual rate of growth in the production of milk was 5.17 per cent, that of chicken 5.66 per cent, fruit 5.61 per cent, eggs 4.49 per cent, and fish 3.5 per cent, while that of cereals was only 2. 52 per cent. Yet this diversification and the seemingly low growth rate of cereals were not sufficient to make a dent in the food mountain. 

 The way out of this problem is simple in principle. The government should maintain the recommended buffer stock and the farmer be freed to export the surplus at international prices which, incidentally, need not be subsidized. In practice, however, a slew of mindless export policies and subsidies has made this solution a non-starter. Unless we clean up our export trade practices we will be in no position to ask rich countries not to subsidize their farm exports and to allow exports of our non-subsidized farm produce.

 It was heartening, in this regard, to see Kamal Nath, the Union commerce and industries minister, take a pragmatic stance at the recent World Trade Organization meet in Geneva. In a departure from yesteryear, he placed agriculture on the negotiating table in return for similar offers by other countries. 

 But to take advantage of this promising start, the gamut of India?s export subsidies has to be either done away with or made ?WTO compatible?. Among these, the Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme, Pre- and Post-shipment Export Financing Programme and the Special Import Licence are completely WTO incompatible. The other subsidy very popular with Indian exporters is the Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme ? extended recently to the end of March 2005 ? which allows them to import raw materials duty-free and export the same only after adding a minimum pre-determined value to the goods. This scheme is excellent, in concept, but is not WTO-compatible because of the way it is administered and monitored. Non-fulfilment of ?export obligations? after availing of ?duty-free imports? is reportedly widespread. Thus, reports that the prime minister?s office is taking a fresh look at the DEPB are welcome.

 Consider this: if an Indian exporter sells a chair to an American buyer for $100 and is subsidized $25 by our government as a result of any of our WTO non-compatible schemes, then the government of the United States of America can impose a countervailing duty on all furniture exports, at the rate of 25 per cent of the export value, on the pretext of protecting its indigenous furniture industry. In such a situation, the Indian exporter is left with $100 minus $25, that is $75, and after taking into account the subsidy, gets $100. Thus the Indian treasury loses the $25 doled out as subsidy and the US treasury is richer by $25. 

 A simple way of addressing this problem is to give back to the exporter all the duties and taxes on the raw materials used to manufacture the item by granting him the equivalent amount by way of duty drawback. This system is not only WTO compatible but also widely practised by developed countries.

 There is yet another reason to eliminate all WTO-incompatible subsidies, The entire textile and garment sector is in for a radical change with the impending end to quotas all over the world on January 1, 2005. We have avoided a confrontation with the developed countries till now because the latter cannot claim injury to their domestic industry and still have a harsh quota system in place, as is the case. Once quotas are done away with, there is no doubt that the US and the European Union will have countervailing duties in place and will enforce them strictly. After all, ?protection of indigenous industry? goes down well with every electorate.

 Even if export subsidies are made WTO-compatible and foodgrain exports take place, international grain prices are, by and large, only marginally higher than government procurement prices and thus are unlikely to significantly better the lot of the farmers. More than farming subsidies, what is needed is public investment in the rural areas. After nearly six decades of independence, is it too much to expect every village to be connected to the outside world by motorable roads, and that every house has access to electricity and running water?

 While on the surface, these measures may not seem to help get rid of the food mountains, a reliable source of power and adequate infrastructure will inevitably result in the setting up of cold-storage chains tempting the farmer to diversify from the traditional foodgrains, cotton and sugar. Growing fruit and vegetables will then become a profitable business as it will then arrive fresh at to the consumers in west Asia and southeast Asia, in addition to our own cities. (A small network in Maharashtra has resulted in a significant rise in exports of grapes and Alfonso mangoes). Clearly a return to the pre-reform days of dangling subsidies to assuage the miseries of the disadvantaged is not an option. India deserves better with the father of the economic reforms at its helm.

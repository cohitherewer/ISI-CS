 Letters to Editor

 Never happy

 Sir ? The former Indian cricketer, Ajit Wadekar, has credited India?s victory in Mumbai to the Wankhede pitch and the absence of Shane Warne (?It would have been different with Warne in?, Nov 6). Isn?t it strange that our former players are always derisive about our victories on home soil, while making our defeats appear nothing less than calamity? As someone who has led his side, Wadekar should have known that all home teams prepare surfaces that suit their strengths. Did his own success in England come on dusty, turning tracks? Moreover, going by Warne?s past record against India, he wouldn?t have made much of a difference anyway. Defending a paltry lead of 107 runs successfully against the world?s best cricketing side is no mean feat either. Perhaps former cricketer-turned-experts like Wadekar should refrain from flaying our players and give credit where it is due.

 Yours faithfully,

Rana Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Family drama

 Sir ? L.K. Advani should be congratulated for his decision to suspend Uma Bharti(?Lady vanishes,? Nov 11). No individual, irrespective of his or her political stature, is bigger than the party itself. Therefore, Bharti?s suspension on disciplinary grounds is entirely justified. There is no doubt that Bharti played a crucial role in the Bharatiya Janata Party?s victory in Madhya Pradesh last year. But does she have the right to claim sole credit for that showing? More important, Bharti has not been able to do justice to her political responsibilities ? her stints at the Centre and the state have been very short. Moreover, her involvement in the Idgah Maidan case sullied the BJP?s image and cost Bharti her chief ministership. Her recent tantrums, one suspects, was aimed at recovering her lost crown.

 Yours faithfully,

V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? Uma Bharti?s penchant for theatrics is well known. The drama surrounding her latest act reminds us of Sonia Gandhi renouncing the prime minister?s chair which was no less dramatic. There is a significant difference between the two events though. While Sonia?s refusal elevated her political status, Bharti?s behaviour has embarrassed the BJP no end. 

 One should not spare much thought for the political future of leaders like Bharti who are capable of stooping to such low levels. Instead, we should think about what her action signifies ? surely, a party in which a second-rung leader can show disrespect to the president in front of the camera cannot be relied upon to take care of public interest. If the BJP wants to remain as a force to contend with, it needs to put an end to such indiscipline and dissociate itself from the sangh parivar with immediate effect.

 Yours faithfully,

Umanath Sanyal, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The grounds on which Bharti was expelled from the BJP are rather flimsy. Can anyone blame her for requesting Advani to take action against some leaders who, according to Bharti, were spreading canards against her? Taking disciplinary action against grassroot leaders seems to have become a fashion in the BJP. Remember the treatment meted out to K. Govindacharya and Kalyan Singh? If the decision to suspend Bharti is not revoked immediately, the BJP will find itself left with two parliamentary seats again soon.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The BJP should have been careful not to wash its dirty linen in public. Uma Bharti?s outburst proves that the party is now bogged down with infighting. But Bharti does have reasons to be miffed ? having now found herself out of favour with the senior leaders all of a sudden. Messrs Vajpayee and Advani should ensure that the sanyasin is inducted back into the party at the earliest.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? The decision to suspend Uma Bharti from the BJP comes as a shock. More so, because the party had repeatedly used her clout among poor Hindu voters to win elections in the past. It seems that the party high command has realized that its Hindutva agenda is unlikely to pay rich electoral dividends. Hence, it had no qualms about showing the door to Bharti. The party?s new tactic defies logic. Can any party recover lost ground after dropping an important leader?

 Yours faithfully,

Rasmita Rath, Cuttack 

 Sir ? The BJP is now in a quandary. The party president needs to discipline his flock without fuelling an internal revolt. Moreover, the decision to expel a mass leader like Bharti, especially with elections due in Bihar, is fraught with risks. 

 Advani is painfully aware of this ? the BJP?s decision to expel Kalyan Singh dealt a body blow to the party?s chances in Uttar Pradesh from which it is yet to recover. One can only say that senior party leaders, including Advani, have their task cut out to get their party out of the woods in the coming days

 Yours faithfully,

 STAY IN THE DARK

 West Bengal is a dangerous state for the children of the poor. The B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital in Calcutta is the biggest state-run children?s hospital, and the only one in the city for referrals. Over the last few years, it has acquired a horrific reputation. It frequently goes through phases when the children die in unprecedented numbers, and for unfathomable reasons. This is followed by violent demonstrations, political agitation, brutal disavowals from the health minister, shocking non-comments from the chief minister, and the usual promise of inquiries, reports, suspensions and infrastructural reform. But public memory is short, the poor have nowhere else to take their sick children, and the chief minister and his men must get back to dazzling investors with the retail boom ? until the next batch of dead infants, for which the rituals are now well in place.

 This time, it happened during a long power-cut in the early hours of the morning. The hospital was plunged in total darkness, the warmers stopped working, there was no proper ventilation in the lethally overcrowded and filthy wards. Moreover, there were absolutely no back-up arrangements for such an emergency. A few candles were lit after half an hour. But guardians, nurses, doctors and staff were completely unable to take care of the critically ill children, most of them newborn, three of whom died during the almost two-hour-long power cut. This hospital has no generator or alternative supply line. Senior administrators, bureaucrats and the minister have met, talked extensively to CESC, but no decision seems to have been taken regarding an alternative supply or a generator. The hospital has been asking for a generator for some time ? to no avail. Arranging for one appears to be inscrutably complicated. The immediate political and bureaucratic aftermath to these episodes is senseless and obscene. Party leaders tie themselves in knots denying any link between the deaths and the hospital administration?s inefficiency. The deaths may have happened during the power-cut, but that does not mean they had anything to do with it; in fact, some of the babies died after power supply was restored; besides, it was CESC which cut off the supply and took so long to repair the fault, and so on. Only there was no rat this time to take the blame for it all. But the irresponsibility is quite as distant from the human.

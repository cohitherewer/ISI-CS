 PRISONERS OF ANOTHER WAR

 Only greater vigilance and activism of the US judiciary can assure that detainees at Guantanamo Bay get justice, writes Sankar Sen

 In custody

 A large number of foreign ?enemy combatants? are being held at the American base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Many of them were captured during the Afghanistan conflict and transferred to the naval base in 2003 under harsh conditions. The precise number, identities and nationalities of those held in Guantanamo Bay have not been made public. None of the detainees has been granted ?prisoner of war? status or brought before a competent tribunal to determine their status as required under Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention. The US government, despite repeated pleas, has not clarified their legal status and continues to label them as ?enemy combatants? or ?terrorists?. Many of the detainees, without much evidence, have been linked to the September 11 attacks on the US. Though some of the detainees have been released without any charge, no compensation has been offered to them for their illegal detention for months.

 After visits to the camps in 2003, the International Committee of Red Cross described the situation prevailing there as ?unacceptable?. Detainees are subjected to repeated interrogations, sometimes for hours, without the presence of a lawyer. Thus some of their statements may have been extracted from them under threat or intimidation. There has been a ?worrying deterioration? in their mental health. There have been 32 suicide attempts by 21 prisoners over the past two years. Some of the detainees who returned to Britain have narrated their experiences. One Jamal-ul-Harith, a 37-year-old convert, said the beatings were not as bad as the psychological torture. Other British detainees also confirmed both physical abuse and psychological torture. But the Bush administration asserted that though Guantanamo is not an ideal resort, detainees are treated humanely, if not fully in compliance with the Geneva Convention. They are housed in individual cells and given ?culturally appropriate meals?. They are not kept shackled and prostitutes are never allowed into Guantanamo. 

 It is difficult to come to a clear conclusion as to whether the allegations of torture are exaggerated. There are virtually no independent witnesses and human rights groups have not been allowed into Guantanamo other than the ICRC, which usually does not report its findings. The contention of the US government until recently was that Guantanamo Bay, leased in perpetuity from Cuba, is not part of the US. So American civil courts do not have any say over what happens there. The suspects lodged there are outside both the Geneva Convention and the US law. The US solicitor general, Theodore Olson, even referred back to a 52-year-old supreme court ruling concerning German prisoners captured in China after World War II, in which the court held that ?aliens? detained by the military abroad have only those rights that are ?determined by the executive and the military and not the courts?. The US government holds that the Guantanamo suspects are not POWs because they were captured without uniform and can be detained without trial for the entire duration of hostility.

 The US supreme court has only recently heard cases regarding the status of Guantanamo detainees and ruled that they have the right to challenge their detention in US courts. In a case brought by two Australians and 12 Kuwaitis, the supreme court held that prisoners must be present in court and refused to accept the plea of the administration that the detainees were foreigners or that Guantanamo Bay was beyond the reach of US courts. 

 The court made it clear that it is for the courts, and not the executive, to determine whether executive action is subject to judicial review. The supreme court also heard the case of Yaser-Hamdi, a Saudi citizen who was captured in Afghanistan, and declared his detention for more than two years as unconstitutional. The Pentagon has now set up military review panels to decide whether the detainees should be released or not. But these have been widely condemned ?as an unfair system that threatens to convict the innocent and provide the guilty with a justifiable complaint as to their conviction?.

 Some of the detainees have challenged the military panels in American courtrooms. Recently, James Robertson, judge in the US district court in Washington DC, halted the trial of one Saleem Ahmad Hamdan, saying that a competent tribunal must first decide whether the detainee fulfilled the criteria of PoW under the Geneva Convention. The judge further ruled that the tribunal must conform to the US Uniform Code of Military Justice. 

 Earlier, in December 2003, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that the government had no authority to detain Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber, who was arrested in Chicago in May 2002. Similarly, a San Francisco court rejected the administration?s right to hold detainees indefinitely and to hear them only before a military court. A group of soldier-lawyers assigned to defend a group of detainees to be tried by military tribunal filed a brief in the supreme court, saying that the US constitution cannot allow open-ended presidential power with no civilian review whatsoever. If this is permitted, it will give the president ?monarchical powers and cast the detainees into a legal black hole?.

 Hopefully, these court decisions will force the Bush administration into treating prisoners in a more humane manner. Indeed, the treatment of detainees supposedly improved after the supreme court decided to hear their cases. However the process of judging their guilt and setting them free will be separate. Even then, it will require a courageous judge to declare that the military version of a detainee being ?dangerous? is not acceptable.

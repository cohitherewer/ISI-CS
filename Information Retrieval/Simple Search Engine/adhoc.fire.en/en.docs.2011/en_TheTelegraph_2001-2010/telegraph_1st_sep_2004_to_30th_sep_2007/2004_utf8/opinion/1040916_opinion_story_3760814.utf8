 Rewards of the small town 

 Gouri Chatterjee

 Harivansh wouldn?t leave Ranchi for the bright lights of Delhi or Mumbai even if you offered him the editorship of Navbharat Times or Outlook Saptahik or some such big-banner title. ?I am able to do real journalism here,? the chief editor of Prabhat Khabar, Jharkhand?s number one paper, says self-deprecatingly. 

 The lure of the small town drew as big a star as Rajdeep Sardesai to Ranchi last Thursday. ?I would much rather come to these smaller places than the big cities,? he said. ?People here are far more interested in what you have to say. They are so involved.? 

 Sardesai was there to speak on ?Challenges of Journalism? at a programme organized by Prabhat Khabar as part of its 20th-year celebrations. He could have been here this Thursday if he had accepted the invitation from a Calcutta paper. He opted for Ranchi. 

 The overflowing CMPDI auditorium listened with rapt attention to the Big Fight hero?s portrayal of the ?marketing guys? who would like to ?get a filmstar to read the 9 o?clock news? and the headlong rush towards ?infotainment? just because it is lucrative. 

 Nothing could be more apt than Prabhat Khabar, with ?Akhbar nahin andolan? as its slogan, hosting such a discussion. In the 14 years since he took charge, Harivansh, a product of the Seventies JP movement, has remained true to his conviction that journalism should ?fight for the common man, empower the weak?. For Prabhat Khabar, such ?value-based socially meaningful? journalism has meant a circulation jump from 500 odd copies to over 275,000, five more editions spanning three states, sufficient revenue to keep it in the black.

 Harivansh agrees wholeheartedly that he would not have even dared dream of such an ?experiment? if he had remained part of the ?glamorous journalism? of metropolitan India. (Harivansh started in Mumbai with Dharmyug of the Times group, then moved to Ravivar and Calcutta.) In Ranchi, Harivansh had nothing to lose but his ideals.

 Away from the tyranny of spreadsheets and power point presentations, Prabhat Khabar could work out what was in its best interest as a newspaper, not just as a ?revenue model? to keep the board members happy. But the good times may soon be over. The ?marketing guys? have begun to discover small-town India.

 Hardly a solution

 We are supposed to be ?objective?, journalists like to say. They can?t take sides and do a Michael Moore even if they wanted to or had the ability to. That?s shirking, Moore would retort, as he has said both after Bowling for Columbine won an Oscar in 2002 and since Fahrenheit 9x11 hit big time. His precise words are closer to, ?I wouldn?t have had to do this film if journalists had done their jobs properly.? 

 In other words, political documentaries are not the same as journalism because they take a stand, have a point of view (or bias or propaganda if you will), name names, pin blame, say things, show things that journalists cannot, or will not, do. A journalist is one who is supposed to sit in the stands and cover the game; a documentary maker, or docu-activist, declares which team he is rooting for, goes down to the court and begins to score points for it.

 But not Rakesh Sharma?s Final Solution, shown for the first time in Calcutta last Sunday. It is so painfully fair (I wouldn?t be surprised if the nearly three-hour film is split equally between the victims and the marauding BJP down to the last minute) that you wonder what the Censor Board is so worried about. This film won?t inflame any passions; it has no passion to begin with. Give me the ?evenhanded? daily news every day, at least it has the virtue of immediacy.

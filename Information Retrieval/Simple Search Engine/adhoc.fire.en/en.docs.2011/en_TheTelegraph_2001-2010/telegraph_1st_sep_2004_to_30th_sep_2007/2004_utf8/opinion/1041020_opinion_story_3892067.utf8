 Letters to Editor

 Playing with soft hands

 Sir ? The keeping gloves seem to be too big for India?s pint-sized wicket-keeper (?Sourav bats for Parthiv?, Oct 19). But for his butter-fingered show behind the stumps, India would have put it across to the Aussies on the fourth day itself. But what comes as a surprise is the manner in which Sourav Ganguly is trying to shield the youngster from the brickbats. The excuse, that it is difficult to keep wickets on turning tracks, does not hold water as other Indian keepers have kept on similar surfaces at home. The selectors should have remembered that it is Parthiv?s skill with the gloves, and not the bat, which matters. And on this count, they should give another chance to a talented youngster like Mahender Singh Dhoni instead of retaining Parthiv. Dada may have ensured Parthiv a place for the next test but does it augur well for the future of Indian cricket?

 Yours faithfully,

Indranil Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Time to change

 Sir ? The fact that the archaic views of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board ? which does not have a single woman member ? continue to govern the lives of Muslim women should cause concern. It is unacceptable, especially in a secular country like India, that a marriage can be annulled by uttering talaq thrice or a women is denied parental property. Likewise, conferring the right to divorce to only men goes against the fundamental principles of a modern society. There seems to be a silent acceptance of such treatment of women among Muslims. Maulavis, who have the final say in such matters, issue sermons based on the Shariah about what is good or bad for Muslim women. Occasionally, they are even applauded for making minor ?concessions? to women in such matters.

 In the West, Muslims have no problems obeying the laws of the country they live in and which are uniformly applicable to all citizens. Many Islamic countries, as the editorial, ?Getting on board? (Oct 8), correctly points out, have got rid of repressive social customs. It is difficult to understand why India should be an exception in this regard. An honest debate, both among ordinary Muslims and inside parliament, is needed. Unfortunately, our political parties seem to shy away from such a prospect for fear of losing Muslim votes.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Banerjee, Hereford, UK

 Sir ? Muslims are well-known for their conservative views on marriage, divorce and property rights. The two main factors responsible for their conservatism are low literacy levels and high poverty. The AIMPLB?s willingness to discuss changes in its outlook to marriage and inheritance laws at its forthcoming conclave to be held at Kozhikode, will be welcome. This will undoubtedly help chart a new course for the future of this community. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bibhabari Rath, Cuttack

 Sir ? The institution of marriage is deeply entrenched in Indian minds. But the same cannot be said of the West where divorce is common. Problems are bound to crop up between married couples but in no way are these insurmountable. Divorce should ideally be the last resort. The leaders of the Muslim community need to put a stop to the practice of the talaq which makes it easier for men to obtain divorce without adhering to time consuming legalities. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 No help needed

 Sir ? If the killing of scores of people in Assam and Nagaland is of any concern to the Union government, it should accept the offer of help made by the American ambassador, David C. Mulford, to combat terrorism (?US help gives Delhi headache?, Oct 6). The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a lot of expertise in fighting terrorists and this could be of immense help to tackle the problem of insurgency in India. Mulford?s offer should be viewed in the light of the ongoing bilateral cooperation agreement between the United States of America and India. The left?s allegations of American interference in our internal problems need to be summarily dismissed.

 Yours faithfully,

V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? Our history books are replete with examples of princely states asking for British help to settle internal disputes. This gave the British an opportunity to meddle into India?s domestic affairs and they went on to rule the country for nearly two centuries. The fact that the chief minister of Assam, Tarun Gogoi, is keen on David Mulford?s offer proves that we haven?t learn from our mistakes. 

 If Gogoi feels that he has failed in combating insurgency in the state, he should resign. Gogoi has no right to threaten the sovereignty of our country by enlisting American help to tackle militants in the North-east. As for the American ambassador, he will be better off allaying the fears of American citizens who have become paranoid with fear after the terror strikes on the World Trade Center.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapas Biswas, Barrackpore

 Out and About

If pop stars could do it, there?s no reason the writers? bloc couldn?t. So felt South African Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer. And taking the cue from the likes of Band Aid, wrote to 20 of her most-admired writers, asking them if they could part with a story each. The reason: charity. All 20 got back to her, and what resulted from the exercise was Telling Tales, a collection of stories edited by Gordimer herself. The proceeds from the sale of the book are to go to the Treatment Action Campaign against HIV/AIDS, an organisation based in Africa. It?s only words, really, but could make a world of difference.

 Farah Khan

 It seems dancing days are never over for Farah Khan. After having put actors through their steps ? literally ? for 15-odd years with her body language, the 38-year-old choreographer-filmmaker has gone traipsing down the aisle with film editor Shirish Kunder, 31. Love blossomed on the sets of Farah?s directorial debut Main Hoon Na, one hears. And age was no bar, for Farah apparently claims to be ?mentally younger?. The couple have three wedding ceremonies lined up in a row: a nikaah, followed by a registered marriage and a south Indian ceremony, since Shirish hails from Mangalore. Farah?s brother, Sajid ?Chatterbox? Khan plans to entertain the guests with a skit. That?s what you?d call ikke pe ikka.

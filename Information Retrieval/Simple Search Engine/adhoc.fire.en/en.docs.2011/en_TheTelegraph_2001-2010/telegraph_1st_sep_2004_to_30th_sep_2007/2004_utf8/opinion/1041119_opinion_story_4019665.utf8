 TALES TO TELL

 Still going strong

THE CRIMSON AGENDA: MAOIST PROTEST AND TERROR 

By Ranjit Kumar Gupta, Wordsmiths, Rs 369

Crude bombs exploded almost everywhere, any time of 

the day or night. Ordinary people, political activists and policemen were knifed 

or shot at on wide avenues and in half-lit, narrow alleys. Schools and colleges 

were closed every other day. The writings on the city walls called upon the people 

to turn every spark into a prairie fire. Before the sun set, streets would be 

largely empty except for the policemen on patrol. 

 That was pretty much the picture of Calcutta in the late Sixties and early Seventies, thanks to the Naxalite uprising. The rebels proclaimed Mao Zedong as ?our chairman?, believed in his thesis that ?all power flows from the barrel of a gun? and went on to eliminate the ?class enemies?. The result was a kind of anarchist terror that was unprecedented in India. 

 More than anyone else, Ranjit Kumar Gupta, as the new commissioner of the city police, faced the uphill task of saving Calcutta ? and Bengal ? from the Maoist terror. His methods were fiercely debated, but there was no denying that by 1972 he had won the battle. 

 At 84, Gupta recounts the story that has become part of Bengal?s political lore. He certainly is the one person who knows the truth about that story. So one picks up the book with expectations of rare insights and hitherto unknown facts. 

 Gupta partially fulfils this expectation . We are thus told that the police had no hand in the three biggest mass murders of Naxalites ? those at Baranagore-Cossipore, Barasat and Howrah. In all three incidents, which shocked even apolitical people, the bodies of hundreds of slain Naxalites were thrown into the Hooghly. The killings, he tells us, were the handiwork of the CPI(M) and Congress activists, who had suffered heavily at the hands of the Maoists. 

 Gupta maintains that the police had not taken to unlawful means such as staged encounters and third-degree tortures in order to put down the revolt. Many people who had some first-hand knowledge of the events of the time would find it hard to accept Gupta?s clean chit to the police. It is not easy for someone so directly involved in the job to come up with the whole truth.

 But the book has much more than the author?s memories of his own work to defeat the Naxalite challenge. He offers insightful explanations on why the rebels failed, not just in their urban adventures in Calcutta but in the villages of Bengal as well. He goes back to the beginnings of the Maoist party that was born at Naxalbari in north Bengal, with Charu Mazumdar?s obsession with ?annihilation of the class enemy?, and contrasts it with the ?Stalinist? CPI(M). It is possible to find fault with many of the arguments ? after all, Gupta?s is the approach of a policeman and not of a political scientist.

 Maoism has survived on other shores of India. As many as six states are now battling Maoist groups, particularly the People?s War and the Maoist Communist Centre, which merged recently to form the Communist Party of India (Maoist). And, these groups have forged links with the Maoists of Nepal who have been waging a war for seven years to overthrow the monarchy and replace it with a communist republic. Gupta rightly suggests that the current Maoist threat may prove more difficult to tackle than the infantile adventures of Mazumdar?s Bengali brigade, unless the state seriously addresses the agrarian and other issues that throw up such rebellions.

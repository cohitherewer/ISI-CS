 LIQUID EYES AND CROSSED LEGS

M .Y Ghorpade, the author of SUNLIGHT AND SHADOWS 

: AN INDIAN WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHER?S DIARY (Penguin, Rs 1,495), is a former 

MP from Karnataka. He is also an acclaimed wildlife photographer, as is evident 

from this book. What sets apart the photographs in this collection is Ghorpade?s 

choice of black-and-white, something that allows him to delineate mood and texture 

through the interplay of light and shadow. Take the picture on the left. There 

is almost a human resignation in the face of the langur on the right; the liquid 

eyes, the daintily crossed legs, the slight curve of his spine adding to the attitude 

of hopelessness, while the light and the exposure are just right to capture every 

muscle and every strand of hair on his body. And the other one?s hands.

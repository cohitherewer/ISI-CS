 MANY CHEFS, BUT NO RECIPE

TWENTY-TWENTY / BHARAT BHUSHAN

 In hot pursuit

 There are too many knights tilting at the windmills in Kashmir. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Manmohan Singh government does not have a clear policy on Jammu and Kashmir. And though there are emissaries aplenty dealing with Kashmir, there is no coordination between them.

 It is not as if the National Democratic Alliance government did not have a multiplicity of views on Kashmir. At any point of time, there were three competing views on Kashmir ? that of the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani, and the defence minister, George Fernandes. But at the end of the day, even if Advani wanted ?hot pursuit? and Fernandes waxed eloquent on cross-border terrorism, Vajpayee?s view prevailed. In the current dispensation, nobody knows if there is any one dominant view or what that view is.

 In the Congress, some leaders believe that Mufti Mohammad Sayeed is good for Kashmir. There are others who are convinced that he cannot be trusted. Thus the party was pushed towards an abortive conspiracy in July this year to bring down the Mufti government and install a National Conference-Congress government at Srinagar.

 Within the government, the prime minister wants to think out-of-the-box on Kashmir. His home minister, Shivraj Patil, however, has only recently left the framework of the ?four corners of the Indian Constitution? behind while looking at Kashmir.

 In the prime minister?s office, there are those who believe that new thinking is needed on Kashmir and others who are convinced that it is pointless considering any more ?concessions? to the Kashmiris as that could have a copy-cat effect on the demands of insurgent groups in India?s north-east. The national security advisor, J.N. Dixit, views Kashmir in the bilateral perspective. M.K. Narayanan, who advises on internal security, views the issue in a different context.

 The veteran bureaucrat, N.N. Vohra, has been given the charge of talking to the Hurriyat as the government?s special representative. He reports to the home minister. However, Narayanan also rushed the textile secretary, Wajahat Habibullah, to Jammu and Kashmir to talk to the Hurriyat. To compound the confusion, the former intelligence chief, A.S. Dulat, was sent to Kashmir by the PMO to do the same. The Hurriyat leaders are bound to be confused about which emissary to take seriously.

 In New Delhi, there is no centralized pooling of inputs from these freelance and full-time plenipotentiaries. There is no coordination among them and they learn about what the others are doing from leaks in the media.

 The government knows that there is a problem in Kashmir that needs to be discussed with the Kashmiri people; and also that there is a problem of Kashmir, which needs to be discussed with Pakistan. The problem in Kashmir is internal to India and needs to be addressed by New Delhi jointly with the Kashmiri leaders. And this does not mean only the Hurriyat leaders. It needed a Pakistani journalist to tell one of these leaders that unless they contested elections, the world would not know that they really represented the Kashmiri people.

 Yet, success in Kashmir is being equated only with restarting a dialogue with the All Party Hurriyat Conference. Perhaps too many bureaucratic and political careers depend on it. Shivraj Patil?s heart may not be in the dialogue, but can he afford to be compared unfavourably with the leaders of the NDA, which held two rounds of talks with the Hurriyat? Nor can any of the emissaries afford to show failure to bring them to the table.

 In beginning a dialogue with the Kashmiri leaders, a distinction must be made between two kinds of Kashmiri leaders: Separatists under the influence of Pakistan; and those who speak for the Kashmiris independently of Islamabad. If India deals with Pakistan, then it is Islamabad?s job to handle the separatists. It serves no purpose for India to talk to Syed Ali Shah Geelani as he has no opinion independent of Pakistan. Why then send Wajahat Habibullah to genuflect before him? Wooing Geelani only serves to de-legitimize the moderate Hurriyat leaders. It is in India?s interest to talk to the moderates because they talk of the interests of the Kashmiri people.

 However, the interests of the Kashmiris cannot be discussed with only one group exclusively. While such a dialogue must be held with the separatists, nationalist Kashmiris must not be ignored. There is an elected government and an elected opposition in Jammu and Kashmir. There is no point tom-tomming elections in the state one day and then ignoring the elected representatives of the people completely.

 The internal problems of Jammu and Kashmir, therefore, need to be discussed not only with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and his party, but also with the representatives of the National Conference and its leader, Farooq Abdullah, and other elected and unelected political leaders. Civil society organizations, lawyers, teachers, students and business representatives also need to be consulted on improving the internal situation in the state.

 Whether it is the issue of repealing some preventive detention laws, providing jobs to educated youngsters, improving the infrastructure, starting intra-Kashmir trade or negotiating greater autonomy, these issues need to be discussed with the Kashmiris of all hues except those who are proxies for Pakistan. Focussing on the Hurriyat to the point of excluding the others will send the signal that only separatists have legitimacy in the state.

 If the problems of Kashmiris are addressed to their satisfaction, this would have a positive impact on the bilateral aspects of the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan. But here too, the position of the Manmohan Singh government is not clear.

 In the absence of a clear plan, New Delhi was unable to react to the proposal thrown at it by General Pervez Musharraf. When Manmohan Singh met Musharraf in New York, he thought that he had put the Pakistan president on the defensive by asking him what remained on the table for discussion if all proposals not acceptable to India, Pakistan and the Kashmiris were dropped. When the general came out with his ?seven regions? of Kashmir proposal, India dodged the issue by saying that it would not react to a proposal that had been made through the media.

 Suppose the same proposal had come through official channels. Was New Delhi prepared with a detailed reaction? Nobody even bothered to ask General Musharraf what the ?five regions of Jammu and Kashmir in India? were, as we know of only three ? Jammu, Ladakh and the Valley. Does he consider Kargil as a separate region that could then be merged with Baltistan, or was Poonch and Rajouri a region that could be merged with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir because of its contiguity? Why did the Indian high commissioner not seek an appointment with the General and seek clarifications? 

 This is only the first proposal that Musharraf has lobbed at New Delhi and one can rest assured that he would come up with others. The Manmohan Singh government has been unable to give a well-thought-out reaction to the first proposal aimed at loosening the gridlock. Is it ready with alternative proposals? The answer is a resounding no because India does not appear to have got its act together.

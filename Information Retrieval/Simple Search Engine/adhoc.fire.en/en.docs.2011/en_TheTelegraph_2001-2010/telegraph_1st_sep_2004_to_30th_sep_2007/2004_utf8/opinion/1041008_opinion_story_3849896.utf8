 FLIGHT OF THE LITTLE BIRD 

 Magic on the field

Garrincha: The Triumph and Tragedy of Brazils 

Forgotten Footballing Hero, 

By Ruy Castro, Yellow Jersey, pound; 17

In the Brazilian football squad at the 1958 World 

Cup in Sweden was a player whom the team?s psychologist considered an imbecile. 

The coach too had a poor opinion of the player?s ability to read the game or understand 

the strategies involved. But the other Brazilian players knew that with a football, 

this man could work a magic that none of them could even contemplate.

 This man was Garrincha, the ?little bird?. Born with deformed legs in 1933 in the obscure village of Pan Grande, he was an unlikely soccer hero. Poverty, booze and girls were his companions from a very young age and remained so till the day he died.

 Garrincha was a genius with the football. But he had no ambition. He did not want to go to the clubs in big cities to further his prospects. Many football ?experts? turned him down on seeing his deformed legs, without giving him a chance to show his skills. A strange play of circumstances and coincidences thrust him into Botafogo, a prominent football club in Brazil. There he was to mesmerize opponents as few soccer players had done before. Spectators in Brazil, South America and later Europe were to gape in awe as his genius began to flower. Inevitably, comparisons with Stanley Mathews, Di Stefano and Puskas were made. Not that they mattered to Garrincha in the least. He was just himself: a wizard with the ball who had no idea how to increase his earnings, how to invest or how to save. Botafogo made millions through him, but never paid him his due. Incredibly, Garrincha would sign on blank forms, leaving club officials to fill in the amount.

 In a team full of individual stars like Vava, Didi and Pele, the exploits of Garrincha managed to stun the world even more. In Sweden, the unpredictable right-winger overshadowed the brilliance of his great contemporaries. He never played to the gallery and he was never selfish. Garrincha would dribble past defenders and then come back to dribble past them again. He would body-feint and go past goalkeepers to score instead of putting the ball easily into the corner of the net. His lightning speed with the ball appalled opponents as much as his own teammates.

 Football to Garrincha was a pastime to be enjoyed. Even world cup matches put no pressure on him. He was content to enjoy himself as he provided enjoyment to others.

 Garrincha?s game was marked by the same simplicity that marked his approach to life. Such was his disdain for wealth that even after winning two world cup medals he stayed in abject poverty in the village where he was born. But Garrincha never complained. He would keep his earnings, not in banks, but in cupboards and even pillow cases. 

 Little wonder that Garrincha attracted women wherever he went. Innumerable affairs resulted in a number of off-springs all around the world. Yet, none of his lovers seemed to bear him any ill-will. Garrincha was, and still is, rated by most of his countrymen as greater than even Pele. ?King? Pele was respected but Garrincha was loved and adored. People from all walks of life came to help him in his financial distress but his drinking meant he was beyond redemption. Garrincha died at the age of 49.

 Ruy Castro?s biography does justice to the memory of Garrincha ? the ?little bird? whom fame and fortune could not shackle.

 Letters to Editor

 Mark the bias

 Sir ? ?Marks bias notice to schools? (Oct 1) deserved a more prominent place than the corner of an inside page. This is because it is as relevant to students and parents in Mumbai ? where the Bombay high court has issued notices to the education secretary and three city schools ? as it is in West Bengal. Sieving students according to the marks they score in their final examinations, to determine which section of the class they will study in, is practised here too. The distress that this has caused to students and parents has been considerable. And this has resulted in students (and of course, their parents) in the less privileged sections spending precious time trying to find out what questions their counterparts in sections A, B and C have been asked to study. When marks are the be-all and end-all of an education system, the education imparted by it will be, sadly, ineffectual. 

 Yours faithfully,

Brinda Bose, Calcutta

 With reservations

 Sir ? Charity, it is said, begins at home. As the debate on extending job reservations to the private sector gathers momentum and the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, speaks of affirmaive action on the same, it is suggested that he sets his house in order first. This should be done by reserving a good fraction of the cabinet berths for the scheduled castes and tribes, for whom the reservation policy has been framed. Provisions should also be made for the posts of the president and the prime minister to be alternatively occupied by these underprivileged sections of the population. Only after these have been done should the politicians dare to saddle the private sector with job reservations. A nation that prefers quotas to merit and competence is headed for disaster. Instead of trying to knit together a strong democracy, politicians, with narrow self-interest in mind, have invented and taken recourse to another version of the British divide-and-rule policy. 

 It will be puerile to be under the impression that job quotas will work towards correcting historical wrongs. Will certain castes not be made scapegoats now with the reservation proposition? 

 Yours faithfully,

Anima G. Panda, Ranchi

 Sir ? Reservations for the backward classes have been in existence in our country, but these cannot be said to have benefitted them. If the government now sticks to its stand on reservations, it will only be compromising on competence and this will hardly be conducive to India?s position in the global economy. Why does the government not concentrate on creating more employment opportunities for the backward classes? Keeping in mind that illiteracy is a prime reason behind their backwardness, reservations, coupled with scholarships for them, should be confined to education. 

 Yours faithfully,

Diana Sahu, Cuttack

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Fear of quotas? (Sept 8), reflects a worrisome truth. Politics have become so dirty now that even the private sector is being compelled to reserve job openings for individuals whose eligibility lies not in their qualifications or managerial skills, but solely on their status. The earlier governments at the Centre have already caused irreparable damage by pursuing a reservation policy in the public sector. Now the United Progressive Alliance government is making a similar mistake. And it suits the UPA fine that no political party, even when at loggerheads with the Congress, will oppose this move. 

 It is unfortunate that government policies here are adopted not with the nation?s interests in mind but those of the ruling party?s; and electoral points are earned by sowing seeds of division. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 Sir ? Is not capitation fee the other name of reservation? Besides the engineering and technical institutes, many private English-medium schools demand a hefty sum of money during admissions, thus closing the doors to bright but poor students. It remains a fact that in India, there is little or no place for meritocracy.

 Yours faithfully,

Sujit De, Sodepur

 An appeal

 Sir ? Our only son, Nirmalya Ghosal, aged 18, has been diagnosed with Non Hodgkin Lymphoma ? a type of critical cancer in the neck. Treatment of this type of cancer is extremely costly, and we have exhausted all our savings on prolonged treatment, since August 2003. The honourable chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has sanctioned a cheque of Rs 15,000 and we are expecting financial help from the governor too. 

 We have proof and verifiable documents, if any kind donor should want evidence, including the letter from the chief minister?s secretariat. We could be contacted at 43, N.K. Chatterjee Street, Belghoria, Calcutta ? 700056 (Tel: 2541 3313).

 Yours faithfully, 

Arabinda and Sulekha Ghosal, Calcutta

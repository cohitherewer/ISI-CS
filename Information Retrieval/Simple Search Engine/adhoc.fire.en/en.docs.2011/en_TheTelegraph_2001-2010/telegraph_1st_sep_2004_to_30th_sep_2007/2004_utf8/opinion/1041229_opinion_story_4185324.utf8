 LADY RETURNS

 The iron fist of the leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party has a life of only one month. After that it degenerates into an ordinary glove. Ms Uma Bharti was suspended from the party a month ago but now she has been welcomed back into the party. The return was not caused by an apology or an expression of regret on the sannyasin?s part. The BJP president, Mr L.K. Advani, the party?s reputed man of iron, lifted the suspension order. One month ago, it was Mr Advani who had shut the party?s door on Ms Bharti?s face because of her public tantrums against the party. What is even more suprising is that Mr Advani did not even announce the revocation of the suspension order. He made Mr M. Venkaiah Naidu announce it and face the music. Mr Naidu, poor man, could not even give any reasons for taking back the woman who was a rebel only a few weeks ago. It is obvious that powerful lobbies within the BJP had been advocating the return of Ms Bharti. The task of the pro-Uma Bharti group was made easier by political and electoral considerations.

 There are sections within the BJP which feel that only Ms Bharti is capable of countering Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav in the forthcoming assembly elections in Bihar. In fact, the Bihar unit of the BJP has already declared that she will be the party?s main campaigner in the elections. This strength Ms Bharti owes to her caste position. She is among the few leaders the BJP has who belong to the ?other backward class? section of society. This particular strata is of critical importance in the Bihar elections. Her recall is directed at wooing the OBCs of Bihar. Nothing could be more ironic. Ms Bharti is a sannyasin, and has thus renounced her worldly identity. Yet her political persona is totally dependent on her caste identity, something she gave up when she accepted the calling of a sannyasin. It is obvious that Ms Bharti, the sannyasin, and Ms Bharti, the political leader, are at odds with each other. She has always made her religious vocation subservient to her role in politics. How Ms Bharti copes with the contradictions that lie within herself is her own personal business, but the BJP, by recalling her without even an apology, has made itself look ridiculous. It has shown that discipline counts for nothing within the BJP. The suspension order was all sound and fury signifying nothing. Ms Bharti?s recall signifies the BJP?s real character.

 ON A HILL FAR AWAY

 Rudrangshu Mukherjee

 A cathedral can become an enchanted place even without any divine intervention. This happened to St Paul?s Cathedral on Friday evening when the choir of Dr Graham?s Homes sang hymns and songs about Christmas. The high vaulted ceilings of the cathedral do not provide the best acoustics for music but the sacred ambience more than makes up for the quality of the sound. 

 The children sang beautifully and the voices of some of the young ones were pure and bell-like. The beauty of the singing was enhanced by the knowledge that the children were amateur singers trained by one of the masters of the school. Dr Graham?s Homes has much to recommend it and in early November it was given the award of the School that Looks Beyond in The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence. The school choir is another example of the way passion and commitment can overcome the absence of lavish resources.

 Dr Graham?s Homes grew out of the vision and the compassion of a Scotsman. Its beginnings were humble. It aimed to educate orphans and abandoned children. Even today, these remain the principal goals of the school and of those who run it. But the school has outgrown its own origins. Today it is a major presence in the field of education in the hills of north Bengal. This has been possible because of the dedication of generations of teachers and administrators who have put the education of underprivileged children high on their list of priorities. In the big academy in the sky above, Dr Graham must be happy in the way the seeds he planted have grown.

 Building up a school choir is never an easy task. The voices of children crack and deepen after a certain age. Yesterday?s baby singer maybe today?s croaking frog. A school choir by definition cannot be a static pool of talent. A choirmaster in a school needs to adapt and make do with the talent that is available at a given point of time. Shane Saviel must be congratulated for the hard work he has put in with the children. The quality of harmony he achieved among the many voices was remarkable.

 Shane Saviel?s musical imagination and perseverance were manifest in the singing of the children. One had only to hear Rebecca Peada sing out the first notes of ?God so loved the world? or Nicole Saviel hum the ending of ?Away in a Manger? to appreciate the rigorous training and practice that they had gone through. Tseten Lama?s rendering of Felis Navidad was also memorable. But these soloists were backed by some excellent harmonization by the choir.

 Music is a very special gift and it is moving to see children, who are otherwise deprived of some of the more mundane aspects of life, take to music and singing in such a wonderful way. Far away in Kalimpong, distant from the media limelight, there are teachers doing excellent work with children who most need the care and the nurturing.

 For those of us who live in cities and have come to take the gift of education for granted, a concert like the one presented by the choir of Dr Graham?s Homes at St Paul?s can only be a profoundly humbling experience. It can only be a reminder of the many debts that we as citizens owe to unknown and anonymous people who build institutions like Dr Graham?s Homes. The concert was perhaps the best celebration of the Advent of Jesus Christ.

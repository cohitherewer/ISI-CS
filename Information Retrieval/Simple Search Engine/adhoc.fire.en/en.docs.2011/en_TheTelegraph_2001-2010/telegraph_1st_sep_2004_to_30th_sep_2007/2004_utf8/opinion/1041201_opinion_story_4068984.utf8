 EAST WIND

 India?s engagement with the Association of South-east Asian Nations is finally coming of age. The ?ASEAN-India partnership for peace, progress and shared prosperity? agreement, signed by the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, and leaders of ASEAN countries at Vientiane, should provide a powerful new thrust to the relationship. The partnership agreement, signed during the third annual ASEAN-India summit, visualizes a long-term basis to the relationship and provides a coherent direction to it. It contains a multi-track action plan for boosting trade, investment, tourism, culture, sports and people-to-people contacts between India and the region. It is now critical to continue building on this relationship, which is of obvious vital national importance. The partnership agreement also provides for intensifying joint India-ASEAN efforts to combat international terrorism, drug-trafficking, arms-smuggling, human trafficking, particularly of women and children, sea piracy and moneylaundering. India and ASEAN countries have also agreed to foster closer cooperation in reforming and democratizing the United Nations and institutions under it by making them ?more reflective of the contemporary realities?.

 It has now become obvious that there are several reasons for India to pursue a coherent and sustained policy for the region. Most important, ASEAN countries offer tremendous economic opportunities to India and Indian investors. India needs to continue to expand its trade with a large number of ASEAN countries. Even with countries like Singapore and Malaysia, with which India has traditionally strong economic relations, there is space for further expansion of trade in goods and services. 

 India has defined its region of strategic importance as extending from the Malacca Straits to the Persian Gulf. Building a strong security relationship with ASEAN countries is thus of immense importance. Moreover, many of the ASEAN countries face similar challenges from terrorism and secessionism as faced by India. A collaborative strategy can yield results where unilateral policies might fail. The dividend from collaboration is already evident in India?s recent security cooperation with Myanmar, an ASEAN member country. Furthermore, India has strong cultural bonds with many of the ASEAN countries, which can be the basis for further expansion of ties. Simultaneously, there is a significant Indian minority in many of the ASEAN countries. This diaspora can provide a strong basis for vibrant relationships. Finally, India should engage with ASEAN countries, bilaterally and multilaterally, to ensure that a rising China does not jeopardize its economic and strategic interests. Unfortunately, India?s policies towards southeast Asia have often fluctuated between activism and neglect. The need now is for continued engagement at all levels as the fundamental basis of India?s ?Look East? policy.

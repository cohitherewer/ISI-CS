 THE FLOWERS OF DEATH

Maps For Lost Lovers

By Nadeem Aslam, 

Faber, pound; 6.99

If it is ever possible to say what a novel is ?about?, 

this one is about the oppressive conservatism and insularity of Islamic society, 

about how religious laws govern every aspect of the lives of Muslims ? including 

what prayers a husband should say when he is penetrating his wife and which ones 

he should say when he is ejaculating. While this may seem too reductive a summary, 

it is neither inadequate nor unfair, which says a lot about this almost-400-pages-long 

novel.

 The novel?s setting is Dasht-e-tanhaii (?The Wilderness of Solitude. The Desert of Loneliness?) ? the evocative name that the Pakistanis who live in the poor quarter of an English town have given it. The name encapsulates their sadness at having to live away from their land of the pure, among the decadent, dirty and godless Westerners. For the novelist, it also evokes the sadness of lives devastated by a religion that cares not at all for happiness, female more than male. 

 There is Chanda, killed, chopped up and burnt by her brothers for daring to live in with a man. There is Suraya, looking for a man to marry and divorce her so that she can re-marry the father of her son, who had divorced her in a fit of drunken rage. There is Mah-Jabin, packed off at sixteen to marry her cousin in Pakistan, who turns out to be a bigot and a sexual sadist. There is Kiran, who is deemed not good enough to marry the man she loves because she is a Sikh. In a way, Aslam?s novel confirms all the stereotypes about Muslim men that media reports about ?honour killings? give rise to in the West. 

 Not that men have an easy time of it if they are sensitive and atheistic like Shamas, the novel?s hero. As the local representative of the commission for racial equality, Shamas tries all he can to bring his neighbours out of the morass of poverty, ignorance and superstition. But the blight affects Shamas?s life too ? his brother is murdered for his liaison with Chanda, and he can do nothing as his children all rebel against the religious despotism of his wife, Kaukab. 

 But to be fair, the novel is lucidly and engagingly written, its prose interspersed with lugubrious, but beautiful, Urdu shairi (?You, who have gone gathering the flowers of death/ My heart?s not I, I cannot teach my heart:/ It cries when I forget?). There?s just Aslam?s partiality for adjectives that irks. Almost no noun goes by without being accompanied by a word or a phrase describing it. Thus, ?drowned glass-blades whip like tails of sperm?, brown is the ?colour of warm spices? and blood is not blood if it is not ?red as deep as dolphin?s blood?. Obviously, Aslam aims to create the right atmosphere, but the result is laboured, digressive, meandering and pointless.

 BY A FAINT SNICK

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India has narrowly escaped a political ambush. Mr Sharad Pawar, who declared himself a candidate for the presidentship of the BCCI, has no known associations with cricket. He never played the game at any recognized level, nor has he been involved in the running of any of the cricket associations at the provincial level. Politicians before Mr Pawar had attempted to come to the helm of affairs of the BCCI. The names of the late Madhavrao Scindia and, more recently, of Mr Arun Jaitley come readily to mind. But both Scindia and Mr Jaitley staked their claims on the presidentship on not only a passionate interest in cricket but also on a career of participation in their respective state-level associations. Mr Pawar has no such track record. His candidature was a project to expand his own political empire. The BCCI elections thus became an extension of the political arena with political parties openly taking sides. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) astounded everybody by announcing that it supported Mr Pawar in the BCCI elections. The fact that the elections to the Maharashtra legislative assembly are around the corner was an additional dimension to a drama that had political overtones from the very beginning. Control prevailed over cricket in the two ?Cs? of the BCCI.

 In the event, Mr Pawar lost as narrowly as the BCCI escaped its elections from being politicized along party lines. Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya, the de facto numero uno of the BCCI and its de jure chief patron, was fighting a proxy battle which he won on the strength of his own casting vote. Mr Pawar cannot derive consolation by telling himself that he would have won but for Mr Dalmiya. His battle was against Mr Dalmiya. The latter won, only just, but the elections revealed that despite his assiduous cultivation of the state associations, his position is by no means unassailable. Mr Dalmiya might well wonder if an honourable exit would not have been better than a victory for his candidate, secured through a casting vote delivered by himself. It should be noted, however, that in the course of the elections all the due processes of law were adhered to. The guards have not changed in the BCCI but even if they had, there is no guarantee that the responsibility of its running would have been given to a group of professionals.

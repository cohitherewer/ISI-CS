 THE DOOR OPENS, A LITTLE

 Arshi Khan

 More than 41 years after it became an associate member of the EEC on September 12, 1963, the European Union commission unanimously decided on October 6, 2004 to recommend that Turkey be made a full member of the EU. This is, at best, a ?conditional? yes since Turkey will be put through a series of ?monitoring and verification? exercises by the EU to find out whether it has followed up on the legal, political and economic reforms of the last five years. 

 Even while accepting that Turkey had fulfilled the ?Copenhagen Criteria? regarding democratization, rule of law and market reforms, the EU commission?s progress report expresses concern over human rights and minority rights. True, the EU has not said anything about Turkey?s 99 per cent Muslim population. But it has voiced concern over labour migration, population, poverty and ?attitudes?.

 Turkey has welcomed Brussels? decision but it has also pleaded for fairness. It is now waiting for the meeting of EU heads of state on December 17 for a final date on which to start negotiations for accession to the EU. 

 Popular disfavour

 The EU president, Romano Prodi, indicated four hurdles that may come in Turkey?s way. One, differences in income between Turkey and the EU. Two, Turkey?s record on human rights, minority rights, women rights, and freedom of religion. Three, EU aid must lead to an erosion of regional imbalances in Turkey to prevent labour migration. Four, the final decision would be taken by a referendum among the people of Europe and Turkey. This last condition is unprecedented, since a referendum was never held in the case of any member. 

 Earlier, several European leaders had expressed reservations about Turkey. The European parliament is dominated by the Christian Democrats who are opposed to Turkey?s admission. Only the liberals, socialists and Greens favour Turkey. 

 The European people have their own prejudices. Most of them see Turkey as a Muslim country where secularism is only something that the state pays lip service to. Most also consider Islam incompatible with democracy and associate it with terrorism. Therefore, the public vote would probably go against Turkey. 

 Last hurdle

 Those in favour see Turkey?s entry as serving the EU?s interests. They consider Turkey a strategic country for its borders with west Asia, Caucasus, Mediterranean and south-eastern Europe. The Turkish army is the strongest in the Nato after that of the US. Over and above Turkey?s record in secularism and democracy, the country?s parliament has approved nine reform-packages in the last five years. There is legally, complete equality between men and women. It has abolished the death penalty, lifted the ban on Kurdish language broadcasting and instructions, decriminalized adultery, reduced the influence of the armed forces in politics, and extended freedom of expression. 

 In order to boost its bid, Turkey has also made significant compromises at the regional level. It forced Rauf R. Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, to resolve conflicts through the United Nations. Turkey has also made several compromises in the Aegean disputes with Greece. In other words, Turkey has fulfilled all the conditions ? domestic and external ? made by the EU from time to time.

 But the referendum could delay Turkey?s inclusion into the EU since it would give primacy to ?attitudes? ? which continue to remain hostile. 

 However, Turkey can no longer accuse the EU of not inviting it. Also, the civilian government of the country cannot complain because in the process of seeking EU membership, it has succeeded in reducing the role of the army in Turkish politics.

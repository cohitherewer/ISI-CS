 Letters to Editor

 More sinned against

 Sir ? Raju Mukherji?s tirade against Clive Lloyd in ?Uncle Tom out of his cabin? (Nov 29) was unwarranted and in deplorable taste. Any serious follower of cricket will be aware that the ?supercat? is, and always has been, a perfect and dignified gentleman. The racial innuendo against him is, thus, quite incomprehensible. Inferring that he is motivated by the desire to denigrate the black or brown races in an effort to please the whites is ridiculous in the extreme. On the other hand, one is astonished that the International Cricket Council, whose tenets have been the guideline for Lloyd in his recent decision against Sourav Ganguly, should see fit to reverse the decision, leaving the former West Indies captain in an unenviable position. In this instance, Lloyd deserves sympathy rather than having aspersions cast on his deservedly high reputation. 

 Yours faithfully, 

D.P. Kumar, Calcutta

 State of flux

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Different touch? (Nov 19), reflects the typical lotus-eating mindset of India?s political establishment. Does Manmohan Singh seriously think that the Rs 24,000 crore economic package, coupled with a reduction in troops, can automatically remove Jammu and Kashmir?s principle scourge ? Pakistan-sponsored cross-border terrorism? His call to terrorists to abjure violence and come forward for talks has better chances of succeeding in northeast India than it has in Jammu and Kashmir. Terrorists here are hard-core mercenaries, backed by Pakistan. It would be puerile to expect these professional killers or their behind-the-scenes mentors to sit down for talks. Surely our prime minister realizes that unless terrorism is eliminated from Jammu and Kashmir, no amount of goodies will be of use, as previous prime ministers have found to their cost. Has he any plan in this regard other than pleading with Pervez Musharraf to uphold his January 2004 commitment, a herring that really was meant for the birds?

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Pratap Bhanu Mehta?s article, ?Debates and Divisions? (Nov 25), misconstrues the impact of financial incentives on Kashmir. The Kashmiris are unenthusiastic about these development projects not because they want to control them but because there are not enough new jobs being generated in the region. Contrast this with the Chinese government?s promotion of investment in Tibet and Xingjiang, which has led to a dilution of the independence movements there. In the process, China has alienated the local populace through brutal suppression. India should not repeat this mistake. It should encourage local entrepreneurs as well as businesses from other parts of India and abroad. If a reduction in coercive methods accompanies this inflow of funds, the Kashmiris will have little to protest about. Setting up a few special economic zones and reviving the traditional Kashmiri crafts will help integrate the state with the rest of India. We must create a visible material gap between Indian Kashmir and PoK to pressurize Pakistan and present a credible case to the rest of the world.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? Tension with India, on one pretext or the other, is essential for Pakistan?s military rulers to remain in power. So there is no point hoping for normal relations or for transit facilities for our goods to Afghanistan and beyond through Pakistan. The latter wants normal relations only in cricket and to build the gas pipeline, in which big money is involved. If we cannot have friendly relations beyond cricket and ghazals, let us at least be good enemies.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? The prime minister has claimed that India?s armed forces are enjoined to respect human rights (?New Kashmir in Singh vision? Nov 18). Perhaps he is unaware that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act places the army above the law, and the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act gives the police the power to detain people for up to two years without trial. Is this respect for human rights? If the prime minister truly means what he says, he would do well to withdraw these laws and begin investigation and prosecution of the army and police personnel responsible for the thousands of atrocities reported in the state. Without such steps, is it any surprise that Kashmiris remain cynical about a government that condemns militants? violence but does nothing to check its own brutality?

Yours faithfully, 

Shankar Gopalakrishnan, Kodaikanal 

 Sir ? Since independence, Kashmir has got more doles than any other state. Thus, we can be sure that the Rs 24,000 package will also fail to win their hearts. Also it is strange that India and Pakistan are giving so much importance to the Hurriyat leaders, some of whom were dreaded terrorists at one time. Are the views of the elected leaders of Kashmir not important? Pakistan wants the Hurriyat leaders to be given importance because they are its puppets. But why should we fall into the trap? 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

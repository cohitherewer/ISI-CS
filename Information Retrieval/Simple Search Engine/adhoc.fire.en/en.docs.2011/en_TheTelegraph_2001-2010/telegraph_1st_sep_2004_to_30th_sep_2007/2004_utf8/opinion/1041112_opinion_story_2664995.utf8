 RECORD OF A REMARKABLE LIFE

 Closer look

 Harold Nicolson was born in Tehran in 1886. His father, Arthur, was later to become Lord Carnock. When Harold was born his father was the head of the British Legation in Persia. Harold was thus born into a mandarin family which was later ennobled. Harold, however, was very self-conscious about the blue blood in his veins. These diaries reflect that consciousness.

 Harold went to Wellington College, a public school he hated, and then went on to Balliol, a place he grew to love despite a third in his BA. But Harold made up for his failure in Oxford by his spectacular success in the competitive examination to enter the Foreign Service. He entered the world of diplomacy as a young man with a rare command over many of the European languages. It was as a young diplomat that he met his future wife Vita Sackville-West. The Harold-Vita marriage acquired the dimensions of a legend and the two of them lovingly built up their home, Sissinghurst, in Kent.

 In his professional life, Harold was a part of the British delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. He worked in the chanceries at Tehran and Berlin, and resigned from diplomacy in 1929. He took to politics, was an MP and a junior minister for a short while in Churchill?s war cabinet. After his resignation from the Foreign Office, Harold earned his living through journalism, broadcasting and writing books. He died in 1968 six years after his wife.

 For the better part of his adult life, everyday after breakfast Harold sat down to record the events of the previous day and to reflect upon them. He wrote these (later typed) on loose foolscap sheets which he later filed. These were his diaries which are now in the library of his old college Balliol.

 Harold did not write his diaries with an eye to their eventual publication. He believed, ? la Virginia Woolf, that ?Nothing has really happened until it has been described.? For him, the description could only take place through writing. His diaries are somewhat unique since they give to readers an insider?s view of the world of diplomacy and politics during a critical period of European history. The diaries are also a record of a culture and of a vanished world. If Harold Nicolson had one foot in Whitehall, his other foot was in Bloomsbury and the exclusive cultural salons of London. He had the gift of perfect recall and the ability to capture the occasion. There is in these diaries an unforgettable description of a pre-war dinner party at which Churchill devastated Walter Lippmann, who had the temerity to suggest that Britain would be licked in the forthcoming war. Harold wrote, ?Winston is stirred by this defeatism into a magnificent oration. He sits hunched there, waving his whisky-and-soda to mark his periods, stubbing his cigar with his other hand.?

 Harold Nicolson?s prose had the hint of the classical. He was quick to note social nuances. His sense of humour was laconic. His values were always a tad above his own social position. He fashioned himself as a Whig aristocrat which he definitely was not. His younger son has edited the diaries with loving care.

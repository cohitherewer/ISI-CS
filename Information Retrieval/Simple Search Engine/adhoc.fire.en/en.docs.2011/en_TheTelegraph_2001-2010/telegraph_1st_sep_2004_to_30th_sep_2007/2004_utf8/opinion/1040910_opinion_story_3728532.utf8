 FEW TAKERS FOR HINDI

 Language bias

When you look at the pathetic state of Hindi textbooks in the social sciences (there are virtually none in the sciences, technology and medicine), a question springs to mind. If the Japanese book industry can flourish on translations of standard British and American textbooks, why can?t this be possible in the Hindi heartland? After all, the market is huge if you go by university enrolment figures and any enterprising publisher, in collaboration with university teachers, can make a killing in the textbook market of history, economics, sociology and philosophy. But more than 50 years after independence, the Hindi academic market is moribund. Why?

 There are four reasons. One, translators are paid very poorly in India. Two, there are few translators who are equally proficient in English and Hindi, apart from being conversant in the subject. Three, the Hindi market is unorganized and does not follow the rules of the trade with regard to discounts and credits. It is a sort of barter system: You-take-two-of-mine-I?ll-take-two-of-yours.

 Four, because the Indian book trade reflects the state of the academic world, it is the poor quality of the academia that is responsible for the sluggish book market. If you can get away with class notes and a couple of made-easies, why bother to delve deeper? 

 Translators in India are paid on a per-page basis ? usually Rs 10, going up to Rs 20 if the translator is ?well-known? ? unlike in the West and Japan where the fees are much higher, with a share of the royalties thrown in. No translator abroad would agree to the ?per-page? formula, because translations are acts of re-creation which cannot be calculated on the basis of wordage.

 But the structure of the Hindi book trade is the biggest hurdle. First, there are few exclusively Hindi bookshops in Lucknow, Allahabad, Varanasi and Patna, the so-called ?temples of learning? at one time. The bookshops double up as news-stands, stationery and even general stores. So how is the publisher to distribute his stock? It is physically impossible to carry his titles to every library (in any case, libraries in the Hindi belt are starved of funds). A sustained promotional campaign would be very expensive, with little likelihood of adequate returns. No Hindi publisher/bookseller (often they are one and the same) has been able to survive on retailing Hindi textbooks. Even state-sponsored institutions like the National Book Trust have not been great success stories: they are wholly or partly subsidized.

 Macmillan India (its experience provides much of the basis for this article) had entered the Hindi world and invested over Rs 5 crore over 12 years, 1970-1982. But the whole venture collapsed. Were the titles translated the wrong ones; or the prices too high and discounts too low; or the marketing too sluggish? Perhaps all three, to an extent. But it was also the apathy of the Hindi academics who refused to consider the translations and recommend them to students. And without such recommendations, no bookseller will stock.

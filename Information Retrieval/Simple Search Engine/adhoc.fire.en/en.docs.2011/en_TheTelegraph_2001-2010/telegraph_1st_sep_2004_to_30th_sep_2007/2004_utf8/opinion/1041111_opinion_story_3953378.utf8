 MORE ALMS FOR THE POOR

 Srinjay Chakravarti

 The global debt relief programme ? Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative ? started by the World Bank and the IMF, was extended by two more years in early October. This signals that all hope is not lost for the third world. But however good the news, it is disheartening to note that the programme is in its eighth year, and the goal of liquidating all unsustainable debts is still out of reach.

 As a result of gargantuan debt burdens, many impoverished economies are losing out on the gains of economic development. Vulnerable groups have been pauperized and social protection frameworks undermined, triggering regional instability and conflict. An added spin-off in African countries is the acceleration of the HIV-AIDS pandemic.

 The 50 poorest nations in the world have a combined population of 700 million. Iraq is the world?s most heavily indebted country in terms of debt per head. Its total debt is estimated at around $120 billion. Its net debt at the end of this year will be approximately 560 per cent of the GDP. Without debt reduction, Iraq?s debt service would be over 35 per cent of its 2004 GDP. 

 Close shave

 Yet, unlike countries such as Congo ? which has got a 90 per cent debt write-off ? Iraq should be able to manage on its own, given that it sits on the world?s second largest oil reserves. But few countries have the natural advantage. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people living in extreme poverty has practically doubled from 164 million in 1981 to 314 million in 2001. What makes the data more shocking is that the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day had almost halved, from 40 per cent to 21 per cent of the world?s population during the period.

 Obviously, overall economic growth is skewed between regions, with east and south Asia putting up a better performance. If the UN goal of cutting by half the number of those living in abject penury by 2015 is to be met, the initiative has to be taken by developed nations. The most important thrust of this is to increase development aid, write off debt and promote direct investment. 

 Other measures include easing trade barriers to enable imports, mostly agricultural products from the poorest countries. Also, essential medicines should be made available at the least possible cost. These would have to be complemented by efficient governance and investment in health, education and basic infrastructure.

 Zero debt

 That wealthy nations are not fulfilling their obligations was pointed out by the World Bank president, James Wolfensohn, at a UN meet on trade, aid, debt and investment. The world spends 14 times more on defence than on development assistance, he said. Such distorted distribution of resources has to be corrected if poverty is to be alleviated.

 Rich industrialized nations are looking at ways to write off the entire debt of some nations. Twenty-four countries have qualified for the HIPC initiative, of which 14 have received maximum permitted debt relief. But 100 per cent forgiveness is needed and there is still a long way to go. The UK?s suggestion to revalue IMF?s massive gold stocks, which could help raise money for further debt relief, might be a way out.

 The US has promised upto $5 billion a year in aid through the Millennium Challenge programme by 2006. Under this programme, which comes with strings attached, the US offers generous cash rewards for (what else?) economic and democratic reforms. Seven new countries have been chosen for participation in the ?Threshold Program? for displaying a commitment to reforms. These include East Timor, Albania and the former East African colonies. But it remains to be seen whether the US will keep its promises.

 Got to be on his plane 

 Gouri Chatterjee

 All this while, the press had described the prime minister as hesitant, reserved, squirming under the arclights. But that was the view gleaned from a distance, at press meets, in parliament, on his way in and out of high-powered meetings. 

 Up close and personal on Air India One (a poor man?s Air Force One, which is the call sign of the official aircraft of the US president), Manmohan Singh emerges transformed. He is, reportedly, ?disarmingly normal? (Hindustan Times), with ?almost boyish charm? in white shirt and black trousers in place of his usual kurta-pyjamas (Economic Times), ready to indulge in ?light banter? (The Statesman)?

 Every prime ministerial foreign trip, whatever the occasion (the UN general assembly?s annual ritual hardly qualifies as an earth-shattering event), is a voyage of such avid discoveries for the accompanying journalists (editors or owners most). 

 It couldn?t be otherwise. Really dramatic diplomatic events that are deservedly media events too, such as Nixon?s trip to China or Clinton?s visit to Vietnam, are always few and far between. The closest in recent years for us would be Vajpayee?s bus-ride to Lahore and Rajiv Gandhi?s trip to Deng?s China. 

 But that doesn?t stop the press from paying good money (only the plane-ride is free) and feeling terribly upset if one doesn?t get a seat on the plane (which is by invitation only). If you?re not on the PM?s plane you?re not on the media A-list. ?I have accompanied many prime ministers,? is practically de rigueur on a senior editor?s CV. So the current trip, too, finds many editors hopping mad at being left behind.

 Like all status symbols (a Rolls Royce is a hardy car too), this too can be justified. It?s a great way to get to know the PM and his team, every hack will tell you, and build contacts that can come in handy back on terra firma. So now you know, it?s not just the free bubbly that makes reports from Air India One go gush-gush.

 Page 3 with brains

 This must be what foreign knowhow is all about. The first issue of Time Out Mumbai, the latest progeny of Time Out London, is like a breath of fresh air over the foul-smelling lifestyle journalism of India.

 The rising tide of Page 3s has resulted in newspapers giving over more and more pages to such news, but not in journalists who know what to do with them. Rather, pretty young things with little training and no exposure have a free run and write banal, vapid pieces that give the whole genre of lifestyle journalism such a bad name.

 It?s not that the ?Time Out treatment? is a model of investigative journalism. Its mix is still large parts of fashion, food and films stirred with bits of high culture (galleries, theatres, etc.). But the packaging is imaginative, the writing has depth, the design wholly functional. Presumably, the real power lies in the hands of the managing editor, Andrew Humphreys, although the editor, to satisfy government rules, is Naresh Fernandes. 

 On the wrong side

 If the media and governments are supposed to be adversaries, Alex Perry and his Time magazine must be doing something right to have got on the wrong side of two successive governments in New Delhi. He enraged one by portraying the prime minister as ?Sleeping at the Wheels?. The then ruling BJP had ridiculed him as ?just a travel writer? who didn?t have it in him to handle stories meant for the big boys. He has annoyed another now by claiming that this prime minister is ready to compromise over the LoC. For Perry, the crowning glory will be if the BJP picks up his cudgels to play its oppositional role to the hilt.

 Letters to Editor

 Nobody?s child

 Sir ? Passing the buck, as the authorities at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital did when confronted with the barely-alive newborn girl dumped under an ambulance, will not help put a stop to female infanticide. Nor will the blanket ban on sex determination tests further the cause much. These are the home truths one can discern from the report, ?Dogs, not humans, want girl child? (Oct 7). How can a mother disregard society?s preference for sons and start favouring a girl child? We have fine-tuned the art of hypocrisy and have become experts at sermonizing. We, irrespective of our educational and financial status, simultaneously pray before the goddess and engage in female infanticide or foeticide. Let us at least admit that we all share in this great social hypocrisy. For simply becoming aware of this fact is the first step to soul-searching. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sekhar Basu Mallik, Calcutta 

 Power game

 Sir ? Chandrasekhar Dasgupta raises some interesting issues in the article, ?Beyond challenge? (Oct 6). But there are other aspects of the United States of America?s superpower status that bothers me. First, would the European Union spend enough on defence to challenge the US? I think not. Look at how it made the US responsible for the collective security of Europe and forced the same troops into a quiet exit after the threat disappeared. 

 The US today possesses a military might unprecedented in history. But even in the darkest days of the Cold War, the US establishment, with the exception of Joe McCarthy, felt nowhere near the kind of visceral fear that it does today. That, of course, was an outcome of the balance of fear. Dasgupta laments the passing of those days. I am certain American strategic planners look back to those days with misty-eyed nostalgia. The US knew where the Soviet first- and second-strike missile batteries were located. The need was to task the battery of anti-ballistic missiles to the first-strike lot and the submarine-launched ballistic missiles to the second lot. Both sides knew this and nothing went beyond vigorous sabre-rattling. But now, what do you target against a puff of dust? This makes the world far less stable. 

 The problem is compounded by the fact that the US is far from being an economic powerhouse. In fact, without the support of the east Asian economies, the dollar would have lost much of its sheen. Maybe all it will take is another coup by a major player in the money markets to bring it down. If that happens, the fallout will very likely be far worse than the crash of 1929. What action will the US then take? Perhaps, it may wish to parlay military might to economic power. If they do, the consequence, after all jaw-jaw fails, could be an economic boycott of the US by the rest of the world. The consequences of that are too horrific to contemplate. But that is what gives a raison d?etre to think-tanks of the sort that Dasgupta belongs to. More power to his intellect.

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Datta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Chandrashekhar Dasgupta states that if certain organizations unite they could challenge the US. The United Nations has become a puppet in the hands of the US. The United Kingdom, in both Iraq and Afghanistan, has shown that it is weak-kneed. All other countries have kowtowed to the US over the non-proliferation treaty. On the one hand, it is trying to force recent nuclear powers to sign the NPT; on the other, the Bush regime is making nuclear bombs that can bust bunkers. Economic stability and military power have made the US a superpower. Although in the case of Iraq, many fear a Vietnam-like retreat. Be that as it may, the US will retain its position without competition and the EU or any Asian country is not so powerful as to challenge the US. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abdus Samad, Incheon, South Korea

 Crushed to death

 Sir ? The Kishanganj district magistrate promised a compensation of Rs 2,000 for the boy who died after being run over by Mohammad Taslimuddin?s escort vehicle (?Minister convoy crushes boy?, Oct 7). On learning of the incident, the Union minister asked the district administration to give a further Rs 10,000. But is this all the price we put on a human life? How would the district magistrate or the minister feel if his son had died in such an accident and he was offered such a paltry sum? Money does not ease the pain of a tragic loss such as this but a kind word always does. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ali Ashraf, Sydney

 Sir ? How can ministers call themselves representatives of the people when they cannot even give a helping hand to a dying boy? Will a compensation of Rs 10,000 bring back 10-year-old Raju to life again? Ministers and high officials who are allowed to use a red light atop their vehicles, should also be given ? free of cost, of course ? moral science books to remind them of their social duties. The red light may justifiably be used when a minister is headed on official duty, not when he is out on personal business. Also, there should be a check on the use of red lights to ensure they are not misused.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

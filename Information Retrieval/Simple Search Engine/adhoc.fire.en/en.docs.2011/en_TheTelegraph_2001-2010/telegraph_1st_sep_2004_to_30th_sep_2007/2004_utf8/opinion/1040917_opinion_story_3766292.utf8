 DELAYED ACTION

 Delay suits some; it has always suited sexual criminals. Ironically perhaps, it is in sexually violent crimes, such as rape, that the victim may often find it difficult to speak up at the very first opportunity, while this delay in filing a first information report is turned to the offender?s convenience. The Supreme Court?s firm assertion that delay in filing the FIR cannot be used as a pretext to evade the charge articulates a major concern in the official procedures associated with rape. Delay in filing the FIR is not against the law. The fact that it is often used to cast doubt on the authenticity of the complaint indicates the laxness with which society views rape. The Supreme Court?s pronouncement is encouraging, although neither the law nor its highest dispensers would be able to change social attitudes in a day.

 The court?s clarification came in the context of an astonishing high court judgment. A teacher had repeatedly abused a student of Class IV who could not complain out of fear. The crime was discovered only when she was found to be pregnant. Although the trial court had sentenced the offender, the high court, on appeal, felt that the delay in filing the FIR was enough to give him the benefit of doubt. Moreover ? and this is the most astonishing part ? it had said that the child might have consented. This is an example of the perverse social attitudes that confuse applications of the law on rape. The blindness towards the power equation between teacher and student, the possible innocence of the child and the terrible physical and psychological damage to her is not novel. Besides, the victim was a minor, nothing she said could be regarded as consent in law. The law is very strict about custodial rape. The Supreme Court?s statement emphasizes the seriousness of the crime and the damage it causes the victim. That the victim?s sense of being disregarded and humiliated, and of her personal sanctity being violated, have been specifically mentioned indicates that times are changing, since the exclusive focus in earlier times was on a woman?s virtue and honour. But the court has not abandoned notions of ?honour? and ?reputation?. These suggest that the victim should be ashamed of a crime someone else commits. The word ?chastity? is most disconcerting in this series. It invokes ideas of purity that remain current only because of the inferior status of women in Indian society.

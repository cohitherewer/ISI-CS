 Paperback Pickings

 Making modernity popular

City flicks: Indian cinema and the urban experience 

(Seagull, Rs 300) edited by Preben Kaarsholm is a collection of 

academic essays on how Indian films ?have not only portrayed the process of urbanization 

as a struggle towards coming to terms with and formulating agendas for modernity, 

but also as reactions to and counter-programmes against this process?. There are 

pieces, among others, by Moinak Biswas on Nimai Ghosh?s Chinnamul and the 

Left Cultural Movement in the Forties, by Sudipta Kaviraj on images of the city 

in literature and films, by Ashish Rajadhyaksha on the ?Bollywoodization? of Indian 

cinema, and by Tejaswini Niranjana on masquerade in the Nineties Telugu vigilante 

films of Vijayasanthi. ?In conditions of widespread poverty and illiteracy, movie 

spectacles in India have fulfilled a role supplementing that of literature and 

print culture in making modernity popular.?

The love song of Alfred Hitchcock (Indialog, 

Rs 195) by Maythil Radhakrishnan is V.C. Harris?s translation of three 

Malayali novellas: ?Hitchcock?s Intervention? and ?Music is a Time-Art?, apart 

from the title piece, all written in the Nineties. ?The Love Song? explores questions 

of love and death, which are further complicated in the next one. The last novella 

is loaded with allusions: Browning, Bach, Mozart, fugues, structures. But there 

is also the plague and three sanitary inspectors. The translator?s introduction 

goes over the top with praise, and also has a ?theoretical go? at the stories. 

But there are things like, ?Maythil Radhakrishnan is a strange guy. Wonderfully 

strange. How else can you make sense of, and feel excited by, the strange and 

brilliant tales that he tells??

Great puffin bites (Puffin, Rs 275) 

by Margaret Clarke collects three international children?s bestsellers, 

illustrated by Terry Denton. ?S.N.A.G? is about thin and weedy Snag who faints 

at the sight of blood, but is sent to gladiator school. The eponymous ?Silent 

Knight? has two fears: meeting a fierce dragon and Rusting Up, both of which come 

true when his horse, Gallbladder, runs off into the dark night. In ?Mummy?s Boy?, 

Knot tries to make his mountain-of-blubber uncle, Pharaoh Gut, lose weight because 

their lives and stress levels depend upon it.

 STOP THAT

 Those who claim a right only to abuse it end up raising questions about the right itself. This seems to be the case with the debate over the right to strike. There was clearly a note of anxiety in the resolution that the ruling leftists moved in the West Bengal assembly in order to protect the right to strike. They felt that the right was under threat and that the Union government should take steps to give it constitutional protection. That the opposition parties ? the Congress and the Trinamool Congress ? did not support the resolution is only peripheral to the central debate. It is impossible to miss the irony, though, in their complaint that the resolution did not seek to protect the ?people?s right to organize bandhs?. It is a sign of the changing times that the leftists, who made bandh such a dirty word, should now give it short shrift. Obviously, the movers of the resolution had little choice but to steer clear of fresh conflicts with the judiciary, which had declared bandhs illegal. 

 The resolution may have unwittingly raised a more fundamental question about the right to strike. It revives the central debate as to whose right it is anyway. In the purist interpretation, it is a bargaining tool for workers in a particular trade. Trade unions are supposed to use the right in the name of the workers and with the specific objective of procuring for them better terms of employment. Most governments have laws enshrining the right as such. But the way political parties and trade unions call strikes without the approval of the majority of workers makes a mockery of the right. Worse, parties routinely call strikes on purely political issues that have little relevance to workers? interests. In fact, such calls and the force that goes into implementing them infringe on the people?s fundamental right to liberty. It should be a good omen for Bengal that Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee now wants to rid it of the ?disease? of bandhs. Unless the abuses are stopped, strikes would continue to stink.

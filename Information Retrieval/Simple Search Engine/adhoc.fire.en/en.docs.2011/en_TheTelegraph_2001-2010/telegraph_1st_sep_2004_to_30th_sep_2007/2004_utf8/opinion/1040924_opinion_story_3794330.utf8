 DOING IT THEIR OWN WAY

Gandhi, Bose, Nehru and the Making of the Modern Indian 

Mind 

By Reba Som, 

Viking, Rs 350

Too many books have been written on India?s freedom 

struggle to leave space for fresh attempts, unless it is marked by convincing 

writing and new insights into perhaps the most turbulent period of Indian history. 

Reba Som?s work ventures into this difficult terrain. It takes up three important 

leaders of the freedom movement, namely Gandhi, Bose and Nehru and tries to show 

their different approaches to the freedom struggle as well as their underlying 

similarities. Besides, it attempts to take up Bose?s case in a different way, 

and tries to locate him in the freedom struggle on a par with the other two important 

figures. 

 Som?s book consists of just four chapters, in which she analyses the similarities and differences of the thoughts and approaches of Gandhi, Nehru and Bose. Or rather, the book effectively contains only three chapters because the first simply sums up in a few pages, the history of India from independence to the present times. 

 The focus is more on Bose and Gandhi, than on Nehru and Bose. Som labours hard to establish that despite marked differences of outlook and opinion in their approach to the freedom struggle, Bose and Gandhi came closer to each other in thought than is popularly believed. And that awareness of their difference of opinion led Nehru to keep a distance from Gandhi despite the latter choosing Nehru to lead the way. 

 Som tries to establish her argument by citing historical events. Her approach is to juxtapose facts rather than indulge in lengthy discussions and analyses. In the second chapter she tries to show where the three were at variance, Bose and Gandhi in particular. Her narrative reads like a well-written essay. The third chapter dwells on the convergences of the thoughts of Bose and Gandhi and shows how the two men came close to each other. Gandhi advocated non-violence and Bose looked for more aggressive ways to end foreign rule. Som thinks that Bose matured with time and Gandhi?s ideas about Bose were significantly altered after the latter?s escape from India. 

 Som?s admiration for Bose can be understood, but in writing about him, she seems to cast a shadow on Nehru. The usual understanding is that Bose was closer to Nehru in his views about freedom, rather than to Gandhi, whose thoughts and ways of putting his ideas into practice were misunderstood by many. Som might be breaking new grounds here. 

 The book arouses historical sense. Som?s readable prose makes the book a good read and whets the appetite for more analysis of the different strands that made Indian nationalism.

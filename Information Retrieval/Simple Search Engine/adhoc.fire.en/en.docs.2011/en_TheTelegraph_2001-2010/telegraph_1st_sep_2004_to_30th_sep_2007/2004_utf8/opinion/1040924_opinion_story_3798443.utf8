 THEIR UNION IS PLEASURE

ARDHANARISHVARA, THE ANDROGYNE: PROBING THE GENDER 

WITHIN (Rupa, Rs 1,500) by Alka Pande is a wide-ranging and nuanced study 

of sexual ambivalence as played out in terms of fluid gender roles, in private 

and public life. Pande starts with the philosophy and iconography of androgyny 

in classical Indian art and literature, sacred and profane, and then opens out 

her study to ?tangible reality? ? the contemporary worlds of not only transvestites, 

transsexuals, eunuchs, hermaphrodites and homosexuals (particularly kothis), 

but also of dancers, singers and actors. There are chapters on bisexual role-playing 

in Indian cinema, as well as treatments of gender fluidity by modern Indian painters, 

sculptors and photographers. This is Anita Khemka?s photograph of childhood friends, 

Vijay and Raju, grooming themselves.

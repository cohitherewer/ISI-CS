 CLEANING UP

 All power corrupts, cadre power corrupts most corrosively. The Left Front government has a strange propensity to deploy cadre to handle situations that are best left to the administration. A recent example of this is the announcement that the chaos that prevails in the pre-paid taxi-stand at Howrah Station will be cleared up with the help of party-workers. This scheme was propounded by the state tourism minister, Mr Dinesh Dakua. There is no doubt that Howrah Station, at the best of times, is a nightmare for those trying to get a taxi. At night, it becomes worse than a nightmare as the station is taken over by goons and hoodlums. There is a flourishing coolie-tout-cabdriver nexus working to hoodwink travellers. For most people, the entry into Calcutta is an eminently forgettable experience. The bullying and the deception at Howrah Station happen in the presence of the police who do nothing, thus strengthening the suspicion that they are part of the vicious nexus. The state administration should take the police to task, forcing policemen to perform their duty. Instead of doing this, the tourism minister has decided to call in the party cadre.

 This not only avoids all accountability but also hands over an administrative duty to a political party. There is another suspicion that needs to be voiced in this context. The confidence of the minister in his party-workers lends itself to the conclusion that the latter not only have knowledge of the nexus but may also be part of it. The party?s links with the lumpen proletariat are a well-known, but not a well-advertised, fact. The party will deploy its force for the pujas and after that, the situation will revert back to the prevailing practices of extortion. In this way, the party will earn itself a good name but, in the long term, the goons and touts will be allowed to make their pickings. This is a deplorable situation, which seems to have the administration?s blessings.

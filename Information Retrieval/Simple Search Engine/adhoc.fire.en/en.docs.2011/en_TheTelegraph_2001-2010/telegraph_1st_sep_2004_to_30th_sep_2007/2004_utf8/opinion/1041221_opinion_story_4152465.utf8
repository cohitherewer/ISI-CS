 ONE KIND OF DEATH WISH

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Two simple things became clear while I lay in my hospital bed recovering from surgery ? that all cricket teams should take to wearing white like they used to in the old days ? it is so much more elegant ? and that there is nothing to watch on Indian television that is as inspiring as reading books. We really have not got our act together when it comes to the small box. The only amazing statement was from a senior Hindutva propagator who said he was dead against the right to die regardless of the circumstances, even if the situation is terminal. I always thought those gentlemen and women believed in the transmigration of the soul and reincarnation, so euthanasia should be acceptable within certain stringent parameters. 

 Euthanasia of another kind seems to be endorsed by our politicians. The left parties have been making life impossible for Manmohan Singh and the UPA government. Their stalling tactics are as frustrating as those of the opposition. It is as though they have planned the strategy of not allowing the promises made at the hustings to become realities. They are unable to allow a departure from their ?stuck-in- a-warp? ideology to a fresh approach, a new social and economic ideology that may be more successful in delivering the goods to Bharat and India. They seem unwilling to step aside, think anew, to achieve exactly the same goals that their mantras were meant to. 

 Inner resources

 Since the era of Jawaharlal Nehru, India has not been in such a difficult situation. Many governments have experimented with their notions of nationhood, with polarized ideologies, with uncompromising and undemocratic policies. Call it experimentation or what you may, but the time has come to make the correctives and put in place a viable, energetic renewal, one that meets the demands of changing market forces. This does not mean a rightwing, pro-middle class and rich agenda because creative thinking and application can change the lives and infrastructures of rural India as well. The poor must and will be addressed as a priority, but the left must understand that new thinking and a fresh methodology may be necessary to bring about growth in both the constituencies. Failed applications of the left must be set aside. Manmohan Singh is a prime minister who can and will put the first few steps of the correctives in place. Let him do so. Haul him up if he does not. But for all our sakes, do not stall every idea, every thought, every move. 

 This constant attack by representatives of the left on the prime minister and his government, smacks of bad taste. It is as though they are wary of being shown up for not having delivered the goods themselves, if in fact Manmohan Singh does manage the corrective and change. But to go on and on in the manner that we are witness to is unacceptable. 

 There was a snippet in the papers the other day where a politburo member of the CPI(M) was quoted as saying that he was not really interested in culture. Scary. Our culture is what has kept India stable and compassionate despite the indignities the majority of our people have had to bear. Neglecting this fundamental of society is dangerous. Alas, both the present left and the UPA have put both culture and tourism on the back-burner. These are two sure-shot areas for both revenue and employment generation. Qatar has understood this but India has not. Culture and tourism should be united under one head and be made the third most important economic ministry. Why are we so careless about the obvious strengths and money-spinning areas? If the exchequer does not have enough resources for all the social needs of India, use its intrinsic strengths to generate it. Cease to treat culture and tourism with contempt. Make India a top of the line destination, no holds barred.

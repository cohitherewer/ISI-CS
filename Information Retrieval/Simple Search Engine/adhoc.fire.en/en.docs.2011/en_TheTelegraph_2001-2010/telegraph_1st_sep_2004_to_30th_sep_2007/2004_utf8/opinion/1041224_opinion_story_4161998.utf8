 FOR EFFECT

 - Living with a contradiction

 Speaking out

Confessions of a secular fundamentalist 

By Mani Shankar Aiyar, 

Penguin, Rs 425

There is a paradox embedded in the epithet that Mani 

Shankar Aiyar chooses to describe himself. ?Secular fundamentalist?? is actually 

an oxymoron. A fundamentalist is invariably dogmatic and intolerant. A secular 

person is tolerant and open-minded. The notion of secularism, in fact, arose in 

history in opposition to the fundamentalism of the Christian Church. The church 

of Rome and even the Protestant Churches that broke away from it refused to accept 

that the domain of the state could be distinct and separate from the power and 

the influence of the Church. The growth of the secular tradition from around the 

18th century sought to make a clear demarcation between religion and politics. 

The former was pushed into the private lives of individuals and public affairs 

thus freed from the influence of religion. The secular and the sacred operated 

on two very different registers. In terms of intellectual history, the development 

of secular ideas was linked to the emergence of liberal ideas and the high noon 

of individualism. Respect for the views of others was inherent in the very idea 

of secularism. Fundamentalism had no place in such a corpus of ideas.

 One suspects that Aiyar rather enjoys this contradiction. He also ignores the European roots of the idea of secularism. In the Indian spin given to secularism, the separation between secular and the sacred is not that marked. Instead, secularism in India has drawn on the tradition of toleration that was part of the European secular and liberal tradition. The greatest upholders of secularism in India were all profoundly religious people ? think, as Aiyar, indeed does, of Mahatma Gandhi and his Gurudev, Rabindranath Tagore. If Aiyar sees himself as belonging to this genealogy ? and I think he does ? then nothing could be more at odds with the ideas of Gandhi and Tagore than the notion of fundamentalism. 

 The point I am trying to make is more than a semantic quibble or a piece of intellectual pettyfoggery. There is within Aiyar one persona that is deeply committed to the traditions of Indian secularism. This commitment is the driving force of his politics and is also at the core of the values he lives by. But there is another Aiyar who is constantly striving for effect ? the St Stephen?s undergraduate who refuses to grow up, the smart alec whose world ends with the one-liner. Thus Mani Shankar Aiyar would rather live with a contradiction like ?secular fundamentalist?? because it is catchy; he refuses to think through the contradiction.

 Having stated a major ? or should one say fundamental? ? reservation, I want to recommend this book?s relentless polemic against communalists and its passionate advocacy of secularism. Aiyar?s polemic is at its best in his destruction of Arun Shourie through an imaginary conversation with him. The choice of subject is significant since the mild-spoken Shourie is not usually associated with the pernicious knickerwallahs but is no less an upholder of Hindutva. This serves as a small prologue to Aiyar?s analysis of secularism and to his onslaught against communalism.

 Aiyar makes a distinction in the two levels at which Hindu communalism operates. One is the overtly political. This is the space in which the Bharatiya Janata Party is active and it even occasionally wins elections. The other is the more insidious way in which Hindutva as an ideology is spreading among a particular class and undermining the secular fabric of Indian nationhood. The former, Aiyar thinks, is not too important since an outright victory for the BJP can only happen if there is ?an economic disaster or political cataclysm such as the Great Depression that brought Hitler to power.?? The shortcut that Aiyar employs here only emphasizes how easily the distinction between the two levels can become blurred. The shortcut is the facile linking of the Great Depression to Hitler?s rise to power. Such an analysis underplays the support that Hitler and the Nazis enjoyed among the German people. Hitler, after all, came to power through an electoral process and had the support of social and political forces represented by leaders like von Papen. The rise of fascism ? and that is what Hindutva and the BJP stand for ? is a complex historical process and nothing can be more erroneous and fatal than linking its rise to one cataclysmic event.

 The strength and the weakness of Aiyar?s book both spring from the same source. The book, as the title suggests, is in the nature of a testament. It has all the passion and the commitment of such a document and this is supposed to make up for the relative absence of hard analysis. The focus of the testament is at times lost because of Aiyar?s foray into foreign fields like Israel and Yugoslavia. As someone who does not share Aiyar?s bubbling optimism about Indian society?s capacity to eradicate the influence of Hindutva, I nonetheless welcome this book. In the battle against communalism and for secularism ? a battle for civilization, in fact ? it is difficult to think of a better comrade than Mani Shankar Aiyar.

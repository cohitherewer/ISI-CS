 RITE OF RIGHTS

 The proposed employment guarantee bill has an obvious economic angle. What is being ignored in the debate is another equally important aspect, that of rights. The bill proposes to make rural employment for 100 days every year a legal right. A person who is willing to work and demands work has to be given a job for at least 100 days per annum. This right and its implications need to be explored. The most important question is whether rural employment can at all be a right and whether such a right is at all enforceable. There exists in India a guaranteed right to education, but this in no way ensures that all children of school-going age are actually in schools. One important feature of any right is the consequence of transgressing such a right. This remains vague in the context of guaranteed rural employment. Who will be penalized for a breach of the right? If the rural employment scheme remains unimplemented and if nobody is punished for this, then over time the right will become meaningless. The right to education is already on that slippery slope. Rights need to be taken seriously. In India, this is often not the case even among activists with the most noble aims and intentions.

 Rights, in jurisprudence, are always predicated upon duties. The converse is equally true: duties flow from rights. But the duties side of the roster in the right to rural employment has not been touched upon in any of the discussions. There has been no discussion about the failure to perform the duties that are tied to the right to work for 100 days. This leads to the suspicion, voiced in the previous paragraph, that this particular right is not being taken seriously. This suspicion is reinforced by the fact that the guarantees are being extended to only 150 backward districts. Moreover, no time-table for implementation has been mooted. One apparent reason for not taking the right seriously is the costs involved. The government has scaled down the drain on the exchequer to Rs 10,000 crore per annum. The right to rural employment, if taken seriously, can make a dent of nearly Rs 40,000 crore every year. A diluted right, such as the one proposed, keeps both populists and a severe drain on the fisc at bay. The economy of rights has thus been an important part of this piece of decision-making. The purity of rights has been diluted by economic compulsions.

 Paperback Pickings

 Does the Queen pick her nose?

Granta 87: Jubilee! (Granta, ?9.99) celebrates the 25th anniversary of this magazine of ?new writing?. After an excellent account of the magazine?s history by its current editor, Ian Jack, there are, among other things, the opening of Martin Amis?s screenplay of Jane Austen?s Northanger Abbey, fiction by Helen Simpson, William Boyd and Paul Auster, a piece on Bollywood by Pankaj Mishra and one on Qutubuddin Ansari by Amit Chaudhuri. There is a photo-feature, rich with English gloom, by Toby Glanville, who followed the Granta river with his camera from its source to its meeting with the Great Ouse at Ely. This is how Jan Morris?s ?Perchance to Pick One?s Nose? begins: ?This is what I dreamed. It was a short dream. I dreamed that Elizabeth said to me, casually over our coffee, ?By the way, when you had the paper held up before your face before supper, was it because you were picking your nose, and didn?t want me to see?? I had to admit that it was. ?I have to admit that it was. It?s such an ugly thing to do, isn?t it, but sometimes I find it necessary. My nose gets so stuffed up. Do you suppose everyone does it? Does the Queen pick her nose when nobody?s looking?? ?I?m quite sure she does,? Elizabeth said, and there the matter dropped.?

Keywords: Experience (Vistar, Rs 195) 

edited by Nadia Tazi is a multicultural exploration of the various implications 

and histories of the idea of experience. There are contributors from Africa, America, 

the Arab world, China, Europe and India. The key questions addressed in this little 

book are: How does experience issue forth from events in China and in what way 

is it inexpressible? Is it still pertinent to oppose scientific experience, the 

experience lived in psychoanalytic treatment, with what Kant calls the ?judgment 

of experience?? Why has this term acquired such imaginary bulk in the portrayal 

that America has of itself?

Vinegar Sunday (Indialog, Rs 195) by 

Kankana Basu is a collection of short stories, most of which are set in a 

Bengali middle-class dystopia called Halfway House. ?According to the postman...the 

house is halfway to the railway station from the postoffice, halfway to the fish-market 

from the station (an important point for Bengali residents) and the residents 

a bunch of near-lunatics.? The stories are written in a deliberately plain style, 

and are a collage of strange and sublime addresses, interpreted maladies and shadow 

lines. It is difficult to decide whether the stories are unremarkable or about 

being unremarkably remarkable.

The red letters: My father?s enchanted period (Penguin, 

Rs 250) by Ved Mehta is about the author?s discovery of his father?s 

love affair, in the Thirties, with a married woman called Rasil, who was also 

a close friend of Ved?s mother. This is the eleventh, and last, volume in Mehta?s 

?Continents of Exile? series, about which he writes, in an extraordinary fit of 

self-explication: ?The series is predicated on the notion that the more particular 

a story, the more universal it is; and thus although the work is ostensibly autobiographical, 

it tells a cross-cultural story of India, England, and America. At the same time, 

it is also an intellectual voyage, which explores themes of family and love, journalism 

and psychoanalysis, among others. The story itself spans the twentieth century, 

with parts of it reaching back to the nineteenth.?

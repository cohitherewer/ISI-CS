 UNORGANIZED

 Criminals are happiest when the administration is undecided. And that is exactly the message being conveyed by the divergent views of the Centre and some states on laws against terror. The United Progressive Alliance government?s decision to withdraw the Prevention of Terrorism Act has prompted the Gujarat government to propose a law along the lines of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act. A state is free to decide the level of threat perception within its own boundaries and evolve measures accordingly. But in this case, it is obvious that politics is playing too large a part in the decision-making for the question to be considered from a disinterested perspective. It is not only Gujarat, but also Madhya Pradesh, which is making noises of the same kind. Both states are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. In one, the chief minister is under a cloud for his role in the killings of minorities in 2002, and in the other, the former chief minister was charged with inciting a communal conflict during a flag-raising ceremony.

 Such credentials do little to soothe fears that an anti-terror law will be misused, either against members of minority communities or against political enemies. This is why the earlier Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and the later POTA had to be reconsidered. Besides, the BJP still seems unable to accept its defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. In that context, this desire to propound new laws, allegedly to correct the errors of the UPA, smacks of oneupmanship and also a desperate attempt to rally its old faithfuls. The focus is actually not on crime. Nothing could be more dangerous at a time when both organized crime and terrorism are frightening everyday realities. It is essential that the Centre and the states evolve a united strategy to fight them, and not worry about outdoing one another in correctness.

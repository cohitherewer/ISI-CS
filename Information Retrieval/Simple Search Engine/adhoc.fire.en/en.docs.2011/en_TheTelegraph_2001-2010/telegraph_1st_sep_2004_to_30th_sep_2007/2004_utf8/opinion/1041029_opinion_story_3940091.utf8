 Letters to Editor

 Shaking the wrong hand

Sir ? India?s overtures to the visiting Myanmar military 

ruler, Senior General Than Shwe, proves that Aung San Suu Kyi cannot count on 

the world?s second largest democracy to save her (?Democracy on general?s lips?, 

Oct 26). It is true that India needs Myanmar?s help to flush out insurgents operating 

from that country. But does that mean that the members of our ruling coalition, 

many of whom have been ardent supporters of Suu Kyi, have to renege on their promises 

of help to this courageous woman? Has not India been a vocal critic of military 

regimes which have usurped political power by displacing democratically-elected 

leaders? Despite all its dealings with the crafty Pervez Musharraf, New Delhi 

is yet to learn that it cannot take a military man?s promise of restoring democracy 

and clamping down on terrorists seriously. 

Yours faithfully

Rothojit Ganguly, Calcutta

Be careful 

 Sir ? Pratap Bhanu Mehta?s ?Joy and despair?(Oct 14) strikes the right note. Indeed, India?s relationship with the United States of America has taken a turn for the better. But India, as Mehta correctly points out, needs to be cautious given the US?s unfailing support to Pakistan and its penchant for interfering in the domestic affairs of other nations. After 9/11, the US had a free run of Pakistan and could have tracked down the elusive Osama bin Laden. However, its real intention was to get a leverage in the sub-continent, especially in Indo-Pak ties.

 Mehta is right in saying that the euphoria surrounding the improvement in India-US ties is largely misplaced. Despite the ?good relations? between the two countries, India must keep reminding the US that it will never bow down to American pressure and that it does not desire American help in solving contentious bilateral issues with Pakistan like Siachen and Kashmir. The present government needs to be aware of the limitations of India?s ties with the US. There can be no question of India compromising on its security and integrity. Our country has always put security over development ? something that may have stunted India?s growth. But Indians would rather settle for less growth than surrender tamely to the US?s diktat. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? India needs to be clear about its priorities before engaging the US in negotiations. While striving for better ties with that country, we have to remember that American politicians are shrewd manipulators and are only concerned with what is best for their country. Therefore, a cautious approach is very important. The United Progressive Alliance government is being support by the left, which is well-known for its vilification of the US. The left needs to be relegated to the backbenches if we are to make any progress in our relationship with the world?s sole superpower.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? In the article, ?Joy and Despair?, Pratap Bhanu Mehta writes, ?In many ways, the question of terrorism was a diplomatic godsend for India?? One cannot help but ask whether Mehta thinks that the deaths of ordinary people is of no important compared to having a diplomatic upper hand vis ? vis our neighbour.

 Yours faithfully,

Piyali Mitra, Calcutta

 Turning away

 Sir ? The West Bengal government?s proposed joint venture with the Sahara Group to develop an eco-tourism project in the Sunderbans will lead to nothing but disaster (?Bengal in Sahara home plan?, Sep 6). This project brings to the fore the problems related to eco-tourism. What we need in areas such as the Sunderbans is sustainable development. Eco-tourism helps industrialists make a fast buck and brings very little benefit to the local population ? selling peanut and phuchkas to tourists hardly helps the poor locals in any way. In contrast to this, sustainable development leads to a real improvement in the local economy and in the condition of the inhabitants.

 Yours faithfully,

Debjani Chakrabarti, Columbia, US

 Sir ? The reaction of readers to the news of a proposed eco-tourism project in the Sunderbans was encouraging (?Evil tidings?, Oct 25). On the one hand we have inconsiderate corporate bodies like the Sahara Group and on the other, we have those who are crying themselves hoarse in their attempt to save the forests. Despite such protests, it is likely that the rich and powerful business lobby will be able to convince our political leaders that the project is environmentally sound and hence should be given the green light. 

 Yours faithfully,

Maushumi Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Despite all the grand plans to make West Bengal a more attractive destination for tourists, visitors will continue to give this state a wide berth. Bad roads, crumbling heritage sites, unreliable transportation and corrupt government officials make a visit to this state unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.

 Yours faithfully,

Suvro Chatterjee, Durgapur

 Out and About

 Water may not have flown as smoothly as expected for Nandita Das, but her recent film on rainwater has environmentalists gurgling over the actress. Das has directed a short film which has been nominated for the coveted Green Oscars. The film, nominated in the campaign award category, is a public service announcement of sorts to promote rainwater harvesting as a lesson from the past and a solution for the future. Considering her long association with the earth?s elements (remember Fire?), is it any wonder she?s doing well in that department?

 Sanjana Kapoor

 Two wrongs may never make a right, but two right dramatists can make an amazing theatre festival. Prithvi Theatre is all geared up for its annual fest in Delhi this November, and as usual, theatre lovers? hearts are beating with anticipation. This time, Sanjana Kapoor has decided to adapt the plays of Habib Tanvir in a tribute to Naya Theatre?s turning 40. Prithvi?s annual festival will showcase plays like Charandas Chor and Mitti Ki Gadi in tandem with some of their own. Time for some high-voltage theatrics, then.

 Jackie Chan

 Action of a different kind, one would say. Jackie Chan, shooting for the film Myth at the Virupaksha temple in Hampi, was so miffed at seeing chewing tobacco sachets strewn all around that he began to pick them up and put them in a trash bin. Taking the cue, the authorities promptly installed bins in the heritage complex.

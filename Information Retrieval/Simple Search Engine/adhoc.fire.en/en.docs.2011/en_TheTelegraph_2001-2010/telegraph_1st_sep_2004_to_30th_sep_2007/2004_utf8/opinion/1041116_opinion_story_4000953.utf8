 Letters to Editor

 Fund management

 Sir ? Witness how the left admits to the pension sector being a key player in the economy, yet becomes disdainful of the proposal to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the pension sector (?Pension pangs for multinationals?, Nov 13). The left, and other opposing parties it has obtained the support of, needn?t be so cagey for there is no intention of doing away with the existing Employees? Provident Fund Organisation. Besides, employees should have the option of parking their hard-earned money with a fund manager of their choice. And this will only be possible when many players are allowed into the market. As of now, post?retirement employees are entirely at the mercy of the government to see them through at a time when they need this saving the most. This is a scary proposition going by how our governments take no time in becoming cash-strapped. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Nikhil Dutta, Calcutta

 How it works

 Sir ? Abhirup Sarkar has correctly identified the ?colossal? size of the Central government sector in West Bengal as a major contributor to the purchasing power of the people of the state, in the backdrop of declining industrial production and insufficient agricultural output (?Import to consume?, Nov 4). 

 However, Sarkar can be offered more clues in his quest to solve the puzzle of how Bengal pays for its substantial imports. First of all, the state has seen a lowering of job opportunities ? which are also comparatively less-remunerative ? over the last three decades. This has resulted in an exodus of professionals to other states and foreign countries as well. This is particularly true of the information technology sector. A good part of the earnings of such professionals is usually ploughed back to the state in the form of remittances to parents and relations. 

 Another major contributor is, perhaps, the parallel economy being run on the black money generated by corruption ? instances of such unethical income in government and quasi-government establishments, public sector undertakings and even in the private sector are easy to come by. Smuggling is perhaps yet another source of the surge in the purchasing power of a section of people. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pabitra Kumar Das, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The article, ?Import to consume?, highlights an important puzzle in the Bengal economy. But it does not offer an alternative model for sustaining high levels of economic growth in the state and financing its growing import bill. One way is to develop our strengths, of which the software industry is one. There is a caveat however. The software industry here continues to be overshadowed by Hyderabad and Bangalore. The IT Act of 2003 was an encouraging start, yet the empty buildings of the Salt Lake IT Complex look disturbingly similar to the shiny (and empty) skyscrapers of Pudong, Shanghai, where a similar problem of excess capacity exists. Investments in the state need labour reforms, low-tax regimes and a solid infrastructure. West Bengal has miserably failed to provide these. 

 We may have a comparative advantage in agriculture, but there is a lot to be done in order to keep that position secure. Small landholders are usually unable to take advantage of economies of scale, they are also not in a position to invest in technology to improve productivity. Cooperatives need to be encouraged in such a situation. Agriculture should be brought under the organized sector. Improved productivity and cheaper products will help them immensely in the competitive markets.

 Yours faithfully,

 Ladies only

 Sir ? Sangita Sultania G. Roy?s unusual experience at the metro station does not surprise (?In her own words?, Women, Oct 31). I take the metro to work every morning. As the train enters the Tollygunge station from the shed, I see men rushing for the doors, pushing at each other and competing fiercely for the general seats. Most women choose to stay behind till the men have forced their way in. A few things are noteworthy about this daily ritual. Men take it for granted that the seats that do not bear the ?Ladies? sign are for the ?gents?. Sometimes, one of the two rows of seats reserved for the women have missing sign-plates and so men do not think twice before walking in and occupying those seats with an air of authority and even disdain. In all these cases, women watch helplessly and none of them dares protest. 

 In one instance, I was travelling back home with my colleagues and since there were both men and women in the group, we chose to sit in one of the general seats. As the train left from a certain station, two of my seniormost colleagues ? both women ? meekly went to the ladies? seats. They had apparently been asked by a gentleman to vacate the seats because there were empty ladies? seats. The incident was an eye-opener because the ladies in question are both in their post-retirement extension.

 As far as clothes are concerned, I can understand Roy?s concern. Calcutta?s bhadralok is miles from accepting and respecting women in anything other than saris.

 Yours faithfully,

Maushumi Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Recently, on our way back from Digha, we were shown some Bangladeshi movies in the private bus (made by some local company, presumably in Dhaka). The movies were an attack on the senses. They contained the choicest invectives and have explicit scenes of domestic violence, showing cruelty to women. 

 Does Bangladesh not have a censor board that such movies find their way into the market? More importantly, can these movies ? made in such bad taste ? not be prevented from being shown to people travelling with their children? The message that these crude movies convey should make us sit up and start thinking.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Letters to Editor

 To regain lost ground

 Sir ? Need Sharad Pawar do it (?Pawar boast on Sonia sacrifice? ?, Sept 25)? He knows the Hindu right is coalescing against him, the Dalit forces are on the rise, and the alliance with the Congress is a lifeline he cannot severe. Yet he takes his chance to take a potshot at Sonia Gandhi, whose ?sacrifice? is now the Congress?s unique selling proposition. Why? Is it only because he thinks that Congress preoccupation with left delinquency now gives him an opportunity to get away with a lie? Or is it because he senses that the eve of the state elections is just the right time to come clean on the rather unexpected deal with the Congress after the general elections? Or, more important, is it to prove right the rumour mills which have been hinting at a tectonic shift in Congress loyalties, so that just in case the Congress comes undone, Pawar may be in a position to choose his allies again?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Watch out

 Sir ? Gone are the days when the public had to rush to post offices and stand in a queue to renew their radio and television licences. When the licence was withdrawn on radios and TVs, people were much relieved, not so much for the money saved, but definitely for the trouble of paying it. This is the age of the television. Should we still be thinking of a licence on the radio, as Bhaskar Ghose argues in ?Sense and licence? (Sept 22)? Ghose thinks that the licence fees will be enough to save both TV, especially the government?s Prasar Bharati, and radio from the funds-crunch and aggressive advertisers. But will it not be a stupendous task to bring all TV and radio sets already in use under the licence system? Who knows, the revenue gain from the license fees might even go into chasing the evasive owners of existing TV and radio sets? 

 A practical solution would lie in imposing the licence only on new sets sold. By this, we may assume, most of the sets in use a decade later would be under the licence system. During the intervening period, revenue earnings may not touch the expectation mark. But if the intention is to see public-service broadcasters free from political and bureaucratic interference and corruption, this should be fine. But how far an increase in revenue earnings does Ghose believe the licence fees can achieve? He himself says that this alone does not mean that political or bureaucratic interference will stop. The remedy may be found in inducting ?saintly? people in Prasar Bharati. But how far, in that case, will we be from Utopia?

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? I believe that the greatest threat to Doordarshan is Doordarshan itself, given its complete dependence on the government for funds. Those of us who were brought up prior to the cable invasion still cherish memories of the single-channel DD and the superior quality of its programmes. I wonder if most Indians like to watch the trash that is being dished out on television these days, especially by DD, which given its vast experience with the Indian viewership, should have done better.

 As for corrective measures, one should point out that DD has mostly been out of sync with popular expectations. It has also been complacent about ways to upgrade the quality of its programmes. The information and broadcasting minister, S. Jaipal Reddy, recently expressed the need to lay greater stress on DD?s inhouse programmes. Doordarshan has the best logistical support, including quality producers, technicians, cameramen, editors ? all except the right work environment. If the last changes, DD may be able to face the challenge of the satellite channels. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subrata Das, Agartala

 Sir ? It is no secret that Mandi House is dictated by the needs of the market. By refusing advertisers a hand in regulating the business of Prasar Bharati, the latter may be able to better the image of the public broadcasting systems. At present, the service lies trapped in the mesh of confusing dictates from bureaucrats and advertisers. However, the irony is that the taste of viewers has fallen to an all-time low. Keeping this fact in mind, public-awareness campaigns need to be undertaken to highlight the importance of information-based programmes. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Selfless service

 Sir ? As a long term volunteer with the Missionaries of Charity, both in Calcutta and in other parts of the world, I was saddened to read about the attack on the sisters in Kerala (?Attacked nuns shy from police?, Sept 26). I speak from first hand experience when I say that I have never, ever, heard or seen, any missionary of this organization attempting to convert anyone, be it a volunteer or a patient. What I have seen, however, is the love and care they put into their work, for people of all faiths. These women dedicate their lives to the service of the poor. I would urge everyone to think hard about the message this attack has sent out. Mother Teresa took Indians to her heart, and her sisters continue to do this. I would ask these attackers to spend a day working at Nirmal Hriday in Kalighat.

Yours faithfully, 

Verity Worthington, Cambridge, UK

 Letters to Editor

 In the name of patriotism

 Sir Politicians are known for their ignorance, but it is inconceivable how an erudite journalist like Swapan Dasgupta is in the dark about V.D. Savarkars political life, which had three distinct phases (Gentlemen and patriots, August 27). The first one, till his incarceration in Andaman in 1911, is befitting of his image as the fearless freedom fighter and impassioned nationalist. But the second, ten years (June 1911 to May 1921) in the Cellular Jail, was a total negation of his earlier life, during which a grovelling Savarkar pleaded for mercy and offered full cooperation to the British. Finally, when he was brought back to mainland jails and set free in 1937, he became the proponent of Hindutva, spitting venom at minorities but keeping silent about colonial oppressors. Perhaps this phase of his life has made him an icon of the sangh parivar. Dasgupta skirts these issues by scorning the man who has questioned the hallowed place given to Savarkar. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Anjan Kumar Sen Sarma, Calcutta

 Sir Swapan Dasgupta needs to be thanked for putting the Mani Shankar Aiyar versus V.D. Savarkar issue in perspective. Born in India before independence and having witnessed the freedom movement first-hand as a young boy, I am aghast that Aiyar has publicly disrespected Savarkars memory by ordering the removal of a plaque from the prison where he spent 14 years. Savarkar, who displayed exemplary courage and single-minded devotion to the cause of Indias freedom, was a role model for many of my generation, although we might not have subscribed wholly to his political views. But who is Aiyar a role model to? 

 Yours faithfully,

Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

 Sir It is a pity that Swapan Dasgupta, ever faithful to the sangh dogma, is still trying to obfuscate the Veer Savarkar issue by training his guns on Mani Aiyars past. That Savarkar played a role in the freedom movement is unquestionable. But in a meeting with Lord Linlithgow in 1939, he assured the latter of his support in the British war effort. He kept his word by keeping the Hindu Mahasabha away from the Quit India movement. 

 In the circumstances, placing a plaque with a Savarkar quote at the Cellular Jail in Andaman is an insult to all those martyrs who refused to bend before the British and suffered prolonged torture at their hands. There were other compatriots of Savarkar who were languishing in Andaman jail who could have compromised their ideals to save their lives. Can their names not be put on a plaque instead of Savarkars?

 Yours faithfully,

Rajarshi Sengupta, Noida

 Sir Swapan Dasguptas article took me back to 1962, when I was a surgical registrar in the United Kingdom. When the Indo-Chinese war broke out, I was teased by my English colleagues who said that one Indian student was collecting money for the Chinese and sending appeals to British citizens. We thought it was a dirty joke by the Tommies. We know now that it is most likely to be true, as also the identity of the man. It feels good to be enlightened about the identity of the turncoat patriot after 42 years.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Swapan Dasgupta has ended his article with the question, ...are communists incapable of being gentleman? The answer is: yes. This fact has been admitted by a front-ranking communist minister. A few years back, when asked by his secretary to behave like a gentleman, the Marxist minister had retorted: I am not a gentleman, I am a communist. This is on record.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Mani Shankar Aiyar might be a faithful of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, but he need not be so defensive and quote history to prove his loyalty. Ordering the removal of a plaque containing V.D. Savarkars quotes was both ungentlemanly and unpatriotic. It is quite fair that his reputation of being a zealous red is in focus. For while Savarkars patriotism is beyond any doubt, Aiyars raising money for the Chinese during the 1962 Indo-China war does raise questions about his patriotism. 

 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose too did not see eye to eye with the mahatma and the Congress. Will he be made to meet the same fate as Savarkar? It is sad how Aiyar and those like him are resorting to ideological despotism in their attempts to prove themselves loyal. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Humiliating national heroes is a favourite pastime of our politicians these days. What did the Congress achieve by removing V.D Savarkars plaque from the place where he spent years in prison? Did the move fulfil or serve any national cause except creating grounds for animosity and political bickering? 

 Communists are perpetual spoilsports whether in power or out of it. These so-called messiahs of the downtrodden campaign shrilly against their political rivals for perpetrating anti-people policies, but adopt the same policies when they come to power. Not only do they display the same tendencies as their predecessors but also, unfortunately, provide a sort of legitimacy to dirty politics with their verbosity. This is why people are always wary of them and keep them at bay. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

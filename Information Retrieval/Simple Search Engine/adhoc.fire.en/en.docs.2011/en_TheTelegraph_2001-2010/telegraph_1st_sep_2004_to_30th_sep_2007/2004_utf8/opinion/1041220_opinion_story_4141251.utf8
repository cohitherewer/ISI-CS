 IT IS NOT BOOM TIME IN INDIA 

Commentarao / S.L. Rao

 Will he be allowed to proceed? 

The Bombay Stock Exchange sensitive index last crossed 

6,000 in January 2004. It has now crossed a record of 6,400. The rise is uniformly 

over a range of industries and companies and not confined to a few sectors or 

companies. The bellwether stock of earlier times was Reliance and, in the last 

two years, also Reliance Energy. The public airing of issues in the group has 

depressed the stock prices of all group companies. Their shares have taken a beating. 

In earlier times this would have dragged the market down. It has not this time. 

Not that share prices necessarily reflect the economy. 

They are moved in India by signals and sentiments, not the fundamentals of the 

economic situation. Thus, mere forecasts of a good or bad monsoon, a new tax that 

might plug tax evasion by stock-market dealers and trucking agents, prospect of 

peace or war, a communist spokesman dismissing market concerns, have in the past 

led to market collapse or boom.

The present stock-market boom has been more sustained, 

at higher levels and over more companies than earlier ones. There will no doubt 

be corrections as people book profits, but the trend is buoyant. The share values 

are moving up at such speed over a broad front that it is not possible to predict 

the level at which they will stabilize. The rush of foreign institutional investment 

is the principal mover of the present market, as it has been many times in the 

past few years. However, the flow this time has been much greater and steadier, 

and in December India is said to have led others in inflows of institutional investment. 

This is not as much a reason for rejoicing as for worry since these flows can 

be reversed at no notice as we have seen in the past. Foreign direct investment 

has to take roots in the country and cannot run away. But FDI has yet to show 

such buoyancy. Nor are our policies such as to encourage them.

High government and trade deficits, rising oil prices 

and the consequent decline of the dollar put the American economy in danger of 

heating up and inflation. With this, the relatively better and sustained economic 

growth in India attracts foreign funds to India. There must be many American investors, 

including many non-resident Indians who feel safer with their investments spread 

over India and other countries than restricted to the United States of America. 

The latest ICRA Bulletin says that overheating of the American economy not taking 

place is a consequence of the combination of high labour productivity growth, 

lagging employee costs and therefore lower labour costs. If American productivity 

growth begins to stall and labour costs to rise, the US will have inflation along 

with its already poor macroeconomic fundamentals. 

That will lead to much sharper interest-rate increases 

than the moderate steps with which they have been raised by the Federal Reserve 

in the last year. As the US attempts to set its house in order, it might be compelled 

to use protectionist measures at least temporarily. The slowing down of exports 

to the US will hit China, India and others that have gained from the import flood 

into the US. This will also retard the revival that is apparent in Germany, France 

and Japan to go along with a strong British economy. Trade and investment between 

them will also be hit. The Indian economic fundamentals appear to be improving. 

Financial savings of households (including small enterprises) have improved significantly. 

Remittances from overseas Indians and businesses rose from $2 billion in 1990 

to $19 billion last year and an estimated $21 billion this year.

This will only increase as more Indians go to work 

overseas. It has led both to increased savings and more consumption expenditure 

especially on housing and consumer durable products. But expenditures both on 

consumption and investment have to increase by much more. This is where the proposal 

to use foreign exchange reserves for infrastructure equipment imports is relevant. 

It will use the current account surplus of today that is due to the low expenditures.

To achieve consistent 7 per cent annual GDP growth, 

we must have faster agricultural growth as well as of industry and services. Agriculture 

needs much more public investment and we must await the budget to see whether 

the government can increase it. Growth in industry and services is throttled by 

red tape and poor urban infrastructure especially roads, transport, water, sanitation 

and power. There is little sign of honest attempts in most states and their city 

administrations to improve their management and find the resources for investment.

As always in the past, it is not boom time in India. 

The prime minister seems to have his priorities right. His primary focus is on 

the institutional structures that can implement growth policies: make the administration 

more specialized and accountable; improve the regulatory mechanisms; make state 

owned enterprises viable; enforce coordination between ministries through the 

Planning Commission; focus sharply on neglected sectors of the economy ? agriculture, 

infrastructure and social services. The question is whether he will be allowed 

to proceed with his unexceptionable plans or will find them sabotaged and constantly 

sniped at, not by the opposition but by his own party and allies.

The economy has not changed since the waning days 

of the Vajpayee government when India was said to be shining. It might seem to 

be booming today, but there are fundamental weaknesses and challenges. They range 

from high government deficits, unviable enterprises, poor financial regulation, 

and uneconomic infrastructure pricing, ineffective delivery systems of government, 

red tape, and so on. To be resolved they need politics and government to march 

in step. That they are not doing so even within the Congress, let alone its allies, 

is apparent. The stock markets are booming. That is no indication of a rosy future 

for the economy.

 Letters to Editor

 Chasing shadows 

 Sir ? For constables in Madhya Pradesh, promotion comes at a heavy price ? winning a 15-kilometre race (?MP cops race for hawaldar post?, Oct 5). It was only expected that not one of the heavily-set cops could make it to the end ? some had collapsed while others preferred the stroll to the run. This incident raises a few points though. Despite the rising incidents of policemen suffering cardiac arrests and committing suicide due to work-related stress, the higher-ups have paid little attention to the health of the force that is far from fighting fit. Regular exercise, yoga classes and a nutritious diet, which elude most cops in the lower-rungs, should be made a part of their regimen. The picture with the report, which shows two fat cops huffing and puffing, may have raised a few laughs. But what the officials don?t realize is that the jokes actually on them.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sinner versus saint

 Sir ? The fact that school textbooks in Gujarat have glorified Adolf Hitler and found fault with the mahatma goes to show that Narendra Modi is hell-bent on preaching the doctrine of sectarian violence (? Text tussle?, Oct 1). Students in standard VIII are being taught about the ?negative aspects? of Gandhiji?s non-cooperation movement. Isn?t it ironical that both Gandhi and Modi were born in the same state? While the first stood for peace, brotherhood and non-violence, the latter admires tyrants, abets communal strife and bad-mouths those who speak about bringing change without bloodshed. It is strange that even after the horrors of the Gujarat riots, the Modi government has done little to promote equality and brotherhood in the state. Instead, it has taken to glorifying villains like Hitler. 

 Yours faithfully,

Prashant Solomon, New Delhi

 Sir? We continue to read history as it is written and interpreted by those who ended up on the winning side in World War II. Contrary to what they say, one cannot deny the fact that Germany regained its lost pride under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. Yes he did kill innocent Jews, but the community has been the target of many such pogroms in other parts of Europe too ? as history bears witness. Moreover, there is very little criticism the capture of the Ruhr after the end of World War I by France, or for that matter, the Versaillies treaty. This treaty had rendered Germany incapable of defending itself and was largely responsible for sowing the seeds of war. 

 During the war, the allied nations ruthlessly bombed Axis territories. Japan was bombed even as the terms of surrender were being worked out. The president of one allied nation dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Those who sing paeans to such leaders have no right to teach moral lessons to the rest of the world. If Hitler is a criminal, so are the allied leaders. As an Indian, I am especially grateful to Hitler whose attack on Britain weakened the latter and enabled India to achieve independence.

 Yours faithfully,

Sujit Sharma, Calcutta

 Sir ? A political storm has been kicked up in Gujarat by school textbooks that praise Adolf Hitler and condemn Mahatma Gandhi. But why shouldn?t students learn to praise a man who had brought glory to his fatherland? More important, the politicians who have condemned the unflattering portrayal of bapu in these textbooks need to ask themselves whether they have followed the teachings of Gandhi themselves. These leaders have not only failed to rein in corrupt administrators, but have also abandoned important Gandhian principles ? swadeshi, the prohibition of alcohol, communal amity and development of the villages. Putting up hundreds of statues of the mahatma all over the country is the only way known to our netas to honour the father of the nation. They need to be reminded that our ancient scriptures state that one needs to appreciate the good qualities present in all human beings, even if the person is someone as brutal as the Fuehrer. Throttling one?s freedom of expression, is that not a fascist act by itself? 

 Yours faithfully,

Rajdeep Patnaik, Cuttack

 Death traps

 Sir ? A part of the metal cover of an underground cable circuit has broken down due to heavy traffic and is protruding dangerously at the Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road- S.N. Banerjee Road crossing. Unfortunately, the traffic cops have turned a blind eye to the danger to pedestrians. Or are they waiting patiently for an accident, like the one which killed Amit Dalmia, to spur them on to action?

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Siddiqui, Calcutta

 Sir ? It was a miracle that accidents had not taken place on the Zeerut Bridge earlier than the one which claimed the life of Naif Ahmed. If the bridge was repaired on time, Ahmed?s freak death could have been avoided. The authorities should make sure that such incidents do not take place in the future.

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Guha, Calcutta

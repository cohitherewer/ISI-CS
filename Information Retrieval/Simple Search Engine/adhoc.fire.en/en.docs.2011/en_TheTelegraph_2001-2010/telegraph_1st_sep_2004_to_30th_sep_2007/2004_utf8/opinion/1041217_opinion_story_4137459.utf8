 WASTED RICHES

 If natural resources alone could make a region rich, Bihar and Jharkhand would have been among the richest, and not the poorest, states of India. The fact, however, is that a state?s economy has more to do with good administration and other factors conducive to commerce than with its deposits of natural resources. If an investor in a new steel plant does not find Jharkhand an obvious choice for it, although the state has some of the largest iron-ore reserves in the country, the reason is to be sought in the weaknesses of the state?s industrial infrastructure. It is understandable that Ranchi was upset with an industrial group?s decision to set up an integrated steel plant in West Bengal with iron-ore supplies from Jharkhand. If implemented, it would be one of the biggest industrial projects in West Bengal in recent years. But the prospect brought little cheer to Jharkhand, which threatened not to allow its iron -ore reserves to be used for any project outside the state. The threat has apparently worked, as the investors have now agreed to locate one part of the project in Jharkhand. 

 However, the episode seems to have thrown up issues that are crucial to the question of the state?s economic well-being. It is only to be expected that each state would be guided by its enlightened self-interest in drawing up strategies for economic development. It is doubtful, though, if a strategy of economic non-cooperation with another state is viable in the long run. Jharkhand?s chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, would do better to ask himself why, despite the existence of natural resources such as iron ore there, investors are wary of putting their money in projects in the state. After all, their decisions are based on hard-nosed reasons of commerce. Jharkhand obviously lacks the kind of infrastructure that appeals to a potential investor. If Mr Munda wants Jharkhand to compete with West Bengal or any other state in attracting investments, he has a straightforward task. He must work overtime to create conditions favourable for such investments. Unfortunately, Jharkhand has a long way to go in this. It has to put in place the basic industrial infrastructure, create a pool of skilled labour with the help of better education and, above all, end the Maoist rebellion that haunts large parts of the state. Investors may not stay away if Mr Munda can put his house in order.

 LIFE COMES FULL CIRCLE

Ill go to bed at noon 

By Gerard Woodward, 

Chatto amp; Windus, pound;7.95

Gerard Woodward continues with the family saga of 

the Joneses in this novel, after his debut fiction, August. His novel is 

set in the bleak, suburban north London of the Seventies ? the restless decade 

preceding the Thatcher era. Some of the characters chase their dreams, some seek 

happiness, but none seems to be at peace with the world or with each other.

 Janus Brian is Colette Jones?s brother. After his wife?s death, Janus becomes an alcoholic and leaves Leicester Avenue to settle at High Wycombe. There is also one Janus Jones, the son whom Colette named after her brother. A talented pianist, this Janus too turns to alcohol and makes life miserable for everyone around him at his Fernlight Avenue residence. He also nurses a grudge against his father, Aldous, who is a painter designing a fountain at the behest of a church bishop. Janus ends up in jail and dies a pitiful death ? a shock which proves too much for Colette to bear.

 Woodward?s novel thus deals with an existential crisis. To borrow Jung?s terms, there is an unresolved conflict between ?the anima? and ?the persona?, which the characters vaguely recognize and try frantically to come to terms with. 

 But on the whole, the novel is not inveterately pessimistic, a trait typical of some of the more famous novels of the same kind. This is primarily because Woodward enlivens his narrative and character-sketches with humour. It is also because of the presence of the many farcical elements in his fiction.

 Another reason lies in the way Woodward concludes his novel. While wandering aimlessly after his wife?s death, Aldous comes upon Butcher, the plumber who takes him to his residence. In Butcher?s garden, Aldous discovers, much to his amazement, a fountain of the same design he was working on. The design had been secretly handed over to Butcher by Colette and put to grand use. 

 What is more, Aldous is struck by a manually-operated steam-engine, which is Butcher?s lifetime achievement. This offers Aldous an epiphanic vision. The long-cherished dreams of two lonely, disconsolate old men suddenly reach a flashpoint. And this is where Woodward?s poetic vision is at its best.

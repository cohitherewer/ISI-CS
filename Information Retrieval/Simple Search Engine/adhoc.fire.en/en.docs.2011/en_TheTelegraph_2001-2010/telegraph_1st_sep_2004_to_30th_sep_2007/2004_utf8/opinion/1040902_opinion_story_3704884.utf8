 GO SLOW WITH THE REFORMS 

The new Kelkar report makes economic sense but all stakeholders 

need to be consulted before it is implemented, writes S. Venkitaramanan 

 Transaction value 

Vijay Kelkar has produced yet another report, this 

time on the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. The task force he 

headed was mandated to fix annual fiscal targets, indicating the path of adjustment 

and the policy measures needed in keeping with the FRBM Act. It was also expected 

to draw up a medium-term framework for fiscal policies in line with the FRBM objective.

The task force has, indeed, more than fulfilled its 

mandate. It has interpreted its terms of reference to effectively authorize a 

rewriting of Indias tax structures. It has also led to a rather hastily revised 

version of the Kelkar committees proposals aimed at a radical tax reform, particularly 

in respect of indirect taxes. 

The Kelkar task force has rightly stressed the magnitude 

of the fiscal challenge. Making reasonable assumptions with regard to revenue 

and expenditure, the task force estimates that in 2008-09, fiscal deficit will 

be 3.98 per cent of the gross domestic product and revenue deficit 1.66 per cent 

of GDP, amounting to Rs 51.54 crore. This is the order by which either revenues 

have to be increased or expenditure reduced, or both, if the fiscal targets laid 

out in the FRBM Act are to be achieved. The main villain, according to the Kelkar 

task force, is the relatively low tax-GDP ratio. The task force comes out in favour 

of front-loading tax reforms, taking advantage of the benign macroeconomic conditions 

in the country. In its view, there is danger in postponing tax reforms, as these 

conditions may deteriorate, both globally and nationally. 

What the Kelkar task force proposes in detail is, 

however, a tricky challenge for the reformer. It proposes that Central excises 

(or the Cenvat) be substituted by the Central General Sales Tax Act, which authorizes 

the Centre to tax both goods and services, on a Vat-able basis. 

The Kelkar task force stresses that fiscal correction 

should be based on enhancing revenues rather than on merely reducing expenditure. 

This argument is valid, especially in view of the stimulus provided by some elements 

of public expenditure, excluding categories like subsidies and establishment charges. 

The task force also argues that Central tax reform is important inasmuch as it 

leads to more devolution of resources to states, enabling them to handle their 

fiscal problems better. But a question remains has the task force appraised 

the implications, on states finances, of the proposals such as abolition of Central 

sales tax and stamp duties? 

The Kelkar task force also makes a case for more tax 

reforms by pointing out how many countries with equivalent GDP-per-capita levels 

have higher tax-GDP ratios. The fiscal reforms proposed by the task force will 

lead to a substantial increase in tax-GDP ratios. This is also feasible, points 

out the Kelkar task force, in the light of inter-country comparisons. The Kelkar 

report is, on the whole, well-informed and supported by elaborate economic arguments. 

It is difficult to quarrel with its economic logic. But, success in a political 

economy lies in blending economic argument with political adjustment. That is 

not within the domain of economists but the politicians who must know where to 

draw a line in the pursuit of ambitious fiscal targets.

The task force suggests that the Centre and states 

enter into a grand bargain under which both exercise concurrent, but independent, 

jurisdiction over sales tax. The Centre is to levy sales tax on goods and services 

with respect to all transactions. The report spells out details of how the tax 

will be levied and collected. Dealers with transactions below Rs 25 lakh must 

be registered. Those with transactions below Rs 40 lakh will be exempt. The information 

technology platform, used to assess and levy the tax, will be coordinated with 

that of the direct taxes proposed by the task force. The seamless interchange 

of information thus achieved between the direct tax and indirect tax authorities 

is expected to eliminate, or at least reduce evasion.

The task force also contemplates states amending their 

tax structure, giving up the Stamp Act and substituting it with a sales tax on 

real estate transactions, giving Vat relief to consumers of real estate 

essentially rent-payers. While this reform is desirable since it can plug a number 

of loopholes in stamp tax, it can also create uncertainties of various kinds. 

The report does not make it clear whether it has consulted state governments about 

the proposed reform.

Now for a general observation about tax reforms. An 

existing tax is less of an irritant than a new tax, even if the latter is introduced 

by a mere change of name. Excise has been part of tax-payers psyche for many 

decades and has been the subject of many judicial decisions. The tax-payer may 

find it difficult to get accustomed to a new tax legislation, especially when 

accompanied by the implementation of Vat. Maybe, the experts in the task force 

thought it better to reform in one stroke, affecting many entities at once so 

as to reduce the problems of coordination. But I would have preferred them to 

proceed gradually implementing the Cenvat on goods and services and subsequently 

entering into the grand bargain with the states.

New problems of tax collection will, no doubt, surface 

when Vat is introduced on a large scale, both on state and Central taxes. The 

Kelkar task force refers to the need to plug such loopholes. Tax administrators 

have written on the adverse experience of Vat in many countries, discounting the 

optimism about additional revenues from it. Tax reformers may have already advanced 

far in their attempt to introduce state-level Vat but, it behoves them to consider 

these warnings.

The Kelkar task force has a number of detailed recommendations 

for the implementation of the new tax structure. Particularly, with reference 

to IT, it lays great faith in a uniform platform. 

The Kelkar task force has virtually constituted itself 

as a tax reform commission. It would, indeed, be useful in view of the comprehensiveness 

of the proposals to have transparent broad-based consultation on them before they 

are translated into law. Apart from involving state governments, affected tax-payers 

groups should be also taken into consideration. Recent experience shows the problems 

that well-intentioned but radical tax proposals encounter. Recall how Nicholas 

Kaldors eminently sensible proposals in regard to wealth and expenditure tax 

met with failure when an enthusiastic T. T. Krishnamachari tried to implement 

them. Such problems can be avoided with a bit of forethought and consultation. 

Political acceptability for the radical reforms proposed by the Kelkar task force 

has to be earned through consultation and by involving all stakeholders.

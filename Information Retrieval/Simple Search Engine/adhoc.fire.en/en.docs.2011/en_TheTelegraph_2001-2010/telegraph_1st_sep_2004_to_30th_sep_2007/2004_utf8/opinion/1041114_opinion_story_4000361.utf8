 VALE OF GOOD INTENTIONS

 Some gift horses must be thoroughly inspected in the mouth. This is especially important in an atmosphere of fragile trust, for to make a wrong estimate of the gift?s value leads to confused responses. Exactly a year after India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire along the line of control from last Id day ? and managed to stick to it ? the Indian prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, has decided to reduce army presence in Jammu and Kashmir. In the subcontinent, gifts convey the very essence of the festive season, for they express goodwill. Mr Singh?s decision is being portrayed as a gift for both Diwali and Id, matching the ?Diwali dozen? offered by his predecessor at the same time last year. It is not that Mr Singh just wants Pakistan or Kashmir-watchers across the seas to recognize that India is serious about peace. The decision is addressed to the people of the state as well. It is perfectly timed too. The army major accused of a double rape, which included the rape of a minor, has been put under arrest at last, after furious protests against the government, army and the police in Srinagar. The undesirability of a heavy army presence is very much on people?s minds.

 Mr Singh?s decision could be read as a quiet answer to the flamboyant suggestion of the Pakistan president, Mr Pervez Musharraf, in October, that certain regions of the state be selected and demilitarized. Mr Musharraf?s plan to find a solution to the ?Kashmir problem? was richer in subtexts than most political-diplomatic messages. Mr Singh?s gesture is a positive step, neither rebuff nor compliance, but a measure intended to convey India?s firm conviction about the goal of and path to peace and its concern about the immediate needs of the people. The prime minister?s office has taken pains to clarify that the decision was taken in the context of successful security operations and could be revoked if threat perceptions increased.

 Since last year, visitors to both countries across the border have grown, and journalists and pilgrims from Pakistan have visited Kashmir. India has fulfilled its offer of free treatment to some very ill Pakistani children. The freeing of imprisoned fishermen has been an important step ? the 13 points agreed upon between the two countries in August include the setting-up of a mechanism to deal with the issue of civilian prisoners and fishermen. Transport links are being increased, and tourist visas are becoming a possibility. But confidence-building between the two countries is rather different from the question of trust within. The Indian government must also relate to the people of Kashmir. While welcoming Mr Singh?s decision, the state has expressed the hope that the Centre will withdraw the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the Disturbed Areas Act. When external and internal affairs are so intimately related, no decision can be an easy one.

 STRONG WORDS

 The road to peace is long and uneven. If a conflict is as old as the Naga insurgency, it would be na?ve to expect the peace-talks to be a smooth affair. But the latest outcry of Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, is a serious matter. Rarely during the seven-year peace negotiations have the group?s leaders used such strong language to denounce New Delhi. He is upset with some activities of rival outfits such as the Naga National Council and the NSCN, led by Mr S.S. Khaplang, and sees the hand of ?Indian intelligence agencies? behind them. The timing of Mr Muivah?s allegation does not bode well for the peace initiative. It comes close on the heels of the NSCN(I-M) leaders accepting an invitation from the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, to visit India in December to continue the dialogue. If that raised hopes for peace in Nagaland, Mr Muivah?s complaint could be a cause for despair. 

 It is possible to argue that New Delhi should actually talk to as many Naga groups as possible to make the peace efforts acceptable to all. There is no denying that Mr Muivah?s outfit is the biggest of the rebel Naga groups. That does not, however, make the other groups irrelevant to the peace process. It is not just a question of the comparative strength of the groups; even small outfits, left out of the process, can reduce it to a seriously flawed peace. The failure of the Shillong Agreement between the NNC and New Delhi in 1975 may not be relevant to today?s situation. On the other hand, it is important to bear in mind that the current peace-talks are primarily between the government and the NSCN(I-M). New Delhi must, therefore, be careful not to send out wrong signals to the principal peace-maker. If it needs to talk to other groups, it would do better to take the NSCN(I-M) into confidence about it. New Delhi needs to come clean on some of the charges heaped on it by Mr Muivah, particularly the one about the intelligence agencies clandestinely providing arms to the NNC cadre. It is one thing for the peace process to stumble on grey areas; it would be quite another if the trust between the negotiators is lost. Mr Muivah, too, cannot walk out of seven years of peace-talks in a huff. That would be a cruel blow to the people of Nagaland, who have endured untold sufferings over five long decades. Both New Delhi and Mr Muivah owe it to the Nagas to make peace, not war.

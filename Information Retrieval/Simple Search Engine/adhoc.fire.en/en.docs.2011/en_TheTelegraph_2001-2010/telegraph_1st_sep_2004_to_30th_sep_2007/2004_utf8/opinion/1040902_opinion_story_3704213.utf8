 SLIGHTLY WORSE

 In the Reserve Bank of Indias annual report for 2003-04, of particular interest are the Central banks views on gross domestic product growth, inflation and interest rates for 2004-05. The RBI suggested 6.5 to 7 per cent in the May credit policy, and there are no new forecasts now. While acceleration in world output growth and higher levels of domestic investment are cause for celebration, the RBI sees downside risks because of uncertain monsoons and high and uncertain global oil prices. Few will disagree with this diagnosis, except that the monsoon has not turned out to be as bad as was initially feared and the RBI has not flagged the high base for 2003-04. With 8.2 per cent GDP growth in 2003-04, 7 per cent in 2004-05 would have been difficult. Most independent forecasters have now lowered growth projections to between 6 and 6.5 per cent, which suggests the budgets growth, revenue and deficit projections will go haywire. Nor has the RBI come out with any new inflation projections, having suggested 5 per cent in May. This looks increasingly unlikely, subject to the inflation indicator being used.

 The wholesale price index on a point-to-point basis is not indicative of long-term trends and the fact that this is now hovering around 8 per cent is neither here nor there. In the last few years, all three consumer price index series have registered lower inflation rates than the WPI. The causes of the present inflation are oil prices, hikes in prices of steel and metal products, monsoon-related concerns and budget proposals in the service sector. The truckers strike added to woes. On an annual basis, one is probably talking about CPI inflation of between 5 to 5.5 per cent and WPI inflation between 6 and 6.5 per cent. This is not alarming, but some cause for discomfort. 

 The RBI thinks interest rates will harden, and banks and other financial intermediaries have been asked to rebalance their portfolios. The bond market reacted immediately. With global interest rates hardening, few can question the RBIs expectations of increase in domestic interest rates, although the RBI has not quite suggested an increase. Notwithstanding the finance ministers recent assurance that interest rates will be stable critical for investments a 25 basis point increase seems certain. The RBI seems caught in a schizophrenic mould. Given the national common minimum programmes exhortations to lend, especially to the rural sector, the RBI wants banks to lower lending rates. There is some merit in the argument that lending rates have not dropped by as much as deposit rates have. But high yields on government paper, high deficits and interest rates on small savings are also factors. Overall, notwithstanding successes in managing the external sector, the Central bank message is one of a worsening macroeconomic environment. Having inherited a sound economy, the United Progressive Alliance cannot blame all of it on luck.

 GOING HOME

 How happy is a happy ending? In Jhajjar, Haryana, Sonia, eighteen months married and three months pregnant, will now be allowed to go back to her marital home as ?daughter-in-law of the village?. The local khap or caste panchayat had earlier ruled that her marriage to Rampal would have to be annulled and the child possibly aborted because husband and wife belonged to traditionally related sub-castes or gotras, Rathee and Dahiya, within the Jat community. Sonia defied the order that specifically asked the couple to relate to each other as brother and sister, and took shelter away from the village. She had to be taken to hospital because the stress was too much for her condition. The absurdity of the demand and the sheer cruelty of the bullying in the name of preserving tradition could not move the district administration at first: it was loath to interfere in what was purely a ?social? matter. It was irrelevant that the once-powerful khap panchayats no longer have any legal standing; the current logic of India?s electoral politics dictates that they be allowed their little antics, since favourable caste blocs are essential to all politicians.

 The police were initially silent too, since no complaint had been filed. Only when the Punjab and Haryana high court, responding to a public interest litigation on the issue, ordered the khap panchayat to stop interfering in the couple?s marital life and instructed the police to provide protection to them was there some activity on the part of the state. But, leaving aside the administration?s obvious reluctance to interfere ? and the deep-seated indifference to the unhappinesses of the underprivileged that it implies ? it still has to be asked how much the state can do in these situations. As long as it nurtures caste and community divisions and rules for its own benefit, it cannot resolve, even if it tries, the power-struggles that develop within inward-looking communities.

 Sonia always had her father on her side. He won ? by ?providing documentary evidence? that his family belonged to the Hooda sub-caste, which was allowed to marry Dahiyas. That the khap panchayat seized on this as a face-saver after the court order is a possibility, but the real point is whether this is a satisfactory resolution. It is a victory of strategy, not the establishment of rationality over superstition. It is hardly the happy ending to be looked for. It is not even an ending ? to the vicious and silent violence being done to lives every day under the pretext of preserving the purity of community laws. A Sonia or a Gudiya are just the few victims the world comes to know of. The psychology is that of honour killing: the number of young couples murdered or banished for doing what Sonia and Rampal did is quite staggering in the Haryana and Rajasthan regions. A strategic victory is just not good enough.

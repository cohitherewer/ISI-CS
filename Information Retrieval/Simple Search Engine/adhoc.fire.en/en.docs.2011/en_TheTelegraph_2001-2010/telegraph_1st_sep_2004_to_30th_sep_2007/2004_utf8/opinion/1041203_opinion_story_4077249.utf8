 NO ONE READS ANY MORE

 Starting young

 There are two indicators of the health of the Indian book world: the condition of our educational institutions and the cultural shift in newspapers and magazines. The first, because almost 90 per cent of all books published cater to the specific course requirements of our educational system; the second, because circulation figures reflect our reading habits.

 That there is a distinct dumbing down can be seen in the quality of our graduates who are innocent of basic communication skills, spoken or written. In the print media, copy is now limited to 1,000 words at the outside and much more space is given to pictures than to words on a page. Put the two together and the basic philosophy is clear: we would rather see than read and much rather listen than observe.

 Two questions arise. Why has there been a distinct cultural shift in reading habits? And what is it being replaced by?

 With over 40,000 new books being published in India and Britain, apart from updated reprints, there is a danger of good books being buried under the bad. Sadly, many publishers are being driven by the numbers? game which often means doing away with a detailed editorial examination of the typescript and just getting on with the physical production of the book.

 The result: fat tomes that would have been better for being shorter, not by cutting down chapters but by purging useless words and sentences. But this requires critical analysis of the text, qualities present-day editors do not possess or have the time for. 

 Second, the reader is ?overloaded?; his attention span is ?targeted? by more powerful forces like TV. In school, where reading habits are formed, the syllabus is far too much to handle and the examination system leaves little time for extracurricular reading. Information (mostly useless) is what is tested, not imagination or application.

 Habits inculcated in schools get strengthened in colleges where the rat race for jobs begins. Undergraduates stick to their special areas of interest; reading to be better informed and entertained at the same time is a concept totally alien to the vast majority.

 But the overall picture is not all that grim. There is a critical mass of readers ? the percentage may be small but the numbers are large ? who are among the best in the world. Is it any wonder that British and American institutions and the professions ? doctors, accountants, software engineers, management consultants and so on ? are chock-full of Indian graduates? Or that India remains a significant market for English-language books from Britain and America? And that the numbers continue to rise?

 Second, although reading habits do not match up to the numbers going through the school system, there has been a shift from reading to surfing on the internet. Agreed, many surfers are there for the porn sites but there are others too, seeking information.

 There?s hope yet.

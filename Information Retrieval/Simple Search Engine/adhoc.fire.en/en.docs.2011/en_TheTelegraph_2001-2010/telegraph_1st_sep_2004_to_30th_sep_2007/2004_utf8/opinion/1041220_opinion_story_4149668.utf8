 NEW TERRITORY 

 Paradoxes are hard on the brain. A culture, which has for generations believed that women themselves are property, chattel that can be owned or bought or sold or given away, might find the notion of women as equal inheritors of family property paradoxical. So it is no wonder that it took the Indian government such a long time to decide on an amendment to the Hindu Succession Act of 1956, which would give Hindu women the same rights as men to ancestral property. Some states, especially in the south, have already made the change in their property laws, and in West Bengal, women receive a share equal to that of their brothers if the father dies without a will. It is mostly in north India that women are not allowed to inherit ancestral property. The promised amendment would put right an institutionalized form of gender discrimination. On paper at least.

 Implementation is another matter. A change in the law may indicate a number of things, but it never does herald an instantaneous change in social behaviour and in routines of oppression and deprivation. That legislators ? and here party or the colour of political ideology is immaterial ? took 48 years to perceive this blatant injustice, and did so at last at the prompting of the law commission, speaks volumes about the persisting invisibility of women in this country. The amendment is welcome, but commitment is another matter. Proof of that has to be left to time. The poor showing of India?s administrative institutions with regard to violence against women ? there are laws against that too, quite a few as a matter of fact ? may raise questions about actual commitment to gender justice. It is ultimately up to society to make the amendment meaningful. Since the pressure on most women from within their natal families to ?give up? or not claim their rightful shares will not disappear in a day, it is the women who will have to exercise their right with firmness. The law is a weapon in their hands. Over time, ownership of property by women might help change certain established evils in the marriage institution, such as the system of dowry ? there is a law against that, by the way ? or the appropriation of the bride?s gifts by the marital family and so on. But that is a long way away. The first step is for women to see that they get their due. The rest will follow.

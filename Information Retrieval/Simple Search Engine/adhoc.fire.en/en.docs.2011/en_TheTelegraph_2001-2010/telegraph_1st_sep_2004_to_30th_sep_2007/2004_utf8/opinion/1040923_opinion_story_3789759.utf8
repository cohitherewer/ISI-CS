 OLD TIES

 It would be short-sighted to view the visit of the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, to the United Kingdom, where he signed a joint declaration along with his British counterpart, Mr Tony Blair, as merely a stopover on his way to the United States of America. Although Britain no longer carries the weight of a major power, it is still an important player in international politics. The Indian prime minister?s visit has produced explicit British support on key issues of importance to India. These include support for India?s campaign against terrorism and for India?s candidature as a permanent member of the United Nations security council. The joint declaration commits the two countries ?to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations?. Britain and India have agreed to work together to try to ensure that all countries uphold the global norms against terrorism. They have also arrived at an agreement to cooperate in order to counter money-laundering and terrorist financing. 

 Unlike in the past, Britain has shown no ambiguity on this issue. Indeed, Mr Blair condemned ?totally and absolutely? Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Kashmir, and said that there was ?no equivocation? on the issue as those who practised ?whatever passes for terrorism? had no interest in peace. On economic issues, India and Britain have agreed to work closely together for a successful conclusion to the World Trade Organization?s Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations. There is also a commitment to expand cooperation in the fields of civilian nuclear activities, civilian space programme and high-technology trade. All this is good news. The UK may no longer matter to India as much as the US, in terms of both the economic and political relationship, but it does count in other substantial ways. Britain is a member of the UN security council, a key member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and has a special relationship with the US. For India, the UK has additional significance. Apart from historical and cultural factors, there is the strong linkage provided by the Indian diaspora, and Britain continues to attract hundreds of Indian students. A strong India-UK partnership, therefore, is a powerful plank in India?s foreign policy.

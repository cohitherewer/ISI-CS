 HELPING HAND

 It is becoming increasingly important to save Indian democracy from the politicians. The Election Commission?s running battle against Bihar?s politicians proves this once again. If it is Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav whom the EC has to discipline one day, then it is Mr George Fernandes it has to haul up another day. Both have been taken to task for offering money to people allegedly to buy their votes in the forthcoming assembly polls in Bihar. But what Mr Shibu Soren, a chief ministerial candidate in the elections in neighbouring Jharkhand, said in Mr Fernandes? defence gives away the politicians? ploy. This despite the fact that Mr Fernandes and Mr Soren belong to rival political camps of the National Democratic Alliance and the United Progressive Alliance respectively. What is wrong, Mr Soren wondered, in politicians offering a helping hand to those who needed it? He could not have been unaware of the logic behind the commission?s action. The electoral code of conduct makes a clear distinction between help and bribe in the run-up to elections. Not that the politicians do not know it. But their cynical violations of the code are not merely an affront to the EC?s authority, they are also a threat to democracy. 

 The larger issue relates to the people?s right to exercise their franchise freely. The problem is that the politicians and their parties often rob the people of this right. Bribing the voters is as rampant as intimidating them. One has only to recall the cases of underworld dons such as Mr Pappu Yadav or Mr Mohammed Shahabuddin who routinely turn elections in Bihar into a show of muscle power. But Bihar is not the only state that needs to be saved from electoral thugs. The EC?s crusade must spread to wherever elections are to be held early next year. But there is a point about the charge against Mr Yadav and Mr Fernandes that needs to be underscored. Both are powerful politicians and the steps against them should send out a message to all politicians. As politicians? crimes went unpunished, the people came to suspect that the EC was powerless against the powerful. This loss of faith in the EC could lead to the people?s loss of confidence in democracy itself. Cynical politicians will only exploit that sense of despair. What the EC achieves in Bihar will be a measure of its will ? and its capacity ? to clean up the electoral system.

 TIME FOR OUR OWN CHARTER 

 Shobita Punja

 UNESCO and other agencies have played a vital role in raising awareness of the need to streamline the way the world cares for its heritage properties. The declaration of world heritage sites around the world has brought national governments into a common international programme of nominating the sites each year. 

 There are over 120 nations that are signatories to this programme of UNESCO. The World Heritage Committee has additional programmes to evaluate how these world heritage sites are being maintained by member countries, and although UNESCO offers no financial assistance, they do provide technical advice and training facilities to upgrade the protection and conservation of world heritage sites around the world. Therefore, we are moving towards developing global standards of conservation and guidelines for best practices for the preservation of cultural landscapes, conservation of buildings, re-use of heritage buildings and development of visitor facilities. 

 When Indian experts attend these meetings they become aware of contemporary techniques, principles and ethics being followed by member countries in the conservation and presentation of world heritage sites.

 Some years ago, the review committee came to India to look into problems that had occurred at the famous island of Elephanta in Maharashtra. Later, an international team visited Hampi in Karnataka, where a road and a bridge built by the government was running right through the protected area of the 13th-century capital of Vijayanagara, an important Indian world heritage site. It is in this way that the international body aids and directs nations to improve the quality of their conservation programmes, and nudges them to abide by international rules and guidelines.

 Mixed feelings

 A number of charters for the conservation of heritage was also initiated so that member countries and signatories could follow a common code and adhere to a set of heritage conservation principles. As early as 1931, the Athens Charter contributed to the formation of this international movement and the formation of an International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property. 

 However, like all things global, there are individual differences between the needs of one country and another. Each country, because of its own peculiar historical circumstances, has evolved a heritage that is unique to it, which others may not share. In India, we have much in common with other ex-colonies like Pakistan and Sri Lanka, where there are a large very unique range of buildings built by their colonizers. Some of these nations have a mixed attitude, not always protective, towards the heritage left behind by the imperial powers. These countries are still debating on whether to save imperial buildings, to preserve the different types of colonial houses of various periods of their history or to bring them down and build new contemporary structures to meet present-day needs.

 Another feature of such countries is that that they have what experts call a continuous living heritage. This means that, unlike European countries which suffered during the Industrial Revolution and lost most of their craft traditions and skilled artisans to the machine, many countries in Asia have a vibrant craft tradition and artists who continue to practise their hereditary skills and occupations. These make it imperative that we develop our own forms of conservation while we adhere to international norms as well. 

 The question is, who will design the Indian charter for conservation and how long will this important task take? Meanwhile, how much of our heritage are we losing each day?

 BLACK IDEA

 The national common minimum programme increases pressures for government expenditure and makes targets of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act difficult to meet. The 2004-05 budget?s deficit projections look suspect, with revenues also having been adversely affected by excise and customs duty reductions. Whether for physical or social infrastructure, the United Progressive Alliance is making out a case that there is a scarcity of resources. Hence, an education cess. Use foreign exchange reserves for funding physical infrastructure. Other cesses to fund social sector spending or employment guarantees. To add to the list, there is now the idea of unearthing black money and channelling it into a dedicated social sector fund. However, whether physical or social infrastructure, the constraint is not resources. In the former, if policies are right, there is no paucity of money. In the latter, substantial amounts are already spent on social sectors through Centrally sponsored schemes and related avenues. If the government is interested in improving social sector outcomes, as it should be, attention needs to switch to delivery and increasing transparency and accountability of government expenditure. That leaves the question of black money. It is fashionable to quote a figure that 40 per cent of gross domestic product is accounted for by the black or illegal economy.

 This is probably gross over-estimation, as most instances of black economy are transfer payments for national income accounting. Be that as it may, there is no denying that right taxes are not paid, both for direct and indirect taxes. Some of this is outright evasion. The rest avails of exemptions, loopholes and discretions permitted in tax laws. The answer is rationalization, harmonization and better enforcement, all outlined in the three Kelkar task force recommendations.

 However, such reforms are difficult. And on the face of it, schemes to unearth black money seem attractive, especially since such schemes are promised in the NCMP. The finance minister will look at the success of the voluntary disclosure of income scheme, which brought in Rs 10,500 crore of revenue. However, the fact remains, and Mr Vijay Kelkar also made this point, that such disclosure schemes bring in revenue only when they are attractive. Ipso facto, effective tax rates and penalties are lower than normal and there is a perverse incentive against being honest. This is true even if bonds with zero interest rates for the first few years are issued, as is now being proposed. Hence, the government is better advised to remove exemptions, unify tax rates and remove discretionary abuse, so that creation of black income is addressed, instead of attempting to address the stock.

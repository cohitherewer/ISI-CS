 MONEY FOR NOTHING

 Raju Mukherji

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India has finally decided that the international players would receive annual remuneration as retainership for their services to Indian cricket. No complaints here. And the retainership would vary from individual to individual depending on their performance. Fair enough.

 But then what is the criterion of performance? If performance be the sole objective then what is the period under reference? For example, Virender Sehwag was an outright failure in the last three tournaments in England, Holland and Sri Lanka. Yet he is in the highest grade, Grade I, with an annual retainership of Rs 50 lakh. Whereas newcomer Irfan Pathan, with a string of successes, is in Grade II with an annual retainership of Rs 35 lakh. What kind of selection procedure is it which is based on such a lopsided idea of justice?

 And who decides who should be in which grade? Media reports suggest that apart from the top BCCI officials there was the Indian coach and the chairman of the national senior selection committee. On what basis have these wise men decided that V.V.S. Laxman and Sehwag should receive more than Pathan and Laxmipathy Balaji? What made them think that Murli Karthik, an irregular member at the best of times, and Ashish Nehra, perpetually carrying injuries, should be in grades III and II respectively? 

 Two years ago, when the idea of gradation was first mooted, I had said that it would lead to dissension within the team. Today, I see no reason to change my view. In fact, I have been vindicated by the absence of the Indian captain at the meeting to finalize which player goes to which grade.

 Divided we stand

 Sourav Ganguly is on record that he did not attend the meeting because that would give wrong signals to his teammates. All those who would not be in Grade I would feel that they have been stabbed in the back by the BCCI with the support of the captain.

 Yes, this is the crux of the problem. The fantastic team spirit exhibited by Team India during the last two years would vanish in no time. Individual players would play for themselves without a thought for the team. Youngsters like Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh would rather play safe in the end-overs of one-day games to inflate their average.

 For the sake of team unity, the system of graded payments need to be scrapped as soon as possible. This is nothing but a ?divide and rule? policy. Nepotism is sure to crop up soon. Indian cricket would go back to the days when individual performance counted more than the team?s performance.

 A simple example would suffice. Say, a newcomer scores a spate of centuries. And at the same time a senior player in Grade I goes on failing. At the end of the year, the senior player goes home with Rs 50 lakh and the newcomer gets Rs 20 lakh. Would this kind of discrimination be the right way to encourage our new talents? Would Tendulkar, Ganguly and Dravid have been happy if, at the start of their careers, they found their unsuccessful seniors earning more than they did, even with good scores. 

 Let us not mislead ourselves by mentioning the graded payment system of Australia. Australia has been on top of international cricket for the last 130 years. Even when the Aussies were strictly amateurs, they were as successful as they are now. Graded payments did not in any way help them become world-beaters. 

 In India graded payment is just an alibi to pay the seniors more than the juniors. Senior players ? injured, out-of-form ? all stand to gain more than successful youngsters. Unless we see reason fast, Team India will cease to be a united entity. Divisive, selfish tendencies would predominate. The individual will gain precedence over the team. India would no longer remain a power in international cricket.

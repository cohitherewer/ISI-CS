 HOW SAFE IS THE TEMPLE?

 Gyan Pathak

 We are increasingly losing our sense of security, be it in a crowd, in privacy, in the law court, in the police station or even in places of worship. The arrest of the sankaracharya of Kanchi only heightens that feeling. The Kanchi seer, Jayendra Saraswati, was one of the most respected saints in the country, and yet he now stands accused of murder. Whether the sankaracharya actually committed the crime is not the moot question. What is important is that fingers could be pointed at him. How safe is then a devotee in the precincts of the temple?

 The arrest of the sankaracharya may be an act done in haste, as L.K. Advani says. It may even be said to reflect a partisan attitude towards the Hindu seer vis a vis other religious heads who roam free despite having criminal charges registered against them. But then, are these questions more important than the larger interest of the common man? 

 Let us put the matter in the right perspective. The prosecution claims that it has records of phone conversations between the assailants and the sankaracharya before and after the murder. It also claims that the currency notes seized from the alleged killers had been withdrawn by the Kanchi mutt from a leading bank. It is also well known that there is rivalry and groupism in the mutt.

 Against the tenets

 There are other points to note. The sankaracharya has, more than once, projected himself as the true custodian of Hindu interests. He had tried to mediate in the Ayodhya dispute, and his authority in this case was challenged by the various Hindutva forces which now cry foul over his arrest. Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders like Vishnu Hari Dalmia and Ashok Singhal even led a demonstration protesting against the government action in Delhi. 

 But it is simply politics. They seem neither interested in justice for the victim or for the accused, nor in furthering Hindu interests. Their prime argument is: why has the Imam Bukhari of Jama Masjid not been touched despite having criminal cases registered against him? Do they realize that they are questioning the basic tenets of secularism in the country? 

 Is it sufficient logic that an offender should not be arrested simply because other offenders are at large? Besides, if the question is of fairness, why didn?t the Bharatiya Janata Party itself arrest the offenders who happened to be Muslim religious leaders? Was it also fearful of widespread unrest? Or did it, like all other governments, decide to give short shrift to the system of criminal justice for the sake of keeping peace? 

 Religion above man

 Whatever the case, we should not let ourselves be carried away by the claims of political vendetta. Otherwise, we will be reducing ourselves to the brute logic of defending community interests ? Hindus being allowed to say that a Hindu offender should not be touched and Muslims being allowed the logic that a Muslim offender should be left alone.

 Let us remind the Ashok Singhals and Praveen Togadias that the law is above individuals and institutions, religious or otherwise. It should be allowed to take its own course. The sankaracharya?s arrest is not a threat to Hinduism because Hinduism is above any one individual or one?s protectors or followers. Hinduism is the sanatan dharma while spiritual leaders come and go. The latter should not be allowed to hold the society at ransom. 

 Common people can be protected only when the state shows the guts to arrest all leaders ? political or religious ? who have criminal cases registered against them or have warrants in their name. But the question is: can we do it, that is, make our entire society free of criminals?

 A POWERLESS WEAPON

 The popular mood is against bandhs. Parties that hope to survive have to reflect this change in their strategies, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 Original sinner?

 Three bandhs in less than three weeks and the usual rituals of parties supporting or opposing them. Has anything changed for Bengal and its political parties? Even the opposition of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to these bandhs is nothing unusual. It always opposed bandhs that other parties called. Yet, it is impossible not to see what has changed. No matter what postures they make, the parties today are apologetic about bandhs, while the people are showing signs of openly ignoring or even defying the bandh calls. 

 There were always people who had no love lost for the politics of bandhs. There were also people who had little love lost for any politics because they either did not need politics or saw it as an impediment to their unfettered control of the system. 

 But the increasingly louder voice of protest against bandhs that one now hears in Bengal is a very different matter. Not just industrialists or other employers, but more and more sections of the common people now see bandhs as sterile, meaningless rituals that give them no hope of redressal of their problems. 

 This is the important change that can force the parties to rethink their old ways. The judicial verdicts against bandhs or strikes by government employees may at best act as catalysts to this change. Bandhs were never legal, but that did not detract from their political power in earlier decades. 

 It is also doubtful if bandhs will cease to be called because the judiciary banishes them outside the law. On the contrary, despite the court rulings, more and more parties and other organizations now call bandhs in more and more states. Opinions will also differ on how far the courts can ? and should ? control politics. It is not a question of the courts penalizing a politician on criminal charges. There may be a limit to the judiciary holding democratic politics in check. 

 The real change, therefore, has to come from the two basic components of that politics ? the parties and the people. And that seems to be what is happening about bandhs in Bengal. 

 The CPI(M) minister, Subhas Chakraborty, may have got carried away a little when he said that the people would henceforth ?bash up? politicians calling bandhs. But one cannot miss his point ? that the people may no longer meekly accept the parties forcing the shutdowns on them. There was a time when participating in a bandh was a matter of political morality for its supporters. Now, even the government employee, always the symbol of the bandh-happy, work-shirking tribe, feels a little sheepish about bunking office on a bandh day. Increasingly, he is ashamed of having a paid holiday. 

 Political parties cannot but take notice of this change in popular mood and change their strategies accordingly. Even in Bengal, where the bandh originated as part of left politics, there is a change of political climate which makes it irrelevant and almost immoral. And, this is not just because the left has been in power in the state for close to three decades. 

 Writing in the CPI(M)?s Bengali organ, Ganashakti, earlier this month, senior party leader, Benoy Konar, asked opposition parties to ?stop reducing bandhs to fun?. ?The weapon of bandhs will be blunted if a handful of people forcibly stop cars or take to strongarm tactics?, he writes, ?while millions of people remain indifferent to the bandh call or are annoyed by it.? But he still thinks that bandhs are a ?powerful weapon?. 

 It is time Konar and his party realized that an increasing number of people in Bengal no longer consider bandhs a ?weapon?, blunt or otherwise. This is not merely because they had a surfeit of bandhs over all kinds of issues. As far as the CPI(M) is concerned, the people now see the absurdity of the party alternately acting as the ruling party and the opposition to suit its partisan interests. How long can they ignore the duplicity in the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, asking government employees to improve their work culture and his party mouthing the old platitudes about bandhs? 

 Bandhs can no longer have a place in either the rhetoric or the policies of a party that has Bengal?s economic development as its mantra. It would be na?ve to argue that economic growth is Bhattacharjee?s theme song, and not the party?s. In fact, the Left Front?s 2001 election manifesto made development its clarion call. Both Bhattacharjee and his party lived up to it to a large measure, having taken a number of reformist policy initiatives, both in agriculture and industry. 

 By doing so, they have created a new environment that has made investors, domestic and foreign, to see Bengal in a new light. After a long time, the people too are talking of a changing Bengal. The politics of bandhs is totally out of sync with this emerging face of the state. It would be a great betrayal of the people if the parties ignore this change and stick to their old, unreformed ways. As the original sinner, the CPI(M) has to lead the political class in making amends and saying no to bandhs. Opposing bandhs called by the Socialist Unity Centre of India or Mamata Banerjee?s Trinamool Congress is not enough; like charity, political course corrections have to begin at home. 

 It cannot be anybody?s case that there should be an end to the politics of protest. Dissent and debate make democracy the most vibrant of political systems. In fact, there would always be occasions in a democracy when protests on the streets become necessary. If the issues are that critical, the parties will fail in their duty by not protesting loud enough. Only enemies of democracy would like to see the end of a legitimate political process. 

 Thus, it would be churlish to deny that the rise in the prices of petroleum products, over which the parties called the bandhs in Bengal this time, is a matter of concern for the common people. As everyone knows, the rise in fuel prices pushes the cost of transportation and thereby of most essential commodities. The majority of people had a genuine reason to resent the government?s decision on this and therefore protest against it. There may be other policies of Union and state governments that will be seen as harmful to the interests of different sections of the people. 

 There could even be a big enough issue that may justify the call for a bandh. When such a bandh is called, the people may respond to it spontaneously and not out of fear or fun. But that would be very different from the farce that has been synonymous with bandhs in Bengal. The parties that learn the new lesson quicker may actually get more popular support than others. Those who refuse to learn it are doomed to remain inconsequential.

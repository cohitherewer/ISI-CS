 TIME

 TO

 DISCO

 Everythings new in Saif Ali Khans life. New interests, new modelling assignments and new-found fame. So he sees no reason to keep an old wife

KNOTS 

 amp; CROSSES

 Aamir Khan: The Lagaan hero divorced old sweetheart Reena with 

whom he had a secret marriage in October 2001 

 Boris Becker: The tennis champion of Germany divorced his model wife, 

Barbara, in 2001 

 Jemima Khan: The London socialite left former-cricketer husband Imran 

Khan for actor Hugh Grant.

 In some high-tech, all-secure laboratory, men and women in white coats are no doubt doing all they can to get to the bottom of an old debate: does reel life influence real life, or is it the other way around? They should have just asked Saif Ali Khan. 

 Months before the buzz about his impending marital split reached a crescendo, the Hindi film hero was play-acting a script for a commercial and settling the debate for once and for all that it was the reel life that called the shots. With a packet of potato chips in his hands and a glint in his eyes, old Saif hinted at what was to follow in his real life with words akin to: Bet you cant have just one!

 Those of you who think that he was referring not so much to a wafer as to a wife may be forgiven. For it now transpires that the actor a hit of the new millennium is seemingly following one of the golden rules of success: Climb new heights, dump old wife.

 Earlier this week, gossip-wires hotted up when the couples friends as anonymous as they were reportedly dear said that 34-year-old Saif and his wife, Amrita, were separating. 

 For long years, as Saif the eldest child of actor Sharmila Tagore and former cricketer, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi tried to squeeze his way into Bollywood, he and wife Amrita were a hit couple. Now, as a series of hits catapults Saif to the top, he is ready to leave his wife.

 The story is ironic, for Saifs parents have touched a record of sorts by making their marriage work in a world where partners are changed as often as socks. And in Mumbais film industry, even the younger Khans marriage was often referred to as one of those made-to-order gifts from heaven.

 Legend has it that Amrita Singh Dingy to friends met Saif at a party and invited him home, urging him to bring his own bottle of Scotch. Saif came, bottle in hand, and later said: I never left.

 But the senior Khans had been appalled when Saif, then just 21, announced that he was going to marry the daughter of an old Sanjay Gandhi crony, Rukshana Sultana. They did their best to dissuade him from taking what they thought was a rash step. But Saif did not budge.

 This time, if the murmurs are to be believed, Saifs parents have been trying to persuade him not to leave his wife and two children. 

 But Saif, the reports say, is adamant. And the film world, where three Khans Shah Rukh, Aamir and Saif were once synonyms for marital stability, is suitably heart-broken, Aamir having earlier flown the coop. 

 Simi Garewal, who interviewed the couple on her popular television show, told a newspaper: I havent been in touch (with them) but I hope its just a phase and they get back together. Its too early for an obit.

 Strangely, marital obituaries go hand-in-hand with professional paeans. After his eminently forgettable 1992 debut, Parampara, Saif was scornfully laughed off by cinema-goers and critics. But the last few years have seen the rise of Saif both on the big screen and in television commercials.

 A critic describes him as the multiplex star a suave and urbane hero who gels well with a similar audience. Which is why, some argue, he essentially made his mark with the funky Farhan Akhtar film, Dil Chahta Hai. And while a popular second lead, he really came into his own with the 2004 hit, Hum Tum.

 But Saif has always been a bit of a misfit in the industry. A Wykehamist as old students of Winchester College in England like to call themselves Saif has some out-of-the-Bollywood-box traits: he plays a mean guitar and did a fairly commendable sculpture of a lion for an international art exhibition in Singapore a few months ago. In interviews, he candidly speaks about being propositioned by a man when he was a teenager and flinging his pet cat from an upstairs window.

 So far, it seemed that even in marriage, Saif had carved his own path. But thats one myth gone bust. And it seems that the one who saw it coming was his son, Ibrahim. 

 Reports suggest that every time the three-year-old sees a man kissing a woman on the screen, he yells excitedly: Thats my dad!

 We told you, reel life rules.

 BETWEEN TEA AND THE NEXT FILE

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 What if a surgeon wants to watch cricket in the middle of an operation?

 It was a late morning at the suburban railway station. A small group of commuters hung around, sipping chai or watching the shoeshine boys stir up a madman wearing a Gogolian overcoat with pockets full of torn papers. And then the city-bound train pulled in noisily and picked up the few people like crumbs from a desolate breakfast table.

 It had only a half-minute stopover; the signals too were green. And yet the train seemed reluctant to move out. I soon found out why. The guard was buying khaini from a tiny stall tucked under the overbridge.

 The tobacco-seller chose the leaves with care, minced them fine, stuffed them in a green plastic box, put a generous dollop of lime, and then ran toadyishly to the guard?s cabin. The guard inspected the contents of the box and then paid him. The whole operation took exactly four minutes. But none seemed bothered. It was well past office time, and the thin crowd inside the train was mostly on personal or semi-official business in the city. Their purposes did not add up to the kind of collective paroxysm of haste that pulses through office-time traffic. Anyway, the train pulled out, returning the station back to its somnolent rhythm.

 It left in my mind a train of thoughts. There is now a ban on cigarettes inside railway stations. Doesn?t that include chewing tobacco? Which one is a more serious offence: buying a contraband item or unnecessarily delaying a couple of thousand people? The distance between stations is short, the train might not be able to make up for the lost time. What if this has a cascading effect and throws the system out of gear during the evening rush hour? Will the tired office worker, reaching home an hour late ever know the cause of his distress?

 And yet such incidents occur regularly. They are apparently small offences (like that of a man at the bank counter who must know the latest cricket score before clearing the next cheque), and they always have such a human face that we hate to complain. Even if someone raises an eyebrow, there will always be people sharing the clerk?s cricket mania, or sympathetic to the guard sahib?s need for a pinch of tobacco.

 Small talk between files, a sip of tea between punching tickets?..do these little dawdling acts really matter? Well, I don?t know. But what if a brain surgeon wants to watch the last over of an Indo-Pak cricket match in the middle of an operation?

 Letters to Editor

 Sexy is not beautiful

 Sir ? Why just an Italian headmaster, I am sure many would feel equally horrified by the clothes that young people wear these days (?Reveal jeans turn Italy red?, Oct 13). Yes, a tight-fitting low-rise jeans and top increases a teen-age girl?s voluptuousness by leaps and bounds and attracts the attention of the saintliest of boys. But looking sexy is becoming an unhealthy obsession with young minds, they could not care less whether they also look beautiful in the process. Gone are the days when women loved being modest and chaste. Even that loss could have been reconciled with, had it not been accompanied by a disquieting rise in perverse thought and fantasy. Even with a surfeit of bare midriffs around, Indian men are yet to get used to women in scant clothing. Could this explain the increase in cases of molestation and rape in fast-paced cities such as New Delhi? 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Reserve force

 Sir ? Once again attempts are being made to introduce a quota system in the private sector. Andr? B?teille has analyzed the national and global implications of this eventuality in ?Quotas for companies? (Oct 12). A social case can be made for reservations. But what about government control? Industries will now have to accept the possibility that a certain percentage of their employees may not be as competitive as the rest. In this age of the ?survival of the fittest?, it is not unfair to want to eliminate inefficient employees. Putting caste-based impediments in the way will not work. A better idea would be to make companies contribute more to the social sector. It is well known that more government control implies an increase in inefficiency. Companies may therefore please be left to hire as they think fit.

 Yours faithfully,

Abdus Samad, Incheon, South Korea

 Sir ? Our politicians have for years failed to implement reservations for women in the parliament and legislative assemblies. And yet, they expect the tentacles of reservation to spread from education and government jobs to private-sector jobs now. The founding fathers of our Constitution envisaged reservations for the backward sections of society to last not more than a decade. But it has been extended indefinitely. Is it not time for society to sit down and ponder over the outcome of reservations during the last 57 years? As far as I can see, reservations have only encouraged fissiparous tendencies in the country and led to an increase in corruption. Political parties such as the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal have gained maximum mileage by abusing the principle behind the policy. One must not forget that it was reservations in the form of Ramsay Macdonald?s ?communal award?, and the religion-based separate electorate system that have divided India into three unfriendly countries. 

 Mindless reservations may lead to a few more divisions of the country. If India is to forge ahead in the 21st century, it will have to be a meritocratic society. For the backward classes, reservations ? if at all required ? should only be at the level of primary education. People like B.R. Ambedkar or Meghnad Saha did not need reservations to rise to the top. Have we produced a single person of their calibre with all our reservation policies?

 Yours faithfully,

Arunava Choudhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? Gauging from the new challenges thrown up by globalization, it would be suicidal to stick to old patterns of living. Some have referred to the system adopted by American companies which provides for the inclusion of people belonging to minority racial and ethnic groups. They probably forget that the United States of America has been able to capitalize on this policy owing to its effective governance. 

 In India, the policy of reservation was introduced to honour the principle of equality. Has social equality been attained? No. Instead, there has happened a grave polarization of society, with politicians using reservations as an effective means to consolidate their vote banks. In an age in which nations are struggling hard to come to terms with the realities of a globalized world, wouldn?t a fractured private sector spell doom? Certainly this was not the right time for Manmohan Singh to experiment with such tricky issues. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Learning curve

 Sir ? Deep K. Datta-Ray?s ?Learning to speak like their masters? (Oct 13) reminded me of the public schools in Calcutta which existed till the Seventies, run by the city?s Anglo-Indian community. They were the vehicles of quality education in the Queen?s tongue before the mushrooming of the English-medium-school industry. The atmosphere here differed little from the hallowed environs of the British public schools, while the students had the added benefit of learning the vernacular. Students of these schools were regarded a cut above the rest. Prefects, houses, chapel and the ?touching of toes? before caning were very much a part of our growing up. 

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? First, an expert from the ?mother country? comes to lecture Indians on the multiple voices and dialects of contemporary global ?Englishes? (?A bouquet of the many Englishes?, Oct 13). Then the mawkish piece by Deep K. Datta-Ray, with neither irony nor reason to make it palatable. But isn?t the newly coined plural spent with a lower case ?e??

 Yours faithfully,

Shyamal Bagchee, Edmonton

 HEAT AND DUST

 Can the world be stopped from getting hotter? Not in any dramatic way, the Kyoto Protocol would be likely to suggest, but the heating can be slowed down, and ? with cooperation and awareness ? reduced over time. The decision to accept a scheme to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases is not, however, a simple matter of awareness and effort. While, in general, developed countries emit the greater percentage of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, the climatic changes ? resulting chiefly in flooding and desertification ? directly affect the poorer parts of the world, and are likely to destabilize those populations which find it the most difficult to recover. Since reducing emissions is also a matter of high expense, acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol guidelines is really a question of acceptance of responsibility. That is what has made such heavy going of the implementation of the 1997 pact. According to this pact, there should be a reduction of the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by developed countries by 5.2 per cent of 1990 levels during the period 2008 to 2012. It could be implemented only if the signatories represent at least 55 per cent of developed countries? gas emissions. With the American president, Mr George W. Bush, calmly ? and typically ? refusing to bother with the protocol, prospects of bringing it into effect looked forlorn. The United States of America is the largest polluter, its share of greenhouse emissions is 36 per cent. Russia, with its share of 17 per cent, had also been dithering. By endorsing the protocol at last, Russia has now given it a chance to work.

 Critics of Mr Vladimir Putin?s decision have been quick to point out that this is a foolish step to take just when Russia seems to be looking at an industrial recovery. Sceptics remain unimpressed at the possibility of the protocol being implemented, because all this effort will actually amount to the reduction of only one per cent of the total gases now emitted. But there is a point to this long struggle over the implementation of the protocol. Reduction of one per cent is still a reduction, and it is also the inculcation of a new habit all over the world. There is a new generation of youngsters growing up; the goal before them and their awareness of it may bring about changes faster than might be imagined now. And the little prick on the side of the US?s ?might is right? armour may also hold a promise of better things to come.

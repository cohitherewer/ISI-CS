 Letters to Editor

 Selling the image

 Sir Could it get more shameful? We once considered Atal Bihari Vajpayees face plastered on full pages in newspapers to be a scream. Now we have Sonia Gandhi immortalized in celluloid during her own lifetime (Sonias saris match, rest... Aug 31). In fact, Sonia, Sonia seems to be the beginning of the Congress hagiography (never mind the fudging on the funding for the film). At a more popular level, this deification might get reflected in the making of more lowbrow regional films on Sonia mata, clad in khadi and complete with the national flag in hand, a la Abanindranaths Bharat mata. Never since the Mahatma has the self-sacrificing image of any Congress leader found to be so eminently profitable. But as successive historians have shown, the Mahatmas image had to be maintained at a price. Wonder at what cost Sonia Gandhi will maintain hers!

 Yours faithfully,

C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Unsettling questions

 Sir Sunanda K. Datta-Rays Clinging to identity (Aug 28) makes some valid points about Britains problems with its Muslim population, but portrays the British government and the indigenous population of the country as helpless bystanders. While many British institutions are still liberal and politically correct, it would be foolhardy to presume that the average public atop a Clapham omnibus is brimming with tolerance. The majority of the print media in the United Kingdom spew malice daily against Muslims and refugees, also against white Europeans indeed against anybody who does not drink lager while watching football and celebrate the values of page three. The two most vicious newspapers Sun and Daily Mail enjoy a combined circulation of some 20 million. The recent resounding success of the UK Independence Party betrays the little-islander mentality the UKIP is strongly anti-European. In my experience, the average British person strongly resents allowances given to Muslims (and other ethnic groups) but they hardly ever speak out. This is probably a reflection of the natural British reserve, or even hypocrisy. During the Spanish civil war, thousands of (white) British went to fight Franco who was being supported by MI6, so why is Datta-Ray so anguished about some British (whatever their religion) going to fight in Iraq with the freedom-fighters? 

 About the Bonarjees, it should be said that their antics should not be emulated. They tried to eat, dress and think like Englishmen. But what does an Englishman think like? The West, thankfully, is an individualistic society where people think independently. But the brown sahibs are still living in their sad world of gymkhana and tiffin, and trying desperately to be noticed by the real sahibs. I am not sure which Muslim peers have offended Datta-Ray but the two most prominent ones Lord Ali and Baroness Pola Uddin always behave with dignity, though they need not be dressed to the Bengali sahibs high sartorial standards. And, Kashmir is not only an issue with the Muslims. A large number of people, of all political and skin shades, are critical of Indias actions there. The last thing Indians should do is feel sorry for the British. People who built the biggest empire and who remain an economic superpower are neither nave nor are they victims. 

Yours faithfully, 

Aroup Chatterjee, Hertfordshire, UK 

 Sir The objection of some British Muslims to the tale of Three little pigs is surprising. This reflects the mindset of these people, a large proportion of whom are migrants. Their refusal to assimilate with the indigenous population of their adopted country, as evidenced from this example, shows that their chief interest is to reap rich dividends from the country of their residence. There is no feeling, no attachment, no sense of belonging. If the English feel averse to the migrants settled in Britain, they are entirely justified in doing so.

 This cultural chauvinism is not peculiar of the Muslim migrants in Britain. There are scores of other migrant ethnic groups elsewhere in the world who have no respect for the culture and people of the country they settle in. How many migrants earning their livelihood in Calcutta care to learn Bengali, or how many settlers in Jharkhand care to respect the norms of the indigenous tribes? 

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 Sir What is wrong in holding on to ones cultural identity or values, even if that means more salwars and burqas on display? It is only through these cultural symbols that immigrants retain their identity. Besides, if there are more slippers and beards in England than Sunanda K. Datta-Ray would like, it is not the settlers who are to blame. How else do the Pakis get even with the condescending English?

 Yours faithfully,

N. Mahato, Calcutta

 Sir Why does Sunanda K. Datta-Ray continue to lament the end of the empire, be it in Calcutta or in Britain itself?

 Yours faithfully,

B. Basu, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir For fire in markets, shopping malls and privately-owned buildings in Calcutta, the owner or promoter or the caretaker is held responsible, irrespective of the cause of the fire. But the same formula is not applied in case of fire in government buildings or public places. If the caretaker of Metro Plaza could be arrested then why wasnt somebody arrested for the fire in the Chittranjan telephone exchange or Howrah station sub-way or for the small fire in Writers Buildings last week. Why is an exception made in case of the government?

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

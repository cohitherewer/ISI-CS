 THE KISS OF THE FITNESS CENTRE

 AD ON VALUE

 It doesn?t take much to realize that fitness ads are a reworking of the frog-prince fable

 You might have heard this story before ? it?s one of those then-and-now homilies. Our hero is a middle-aged, pot-bellied man whose name is, let?s say, Mr Sharma. There was a time when Mr Sharma was slow and lumpy, tipping the scales at 100-odd kilograms. But that was before he stepped into one of those slick, new ?health? clinics. After a short while ? you?re never sure how short it is ? he came out looking trim, fit, confident, and feeling like a college kid. And it?s not just Mr Sharma. There are the Mehras, the Kumars, the Guptas ? the story is the same for sundry other individuals like you and me. Or at least, that is what advertisements of these fitness centres would have you believe. And thereby hangs a tale.

 There is more to these fitness clinic ads than just fitness. Take a closer look at the snapshots featured prominently in them. There are usually two sets of photos. Almost always, the earlier one will show someone like Mr Sharma wearing a grumpy expression and looking dumpy in the shabbiest of clothes. Now look at the post-treatment photo. He?s lost weight, but the same chap is invariably dressed in the smartest pair of jeans and T- shirt money can buy. And if the photographs are that of a woman, you?ll find her swapping her dowdy sari for a natty, sexy dress as soon as she has shed a few kilos.

 It doesn?t take much to realize that the ads are simply a reworking of the crummy old frog-prince fable, where the kiss of the fitness centre will bring about a miraculous change in fortunes. The effort at wish-fulfilment is rather primitive, aimed precisely at fuelling our desires, hemmed in by the mediocrity of our existence ? every guy wants to look good in his leather jacket, every gal covets that hourglass figure.

 But the ads don?t just stop at selling you the myth of the perfect body. They also employ a whole range of half-truths and facile arguments to prove this point. One of these ads promises to ?shape your confidence?, another brings a ?ray of hope? into your gloomy life. One can hardly miss the implications. Being fat means being unpopular and boring. The ads not only perpetuate this stereotype, but also demonize the physical appearance of the fat man. A happy life is possible only if one fits a particular physical description.

 I don?t even want to go into the obvious objections. Sure, these ads show you the easy way out, selling you instant nirvana free of the rigours of hard work. Apparently, these clinics work their wonders without prescribing special diets, meal supplements or medicines. But even medical provenance is not that big an issue. What I find fundamentally demeaning is the way in which these ads display an abomination of the human body. People walking into these clinics don?t remain individuals anymore ? they are dismembered into a grotesque catalogue of thighs, butts, chins and breasts ready to be cut, nipped and tucked into place.

 There are deals on offer that even Shylock would be proud of ? packages that will weigh every bit of excess flesh on your body before putting a price tag on it. Here is a sample: ?Lose up to 8-10 kg + figure correction/skin care/body therapy = Rs 2,990?. Now, you surely can?t say that?s not your money?s worth.

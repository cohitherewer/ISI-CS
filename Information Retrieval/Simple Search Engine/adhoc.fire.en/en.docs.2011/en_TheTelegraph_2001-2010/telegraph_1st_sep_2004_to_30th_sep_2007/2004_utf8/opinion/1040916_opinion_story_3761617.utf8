 CAGED BEAR

 One of the great dilemmas of liberal democracy is putting a limit on freedom. It cannot be anybody?s case ? including the advocates of absolute freedom ? that one group of human beings to protest against their own perceived lack of freedom has the right to take the lives of another group of human beings. This is the reason why within liberal democracy there can be no defence of terrorism. The rise of terrorism in the modern world has forced democratic societies to face this dilemma. The suppression of terrorism invariably involves the curbing of certain freedoms in society. Yet the suppression of freedoms is against the ethos of liberal democracy. There is thus a vicious cycle: terrorism is anti-democracy, the suppression of terrorism also involves anti-democratic measures. Russia, a country with little or no democratic tradition, now faces this dilemma head on. Russia has been the victim of a series of terrorist attacks ? the massacre at Beslan, the bombing of two Russian aircraft and the explosion in a Moscow subway. As a fallout, the Russian president, Mr Vladimir Putin, has proposed a series of measures to eradicate terrorism. Mr Putin wants to put in place a new election law to limit the number of political parties. He also wants to have full control on nominating regional leaders to combat terrorism.

 This has raised the allegation that Mr Putin is using the suppression of terrorism as an alibi to stall the progress of democratic reforms in Russia. Mr Putin is thus being forced to grasp the nettle of liberal democracy: he must ensure that democracy gains roots in Russia; he also must guarantee that terrorist violence does not claim any more innocent lives. Mr Putin has declared a commitment to combat terrorism aggressively but he will have to work out ways in which this can be done without jeopardizing democracy in Russia. Ironically, the complaint that Mr Putin is subverting democracy has come from Mr Colin Powell, the secretary of state of the United States of America. Mr Powell should be only too aware of the problems involved in quelling terrorism while preserving the fundamental freedoms that democracy guarantees. He should not preach to Mr Putin who is in a much more difficult situation given the fact that Russia has no democratic past. Russia needs help and not carping criticism in its fight against terrorism and in the establishment of democracy.

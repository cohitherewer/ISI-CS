 Letters to Editor

 The remaking of a hero

 Sir ? Hong Kong may have forgotten Bruce Lee, but evidently Mostar has not (?Bruce beats Pope to peace?, Sept 13). In this small town in Bosnia ? a country the hero apparently visited only once ? Lee has, by some convoluted collective logic, come to represent the ?last days of the Yugoslav federation? before the ravages of the Nineties tore the country apart. Lee was chosen seemingly because people saw him as their ?working class hero?. One cannot possibly miss here the nostalgia for the pre-war years when Lee?s films provided much entertainment to the population. So overriding is this feeling that both the Pope and Mahatma Gandhi were given the short shrift ? both apostles of peace and yet inseparably intertwined with the politics of religion. Which could mean that more than nostalgia it is probably the disgust with the last that has re-established Lee as the hero of the common man.

 Yours faithfully,

K. Sarkar, Calcutta

 Losing the rat race

 Sir ? A little rat might have thrown the gigantic Yuba Bharati Stadium into darkness but it did manage to throw a great deal of light on the work culture in West Bengal (?Field rat ruins day in field?, Sept 9). Unfortunately, it had to happen in front of the Japanese, the people our chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, is desperately trying to woo into the state. Prepare to start from scratch, Mr CM.

 Yours faithfully,

Chirantan Chakrabarti, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia 

 Sir ? Since bandicoots and field rats are not covered by the national census, it is difficult to chart their prosperity curve in West Bengal. But it must be a rising one, if the blackout in the Salt Lake stadium is anything to go by. 

 Jokes aside, the incident bore evidence of the pitiable state of the power sector in West Bengal. It must be recognized now that Sankar Sen, the former power minister, had been able to pull up the electricity department by its bootstraps. But he failed to survive in politics for too long. With his exit, incompetence and carelessness ? those old friends of Bengal?s workforce ? have gripped the power establishment once again. Neither the areas of Calcutta covered by the state electricity board, nor those under the CESC get uninterrupted power, considered a fundamental amenity in the metropolitan centres of all advanced countries. 

 The chief minister expects industrialists to come in droves and set up shop in his state. But his government cannot complete constructing flyovers on time, nor can it instil a sense of discipline in its police force, or a sense of dedication among teachers. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should revisit the promises he has made in the last two years and tick off the ones that he has kept. He can count them on a finger, I?m sure.

 Right now, the Japanese footballers and officials are probably telling their families how they survived in the land of bandicoots.

 Yours faithfully,

Pronab K. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? A dead rat cannot speak. Or it would have protested against being made to shoulder the blame for the inexcusable negligence of the electricity department. Rats are not state government employees, they have a better work culture. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Rangamati, Midnapore

 Sir ? Salt Lake stadium has witnessed a blackout before, as during a musical extravaganza in the late Eighties. It was followed by complete mayhem, with sandals being thrown around and women being manhandled in the dark. It does not look as though we have learnt any lessons from the past. What happened this September 8 was a matter of greater shame because it involved the stoppage of an international football match for at least 25 minutes. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The flop show at the India-Japan pre-World Cup match does not seem to have caused a dent in the image of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee or his government. For the Tatas have decided to invest in a cancer hospital in the state. But how will the cancer hospital function if there is no power to run its equipment? 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Taken in the flood

 Sir ? Come rains and it is time for our largest industry ? flood relief ? to swing into action. It allows everyone to make a profit. Once the flood season is over, everyone will forget it like a bad dream and get busy with the Pujas. Great care must be taken not to do any effective flood-protection work during the dry season. What is done must go with the next deluge to pave the way for better relief work. The greater the calamity, the bigger the profit. If anyone were serious, the planning for the dry season would have been completed by now and work started immediately after the Pujas. And who will repair the damage done by collecting boulders for river protection?

 Yours faithfully,

A.P. Lahiri, Calcutta

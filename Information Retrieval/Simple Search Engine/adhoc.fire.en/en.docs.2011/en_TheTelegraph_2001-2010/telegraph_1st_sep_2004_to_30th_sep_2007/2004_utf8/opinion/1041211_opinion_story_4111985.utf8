 GOOD HEAVENS!

 Would it be too frivolous to wonder if the almighty has a sense of humour? It would have been quite a revelation to gauge the extent to which the latest nativity tableau at Madame Tussaud?s has stretched the limits of how much kitsch god can tolerate without taking vengeful offence. Kylie Minogue hovers, Tinkerbell-like, as an angel over the Beckhams dressed up as Joseph and Mary, while a harrowed Mr Blair, a half-senile Duke of Edinburgh and a stony-faced Mr Bush look on as the Three Wise Men. The mortal reactions have been varied and significant. The Beckhams don?t care. The Vatican minds terribly. An evangelical reverend has wondered if the museum would dare to do this with something Islamic. But the archbishop of Canterbury?s spokesperson has just said ?Oh dear?? and left it at that ? like a comic parson out of Jane Austen.

 All this might look like part of the trashiness of a postmodern Yuletide. But the matter has a more serious resonance in Britain. The parliament is now debating a bill that might make, among other things, incitement to religious hatred a new criminal offence. This clause in the bill is proving to be the most controversial, and has been linked to post-9/11 anxieties and apprehensions about Britain?s Islamic communities. A prominent voice of protest has been that of Mr Bean. Rowan Atkinson feels that such a law would deprive a democratic society of its valuable right to satirize and lampoon religion. In a free society, there should be no subjects about which one cannot make jokes; and the ?right to offend? is far more important, in his view, than ?any right not to be offended?. Critical irreverence is therefore crucial to both democratic and religious freedom, and inordinate touchiness undermines civilized and vibrant co-existence. In fact, faith leavened by humour may be the best prescription for sanity in matters spiritual, especially as they are played out in the global arena. Atkinson?s conviction is, of course, premised on the distinction not only between hatred and satire, but also between racist abuse and religious ?offence?. The latter may be more difficult to keep apart in the case of the Islamic communities in the West.

 When the Vatican resents the substitution of a nativity play with one about Little Red Riding Hood in an Italian school so as not to offend its Muslim students, or when this particular story is chosen because it depicts the struggle between good and evil, then something has started to go rather complicatedly wrong in relations and perceptions between communities in modern society. Sensitivity ? or assumed sensitivity ? has begun to foster a kind of political correctness that might be seen to keep up, in Atkinson?s words, ?a veneer of tolerance concealing a snakepit of unaired and unchallenged views?. But why must this hyper-sensitivity be invariably associated with Islam? As if Hindu, Catholic and Mosaic earnestnesses have nothing whatsoever to learn from the uniquely human ability to laugh at oneself. Perhaps it is in this one quality that man has not been made in the image of his divine creator.

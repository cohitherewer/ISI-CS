 GROUND BENEATH THEIR FEET

 A national law for refugees will help the government differentiate them from migrants and serve security needs, writes Prerna Sarcar Winter

 Moving house

 A certain minister once claimed that members of the West Bengal cabinet were all refugees! An NRI friend of mine with an expired visa was suddenly termed as a refugee by various people around her.

 India is a not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention and does not have a national legislation regarding refugees. Here a refugee is often confused with an immigrant. What can motivate someone to leave his country and flee to another? It is usually despair at conditions in which one?s life is in danger from violence, destitution, starvation, and constant racial, political or religious abuse. The persecution need not be by the state; it may be instigated by others over whom the state has no control.

 But all cases need not be severe. Adnan Ibrahim Salman is an Iraqi citizen who came to India on a student visa in 1979, and has lived here ever since. He did not return to his country when the Iran-Iraq war began and Iraq called on all its overseas students to return and join the army. 

 The penalty for his non-compliance will be death on return to Iraq. In India, he has been booked under the Foreigners? Act of 1946 for overstaying. He has to prove to the law courts why he should not be deported to Iraq. What complicates his situation is that Adnan did not apply for a refugee certificate once his visa expired. The further complication in his case is that India does not have a national law for refugees.

 There are thousands of cases like Adnan?s and thousands that are worse. But has anything changed to better the situation? No. The attitude to the matter is one of passive indifference. There has also been opposition to a national law for refugees. 

 India in the past has successfully dealt with massive refugee inflows. An estimated 14 million people came into India in 1947, and were assimilated into the population. India?s porous borders allow those who are fleeing easy access into the country, and therefore safe asylum. Drawing upon the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Indian Constitution also provides basic rights to people ?resident on the soil of India?, which would include refugees (part III of the Constitution, that highlights fundamental rights, is applicable to ?all? persons in India). Finally, the National Human Rights Commission safeguards refugee rights without a specific law. Also, the UN High Commission for Refugees is very active in India, although it plays only a ?watch-dog? role, monitoring conditions and ensuring that when refugees return to their country, their repatriation is voluntary. Where is the need to add yet another refugee-specific legislation, when they are being protected through the wider legal framework?

 Thousands of Sri Lankan refugees live in state-run refugee camps. While some camps are well maintained, others are neglected. The authorities keep in special camps those they suspect of being associated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Human rights groups allege that these inmates are sometimes subjected to physical abuse.

 Refugees in India do not have any legal status in the country, their movements are limited and they have no clear protection regime to turn to for help. They fend for themselves in a country where authorities discriminate amongst them on the basis of their country of origin. For example, an Afghan citizen may have his residential permit extended from time to time, but an Iraqi or Sudanese citizen may get a ?leave India? notice soon after his visa expires.

 A national law for refugees would allow the government to distinguish clearly between a migrant and a refugee. It would ensure a rights-based regime and may go a long way in wiping out discrimination. None of the south Asian states has adopted a domestic law for its refugees. If India were to do so, it would encourage others to adopt one as well. This could control the refugee inflow into India. A national law for refugees would also strengthen India?s case for permanent membership of the UN security council.

 There have been earlier proposals for such a law. In 1997, an eminent persons? group drafted a model bill which is still pending. The government?s lethargic response to the need for such a law stems from the conviction that migrants and refugees will have an adverse effect on the internal security and political stability of the country. Also, introducing the law would mean that a cash-strapped government would have to direct some of its resources to ensure their rights.

 But how is letting a flood of people into the country going to help internal security? A national law would allow the state to ensure a mechanism to identify who is a real refugee. Until then, the country is far from stable and secure.

 India receives refugees, has basic rights for them but no law to distinguish the real from the rest. If we were to ever find ourselves in flight, would we not be glad to have our rights protected by the country to which we had escaped? Then why is India shying away from such a duty to humanity?

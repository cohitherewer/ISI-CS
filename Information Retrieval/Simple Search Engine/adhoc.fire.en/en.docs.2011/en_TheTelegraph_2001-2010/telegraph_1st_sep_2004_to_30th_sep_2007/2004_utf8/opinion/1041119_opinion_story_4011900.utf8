 Paperback Pickings

 Will you call her Kelikila or Kilala?

Occidentalism: the west in the eyes of its enemies 

(Penguin, Rs 200) by Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalitis a pioneering 

investigation of anti-Western stereotypes, taking its cue from Said?s Orientalism. 

A whole field of study has developed to analyse and interpret the denigrating 

fantasies of the exotic ?East? that sustained the colonial mind. But what about 

the fantasies of the ?West? in the eyes of its self-proclaimed enemies? These 

are the dreams and stereotypes of the Western world that fuel hatred in the hearts 

of al Qaida and its ilk. This book argues that the origins of those dreams lie 

in the West itself. The West that the jihadis imagine themselves fighting 

is the same menace that has haunted the thoughts of revolutionary groups since 

the early 19th century. 

China (Vintage, ?4.55) by Alan Wallis 

a novel that weaves back and forth between the present and the 20th century that 

formed it, constantly asking what art contributes to life and whether life can 

ever survive for long without it. Digby Wilton was once heir to an English pottery 

company. Now in old age, he contemplates the history of that company as he reflects 

upon the contemporary world. He stares with a tragic eye at the society that surrounds 

him. His own heir is Theo, who wishes to ignore history and immerse himself in 

his passion for jazz. ?Theo loved jazz from the first time he?d heard it. He loved 

the way, with every single song, the principle of order, fragile thing that it 

was, would be given a run for its money by the heavy weight of randomness all 

around it. The unprovided for; the unforeseen.?

The penguin book of hindu names for girls (Penguin, 

Rs 200) by Maneka Gandhi is a a delightfully entertaining book that 

makes no demand on one?s brain and nerves. Open it at random, and each page is 

an endless flow of words and etymologies that can be just tripped on the tongue 

like gentle ululation. Under K, for instance, there are names like Kavyamata, 

Kayadhu, Kekayi, Kelaka and ? incredibly? Kelikila, which means ?sport or amusement, 

and is another name for Rati. There is also Kilala a little way down, meaning 

nectar or wine. And Kili, meaning parrot. Did you know that a wife of Usinara 

was called Krmi, which means silkworm, ant or lacinsect?

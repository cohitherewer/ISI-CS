 Letters to Editor

 Many roads, single goal

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta?s concerns about who exactly heralded the recent ?expansion? of the Hindu social sector are understandable since hitherto Hinduism was kept separate from politics (?Trials of a pioneer?, Nov 19). Certain realities are now common knowledge ? especially the vote-bank politics and the appeasement of minorities. Dasgupta also misses the point when he claims that the Ramakrishna Mission has shed ?Hinduness for universalism?. Universality is the underlying theme of Hinduism ? if not all established religions ? which addresses the spiritual quest of mankind. The Mission is doing just that, steering clear of any political involvement. Roads to such a goal may differ considering the time, place and cultural backdrop to the birth of different religions, but no serious student of religion can deny that they all lead to the same end. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Landed in trouble

 Sir ? ?Land shakes under Basu, judge feet? (Nov 20) is an interesting development. But one almost feels sorry for Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee. His is not the first allegation of an executive-judiciary nexus, nor is it perhaps the last. What Banerjee perhaps lacked was the finesse to execute the deal. He could have allowed some time to lapse before overturning his previous judgment, cancelling plot allotments, to one which enabled only the chief minister to grant plots from his discretionary quota, which benefitted him.

 The incident is an eye-opener. One can only imagine what will be unearthed if a thorough investigation is conducted to see how many other judges like Banerjee acquired land in Salt Lake (or admitted their children to medical colleges through the now-extinct chief minister?s quota). The only positive side to this dirty story is that the apex court?s stand will go a long way in reaffirming people?s faith in the judiciary. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is common knowledge that judicial decisions are often allowed to be politically influenced in exchange for undue favours. It is a pity that members of the judiciary should themselves abet this practice. Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee?s role is condemnable. A committee should be formed by the apex court to keep a watch so that this shameful nexus is curbed.

 Yours faithfully, 

Sudarsan Nandi, Rangamati, Midnapore

 Sir ?The chronology of events between June 8, 1987 and November 19, 2004, surrounding the land allotment fiasco in Salt Lake, has the potential of being made into a Bollywood blockbuster. What tickles most is Jyoti Basu?s novel excuse, ?But I did not know?? Incidents of misuse of power and discretion vested in high offices abound ? the petrol pump scams, the cement fraud in Mumbai, the Delhi housing allotment scandal, to name a few. These incidents need to be kept alive in public memory and a film on any of them could be one way of doing it.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta 

 Sir ? There is no denying that corrupt judges deserve the maximum penalty. B.P. Banerjee has been asked to vacate his house in Salt Lake. But as a saving grace, he is to be compensated in cash for vacating it. This is almost like holding back the punishment that Banerjee deserves. 

 Also, one should not forget that the petitioner had to go to the highest court of the land. Does this mean that there is little hope for ordinary people who seek justice against unscrupulous political leaders? The answer should be self-evident, particularly in West Bengal. Many aspects of public service in the state have been rotten to the core for a long time. The alleged deal between a high court judge and an incumbent chief minister 17 years ago reflects the same decay that has set in among the high-ranking public servants in the state. Unfortunately, this appalling situation has not changed even after Jyoti Basu?s retirement. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? The Supreme Court?s cancellation of the land allotment to B.P. Banerjee is akin to dealing with only the symptom of a disease. Around 30 other people had received the same gift, many of them judges. Why has only Banerjee been hauled up?

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? If Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee?s house in Salt Lake has come under the scanner after all these years, it is time to remind ourselves that Jyoti Basu?s accommodation, Indira Bhavan, in the same area is at a huge cost to taxpayers. His luxurious lifestyle, violating communist ideals, speaks volumes about him.

 Yours faithfully, 

Sunil Kumar Pal, London

 Sir ? The discretionary quota should be abolished and land allotted only through auction. If the government wishes to help a beneficiary it can pay for the land on behalf of the latter.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

 Letters to Editor

 Not just politics

 Sir ? Bhaskar Ghose?s ?What?s left of Bengal? (Dec 9) traces the socio-political brutalization of Bengal in the last three decades, but the state?s citizens may have noticed its rapid cultural degeneration as well. When the community?s civility was drowning in the ?red storm?, its equally famed affinity for fine culture was also taking a beating. Nowadays, classical music concerts get only four paragraphs in newspapers; art exhibitions draw page 3 journalists, while seminars are attended only by senior citizens. Puja pandals, on the other hand, have become the high point of culture, displaying all the coarseness and greed of Bengali society. The quintessential Bengal has been decimated by the combined onslaught of Delhi-ification and bandhs. Unlike communist Russia, its poor Indian cousin has completely failed on the cultural front. The bhadralok have been replaced by the bandarlog.

 Yours faithfully,

V.P. Singha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Bhaskar Ghose exemplifies his non-parochial outlook by crediting all boorishness to Bengalis alone. His suggestion that trade unions like the Centre of Indian Trade Unions and coordination committees be dismantled to make way for a prosperous Bengal is no less brilliant. Being a member of the elite, Ghose cannot be blamed for taking up the cudgels on behalf of industrialists and bureaucrats, all members of his class. Industrialists should hold the right to hire and fire employees at will, and lower-level government employees must hold no rights to protest against all-powerful secretaries and politicians who treat them as bearers. By the same logic, slum-dwellers should also preferably be banished beyond the city so that the land can be used to build business. Bravo Ghose!

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The ?agents of terror? need to be brutally crushed to put Bengal on the road to growth. Individuals or groups cannot be allowed to take the state to anarchy. It is time to reassess the relevance of aggressive means like bandhs, which do more harm than good. Any situation which demands political intervention, should be attended to without letting it deteriorate. Politicians are in the habit of doing so to gain a brownie point over their rivals. An early solution to such matters can stop people from taking recourse to bandhs. Anyway, supporters of bandh politics cannot be said to truly feel for the poor. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? Bhaskar Ghose does not shy away from calling a spade a spade. The Bengal that was once India?s pride, has now become its shame. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has a tough challenge ahead of him. Not only does he have to convince investors that West Bengal is an attractive investment destination, but he also has to fight his own battle with his more hardline party cadre, who still swear by Marx and Lenin. If it is to be counted as an elite among Indian states, West Bengal has to upgrade its infrastructure, loosen regulations and, most important, tame the militant trade unions. As Ghose points out, a whole generation of Bengalis have been taught to hate entrepreneurs. They need to realize that it is the businessman who creates wealth, and in Deng Xiaoping?s words, ?To be rich is glorious?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Earlsdon, UK

 Sir ? In his tirade against the trade union movement, Bhaskar Ghose describes unions as ?monsters?, ?savage organizations? and ?agents of generations of terror? and holds them responsible for all the ills that plague Bengal. This obscures the real issue. Across the world, people are witnessing assaults on their livelihood by globalization, which is widening inequalities. According to the International Labour Organization, 186 million are unemployed and 550 million underemployed. The figures also show that 1.3 billion live in absolute poverty, mostly in the third world which is shouldering the burden of the economic crisis. Nobel laureate and former chief economist of the World Bank, Joseph Stiglitz, has himself stated how he witnessed first hand the devastating effect of globalization on developing countries, especially the poor. 

 Thus, factors contributing to the lack of economic development in the country, and not only in West Bengal, lie elsewhere ? in the policies enunciated by the Central government in support of globalization. Ghose should have realized the important role played by the trade union movement in building up resistance to such policies throughout the country. It is this movement which has saved the country from the crisis that swamped the south-east Asian nations. It is ironical that this realization eludes Ghose. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Biswas, Calcutta

 Value for money

 Sir ? The article, ?A touch of class? (Dec 18), mentions that the annual fees at both DPS Megacity and the Heritage School add up to around Rs 80,000. But this can lead to misconceptions. Even for the first year, the annual cost comes to around Rs 77,000 which includes admission fees, security deposit, transportation cost as well as the development charge. From the second year, the amount is Rs 42, 000 approximately which includes transportation cost.

 Yours faithfully,

Anindita Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Paperback Pickings

 In an unfriendly world

Who are we? america?s great debate (Penguin, 

Rs 350) by Samuel P. Huntington is a sort of sequel to this Harvard 

professor?s famous, or infamous, book on the ?clash of civilizations?. Huntington 

takes pride in being not only a scholar but also a patriot, anxiously engaging 

with ?the changes occurring in the salience and substance of American national 

identity?, particularly after a ?new wave of immigrants from Latin America and 

Asia?. Huntington?s concern is with the preservation of America?s currently threatened 

?Anglo-Protestant? core. His vision is of a ?revitalized America reaffirming its 

historic Anglo-Protestant culture, religious commitments, and values and bolstered 

by confrontations with an unfriendly world?. Naipaul will love this book, and 

Hindutvawallahs should be excited to see their pet themes given Ivy-League 

respectability.

Amrita (Rupa, Rs 295) by Usha Rajagopalan 

starts with Gauri, whose world collapses on her hearing that she is an illegitimate 

child, borne out of her mother?s liaison with Raghu. Gauri subsequently gets involved 

with Raghu?s family, traumatized by the violent death of their mentally challenged 

daughter, Amrita, on the night of her sister?s wedding. Why and how Amrita dies 

is given to Gauri by Raghu?s family in several versions. But in each version, 

Amrita is the cross to be borne. 

The puffin book of legendary lives (Puffin, 

Rs 250) by Meena Arora Nayak takes the reader back in time to an India 

where life was lived according to extraordinary codes, where an emperor?s whim 

could mean the difference between life and death, where a single transgression 

could lead to banishment, or worse, and where an individual could change the entire 

course of a civilization. Valmiki, Amrapali, Razia, Tansen, Jehangir, Mother Lalla, 

Guru Nanak ? lives filled with the conflicts between love and honour, faith and 

duty, loyalty and liberty. Interesting illustrations by Jayachandran Nanu.

The cambridge curry club (Black- Amber, 

?8.99) by Saumya Balsari is a humour columnist?s ironic, postcolonial 

romp through the intertwined lives around a charity shop called IndiaNeed on 

Cambridge?s Mill Road. Everything seems to be going wrong here. How was an adult 

video of Snow White and Seven Dwarfs sold with the Lego? Disaster, death and romance 

appear on the menu as three women of Indian origin and a fierce Irishwoman battle 

their arrogant Armani-clad English employer. Will the bungling heroines survive 

despite lovers, husbands and eccentric customers?

The inheritors (Penguin, Rs 295) by 

Aruna Chakravarti traces the history of a Vaidic Kulin Brahmin family from 

a small village in Bengal in 1897 to Mumbai and Cologne in 2000. It is the story 

of puritanism and perversion, silences, insanities and liberations, of orthodox 

men and smouldering women. Chakravarti draws upon history and myth, rituals and 

culinary practices to flesh out a story of historical change in the interiors 

of a family and community. There is, therefore, a great deal of period clutter 

and a tendency towards over-writing: ?He saw how anger and resentment, wounded 

pride, thwarted sexual passion, brooding hate and passionate love had warred in 

her blood, the turbulent currents clashing in midstream, raising walls and dams 

against her own flesh and blood.?

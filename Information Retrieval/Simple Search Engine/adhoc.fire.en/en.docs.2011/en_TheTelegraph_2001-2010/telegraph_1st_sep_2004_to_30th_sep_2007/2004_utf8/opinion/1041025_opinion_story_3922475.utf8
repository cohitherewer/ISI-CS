 SHOT IN THE DARK

 It could happen only in a police state. The policemen who shot dead R.K. Sanajaoba Singh on an Imphal street because he did not make way for their vehicle symbolized the arrogance and insensitivity of state power. Only superficially was the incident a tragic end of a heated moment. The deeper truth must lie in the extreme desensitization of at least a section of the force. It is not difficult to see why this has happened. The battle against Manipur?s ethnic insurgency makes the police and other forces alternately nervous and high-handed. Unfortunately, the common people often fall victim to the oppressive ways of the state. Ironically, the public anger that such brutalities spark help the militants? pernicious propaganda. The fact that the victim this time was the brother of a former chief minister, Mr R.K. Jaichandra Singh, shows the helplessness of ordinary people in the face of state repression. Parallels have obviously been drawn between the latest tragedy and the death of a young woman, Thangjam Manorama, in the custody of the Assam Rifles, which rocked Manipur recently. But Manorama was suspected of having links with the militants, even though that was no justification for her custodial death. Singh?s death is far more shocking. 

 The chief minister, Mr Okram Ibobi Singh, needs to act fast and firmly to punish the guilty policemen. He should make it clear to the police force that it cannot hope to get away with murder. The government?s action is also crucial to its attempts to regain the people?s confidence in the rule of law. If this confidence is shaken, the government may find it increasingly difficult to tackle militancy. A sensitive and responsible government can get the people on its side in the battle against insurgency. In fact, the chief minister can take the tragedy as a warning and set about introducing measures to prevent such incidents. The recent turmoil in Manipur prompted New Delhi to appoint an advisor to the Union government on issues relating to the state. A ?unified command?, comprising the army, the paramilitary forces and the police, like the one now in place in Assam, has taken charge in Manipur only a few weeks back. But the fight against the militants would be weakened if the common people are estranged from it. Killing an innocent man on the street is no way for the police to gain the people?s confidence.

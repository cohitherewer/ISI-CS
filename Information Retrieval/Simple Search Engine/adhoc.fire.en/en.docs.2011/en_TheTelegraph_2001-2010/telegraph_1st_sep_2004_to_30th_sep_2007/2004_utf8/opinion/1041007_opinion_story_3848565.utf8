 WHAT IS IT TO BE NORMAL?

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 T wo tales from two different cities recently sparked off a lot of controversy. One pertained to the country?s defence, the other to its civil administration. While the women in Manipur communicated their ?no confidence? in the Indian government in their own way, the women in Nagpur challenged India?s ?rule of law?.

 But why did the women of Manipur have to stage their naked revolt? Also, why did the women in Nagpur have to enter the court room and kill an undertrial in front of the judge and the police, the most visible arm of the state? Few would be bothered to find answers to the questions given that there is hardly any concern for probity in public life. But a decay in both the army and civil administration may mean death for the country. 

 Nagpur pathetically exposed the failure of both the judiciary and the police. The women?s complete lack of confidence in the administration had translated into a visible contempt for the police and legal machinery. This contempt remains since the women of Nagpur have no regret or remorse for their action. 

 One may disagree with the women of Nagpur, but one cannot but admire their courage and determination to seek ?justice?. The common disgust for the rampant administrative corruption may, in fact, turn many into supporters of such direct action. And this is where the fear lies. Public fury could endanger the lives of many civil servants in the country. Yet governments will not talk of minimizing corruption. The 1999 promise of a ?zero level tolerance of corruption? has not been fulfilled. 

 Good behaviour

 What could be the cause of this indifference to the cancer of corruption? After all, the problems of illegal migration, devastating price rise, deaths from spurious drugs, liquor, or growing terrorism and crime ? which incessantly worry us ? can all be connected to corruption. Yet it was this indifference to corruption that ultimately drove the women of Manipur and Nagpur to take such extreme measures.

 The insensitivity has reached Himalayan proportions in Manipur. Had it not been so, Assam Rifles?s actions, however ?unpardonable?, could not have been allowed to result in a total paralysis of the state. This is not to say that the Assam Rifles?s activities are not reprehensible. But instead of simply castigating the army, we should have used this occasion to ask some more pertinent questions. Why and when does a man in uniform commit a rape and murder? Certainly, not under normal circumstances. But then, why should a man in uniform act abnormal? Could it be because of low morale, frustration, breakdown of discipline or the influence of the most abnormal civilian conditions? 

 Seeing is believing

 Let?s look at the last factor more closely. The Indian soldier today directly interacts with the civilian. Gone are the days of secluded cantonments. The soldiers are now in the midst of the maddening crowd. They see chaos, corruption, nepotism, parochialism and communalism. Since seeing is believing, it affects the soldiers too. The men in uniform were recruited and trained to fire on the enemy in the frontier. Today, they are duty-bound to fire on their own countrymen. And if one can kill the unruly civilian, can rape and murder be far behind? 

 It is perhaps time to ponder over the army?s role in internal security. It is indispensable in Kashmir, where for the last 57 years there has been no distinction between external threat and internal security. The situation is different in other parts of India. We have to remember that prolonged civilian duty is bound to be self-defeating and demoralizing for troops who are meant to fight external foes.

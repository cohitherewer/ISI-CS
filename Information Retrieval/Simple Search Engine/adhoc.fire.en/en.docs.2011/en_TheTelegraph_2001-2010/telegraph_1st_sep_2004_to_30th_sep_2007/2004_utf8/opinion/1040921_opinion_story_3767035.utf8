 Letters to Editor

 Doll?s house

 Sir ? The chain of events outlined in the report, ?Jawan gets his Gudia back? (Sept 20) is straight out of a C-grade Bollywood potboiler. That it should actually happen is a pointer to the sad state of women ? an issue that has been done to death, but still manages to stupefy. How is it that the panchayat in Aurangabad never thought of asking Gudia what she wanted? Did she want to be ?restored? to her first husband, the army jawan, Mohammed Arif, who has been released after five years of incarceration in a Pakistani jail? Or would she rather remain with the man she married again, after waiting four years without any news for Arif?s return, and by whom she is pregnant? With its order, the panchayat has shown that Indian women are no better than chattel, palmed off from father to husband and thence to any male who will give them their name in lieu of taking on their bed and board. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shamik Guha, Calcutta

 The long shadow

 Sir ? Rudrangshu Mukherjee makes the apt point that September 1, 1939, the day the Nazis invaded Poland, was ill-chosen as anti-war day (?Fighting shadows?, Sept 5). The real war did not begin until the spring of 1940, when Germany annexed Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Holland and France, as a prelude to launching air raids on Britain ? after making sure of Russia?s neutrality. Celebrating September 1 as an anti-war day is to put, by implication, the former Soviet Union as much in the dock as Nazi Germany. For even as the German forces were invading Poland, killing and maiming thousands, Josef Stalin invaded Poland from the east. The hapless country had no chance against this double attack. In the end, Germany and Russia divided Poland between themselves. 

 Moreover, taking advantage of the no-war pact between Berlin and Moscow, Stalin advanced westward, taking the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia; northward, invading Finland; and then southward, annexing southern Ukraine and Bessarabia (Romania). Earlier, during World War I too, the Germans had intervened in Russia by backing the Bolsheviks. After the Revolution, Alexander Kerensky, the head of the provisional government, did not surrender to Germany. But after he ousted Kerensky, V.I. Lenin took Russia out of the Alliance, concluded peace with Germany and gave the Germans a Russian territory many times the size of Germany itself. Who knows whether Germany did not have a hand in the October Revolution? For the Germans, it ensured the end of the Russian challenge.

 For a long time, Stalin did not understand Hitler?s ploy and mistakenly saw in the no war pact of August 1939, an opportunity to extend Russian influence in western Europe. The illusion nearly brought Russia within an inch of defeat and cost it 20 million civilian lives. 

 Mukherjee is right in saying that that the left would be better off celebrating anti-war day on June 22, for on that day Russia stopped being a Nazi collaborator. 

 In India too, the communists, under advice from Moscow via the British communists, changed course on the grounds that Britain was no more an imperialist power but an ally of Russia in the fight against the Fascists.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The article, ?Fighting shadows?, reminded me of an incident that reportedly occurred in the heady days soon after the Left Front came to power in West Bengal. The erstwhile front supremo was at a dinner hosted by the Soviet consul in Calcutta but left in a huff because the host reminded his guest in a tete-a-tete that the generation of the early Eighties in Russia were re-evaluating Stalin. Our communists? adherence to antiquated perceptions can be traced to their insecurity following the collapse of the Soviet Union. They little ponder over September 1939 or remember who was Hitler?s bedfellow for the next two years he was on the rampage. Hence, their apparently nonchalant historical references. 

 Also, the hullabaloo over investment in West Bengal is largely due to the sunshine BPO industry. Ironically, unions are banned in this industry and anybody can be asked to take a walk the day his customer satisfaction ratings plummet. But, the left government here has no qualms riding on the crest of the BPOs? presence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? Further to Rudrangshu Mukherjee?s ?Fighting shadows?, may I add that the communists are not against war, however much they may organize peace marches? After all the Marxists believe ?power comes out of the barrel of a gun?. The forceful annexation of Tibet and the landing of troops in east Europe after World War II speak eloquently about their warring mindset. Incidentally, where were the comrades with their anti-war slogans when China was at war with India? If the communists are really interested in peace, why do not they go to Kashmir and teach the terrorists the virtues of peace? They dare not. Instead of taking on the real enemies of peace, the Marxists prefer to give slogans from a safe lair. Discretion is the better part of their valour. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Prize catch

 Sir ? How could the committee which chose whom to give the prestigious Dronacharya award pick on Rajender Singh, the sacked coach of the Indian hockey team? Either his unceremonious sacking was wrong or the award announced for him unjustified. While the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award for Rajyavardhan Rathore may have been a response to his getting for India its first-ever individual silver in the Olympics, the claims of Anju Bobby George too must not be undervalued. After all, these awards are given on basis of performance in the last three years. Surely both Rathore and George could have been jointly honoured?

 Yours faithfully, 

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

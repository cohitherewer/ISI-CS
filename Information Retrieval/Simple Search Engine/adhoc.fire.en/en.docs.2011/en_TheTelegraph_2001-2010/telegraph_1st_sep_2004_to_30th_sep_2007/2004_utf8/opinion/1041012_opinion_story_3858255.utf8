 FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH 

The eclipse of the older formations that held in them 

the seeds of an alternative political grouping is responsible for the rise of 

the BSP in Maharashtra, writes Mahesh Rangarajan 

 Fill in the blanks 

There is little doubt that the western state of Maharashtra 

is in a state of political ferment. This may not be evident in the course of the 

electoral campaign but the undercurrents are too evident to be missed. By the 

end of the present electoral cycle, virtually no key player will emerge unchanged. 

The main battle-lines are drawn between the Shiv Sena-led saffron alliance, that 

hopes to return to power in the mantralaya, and the Congress-led Democratic 

Front. But no one can afford to ignore the new player on the scene in the shape 

of the Bahujan Samaj Party. Once a non-entity in the state, it made waves last 

May by capturing 3 per cent of the popular vote.

The importance of this becomes evident only in light 

of the polarized state of the polity. The two fronts were separated by a mere 

3 per cent votes. To all intents and purposes, the performance of Mayavati?s party 

probably denied the Congress and its allies victory in as many as 8 Lok Sabha 

seats. The impact was magnified by the fact that the core of the BSP?s strength 

lay in the Vidarbha region, once a bastion of the Congress. Not only does the 

region have a Dalit population of over 20 per cent, it was also unusual in the 

extent to which the Dalit occupational base was diversified even a century ago. 

Across the Marathi-speaking region, every village had a Maharwada, and 

the Mahars, the most populous of the depressed classes, owned small plots of watan 

land in return for their services. But in Vidarbha, many became petty traders, 

cultivators and carpenters. 

The BSP also broke into the vote bank of the Republican 

Party of India, many of whose faction-prone leaders are now coming together to 

face Mayavati?s challenge. In fact, the attack against the older RPI Dalit leadership 

is not unlike that launched in the early Seventies by the Dalit Panthers against 

a supine pro-Congress Dalit leadership. Now the RPI itself has largely been reduced 

to the role of a camp follower of different upper caste-led parties. Vidarbha 

also has a specific sub-regional dimension that the BSP has latched onto far better 

than would be expected of a party that is rooted in the Hindi-speaking Ganga valley, 

namely the cause of statehood. While both the larger parties have stepped away 

from the idea of a separate state of Vidarbha, Mayavati has made it a demand. 

She has strongly emphasized this in her meetings in each of the 11 districts of 

the Vidarbha. 

Strange as it may sound, only the demise of the Congress-led 

alliance can enable a rapid growth of the BSP in the state as a whole. Dalits 

comprise a smaller proportion of the population than in Uttar Pradesh, and have 

traditionally been allied with the Congress or with one of the factions of the 

RPI. The Shiv Sena, despite its slogan of ?Bhim shakti?, and the Bharatiya 

Janata Party, are both stronger among the upper strata. Yet, the broader penumbra 

of the other backward classes is not quite the force it is in north India. The 

OBCs are fragmented and divided between different political parties. It is to 

woo them that Mayavati has given over 100 seats to the OBCs. 

Maharashtra has had a very critical place in the evolution 

of the BSP as a party. It was while he was posted as an employee in the ordinance 

factory in Nagpur that an employee, Kanshi Ram, first launched an agitation to 

declare the birthday of B.R. Ambedkar as a holiday. In 1984, his employees? union, 

the Bamcef, which provided the nuclei for the creation of a political party, was 

stronger in Maharashtra than that in many other states. In fact, Kanshi Ram?s 

support base in the state was described as ?small but widespread, mainly on account 

of the union-level work of the Federation?.

In his early days, the future founder of the BSP was 

an RPI- sympathizer, but he was marked as one who would move on beyond its narrow 

ambit. This was evident in the very choice of the name ?bahujan? rather 

than Dalit as an epithet for the party.

The term was first used by the 19th-century social 

reformer, Jyoti Rao Phule. But in practice, it was co-opted by the large and populous 

community of the Maratha-Kunbis. The latter have dominated state politics in general 

and the Congress in particular. Unlike in the north again, Mayavati faces an uphill 

task due to the persistence of the Congress. No wonder she has the maximum number 

of candidates ? 272 in 288 seats. The aim is to create a broad net for catching 

votes. The aim will also be to play a decisive role in a host of contests: last 

May, her party came third in as many as 124 assembly segments. This time, she 

hopes to lead in and win a few seats. 

On the face of it, Maharashtra is fertile ground for 

Dalit-led politics. The literacy rate is significantly higher than in the north. 

The number of government employees and school teachers is also larger. Though 

the BSP has no direct association with Buddhism, the revival of the faith as a 

religion of dignity and assertion will stand it in good stead. But it is no mean 

task to create and sustain a third force in a highly polarized state, as Sharad 

Pawar found to his cost. What will work to the advantage of the BSP is the slow 

eclipse of the older formations that held in them the seeds of an alternative. 

The end of the textile industry has put paid to communism in the oldest strongholds 

of labour militancy in the country. The agrarian parties like the Peasants and 

Workers? Party are past their peak. The older Dalit leadership has been unable 

to win any significant share of power except in name. Issues of poverty and agrarian 

distress have no real champion.

It is this political vacuum that has enabled Mayavati 

to make a splash. But this is her first really big electoral test outside the 

Hindi belt after becoming president of the party. Until now, there has been a 

deep disconnect between Dalit politics in north India and western India. In the 

former, electoral politics has had a primacy, be it in the case of Ram Vilas Paswan 

or Kanshi Ram. 

In Maharashtra, a long history of social and cultural 

reform movements preceded political assertion. It is the crisis point reached 

by Dalit politics and by the Congress in the state that has given the BSP the 

opening it has long looked for south of the Vindhyas. While focussing on the bigger 

players, few seem to have grasped that a core anti-Sena voting group may well 

be marching to the beat of a different drum. Were this to happen, it will be part 

of the unravelling of the older social alliances that have defined the political 

landscape of western India for decades.

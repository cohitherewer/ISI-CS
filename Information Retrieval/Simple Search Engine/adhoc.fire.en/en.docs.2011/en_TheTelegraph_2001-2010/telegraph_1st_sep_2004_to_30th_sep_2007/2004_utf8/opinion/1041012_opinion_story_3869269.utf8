 THERE IS ONLY ONE FASHION

 Malvika Singh

 Sabyasachi Mukherjee returned to India after a successful fashion show in Milan and said, very aptly, that there is no infrastructure in India for fashion. He is right. There is no infrastructure for anything in this country except for corruption of all manner and kind. It is the only area where we have excelled and could compete with any country that has not been able to dispense basic dignity to its people. Our descent into an abyss has been so rapid that the next generation will have the thankless task of trying to bring back a semblance of decency into the public space.

 The BJP came to power screaming blue murder about the corruption of the Congress, how the machinery of governance had been contaminated and how its first priority would be to cleanse the system. It did nothing at all in this area. In fact, the rot grew, decomposed and got further entrenched in the soil of this long-suffering and ruthlessly exploited land. The privileged seem to relish the perverse fact that they who make the law have a god-given right to break it. Our elected representatives indulge in illegalities with abandon, often glee, because of their special privileges. Parliamentarians must have exactly the same rights as the citizens of this country, nothing more, nothing less. They should pay for their keep themselves and should not be propped up by legitimate and honest tax-payers or the state exchequer. All perks should be removed immediately and thereafter, they should be given the choice of whether they want to be in politics or find other things to do. Today, they are there for the freebie, for making the quick buck, for grabbing what they can lay their hands on.

 Of no import

 Small wonder that they race about in cars with lights and guards, breaking all road rules, behaving like zombies out of the Wild West. Clearly, they are guilty of some misdeed that we are not in the know of, which is why they need to be surrounded by a body of protectors. They feel like ?very important persons? when traffic is held up to allow their cavalcades to pass. If only they could hear the juicy curses that people throw out of their forcibly stalled cars. They become oblivious to the reality around them. They know it all. They are eventually thrown out. They sulk. Then they fight every democratic norm in pique. They behave like reprimanded children who have had their lollipops taken away. They are first-time leaders and cannot bear to leave their plush government homes with their endless trappings. Governance is of no import to them, self-indulgence and aggrandizement are the call of the day. These are ?first generation cravings?. They have no idea of what it is to be truly important.

 If you are of eminence, powerful and influential, you can travel in a taxi and you will make an impact. You can enter a room and wherever you stand or sit, people will gravitate. Accompanied by the tamasha, you are seen to be a lightweight show-off with nothing to show! That is how the general public views it. Grovellers will grovel regardless. I recall the days when Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi moved about the city with one person other than the driver accompanying them. It was post-?protection? that two prime ministers were assassinated. It speaks volumes about the quality of security in India.

 A recent survey has shown that the highest percentage of politicians with criminal records belong to the Samajwadi Party, the BSP, the BJP, the RJD and ?others?. The Congress has the lowest number of such incumbents. The left has none. So much for all that loud rhetoric about how the Congress had debased politics in India and how the BJP was going to be the great cleansing agent. Sadly, it merely pushed the deterioration deeper into the abyss. Corruption went to an all-time high. It is time to reform.

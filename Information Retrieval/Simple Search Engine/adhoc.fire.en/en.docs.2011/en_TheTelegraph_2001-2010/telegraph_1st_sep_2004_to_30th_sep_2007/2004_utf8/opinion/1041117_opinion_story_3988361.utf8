 THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING DRIVEN

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 Why do so many Calcuttans shy away from driving their own car?

 There are more driver-driven private cars in Calcutta than in any other metropolis in India. For some odd reason, the decision to employ a driver is almost coterminous with the decision to buy a car in this city. No, I don?t have any proof for my contention, other than the experience of having lived in or visited all the major metros in the country. I doubt whether the NSS or any market research agency has ever thought of looking into this aspect of the Calcuttan psyche. And anyway, what Disraeli is supposed to have said about lies, damned lies and statistics still holds true. 

 Now why do so many Calcuttans shy away from driving their own cars? Is it that the roads in Calcutta are far more dangerous than elsewhere? They may be, but that?s neither here nor there. For the roads are hardly any more dangerous for car-owners than they are for others, especially pedestrians. Also, I am sure car-owners aren?t thinking of saving pedestrians from their own inept driving when they hire drivers. 

 If anything, car-owners are only thinking of themselves and want to be spared the hassles of negotiating roads made hazardous by jaywalkers. In short, they are both lazy and risk-averse. They would rather it was the driver who handled the onerous task of stepping on the brake every time an intrepid pedestrian decided to risk injury, or death, in his haste to cross the road, or shouted abusively at drivers of public buses. Perhaps car-owners think that it takes the rough and ready ways of the under-classes, learnt in the bustees where most of the drivers live, to tackle the dog-eat-dog world of Calcutta roads. And who can blame them for thinking so? If there is anything that the Marxists? class-warfare theories have induced in Bengalis, it is a consciousness of the universality of class distinctions. Thus, a bhadralok car-owner somehow needs his chokra driver to remind him of his own gentility, of his having made it in life. 

 Perhaps the predilection for drivers also has something to do with those black and white films of yore, in which a patrician Chhabi Biswas or a dignified Pahari Sanyal sat in the back seat of a car ? the very picture of authority in repose ? while he is being driven by a (generally) white-uniformed chauffeur behind the wheel. (Remember the song, Bhadder ghar ka ledki bhaage daraibhar ka saath from Chaddabesi? Through the medium of comedy, it dramatizes the class tensions that arise when the rich girl, supposed to sit at the back, dares to sit in front beside the driver.) 

 For those buying a car, it?s a way of announcing that, by these old-world standards, they have arrived. At least, car-owners don?t insist on the uniform nowadays. Or perhaps it would be closer to the truth to say that they would if they could. With the price of petrol being what it is, the monthly instalment for the car and the salary of the driver, keeping the car on the road stretches the resources of all but those whose company pays for the fuel and maintenance. But for all my fastidious dislike of uniforms, and all their connotations of straitjacketed hierarchy, the poor unemployed youth should have no reason to complain even if they were made to wear one. 

 For as long as Bengalis buy cars, they shall need someone to drive them, and the drivers will make enough to keep body and soul together.

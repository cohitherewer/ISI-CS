 ILL MET AT AIRPORT

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Being away from Delhi cleanses the soul! Away from the mindless political banter, the horrendous traffic snarls, the high public noise level, the filth, the same old boring social activities, all make this city predictable and more often than not, dull. It is embarrassing, but we do not compare with any world capital in energy levels, activity, style and sophistication. Nowhere is it like it is here. 

 Entering the airport is like walking into a hell hole with long, slow queues waiting patiently while some semi-retarded immigration officer who can barely use his computer, fiddles around for a good five minutes before he stamps your passport. If you are unlucky, it will take a minimum of ten minutes. Now calculate how long it will take to clear two arriving aircraft. And, invariably, there are only two counters open instead of six. 

 Shivraj Patil should change this ineptitude and make life easier for normal people who have opted to live here as well as those who come to visit. This unwelcoming welcome is the first impact of the great Incredible India campaign and all it takes is one order to rectify this horrible first impression. Our officials travel far and wide but never use their experience to change the horrors of Indian airports, immigration and customs. They should be made to stand in the queue like all the others?only then will there be a systemic change.

 Reaching out

 The mind flits back to London, to a great show that has opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum called ?Encounters?. It deals with the different encounters ? political, cultural, social and commercial ? between the West and the East, from 1500 to 1800. It is remarkable in its depiction of the mutual fascination that these parts of the globe had for each other. The joint curators, Amin Jaffer with Anna Jackson, have put together a rare and enlightening exhibit that will alas, not visit the countries along the great route within which were built lasting relationships. If only the Mittals of the world were as dedicated to the ?history of joint ventures? as they are to hosting lavish weddings in historic environs, such exhibitions could travel. Maritime exploration was the beginning of international trade. Therefore corporate organizations, such as the Mittals and the Agarwals, based in London, doing business across the globe, should be active in this. Trust a Japanese group to take the lead and sponsor this show. When will the Indian diaspora mature, give back from where it has taken?

 Why do no corporate houses in India and Indian corporate houses overseas ever involve themselves in activities that are cerebral? Why are their ?donations? only political or centred around their personal aggrandizement? Why have they not made an impact in the larger, cultural public domain? Why so parochial? We were never sterile in our attitude nor were we compartmentalized in our business thinking. Our ethos was rooted in a socio-cultural base. Commerce too was connected with people and culture. It was this heady mix that made the Indian subcontinent an area that attracted peoples from across the world. Emerging from colonial exploitation was tough, but rather than creating our own brand we carried the colonial one into post-independence India and got caught up in knots. The time has come to unravel the strings and break loose. Dream and create.

 Let us look forward to a memorable show, sponsored by L.N. Mittal or Anil Agarwal for a start, at the V amp;A and Sunil Mittal or Narayanamurthy at the National Gallery in New Delhi. It would be salutary if Indian corporate houses joined the ranks of international corporate houses in actively participating in life beyond business. That is when we will become truly international. We must cross the obvious boundaries and reach out.

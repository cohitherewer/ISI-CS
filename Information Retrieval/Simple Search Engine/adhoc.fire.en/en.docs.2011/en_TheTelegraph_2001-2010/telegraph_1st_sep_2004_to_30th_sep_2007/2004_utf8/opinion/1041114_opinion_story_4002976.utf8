 Valley of fear

 Over 80 gun shops and 25,000 licensed 

 gunowners in Bhind

 Sten guns, cellphones and agents on 

 the job ? the image of the Chambal dacoit has changed over 

 the years. What hasn?t is the centuries-old cycle of violence 

 in the region. Avijit Ghosh reports in the aftermath 

 of the Bhanwarpura massacre

 ARMS AND THE MEN: 

 Dacoits of the Dayaram-Rambabu Gadariya gang 

 The terrain is treacherous. Carefully 

 negotiating uncomfortable rivulets, hazardous rocks and 

 harsh, thorny bushes, the Toyota Qualis snakes ahead. But 

 the speed, or rather the lack of it, makes Rajinder Singh 

 nervous. ?Why don?t you drive faster?? he tells the driver. 

 It is not a request, but a command.

 We are approaching the spot, four 

 kilometres away from Bhanwarpura in Gwalior district, where 

 the dreaded Gadariya gang of dacoits gunned down 13 villagers 

 late last month. Two of them were Singh?s cousins. ?People 

 talk about development and progress. But in these parts,? 

 he says with a sad finality, ?nothing has changed?.

 Statistics show how, even after 

 57 years of Independence, the outlaws or baghis continue 

 to rule the Chambal ravines and the forests nearby. Thirteen 

 districts across Madhya Pradesh (MP), Uttar Pradesh and 

 Rajasthan are affected by rural bandits. Six MP districts 

 ? Gwalior, Shivpuri, Morena, Bhind, Datiya and Sheopur ? 

 alone witnessed over 450 kidnappings in the past five years. 

 And though about 400 dacoits have been killed over the last 

 15 years, the crime rate shows little signs of dipping. 

 And, the question which continues 

 to haunt many is: why? 

 Part of the answer lies in the 

 fact that the dacoits have adapted suitably to a changing 

 world. Since villagers are better armed today, few raid 

 hamlets as they did in the 1950s and earlier. The modus 

 operandi of abduction has evolved as well. Outsourcing 

 is the new name of the kidnapping game. The dacoits have 

 developed a system under which agents do the pakad 

 (local lingo for kidnapping) for as little as Rs 5,000. 

 ?These casual members can be anybody: a neighbour or a relative,? 

 says local journalist Rakesh Pathak. While the agents make 

 policing more difficult, they lower the risk for a dacoit. 

 Extortion is another new hassle-free 

 source of income in the badlands. The brigands rule the 

 forests where illegal mining is rampant. ?To get their trucks 

 through, contractors pay them off,? says Sanjay Rana, inspector 

 general of police, Gwalior zone. Fish contractors of nearby 

 rivers also pay up coercion money. The new millennium Chambal 

 baghi has evolved into an urban criminal with a less 

 risky and a more lucrative career than that of his predecessors.

 The risk, says social activist 

 Madhumas Chandra, further minimises when policemen and politicians 

 lend a helping hand. Bandit Nirbhay Singh Gujjar, who operates 

 in the Etawah-Bhind area, is said to be patronised by a 

 top political party. ?Dacoity is an industry. All three 

 play a part in sustaining it,? he says. Several thanedaars, 

 admits a senior police officer, shelter a dacoit on the 

 condition that he will commit crimes outside his jurisdiction.

 Bandit KINGS

 Dayaram-Rambabu Gadariya: 

 Leaders of gang No. 1. Post-Bhanwarpura massacre, 

 reward raised to a whopping Rs 10 lakh. Closely-knit, 

 all-male band of brothers. Workstation: forest areas 

 in the Gwalior-Shivpuri-Sheopur districts. Profession: 

 kidnapping, dacoity and extortion. Surrendered in 

 2000. Escaped from police custody in 2001; chilli 

 powder their weapon. Ruthless with informers. Armed 

 with self-loading rifles.

 Nirbhay Gujjar: 

 Chambals most cunning and colourful outlaw. 

 Operates in the Bhind-Etawah belt. Kidnaps people 

 for a living. Often outsources the job. Has carried 

 out over 50 abductions. Loves booze, women and the 

 media. Keeps a bagful of simcards with his mobile 

 phone. Invites journalists he trusts to interview 

 him. Carries a reward of Rs 1.5 lakh. Gang arsenal 

 includes sten guns. Said to have procured bullet-proof 

 jackets and night-vision devices.

 Rajjan Gujjar: 

 Operates in the Bhind-Etawah belt. Infamous 

 for cruelty. Kidnapping and extortion his fort eacute;. 

 Carries a light machine gun and a sten gun. Loves 

 the good life. Keeps a VCD player even in the ravines. 

 Known to often visit city hotels. Said to be influenced 

 by formidable mistress Lovely Pandey.

 Pahalwan Gujjar: 

 Better known as Salim. Operates in MPs 

 Bhind district and Uttar Pradeshs Etawah and 

 Auraiya region. Extremely elusive. Few know what he 

 looks like. Carries a combined Rs 1.25 lakh reward 

 in two states. Keeps a number of mistresses. Known 

 to backpack his child while fleeing during police 

 encounters.

 Hajrat Rawat: 

 Operates in the Gwalior-Datiya-Shivpuri area. 

 Eight murders and 27 kidnappings to his name. Carries 

 Rs 50,000 reward. Master of disguises. Said to enjoy 

 dressing up as a woman to fool the police.

 The alleged connivance has several 

 forms. Back in March, 2001, the Gadariya gang escaped from 

 police custody under suspicious circumstances. Responding 

 to a public interest litigation earlier this week, the High 

 Court in Gwalior ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation 

 inquiry into the 2001 incident. 

 Senior police officers acknowledge 

 that the key to nabbing the dacoits lies in developing a 

 network of informers. But, the lawmen also confess that 

 they have failed to protect them. Pran Singh Baghel, who 

 helped police finish off a top Gadariya gang member and 

 was rewarded with a job in the force, was killed. ?Why would 

 an informer risk his life then?? asks a police officer.

 The outlaws know fear is a key 

 that opens up any door. In Dabra tehsil, the Gadariya 

 gang has issued letters asking candidates to withdraw from 

 the forthcoming municipal elections. Back in the 1960s, 

 it was different story, though. ?Unlike these new guys, 

 we were neither interested in politics or the politician,? 

 says Mohar Singh, a dreaded dacoit who surrendered in 1972.

 What remains unchanged since the 

 19th century when the bandits first emerged in these parts 

 is a firm belief in the maxim ? Jaako bairi jinda hai, 

 taako jeeno dhikkar (your life is meaningless if your 

 enemy is alive). The gun is routinely used to settle scores. 

 Driving from Gwalior to Bhind, the gun culture is evident. 

 Every third motorcycle rider has a pillion-rider sporting 

 a gun. Bhind has over 80 gun shops. The district has over 

 25,000 licensed gunowners. ?If you include the unlicensed 

 ones the number crosses 50,000,? says a police officer.

 The area around Bhind and Gwalior 

 has been traditionally hostile to authority. During the 

 Mughal period, outlaws looted the government treasury. The 

 later generations looted the rich, acquiring a Robin Hood 

 image. Slowly the six lakh acres of Chambal ravines and 

 the jungles of Shivpuri and Gwalior became a haven for anyone 

 walking the wild side. As former MP chief minister Digvijay 

 Singh says, ?the inhospitable terrain is the baghi?s 

 biggest ally?. 

 Rana recalls a 1994 incident when 

 he was the Bhind superintendent of police. Tipped off that 

 the notorious Hari Baba gang was expected in a village, 

 he surrounded it with a posse of policemen. But the gang 

 came to know and started firing. The policemen went in pursuit 

 but the dacoits managed to reach the ravines. ?Catching 

 them became impossible. You have no idea where you are going 

 in those labyrinthine hillocks. All of them escaped,? he 

 says.

 Such incidents only create a halo 

 of invincibility around the outlaw. Says Rana: ?With a profusion 

 of guns, a favourable topography and a mindset of settling 

 scores, the region is trapped in a paradigm that has endured.?

 What has altered radically is 

 the caste configuration among bandits. In the 1950s and 

 earlier, most gangs were led by thakurs and Brahmins. 

 Since then, the upper caste has moved mainstream. Now they 

 function as contractors and contest local elections. Today?s 

 gangs are led by men of Other Backward Classes (OBCs): the 

 Gadariyas, the Gujjars, the Kachis. As in politics, the 

 OBC identity has been asserted in the ravines and the forests. 

 Caste identity works to the bandit?s 

 advantage. A baghi is a hero for his castemen because 

 he brings the caste to prominence. And because he never 

 kidnaps his own fellow men. ?Every dacoit has a support 

 system based on caste. It keeps them ahead of the police,? 

 says Pathak, who edits the daily, Nav Bharat.

 The new dacoits are also technology-adept. 

 They carry sten guns and cellphones. And they confidently 

 hand over their mobile numbers to journalists. This reporter 

 easily procured the cellphone number of four gang leaders 

 (Nirbhay Gujjar, Rajjan Gujjar, Arvind Gujjar and Pahalwan 

 Gujjar).

 Post-Bhanwarpura, they have been 

 switched off, though.

 Unlike his predecessor, the new-millennium 

 outlaw has little respect for women and is ruthless with 

 his victims. The Rajjan Gujjar gang indulges in sadistic 

 activities with its captives, say former victims. K.K. Dubey, 

 who encountered a gang of dacoits in the 1960s, recalls 

 that the earlier bandits were more civilised.

Dubey, now a retired principal, 

 was picnicking near Shivpuri with students when they were 

 rounded up by the Madho Singh gang. ?He first told the girls, 

 we will do you no harm. He was gentle but firm,? recalls 

 Dubey. The dacoits took eight students away. ?Most of them 

 were wearing terylene shirts which was a rage among the 

 prosperous those days,? says Dubey, who was excluded. The 

 victims were freed only after coughing up Rs 5,000 each, 

 a staggering amount then. 

 Over the decades, despite several 

 hundred dacoits surrendering before the law, banditry in 

 its new avatar continues unabated. However, the Bhanwarpura 

 massacre, the largest killing since 1961 in MP, has stung 

 the police into action. Armed with light machine guns and 

 satellite trackers, a 200-member task force is combing the 

 jungles of Gwalior.

 Away in the village, the government 

 has distributed gun licences. Rajinder Singh, who lost his 

 relatives in the killing, is waiting for the Rs 1 lakh ex-gratia 

 payment. So are others in Bhanwarpura. All want to buy guns 

 to protect themselves. But some day, someone might turn 

 it against a fellow villager. That?s how the cycle of violence 

 continues around the ravines and the jungles of central 

 India.

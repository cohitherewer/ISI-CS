 GENTLE BUT FIRM

 There are very few more misleading things than a hawk in a dove?s plumage. Mr Manmohan Singh is not only the mildest of men, but he is also reputed to be a man of peace. He has never been known to be a gung-ho jingoist. His low-key approach to most things hides a man who invariably places national interests above everything else, including his putative pacifism. This side of him was on show at The Hague where he refused to be drawn into any discussion on the demilitarization of Jammu and Kashmir. The prime minister made it clear that the decision to deploy the Indian army in any part of India was not open to either negotiation or pressure. Such a decision was not amenable to intervention and discussion with external agencies. The point may be somewhat self-evident, given the fact that India is sovereign, but it acquires a certain edge in the context of Indo-Pak relations in general and the proposals recently put forward by Mr Pervez Musharraf in particular. It is often assumed by well-meaning proponents of ?peace with Pakistan at any cost? that India should always go the extra mile to establish peace with its neighbour. Mr Singh has made it clear that such a step will never be taken at the cost of compromising India?s sovereignty.

 Mr Singh?s firm and clear statement serves to highlight a paradox of conventional wisdom. The latter views the Bharatiya Janata Party as an ultra-nationalist party with a propensity to adopt hawkish positions in the realm of foreign policy. The performance of the National Democratic Alliance in foreign policy somewhat belies this wisdom. The BJP may not have compromised India?s sovereignty, but it cosied up unnecessarily to Uncle Sam and showed a goodwill towards Pakistan which, at the best of times, was not reciprocated. The Congress ? which has never had to wear its nationalism on its sleeve, for reasons going back into history ? has always taken a hard line in foreign policy. It has not bent over backwards to please the United States of America or any other superpower. This is one reason why under Congress governments Indo-US relations have never had a very smooth life. With Pakistan, Congress governments have not actively pursued conflict, but have also not worked under the illusion that peace was an immediate possibility. Mr Singh?s statement at The Hague is anchored in this tradition.

 DIARY

 Home, evidently, is not a sweet home for Shivraj Patil. The minister may be touring non-stop from Dimapur to Bhopal, chairing high-level meetings and giving sound-bytes (more full of sound than substance), but the fact that Patil is often found self-absorbed, deep in thought, suggests that he has some nagging worries. What could they be? Well, for one, Patil isn?t gaining in popularity with the left, whose incessant clamour against the home minister?s ?mishandling? of the North-east and Kashmir has been recently joined by the West Bengal chief minister?s angst about Patil?s meddling in Bhutan. Add to this the feeling of being unwelcome even in his home state, particularly during election time. There is no demand for this important Maratha leader to canvass support for the ruling alliance and state leaders insist that party candidates don?t want him. The logic is how could a leader who couldn?t win his own elections help others win it? The humiliation, quite naturally, is difficult for Patil to swallow. But he may take heart. Other bigwigs like Mani Shankar Aiyar and Arjun Singh are similarly unwelcome as they are perceived as being troublemakers. As for the trouble with the left, Patil can rest assured. For a man so devotedly loyal to 10 Janpath, several thoughts will be spared before the axe falls.

 Unlike Patil, Pramod Mahajan has no time to brood. It?s do or die for him in Maharashtra. If you watch him closely (or ?follow the leader?), you will notice that the past trappings are almost gone. There is no palm-top, CDs, the wild assortment of mobile phones or the sending of SMSs every other second. The hi-tech approach has been replaced by a back-to-the- charpoy one. Mahajan will be found in the nukkads, spreading the word through the time-tested method of posters, banners or a simple heart-to-heart talk. Really, the more they change, the more they remain the same.

 It is not Mahajan alone, who is striving hard in Maharashtra. The entire BJP is, although with contrasting results. Take for example, its recent gambit of using Varun Gandhi as one of its star campaigners in the state. Varun, much to the party?s woe, is going his own way, heaping praises on his grandmother and great grandfather. Impossible, isn?t it, getting a Nehru-Gandhi to stop talking about family?

 The sounding board of the UPA, the left that is, has been creating the most unpleasant noises, as most would agree. And probably because it has, all this time, got a patient hearing from 10 Janpath. Which is why the left lobby in Delhi thought of running to madam the instant Salman Khurshid bad-mouthed the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee regime. But better senses seem to have prevailed. Khurshid, the left has been cautioned, does not shoot his mouth unless he has got clearance from the top. Tut, tut! Now an internal probe is on, trying to find out what is it about the red that has upset madam this once.

 It is not the left alone which is having second thoughts about Salman Khurshid. Mayavati seems to be having them too. The BSP leader is supposedly mightily impressed with this suave, Oxonian Muslim UP-ite. She, allegedly, rang up the Congress leader recently to express solidarity with him and question the party?s policy of doling out a Rajya Sabha ticket to a BSP-deserter like Rashid Alvi when there was someone like Khurshid around? What is the Dalit queen up to now? Brushing up her skills of baiting rival leaders or trying to make friends with an enemy?s enemy?

 Our dear old Vajpayeeji no longer has to go to either Kumarakom or Manali to be away from the madding crowd. He is heard to be largely alone, that is if you discount the company of odd astrologers, gossip-mongers and hangers-on. One recent fixture is Shahnawaz Hussain, and there are many stories as to why he is where he is. Some believe he is Uma Bharti?s plant to instigate Vajpayee against M Venkaiah Naidu. The rival Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi camp thinks it is Hussain?s strategy of one-upmanship. Whatever, Hussain?s presence seems to be doing much good to Vajpayee?s humour. At a recent meeting, Babulal Gaur tried to do his bit by informing the former PM that the astrologer who had gone wrong with his prediction had been sued. An amused Vajpayee whispered back, ?Good work, Babulalji?.

 Diehard Sonia loyalists may want to wish it away. But in Bellary or in Amethi, it was not madam, but Priyanka?s waving of her hand that had worked the magic. Young or old, there is little doubt that Indians would, any day, choose a vivacious, charismatic Priyanka over her saintly, enigmatic mother. The choice, seemingly, comes just as easy to our brother across the border. Which is why, Iftikhar Ahmad, host of one of Pakistan?s most popular TV shows, Jawabdeh, has come looking for Priyanka. Ahmad is supposedly in India in connection with the South Asian Free Media Association exchange visit and has, allegedly, managed to get promises from Natwar Singh, Jayalalithaa, Farooq Abdullah and Javed Akhtar to be present in his show. Priyanka, however, continues to elude him, as she does Congressmen prior to polls. Last heard, Ahmad was trying to get in touch with Rajiv Shukla, who seemingly was responsible in taking the lady for the goodwill cricket series. All the best, Ahmad!

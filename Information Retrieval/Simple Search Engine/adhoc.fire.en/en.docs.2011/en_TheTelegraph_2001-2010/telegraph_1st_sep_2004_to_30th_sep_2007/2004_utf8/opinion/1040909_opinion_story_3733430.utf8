 OUT OF COURT

 Certain responsibilities are not negotiable. If lawyers go on strike, as they did yesterday in West Bengal, thousands of clients are left stranded. Apart from anything else, a day?s delay in an ongoing case is expensive in more ways than one. As it is, hearings continue for months, even years, in the country. Missing a day?s hearing means a postponement for weeks or longer. The Supreme Court mentioned this as one of the chief reasons for barring lawyers from going on strike. Although the Democratic Lawyers? Association had refused to join a strike called by the bar council in 2001, this time it decided go ahead with it. The issues in this case are not simple: members of the Lucknow bar association, protesting against the assault of a lawyer, had to face lathi-wielding policemen last week. The Democratic Lawyers? Association feels that such violence and high-handedness on the part of law-enforcers against members of their community should not be allowed to pass unchallenged.

 This is obviously a situation where rights are in conflict. The lawyers feel that the violence used by the police was unwarranted. At the same time, it is impossible to ignore the rights of the people who are dependent on them. The course of law is slow anyway, the fact that a speedy disposal of cases is often the only way to ensure justice does not make any difference to the pace of their unfolding. Courts have long vacations and numerous holidays. On top of that, in India people often have to travel far to reach the courts, which means repeatedly organizing their lives around an ongoing case. Cases have been overdue for years now. Every day that the courts come to an unexpected stop adds to the burden. Unwarranted violence by the police is certainly not something that should be brooked. At the same time, lawyers are the first persons who should know how best it can be tackled without resorting to a ceasework. This is exactly the kind of thing that they have been trained in. The spectacle of lawyers defying a Supreme Court bar is not a desirable one.

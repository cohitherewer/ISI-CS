 From the palace to the prison

TALK OF THE DEVIL (Vintage, ?4.55) by Riccardo Orizio tracks down seven dictators ? Idi Amin, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, Wojciech Jaruzelski, Enver Hoxha, Doc Duvalier, Colonel Mengistu and Slobodan Milosevic ? all of whom ?have become synonymous with misery, death and terror?. Hoxha?s wife, Nexhmije, speaks to Orizio in her cell, at seventy-three, the oldest woman prisoner in Europe, the unrepentant Widow, a Lady Macbeth figure. So different from Mirjana Milosevic, with her baby-talk with husband Slobodan, and her preference for ?Professor Mira Markovic? to ?Mrs Milosevic?. Bokassa looks back with sadness on ?that day I ceased to be the one who always had to give presents ? diamonds, ivory, women...The international leaders respected me because I was an emperor?. And here?s an order issued by Bossaka: ?Any person discovered in the act of theft shall be subject to the following punishments: 1. The first time such an offence is committed one ear shall be amputated. 2. The second time...the other ear shall be amputated. 3. The third time...one hand shall be amputated. Amputations will be performed by suitably qualified surgeons within 24 hours of sentence being passed.?

 ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK (HarperCollins, ?3.99) by Sidney Sheldon takes the reader from New York to Paris, from Denver to Berlin, in search of what links four deaths. Gripping, but predictable.

 INDIA UNTOUCHED (EastWest, Rs 295) by Abraham M. George sets out to unveil ?The forgotten face of rural poverty?. George, born and brought up in Trivandrum, served in the army before leaving for the US in the late Sixties. A quarter century later, he realized his true calling was back in India. He has worked with children and victims of lead poisoning in rural Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. According to him, once India mobilizes its human resources, it can become one of the frontrunning countries in the world.

PS, I LOVE YOU (HarperCollins, ?6.99) by Cecelia Ahern is for the dentist?s chamber, or for those yet to outgrow their braces. If this sounds too damning, here?s what the blurb says: ?Some people wait their whole lives to find their soul mates. But not Holly and Gerry.?

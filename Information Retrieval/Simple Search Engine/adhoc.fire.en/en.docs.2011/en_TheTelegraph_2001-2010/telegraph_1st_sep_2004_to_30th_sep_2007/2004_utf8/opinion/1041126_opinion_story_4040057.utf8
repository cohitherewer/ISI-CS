 Letters to Editor

 Sex and the TV

 Sir ? The fracas involving the chairman of the National Commission for women, Poornima Advani, and Ekta Kapoor is quite a farce (??Marital rape? rap on soap queen?, Nov 24). According to Kapoor, marital rape is a reality in the lives of Indian women and needs to be talked about. True, but since when did Kapoor become so virtuous ? After all, isn?t she the same woman who has popularized the image of the subservient bahu and showed the practice of sex determination tests over prime-time television? But there was also no need for Advani to see red over the issue. She should rest assured that the depiction of marital rape in a single episode of a TV serial will not encourage the majority of Indian men to commit similar atrocities on their wives. Doesn?t she know that producers often sex up television episodes to arrest falling TRP rates?

 Yours faithfully,

Neel Sengupta, Calcutta 

 Short-sighted

 Sir ? In ?Visions and verdict? (Nov 13), Ramachandra Guha gloses over the blunders made by Jawaharlal Nehru, for which the country continues to pay a price. The seeds of the Kashmir problem were sown during Nehru?s prime ministership. The army generals, K.M. Cariappa in particular, had informed Nehru in 1948 that it would take a few days to free the state of tribal invaders. But Nehru set aside Cariappa?s proposal and impressed upon the United Nations to declare a ceasefire. Hence, the Kashmir problem remained unresolved and is now a source of trouble between India and Pakistan. Prior to the Chinese invasion, both Nehru and his defence minister, V.K. Krishna Menon, turned a deaf ear to media reports of infiltration across the China border. Nehru?s complacence resulted in India?s crushing defeat to China. 

 One more thing. It was Nehru, along with B.R. Ambedkar, who inserted the clause providing for reservations for minorities in the Constitution to protect the Congress?s vote bank among these communities. He also failed to give due recognition to members of S.C. Bose?s Indian National Army after independence. Nehru?s literary and oratorical skills were unmatched. Neither can one cast aspersions on his personal integrity. But one must look at his strengths as well as weaknesses before judging his contribution to the nation.

 Yours faithfully,

S.N. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha?s personal admiration for Nehru has clouded his ?objective? analysis of the former prime minister?s legacy. One cannot agree with Guha when he says that ?Indians are not always best placed to understand ? still less appreciate ? Jawaharlal Nehru?. There is no real need for us to turn to foreign diplomats and historians for ?dispassionate? interpretations of the man. There are a number of excellent non-partisan works on Nehru by Indians ? The Indian Triumvirate by V.B. Kulkarni and Nehru: The Making of India by M.J. Akbar, to name two. While Nehru did inherit a nation beset with problems, it will only be fair to say that his reign went largely unopposed. Guha does not provide any evidence to support his conjecture that Nehru?s record was ?better? than that of his successors and contemporaries, or that he did a better job than what Patel or Bose would have done if they became India?s first prime minister. Nehru?s reign was marked by numerous failures. His model of governance, adapted from the British parliamentary system, conferred upon India the status of one of the world?s largest democracies. Yet, a large section of the electorate remained illiterate, and was divided on communal and caste lines. Even though foodgrain production increased significantly, the economic benefits were largely offset by the government?s failure to control the population. 

 Guha is of the opinion that Nehru?s woes began after 1957. This is not true. In 1956, India earned the dubious distinction of being the only ?non-aligned? nation to vote in favour of the Soviet aggression in Hungary. Nehru also made a virtual mockery of his ?principle of non-alignment? when he asked for British and American assistance after the Chinese invasion. These, and the ?conquest? of Goa, significantly lowered his credibility. On the social front, Nehru reformed the Hindu civil code so that Hindu widows could inherit property. However, he failed to extend these reforms to Muslim women. Nehru?s charisma may have helped conceal India?s serious internal problems but they continued nevertheless. Hence, one wonders whether the ?Nehru report card? really deserves ?an overall score of 60 per cent?.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is difficult not to agree with Ramachandra Guha when he says that Nehru was the true architect of modern India. His commitment to the values of democracy, secularism and peace ensured that India does not share the ignominious fate of our neighbour to the west.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir ? None of his obituaries in the media mentioned the exploits of Keith Miller during his visit to India with the Australian Services team in 1945-46. I and my friends were awe struck to see this cavalier cricketer clear the boundary ropes repeatedly and his fascinating duels with Vinoo Mankad at the Eden Gardens during the test match in Calcutta. I can visualize the thrilling scenes even today although it happened almost six decades ago. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Harshad Naik, Vadodara

 OLYMPICS IS GOOD BUSINESS

 Neha Sahay

 India issues a stamp for a television star, Hong Kong for its Olympians. Stamps were issued in honour of Hong Kong?s Li Ching and Ko Lai-chak, men?s table-tennis doubles silver medallists, part of China?s Olympic contingent.

 On the mainland, felicitations continue. The winners of 32 gold, 17 silver and 14 bronze medals are being feted the way astronaut Yang Liwei was last year. First, an official reception in the Great Hall of the People, the Chinese parliament, where the team was awarded ?labour medals? and ?red banners?. Then a tour by the gold medallists of the ?specially administered regions? of Macau and Hong Kong, and then Shenzen, the mainland showpiece. Back to Beijing for the Olympic ?report? conference where the winners spoke about their experiences.

 In Hong Kong and Macau, large stadiums were venues for swimming, diving, badminton, table-tennis and volleyball demonstrations by the medallists, with locals invited to compete. In Hong Kong, weightlifting champion, Tang Gonghong, picked up a collegian as if she were a feather. In Shenzen, fans aged 6-75 waited hours for a handshake or an autograph.

 Rewards galore

 The Olympic fever in China started way before the Athens Games, and will probably continue till the Beijing Olympics. On Wednesday, a massive Countdown Clock was inaugurated by the Olympics committee vice-president in Tiananmen Square, declaring the Olympics to be 1,417 days away.

 Before the Athens Games, the Beijing Olympics committee had distributed thousands of ?secondary school Olympic readers? and brought out a CD on the Chinese team. Kodak had designed giant billboards of smiling Chinese faces to welcome back the winners. 

 For the athletes, the bonanza has just started. They have received the cash rewards announced before the games: 200,000 yuan for every gold medallist, 120,000 for silver, and 80,000 for bronze, plus awards from provincial governments. Two of them have been promoted in their university.

 But there have been other windfalls. ?Diving prince? Tian Liang has signed a $10 million three-year contract with a Hong Kong-based entertainment company, in which he not only gets to appear in promotionals, but also to act in feature films. He rejected many contracts before settling for this one, primarily because it allows him enough time to train for the Beijing Olympics.

 Looking ahead

 Like everything else in China today, the games are seen as good for business. For more than a year now, local manufacturers have been printing ?Beijing 2008? on products. During the Athens Games, TV manufacturers repaired sets for free and even lent out new ones. Nike offered a 40 per cent discount and ended up with a 30 per cent increase in sales. Supermarkets organized sports events and an Olympic shopping mall is slated to come up in Shenzen.

 But something of Mao?s China still survives. An article provoked by the sight of three gold medallists? faces adorning a giant Coke ad called this a ?betrayal of the Olympic spirit?. The writer pointed out that the 2008 Beijing Olympics wasn?t only about ?extravagant new stadiums?, it was an opportunity to inspire Chinese youth to ?represent the motherland with pride. The Chinese gold cannot be corrupted or sold to the highest bidder as a commodity in a free market economy.? The newspaper felt constrained to add: ?The above content represents the view of the author only.?

 At least two popular gold medallists would win the writer?s approval: Guo Jingjing, voted the ?best-looking Chinese woman athlete?, and Liu Xiang, gold medallist in the men?s 110-m hurdles, have ruled out joining the entertainment industry to concentrate on the 2008 Olympics.

 COUNT

 HIM

 OUT

 For census commissioner 

Jayant Kumar Banthia, demography was all about numbers. 

And then he found numbers can lie 

FACTS 

 amp; FIGURES

1931: 

Census commissioner J. Huttons diverse information on religion and caste 

triggered off the Pakistan demand 

 1961: Census commissioner Ashok Mitra curtailed 

information on religion under Prime Minister Nehrus orders

 2001: Banthia vastly widens information on religion 

and SC/ST.

 Human error can be a costly affair, costing reputation, money, even life, not to speak of the peace of others. But the worst of its kind creates doubt about the motive of the person who committed it, making him appear as the dumbest creature at one moment and quite malevolent at the very next.

 That?s precisely where Jayant Kumar Banthia, registrar general of India and census commissioner, has got himself trapped. The 1977-batch IAS officer is now the target of not only the government?s ire but its suspicion. Banthia?s days are numbered at the historic census commission?s office that has enumerated Indians over 140 years. 

 Papers are ready for his being promptly reverted to his cadre state of Maharashtra, on the unctuous plea that it?s indeed time for him to ?cool off? where he belongs (the smartest ones go to Delhi with a one-way ticket, though). Salvos are being fired at him in public by such weighty personages as Congress president Sonia Gandhi and home minister Shivraj Patil. And all that after the man of short stature and passionate zeal ? he?s privately called ?Napoleon? by Delhi?s professional demographers ? put together, with commendable clarity and finesse, the ?final report? of India?s billion-plus Census 2001. 

 If anyone has to take the blame for Banthia?s reversal of fortune, it is none other than Banthia himself. Last week, as he rose to the podium at Vigyan Bhavan with his PowerPoint presentation of the ?First Report on Religion?, things were alright till he mentioned a decadal growth figure of 36 per cent for Muslims. The attending specialists, including leading demographer Ashis Bose, who presided over the presentation ceremony, were aghast as they instantly realised that the so-called 36 per cent surge hid the fact that the earlier 1991 census hadn?t included India?s only Muslim-majority state of Jammu amp; Kashmir, thanks to insurgency. 

 But the 2001 figures counted the state?s population of over 10 million, with 67 per cent Muslims. The religion counts of 1991 and 2001 were therefore not comparable, a fundamental statistical lapse that Banthia had overlooked. The presentation over, when Bose and minorities commission chairman Tarlochan Singh pointed it out to him, he was taken aback but was yet unfazed. ?We?ll do some explaining later,? he whispered, as television cameras were zeroing in on him for some more salacious bytes on the ?great Muslim demographic march?. The rest is history.

 Before Banthia announced the ?adjusted? figures putting the Muslim decadal growth rate at 29.3 per cent, a sheer drop from the earlier 36 per cent, the bureaucratic ?error? had become grist to the politician?s mill. The BJP, dispirited and rudderless after the May electoral defeat, promptly called a news conference where party chief Venkaiah Naidu lamented the creeping ?imbalance? in the relative numbers of Hindus and Muslims, that being the original cause of the 1947 Partition. 

 The Congress visualised the electoral potential, in the coming Maharashtra poll, of propaganda based on census figures, and broke out in cold sweat. Its panic turned into anger as officials in the home ministry did their own calculations based on census data and found that the growth rate would be much less if J amp;K were kept out of the comparison. 

 Then the telephones began jangling at Banthia?s office. In the damage-control exercise that followed, it?s not the J amp;K figures alone that were lopped off. Assam too was kept out of calculation because there was no census in the state in 1981 due to the ?anti-foreigner? agitation. 

 After their exclusion, the Muslim growth rate, at 29.3 per cent, looked an improvement on the 1981-91 growth of 32.9 per cent. So Muslims weren?t growing ever faster, after all. 

 But does the new exercise hold any intrinsic statistical value? Or is it simply the reverse of Naidu?s rhetoric, which Banthia dished up under pressure from above? The methodology behind the exercise sounds absurd, though. It keeps out of calculation a chunk of 36.75 million people, or the combined population of Assam and J amp;K by the 2001 census. That makes a trifling 3.57 per cent of India?s population, but no statistician can ignore its uniqueness. The two states, between them, house 40.9 per cent Muslims. 

 The Muslims in these two states represent 10.89 per cent of the total Muslim population. Besides, no other Indian state has a higher share of Muslims than this combined entity. 

 A statistician at the census commission remarks on condition of anonymity that to measure the Muslim growth trend with the exclusion of Assam and J amp;K is ?no less adventurous than commenting on the Islamic people in Europe by leaving out Turkey?. 

 For Banthia, who came to the census commission in 1999, demography is more a passion than a job. He has done his PhD in historical demography from the London School of Economics, and has worked under noted scholar Kim Dyson. 

 Banthia wears two hats, the second being that of a social scientist. In the recent fiasco, he could somehow manage to balance both the hats when he remarked, after releasing the ?adjusted? figure of Muslim growth rate that made the secularist breathe freely, that there were many ways to interpret data but ?the simplest is not to make any interpolation?. 

 Banthia was obviously trying to defend his honour. He was justifying both the ?unadjusted? figures he gave first, and the ?adjusted? figures he declared under pressure. Both are ?simple? alternatives that interpret data without any interpolation. 

 But what?s wrong with interpolation? Why can?t the 1981 gap in Assam, or the one in J amp;K in 1991, be filled in with figures derived from known values in the past census decades? Banthia, the demographer, sees the peril of framing public policy on tailor-made, ?simple?, interpretations of census data. But Banthia, the bureaucrat, knows how unsafe it is, in a communally surcharged country, to fill in the blank space with a plausible value. He?ll no doubt return to Maharashtra a chastened officer, and more careful about the politics of numbers.

 The juggling game

 Sir ? The appointment ? or should we say reinstatement? ? of L.K. Advani as the Bharatiya Janata Party president more than exposes the Achilles? heel of the party (?Firefight with GenFirst?, Oct 19). M. Venkaiah Naidu merely adds to the list of second-generation leaders who have failed to inspire confidence among party-members. The leadership needs to realize that it is not the leaders, but the ideology which makes all the difference. Atal Bihari Vajpayee seemed acceptable to many because his stand was not overtly communal, as those of Advani, Naidu and others. The rath yatra, followed by the tiranga yatra, Uma Bharti?s sanyas and so on have all contributed to the BJP?s recent defeat at the Centre and in the states. Worse, the party has emerged as a body fractured from within. A narrow outlook and misplaced ideology cannot be cured by juggling with leaders. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur

 View from the side

 Sir ? Sunanda K. Datta-Ray?s article, ?Knave or fool?? (Oct 23), shows that there is a desperate need for a different paradigm through which to see the war on terror and the so-called American imperialism. Haven?t we all got tired of the repeated accusations of the falsification and fabrication of evidence that led to the war? Have we not heard enough about the need for the British and American electorates to punish the imperialists, or about the apparent loss of national sovereignty? It has become fashionable among the urban middle classes, old or young, to hate Bush. The demonstrations in London were about people trying to jump on to the bandwagon of popular culture, not about some deep feelings of remorse. In fact, the West hardly cares about ?the rest?. 

 But how does this war affect us Indians? For all I can see, it pinpoints Britain and the United States of America as the two principal targets for Islamic extremists all over the world. Which would mean that all other countries, including India, can rest in peace and prepare themselves for fending future attacks. We can also take this opportunity to play off countries that have better relations with us ? such as Iran ? against the US-UK combine to divert attention from us. Dwindling Western stock markets post-9/11 have actually helped the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 This may sound unbelievably selfish to many, but when are we going to learn to focus our attention on areas which actually matter to India? We seem to care too much for the rest of the world and not nearly enough for ourselves ? an attitude that will not help India become a global player. 

 To talk of India?s immediate concerns, with George W. Bush we can be assured of a tough handling of Pakistan and China. This is necessary for India to maintain the balance of power in Asia. Bush will not stop outsourcing with the protectionist fervour of Kerry. The war on terror was, is and will be, good for India. Americans voting for Bush will indirectly do us Indians a favour. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, UK

 Sir ? Tonight I saw our next president and it was John Kerry. Kerry stood out at the debates as a fair, honest and resolute leader who has the knowledge and character that it takes to be a good president. George W. Bush, on the other hand, resembled a broken record, never stepping out of the scripted answers and often giving the impression that he did not fully understand the import of what he was saying. He came across as someone who has erred in his judgments and calculations ? a failed president, in short. I feel confident that Kerry will be an effective administrator and president and will lead our nation in the right direction.

 Yours faithfully,

Bryan Thompson, Illinois, US

 Toilet tracks

 Sir ? People standing by the railway tracks with water pots in hand indeed makes a disgusting sight. Particularly for the passengers, who are suddenly confronted with this while enjoying the beautiful countryside out of their windows. 

 Of course, this is a bigger problem in the urban areas than in the villages. Recently the Union railways minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, has brought it up while talking of his ?list of things to do?. But stopping people from defecating on the tracks is going to be easier said than done. The people from the nearby slums have got used to using the tracks ? and sometimes the toilets of stationary trains ? for relieving themselves. The solution is to relocate these people to houses with proper toilet amenities away from the rail-line. 

 Yours faithfully,

Saroj Kumar Mishra, Puri

 Sir ? All trains in India have their toilets fitted with a direct exit to the track below. If, following the railways minister?s orders, persons relieving themselves on the tracks are to be penalized, then all rail travellers would have to be fined. By using the train toilets, they are doing just that. Are we going to have a ?toilet surcharge? added to our ticket price from now? 

 Yours faithfully,

Pradeep A. Menon, United Arab Emirates

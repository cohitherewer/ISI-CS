 ANOTHER RARE CHARACTER

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 A fly-eating hotel manager and Alexander the Great

 The Border-Gavaskar trophy has gone out of the country and Indians must be glad to put the misery of the losses out of their minds. But a startling detail unearthed by an enterprising scribe may make us want to look back at the loss at Nagpur. 

 On October 28, The Daily Telegraph wrote, ?Eating lunch at the team hotel this week, Adam Gilchrist was alarmed to find a cockroach in his soy sauce, and positively shocked when the restaurant manager snatched the insect up and swallowed it.? It isn?t difficult to imagine what effect this reportage might have had on the British reader, sipping his morning cuppa. 

 The closest parallel to this incident could be found in a story about Vidyasagar. The great reformer is supposed to have found an insect in his meal at a wedding feast. Aware that a din would make his fellow-diners abandon the meal and embarrass the host, he silently gulped down the pest. 

 The Australian wicket-keeper, it seems, did not follow in Vidyasagar?s footsteps. But he did help a rare character to spring to life ? a fly-eating hotel manager. 

 Fly-eaters have served literature with distinction. Abol Tabol readers would remember the tot in the poem ?Danpitey? who delights in eating flies: ?Kop kop machhi dhorey mukhey dyay tuley!? Then there is Renfield in Dracula. Dr Seward?s diary describes him thus: ?He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nailmarks on the edge of the door.? Renfield, in Bram Stoker?s book, is also in league with the blood-sucking Devil. 

 So where does our fly-eating hotel manager stand? Gilchrist does not attribute a single quote to him. The reporter also seems to have lost interest in his discovery no sooner than he was able to establish the unsuitability of this ?anonymous backwater? as a test venue. 

 Yet one cannot but thank him for contributing his bit to prose in general. His next morning?s report must have made Gilchrist feel a lot better than he did at the lunch table. ?When it [the series] is over, perhaps Australia will feel a little like Alexander the Great...who is supposed to have wept because there were no more worlds to conquer.? 

 And when India crumbled like eleven pins in the same test, Briggs delved into literature again, ?Like Strether in Henry James?s The Ambassadors, this [Indian] top-order has become ?a perfectly equipped failure?.? Thank you, Simon Briggs.

 THE DIVIDED STATES

 Gwynne Dyer

 Looking at the electoral map of the United States of America with all the liberal, quiche-eating, Kerry-supporting states of the north-east and the west coast coloured Democratic blue while the ?heartland? and the south were solid Republican red, the solution to the problem suddenly occurred to me. ?Blueland? should join Canada.

 It is getting harder and harder for the two tribes of Americans to understand or even tolerate each other. Once again, as in 2000, the country is divided with almost mathematical precision into two halves, one of which adores president George W. Bush while the other literally loathes him. And it goes far deeper than mere personalities or even the old left-right split; the clash now is about social norms and fundamental values, on which few are willing to compromise.

 Opinions on foreign issues that seemed to dominate the election ? the war in Iraq and the ?war on terror? ? just mapped onto that existing cultural division. People who go to church regularly and oppose abortion and gay marriage were also far more likely to believe that US troops had found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that Saddam Hussein had somehow sponsored the terrorists of 9/11, so they voted for Bush. People who don?t, didn?t.

Cultural rift

 Two separate populations have evolved in the US, and they are increasingly unhappy even about living together. One sub-species, homo canadiensis, thinks medicare is a good idea, would rather send peace-keepers than bombers, and longs for the wimpy, wispy liberalism enjoyed by their Canadian neighbours to the north. The other breed, homo iraniensis, prefers full-blooded religious certainties and militant political slogans ? ?Death to...(fill in the blank)? ? that play such a large and fulfilling part in Iranian public life.

 It is sheer cruelty to force these two populations to go on living together, especially since US political life has lost its centre and now pits these two irreconcilable opposites directly against each other in a winner-takes-all election every four years. Since the pseudo-Iran-ians slightly outnumber the proto-Canadians, the obvious solution is for the latter group to actually go to Canada.

 There are problems with this solution, however. A mass migration northwards would leave large chunks of the US virtually empty, and the parts of Canada where people can live in any comfort are pretty full already. Besides, the winters up there really are fairly severe, and I?m not sure that Californians would be up to it. And then, looking at the two-colour map of the electoral outcome, the solution hit me. You don?t have to move the people; just move the border.

Happy lot

 At the global level, everybody else would be quite happy with a bigger Canada and a smaller US. A smaller US would have to pull in its horns a bit as it would no longer have the resources to maintain military bases in every single country on the planet. But it would retain enough resources to invade a country every year or so, so it wouldn?t suffer too badly from withdrawal symptoms. And the new Canadians would be free to have abortions, enter into gay marriages, do stem-cell research and engage in all other wickednesses that flourish in that bastion of corrupt and godless liberalism. 

 No solution is perfect: there would be limp-wristed liberals trapped in the US and god-fearing rednecks in Canada, so some degree of population exchange would be necessary. It?s even possible that a few right-wing bits of Canada ? parts of Alberta, for example ? might prefer to join the US. But you can?t make an omelette without breaking some eggs. And think how happy everybody would be when they are living exclusively among like-minded people.

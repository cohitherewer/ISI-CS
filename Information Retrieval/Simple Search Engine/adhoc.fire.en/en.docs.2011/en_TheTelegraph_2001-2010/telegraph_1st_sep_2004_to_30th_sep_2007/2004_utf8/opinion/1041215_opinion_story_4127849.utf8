 NO BUSINESS

 Things have indeed come to a fine pass when the government has to be reminded that the job of the legislature is to legislate after debating on the proposed laws. All other functions of parliament are secondary. Both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, in the last few days, have faced the embarrassing moment when they did not have an agenda to discuss. In the Lok Sabha, a few days ago, the agenda for the afternoon session had only the introduction of two bills. This, at the best of times, would take only a few minutes. Members of the Lok Sabha, in other words, would not have to invent any excuses to enjoy a post-prandial siesta. It needs to be noted that there are hundreds of bills lying in files and waiting to be presented to parliament. It is difficult to accept that the supreme legislative body of the country on which crores of rupees are being spent has no business to conduct. Add to this the bizarre phenomenon of absenteeism among the MPs and there arises the situation in which law-making is treated with insouciance by parliamentarians. Yet, the making and the passing of laws are crucial elements in the process of governance. No government that is serious about good governance can afford to ignore the business of the legislature in a democracy.

 The fallout of this appalling state of things is the beginning of a blame game in which Indian political parties excel. The National Democratic Alliance has accused the government of not providing enough business for the winter session of parliament. The retort of Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, the minister of parliamentary affairs, has been predictable. The minister said that the NDA?s disruption of the first three sittings of parliament was really responsible for this state of affairs. He, in turn, accused the opposition of wasting crores of rupees. The charge and counter-charge only underline the point of irresponsibility suggested at the end of the previous paragraph. The smooth and proper running of parliament cannot be the responsibility of the government alone. It is the combined responsibility of all political parties. It is unfortunate that most, if not all, political parties fail this test. They fail because they disrupt proceedings, by absenting themselves from parliament, by raising irrelevant issues and also by not placing important pieces of legislation on the parliamentary agenda. This is a familiar story for those who know the nature of Indian politics and Indian politicians.

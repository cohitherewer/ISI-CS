 Letters to Editor

 At your service

 Sir ? Khushwant Singh was so overwhelmed at the sight of Lord Snowdon at his doorstep that he took off his woollen cap, let down his hair, removed his chair cushion, took off his glasses, removed his jacket, took out the watch-chain and pen from his pocket, to oblige his guest (?Filth in god?s abode?, Dec 4). Lord Snowdon once said about his style of photography: ?You have to strip people of their poses and disguises?. Perhaps he was merely following his style. But did Singh have to invent the Lord?s ?royal right to command? to hide his own servility? Tony Armstrong-Jones isn?t even a royal. He is a commoner who gained entry into the royal family only by his marriage to Princess Margaret, which again lasted only about 18 years. The grand old Sardar?s irreverent comments on religion are so much better than his account of being photographed at various stages of undress. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Never having to say sorry

 Sir ? It has been twenty years, but India has proved largely incompetent in discussing and dealing with the various aspects of the Bhopal gas tragedy. Talking about Bhopal would make people aware of industrial accidents, particularly in nuclear power establishments (even in cases of non-military use of nuclear power). Also, in this age of globalization, multinational companies would like to have their civil and criminal liabilities clearly defined on internationally accepted legal terms. This could be done by using the example of Union Carbide and Bhopal. 

 Anybody who is conversant with the working of a industry with chemical or explosive hazards knows that the company is required to provide a detailed proof of conditions for the safety of employees in the plant. Without such proof, the government does not allow a new hazardous industrial project to begin operations. Details of periodic checking also have to be submitted. It is quite evident from this that the company, through its managing director or manager, consultants, government authorities concerned or inspectors and the technical, engineering and other staff of the factory are all individually or/and collectively accountable to criminal liabilities in case of any accident in these factories. Obviously, the criminal liabilities in the case of Bhopal have not been fixed properly yet. Maybe the media can provide a platform for the issue to be debated. 

 Yours faithfully,

Hem Raj Jain, New Delhi

 Sir ? Even after broadcasting a hoax interview announcing compensation for the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy, the BBC did not apologize to the victims and their families (?Bhopal hoax leaves BBC squirming?, Dec 5). The BBC?s action is typically the attitude of the Western media towards anything which is third world. According to the report, the corporation has apologized to Dow Chemicals, which now owns Union Carbide, and to its viewers who might have been misled, but not to those who, along with their families, suffered the most, and continue to do so, on account of the tragedy. The BBC might have broadcast several programmes to mark the 20th anniversary of the world?s worst industrial disaster, but they cannot make up for the irresponsibility on the part of the corporation. 

 Even after the goof-up, the BBC broadcasts were full with developments in Ukraine, with only a cursory clip on the victims of Bhopal. The British government should seek an explanation from the BBC and, in turn, also apologize to the victims of the gas tragedy. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Timir Baran Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? I do not think that the government of India has been an aggressive campaigner for the Bhopal gas tragedy victims. If money were compensation enough, then rich countries would get away by paying large damages to the victims of such accidents. But much more needs to be done. What could be more shocking than the fact that it took our government 20 years after the accident to wake up to the polluted soil and water in and around the factory site. The survivors continue to relive the tragedy by consuming harmful chemical residue and drinking the polluted water. As in the past years, we remembered Bhopal on December 3, debated about its cause, criticized the system and prepared ourselves to repeat the same cycle next year.

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak Kumar Vidhyarthi, Muzaffarnagar

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that the gas victims are yet to receive sufficient compensation. The offenders are still at large, primarily due to the non-existence of extradition treaties between India and America. India should set up an independent commission to look into the legal tangle and expedite the process of getting sufficient damages from Union Carbide, and distribute it among the victims. It will not be out of place to mention here that had such an incident taken place in America, the legal process would not have lasted so long and the punishment would have been stringent as well.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

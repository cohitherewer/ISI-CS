 Letters to Editor

 Pall on the mall

 Sir ? The report states ?Delhi won?t shop in dark? (Sept 20). As if Delhiites have conspired to rob policy-makers (and shopkeepers, though they are of secondary importance here) of their moment in the sun. If most of the shopping malls are empty by 9 pm, it is because the policy-makers seem to have missed out on a crucial fact. The people who make up the city?s night life ? the yuppies ? are not necessarily die hard shoppers. The middle class bahus, who are the committed shoppers, would much rather wait for daylight and see their men and children off to their destined places, than venture into the night to loosen the strings of their purse. Having the malls open till late without the concomitant arrangements of transport and security is a mindless policy. Delhiites should collectively disprove its efficacy.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhubani Chawla, New Delhi

 Struggle for survival

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha has effectively brought out the hypocrisy in the politics of the sangh parivar (?The new patriots?, Sept 18). When the country needed their sacrifice, sangh activists closeted themselves in their shakhas, and now that the country could do without their useless presence, they seem hell-bent on proving their patriotism. Had the National Democratic Alliance regime survived, we would probably have been forced to wage the ?third freedom struggle? against its fundamentalist and non-secular government. 

 The incapacity of the saffronites to provide constructive governance has been exposed by the failure of their regime. History also tells us that fundamentalist forces have always met with tragic ends, be it the Nazis or the taliban. The sangh is not going to be an exception to that rule. The outcome of the 2004 elections has already shown that the people of this country are beginning to see through their deception. The Bharatiya Janata Party should realize that India no longer wants its politics of divide and rule, no matter how many satyagrahas or tiranga yatras they initiate.

 Yours faithfully,

Mandira Sengupta, Durgapur

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that political parties have to resort to cheap gimmicks like a yatra to remain relevant. This situation would not have arisen had they listened to the voice of the electorate. Instead of working at the grassroots level, the saffron parties have come to display utter disregard for people?s welfare. During the saffron interlude, it was mindless dogma that dominated politics. The tamasha not only destroyed India?s image abroad, but raised serious questions about its ethical standards. For the sake of a common future, it is imperative that people become alert to threats of a saffron coup.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? The vituperation of Ramachandra Guha in ?The new patriot? is unjustified. He cleverly sidetracks the role of the communists during the Quit India movement. Were they very patriotic during that crucial hour? The communists thought that the movement was detrimental to the raj, whose interests they were intent on preserving because it was an ally of Russia. They called Subhas Chandra Bose a ?lap dog of Tojo? and tacitly consented to Partition. After independence, their cries of ?yeh azaadi jhuta hai? rent the air, and they refused to take part in independence celebrations. That is till Russia thought otherwise. The sanghis may not have done anything to help the cause of ?freedom?, as Guha would have us believe, but at least they were not traitors. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha?s splendid expos? of the distortions of history that political parties routinely resort to these days seems to have been marred by an unfortunate lapse into caste and class prejudices. How else would one explain his implication that India?s freedom struggle was the exclusive preserve of the non-Brahmins in Tamil Nadu and the chhotoloks in Bengal?

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak Mukerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? While so many in India are striving hard to make both ends meet, political extravaganzas like the tiranga yatra are really shameful. The BJP wants to resurrect its sullied image, but is there no better way to do that? Is it commendable in a country where farmers are committing suicide for being unable to pay their debt? Why can?t the saffron parivar consider utilizing its funds for the uplift of their voters. Is it not degrading to have it wasted like this?

 Yours faithfully,

Manisha Mishra, Cuttack

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha?s ire against the saffron parivar is no different from Mani Shankar Aiyar?s. If Aiyar claimed the tiranga for the Congress, Guha now claims satyagraha as the legacy of Sonia Gandhi?s party. But if the left can be allowed to carry on with their disruptive bandhs to drive home their political points, why can?t the saffron continue with their yatras, or, satyagrahas? Another point. If the Congress now stages a satyagraha, does Guha think it will be anything like Gandhi?s?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Baby?s day out

 Sir ? The food and nutrition board, the department of women and child development and the department of family welfare published advertisements in different dailies in August on the occasion of World Breast-feeding Week. The ten points to ensure exclusive breastfeeding under baby-friendly hospital initiative have been accepted in India and is apparently being practised in different hospitals.

 One of those points is not to use pacifiers. So it is astonishing to find the cover of Trains at a Glance, September 2004-June 2005, published by the Indian Railways, showing a lady boarding a long distance train with a baby in arms who has a pacifier in its mouth. One wonders how Indian Railways, under the able leadership of a man who has so many children, can be so baby-unfriendly.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Calcutta

 Sir ? Now even squatters can be seen using feeding bottles, evidently unsterilized, for their babies. Shouldn?t they be made more aware of the risks and persuaded to opt for breast-feeding?

 Yours faithfully,

M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

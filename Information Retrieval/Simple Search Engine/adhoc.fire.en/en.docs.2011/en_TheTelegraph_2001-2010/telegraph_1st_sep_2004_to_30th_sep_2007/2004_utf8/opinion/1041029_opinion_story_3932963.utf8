 Paperback Pickings

 Losing a little hope everyday

No place to go (Penguin, Rs 250) by Subhadra Menon tells ?stories of hope and despair from India?s ailing health sector?. It is an important study, whose biggest advantage is that it stops well short of becoming a tome, which would have deterred lay readers from approaching it. Menon, a journalist and scholar, bases her analyses on published data from the UNDP, NFHS, CEHAT and other such organizations. There are startling facts ? ?In the obsession with meeting family planning targets, training and skill development in clinical diagnosis and rational management of women?s health problems have suffered? ? and hard-hitting questions ? ?Your friendly local chemist is friendly, yes, but is he qualified too?? With almost every Indian having his share of horror stories to tell of the health sector, wonder how many can share the author?s hope of ?a healthier India??

 The Golden Life (Rupa, Rs 195) by Dibyendu Palit is the story of the Pybus family of Calcutta?s Ripon Street, synonymous with the Anglo-Indian community. Sahana Ghosh?s translation is laboured at best (?Arthur?s sense of good and evil was simplistic ? he viewed his family with his own religious notion?). Those interested in the Anglo-Indians of Calcutta will still have to go back to 36, Chowringhee Lane, it seems.

I didn?t get where I am Today (Arrow, ? 4.55) by David Nobbs comes from the creator of Reginald Perrin, immortalized by the BBC?s series. Nobbs always has had an eye for the absurd and the comic juxtaposition. He takes readers in his usual entertaining way through the Sixties ?satire boom? in Britain, a phenomenon that he himself owes his success to. Always ?the reluctant soldier?, the most poignant account is of his days with National Service: ?A few of us went to Richmond and saw Charlie Chaplin?s Limelight...I have heard it criticized. You wouldn?t have criticized it if you?d seen it on your first evening out in National Service.?

Storming heaven (Coronet, Rs 200) by 

Kyle Mills starts with the murder of Jennifer?s parents, after which the teen-age 

girl goes missing. Exiled FBI agent, Mark Beamon, discovers there is a far bigger 

conspiracy in the local murder ? one ?that could bring America to its knees...?

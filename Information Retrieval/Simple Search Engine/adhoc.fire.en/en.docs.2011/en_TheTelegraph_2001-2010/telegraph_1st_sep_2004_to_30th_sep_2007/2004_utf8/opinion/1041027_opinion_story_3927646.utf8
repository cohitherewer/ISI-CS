 TAKE ON A DEEPER SHADE OF GREEN

 OPEN LETTER

 Shama Parveen and citizens? groups write to the ministry of environment and forests

 A Jarawa tribesman

 A large number of development projects cleared by the MoEF do not fulfil the conditions under which they were cleared...A huge loan was received by the MoEF some years ago, for ?Environmental Management Capacity Building Programme?...This process has been developed with meagre consultation... Having heard that the MoEF is drafting a National Environment Policy, some of us have repeatedly asked for details on how... citizens can make inputs. A draft was put up on the MoEF website on 21st August, for comments. There has been no other process of reaching out to the citizens of India for inputs...

 Despite itself facilitating a uniquely consultative process over four years, to prepare the NBSAP, the MoEF is now delaying its final approval, publication, and release...We understand the need...to get political (cabinet) approval, but there is no justification for delaying the printing and public release of the final technical report...

 Rather than help conserve natural ecosystems against unchecked urban growth, MoEF has often tried to make the way easier for the building lobby. For example, instead of supporting people?s groups to protect some of the last remaining forest areas in the highly polluted city of Delhi...MoEF has favoured the lobby that wants to promote the construction of five star hotels and shopping malls in this area... 

 In violation of Supreme Court orders, the MoEF has refused to close down the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Forest and Plantation Development Corporation that has been destroying the forests and the habitat of the tribals in the islands. Orders to control mining of sand from the beaches of the islands and deal with inappropriate tourism too have not been satisfactorily complied with...Another example of the increasing opaqueness...is the lack of public participation in decisions regarding genetic engineering. This risky technology is being pushed through with no long-term safety tests, and almost no independent scientific or public inputs. 

 These are only a few of the many examples where the MoEF in particular and the GOI in general, have undermined environmental issues and ignored public inputs...These trends have occurred within the context of both the previous government and the current one...The current government in its Common Minimum Programme has almost nothing on the environment...

 We do believe, however, that the new government has the opportunity to reverse this trend. It needs to take at least the following steps: providing a legally mandated and explicit role for citizens (especially local communities) in the decision-making process within MoEF (and GOI in general)...; considerably strengthen the mandate and functioning of the MoEF by increasing the number of technical experts and officials who are known for their commitment to the environment; centrally integrate environmental considerations across the entire decision-making process...; reviewing the CMP and its implementation from the environmental perspective, including a serious consideration of environmental issues in forums such as the National Advisory Council... 

 While drawing up such an action plan, there should be active and meaningful participation of community organizations, people?s movements, NGOs, and other civil society organizations.

 CONCLUDED

 Letters to Editor

 All in a day?s work

Sir ? Kalyan Singh?s suggestion that the demolition 

of the Babri mosque was an ?act of god? reflects that darker side of this man 

as never before (?Kalyan sees Babri as ?act of God??, Dec 4). Who is Singh trying 

to fool this time? The Liberhan commission? The people of India? The media? Or 

himself finally? Till yesterday, it was the ?Lal-Bihari-Joshi? axis which is said 

to have plotted to demolish the mosque. But now, since the axis has ultimately, 

with the help of their six years of accumulated wealth, succeeded in purchasing 

Singh?s better senses, he is out to blame his creator for all the sins he himself 

has committed. Here is my free advice Mr Kalyan Singh ? be fearful of the future. 

The world is mortal and at the end of the day, we will all have to return to our 

creators and be held accountable. Will you be able to convince god of his hand 

in the ?act? then? 

Yours faithfully,

Touseef Ahmed Khan, Calcutta 

Wrong exercises

 Sir ? On the day of the December 3 bandh, I was on the Midnapore-Howrah local train (MH-108), which left Midnapore at 5:55 am. There was a rush of passengers who wanted to bypass any likely problems created by the bandh. But Trinamool supporters kept three concrete slabs on the tracks between Gokulpur and Girimaidan stations. The driver could not see the slabs and hit them at full speed. The train jumped and stopped. At the same time, the overhead live wire, together with the steel structure, broke off and fell on the roof of the train. There could have been a major accident, but fortunately it did not happen. Is this a way of making a bandh peaceful? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

 Sir ? Bandhs and hartals were Gandhi?s way of fighting the British and they went a long way in bringing India its independence. The Constitution, when it was adopted, sanctioned these methods of political protest. Today, these methods mean nothing but trouble. But then, the Constitution-makers could not have known the ingenuity of politicians like Mamata Banerjee, and what they could do with such instruments.

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? In ?Muscle drill? (Dec 2), Abhirup Sarkar does not explain why bandhs or strikes are more frequent in Bengal compared to other states. Is it because the average people here are poorer than in other states and their party pretends to stand up for their cause more than they do in other states? Actually, there is more to it than meets the eye. Otherwise, how one can explain the high success rates of even all-India strikes in banks and airports in Bengal when they fail miserably in other states? 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Exemplary action should be taken against Citu leaders, as also the state minister of transport and Trinamool leaders, who were seen on television giving physical and moral support to the disruptive activities, in other words, the bandhs.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? To combat the bandh on December 3, the administration placed police officers all over the state and yet could not prevent shops being closed down. What a welcome to the delegates at Infocomm!

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak John, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Constitution guarantees certain fundamental rights. The freedom to assemble peacefully and without arms is one of them. But no right is absolute, and like the others, this right too is subject to certain restrictions like defamation, danger to the integrity and sovereignty of India, indecency and, above all, public disorder. No political party should force its members or the citizens to violate these regulations. A political party can?t force its programmes on the public. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Rimli Datta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Our leaders hold bandhs in the name of upholding the constitutional rights on our behalf. But no party has the support of more than 30 to 40 per cent of the electorate. The Trinamool Congress, for example, has only one member of parliament and a handful of members of legislative assembly; the SUCI almost represents no one in West Bengal. As for our fundamental rights, don?t we have the right to earn wages on all 365 days of the year or take the sick to the hospital?

 The judiciary may still have a long way to go in fulfilling public expectations but at least it has shown that it is the only strong and free arm of the Constitution. The only fear is, what after the judiciary? The armed forces? Won?t that mean an end of democracy?

 Yours faithfully,

Partha De Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir ? Both the Citu and the TMC refuse to receive the written court order against the bandh. This puts a big question mark on the power actually wielded by the judiciary. Also, the court?s warning to the public not to enjoy a bandh day as paid holiday went in vain. On one of these bandhs, a popular FM channel was heard asking husbands what special plan they had for their wives on that day.

 Yours faithfully,

Ambalika, Kalyani

 GEORGE BUSH, YOU ARE FIRED

 GOURI CHATTERJEE

 Bob Botfeld is a computer systems engineer who gave up his cushy job in a New York firm six months ago, to devote all his energies to ?the most important election? of his 50-something life. A few weeks ago, he and some friends set up office in a rundown stationery shop not far from Columbia University. And so busy have they been since that Bob barely has time to go home for lunch, a mere five-minute walk away.

 ?Last week alone we had more than 3,000 people filling out voter registration forms in just this office,? he says with a tired grin, as he feverishly organizes the array of ?George Bush You Are Fired? and ?No CARB (Cheney Ashcroft Rumsfeld Bush) And Absolutely No Rice Diet? badges they?ve laid out for sale on trestle-tables outside. With the last date for voter registration in New York over on Saturday, Botfeld and his merry band of ?independent Democrats? are now concentrating mainly on drawing up lists of volunteers who will go to such ?battleground? states as Florida and Ohio to get the vote out on D-day and prevent the sort of ?intimidation and disenfranchisement? that put George Bush in the White House four years ago.

 A different country

 New York, they say, is a different country, they do things differently from America there. But may be not in this election. Come November 2, there might be double the number of people voting in America than in 2000, thanks entirely to volunteers like Botfeld across the country, but of course on both sides of the divide. ?It?s very important to me to have my voice heard,? say these first-timers. Many of them celebrated their 18th birthday a long time ago but never before felt the urge to become a voter.

 How very different the American presidential election is turning out to be up, close and personal. It?s nowhere near being just a media event that the all-consuming hype over the presidential debates would have one believe. In fact, it is not the media that is setting the agenda in this election. Rather, political players on both sides are paying less attention to debates, polls or posturing. They?re too busy assembling the volunteer armies for the final battle: mobilizing people to vote.

 No mood for blather

 Elderly Americans say they can?t remember anything like this ever. They haven?t seen such passions, such division since the Vietnam-era. Columnists claim that the last election to generate such intensity was the one between Kennedy and Nixon way back in 1962. Over the years, peace, prosperity and the push towards small governments, combined with general disenchantment with politicians and the political process, resulted in apathy and low voter turnout ? leaving the field clear for the media to revel in.

 The rising power of television meant the presidential debates became memorable only for those moments the media chose to highlight ? Nixon?s five o?clock shadow (1962), Bush Sr?s glances at his watch (1988), Al Gore?s sighs (2000). The contest for the most important job in the world got reduced to sellable concerns like body language and likeability factor. (Something like what we saw in our big cities last summer.)

 But not now. Not when politics is a matter of life and death, literally. So the discussions over the presidential debates have seen substance triumph over style. The focus is on what the two contenders are saying, or leaving unclear, at debates, at stump speeches, to the press. The American voter is in no mood for vapid blather these days. ?People are paying attention to the issues like we?ve never seen before,? politicians say. Like it or not, the media has to learn to follow suit.

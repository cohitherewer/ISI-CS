 Letters to Editor

 Misplaced sympathies

 Sir ? The report, ?PM political baptism?(Oct 7), is needlessly goggle-eyed about the prime minister?s political savvy. Manmohan Singh has been in politics for over two decades now. Earlier he was a successful academic and bureaucrat. Surely the attributes of man- management and self-projection required in politics are not too different from those required in the academia and bureaucracy? Not that Singh is not honest and soft-spoken, but to imply that he is also wet behind the ears is an insult to his intelligence.

 Yours faithfully,

Jaimala Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Without drive

 Sir ? The government rhetoric that comes through in ?Austerity axe falls on cars to cash cows? (Sept 29) appears serious, but in the end it may just amount to starving government offices of staplers. Clamping down on official travel or procurement of new cars is all very well. But no politician is able to see beyond his self-interest. Had it been otherwise, there would not have been such a large number of ministries and government departments which are of no practical use. 

 Some Central government ministries like agriculture, rural development, small-scale industry and so on do at the Centre what can be done effectively at the state-level. For example, one ministry for energy would have sufficed. The public enterprises concerned could have done their job under the supervision of appropriate regulators. But no. We have separate ministries for power, petroleum and non-conventional energy. Some ministries like education and health should be much smaller since they are primarily state subjects. But as usual, there has been no talk of cutting down expenditure by reducing the size of the government. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anupam Sett, Calcutta

 Sir ? The austerity drive of the Manmohan Singh government is nothing new. Something similar was planned when the earlier government took over. The problem is the complete lack of accountability in the executive. For example, the government does not clearly spell out who is to fall in line with its diktat, the minister or his secretary? Can the government really curb the foreign travel of its ministers? One single foreign visit by a minister and his family (which invariably tags along) equals ten such visits by the minnows. An austerity drive is meaningless if it doesn?t include both the ministers and the babus.

 Yours faithfully,

Arta Mishra, Cuttack

 Sir ? During the regime of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, there were times when junior ministers complained to the prime minister that there wasn?t enough work for them. The situation is unlikely to be different now except for the fact that similar action without being vetted by the United Progressive Alliance supremo may result in troubles for the complainant. The fact is that there are more ministers than required. Departments, even though superfluous, are kept alive to accommodate ministers on the basis of either caste, religion or coalition contingencies. The two main political parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, should take the full blame for being unable to limit the number of ministries as per the recommendations of the Sarkaria commission. In case the government has decided not to adhere to important decisions taken by commissions set up by itself, what is the use of laying new guidelines? Banks and industries undergoing reforms have managed better output with lesser number of people. The cut in expenditure should start from the top ranks, unless we buy Manmohan Singh?s theory about the compulsions of coalition politics.

Yours faithfully, 

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

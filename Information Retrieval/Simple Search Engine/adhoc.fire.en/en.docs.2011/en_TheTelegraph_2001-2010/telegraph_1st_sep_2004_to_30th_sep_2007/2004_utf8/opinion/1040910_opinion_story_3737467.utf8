 WRAP AROUND

 A cloth and a garment

The Sari By Mukulika Banerjee and Daniel Miller, Roli, 

Rs 1,250

It is inexplicable that two professors of University 

College, London have produced this book. The sari is a potentially fascinating 

subject to study the interplay of history, culture, design and textiles. But don?t 

be fooled by the smart packaging. A few pages into The Sari and one is 

left wondering why Mukulika Banerjee and Daniel Miller made so little effort to 

produce a work with some cultural insight or factual accuracy. Why a publisher 

should take it on is even more puzzling.

 Had The Sari been positioned as a coffee-table book, the deficiencies of the text may have been pardonable. Not only is it packed with prose, but the numerous pictures in this glossy volume are also remarkably drab, and a large number are in bizarrely bad taste. This too is difficult to understand, since the subject lends itself to stunning visuals. 

 The authors have tried to present Indian women?s dynamic relationship, through the years, with five metres of cloth. Apparently, Banerjee, an anthropologist, spent four years in Bengal researching the book. One wonders whom she spoke to when one reads such offensive generalizations as ?desperately unhappy brides typically end their misery by hanging themselves from the ceiling by their pallu?.

 The book quotes extensively from interviews with unnamed women. It also makes up anecdotes wherever convenient. Mina, whose diary the authors refer to in order to reinforce their point, is a fictional character ? a middle-class woman from a small metro city, a south Indian married to a Bengali, who has taken her years to feel comfortable in a sari. 

 There are other fictitious characters as well. Like the ?horny? man who tries to have sex with a woman in a sari. He is confused about how to navigate the garment, when in one deft move, she hitches up the expanse of material. ?The only problem was that she looked like she had a quilt on her middle, but it was accessible, very accessible.?

 Not to be missed for its sublime absurdity is the little drama the authors concoct about the complicated act of purchasing a sari. The characters in the play are a husband, a wife and a shop assistant. ?The scenario is based...on a conversation we recorded, with speculative unspoken thoughts in parenthesis.? What follows are five inane pages. 

 The concluding chapters, in which the authors turn to more interesting issues, are better. The chapter on trendsetters looks at icons like Indira Gandhi, Rekha and more recently, television soap stars, who wore saris. It is moderately engaging and quite readable. 

 While not particularly insightful, the final chapter on the production, design and survival of the sari contain some valid information.

 In sum, readers will be better off staying away from The Sari. But as long as authors and publishers eye foreign exchange (one hopes this book is not intended for domestic consumption), such instances of shabby writing and editing are likely to continue being published.

 BEYOND DRAMA

 The decision of India and Pakistan to continue with the ceasefire between them will invite widespread relief. The external affairs minister, Mr K. Natwar Singh, and his counterpart, Mr Khursheed Mahmud Kasuri, have also agreed to a series of incremental steps to take the composite dialogue process forward. By all accounts, the meeting of the two foreign ministers in New Delhi has been satisfactory and productive. The decision to sustain the ceasefire which has been operative since November, 2003, is significant. Before the ceasefire, shelling across the line of control created havoc in bordering villages. Similarly, the military confrontation in Siachen had led to hundreds of casualties on both sides.

 Most of this stopped after a ceasefire was declared. It was unreal, however, to expect a dramatic breakthrough or to imagine that differences over cross-border terrorism and Jammu and Kashmir would be resolved after a couple of meetings. But it was critical for New Delhi and Islamabad to agree to continue talking in spite of the disagreements. Thankfully, the two foreign ministers have agreed to do this at various levels of the composite dialogue. In the days preceding the meeting of the two foreign ministers, however, there was a growing perception that Pakistan was intensifying hostilities in Kashmir. Violence had begun to escalate in the valley and there were reports of increased infiltration. There was also a feeling in New Delhi that Pakistan was trying to sabotage the internal dialogue with the separatists from Kashmir. Indeed, on the eve of the talks, Mr Kasuri had declared that Kashmiris should be involved in the dialogue; something that he knew would be clearly unacceptable to New Delhi. Besides the ceasefire, the two countries have agreed to hold technical talks on the Khokrapar-Munabao Rail link, to continue discussions on nuclear confidence-building measures, and improve communications between the coast guards of both sides. The issue of opening the road link between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad seems to have been discussed and some progress has appropriately been made. 

 Interestingly, the Hurriyat leader, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who met Mr Kasuri, seems to have emphasized the need for introducing specific confidence-building measures in Jammu and Kashmir, including the opening of communication links across the line of control. The gradualism that seems to have defined the meeting of the two foreign ministers is clearly the way forward. It should be clear, by now, that peace in south Asia cannot be created through dramatic gestures or on the basis of an instant formula. Peace has to be built brick by brick through a series of incremental steps which create constituencies that will have a strong stake in the stability of south Asia. That process has, perhaps, begun.

 CASTE IN CLASS

 The relationship between literacy and social change is far from unproblematic in India. Deep in rural Bengal, the problem of caste has cropped up in a rather unexpected form among the children attending a primary school. The mid-day meal served in Bankura?s Beerbhanpur village school is cooked by a local organization run by women from the Bagdi and Bauri communities. For a while now, the Brahmin students of the school, mostly very small children, have been refusing to eat this meal. They have made it quite clear to the school authorities that they have been instructed to boycott these meals by their parents because the food has been prepared by lower-caste women. Most of these Brahmin families have moved into Bankura from the cow-belt and Orissa, and most of the students in the school are from these families. Out of about 169 children, almost 115 have boycotted the meals. The block development officer, the inspector of schools and the panchayat pradhan have all tried to persuade the children and their families. But the parents are adamant. Some of them have pointed out that there are plenty of Brahmin women who are living below the poverty line. So the problem should be solved by employing these women to cook the meals. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal is aware of this situation, and is awaiting a report. Its leaders in Calcutta have admitted that caste is not a non-problem in a state which they have ruled for almost three decades.

 Two processes of socialization are obviously working together, quite effectively, on these children. They are being made literate in their primary school, while their parents educate them in the ways of the world. Political parties and the institutions of state are part of this complex education. And within this formation, radically conflicting elements co-exist. In Kerala, impressive literacy rates have always co-existed with caste and dowry, cutting across religions and social class. Rich Christians remain sternly mindful of dowry and caste, together with their Hindu and Muslim neighbours. The growth of communism is just another thread in this fabric. Yet, more than a political solution ? governmental edicts, for instance ? relentless consciousness-raising through education, actively and persistently involving the communities concerned, is the only way of countering these traditions. Children can always be taught to question the values that they ?naturally? inherit.

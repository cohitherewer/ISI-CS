 Paperback Pickings

 Words loaded with meaning

Keywords: Identity (Vistaar, Rs 195) 

edited by Nadia Tazi takes a look at the issues of race and ethnicity as 

they are encountered in Africa, America, the Arab world, China, Europe and India. 

The essays are lucidly written, by eminent scholars and academics. While Mahmood 

Mamdani shows how colonialism has shaped ethnic identities in Rwanda, Wang Bin 

talks about China?s interesting semantic experiments with identity. ?There are 

two distinct but interrelated...expressions alternately employed? to express ?identity?: 

Shen Fen and Ren Tong. ?To identify oneself in the sense of Shen Fen is to know 

or show one?s own place in society in various semiotic manners. This sounds a 

far cry from the newly created expression Shen Fen Zheng (identity card), which 

does not distinguish between superiority and inferiority.?

Yellow Hibiscus (Penguin, Rs 250) by 

Rukmini Bhaya Nair is the latest collection of poems from the extraordinarily 

productive writer of The Ayodhya Cantos. The number of poems being rather 

large, it takes some effort to trudge through them, especially since the poet 

goes into a tizzy juggling with form and content. The poems ? with their invocations 

of Noam Chomsky and Sappho, use of computer jargon, and parading of the poet?s 

learning ? are pretentious at best. Or more simply, a gush of related and unrelated 

words. 

Selected Malayalam short stories (Fusion, 

Rs 95) edited by Rajendra Awasthy contains stories by well known authors 

such as Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, Takazhi Sivasankara Pillai and Kamala Das. The 

quality of the translations, however, leaves much room for improvement.

Eastwords (Penguin, Rs 275) by Kalyan 

Ray brings Shakespeare to Indian shores and makes the bard, and his characters, 

rub shoulders with the villagers and deities of the Sunderbans. Shakespeare becomes 

the narrator, Sheikh Piru, harking back to the 18th and 19th centuries when Shakespeare 

was adapted by vernacular writers of India. Shakespeare may have undergone a minor 

metamorphosis, but characters from The Tempest and A Midsummer Night?s 

Dream, such as Prospero, Oberon, Puck and Caliban appear in their familiar 

avatars. The novel is a maze of allusions in which both the colonizer and the 

colonized seem to have a lot of fun.

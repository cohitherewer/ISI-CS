 NEVER TOO LATE TO BE GRATEFUL

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 Why do we ride so roughshod over the gifts that our best allies strew in our path?

 Without conditions

 My mother died ? when was it ? two months ago? (My, how time flies when you?re having a rotten time.) There now, I?ve said it at last, in black and white, so I suppose it?s happened. But while I?m aware that this is of enormous consequence only to me, I also know that nearly all of us have known there are some awakenings which come with the final sleep. And in my case, they had to do with the circumstances of my mother?s passing away.

 She used to live in another part of town, and one day we bundled her into the car by surprise so she could get away from the sameness of her surroundings and enjoy the change with us. Three days into her stay, I got a call in the middle of the night. It was an SOS from a friend in Delhi to whom I owed a great deal, and who insisted that I join her immediately. When I explained to my mother that I would have to be away for a couple of days, she didn?t understand why. We argued a bit, but she let me win the debate ? she always did ? and I left. I returned on the next flight in response to a phone call from Calcutta, but by that time she was in coma. And then she died.

 So there you go. I have to live with that for the rest of my life. 

 Rather more selfishly, I have to live with the knowledge that no one is going to give in to my gormless ways without question again. Or lay themselves down as safety nets for my many leaps of faithlessness. Or, for that matter, let me win an argument.

 Allow me another memory (although I hasten to add that this self-and-others-pitying little monody is not about my mother but all the meek who will never inherit the earth). I was between jobs then and causing quite a din about having nothing to do. ?Why don?t you write?? she suggested (she held writers in healthy disrespect and consequently believed that I was more than equal to their task). ?What about?? I responded surlily. ?About me!? she said brightly. The schtick that I am, I looked at her with scorn.

 Why do we ride so roughshod over the gifts that our best allies ? the self-effacing friend, the patient teacher, the gentleman boss, the helpful stranger in the street ? strew in our path? And why does only death ? or departure of a kind ? shock us into surprised gratitude to them? And wonder whether they, too, never knew the unspoken assumption that we had loved them all along?

 And so, all unrequited lovers of the human race, I?m hugely sorry. I just wish my mother was around to hear it. Because I know she?d say that I needn?t apologize.

 Sleepless in the city

 - ?One in four people in the country suffers from insomnia? 

 Do you toss and turn all night? Vishnupriya Sengupta reports on what causes one of the major lifestyle disorders affecting young urban professionals 

today

There are 12 hours in the waking day ? but what feels like a hundred in a night for the sleepless. In today?s fast-paced, hi-tech world, getting a good night?s sleep is no easy task, though those wide awake at night may assume that they are in good company. Famous insomniacs include Winston Churchill, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Vincent Van Gogh and even Margaret Thatcher who had once said, ?Sleep is for wimps.? Their need for little or no sleep has been touted down the ages as a sign of genius. 

 But doctors in India beg to differ. Sleep disorders, the experts stress, are the dark side of a 24x7 society. The president of Counsellors Association of India, Mumbai-based psychiatrist Harish Shetty, says that insomnia ranks among the top disorders affecting the urban population today. ?Our studies show one in four is affected,? he says. Reports of yet another national clinic-based study conducted by postgraduate students of the Central Institute of Psychiatry in Ranchi second Shetty?s claim. 

 But what is of serious concern is the alarming rate at which the number of life-style-induced insomniacs or people suffering from sleep deprivation is going up, avers Calcutta-based neuro-psychiatrist Ashim Chatterjee. What makes it worse is that it is tightening its grip over the Indian youth. 

 ?Insomnia is being reported among people in the age group of 25 to 30 years,? stresses Ali Khwaja, head of the Bangalore-based counselling centre, Banjara Academy. And the reason is not far to seek. ?It has become fashionable to keep late hours. It is no longer considered hip to stick to normal timings,? he points out. 

 Indians, clearly, are busier than ever before. So much so that sleep is now looked upon as an inconvenience. It eats into time when a young professional could otherwise be working, partying or pubbing. A society that is on the move 24 hours implies that nights are no longer synonymous with sleep. BPOs and call centres have mushroomed, the IT-industry boom persists, MNCs and supermarkets jostle for space. Television, radio and movie channels broadcast day and night. The spread of the Internet has led to a situation where more and more people spend their sleeping hours surfing the Net or entering web chat rooms. Ten years ago, a common family telephone in the living room curtailed any kind of a yearning for a late-night chat. But personal mobiles and the ongoing fad for SMS-ing have blurred all hours. 

 Small wonder, it has been estimated by a US survey that a person?s average nightly sleeping time has been reduced by two hours over the past decade. ?I have several patients who say they don?t go home at all while working on a project. They just spread out on the office chair, and catch a catnap and get back to work,? says Khwaja. 

 This is more so as many Indians work according to US time. ?This involves long night-time work hours when our bodies? internal clocks assume that we should be resting. Then there are those who juggle more than one job, some who study and work simultaneously,? says consultant psychiatrist Avdesh Sharma, associated with the Parivartan Centre of Mental Health in New Delhi. ?This is in keeping with the demands of a consumerist society where material comforts gain top priority,? he reasons. 

 The hectic work schedules demand long hours, which, in turn, lead to erratic eating habits. Doctors agree that despite attention to diet and exercise, binge- eating has become a regular habit with young professionals. ?They forget about eating while meeting deadlines. Once free, they go on an eating binge. This can be attributed to a disruption in the sleep-wake cycle,? says Khwaja.

 Sleeplessness, however, can have serious side-effects. Psychiatrist Aniruddha Deb states that such erratic lifestyles are bound to worsen people?s reactions to stress and can cause a nervous breakdown. Deb, who is attached to Mon, a psychiatric nursing home in Calcutta, recounts how one of his patients ? working for a multinational bank ? goes into on an overdrive at the end of every financial year. ?He works till midnight and is then again required to get up by three in the morning to present the accounts to his head office in the US. The gentleman is at his tether?s end and knows he might suffer from a nervous breakdown any day, but he seems helpless.? 

 With the world becoming smaller and encroaching into individual space, sleep deprivation is a natural fallout. Delhi-based Sanjay Manchanda, head of the sleep clinic at Sir Gangaram Hospital, however, makes a subtle distinction between insomnia and dissomnia. He contends, ?The majority of the sleep disorders are a form of dissomnia which means the patients do sleep, but not as much as they should.? Since the advent of artificial light in homes, he says, there has been a 10-fold increase in sleep-related disorders. ?The human body is programmed to go to sleep at 7.30 or 8 pm. But artificial light caused us to remain up for longer hours, thus breaking our sleep cycles.? 

 In general, doctors usually prescribe eight hours of sleep every night. Chatterjee explains that natural sleep patterns are controlled by an internal body clock called a circadian clock. ?It regulates body temperature, hormone levels, heart rate and other vital functions. If we start ignoring our circadian clocks, we?ll become a society of insomniacs,? he says. And the result would be obesity, heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and sugar levels. ?The overall health is affected as is a person?s memory and moods. People become a hazard to themselves and to others.? 

 People who are willingly staying up at night often resort to stimulants such as coffee and cigarettes to cut down on sleep. There are others who make use of drugs to stay up. ?Drugs such as amphithetamine and modafinil coupled with caffeine and alcohol help keep people awake,? says Sharma. ?And then when they want to sleep they take alcohol, over-the-counter drugs such as Benzodiapines and sleeping pills. That is one of the primary causes of insomnia.? 

 Those seeking solutions to their sleep disorder may well take a leaf out of US President George ?eight-hour nighter? Bush?s book. Bush reportedly hit the bed at 11 pm on the night war was declared on Iraq ? just 45 minutes after his address to the US nation ? with instructions that he was not to be disturbed before 6 am. 

 But, seemingly unlike Bush, most people seem to be unaware of the long-term damaging effects of insomnia. ?It is easy for the youth to bounce back from insomnia bouts. But they are headed for trouble in the future,? warns Khwaja. He cites the instance of one of his patients ? a middle-aged mother of two teenage children and a working professional ? who complained of depression and insomnia. ?She had been balancing home and career for 15 years. She had suffered insomnia early in her career but overcame it. She had the second bout when her teenage daughter started staying out late at night. This was a trigger. Her cumulative stress spilled over. She went into severe depression and lost sleep completely.? 

Not everyone then is as lucky as Winston Churchill 

who claimed to have got by with catnapping. It may have worked for the late British 

statesman, but for most others, lack of sleep is a problem to contend with. As 

Friedrich Nietzsche once proclaimed, ?Sleeping is no mean art: for its sake one 

must stay awake all day.? 

CATCH SOME ZZZ 

Here are 10 steps to improve your sleep hygiene and 

counter lifestyle-induced insomnia. Doctors agree drugs are best avoided and that 

50 per cent of people with sleeping problems usually respond to these behavioural 

techniques. 

 1 Keep regular hours - Boring it may be but go to bed and get up at the same 

time even on weekends. When it comes to sleep, we respond well to regularity. 

 2 avoid caffeinated drinks - Coffee, tea and cola should be avoided after 

6 pm. Alcohol can be soporific but its excess can cause a rebound 

effect, disturbing normal sleep patterns. 

 3 dont take your troubles to bed - Practise breathing exercises to 

calm the body and soothe the mind.

 4 Avoid heavy dinners - Avoid heavy meals late at night and eating or reading 

in bed.

 5 exercise daily - Keep energetic exercises for the earlier part of the day. 

If its too close to bedtime, it can raise the metabolic rate and overstimulate 

the body. 

 6 get a good mattress - Use one which provides a sleep surface that conforms 

to your body-size and weight. 

 7 set up a pre-sleep routine - For instance, you could try brushing your 

teeth and changing into comfortable night clothes. 

 8 take a shower - Add essential oils such as lavender, sandalwood etc to 

a warm/cold bath before going to bed to help relax and soothe frayed nerves. 

 9 reduce noise - Environmental disturbance, noise from your snoring partner, 

that of the TV or radio can disturb sleep. 

 10 dont watch tv - The images can be stimulating and the light from 

the TV can keep you wide awake.

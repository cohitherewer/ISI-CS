 HUNGRY TO BED

 Does it at all make sense to talk of the ?rights? of a hungry child in India? For most of their legal childhood, children have no voice in the Indian political system, and children from disadvantaged families are twice removed from the democratic process. Not only are they spoken for by others, such as their parents, but the parents themselves are deprived of access to democratic institutions. This is what fosters the invisibility of hungry children in India, a victim of not only poverty, but also of the systemic failure of public interventions. This is the larger perspective from which the current Indian rates of child undernutrition may be understood. The Indian figure for the proportion of children suffering from chronic malnutrition ? as on World Food Day, October 15 ? was 53 per cent. The percentage figures for underweight under-fives in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal are 47, 48, 38 and 47 respectively, that for sub-Saharan Africa being 30.

 It is true that chronic malnourishment has declined from the Seventies to the present. But this is largely because of the progress made by Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The regional variations are stark, and it seems that child malnourishment has very little to do with per capita income. Mass poverty is obviously not the whole story here. The poverty levels of Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh are quite similar, but child undernutrition is twice as high in UP. This is because education levels in the state are abysmal, public health services virtually non-existent, women are generally disempowered (particularly rural women), and anganwadis are closed most of the time, when they exist at all. Even when they are open, children rarely get any food, apart from the failure of other essential services like vaccination and pre-school education. In Tamil Nadu, by contrast, most children are enrolled in the local anganwadi centre, nutritious food is available every day throughout the year, and more than 90 per cent of the children are fully vaccinated. This contrast is even more remarkable given that the Integrated Child Development Scheme is Centrally sponsored and based on similar guidelines throughout the country. This speaks of the overwhelming influence of the social and political context in shaping the outcome of particular policies.

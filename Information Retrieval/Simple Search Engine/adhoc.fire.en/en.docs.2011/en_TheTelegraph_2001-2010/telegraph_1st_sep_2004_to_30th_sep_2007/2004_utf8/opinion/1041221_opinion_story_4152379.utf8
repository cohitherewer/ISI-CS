 NOT VIABLE

 The United Progressive Alliance government, goaded by the national advisory council, is certain to place the rural employment guarantee bill before parliament in the winter session. The bill may be referred to a select committee. But given that it is a national common minimum programme commitment and has evident populist overtones, it is unlikely that any political party will eventually oppose the legislation. The outcome will be guaranteed employment of sorts. And just as a guaranteed right to education has not ensured that all children are in schools, such a legislation will hardly improve rural employment. One should not forget that more than 55 per cent of India?s labour force reports itself as self-employed. Stated differently, the government?s job should be to ensure a facilitating environment for private sector employment-generation, and that includes public investments in rural infrastructure and the social sectors. 

 The intention of the present legislation is completely misconceived. Had the focus been on unemployment insurance, a subset of social security, there would have been less reason for complaint. The core of the debate has, however, centred on the employment guarantee for 100 days, instead of unemployment insurance, the only reservation about doles being that the fiscal responsibility for this vests with state governments, which would like this expense to be borne by the Centre. NGOs prominently represented in the NAC have complained about the apparent dilution in the present bill. Compared to the NCMP promise, there was an obvious dilution by restricting employment guarantee to the rural economy alone. Within the rural sector, NGOs and the left are now complaining about guarantees being restricted to 150 backward districts, about there being no time frame for implementation, and about the government?s freedom to cut off guarantees should there be no proximate cause for deprivation in those districts. The government?s apparent dilution has been driven by fiscal considerations, since the limits can bring down costs from around Rs 40,000 crore a year to Rs 10,000 crore. The point, however, is not costs. Had state governments been in a position to implement employment guarantees, no one would have grudged even Rs 40,000 crore, equivalent to one per cent of the gross domestic product. The point is about implementation.

 HERE TO STAY

 A great many English teachers in West Bengal owe an easy life to what calls itself communism in the state. Getting to teach a language without bothering to know it very well is a rare privilege. And to do this in the name of fighting imperialism and the class war gives it a touch of glory. This happy state of affairs has been rudely disrupted now. English is being taught again from class I in the government schools. Moreover, the political leadership seems to have turned over a new leaf on this issue. None other than the chief minister has publicly put the All Bengal Teachers? Association in place. The ABTA had resolved to launch a movement to demand the abolition of primary-level English, and Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will have none of this. Primary English is here to stay, Mr Bhattacharjee has declared, so the teachers better get their act together. For the ABTA, this is like a double betrayal. The chief minister has let down an ideology and a work ethic, firmly entrenched in Bengal?s traditions of teaching and politics over the last three decades.

 It would be unjust to blame only the teachers for lowering the standard of English-teaching in primary schools. The government has also played a sad and ridiculous game with its policies on English. Students were to be introduced to it in class I before 1981, in class VI between 1981 and ?86, then in class V until 1998, after which it was pushed down to class III. Now, it is back to class I, bolstered by a last-minute recognition that learning the language well from an early stage is essential for Bengal to be able to cope with the globalized world. If the state is to prevent itself from falling by the wayside, then its English teachers have to be trained to work properly, even if that looks like an impossible task at the moment. If these teachers do insist on keeping themselves unionized, then this unity should be utilized to improve their skills as teachers. Teachers? unions in West Bengal seem to exist for reasons that have nothing at all to do with the principles and practices of education. There is a conspicuous lack of any organized attempt to bring to the profession a degree of introspection or inspiration. This is, of course, not just a question of apathy or politicization, but also of governmental cluelessness and indifference. It will be impossible for Mr Bhattacharjee to reverse this tradition without the cooperation of the teachers themselves.

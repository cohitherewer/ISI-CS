 LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDS

 Never the twain shall meet

A Black Englishman

By Carolyn Slaughter,

Faber, pound; 10.99

It is around 1920 in Wales. Isabel Webb is a young 

woman ?frightfully in love with love?. Running away from a war that had claimed 

her paramour and decimated the morale of a people, the rich girl decides to marry 

a poor young soldier, Neville, and make her way to ?a heart-shaped continent that 

was thrumming with excitement and glamour all for me?. Isabel was coming to India.

 From this rather unoriginal beginning, Carolyn Slaughter creates a fast-paced romance. The young soldier, rather conveniently, turns out to be a scoundrel, but Isabel is struck by passion the day she arrives at the Ferozepur cantonment. Samresh Singh, a doctor and a gentleman, takes her breath away as soon as she lays eyes on him. He is an intoxicating mix of English class and education, and all that is good about India. It is a flame that most women in her position would have chosen to snuff out.

 This may not sound overly appealing with bookshelves full of predictable novels of this kind set in the raj. But Slaughter salvages the rather paltry plot with a gripping love story. The intense relationship between Isabel and Sam is its driving force.

 The equations of race are, as the title suggests, pivotal to the narrative. Sam is an Eton and Oxford man who chose, as an adult, to return to India ? albeit to a life of privilege. But in India, he finds he is as much an outsider as in England ? ?I was invisible wherever I went because wherever I went I was colonised.? And in an India in the grip of the freedom movement, these contradictions are bound to surface.

 The title of the novel applies equally to Isabel. She falls in love with India, and she craves the anonymity of being a black woman in this massive land. But this desire, too, is infected with contradictions. Her otherness involves gender as much as it does colonialism. As a white woman ? and a soldier?s wife ? Isabel must follow a strict code. As a native, she may be anonymous and free to love an Indian, but sexual norms are even more stringent.

 At the time it was unacceptable ? and dangerous ? for an Indian man to have a liaison with a memsahib, though dalliances between sahibs and native women were frequent and tolerated. Apart from the clash of cultures, Isabel and Sam also take conventional morality head on. Both are married. Slaughter deals with this rather conveniently. Neville is shown to be a philandering beast. Sam?s wife is a distant woman, their alliance having been arranged. Tragedy follows but love survives. And Isabel, having found love, also recognizes the need for independence and for being of some use to society.

 Slaughter?s India of 90 years ago could well be the India of today. One episode crucial to the narrative is almost a re-enactment of Godhra, down to the train massacre and the violence that followed, only with the Indian police replaced by British soldiers. But politics remains in the backdrop. What adds to the lovers appeal for readers is the crisp, entertaining and incisive conversation between the two. Slaughter does away wholly with quotation marks, breathing life into her prose along with a touching intimacy.

 The novel is dedicated to Slaughter?s grandmother, Anne Webb, who spent most of her life shut away in an asylum in Ranchi. Also, it is ?loosely based? on her life.

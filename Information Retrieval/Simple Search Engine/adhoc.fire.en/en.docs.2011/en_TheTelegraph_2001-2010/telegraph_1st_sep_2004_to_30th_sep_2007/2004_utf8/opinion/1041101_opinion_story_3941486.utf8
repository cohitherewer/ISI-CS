 Letters to Editor

 Killing with kindness

 Sir ? The ?Breeding proposal to save antelopes? (Oct 26) is absurd, although environmentalists will feel elated at the prospect of conservation of the Himalayan chirus. But it must not be a ploy to revitalize the shahtoosh trade. Past experience has taught us to be wary of activists who come up with ideas to save endangered species. A trustee of the Wildlife Trust once lobbied vigorously for ?redeeming? the rich and the famous who had bought shahtoosh ?unknowingly?. Who were the trust trying to save, the chirus or the rich and the famous? By the same logic, paedophiles and drug traffickers can also feign ?ignorance?. The only way to save chirus is to hold bonfires of unregistered shahtooshes, as the African countries did with ivory. With demand slumping, poachers will find it unviable to kill chirus. Chirus are not broiler chicken, who can be reared and killed to feed human greed.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Old wine in new bottle

 Sir ? L.K. Advani?s announcement at the national council meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party (the formal name for his coronation ceremony) that the party would go back to its core ideology may finally prove to be his undoing. The sangh parivar is under the impression that Hindutva catapulted its political brothers to power six years ago. It may have mobilized a section of the Hindus, but far more important were the anti-incumbency factor and the public perception of the BJP as a party with a difference. The BJP is aware of this, or it would not have projected the liberal face of the party, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as the future prime minister.

 But six years in power has shown the BJP to be just as corrupt, incompetent and indisciplined as any other party in power. Even those who had rallied behind it on the temple construction issue are disillusioned, as the BJP in power did precious little about it. What made them even more hostile was Advani?s public admission that the destruction of Babri Masjid was a mistake. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has made it clear that it harbours no great hopes of Advani as the new BJP chief. The shrewd politician in Advani has sensed that the Ram temple is no longer an issue behind which people can be rallied. 

 In any case, the issue has been long dead for the majority of the Hindus. Besides, the vigorous pursuit of economic reforms by the BJP government did not endear it to the people. Adding to their general sense of insecurity were closure of industries, rising unemployment, and the diminishing interest rates on savings. Who has time to think about the Ram temple? Militant Hindutva can only alienate the people instead of bringing them into the BJP fold. And if Advani sticks to his hardline stand, he will find it increasingly difficult to keep the National Democratic Alliance together.

 Yours faithfully

R. Sen, Dhanbad

 Sir ? Indian politics and especially elections have always been about washing one?s dirty linen in public. It was entirely in keeping with this tradition that L.K. Advani declared Hindutva as synonymous with nationalism and dismissed the Congress as a nationalist group. It would be more desirable if the new BJP president kept his communal urges at bay and concentrated on the uplift of our nation. But for that, he would have to lead his party into playing the constructive opposition. Would that be expecting too much of him?

 Yours faithfully,

Bibhabari Rath, Cuttack

 Sir ? The new captain of the BJP has opened his innings on expected lines. Within one week of his becoming president of the right-wing party, communal riots have started in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bhopal. It is feared that the BJP will come back more aggressively on the Hindutva agenda now and will again play the mandir card, not to mention the many rath yatras to stoke communal fire all around the country. If we are not careful, we may soon face another spell of dreaded sectarian violence.

 Yours faithfully,

Najmi Rizvi, Sonbhadra, UP

 Sir ? Radhika Ramaseshan?s article, ?Ram yes, but no rath? (Oct 28) mentions the BJP?s intention to focus primarily on the issue of building the Ram temple at Ayodhya. But what the BJP needs to do is frame its policy around economic liberalization and its religious ideals. First, the party should declare its commitment to privatize all public sector enterprises except defence, and route the funds saved to developing commercial agriculture such as cotton, tobacco, tea, coffee and rubber. Focussing on privatization and agriculture would consolidate the urban middle class votes in its favour, and picking up rural votes as well. Second, the new president should trigger off a campaign to persuade all temples to allow entry to the historically underprivileged Dalits. Showing its intent to reform Hinduism, the BJP will be able to form a stable alliance with Dalits and the other backward classes without moving away from its religious stand. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Khanna, Indianapolis, US

 Sir ? There is evidence of growing concern in the NDA about the BJP returning to the Hindutva agenda and electing an old L.K. Advani as its president. But whom the party will choose as its president is the prerogative of its members. If old age is really the issue, then its coalition partners could take heart from the left parties, run by a slew of powerful old men.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? It seems that the BJP is convinced that it cannot go back to its winning ways without raking up the Ram mandir issue. The defeat in Maharashtra has sent shivers down the BJP spine. But will it help them realize that it is impossible to recreate the old magic with the Ram mandir issue because the youth have no interest in it any longer? 

 Yours faithfully,

Wasim Ahmed, Calcutta

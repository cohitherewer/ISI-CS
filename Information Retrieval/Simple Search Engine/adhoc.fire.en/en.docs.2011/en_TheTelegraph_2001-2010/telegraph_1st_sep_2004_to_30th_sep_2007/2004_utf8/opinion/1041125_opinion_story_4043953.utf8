 BIG BROTHER TO KEEP A WATCH

 Bhupal Sinha Chowdhury

 Late last month, the Union cabinet failed to decide on the draft Lokpal bill yet again (this was the ninth attempt since 1968), ostensibly because senior ministers like Sharad Pawar and Ram Vilas Paswan were absent from the meeting. The delay in formulating the Lokpal bill is unfortunate since it would have authorized the creation of an ombudsman-like, powerful and statutory institution, much needed in our country where corruption among public officials is widespread. 

 The envisaged Lokpal would investigate complaints of corruption against ministers, including the prime minister, secretaries and other public servants. It would also safeguard citizens from administrative injustice. 

 Several countries have experimented with such an institution to check red-tapism and to register grievances against public servants. In Sweden, Denmark and Norway, the ombudsman is chosen by parliament to which he is answerable. He has enormous powers to seize state files ? even the prime minister is accountable to him. He can take steps against judges, though he cannot reverse their decree. He makes a detailed annual report on parliamentary proceedings, citizen?s reactions and complaints against the government together with his recommendations for eliminating them. 

 Paper tiger

 In India, the idea of an ombudsman-like institution was first mooted in 1962 and received nearly full support in parliament. Later, in 1966, the administrative reforms committee examined and supported it but for some reason, it has not come into existence till today.

 An earlier draft bill had proposed that the Lokpal be appointed by the president after consultations with the chief justice. He must have the qualifications of a Supreme Court judge; he must not be a legislator or hold an office of profit or be engaged in any trade or occupation. He would have the power to investigate any administrative action taken by, or with the approval of, a minister or a secretary, on receipt of a written complaint. The bill proposed to empower the Lokpal under the Civil Procedure Code; he could ask for any document, record or examine any person, take evidence on oath and issue commissions. But the draft did not give him the power to inquire into charges against the president, vice-president, prime minister, Lok Sabha speaker, chief justice and judges of the apex court, the comptroller and auditor-general, the chief election commissioner, the chairman and members of the Union Public Service Commission.

 Need of the hour

 A strict separation of the three arms of governance ? the legislature, administration and judiciary ? is absurd and impossible in a country such as ours. Thus, many times the administration intrudes into the domain of the legislature and the judiciary. Also, many major administrative decisions are taken for political reasons, for the benefit of a particular section of people so that it may bring political rewards. Here, the rule of law and equality before law are things to be found in books only. Government servants have many special privileges and prerogatives while individuals have hardly any power to fight administrative injustice. All this underlines the need for a Lokpal. 

 It is argued that if the Lokpal comes into existence, it will clash with the principle of ministerial responsibility. Some even say that the Lokpal is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution. 

 But, constitutional bottlenecks should not be allowed to come in the way of the creation of the institution for, the Lokpal does not interfere in the functioning of the legislature or the judiciary.

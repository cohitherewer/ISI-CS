 THE PAST IS FAMILIAR COUNTRY 

TRACES OF INDIA (Mapin, $49.95) edited by Maria 

Antonella Pelizzari was published as an accompaniment to a major exhibition on 

19th century Indian architectural representations, that travelled places till 

earlier this year. Beginning with the early photography of Indian monuments, this 

interdisciplinary project looks into how the images of India served their colonial 

makers? purposes, shaped their viewers? way of seeing, and went into the making 

of the visual culture of a nation. The 1870 photograph of the casting operation 

in the Quwwat Al-Islam mosque in Delhi by Charles Shepherd shown here also contributed 

to the creation of that collective memory of the Indian past. These pictures, 

together with related selections from Indian popular culture ? posters, postcards 

to calendars and family albums ? and the rich, scholarly essays make up a rare 

collection.

 WORKING WITH THE KID GLOVES ON

 Thanks to the Congresss half-hearted secularism, the Hindu right is back with a bang, writes Jyoti Punwani

 Of all Maharashtras icons, Shivaji is the greatest, worshipped almost as a deity. And of all his many inspirational deeds perhaps the one that illustrates best the kind of ruler he was is the episode whereby he ordered his victorious soldiers to send back the daughter-in-law of the Nawab of Kalyan, her honour intact.

 As recent events have proved, Veer Savarkar is another powerful icon in Maharashtra. Heres what he had to say about this act of Shivaji: But did he (Shivaji) forget the rape of Hindu women by Muslim invaders? Those women raped by Muslim invaders must have shouted in anguish, Shivaji, dont forget the rape committed on us by the Muslim lords. You should terrorize them in such a way that they should shiver with terror as to what will happen to their women when Hindus will come to power. When they will realize that their women will also be subjected to such atrocities, then only they will stop doing these atrocities on Hindu women. (Savarkars Marathi book, Six Golden Pages from Indian History).

 In his ballad, Veer Maratha, on Baji Prabhu Deshpande, Savarkar describes the enemys head as a ball with which cricket can be played on the battlefield. In Dhananjay Keers biography of Savarkar, the latter recounts attacking a mosque when he was just 12 years old: We vandalized the mosque to our hearts content and raised the flag of our bravery on it. We followed the war strategy of Shivaji completely and ran away from the site after accomplishing our task.

 Raping Muslim women, playing cricket with Muslim skulls, vandalizing mosques all this has been done in the recent past by Savarkars followers. For the average Maharashtrian Hindu, Savarkars fight against the British may make him an icon; but for his most vocal supporters, its his policy of violent and continuous revenge against Muslims that continues to be a living inspiration.

 Yet, the Maharashtra Congress government allowed a grand procession to be taken out in his honour when a film on him was released two years ago. Now again, Congress members have criticized party colleague Mani Shankar Aiyar and come out in defence of Savarkar. Surely, there are enough academics in Sonia Gandhis and Arjun Singhs band of advisors who can highlight Savarkars poisonous beliefs which were as integral and significant a part of his life as his fight against the British. What stops the Centre from presenting Savarkar in his totality in his own words before the people?

 S imilar questions can be asked about the Uma Bharti episode. The Bharatiya Janata Party rabble-rouser deliberately violated prohibitory orders which had been clamped to control a communally-tense situation in Hubli in 1994. Her intention was as it had been in Ayodhya two years earlier, and many times before that to provoke Hindus against Muslims and inflame the situation. Indeed, as a result of her actions and those of her party, the situation did explode and five persons died in police firing. For that criminal act, she was charged.

 If she were convinced about the rightness of her conduct or her non-involvement in the violence, Uma Bharti could have fought the case. The best legal counsel was available to her. She could have made the same eloquent arguments in court that shes making now about the honour of the national flag. (Incidentally, her organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, did not think fit to raise the flag at its headquarters till just two years ago.) Instead, Uma Bharti ignored repeated court summons for 10 years, till forced to respect them now. As in the case of other Hindutva leaders, instead of treating Uma Bhartis offences with the seriousness with which they had been committed, the Congress withdrew as many cases against her as it could. Today, rather than highlight Uma Bhartis mala fides during the incident and her contempt for the law thereafter, the Congress has retreated without even trying to put up a fight.

 For a while, it seemed that Sonia Gandhis Congress wanted to pursue aggressive secularism. But that requires taking actions to their logical conclusion, anticipating the hysteria raised by the Hindutva lobby. No Congress government in 25 years has done that. Sonia Gandhis government is no exception.

 A simple yardstick can be used to judge whether the government and the state are committed to the Indian definition of secularism equal treatment of all religions. Can the minority community get away with what the majority community can? What if someone had insulted Maulana Azad? Could Muslims have taken to the streets? It is worth recalling that even when the news about Quran being burnt on the streets of Delhi by Bajrang Dal activists came out in 2001, there was no nation-wide violent fallout. Mahatma Gandhi, supposedly the nations biggest icon, has been reviled by many in all kinds of forums, but there has never been any threat of a violent agitation. Must we conclude then that the state allows Indians the freedom to insult any icon, except those revered by Hindu communalists?

 If their icons are allowed to be treated as sacrosanct, their living leaders are considered immune to the law. From Bal Thackeray to Uma Bharti, the moment the law tries to catch up with their crimes, all hell break loose. Like the Karnataka government this time, Congress governments have always stood as bystanders. If people like Imam Bukhari or Salauddin Owaisi or Abu Asim Azmi were to be arrested, would their followers be allowed to impose bandhs, block roads and threaten nationwide agitations without being arrested?

 Significantly, in the latest case filed against Thackeray (after all, elections are near), he has been named as a wanted accused in the first information report filed under the Bombay Police Act for unlawful assembly and making defamatory speeches. Thackeray was leading his mob in beating Mani Shankar Aiyars effigy with chappals the already infamous Jode Mara agitation. The last time a portrait of Thackeray was garlanded with chappals was in May 1984 in Parbhani. It became one of the immediate causes of the riots which spread to Bhiwandi and Mumbai, costing 258 lives.

 In Mumbai, the difference between the states treatment of Muslim and Hindu law-breakers was highlighted again this week. The near-defunct Muslim League wanted to counter noisy bhajan mandals in local trains by singing qawwalis. The railway police responded with a ban on both. But while the Muslim Leagues demand has been condemned even by Muslims, the mandals have been given a boost with the Shiv Sena joining them to create hell for commuters. Now the railway police denies having imposed any ban.

 It is thanks to the Centres half-hearted secularism that the Shiv Sena, which had no Hindutva issue left to go to the polls with, is back with a bang. Over the last week, a rejuvenated Thackeray has not just warned Muslims to say Vande Matram if they want to continue living in India, but has also imposed it on municipal schools.

 While the Shiv Sena newspaper Saamna, spews poison, the government remains unmoved. But this is one field in Maharashtra where both communities enjoy equal immunity. Bombs may go off in mosques, the liberal editor of Hamara Mahanagar, Sajid Rashid, may be knifed, but the government remains equally indulgent to inflammatory writings in both the Marathi and the Urdu press.

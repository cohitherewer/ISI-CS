 WIDEN THE NET

 Public debate, together with access to information, is of the essence of democracy. And the internet, committed to the freedoms of expression and access, seems to be the ideal medium for these aspects of democratic governance. Yet how many Indians capable of, and entitled to, participating in public debates that are crucial to their lives have access to the internet? Hence, the Centre?s plan of putting the draft of the riots bill on the net will look like tokenism if this is not followed up with a whole range of other attempts at generating public discussion on how to legislate sectarian violence. It is, for instance, difficult to imagine an illiterate Muslim woman in rural Uttar Pradesh or the walled city in Ahmedabad to work her way into the right website and leave her comments on the draft. Yet, this woman might have become, by now, an active member of her local panchayat or rehabilitation centre, and is therefore capable of being part of a highly self-aware discourse on communalism, and more generally, on law and order. This is only one way of looking at the limitations of the ?e-governance? approach to public debate. Civil society has to be understood in the widest possible manner in this case, and mobilizing public debate will have to involve institutions across the entire spectrum of public life.

 Any law on sectarian violence will have to confront the role of the administrative machinery during riots. Senior police officers, district magistrates, and subdivisional officers and magistrates ? these are the people, often directly answerable to their political bosses, who can either stem a riot or turn it into genocide, as they did in Gujarat. It is important to include this crucial segment of public servants, most actively, in the debates around this law. The municipal interface between the administration and the people, another definitive site of communal tension in both urban and suburban India, will also have to be engaged. A society in which inequalities of education and opportunity, and therefore of audibility, are endemic, public debate will have to be encouraged and sustained in various ways and at various levels. To be able to do that comprehensively and effectively will be the real test of the Centre?s sincerity of intentions about this law. Putting the draft on the net is only a beginning, and leaving it at that will amount to nothing more than tokenism.

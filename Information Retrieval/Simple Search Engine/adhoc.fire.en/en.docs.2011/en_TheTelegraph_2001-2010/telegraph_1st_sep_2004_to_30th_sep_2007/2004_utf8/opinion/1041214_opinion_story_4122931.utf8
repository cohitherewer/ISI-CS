 BUILDING MUTUAL FAITH 

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Peace in the subcontinent is the key to development and real growth. To achieve that we must make Saarc a body that does not permit any infiltration, of any kind, into its portals. Solidarity amongst countries in and around the subcontinent is key to solving the many problems that beset us. Kashmir ? India and Pakistan must comprehend that an unending ?peace process? is no longer valid, it merely deters war temporarily; that the two countries have to find an innovative solution with much more give than take and make this region boom. Such a boom would isolate the US from playing its divisive politics in the region. For this process to begin and move towards closure would require an overhaul of the mindset of two bureaucracies that carry many suspicions and the complex baggage of the past. 

 A ?fresh? attempt, by its very definition, implies a radical departure from past unwavering positions. It can happen today with staunch political will emanating from a leader who is not carrying the past baggage and who is willing to break new ground because he has nothing to lose at all. The majority of people on both sides of the border are desperate for a solution. Sensible initiatives will be hailed and supported. 

 First, India as the big brother must drop all visas for Pakistanis coming into India. This singular move would compel Pakistan to do the same and free access to citizens from both countries would undermine the games being played by other vested interest groups. And, let us not argue about the ?militant and terrorist risk of such a move? because those types do not need visas. Having freed the borders faith and trust between the two nations stand restored.

 Who knows best?

 Here is a hypothesis. Announce bilaterally that the LoC is acceptable to both countries as the international border. Remove both armies from shared borders. Take the risk because there is always a risk with the first step. Make the valley a free trade zone, something like the Hong Kong of the past. Both India and Pakistan should be prime beneficiaries of this status. 

 Economic autonomy. This is merely one ?wild? idea but surely there are many scenarios that can emerge if there are no parameters of past negotiations. Breakthroughs come from unadulterated ground that becomes a base for radical new thinking. If, as a start, Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf talk to each other for two days, alone, without aides, we would move out of the old paradigm. Keep both ministries out during the initial talk because they are bound to harp on the past that will never allow for a fruitful, positive, new generational change of approach.

 Neo-nationalism should not be paraded. Instead, the next ?process? should be a borderless Saarc region as one viable unit for free trade with each other, leading to active trade with the world. If the European Union has no visas between its member states, why should Saarc countries? This will rattle the US. We must capitalize on our real strength, our creative and philosophical minds, our rooted cultures, our amazing resilience and not permit the first world propaganda of poverty et al to pull us down to where they want us ? begging and cringing. 

 Why did we not support Musharraf when he recently questioned, and rightly so, the strategy and policy of the US in their ?fight against terror?? It is so limited (sounds like a fight against Islam), that it only generates more anger and therefore more potential ?terrorists?. It is that creative and historical mind that America lacks and that our ?poor? region has an abundance of, that makes for the difference in assessment and comprehension. We know better than they can what we need to do to restore peace in our neighbourhood. Let us not forget who destroyed it in the first place.

 K?S CELLAR

 - Since I am nothing but literature

 Doodles by Kafka 

Kafka By Nicholas Murray, Little, Brown, pound;15.75

?He would not become; he was,? recalled Franz Kafka?s 

first publisher, Karl Wolff, ?His first prose work knew his last, the last was 

his first.? Kafka himself often felt that he was born an old man, or, what amounts 

to the same thing, he would remain young, like Hamlet, to the end of his days. 

In spite of the ?tremendous world? inside his head, the ?events? in Kafka?s external 

life are almost humiliatingly predictable. But they are all taken up into the 

perpetual theatre of his writing: the blue octavo notebooks (he keeps a diary 

from 1910, when he was 27, until 1923, his penultimate year), the relentless love-letters 

to Felice Bauer and Milena Jesensk? (?like a continuous soft hammering?), the 

last conversation-slips after he lost his voice to the tuberculosis (?these bits 

of pills stick in the mucus like splinters of glass?), the stories, and the great 

novels, all three of them unfinished and published only after his death. 

 A terrifying father, an impossible epistolary romance, a night of fevered writing, a bout of nausea, a telephone call, an encounter with a girl, the outbreak of war ? such things ?happen? to Kafka in a curiously timeless realm of dream-like repetition and obscure causality. Here, the stuff of daily life (?the only life we have?) ? feelings, gestures, objects ? is transformed into something mythic and strange, mixing clownishness and evil, clarity and dread.

 For Borges, Xeno?s paradox against motion is the first Kafkaesque situation in literature. And this stasis at the core of Kafka?s existence ? in which writing and its darker twin, fearing, conspire in the endless postponement of the future ? must be the biographer?s nightmare. It defies notions of linear progress, demanding a form of synchronic telling that can represent the simultaneity of living, thinking, reading and writing, without entirely letting go of the axis of time. Nicholas Murray ? who has come to Kafka after two novels and biographies of Bruce Chatwin, Matthew Arnold, Andrew Marvell and Aldous Huxley ? is a quick-jobs man. Relying entirely on published ? and, one suspects, translated ? texts, occasionally checked against the originals, he structures the story of Kafka?s life on the three principal women in it ? Felice, Milena and Dora Diamant. This is done by stringing together long quotations and paraphrases from the diaries and letters, supported by singularly na?ve readings of the fiction, rootled for supporting content without any complex sense of form or genre. For instance, both ?The Judgment? and ?Letter to the Father? are read on a par, almost as unmediated confessions, without a sense of how the self-distancing, legalistic precision of Kafka?s prose transforms the actual Hermann Kafka into the P?re Imaginaire who broods over the writer?s life like a terrible dove.

 Every ?Kafkaesque? structure of feeling ? hypochondria, Angst, half-hearted Zionism, sexual recoil, sensitivity to noise, fierce introversion ? is both character and performance, suffered in life as well as played out in a tragicomic theatre of writing and doodling that is both Sophoclean and Chaplinesque. This essential element of Kafka?s modernity escapes Murray. In using the letters to Milena, he suppresses the fact that most of them are undated. So chronologically ordering them to tell a story is itself a fictive act the licence for which may be claimed only by the best of writers. Elias Canetti?s Kafka?s Other Trial is a memorable instance, a long and detailed unravelling of the letters to Felice.

 The only moments in Murray?s biography that convey the sense of a particular life are when he quotes Canetti, just as his evocation of Kafka?s historical milieu, particularly the culture of the Prague Jewry in the dusk of the Habsburg Empire, seldom rises above touristic impressionism. Murray also has little sense of how Kafka?s greatness stood in relation to that of his contemporaries ? the work of Freud, Rilke, Mann and Brecht, the art of Paul Klee and the music of that other great Bohemian Jew (though eventually apostate), Gustav Mahler. Nor does Murray address, in any depth, the living presence of certain books in Kafka?s imagination (Flaubert?s L??ducation sentimentale, Kleist?s Michael Kohlhaas), and the role of his ?blood relations?, Dostoevsky, Grillparzer, Kierke- gaard and Dickens.

 Kafka lived out the insistent ?nothingness? of his self in what he often describes as the thinnest, and possibly the sickest, body he ever knew. He associates this body with the brittleness and flatness of the paper ?into the depths? of which he wrote. And the paradox of this depth-in-flatness is the key to his absurdist, self-absenting presence. The ?senselessly empty? self becomes something substantial only through writing and reading, ?since I am nothing but literature?. But the nothing-self is double-edged. It exists as a masochistically experienced worthlessness when lived out in relation to the Father?s overwhelming menace. But it is anxiously affirmed when threatened with dissolution in sex and its bourgeois aftermath: ?through marriage, through the union, through the dissolution of this nothingness that I am, I shall perish, and not alone but with my wife, and that the more I love her the swifter and more terrible it will be?. This is the language of the Romantic Liebestod turned inside out. Kafka is here a modernist anti-Tristan, turning the highest forms of yearning and bliss in the Germanic Great Tradition into nausea and nightmare.

 And this is why being terminally ill is crucial. Diseased lungs and writing collude in sustaining the integrity and asceticism of the nothing-self ? as Milena, Kafka?s Czech translator and most intelligent lover, profoundly understood. ?He was a man who let his illness bear the whole burden of his fear of life,? she wrote in an extraordinary obituary, ?he deliberately cultivated it and encouraged it psychologically.? Kafka himself saw it as ?the universal human weakness?, which he ?vigorously absorbed? from the age in which he lived. In this, Kafka belongs, with Beethoven, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky and Proust, to the pantheon of the incurabili ? compulsive anatomists of their own melancholy, for whom the ordinary notions of health and recovery were an absurd and obscene conspiracy against their own election into suffering and dis-ease. 

 It is his illness that keeps Kafka ?unhoused?, preserving that wakeful anguish of the soul which alone makes writing possible: ?This is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes, why even night is not night enough?The best mode of life for me would be to sit in the innermost room of a spacious locked cellar with my writing things and a lamp. Food would be brought and always put down far away from my room, outside the cellar?s outermost door.? For Milena, Kafka?s ?knowledge of the world was vast and deep. He himself was a vast and deep world.? But she also understood, more privately than in an obituary, that this vastness and these depths would eventually lock her out.

 OLD PARTY

 Failure seldom makes a virtue of tolerance. Mr M. Venkaiah Naidu has only himself to blame if he did not expect to be sacked by the Bharatiya Janata Party after it lost the Maharashtra polls. It was under his leadership that the BJP lost the elections to the Lok Sabha and to the Maharashtra legislative assembly. He has to carry the can as the head of the BJP. The baton of leadership passes to the old war-horse, Mr L.K. Advani, who many believe raised the morale and the fortunes of the party in the late Eighties. This change of leadership is, in many ways, a cosmetic change as it will not, in any way, resolve the fundamental problems facing the BJP. The very choice of Mr Advani is indicative of one of the problems. From its inception, the BJP has been led by two stars: Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mr Advani. Most observers have commented on the tension-ridden relationship between these two leaders and have thus ignored the more serious problem relating to the absence of able second-rung leadership with mass appeal. With age catching up on Messrs Vajpayee and Advani, the BJP faces a looming crisis of leadership. This crisis may not be immediate, but it cannot be wished away by those who have a stake in the future of the BJP.

 The BJP is also a party without an agenda. A stint in power ironed out the extremist edges of the BJP. It has now become a part of mainstream Indian politics, which emphasizes the centrality of governance. The cry of Hindutva is a discordant one raised by the likes of Mr Narendra Modi. It is significant that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the sangh parivar?s extremist fringe, was disappointed by Mr Advani?s elevation as party chief. It was the BJP?s boast, before it came to power, that it was the only genuinely nationalist party in India. It has lost this ultra-nationalist sheen because, as the ruling party, it followed a line in foreign policy which was not really very gung-ho about India?s national interest. Under Mr Vajpayee, India flew in the international firmament as a dove rather than as a hawk. The BJP thus faces not only an image problem but also the task of reinventing itself. Unfortunately for the BJP, it has no leader to quite meet these challenges. Old men can only see their own wrinkles in the mirror. They cannot mould the future ? instead, they see their own past beckon to them.

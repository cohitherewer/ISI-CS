 IN HOUSE

 A well-known truth may seem quite shocking when it bursts into the open. The role the Communist Party of India (Marxist) local leaders played in a landlord-tenant clash in Gorakshabashi Road recently is not a new one: it is exactly the kind of thing local leaders of the party specialize in everywhere they have a presence. Intervention in civil and domestic disputes by local CPI(M) leaders has for long been a matter of course. They have succeeded in making most citizens forget that the state has been good enough to provide appropriate redressal machinery. No wonder it came as an unpleasant surprise to the CPI(M) local committee when Mr Shubhrakanti Dhar decided to go straight to court when he had a complaint against his landlord. The landlord himself had taken his grievance quite properly, the local CPI(M) would no doubt have thought to the Nagarik Committee. In real life, as it is lived in party-dominated areas such as Gorakshabashi Road in Dumdum, the difference between the Nagarik Committee and the CPI(M) local committee is decorative. It was Mr Dhars refusal to attend a discussion to be conducted by the local leaders that prompted them to shoot off a threatening letter to him. 

 What is truly shocking is that the CPI(M) men sent copies of the letter to the local police station and the district police as well. The police stood by quietly, accepting, as ordinary citizens tend to do, the unquestioned domination of the party. The courts decision to make the two party leaders concerned apologize has exposed a long-accepted abuse of power. Even the party high command is making embarrassed noises, especially since it had earlier instructed its members not to get involved in local civil disputes. The moral is straightforward. It takes just one courageous individual, or family, to do things by the book, even when under threat. That is enough to break the stranglehold of local leaders on helpless citizens.

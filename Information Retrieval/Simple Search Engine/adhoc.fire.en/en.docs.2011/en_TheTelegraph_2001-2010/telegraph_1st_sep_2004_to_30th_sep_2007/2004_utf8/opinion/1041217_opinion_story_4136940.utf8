 DEAD BREATHERS

 These are dangerous times for Calcutta. The state government seems to be getting away now with sustaining fatal, prolonged and collective bodily harm to its citizens with a brazenness that can only be described as criminal. The saga of air pollution control in the state is a shocking and sordid one. It exposes the state?s political leadership as inept and inhuman. It reduces the authority of the courts to ineffectual activism. And it shows up the Left Front?s populism as the most pernicious thing to have happened to the people of West Bengal over the last three decades. Calcutta?s legendary killer-air reaches new levels of deadliness in winter. So this is perhaps the best season for rehearsing the rapidly worsening pollution statistics. Since 1999, the state government has been staging, with astonishing success, a step-by-step evasion of the court?s orders. First, shifting grounds from alternative fuel standards to BS-II engines, then from these to tailpipe emission standards, and now from tailpipe emission to fuel quality. The focus has therefore shifted from the conduct of the government to that of the oil companies. This immediately absolves the chief minister and the transport minister of all accountability in the matter.

 The medical statistics regarding the rise of respiratory illnesses and fatalities are evidence of the direct human cost of this apathy. But the entire phenomenon has larger moral and political consequences for the state. When ordinary citizens are reduced, as they have been in West Bengal, to passively suffering the wrongs done to their bodies by the government, then something is rather hideously wrong with the practice of democracy in the state. And this sense cannot remain confined to Calcutta, or even to the government?s unabashed failure to control air pollution. The brutality of the government towards its citizen?s bodies is also directly indicated by the state of Bengal?s health sector ? in Calcutta?s government hospitals, and in the districts and villages. Together, this adds up to a picture of civic indifference and political apathy whose fundamental immorality ought to outrage any civilized society. Yet, the chief minister?s public profile is now identified with such buzzwords as culture, investments and the new work ethic. The inability to see through this ruse and not hold the government accountable for such an order of crime speaks of a sickness that is not confined simply to the lungs.

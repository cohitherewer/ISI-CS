 Letters to Editor

 Business of politics

 Sir The report, Another CM son eyes House club (Aug 30), throws light on two cardinal truths about Indian politics. One, that politics is the most successful business a family can wish to have (and the Reddys are no different). Which is why even the most prosperous business families often choose to be politically inclined. Witness the Ambanis. The rules of business are also no different here. Hence there is little to be surprised about a younger member of the family like the Andhra chief ministers son trying to enter the business early. As the report indicated, elsewhere several others like him are already in it. The second feature is self-sacrifice, and the present political dispensation seems to have mastered this art. If the matriarch of the Nehru-Gandhi family can do her bit (ultimately) for the scions of her family, so can an uncle for a politically-inclined nephew. 

 Yours faithfully,

T. Chakravorty, Calcutta

 Little glory, greater shame

 Sir The Olympics is over, and it has been a flop show for India. The outcome was clear the day Aishwarya Rai and Aamir Khan were seen running with the Olympic torch along with a host of Bollywood superstars and only a handful of the countrys sportsmen. Why did the sports ministry not send the filmstars to Athens? What can we expect from a country which uses its national stadiums more for entertainment events and concerts than for international-level sporting events? Does anybody care whether the athletes, who are being showered with brickbats now, get a square meal a day when they are not competing in the Olympic games? If countries like Colombia and Ethiopia, economically far worse off than India, can produce medal winners, why cant India? Simply because we Indians are not ready yet to support and promote the cause of sports. 

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir This refers to the report quot;Sham stains silver success quot; in this morningâ€™s edition of your esteemed daily. In my opinion, not many Indians would like to see their contingent coming back from the Olympics with just a couple medals but No Indian would like to accept their athletes being tested positive for drugs. Testing positive for drugs is hardly the kind of distinction that one would like to bring back from the Olympics (Shame stains silver success, Aug 20). But the performance-enhancing drugs that Indian lifters, Pratima Kumari and Sanamacha Chanu, are alleged to have consumed must be of very poor quality. They could not even ensure bronze medals for the two. I shudder to imagine where these athletes would have ended on the ranking ladder without the pills. It is not enough to sack coaches and claim innocence. The blatant sports tourism that we see in India in the name of sending squads to international events must stop. We as Indians do not mind losing with our self respect intact but certainly hate being humiliated in front of the world and that too, in an event like the Olympics. The people committing these dastardly acts and those who are responsible must be given examplary punishment so that it acts as a deterrent for others 

 Yours faithfully,

Nisheeth Bijawat, Calcutta

 Sir It is wrong to think, as many newspapers including The Telegraph are thinking, that Norman Gilbert Pritchard was a British citizen who was merely passing through India when he participated in the 1900 Paris Olympics and won two silver medals. In fact, Pritchard was born in Alipore, Calcutta on June 23, 1875 and was baptized on January 28, 1883. His parents, George Peteron Pritchard and Helen Maynard Pritchard, were indeed British. Pritchard, however, studied in St Xaviers school and was a leading footballer and football administrator in India before he moved to Britain and then to the United States of America, where he pursued a successful career in Broadway and Hollywood, changing his name to Norman Trevor. 

 It is still in dispute whether he was representing India or Britain when he won the silvers in Paris. But Calcuttans can take pride in the fact that he was born in their city. Pritchard/Trevor died in California on October 30, 1929. 

 Yours faithfully,

Gulu Ezekiel, New Delhi

 Sir I was shocked at the way the media created a hype around Anju Bobby Georges medal prospects at Athens quite an apparent impossibility. People like me were forced to keep their apprehensions to themselves, lest they be called unpatriotic. All of us, the media most of all, were well aware that the three Russians in the fray, and the USs Marion Jones, were regularly jumping 7 metres, while Anjus personal best was well short of that mark, and at least half-a-metre behind the best jumps of the rest. It was almost nave to think that in the finals, all these four girls would perform incomprehensibly below par and Anju would better her personal best by a huge margin to catch up or even beat them to a medal. We can take heart from the fact that our medal hope did not give up without a fight, and even improved her personal best. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sankar Majumdar, Guwahati

 Sir Anju Bobby George is capable of doing better than she did last Friday. There are at least two errors in her jump. One, she must fall forwards, not backwards. Second, during her jump, she must keep her hands and feet together. With sustained coaching from experts abroad, she can bring India greater glory.

 Yours faithfully,

Geraldine H., Mumbai 

 Sir What is the use of writing long articles and conducting even longer debates about Indias performance in Athens if we are going to forget it in no time? The people who need to be hauled up will go scot-free and get back to what they do best make money in the name of improving sports. The shorter our collective memory, the easier it is for our babus and netas to fill their coffers.

 Yours faithfully,

Leena Sharma, Siliguri

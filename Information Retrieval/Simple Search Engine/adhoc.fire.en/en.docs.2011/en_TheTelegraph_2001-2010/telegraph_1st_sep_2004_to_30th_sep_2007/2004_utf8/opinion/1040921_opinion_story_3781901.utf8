 FIGURING BADLY 

 No tale is complete without a twist or two at the end. For the tale of population control in India, the twists are all to be found in the census report for 1991-2001 that was released recently. The report has provided extensive data based on the growth rate of various religious communities, and these have helped to isolate the different factors ? economic, regional and social ? that have caused a fall or rise in the figures for each group. The figures for some minority communities show the other side of population control, especially in the case of the Sikhs and Parsis, who have registered a sharp decline in numbers. The Sikh growth rate has dropped from 24.3 per cent in 1981-91 to 18.2 per cent in 1991-2001. This has so alarmed the community heads that the Akal Takht is thinking of issuing an order to the community to stop practising contraception. Apart from fewer children, sociologists feel that migration out of the country of a greater number of Sikhs nowadays could be a reason for the drop, while in Punjab, the increased inflow of non-Sikh labourers may be having an effect on the percentage of Sikh population.

 But a reduced birth rate is central to the problem. What is most alarming is that even with an earlier edict issued by the Akal Takht banning female foeticide, the sex ratio among the Sikhs has not improved. It is a sad irony that even when a community is blessed with a highly aware religious leadership and a culture of deep regard for women, it should show male bias. India?s sex ratio is now 933 women for 1,000 men, worse than Pakistan and Bangladesh. But the Sikhs as a community have shown a sex ratio of 893, and Punjab as a state has registered a figure of 882. But the showing in the 0-6 age group is worse. The Sikh community?s national average here is 786, in Punjab it is 780, and in Haryana and Delhi, the figures are 742 and 796 respectively. It is no wonder that the leaders of the community are alarmed and also feel ?ashamed? that the edict banning female foeticide has obviously been ignored by people of the faith. This is part explanation too, of the declining growth rate. Trying to discard half the human race is hardly a wise move. And Punjab?s overall sex ratio suggests that female foeticide is common among other communities in the state too. Only the immediate danger is greater for the Sikhs because their population is already showing a noticeable decline.

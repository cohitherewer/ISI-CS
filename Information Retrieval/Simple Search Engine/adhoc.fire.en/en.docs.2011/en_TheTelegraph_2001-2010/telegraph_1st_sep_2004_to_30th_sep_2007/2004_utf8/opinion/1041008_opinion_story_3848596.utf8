 TO BEGIN WITH A BANG

 Neha Sahay

 Sarkari holidays are nice, but traditional folk holidays are better. This seems to be the feeling here as major holidays come close on the heels of each other. On September 28, China celebrated its mid-autumn festival; and October 1 saw the start of the National Day holiday week.

 Like Diwali, the mid-autumn festival, which originated as a harvest festival, must be celebrated with its own special delicacy. Since it always falls on the full moon day, its speciality is the moon cake. Made from fillings of nuts, mashed red bean and lotus-seed paste or dates, all wrapped in a pastry, sometimes with a cooked egg yolk in the middle, this delicacy now has a fresh-fruit filling. 

 The price varies from six yuan a piece, to 1,000 yuan a pack. Diamond-studded packs come with a bottle of Bordeaux wine or high quality ginseng. Days after the festival is over, most Chinese end up having to eat moon cakes for breakfast, lunch and dinner, in order to finish the large stocks piled up.

 Family ties

 Family reunions under the full moon have been the tradition ? they still are. In coastal south China, the rich Chinese cruise down the Pearl River in brightly-lit barges or watch pop performances on the beach. The average family parks itself on the lawns lining the sea-front, and after picnicking till past midnight, stretches out and goes to sleep there itself. It?s like a peaceful mela: they fly kites, ride four-seater cycles, play the guitar, or lie down to gaze at the moon? All this is a far cry from the activities around the theme of ?Blessing the beloved motherland?, as on this year?s National Day.

 The government decided to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the republic with flowers; a few years back, military showmanship was the theme. Interestingly, this year an Indian army team crossed over to Tibet to celebrate the day, reciprocating a gesture by the Chinese army on August 15.

 National Day festivities are Beijing-centred. Mid-autumn festivities take place in every home, yet the festival does not occasion a holiday. The Chinese New Year or the spring festival is the only traditional festival for which there are extended holidays. Otherwise, the two major holidays are Labour Day and National Day.

 To boost consumer spending, the government, since the last five years, has decided that the weeks beginning May 1 and October 1 would be ?Golden? holiday weeks. Like the New Year, these are now marked by high-priced travel and shopping.

 Old is gold

 However, defying this trend, this year a Beijing restaurant offered a replica of the historic Beijing Hotel banquet, which marked the founding of the People?s Republic of China on October 1, 1949. The ?state banquet?, which included eight cold and six hot courses, cost 600 yuan and served 10 people. More than 10 tables had been booked a week before the National Day.

 For the government, every holiday or festival is an opportunity to boost the economy. Before the mid-autumn festival, newspapers reported that Guangzhou?s restaurants had sold 12 per cent more moon cake packs than last year. Before and after every ?Golden week?, the government declared how many million yuans are expected to be spent.

 This year, the Guangzhou Municipal Tourist Bureau predicted that, in Guangzhou, an average of 1,556 yuan would be spent by every household on travel. 

 Despite its frantic modernization and Westernization, more and more Chinese want a day off for the mid-autumn festival. Many middle-aged Chinese may be worried about the youngsters? increasing celebration of Valentine?s Day and X?Mas Day. But even the young Chinese now feel that ?new? holidays are good, but old festivals are better.

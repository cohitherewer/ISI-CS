 MANY FACES OF ADVERSITY

 Ordinary sorrows

FRAGMENTS OF GRACE

By Pamela Constable,

HarperCollins, Rs 495

Some books are difficult to shove into a particular 

category. Fragments of Grace is one such. It is a travelogue, political 

history and memoir of a foreign correspondent, all rolled into one. Written in 

impassioned prose, it is subjective enough to raise the eyebrows of those who 

consider talking about one?s own self in public to be in bad taste.

 Pamela Constable is the foreign correspondent for the Washington Post and has been writing on south Asia for almost a decade. She is still based in Kabul, Afghanistan, where this book was conceived in 2001. Four of her colleagues were shot dead on the highway while they were travelling through the war-torn country. Constable managed to escape with her life. 

 It can be assumed that the stories she sends for her readers across the Atlantic are objective and detached. Not bound by her journalistic compulsions in this book, she writes subjectively, digressing at will, flitting from south Asia to her hometown in Connecticut, from Islam to Hinduism to Buddhism to Christianity. 

 Fragments of Grace ? the name is borrowed from a song by the Guatemalan songwriter, Ricardo Arjona ? is divided into nine chapters, all about Constable?s sojourn in the troubled spots of south Asia, from Kashmir to Sri Lanka to Afghanistan. But the largest parts are devoted to her stay in Afghanistan in the taliban and post-taliban era. The reader gets a fair idea of the excesses committed during the taliban regime and the difference of those times with the period after the American forces had installed a new government. Constable does not make a secret of her opinion that conditions did not improve greatly after the war, nor is it likely to after the recent elections.

 Fragments of Grace documents the turmoil and mayhem in south Asia, but also provides a glimpse of the lives of ordinary individuals in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka. But through it all, Constable remains an outsider for whom the religious, cultural and social life of this part of the world is unintelligible, hard, backward, dull and dirty. Let alone Afghanistan, even New Delhi is for Constable ?sweltering...full of wheedling beggars and haughty clerks and gloppy food and infuriating traffic?. But that does not prevent her from realizing and depicting the tremendous potential of the people amidst unthinkable squalor and sordidness. These are the fragments of grace that the book is made of. 

 On the one hand, we have stories of individuals struggling against the system, while on the other, there is the private world of the author. When writing about herself, Constable?s tone becomes wistful. There seems to be an element of regret for not getting a chance to experience conjugal life with husband and children. 

 Like a modern novelist, Constable manages to extract a universal meaning out of stories bound in space and time. Whether one concurs with her views on the people, culture and cities of south Asia, or admires her style of writing, most will agree that once begun, Fragments of Grace is a book difficult to put aside.

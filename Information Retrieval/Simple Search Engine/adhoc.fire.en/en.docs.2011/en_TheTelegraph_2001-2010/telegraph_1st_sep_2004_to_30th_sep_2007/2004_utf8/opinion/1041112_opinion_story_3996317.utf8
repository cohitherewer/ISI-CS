 Letters to Editor

 Angry young man

 Sir ? Rahul Gandhi seems to like courting danger, and wades into waters that experienced politicians would steer clear of (?Ram sermon for BJP, bahu barb for Sena?, Nov 10). He muddied the waters in Uttar Pradesh soon after becoming a member of the Lok Sabha by saying that the Samajwadi Party was misgoverning the state. Then he joined battle with Jaya Bachchan for her comment that the Nehru-Gandhis had ?betrayed? her husband. And now he is trying to tell the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena what they should do. It seems that the Congress is using Gandhi as its first line of attack, with senior leaders and mum joining in or retracting if the going gets too hot. While it is good to see the heir apparent to the Congress empire not disown his Columbian girlfriend in public, Gandhi perhaps needs to be told that discretion is an useful weapon in a politician?s armour.

 Yours faithfully,

Jamini Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Postal blues

 Sir ? In ?Running the dawk? (Oct 27), Bibek Debroy highlights the problems of the Indian postal department quite well. Our country?s postal department is governed by arcane laws ? some of them dating back to the last century. As a result, they have failed to keep pace with the changing times, especially now when consumer demands drive the economy. The postal department is reported to be running up losses of about Rs 1,500 crore a year. But the government does not seem to have any plans of restructuring the postal department. Or why does it not allow post offices to sell stationery goods, as Debroy suggests? Poor postal services has forced consumers to switch to courier companies, whose operations are not hampered by political interference. The popularity of private couriers may be checked if postal services are improved and made customer-friendly. One can also allow private sector participation in this sector. Restructuring salaries, enhancing mobile postal services and organizing workshops to raise awareness about postal services would help the department find its feet. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? Bibek Debroy?s article should provide food for thought for politicians and citizens alike. The days of dawk-runners are over. But if the government does not improve postal services, our post offices are destined for a similar fate. If the penetration of the postal department and the dependence of citizens on postal saving schemes are anything to go by, corporatizing the department will surely be in the larger interest of consumers. It will not only restore investors? confidence but also counter competition from the courier agencies. Post offices should also offer new products and services. This would not only generate revenues for the government and the postal department but it would also ensure that citizens are the largest beneficiary of this public sector department.

 Yours faithfully,

Better or worse 

Sir ? It was with some frustration that I read the patronizing remarks of J.M. 

Lyngdoh and M.S. Gill about the American elections (?Experts stick Bihar label 

on elections made in America?, Nov 5). In terms of quality, the service that the 

Election Commission, which they once headed, provides to Indian citizens, is far 

inferior to that similar agencies provide in the West. In spite of widespread 

voter fraud in many states in India, the two chief election commissioners did 

not issue provisional ballots. Absentee ballots do not exist. In fact, voter registration 

is so inflexible that if a new voter is out of the country during the crucial 

(but relatively short) registration period, he loses the right to vote, as happened 

to me. 

The CECs despise the diversity in the American electoral system without realizing that it is the result of states in the US being free to organize their elections without being beholden to a federal agency. The electoral system in that country has thus evolved from the bottom up, it has not been imposed top-down. In India, on the other hand, states? rights have long been brushed under the carpet. 

Yours faithfully,

Prasenjeet Dutta, Chennai 

 Sir ? The difference between the world?s two largest democracies cannot have been starker. While there was record voting in the US this year, in India, there has been a sharp decline in the numbers exercising the franchise. Also, Americans can register and cast their votes on the same day. But in India, many voters are turned back because their names do not feature in the voters? list despite their having voter identity cards.

Yours faithfully,

Diana Sahu, Cuttack

 Sir ? M.S. Gill seems not to know of the voting machines in Florida which were so newfangled that no one quite knew how to operate them. Apparently, they could also be rigged ahead of time. It is good that India too has introduced electronic voting machines: they are excellent for obtaining kickbacks. Where I live, we still vote on paper using a pencil ? and know the results within hours. The advantages of having a small population for sure ? but ours is a far more far-flung and tactically difficult terrain than the US or India.

Yours faithfully,

Shyamal Bagchee, Edmonton, Canada

 SOME LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL

 Despite being perceived as a failure, Orissa?s power sector reforms hold possibilities for the Centre and other states, writes Anabel Loyd

 Tangled mess

 One of the most important challenges facing India today is the upgrading of its infrastructure and, in particular, ensuring that power is available at the levels needed for a country growing in excess of 6 per cent a year. An essential element of this is likely to be the introduction of private capital into the system. The experience of Orissa, the first state to attempt these reforms, is worthy of study in some detail.

 The electricity reform and privatization process in Orissa, initiated at Jaipur in 1993, has been widely criticized for its failures of both conception and implementation. Consultants were abandoned to the political upheavals in the state and expected to fulfil a role outside their remit. The difficulties of reform, leading to a loss of interest among investors and donors, initially left stakeholders with additional problems.

 Accumulated debt in the system was not dealt with prior to privatization so that the newly privatized companies started with unsustainably high losses, leading to unacceptably high tariffs. The World Bank and other donors, the state government and the Centre have been blamed for the failure, but the true story is less clear. The intentions of many of the individuals involved were to benefit stakeholders and create much needed growth in a desperately poor region. These individuals have received little recognition. A longer historical perspective is required for a final measure of the Orissa reforms, in terms of its effects on the state and as the pioneer of power sector reforms in the country.

 The perception of outsiders about the wholesale failure of the Orissa reforms is both inaccurate and unfair to those involved. Stakeholders in Orissa determinedly take a positive view of the power sector reforms in both service and governance, and dispute the cold calculations of economists and external commentators. 

 The World Bank has been criticized for attempting the privatization in Orissa along Thatcherite lines in the United Kingdom. Such criticism, of the application of a model involving a well-invested network and the reliable foundations for sale and privatization in the UK, to an indebted network with no viable commercial framework to compensate the investor, is not unreasonable. It may be asked whether Orissa was ready for privatization. The Bank had few alternatives for reducing the deficit in the electricity sector, introducing professional management and practice, and reducing government involvement, political interference and corruption, other than privatization. 

 Its mistake was in rushing the process in the face of unreliable data and political shilly-shallying. Much of the intellectual input of consultants and civil servants was wasted for want of political determination and decision-making, both in the state and the Centre. 

 The restructuring of the power sector was successful in Orissa and the future is being built on that. But the privatization bid failed due to unstable economic foundations and the lack of decisions in the politically sensitive areas of debt, subsidies and tariff.

 The successes and failures of the Orissa reforms have had important spin-offs in understanding and modelling reforms in other states. Today, everyone is talking about power reforms and those who once opposed change present themselves as reformers and are critical of the slow progress in the pioneering state. 

 In Orissa, privatization was given a human face. There was and is little public opposition to it; employees? issues have been and are being addressed; and good governance and civil society participation have been strengthened by the new institutions put in place. Donors and consultants emphasized the importance of involving domestic companies rather than trans-nationals in acquiring distribution companies. Although it has led to problems, they have stressed that problems would be resolved under Indian rather than international control even when further inputs from donors needs to be sought. Village electricity schemes are proving successful although major questions remain over the financing of rural electrification. 

 Continued misinformation, poor data and confused perceptions have blurred the image of economic reforms in India today. Orissa has been buffeted and bruised by the reforms, without much support from the Central government. If the progress made in the face of highly adverse conditions is to be consolidated, the present government needs to act.

 A lot of hope has been pinned on the Electricity Act 2003 for better regulating and creating efficiency in the power sector. It is an improvement on earlier laws, although nearly three years of discussions and eight or more drafts have somewhat reduced it from its original form. Observers are less concerned about the contents of the law than they are about its chances of implementation. The underlying object of the act is to open the electricity sector to competition. But it also compels improvements in the financial viability of state electricity boards and clarifies penalties and provisions for the policing of misappropriation and theft. The new legislation securitizes past debts to clean the balance sheets of SEBs and incentivizes the Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme.

 But the establishment of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission may be a retrograde step, renewing institutional centralization and reducing the autonomy of state regulators. The CERC has increased powers commensurate with a reduction in the powers of state electricity commissions. It also has new functions enabling national coordination on open access, generation, transmission, tariffs and trading. Theoretically, country-wide improved coordination may be good for the power sector, but it is not hard to see the potential for problems of increased centralization, related to the size and diversity of India. 

 Accountability, transparency and participatory relationships with consumers have grown in spite of the vicissitudes of the Orissa reforms experience, as has ownership of the stakeholders through rural schemes. In this sense, Orissa exemplifies possibilities for other states. Nevertheless, issues regarding officers of regulatory commissions and the lack of clarity regarding their autonomy and power need to be clarified. Policies that reduce, rather than improve and reinforce the role of state electricity regulatory commissions in favour of more sweeping national policies, might equally reduce the scope of success. The new Central act addresses many issues thrashed out through trial and error in Orissa but it should not be seen as the last word on the electricity sector and its future. But, its review, under the national common minimum programme, may seek to resolve some of the outstanding issues.

 The poor have demonstrated that they are not prepared to wait for the trickle-down effect of the economic reforms, and the government needs to look to the needs of the constituency which brought it to power. These may be achieved through a better process of participation and negotiations, but not by putting a full stop to reforms. Indeed, with the reins of governance in the hands of politicians who are among the best known reforms-minded economists in India, it seems likely that the focus will be on removing obstacles to public and private investment. Such investment is essential for building infrastructure, creating education and health capacity, and accelerating the rural development necessary to reduce poverty. 

 The people of Orissa suffered from the mistakes made at the outset of the reforms due to the obfuscation and the covering up of their tracks on the part of officials and politicians, and the resultant confused understanding of realities on the part of donors. 

 A comparison of the pre-reform assumptions with the post-reform realities shows transmission and distribution losses of 50 per cent for the financial year 1996-97, as opposed to the estimated 39 per cent losses on which the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission passed a tariff order. The World Bank assumed an initial load growth of 11.4 per cent in 1998, when recession led to a decrease of 7 per cent in unsubsidized growth and an increase of 65 per cent in subsidized growth. Collection rates were anticipated at 100 per cent; and average tariff increases at 11.01 per cent over seven years. The former goal has not been achieved, while the latter has been allowed by the OERC at 5.45 per cent per year. No transition funding for the sector was allowed by, or received from, the government. 

 Other states have learnt from this to provide interim support. Representatives of the donors and consultants today feel that both they and the people of Orissa were dealt a losing hand. In spite of recent achievements, they remain anxious about the social and economic future of Orissa, and the sidelining of the reforms there to the margins of economic history.

 Owing to successful hydro-power generation, power exports to other states have generated revenues of Rs 740 crore for the Grid Company between September 2003 and June 2004, significantly improving cash flow. Billing and collection rates are rising; transmission and distribution losses are falling and pilot village electricity schemes are being seen as the precursor of future growth in villages.

 The final calculation of the effects of the reforms cannot and should not be made yet. Much of the perception of success or failure remains in the eye of the beholder. It is not clear how privatization, as an economic modus operandi, will be judged by history. The imperative of economic efficiency may be socially deleterious, whereas privatization with a human face may not achieve the streamlining necessary for growth and future development.

 Nevertheless the best interests of the power sector and the people of Orissa probably lie in private investments and the introduction of genuine competition into electricity generation and distribution. It further lies in strengthening civil society, giving the marginalized a voice and removing the corruption at the root of the problems in the country-wide service network.

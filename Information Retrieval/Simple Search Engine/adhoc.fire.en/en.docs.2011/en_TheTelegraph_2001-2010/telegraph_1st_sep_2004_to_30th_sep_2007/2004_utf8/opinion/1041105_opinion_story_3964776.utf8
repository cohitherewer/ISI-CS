 DIVIDED EMPIRE

 The quirkiness of Ohio?s electoral laws may have delayed President George W. Bush?s victory speech on Wednesday, but it cannot detract from his conclusive, but narrow, win in the American election. In what was a passionate and savagely contested election, Mr Bush won a clear majority of the popular vote. At the same time, the election has exposed the sharp social and ideological schisms within the United States of America; it has divided the world?s most formidable nation into two potentially antagonistic blocs. Those who rallied behind the president?s Democratic Party challenger were primarily motivated by a visceral antipathy to everything he stood for. Such an intense polarization may have been a natural consequence of Mr Bush?s forthright positions on the war on terrorism and the conflict in Iraq, but its continuation into his second term is undesirable. More than anything else, America needs harmony and reconciliation. Mr Bush needs to iron out the rough edges of his first administration.

 The task is not going to be easy. The staggering counter-mobilization of a silent majority against Senator John Kerry?s challenge was not effected by the personality of the president. It was managed by ideologically-committed networks of evangelists, conservatives and neo-conservatives. Bolstered by Republican majorities in Congress, there will be sustained pressure on the second Bush administration to deviate from consensual politics. It would be imprudent of the president to succumb totally. Tempting as the idea of a Bush Revolution is, America?s immediate priority is to rebuild a national consensus and restore its moral standing in the world. An exaggerated unilateralism in the conduct of foreign policy has enhanced the image of the Ugly American and given a fillip to both terrorists and faith-inspired radicals. Indeed, it has been responsible for the mess the US finds itself in Iraq. Rather than treat re-election as a vindication of pig-headedness, the new Bush administration has to focus on the delicate task of managing an orderly retreat. Well-meaning pipedreams of reordering west Asia for democracy may have to be shelved for a more opportune occasion.

 An advantage Mr Bush has is that a second-term president can afford the political luxury of statesmanship. He may be unwaveringly committed to Christian ethics in matters like abortion, gay marriage and stem-cell research. However, when it comes to political and economic issues, his instincts are those of a right-wing pragmatist. This has served India well. He resisted pressures to be protectionist over outsourcing and discarded non-proliferation for a quiet acknowledgement of India?s nuclear status. His kid-glove handling of Pakistan may have reeked of double-standards, but has yielded dividends in the war on terrorism. Reverting to traditional, Republican pragmatism ? hallmarks of his father?s administration ? may be the way to make Uncle Sam less contentious and, by implication, more secure. The last thing the US needs now is more enemies.

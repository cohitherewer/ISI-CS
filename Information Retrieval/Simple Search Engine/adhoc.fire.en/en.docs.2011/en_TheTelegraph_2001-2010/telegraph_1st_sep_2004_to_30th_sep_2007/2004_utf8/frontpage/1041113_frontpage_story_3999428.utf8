 LoC troop pullback

 New Delhi, Nov. 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s instructions to reduce troops in Jammu and Kashmir will result in a thinning of military presence both along the LoC and in the internal security grid, sources said today.

 But the number of personnel to be withdrawn from Kashmir is yet to be worked out. 

 ?The Prime Minister has directed withdrawal of troops. The details of how much reduction (would be made) in which sector are details being worked out,? the defence minister said. Commanders at the army headquarters and in the state will prepare a roadmap and schedule of withdrawal.

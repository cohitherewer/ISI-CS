 Uma free, party in a fix

 Hubli/New Delhi, Sept. 6: Uma Bharti stepped out of jail today with a new weapon in her fiery repertory of words but left her party wondering whether to press ahead with the tiranga yatra and how to engage her purposefully.

 Sources said the Tricolour rally she had set her heart on could be deferred on the plea that the BJP organisation is completely involved with next months Maharashtra elections, but admitted there were no easy answers to what she is expected to do.

While former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has 

denied that Uma would take over the party, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu has ruled 

out her return as Madhya Pradesh chief minister. Uma, too, has said she would 

not return to head the government in the state.

In Karnataka, soon after her release, Uma said a new 

thinking on nationalism has arrived. She made it clear she would target Congress 

chief Sonia Gandhi on nationalism and communalism.

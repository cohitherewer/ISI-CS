 Picnickers die in Malaysia

 Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 26 (Reuters): At least 28 people were killed and dozens missing and feared drowned after a tsunami triggered by a huge earthquake struck Malaysia?s northern coast today. 

 Most of those killed were swept out to sea as they picnicked at the Batu Ferringhi beach on the resort island of Penang. Officials said dozens more were missing from a fishing village in the neighbouring state of Kedah.

 ?Our country has never experienced such a disaster before,? deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said. ?But among the tsunami-hit nations, we are the least affected.?

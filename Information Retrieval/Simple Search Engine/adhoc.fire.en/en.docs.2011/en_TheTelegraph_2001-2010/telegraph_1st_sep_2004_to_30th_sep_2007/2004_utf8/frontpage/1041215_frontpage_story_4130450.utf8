 Finally, Mamata takes notice

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 14: Since the initiation of the case against the December 3 Bengal bandh before Calcutta High Court, for the first time today a notice could be served to Mamata Banerjee, asking her if she had made any adverse remarks against the judiciary and why she should not be charged with contempt.

 Today, also for the first time, the Trinamul Congress joined the case as an added party through its general secretary Mukul Roy. 

 Earlier, Trinamul leaders had not only stayed away from court but also refused to accept the court order that declared the bandh illegal and asked the party to call it off.

 Idris Ali, the petitioner against the bandh call, later filed a contempt case against Mamata as well as Jyoti Basu and CPM state secretary Anil Biswas for making derogatory comments about the judiciary that were published in the press. 

 The division bench of Justices Pratap Kumar Roy and Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya admitted the contempt petition against Mamata but spared Basu and Bose as ?these leaders are not respondents in the bandh case?.

 The court asked the petitioner to serve notice on Mamata and asked her to file affidavits stating her position on the contempt proceedings by the third week of January. The process of serving the notice was accomplished today through Trinamul?s lawyer Arunava Ghosh.

 Trinamul?s counsel said the petition against the bandh called by the party was not maintainable as it was full of mistakes. ?The name of the party and the designations of its leaders mentioned in the petition were incorrect. That is why till date the party leaders are completely in the dark about the court orders relating to the December 3 bandh,? he said. 

 Earlier orders were issued to Trinamul chairman ? while it has a chairperson in Mamata ? and secretary, which the party does not have but has general secretaries.

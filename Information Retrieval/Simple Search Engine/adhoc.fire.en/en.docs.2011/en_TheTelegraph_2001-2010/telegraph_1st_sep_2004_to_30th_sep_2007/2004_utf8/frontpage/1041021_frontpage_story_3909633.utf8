Classmates want prabha to stay on

 Several classmates of Prabha, Veerappan?s younger daughter, have stood up for her after reports emerged that their school wanted to drop the 12-year-old girl. 

 The school in Cuddalore, 25 km from Pondicherry, today dismissed as baseless the reports which said it wanted to issue transfer certificate to Prabha after Veerappan?s death pushed the family into media glare. 

 ?It is not true. Neither have we issued the TC nor has anyone applied for it,? the school?s principal said over phone.

 After visiting the school, a journalist quoted several classmates of Prabha as saying she should continue to study there. The students said they did not know who Prabha?s father was till yesterday, adding that Veerappan?s crimes should not be allowed to stand in the way of her life.

 Prabha is a Class VII student of the English medium, co-ed school. A classmate said Prabha, who stayed in the school hostel, kept to herself and was ?very silent?.

 The principal said she and a few others knew the identity of Prabha?s father when the girl was given admission in July this year. ?She is okay in her studies,? the principal added.

 Prabha?s elder sister Vidyarani is a Class X student in Coimbatore.

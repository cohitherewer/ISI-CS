 Marks of brutality on boy?s body

 OUR BUREAU

 Howrah, Dec. 22: Four-year-old Ganesh Palodhi was brutally assaulted and battered before being strangled, police and forensic experts said today.

 But Ganesh?s father Siddhartha said his son could have escaped his cruel fate had the police ?even tried to help in tracing him and nabbing the abductors?. 

 Ganesh, who was kidnapped on December 3 and whose partly decomposed body was yesterday dug out from a field near his home at Bauria on the outskirts of Howrah town, was killed though his father had paid the abductors ransom. Siddhartha said the local Bauria police station even asked for ?inducements? to help trace his son.

 ?I could not imagine that the police would be so insensitive and heartless when I went to them for help,? he said. ?Hinting at a bribe, they said they needed to be looked after well if I wanted their cooperation in bringing my son home.?

 Siddhartha said he had decided to leave Bauria ?because of the state of insecurity that prevails here?.

 Yesterday, the additional director-general of police, CID, R.K. Mohanty, had said Bauria police did not try to catch the kidnappers at the time of paying the ransom ?simply because the boy?s father had made no such request?.

 Forensic experts said there were ?multiple injury marks? all over the child?s body. ?It was a very brutal act,? said A.K. Gupta of the department of forensic sciences of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. ?It seems the boy was repeatedly hit till he lost consciousness and was then strangled to death. But no blunt or sharp objects were used.?

 Investigators said that after killing Ganesh, the abductors stuffed his body into a jute bag and took it to a field behind the Palodhi home and buried it in a shallow pit.

 The CID, which took over from Howrah police only on December 18, said it was likely that Ganesh was dead when the ransom was paid. 

 ?Given the advanced stage of decomposition, it is possible the abductors carried on with the ransom negotiations after they had killed the boy,? Mohanty said.

 Two persons have been arrested in connection with the abduction.

Mumbai wait

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Bangalore, Oct. 8: Of course, the opposition 

group in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) may argue it?s just 

a coincidence, but not many are likely to be convinced.

One is referring to the presence of Messrs Inderjit 

Singh Bindra, Dhyaneshwar Chand Agashe and Niranjan Shah -- as also Raj Singh 

Dungarpur, given that he has shifted to Pune --- in Mumbai on the day a division 

bench of the Madras high court appointed Justice (retd) S. Mohan as the BCCI?s 

interim administrator.

The BCCI, after all, is headquartered at the Brabourne 

Stadium there and, according to The Telegraph?s sources, the Chennai-based 

Justice Mohan will probably take charge tomorrow morning itself.

Raj Singh and Bindra, in particular, had backed Union 

minister Sharad Pawar in last month?s BCCI elections. Pawar, however, lost to 

outgoing president Jagmohan Dalmiyas candidate -- Ranbir Singh Mahendra.

In fact, not a single Pawar man --- be it Shah (secretary?s 

post) or Prof. Ratnakar Shetty (joint-secretaryship) could emerge victorious.

The entire lot, including Pawar-backer Agashe, who 

wasnt allowed to vote at the AGM, is now awaiting Justice Mohan.

Significantly, given that the division bench passed 

its order on a Friday, it?s unlikely that any counter from the BCCI is actually 

going to be heard -- either in Madras high court itself or the Supreme Court -- 

before Monday.

Clearly, the drama didn?t end with the AGM in Calcutta.

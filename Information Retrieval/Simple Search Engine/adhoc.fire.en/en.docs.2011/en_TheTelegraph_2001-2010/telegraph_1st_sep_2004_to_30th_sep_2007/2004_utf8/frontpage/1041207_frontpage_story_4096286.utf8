 Anti-terror amendment

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: The Lok Sabha today passed a bill to repeal the anti-terror law and approved a substitute measure to tackle terrorism after a BJP walkout, reports our special correspondent.

 Both the bills, passed by the House by a voice vote, replace ordinances but the Left and the Samajwadi Party objected to their being approved without reference to the standing committee of Parliament for detailed examination. 

 Unable to thwart the passage of the amendment bill in the Lok Sabha, the BJP seems determined to hold it up in the Upper House.

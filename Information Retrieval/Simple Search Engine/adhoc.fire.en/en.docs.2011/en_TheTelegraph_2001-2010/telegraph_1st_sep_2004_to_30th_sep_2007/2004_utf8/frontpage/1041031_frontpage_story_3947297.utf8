 Hatkata Dilip in confess cry

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Delhi, Oct. 30: Hatkata Dilip, arrested from the Hooghly home of national footballer Sasthi Duley yesterday, has sworn revenge on his ?protectors? for letting him down.

 Police said the criminal, whose full name is Dilip Banerjee, has told them of his connections with several CPM leaders in North 24-Parganas, including a minister, and how he worked for them in return for ?political patronage?.

 Now ?let down?, he wants to make a confessional statement before a magistrate detailing how he intimidated voters and indulged in criminal acts.

 In Delhi, CPM Bengal secretary Anil Biswas did not rule out a probe into sports minister and party leader in North 24-parganas Subhas Chakraborty?s connections with Dilip, but ?only if there is enough evidence?.

 But football club East Bengal moved fast, leaving out Sasthi and Dipankar Roy, alleged to have introduced Dilip to Sasthi, from the Durand Cup squad.

 ?Dilip has told us during interrogation that a part of his criminal record can be attributed to what he has done for these top CPM leaders and now he wants to expose them since they have disowned him,? a senior police official told The Telegraph. ?This is why he wants to make the confessional statement.?

 The officer interrogating Dilip said he has requested the police to ensure his security after the confessional statement. ?He fears he may be killed by influential people after he records his confessional statement,? the officer added.

Sasthi?s younger brother said Dilip had been kept 

in their house on Chakraborty?s instructions. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee 

refused comment. His predecessor Jyoti Basu said: ?Subhas has said that he does 

not know anything. I am not a palmist (that I should know any better).?

 Dhaka alarm

 Sept. 14: India has accused Pakistan of using Bangladesh as a launch pad for Kashmir militants even as the US urged the three nations to join hands in the fight against terrorism.

Border Security Force chief Ajai Raj Sharma said: 

?There are firm reports that ISI has set up new training centres for terrorists 

in Bangladesh.? The allegation came as a team led by home secretary Dhirendra 

Singh readied to leave for two-day talks beginning tomorrow in Dhaka.

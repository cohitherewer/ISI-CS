 Ambani duo sets up date at board meet 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 20: Reliance 

 Industries Ltd (RIL), the flagship company of the Reliance 

 group which has been riven by a battle over ownership issues 

 between the Ambani brothers, has called a meeting of its 

 12-member board on December 27.

 The ostensible reason for the 

 meeting is to consider buyback of the company?s shares to 

 instil confidence among its 2.3 million shareholders who 

 have watched with concern a drop in the value of their investments 

 since the fight between the brothers spilled out in the 

 open.

 The meeting has been fixed for 

 the day before Dhirubhai Ambani?s birth anniversary. Earlier 

 this month, Anil Ambani had sought a board meeting in light 

 of the developments that have quickly followed elder brother 

 Mukesh?s comment to a TV channel that there were ?ownership 

 issues?.

 The short message to stock exchanges 

 on the board meeting had corporate corridors buzzing over 

 whether or not the board would also consider governance 

 issues within the group Anil has raised. 

 However, the notice lists as the 

 meeting?s agenda share buyback. This is second time RIL 

 will consider a buyback.

 ?Shareholder value is uppermost 

 in the minds of Reliance Industries and Mukesh Ambani (its 

 chairman),? said a director. The share has plunged from 

 Rs 545.55 on November 18 ? the day Mukesh?s comment became 

 public ? to Rs 480.65 at close today.

 The shadow boxing that has characterised 

 Brother Vs Brother continued with Amitabh Jhunjhunwala, 

 the treasurer of RIL who is considered close to vice-chairman 

 Since the spat between the brothers 

 erupted in July when the RIL board redefined the roles of 

 the chairman and vice-chairman, making Mukesh the ?final 

 authority? on all decisions in the Rs 99,000-crore group, 

 the directors have met just once on October 27 to ostensibly 

 consider the second quarter results.

 On December 6, Anil had requested 

 the convening of a board meeting to discuss several issues, 

 including the resignation of M.L. Bhakta, the senior-most 

 director and a close associate of Dhirubhai. Bhakta had 

 resigned on the grounds of old age but few believe this 

 to be the sole reason. 

 The other issue Anil wanted the 

 board to discuss was the company?s investment in Reliance 

 Infocomm, run by Mukesh. 

 After receiving Anil?s letter, 

 Vinod Ambani, the company secretary of RIL, wrote to the 

 directors seeking a convenient date for a meeting.

 RIL has discussed issues outside 

 the agenda at previous board meetings that were tacked on 

 as supplementary. In fact, the July meeting had redefined 

 the roles of the two brothers through a similar method, 

 leading to the clash between Mukesh and Anil.

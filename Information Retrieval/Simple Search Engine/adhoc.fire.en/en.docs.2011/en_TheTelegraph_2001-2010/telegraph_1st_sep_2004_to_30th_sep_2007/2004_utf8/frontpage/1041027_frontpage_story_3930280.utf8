Key suspect dies in jail

A STAFF REPORTER

 Babulal

Calcutta, Oct. 26: An accused in a sensational 

murder case died in Dum Dum Central Jail last night, three weeks before he was 

to appear in a trial court for the final hearing.

Babulal Sharma, 27, was one of a dozen prime accused 

in the murder of former Dum Dum municipality chairman Sailen Das. Sharma died 

around midnight after a fall, in which he wounded his head, said Joydeb Chakraborty, 

the inspector-general of prisons. 

Babulal was climbing down a steep flight of stairs 

from the bathroom when he fell, the officer said, adding: ?There is no foul play.?

But the family of the accused pointed to the dried 

froth at a corner of his mouth and the ?absence? of any ?critical? wound on the 

body and asked why police took eight hours to inform them. 

?They were very prompt in informing us when they took 

him out of the jail about a year ago for treatment of his eye. He was not using 

that bathroom for the first time,? said Sriram Sharma, Babulal?s father.

The death ? the 40th in custody in Bengal this year 

? comes two weeks after Sampad Mukherjee died in Presidency Jail, where he was 

being held over the Kuntal Sain murder case. His family, too, suspected foul play.

A resident of Jorapukur off Baguiati, Sharma was in 

jail since August 2001 after his arrest as alleged co-conspirator.

The police had been led to Babulal ? a lowly employee 

of the municipality whose rise to prominence was attributed to his proximity to 

Sudhir Bhattacharya, the former chairman of the municipality out on bail in the 

murder case ? after they rounded up the president of the Amitabh Bachchan Fans? 

Association, S.P. Kamat. Babulal, who was married with a child, was a big Bachchan 

fan and a member of the association.

The final hearing is slated for November 17.

Chakraborty said the warders had carried the bleeding 

and unconscious Babulal outside his cell. Jail doctor A.K. Roy advised hospitalisation 

after attempts to revive him failed. He was declared dead on arrival at R.G. Kar 

Medical College and Hospital.

Father Sriram and brother Rajesh said the jail officials 

told them he fell down around 12.30 am. Documents with The Telegraph reveal 

that Babulal was brought to the hospital at 12.45 am when the doctor on duty, 

Dipak Kumar Mistry, found him dead.

Babulal?s friends claimed they found no injury marks 

on his body. ?He had froth on his right side of the mouth which, according to 

a hospital staff member, suggested poisoning,? said Sanjit Roy.

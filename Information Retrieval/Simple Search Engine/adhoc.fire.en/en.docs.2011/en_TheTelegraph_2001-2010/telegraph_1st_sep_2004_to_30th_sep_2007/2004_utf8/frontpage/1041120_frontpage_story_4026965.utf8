 Land shakes under Basu, judge feet

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: A former 

 Calcutta High Court judge was today ordered to vacate his 

 house in a whack on the judiciary that also bruised the 

 man who sat in the chief minister?s chair for the longest 

 period.

 In a scathing judgment, the Supreme 

 Court cancelled the allotment of a plot by Jyoti Basu to 

 Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee in 1987.

 A division bench of Justices S.N. 

 Variava and H.K. Sema said: ?Justice B.P. Banerjee has misused 

 his divine judicial duty as liveries to accomplish his personal 

 ends. He has betrayed the trust reposed in him by the people.?

 Justice Banerjee had stopped distribution 

 of plots on a petition by the Salt Lake Welfare Association 

 on June 8, 1987. Three days later, he modified his order 

 to allow only the chief minister to allot plots. Four months 

 later, the first plot in Salt Lake?s Sector II was allotted 

 to the judge from the chief minister?s quota.

 This, the apex court said, ?is 

 undoubtedly an unholy nexus between the passing of the judicial 

 order and granting order of allotment?.

 Basu expressed surprise at the 

 ruling. ?But I did not know Justice Banerjee who got the 

 Salt Lake plot under chief minister?s quota in the late 

 eighties. In fact, 25 other former judges got land under 

 the chief minister?s quota during my tenure. Was it possible 

 for me to know each one of them?? 

 On Basu, the apex court pointed 

 to the petition that said the allotments were made ?unconstitutionally, 

 illegally, arbitrarily, whimsically, capriciously with mala 

 fide motive and in clandestine manner and/or in colourable 

 and arrogant exercise of power?.

 The judges ordered the state government 

 to assess the cost of construction of the house when it 

 was built and offer the price to Justice Banerjee.

 But if the former high court judge 

 thought he should get the market rate, the government could 

 put it on public auction. 

 In this case, there would be ?two 

 separate bids ? one for the house and the other for the 

 land?. The price fetched by the house should be paid to 

 Justice Banerjee who would have to vacate it within a week 

 of receiving the money. If he failed to do so, the government 

 was to evict him.

 Justice Banerjee refused to comment. 

 But sources close to him said: ?He will seek revision of 

 the order. He had already applied for the plot at the time 

 he gave the judgment, so his hands are clean.?

 The Supreme Court found Justice 

 Banerjee?s conduct beyond ?condonable limits? and added: 

 ?We have to perform a painful duty to instil public confidence 

 in the judiciary.?

 ?Today, judiciary is the repository 

 of public faith. It is the trustee of the people. It is 

 the last hope of the people. ... It is high time the judiciary 

 took utmost care to see that the temple of justice does 

 not crack from inside,? the ruling said.

 Advocate-general Balai Ray said 

 the government would have to carry out the order. ?Though 

 there is scope for seeking a revision of the order from 

 the same bench, I think it will not be of much gain.? 

 Dismissing petitions against all 

 other land allottees in Salt Lake, the court said this ?should 

 not be misunderstood as approval of the policy decision 

 of the government with regard to the allotment of land by 

 the chief minister from his discretionary quota?.

 Blaming teacher, girl kills herself

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: Sixteen-year-old Priyanka Das ended her life by jumping in front of a train yesterday and left behind a note that blamed her geography teacher for her death.

 The authorities of the south Calcutta school defended the teacher, saying she had been working with them for 10 years and was much respected by students, many of whom opted for geography because of her. 

 ?Dear Ma... I wanted to continue studying geography, but I did not realise this decision of mine would lead me to kill myself,? the Class XI student wrote in the suicide note.

 She had joined this school last month after getting 72 per cent in the Madhyamik exam.

 Priyanka walked out of her Baghajatin home around 6.30 pm and headed to the nearby railway tracks. 

 When she did not return till 9 pm, her family launched a search. At 11.30 pm, police informed them a girl?s body had been found near the tracks between Baghajatin and Jadavpur. ?We rushed to the spot to find Priyanka lying dead,? said Dhananjoy Mondal, her uncle.

 In the suicide note, Priyanka asked for her mother?s forgiveness. ?My geography teacher is responsible for my death... because she does not appreciate anything that I do.... I have never failed, but if I have to fail because of them, then nothing can be more sad.?

 Her family said she was asked to do a project but was unable to submit it on time last week. She handed it in yesterday. ?Priyanka showed us her project and said her teacher had found most of it incorrectly done,? aunt Arati Mitra said. 

 The teacher-in-charge of the school said: ?A student may make mistakes, and may be marked poorly for that. But that is only normal.?

Boss plays soul of America

- ?The future is now?, Springsteen tells a massive crowd 

JIM VANDEHEI

Madison, Wisconsin, Oct. 29: Facing crowds 

flowing five blocks deep, rocker Bruce Springsteen offered a passionate, and often 

poetic, pitch on Thursday for the election of John F. Kerry, a fellow guitar-playing 

Democrat.

As he softly strummed his acoustic guitar on a picturesque 

autumn day here, Springsteen brought 80,000 Wisconsinites to an emotional crescendo 

with a lyrical call for social fairness, altruism and a Tuesday defeat of President 

George W. Bush. It was vintage Springsteen, from the heart and distinctly heartland 

in its simplicity and touch. 

?I believe the essential ideas of American identity 

are what?s at stake on November 2,? he said, as red and yellow leaves sprinkled 

from the tree branches.

Health care. Decent wages. Helping the homeless. ?A 

sane and responsible foreign policy,? the rocker said.

?Paul Wellstone, a great Minnesota Senator, said the 

future is for the passionate.... The future is now, and it?s time to let your 

passions loose.?

It was one of the most remarkable scenes of the campaign, 

as college kids and old folks, disabled people and local luminaries crammed a 

stretch of West Washington Avenue ending at the steps of the state Capitol in 

the distance to hear the ?Boss?, as Springsteen is popularly known.

Students hung banners from their fraternity porches, 

drank beer and shouted from the windows at the crowd below. There were a few hecklers, 

screaming ?Four more years?, but the setting was a famously liberal enclave in 

an otherwise socially conservative state. As the huge banner hanging before the 

steps of the Capitol proclaimed, this is ?Kerry Country?.

It was also democracy at work ? a spirited crowd, 

violence-free political discourse and, afterwards, a procession of voters was 

led to early-voting outposts to register their preference for President.

Can the Boss turn votes? Probably not, says Mike McCurry, 

a top Kerry adviser. But the star sure can draw attention (several cable networks 

carried the rocker live) and massive crowds. The local fire marshal excitedly 

told reporters that never before had a crowd this large gathered for a single 

event in the city, perhaps the state. Springsteen drew another huge crowd in Columbus 

on Wednesday night and will star in an election-eve rally in Cleveland. 

Democrats often turn to celebrities to stir excitement 

? or, more often, raise money. In recent days, Jon Bon Jovi has travelled on the 

Kerry campaign plane and warmed up crowds with acoustic versions of ?80s hits 

such as Living on a Prayer. Bon Jovi hit the hustings with John Edwards 

on Thursday. But Bon Jovi?s no Boss, one of the most popular musicians of our 

time and one with a distinct blue-collar appeal. 

The Springsteen appearance was not a concert, but 

a double-sided 45. Alone on stage with his guitar and harmonica, Springsteen played 

Promised Land, spoke, and then, after saying ?This one?s for you, John,? 

broke into No Surrender, the theme song for the Kerry campaign that is 

played at virtually every rally and town hall event. 

Springsteen found himself in the rare position of 

serving as opening act ? this time for the Democratic nominee for President. When 

the two-song set concluded, Kerry high-fived a few supporters before bounding 

to the stage to bear-hug Springsteen. Still, Kerry thanked everyone from the governor 

to the state?s two Senators before praising Springsteen, who has a place in the 

Kerry family history. As Kerry told the crowd, the first concert he took his two 

daughters to was a show on Springsteen?s ?Born to Run? tour. 

?We all know who?s the real Boss,? Kerry said. He 

then managed to turn the Boss into a political attack.

?When George Bush heard that the Boss was playing 

with me ? was going to be with me today ? he thought they meant Dick Cheney, or 

the CEO of Halliburton.?

Kerry went on to deliver his standard speech.

Springsteen retreated to a nearby frat house, was 

handed a cold beer and from a second-story porch watched on.

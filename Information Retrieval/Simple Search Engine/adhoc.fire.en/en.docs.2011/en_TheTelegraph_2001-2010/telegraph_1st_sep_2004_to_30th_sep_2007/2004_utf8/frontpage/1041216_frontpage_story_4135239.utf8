 Govt nod to gender bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Manmohan Singh cabinet today cleared drafts of bills to ensure gender parity in Hindu succession rights, provide jobs in rural areas and make access to information a right.

 The bill to amend the Hindu Succession Act of 1956, which will be brought in Parliament during the ongoing session, promises to give daughters the same rights as sons to ancestral property.

 But sources said the rural employment guarantee bill could be referred to a parliamentary committee after being tabled in the House as differences persist with the Left on some of the features.

 The right to information bill has also reportedly skipped a key proposal that sought to make it incumbent on security forces to disclose details of human rights violations and corruption. The cabinet also referred the Lok Pal bill to a group of ministers.

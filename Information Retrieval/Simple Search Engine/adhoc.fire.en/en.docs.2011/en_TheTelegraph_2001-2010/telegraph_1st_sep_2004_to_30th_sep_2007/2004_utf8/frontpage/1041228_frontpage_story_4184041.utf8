 Isro maps tsunami trail of damage

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Dec. 27: Scientists at the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) today provided the Union home ministry with aerial images that will help in assessing the damage caused by the tsunamis. 

 Images of the battered districts of Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry and Andhra Pradesh were beamed by a satellite and an aircraft to Isro?s ground station at the National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), Hyderabad. 

 The Indian remote sensing satellite Resourcesat-1 passed over the east coast this morning during its polar orbit about 900 km from the earth. Each IRS satellite takes 14 days for one orbit around the earth. 

 An NRSA aircraft also flew over the coast this morning. 

 ?The extent of inundation as well as the trail of destruction will be revealed by these images. The data will be given to the Disaster Recovery and Relief Cell in the ministry of home affairs. The officials in the cell coordinate relief operations with respective state governments,? Isro sources said.

 They said Isro launch pads at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, the Sriharikota Range about 100 km from Chennai, and its Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TTC) station at Port Blair survived the tidal wave. ?Our launch facility is at an elevation in Sriharikota, and that?s why there was no sign of water rushing in from the Bay of Bengal. All the 2,500-odd employees and 700 families that live on that campus are safe. In Port Blair, a couple of cracks have been reported at the TTC station,? the sources said.

 Isro?s IRS series satellites have mapped the magnitude of damage wrought by floods in India as well as during oil spills in international waters.

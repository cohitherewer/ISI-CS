 Dad at hand for smut boy in custody

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: Face covered and heavily guarded, the school boy in the middle of the smut scandal today appeared before a juvenile court, which allowed Delhi police to be ?in charge? of him for a day provided his father stayed with him right through.

 As it granted the boy ? accused of engaging in a sexual act with a fellow student and filming it with a camera phone ? several safeguards (see chart), the court observed the interiors of the room in which the escapade was shot appeared to have been changed.

 Since the scandal broke late last month, the media has reported that the clip was filmed on the premises of Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram. Today, the court took notice of a claim that the interiors of the original room ?believed to be in the boy?s house ? had been altered.

 ?I cannot ignore submissions made by the investigating officer that after the incident the interiors of the room where the clip was shot was changed deliberately and also the fact that the juvenile along with his family left the country and never bothered to join the investigation,? the court said.

 ?In the interest of justice, custodial interrogation of the juvenile is required. However, keeping in view the purpose and the spirit of the juvenile justice act, the juvenile is given in the charge of the junior welfare officer? for one day subject to the condition that the father of the juvenile shall remain present during the entire period of custody.?

 The court of principal magistrate Santosh Snehi Mann refused to give Delhi police outright custody of the 17-year-old, saying the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act came in the way. The boy would be placed in the custody of the junior welfare officer, in whose presence only he could be questioned, it said.

 Till late tonight, the interrogation was yet to begin as the boy was reported to be very tired. Neither had his mobile been recovered.

 The bail plea of baazee.com CEO Avnish Bajaj, arrested after compact discs of the smut videoclip were sold on the auction site, will come up for hearing in Delhi High Court tomorrow.

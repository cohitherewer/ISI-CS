 Shock treatment for Sachin

 - Therapy begins, speedy recovery hope brightens

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sachin: Bangalore return?

London, Sept.8: Sachin Tendulkar has begun 

a course of ?shock therapy? which should hasten his recovery from the tennis elbow. 

According to Team India physio Andrew Leipus, the treatment began this morning 

and could continue for four-five days.

 ?Sachin is in the hands of an eminent radiologist (Dr David Collins), one who has probably made the world?s most extensive study on tennis elbows.... In his opinion, shock therapy alone ought to suffice and, so, cortisone injections won?t be necessary,? Leipus told The Telegraph, before leaving for Southampton.

 The overall treatment, though, is being monitored by Dr Chris Bradshaw.

 Sachin, it may be recalled, isn?t available for the about-to-begin Champions Trophy. Leipus, however, is ?hopeful? he will be fit for the home series against Australia. The first Test, in Bangalore, is from October 6.

 Significantly, the scan done last evening didn?t reveal anything more than a ?standard tennis elbow?.

 Virender Sehwag and Lakshmipathy Balaji, too, underwent a scan and, like Sachin, missed the inaugural ICC awards. Sehwag has been complaining of stiffness in the back, while Balaji is having pain in the right hip and groin region.

 Apparently, Sehwag?s scan didn?t show any abnormality, but he must ?take it easy? for a few days. As for Balaji, he has been given a muscle-relaxant injection and a call is going to be taken after a day or two.

 Team India?s first match, versus Kenya, is in Southampton on Saturday.

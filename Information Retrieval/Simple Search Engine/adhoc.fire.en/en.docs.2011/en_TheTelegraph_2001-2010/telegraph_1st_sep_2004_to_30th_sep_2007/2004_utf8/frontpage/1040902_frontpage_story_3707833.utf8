The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

City siege

Calcutta was taken hostage for hours on Wednesday 

afternoon as the ruling Left Front marched against the war in Iraq. In the picture 

(by Amit Dutta), a schoolboy looks out of a bus that got stuck in the rally flagged 

off by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself.

The chief minister said he stood opposed to rally 

raj but then the date September 1 was decided by Hitler, not me. That was when 

World War II started. I cannot change history.

Quite true. How can a history of decades of rallies 

be just wished away?

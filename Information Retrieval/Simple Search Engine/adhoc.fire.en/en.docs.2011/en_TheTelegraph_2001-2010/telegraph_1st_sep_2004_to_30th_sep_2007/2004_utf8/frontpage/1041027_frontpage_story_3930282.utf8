Economy alert with human face 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, Oct. 26: Two spooks for the economy 

and two terrors for the average loan seeker. But the RBI did not forget the human 

face that the Manmohan Singh government is keen to project.

The central bank today slashed its growth forecast 

for the economy for 2004-05 to 6-6.5 per cent from the 6.5-7 per cent predicted 

in May. 

It then topped that gloomy forecast with a warning 

that inflation could rise to 6.5 per cent by the end of March, winching it up 

from 5 per cent.

Unveiling its mid-term credit policy, the central 

bank also raised a key interest rate ? the repo rate ? for the first time in more 

than four years to 4.75 per cent from 4.5 per cent. This is the rate that the 

central bank pays commercial banks for loans.

The increase makes it dearer for banks to borrow from 

each other, which will put pressure on them to later raise rates on loans to companies 

and consumers.

However, the RBI held its benchmark bank rate, at 

which it lends to commercial banks, at 6 per cent.

RBI governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy spooked banks by 

warning them about a looming ?asset bubble? bust because of the runaway rise in 

housing and consumer loans. 

Banks have been shovelling huge amount of loans to 

finance housing purchases ? one of the fastest growing segments in the banking 

industry ? and doling out personal loans to enable customers to buy consumer durables.

The RBI advocated several risk containment measures: 

it proposed to raise the housing loan risk weight to 75 per cent from 50 per cent 

and the risk weight for consumer credit such as personal loans and credit cards 

to 125 per cent from 100 per cent.

The new risk weightages are applicable only to banks 

and not to housing finance companies like HDFC. 

In effect, it means that banks will now have to exercise 

greater caution while giving out these loans, entailing closer scrutiny of loan 

applications. ?With the experiences of many countries, we want to be careful and 

it?s a temporary measure,? Reddy said.

?We (the banks) need to put more capital to comply 

with this new change. Capital has a cost,? said Shailendra Bhandari, managing 

director of Centurion Bank, hinting at a possible increase in housing loan rates 

in the near future. 

Not everyone held this view. K. Cherian Verghese, 

the CMD of Corporation Bank, agreed with Bhandari that the returns on these loans 

would shrink, but reckoned it wouldn?t spark a rate rise for two reasons. ?First, 

there is enough liquidity in the markets and, second, there is very stiff competition.?

The credit policy ? the first since the Manmohan Singh 

government came to power in May ? addressed some of the concerns articulated by 

the UPA by promising more credit to the weaker sections.

For the first time, the central bank spoke about providing 

loans to the ?distressed? urban poor to help them pay off their dues to loan sharks 

? a move that will bring them into the formal financial system. The loans will 

be provided to them against appropriate collateral or group security.

Banks were also directed to make greater efforts to 

increase their disbursements to small and marginal farmers to 40 per cent of their 

direct advances under special agricultural credit plans.

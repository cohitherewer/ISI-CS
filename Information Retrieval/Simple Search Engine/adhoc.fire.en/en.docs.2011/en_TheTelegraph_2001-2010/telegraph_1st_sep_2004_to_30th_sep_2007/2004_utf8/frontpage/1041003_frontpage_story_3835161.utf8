 Tehelka panel

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: An announcement on extending the tenure of the Phukan Commission inquiring into the Tehelka tape scandal will be made tomorrow but there is a strong view in the government to institute a parallel inquiry by the CBI, reports our special correspondent.

 The commission?s term ends tomorrow. Personnel and training department officials said they had not received the proposal from the law ministry needed to issue a notification of extension.

 But neither the officials nor some of the people affected by the Tehelka sting operation believe that the Centre would let the commission lapse.

 Attack on Geelani son-in-law 

Srinagar, Nov. 8: Gunmen shot the son-in-law 

of a Kashmiri separatist leader today when he was entering his house. 

 Doctors said Altaf Ahmad Shah, son-in-law of All Parties Hurriyat Conference leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, was out of danger after the attack. Altaf also headed the legal cell of the group. 

The attack, the second on the group in a little over 

a month, came at a time when separatist leaders were trying to re-unite the Hurriyat.

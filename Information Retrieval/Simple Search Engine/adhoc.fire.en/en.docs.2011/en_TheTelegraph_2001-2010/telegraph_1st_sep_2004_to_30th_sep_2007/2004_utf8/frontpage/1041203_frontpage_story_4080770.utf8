 Mumbai, Dec. 2: The sensex breached the 6300-mark for the first time, finishing at 6328.43 in a 100.6-point gain fuelled by FIIs who have shovelled $264 million into the market in the past few days. 

A fall in crude prices to $45.47 per barrel in Asian

Average and expectations of strong corporate performance have lured overseas investors.

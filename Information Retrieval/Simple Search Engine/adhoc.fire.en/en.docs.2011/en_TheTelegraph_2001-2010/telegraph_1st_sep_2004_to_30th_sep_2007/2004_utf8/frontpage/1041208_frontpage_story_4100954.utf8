 Port link

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: India today appeared to be on the verge of a breakthrough with Bangladesh on three links but hit a roadblock with Pakistan on a bus service.

 Bangladesh said it ?was willing? to allow India the use of Chittagong port to link its northeastern states, a much- debated gas pipeline from Myanmar to Bengal, and open up a disused railway line between Dhaka and Sealdah. But the ?details have to be worked out?.

 India today proposed the use of entry permits, along with passports that will not be stamped, for travellers on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route. But Pakistan is against the use of passports at all. The technical talks will continue tomorrow.

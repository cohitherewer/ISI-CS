Guerrilla hit on traffic

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Dec. 1: Soon after the clock struck 

12, scores of state-owned and private buses, minibuses, trucks, trams, taxis and 

autorickshaws halted at major intersections.

Behind the stalled wheels was the army of Citu supporters. 

At many points, they stopped their vehicles and left, to come back after half-an-hour, 

the duration of what the Citu called chakka jam.

Police looked the other way.

People stuck in crippled traffic for hours in the 

backwash of this new method of protest had different tales to tell, but Buddhadeb 

Bhattacharjee?s government claimed that the Citu action was a flop.

?The reports I have received suggest it is not at 

all successful,? said chief secretary Ashok Gupta.

No less than transport minister Subhas Chakraborty 

disagreed. ?My reports say chakka bandh was hugely successful. There was 

no way it could have been thwarted along the lines the court wanted because we 

could not have beaten the operators into plying their vehicles during that period.? 

Esplanade and Maniktala crossings were blocked by 

trams, but traffic policemen on duty did not try to make the drivers clear the 

blockade.

A handful of bus drivers, who tried to keep their 

wheels running, were stopped by Citu activists. 

At several places ? like Dum Dum, Nagerbazar, Lake 

Town-VIP Road crossing and Park Circus ? the protest was less novel. Citu supporters 

simply blocked the roads.

Several participants headed to an information technology 

conference, where industry leaders were speaking, turned back after hitting a 

traffic wall.

Aggressively soliciting infotech investment in Bengal, 

chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee evaded the question why the government 

could not enforce the court order directing that traffic should be kept normal.

?Direct your questions to Citu,? he said.

Rival Mamata Banerjee, accused the government of complicity 

with Citu. ?They (Citu) paid no attention to the court order and did what they 

felt like after co-opting the government and the police into it,? Mamata said.

It did not occur to her that she herself is ignoring 

a court order against her bandh call.

Calcutta, Dec. 1: A solutions and services 

development centre and a technology institute ? the country?s biggest corporation 

is planning big for Bengal. 

Mukesh Ambani, the chairman and managing director 

of Reliance Industries, announced the company?s intention to roll out two initiatives 

for a ?rejuvenated and revitalised? Bengal during the inauguration of Infocom 

2004, organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication, 

today. 

?We will set up a solutions and services development 

centre, the first outside Mumbai, here and it will create employment for around 

2,500 people over three years. For the talented youths of the state, we will also 

set up the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology,? 

said Ambani, the chief guest at the inaugural ceremony of the five-day conference-cum-exhibition, 

billed as one of the biggest IT expositions in the country. 

He later inaugurated the exhibition, where over 150 

participants are showcasing the latest tech tools, on the Salt Lake Stadium grounds. 

Nasscom chairman Jerry Rao and president Kiran Karnik and state IT minister Manab 

Mukherjee were also present.

Using the Infocom platform, Mukherjee announced the 

state government?s next target: ?We are growing very fast, but we are not satisfied. 

Not just in India, our aim is to become the most favoured IT hub in Asia.? 

He said the government is tackling the misconceptions 

about Bengal. The government is also addressing issues related to labour, power, 

traffic and road infrastructure.

Ambani did acknowledge the initiatives: ?The Bengal 

IT minister is the only minister in the country who works faster than Reliance.? 

He topped the compliment with the announcement of 

the two projects and appreciation for the human resource in Calcutta, ?the mind 

of Bengal?.

Reliance has laid an extensive optic fibre cable network 

in the state and is also setting up a 2,000-seater call centre in Salt Lake. ?In 

the Reliance Infocomm project in the state, we have invested around Rs 1,000 crore,? 

Ambani said.

He took care to explain how Reliance Infocomm ? perceived 

to be one of the factors that soured the relationship between the older Ambani 

and his brother Anil ? was working to marry information and communication and 

fulfil the dream of Dhirubhai Ambani. 

Nasscom?s Karnik picked up from where Ambani left 

off and complimented the Left Front government for its ?can do and must do? approach.

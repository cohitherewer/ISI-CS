 Singh dreams global amp; rural

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today unfurled a development agenda that rests on the twin pillars of globalisation and agrarian reform.

 The world is willing to invest in India that now has an ?embarrassment of riches? in its foreign exchange reserves, and a second green revolution is set to transform the rural economy into a bustling enterprise, he said.

 Singh was inaugurating the Indira Gandhi conference on ?India: The Next Decade? today, the birth anniversary of the late Prime Minister. He also released two books ? Two Alone, Two Together: Letters between Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru 1922-1964, edited by Sonia Gandhi, and Letters From a Father to His Daughter by Jawaharlal Nehru. The books have been published by Penguin India.

 ?Gone are the days I would spend sleepless nights worrying about debt rescheduling! Today, we can proudly claim that foreign exchange is no longer a binding constraint. If we choose to be more welcoming, the world is willing to invest in India,? the Prime Minister said at the outset of a speech in which he charted a roadmap for India till 2015.

 Singh was invited by Sonia to speak on the lawns of Teen Murti Bhavan.

 The Prime Minister said a growth rate of 7.5 per cent in the gross domestic product was achievable.

 The Prime Minister set for himself tasks that he must undertake. ?We must ignite a new revolution of creativity and enterprise in the rural areas. India needs a second green revolution aimed at increasing the returns on investment??.

 ?By the end of my term in office, 

 I would like to see world class power generation, world 

 class highways, world class ports and airports and world 

 class banking and communications infrastructure,? the Prime 

 Minister said.

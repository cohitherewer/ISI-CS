 Dirt flies in TV rights tussle 

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 28: Away from the power play in Calcutta, murky flanks have been opened in the cricket telecast rights battle.

 The secretary of Subhash Chandra, whose Zee Telefilms lost the rights when the bidding process was cancelled, has lodged a police complaint alleging that BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya had threatened the broadcast baron on phone to cause ?harm to his life?.

 The complaint was filed at Cuffe Parade police station in Mumbai last night, deputy commissioner of police Naval Bajaj said. 

 ?We have not registered any case against anybody since we are probing the matter,? Bajaj added.

The complaint comes at a time Zee and the board are 

locked in a legal tussle over the telecast rights. 

 In Calcutta, Dalmiya expressed surprise at the complaint. ?This is the price one has to pay for being the BCCI chief,? he said.

 Another curious twist was added in Delhi with a CBI officer saying the bureau had received a complaint against a top BCCI official. 

 ?We have received a complaint of some irregularities. We are examining the complaint,? the CBI officer said.

 But the CBI has yet to ascertain if it had the jurisdiction to investigate a case against an official of the BCCI, which is not a government body.

 Several television companies are also learnt to have opened lines of communication with the board for rights to the Australia series. Ten Sports and Sony are said to be in the running, besides ESPN and Prasar Bharati.

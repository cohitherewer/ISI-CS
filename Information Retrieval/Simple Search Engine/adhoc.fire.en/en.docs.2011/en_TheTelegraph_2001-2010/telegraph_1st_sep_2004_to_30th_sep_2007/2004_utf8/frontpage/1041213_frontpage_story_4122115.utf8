 Rao condition improves 

 New Delhi, Dec. 12 (PTI): The condition of P.V. Narasimha Rao improved today with the former Prime Minister opening his eyes for the first time in the last three days.

 Rao shook hands with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who visited him at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences this evening.

 The 83-year-old Rao, who was admitted to AIIMS on December 10 after he complained of breathlessness, had suffered a cardiac arrest soon after but was revived.

 The former Prime Minister continues to be on temporary pacemaker, but doctors said he opened his eyes late in the evening and recognised people around him.

 Strike by oil tankers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: Truckers ferrying oil from oil terminals to petrol pumps have gone on a sudden strike, raising the threat of a crisis developing in the city.

 The West Bengal Tankers Association stopped lifting oil from the terminals after the Centres directive not to allow vehicles which are older than 15 years to carry petroleum products.

With no refilling since Monday, it is feared that 

most petrol pumps may run dry from tomorrow afternoon.

Lodha in charge, 99.99 per cent

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Sept. 15: At a seat of theatre in 

south Calcutta, Rajendra Singh Lodha took centre stage.

Locked in a battle with the powerful Birla family 

over an inheritance, Lodha proved he was in full control of the largest property 

involved in the dispute at a six-hour drama which unfolded at Uttam Mancha, named 

after Bengali film legend Uttam Kumar.

At the stormy annual general meeting of Birla Corporation, 

the flagship company of the MP Birla group, Lodha commanded close to full support 

of the shareholders when his name was put to vote for chairing the session.

A group of shareholders rushed to the podium in one 

corner of the stage, shouting that Lodha could not chair the meeting. Dharmendra 

Bhandari had earlier been chosen chairman by a show of hands but he proposed Lodha?s 

name.

?He can?t chair the meeting as the election of a provisional 

chairman has already been done. Why are you conducting a poll?? demanded S.K. 

Pareek, a shareholder of Birla Corp and an official of Kesoram Industries, a company 

owned by B.K. Birla.

B.K. Birla is a contestant of the will Lodha has produced 

in which Priyamvada Birla, the widow of M.P. Birla, has left all properties to 

him.

Some 15 other protesting shareholders collected around 

Pareek and were soon taken on by Lodha loyalists, forcing police intervention. 

But the voting continued and Lodha bagged 99.99 per cent of the over 5.22 crore 

votes (one vote against one share) polled, winning the right to preside over the 

meeting.

Following an order yesterday by the Company Law Board 

(CLB), Lodha could not, however, act as chairman when three resolutions on reappointment 

of three directors whose terms were ending today were moved. One of these reappointments 

was his.

The result of the polling on these reappointments 

cannot be disclosed until the CLB disposes of a petition filed by some Birla Corp 

shareholders alleging mismanagement by the Lodha-led dispensation. Priyamvada 

Birla had made him co-chairman.

?Badi Ma?s? memory hung over the meeting ? 

Lodha mentioned Priyamvada, who died in July.

For the first time since the war of the will erupted, 

he also opened his mouth on the subject in public, replying to accusations hurled 

by the Birlas.

?Some people have claimed that they were not aware 

this was coming. Don?t get swayed by choppy waters,? Lodha said.

It was a reference to the Birla argument that Priyamvada 

Birla could not have left her assets to an outsider.

Lodha also clarified that the expense of the litigation 

with the Birlas was not being ?debited? to Birla Corp.

As wave after wave of loud protests by shareholders 

of the rival camp lapped the shore of the stage, Lodha sat calmly, with seven 

other directors. Nandini Nopany, the daughter of K.K. Birla and a director, was 

not present.

Not mixing the legal battle with company affairs, 

Lodha proposed her name for reappointment and she was re-elected, though she belongs 

to the enemy camp. Nopany?s reappointment was cleared after the CLB gave permission.

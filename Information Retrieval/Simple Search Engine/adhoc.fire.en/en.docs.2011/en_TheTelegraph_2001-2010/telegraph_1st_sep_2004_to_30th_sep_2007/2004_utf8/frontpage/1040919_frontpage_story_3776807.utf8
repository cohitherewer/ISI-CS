 Cry for 2 hat-tricks, not 3

 - India and Pak have clear goals but sky plays a dark trick 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Birmingham, Sept. 18: Both 

 India and Pakistan are looking for a hat-trick ? different 

 ones, mind you: Pakistan wants to make it three in-a-row 

 against India; India are aiming for three successive ODI 

 wins, following those over England and Kenya.

 In any case, tomorrow?s clash at Edgbaston has become a Champions Trophy quarter final. So, the elements permitting, an absolute cracker is awaited. Indeed, the one hat-trick neither wants is a third consecutive day of rain and gloom.

 ?Our preparations have been hit and for the second day running, we?ve had to do with indoor nets.... But, then, one can?t get everything one wishes,? observed Team India captain Sourav Ganguly rather philosophically.

 Inzamam-ul Haq voiced much the same thoughts. If anything, he was more blunt: ?Thanks to the weather, our build-up hasnt been proper.... It would have been better had the ICC slotted this tournament in August...?

 Despite preparations hit for a six, both captains seemed relaxed, an indication that frequent face-offs between the teams ? seven ODIs have already been played this year ? eased the tension.

 Pakistan, though, are at an advantage. If not one ball is bowled either tomorrow or on Monday (reserve day), Inzamam and Co. will go through because of a better net run rate ? 3.20 vis-a-vis 1.96.

 ?Although the forecast is encouraging, the weather can get unpredictable.... I hope it doesn?t reach the net run rate stage but, if it does, it?s going to be our bad luck,? remarked Sourav, presenting a clean look after the razor-treatment on his stubble.

 With joint holders Sri Lanka out, the pressure is on India ? without Sachin Tendulkar ? to stay in the competition and carry the 2002 ?legacy? forward.

 Predictably, neither captain is reading much into what may be termed current form.

 ?The wins in Colombo (in July) and Amstelveen (last month) are history.... As also, by the way, our failure to beat India in events such as the World Cup,? emphasised Inzamam.

 Sourav, for his part, said: quot;It could be anybodys game.... I dont believe in favourites for ODIs.... Everything depends on how one performs on the day. quot;

 The captains, however, differed over the impact of the toss. While Inzamam felt winning in unsettled conditions gave a 20 per cent advantage, Sourav maintained the difference wouldn?t be appreciable.

 Sourav, though, did add: quot;In England, its not easy hitting through the line early on and, so, an innings has to be constructed... The first seven-eight overs do become crucial... quot;

 Asked by The Telegraph as to what would make the difference, he answered passionately: quot;Better cricket.... I dont think one player will make a difference... Theres no bigger stage than a match with Pakistan.... I expect everybody to stand up and be counted... quot;

 Its going to be terrific if this pack is led by Virender Sehwag and pin-up boy Yuvraj Singh. Both have been woefully short on runs for many weeks, but the opportunity to make amends is at their doorstep.

 Significantly, Pakistan have won both games against India ever since Bob Woolmer moved into the coachs chair ? from where Javed Miandad was evicted in mid June.

 Among other things, he has changed the players body-language and, in the eyes of many, remains the biggest threat for the opposition.

 quot;He has a great record and the change is visible, quot; conceded Sourav. Inzamam, of course, went ga-ga: quot;Bottomline is that the players are very happy... He relates to each one of them and is a friend.... Our results will surely get better. quot;

 Inzamams priority, for now, is to ?win? the Champions Trophy.

 Late tonight, everything pointed to Pakistan retaining the XI which thrashed Kenya by seven wickets on Wednesday. As of now, then, there wont be room for the experienced Azhar Mehmood.

 Where the Indians are concerned, one change is confirmed ? Rohan Gavaskar replacing specialist wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik, who wasnt impressive even in Thursdays practice match versus a bunch of amateurs.

 Rahul Dravid is going to be back in a double role.

 Additionally, Anil Kumble may make a comeback with Ajit Agarkar joining the reserves. Obviously, if this comes about, it will be influenced wholly by the conditions.

 Well, much as Inzamam insisted its going to be quot;another game, quot;its unlikely that anybody on the packed terraces ? support groups, by the way, are converging from London and Leeds, Manchester and Wolverhampton ? will be easily convinced.

 Incidentally, cine idol Hrithik 

 Roshan is expected to add glamour to this showpiece match. 

 He is being flown in by Hero Honda, a global partner of 

 the ICC.

Patna, Sept. 24: The ?cut? in Laloo Prasad 

Yadav?s cameo came before the ?lights, camera, action? did.

 The railway minister put off till tomorrow the scheduled shoot for Mahesh Manjrekar?s rib-tickler Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav after the Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre on the inclusion of ?tainted? ministers in government.

 Laloo Prasad is slated to put in a ?special appearance? towards the end of the film in which Suneil Shetty, Manjrekar himself and Johnny Lever respectively play three characters by each of his three names. The RJD chief plays his ?real self?.

 The smiles on the faces of Manjrekar?s crew faded as Laloo Prasad ? back home after a week-long holiday in south India ? went almost incommunicado and kept them cooling heels all day. Manjrekar, Shetty and Lever had return tickets booked for this evening.

 The cheer returned only after Laloo Prasad ? under fire along with fellow Union ministers Mohammad Taslimuddin, Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav and M.A. Fatmi ? met them in the evening for a briefing on his role and dialogue delivery.

 Laloo Prasad declined comment on the notice, saying the UPA government would cooperate with the apex court but he could talk only after ?studying? it.

 The crew ? including Masumi who plays Padmashree, Gulshan Grover, Kim Sharma and Sharat Saxena ? waited at Bihar minister Shyam Rajak?s place through the day. Rajak, who reportedly shares a rapport with Bollywood courtesy a relative who runs a Mumbai security agency, said the shoot would be held at the chief minister?s residence tomorrow.

 Shetty ? Laloo in the film ? called the film ?a healthy comedy you can watch with family?. It would mostly be shot in exotic South African locales. Laloo Prasad had initially suggested that his part be shot in his ?native village? but that appears unlikely now.

 The film revolves around a group of people on the hunt for diamonds belonging to heroine Padmashree?s dead father, which have been whacked by a business partner. It is due for release on October 1.

 The producers said the film had been named after Laloo Prasad ?with his ready consent?. They said his goodwill would boost the film?s prospects.

 Laloo Prasad had himself released the film?s music in Patna on September 12. His wife and Bihar chief minister, Rabri Devi, had wished the comedy luck.

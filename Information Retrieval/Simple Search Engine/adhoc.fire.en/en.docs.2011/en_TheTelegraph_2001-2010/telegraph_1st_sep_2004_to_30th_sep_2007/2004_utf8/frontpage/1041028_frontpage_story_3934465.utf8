 Sourav injury

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Nagpur, Oct. 27: Sourav Ganguly?s participation in the fourth Test in Mumbai is in doubt.

 According to a doctor who treated the Indian captain at a diagnostic centre here this evening, his chances of playing in Mumbai are ?50-50?.

 Sourav went through ?nucleus scanning? after the second day?s play ended. He has been experiencing pain in the right groin/thigh region and pulled out of the third Test yesterday. 

 Sources said there was ?no blood clot?, which ?signifies there is just a strain between the hip joint and thigh?.

 The doctor said there was ?no malfunction of any part and, hence, nothing much to worry. Rest and treatment is the best cure?.

 Sourav had felt the pain first while fielding on the opening day of the series in Bangalore.

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: Sudhir Sachdeva, the owner of Sachdeva Private Tutorial College and a key accused in the CBSE pre-medical question paper leak, surrendered in a Delhi court today after evading arrest for months.

 The owner of the coaching chain that has centres all over the country, including Calcutta, gave himself up two days after Delhi High Court rejected his anticipatory bail plea for the second time.

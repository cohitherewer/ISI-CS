 Dhaka rally salvo

 FARID HOSSAIN IN DHAKA AND OUR DELHI BUREAU

 Oct. 3: A judicial probe into a deadly grenade attack on former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina?s rally has reportedly blamed a ?foreign intelligence agency? ? a euphemism usually used in Dhaka to describe India?s spy agency, RAW.

 The purported contents of the report, prepared by supreme court judge Jognul Abedin, were leaked at a time when relationship between India and Bangladesh has turned frosty.

 The disclosure, made in Dhaka?s New Age daily, also coincided with the militant strikes in the Northeast, where Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today again raised the issue of Indian fugitives? camps in Bangladesh and Myanmar with the Centre.

 Hasina, viewed as pro-India in Bangladesh and who has been blaming the Khaleda Zia government for the attack on the rally that killed 21 people, rejected the reported findings of the commission.

 ?The chairman of the commission has spoken the words of the government,? she told a cheering crowd today at her first public rally since the carnage in August. 

 Hasina?s party has called for a nationwide general strike on October 10 to press for identifying the ?real culprits behind the attack and bring them to justice?.

 While submitting the 162-page report to the government yesterday, Justice Abedin said: ?We have identified the attackers and everything has been included in the report.? 

 He added that the ?incident was a naked attack on the independence and sovereignty of the country?. 

 But the judge did not disclose the findings, saying it is up to the government to decide whether to make them public.

 The New Age daily reported today that ?the commission observed that the motive behind the attack?was to blacken the image of the country and stop foreign investment by creating anarchy?.

 The Bangladesh government has not yet either denied or confirmed the newspaper report. 

 The grenade attack had sparked worldwide condemnation and prompted intervention of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Interpol to help Bangladeshi investigators in the case.

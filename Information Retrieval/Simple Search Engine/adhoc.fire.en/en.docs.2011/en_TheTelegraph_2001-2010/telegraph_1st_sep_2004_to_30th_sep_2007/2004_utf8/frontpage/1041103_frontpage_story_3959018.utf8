 Van Gogh kin dies in hate crime

Theo van Gogh

 Amsterdam, Nov. 2 (Reuters): A controversial Dutch filmmaker accused by Muslims of ridiculing their religion was stabbed and shot dead in Amsterdam today, shocking the Netherlands where the killing was denounced as an attack on free speech.

Theo van Gogh, a distant relative of 19th Century 

Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, had sparked controversy with newspaper articles, 

books and films voicing his contentious views on Islam after September 11. He 

had branded imams women-haters.

 The killing was widely condemned by Muslim groups.

 Van Gogh, 47, was attacked on his bicycle near a park close to the centre of the Dutch capital in the morning rush hour. Police arrested a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan citizenship after an exchange of gunfire.

 Van Gogh had received death threats after his most recent film Submission, about a Muslim woman forced into an arranged marriage who is abused by her husband and raped by her uncle.

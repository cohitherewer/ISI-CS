 Boiling oil fuels air fare surge 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: If you already have a confirmed flight ticket for the upcoming holiday season, relax. If not, get ready to pay 10 per cent more from the middle of next week.

 All three primary domestic carriers ? Jet, Sahara and Indian Airlines ? today announced a 10 per cent increase in fares to cope with the fallout of a record rise in global oil prices on fuel costs.

 The Delhi-Calcutta fare for business class passengers in these airlines will be around Rs 13,950 now. For Mumbai-Calcutta, the new business class fare is Rs 13,825.

 The revised fares will be applicable for tickets issued on or reissued on or after October 14, irrespective of the dates of travel.

 All three airlines said confirmed tickets issued on or before October 13 would be honoured for travel at the pre-revised fares for the ticketed itinerary only within the validity of the ticket.

 Indian Airlines and Jet said they were also raising their advance purchase (Apex) fare by 10 per cent. But Sahara said its cheap fare scheme would remain untouched. 

 Domestic air fares were last raised in June this year. An Indian Airlines spokesperson said: ?The continued increase in air turbine fuel (ATF) prices has added substantially to the input costs of airlines.?

 ATF prices had hit an all-time high of Rs 31,000 a kilolitre in October, compared with Rs 27,000 a kilolitre in June-July. Global trends indicate oil prices will remain firm in the coming months and airlines fear there may be a need for another bout of fare hikes in November-December.

 Pushed, govt wheels roll

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 30: The CPM-led government will keep the wheels moving during the 30-minute chakka jam by the Citu, the party?s labour wing, tomorrow and the bandh called by Mamata Banerjee on Friday.

 Chief secretary Asok Gupta issued a notice this evening to district magistrates, superintendents of police, divisional commissioners, zonal inspectors-general, deputy inspectors-general and other top police officers to follow the high court order on the chakka jam.

 Handing out copies, Gupta told newspersons: ?The order came to me 15 minutes ago and I am directing officials to follow the order in toto.?

 ?Action will be taken against those who prevent people from driving their vehicles. However, if anyone stops a car at that time for any personal reason, naturally, there is nothing to say,? he said.

 In line with the court?s directive to keep the media informed, an urgent press meet was organised late in the evening at Writers? Buildings.

 An order on the Trinamul Congress? call for a 12-hour Bangla bandh would be issued tomorrow, Gupta said. The government had yesterday directed senior officials to take steps to resist Friday?s bandh. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who left Writers? early to attend a programme at Bansdroni in south Calcutta, said: ?I have spoken to the advocate-general and I know what the order says. But how can I comment without taking a look at it??

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen, who had a 45-minute meeting with Gupta, said he heard of the order from a peon. ?Vehicles are often stuck for half-an-hour during traffic jams,? he said, but refused to reveal the government stand. ?I have nothing to say. Whatever there is to say, the chief minister will.?

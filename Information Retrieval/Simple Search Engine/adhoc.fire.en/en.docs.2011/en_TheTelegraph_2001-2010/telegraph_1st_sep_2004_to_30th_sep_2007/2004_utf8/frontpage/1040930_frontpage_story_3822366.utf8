 Pawar proves a potent point

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Sharad Pawar?s one-day match is over but his defeat has thrown up the first-ever formidable challenge to the way India?s cricket establishment decides who should run it.

 ?I don?t want to comment on it. I treat it as a one-day match and, for me, it?s over,? Pawar said of the outcome of the BCCI election.

 He took the opportunity to point out a ?lacuna? in the BCCI constitution. ?My reservation is about the constitution. There should be a proper procedure like filing of nomination, scrutiny and election, but here everything takes place on the same day. 

 ?Moreover, the election is conducted by a person who belongs to one of the groups. The time has come to give serious thought to the entire process. I will try to convince other colleagues about the shortcomings,? said Pawar.

 Jagmohan Dalmiya, too, conceded as much. ?I fully agree with what he says. He has spoken to me on this and the process needs to be changed.?

 Pawar, however, did not forget to underscore that if the Maharashtra representative, D. Agashe, was allowed to vote, he ?would have won clear cut?.

 ?Though the ruling group wasn?t enjoying the majority, they influenced to create the majority. That the casting vote had gone to the other side itself indicates what the total plan was and why Agashe was sent out.?

 Pawar promised the board ?full cooperation?. ?They (the ruling group) have realised what is their stake,? he said.

 Newly elected president Ranbir Singh Mahendra insisted that the election was held in a ?fair manner?. But former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur alleged that the ?umpire had fixed the match?.

The Union minister was non-committal about fighting 

future board polls, but Dungapur said: ?Pawar will continue to be a part of the 

BCCI elections and a new chapter begins from today.?

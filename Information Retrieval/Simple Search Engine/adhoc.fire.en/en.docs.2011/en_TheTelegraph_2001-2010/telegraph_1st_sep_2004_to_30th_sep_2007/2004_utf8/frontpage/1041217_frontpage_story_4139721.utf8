 Breathe amp; reap cancer

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, Dec. 16: Ambarish 

 Choudhury has never touched a cigarette in his life. 

 So four months ago, when the family 

 physician told him he had lung cancer, the 45-year-old?s 

 first reaction was disbelief.

 What he did not realise was even 

 if he stayed away from the potentially lethal puff, the 

 city?s air is foul enough for a breath of death.

 ?People are yet to realise that 

 the high level of air pollution, caused by auto-emissions, 

 is also a major contributor to the high incidence of lung 

 cancer in the city,? Subir Gangopadhyay, a leading oncologist 

 and former head of radiotherapy, Medical College and Hospital, 

 said today.

 The comment came a day after the 

 Bengal government managed to slip out of the high court?s 

 focus after twice failing deadlines to meet tailpipe emission 

 norms. So far, only three auto emission testing centres 

 ? which can measure levels of pollution under the new norms 

 notified by Delhi ? have been ?upgraded? instead of the 

 50 the state said it would set up.

 Oncologists say the highly carcinogenic 

 unsaturated hydrocarbons, emitted from diesel exhausts, 

 get deposited in the lungs. Within a few years, the carcinogens 

 cause malignancy. 

 Similarly, chemical carcinogens, 

 floating in Calcutta?s atmosphere, can also damage the lungs 

 if inhaled regularly over a long period of time.

 ?Air pollution, rampant in Calcutta, 

 can be said to be the single largest cause of lung cancer,? 

 said Kalyan Bhattacharya, head of radiotherapy at NRS Medical 

 College and Hospital.

 A recent survey by the Chittaranjan 

 National Cancer Institute revealed that lung function of 

 56 per cent of the city?s adults was impaired. The survey 

 was conducted in the city as well as in the districts. 

 ?What is astounding is that only 

 2 per cent of the total lung cancer patients hail from all 

 the districts of Bengal,? Gangopadhyay said, quoting National 

 Cancer Registry figures.

 ?Diesel exhaust does choke up 

 the lungs and cause cancer and that perhaps explains why 

 lung cancer patients are more in the cities, specially in 

 a polluted city like Calcutta than perhaps somewhere in 

 Bankura,? said cancer surgeon Gautam Mukhopadhyay.

 Figures from state-run hospitals 

 for the past decade underline how far Calcutta?s foul air 

 has wreaked havoc. Of the over 200,000 cancer patients diagnosed 

 and treated at government hospitals during the period, 15 

 per cent had lung cancer, Gangopadhyay and other oncologists 

 said.

 ?Most of the lung cancer victims,? 

 they added, ?are non-smokers?. Of them, at least 20 per 

 cent were women who came from a middle-class background 

 and had nothing to do with tobacco.

 According to health department 

 statistics, state-run hospitals in the city report around 

 70 new patients everyday, of whom over 15 per cent suffer 

 from lung cancer.

 Murder at Subba retreat in Delhi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: Assam Lok Sabha member Mani Kumar Subba?s Man Friday, Milan Subba, was today found murdered at his boss? sprawling farmhouse on the outskirts of the capital.

 An unidentified caller informed the police control room in the wee hours that somebody had killed Milan, 34, and left the body on the first floor of the double-storeyed farmhouse. 

 Police said three persons who were in the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road farmhouse last night were absconding. The suspects include a guard.

 Mani Subba?s wife and son, too, were at the farmhouse during the murder. Both claimed they did not hear any gunshot. The Subbas had hosted a party yesterday and the police do not rule out the possibility of one or more of the guests being involved in the crime.

 ?Somebody who was there at the farmhouse intimated the police control room about the incident early in the morning. We have some leads and are working on them. The chain of events leading to the murder has, however, not been established,? said an official from Vasant Kunj police station.

 The police official said Milan?s body bore chest injuries, but declined to reveal whether he was shot.

 Milan hailed from Sikkim and was associated with the MP since 1995. He lived with his wife and sister near Mehrauli telephone exchange. 

 His brother Bhim Subba, a research scholar at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said Milan had been asked to accompany two persons from 1, Talkatora Road, the official residence of the MP, to the farmhouse.

 ?This was routine activity. Only this time my brother did not come out of the farmhouse after he took those two persons inside,? Bhim told the media.

 The victim?s wife, Gita, said her husband had quarrelled with Mani Subba?s brother-in-law some days ago.

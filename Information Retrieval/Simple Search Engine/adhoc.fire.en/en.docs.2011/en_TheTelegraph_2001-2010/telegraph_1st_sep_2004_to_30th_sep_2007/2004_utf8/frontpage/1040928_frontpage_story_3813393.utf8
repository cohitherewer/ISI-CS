BC Roy death during outage

Calcutta, Sept. 27: A 10-day-old girl died 

today at the BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children when it plunged into darkness 

for an hour-and-a-half after a power-line snag, says a staff reporter.

The blackout at Bengal?s biggest referral hospital 

for children, which has no alternative supply line, began at 3.25 am when a feeder 

line from CESC tripped. Supply was restored around 5 am.

Two other children died in just under 10 hours, but 

the hospital superintendent said the three deaths were not related to power failure 

alone.

?We did our best to salvage the situation,? said D.N. 

Majumdar, the CESC executive director (distributions).

 Blast at SRK concert

 Colombo, Dec. 11 (PTI): 

 A bomb ripped through Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan?s 

 mega concert in Colombo tonight, killing two persons and 

 wounding 15, including a number of children.

 The bomb exploded just as Shah Rukh ended his three-hour concert, police said, adding that the actor and his troupe were unharmed.

 Doctors said a 30-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man were killed. ?There were a lot of fireworks and everyone thought this was also part of that. Then we realised that we were bleeding,? a doctor at Colombo?s National Hospital quoted one of the injured as saying.

 ?There are another 15 injured admitted of which 12 are critical. They all have shrapnel injuries caused by hand grenade or a hand bomb,? the doctor added.

 Engineer rescued

 Patna, Nov. 26: One of the two abducted NHPC engineers, K.K. Singh, was rescued today from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, says our correspondent.

 ?Singh was rescued from Siktor in Gorakhpur after police confronted the abductors and raided a hideout. The operation is still on and we hope that the other engineer will be rescued soon,? the Bihar director-general of police said.

 Unconfirmed reports said Gorakhpur police, acting on a tip-off, reached the village and spotted the two engineers in a vehicle. Two armed men were watching the officials. On seeing the police, Singh jumped out of the vehicle. The abductors, however, escaped with the other official.

 Zoo of memories turns altar

 - Swraj son weds in London landmark loved by expired daughter 

 AMIT ROY

 Angad with Michelle

 London, Oct. 11: A day 

 after his wedding, Angad Paul, 34, youngest son of Lord 

 Swraj Paul, told The Telegraph: ?I feel very good. It was 

 the happiest day of my life.?

 Unlike the ?30-million wedding held by the other steel tycoon, Lakshmi Mittal, for his daughter, Vanisha, in France, Lord Paul?s son had a relatively modest affair when he married his solicitor fianc?, Michelle Bonn.

 The wedding took place in a specially-built conservatory in the grounds of London Zoo, which has sentimental value for the Paul family since this was where little Ambika used to be taken for walks by her father before she succumbed to leukaemia nearly four decades ago.

 Paul has donated a million pounds to London Zoo in memory of his daughter. There is also a statue of her in the zoo which is where Paul holds an annual tea party and where Angad?s wedding took place yesterday. ?Ambika was there in spirit,? remarked Paul.

 The rites were solemnised according to Hindu-Jewish tradition for Michelle is Jewish. ?We had a Hindu ceremony followed by Jewish blessings,? said Paul.

 Only family and close friends were invited. ?They were mostly Angad?s friends,? said Paul.

 However, guests included Sarah Brown, wife of the chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown, who came with her baby son, who is nearly a year old. ?Sarah is family,? Paul pointed out.

 He said Subroto Roy of Sahara flew over from India with his wife. The actor Arjun Rampal attended with his wife, the model Mehr Jesia. ?We know Arjun from before he became famous ? he has stayed with us,? disclosed Paul.

 K.K. Birla was there, too ? ?He dropped in for an hour? ?as was hotelier Lalit Suri.

 ?The wedding went off very well,? said Paul, whose elder twin boys and a daughter are married. ?There was dancing until 1 am but I left at 10.30 pm after dinner,? laughed Paul, who keeps to a strict regime.

 Apart from being chief executive of the Caparo group, Angad has also worked in films. He was, for example, executive director of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, a cockney comedy directed by Guy Ritchie, Madonna?s husband.

 There will be a big London reception thrown by Lord Paul on March 21 next year at Lancaster House, where the British government holds its parties. On October 25, the great and the good of India will attend a reception for which the British high commissioner in New Delhi has made his residence available. Lord Paul is a roving ambassador for Britain. The sub-text might be: ?Lakshmi Mittal might have more money but I have more clout.?

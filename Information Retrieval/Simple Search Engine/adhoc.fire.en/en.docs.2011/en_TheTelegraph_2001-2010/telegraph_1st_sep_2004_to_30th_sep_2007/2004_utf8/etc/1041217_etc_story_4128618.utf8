The Entertainer

 Shah Rukh Khan on the stage bomb blast in Colombo, Swades, The Incredibles and.... By Subhash K. Jha 

Q: The incident at Colombo must have left you shaken. 

It was much more than just an incident. People lost lives. I know no one wants to harm me. And it (the blast) wasn?t meant to harm me. I?m just an entertainer. To lose one?s life at such an entertainment event is really, really sad. I saw with my own eyes the people who expired. And it?s a terrible thing to happen. I?d still go to concerts. But I think losing one?s life during an entertainment event is too high a price. I know people want to see me on stage. But I don?t want to see people dead. 

Q: Do you have plans to visit Pakistan? 

If people expect me to come and entertain them, then I?ve no problem going anywhere, whether it?s China, Japan or Pakistan. The point is, people everywhere connect with me as entertainer. I?ve just done a show in Surinam before a 12,000-strong audience. They didn?t know our language. But they enjoyed themselves. I wouldn?t feel uncomfortable performing in any part of the world. Pakistan and India have very similar people and cultures. I?ve a lot of relatives in Pakistan. My cousins live there. Pakistan is a lot like India. That?s what we said in Veer-Zara. Whatever the reasons might?ve been for the two countries to be separated are far beyond the comprehension of simple souls like you and I. 

Q: Everyone from Bollywood in Pakistan is asked when you?re visiting them. 

That?s very humbling and sweet. I?ll go whenever I?m called. We need to work out the nitty-gritties?sponsors, organisers, etc. There are talks?I won?t go as merely a goodwill ambassador but an entertainer. I?m already a goodwill ambassador. I don?t need to prove that. I?d like to go to Pakistan for a show to tell the people I?ve come to entertain them. I can?t separate my two roles as goodwill ambassador and entertainer. One role automatically follows the others. 

Q:Your Temptations tour of the US and the UK were far more successful than other recent Bollywood shows abroad. 

I wouldn?t know. I can?t compare my shows to others. I can only compare the Temptations tour to my earlier concerts. Commercially and creatively, I?d say this world concert was far more successful than what I?ve done in the past. 

Q:Veer-Zaara gave you leeway to be more experimental as an actor? 

Yeah, I got to play an old man which was very nice. The impact has a lot to do with the way a role is written. An old man?s role is relatively easier than playing my own age. You?ve so many props, like grey hair, a slouch, a faltering 

voice, etc. There are so many ways of bringing alive the old man?s role. I found it easier to do that than to play a 35/40-year-old. 

Q: Do you feel Veer-Zara gave you a chance to be different? 

I think the difference is in the media?s head. I think I?m different in each of my films. To me it seems anyone who says I?m different in Veer-Zara is only recognising what I?ve done in all my films. Those who don?t understand cinema or acting would see the difference only when it?s in-your-face, as it?s in Veer-Zara where the guy is 100 per cent different. The nuances of acting are completely apparent only to the actor. It?s very difficult for the outsider to cotton on fully to what an actor does on screen, good or bad. This applies to every profession. I mean, I wouldn?t really know about the craft of journalism, would I? Though I?m penning my thoughts in a book that would be out soon. 

Q: Swades again looks very different. 

(Laughs) Like Veer-Zara? I?d say Swades was a more difficult role to play. Here I had very few props and crutches. Every project comes with its own requirements and baggage. Every film of mine crosses a certain budget and is targeted at a specific number of people. The whole world is the target audience . One cannot afford to be different just for the sake of being different. Even when I play Devdas it has to be a little bigger, a little richer, larger than life. I?ve to play my roles on that level. 

Q: How larger than life is your character in Swades? 

It?s 100 per cent the director Ashutosh Gowariker?s interpretation. By virtue of what it says Swades is a very important film. It addresses itself to a core issue regarding the shape and destiny of a developing nation like ours. Hopefully it will make the audience think, if not change its thought process. 

Being in the entertainment business it?s important to be focused on the job of entertaining people, and at the same time try to make a difference to our world. Swades attempts to do that. Swades falls within the purview of commercial cinema and still says things which are normally untouched by the genre. It has its own stark and minimalist appeal to it. It addresses its theme as seriously as it deserves. And let me add, it?s entirely Ashutosh?s dream, not mine. I?m only being used to communicate the director?s vision to the audience. 

Q: I remember during Veer-Zara you told us you didn?t bother with the script, just did what Yashji and Aditya told you to. 

The same is true of Swades. Since the ideas and thoughts in the film are not mine, I?m completely ignorant about their nature. In such a situation I?d rather just do my job. If I did anything more I?d only expose my own lack my education. Veer-Zara was about Indo-Pak relations from the 1980s to 2004. I?m sure Yashji and Adi had researched enough on the topic to make my character believable. I?d rather go with the creator?s vision than try to confuse the issue with my own input. 

Again, in Swades I let the director decide. Swades is set in a village. And I?ve never been to a village in my life except as a tourist. Maybe, you haven?t either. Most city-bred people haven?t. 

Q: So now you are doing films which make a difference? 

I always have. The social message is never the main point. It?s subservient to entertainment. I think I?ve got a sufficient fan following to watch me entertain them. So if a message is teased into my film I?m all for it. It?s like someone as important as Amitji talking about polio on television. I?m sure he doesn?t know much about the disease. But by telling the masses to take the vaccination he?s helping to eradicate the disease. I think it?s good to use your celebrity status to make a social message. Even if Swades makes only some people think, I?ve succeeded. I don?t know whether Swades will be liked ? that?s not in my hands. But I hope the issue will be driven home. 

Q: Would you like to do more issue-based films? 

It?s not about what I?d like to do, but what I?m offered. I can?t go down on the streets and shout for issue-based films. If someone comes to me with an idea that appeals to me I?m fine with it. I?ve been doing so many films which discuss issues. But sometimes the issue gets overpowered by the entertainment value. My cinema is feel-good cinema. I like my audience to feel happy while watching my films. This doesn?t mean I?m an incurably noble guy. I?m open to playing an ugly dark character, and I?ve done so in the past. But I won?t do it for the heck of it. Even when I did negative roles like Darr and Anjaam they were rounded off by a sense of fair justice for the wrongs done by my characters. People call my films eye-candy and all that shit. I?m proud of making people happy. Even Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge was over-simplified by the media. It was the first film of its kind. Now, after so many years it would be stupid to still consider it eye-candy. It fulfilled a dream for thousands of Indians abroad who wanted to get back to their roots. It told us that NRIs needn?t lose their Indianness just because they live abroad. I believe there can never be a successful film without a well thought-out idea. The masses like films that are simple and truthful, the simpler the better. 

Q: Do we see a director lurking in you? 

I?ll make a James Bond film. Bond films are the simplest and therefore the most successful. It?s about Good making Evil look stupid. There?s Ravan within all of us. We need to use the Rama within us to eradicate the evil. 

Q: Your voice and your son?s will be heard in the animation film, The Incredibles, on the same day that Swades is released. 

It wasn?t as though I had a hand in his being chosen. My son joined me much later. He was part of an audition with many other boys. He was chosen from among many hopefuls. I was told that they were in two minds about Aryan because they needed an older boy for the dubbing. But after two or three days they decided to go with Aryan. I think the Columbia-Tristar people are experts at handling kids. They do so many dubbed animation films where children?s voices are required. They proved far more professional than I thought. I didn?t want Aryan to get into a situation that would tire him. But it was easier for him to dub than me. 

Q: How long did he take? 

Three-four days, for an hour every day. But there were beautiful ladies to handle Aryan. They took very good care of him and the other four kids who also dubbed. He had a good time with them. He would go every day at 3 pm and return at 4:30. 

Q: What was it like dubbing for another character? 

It was nice. In animation films the voice is decided first, then the character is created accordingly. Shrek or Sharks Tale had characters designed on the way Antonio Banderas or Martin Scorsese sounded. In my case it was the other way around. I think the character I?ve dubbed for in The Incredibles could?ve been a slightly different personality from me. If I had modulated my voice accordingly then the whole purpose of using my voice to get the Hindi audiences interested would?ve been defeated. The whole point is to get audiences to see Shah Rukh Khan speak in the film. But it?s okay. I think it works well. I love animation films. I?ve great faith in them. We can?t make animation films of the quality made in Hollywood. But we could start a tentative trend by weaning Hindi audiences into dubbed animation film. 

Q: Would you consider producing an animation film? 

I doubt we can do it. They spend beyond Rs 100 crore. It makes sense for us to make animation films, but only if we make it on a par with Hollywood. We can get away with lower standards in the average Hindi film, but not animation films. We can?t have kids watching a sub-standard Lion King after seeing the superior quality of the original. I don?t think my production house can ever afford to make an animation film. 

Q: What does your production house plan to make 

in 2005? 

We?re producing a film to be directed by Amol Palekar in February. I like the story he had to tell, and he was on. It was very simple. We didn?t have a big discussion or anything. 

Q: Will it be a typical Palekar kind of film? 

I wouldn?t know. I haven?t seen any of his films. I don?t know what kind of films he makes. But it?s a good sweet story. Finally, it will be a typical Shah Rukh Khan movie. Simple, interesting and nice. Rani Mukherjee has agreed to do it. So the cast is also agreeable. 

Q: What else? 

So far that?s the only film I?m producing in 2005. Then I?m doing a film with Karan Johar in April. Farah Khan is working on her script. I?ll most probably produce her film as well. These are the three on the anvil. 

Q: And Aditya Chopra?s next? 

I don?t know. He hasn?t spoken to me about it yet. I?ve agreed to do the three films I?ve mentioned. 

Q: Why did you tell Aaj Tak that there?s an ice 

hockey match in Swades? 

They just come with questions for which they don?t want to hear the answers. Ice hockey or not audiences won?t go away disappointed from Swades. 

Q: Finally, how?s your back and neck now? 

I?m okay. I?m fine. It hurts a little only when I laugh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

People

Vivek has proved that he?s a real man. Just as he 

had faced the ghaayal-in-love tiger Salman, he?s once again faced (this 

time) three real ferocious tigers for his forthcoming film, Kaal, a Karan 

Johar production and directed by Soham Shah. The ?awesome creation of God? stood 

merely three feet away from him, no strings, no ropes attached. Nor was there 

any special effects or camera tricks and he wouldn?t have it any other way, anyway. 

Even the Bangkok tiger trainer was highly impressed by his courage. And we have 

Vivek?s word for it. Tell us, does the cat-eyed beloved of his need any more ?impression?? 

First 41 callers win Santa?s stocking.

 Rimii

Rimii is one of the luckiest, if not the most talented, among the Bollywood bimbos. 

She has had all hits so far (though by her own admission, she was just a sprocket 

in the reel) with Dhoom ditto. So, by now she should have become 

one of the hottest properties in the industry. With popularity comes the press 

and a starlet needs to speak to them. But, maybe, speech doesn?t come easy to 

her. During the Dhoom presscon, we actually were witness to her costars 

shutting her up every time she began to speak. For the good of the film. So now 

she?s become wiser and has hired herself a secretary to do all the speaking for 

her. When you pop her a question her PA now does the answering. Sounds familiar. 

In the earlier decades, Sridevi had made this mode of thinking hard and then answering, 

?Ask Mummyji.? Rimii may be trying to be the new age Sridevi, but maybe she could 

have hired a ventriloquist...

 Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra

Priyanka Chopra and Akshay Kumar are both trying to make amends. A lot was said 

about their offscreen chemistry and that created havoc in both their personal 

lives (at least, Akshay?s). So how do you think they shot on the same set? Well, 

there is absolutely no communication between the two. Akki runs back to his pretty 

wife Twinkle for lunch, taking an extended lunch break. And Pri Chops remains 

busy watching the monitor and keeps to herself. What professionals! Actors, we 

mean...

 Aamna Sharif and Rajeev Khandelwal

The Ektaa hatchet?s going chop-chop, and too frequently, we think. Ektaa cannot 

bear anyone giving an opinion, and please, this isn?t one. But Rajeev Khandelwal 

(Sujal from Kahiin To Hoga) has been doing just that. He had a feeling 

that his role needed something more. And news travelled that Rajeev had been sacked. 

The winner of the Best Debut, Best TV Personality, Best TV Couple (along with 

Aamna Sharif) in the India Telly Awards was not willing to relent. So off he went 

to Mauritius on vacation. But Ektaa?s a clever little bird, and this isn?t an 

opinion either. She fathomed Rajeev?s immense popularity and knew it wouldn?t 

be easy to replace him so quickly though she had almost announced an all-India 

audition to find a suitable replacement. So reconciliation seemed the best option, 

now. Though things may seem hunky dory, no one is vouching for the duration. When 

will the wounded tigress pounce?

SPOTLIGHT

 Mallika Sherawat

Will Mallika take on Tina Ambani?

The deal this Christmas is to get Mallika to play 

a honey-lipped, fully-draped, propah wife of an industrialist, that is, Tina Ambani. 

Director Jai Prakash wants Mallika to play the role of a former actress married 

to a rich industrialist in his forthcoming venture tentatively called Sauda. With 

the ongoing real-life family drama between the Ambani brothers, Jai Prakash (of 

Market fame) has promptly shot off the block and has readied his script based 

on the Ambanis.

Jai Prakash has expressed his wish to cast someone 

like Mallika Sherawat or Neha Dhupia in that particular role. He has admitted 

that hes been speaking to people who are familiar with how the Ambanis 

conduct themselves in their personal environment. But the project looks 

tough as far as Mallika is concerned. However much Mallika tries, she cant 

shed her sexy image. For thats what Mallika stands for; and shed 

is the word that reminds you of Mallika. So much so that some of the Christmas 

wishes doing the rounds say, May God decrease your sorrow like the clothes 

on Mallika Sherawat. Merry Christmas! Or, with Mallika, should it be, 17Xmas?

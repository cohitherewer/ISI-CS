DVD/VCD reviews

Urmi Chakraborty made a fine directorial debut by focusing on the simple housewife?s 

boredom and what middleclass middleaged life is all about in Hemanter Pakhi, 

which should touch the heart of a majority of women. It brought back Tanushree 

Shankar as an actress in a big way. Also cast with her was Mamata Shankar, not 

to speak of the reliable Soumitra Chatterjee and Santu Mukherjee who is quite 

the surprise package in the film. Maxtech Entertainment is out with the VCD (Rs 

149) of this award winning film.

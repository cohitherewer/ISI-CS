We thought Anindita Sarbadhicari had taken a break from telefilms and teleserials because she was concentrating on the pre-production nuts and bolts for her feature film. But having put most of the nuts, bolts and screws in place, Anindita ?couldn?t resist doing just this one telefilm in between?. 

Good for us, and though the telecast was to be on December 19, she said she would at least be shooting on December 1, World AIDS Day. Sei Din Brishti Nemechhilo was not only a film tackling the critical issue, ?I have a dream cast in it?. For her, what was a ?dream cast? other than June Maliah, we ribbed her. Indrani Halder and June together for the first time! And the central character, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, she exclaimed in small point size; and Anindita?s exclamations, even in small point size are, to put it in a hushed tone, audible enough to make it sound dramatic. 

But that was a dream cast all right. And to think, all three artistes are directors themselves now. ?Oh, that never occurred to me,? said Anindita pensively, ?but it?s obvious in the effort they put in. They understand the value of time equals money and how the axe falls.? So, she was happy to realise that that extra mile was coming in because of the director within them. ?They are more responsible, especially June!? she said, raising her decibel count deliberately to be heard by June. 

After Anindita hit upon the AIDS peg, she was also taken up with the ?other woman? issue (?she is also a woman and sometimes there is a bonding between the two women, they aren?t always at loggerheads?). She revealed that the story and script was conceived with Sabyasachi in mind; the character being a mountaineer, a geologist, it could be only him. It could also be only June in the half-French character ?with an American accent and weird hairstyle, coming from a typical broken family from the US?. 

And then there was Indrani. Needed was a mature actress who looked ?a Bong beauty?; and who could slide into the role other than Indrani? We know Indrani?s range; and we could see what was meant by the rest even in her ?toned down make-up?. And we watched Indrani giving a solo take of a longish dialogue with the ease of a Russian trapeze artiste. You got her, Annie!

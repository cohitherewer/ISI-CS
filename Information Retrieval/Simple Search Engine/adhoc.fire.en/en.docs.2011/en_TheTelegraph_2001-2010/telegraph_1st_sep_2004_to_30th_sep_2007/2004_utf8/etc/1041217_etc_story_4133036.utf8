 5/10

If the quality quotient of a film were to be directly proportional to the number of big names in the cast, Ocean?s Twelve would rank among the finest creations on celluloid. But Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh and his magnificent assemblage of actors deliver only a passable entertainer, belying all the hype about this being a potential heist classic.

With the same director and virtually the same cast (barring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel), the film?s prequel, Ocean?s Eleven, had wonderfully melded all the elements that make for a good crime caper. In the sequel, Soderbergh seems to struggle for clarity. You know that like some other smooth operators before them, George Clooney and his motley crew of crime artistes will be back for one last job. You also know that there will be twists along the way and not everything will go as smoothly as planned. Yet, there is a haziness about the plot that never seems to go away.

Three years after Danny Ocean (Clooney?s character) led his gang through an amazing heist in Ocean?s Eleven, the man at the losing end, casino owner Andy Garcia, traces each of them and demands his money back with interest. The solution is a new robbery to mop up the $160 million that will save their lives. The hurdles include Nightfox, a thief whose mission is to prove that he is the greatest, and Catherine Zeta-Jones as a Europol investigator with a familiar surname, Lahiri.

Surprisingly, the smooth build-up of the previous film is replaced by staccato bursts of events and sequences that convolute an essentially simple story about a gang of crooks back on the beat. The only thing that stands out is the uniqueness each of the Hollywood biggies brings to the characters. Brad Pitt leads the pack with his smouldering presence, but it would be unfair to credit him with only that because his good looks so very often hide the fact that he is a fantastic actor, too. But it is Matt Damon who surprises with his turn as Brad?s moronic understudy.

But in the end, had it not been for the ocean of acting talent in Soderbergh?s sequel, it could well have been a sea of mediocrity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

View from the couch

Butt seriously! Even while the issue of Kareena Kapoor?s public display of affection raged in the media, Fardeen Khan came on Karan Johar?s show to comment on her ?cute heart-shaped butt? for the second time in three weeks. To hear an actor objectify his colleague in this manner just to raise a few cute moments during a talk show seems like a case of excessive self-projection without regard for the other person?s feelings. Can we imagine Dilip Kumar talking in public about Madhubala?s ?cute heart-shaped butt?. Or for that matter, Shah Rukh Khan commenting on Kajol?s physical assets? The brash brigade threatens to bash every definition of decency to a pulp ? age, profession and stature no bar. 

On Wednesday night on NDTV I was shocked to hear a senior journalist Anil Dharker?s ?cute? comments on the Kareena-Shahid controversy. When asked to comment on the ethics of paparazzi journalism Dharker launched a monologue on what bad kissers Shahid and Kareena were, and that the pair should employ the services of a ?kissing coach?, etc. Hello, hello? Responsible media persons asked to comment on socio-political issues have no right to be frivolous. The quality is more suited to stand-up comedians. We don?t have too many of those around anymore. They are all trying to host talk shows now. 

Zee has an ace up its sleeve. They?ve started a Friday-night telecast of Shah Rukh Khan-Preity Zinta-Rani Mukherjee-Priyanka Chopra Temptations world concerts from last week. This week I loved all the behind-the-scenes banter among the stars, the rehearsals, arrangements, etc. We also got to see Priyanka singing live on stage. I also caught her father singing on the same channel in Zee?s Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. The capsules are so deftly done that we never feel we?re watching old material. 

Both Esha Deol and Kareena Kapoor confirmed on Koffee With Karan that they were buddies of Zayed Khan and Fardeen Khan, respectively. No affair. Esha also implored Zayed to be his natural self and not put on an accent. Zayed still spoke in an indecipherable accent and misused words, like ?restrospect? when he meant ?respect?! Dude with an attitude and a vocabulary problem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

 Telly go round 

Ring out, ring in...

 Parambrata, Rudranil, Rimjhim, Bidipta and 

director Saron Datta 

Thirty songs packed into a two-hour ?telefilm? ? director Saron Datta calls it 

the first musical telefilm while ETV Bangla Productions calls it a special New 

Year?s Eve musical programme ? is what you can ring in the New Year with this 

time. Notun Bachhar, naturally, has a host of professional singers with many of 

them doing acting roles, like Rupankar, Shilajit, Pratiek Chowdhury, Manomoy, 

Radhika, Gautam, Keka and Indranil Sen. Apart from them, the cast is full of actors 

who can sing (considerably better than in the bathroom) like Kharaj Mukherjee 

? who pairs with Rupankar as the Goopy-Bagha duo ? Rudranil Ghosh, Bidipta Chakraborty, 

Parambrata Chatterjee and so on. Conceived and script by Rangan Chakravarty, Notun 

Bachhar?s music (Chirodeep Dasgupta) revolves around a a skit with a sheriff, 

the Minar Party and the Jhanta Party, flyovers and slumdwellers, Goopy and Bagha. 

So, we can hurtle across to 2005 with music in our ears.

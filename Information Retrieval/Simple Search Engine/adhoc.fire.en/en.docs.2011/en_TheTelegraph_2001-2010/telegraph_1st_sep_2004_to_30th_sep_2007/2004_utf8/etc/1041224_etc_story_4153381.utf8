Boxoffice Curves

 How the films have fared 

This is the story of how a potentially great 

film was killed by the cynics in the film industry. Weeks before Ashutosh Gowariker?s 

Swades released the tirade against the film started. Two days before release 

Gowariker made the mistake of holding a premiere show in Mumbai. The bitching 

never ceased thereafter. Everyone in the industry had an opinion on the film, 

for worse rather than better. ?It looks like a Films Division documentary. Who 

wants to be told about how much the poor need food?? one cynic sniggered in my 

ears. On Sunday morning, someone close to Shah Rukh joked, ?I?m going to the film 

with my spouse who refuses to wake up. But sleep can be caught up with during 

the film, no?? 

Sections of Shah Rukh?s inner circle weren?t 

happy with what Gowariker had done with the actor in Swades. ?It may be 

his best performance to date, as you say. But it?s also going to be his biggest 

flop,? predicted one director. ?Who wants to see him riding through an Indian 

ruralscape on a rickety bus or a leaky boat?? This logic completely baffles. Agreed, 

he?s the biggest star in the country. But what?s Shah Rukh Khan supposed to do 

with his indomitable stardom now? Must he continue to play Raj/Rohan/Rahul in 

all his films? Swades, and to a lesser degree, Veer-Zara gave him 

the chance to do something unexpected. Must we not applaud the actor for attempting 

a sur that we thought he could never get the better of? 

Why is Indian cinema so wary of making progress? 

Why are we always attempting to serenade the status quo, to court stagnancy? It 

was thrilling when Karan Johar came back raving about Anirban?s My Brother 

Nikhil after a sneak peek. ?This is how a film should be. It made me cry and 

think. Sanjay Suri is so good in the title role. So is everyone else including 

Victor Banerjee and Juhi Chawla,? enthuses Karan. My Brother Nikhil would 

be the second important film on AIDS. Like Revathy?s Phir Milenge is it 

fated to be only shown on television for World AIDs Day?

 Illene Hamman

White heat

We have had an influx of firang babes in Bollywood in the past few years. 

We have had the Baywatch babe, Brande Rodericks, in Out of Control and 

British actress, Rachel Shelley, in Lagaan. We have had the half-firang 

types like Negar Khan, Yana Gupta and Katrina Kaif also making waves. Tata 

Young has been here, grooving to Dhoom machale, not to miss Emma Bunton 

of the Spice Girl fame exchanging scenes with India?s JLo, Sameera Reddy, this 

year. Soon, we?ll see Antonia Bernath, another British actress playing the female 

lead in Subhash Ghai?s Kisna. 

AND LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2005: But completing 

the chronological sequence of Jism and Paap, here comes Rog from 

the Bhatt camp and all eyes are trained on the hottest import of the year 2005. 

Illene Hamman, the model from Jeffrey?s Bay, South Africa, is sure to take Bollywood?s 

breath away. If she hasn?t already. So, take it away, Illene! And you, readers, 

read, don?t just drool... 

Yaara silly silly

Aishwarya went out of her way to the adjoining sets of Black, and made 

up with her De chuke friend Bhansali, Kareena admitted the folly of saying 

a pricey ?No? to Kal Ho Na Ho, kissed and made up with Karan. Bipasha and 

Kareena, the long time ajnabees, waved the white flag a bit with Bips going 

for the Hulchul premiere show. But the one patch-up that has really lit 

up the industry was between the two Khans. A teary 10-minute-long embrace at Farah 

Khan?s sangeet ceremony had guests singing, Yeh dosti, and showering 

money on the two King Khans. 

AND LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2005: Shah Rukh and 

Salman together onscreen, again. 

Dushman na kare

Well, dushmani is part and parcel of Bollywood. 

But Priyanka couldn?t believe her secretary Prakash Jaju could go to the extent 

of leaking her cellphone?s itemised bills to prove she was doing a double take 

with two of her heroes. And even call her a cheat. Amisha realised her parents 

were laundering her money and found herself financially and emotionally bankrupt. 

She stood up and sued her parents. But the real shocker was for director Madhur 

Bhandarkar who was accused of rape by a starlet Preeti Jain. 

AND LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2005: Priyanka has 

found success, Amisha has found Vikram. Madhur too survived thanks to a very supportive 

wife. Koi aitraaz? 

Out of court

Major love-lost and love-gained this year. The Amrita-Saif 

split was the most shocking. Mahima smashing Leander out, too. While Amrita has 

had to return to films and TV for rozi-roti, Saif is dancing to the tune 

of Italian beauty Rosa. Mahima seems to have found someone more rosy, Salman?s 

happy with Katrina and Ash?s chugging along with Vivek. 

AND LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2005: Some wedding 

bells, maybe some more public display of affection of the kind that has recently 

become the talk of the town with Shahid and Kareena (or was it them?) lolling 

their tongues out in public. 

Coming of age

With Mallika selling like fast food, we had a bevy 

of busty beauties clawing for more footage and less clothing (in whichever order). 

Neha Dhupia, Sameera Reddy, Meghna Naidu, Payal Rohatgi, Diana Hayden, Koena Mitra, 

Amrita Arora, Antara Mali in different stages of undress this year. Looked like 

it was a summer of 12 months. Even the demure Pardes girl Mahima and the 

very cute Dia flashed their bosom and legs respectively in quest of films. 

AND LOOKING FORWARD TO IN 2005: It would be 

quite sensational to see the icecreamy Aishwarya in the real sensuous mode with 

her reported sizzling scenes with Sunjay Dutt (he?s binging lately, isn?t he, 

folks?) in their forthcoming Shabd and Kisser Kareena turning her bare 

back on us in Bewafaa.

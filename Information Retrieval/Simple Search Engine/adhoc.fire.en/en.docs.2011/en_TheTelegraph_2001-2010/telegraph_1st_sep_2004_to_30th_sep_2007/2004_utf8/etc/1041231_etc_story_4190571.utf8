Atomic bomb, sure

 U2?s latest album shows that they are the most explosive act yet on the rock scene. They are still reigning king size in that splintered world. By Sunny Dua 

It?s ironical how huge albums like The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby by huge bands like U2 craft the perfect foil to post prime musical credibility of the same acts. From how big you are and how far can you go now just about slows down progress for you have been there and done it all. 

So what makes U2 still such a super group they undoubtedly are? Dismantle this super bomb and get blown away; there won?t be room for such corrective thoughts anymore. The fact is that U2 have for once given the world a chance to grind their atomic status into dust, but that dust in fact turns into powdered gold. 

U2 are stretched to their time limit and must it affect their mega stardom? Well, we are talking about the undisputed global rock giants and their brand new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (Universal; Rs 135), so it really should affect your own sensibilities that make you want to dismiss the effort as an overblown rehash of the group?s older material. And that?s where Bono and his boys detonate the neutron bomb. The album makes you realise that there?s no escaping their unfailing formula and the way it just fits into the pseudo-new world scheme of things. 

Vertigo might be the real showpiece of this volatile display, and even as the harshest of critics place the blistering track among their greater works, the rest of the explosion takes you closer to ground reality, which is U2 still reigning king size in the splintered world of rock music. Miracle drug evocatively builds into a somber monster with its edgy guitar work and new world Bonoisms. Love and peace or else is U2 trying to sway the world into odd territory even as the familiar message of peace is quickly forgotten within the innumerable layers of rich, raw, bluesy rock and roll. City of blinding lights may sound a little deliberated at first, but it somehow grows into your veins as a track you will cherish for a while, if not for too long. Adam Clayton?s waiting-in-the-wings bass comes to the fore after a long, long while- as it carefully nestles Man and a woman even as The Edge?s guitar digs caress its depths characteristically. 

The only problem with this album is its repetitive nature that may want you to unspool it for a while, but again, there is an X-factor at work, which makes you want to time up the bomb yet again. Connect with life once more with the uncomfortably lush One step closer smearing you with its emotional spatter and then relish onto some wholesome musical ecstasy with Crumbs from your table serving up a modern U2 classic. Another archetypal U2 composition is yet to rear its spermy head so get a load of Original of the species that has the band soaring into territories which make them part of the rare species they truly are. All because of you is an infectious little rock song that just smears into your senses like an 80s power tripper settling onto your new age musical orientation with consummate ease. 

Children of the lesser musical fraternity who are impressed easily by leading 21st century artistes should get a load of this, for this is the real thing, or let?s just say, even better than the real thing. This is what a real band should be. Nearly 25 years in the scene, relished the highs and surfed through the uptide, but yet atomic and it looks like forever is a mighty long time. 

Coming to the lyrics, there are high points that take you to the stratosphere with words like ?a heart that hurts is a heart that beats? and those that trip you right down the subterranean with jackshit like ?freedom has a scent, like the top of a new born baby?s head?. But that?s U2 the super group for you ? super musicians that are bound to hit the highs, and also superior humans expected to kiss the seminal lows. But fact is they are still around and foreboding after 25 years. And, of course, they?re modest enough to chance you on to dismantling an atomic bomb (read: U2). So, try and do just that, even though chances are more that you may not succeed.

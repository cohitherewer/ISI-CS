Renee?s salvage job

Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason 

Director: Beeban Kidron 

Cast: Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth 

6/10 

There are films you won?t mind wasting an evening on. And if you do, you won?t mind wasting another. That is the way it is on the edge of reason. The smoking, bumbling, late-to-work British television journo, Bridget Jones, is back and still in bed with her Love God, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). Don?t ask why. Few men on the planet will mind her bungling as long as she is as plump and inclined to go to bed with another guy like, say, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). 

May be poorer in comparison, but Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is still funny and the characters very themselves. With an extra 14 kgs for the role, Renee, a Texas-born American, is brilliant. The imperfections in her pursed lips, frowns, freckles, obsessive phone calls, blotched up make-up or mop of hair make her a darling, all over again. She salvages much from the narrative mess created by director Beeban Kidron and his team of writers and manages to survive the vicissitudes triggered by a photographer bent to shoot her silly. 

Originality is not a plus in Part II. And if the humour often borders on the slapstick, so be it. It does not hurt sense and never outrages sensibility. If you manage to sit through the fisticuffs between Hugh and Colin ? a TV anchor and a rights lawyer ? who flail their arms not knowing how to land a blow, without laughing, take it easy. Bad times do not last long. 

Bridget is more laughed at here than in the last one. Not done, could be the chorus of journalists and women?s groups. But this is one Bridget Jones, who never claims to stand for anyone but herself. If she needs a suave, superrich man to be on her foot, it is her business. Cynics say marriage is a sentence, not a word. See a P art III happening?

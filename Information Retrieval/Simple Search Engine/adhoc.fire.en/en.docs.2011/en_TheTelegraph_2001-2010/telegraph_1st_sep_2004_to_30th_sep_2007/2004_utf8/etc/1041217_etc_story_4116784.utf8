View from the couch

Thank God for Adnan Sami. After seeing The Great Rude Show on Zee and Sony I finally got to see a judge at a talent contest who was compassionate, considerate, funny and insightful. Adnan on Channel V?s Super Singers was a super-treat. This week the talent hunt (yup, like it or not, another one!) kicked off in Chandigarh where contestants showed up in droves. When all of them couldn?t get in they got agitated and violent. One wave of the hand together with a few blown kisses from Super Sami, and the mob was pacified. Some of the more happy experiences in Chandigarh included an under-age boy Kanak whose father passed away a week earlier. Kanak sat on Sami?s lap and sang like a dream. Funniest moment: Sami asking a specially atonal contestant to become a murga and apologise for attempting to enter a contest. Rudest moment: when Sami told an over-exuberant (read: nervous) girl that she talks too much. 

After Saif-Preity last week it was a far more weighty combination of Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Aishwarya Rai this week. Lamentably, my favourite director (and Karan Johar?s too) seemed stiff, withdrawn and unforthcoming. Strange, because Sanjay was in the company of friends?though he did mention that he had no friends in the industry. From his curled-up, unrelenting posture on the sofa I could tell that the magician movie maker wasn?t comfortable with the conversation. The only time he truly came alive was in the rapid-fire round when Sanjay gave really delicious answers. When asked about the most overrated actor he said, ?Vivek Oberoi?. A closeup of Aishwarya here would?ve been apt. 

Friday?s other guest Aishwarya Rai bubbled over with energy. Some of the sound bytes that the host had got on the video monitor made interesting viewing. A host of opinions was sought on the question whether Ms Rai stood a chance of making it in Hollywood. Shobhaa De curtly said, there were many pale-skinned girls like Ms Rai in Hollywood, and probably far more talented. Pretty much final, no?

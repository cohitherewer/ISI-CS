Shooting from the lip

 It?s bad enough when a stranger insults you on the street. But what if the person insulting you is a world famous celebrity? And what if you are a celebrity yourself, with an ego to defend? What did they say to each other? Take that! By Susan Granger 

SPLIT AND SPIT 

 UMA THURMAN about her philandering ex ETHAN 

HAWKE: ?The advantage of being well-known is that there are so many people 

to tell you so many things, like about his (Ethan?s) affair with (model) Jennifer 

(Perzow). I think all men cheat.? 

 ETHAN HAWKE defending himself regarding 

UMA THURMAN: ?The story of us breaking up over infidelity has been an annoying 

one. I have a burning desire to walk up to everybody on the street and say, ?Hey, 

by the way, that?s not true.? This split is the saddest, most agonising period 

of my life. I?m 33. If my 40s are where people say it?s really good, then I?m 

probably going to be suicidal.? 

 JENNIFER PERZOW: ?I?m no home-wrecker. 

All this stuff that I broke up Uma and Ethan?s marriage is just not true. It?s 

Uma who walked out of the marriage, not Ethan. He?s very much of a family guy 

and this hasn?t been an easy thing for him. The very first night I met him, he 

told me he was no longer with his wife ? that they were having problems and he 

was separated. I had no reason to doubt him. What he had in Montreal before everything 

broke loose was great.? 

CHRISTINA CASES 

 KELLY OSBOURNE on CHRISTINA AGUILERA: ?She 

is one of the most disgusting human beings in the world.? 

 CHRISTINA AGUILERA on JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT:?She 

wants a bunch of white boys I don?t want. I would scare the shit out of her if 

she came to one of my sleepovers.? 

 CHRISTINA AGUILERA on infamous liplock on 

the MTV Video Music Awards: ?These people aren?t artistes. They are just performers 

? fake and superficial.? 

 CHRISTINA AGUILERA on PINK: ?When has 

Pink not been copying me? In her fashion, it?s always like, ?Gosh, I just wore 

that last week.?? 

 PINK on CHRISTINA AGUILERA: ?Comments 

like that are exactly why I dropped out of high school. Drama is not for me. What 

can I say? The girl needs to be on meds. But she has a great voice. She should 

sing more and talk less.? 

OZZY AND FAMILY 

 BILL COSBY on THE OSBOURNES: ?This is 

a sad, sad family; it is a sad case. The children are sad and the parents are 

sad. And this is not entertainment.? 

 SHARON OSBOURNE on her husband, OZZY OSBOURNE: 

?People wonder why they can?t understand him. Well, you?d be hard to understand 

too if you drank two vats of coffee, two vats of wine and took 25 Vicodin a day. 

I can?t stop him. The only thing I can do is make sure he sleeps in a way that 

he won?t choke to death on his own vomit.? 

 OZZY OSBOURNE on PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH: 

?You know, when you meet a person, you get a good vibe, a not-so-good vibe or 

a terrible, goddam awful vibe? He?s got no vibe.? 

 SHARON OSBOURNE about MADONNA: ?I tell 

you what, I went into shock at Madonna?s new head. See, she?s got that Botox in 

her forehead. Oh, Madonna, I know what you?ve been doing. There?s not one line 

on that bloody head!? 

 MADONNA on SHARON OSBOURNE: 

?She has that wrong. I?ve been accused of something I?m not doing. I have not 

had my face altered by plastic surgery or Botox. I am happy in my life and that?s 

the glow you see. It?s that simple.? 

SEAN AND CAGE 

 SEAN PENN on NICOLAS CAGE: ?He?s debased 

himself as an actor. As damaged as I am, as reckless as I?ve been, I never murdered 

my own ?voice? He sold out. Nic Cage is not an actor. He could be again but now 

he?s more like a...performer.? 

 NICOLAS CAGE on SEAN PENN: ?Penn pretended 

to be a friend. Then he stabbed me in the back. The door to our friendship is 

now closed. In this business, you get enough negativity from the press without 

having your friends dump on you in public.? 

IT?S THE AGE 

 BRITTANY MURPHY on her ex ASHTON 

KUTCHER and his girlfriend DEMI MOORE: ?I suppose the crux of their relationship 

is, to him, that age doesn?t matter. And, to her, size doesn?t matter.? 

 UMA THURMAN on REBECCA LOOS, soccer star 

DAVID BECKHAMS ALLEGED MISTRESS: ?It sounds pretty low. I?m not sure 

whether she?s trash or a tramp. I?d say tramp, though. She can?t get enough publicity.? 

 JON STEWART on DAVID GEST (Liza?s ex): 

?There?s no conceivable amount of money worth telling the world that you were 

beaten up by Liza Minnelli.? 

 PAMELA ANDERSON on SIEGFRIED amp; ROY: 

?All captive white tigers are in-bred to bring in money-spending curiosity seekers.? 

 HELENA BONHAM CARTER on WOODY ALLEN: ?When 

I kissed him (on-screen), no exchange of liquid is permitted. Absolutely no tongue 

encounter. His mouth is a no-go area. And he makes no effort at all. It?s like 

kissing the Berlin Wall.? 

 SAMANTHA MORTON about ELIZABETH HURLEY: 

?She?s not an actress. I wouldn?t think she?d do street theater in Poland, would 

you? Do you think she really loves her craft? No.? 

 Songwriter JONI MITCHELL on MADONNA: 

?Madonna has knocked the importance of talent out of the arena. She?s manufactured.? 

 STEVIE NICKS on that liplock on the MTV 

Video Music Awards: ?It was the most obnoxious moment in TV history. Madonna 

is too old to be kissing someone who is 21. And Britney should be smarter than 

that.? 

 LISA MARIE PRESLEY on MICHAEL JACKSON: 

?There was always an element of manipulation (in our 20-month marriage). I?d think 

I was going to a charming dinner, just the two of us, and then, BAM! There would 

be paparazzi all over us. He didn?t get to where he is without being very shrewd.? 

 SPIKE LEE on JANET JACKSON?s breast exposure 

stunt at the Super Bowl: ?It?s a new low. What?s gonna be next? It?s getting 

crazy, and it?s all down to money. Money and fame.? 

 DEBBIE GIBSON 80s pop princess on BRITNEY 

SPEARS: ?She?s got this Jekyll and Hyde thing going on. She plays with her 

image. It?s a marketing tool.? 

 JOAN RIVERS on KEVIN COSTNER: ?Did you 

see the teeny tiny diamond on the engagement ring he (Costner) gave his fiancee 

(Christine Baumgartner)? I told her she was a fool. It should have been four times 

that size. He should be ashamed of himself!? 

 LORRAINE BRACCO on The Sopranos costar JAMES 

GANDOLFINI: ?His highly-publicised salary negotiations held up the entire 

production last season. I told him, ?You got 200 people on the set waiting to 

pay a mortgage. Nobody wants you to get more money than me, but you have to think 

about everyone else.? 

 JENNIFER LOPEZ on GWYNETH PALTROW: ?I 

don?t remember anything she was in. Some people get hot by association. I heard 

a lot more about her and (former boyfriend) Brad Pitt than I ever heard about 

her work.? 

 BRITNEY SPEARS on PINK: ?Don?t be a 

hypocrite and put me down when you?re, like, performing with your belly showing 

too.? 

 PINK on PRINCE WILLIAM: ?He wanted me 

to perform at his birthday party, and I declined. I wrote him a letter saying, 

?You hunt animals and I don?t agree with it.? I didn?t call him names; I just 

said he was being ignorant. Then I heard a rumour that his dad (Prince Charles) 

was writing to me to say, ?Stop picking on my son!?? 

 JENNIFER ANISTON about MELISSA RIVERS: 

?I saw Melissa Rivers go off on me.... She accused me of being anorexic and on 

and on. I went right up to her and I took her down. I told her I saw her on Politically 

Incorrect and she said, ?Oh, God, what did I say?? I said, ?Oh, don?t give me 

that crap. Do you have any idea who I really am or how I live my life or what 

I do or what messages you are sending out into this world? It?s bad enough that 

you and your mom (Joan Rivers) go on that show of yours and rip people apart. 

Are you so in need of attention that you have to spew all that? There is no validity 

to anything you said about me.?

 Music reviews 

My own best enemy 

Richard Marx

Virgin/EMI; Rs 135

Love therapist and ladies? man of the 80s, mush-rocker Richard Marx had fallen 

prey to the changing times. Armed with a blanket of super soppy tunes, he once 

mopped the sadness off ladies? chests with a flair that the fairer sex found infatuating 

and irresistible. The women grew older and Richard Marx grew colder. But, somehow, 

he kept the fire burning within himself and in the smitten millions that he had 

purchased with his heart-shaped currency.

My Own Best Enemy is a brave new attempt to 

re-establish Richard Marx as a fiery heart-rocker, who yet continues to tug at 

the strings of compassion like not too many can. Starting off with the mid-tempo 

rocker Nothing left to say (the similarity to Collective Soul?s Shine 

is striking) Marx takes us back to his Repeat Offender days. When 

you?re gone raises the bar further with its trademark mush smearing delicately 

into splintered rock and roll in spot-on Marx fashion. Fresh, invigorating stuff, 

considering the rather foul traffic jamming up the airwaves nowadays! If you were 

to pick a solitaire and place it among Marx?s finest, it would have to be Ready 

to fly which should also be the weeper to watch out for this season.

Falling, The other side and Someone special 

are other tracks that regenerate the familiar Marxian ooze, making you want 

to spill them over and over again. One thing left is poignant and rich 

whereas Colder is one helluva stone-cold rocker suggesting that Richard 

Marx should be around for at least another century.

Swapner Ishara

Babul Supriyo

Sagarika; Rs 40

Done up in a typical Hindi album style, Babul Supriyo proves that good production 

and presentation make for excellent results. The lyrics might not be as powerful, 

the music might just remind one of other well-known songs but in spite of it all 

the eight songs by Babul are worth lending an ear to. Cholo na jai kothao is 

a peppy number, and Shakal shakal very romantic with musical strains from 

Diwana hua badal in its interlude. One of the best songs in the album. 

The music is by Chirodip Dasgupta.

Esho prane esho aamar gane on Side B is one 

more from Chirodip, with a classical touch. Shibnath Banerjee has written the 

rest of the songs and the music comes from Gautam Das and Deb Gautam. Mon je 

khoje mon is a song with a fetish for ?Nilanjana? made popular by Nachiketa, 

was Babul aware of it at all? But finally it is Babul Supriyo, lending his name 

and his characteristic voice that gives the album its ultimate thrust.

Madhuparna Das

Bajao Tumi Kabi 

Srikanta Acharya

Prime Music; Rs 45

Given that the post-copyright years of Tagore have seen all and sundry trying 

their hand at the Bard?s compositions, Prime Music?s collection is definitely 

a cut above the rest. And Srikanta Acharya?s album doesn?t fail to meet the mark. 

Daruno agnibaney, Tomra ja bolo tai bolo and Amar raat pohalo have 

been executed with elegance. Srikanta?s voice is steady as ever, and while remaining 

true to the original compositions he evokes emotions with ease.

Rupashi Raat

Jojo

Prime Music; Rs 42

This one fails to hold you. Though Jojo does a decent job and the music isn?t 

all that discordant, the combined effect somehow falls short of the mark. Shohe 

na re, however, is a bluesy track that has been executed with flair. The lyrics 

are clumsy in places, pock-marked by banal usage.

One wishes the production was more sleek, though compared 

to other mediocre records jostling for shelf space, this one?s not so un-sleek 

after all!

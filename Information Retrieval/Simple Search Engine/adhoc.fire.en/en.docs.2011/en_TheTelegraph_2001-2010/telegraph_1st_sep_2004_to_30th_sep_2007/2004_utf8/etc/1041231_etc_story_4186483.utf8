The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

English, Aparna

 The lady is finally on to her third English film, 15 Park Avenue, with Konkona and Rahul in the lead again 

India?s best known female filmmaker ? with due apologies to Farah Khan ? is all set to start her new film after many hiccups, one might add. Aparna Sen was all set to make her first Hindi film, Gulel, with Ajay Devgan and Saif Ali Khan. The project fell through, first with the producer Pritish Nandy Communications backing out, and then with the two principal stars showing a reluctance to get into the project. 

At a loose end, Sen toyed seriously with the idea of making another Bengali film with her daughter Konkona Sensharma in the lead. But now the director of Paroma, Yuganta and Paromitar Ek Din has gone back to doing what she?s best at: making an English language film. Entitled 15 Park Avenue, the film will feature Aparna Sen?s Mr amp; Mrs Iyer stars Rahul Bose and Konkona. 

Says the daughter-star, ?Isn?t Mom best at making English language films? Which are the films she?s best known for? Her first film as director, 36 Chowringhee Lane. And then Mr amp; Mrs Iyer. I?m really excited about 15 Park Avenue. It?s one of the best scripts Mom has written. In fact, she has just wrapped it up.? 

Konkona is also excited about coming together with Rahul Bose again after Mr amp; Mrs Iyer. ?We do share a very special onscreen bonding. And we?re close friends in real life. But 15 Park Avenue won?t be anything like Mr amp; Mrs Iyer. It?s the story of two non-Bengali sisters living in Calcutta. It?ll hopefully complete a trilogy of well-received English language films by Mom.? 

The film goes on the floors early next year, thereby putting an end to Aparna Sen?s year-long ordeal when her other directorial projects fell through. Meanwhile Konkona is all set for the release of her first Hindi film, Madhur Bhandarkar?s Page 3 and also to begin work on Mira Nair?s The Namesake. 

Call her the new-age Shabana Azmi and Konkona blushes with joy. ?Now that?s what I call a compliment. Shabana sweetly keeps sending a lot of projects and scripts to me. By some strange coincidence a lot of socially relevant films are coming my way. I like that. But I think a film needs to be engaging for the message to come through. No point in just making dry message-oriented film. In my next release, Ammu, directed by Shonali Bose, where I play an American Indian who returns to India to search for her parents, I think the message has been engagingly put across. But you must excuse my American accent in Ammu. It isn?t half as good as my Tamil in Mr amp; Mrs Iyer, ha-ha.?

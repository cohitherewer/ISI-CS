 Darshan of the Week

Religious minded that he is, Akshay Kumar recently 

hired a private jet for a special darshan of Mata Vaishno Devi. After his visit 

to the mandir he wanted to pay a visit to the Golden Temple, as well. Though security 

was a problem, there was no stopping Akshay. He decided to disguise himself as 

a Sardar, turban and all. And mingled with the crowd without even raising a whisker. 

Now you know why we say, Jai Akshay di. 

 Reema Sen

Reema's golden run 

There?s no trace of Reema Sen in Bollywood after Aan ? Men At Work or Tollywood 

after Anjan Das? Iti Srikanta. But that doesn?t mean she?s out of work 

or anything. She?s, on the contrary, on a golden run in the South. Well, film 

producers out there are mighty pleased with the ?No Problem Girl?. She is a complete 

hassle-free artiste, dedicated to her films and work. She has no boyfriends, doesn?t 

hang it all out though doesn?t throw nakhras if she has to expose, ever 

willing to do those jhatkas for item numbers or torrid tosses in bed in 

art films. Her recent South movies (Chellame, Giri) are runaway hits, too. 

So, there!

 Zayed Khan

Another Cool Khan? 

Zayed Khan has had a great time while shooting for Shabd in Goa. He was 

a very happy man given the opportunity to work with the international beauty Ash. 

But what makes him happier is the link-up with Ash. But that?s obvious considering 

the up-close scenes between the two. And heir to the great Khan-daani passion 

he is preening away. So, first he went on and on with the game of going through 

the regular denials. Then he admitted they had a great time during the shoots 

of Shabd. Seems they went on a drinking spree and celebrated life. Zayed 

not only doesn?t deny these rumours but cleverly adds fuel to the fire, saying, 

?She is a very attractive woman and I am attracted to her. It?s most natural for 

every man to be smitten by her.? Another Cool Khan? Thankfully, Vivek wasn?t around 

to change all that. Or make 42 phonecalls or something. But not to worry, Vivek, 

Zayed and girlfriend Malaika have announced that they?ll be tying the knot December 

next year.

 Alyy Khan

And a Khan cools his heels 

Yet another sacrifice at the Ektaa altar. This time it is Alyy Khan from her latest 

Balaji saga, K. Street Pali Hill. It was an unceremonious exit and the 

anchor turned actor is now pretty vocal about it. The blow came when he was just 

getting ready for his shots. The cameraman broke the news to him, ?You have been 

replaced.? When Ektaa scrapped the previous director, Hansal Mehta, and replaced 

him with Gary Bhinder, he was asked to reshoot all the episodes. This delayed 

the project and Alyy being a busy TV personality had to take leave to attend some 

pre-scheduled shows. But when he got back he was shown the door thataway. Thinking 

back, Alyy had actually wanted to quit after having shot for a day or two, but 

was lured with a hefty sum which was far more than what his costars were getting. 

And Ektaa being Ektaa struck back at the very first opportunity. While his costars 

are keeping mum about the issue Alyy makes no bones about the set-up at Ektaa 

being ?very disorganised and claustrophobic?.

Koena, item by item 

 Koena Mitra

She refuses to be categorised as an item girl anymore 

though she made it to Musafir the item number way. Now that shes landed 

a role in the film opposite Anil Kapoor and Sunjay Dutt (they thought I 

could handle the role) she now wants to put all her item numbers and music 

videos behind her. Though people associate her with the Nikal le bhaiye number 

in Road, but Koena Mitra, on the basis of her teeny weeny role in Musafir, suddenly 

wants to be known as nothing but an actress.

 And why not? She has waited for this, for one whole year. She was supposedly 

offered a sensational number in The Rising with Aamir Khan which she refused. 

But what shes accepted is a no inhibitions about exposing on screen 

attitude. Of course, it comes with the tagline Provided the character 

and the script demand it. On that, shes bagged Insan, opposite Ajay 

Devgan, a Rajkumar Santoshi film where shes shown in a bikini in the swimming 

pool with Ajay.

 She of course feels its not vulgar and cheap since it is 

a romantic moment between the husband and wife. I will never do unnecessary 

scenes with sexual overtones which are used to sell the film, she says and 

shes firm on that. Now, how often have we heard that, though?

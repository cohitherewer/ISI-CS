The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

View from the couch

Life is all about khushi and gham. Just after I saw Rajdeep Sardesai talking to an assortment of eggheads on the importance of Narasimha Rao, along came Star One?s The Great Indian Comedy Show where the host did a wacky takeoff on Jingle Bells as Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav would probably sing it. Funny stuff, though I wonder how amused Mr Yadav would be. Some time ago Shekhar Suman almost made a career out of imitating Bihar?s most parodied personality. Now, of course, he amuses himself interviewing wannabes, never-could-bes and never-beens. 

Nowadays it?s hard to keep a straight face when starlets tell you tall tales about themselves. I?d rather watch women of substance whose clothes match their dignity on camera and who have a body of work to speak about like Deepti Naval who was so dignified, articulate and pleasant on NDTV?s 24/7. Sad to say her interviewer was a complete dud, asking ridiculous questions about Deepti?s new book of poetry. 

Mahesh Bhatt hosted what was a potentially interesting year-end wrap-up on Zee News on Tuesday night where he discussed the various categories of achievers during the year. Bhatt didn?t seem very comfortable with the format or announcing categories like ?the best bomb patakas of the year?. Bomb pataka? Isn?t that a rather rude way of addressing ladies? Bhatt seemed to go through the motions on the year?s motion pictures without any emotions. 

Woman power was on full display at the Mrs India contest on Zee where the ladies bravely ploughed through the questions posed by the judges like Sunjay Dutt and Preity Zinta. Anchor Sajid Khan was his usual rude self. He badgered all the judges including the show?s organiser, Mrs Maureen Wadia, who good-naturedly told Sajid to put a lid on his voluble fits. 

The same night in MTV?s Immie awards Zayed Khan put up a truly energetic show. His performance of all the nominated songs of the year was so in-sync and so brave, I thought they should?ve given him a special award. 

Hrithik Roshan came to receive his award and thanked his neck, left arm, right leg, etc, etc. Oh, sense of humour about awards, is it? Wait till the jury hears about this.

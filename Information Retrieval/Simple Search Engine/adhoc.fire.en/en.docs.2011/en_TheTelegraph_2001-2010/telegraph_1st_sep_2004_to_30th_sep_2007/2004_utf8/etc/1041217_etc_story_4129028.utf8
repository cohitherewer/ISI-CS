The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

What?s up on the Bolly border

If Mumbai looks glamour-stripped it?s because 

so much of Bollywood is out of town right now. Vivek Oberoi, John Abraham and 

Ajay Devgan are shooting for Sohan Shah?s Kaal in Bangkok. Kareena and 

Salman Khan are in Ooty shooting for Piyadarshan?s new film, which may be called 

either Rang or Rahen Na Rahen Hum depending on availability of title. 

Early on Monday morning, Kareena is ready on location, makeup slapped on. ?Have 

to be, no?? she mumbles drowsily. Kareena isn?t feeling as elated as she generally 

does. Shahid Kapur is leaving for a longish shooting stint of Mahesh Manjrekar?s 

Life Ho To Aisi in Egypt. Parting, as we know, is such sweet-sorrow. ?But 

we can?t let our respective work suffer just to be together. He has to do his 

work, and I?ve to do mine.? 

Something beyond the expected is what Sanjay Leela Bhansali will give audiences when Black opens next month. We?ve had audiences excited about various films at various times. But have you seen audiences get so excited over the trailer of a film? On the day the trailer started (Sunday) on the etc channel, Bollywood has suddenly awakened to a new dawn. Everyone from Jaya Bachchan in Delhi to Manoj Bajpai in Mumbai called to comment on the quality of the trailer of Black. That, in a nutshell, is the magic of Sanjay Leela Bhansali. No filmmaker excites, stimulates and nurtures the aesthetic senses like him. That explains why there?s always such a huge rush to get into his projects. All the speculation and assumption being made by the crystal-ball readers in Mumbai is based on whispers heard in socialite circles.

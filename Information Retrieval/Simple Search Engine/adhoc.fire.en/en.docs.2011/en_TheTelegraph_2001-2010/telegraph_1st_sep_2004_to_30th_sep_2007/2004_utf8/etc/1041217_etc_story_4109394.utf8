The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

MUSIC REVIEWS

 Best of Def Leppard 

Def Leppard 

Universal; Rs 135

 What we have here is a clutch of the monster hits from this monster UK band. What we don?t have here are cuts that make the band the inspirational set of rock musicians they are. To the commercial world, Hysteria is rated as one of the greatest rock albums produced ever and so we have tracks that have been ferociously pinned onto the Lep graph like flags that needn?t be unfurled to proudly fly. Let there be breeze or the lack of it but Animal, Love bites, Hyteria, Armageddon it, Pour some sugar on me and Rocket will surely stand tall in any premier musical compilation worth its wind.

 But where is Let it go? From On Through The Night? What about Foolin? and Action not words from Pyromania? Rock, Rock til? you drop? Questions that you will ask as a Def Leppard fan, but if it?s questions you want to get into, this assemblage turns meaningless. It may be an obligatory thing for bands like Def Leppard to repeat tracks and build up a so-called ?best of? compilation every 10 years or so, but here is just what record companies should take note of. Bring to the fore songs that made the band a motivational force rather than once again showcasing their foregone commercial strengths. Not only does it help in revitalising your investment but is also a good way to inject some great works of the past into a pale-ish world that may benefit from it; in its own tiny but meaningful way.

Sunny Dua

 Ghuri 

Srikanta Acharya 

Sagarika; Rs 42

 This one is a rather bubbly compilation where Srikanta Acharya has strayed from the apparent seriousness of Bajao Tumi Kabi. Supposedly an improvisation of conversations among lyricists Srikanta, Kingshuk Chattopadhyay, Arna Sil and Saikat Kundu, the songs have a wanton character to them. Worth mentioning are Teendana and Tomay debar moto, all of them effusive yet melodious, careful and yet careless. Joy Sarkar?s music arrangement is superb, and extracts the most out of a bare minimum of instruments. Meyeta is an example of this deft handling.

 Monihar 

Jojo 

Bhavna; Rs 40

 Okay, so Indrani Sen did it once upon a time. Now, you could try listening to Rabindrasangeet in Hindi sung by Jojo. A far cry from her crooning, this album tests Jojo?s voice to the extreme, but she emerges with fair marks. In fact, on tracks like Aaj chandni raat hai (Aj jyotsna raatey) and Woh din suhana (Shedin dujoney), she does a commendable job. Translators Jalaj Bhaduri and Sushil Gupta (on Tum jo bhi kaho bandhu) are okay with the lyrics. But they falter in places, and on tracks like Jis raat mere dwaar (Je raatey mor duar guli), Bhaduri?s way with words have been tested to the limit.

Anirban Das Mahapatra

 Ma 

Pratiek Chowdhury and Chandrima Roychowdhury

Raga; Rs 40

 This is more of Chandrima?s album and Pratiek has just hopped in at times probably to add some weight to it. Chandrima Roychowdhury?s voice has a freshness that makes the numbers quite entertaining especially Timir raate and Diner sheshe. The chorus approach to the opening number, Ma, and to Samal samal adds a touch of innovation to the album.

 Lokenath Bhajan 

Maheshranjan Shome 

Sagarika; Rs 35

 An album dedicated to Baba Lokenath will undoubtedly have a huge fan following considering the innumerable disciples of the popular guru. Composed by Paritosh Biswas, set to tune by Gautam Sebgupta, Swapan Mashcharak and sung by Maheshranjan Shome, Lokenath Bhajan adds a new feather to the bhajan cap.

Saheli Mitra

 Aitraaz

Music: Himesh Reshammiya

Lyrics: Sameer 

Sony Music; Rs 55

 You jump start, literally, with Aankhen bandh karke jo ek chehra nazar aaya; hey, this has got to be Nadeem Shravan! The loop is exactly Dil ne yeh kaha hai dil se (Dhadkan). But Udit Narayan and Alka Yagnik bend it a little from there. Woh tasavvur, this time defining pyaar instead of ishq, is good singalong though the quaintly worded Tala tum tala tum and Gela gela gela (Adnan Sami, Sinidhi Chauhan) are the unusual exotica. The one that fails completely is the boldly worded I want to make love to you (Sunidhi) Much too affected.

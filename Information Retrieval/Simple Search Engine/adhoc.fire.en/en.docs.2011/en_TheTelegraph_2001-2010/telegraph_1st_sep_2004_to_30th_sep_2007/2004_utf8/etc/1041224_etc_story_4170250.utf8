DVD/VCD reviews

In the Western Classics series, Maxtech Entertainment has released the VCD of 

Django (Rs 199), a cult ?spaghetti western? of 1964. Directed by Sergio 

Corbucci, it is best remembered for the then-grunge look of the blue-eyed macho 

man Franco Nero in the title role, lugging along the coffin of his wife in pursuit 

of her killers. The coffin turns out to be the carrier of his deadly machine gun. 

That comes in handy in the climax of the action packed pistolero picture which 

has excellent photography and music as well. Remember the song which trails him, 

 Django! You?ve lost her forever...? Relive the classic cowboy cinema.

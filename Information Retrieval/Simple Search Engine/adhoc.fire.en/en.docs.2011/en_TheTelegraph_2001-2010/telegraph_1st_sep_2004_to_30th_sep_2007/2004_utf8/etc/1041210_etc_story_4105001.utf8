The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

A-a-action! At last!

 Glitches, wild terrain, raw cast in the main. But that?s how a rookie film is made. By Anil Grover

Ravi Ojha may have taken Rs 3 crore plus to say, Abar Aashbo Phire on the big screen, and he will, we are sure. But in a much smaller way, C. Kaushik seems to be paying him a compliment. A chit of a guy with a trendy goatee and the rest of the ?youthful? paraphernalia about him, is almost through with his first feature film which is titled, Tobu Aaste Hobey Phire. 

The trip to the site, off Ghatsila, made us feel like it was a campus film, what with a raw cast and crew (barring Madhabi Mukherjee and Shilajit) and far too many characters (half of them have shot in Calcutta already). Understandably, there were glitches and gaffes aplenty with everyone doing everything, and sometimes ending up with nobody doing anything. What good fun, as most of them would say, anyway! In the train itself, the graceful Madhabi Mukherjee kept her counsel, without any fuss, and Shilajit, looking like a hiker, seemed to be carrying only a handkerchief in his backpack. And to think the star was going for a four-day outdoor shoot! A stickler for his 40 winks (rather, eight hours of sleep every day), Shilajit promptly went into deep slumber, oblivious of the digs at him and banter in the coach. Waking up with a huge grin only on arrival and on being ribbed by Kaushik that he was going to retitle the film, Ghatsilay Shilajit. 

At Ghatsila station, the art director and guide to Kaushik, Gour Dasgupta, took charge; and not for nothing is he nicknamed Bossda. But in the hour-long drive from there, it was Shilajit in his element, and till we arrived at the near-natural farmhouse, where we were to stay and shoot, it was the raconteur par excellence. At Bhalo Pahar, it was the dashing Kamal Chakraborty and his quietly efficient assistant, Jayati Chakravorty, who brought us as close to nature as possible within parameters of basic amenities. 

You could call it a major glitch, but the crew and their equipment van from Calcutta was still to arrive and no shoot was possible the whole day. Well into the night, no news about them, by which time the producer, Debabrata Soo, and Kaushik especially began having kittens. As it is, no shoot is possible after sundown there because of the possibility of your bumping into a jay walker known as a wild elephant. In any case, we were discreetly told that the entire area was also pretty volatile with the MCC planting mines at strategic places. Just a few days earlier, we were informed, a police officer had got mined off just near there. There was a collective gulp from all of us, all keeping brave faces though. To cap it all, no landlines there and no cell network. Only next morning, news trickled in that the crew had arrived around 2 am. 

In an interesting default, everybody joined in with a lively adda through the night, whether to keep up spirits (by downing them), talking about them (Gargi Roy was a firm believer in ghosts), or just plain worrying and drinking himself silly about the lost crew (Kaushik). Shilajit was having migraine problems and just wasn?t up to belting out some numbers for us, but gamely kept us company. But the biggest revelation was of Madhabi so sportingly adding voice to the impromptu antakshari and joke-cracking and recounting of tales and anecdotes from her past and heyday shoots. Hardly the glum schoolmarm that she projects initially. 

But the morning told the day again. For infrastructural reasons, hardly a few scenes could be shot till early sundown. With Debabrata Soo enthusiastically pitching himself into the fray, handycam in hand, suggesting a change here and there to the director, ordering the makeup man to rectify a minute flaw on Kakoli Chowdhury?s face (who was also jesting that her wardrobe of plain cotton nighties was the cheapest; she plays a wheelchair-ridden girl throughout)... While Rick Roy quietly standing by to do as he would be told, to make up for all the serenity was Sirin Sarkar (real name: Serene, would you believe it?). If there is a powercut anywhere, she?s the one to light up the place. Her parents would have done better, if they had known, to have named her Bindaas.

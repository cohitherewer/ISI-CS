DVD/VCD reviews

Patalghar, or The Underground Chamber, as 

it has been titled in English, may not have ?happened? at the BO, but it was not 

only one of the most expensive Bengali films of 2003, but outstanding in its technical 

finesse. Shradha Home Video has matched those standards in its VCD (Rs 249), with 

English subtitles. A triple-fold hard cover with a booklet attached, it makes 

for an excellent gift item, this two National and three BFJA Award winning film, 

by debutant director Abhijit Chaudhuri. Lovers of cinema would cherish this VCD, 

so grab it for self too!

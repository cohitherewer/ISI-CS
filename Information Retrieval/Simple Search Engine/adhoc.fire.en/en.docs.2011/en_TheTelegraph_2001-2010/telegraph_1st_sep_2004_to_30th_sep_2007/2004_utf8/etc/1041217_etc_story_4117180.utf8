Double take for PNC at IFFI, Goa

 By Ayaz Shaikh 

Hazaron Khwaishen Aisi may have won critical 

acclaim in fests across the globe including the Berlin Film Festival, but what 

makes PNC and director Sudhir Mishra proud is the fact that it won rave reviews 

at the 35th International Film Festival of India in Goa last week. 

In fact, along with Hazaron Khwaishen Aisi, Chameli the Kareena starrer also ran to a packed house despite being a re-released film. For the maker, Sudhir Mishra, it was a step in the right direction. Expressing his gratitude to the jury, Mishra was straight with his reply, ?Hope the acclaim doesn?t stop here,? said the National Award winner (for Main Zinda Hoon in 1989). 

Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, if one can recall, had a tough time with the censor board, but now it looks like the film has a road studded with spotlights ahead. Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi is an intense love story set against the backdrop of political turmoil during the Emergency period in India in the 70s and stars Kay Kay Menon, Chitrangda Singh and Roshan Ahuja. A story that delineates the pervasive campus politics was bound to arouse a distinct response from the youth. Word has it that around 20 management students from Delhi were emotionally moved at the portrayal of their real-life campus, on screen. 

Despite its specific quality of identification with the college students, Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi simultaneously succeeded in captivating the attention of a larger crowd due to its meticulous treatment of the universal concept of love and sexual chemistry. The other festivals where Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi has won acclaim include the 54th Berlin Film Festival, Commonwealth International Film Festival, Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, and River to River Film Festival, Florence among others. The screening of these two films at the IIFI and the overwhelming response further consolidated the ingenuity of the makers, PNC and director Mishra alike.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

 People 

From chicken to the chick business. Bala Rao of Venky?s 

Chicken fame had floated a production company called ?Behenji Brigade? to promote 

movies and talent from South Asia some time back. With a lot of flutter Rao and 

partner Mira Nair had also thrown a lavish launch party for this collaboration. 

But after that, all?s quite on the Behenji front. Wonder what the hoo-haa 

was all about?

 Kim Sharma

He proposes (marriage) and she disposes (relationship). Kim Sharma has finally 

admitted that it was the marriage proposal that gave her cold feet and resulted 

in her break-up with cricketer-BF Yuvraj Singh. Nowadays, the wannashines are 

becoming more and more ambitious and they are not ready to get tied down with 

marriage or relationships, as yet. ?Yes, marriage was an issue. I wasn?t ready 

for certain commitments in our relationship... I decided to come out of it,? Kim 

has confirmed. ?No one can love me more than myself.? Not just Kim, that?s exactly 

how Amrita Arora or Koena Mitra think, too. Amrita, after burning up the screen 

with hot numbers has got a foothold in Bollywood. And she, too, thought the time 

is ripe to get rid of her appendage. So off went boyfriend Upen Patel though they 

still go around as ?friends?. ?Upen and I are finished,? she says, but behind 

the scenes we hear that she?s rrrrather cosy with the former England skipper Naseer 

Hussain. Even Koena Mitra, after two hot numbers in Musafir and a bit role, 

has packed off her model-BF Rajiv Singh to Splitsville!

 Salman Khan

While some split, some reunite. The two Khans who were great-friends-turned-sworn-enemies 

have turned friends again. Their dosti was legendary. Shah Rukh and Salman 

were so close that Shah Rukh had even carried the marriage proposal to Ash?s mom. 

But when Sallu created a ruckus on the sets of Chalte Chalte, the very 

professional SRK not only severed relations with Sallu, he replaced Ash as well. 

But all that?s history. What is now and news is that in Farha Khan?s sangeet 

ceremony while the entire Bollywood crowd was dancing to the tune of Bheege 

honth tere, Sallu went up to Shah Rukh Khan and simply hugged him. Both had 

tears in their eyes and all was forgotten.

 Abhishek Bachchan

Abhishek Bachchan chides Kareena. Oh, no, he has no business scolding Kareena 

Kapoor. But Abhishek is making a guest appearance in Sony TV?s teleserial, Kareena 

Kareena, where Kulraj Kaur plays the double role as Kareena. Abhishek is out 

to reform Kareena from being a liar. Earlier, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Brett Lee 

had done the scold job on Kareena. Now, Abhishek joins the star bandwagon making 

appearances in serials, like Karan Johar in Yeh Meri Life Hai and Saif 

Ali Khan in Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin.

SPOTLIGHT

 Kareena Kapoor 

Bewafaa Bebo?s blazing bare back 

Kareena too? Going the dress-drop way like the newcomers? 

Well, we knew her as Miss Hot Lips. Though recently she has mellowed down and 

now when you hear her talk, you don?t have to go running for Burnol. With Chameli, 

she made a very bold statement as an artiste and this brave film also had 

her famous back shot in the rain which became a rage. And now she?s out there 

flaunting her bare back in her forthcoming film, Bewafaa. The film?s 

bare-back still photograph that?s doing the rounds looks like a warning to 

all the Mallikas and Nehas of the moment. Bebo?s checked out on Mallika?s Murder, 

but wasn?t quite impressed, as we know. Bewafaa?s bare back shot 

might remind one of Neha Dhupia in the recent Julie. But Bebo?s back is 

capable of giving any bimbo a run for her money. We have Fardeen?s word for it, 

too, and remember his take counts even to Shahid Kapur! Fardeen was heard eulogising 

her assets on a TV show recently, and she of the the cutest butt and blazing attitude, 

should do something blazing for Bewafaa.

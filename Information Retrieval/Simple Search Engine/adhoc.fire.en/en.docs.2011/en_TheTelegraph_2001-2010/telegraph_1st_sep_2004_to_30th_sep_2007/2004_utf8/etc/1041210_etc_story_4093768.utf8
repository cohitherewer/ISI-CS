Arrey Bhai, not again! 

 In Mumbai, the two filmmakers, Yash Chopra and Ram Gopal Varma, pooh-pooh reports of underworld threats. By Subhash K. Jha 

According to reports published in major newspapers, the underworld is back knocking on Bollywood?s doors. According to the reports, again, Yash Chopra and Ram Gopal Varma are two of the prominent filmmakers who have been issued extortion threats. The truth, however, seems the contrary. On Friday morning when the news reports first appeared, Yash Chopra?s office was the usual beehive of activity?no sign of extraneous threats or stress. And no padded-up security arrangements. The movie moghul sat in his office as normal as ever, discussing the film trade with habitual relish. 

So what?s this renewed threat about? According to a close Chopra associate, ?This is all humbug. There has been no extortion threat to Mr Chopra at all. What has happened is that when Veer-Zaara released, some people claiming to belong to a Muslim fundamentalist organisation said their kaum (community) has been portrayed in a bad light, and ?Dekh loonga?. That?s it.? 

Mr Chopra himself is far from rattled or scared. He has just returned from Goa after attending the international film festival of India (IFFI) and is about to leave for Patiala. Extortion threats? Unlikely. 

Next, Ram Gopal Varma. On the day of the extortion story he?s shooting with Amitabh Bachchan at a suburban studio. There?s not a sign of stress, except the one caused by the work on hand. On the following day, Varma is out for dinner with a close friend, with not a single security guard in tow. Chuckles Varma, ?Sorry to disappoint you. But I?m very much alive and kicking. There?s absolutely no truth to these rumours. I guess the media needed a new sensational headline. They got it.? 

So where did the story of gangland activities in Bollywood get reactivated. According to an inside source, ?Extortion threats are no longer an issue. All filmmakers have learnt to live with it. In recent times the threat has diminished considerably. Such stories will only aggravate the situation. We?ll have all sorts criminal elements claiming to ask extortion sums on behalf of X or Y gang.?

Headbanger?s ball

 Mayhem on the stage leaves the metal frat dumbstruck as heavy metal guitarist Dimebag Darrell is struck down by a mad man. By Sunny Dua 

There was blood on the stage and a lot more in front of it. Mayhem ruled on December 13, as bullets bearing the revered name of Dimebag Darrell (age, 38) found their identity within the body of the slain heavy metal guitarist. Although the headcount at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio was hardly noteworthy, the incident sent shockwaves through the metal fraternity and beyond it as the highly regarded lead guitarist of the erstwhile 90s super group Pantera went down on his last breath up at the podium. 

It was the opening track of the Damageplan gig when ex-marine Nathan Gale stepped on stage and pumped in bullets at a riffing Dimebag Darrell, after hurling accusations that supposedly held Dime responsible for the break-up of the band. He then sprayed bullets at the front row area from his automatic before biting the dust himself. 

Investigations revealed that 25-year-old Nathan was obsessed with Pantera and had gone to the extent of faking up stories of how the band stole his lyrics, making money-spinners out of them. He was also quoted to be of calm disposition and incapable of violence, though his mother angled up a psycho side to his character, which was attributed to insecurities that he felt as a child. His mother went on to claim that the gun used by Nathan at the shootout was, in fact, given to him by her. 

Nathan took down with Dimebag, four others at the concert before being shot by James Niggemeyer of the Columbus police who miraculously landed a bullet on him even as he was about to blow the head off a fan being held hostage by the insane killer. 

It is said that there could have been a lot more casualties had it not been for the courageous intervention. Though the motive is not yet clear, the incident sure did deny the world of heavy metal music a guitarist looked upon as an influencer by followers of the cult. 

From stars being stalked to stars being lynched onstage, the price of fame is often brought under the scanner by such incidents. Twenty years ago reggae star Marvin Gaye was gunned down by his father who put an end to his unearthly hatred, but not after beating and abusing the legendary singer during his childhood years. The killing of rapper Tupac Shakur on an L.A. street is yet an unsolved mystery that the music world is still to recover from. Singer Bjork has spent many anxious moments in her life when she was being stalked by one Ricardo Lopez who tried to parcel her an acid bomb before ending his own life in 1996. Later, a video was discovered which showed Lopez committing suicide before speaking freaky words like, ?I am the angel of death for her.? Of course, Lopez was hoping to meet Bjork in his after-life but the eccentric singer is alive and kicking, so one must think Lopez has to wait a little longer for his grand plans to materialise. Steven Spielberg was saved his backside when actor Jonathan Norman tried to rape him at his home back 1995. Norman is doing time in jail with a 25-year sentence in front of him, and the director is thankfully doing what he does best ? directing with his mind frame and a lot of other things intact. 

Closer home, Shah Rukh Khan is a worried man ? the blast that ripped apart some of his fans at his Colombo concert is making him think; something that he hasn?t done in a long time. 

So what do successful stars do when they are reminded that every rose has its thorn? Do they bite the rose and kiss the thorn? Whatever they do, it?s a star?s life, after all. But our hearts go out to the family of Dimebag Darrell and those killed at the concert, as this is one Christmas they would love to forget.

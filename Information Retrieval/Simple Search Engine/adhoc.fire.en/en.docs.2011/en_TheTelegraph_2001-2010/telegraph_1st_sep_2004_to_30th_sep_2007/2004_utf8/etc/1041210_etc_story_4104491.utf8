The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

DVD/VCD Reviews

Shradha Home Videos has a winner on its hands this time: the Anjan Das-directed 

Planman Life production, Saanjhbathir Roopkathara (Rs 199). With English 

subtitles. Described by etc as ?Bengali cinema at its best? at the 

time of commercial release two years ago, it was screened at several international 

film festivals. Based on the poetic prose of Joy Goswami, it is remarkable cinematography 

by Adi Das, it is studded with sterling performances by Soumitra Chatterjee and 

Indrani Halder. 

Ken Ghosh?s second film, Fida, may not have done too well at the 

BO recently, but it was marked out for its stunning negative role portrayal by 

Kareena Kapoor. It?s another matter that the audience could not swallow her real-life 

lover Shahid Kapur killing her at the end of the triangle story (Fardeen being 

the smooth third angle). Shemaroo brings out this VCD on love, deception and vengeance 

(Rs 149) and maybe a more careful viewing will make you change your mind about 

Fida?s true worth. 

 Did you know that the original title of this film with real-life lovebirds, 

Aishwarya Rai and Vivek Oberoi, was Kyun! Ho Gaya Na Pyar...? Debuting 

director Samir Karnik felt the last word was too commonplace and so dropped it. 

It was also the film during whose shooting Ash met with an accident and so did 

Vivek (shooting Yuva in Calcutta). But the film somehow crashed at the 

BO, too. Despite some wonderful music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, popular cameos by 

Amitabh Bachchan and Om Puri. You can never tell with the BO. Shemaroo?s VCD at 

Rs 149 is rather worth it; you can turn it on and study why for all its merits 

it didn?t ignite the BO.

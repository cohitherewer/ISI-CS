The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

View from the couch

On Monday night Kareena Kapoor was on Sony Max?s Current Bollywood. She was there to speak about her newly-found streak of success with Aitraaz and Hulchul. She radiated an inner conviction that has no connection with success or failure. There was also a disarming directness about her when she spoke about Akshaye and Akshay. About the former she said he was the best actor in the industry today. Not too many top actresses would dare to go on camera to make such an exuberant declaration about one leading man at the cost of the others. But that?s Kareena for you ? blunt as they come. That?s why she had the gumption to say she had watched Akshay shoot with her sister Karisma when she, Kareena, was a schoolgirl. 

Every one from Karan Johar to Shobhaa De is interviewing celebrities these days. I caught up with Kumar Mangalam Birla?s tete-a-tete with De on Sahara?s Powerr Trip. I was quite curious to see how the celeb-interviewer conducts a one-to-one with one of her friends from the Page 3 circuit. And I must admit I was rather disappointed. For one, the decor seemed strained. Unlike Simi?s Rendezvous, here the environment exuded neither warmth nor a detached intimacy. Then there was a certain stiffness about the way the questions were posed, as though the otherwise articulate De had somehow decided to ask pre-prepared questions. De wanted to know about Birla?s average day and his ?time-management trick?. She pointed out how he had attended a whole series of Ramayan performances by his kids at their PTA meeting. This kind of dinner-table intimacy should be worked upon. While letting us know about her own proximity to her guests, she should also attempt to bring the guest close to us. 

Have you ever watched an interview with the BJP?s Pravin Togadia where he doesn?t lose his cool? And if the anchor happens to be Prabhu Chawla, then nothing like it. On Aaj Tak?s Seedhi Baat, Chawla called Togadia, ?tod-phod-ia?. Naturally, the guest seethed in rage and called his host a ?fascist secular?. Chawla grinned back and wondered when the BJP-RSS would focus on the improvement of the ?Hindu samaj?. ?The Hindu samaj is doing quite well for itself. You don?t have to worry about it,? Togadia replied curtly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

MUSIC REVIEWS

 Krazy Kat 

Various 

SaReGaMa; Rs 50

 ?Turn on the heat with 14 garma garam remixes,? says the inlay cover, which also has two feline beauties, one with two bare legs and another with four bare legs and a bare tail with a talk bubble saying, ?I Love You?. And the inlay back has a bevy of blonde bikini babes with the logo of the liquor sponsor called ?Mast Aristocrat Girls? (splashed inside in a bigger way), the list of 14 tracks, the remixers and two bimbos captioned Sreeroopa (mugshot) and Nandini (bustshot). Guess is, Nandini must be the music video chick and Sreeroopa, it turns out, is the singer with as many as four numbers, with a penchant for the 50s and 1944. That should say it all as far as a review goes. Buy, if you want to see.

 War of the DJs III

Various 

Times Music; Rs 65, CD Rs 195

 The album leads with the upfront Aa dekhen zara (apt, for a War of the DJs album) from Rocky (DJ Notorious) and Yaara sili sili (apt, too, if you spelt it ?silly?) from Lekin (DJ Nasha)! But good beat, good rap, and at least some sur in Sneha Pant?s vocals here. 

 The album winds up with DJ Nasha?s English-Hindi-Punjabi bits joining Sneha Pant quite well with another version of the Lekin number, Yaara on my mind. With Sneha going more metallic, but frankly this time grating on the ears.

 Inteqam

Music: Anand-Milind

Lyrics: Jalees Sherwani and Rashid Khan

 Times Music; Rs 55, CD Rs 125

 The inlay card is uncluttered enough to look a little like Mother Hubbard?s cupboard, but interestingly, gives the ringtone codes. The brevity also leads to ignoring the lyricist?s name against his lyric; or are the two a pair? Anand-Milind, known better for their melody, have had to gatecrash into the techno, item song bash. So, Chhanak chhanak. The good part is that it brings back the talented (if not too versatile) Poornima. Last remembered for her Tu tu tu tara (Bol Radha Bo ) and Chane ke khet mein (Anjaam), Poornima shows she?s as good as the next one in the club/disc number. Not so Sapna Mukherjee in Armaan dil ke or Richa Sharma in Tan se jo chunari, maybe because the numbers aren?t happening at all.

Agnibha Bandopadhyay

Sagarika; Rs 42

 What happens when, as a singer of Rabindrasangeet, you try to make your presence felt in a market already infested with Tagore songs? Try packaging it differently. And that?s what Agnibha Bandopadhyay has done with his album, projected as a compilation of songs from the plays of Tagore. Well, for those who know that songs like Elem notun deshe (from Tasher Desh), Mor beena othe (Shapmochan) and Chokkhe amar trishna (Chandalika) are actually from Tagore?s plays, Agnibha?s educative dope isn?t of much use. And that apart, there isn?t much to set the album apart from others of its kind. Na chahile jaare paawa jay is worth a second hearing, though.

 Tumi Naari

Various

Sagarika; Rs 42

 Yet another clutch of Tagore songs unleashed from the Sagarika stable, and meant to be a celebration of the feminine spirit as portrayed in Tagore songs. This one?s yet another album cleverly packaged. But then, with people like Indrani Sen, Sraboni Sen, Runu Dutta and Gouri Chakraborty lending their voices, the production is definitely of superior quality. Another novel feature of the album is the way in which poetry recitals are interspersed with songs throughout the album. A word of praise for the choir, comprising Anjusree, Shanta, Sharmila, Shraboni, Chandrani, Manisha and Sandeep.

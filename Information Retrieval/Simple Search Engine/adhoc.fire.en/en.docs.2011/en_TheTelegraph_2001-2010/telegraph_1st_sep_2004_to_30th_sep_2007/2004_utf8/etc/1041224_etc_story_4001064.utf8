 Idol Talk

To my Hearththrob AKKI,

A self-made man without any attitude and pride. Ah 

yes, this is none other than Akshay Kumar. Akki, when I was a little girl, I saw 

a handsome hunk onscreen and simply could not resist him. Even today, my craze 

for you persists just the way it did before, because you have something which 

no other man in the world has. You are tall, dark and handsome. You are a man 

with a great physique, a man who couldn?t care to know what smoking or drinking 

is all about.

But, of course, you are always surrounded by beautiful 

gals! I guess no other man out there can become the Indian Tom Cruise, driving 

all gals crazy with his charming personality and smartness. It all happened after 

I saw your movie, Khiladi. Although not your first movie, it gave you the 

superstar status. Tell me something, how do you manage to be so versatile? A great 

action hero, a romantic hero, a comedian and even a villain?

Akki, I love the real manliness in you, the way you 

do your stunts without stuntmen, but with full precautions, and the way you present 

yourself. No wonder you have always been linked with beautiful girls! I never 

miss a single movie of yours. You were simply outstanding in your ?A? series, 

I mean, Aankhen, Awara Paagal Deewana and Andaaz. Apart from these 

you were stunning in Khakee, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and your Khiladi series. 

You have achieved something, which is very difficult for a person from a non-film 

background to achieve. With your excellent skill in martial arts, you impress 

me the most.

Apart from that I have always admired you as a down-to-earth 

person. The way you have stated facts about your life openly to the media is very 

difficult for any other Bollywood star to do. I don?t think you will ever come 

across this letter of mine, exzcept through etc, but I want to wish 

you all the best for all your forthcoming films. I know you will always live up 

to my expectations.

With lots of love,

Priyanka (Gupta)

(Calcutta)

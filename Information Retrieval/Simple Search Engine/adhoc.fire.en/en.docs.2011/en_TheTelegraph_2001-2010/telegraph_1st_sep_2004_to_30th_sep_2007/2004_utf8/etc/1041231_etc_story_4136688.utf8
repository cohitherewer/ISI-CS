The Telegraph - Calcutta : etc

 Nice knowing you, 2004!

It was the rule of ?M?, Bollywood rebuilt bridges with 

Pakistan, and films became shorter and sexier. By Subhash K. Jha 

It was the year of the letter ?M?. Mallika Sherawat 

ruled. Mehmood died. Mughal-e-Azam regained lost glory. And Salman Khan 

whispered, ?Mujhse Shaadi Karogi?? to Priyanka Chopra who had no Aitraaz 

to the mmmmmm?.atch.

We lost laughter. Mehmood passed away. But we found 

comic virtuoso in Arshad Warsi. After Munna Bhai MBBS at the end of 2003 

and Hulchul at the end of 2004. Arshad represents that wacky side of Bollywood 

where most creators remained more mired in sleaze and other sordid matters. 2004 

was the year when sex jumped out of the closet and leapt into our laps with luscious 

legs. ?Sex? had many shapely forms besides. At one end of the spectrum there was 

Kareena Kapoor, stunning as the tart in Sudhir Mishra?s Chameli and as 

the femme fatale in Ken Ghosh?s Fida. At the other end, there was 

Mallika Sherawat whose Murder proved to be the most shocking success of 

the year. Even as its director, Anurag Basu, battled cancer, its leading lady 

jumped onto a high horse, demanding the kind of exclusivity that one thought went 

out of fashion with Rajesh Khanna. After a series of ?sexy? films like Hawas, 

Julie and Tauba Tauba, the cheesy genre reached a saturation point 

with a film aptly titled, Ab...Bas!

So what was the scenario for Hindi cinema in 2004? 

Not bad at all! The ?M?pire struck back. During the year ?M? replaced the superstitious 

industry?s other favourite letter, ?K?. All the hits of the year seemed to begin 

with the letter ?M?? Murder, Main Hoon Na, Masti, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Mughal-e-Azam?. 

Then at year-end, just when you thought the letter ?M? can?t go wrong, along 

came Musafir to set the record ?straight?.

Oh yes, there was also Dhoom, Abhishek Bachchan?s 

first bonafide hit that rocked the box-office, and Hum Tum which gave Saif 

Ali Khan his first success as a solo hero. Both the hits with non-M titles came 

from the Yash Chopra banner which, for Diwali, gave audiences the purported love 

legend, Veer-Zaara, Shah Rukh Khan?s second hit of the year, and also a 

respectable comeback for the illustrious Yash Chopra who hadn?t directed a film 

for seven years.

The film industry lost precious directorial talent 

like H.S. Rawail and Pramod Chakravarty, who between them, made innumerable hits 

during the 60s and 70s. Over the years they had become total misfits in the mutating 

movie industry. 2004 saw several major filmmakers coming a cropper at the box-office, 

thereby putting a question mark on the quality and content of commercial cinema 

which is likely to prove a winner at the box-office. Three of the tallest filmmakers, 

J.P. Dutta, Mani Ratnam and Farhan Akhtar, couldn?t get the audiences interested 

in their mammoth star-studded films, namely LOC, Yuva and Lakshya. 

Among them these three purported blockbusters bought major grief to the shaken 

and stirred film industry which quickly seemed to gravitate towards the small 

?sexy? film and back again towards the biggies when Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and 

Veer-Zaara did well.

However, it was as clear as daylight that the stars 

alone couldn?t draw in the crowds. Big-budget star-spangled films like Mahesh 

Manjrekar?s Rakht, Rajiv Rai?s Asambhav and Ahmed Khan?s Lakeer 

couldn?t even garner a respectable opening.

Ahmed Khan was among the swelling brood of disgruntled 

debutant directors in 2004 whose failed maiden venture pushed them towards near-anonymity. 

Other wannashine filmmakers like Kabir Sadanand (Popcorn Khao?Mast Ho Jao), 

Ashwin Chowdhury (Dhoop), Sanjay Upadhyay (Satya Bol) and Samir 

Karnik (Kyun! Ho Gaya Na...) are so badly bruised by the experience of 

their first film that a second film seems a remote possibility.

The new faces fared no better. Except for Sammir Dattani 

who made a strong impact in Rajshri?s Uuf?Kya Jadoo Mohabbat Hai, not a 

single debutant was noticed, let alone lapped up by a talent-starved industry. 

Hyped youngsters like Vatsal Seth (Tarazan - The Wonder Car) and Shahwar 

Ali (Hawas) are struggling to hold their heads above the water.

One positive trend that emerged in 2004 was the reduced 

playing time of the average film. Suddenly we had a spate of Hindi films including 

Fida and Uuf?Kya Jadoo Mohabbat Hai that ended in two hours. Whether 

that was a sign of a mature movie-making trend or an impatient audience remained 

unclear.

As usual the year was cluttered with scandals and 

link-ups. The most far-reaching controversy of the year occurred when director 

Madhur Bhandarkar was accused of rape by an aspiring actress Preeti Jain. The 

scandal gave a new twist to the notorious casting-couch syndrome in Bollywood. 

Earlier during the year director Kaizad Gustad caused another national scandal 

when a female assistant in the unit of his new film was crushed under a hurling 

train. Kaizad went to jail, Bhandarkar didn?t. The entire print and electronic 

media splashed the twin scandals on the front page of their papers.

We lost Hindi cinema?s most beloved mother, Nirupa 

Roy. But where there is life there is also death. Arshad Warsi, Jimmy Shergill 

and Ashutosh Rana became proud parents. Choreographer Farah Khan and actor Bikram 

Saluja got married (not to each other) and Saif Ali Khan shocked his friends and 

fans by walking out on wife Amrita Singh after decades of marriage to set up a 

new home with an Italian girl, Rosa.

During 2004 ?The End? and a new beginning went hand 

in hand in the Hindi film industry. If in Vijay Anand we lost one of our finest 

filmmakers, it also built new bridges to our neighbouring countries when films 

like Main Hoon Na and Veer-Zara tried to rebuild the bridges between 

the borders.

But will the Pakistanis accept Mallika Sherawat without 

a burqa?

Facing up to 2005

If till today no new face shone, midnight 

should change all that 

2004 as any disillusioned moviegoer will tell 

you, was a terrible year for new faces. Hardly anyone made an impact worth mentioning. 

And those who did, were let down by the quality and performance of their debut 

film. But wait! There?s hope for 2005. Acting talent comes from unexpected quarters 

in the coming year. Here?s looking at the faces that should go places in 2005.

Ayesha Kapoor: Nine, and so fine! Sanjay Leela 

Bhansali?s new discovery in Black is a nine-year-old Ayesha Kapoor from 

Pondicherry. Playing a physically disabled, psychologically disordered, traumatised 

and maladjusted childhood version of Rani Mukherjee, little Ayesha rips the screen 

apart in Bhansali?s Black. According to the director, her understanding 

of her complex character and her interaction with her formidable costar, Amitabh 

Bachchan, was so intense and complete that she played her character far beyond 

what the script had stipulated. Born of mixed Indian-German parentage, Ayesha 

is definite star material. ?Acting is all she ever wants to do,? says Bhansali. 

And predicts: ?She?s going to be a major star one day.? Meanwhile, Ayesha Kapoor?s 

child act dwarfs every juvenile performance seen in Hindi cinema.

Isha Sharvani: On the same day when little 

Ayesha Kapoor makes a bludgeoning impact in Black (January 21) Subhash 

Ghai unveils his new discovery. Model turned actress Isha Sharvani was chosen 

to star opposite Vivek Oberoi in Kisna from among dozens of hopefuls. Knowing 

Subhash Ghai?s almost-unrelenting eye for feminine beauty (didn?t he launch/relaunch 

Madhuri Dixit, Manisha Koirala, Mahima Choudhary?) Isha Sharvani should shimmer 

across the screen with tantalising success.

Sammir Dattani: So, all right. His Hindi debut 

in Uff?Kya Jadoo Mohabbat Hai didn?t go far at the box-office. But the 

Rajshri banner?s blue-eyed boy Sammir Dattani is the youngest and most sought-after 

hero in Bollywood since Shahid Kapur. A big draw in Kannada films where he has 

been part of two major blockbusters, Sammir?s Hindi assignment is Percept Pictures? 

romantic love story with Rishi Kapoor, Dimple Kapadia and Soha Ali Khan, and a 

film to be shot in Chicago to be directed by Pakistani?s comic star Omar Sharif 

where Sammir plays a rock star.

Soha Ali Khan: Pedigree shows. Sharmila Tagore?s 

daughter is inundated with assignments. Having done two Bengali films (including 

one with director Rituparno Ghosh where she costars with Abhishek Bachchan) Soha 

makes her Hindi debut in Anant Mahadevan?s Dil Maange More with Shahid. 

Other assignments include Percept?s romantic film (tentatively titled Pal Tham 

Gaya) with the much sought-after ?outsider? Sammir Dattani.

Abhay Deol: The Empire strikes again. Well-connected 

youngsters from within the film industry seem to be still flooding the industry. 

Sunny and Bobby?s cousin, Abhay, makes his debut this January in the low-budget 

Socha Na Tha. According to Sunny, Abhay is more star material than both 

the Deol brothers. Should we take his word for it?

Harman Baweja: Another industry insider, Harman 

Baweja is being launched with Kareena Kapoor in a hi-tech, slick-and-span romantic 

musical. With Papa Baweja?s foolproof production plans and the hot-and-happening 

Kareena as costar (she has been paid Rs 2.5 crores to be paired with a newcomer), 

can Harman go wrong? Ask Priyanka.

Mohit Alaawat: His debut in a film called James 

is being kept under wraps by his mentor Ram Gopal Varma. But in private conversation 

Varma predicts that Alaawat would be the hottest and most complete star-actor 

since Hrithik Roshan.

Sikandar Kher: Though no project has been finalised 

for this long-haired, thoroughly unconventional looking son of Kirron Kher, it?s 

pretty evident that Sikandar would be going into his mother?s profession. His 

extraordinarily tall frame and his look of a 70s? rockstar makes him an oddity 

in Bollywood. He?s likely to be signed for a film in the near future.

Karan Sharma: Ah, another industry insider. 

Son of former actor and producer Romesh Sharma, Karan is being given a ?foolproof? 

launch. Papa?s of course producing the film, Dil Jo Bhi Kahey, which is 

shot completely in Mauritius. Sharma has also got dear friend Amitabh Bachchan 

to play sonny-boy?s father. Serves him right.

Sidhartha Koirala: Manisha Koirala?s baby brother?s 

delayed debut finally takes place in early 2005 in the low-key, Fun: Can Be 

Dangerous Sometimes. Even if he has only a fraction of his sister?s charm 

and talent, Sid?s career should take off.

Sneak peek

Polar express is here, chugging into our hearts with a very precious gift called Belief. 

A little young boy, who couldn?t seem to decide whether Santa Claus exists, suddenly finds himself aboard the Polar Express destined for North Pole to meet Santa Claus. This journey is of self-discovery and he realises that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe. 

The Academy Award-winning team of Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Cast Away) is out on an adventure based on the enchanting story by Chris Van Allsburg. ?It became an annual tradition to read the story to my son while he was growing up and it never failed to fascinate him,? said filmmaker Robert Zemeckis, a fan of the book since 1985. ?The imagery has an other-worldly quality, existing somewhere between dream and reality, which captures the mystery of a restless Christmas eve. 

?There was a visceral element to the story I hoped would find its voice for the screen,? adds Tom Hanks, a father of four.?For years, between November and December, depending on the children?s ages,? he recalls, ?I think I read it four times a week, twice a night, over and over again. So I?ve been aware of the story since my 14-year-old was three.? 

So as they say, it doesnt matter where the train is going. What matters is deciding to get on ? and so here we go.

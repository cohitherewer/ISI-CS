?I revel in being called Anna? 

 Suniel Shetty tells Shaikh Ayaz 

Suniel Shetty wears many hats. An entrepreneur, a producer and, of course, an actor, Suniel?s been there, done that. However, the actor doesn?t seem to be satisfied with his foray into film production. Suniel has also been quite vocal about his displeasure with the distribution set-up of Hindi films. ?The distribution section of our films, to be frank, sucks,? fumes the normally calm Suniel: 

Q: You don?t seem to be happy with the distribution segment of Hindi films. 

It is not that I have anything against distributors, but it is so market-driven. It is so sad that if your last film has made money, only then you are entertained by the distributors. In case of failures, they hold a producer responsible for everything. Why is a producer blamed every time a film flops? Why isn?t the blame shared equally by the cast, director, producer, and even the distributor? The sad part is that we cannot change the scenario overnight. Sometimes, I feel like leaving production and concentrating instead on acting and business. 

Q: Are you stressed as a producer? 

Producers are a stressed lot. They do everything from start to finish, yet the fruits aren?t enjoyed by them. When a film is a hit, the cast takes away the credit. When it is a flop, a producer is blamed. I hate being a producer, but I am doing it, because I am not known to leave the field, without winning. I will struggle and try to at least improve the situation for other producers. 

Q: Have you ever thought of direction? 

I wouldn?t be able to cope with that. Since the functioning of a producer is something like that of a businessman, I thought this vocation was for me. Direction is a creative medium and is best for those who create new ideas. I can only look after the finance aspect. 

Q: You are one of the busiest actors in the business today. How you do manage to juggle business management and acting, both of which are completely different vocations? 

There is no fixed time that I have set for all these things. I am an actor by choice and work according to my own pace. I hardly have too many films on hand. As a producer I have just started off. There is no additional responsibility as such. Yet, amid hectic schedules, I manage to take time off for my family and friends. I still meet my old friends. I reach home every day at 7 on the dot and take Saturdays and Sundays off. God has been kind to me. I have achieved more than what I had set out for. Initially, people said that I am a non-actor. I fought against all odds and have reached here. Now I want to sit back and enjoy. 

Q: In this industry when a star earns more enemies than friends, you seem to be an exception? 

Because I am very friendly by nature. I am not insecure like other stars. I am financially stable; hence I don?t run after money. I believe in making as many friends as I can. Life is too small for harbouring hostilities. After I am gone, I would like to be remembered as a good human being. I want to take with me goodwill and love and nothing else. 

Q: No wonder you are called the Anna of Bollywood? 

I take it as an honour. I revel in being called Anna (Elder Brother). I am thankful to the entire industry for supporting me whenever I need their help. The industry is such a fine place.

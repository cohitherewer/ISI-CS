 Abandoned boat turns world?s grandest yacht

 DAVID HARRISON

 London, Dec. 19: The boat abandoned by ruined Prince Jefri Bolkiah of Brunei is now to be launched by the crown prince of Dubai.

 It is the ultimate in conspicuous consumption: the biggest yacht in the world will glide into the most fashionable harbours in the New Year. 

 The Platinum, currently being built in West Asia, is the size of a small cruise ship, is longer than a Royal Navy destroyer and drips with luxury beyond most people?s wildest fantasies. 

 The yacht?s details are swathed in secrecy, but The Daily Telegraph has discovered that the sleek 525-ft vessel, also known as Golden Star, will boast the latest must-have accessory for owners of super-yachts ? its own submarine.

 The Platinum?s owners will also be able to use a helipad, a hangar for small aircraft and garages for jet-skis and four-wheel-drive vehicles, which can be taken ashore on a special landing craft.

 Inside, up to 24 guests will enjoy a stylish interior design, believed to the work of Philippe Starck, and gaze at original works of art. They will also be able to watch television on giant plasma screens, films in the cinema and shows in the yacht?s theatre.

 A fully equipped gym, squash court and a swimming pool will help guests to stay healthy and work off the calories that they might otherwise pile on from the haute cuisine meals that will be prepared by world-class chefs.

 A health spa offering every conceivable health and beauty treatment will complete the pampering. Doctors and nurses will be on duty, and electronic security and sophisticated weapons will be installed to deter any unwanted guests.

 The cost of this sumptuous secret project is being kept secret but is estimated at more than ?120 million. The man paying for it is Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the crown prince of Dubai. The super-yacht ? or megayacht, as such giant vessels are called ? is under construction in the United Arab Emirates and is expected to be completed next year. 

 At 525 ft-40 ft longer than a Royal Navy destroyer, it will be comfortably bigger than the current giant of the yachting world, the lavishly appointed 452-ft Rising Sun, owned by Larry Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, the software company. The ultra-competitive Ellison may not be amused since Rising Sun, which was completed in the autumn, has been the world?s biggest yacht for only a few months.

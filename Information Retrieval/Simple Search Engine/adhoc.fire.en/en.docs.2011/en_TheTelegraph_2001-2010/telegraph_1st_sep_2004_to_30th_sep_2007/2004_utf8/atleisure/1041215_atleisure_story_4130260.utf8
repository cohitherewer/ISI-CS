 Marriage is healthy for men 

 NICOLE MARTIN

 London, Dec. 14: Researchers have confirmed what women have believed for years: Marriage can be good for a man?s health.

 They found that men who remarried rather than stayed widowed or divorced improved their diet, with more vegetables and less alcohol.

 But they appeared to give up on their appearance, putting on weight and taking less exercise, according to a study.

 The research, involving 40,000 health care professionals, examined the diets and lifestyles of divorced, separated, married and remarried men every four years between 1986 and 1994.

 The team, from Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, said the findings strengthened previous research suggesting that marriage improved people?s quality of life.

 A recent study concluded that single men were at greater risk of dying than smokers. Researchers said that singletons tended to drink more because they socialised more. They also worked longer because they had no partner to make time for and often missed meals.

 Patricia Mona Eng said that increased alcohol consumption among widowed and divorced men could be linked to the stress of being alone.

 ?It is probable that changes in both social support and stress levels underlie the observed relations with marital termination,? she said in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

 ?Smoking and heavy drinking are each related to high levels of stress and low social support. In fact, spousal support may buffer against stress and thereby lead to reductions in smoking and drinking.?

 Dream home turns damp

 CATHERINE ELSWORTH

 California, Dec. 20: California?s action-hero governor is so busy applying his no-nonsense tactics to matters of state ? and indulging those who say that he should run for President ? that it seems some smaller issues on the home front may have slipped his mind.

 Arnold Schwarzenegger, is facing claims from a high-flying trial lawyer that he sold her an $8-million ?dream home? that turned out to have mouldy walls and a damaged tennis court and swimming pool.

 Susan Loggans, 54, who bought the six-bedroom property in September, is demanding compensation from Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, for ?construction defects? they allegedly failed to tell her about before the sale went through. Only after Loggans and her husband, Denis Watson, had bought the house, on two acres of wooded land on a private road in Pacific Palisades, did they discover the faults, she claims.

 Watson, 49, a professional golfer, said that the damage to the white, villa-style house would cost $150,000 to repair. ?This is our dream property, but it has become a nightmare,? he said. ?The whole thing has been very unpleasant.?

 In a Los Angeles Superior Court filing against the Golden State?s first couple, Loggans complains of serious faults in the pool?s underground plumbing system, 22 holes in the tennis court and mould in the projection room. 

 She is seeking an order that would refer the dispute to an arbitrator, and demanding compensation to cover the cost of the repairs and legal fees.

 Martin Singer, a lawyer for the Schwarzeneggers, denied that the couple had failed to disclose the precise condition of the property. ?My client had representatives involved in this transaction and whatever information was known was disclosed,? he said. ?Nothing was done wrong.?

 ?The buyer, a litigation lawyer from Chicago, has admitted that she was told there were problems. They were told there were major problems with the pool and the tennis court. This is a relatively minor dispute and the amount (being sought) is not significant. We think this will be resolved in arbitration or beforehand.?

 Under California law, vendors must draw up a transfer disclosure statement with details of a property?s condition and give it to a prospective buyer as soon as practicable before the transfer of the title. The Loggans claim the Schwarzeneggers? disclosure was misleading in parts, allegations that the governor denies.

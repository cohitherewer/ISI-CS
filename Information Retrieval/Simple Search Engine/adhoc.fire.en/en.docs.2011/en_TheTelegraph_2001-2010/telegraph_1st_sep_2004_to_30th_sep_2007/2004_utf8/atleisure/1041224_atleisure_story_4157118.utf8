 Experiment in mixing

 DANCE

 SHARMILA BASU THAKUR

 Srijano Chhande Anande Nacho Nataraj, the annual programme of Suchhanda, was held at Madhusudan Mancha on December 20. Divided into two parts, the programme was conceived and choreographed by Surangama Dasgupta, a senior Kathak dancer and disciple of Bela Arnab. The first part of the evening comprised Bharat Natyam and Kathak, a pure classical presentation, while the second showcased choreographies based on the songs of the IPTA and poems of Jibanananda Das and Sukanta Bhattacharya. 

 Experiments cannot be frowned upon, though they do not always succeed. The poem Manush merechhi ami is hard to visualise through dance. Young artistes presented simple compositions of Bharat Natyam and Kathak, although they could not use the vast stage-space of the Madhusudan Mancha properly. The children were earnest and spontaneous. The Hindi version of Pagla hawa was very rhythmic. 

 Surangama proved her class in the bhajan Hari bin, beautifully blending technical perfection and total involvement. Her daughter Lokeshawari showed that she has mastered the style of Kathak sincerely and her short solo repertoire reflected verve and vigour. But her costume was not of good taste in the Kathak numbers.

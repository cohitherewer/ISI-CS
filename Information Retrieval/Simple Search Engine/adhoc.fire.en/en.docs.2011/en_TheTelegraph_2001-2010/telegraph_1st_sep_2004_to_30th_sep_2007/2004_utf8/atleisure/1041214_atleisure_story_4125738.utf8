 Thank god for worms

 London, Dec. 13 (Reuters): It?s not a treatment for the faint-hearted or the squeamish, but scientists said today that worms could be a new treatment for a bowel disease.

 In a small study, researchers at the University of Iowa in the US found that parasitic worms, or helminths, relieved symptoms of patients suffering from Crohn?s disease which causes inflammation, abdominal pain and weight loss.

 ?This new therapy may offer a unique, safe and efficacious alternative for Crohn?s disease management,? Robert Summers and his colleagues said in a study published in the journal Gut.

 Parasitic worms, such as tapeworms, are not common in people living in developed countries where the rate of Crohn?s disease is high. The illness is rare in nations where people carry parasitic worms.

 The scientists tested the impact of a species of worm called Trichuris suis, commonly found in pigs, on 29 patients with Crohn?s disease. The patients swallowed 2,500 live eggs concealed in a drink every three weeks for 24 weeks. By the end of the trial, 23 of 29 patients said their symptoms had improved. 

 Unlike tapeworms which could cause disease, the researchers said the worms they used in the study have a short lifespan which minimises the risk of colonisation. Once the eggs hatch, the worms gather in the bowel and suppress the body?s immune response which lessens the inflammation.

 Although more research is needed, Summers and his team say the worms could be used either alone or combined with medication.

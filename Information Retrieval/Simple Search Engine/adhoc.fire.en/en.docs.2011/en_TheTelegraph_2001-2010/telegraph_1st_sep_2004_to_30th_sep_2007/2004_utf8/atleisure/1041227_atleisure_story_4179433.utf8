 Pray, for a long life

 ELIZABETH DAY

 London, Dec. 26: Those who made their annual trip to church on Christmas day will have to think again. Research shows that regular churchgoers live longer than non-believers.

 A 12-year study tracking mortality rates of more than 550 adults over the age of 65 found that those who attend services at least once a week were 35 per cent more likely to live longer than those who never attended church.

 The research also found that going to church boosted an elderly person?s immune system and made them less likely to suffer clogged arteries or high blood pressure.

 Susan Lutgendorf, psychology professor at the University of Iowa, who carried out the study, said: ?There?s something involved in the act of religious attendance, whether it?s the group interaction, the world view or just the exercise to get out of the house. There?s something that seems to be beneficial.?

 Robert Wallace, a co-author of the report, added that doctors could even prescribe a course of church attendance to benefit patients. 

 ?It was an interesting and provocative find,? he said. 

 ?I think that now, we will be trying to aggregate the meaning and experience of going to church to the extent that one can produce medical intervention based on a better understanding of that.?

 The researchers found that among individuals who reported never attending religious services, risk of death over the 12-year period was 52 per cent. 

 By contrast, the risk of death of those who attended church services more than once a week was 17 per cent over the same period. 

 Thirty five per cent of the 64 participants who never attended church died before the end of the study. By comparison, 85.5 per cent of participants who went to church twice or more a week survived.

 A Church of England spokesperson said: ?For some people, the fact that there is a greater power whom we are confident loves us and has our best interests at heart, must remove the daily stresses and worries of those who do not believe. 

 ?But of course, faith is not an ant colony: there are probably as many different explanations for why this research has found what it has as there are people who took part.? 

 The findings would appear to be borne out by a number of devoted Christians who have enjoyed remarkably long lives. 

 Pope John Paul II celebrated his 84th birthday this year and still carries out a gruelling schedule of travel and daily appointments.

 Rev Edward Lewis, chief executive of The Hospital Chaplaincies Council, said although the research was ?very interesting,? it was not reflected in his experience. 

 ?Going to church doesn?t protect us from all the horrible things that happen, but it gives us the strength to cope with them.?

Q: Is it right for a diabetic to exercise? I am 

a 43-year-old housewife and have diabetic symptoms. I also have a number of diet 

restrictions.

AS, Calcutta

One of the best decisions taken by you in spite of 

being diabetic is to exercise. The benefits will be many. Regular routine in exercise 

will also reduce medication. Try an aerobic workout of either walking (medium 

pace), spot cycling, swimming or even low-impact aerobics. You can do any of these 

exercises for 30 minutes daily.

Q:I am 38 years old. A new year means a new diet 

for me. This will see my joy at losing a few kilos in February turn to chagrin 

as the scales slowly climb back by April. What can I do?

MG, Calcutta

A new year can bring in a new diet but certain rules 

have to be permanent. 

High-calorie foods are absolute no-nos.

It is necessary to have counselled guidance to keep 

you from over-indulgence and also keep a balance. So, you should see a dietician 

and consult him/her before, during and after any new diet regime.

Include liberal intake of fruits during meals at home 

or outdoors. Carry fruits in your bag when you are going outdoors and munch on 

them instead of fried foods. It is advisable to include at least two citrus fruits 

in your diet. They are excellent for health.

It is preferable to eat the fruit instead of its juice.

You can also take peanuts, cottage cheese and muri 

as they are also excellent snack items.

If you are going over the top one day, you have to 

ease out the day after. So if you are going to a party tonight, eat a little less 

tomorrow.

Don?t forget to exercise. It will act a catalyst.

Q:I want to start swimming on a regular basis to 

improve my atrocious fitness level. My doctor has given the go-ahead but I am 

concerned about getting started. I haven?t swum in years.

SH, Guwahati

One can never forget how to swim. It?s like cycling. 

So it doesn?t matter if you haven?t taken a dip in years. Start slowly and consult 

your trainer at every step. Remember, swimming is not about how long one stays 

in the water but how many lengths one does. The speed and duration should be gradually 

increased. So go ahead and take the plunge. It is one of the most rewarding experiences.

 Blunkett tests papa-positive

 London, Dec. 26: An official DNA test has proved that David Blunkett is the father of the two-year-old son of his former lover, Kimberly Quinn. 

 The Daily Telegraph has learned that a third DNA test has been carried out on the paternity of William Quinn, and like two previous tests, it demonstrates that the former home secretary is his father.

 In contrast to the two privately conducted tests, this one is admissible in court proceedings. Blunkett is pursuing legal action to gain access to William.

 Blunkett, 57, was last week condemned by the Budd report for ?fast-tracking? a visa for Quinn?s nanny, as The Sunday Telegraph revealed a month ago, but he is already planning a comeback.

 It is understood that he has been lined up by the Prime Minister to tour marginal constituencies to deliver a hard-line message on anti-social behaviour and crime.

 If his legal battle to gain access to William Quinn is delayed, it is likely to clash with the expected spring date of the general election ? and could frustrate Blunkett?s plans for a political return.

 Senior Labour figures have voiced concern that an ongoing legal battle would overshadow his efforts on Labour?s behalf.

 It is also possible that the legal action will come to a head in February, when Quinn is expecting the birth of her second child ? who may also be the progeny of Blunkett. 

 Quinn, the publisher of The Spectator, was last night bracing herself for further tabloid revelations about her past lovers, who also include Simon Hoggart, the broadcaster and Guardian columnist. 

 However, she told her friends that there was no ?fourth man?, in the sense that none of her other affairs took place after her marriage to Stephen Quinn in 2001.

 When she was divorcing her previous husband, Michael Fortier, in 2000, Quinn went on what one of her confidants described as ?a bit of a binge?. This explains why rumours have been circulating for weeks about the names of her other well-known putative lovers.

 Quinn, 44, disputes that there was even a ?third man? in the sense that media reports have implied, insisting that her affair with Hoggart ended before her marriage. For that reason, she says, Hoggart cannot be the father of William or her unborn child.

 Quinn has also denied reports that she has been keeping a diary that she intends to publish. ?It?s simply not true,? said a friend.

 The Tories last night renewed their attack on the conduct of Blunkett by highlighting the missing links in the Budd report, which was unable to trace any emails or faxes containing an explicit order for the visa fast-tracking.

 David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: ?The Budd report failed to get to the bottom of who ordered immigration officials to fast-track Ms Casalme?s visa. The only way to determine the truth is to impound the computer hard drives of all those involved.

 ?I have been calling for a judge-led inquiry right from the start and it will only be when evidence is taken under oath that we will be able to get to the bottom of this murky business.?

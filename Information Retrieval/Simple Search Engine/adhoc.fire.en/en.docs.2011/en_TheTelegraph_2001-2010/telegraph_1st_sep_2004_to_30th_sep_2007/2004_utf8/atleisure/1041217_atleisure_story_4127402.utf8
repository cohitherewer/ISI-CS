 Tribute to the Tramp

 THEATRE

 MOHUA MITRA

 Mime is a fairly old art form ? in which the sounds of silence are more articulate than spoken words. It involves silent mimicry, a good bit of acting skill and physical suppleness, as emoting abilities have to be expressive enough to produce high drama. But sadly, mime in this country has not risen much above the simplistic and the mundane.

 The 26th Mime Festival organised by the Jogesh Mime Academy (December 8-10, Academy auditorium) had workshops followed by mime shows. The show on December 9, Charlie Chaplin and his Family, was a tribute of sorts, to the Tramp immortalised by Chaplin. Short skits like Rubber Doll and Jantramanab were clearly an inspiration from Modern Times. Charlie as the Tramp struck an instant chord with the audience ? with an excellent portrayal of the actor?s legendary expressions and gestures. The language of the body ? as mime is known to be ? has been fully utilised in some of the most common features of human existence, like eating and drinking. The ballet-like poses were struck to depict the flight of a bird.

 However, the show on December 10 was a little discordant, beginning half an hour late and repeating some of the skits. Also, some of the pieces were repeats from the last year?s mime festival. Certainly, this could be avoided.

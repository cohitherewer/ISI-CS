 One wedding, two christenings

 Brooklyn with Victoria 

Romeo with David Beckham

 David and Victoria Beckham are hosting a christening ceremony for their sons Romeo and Brooklyn in a private chapel built in the garden of their Hertfordshire mansion.

 Guest Sir Elton John is expected to ?marry? his partner David Furnish during the party.

 Among the guests expected to attend are Liz Hurley and boyfriend Arun Nayar, tennis player Greg Rusedski and wife Lucy and Beckham?s former Manchester United team-mate Gary Neville.

 The Beckhams are believed to have chosen Sir Elton and his partner as godparents to Brooklyn, five, and two-year-old Romeo.

 Victoria?s former Spice Girl bandmates ? Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown and Melanie Chisholm ? have all been invited.

 If they all turn up, it will be the first time the five have been under the same roof since Victoria hosted a dinner party for them at Beckingham Palace two years ago.

 Other stars to receive invitations include Hollywood star Tom Cruise.

 Among Beckham?s England football colleagues to be invited are Wayne Rooney and his girlfriend Coleen McLoughlin, and manager Sven-Goran Eriksson and his partner Nancy Dell?Olio. The rest of the guest list will be made up of close friends and family, including the Beckhams parents and siblings.

 Victoria, who is expecting her third child in March, has planned the ceremony down to the tiniest detail.

 To get to the chapel, which has a white angel above the arched doorway, guests will walk past fake ruins modelled on the crumbling Irish church where the couple wed.

 Although Brooklyn and Romeo will have a traditional Christian ceremony, the chapel appears to have two Buddhist shrines at its entrance.

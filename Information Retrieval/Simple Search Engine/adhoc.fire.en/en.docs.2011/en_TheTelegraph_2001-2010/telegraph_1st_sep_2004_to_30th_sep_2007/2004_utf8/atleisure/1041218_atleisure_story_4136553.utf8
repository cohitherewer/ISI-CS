 ?If I can do it, you can do it?

 Anirban Das Mahapatra meets 

 a veejay constantly on the hunt for excitement

 Thumbs up: Nikhil Chinappa in a trademark 

 exuberant mood

 They say that veejaying is not 

 everyone?s cup of tea; that you need more than mere chutzpah 

 to work through those graveyard shifts, take jetsetting 

 in your stride and live it up like there?s no tomorrow. 

 So when it comes to taking a break to unwind from such hectic 

 schedules, what do you ideally do? 

 ?I don?t believe in lazing around. I make it a point to go on active holidays [!].? 

 That?s Nikhil Chinappa for you. At 31, this MTV dude swears by adventure when on vacation ? an extra dose of adrenaline to soothe those frayed nerves! And it?s not something he?s just woken up to. 

 ?Ever since I was in school at St Joseph?s, Bangalore, I would hit the road on my bike or go rock-climbing or trekking with my friends during holidays,? says Chinappa. ?The urge to be out there was too strong to curb.? 

 The desire hasn?t died. In fact, his job at MTV has only boosted it further. Veejaying has taken him to several locations around the world, and Chinappa has remembered to mix work with play, getting into the thick of all the adventure that he can. 

 ?I enjoy any and every kind of adventure sport,? he says. ?I could be doing bungee-jumping, paragliding or plain trekking ? anything that a particular resort offers. Of late, however, I have been into a lot of water sports. They?re awesome.? 

 So these days, given a chance, Nikhil heads for exotic beaches for a whale of a time. And it doesn?t take long for MTV?s man to transform himself into a beach bum, Bermudas, florals and all. Tropical islands or seaside resorts in Southeast Asia happen to be his favourites. ?The Koh Tao island off the coast of Thailand is great,? he says. With its aquamarine waters, golden sand and lush tropical vegetation, the tiny resort is a haven for tourists from the world over who wish to get a first-hand experience of aquatic action. ?Bali happens to be splendid too,? Chinappa declares. 

 Once on these beaches, it?s jet-skiing, water-skiing, scuba-diving or snorkelling all the way for Nikhil. The waters are inviting, the weather indulgent and the mood perfect for a big splash. ?Apart from all the regular action, I try out the more daring stuff once in a while. And one of my most memorable experiences was in Thailand in July, when I tried out deep sea diving ? all the way down to 34m!? 

 But then, there are things even Nikhil can?t do. ?I just can?t do wind-surfing!? he admits sheepishly. ?I simply can?t make the board stand upright and latch on to the sail. I just keep falling off!? 

 A special place that Chinappa would like to go back to from time to time is ? of course ? Ibiza. ?I?ve been there and I would want to go there again, simply for all the great things it has to offer to the adventure-lover. New Zealand is another place I?d love to visit now and then, for its bungee-jumping and paragliding resorts.? 

 There are other places that Chinappa has never been to, and wants to get a taste of. And Australia happens to be one of them. ?I wish I could go scuba-diving in the Great Barrier Reef or hiking in the Australian outback. That would be fun.? 

 Given that adventure-sports have their own physical requirements to be met, Chinappa spends a lot of time on keeping himself in shape. ?Despite the odd hours and the hectic schedule that we have to stick to, I spend hours in the gym to shed those extra calories and work those muscles. When I am in Mumbai, I regularly go road-running. It helps with the stamina,? he says. 

 For first-timers, Chinappa ? we could call him a veteran by now ? has a few words of advice. ?Always have a trained instructor to help you with any kind of adventure sport,? he warns. ?Make sure that the resort you visit has the necessary infrastructure, the people are experienced and all safety norms are adhered to.? 

 For all the work he is currently immersed in, Chinappa can?t wait till February. ?I have plans to go to Koh Tao again,? he exclaims. Sounds like he hasn?t had enough of the place already. 

 So when next you watch him rattle and hum on the sets of MTV Select, you know exactly what?s going on in his mind. That?s what the call of adventure does to you. And unlike Chinappa, it?s something you may well be missing out on.

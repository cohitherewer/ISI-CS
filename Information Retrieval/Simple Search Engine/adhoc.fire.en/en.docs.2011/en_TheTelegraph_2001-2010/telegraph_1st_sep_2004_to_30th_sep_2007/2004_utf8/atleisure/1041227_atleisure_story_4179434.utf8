 Common calendar shows up again

 ADAM LUSHER

 London, Dec. 26: When Julius Caesar tried it, he created the ?year of confusion?. When the British government gave it a go in 1752, they faced riots.

 That has not stopped revolutionaries led by a British civil servant and an American rocket scientist from demanding that we once again switch to a new calendar.

 Richard Conn Henry, a professor of physics and astronomy at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and Jess Cully, 33, from Gosport, Hampshire, a calendar reform enthusiast, last week demanded that the world adopt their Common Civil Calendar. 

 Every date, from January 1 to December 31, would fall on the same day of the week, every year, forever. If your birthday is on a Wednesday one year, it would always be on Wednesday.

 Henry and Cully claim that their calendar would bring ?profound economic and practical benefits?. No more valuable time would be wasted in devising annual timetables and work rotas. 

 Year Zero, they say, should begin on January 1, 2006. This would make the revolution bloodless because both their version and the Gregorian Calendar, used in most of the world including Britain, agree that New Year?s Day 2006 would be a Sunday. 

 Instead of the fuddy-duddy 365 days, the brave new world would enjoy a modern 364-day year. 

 The leap year would be replaced by the ?Newton?, a week-long ?mini-month? inserted in some years between June and July when Henry?s computer programme says it is necessary. January would have 30 days instead of 31. June would last 31 days, not 30. 

 The British government provoked riots by cutting 11 days from September 1752 to switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, which followed the seasons more closely.

 ?Some will grumble,? admitted Cully, who has been fascinated by calendars since boyhood. ?We will all get used to it eventually.?

 Their organisation, the International Association For 2006, now has branches in India, Pakistan and South America.

 It ?works? because its 364-day year, unlike the 365-day version, is exactly divisible into 52 seven-day weeks. There is no ?carried over? day to spill into the new year and push the days of the week out of kilter with the dates.

 Quite how impressed world governments are is remained unclear. A spokesperson for the department of trade and industry, which is responsible for calendar arrangements such as bank holidays, would only say: ?Errm, can I get back to you on this??

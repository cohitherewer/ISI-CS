 Coffee, at St Peter?s

 Vatican City, Dec. 20 (Reuters): The view is hard to beat, the atmosphere can be, well, heavenly, and the coffee isn?t bad either. St Peter?s Basilica now has its own rooftop coffee bar.

 The bar on the roof of Christendom?s largest church opened several months ago without fanfare but many Vatican officials and employees did not know about it until today when an Italian paper splashed the ?discovery? on its front page.

 Located on the terrace at the base of the cupola designed by Michelangelo, it is open to tourists who have already visited the top and want to stop for a coffee or soft drink on their way back down to earth.

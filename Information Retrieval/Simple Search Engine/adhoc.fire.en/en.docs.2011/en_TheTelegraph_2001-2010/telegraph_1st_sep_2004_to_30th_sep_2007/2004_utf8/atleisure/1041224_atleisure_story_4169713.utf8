 ART BRIEFS

 Shanti Bose, who completes 50 years of a career in dance, was the ballet master of Uday Shankar, with whom he worked for nearly two decades. So when he put up an exhibition of rare photographs from his life and times at the Gaganendra Pradarshashala, (December 10-13), it was more a personal moment of passion and emotion than for a photographer?s critical eye. Apart from an understandable lack of quality in the taking or the printing, it was evidently a delight for those who wished to view documented decoration of a dedicated dancer. It was hardly of any interest to a photography reviewer who would have been happier seeing those self-adulatory pictures in Shanti Bose?s personal album and nodded reverentially at them.

 Reflection of Another Day (RAD) is holding an exhibition of Gond and Bhil paintings at the Samakal Art Gallery. Known for long as these tribes of Madhya Pradesh are for their instinctive expressions in the shape of paintings and sculptures to serve as household decorative needs as well as utility objects, their creative output has not reached the wider public, let alone receive their appreciation. Recently some inroads have been made, however, towards assimilating tribal art into the mainstream, thanks to the erergetic steps taken by RAD, among others. Gond and Bhil art is still largely executed in a traditional manner, but the craftsmanship and finesse of the pictures on view seem to bear a kind of sophistication that appears to have influences of cross-cultural fertilisation.

 Collegiate Shakespeare always serves to instil in-depth theatre education in students. The USEFI-Rabindra Bharati-Loreto College Midsummer Night?s Dream had two plus points going for it: the sylvan open-air ambience of the Loreto lawns and the three discrete stages for court, working class and forest. But director Brian Russo?s concept of setting it supposedly in Mathura (Radha-Krishna?s sporting ground) added nothing other than a chance for the actresses to sport their mothers? finest saris. To Indianise, one must not superimpose superficially, but consider the full implications on the theme and every character. The incongruous casting of two men with poor English skills led to some ?everlasting? mispronunciations. However, Diya Katyal compensated as an able Bottom.

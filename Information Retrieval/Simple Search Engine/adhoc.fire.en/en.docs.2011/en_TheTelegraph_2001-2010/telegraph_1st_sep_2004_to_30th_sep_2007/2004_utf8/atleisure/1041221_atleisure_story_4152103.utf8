 Have you called Bula-di recently?

 Name: Bula-di (no middle 

 name, no surname ? just Bula-di)

 Age: 30-something, just guessing

 Sex: Female

 Occupation: Counsellor for HIV/AIDS-related enquiries. 

 Call 1097 to speak to her directly.

 With her area of operation being a state where 6,941 HIV-positive cases have been registered to date, Bula-di sure has her hands full. For apart from those taken by the virus, there are millions across the length and breadth of West Bengal who want to know what the fuss is all about and if it isn?t too late to ask. The questions are plenty; the answers insufficient. And misconceptions never did anyone any good. 

 That?s where Bula-di steps in. Dressed in a natty sari with that ubiquitous handbag slung over her shoulder, she peeps out of hoardings ? alongside sundry models sporting everything from branded garments and fashion accessories ? at every major city crossing. You catch a glimpse of her on TV or at the bus-stop, asking a middle-aged housewife to go in for an HIV test despite having just one sexual partner. She is pleasant, friendly and approachable, she speaks three languages, and her audience ? in most cases ? is composed of women.

 In reality, however, Bula-di doesn?t exist. She is but an animated representation of a doll, the kind fashioned through ages by local Bengali craftsmen. Given form and shape by a six-member creative team of Ogilvy amp; Mather, she is the face of the statewide drive towards HIV/AIDS awareness which ? beginning with the World AIDS Day earlier this month ? has taken on the theme ?Women, Girls, HIV and AIDS?.

 ?The very fact that Bula-di is not a living entity is what makes her so universal,? explains Jayatsen Bhattacharya of Ogilvy amp; Mather. Hence, she is perceived as an archetypal social worker, of indeterminate age and unflustered temperament. She has the ability to switch roles, playing mother, aunt or sister as the situation demands. She is practical, composed, and goes about myth-busting with a smile. And above everything else, she guarantees a sense of empathy and concern, just like the women in any family.

 In her own way, Bula-di also symbolises female emancipation and woman power ? she is a woman working primarily for the cause of women. She also epitomises the advisory role of women in society, having a say in social and health-related issues and sharing her experience with anyone in desperate need of it. If there is anyone as worldly-wise as good old Mashima, it has to be her.

 ?Bula-di could well be the result of rethinking communication strategies,? opines Rajashri Dasgupta, a journalist. ?In their earlier years, campaigns against HIV/ AIDS have always triggered fear,? she says, referring to the murky communiqu? featuring the odd skull routinely used in the past. ?The stigma associated with such messages only helped in taking the campaigns underground. What was needed was a more reassuring platform where people could come out with their questions without a shade of fear.?

 The only solution to such a crisis was ?to devise a mnemonic which the target audience (the low-risk group, in this case), could identify with,? says Menka Jha, NGO director of the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS). ?Bula-di fills the void, and helps us take our message to the masses rather than have them come to us in stealth.?

 And as for the mnemonic being a woman, the figures say it all. Women comprise about half of all people living with HIV/AIDS in the world. Women aged 15 to 24 are 2.5 times more likely to be infected than their male counterparts. The National Family Health Survey Round II (1992-93) indicates that 62 per cent of rural and 42 per cent of urban women have little knowledge of the virus. About 61 per cent of all women infected in West Bengal are married, a stark reminder that sticking to a single sexual partner may not be so safe after all.

 In order to specifically address the women in our society, it was imperative to have a woman as our brand ambassador,? explains Monideepa Mukhopadhyay, deputy director (information, education and communication), WBSAPCS. ?Bula-di doesn?t condescend to address her audience. She doesn?t preach, either. She is not alien to the masses, but is essentially one of them, and there?s a human touch to whatever she says or does. That?s what really helps to relate to the audience.?

 What also helps is her being created on the lines of a doll, asserts Bhattacharya. Known to embody charm and good nature, dolls have been one of the most popular handicrafts in West Bengal through centuries. They are a part of every girl child?s treasure trove in households big or small, urban or rural. ?Bula-di thus comes across as an indigenous voice that can be instantly understood,? he says.

 Which leaves us with one question: who answers the phone when you dial 1097? On one occasion, it happened to be a man (ahem!) presumably in his late 30s. People have been calling up of late wishing to speak to Bula-di, he confirmed. Apart from the gender mismatch, though, there was little to take exception to. One only hopes he will pull it off. Just like Bula-di.

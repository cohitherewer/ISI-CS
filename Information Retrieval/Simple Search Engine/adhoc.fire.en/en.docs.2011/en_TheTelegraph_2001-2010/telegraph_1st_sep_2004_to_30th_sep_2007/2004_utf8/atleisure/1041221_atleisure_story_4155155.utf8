 Beach basks in snow

 Brand (Germany), Dec. 20: Winter-weary Germans basked yesterday in 70 degrees Farenheit temperatures amid palm trees and sandy beaches ? an hour?s drive from Berlin. 

 At dawn yesterday, thousands of people began flocking to a bulbous former airship hangar transformed into Europe?s largest leisure resort. 

 As the wind howled outside and snow settled on the ground, they pitched their tents and watched a golden sunrise projected on to a 450-foot long screen. 

 Designed by a British engineering company in Brand, south of the German capital, Tropical Islands is the latest brainchild of a Malaysian entrepreneur, Colin Au, 55, who made his money in cruises and Asian resorts. He has invested ?48 million in the project. 

 ?I?ve done my research and I know how the Germans tick,? said Au, who sought the advice of the creators of the Eden Project in Cornwall. 

 ?My resort means they hardly have to leave home, yet when they?re here it?s like being on a tropical cruise.? 

 The project is based in a hall of five million cubic metres, the world?s largest free-standing building. It is higher than the Statue of Liberty and could fit six football stadiums on two layers. It will be open around the clock. 

 There are 850 sun-loungers on its two beaches. Behind the beaches, speakers disguised as boulders will broadcast bird song appropriate to the time of year and day in the orchid-thick rainforest. 

 When the sun is shining outside, visitors are promised, they will be able to work on their natural tans, thanks to the effect of the rays penetrating through the transparent roof and into the resort. 

 Visitors, incongruously clad in sheepskin coats and clutching buckets and spades, tumble out of shuttle buses and into the dome. 

 ?It is such a relief from the sad and grey winter weather,? said Carmen Habermann, 38, a shopkeeper from Frankfurt an der Oder. ?It has South Pacific flair, yet is only an hour?s drive away and at a time of economic uncertainty, it?s a good holiday ?ersatz?.? 

 It is hoped that Tropical Islands will boost the local economy in the former communist east, where unemployment is around 20 per cent. Already it has created about 800 jobs. 

 And in Tropical Islands, gloomy thoughts are frowned upon. The brochure says workers are trained to ?use smiles to enthuse stressed and winter-wearied Europeans?.

 THE FAMILY

 - Coffee Break

 Twilight blues

 Coffee Break / PAKSHI VASUDEVA

 In the recent past there has been more than one mention in the papers of sons ill-treating their aged parents, including torturing them and throwing them out of the house. But the case that seems to be the most reprehensible is the one where the parents, in the belief that he would look after them, made over their property to their son in their lifetime, only to find themselves being ejected from their home. According to reports, his behaviour has been sufficiently extreme to force the parents to take recourse to the courts. 

 It would be naive to believe that such behaviour is something new. Similar incidents have happened before, prompting a friend of mine, now sadly dead and gone, to often tell me how glad she was that she had no children. I still strongly disagree with her views, but I am beginning to think that parenthood is now a greater gamble than marriage. Those of us with loving children are the lucky ones. Nevertheless, I find it impossible to believe that children who are guilty of cruelty and negligence towards their parents are in anything but a minute minority, but this does not take away from the fact that, increasingly, parents can depend less and less on their children to look after them in their old age. With the gradual erosion of traditional and moral values, the growing inclination towards nuclear families, the ?me? brigades of the younger generation seem to be inheriting the earth. Whether because of their children?s self-involvement, or because of the incidental circumstance of their often living abroad, older parents now find themselves with less function and importance in the lives of their young. 

 So, all right, times have changed and parents need to recognise this. They need to learn to bear both geographical separation and emotional distancing with fortitude, and this, many of them have done. But crucial to their well-being is the need to avoid being financially dependent on their children. Cynical though it may sound, the relationship between parents and adult children seems to be healthier when the parents can ensure their independence, and need ask for no favours. This, of course, may not always be possible, but for parents to deliberately court dependence on their children for their needs, or for a roof over their heads, seems, in the context of today?s mores, to be a recipe for disaster. And disaster is precisely what has overtaken the parents we spoke of earlier who sacrificed their financial independence by making over their property to their son. 

 The case that was reported in the papers recently is only one of many that I have heard about. No parent can believe that a child of theirs would behave in this manner, and perhaps many children would not, but why take the risk?

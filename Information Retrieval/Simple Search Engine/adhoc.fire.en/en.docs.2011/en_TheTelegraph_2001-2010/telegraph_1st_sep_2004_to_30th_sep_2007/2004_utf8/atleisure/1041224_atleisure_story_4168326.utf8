 Kaleidoscopic view of a raga

 MUSIC

 MEENA BANERJEE

 Rajan - Sajan Misra 

 Indian classical music, like Indian philosophy, is highly individualistic. It offers numerous forms of improvisations discouraging mass or chorus. Duet singing is no less difficult. Pandit Rajan - Sajan Misra, the khayal singing duo, has been able to achieve a rare kind of melodious harmony and understanding in this respect. 

 On December 17 at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar, beckoned by their brief aochar, Yaman Kalyan stood at its majestic height when the slow ektal composition touched shuddh madhyam. Their perfect enunciation of the text heightened the beauty of the behlaawa mani-fold. With detailed phrase developments they presented a kaleidoscopic view of this regal raga. The stretching glides seemed to caress all the notes that lay strewn on its path. Shades of Yamani Bilawal emerged once or twice and shuddh ma took a back seat after some time. Their medium paced teental bandish, interspersed with long sapaat vowel taans, was followed by a tap-khayal in Punjabi set to Addha. In a stunning reply to its meandering taans, an unobtrusive Pt Kumar Bose came out with an array of tirkit on the tabla while the bayaan (bass drum) provided gliding effect. Rajendra Prasad Banerjee?s harmonium respectfully followed the masters. 

 A common bandish in fast teental exhibited varied structure and the speed of very short and crisp taans ended with a tehai which trailed down at re with a glide from pa ? a trademark of Chhayanat. Out of the three compositions jhanana-jhanana, a favourite of Agra school, and another one in Punjabi set to Addha highlighted different contours of Chhayanat. But mor bole was an extraordinary bandish in which the lyrics, melody and the gait of the raga complemented each other while clinging to the beat of Rupak beautifully. 

 The pathos of Gaurimanjari, a raga created by Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and offered at the feet of the crystal deity of Sanand?s royal Kali temple in 1995, inspired Rajan to emulate it. Their concluding bhajan with distinct features of Gauri and Ramkali used komal ni as the nyasa swara (resting note) of the refrain. An introductory lecture focusing on the tradition and style of the Benaras gharana began the evening. The apparent disregard for such an interesting analysis and mis-timed appreciation by some of the listeners during the recital revealed the necessity of many such sessions.

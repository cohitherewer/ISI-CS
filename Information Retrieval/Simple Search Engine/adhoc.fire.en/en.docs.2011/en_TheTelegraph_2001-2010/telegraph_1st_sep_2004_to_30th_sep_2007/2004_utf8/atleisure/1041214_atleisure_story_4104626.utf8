 THE FAMILY

 - Coffee Break

 It?s my quarrel

 Coffee Break / PAKSHI VASUDEVA

 It is a given that all of us mothers feel very protective of our children. We suffer with them when they are in pain or trouble, we go to enormous lengths to make certain that they are always safe and well looked after, we willingly make whatever sacrifices are needed to ensure their well-being. This is only too natural. But should we take on their fights and quarrels and make them our own? And worse, should we carry these fights further into our own lives? 

 This is what two mothers I know did. Deepa and Sabita had been friends for some years. Their husbands worked for the same organisation, and they had known each other from the time they?d got married. They produced daughters at about the same time, and when these little girls eventually went to the same school and became friends, their respective mothers were delighted. The two families lived in separate flats in the same building, which meant that the children spent a good deal of time together. They shared a car pool, they did their homework together and they played together. The girls were temperamentally very different to each other, but propinquity and the affection their mothers had for each other ensured a bond between them. 

 This saw them through several years but when the girls grew into their teens, they began to grow apart. They each seemed to speak a different language, and this inevitably led to a misunderstanding. I seem to vaguely recollect that one girl pulled the leg of the other about something, and she, taking what was said literally, took umbrage over it. 

 The entire episode was trivial and would have petered out, had it been ignored. But the two mothers decided to take up cudgels on behalf of their daughters. Instead of counselling their daughters not to be silly, they chose to take the fight into their own camp. They hurled accusations at each other, cut each other dead at parties to which they?d both been invited, and generally let the whole affair escalate into a ridiculous situation. I would not be at all surprised if they no longer remember the cause of the misunderstanding, but having painted themselves into a corner, they have been unable (or unwilling) to extricate themselves. As for the two girls, now in their 20s, and no longer with their parents, but together, once again in college, the quarrel was just a hiccup on the way to growing up. They are not close, but neither are they at war. Alas, this is no longer true of their mothers. 

 Spats between children are only too common. The frequency with which they occur is matched only by the rapidity with which they blow over. That is, if they are allowed to. The maternal instinct is exceedingly strong, but there are times when it pays to keep it under control.

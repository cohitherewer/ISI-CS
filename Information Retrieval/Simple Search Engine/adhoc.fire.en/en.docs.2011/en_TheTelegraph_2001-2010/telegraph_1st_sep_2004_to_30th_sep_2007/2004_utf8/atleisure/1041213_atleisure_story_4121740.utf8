 Over the moon with Bond buggy 

 The Bond buggy

 London, Dec. 12 (AFP): Those who have aspired to live like Bond, James Bond, can try driving like him, picking up the lunar buggy used by ?007? in the 1971 hit Diamonds Are Forever at a London auction on Tuesday.

 Bids are expected to reach between ?20,000 and ?30,000 for the buggy, only one of the objects up for grabs associated with the life and myth of the fictional British spy. 

 Every Bond film sports one or several stylish cars, handily equipped with missile launchers and ejectable seats, but the buggy is perhaps Bond?s quirkiest ride. 

 Like an oversized insect on wheels, the moon buggy comes complete with aluminum panels and plexiglass cockpit, and resembles the lunar modules used by Nasa at the time the film was made.

 ?The moon buggy is the only one of these vehicles which is really unique,? current owner Graham Rye said. 

 ?With its engine, it could reach a speed of 80 km per hour in the sand. Unfortunately, it was missing suspensions. That?s why it ended up falling to pieces,? Rye said. 

 The work of cinema prop designer Ken Adam, the buggy struggled to get through the filming intact. Sean Connery, playing Bond, crashed the vehicle into a wall and raced across a rough desert flatlands in a famous chase scene. 

 But shooting was frequently interrupted as the flimsy buggy broke down.

 Former husband fires lawsuit at Lopez

 Lopez and Noa: Blast from the past

 An ex-husband of Jennifer Lopez sued her for alleged breach of contract, claiming he was wrongly fired as the manager of her restaurant in Pasadena.

 Ojani Noa, a waiter who married Lopez in 1997, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday in Superior Court. They met at a restaurant in Miami where he worked and were married for about a year.

 Noa quit his job managing the Conga Room in Los Angeles in 2002 to take a job running Lopez?s new restaurant, Madres, and was told by her that she would not fire him ?without good cause or reason?, the lawsuit said.

 Noa, who was paid $1,000 a week, was fired six months after he started the job at Madres, which opened in April 2002, the lawsuit said. It wasnt known why Noa was fired.

 ?Mr. Noa tried to call Ms. Lopez to find out what prompted this sudden change of events. His calls went unreturned,? the lawsuit said.

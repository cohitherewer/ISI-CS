 When in doubt, look up the living dictionary 

 SALLY POOK 

 London, Dec. 16: Have you ever had a boyzilian? Are you contrasexual? Do you worry about globesity? Do you know what any of these words mean? 

 Such offbeat new language, from chavalanche to smirting, is being collected on an Internet site created by Collins. 

 The ?living dictionary? will allow the public to offer words to be considered for inclusion in the next edition of the Collins English Dictionary. 

 Many are already in general use across Britain, such as chav or cheese-eating surrender monkeys. Collins claims the website will give language enthusiasts unrivalled access to the words people really use every day. 

 As long as most people visiting the website agree on its definition and there is evidence of its use on the Internet, it will go into the living dictionary and be considered for the English dictionary. 

 The following have been put forward for consideration: 

 boyzilian: (noun) 

 a Brazilian bikini wax for men 

 contrasexual: (noun) 

 a financially independent, confident woman whose aspirations 

 defy convention and who does not make romantic relationships 

 a priority 

 globesity: (noun) 

 perceived global epidemic of obesity 

 smirting: (noun) 

 combination of smoking and flirting

 assmosis: (noun) 

 gaining promotion through sycophancy

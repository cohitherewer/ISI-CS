Q:I am a 23-year-old Indian classical dancer. I 

feel I need to flatten and tighten my abdomen and stomach area. Can you suggest 

some core exercises?

SD, Calcutta

You can banish that stomach flab with this tummy tightener. 

Follow the instructions correctly.

 Lie on your back with your hands behind your head 

and elbows out to the sides.Raise your legs so your thighs are upright and calves 

are extended straight out.

 Tilt your pelvis slightly to flatten your back against 

the floor. In a slow, controlled manner (using a one, two, three count), raise 

your hips toward your rib cage so that your knees drop in the direction of your 

forehead.

 Hold for one count, then slowly lower yourself. Be 

sure to use your muscles rather than momentum, lifting yourself with your lower 

abs and keeping the rest of your body still. 

Do three sets of 15 reps every other day.

As for diet, try and cut down on carbs like rice and 

potatoes. Also, avoid fatty and fried foods and steer clear of too much butter 

and ghee in your diet.

Q:I am 32 years old. I am into fitness and do my 

exercises regularly. I have taken up a work project in a remote area for six to 

eight months. I have an elliptical machine, but I want to take care of my stomach 

too. Can you suggest how to use the machine to suit my requirement?

SM, Haldia

Use the elliptical machine in the manual mode at a 

low elevation so your lower abs have to work overtime to stabilise you.

Stand upright, and do not lean forward. Do 30 to 45 

minutes, three to five days a week.

Power walking will work your lower body and your abs 

better than jogging, since your stomach muscles are forced to work as stabilisers. 

You can walk also on a flat surface, keeping your 

speed faster than 5.5 kilometres per hour approximately. Do this for 30 to 45 

minutes, three to five times a week or alternate days with the elliptical machine.

Other ways to keep generally fit and to keep your 

stomach in shape: ashtanga or power yoga (based on very strong poses that you 

hold for extended periods of time).

It may be a good idea to learn some of the yoga moves 

before you take up your new assignment. You also have to make sure your diet does 

not get out of hand.

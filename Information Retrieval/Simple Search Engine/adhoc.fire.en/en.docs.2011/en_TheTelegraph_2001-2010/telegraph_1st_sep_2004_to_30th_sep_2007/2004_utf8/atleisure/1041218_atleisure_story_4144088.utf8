 Price of a pudding? Royal sack

 London, Dec. 17 (Reuters): A worker at Britain?s Buckingham Palace has been sacked for trying to sell a Christmas pudding gift from Queen Elizabeth on an Internet auction site.

 Ben Church, 25, who worked as a property administrator at the palace, was dismissed after royal officials learnt he had put the pudding from luxury food store Fortnum amp; Mason for sale on eBay, the Daily Mirror reported today.

 A palace spokeswoman confirmed that an employee had faced disciplinary action over a Christmas pudding.

 ?Someone was dismissed but we are not giving out further details,? she said, adding it was a tradition of the queen to give every member of staff a pudding as a Christmas present. The Mirror said the ?6.25 ($12.18) pudding, which went on sale for ?20, was a spare. Church had not been given one himself as he had not worked at the palace long enough.

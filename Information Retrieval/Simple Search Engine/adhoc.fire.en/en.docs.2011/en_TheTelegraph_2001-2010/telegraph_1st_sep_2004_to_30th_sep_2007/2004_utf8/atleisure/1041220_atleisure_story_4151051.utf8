 Voice of Oliver found after 36 years 

 London, Dec. 19 (Reuters): The speculation is over. The angelic voice of the young orphan Oliver Twist in the hit 1960s movie was dubbed by a girl, Britain?s Mail on Sunday newspaper said.

 Speculation has swirled for years over the origin of the piping voice given that Mark Lester, who played the title part in the film, has admitted to not being able to sing a note. But the Mail tracked down Kathe Green, daughter of the film?s musical director John Green, who 36 years after the event said she was the voice of Oliver!

 ?I knew nothing about lip synching. But I did the lot in a week-and-a-half,? she told the newspaper. ?I was 20 and got paid about ?400 ($780).?

 The film of the Dickens classic which won six Oscars in 1969, including best picture, cost $10 million and grossed close to $17 million ? a phenomenal amount at the time.

 Lester, aged nine, beat 2,000 other boys to win the role which turned out to be his cinematographic debut and pinnacle. He now makes a living as an osteopath.

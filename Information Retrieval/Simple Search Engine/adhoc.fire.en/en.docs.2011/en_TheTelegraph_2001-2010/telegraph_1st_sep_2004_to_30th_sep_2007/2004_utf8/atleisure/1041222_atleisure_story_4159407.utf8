 Mystery car wash on Mars

 London, Dec. 21 (Reuters): An unexplained phenomenon akin to a space-borne car wash has boosted the performance of one of the two US rovers probing the surface of Mars, New Scientist magazine said today.

 It said something ? or someone ? had regularly cleaned layers of dust from the solar panels of the Mars Opportunity probe while it was closed down during the Martian night. The cleaning had boosted the panels? power output close to their maximum 900 watt-hours per day after dropping to 500 watt-hours at one stage because of the heavy Martian dirt.

 By contrast, the power output of the solar panels of Mars Spirit ? on a different part of the Red Planet ? had dropped to just 400 watt-hours a day, clogged by the heavy dust.

 ?These exciting and unexplained cleaning events have kept Opportunity in really great shape,? the magazine quoted Nasa Rover team leader Jim Erickson as saying.

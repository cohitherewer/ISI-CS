 Barcelona, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Films about euthanasia, abortion and the hardships of immigrant life bagged the top prizes at the 17th European Film Awards on Saturday.

 Gegen Die Wand (Head-On), about a young Turkish woman in Germany who escapes her strict Muslim home through a difficult marriage with an older man, won the best film award in the competition dubbed the ?European Oscars?. Spaniard Javier Bardem won the best actor prize for his role as a paralysed man who fought for three decades for the right to die in Mar Adentro (The Sea Inside), a true story.

 Briton Imelda Staunton took the best actress statuette for her turn as a working-class mother who performs illegal abortions in the harrowing drama Vera Drake.

 A total of 44 films were in the running for the annual awards presented by the European Film Academy (EFA), presided by German arthouse star director Wim Wenders and made up of 1,600 film industry professionals from around the continent.

 While the awards have yet to gain the prestige of glamourous European film festivals like Cannes, Venice or Berlin, they are respected as the winners are chosen by academy members, who represent a broad spectrum of the movie business.

 ?These awards are still young but to me they are very important,? said Spanish actor Penelope Cruz after picking up the best actress prize in the People?s Choice category, for which film fans across Europe vote online.

 ?It?s important that we celebrate what is being done in film over here, which has nothing to envy what is being done anywhere else,? said Cruz, whose prize was for her role in the Italian film Non ti Muovere (Don?t Move) directed by Sergio Castellitto.

 The European Film Awards sealed the remarkable success of Gegen Die Wand, which overcame a scandal over its star?s porn movie past to score a German box-office success and win major prizes including the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.

 As well as best film, Turkish-German Fatih Akin collected the best director award for Gegen Die Wand in the People?s Choice category.

 Mar Adentro was the night?s other big success, netting the best director award for its director Alejandro Amenabar, who made his name outside of his native Spain with suspense film The Others starring Nicole Kidman.

 Staunton had also been chosen as best actress at Venice for her role in Vera Drake, directed by Mike Leigh. Bardem endured five-hour make-up sessions to gain wrinkles and lose most of his hair for his part as the paralysed euthanasia activist Ramon Sampedro.

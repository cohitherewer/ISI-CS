Q:Can you explain how a fitness freak can improve 

his performance and stamina?

SRS, Jamshedpur

Whether you are a marathon runner or just do aerobics 

a couple of times a week there are ways to improve your performance and stamina. 

 Eat in a way to stay fit, as diet plays an 

enormous part in exercise performance. For all those who work out regularly it 

is important to keep up the carbohydrate intake as it is the most important fuel 

for muscles. Low-carb diets increase the risk of muscle fatigue and injury ? carbs 

like brown rice, potatoes, wholegrain bread and vegetables provide a steady supply 

of energy but biscuits, cakes, refined sugar, white rice and sugary snacks only 

give a rapid surge of energy followed by a slump. Heart-healthy fats such as olive 

oil, nuts, seeds, oily fish, etc. are needed for many bodily functions. Proteins 

are essential for growth and repair of muscles and can be acquired from lean meat, 

fish, egg whites, low-fat dairy products, pulses, nuts and seeds. Remember to 

eat light, two hours prior to your workout and speed recovery with a carbohydrate 

and protein snack within 30 minutes of your training session. 

 Time it right ? always work with your body 

clock to exercise more efficiently. Contrary to popular belief, morning is not 

always the best time for high-intensity workouts as cooler joints and temperatures 

make you more injury-prone and overnight constriction of the airways makes oxygen 

intake slower. So, to start the day, yoga and stretches would be more suitable. 

The exception to this is endurance exercise such as long-distance running or simple 

walking when a lower body temperature reduces the risk of heart stress. Strength 

and stamina exercises can be performed late in the afternoon ? therefore this 

would be an ideal time to go to the gym. Body temperature, adrenaline, cardiovascular 

and respiratory systems all peak between 4 pm and 7 pm. You can push yourself 

harder and achieve a better performance at this time. Exercising late in the evenings 

is not a good idea as body temperature and heart rate drop in anticipation of 

sleep, thus making you more susceptible to injuries. Moreover, an increased heart 

rate and body temperature will make it harder to get sleep. 

 Supplement support is vital. Vitamins and minerals 

are important for all those who exercise. For example, calcium is vital for maintaining 

bone density, lowering the risk of brittleness in the bones. It is lost through 

sweat so a good intake is required, especially for women. A balanced diet with 

plenty of fruits and vegetables should provide all the nutrients you need. A multi-vitamin 

and mineral supplement can?t make up for a poor diet. It can only reduce nutritional 

gaps and an overdose has adverse effects. Never be tempted to try steroids or 

performance-enhancing drugs as they do lasting damage to your overall health.

 THE FAMILY

 - Coffee Break

 Empty nest

 Coffee Break / PAKSHI VASUDEVA

 It is perhaps a man-woman thing, but while most men, anticipating the problems of squatters, encroachers and immovable tenants, put off buying a house until they are ready to live in it, most women have an almost compulsive need to have a home that they can call their own. Being a woman myself, I can understand this feeling. 

 What is less easy to comprehend is the tenacity with which many of us cling to a house irrespective of changing circumstances. This seems to be a singularly Indian trait. While elsewhere, there is a constant buying and selling of houses as needs change and purses expand or contract, here a house becomes so imbued with sentiment that it is almost impossible to shed. 

 Sudha, an old friend, is a case in point. Some years ago she prevailed upon her husband to invest the inheritance he received on his father?s death in the purchase of a house. It seemed a wise move at that time. She and her husband had lived in a rented flat till then, and with two growing boys, were rather cramped for space. The house they bought was roomy and spacious, with a large garden For Sudha, it was a dream come true. ? Isn?t it wonderful,? she enthused. ?The boys have as much space as they want, and can you believe it, there is even room for a badminton court in the garden! Best of all, when they grow up and get married have children of their own, there will be room for everyone!? 

 That last sentence should have rung a warning bell. The house that Sudha had found was indeed a lovely one, but the dream of it being filled forever with laughter and children?s voices seemed totally unrealistic. And this is what it proved to be. Both boys are now young men in their 30s. Both are married and have children of their own, with one family in England and the other in the US. Where the boys used to visit their parents once a year, they now come out once in two years, and just for a couple of weeks. As their children grow and their expenses increase, their visits may become more infrequent. They have already begun to suggest that their parents should visit them instead, and they would be happy to pay the fare. In the meantime, Sudha and her husband rattle around in their huge, empty house, more lost and lonely than if they were living in a compact flat. 

 Today Sudha is tired and worn out and beset with financial worries. Her dream house has become a white elephant, a perpetual drain on their money and energy. But will she sell it and move to a smaller place? Certainly not. She is adamant that that the place must be kept going for her sons and their families. ?This is the home they remember,? she insists, ?and this is where they would want to come.? Perhaps so, but at the expense of their parents? well being? I doubt it very much.

 YOGA

 Got a minute ? or 12?

Gautam Sen asks if that?s too much time for some 

simple yoga exercises 

PRACTICE AT HOME

In the last three articles, we presented simple asanas that almost any one 

of us can do. You will have experienced how simple and effective yoga can be, 

if you have been able to find those six minutes at home and another six minutes 

at work. Also, you will have noticed that there are days in which those 12 minutes 

seem so difficult to find. And yet, mathematically, 12 minutes is actually only 

0.83 per cent of our 24 hours. Are we really so busy that we don?t have this little 

time to look after ourselves? Give it a thought! 

Asana 1: UTTHANPADASANA

Lie down with 

palms flat on the floor. As you inhale, slowly raise the right leg up to the point 

where you don?t have to bend the knee. Hold the straight leg in this raised position 

for a few moments. Make sure that the left leg is relaxed. As you exhale, slowly 

lower the leg to the floor without letting the knee bend. Do this five more times 

if you can, making sure that you don?t bend the knee, and also that you do the 

raising and lowering slowly. If you find that you are tiring, don?t speed up, 

simply do fewer than five rounds. 

Rest for a few moments and then repeat the practice five more times with the 

left leg. Keep your practice at this level for about a month, allowing your abdominal 

muscles and lower back to strengthen gradually, and then try raising both legs 

together, without bending the knees of course, five times. If it is too strenuous, 

just remind yourself that you are not preparing for the Olympics, and keep the 

practice to one leg at a time for another month. 

This asana will help you to strengthen your digestive system, lower back and 

pelvis and if you do it regularly, it will help you develop a trim and shapely 

middle. The trick is to do it very slowly, not as if you have to catch a train 

in 10 minutes? time.

Asana 2: JANU NAMAN

Sit comfortably 

on the mat with the legs stretched out. Bend the right knee and clasp the hands 

under the right thigh as shown in the picture, and as you exhale, squeeze the 

stomach with the right knee, making sure that the head and back are straight. 

Hold this position for a few moments and then, as you inhale, straighten the right 

leg till the right knee locks and the toes of the right foot point forward. The 

right heel should not touch the floor. Repeat this nine more times with the right 

leg, rest for a minute or so, and then do the same number of rounds with the left 

leg. 

The main focus of this asana is on keeping the knees in proper working condition, 

but it also affects the lower back and massages the abdominal area. 

If you have high blood pressure, heart conditions or an acute back problem, 

do fewer rounds and be gentle on yourself. If you still feel it unpleasant, discontinue 

this practice. 

IN BETWEEN CHORES

Asana 3: MUSHTIKA BANDHANA

 Hold the arms parallel to the floor at shoulder level. With palms facing downwards, 

open the hands by stretching the fingers as much as possible as you inhale slowly 

and steadily. The stretch should be such that you can feel the connection between 

each finger and the palm. Hold the stretch for a while and then, as you exhale 

slowly, close the fingers into a tight grip with the thumbs inside as shown. Hold 

this clenched fist position for a while. This is one round. Repeat slowly 10 times. 

When you finish, notice how you feel aware of the fingers because of the activation 

of the pranic energy in the fingers. 

Asana 4: PADANGULI NAMAN

 Sit comfortably on the mat or on your chair in office, with the legs outstretched 

and the heels about 12 inches apart. If you are doing this practice in the office, 

sit sufficiently forward on your chair, so that the knees are locked. The spine 

should be as straight as possible. 

 Keep the feet upright. Without bending the ankles, move the toes forward towards 

the floor as you exhale and get them into a tight grip as if you were going to 

pick up a handkerchief. Hold this position of the toes for a while and then, as 

you inhale, move only the toes upwards and towards you, stretching them fully 

as you inhale. Hold this position for a while. Repeat this for 10 rounds.

Asana 5: GOOLF NAMANA

 You have to assume the same posture as in Padanguli Naman. Keep your toes relaxed 

as you bend both feet at the ankle joints. As you exhale, the feet will move forward 

towards the floor. As you do this slowly, notice the stretch you are giving to 

the muscles on either side of your shinbones. When they are fully stretched, hold 

the position for a while. Then, as you inhale, bend the feet slowly backwards 

towards you and feel the stretch going up to the calf muscles and maybe, even 

further up. Increase the stretch slightly with each repetition instead of going 

all the way the first time. Be gentle. 

These three simple practices for the fingers, toes and ankles have the ability 

to give you a level of relaxation which only you can describe after you do them 

for some time. You can do them at home, in the office, while watching TV, chatting 

with friends ?. in fact, whenever you remember. The feeling of tiredness, the 

irritability about little things will slowly fall away.

 Here?s a suggestion about food. If we eat over-cooked food regularly, the 

digestive system becomes lazy since it does not have much work to do. This is 

because what we have eaten is more-or-less pre-digested. Making this a habit will 

mean that the system is slowly being given premature retirement. When choosing 

a meal the next time, give the digestive system some work to do. The choice and 

the consequences are yours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : At Leisure

 Tuesday, December 28, 2004 

 At a flick of your remote?

Sometimes its a ripple and sometimes it washes 

over people with the ferocity of a tsunami. The year 2004 proved that when it 

comes to drama, theres nothing like a home production. We bring you this 

years family soaps

Honey, We Shrunk Our Daughter

Starring 

Amisha, Asha and Amit Patel and Vikram Bhatt

The story so far 

If there is anything Bollywood producers fear more than the stars themselves, 

it is their parents. Because it is they who do the number-crunching when it comes 

to deciding the going rate of their son or daughter. Amisha Patel?s mother Asha 

and father Amit apparently accomplished that task with more than usual ease because 

the star of Anil Sharma?s Gadar and Rakesh Roshan?s Kaho Na Pyar Hain 

sued them for ?mismanaging? funds amounting to Rs 12 crore. The embarrassed parents 

retaliated by publicly wondering how Amisha could have amassed that amount in 

as brief a career as hers ? thereby questioning both her talent and her truthfulness 

? but the actress stuck by her accusation. It helped, of course, that director 

boyfriend Vikram Bhatt provided a shoulder to cry on. The Patels have in fact 

laid the blame for their daughter?s misdemeanours at his doorstep. Problems went 

further into the family when Vikram?s mother Varsha lodged a complaint of criminal 

intimidation against the Patels who, she said, had phoned her with threats against 

her son.

Once Upon A Time In Mumbai

Starring 

Bal, Uddhav, Raj, Jaidev and oh yes, Smita Thackeray

The story so far 

And then there was the family whose fate had a fallout on the politics of Maharashtra. 

Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray remains largely confined to his residence, Matoshree 

bungalow, due to threats from terror groups. Every strategy that the Shiv Sena 

employed to amass votes failed in both the Lok Sabha elections, and in the Maharashtra 

Assembly election in October. And that was because the bickering between Balasaheb?s 

son and party executive president Uddhav, and cousin Raj Thackeray, resulted in 

giving conflicting signals to the voters. Uddhav Thackeray?s ?Mee Mumbaikar? campaign 

caused the large north Indian migrant community to vote en bloc for the Congress-NCP 

combine, virtually wiping out the Sena in its own stronghold. Bringing up the 

vanguard of the Thackerays? troubles was second son Jaidev who, heady from a divorce 

from film producer wife Smita, announced he was joining rival Sharad Pawar?s NCP. 

Never mind that Pawar turned down the generous offer. 

Blood, Sweat And Tears

Starring 

Mukesh and Anil Ambani and the ghost of Dhirubhai Ambani

The story so far 

Like ?blog? the world over, the term ?sweat equity? was added to the business 

lexicon in India. All thanks to the Ambanis, they of the Rs 90,000-crore Reliance 

Group. After ?ownership issues? dividing the brothers Mukesh and Anil culminated 

in a humiliating (for Anil) board support for the buyback scheme mooted by Mukesh 

on Dec. 27, the differences will continue well into 2005, with radically altered 

familyscape. The much-published picture of harmony with Ambani patriarch Dhirubhai 

surrounded by the two brothers and their families has been replaced by the tense, 

formal handshake between the two brothers. What happens to the sweat equity will 

be interesting to see, but the entire Ambani clan is expected to sweat it out 

on January 16 at the Mumbai Marathon. The wives Neeta and Tina will compete, along 

with Mukesh, in the 7-km Dream Run, while the fitter Anil Ambani will go the whole 

hog in the 21-km Half Marathon. That perhaps symbolises how things will go in 

their corporate war.

Generation Gap

Starring 

Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan and Rahul Gandhi

The story so far 

Apparently, their relationship goes back to when Sarojini Naidu introduced Jawaharlal 

Nehru to Harivansh Rai Bachchan, but that hasn?t stopped two of the nation?s first 

families from letting their quiet antagonism come out this year in the open. In 

a country where politics and the movie industry are followed like spectator sports, 

it all began when Jaya Bachchan alluded, at a rally, that ?those who brought my 

husband into politics betrayed him midstream? They left us when we were in a crisis... 

They are known to betray people.?

 The response from the Gandhis was swift. A front-page headline in a leading daily said: ?Bachchans full of lies, says Rahul.? Amitabh Bachchan may have reacted to the statement by the newly elected MP with what he said was ?hurt? but he was just to deliver his wife a public rap on the knuckles for wayward speech: ?She doesn?t understand the deep relationship, which is five decades old,? he said coldly. ?I disagree with her.? 

Hamara Bajaj

Starring 

Rahul and Shishir Bajaj

The story so far 

This year, it seemed like one of the last few business families to have managed 

to keep the flock together, the Rs 6,000-crore Bajaj group, were headed for a 

split or at least a reshuffle at the top with Shishir expressing the desire, to 

older brother Rahul, to ?separate? from the group in order to consolidate his 

shareholding in the companies that he currently manages. The reason: the group?s 

business existence is heavily tilted in favour of Bajaj Auto, the jewel in the 

Bajaj crown, and Rahul (who, interestingly mediated in the Ambani fracas) and 

his sons Rajiv and Sanjiv have complete sway over it, thereby cornering the limelight 

denied the rest of the family.

 STREET LEGAL

 Pursuant to a criminal complaint filed on grounds of cheating, those concerned applied for anticipatory bail. The father of one of them offered to deposit Rs 5.82 lakh, i.e. the amount claimed, and agreed that the amount shall be paid to the complainant if settlement is arrived at. Bail was granted but the dispute could not be settled. The complainant, replying on the agreement, made an application for disbursement of the amount. Setting aside the order, the Supreme Court held that the order indicated that the amount would be disbursed if the matter was settled. There was no settlement between the parties and in a bail application the court cannot adjudicate in regard to the amount involved (Jagtar Singh vs State of Punjab).

 Seats are reserved for the MBBS course for children/ widows of armed forces/ those disabled during action. A daughter of an ex-serviceman claimed admission under such category. However, her application was rejected on the ground that the certificate issued by the Zilla Sainik Board contained a mistake. Her application was denied even after production of a rectified certificate as admission was already granted to candidates of lower rank. The Supreme Court held that it was undisputed that she belonged to the reserved category. The court further directed to provide admission by creating an extra seat if necessary (Dolly Chhanda vs Chairman JEE).

 An eviction order was passed against the petitioner under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act. Appeal was pending before the district judge. During this time, his electricity supply was disconnected. The Madras High Court held that the order is subject to the pending appeal. So long as he is not evicted, the petitioner is entitled to basic amenities which were available to him prior to the eviction order. The high court directed reconnection subject to necessary payments (G. Asokan vs Neyveli Lignite Corporation).

 Judging by 2004

When justice catches up with people, it spares no one. 

Not public officials, not politicians, sometimes not even judges themselves. Presenting 

this year?s case list of the men and women behind some extraordinary judgments

Fine days ahead

 It was a slap in the face of two of the country?s 

biggest political parties, when Mumbai High Court judges A.P. Shah and S.U. Kamdar 

did the supposedly unthinkable. On July 23, they slapped a fine of a whopping 

Rs 20 lakh each on the BJP and Shiv Sena for holding a bandh. Based on a PIL filed 

by aggrieved citizens inconvenienced by the strike, it was the first time ever 

in the country?s legal history that political parties were penalised for holding 

a bandh. 

Stuck in a jam

 On the morning of September 24, Calcutta High 

Court judge Amitava Lala was caught in a traffic standstill for over an hour on 

his way to work. The congestion was caused by a huge rally. On September 29, Justice 

Lala passed an order banning all rallies and processions in the city on weekdays 

between 8 am and 8 pm. Sundays and public holidays were spared but that too with 

the condition that traffic is not blocked in any way. His order not only kicked 

up a huge storm, with protesters crying ?unconstitutional? and counter-protesters 

declaring support, it also managed to pull off the virtually impossible feat of 

getting all the main political parties in West Bengal to agree ? to dis-agree 

with the order. The order, of course, has subsequently been ?stayed?. 

Do you smell gas?

 It came as a breath of fresh air to Calcutta?s 

pollution-weary citizens when Calcutta High Court judges Chief Justice A.K. Mathur 

and Justice A.K. Banerjee ordered the implementation of Bharat Stage II in the 

city by April 2004. This meant that all vehicles plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan 

Area would have to switch to LPG or CNG. Not only did it shake up the government, 

whom the judges accused of ?dilly-dallying?, but also stirred up the otherwise 

lackadaisical auto-emission control board. Subsequently, however, an appeal by 

the government, followed by a modified order of the High Court, saw the implementation 

of BS II from October. Not only that, older vehicles, whose engines were not made 

to fit BS II norms too were granted permission to ply, provided they complied 

with the tail-pipe emission norms set by a central government notification. 

The plot thickens

 Calcutta High Court judge Bhagabati Prasad 

Banerjee landed in a lot of trouble last month, when on November 19, the Supreme 

Court ordered him to vacate his house built on a plot of land in Salt Lake. The 

plot had been allotted to him by Jyoti Basu as chief minister on October 17, 1987. 

Banerjee had stopped distribution of plots on a petition by the Salt Lake Welfare 

Association on June 8, 1987. However, he modified his order three days later, 

allowing the chief minister to allot plots. 

Theory of relativity

 Many within the judiciary felt justice was 

denied to Binod Kumar Roy, Chief Justice, Punjab and Haryana High Court when the 

judge, recognised for his accountability, received a transfer order to Patna High 

Court. This was after he issued a directive that restricted certain advocates 

from appearing before judges who were related to them. The Bar Council rule clearly 

states that lawyers cannot appear before judges who are related to them, but Roy 

identified 12 lawyers who were apparently flouting this rule. While many prominent 

jurists lauded the order, several in the judicial establishment ? including the 

Supreme Court ? were distinctly unhappy. The apex court ordered a transfer. However, 

1,001 lawyers signed a memorandum to the President in November asking for a reconsideration 

of the transfer order.

Exits and entries

 Justice Indira Banerjee of the Calcutta High 

Court created news when, on September 29, a day before the official closing date 

for this year?s admission to MBBS courses in West Bengal, she cancelled the entry 

of 69 students under the NRI quota system. The government, which had admitted 

a huge number of NRI students, was caught on the wrong foot. A sheepish West Bengal 

CM apologised to protesting NRI students and said he would take the matter to 

the apex court, prompting state JEE students to go on a hunger-strike. A subsequent 

promise from him that the NRIs would be accommodated in new courses was naturally 

no consolation to them.

A different crime

 In November, Karnataka High Court judge N.S. 

Veerbhadrayya made headlines with his verdict that declared that if a man induces 

a woman to have sex on the promise to marry her and does not, it is tantamount 

to cheating ? but not rape. In the case of Lakshmana Naik vs State of 

Karnataka, the victim claimed that she did not lodge a case against the rapist 

earlier because he had promised to marry her if she didn?t complain. Subsequently, 

they not only carried on a physical relationship, but allegedly lived as husband 

and wife. When she became pregnant, however, the man refused to marry her. The 

woman lodged a complaint two days before the birth of the child.

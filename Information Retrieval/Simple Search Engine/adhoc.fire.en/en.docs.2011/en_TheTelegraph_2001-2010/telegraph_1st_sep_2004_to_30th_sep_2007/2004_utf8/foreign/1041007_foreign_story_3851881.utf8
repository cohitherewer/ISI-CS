 Oxford tells govt to take ?tanks? off its lawns

 JOHN CLARE

 London, Oct. 6: The government 

 was told yesterday to ?take its tanks off Oxford?s lawns? 

 and stop threatening it with financial penalties for failing 

 to admit more pupils from state schools and poorer backgrounds.

 Michael Beloff, the president of Trinity College, Oxford, which two years ago rejected an application from Tony Blair?s eldest son, Euan, said the university owed its international standing to its insistence that academic merit was the only criterion for admission.

 ?To alter our standards in pursuit of social or political rather than educational objectives would be a betrayal of what the university is for,? he told the annual meeting of the Headmasters? and Headmistresses? Conference, which represents 240 leading independent schools.

 He said Oxford?s determination to escape such pressures could lead it to become independent of the government. That would be expensive, but the university was about to launch a major fund-raising drive.

 ?If we do become independent, every means must be used to ensure that we do not become merely a finishing school for the offspring of the rich, but honour the traditions of the founders of the colleges whose concern was imparting education and ideals to those with the capacity to absorb them,? he said. 

 Oxford still had no idea whether it would be allowed to charge tuition fees of ?3,000 a year from 2006; nor had it been told which, if any, of the government?s targets it would be required to meet.

 The real problem about widening access to leading universities was the failure of most state schools to offer their pupils the teaching and facilities that were available in the independent sector, Beloff said. That was the government?s responsibility.

 The government insisted that the cleverest pupils prospered as much in non-selective as in selective schools. Beloff said: ?If you teach the intellectually outstanding and the intellectually more challenged together, you may benefit the latter but you will surely burden the former. 

 ?Research has shown that bright working-class children inevitably do better in grammar than comprehensive schools, which is why destroying the grammar schools in the 1960s was such a terrible mistake.?

 The government claimed that the growing success of pupils in public exams was a result of more diligent study and more dedicated teaching. But the truth was that ?soft assessment? had been substituted for rigorous exams and multiple choice questions for essays.

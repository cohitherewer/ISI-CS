 Brosnan can keep Bond suit in closet

 Pierce Brosnan

 Los Angeles, Oct. 1 (Reuters): 

 It looks like super-spy James Bond can keep his tuxedo in 

 the closet for at least another year.

 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc, on the verge of being sold to a group of companies led by Sony Corp, has pushed back its target release date from November 2005 until sometime in 2006, a spokesman for the film studio said today. He cited the failure so far to line up a director for the movie, which would mark the 21st installment of MGM?s venerable film franchise.

 MGM, which together with EON Productions owns the Bond movie rights and distributes the films, had insisted as recently as late July that a script was finished and the next film was on track to arrive in theatres in November 2005.

 But without a director on board by summer?s end, producers were not sure they could begin shooting as planned in January or February in order to make a November deadline for release, the spokesman said. 

 One factor in the delay has been MGM executives? preoccupation with negotiations leading to the recent deal for a Sony-led consortium to acquire the studio for about $2.85 billion plus debt.

 Another question mark is whether Pierce Brosnan would return to star as the suave secret agent. Brosnan, 51, who has portrayed agent 007 in four films starting with GoldenEye in 1995, told Entertainment Weekly magazine this summer he was through with the Bond franchise.

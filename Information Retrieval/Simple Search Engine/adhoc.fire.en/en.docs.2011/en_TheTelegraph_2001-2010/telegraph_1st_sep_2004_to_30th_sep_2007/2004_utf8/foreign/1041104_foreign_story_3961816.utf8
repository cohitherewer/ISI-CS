 Karzai wins 

 Kabul, Nov. 3 (Reuters): Incumbent Hamid Karzai was declared the winner of last month?s Afghan presidential election today and now faces the task of forming a government minus the warlords and drug runners who tainted his last cabinet.

 Karzai will be inaugurated at the end of this month, but his triumph has been soured by the kidnapping last week of three UN election officials. Armed with a mandate from the people, Karzai can now form a cabinet of his own choosing, though it will have to be ratified once the National Assembly is established.

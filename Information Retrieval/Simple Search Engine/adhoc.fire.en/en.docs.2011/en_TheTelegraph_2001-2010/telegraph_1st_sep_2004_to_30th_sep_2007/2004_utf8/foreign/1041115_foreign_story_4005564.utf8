 Cheney in heart scare

 Washington, Nov. 14 (Reuters): US Vice-President Dick Cheney, who has a history of heart attacks, went to a Washington hospital yesterday after experiencing shortness of breath but later left for home and said he was fine.

 Cheney, 63, has had a cold and aides said his cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, advised him to visit George Washington University Hospital out of an abundance of caution.

 Reiner later issued a statement ruling out ?any cardiac cause? of Cheney?s symptoms and also ruled out pneumonia and lung problems. ?The Vice-President likely has a viral, upper respiratory infection,? Reiner said in a statement.

 Walking toward his motorcade as he departed the hospital, Cheney told reporters, ?I feel fine.? With Cheney was his wife, Lynne, who said, ?Sorry we ruined your Saturday. We?re great. Thank you.?

 Cheney has had four heart attacks, the first in 1978 when he was 37 but none while he has been Vice-President. The most recent was a mild one soon after the contested presidential race in November 2000.

 The Vice-President had a stent ? a permanent wire mesh tube ? implanted to open an artery after his last heart attack. A defibrillator, to help regulate his heartbeat, was implanted in 2001.

 Cheney spokeswoman Mary Matalin said the Vice-President had developed a cold after a post-election hunting trip from which he returned on Thursday night.

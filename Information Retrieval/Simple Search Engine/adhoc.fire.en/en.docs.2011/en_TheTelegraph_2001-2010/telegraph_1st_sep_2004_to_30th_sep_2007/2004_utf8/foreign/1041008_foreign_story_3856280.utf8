 Laura?s advice to Teresa: don?t wear blue

 Burbank (California), Oct. 7 (Reuters): Appearing once again on the late-night TV circuit, Laura Bush had an important message for Teresa Heinz Kerry, the wife of her husband?s political foe ? the First Lady will be wearing blue when they next meet.

 Recalling the big fashion faux pas of last week?s presidential debate, when she and Teresa Kerry both wore white, Laura told Jay Leno during her guest spot on NBC?s The Tonight Show that she and Teresa Kerry probably have ?a lot in common.?

 ?We even chose to wear the same colour suits (at last Thursday?s debate),? she said. ?So now I just want to announce today that I?ll be wearing a blue suit on Friday night.? 

 She added of John Kerry?s spouse: ?I really do feel like we?re members of a club. We?re the only ones who know how it feels to have a husband running for president in 2004.?

 Laura Bush?s appearance on the Leno show, her third since her husband took office, marked a light-hearted interval in what has become an increasingly heated campaign.

 The Tonight Show has become a frequent stop for presidential hopefuls and their surrogates eager for the exposure to the programme?s 6 million nightly viewers.

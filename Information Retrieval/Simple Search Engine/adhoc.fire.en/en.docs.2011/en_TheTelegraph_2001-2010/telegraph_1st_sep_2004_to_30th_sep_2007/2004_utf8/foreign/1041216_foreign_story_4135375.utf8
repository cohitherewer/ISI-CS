 Britain to shed embassy flab

 London, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Britain is to reshape its overseas diplomatic network, closing or turning over to local staff several dozen posts, in a cost-cutting drive to pay for embassies in Iraq and Afghanistan and to fight terrorism.

 The biggest shake-up in the diplomatic service for years comes as the government turns its focus to new regional priorities and to fighting weapons proliferation, energy policy and climate change, the foreign office said today.

 In the past three years, London has opened new posts in Iraq, Afghanistan and North Korea, stretching the budget.

 Extra security ? including relocating some posts, camera surveillance and bomb-proof glass ? to guard against attacks like last year?s suicide bomb on the consulate in Istanbul has also inflated running costs. 

 Eight embassies staffed by British diplomats will be closed in the Asia Pacific region, Latin America and Africa and one locally staffed post will be closed, the foreign office said. 

 British diplomats will be replaced by local staff in 11 embassies in countries like Australia, Germany, France and some states of the US.

 Ten subordinate posts ? consulates general or consulates ? will be closed with nearby countries providing representation.

 The changes should bring savings of about ?6 million annually once they are in place, expected by the end of 2006. 

 The government will also reorganise its network of trade officials to focus on emerging markets like China and India.

 The changes come as London prepares for an expensive year in 2005. Britain will chair the Group of Eight industrial nations and head the European Union in the latter half of the year.

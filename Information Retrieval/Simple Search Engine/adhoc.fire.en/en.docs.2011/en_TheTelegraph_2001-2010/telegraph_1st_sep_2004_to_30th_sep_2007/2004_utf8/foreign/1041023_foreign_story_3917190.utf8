 Hostage cries for Blair help

 Dubai, Oct. 22 (Reuters): British-Iraqi hostage Margaret Hassan made an emotional appeal for British forces to withdraw from Iraq, in a videotape broadcast on Arabic television channel Al Jazeera today.

 ?Please help me, please help me,? Hassan, who works for aid agency Care International, was shown saying while crying. ?This might be my last hour.?

 The appeal came as British troops prepared to move nearer Baghdad ahead of an expected US-led offensive against rebels before January elections.

 ?Please, the British people, ask Mr Blair to take the troops out of Iraq and not to bring them here ... That?s why people like Mr Bigley and myself are being caught,? she said, referring to British hostage Kenneth Bigley, who was decapitated by his captors earlier this month.

 ?I don?t want to die like Bigley,? Irish-born Hassan appealed, before burying her head in her hands in tears.

 Al Jazeera did not say how it obtained the tape, nor name the group holding Hassan, who has lived in Iraq for 30 years and also has Iraqi citizenship. She was kidnapped in Baghdad on Tuesday.

 Care International is one of the world?s largest independent global relief and development organisations and works in Iraq on primary health care and water projects.

 Dozens of foreigners have been kidnapped in Iraq. At least 32 have been killed.

 Hassan is the eighth foreign woman to have been kidnapped in Iraq since April. The others, including two Italian aid workers held for three weeks in September, have been released.

 The video surfaced the day after Britain announced it would move 850 troops from their relatively safe base in south Iraq to a more hostile area near Baghdad to relieve US troops.

 British defence secretary Geoff Hoon said the redeployment requested by the US would last ?weeks rather than months?.

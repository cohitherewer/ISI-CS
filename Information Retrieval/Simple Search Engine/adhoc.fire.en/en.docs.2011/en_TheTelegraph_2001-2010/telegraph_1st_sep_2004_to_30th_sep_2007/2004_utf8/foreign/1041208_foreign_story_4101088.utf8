 Thinking cap controls computer

 Washington, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Four people were able to control a computer using their thoughts and an electrode-studded ?thinking cap?, US researchers reported yesterday.

 They said their set-up could someday be adapted to help disabled people operate a motorised wheelchair or artificial limb.

 This experiment, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, required no surgery and no implants.

 ?The results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two dimensions,? Jonathan Wolpaw and Dennis McFarland of the New York state department of health and State University of New York in Albany wrote.

 They tested their device on four people ? two partly paralysed men who used wheelchairs and a healthy man and woman. During the experiments, the four volunteers faced a video screen wearing a cap that held 64 electrodes against the scalp.

 The key was a special computer algorithm ? a programme that translated the brain signals into a meaningful directive of what the users wanted the computer to do.

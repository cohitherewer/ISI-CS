 Forget Bush, Arnies the icon now

 New York, Sept. 1: The Republicans have a new hero: Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

 The actor-turned California governor and son-in-law of the Kennedys took the floor of the Republican National Convention here last night, his first prime time appearance on the national stage, and immediately replaced at least for now George W. Bush as the incumbent icon for the party faithful.

 When Bush spoke to the delegates via satellite from Pennsylvania shortly after Schwarzeneggers 30-minute address to the convention, no one listened. They were still in a trance holding blue and white placards that read Arnold or People of Compassion.

 When the Presidents twin daughters took the stage at the Madison Square Garden to introduce their mother, who was billed as the star speaker last night, they looked ridiculous after Schwarzeneggers sway over the audience.

 Worse, First Lady Laura Bush was like a pricked balloon after the week-long media build up that had been launched in preparation for her prime time speech.

 This was just what the Bush strategists had feared. That Schwarzenegger would outshine the President at the convention, whose main purpose is to give a boost for the Bush re-election campaign in the run up to the November 2 election.

 Indeed, he did. Americas morning papers today gushed about Schwarzeneggers debut on the national stage last night. Arnold the warm-up act became Arnold the main event, wrote the New York Post. The Terminator doesnt understand being No. 2, so he took the crowd last night and killed em. He turned his act into the main event getting more applause, more adulation, more laughs than all the main event Bush women put together, a reference to the First Lady and her twin daughters.

 The Christian Science Monitor acknowledged that long lampooned by late-night comedians, the governor is now lauded even by critics as an intelligent detail man. His efforts to bridge partisan gaps have scored major successes.

 Which is why the Bush strategists gave him the prime slot at the podium last night. Along with former New York mayor and September 11 hero Rudy Guiliani the prime time speaker on Monday Schwarzenegger has an appeal among undecided voters. Schwarzeneggers speech is the only address to the convention that Americas broadcast networks have covered live so far. 

 The paper acknowledged tension between Schwarzenegger and Bush, who fears that like Ronald Reagan another actor-turned-politician Schwarzenegger can outshine the President. Because of that tension, the Bush-Schwarzenegger relationship has been cordial, but largely arms length. Bush did not endorse Schwarzenegger during the effort to oust (former California) governor Gray Davis by recall vote, and the couples public meetings have not brought them any closer.

 Still, Republicans are understandably eager to showcase the governor of Americas largest state. With his Hollywood background, business experience and muscle-building youth, he remains an iconoclast from outside the usual mould. It is a rare, and potentially powerful, blend of charisma and authenticity.

 Despite all the popularity Schwarzenegger is garnering, Americas top political job will elude him. He was born in Austria and cannot, therefore, become President although Schwarzenegger last night spoke in riddles about a constitution change. That, for now, is unlikely.

 Schwarzenegger spoke at length last night about how he emigrated to America a quarter century ago and about how he decided to become a Republican after watching Hubert Humphrey and Richard Nixon debate during his very first week as an immigrant. Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air.

 Television commentators said later that the debate Schwarzenegger referred to never took place. But for his thousands of Republican fans, facts did not matter. Only the presence of the Terminator did.

 Clinton heart surgery successful

 New York, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Former US President Bill Clinton was recovering today after successful heart bypass surgery at a New York hospital, his office said.

 The surgery was successful. The president is now resting comfortably, Clintons office said in a statement after the five-hour operation at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. The procedure was led by Dr Craig Smith, chief of cardiothoracic surgery and started at about 7 am today. He is fine, he came through it OK, a hospital source said. 

 Clinton, 58, who was known for his love of fast food, was admitted to the hospital on Friday after complaining of chest pains and shortness of breath.

 Clintons wife, US Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and daughter, Chelsea, 24, were with him in New York. The family issued a statement yesterday on Clintons website saying: While bypass surgery certainly isnt something to look forward to, we are very lucky that the condition was detected in time, the statement said.

 The family thanked thousands of well-wishers for cards received since Clinton was hospitalised.

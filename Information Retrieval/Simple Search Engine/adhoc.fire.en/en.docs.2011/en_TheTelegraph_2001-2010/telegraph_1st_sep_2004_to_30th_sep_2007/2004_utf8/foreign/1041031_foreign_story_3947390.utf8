 Fine Print

 Wilde sale

 London, Oct. 30: The world?s finest private collection of books, letters and manuscripts relating to Oscar Wilde fetched more than ?850,000 yesterday at Sotheby?s, London.

 A private buyer paid ?72,000 for a handwritten manuscript of Wilde?s novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, while a British dealer bought the writer?s annotated American first edition of his play Vera for ?50,400. However, one of only two surviving copies of The Wilde Myth, an attack on the writer by his former lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, which had been expected to fetch up to ?50,000, failed to sell.

 Street sex

Berlin (Reuters): German police detained a naked 25-year-old 

woman and her 23-year-old partner who were engaged in sexual intercourse on the 

pavement in the middle of a busy shopping district, police said on Saturday. The 

couple were spotted by pedestrians late on Friday morning having intercourse. 

Pedestrians in the town of 40,000 called police, but the couple initially ignored 

police orders to stop. ?The naked couple continued their passion-filled activity 

on the cold asphalt,? the police said. ?They finally followed police instructions 

to stop on the third warning.?

 Microwave guns to stun Iraq rioters

 TONY FREINBERG AND SEAN RAYMENT

 London, Sept. 19: Microwave 

 weapons that cause pain without lasting injury are to be 

 issued to American troops in Iraq for the first time as 

 concern mounts over growing number of civilians killed in 

 fighting.

 The non-lethal weapons, which use high-powered electromagnetic beams, will be fitted to vehicles already in Iraq, which will allow the system to be introduced as early as next year.

 Using technology similar to that found in a conventional microwave oven, the beam rapidly heats water molecules in the skin to cause intolerable pain and a burning sensation. 

 The invisible beam penetrates the skin to a depth of less than a millimetre. As soon as the target moves out of the beam?s path, the pain disappears.

 Because there are no after-effects, the US department of defence believes that the weapons will be particularly useful in urban conflict. 

 The beam could be used to scatter large crowds in which insurgents operate at close quarters to both troops and civilians.

 ?The skin gets extremely hot, and people can?t stand the pain, so they have to move ? and move in the way we want them to,? said Col Wade Hall of the Office of Force Transformation, a body formed in November 2001 to promote rapid improvement across all of the American armed services.

 Rich Garcia, a spokesman for the Air Force Research Laboratory in New Mexico, where the systems were developed, took part in testing the weapon and was subjected to the microwave beam which has a range of one kilometre. 

 ?It just feels like your skin is on fire,? he said. ?(But) when you get out of the path of the beam, or shut off the beam, everything goes back to normal. There?s no residual pain.?

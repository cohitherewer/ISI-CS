 Movies just for the dogs

 Albuquerque (New Mexico), Sept. 24 (Reuters): Lassie don?t go home. Go to the movies in New Mexico.

 The Dog Film Festival will be held in Albuquerque tomorrow, showing nothing but canine cinema for dogs and their owners. 

 ?The criteria is that the films have to be about dogs, have dogs in them or once you watch the film, you think of a dog,? said Dogfest founder Kim Snitker.

 Several hundred humans and dogs are expected to watch the 25 short features submitted by aspiring filmmakers with a soft spot for hounds. First prize for the best short is $500, which will be given to an animal charity chosen by the winner.

 Snitker said she started the film festival because she always wanted to take her dog to the movies.?Theyre very attentive?, she said.?They get excited when everyone applauds.?

 Admittance is $5 for humans and free for dogs. All proceeds will go to the citys spay and neuter programs.

 Suicide bomber kills 4 at Lahore mosque

 Lahore, Oct. 10 (Reuters): 

 A suicide bomber killed four people as he shot his way into 

 a Shia mosque and blew himself up in the Pakistani city 

 of Lahore today, emergency workers said.

 The attack was the latest in a spate of sectarian attacks in Pakistan that has fuelled fears of a flare-up in violence between minority Shias and majority Sunnis. Witnesses said a man opened fire on a security guard who tried to stop him entering the mosque, then blew himself up inside. At the entrance to the mosque was a large pool of blood and body parts, including the head of a child, were strewn around.

 Khawaja Basharat, a Shia community leader, said seven people, some children, had been killed, but an official from the private Edhi emergency service said five were killed ? the attacker, two guards and two children ? and seven wounded.

 The bomber shot and killed two guards when they stopped him, Basharat said. 

 ?As soon as he entered, he blew himself up. The casualties could have been greater if the guards hadn?t tried to stop him. He could not reach the prayer hall, the bravery of the guards saved many lives,? he said.

 Earlier today, protesting Islamic students threw stones at police who replied with teargas in the southern city of Karachi ahead of the funeral of a leading pro-Taliban cleric and an associate assassinated by unknown gunmen yesterday.

 The killing of Mufti Jameel Ahmad Khan followed two deadly attacks on religious gatherings this month in which more than 70 people, both Sunnis and Shias, were killed. 

 A car bomb attack on a crowd of radical Sunnis in Multan on Thursday killed at least 42 people and a suicide bombing at a crowded Shia mosque killed 30 in the city of Sialkot on October 1.

 Chinese engineers

 Islamic militants are still holding two Chinese engineers kidnapped in Pakistan on Saturday and have threatened to kill them if attacked by security forces, a member of a team seeking the captives? release said on Sunday.

 The men are being held in South Waziristan, a tribal region bordering Afghanistan where security forces have been battling al Qaida-linked militants since March, the source said.

 He said the kidnappers, who had explosives strapped to them, were with their captives in an isolated mud-brick house in the Chagmalai area of South Waziristan, surrounded by tribesmen and security forces.

 ?They are in a small house and two people came out when we said we wanted to speak to them,? he said.

 ?They were wearing masks and speaking in Pashto. They had grenades in their hands and explosives strapped to their bodies. They didn?t have any demands. They said we should speak to their leader, Abdullah Mehsud.?

 Chinese diplomats identified the engineers as Wang Ende and Wang Teng, who worked on Pakistan?s Gomal Zam Dam project for China?s state-run Sino Hydro Corp.

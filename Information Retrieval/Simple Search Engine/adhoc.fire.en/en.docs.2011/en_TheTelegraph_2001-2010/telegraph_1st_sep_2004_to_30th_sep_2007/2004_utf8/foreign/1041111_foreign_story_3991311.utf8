 Los Angeles, Nov. 10 (Reuters): One would not know it from the way she is all over the media promoting her latest Bridget Jones film, but Oscar-winning Renee Zellweger is taking an extended break from acting.

 After Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason begins playing in theatres on Friday, Zellweger, 35, said she plans to step away from the limelight, stop acting for a while and learn what it is like to be ?just a girl.? ?I don?t see myself climbing into a makeup chair any time soon and taking another role. I feel like I need to take a minute and have a little bit of life experience,? Zellweger said in a recent interview.

 The first Bridget Jones? Diary in 2001 made Zellweger a top box office star as audiences fell in love with her portrayal of the plump, single British woman who drinks, smokes, curses and bungles her way through her love life. She followed Bridget Jones with her Oscar-nominated role as murderess Roxie Hart in musical Chicago and won a best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Cold Mountain.

 Zellweger, who gained 14 kg to play Bridget Jones a second time, returns to familiar territory in Edge of Reason. As the movie opens, Bridget has had six weeks of a relationship with her ?total sex god? Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). But her old fans know the good loving can?t last long when into her life returns old flame Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) with his eye back on Bridget. The first Bridget Jones dealt with finding love, but Edge of Reason is about keeping love burning.

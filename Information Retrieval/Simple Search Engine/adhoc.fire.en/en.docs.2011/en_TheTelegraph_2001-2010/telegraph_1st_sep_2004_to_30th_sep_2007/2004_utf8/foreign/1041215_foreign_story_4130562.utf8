 Royal white dress that wowed Paris

 CAROLINE DAVIES

 London, Dec. 14: Even today 

 it is regarded as one of the pivotal moments in 20th century 

 fashion.

 The famous ?white wardrobe? worn by a newly crowned Queen Elizabeth for the politically significant pre-War state visit to Paris in 1938 wowed the French and British alike, and set a trend for couturiers on both sides of the Channel.

 Yet until her death two years ago, the ephemeral, floaty creations by Norman Hartnell that had such an impact at that time, had been kept at Clarence House.

 Now, for the first time, seven of the dresses will form the centrepiece of a major exhibition at Buckingham Palace based around the highly successful visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to strengthen Anglo-French relations as Europe stood on the brink of war.

 Although it elevated Queen Elizabeth to the unlikely status of fashion icon, her wardrobe was never intended to be all white.

 Five days before the planned visit, Queen Elizabeth?s mother, the Countess of Strathmore, died and the trip was postponed for three weeks of mourning.

 The new Queen, who with King George had rather unexpectedly found herself crowned following King Edward VIII?s abdication in December 1936, had employed Hartnell to design a wardrobe that would be scrutinised by the fashion capital of the world. He rose to the challenge with 30 grand dresses, coats and accessories in ?many lovely colourings?.

 But then something more appropriate was needed for the period of family mourning, and black was not a practical choice for the height of a Parisian summer. 

 ?It was Hartnell himself who suggested white,? said Caroline de Guitaut, the exhibition?s curator. For three weeks his salon toiled around the clock to reproduce each garment in white.

 There was precedent for white as the colour of royal mourning. 

 Hartnell remembered that Queen Victoria had insisted on a white funeral, and French queens had worn white mourning until the 17th century. 

 Nevertheless it caused gasps when Queen Elizabeth, who had departed from Buckingham Palace clad in black, stepped from the royal train in Paris entirely in white.

 Queen Elizabeth, who did not have a model?s figure, had found her look and liked it so much that on her return from Paris, she commissioned Cecil Beaton to take romantic photographs of her in Hartnell?s creations of tulle, satin, lace and silk. 

 Among the seven Hartnell dresses in the exhibition, which will run throughout August and September next year, will be the crinoline worn to the State Banquet at the Elys?e Palace, and the lace dress chosen for the garden party in the Bagatelle Gardens in the Bois de Boulogne.

 They will be displayed alongside the beautiful ?Indian? tiara, made for Queen Victoria and worn by Queen Elizabeth during the visit. Containing 2,678 diamonds, the tiara takes its name from the Indian rubies set into it in 1902 when Queen Alexandra had the ?unlucky opals? set by Queen Victoria removed.

 Also on display will be gifts presented to the royal couple during the visit, including a Ren? Lalique glass table service and watercolours by ?douard Vuillard, Raoul Dufy and Maurice Utrillo, along with the menus and musical orders Queen Elizabeth kept as souvenirs of the visit.

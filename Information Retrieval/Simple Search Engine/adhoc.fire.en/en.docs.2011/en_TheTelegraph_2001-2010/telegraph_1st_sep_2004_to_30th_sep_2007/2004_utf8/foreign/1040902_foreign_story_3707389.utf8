 It may come as a shock to those who cant tell their USB ports from their wireless ethernets, but the Internet caf is 10-years-old today.

 What started as the brainwave of a homesick Polish student has become a fixture of high streets from Swansea to Timbuktu. From a modest beginning in London the internet caf is now familiar all over the world

 There are now more than 20,000 Internet cafs across the world, with their customers using them as something close to a post office, shopping centre, newspaper and library rolled into one. Eva Pascoe, a Polish psychology student, opened Cafe Cyberia, the worlds first Internet caf, in Whitfield Street, central London, on September 1, 1994.

 To celebrate the concepts 10th birthday, Yahoo! Mail today publishes its inaugural internet caf awards. James Bilefield, from Yahoo!, said: The Internet caf concept is as fresh and as relevant today as it was 10-years -ago. Its now second nature for people on the move to use the local Internet caf to keep up with the news from home and to tell friends and family where they have been.

 Many Internet cafs also provide an essential service for the community and, in the developing world, a place where people can learn from the Internet and communicate with others around the globe. More than 1,000 nominations were received from travellers who visited Internet cafs in 111 countries. They are listed in The Rough Guide to the Worlds Best Internet Cafs, an e-book [an electronic book available on the Internet] that can be downloaded at www.yahoo.co.uk.

 The cafs were entered into one of five categories: Most Remote, Most Unusual, Most Stylish, Best UK and a special Life Saver category for those that were there in the travellers hour of need. Pascoe was writing her PhD at City University in London in 1994 when she first struck on the idea of an Internet caf.

 She said: I was spending a long time away from my family, working on my PhD. I had access to e-mail, but at the time the Internet was mainly an academic service. One day I was sitting having a cup of coffee and it occurred to me it that it would be fun to have a drink and bring my laptop to the coffee shop to send e-mails while having a break from work.

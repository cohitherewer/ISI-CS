 Musharraf listens to ?majority? on two posts

 Islamabad, Dec. 30 (Reuters): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today reiterated his intention to retain his dual role of army chief and called on the Opposition to accept the decision of the majority.

 Last month, pro-military politicians who dominate parliament passed a bill allowing Musharraf to stay on as army chief despite his pledge to give up the post at the year-end in a deal with Islamist opponents that gave him sweeping powers.

 ?It is the voice of the majority and the minority should accept this ruling,? Musharraf said in an address to the nation broadcast on state-run Pakistan Television and Radio.

 Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless 1999 coup, said the constitution allowed him to hold both offices until 2007 and he needed the army post in the interests of Pakistan?s peace process with India, the war on terrorism and economic progress.

 Dressed in a suit and tie, Musharraf blamed the Islamists for his decision to go back on his vow, saying they had not kept to a promise to avoid confrontation to allow the government elected in 2002 to complete its five-year term.

 Musharraf first announced his intention to hold on to his army post in an interview with a private Pakistani regional television channel this month, but today?s broadcast was the first time he had spoken of his decision via state media.

 Asif Ali Zardari said he will travel to Dubai soon for an emotional reunion with his wife after spending eight years in jail. Zardari said he would be flying from Karachi two days after the government returned his passport and lifted a travel ban against him.

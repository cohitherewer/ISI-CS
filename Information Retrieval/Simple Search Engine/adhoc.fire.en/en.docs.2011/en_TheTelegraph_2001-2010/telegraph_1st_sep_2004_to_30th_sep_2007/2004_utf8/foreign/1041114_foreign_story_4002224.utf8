 1000 rebels killed in Falluja

 Baghdad, Nov. 13 (Reuters): 

 US and Iraqi forces have killed more than 1,000 insurgents 

 in the battle to retake the Sunni city of Falluja, an Iraqi 

 minister said today.

 ?More than 1,000 Saddamists and terrorists have been killed. Around 200 have been arrested,? said Kasim Daoud, minister of state for national security, said. ?The operations are almost over. There are only pockets of resistance left in the city.?

 Insurgents do not disclose their losses and there was no independent confirmation of the figures Daoud provided.

 US Marine Lieutenant General John Sattler said yesterday his forces occupied about 80 per cent of Falluja, but that even within that area there was still ?clearing up? to do. The military says 22 US and five Iraqi troops have been killed and 170 US soldiers wounded.

 An Iraqi Red Crescent convoy entered Falluja today with the first aid supplies to reach the city. Thirty volunteers with five trucks and three ambulances drove into the city, 50 km west of Baghdad.

 Osama in poll boycott call

 Dubai, Dec. 27 (Reuters): An audio tape purportedly from al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden has urged Iraqis to boycott January parliamentary elections, Arabic Al Jazeera television said today.

 Shortly before airing the tape, the television said bin Laden backed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as the Islamist network?s leader in Iraq.

 Earlier this month, an audio tape purportedly from bin Laden urged militants to concentrate their attacks on Iraqi and Gulf oil facilities, saying it was the most powerful weapon against America.

 After that tape was posted on the Internet, an intelligence official in Washington said an analysis had determined with ?high confidence? that the tape contained the voice of bin Laden. 

 In Baghdad, a suicide car bomber hit one of the biggest Shia parties running in elections next month, killing 13 people but missing its leader ? hours before the most prominent Sunni party withdrew from the historic poll.

 The bomb exploded outside the Baghdad head office of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), a party set up in exile in Iran to oppose Saddam Hussein and one of the strongest groups contesting the January 30 election.

 Later today, in a move repeatedly hinted at in recent weeks, the Iraqi Islamic Party, a leading force among the Sunni minority, said it was withdrawing from the poll because violence in Sunni areas meant it would not be free or fair. 

 ?We are withdrawing,? party leader Mohsen Abdel Hamid said. ?We are not calling for a boycott, but we said we would take part only if certain conditions had been met and they have not,? he said. 

 Victims of the bombing, in which police said about 50 people were wounded, included several receptionists and guards at SCIRI?s headquarters. 

 The office is also home to party leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who was there at the time. He called it an assassination attempt but said SCIRI?s thousands-strong militia would not retaliate. ?We have chosen the path of non-violence and we will stick to it,? he said. ?The only ideology these people know is terror. We laid down our arms in favour of pluralism. If we wanted violence we would have responded a long time ago.?

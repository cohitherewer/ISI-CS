 Hopes for Arnie T4 return

Los Angeles, Sept. 25 (Reuters): He has his 

hands full as governor of Kah-lee-forn-ee-ah, but producers of the next Terminator 

movie are talking to Arnold Schwarzenegger in hopes that he?ll be back for at 

least a small role, a spokesman for backers of the film said yesterday.

 Fourteen months after Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had its premiere, development of T4 is in full swing with the same producers aiming to start shooting next year, said Dennis Higgins, a spokesman for financing partner Intermedia.

 Talks also are under way with Terminator 3 director Jonathan Mostow to return for the next sequel, and he is overseeing the draft of a script by writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who shared screenplay credits on the last film, Higgins said.

 The Terminator series ranks as one of the most successful film franchises ever. Terminator 2: Judgment Day, grossed more than $500 million worldwide after its 1991 release.

 One question producers have is whether Schwarzenegger can tear himself away from the demands of state government long enough to return as the virtually indestructible, lead-slinging cyborg from the future. The actor-turned-politician clinched a record $30 million salary to reprise his signature film role in T3. ?We?re certainly talking to Arnold and his people,? Higgins said. ?He obviously has a day job that he has to take into consideration. But we?re talking to him.?

 A source close to the production acknowledged that it was unlikely that Schwarzenegger would be available to star, but said producers hoped that he could play a ?minor role?. Schwarzenegger?s personal financial adviser Paul Wachter said: ?It is not even on our radar screen ... Arnold is signing bills.?

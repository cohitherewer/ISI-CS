 Tired of violence, Nepalis call for peace

 Kathmandu, Dec. 27 (Reuters): Tired and angry after years of violence, tens of thousands of Nepalis marched through the capital today to urge the government and Maoist rebels to start talks to end a crippling revolt.

 More than 50,000 students, teachers, party activists, rights workers and members of citizens? groups carried placards and shouted slogans demanding an immediate end to the rebellion in which more than 10,500 people have died. The demonstrators, marching with red and blue banners, also demanded schools not be targeted in the fighting.

 ?This is too much. The country cannot bear it any more,? said student leader Thakur Gaire, a member of the All Nepal National Free Students? Union, one of several groups that organised the rally. Kathmandu has in recent weeks been rocked by a string of bomb blasts blamed on Maoists who are fighting for a communist republic to replace the constitutional monarchy.

 ?Let us live in peace,? read a placard carried by fifth-grader Sadhana Parajuli. Protesters also urged the guerrillas to call off a crippling traffic ban on the main highway linking Kathmandu with the southern plains and India. The ban has disrupted oil and food supplies to the capital, home to 1.5 million people, since last week.

 Human rights groups and media reports said the Maoists were forcing students to join their rebellion while soldiers used school buildings as barracks. 

 Rebel violence has increased in the run-up to a January 13 deadline set by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to begin talks.

 Deuba has vowed to hold parliamentary elections, which the rebels oppose, in April if they fail to respond.

 The Maoists have rejected the offer.

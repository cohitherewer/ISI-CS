 Hollywood flavour of month seeks time at top

 Diane Kruger

 Los Angeles, Sept. 3 (Reuters): 

 German actress Diane Kruger is well aware she is Hollywoods 

 latest rising star, but with new film Wicker Park 

 tomorrow and National Treasure this autumn, she wants 

 to show some staying power.

 The 28-year-old, who turned heads this summer playing beauty Helen of Troy in the international hit Troy, said it was important to make a career in the US.

 Im the flavour of the month for now, and I know that there are 50 people behind me waiting to get their big break. It makes me anxious. Im very cautious thinking Ive arrived anywhere, she said.

 With a leading role in romantic drama Wicker Park, opposite Josh Hartnett, and thriller National Treasure with Nicolas Cage out in November, Kruger gets a chance to show acting skills that have been honed in about two years of movies, mostly in Europe.

 German-born Kruger now lives in Paris with her husband, actor-director Guillaume Canet, and she was coaxed into acting from fashion modelling by French director Luc Besson.

 Troy brought little screen time, but massive notoriety stories in magazines, celebrity TV shows and, of course, tabloid talk and paparazzi pot shots.

 Whats bad is paparazzi. When you cant go down to a dry cleaner, thats weird. When they write stuff thats not true, thats not fun, she said. Its nice when people appreciate your work; thats why you get in this business, too.

 Wicker Park was made before Troy, but is now making its way to US theatres. Set in Chicago and based on the French film Appartement, the movie stars Hartnett as a man, Matthew, who returns to the town he left two years earlier after his love, Lisa (played by Kruger) ran away inexplicably.

 Matthew, a one-time aspiring photographer, is now engaged to another woman. As much as Kruger loathes paparazzi, Matthew hates the life he thinks he is about to lead. Fate intervenes when Matthew thinks he sees Lisa in Chicago. Through flashbacks, audiences learn why the two lovers split and then wonder if they will be together again.

 Its quite different (from Appartement), Kruger said. Thank God, because I hate cheap remakes.

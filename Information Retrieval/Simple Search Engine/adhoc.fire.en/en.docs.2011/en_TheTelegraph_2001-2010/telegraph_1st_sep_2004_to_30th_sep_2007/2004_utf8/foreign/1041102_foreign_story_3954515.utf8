 Rebels rubbish Lanka peace plan

 Kilinochchi, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Sri Lanka?s Tamil Tiger rebels today dismissed a new government blueprint for peace after two decades of civil war without even seeing it, dashing hopes that stalled peace talks will resume soon.

 Even as visiting Japanese peace envoy Yasushi Akashi voiced optimism both sides would soon return to talks, Tiger political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan said the rebels would settle for nothing less than interim self-rule in the war-torn north and east.

 ?We shall not accept any alternative proposals, neither will our people accept any alternative proposals discarding the interim self-governing authority,? Thamilselvan said after talks with Akashi in the rebels? northern stronghold of Kilinochchi.

 ?Mr. Akashi did not bring any realistic or productive message from the government. The present climate does not facilitate a permanent solution, because the government is making different statements every day.? 

 He was speaking hours after returning home from a month-long tour of Europe, to seek funding and support for the rebels.

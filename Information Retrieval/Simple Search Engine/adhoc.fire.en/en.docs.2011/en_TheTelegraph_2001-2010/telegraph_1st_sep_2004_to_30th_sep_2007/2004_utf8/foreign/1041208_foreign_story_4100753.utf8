 Condom chaos

 Seoul, Dec. 7 (Reuters): South Korea has shelved a plan to replace the English word for condom with a Korean word after a string of complaints from people with identical or similar sounding names.

 The Korean Anti-AIDS Federation said it would drop the use of a suggested new word for condom,?ae-pil?, which was derived from the Chinese characters for love and necessity.

 The name, picked from 19,000 suggestions sent in by the public, had prompted complaints from many South Koreans with similar-sounding characters in their names, federation official Kim Hoon-soo said.

 old lady called to complain, saying she was worried about her grandson being teased due to her name being ?condom?,? Kim said.

 Heavy win

 London (Reuters): Scotland can finally 

 declare themselves sporting heavyweights after winning the 

 Elephant Polo World Championship in Nepal. The Scots snared 

 the 2004 title after a week-long tournament in Nepal?s Royal 

 Chitawan National Park. ?It?s fantastic for Scotland ? we 

 don?t normally win a huge number of tournaments these days,? 

 team captain the Duke of Argyll said. The Scots beat local 

 favourites National Parks of Nepal, 12-6 on Friday last 

 week, winning back a crown they held in 2001, in a game 

 where a foul is declared if an elephant picks up the ball 

 with its trunk. Elephant polo is similar to normal polo 

 but the pitch is smaller and the four competitors on each 

 side play two 10-minute ?chukkas?. 

 Hard Crue 

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Motley Crue, the hard-living Los Angeles heavy metal band that symbolised rock ?? roll excess in the 1980s, is reuniting for a world tour beginning next February in Florida, it announced on Monday. The foursome?s original members last played together six years ago, when drummer Tommy Lee ? embroiled in domestic difficulties with then-wife Pamela Anderson ? quit to form a short-lived side project. Vocalist Vince Neil, bassist Nikki Sixx and guitarist Mick Mars briefly continued with other drummers, before pulling the plug a few years ago. The hiatus marked the end of a two-decade run that produced hits like Dr Feelgood, Kickstart My Heart and Girls Girls Girls, as well as enough debauchery to fill a book: the band?s 2001 memoir The Dirt (co-written with journalist Neil Strauss).

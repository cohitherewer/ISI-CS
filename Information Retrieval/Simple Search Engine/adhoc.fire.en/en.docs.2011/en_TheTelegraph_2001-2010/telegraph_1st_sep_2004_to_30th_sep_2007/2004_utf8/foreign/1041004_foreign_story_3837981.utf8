 Teresa Kerry told to lie low

 PHILIP SHERWELL 

 John Kerry with Teresa Heinz Kerry: Asset or liability?

 Miami, Oct. 3: Democratic 

 election advisers have ordered Teresa Heinz Kerry to adopt 

 a lower profile in the final stages of the campaign by her 

 husband, Senator John Kerry, for the White House because 

 they fear that she may be alienating voters.

 Heinz Kerry, who as the heiress to the Heinz fortune is one of the world?s richest women, has been told to keep out of the spotlight because her outspoken and unpredictable manner is regarded as an electoral liability. 

 With less than a month until the election, Kerry is behind George W. Bush in the polls, although aides hope that his performance last week in the first presidential debate will give his campaign a boost.

 Kerry drafted veterans of the Clinton White House, including the former press secretary Joe Lockhart, into his team last month to reinvigorate his campaign.

 They warned that his wife appeared to be costing him votes and have instructed Heinz Kerry ? who was born in Africa to Portuguese parents ? to confine herself to mostly low-key events with only small numbers of voters. ?Teresa simply does not come across well to the general public,? said a female Democrat strategist.

 ?Part of that is a suspicion of her foreign roots, I?m afraid. But it?s also her manner that puts people off and that has been very frustrating. So now her job is to speak to specific and carefully-chosen groups rather than general campaigning.?

 Earlier in the campaign she caused controversies by telling a conservative newspaper reporter to ?shove it?, remarking that ?only an idiot? would oppose her husband?s health reform plans, and calling some of her own critics ?scumbags?. At one point, speaking to a black audience, she described herself as African-American.

 Advisers said that the problem was not just her tetchy outbursts. Her fortune, estimated at about $750 million (?417 million), foreign background and most significantly her inability to play the traditional role of supportive wife were all deemed to be harming her husband?s prospects.

 Aware that it would be impossible to silence her, strategists instead ordered Heinz Kerry, 66, to focus on small gatherings of mostly Democrat supporters, where she could galvanise the faithful. She was briefly back in the spotlight on Thursday night when she joined her husband on stage in Miami after the debate with President Bush. At the boisterous post-debate party she raised roars of approval when she asked the crowd: ?Did John Kerry rock, or what??

 Next day, however, while Kerry addressed rallies in Tampa and Florida in upbeat mood, his wife was pursuing a series of little-publicised local engagements elsewhere in Florida instead of introducing him on stage, as she would have earlier in the campaign.

 Her conservative detractors have successfully portrayed her as out of touch with middle America. Although her assertiveness may appeal in Democratic strongholds such as New York and Boston, across much of the country it contrasts unfavourably with the grace, manners and elegance of Laura Bush, the President?s wife.

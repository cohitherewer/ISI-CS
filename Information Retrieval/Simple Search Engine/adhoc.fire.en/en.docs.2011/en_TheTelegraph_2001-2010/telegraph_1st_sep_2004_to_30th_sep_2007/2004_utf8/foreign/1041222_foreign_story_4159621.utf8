 President to work with any Ukraine candidate

 Schleswig (Germany), Dec. 21 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin today dismissed suggestions an Opposition victory in Ukraine?s presidential election would deal him a personal defeat, saying he could work with either candidate.

 Putin was criticised in the West for overtly backing Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich in last month?s disputed contest and calling to congratulate him even before all votes were counted.

 Yanukovich now faces a re-run on Sunday against Opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko, after Ukraine?s Supreme Court annulled the November 21 vote on grounds of fraud, against a background of massive pro-Yushchenko street protests.

 Backing away from earlier sharp rhetoric in which he warned against outside forces pushing Ukraine into ?mass mayhem?, Putin said during a visit to Germany that he could live with a victory by either man.

 Asked if a Yushchenko victory would be a defeat for him, he said: ?I know Mr Yushchenko as I do the current Prime Minister Mr Yanukovich... He has also been a member of President (Leonid) Kuchma?s team, like Yanukovich, and so I don?t see any problem.? 

 Analysts say Putin miscalculated the strength of western reaction to the rigged election, and his failure to shape events in Ukraine to Moscow?s liking has damaged his standing with the Russian power elite. Today?s comments provided evidence that the Kremlin chief has withdrawn his backing for Yanukovich and may be steeling himself for a Yushchenko victory.

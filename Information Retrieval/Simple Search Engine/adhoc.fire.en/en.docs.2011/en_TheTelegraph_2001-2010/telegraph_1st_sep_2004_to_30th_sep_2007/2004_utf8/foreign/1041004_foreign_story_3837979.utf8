 Baby?s day out

 Tehran, Oct. 3 (Reuters): A 20-month-old 

 boy wandered for 9 km through the scorching desert of southeast 

 Iran before his parents followed his footprints and found 

 him sitting in an open irrigation channel, police said today.

 Errant toddler Ali Esfandiarpour had been playing at home in a small village near the town of Sirjan when his parents realised he was missing on Tuesday afternoon. He was tracked down late that night.

 ?His family, relatives, and other villagers started walking out into the desert to look for him,? said Abdolhossein Moghaddas, a police officer from the southeastern province of Kerman.

 ?Police and villagers followed his footsteps with torches until they found the boy sitting in an open channel used for irrigation. The boy started crying when he saw his parents,? he added.

 Esfandiarpour appeared unscathed by his trek.

 Prayer prod

 London (AP): Britons who say a Christian 

 prayer before tucking into their traditional roast on Sunday 

 were being urged to include in their thoughts the animals 

 they will eat. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 

 to animals has launched a service book, including prayers, 

 dedicated to animals slaughtered for food as well as those 

 used for laboratory tests or killed by hunters. It sent 

 the booklet to clergy across Britain to coincide with Animal 

 Welfare Sunday, an annual event falling on October 3 this 

 year.

 Bush urges Rumsfeld to stay, run Iraq war

 Washington, Dec. 4 (Reuters): President George W. Bush has asked defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld to stay on in Bush?s second term to keep running the Iraq war and adapting the US military to face post-Cold War threats like terrorism, a senior Bush administration official said today.

 As part of a broad overhaul of his second-term Cabinet, Bush nominated former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik to head the US homeland security department and accepted the resignation of health and human services secretary Tommy Thompson yesterday.

 Rumsfeld, 72, faced calls for his resignation last summer over the prisoner abuse scandal at Iraq?s Abu Ghraib prison, and some lawmakers have accused him of not sending enough troops to control Iraq after Saddam Hussein was toppled.

 But the White House decided it was better to stick with Rumsfeld at a time when the US is at war in Iraq, with more troops being sent to help the country get ready for the January 30 elections.

 Rumsfeld is also overseeing a major post-Cold War transformation of the US military to make the force more mobile and responsive to new threats such as terrorism.

 Bush met Rumsfeld on Monday and ?asked secretary Rumsfeld to stay in his post, and he has agreed,? the senior official said, calling Rumsfeld ?the right person? for the job.

 ?Secretary Rumsfeld is a proven leader during challenging times. We?re fighting a different kind of war and it?s crucial that we win this war,? the official said.

 Rumsfeld had made clear his preference to stay on in the job at least for a while. 

 Baghdad blasts

 Twin suicide car bombs blew up outside a police station near Baghdad?s Green Zone today, killing seven people and wounding 57 in the latest deadly strike against Iraq?s shaky security forces. The blasts also destroyed 35 vehicles.

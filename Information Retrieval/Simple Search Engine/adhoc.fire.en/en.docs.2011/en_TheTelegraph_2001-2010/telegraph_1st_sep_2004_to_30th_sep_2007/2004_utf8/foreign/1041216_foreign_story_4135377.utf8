 Twinkle toes have a ball

 Jill Halfpenny: Dancing dame

 London, Dec. 15 (Reuters): 

 The sequins are back.

 Ballroom dancing, buried 30 years ago by the disco craze, is booming again in Britain. Attendance at some dance schools has doubled after a nation of couch potatoes saw a string of celebrities strutting their stuff in a hit TV show and decided they could tango too.

 ?Ballroom dancing has got a bit of street cred now,? said dance teacher Len Goodman, a judge on Strictly Come Dancing that paired celebrities and professional dancers who were voted out by viewers one-by-one in weeks of fierce competition.

 ?This has given the dance business a cool image. I?ve now got twice as many people signing on at my two dance schools,? Goodman said, after the show?s final on Saturday attracted over 11 million television viewers.

 It firmly buried the standard image of ballroom dancing as the domain of overdressed couples twirling around the dance floor with fixed smiles and fake tans.

 The final of the show, a mix of the BBC?s venerable Come Dancing competition show and the Australian hit movie Strictly Ballroom, was won by flamboyant soap opera star Jill Halfpenny.

 She fought off stiff competition from Olympic gold medallist Denise Lewis and camp comedian Julian Clary to land the spoils.

 ?It was the same when Saturday Night Fever came out. Every dance school had marvellous business from people wanting to be John Travolta,? he said.

 ?Physical fitness and togetherness are the two big attractions of ballroom dancing,? said Keith Jones, a sprightly 83-year-old who is vice-president of the British Dance Council. ?Ballroom dancing has been with us since the 1920s,? he said. But he was the first to admit it was in need of a makeover.

 ?People used to have a go at us, watching Come Dancing and saying the couples had 200 yards of net and millions of sequins sewn on by their grandmothers. Now the image has been glamorised. I am thrilled ? it has come full circle.?

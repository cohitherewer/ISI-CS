 French ado about tree

 Paris, Dec. 18 (Reuters): A disputed Christmas tree is back on display at a French high school near Paris but only after officials declared it a pagan symbol that did not violate the official separation of church and state.

 Principal Thierry Vieusses, who took down the tree in Lagny-sur-Marne last week, reversed his decision after the French media ridiculed his reading of a new law on secularism in state schools.

 The row echoed a similar controversy when schools in Coudekerque-Branche cancelled their annual distribution of chocolate Saint Nicolas figures because the foil showed him wearing a headdress with a cross.

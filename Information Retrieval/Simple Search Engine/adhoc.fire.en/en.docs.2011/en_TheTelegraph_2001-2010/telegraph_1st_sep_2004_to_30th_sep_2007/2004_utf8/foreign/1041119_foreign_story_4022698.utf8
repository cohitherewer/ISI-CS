 Fine Print

 Lennon greatest

 London, Nov. 18 (Reuters): John Lennon has defeated Elvis Presley to be voted the greatest rock ?? roll icon of all time in a poll conducted by Q music magazine.

 Paul McCartney, Lennon?s fellow Beatle songwriter, managed just 12th place in the poll. In a special tribute to Lennon for the magazine, his widow, Yoko Ono said: ?He was a driven man: it was as if he knew that he was to stay on Earth for a relatively short time.?

 Lennon was gunned down by a deranged fan outside his New York apartment in 1980 at the age of 40. Yoko said: ?He changed people?s awareness in an incredible way, both with words and music. He was not afraid to tell the truth and thus give us a clearer picture of what was really going on.?

 Flush fever 

 Beijing (Reuters): It went through revolutions 

 in 1911 and 1949, and now, a half-century on, China is flushing 

 in a new era of a whole different sort ? toilets. Hygiene 

 experts from around the world have gathered in Beijing for 

 the fourth annual World Toilet Summit. City officials, wanting 

 to clean up Beijing?s image before the 2008 Olympics, have 

 lifted the lid on the capital?s reputation for smelly loos 

 and hope that building modern toilets will change people?s 

 habits. For most people, going to the lavatory in the capital 

 remains a bit of a hit-and-miss affair. Delegates argue 

 that citizens? ability to relieve themselves is a long-neglected 

 human right.

 Bush sleepless in New York

 New York, Sept. 3: The final lap of the US presidential election has begun.

 With just under two months to go before the polling date of November 2, President George W. Bush, who accepted the Republican partys nomination here last night, decided not to sleep in this city that never sleeps. 

 He left shortly after midnight to campaign early today in the swing state of Pennsylvania in an election that is a neck-and-neck race.

 His rival, Democrat John Kerry, resumed his campaign with a vicious attack on Bush and vice-president Dick Cheney accusing them of avoiding army service in Vietnam. Kerry had suspended campaigning during the four-day Republican National Convention, following a long tradition in US politics.

 Kerry, who is under attack from Republican Vietnam veterans said: I will not have my commitment to defend this country questioned by those who refused to serve when they could have and who misled America into Iraq. Let me tell you in no uncertain terms what makes someone unfit for office and unfit for duty. Misleading our nation into war in Iraq makes you unfit to lead our country.

 In his acceptance speech last night, President Bush pledged a safer world and a more hopeful America. He said: We have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for power, but because the lives of our citizens are at stake... We have led, many have joined and America and the world are safer.

 With a nation evenly split down the middle as voting day approaches, Bush was conciliatory to half of Americas eligible voters who do not agree with him. 

 In the last four years, you and I have come to know each other. Even when we dont agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand. 

 He touted his record in office and outlined plans for a second-term. Voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, the convictions we hold and the vision that guides us forward. 

 Reminiscent of the personality cult in communist states, the platform at Madison Square Gardens, from where Bush spoke, was hastily reconstructed yesterday in the style of a crowning arena. A huge, round carpet with the presidential seal was laid out on that platform for Bush to stand on. 

 The President cited new, slightly lower unemployment figures to insist that his economic policies were working. The effort drew a stinging response from Kerry. 

 Doing nothing while this nation loses millions of jobs makes you unfit to lead this country, he told Bush. 

 Letting 45 million Americans go without health care makes you unfit to lead this country. Letting the Saudi royal family control our energy costs makes you unfit to lead this country.

 The remainder of the campaign promises to be the most acrimonious in recent memory. Bush did not, however, let up even an inch in the defence of his policies in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

 Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy is coming to the broader West Asia.

 With the convention over, largely Democratic New Yorkers heaved a sigh of relief. 

 Thousands of them have fled the city because of the protests, security restrictions and a long weekend culminating in the Labour Day holiday on Monday.

 Most of the nearly 2,000 protesters arrested during the week were released without charges yesterday.

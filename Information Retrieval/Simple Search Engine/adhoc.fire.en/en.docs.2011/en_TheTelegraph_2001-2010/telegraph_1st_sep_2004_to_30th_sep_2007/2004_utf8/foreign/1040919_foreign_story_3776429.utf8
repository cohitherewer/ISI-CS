 Nepal frees trade union leaders tied to Maoists

 Kathmandu, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Nepal has freed two jailed trade union leaders linked to Maoist rebels after the union agreed to halt a campaign that had forced many leading businesses to shutdown, a mediator said today.

 Nepal?s top firms, including transport companies, a Coca Cola bottler and a power station, resumed operations on Thursday, some for the first time in more than a month, after the union withdrew demands that they close down.

 Bombs exploded outside two hotels that were asked to close and many businesses stayed shut despite government assurances that it would provide security.

 The All Nepal Federation of Trade Unions, which supports the Maoist campaign to replace Nepal?s constitutional monarchy with a communist republic, allowed the businesses to reopen after the government said it would free the two leaders and provide information about 22 others the union says are missing.

 ?They (the government) have fulfilled their commitment,? Malla K. Sundar, a human rights activist and mediator, said.

 The government, struggling to put down the Maoist revolt that has claimed 10,000 lives since 1996, says the union has agreed not to force industries to shut down in future. ?Now we have to see if the union also fulfils its commitment,? Sundar said.

 The union leaders were handed over late yesterday to mediators who brokered the deal. The union issued the threat to 12 firms in August and added another 35 to the list last week. Industry officials say the closure of the 47 businesses, which contribute more than $100 million in revenue, had affected thousands of workers in Nepal.

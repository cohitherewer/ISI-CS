 Ice on Eiffel

 Paris, Dec. 2 (Reuters): Paris? latest ice-skating rink may not be big, but at 57 meters up the Eiffel Tower you can?t beat the view.

 From next week, skaters will be able to practice their spins and figure-of-eights on the first floor platform of the Paris landmark with a breathtaking view over the capital?s rooftops.

 ?People will be ice-skating at the heart of the tower,? said Isabelle Esnous from the SNTE group running the tower. Around 80 people could skate on the 200 square-metre rink at a time. Esnous said nobody should be afraid of falling off the tower in a rush of sporting enthusiasm. ?It?s not on top of a void. The rink is set up on a platform, and all security measures are in place,? she said.

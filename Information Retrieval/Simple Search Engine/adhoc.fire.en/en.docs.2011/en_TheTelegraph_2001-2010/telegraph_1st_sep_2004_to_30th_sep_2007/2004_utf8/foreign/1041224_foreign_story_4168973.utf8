 UK govt steps up shredding documents

 London, Dec. 23 (Reuters): 

 Whitehall officials have stepped up the shredding of documents 

 before January when a law giving Britons access to more 

 information takes effect, the Opposition Conservative Party 

 said today.

 Conservative parliamentarian Julian Lewis said he had discovered records were destroyed at a faster rate this year than in previous years.

 The government denied any link between the deletion of records and the Freedom of Information Act which comes into force on January 1. The law will give the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years. But Lewis was ?very worried? by the steep rise in shredding.

 ?It?s typical of Mr Blair?s shameless government to have trumpeted a piece of legislation as opening up the workings of government to the people, when we can see that in reality they intend to conceal it so thoroughly that even future historians won?t be able to work out what happened,? said the lawmaker.

 Lewis, who has called for an investigation into the shredding, said answers to his written questions showed the department of trade and industry had destroyed 97,000 documents in 2003-2004, almost double the number in 1999-2000.

 The department of work and pensions destroyed 30 per cent more files this year than last. 

 The government said less than five per cent of records contain historically significant information worth preserving and officials destroy the rest.

 ?No departments have been told to destroy records in order to prevent their release under the Freedom of Information Act, and such a policy would run totally contrary to the governments intention to increase openness,? said the department of constitutional affairs in a statement.

 IRA not involved

 The IRA denied today that it was behind a ?22 million bank heist in Belfast earlier this week. ?We are dismissing any suggestion or allegation that we were involved,? a senior republican source said.

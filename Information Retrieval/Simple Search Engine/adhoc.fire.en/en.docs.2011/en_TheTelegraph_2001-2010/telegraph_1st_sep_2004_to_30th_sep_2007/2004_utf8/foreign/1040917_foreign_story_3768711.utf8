 Nepal firms reopen after a month

 Kathmandu, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Nepal?s top firms reopened for business today, some for the first time in more than a month, after a trade union linked to Maoist rebels withdrew threats against them.

 The All Nepal Federation of Trade Unions had demanded that 12 of the country?s leading firms close down last month, accusing them of unfair labour practices, a threat that was extended to another 35 firms last week.

 ?We are opening now. We will be fully operational by tomorrow,? said Rajiv Malla, general manager of Kathmandus luxury hotel Soaltee Crowne Plaza, closed after a bombing last month.

 The trade union withdrew the threat against the firms late yesterday after the government agreed to free two of its jailed leaders and provide information about 22 others it says are missing. 

 Nepal?s embattled government, struggling to put down the Maoist revolt that had claimed 10,000 lives since 1996, said the union had agreed not to force industries to shut down in future.

 ?Those who mediated the agreement have given us an assurance that there will be no more indefinite strikes or closures of industries by the other side in future,? cabinet spokesman Mohammed Mohsin said.

 Analysts said the Maoist union had faced pressure from other labour groups to withdraw the campaign, which hurt thousands of workers. Some unions had threatened to return to work tomorrow even if the strike was not called off.

 ?They probably did not want to face the wrath of workers in particular and people in general,? said Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of Nepali magazine, Samay.

 The affected firms included a Coca Cola bottling plant, a leading tobacco firm, a hydroelectric power plant, a key producer of hospital and industrial oxygen, a sugar factory and leading transport companies.

 Industry officials say the closure of the 47 businesses, which contribute more than $100 million in revenue to the cash-strapped government annually, had affected thousands of workers in the desperately poor Himalayan kingdom.

 Tiger Tops Limited, which runs the country?s oldest jungle lodge and is popular among western tourists, said the closure had threatened thousands of jobs.

 ?Tiger Tops maintains a strictly apolitical stance and regrets being drawn into a political matter that was no concern of the company,? it said in a statement. It reopened its doors today.

 Last month, the rebels called for a road blockade of Kathmandu, disrupting food and supplies to the hill-ringed capital of 1.5 million people for seven days.

 The US Peace Corps has withdrawn 87 volunteers working in education, health, sanitation and community development, temporarily suspending its 40-year involvement in Nepal after two bomb blasts at the American information centre in Kathmandu.

 Fidel?s fall fails to get US call

 Fidel Castro

 Havana, Oct. 22 (Agencies): Fidel Castro won?t allow himself to be put under general anaesthesia and America won?t say ?get well soon?.

 Extraordinary political and diplomatic sideshows have unfolded after the Cuban President fell down and fractured his left knee and right arm.

 Castro announced late yesterday in an open letter that he underwent surgery after he fell. The operation took three hours, after which he was put in a plaster cast. 

 He said he refused to undergo general anaesthesia because he did not want to abandon his responsibilities due to a temporary physical mishap. 

 Castro, 78, tripped as he walked down some steps from a stage after giving an hour-long speech at a graduation ceremony. The incident was shown live on Cuban television. 

 His arch enemy, the US, refused to wish him a speedy recovery, saying the situation of the Cuban leader was of ?little concern? to Washington.

 In a harsh reaction, probably unprecedented in diplomatic history, state department spokesman Richard Boucher said a stern ?no? to a question whether he would wish Castro a speedy recovery.

 ?There are, I think, various reports that he broke a leg, an arm, a foot, and other things, and I?d guess you?d have to check with the Cubans to find out what?s broken about Mr. Castro. We, obviously, have expressed our views about what?s broken in Cuba,? he said.

 Asked whether he was disappointed that America?s enemy was not ?more seriously wounded? in the fall, he said: ?I?m not going to express that kind of disappointment.?

 Boucher, however, parried a question on whether he would wish Castro a speedy demise, saying: ?I will leave the man?s health alone.?

 Claiming that the situation in Cuba was America?s primary concern, Boucher said: ?The situation of Mr. Castro is of little concern to us, but unfortunately of enormous importance to the people of Cuba, who have suffered very long under his rule. And we think that the kind of rule that Cuba has had should be ended.?

 But Castro, whose fall left several among the audience teary-eyed, did receive a phone call from at least one President ? his political ally and Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez who wished him a speedy recovery.

 Chavez, a former paratrooper, told supporters in Venezuela that Castro had joked with him about the fall by saying: ?I think I would have made a good parachutist.?

 Castro was driven 280 km to Havana in an ambulance and given local anaesthetic for the middle-of-the-night operation in a medical facility at his government?s headquarters, the Palace of the Revolution.

 ?My progress is good and I will not stop communicating with you,? Castro said in the letter.

 A leader of Cuba?s Roman Catholic Church said Castro was bound to recover. ?The man is so determined that he will rise up and walk, even if he has to limp,? the prelate told Reuters. But the incident has renewed uncertainty about how long the ageing leader can remain at the helm.

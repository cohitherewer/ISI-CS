 Buoyant Blair plans February snap poll

 PATRICK HENNESSY

 Tony Blair

 London, Oct. 31: Tony Blair has ordered his closest aides to draw up plans for a snap general election to be held in February, The Daily Telegraph has learnt.

 Alan Milburn, Labour?s new head of election strategy, has been told to launch a television and poster advertising blitz in the New Year and to put the party on a war footing under the campaign slogan ?Britain Is Working?.

 The plan will cause surprise at Westminster because all sides have, until now, been preparing for an election on May 5. Cherie Blair appeared to let the date slip in a speech this month to the Cheltenham Literature Festival when she said that charity receptions at Downing Street were ?fully booked until May 2005?.

 The Prime Minister is now understood to favour a February poll, however, to maximise his present opinion poll advantage over Michael Howard?s Conservative Party. He also hopes that Labour?s election campaign will benefit from a ?Baghdad bounce?, following what he hopes will be the successful staging of elections in Iraq at the end of January.

 Blair?s advisers have told him that he continues to be vulnerable on the key issue of trust and that if he delays polling day he will risk exposure to unforeseen problems both in Iraq and on domestic issues.

 The disadvantage of the plan is that Blair risks provoking taunts from his opponents that he is ?cutting and running? after less than four years of a parliamentary term, which in law could last five. 

 The last election was in June 2001 when Labour recorded a second landslide victory over the Conservatives, then led by William Hague.

 Milburn is understood to be briefing leading members of his team on the new plans this weekend. They include the newly appointed vice-chairman of the election planning group, Fraser Kemp, a senior government whip.

 Kemp is credited with masterminding Labour wins in recent by-elections in Birmingham Hodge Hill and Hartlepool. He is well practised in fighting quick campaigns.

 Milburn has told the Prime Minister that he is confident of delivering Labour?s third successive victory if a decision is taken in the New Year to call the election in February. 

 Blair has said that he wants to serve a third full term as Prime Minister, but not a fourth.

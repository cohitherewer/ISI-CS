 Sex shop snooze

 Berlin, Oct. 5 (Reuters): A German man got more excitement than he bargained for in a sex shop when he dozed off in a video booth, got locked in overnight and was mistaken for a burglar by police as he tried to get out, authorities said today.

 ?He?d had rather a lot to drink and had gone in to enjoy himself,? said a spokesman for police in the southwestern city of Mannheim. ?Seemingly the effects of the alcohol proved the strongest stimulus though. He fell asleep.?

 the 50-year-old woke up in the dark inside the closed sex emporium, he struggled in vain to get out, only to set off the shop?s alarms and alert police, who soon arrived. ?The officers initially thought he was a burglar,? the spokesman said. ?But he managed to provide them with proof that he was telling the truth.? 

 Ace act

 London (Reuters): Romantic comedy Wimbledon is still 

serving up the goods at the UK box office after it held onto to the top ranking 

spot, Screen International said on Tuesday.

 Despite a volley of mediocre reviews from critics, the love story about an unlikely British tennis star, featuring Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany, has proved a smash hit with UK audiences.

 It held off two new entries ? horror movie Saw and British gangster film Layer Cake.

 Saw, which stars Danny Glover, is a grisly tale revolving around two captives chained in a subterranean chamber as part of a plot by a psychopathic genius known as ?Jigsaw?. The highly rated Layer Cake, which opened in third spot, follows a successful cocaine dealer who is planning retirement before he is given the ultimate last job.

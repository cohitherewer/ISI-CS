 Fine Print

 Name game

 Jerusalem, Sept. 19 (PTI): The Israeli army has changed the code name of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon?s controversial ?disengagement plan? to evacuate settlers from Gaza Strip because it turned out to be a phrase from a prayer recited at Jewish funerals.

 Under pressure from religious leaders, the name ?Zohar ha-rakia? (brightness of the heavens), given to the plan by Israeli defence forces, was changed, media reports said today.

 The old name, randomly chosen by a computer, was a line from the ?El male rahamim? prayer, recited over graves on the thirteenth day after burial.

 Lock stock

 Francisco (Reuters): 

 Kryptonite, the leading US maker of bicycle locks said 

 it would replace some of its locks after word spread that 

 an ordinary pen could pick what had been thought to be some 

 of its toughest locks.

 Nicole kiss ends revolt

 Paris, Oct. 9: With a kiss planted on Nicole Kidman?s cheek, Karl Lagerfeld triggered an explosion of flashlights ? and the photographers? revolt was over.

 It had been the sort of strike threat that a paparazzi-plagued actress might welcome. Photographers on the fashion circuit ? who complain of being treated ?like the lowest of the low? ? had plotted to boycott the launch in Paris yesterday of Lagerfeld?s 2005 spring/summer collection for Chanel.

 The issue was presented in black and white terms. Because the event was being filmed, the photographers were told, they would have to wear black trousers, black jackets and white shirts to match the designer?s decor.

 This demand ? written in both English and French and handed out to more than 200 photographers who were covering Paris Fashion Week ? was angrily denounced by the men and women behind the cameras.

 The photographers said Chanel should have approached them more sensitively.

 However, in the end, most of the photographers did make some attempt to conform. Kidman?s face in the front row may be worth millions of dollars to the French fashion house, but it can also be worth as much as a thousand dollars to those who take her pictures. And the potential loss of that income had clearly played heavily on several minds.

 Cavan Pawson, from the London Evening Standard, had bought a ?128 black corduroy suit before travelling to Paris.

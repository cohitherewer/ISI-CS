 Europeans have bad e-mail etiquette

 London, Sept. 15 (Reuters): Europeans repeatedly offend people with their poor e-mail etiquette and many endanger their businesses but when it comes to openly lying about having received e-mails, the British are the worst.

 A survey for phone developers palmOne found Britons were twice as likely as other surveyed European countries to deny receiving e-mails.

 Of the 750 office workers surveyed across Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, 11 per cent of Britons said they often denied receiving e-mails, compared to just four per cent of Spaniards.

 Of the other e-mail sins, sloppy grammar, tactless comments and waffling all caused annoyance and humour was often misconstrued.

 Blitzing, the practice of sending the same e-mail to lots of people, was compared to being ?spammed by your colleagues?.

 Dr Peter Collett, formerly of the department of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said people were obsessed with e-mail.

 Of those surveyed, 62 per cent felt the need to see the e-mail as soon as it arrived but many did not realise that their response could affect business performance.

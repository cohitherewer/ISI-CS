 Iran offers to ease nuke fears

 Vienna, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Iran said today it might extend its partial freeze of uranium enrichment in order to ease Western fears about its nuclear ambitions but a US official dismissed this as a ploy to fend off tough UN action.

 ?I don?t reject the possibility...of continuing the suspension for an additional one or two months, but this will be decided by the policymakers,? Hossein Mousavian, Iran?s chief delegate to the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said.

 Mousavian, who earlier this week said Tehran would begin enriching uranium, was reacting to news that the US had compromised with France, Britain and Germany on a toughly-worded IAEA resolution that calls for an immediate halt to Iran?s uranium enrichment programme. US undersecretary of state John Bolton said it was an obvious attempt to fend off sanctions.

 Buddha halts strike

 Kathmandu, Nov. 30 (Reuters): Nepal?s Maoist rebels called off a general strike in west Nepal today to let delegates attend a global Buddhism conference near the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, a day after setting off bombs in the area.

 Guerrilla leaders issued a statement to local media saying the two-day strike, which was to begin today in Rupandehi district, had been withdrawn in response to appeals from Buddhist and human rights groups not to disrupt the meeting at Lumbini.

 ?We have also instructed our cadres to stop all armed activities in the district during the three days of conference from November 30,? the statement said.

 Nepal deployed hundreds of extra troops after at least three bombs exploded but caused no injuries on Monday in Rupandehi district, which is roughly 20 km from Lumbini, the birthplace of the founder of Buddhism.

 Ten Maoist guerrillas were killed in different gunbattles across the kingdom over the past 24 hours, an army officer said.

 Roller request

 Seattle, Dec. 8 (Reuters): A Polish man travelled more than 4,800 km on rollerblades to Microsoft Corp?s headquarters to ask chairman Bill Gates pay the medical costs of two disabled Polish girls, the company said yesterday.

 Krzysztof Dzienniak, 24, rolled into Microsoft?s Redmond, Washington, campus on Monday after setting off from New York in late August to raise money for seven-year-old Monika Mosur, who was born with hydrocephalus, and Patrycja Bialkowska, a 10-year-old who lost a foot in an accident. Hydrocephalus is a condition characterised by the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the brain.

 Although Dzienniak did not get to meet Gates, who was out of town, he did convince Microsoft executives to set up a special employee-contribution fund for the girls.

 Dzienniak, who lives in Warsaw and read about the girls? plight, said he was inspired to make the trip by the movie Forrest Gump. He wore out three pairs of rollerblades, or inline skates. 

 Copy cat

 Beijing (Reuters): A young Chinese author, 

 whose love stories are adored by teenagers, has been ordered 

 to pay $24,170 along with his publisher for plagiarising 

 another book. The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People?s Court 

 ruled that Guo Jingming, 21, and the Chunfeng Literature 

 and Art Publishing House, had to stop publishing Falling 

 Blossoms in a Romantic Dream, a story of entangled love 

 between youngsters, because of breach of copyright. Fellow 

 author Zhuang Yu, 25, filed a suit last December, seeking 

 compensation of 500,000 yuan after reading Guo?s 2002 bestseller 

 which went on to sell more than a million copies. 

 Furry glory

 Beijing (Reuters): Most countries honour their war dead, but China has erected a monument for a little thought of but altogether more cuddly martyr ? the mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys who gave their lives to science. Far from basking in the glory of scientific achievement after making strides with a potential Sars vaccine, Chinese researchers had taken time to commemorate the furry martyrs who paved the way for safe human testing, the official Xinhua news agency said. Yin Weiping, chief of the Sars vaccine development programme, said animal testing had been vital in developing the vaccine, which has passed the first stage of human trials. Accordingly, the Chinese Academy of Medical Science erected a monument to the fallen animals.

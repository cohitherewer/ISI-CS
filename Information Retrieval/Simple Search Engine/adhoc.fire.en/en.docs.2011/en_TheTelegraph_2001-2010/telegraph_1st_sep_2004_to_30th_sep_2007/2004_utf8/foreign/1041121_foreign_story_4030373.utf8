 Greek fury greets Alexander

 Los Angeles, Nov. 20 (Reuters): Oliver Stone?s new film about Alexander the Great depicts the king as bisexual, fuelling outrage from Greeks and prompting Hollywood to ask if a world conqueror with dyed blond hair and waxed legs will be able to attract box office hordes.

 One newspaper calls it a case of ?Queer Eye for the Macedonian Guy.? Others have speculated that Stone, always a controversial filmmaker, is taking a big risk with a $160-million epic by including scenes of passionate embrace between Alexander and his best friend Hephaestion. A line from the film says: ?Alexander was defeated only once ? by Hephaestion?s thighs.? 

 Last summer?s blockbuster Troy, which could have portrayed Achilles and Patroclus as lovers, brushed aside any homoerotic elements to concentrate on Achilles desire for a Trojan princess.

 Everyone associated with Alexander, from Stone to star Colin Farrell, insist the film is historically accurate and reflects the pagan mores of around 330 BC when the Macedonian king captured the world?s mightiest empire, Persia, and pressed on to the ends of the Earth. 

 Farrell in a recent interview said he had no problem with the role because ?Oliver made the film as historically accurate as possible and ambivalent sexuality was something of the times and part of the character.?

 Stone said he kept the movie accurate and had an historian on the set. He added there was no question that Alexander had ?a polymorphous sensuality and was an explorer in the deepest sense of the word.?

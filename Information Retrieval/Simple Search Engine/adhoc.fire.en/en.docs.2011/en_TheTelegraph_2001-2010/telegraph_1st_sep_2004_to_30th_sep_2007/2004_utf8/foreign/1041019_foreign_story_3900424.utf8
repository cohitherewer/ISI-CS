 Engineers stop Pak work 

 Islamabad, Oct. 18 (Reuters): 

 China today voiced concern over the safety of its workers 

 in Pakistan as Chinese engineers working on a dam project 

 in a tribal region suspended operations after a colleague 

 was killed in a hostage-taking drama last week.

 Militants linked to al Qaida abducted two Chinese engineers working on the Gomal Zam dam project in the South Waziristan tribal region, near the Afghan border, on October 9.

 China supplies Pakistan with military hardware and hundreds of millions of dollars in finance. Islamabad is concerned that the threat of Islamic militants, many of whom are hiding in tribal areas, could undermine economic ties with a major ally.

 Chinese vice-foreign minister Wu Dawei said he hoped the killing would not affect China?s relations with its long-time ally, but said Beijing was concerned for the safety of its nationals in Pakistan.

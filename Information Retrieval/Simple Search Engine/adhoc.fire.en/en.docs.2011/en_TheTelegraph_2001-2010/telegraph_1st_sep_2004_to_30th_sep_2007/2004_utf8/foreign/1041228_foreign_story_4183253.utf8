 Economic toll will be less

 Singapore, Dec. 27 (Reuters): Fishing villages have been wiped out and money-spinning tourist resorts wrecked, but the economic cost of the giant seismic waves that swamped coasts across south Asia will be much smaller than the human toll.

 Sri Lanka?s economy will be hardest hit and Thailands important tourism industry will have to pick itself up again after suffering setbacks from Sars and political unrest.

 But overall, Asia?s economies and markets are likely to suffer at most a glancing blow from the disaster.

 ?I do see some near-term impact from the unfortunate event but we?re not about to cut growth rates in response to it,? said Lian Chia Liang, an economist at JP Morgan Chase in Singapore.

 Spending to rebuild smashed hotels and infrastructure could offset lower tourism receipts in the next few months, he said. As Sri Lanka appealed for aid and global relief agencies swung into action, the IMF said it stood ready to help in any way it could.

 Financial markets, though, only flinched. Some travel shares tumbled and the Thai stock exchange was down 1.6 per cent, but the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah lost only a quarter of a per cent.

 ?It will be more of a story of human tragedy rather than economic costs,? said Song Seng Wun, an economist at brokerage GK Goh in Singapore.

 Arjuna Mahendran, chief economist and strategist at Credit Suisse in Singapore, noted that Southeast Asia?s bourses are dominated by property firms, banks and export-orientated manufacturers, which will be little affected by the catastrophe. ?I don?t think you?re going to have a major fall-out,? he said.

 But Mahendran, who used to head Sri Lanka?s investment board, said the disaster would set back the island?s economy by a year and might even result in negative growth next quarter.

 Sri Lanka logged a record 500,642 tourist arrivals in 2003, boosted after a ceasefire the year before in a two-decade-old civil war pitting Tamil Tiger rebels and the government.

 The government had been hoping to double those numbers by 2010. But the tsunami, which killed 10,200 people in Sri Lanka and left hundreds of thousands homeless, destroyed transport links from Colombo to the main tourist destinations in the south of the island, where a string of luxury hotels was badly damaged.

 ?That is a major blow because tourism was the fastest-growing component of the economy,? Mahendran said. ?You?ll have to rebuild the roads and the railway lines and it?ll take about a year.?

 The timing could not be worse for Sri Lanka because its biggest industry, textiles, is bracing for big job losses when the end of international quotas on January 1 exposes it to the full blast of competition from cheap rival producers China and India.

 In Thailand, where 12 million tourists a year generate about 6 per cent of the country?s gross domestic product of about $160 billion, Nuchjarin Kasemsukworarat with SCB Securities said the disaster would do more damage to confidence than to output.

 ?I would say sentiment is hurt very badly,? Nuchjarin said.

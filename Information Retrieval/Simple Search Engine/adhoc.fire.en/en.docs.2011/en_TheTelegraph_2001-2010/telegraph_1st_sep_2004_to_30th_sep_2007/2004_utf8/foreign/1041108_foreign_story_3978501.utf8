 Miniskirt row cuts short political quest

 MELISSA KITE

 London, Nov. 7: A Conservative parliamentary candidate has quit, claiming that members of her local party told her to wear a short skirt and dye her hair to make her more appealing to voters.

 Amanda Harland, 33, who was due to fight the Colne Valley seat in West Yorkshire, said that she had been subjected to persistent bullying from veteran members of her local association.

 There were jibes about her lack of wealth and commitment as well as personal attacks on her appearance, she claimed. ?There were criticisms of my hair, that it needed trimming and re-styling,? she said. ?One of the male members told me the best way to win votes would be to wear a miniskirt,? she said.

 ?Another one said I should have short hair and re-do my highlights. It was the constant undermining of my position.?

 Harland moved to Colne Valley last year but said that she had immediately encountered opposition from her own party. ?They started to try and control and manipulate me,? she said. ?I was subjected to a constant stream of criticism. They criticised me in meetings and in front of members. They compared me to other candidates in the area. They said I hadn?t got a high enough profile in the press.

 ?They said I should spend all my free time devoted to the campaign. They made it very difficult for me to go on holiday. I wanted to go to Scotland for a few weeks in August and they didn?t like that.

 ?I got various comments made about the fact that I am not a wealthy person. I?m a very ordinary person living in an ordinary terraced house. Some made comments about the amount of money they give to the association, that they bankroll the association and they should have a say in the running of it.?

 Colne Valley is held by Labour?s Kali Mountford with a majority of 4,639 over the Tories. Harland, who is a PR consultant, is the second Conservative candidate to quit there in 18 months.

 Mike Flynn, the previous candidate, said that he had also been forced out. ?It was one of the most bruising and disheartening experiences of my life,? he said.

 ?When you tried to get anything done you just ran into a brick wall. It was thoroughly unpleasant and I wouldn?t recommend another candidate touch it.

 ?They have a certain way of doing things and it doesn?t involve talking to the voters.?

 Harland, a former Oxford councillor who coordinated the 1997 general election campaign in Wantage, claimed that some members of the association had begun to spread false rumours about her ? including that she had called her agent a ?silly bitch? ? in a bid to drive a wedge between her and her allies.

 Harland said that as well as sexist comments from male members, she had also faced hostility from older female members.

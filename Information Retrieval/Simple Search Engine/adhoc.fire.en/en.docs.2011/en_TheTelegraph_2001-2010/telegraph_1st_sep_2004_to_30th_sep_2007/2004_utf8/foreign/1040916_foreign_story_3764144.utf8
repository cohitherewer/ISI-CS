 Maoists end threat to companies

 Kathmandu, Sept. 15 (PTI): 

 The Maoists today withdrew their threat against multinational 

 companies operating in Nepal after the government agreed 

 to release two activists of the rebel-linked trade union 

 and disclose the whereabouts of 28 others.

 The Maoist move paves the way for 47 companies, including four Indian joint ventures, to re-open from tomorrow.

 The talks between the government and the All Nepal Trade Union Federation (Revolutionary) was brokered by human rights activists Padmaratna Tuladhar and president of the Human Rights Organisation of Nepal Sudip Pathak.

 The Maoists had shut down 12 companies, including the Indian joint venture Surya Nepal, and Hotel Soaltee Crowne Plaza from August 17 in the first phase. 

 In the second phase, 35 companies, including hotels, transport firms and manufacturing outfits, were shut down from September 10.

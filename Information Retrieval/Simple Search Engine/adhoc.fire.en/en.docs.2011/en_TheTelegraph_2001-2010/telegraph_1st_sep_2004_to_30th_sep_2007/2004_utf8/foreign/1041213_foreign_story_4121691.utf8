 Fresh row on Becks tableau

 David and Victoria Beckham in the tableau

 London, Dec. 12 (PTI): Cardinal Cormac Murphy-?Connor, head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, has condemned as ?tasteless? a nativity scene depicting soccer star David Beckham and his wife Victoria as Joseph and Mary.

 Cardinal Murphy-?Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster, said the scene in the Madame Tussauds Waxwork Museum, owned by the Tussauds group, was ?disrespectful? and caused ?damage? to the culture of this country.

 The scene also features singer Kylie Minogue as the archangel Gabriel, Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Duke of Edinburgh and President George W. Bush as the Three Wise Men.

 However, it is the casting of the footballer and his pop singer wife as Jesus and Mary which has caused particular outrage. 

 Cardinal Murphy-?Connor told Radio 4?s Today programme, ?It seems incredible that Christianity, particularly Christmas, is displayed in a way that is so tasteless, whether it is Posh and Becks in Madame Tussauds, which I thought was extremely tasteless, or any painting. What is happening?? He was referring to a booklet promoting Channel 4?s Christmas schedule, which lampooned Leonardo Da Vinci?s painting The Last Supper by replacing the figure of Christ with an actor holding a beer can in one hand and a cigarette in the other. 

 A spokesperson for the Beckhams said the couple had not been consulted about the use of their waxworks beforehand, but said that the museum had asked visitors to vote for the personalities that they wanted to see in the nativity roles. ?It is frustrating that someone has done this without their knowledge as David and Victoria do not want to offend anyone or be involved in it at all,? she said.

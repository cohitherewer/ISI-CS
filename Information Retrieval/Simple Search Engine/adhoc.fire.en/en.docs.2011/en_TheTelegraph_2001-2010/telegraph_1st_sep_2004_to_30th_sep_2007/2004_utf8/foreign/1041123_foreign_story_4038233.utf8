 Twist to unarmed man death

 Baghdad, Nov. 22 (AP): The NBC journalist who filmed the fatal shooting of an apparently injured and unarmed Iraqi by a US Marine inside a Falluja mosque has written on his website that the wounded man made no sudden movements before he was shot.

 Before the opening of the November 8 assault on the rebel-held city, Marine commanders told infantry men that the rules of engagement allowed the use of deadly force against men of miltary age deemed holding hostile intent, even if the enemy didn?t fire on the Marines first.

 In posting on his web blog dated yesterday, Kevin Sites, a freelancer on assignment for NBC, wrote that he didn?t see the wounded iraqi make any movement before the Marine shot him.

 ?Through my viewfinder I can see him (Marine) raise the muzzle of his rifle in the direction of the wounded Iraqi. There are no sudden movements, no reacing or lunging,? Sites wrote. ?However, the Marine could legtimately believe the man poses some kind of danger. Maybe he?s going to cover him while another Marine searches for weapons. Instead, he pulls the trigger,? Sites wrote.

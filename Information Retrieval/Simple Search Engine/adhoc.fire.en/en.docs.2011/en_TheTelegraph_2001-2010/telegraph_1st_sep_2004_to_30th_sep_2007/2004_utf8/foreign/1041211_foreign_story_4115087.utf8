 United Nations, Dec. 10 (Reuters): The Bush administration expressed confidence in UN secretary-general Kofi Annan yesterday and said he should stay in office, in a belated rebuff to demands from Republicans in Congress for his resignation.

 US ambassador John Danforth called reporters together to deliver the comments, saying that he had to clarify the US position after his colleagues and the media believed the US government was not supporting Annan.

 ?We are expressing confidence in the secretary-general and his continuing in office,? Danforth said, adding that he was speaking for the White House and state department.

 ?No one to my knowledge has cast doubt on the personal integrity of the secretary-general. No one,? he said.

 Senator Norm Coleman, a Minnesota Republican, who was later joined by five Congressmen, last week called for the resignation of Annan, who has two more years in office before completing his second five-year term.

 They accused him of presiding over corruption in the UN oil-for-food programme for Iraq, administered by the UN but supervised by the 15-nation Security Council.

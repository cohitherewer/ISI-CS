 Aid worker killed, says Jazeera

 Margaret Hassan

 Dubai, Nov. 16 (Reuters): 

 Al Jazeera said today it would not air a video showing a 

 gunman killing a woman, believed to be British-Iraqi hostage 

 Margaret Hassan.

 ?We will not air the tape because we respect the audience?s feelings,? said an Al Jazeera official, whose channel earlier announced it had received a tape of the killing. ?We can not be certain that the woman is Margaret Hassan,? he added. 

 Al Jazeera said the video showed a gunman killing a woman, believed to be Hassan. The British embassy in Baghdad confirmed that a video tape had surfaced appearing to show her being killed. Dublin-born Hassan was seized on October 19 while on her way to work at Care International. She has appeared in video tapes released by her unknown captors calling on the British government to withdraw its troops from Iraq.

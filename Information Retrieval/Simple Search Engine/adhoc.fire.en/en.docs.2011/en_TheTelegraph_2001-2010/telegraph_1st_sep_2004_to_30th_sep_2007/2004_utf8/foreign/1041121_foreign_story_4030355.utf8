What cost a celebrity coiffure?

 Kirsten Dunst: Hot hairdo 

New York, Nov. 20: In a recent weekday afternoon, 

Orlando Pita, hairdresser to celebrities like Jennifer Connelly, Naomi Campbell 

and Kirsten Dunst, received a client in his new salon, Orlo, on the third floor 

of a nondescript walkup on Gansevoort Street.

Pita, 42, stood mesmerised behind the woman?s brunette 

head, puzzling in a way that suggested he was examining a compelling piece of 

abstract art. He worked in monastic silence, his scissors venturing only the most 

tentative stabs. With each move, he stepped back, occasionally blowing the hair 

with a drier, watching the way it waved under the heat, his brow pressed in concentration.

The entire process lasted about 80 minutes. And each 

minute cost about $10: Pita charges $800 for a haircut. 

If that seems like an extraordinary sum to charge, 

consider that New York has always been the hub of the outrageously expensive coiffure. 

But what?s different now is that there seems to be a race for the stratosphere, 

as if a haircut was the new luxury item. 

As big-ticket hairdressers sprout all over Manhattan 

? with an especially dense concentration in the district formerly known for meatpacking 

? stylists, salon owners and customers are loudly debating exactly how much is 

too much.

Pita defended his $800 price tag, a new high for the 

city, and a fee that is the equivalent of twice the annual income of the average 

citizen of Bangladesh. 

?Your hair is one of the first things people notice 

about you,? he said. ?You can spend a lot on clothes, but you wear your hair every 

day. The luxury market is not about needs, or ?Is it worth it?? It?s about ?What 

can I spend???

For years, New York stylists have been commanding 

prices many times higher than in most other places. Robbin McClain, the editor-in-chief 

of American Salon, a trade magazine, said her antennae first perked up 

several years ago upon hearing that John Sahag, the onetime tonsorial minister 

to clients like Jennifer Lopez, was charging $400 for a cut. ?At that time that 

seemed really outrageous,? McClain said. 

In the last year, several high-profile hairdressers 

have opened salons with big ambitions or big price tags. Leading the fray was 

Sally Hershberger, whose eponymous salon opened on West 14th Street last fall. 

Ms. Hershberger, who became famous for the shaggily demure style worn by Meg Ryan, 

charges $600.

According to a report by American Salon, the 

average women?s haircut in the US costs about $21 for a cut in a salon with fewer 

than six chairs, up to $44 for a salon with more than 13 chairs. So what makes 

a haircut that costs 14 to 18 times the average high-priced salon haircut in the 

rest of the country worth it in New York? 

?Look, even $250 is expensive,? Hershberger said over 

a high-protein breakfast on Thursday, her hair scrunched in a style college students 

typically refer to as ?bed head?. ?But you have to remember, hair is the first 

thing people notice. When you get a facelift, people say, ?Hey, you look great, 

did you change your hair???

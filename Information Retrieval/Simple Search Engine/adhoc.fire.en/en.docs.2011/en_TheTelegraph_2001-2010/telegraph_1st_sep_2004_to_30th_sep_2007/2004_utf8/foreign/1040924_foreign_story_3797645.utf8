 Whole thing is ridiculous, says Stevens in London

 London, Sept. 23 (Reuters): Muslim convert and former pop star Cat Stevens returned to Britain today after his deportation from the US over ?potential? terrorism links sparked an Anglo-American diplomatic row.

 ?The whole thing is totally ridiculous,? Stevens said on arrival at London?s Heathrow airport. ?Half of me wants to smile, half of me wants to growl.? UK Muslim leaders were outraged. ?The US is shutting down its house, building walls around itself,? said Anas Altikriti, spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain.

 Stevens, 56, was travelling with his daughter on a United Airlines flight on Tuesday from London to Washington when American officials diverted it 600 miles to Bangor, Maine.They said he was denied entry to the US because his activities could be linked to terrorism.

 The deportation of Stevens, known as Yusuf Islam since he stopped singing and became a Muslim almost three decades ago, led foreign secretary Jack Straw to complain personally to US secretary of state Colin Powell at the UN. Straw ?expressed concern that this action should not have been taken?, a foreign office spokesman said.

 ?It?s crazy,? Stevens added. ?Everybody knows me from my charitable work and now there has to be explanations, but I?m glad to be home.?

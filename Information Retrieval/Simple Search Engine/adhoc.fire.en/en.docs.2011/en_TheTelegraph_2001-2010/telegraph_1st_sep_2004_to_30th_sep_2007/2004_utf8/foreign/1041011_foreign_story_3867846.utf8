 Taiwan peace signal to China

 Taipei, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian used his National Day speech today to call for peace talks with arch foe China and urge adoption of a system to prevent an outbreak of conflict in the narrow strait dividing them.

 In an about-face, Chen said the two sides should resume dialogue based on a 1992 understanding over interpretation of Beijing?s cherished ?one China? principle, raising the prospect of breaking a five-year deadlock.

 The Taiwan Strait has become one of Asia?s most dangerous flashpoints since Chen?s re-election in March. Communist-ruled China is convinced that Chen will push the island it sees as a rebel province towards formal statehood in his second four-year term ? a move that Beijing has said would lead to war.

 ?In the long term, both sides should formally end the state of hostility across the Taiwan Strait and establish confidence-building measures through consultations and dialogues,? Chen said at National Day festivities in front of the Presidential Office.

 A lack of communication had seen the island drift further apart from the mainland, he said.

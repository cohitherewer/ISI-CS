 Locust lunch

 Nicosia, Nov. 7 (Reuters): In their struggle to cope with an invasion of desert locusts, Cypriot farmers may do well to turn to a UN site that counsels if you can?t beat them eat them.

 Locusts are rich in protein and can be stir-fried, boiled or roasted, is one nugget of information provided by the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation in a drive to help deal with locust swarms that have landed in Cyprus from Africa.

 ?Here are a few local recipes from locust-affected countries,? a page on the FAO website says. ?Please send us yours!?

 One recipe from a tribe in southern Africa advises grinding roast locust to a fine powder to eat on a journey. ?The legs, when dried, are especially relished for their pleasant taste.?

 Bloody tale

 Los Angeles (Reuters): The makers of 

 the new hit horror film Saw found a new way to market 

 their gory film ? they let blood donors in for free. Lions 

 Gate Films said a promotional offer in October of free screenings 

 and T-shirts to people who donated blood paid off. Moviegoers 

 gave 4,200 pints of blood ? enough to help save over 585 

 lives in the US Pacific Northwest in two days, according 

 to Sandi Sundquist Lesh, a spokeswoman for the American 

 Red Cross.

 Rally ruse

 Santa Maria (Reuters): Prosecutors said on Friday they have evidence that Michael Jackson?s legal team organised rallies for the pop star shortly after he was charged with child molestation. Deputy district attorney Ron Zonen said that during a raid on the home of Jackson?s personal assistant in September, authorities found material showing the defence had coordinated the demonstrations in a bid to ?generate crowds, publicity and media coverage?.

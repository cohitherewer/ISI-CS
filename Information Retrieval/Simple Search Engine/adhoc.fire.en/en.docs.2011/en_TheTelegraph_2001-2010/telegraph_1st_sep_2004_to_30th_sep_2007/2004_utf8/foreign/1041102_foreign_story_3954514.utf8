 Bleary-eyed bosses in a bad mood

 London, Nov. 1 (Reuters): 

 A quarter of Britain?s bosses are likely to be in a bad 

 mood at work because of too little sleep, research released 

 today showed.

 The study, titled Dream On: Sleep in the 24/7 Society, found half of sleep-deprived managers admitted to shouting at colleagues because of tiredness. Nineteen per cent said they were likely to make mistakes.

 ?These sleep-deprived and shouty managers with a tendency to make mistakes are responsible for millions of British workers. It?s hardly a recipe for good management,? said Charles Leadbeater, author of the report for independent think-tank Demos and retailer IKEA.

 Among the general population, 39 per cent said they needed more sleep. Children were a main reason behind sleepless nights, while worries about work pressures and snoring partners were also mentioned as causes.

 To solve the problem, the report suggested filling city centres with ?shut-eye pods?, allowing people to take a quick nap. 

 It also encourages people to nap at work and recommends awarding ?catch-up days?, particularly to those with young children.

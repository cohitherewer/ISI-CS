 The Boss to join Kerry at rallies

 New York, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Going above and beyond his participation in the Vote for Change tour, Bruce Springsteen will join John Kerry at a handful of upcoming rallies. 

 The Boss is expected to speak and perform at stops in Wisconsin and Ohio, the latter being one of the swing states in which he and his E Street Band shared a concert bill earlier this month with R.E.M., John Fogerty and Bright Eyes.

 The first appearance will be Thursday, October 28 on the Ohio State University campus in Columbus, and the State Capitol Square in Madison, Wisconsin, according to Kerry?s official website (http://www.johnkerry.com).

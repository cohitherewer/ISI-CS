 Dolly scientist seeks licence

 Prof. Ian Wilmut

 London, Sept. 28: The British scientist who created Dolly the sheep has applied for a licence to clone human embryos in the hope of finding a cure for motor neurone disease.

 Prof. Ian Wilmut has sent his request to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to enable him to clone cells from sufferers of the debilitating condition to discover how the disease develops.

 If the licence is granted, it will be only the second time scientists in Britain have been given the go-ahead to clone human embryos for medical research.

 The application is likely to anger pro-life campaigners and fuel the controversial debate on so-called therapeutic cloning. Prof. Wilmut and a team at the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, created Dolly, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell, in 1996.

 Prof. Wilmut said: ?Knowledge often does have two edges to it. We owe it to the people who suffer from it (motor neurone disease) and are going to suffer from it in the future to try and develop treatments for them.?

 He said cloning is necessary because the key cells are in the central nervous system of the sufferers and therefore cannot be analysed themselves.

 MND affects the motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which are the nerve cells along which the brain sends instructions, in the form of electrical impulses, to the muscles. 

 Their degeneration leads to weakness and wasting of muscles, usually in the arms or legs, but it can also affect the muscles in the face and throat.

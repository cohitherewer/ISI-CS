 Bush beats Osama in UK art prize

 London, Dec. 7 (Reuters): George W. Bush?s home town in Texas has beaten Osama bin Laden?s villa in Afghanistan to land one of Britains best-known and controversial art prizes.

 Crawford, Texas ? where the US President has his ranch ? is the starting point for a video journey filmed by British artist Jeremy Deller, who won the ?25,000 Turner Prize for his work late yesterday. The video ends in Waco, Texas, scene of the siege at the headquarters of the Branch Davidian religious sect in 1993.

 Among the other pieces submitted for the prize was a virtual video tour of an empty villa in Afghanistan which was once occupied by Bushs nemesis bin Laden. 

 The Turner Prize nearly always stirs heated debate over what is art. 

 Winners have ranged from a Virgin Mary figure made of elephant dung to an empty room with a bare light that switched off and on.

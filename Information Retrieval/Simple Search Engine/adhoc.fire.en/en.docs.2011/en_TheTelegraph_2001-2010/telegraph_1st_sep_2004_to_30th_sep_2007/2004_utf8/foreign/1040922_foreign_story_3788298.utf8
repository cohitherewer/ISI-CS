 Kilmer takes a biblical risk

 EVAN HENERSON

 (Top) Charlton Heston 

 in a scene from Ten Commandments and Val Kilmer 

 Los Angeles, Sept. 21: It?s 

 a big-budget musical spectacle based on a biblical tale. 

 It contains dialogue that?s sung throughout the performance, 

 making the entire effort more like opera than Broadway, 

 and it?s having its American premiere in Los Angeles. 

 Talk about your potential financial 

 ?thou shalt not...?

 No, a stage version of The 

 Ten Commandments won?t be an easy sell, even with a 

 glut of promotion and movie star Val Kilmer?s bearded face 

 peering out from billboards and the sides of buses across 

 the city. 

 But Kilmer, the man who figures 

 to be the project?s biggest draw, says he?s undaunted. ?(Producer) 

 Max Azria lives here and he said: ?Why don?t we do it in 

 LA first??? says Kilmer, who will play Moses, a role he 

 voiced in the 1998 DreamWorks animated film The Prince 

 of Egypt. ?And everyone said: ?You can?t open a show 

 this big in LA.? He couldn?t find a reason. It was just 

 these weird rules that got written sometime back. 

 ?I hope LA audiences kind of like 

 it. I don?t know what I?m asking for,? he continues. ?If 

 it?s not entertaining, people won?t come. They won?t come 

 just because it started here.?

 The production of The Ten Commandments: 

 The Musical, which opens at the Kodak Theatre, is actually 

 a reworked version of a show that debuted in 2000 in Paris. 

 The new Commandments is produced by fashion designer 

 Azria, communications maven Charles Cohen and the two men?s 

 company, BCBGMaxAzria Entertainment. It is scheduled to 

 open at Radio City Music Hall in New York in early 2005 

 and is also expected to tour. 

 For the moment, however, the cast 

 of 50, director Robert Iscove and assorted technical stage 

 miracles are in Hollywood. Which is sort of fitting. The 

 same city that produced the 1956 Cecil B. DeMille epic of 

 the same name will now be home to the burning bush, assorted 

 plagues and the parting of the Red Sea on stage. The same 

 stage where the Oscars are distributed, no less. 

 Kilmer, who conducted a certain 

 amount of research for Prince of Egypt, certainly 

 hasnt tired of dissecting the character. Chatting 

 during a rehearsal lunch break at Paramount Studios, the 

 43-year-old Chatsworth High School graduate says he has 

 long been attracted to the characters purity. 

 ?God doesn?t give a person a job 

 he can?t do,? says Kilmer, ?and its just so extraordinary 

 to consider that the absolute last person to do the job 

 is the absolute essential person to do the job.? I don?t 

 know if that?s a requirement, but it?s what happened in 

 Moses? life. 

 ?There?s an aspect of character, 

 his passion, that always meant a lot to me,? adds Kilmer. 

 ?Just because it?s very hopeful to consider that you could 

 lead a humble life and one eventually of greatness. Righteousness 

 is enough.? The Ten Commandments will mark Kilmer?s 

 first live stage experience in 10 years. The role is entirely 

 sung, but production officials say that Kilmer ? who played 

 Jim Morrison in The Doors and sang on the Prince 

 of Egypt soundtrack ? is vocally ready. The world will 

 soon know, since there will be a soundtrack.

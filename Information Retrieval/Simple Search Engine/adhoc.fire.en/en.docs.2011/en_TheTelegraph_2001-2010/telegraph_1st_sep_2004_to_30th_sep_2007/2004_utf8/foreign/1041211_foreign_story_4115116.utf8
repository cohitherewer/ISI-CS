 Wounded Iraqi?s killer pleads guilty

 Baghdad, Dec. 10 (Reuters): An American soldier pleaded guilty at a court martial in Baghdad today to the murder of a badly-wounded Iraqi, the US military said in a statement.

 ?Staff Sergeant Johnny M. Horne plead guilty to one specification of murder... as well as one specification of conspiracy to commit murder,? it said.

 ?The convictions stemmed from Sergeant Horne?s murder of a severely wounded Iraqi civilian in Baghdad?s Sadr City district on August 18.? US forces clashed repeatedly in August with militiamen loyal to Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. The sprawling Shia slum of Sadr City was a focal point of the uprising.

 Earlier this week, Captain Rogelio Maynulet was ordered to face a full court martial for the murder in May of a man wounded as troops pursued Sadr militiamen near Najaf. 

 His was the first case of murder to be investigated by the US military in Iraq, where many people accuse US troops of killing civilians through negligence or misunderstandings, notably while pursuing militants or manning checkpoints. 

 Maynulet says he carried out a ?mercy killing?.

 Hostages freed

 Kidnappers today released two truck drivers, Bangladeshi Abul Kashem, 44, and Sri Lankan Dinesh Rajaratnam, 37, after holding them hostage in Iraq for more than a month.

 Both were employed by a Kuwaiti trucking company.

 Methane on Mars brings alive possibility 

 of life

 KENNETH CHANG

 New York, Nov. 28: A third 

 team of scientists has now reported a seemingly simple discovery 

 on Mars: its atmosphere contains methane. 

 But that finding has potentially 

 profound implications, including the possibility of present-day 

 microbes living on Mars.

 Speaking this month at the American 

 Astronomical Society?s Division for Planetary Sciences meeting 

 in Louisville, Kentucky, Michael Mumma, a senior scientist 

 at Nasa?s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, 

 reported three years of observations had provided strong 

 evidence for methane.

 ?We are 99 per cent confident,? 

 Mumma said. ?It surprised all of us, actually. We really 

 are still scrambling to understand what it means.?

 Methane, the simplest of hydrocarbon 

 molecules with one carbon and four hydrogen atoms, is fragile 

 in air and easily broken apart when hit by ultraviolet light. 

 Calculations indicate that any 

 methane in the Martian air must have been put there within 

 the past 300 years. That then raises the question: What 

 is putting methane into the Martian air?

 There seem to be only two plausible 

 explanations. One is geothermal chemical reactions involving 

 water and heat like those that occur on Earth in the hot 

 springs of Yellowstone or at hydrothermal vents on the bottoms 

 of oceans.

 That would intrigue planetary 

 geologists. Although frozen water is known to exist, there 

 are no signs that any volcanism has occurred there for millions 

 of years. Also, an instrument aboard Nasa?s Mars Odyssey 

 looked for warm spots on Mars? surface and did not find 

 any.

 The other, more intriguing, is 

 life. On Earth, a class of bacteria known as methanogens 

 breathes out methane as a waste product. 

 The discovery, if confirmed, suggests 

 that perhaps Martian life arose on a presumably more hospitable 

 Mars billions of years ago and survives to this day underground, 

 beneath the cold, dry landscape.

 Vladimir Krasnopolsky of Catholic 

 University in Washington, the leader of one of the teams, 

 said he believed bacteria to be the ?most plausible source?.

 Others are more cautious. ?Three 

 difficult detections, or marginal detections, don?t equate 

 to one really strong one,? said Philip R. Christensen, a 

 professor of geological sciences at Arizona State University. 

 Krasnopolsky?s findings, relying 

 on observations from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope 

 in Hawaii, were first reported at a conference in Europe 

 this year and will be published in the journal Icarus.

 In January, scientists working 

 on the European Space Agency?s Mars Express mission also 

 reported the detection of the methane. A few months later, 

 that group, led by Vittorio Formisano of the Institute of 

 Physics and Interplanetary Science in Rome reported that 

 the methane appeared to be more plentiful in regions where 

 frozen water is known to exist underground.

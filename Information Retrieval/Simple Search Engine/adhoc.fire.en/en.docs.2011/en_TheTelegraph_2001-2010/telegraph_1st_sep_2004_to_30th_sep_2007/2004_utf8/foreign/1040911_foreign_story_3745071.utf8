 Naomi chat on drugs

 Naomi Campbell

 London, Sept. 10 (Reuters): 

 Naomi Campbell, who won a legal battle against a tabloid 

 newspaper over her right to privacy after revelations about 

 her drug addiction, is to talk about her drug battles on 

 a national TV chat show.

 In an interview with veteran British talkshow host Michael Parkinson to be screened on ITV1 tomorrow night, Campbell talks about her rehabilitation.

 The model, 34, said she took her first drugs 10 years ago. ?I did a drug, a speedy drug,? she added, according to a transcript of the show released today. Parkinson asks whether it was like cocaine.

 Campbell replies: ?Uh-huh? before adding: ?No one forced me to do it. I did it because I wanted to.?

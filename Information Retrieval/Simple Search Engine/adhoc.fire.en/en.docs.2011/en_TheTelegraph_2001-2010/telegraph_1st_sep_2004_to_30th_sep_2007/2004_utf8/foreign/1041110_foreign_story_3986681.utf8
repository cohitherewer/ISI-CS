 Rush to leave Bush-ed US

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Nov. 9: Americans are looking to emigrate in droves, following the election of George W Bush for a second term in the White House and the victory of neo-conservatives in several states as governors, senators and members of the House of Representatives.

 Since the election results became known last Wednesday, US citizens are at least looking at that possibility, if their hits on immigration websites of the governments of Canada, New Zealand and even Australia are any indication.

 The figure for people logging on to Canada?s immigration website ? www.cic.gc.ca ? from the US rose nearly six-fold the day Bush?s re-election was confirmed, according to officials in Ottawa.

 On an average, the site gets about 20,000 hits from the US daily. Last Wednesday, the figure rose to 115,016, then settled down about half that number, still a three-fold rise over the norm.

 It is not clear how many of these hitters are born or naturalised US citizens, but judging by follow up manual enquiries at immigration offices, there is a rising desire on the part of Americans to leave their country in the post-election political and social context.

 Hits at New Zealand?s main immigration site in Wellington from the US rose four-fold to 10,300 the day after the Republican victory. Officials said enquiries by telephone and e-mail swamped them. Usually, they get about eight queries in a day, but this number went up to 300. 

 The New Zealand Immigration Service (NZIS) has offices in the US, including one in Los Angeles and another in Portland, Oregon. Don Badman, NZIS official in Los Angeles, has been quoted as saying that hits on the Wellington site has since dropped to between 5,000 to 6,000 a day.

 According to Terry Murphy, NZIS official in Portland, the number of Americans in his jurisdiction wanting to move to New Zealand had risen by between 200 and 300 per cent since the Bush win.

 Such interest picked up two months before the election, he said. Both Oregon and California are liberal bastions, but NZIS officials in the US have had numerous enquiries even from ?red? Republican strongholds.

 The wave of immigration enquiries from the US has embarrassed the political leadership in New Zealand and Canada: both countries have had an uneasy relationship with Bush in his first term.

 ?We regard US migration as very desirable,? said Helen Clark, New Zealand?s Prime Minister, who was recently strip-searched on a visit to Los Angeles and dealt with by airport security in a way that would make the handling of defence minister George Fernandes by US security as red carpet treatment.

 New Zealand has a very good record in preserving the environment and it has strong anti-globalisation and anti-war movements.

 But interest among Americans in moving there may also be because of the roaring popularity of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and the Oscars it has won.Australia has been promoting itself here as a destination for immigrants and the effort may now be paying off. 

 Notwithstanding Australias alliance with the US ? including troop presence in Iraq ? many liberals appear to be considering Prime Minister John Howard preferable to Bush.

 Canada?s Prime Minister Paul Martin, who is trying to improve relations with Washington, was careful not to link politics and American interest in Canadian immigration. He said Canada welcomes immigrants as a rule.

 Canadian newspapers are having a whale of a time writing about this issue. One columnist wrote that while the American Right might be happy to say goodbye to a few ?lily-livered Lefties?, the surge in immigration enquiries has nothing to do with Bush. 

 ?It is just that there is a deep psychological urge in the American psyche to be ruled by a Queen again and that the recent experiment in Republican democracy is causing them to regret being so nasty to George III in 1776?, a reference to American independence from Great Britain.

 Another columnist had a warning for would-be immigrants from the US. ?As Canadians, you will have to learn to embrace and use all the products and culture of Americans, while bad-mouthing their way of life?.

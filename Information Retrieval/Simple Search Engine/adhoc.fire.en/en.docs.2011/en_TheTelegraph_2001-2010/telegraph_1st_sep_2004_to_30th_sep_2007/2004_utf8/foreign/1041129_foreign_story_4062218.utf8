 Lion for lunch

 Harare, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Villagers 

 took revenge on a lion that killed their livestock by barbecuing 

 and eating it, Zimbabwe?s state-owned Sunday Mail newspaper 

 said.

 ?It ate our animals, so it is only fair that we eat it too,? a villager said. The paper said some believed they would get lion-like bravery and strength from the meat. 

 The lion ? part of a pride that terrorised the village for more than six months ? was shot dead by park authorities. 

 Work more

 New York (Reuters): Highly challenging 

 jobs with opportunities for responsibility may be good for 

 your resume and your health. A new study suggests people 

 with these types of jobs may be less likely to be diagnosed 

 with Alzheimer?s or other types of dementia. 

 Challenging work with high control possibilities and high social demands might prevent the development of dementia, study author Dr. Andreas Seidler, of Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany told Reuters Health.

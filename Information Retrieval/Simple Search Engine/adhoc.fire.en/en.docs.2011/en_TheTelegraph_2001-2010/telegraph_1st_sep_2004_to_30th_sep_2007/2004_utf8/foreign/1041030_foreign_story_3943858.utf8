 US on Pak blast

 Washington, Oct. 29 (Reuters): 

 The US state department said today it believed a blast at 

 an Islamabad hotel was probably caused by a bomb, differing 

 from the Pakistani view that it appeared to be the result 

 of an electrical fault.

 ?Our information, and the information we shared with the American community, was that it was probably an improvised explosive device ? a bomb of some kind,? state department spokesman Richard Boucher said. But he stressed that the explosion at the Marriott Hotel in the central area of the Pakistani capital on yesterday was under investigation by the Pakistani government and he said the US and Pakistani theories on what happened were preliminary.

 The blast injured five people, including one US official attached to the US embassy, and blew glass and other debris out the front of the hotel and through its lobby.

 Yesterday, interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said it appeared to have been caused by an electrical fault. ?There is nothing to worry about. It is apparently a case of a short circuit. We are investigating,? Sherpao said. 

 ?There is no evidence of any terrorist activity or any (bomb) blast.?

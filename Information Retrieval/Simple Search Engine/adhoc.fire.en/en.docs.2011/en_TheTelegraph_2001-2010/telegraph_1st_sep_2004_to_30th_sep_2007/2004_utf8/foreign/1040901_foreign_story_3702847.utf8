 Star wattage to burn Venice

 Meryl Streep (Top) and 

 Tom Hanks: Venetian summer 

 Venice, Aug. 31 (Reuters): 

 Hollywood has packed its bags and headed for the Venice 

 Film Festival, where a whopping 20 American films will be 

 screened and dozens of the hottest stars are set to inject 

 glamour into the arthouse competition.

 The festival starts tomorrow and ends on September 11 a date that is also the theme of several of the films and film critics say the star-packed 61st edition of the worlds oldest cinema competition marks the real start of the Oscar campaign.

 Every day will have at least a couple of glamour moments, Marco Muller, the festivals new director, said recently. I want this to be an audiences festival, with cheering as though it were a stadium.

 Hot topics will compete for attention with hot stars. Films about September 11 include Wim Wenders Land of Plenty, a critical look at post-September 11 America, and The Hamburg Cell, a movie about the 9/11 hijackers.

 Hollywood royalty Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks will kick off the festival with The Terminal, a romantic comedy about a traveller stranded by political upheaval in his own country for nine months in a New York airport.

 Paparazzi will be kept busy as Nicole Kidman, Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Reese Witherspoon, Al Pacino, Denzel Washington and Scarlett Johansson hit the red carpet in the lagoon city.

 Spielberg will be back with De Niro for the world premiere of Shark Tale, an animated film about a shark gangster showing out of competition in Venices stunning St Marks Square.

 We live in a time when we should remember to smile, Spielberg wrote in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera before the festival. Hollywood films can still give us this relief in a time of painful experiences.

 Arthouse fans and film critics are not likely to be disappointed either, with a total of 170 films and shorts from 28 countries showing in competitions and special events.

 Twenty-one films will vie for the coveted Golden Lion prize in the main competition, including Birth by Jonathan Glazer, starring Kidman as a woman convinced that a 10-year-old boy is her dead husbands reincarnation. 

 Festival favourites like Mike Leigh and Amos Gitai will also show their new films. Leigh will tackle the issue of abortion in 1950s Britain in Vera Drake while Gitai takes a tough look at prostitution in Promised Land.

 Fans are also awaiting the new animated feature Howls Moving Castle by the critically acclaimed Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, whose Spirited Away won an Oscar in 2003. Despite the star wattage, this festival could end up being remembered for its moments of strife.

 Angry gondoliers are planning to block Venices Grand Canal on Sunday to protest against motor boats and water traffic, which upsets their fragile vessels and almost led to the death of an infant.

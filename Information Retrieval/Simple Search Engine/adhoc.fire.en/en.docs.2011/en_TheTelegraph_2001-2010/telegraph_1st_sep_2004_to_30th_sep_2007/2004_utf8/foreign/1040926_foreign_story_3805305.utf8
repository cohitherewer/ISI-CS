 45-yr Bardot passion ends

 COLIN RANDALL

 Brigitte Bardot: Schoolboy crush

Paris, Sept. 25: Brigitte Bardot was in her 

mid-20s, universally regarded as one of the most beautiful women of her age. Cees 

Storm was a Dutch schoolboy whose previous passion had been collecting football 

pictures. The relationship has lasted 45 years without the couple ever managing 

to meet.

 But on Tuesday, Bardot?s 70th birthday, Storm will bring it to an end when he auctions his extensive archive devoted to the former actress? life and career.

 At the Drouot salerooms in Bardot?s native Paris yesterday, he began supervising the assembly of a display of 360 lots, representing more than 8,500 items, which are expected to fetch anything from ?30,000 to more than ?100,000. Storm, now a respectable 61-year-old lawyer from the Hague, was accompanied by a very understanding wife, Anna, who has indulged her husband?s fascination for another woman to the extent of allowing two rooms of their home to be used to store the collection.

 Magazines, film posters, records, books, giant framed stills and sets of postcards ? most in perfect condition ? form the bulk of the items amassed by Storm since he was 16. He made a habit of buying the same material twice if he found an example in better condition. Alain Weill, the art expert who has arranged the sale, said: ?There isn?t any original art here but it is a truly remarkable collection.?

 He believes the most extraordinary lot is a 20-volume set of scrapbooks extending to 4,500 pages and containing 7,000 pictures. This could attract bids of at least ?1,500, he said. Weill had made the reasonable assumption that Storm fell ?madly in love? with Bardot as a boy and began keeping the odd photograph or magazine before his youthful admiration turned into an lifetime obsession. Not so, said the Dutchman.

 ?That was never in my thinking,? he said. ?I was not in love with her but interested in her image. I thought she had wonderful...? ?Breasts?? his wife suggested helpfully. ?Charisma,? Storm insisted.

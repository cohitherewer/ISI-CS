 Screws on wine cork

 London, Nov. 20: Drinkers may finally have overcome their prejudice and accepted screw tops on their wine bottles.

 Over the past year the number of people who say they do not like screw-capped wine has fallen from 59 to 36 per cent. And although cork is still the favourite way of sealing bottles, plastic stoppers are growing in popularity. A year ago 17 per cent of people liked them ? now the figure is almost a third.

 Wine industry analysts say that increasing numbers of drinkers prefer the convenience of the synthetic materials or believe that they leave wine less liable to being tainted by cork.

 Richard Halstead, of Wine Intelligence, which carried out the study, said: ?We are not about to see the death of the ritual of uncorking a bottle of wine, but there?s no doubt that screw caps have established critical mass.?

 Supporters of natural cork say that plastic and metal stoppers have never been tried on quality wines that need decades to mature. They believe that air ? either trapped in the cork or passing through fine holes in it ? helps to improve the wine.

 But last month the magazine Wine International asked 50 tasters to sample 40 wines sealed variously with cork, screw cap, crown cap and a plastic cork. The panel preferred the screw cap samples for 21 out of the 40. Natural cork came top only once.

 The new study, based on an online poll of 1,018 wine drinkers, found that cork was still clear favourite. 

 But 18 per cent said they actively liked screw cap wine, compared to 7 per cent a year ago.

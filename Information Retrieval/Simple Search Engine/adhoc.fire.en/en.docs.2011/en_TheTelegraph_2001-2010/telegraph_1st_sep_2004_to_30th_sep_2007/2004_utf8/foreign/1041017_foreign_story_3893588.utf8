 De Niro snub sparks fury in Italy

 Robert De Niro

 Rome, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Hollywood heavyweight Robert De Niro snubbed the country of his forebears twice in as many days, refusing a top honour from fashion capital Milan on Thursday and then standing up dignitaries in Rome yesterday.

 The two-time Oscar winner flew into Italy for both events, having whipped up a political storm over his portrayal of gangsters of Italian descent, most recently as the voice of the ?Godfather? shark in the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale.

 Milan?s mayor had intended to give De Niro The Golden Ambrosius award, the northern city?s highest honour, to show support for the actor many Italians consider one of their own. But De Niro refused it, provoking fury among officials and the Italian press.

 He then failed to turn up at a news conference in Rome about the inclusion of an Italian showcase at New York Tribeca Film Festival he co-founded.

 Apocalypse phrase ban on UK firm

 Robert Duvall

 London, Nov. 24 (Reuters): 

 A British company was banned today from using the phrase 

 ?napalm never smelt this good? in promotional material for 

 a Vietnam war computer game.

 The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints by members of the public that the phrase promoting the game Vietcong Purple Haze was offensive ?particularly because napalm had killed civilians?.

 The ruling came only days after Scottish firm Traffic Games came under attack from members of the family of slain US President John F. Kennedy after the launch of JFK Reloaded, a video game which allows players to simulate the 1963 Dallas assassination.

 The Vietnam game is made by Take Two Interactive Software, which said the napalm phrase ? a reference to the film Apocalypse Now ? had been used on its posters as part of a series of extracts from reviews of the game.

 Actor Robert Duvall?s line in the film: ?I love the smell of napalm in the morning?, is one of the best known of all Vietnam war films.

 Napalm, a flammable jelly, caused severe burns when it came into contact with the skin. 

 A photograph of a naked Vietnamese girl, Kim Phuc Phan Thi, screaming as she fled down a road from a napalm attack, became one of the Vietnam war?s most enduring images.

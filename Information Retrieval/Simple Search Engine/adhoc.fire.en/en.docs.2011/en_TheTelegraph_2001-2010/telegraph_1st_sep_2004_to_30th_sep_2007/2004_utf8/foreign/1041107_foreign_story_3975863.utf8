 Mary Poppins is back

 HUGH DAVIES

 London, Nov. 6: The nanny is back. Forty years after Julie Andrews, umbrella in hand, primly flew over the rooftops of London into millions of hearts as Mary Poppins, the show is about to be revived. 

 Thanks to the persistence of the impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh, the nanny makes her stage debut at The Prince Edward, on December 15. ?I?d seen the film when it was just out,? he said in Bristol, where the production is being prepared at The Hippodrome. ?I?d just left school in Bath, and it opened before Christmas. Mary was so extraordinary I could never forget her, or the magical Sherman brothers? songs.

 ?I first asked for the rights 25 years ago ? and eventually secured them in 1993.? 

 Sir Cameron clinched the deal in a series of afternoon teas with the nanny?s creator, the formidable Pamela Travers, at her home in Shawfield Street, Chelsea, shortly before her death at 96. Diana Rawstron, one of the three trustees of her estate, who has seen the show, said: ?She chose Cameron because she liked him. She was confident that he would create something marvellous. We?re thrilled, and I think Pamela would have loved it.?

 Charming, amusing and eccentric, Travers, who never married, was always a handful for her publishers. She drank Jack Daniels and liked to swathe herself in turquoise robes and beads and converse with punk rockers on the King?s Road. Sir Cameron, 58, worth ?335 million, is financing the show, said to be costing more than ?8 million, along with Walt Disney, which owns the song rights. Thomas Schumacher, the Disney studio?s theatrical production chief is aboard, having made his name by creating The Lion King with Sir Elton John.

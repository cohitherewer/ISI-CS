 Maoists storm Nepal town

 Kathmandu, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Hundreds of Maoist rebels stormed a remote town in Nepal and set government buildings on fire, an army officer said today, in the first major attack after a short truce ended four days ago.

 The rebels, fighting since 1996 to topple the Himalayan nation?s constitutional monarchy, attacked Gamgadi, capital of the remote Mugu district, late yesterday and fought pitched battles with government troops.

 ?They set several empty government buildings on fire and fled to nearby jungles,? said the army officer, who did not want to be identified. 

 The army sustained no casualties but soldiers recovered the body of a rebel killed in the fighting, an army statement said. Rebels have not commented so far. In a separate incident, soldiers shot dead five Maoist guerrillas. 

 Gamgadi, about 600 km northwest of the capital, Kathmandu, is surrounded by mountains with no proper road and with poor communication links. Mugu district is a stronghold of the Maoists, who are fighting to convert Nepal into a single-party communist republic. 

 The attack comes after a nine-day truce between the rebels and the government for the Hindu festival of Dasain that ended on Thursday.

 Violence in Nepal, one of the world?s 10 poorest nations, has surged since rebels walked out of peace talks last year.

 The insurgency has claimed more than 10,000 lives since 1996, wrecked the impoverished economy and scared away tourists, who used to flock to the world?s only Hindu kingdom known for its soaring mountains.

 Aziz visit

 Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, on a two-day official visit to Nepal, will hold talks with his Nepalese counterpart Sher Bahadur Deuba on bilateral issues and south Asian regional cooperation, officials said today.

 Aziz arrived here today by a special flight as chairperson of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.

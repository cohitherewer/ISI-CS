 Traffic trouble? Build world?s highest bridge

 Millau (France), Dec. 14 (Reuters): President Jacques Chirac inaugurated the world?s highest bridge today, a creation taller than the Eiffel Tower, longer than the Champs Elysees and designed to end a traffic bottleneck in southern France.

 Conceived by British architect Norman Foster, the slender white viaduct in the picturesque Tarn Valley will provide a new motorway link between Paris and the Spanish border, easing congestion in the Rhone valley during the busy summer months.

 Chirac unveiled a simple commemorative plaque before plunging into a throng of white helmeted construction workers, as an air display team flew past the bridge trailing red, white and blue smoke ? the colours of the national flag. The French leader hailed the viaduct as a ?marvel of art and architecture?, a monument to French engineering genius that was a ?miracle of equilibrium?.

 ?The French people are rightly proud of the exploit carried out here...which speaks for France,? Chirac told a reception, saying the structure gave France a bold, successful and modern image.

 The highest of the bridge?s seven concrete pillars stands at 1,125 feet, 62 feet higher than the Eiffel Tower. At almost 2.5 km, it is longer than the Champs Elysees and slightly curved to afford drivers a dramatic view of the surrounding countryside and the ancient town of Millau with its medieval bell tower.

 ?The whole thing looks impossibly delicate,? Foster said in a telephone interview of what he called his ?sculpture in the landscape?, a 394-million-euro ($523-million) project financed by construction firm Eiffage. 

 ?It is a dialogue between nature and the man-made,? he said.

 The engineering feat has drawn rapturous praise for its elegant lines, which allow it to blend seamlessly into the surrounding region famed for its gorges, medieval villages and Roquefort cheese.

 ?We were attracted by the elegance and logic of a structure that would march across the heroic landscape and in the most minimal way connect one plateau to the other,? said Foster, who designed the German parliament?s Reichstag building in Berlin.

 The Millau viaduct has drawn thousands of visitors since construction was started exactly three years ago. The bridge will open to traffic at midnight on Friday and is expected to channel an average of 10,000 vehicles per day.

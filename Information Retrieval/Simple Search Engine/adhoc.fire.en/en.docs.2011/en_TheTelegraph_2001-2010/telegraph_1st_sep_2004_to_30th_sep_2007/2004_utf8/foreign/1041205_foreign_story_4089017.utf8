 Police raid Jackson ranch

 Los Angeles, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Police armed with a search warrant raided Michael Jackson?s Neverland Valley Ranch yesterday, looking for evidence in the child molestation case against him, a Santa Barbara county police spokesman said.

 Investigators served the search warrant on Neverland at 1700 GMT ?as part of an ongoing criminal investigation,? the police spokesman Sergeant Chris Pappas said. He did not elaborate.

 A spokeswoman for Santa Barbara county district attorney Tom Sneddon said only that the raid was ?authorised by the court.? Jackson is scheduled to stand trial in January on charges that he molested a young boy at Neverland and conspired to cover up his misdeeds.

 The 46-year-old pop star?s lead attorney, Thomas Mesereau, and a spokeswoman declined to comment when reached by Reuters. It was not clear whether the police raid would delay Jackson?s trial, which is scheduled to begin on January 31.

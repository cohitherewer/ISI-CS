 Chip to keep tabs on Viagra

 Washington, Nov. 15 (Reuters): 

 Viagra, the blockbuster impotence pill that is copied and 

 counterfeited around the world, is one of the first drugs 

 to get a little radio chip tracking device under a new Food 

 and Drug Administration initiative announced today.

 The FDA has been working with industry for more than a year to try to come up with ways to better protect drugs and foil counterfeiters.

 Pfizer, which makes Viagra, said it would be among the first to use the technology to protect its high-profile product. The tiny chips, called radio frequency identification or RFID tags, can be attached to packaging to track products from the factory to the pharmacy and can be used to check their authenticity.

 The technology is already being tested by retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to track goods and signal when re-stocking is needed with scanners in stores.

 Britain?s Marks amp; Spencer Plc, Germany?s Metro AG and fellow US discount store Target Corp. are also testing the concept.

 ?The project supports FDA efforts to promote the development of standards and processes in preparation for RFID?s broader use across the pharmaceutical industry,? Pfizer said.

 The FDA says fewer than one per cent of prescription medicines sold in the US are fake. But the agency says counterfeit drugs are a top concern because the number of cases appears to have grown in recent years. Pfizer said has also said it was introducing new packaging designed to make the Viagra label harder for criminals to copy.

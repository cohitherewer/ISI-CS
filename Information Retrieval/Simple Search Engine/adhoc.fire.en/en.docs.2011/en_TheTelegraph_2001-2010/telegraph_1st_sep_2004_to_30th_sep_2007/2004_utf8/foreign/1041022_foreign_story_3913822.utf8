 Beijing, Oct. 21 (Reuters): 

 A gas explosion in a crowded coal mine in China killed at 

 least 60 people and left 88 missing with little hope of 

 surviving the country?s most serious mine accident in years.

 In another accident, six miners were killed in a gas leak in a grim reminder that the world?s biggest mining industry is also the most dangerous, with thousands of people killed in explosions, floods and other mishaps every year.

 The explosion occurred last night at the Daping mine in Xinmi in central Henan province after a rapid build-up of gas, when 446 miners were on duty underground, the official Xinhua news agency said. It said 298 miners escaped. 

 ?This accident is the most serious in recent years,? deputy director of the state administration of work safety, Sun Huashan, said today.

 State television said 60 people had been confirmed dead after the blast in a shaft 200-300 metres underground. The bodies of victims lay covered with green canvas at the mine?s offices, Xinhua said.

 Japan typhoon

 Japans deadliest typhoon in more than two decades killed at least 62 people, media said today as rescuers searched frantically for 27 still missing in floods and landslides.

 Many people died in landslides set off by the heavy rains from Typhoon Tokage.

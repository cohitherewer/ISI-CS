 Fine Print

 Slippery strut

 Sydney, Sept. 3 (AP): Hundreds of people turned out to see Miss Universe strut her stuff on the catwalk. They were not expecting to see this much of her.

 Australian rugby league cheerleader Jennifer Hawkins, who was crowned Miss Universe earlier this year, was at a Sydney fashion show yesterday when a skirt she was wearing unravelled from around her waist and slipped to the floor. As spectators gasped, 20-year-old Hawkins giggled and rushed backstage.

 I was walking along in a bora dress and the bottom just came off, she said later in a television interview. It was just a pity I wasnt wearing better panties.

 The incident won Hawkins praise for poise in adversity from Sydney tabloid The Daily Telegraph. Hawkins scored a 10 out of 10 for courage under fire, simply laughing the incident off, the paper said on its social pages. 

 Cruise call

 London (Reuters): Hollywood movie star 

 Tom Cruise wowed fans in central London on Thursday with 

 a lengthy walkabout before the British premiere of his latest 

 film, Collateral. The actor spent more than two hours 

 with crowds gathered outside the cinema in Leicester Square, 

 chatting, posing for photos and talking to relatives of 

 fans over their mobile phones. The film, which has earned 

 $80 million in North America, is Cruises first outing as 

 a screen villain. 

 Water war

 Amsterdam (Reuters): A hot summer in the Netherlands has accomplished what a war, eight centuries and two royal interventions could not two districts have settled a feud over excess water and a bridge. The feud between two water boards in Utrecht and South Holland provinces started in 1162 when Count Floris III of Holland built a dam on the Oude Rijn river, preventing the Diocese of Utrecht from getting rid of excess water. The bishop of Utrecht sent in his armies and after much bloodshed German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa was called in to settle the dispute, ruling it was illegal to create environmental difficulties for neighbours.

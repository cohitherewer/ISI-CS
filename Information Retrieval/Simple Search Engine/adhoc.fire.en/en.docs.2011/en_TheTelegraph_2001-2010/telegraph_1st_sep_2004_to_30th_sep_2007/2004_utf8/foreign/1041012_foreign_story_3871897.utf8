 Pak tank ready for Saudi tests

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Oct. 11: Pakistan will hand over its state-of-the-art Al-Khalid main battle tanks to Saudi Arabia next year for further trials, paving the way for a possible deal between the two countries.

 Saudi officials had carried out tests on the Al-Khalid tanks last year, Pakistani defence official Major General Ali Baz said during official talks in Rawalpindi.

 Defence minister Rao Sikandar Iqbal and Saudi assistant minister of defence for military affairs Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz led their respective delegations at the talks. Al-Khalid can be compared with any tank in its class. It has an excellent power-to- weight ratio,enhanced firepower, high mobility, all weather capability and 125-mm smooth bore gun, Major General Baz said.

 The two sides also discussed possible joint ventures in the production of arms and armoured vehicles,? an official statement said.

 On debate-eve, stakes are high

 Tempe, Arizona, Oct. 13 (Reuters): President George W. Bush and Democratic Senator John Kerry meet in a final debate that could give one of the White House rivals a critical boost heading into the last three weeks of the race.

 The stakes are high for both candidates, with polls showing the President and the Massachusetts senator in a dead heat heading into the showdown on domestic issues like taxes, jobs and health care.

 The televised encounter at Arizona State University is the last set campaign event before the three-week dash to the November 2 election, and gives Bush and Kerry a final chance to make their case before an audience of millions of likely voters.

 Bush arrived in Arizona last night for a campaign event with supporters and a dinner with Senator John McCain, his bitter foe in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries but now an ally on the campaign trail.

 ?What I?m going to tell the people tomorrow night is we?re not going to go back to the days of tax and spend,? Bush told supporters in Arizona, criticising Kerry as a big-spending liberal whose health care plan would amount to a government takeover.

 Kerry stayed in New Mexico to watch the Boston Red Sox lose to the New York Yankees in the first game of the American League baseball playoffs.

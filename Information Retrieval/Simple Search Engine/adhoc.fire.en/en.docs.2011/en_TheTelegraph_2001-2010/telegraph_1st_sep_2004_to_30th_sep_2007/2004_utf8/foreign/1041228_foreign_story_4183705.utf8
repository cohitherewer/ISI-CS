 Dreaded 10,000 on Jakarta lips

 Banda Aceh (Indonesia), Dec. 27 (Reuters): Indonesian vice-president Jusuf Kalla said today the death toll from a tsunami that swept across the Indian Ocean region could hit 10,000 in one area of his country alone.

 That would more than double the death count for all Indonesia of 4,912 given earlier by a government minister.

 Kalla?s comments came after a visit to this provincial capital where, during the day, rescue workers pulled hundreds of bodies from treetops, rivers and wrecked homes, trying to clean up before disease could spread.

 Speaking in the northern Sumatran city of Medan, Kalla said: ?In Banda Aceh, the deaths (could be) between 5,000 to 10,000?.

 It was unclear whether Kalla, who said he had attended a mass burial of 1,500 bodies in the afternoon, was referring only to Banda Aceh proper or the surrounding area. The health ministry had earlier estimated deaths in Banda Aceh at 3,000.

 More than 24 hours after waves crushed houses and swept through downtown streets of the sprawling, low-lying city, troops were still unloading piles of bodies from military trucks as weeping and dazed survivors tried to identify victims. At a market on Banda Aceh?s outskirts, hundreds of swollen bodies were covered with bright orange plastic sheets.

 ?I?m tired. I?m looking for my father. Please help me,? wailed Maimori, 22. She said her father was a fish seller and last spoke to her yesterday before going to the market.

 As night fell, dozens of bodies were still scattered on streets and masses of debris ? mud, ruined trucks and cars, mangled motorcycles and wood from shattered houses ? deposited when the tsunami swept as far as 8 km inland had yet to be cleared.

 Banda Aceh was virtually blacked out after dusk, with power supply cut. Few people ventured onto the streets, and a stench of death hung over the city. Some activity could be seen at the main mosque, where Acehnese from outside town came to ask residents about missing relatives. Many people remained unaccounted for.

 ?I was outside my house, people were screaming ?big waves, big waves?,? said Nazarudin, 40, lying on the floor of a hospital hall, his foot mangled and his face cut. ?I managed to hold onto a tree. But my wife is gone. She is missing?

 The wall of water up to 10 metres high that followed a massive earthquake off the Indonesian coast killed more than 22,000 people across Asia.

 Many in Aceh drowned in waters churning with huge rocks, logs and the remnants of homes uprooted by the waves that slammed into the northern tip of Sumatra island yesterday. A wooden ship over 50 metres long sat on a street near the seafront where the raging waters had left it.

 The UN said it had offered to send disaster response teams into restive Aceh, currently off-limits to foreign aid workers because of a long-running insurgency..

 Thousands huddled in mosques, tents and larger buildings after the quake. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono arrived in the Aceh town of Lhokseumawe late today. Indonesian media said he prayed with refugees and told them they would get help soon.

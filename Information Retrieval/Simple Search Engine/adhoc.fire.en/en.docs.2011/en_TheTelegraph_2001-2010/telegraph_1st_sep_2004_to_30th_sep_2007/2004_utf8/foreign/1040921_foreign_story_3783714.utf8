 Indonesia polls

 Jakarta, Sept. 20 (Reuters): An urbane former general who promises to fight terror and clean up government headed for overwhelming victory against incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in Indonesia?s first direct presidential election today.

 Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Megawati?s one-time chief security minister, had 59 per cent of ballots with a fifth of the vote counted, the election commission said. Megawati had 41 per cent. 

 A coalition of independent survey groups projected Yudhoyono would win 61.2 per cent, with Megawati getting 38.8 per cent according to a sample taken from across the world?s most populous Muslim nation. Some 151 million people were eligible to vote and turnout was estimated at 80 per cent.

 Showing the caution that has led many analysts to predict he lacks the boldness to tackle Indonesia?s chronic problems, Yudhoyono refused to get carried away by the projections. But he sought to reach out to Megawati, who in public has refused to shake his hand since he quit her cabinet in March after a bitter row over his presidential ambitions.

 Karzai?s friend killed in Pak tribal region

 Hamid Karzai

 Wana (Pakistan), Dec. 29 (Reuters): Masked gunmen killed an ethnic Pashtun politician known as a close friend of Afghan President Hamid Karzai in a Pakistani tribal region near the Afghan border today, officials said.

 Shah Alam Khan was travelling in a vehicle when two armed men riding in another car opened fire and seriously wounded him in Wana, the main town of Pakistan?s South Waziristan tribal region. ?He succumbed to his injuries on his way to hospital,? a local government official said.

 Khan, a local leader of the Pashtun-nationalist Pukhtunkhuwa Milli Awami Party, was considered a close friend of Karzai and met him several times in visits to Afghanistan.

 South Waziristan, about 400 km southwest of Islamabad, has long been a hideout for al Qaida-linked militants and officials said they were investigating whether they were involved in the killing.

 Hundreds of people have been killed in South Waziristan in the past year in battles between the security forces and Islamic militants.

 A cargo ship today brought home 758 Pakistanis who were deported by Oman for allegedly entering the country illegally and working without permission, an official said. The ship arrived at Karachi after setting sail two days ago from Muscat, Oman.

 Vatican restates war stance 

 Vatican City, Oct. 25 (Reuters): A major Vatican document issued a week ahead of the US elections forcefully restated today the Catholic Church?s position that preventive wars are permissible only with ?clear proof? of an imminent attack.

 The position on war and peace, on legitimate defence and aggression was found in the new Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, a 330-page tome published by the Vatican.

 While the book is mainly a compilation of known Church teachings on a host of social issues, its chapter called: ?The Promotion of Peace,? is one of the most topical.

 It made no specific reference to Iraq, but defended the Charter of the UN, which prohibits a recourse to conflict to resolve disputes except in cases of legitimate defence and when backed by the Security Council. The Vatican strongly opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq.

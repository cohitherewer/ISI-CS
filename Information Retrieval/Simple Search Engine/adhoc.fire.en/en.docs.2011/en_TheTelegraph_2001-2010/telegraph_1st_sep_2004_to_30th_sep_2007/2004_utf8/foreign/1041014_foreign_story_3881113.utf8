 Jackson just loses it over Eminem?s new video

 Los Angeles, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Pop star Michael Jackson, angry over a ?demeaning and insensitive? new Eminem music video that makes light of the child molestation charges against him, today asked that networks pull it off the air.

 Eminem?s Just Lose It video shows the rapper, dressed as Jackson, sitting on the edge of a bed as young boys bounce behind him. 

 At another point his nose falls off, a reference to rumours that Jackson has had extensive plastic surgery.

 The video has already been pulled off the BET cable television network at the request of the self-proclaimed ?King of Pop,? who became one of the best-selling recording artists of all time in part thanks to his elaborate and pioneering music videos.

 ?I?m very angry at Eminem?s depiction of me in this video. I feel that it is outrageous and disrespectful. It is one thing to spoof but it is another to be demeaning and insensitive,? Jackson said in a radio interview in Los Angeles, according to a transcript provided by his spokeswoman.

 ?I?ve admired Eminem as (an) artist and was shocked by this. The video was inappropriate and disrespectful to me, my children, my family and the community at large,? he said. ?It is my hope that the other networks will take BET?s lead and pull it.?

 A publicist for Eminem released a brief statement saying: ?We are sorry? BET chose to take the video off the air. He declined further comment.

 Jackson, 46, faces trial in January on a 10-count indictment that charges him with child molestation and conspiracy. He has pleaded not guilty.

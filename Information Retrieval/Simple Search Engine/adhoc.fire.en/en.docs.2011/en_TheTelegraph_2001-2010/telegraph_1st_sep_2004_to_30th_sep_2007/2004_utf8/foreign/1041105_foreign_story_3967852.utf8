 Father of Pak N-bomb ill

 Islamabad, Nov. 4 (Reuters): Supporters of disgraced Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan say his health is deteriorating and have demanded he be produced in court to determine his condition.

 Khan, once revered as the father of Pakistan?s nuclear bomb, has been under house arrest in Islamabad since he was identified at the centre of a proliferation scandal involving transfers of weapons technology to Libya, Iran and North Korea.

 A group campaigning for his release filed a petition in the Supreme Court yesterday demanding Khan be produced in court to determine his state of health.

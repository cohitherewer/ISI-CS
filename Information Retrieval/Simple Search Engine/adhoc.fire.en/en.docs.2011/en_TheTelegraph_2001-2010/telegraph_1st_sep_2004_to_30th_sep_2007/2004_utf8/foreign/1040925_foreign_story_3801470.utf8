 Pak reshuffle

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 24: President 

 Pervez Musharraf plans to reshuffle top command and staff 

 positions in the army after the retirement of vice-chief 

 of army staff General Mohammad Yusuf and chairman of the 

 joint chiefs-of-staff committee General Mohammad Aziz Khan 

 on October 6.

 While Musharraf, who is also the chief of army staff, has not revealed the names of the officers who will receive promotions and new postings, rumours have started in civilian and military circles about the possible shake-up.

 At least one principal staff officer, out of almost a dozen in the general headquarters, will be promoted to the rank of a four-star general.

 There is little chance for a senior army official to be appointed as the chairman of the joint chiefs-of-staff committee as this time the President is likely to pick an officer either from the navy or the air force for the post. The army has occupied the chairman?s post for over six years.

 Before Aziz?s appointment, Musharraf had the additional charge of the joint chiefs-of-staff committee which he retained for three years. Observers feel Musharraf may stay as army chief for another three years and may announce his decision in the next couple of months after the appointment of the new vice-chief of army staff.

 Though political pundits predict strong resistance by opposition parties if Musharraf reneges the promise, he made last year to shed military uniform by December

 31, leaders of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Q) say they can bring legislation in the parliament to enable him to continue as the army chief.

 This will be Musharraf?s third extension since 1998 when he was appointed army chief. He had earlier extended his tenure for another three years in September

 2001, almost two years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup.

 Musharraf is likely to announce new promotions and postings as he comes back home from official tour to the United States, Holland and Italy early next month.

 With the retirement of Yusuf and Aziz, General Musharraf will no longer have all those trusted aides around him, who helped him rise to the current position. 

 Also among those close confidants were former deputy chief of army staff general Muzaffar Usmani and ex-ISI chief general Mehmud Ahmad, who had played an

 instrumental role in foiling what Musharraf alleged a plan to hijack his plane and dismiss him as army chief by former Nawaz Sharif government in October 1999.

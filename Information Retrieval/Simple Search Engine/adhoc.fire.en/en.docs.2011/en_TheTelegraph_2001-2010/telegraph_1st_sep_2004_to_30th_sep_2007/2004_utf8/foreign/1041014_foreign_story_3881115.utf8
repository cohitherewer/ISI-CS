 Sorry, Blair won?t say it

 London, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Tony Blair?s ministers have said it, his political opponents are baying for it but the British Prime Minister refuses to utter it.

 When it comes to the Iraq war, ?sorry? is the word on everyone else?s lips. Blair?s rivals harangued him again today for failing to say sorry over the justification he gave for the conflict.

 Before the March 2003 invasion, Blair said Iraq?s weapons of mass destruction were a threat to Britain but he has since admitted intelligence was ?wrong?.

 ?I take full responsibility and indeed apologise for any information given in good faith that has subsequently turned out to be wrong,? Blair told parliament today, repeating the partial apology he has already made and studiously avoiding the word ?sorry?.

 ?But I will not apologise for removing Saddam Hussein. I will not apologise for the conflict,? he added defiantly.

 Aides say Blair is steering clear of the word ?sorry? out of concern he will be interpreted as apologising for the war. Newspaper headlines of ?Blair says sorry for Iraq?, while satisfying some, could prove damaging for a Prime Minister whose public trust and popularity ratings have plunged over the war.

 As in the US, Iraq is set to be a key battleground in a British election expected next year. US President George W. Bush has refused to apologise for flawed intelligence on Iraq ? an issue that stormed back into the spotlight last week when the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) concluded that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. Blair?s foes said today the ISG report demolished his justification for the war but Blair argued Iraq?s flouting of UN resolutions was the legal basis for it. 

 Opposition parties plan to make the issue of trust a key plank of the election.

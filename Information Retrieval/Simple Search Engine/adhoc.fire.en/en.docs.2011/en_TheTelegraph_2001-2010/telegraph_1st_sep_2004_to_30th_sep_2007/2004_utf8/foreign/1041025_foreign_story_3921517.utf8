 Quake jolts Japan

 Ojiya, Japan, Oct. 24 (Reuters): Thousands of weary and frightened residents in northern Japan were spending a second night in shelters, cars or in the open today after Japan?s deadliest earthquake in nine years killed at least 21 people.

 More than 2,000 were injured when the 6.8 magnitude quake and a series of powerful aftershocks struck rural Niigata prefecture, about 250 km north of Tokyo, yesterday, setting off landslides, wrecking houses and buckling railway tracks.

 Several aftershocks struck the region today, raising concerns of more landslides in the largely mountainous region. 

 One slide devastated a village, killing at least two people and cutting off about 600 residents for more than 12 hours.

 The quake, coming days after a typhoon killed at least 80 people, is the deadliest in Japan since the Kobe earthquake killed more than 6,400 in 1995. In Tokyo, where the government set up a crisis centre, officials were trying to contact remote areas and arrange to transport food, water, blankets, heaters and other necessities.

 The quake and aftershocks shook buildings in Tokyo yesterday but there were no reports of injuries or major damage. Officials have estimated a quake of similar scale in the Tokyo area would kill about 7,000 people.

 As darkness fell, nearly 130,000 households in Niigata were without power and many also lacked water, gas or phone service. Some mobile phone services were not working while operators limited use on others to ensure emergency calls got through.

 ?Our life-line has been cut. There is no toilet, gas or electricity and it was cold last night,? Toshiro Hosoya, 57, a high school teacher in the town of Ojiya, said.

 ?I?m not terrified, but the aftershocks keep coming, so I have a strange feeling of unease.?

 People huddled around small bonfires as night fell and temperatures began to drop. The night before, temperatures fell to about 5 degrees Celsius. ?I?m wearing at least six layers of clothes,? one woman said. ?But it?s still safer than being inside.?

 ?We are gathering information but we can?t figure out details of the disaster damage as the roads are blocked in the mountain areas and phone lines are still suspended,? Kyodo news agency quoted Ojiya Mayor Hirokazu Seki as saying.

 Ojiya is a textile centre of 40,000 and fears emerged today that 30 residents who had evacuated downstream of a river blocked by a landslide might be swept away, Kyodo added.

 In the city of Nagaoka, the lopsided front carriage of a bullet train rested on the side of its track, the first derailment since the high-speed service began 40 years ago.

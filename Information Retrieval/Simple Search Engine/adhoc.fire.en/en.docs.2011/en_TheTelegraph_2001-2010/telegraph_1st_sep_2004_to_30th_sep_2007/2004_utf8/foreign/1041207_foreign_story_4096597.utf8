 Mittal rushes to Kazakh coal mine after blast

 AMIT ROY

 Lakshmi Mittal

 London, Dec. 6: Steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal arrived early today at a coal mine he owns near the northern city of Karaganda in Kazakhstan, where a powerful blast has killed 23 and injured two out of the 92 miners who were working there yesterday.

 The mine provides coking coal to the Karmet steel plant he bought in 1995, his office in London said.

 ?On hearing the news about the accident in Shakhtinskaya mine, the chairman of Mittal Steel Company Lakshmi N. Mittal has urgently rushed to the site from London along with company CEO Malay Mukherjee to take first hand stock of the situation,? his office said. Mittal, who was recently named the biggest steelmaker in the world, will want to reassure the industry that his company is not cutting corners in the drive for profits.

 His spokeswoman, Nicola Davidson, general manager, communications, Mittal Steel, said: ?Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who died yesterday morning. Mr Mittal and Mr Mukherjee have both now arrived in Kazakhstan and have spent the morning visiting the relatives of those who died in the accident. Mittal Steel regards the safety of its workers with the highest priority and we are committed to working with the government commission to discover the cause of the accident as soon as possible.?

 Mittal?s office was quick to rush out a statement after yesterday?s disaster. It said that ?on the 5th of December at 03.08 am there was an explosion in one of the faces of the Shakhtinskaya coal mine of JSC Ispat Karmet. Of the 92 people working in the mine at the time of the accident, 23 people have died, three have been injured and the rest have been rescued safely.?

 It added: ?Of the three injured, one has been discharged from the hospital and the other two are still being treated in the hospital and their condition is stable. The condition of the two hospitalised miners is stable and they are out of danger. The mine has been completely evacuated and all production operations have been stopped.? The bodies of the dead have been brought out of the mine.?

 The statement also said: ?The executive director of coal division Mr Prezent, governor of Karaganda region Mr Mukhamedzhanov and other chiefs of regional services reached the site of the accident immediately and have been personally supervising all the rescue operations. The regional group has been formed for handling the emergency situation and efficient settlement of the issues related to the accident in the mine.?

 The official statement went on: ?The work for handling the emergency situation is going on. The gas levels are being monitored in the mine. A special committee is also currently investigating the cause of the explosion. Till safe operating conditions are restored, the mine?s operations will remain disrupted. The President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev has sent his sincere condolences to the families of the miners who have died. The President has also given the instructions to extend all required help to the people who have suffered from this accident and families of the people who have died.?

 Mittal?s office said: ?The general director and CEO of Ispat Karmet N.K.Choudhary has sent his sincere condolences to the families of miners who have died. The senior management of Ispat Karmet is carefully and closely monitoring the situation. The minister of energy and mineral resources Mr Shkolnik will head the governmental committee for investigating the cause of the accident and is expected to arrive at the mine on the morning of December 6.?

 Mine blasts causing heavy casualties are not unusual apparently for post-Soviet Russia and Ukraine. But they are said to be rare in Kazakhstan.

 quot;This tragedy is completely untypical of Kazakhstan, quot; the emergency ministry spokesman said.

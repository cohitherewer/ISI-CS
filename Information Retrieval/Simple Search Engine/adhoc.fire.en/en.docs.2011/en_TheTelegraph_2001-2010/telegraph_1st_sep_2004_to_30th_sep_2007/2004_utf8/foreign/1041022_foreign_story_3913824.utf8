 Harry hurt in scuffle with lensmen

 Prince Harry

 London, Oct. 21(Reuters): 

 Britain?s royal ?wild child? Prince Harry scuffled with 

 photographers outside a London nightclub today in scenes 

 reminiscent of the media scrums that used to engulf his 

 late mother Princess Diana.

 Harry was hit on the nose and a photographer?s lip was cut in the early-morning fracas, according to royal aides, who have worked hard to clean up Harry?s fast-living image. Diana, who died in 1997, was regularly hounded by photographers and died in a Paris underpass after her chauffeur-driven car crashed as it sped away from motorbike-borne paparazzi.

 Today?s fracas broke out, the aides said, after Harry, the younger son of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and Diana, tried to push a camera away.

 Pictures aired on British television showed the 20-year-old, red-haired prince scuffling with a group of photographers after partying at Pangaea nightclub in Piccadilly, central London.

 In London?s Evening Standard newspaper, photographer Chris Uncle said Harry had been getting in his car when he ?deliberately lashed out?. ?Suddenly he burst out of the car and lunged towards me. He was saying: ?Why don?t you just leave me alone,?? Uncle said. 

 Another photographer supported Uncle?s version of events. ?He (Harry) just went for him for no apparent reason. He was at least a metre away from him,? Charlie Pyecraft told Sky TV.

 New York, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Former President Bill Clinton will have heart bypass surgery early next week after being rushed to a top New York hospital yesterday complaining of chest pains and shortness of breath.

 In a phone call from his hospital to CNN, Clinton, 58, said he felt great but an angiogram had found a significant blockage in a blood vessel. My blockage is so substantial, I think if I dont do this (surgery) I think theres virtually a 100 per cent chance that Ill have a heart attack, Clinton told Larry King Live.

 Some of this is genetic and I may have done some damage in those years when I was too careless about what I ate ... Ive got a problem and Ive got a chance to deal with it, Clinton said.

 Let me just say this, the Republicans are not the only people who want four more years here, he said, referring to the bid by his successor, President George W. Bush, to win re-election in November.

 Clinton said he had gone for the angiogram a blood vessel X-ray after feeling tightness in his chest.

 I think it (the angiogram) probably saved my life ... I guess Im a little scared, but not much, he said.

 His wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, said earlier after visiting him at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital that he would have surgery early next week.

 My husband is doing very well, hes in great humour, she said. Hes beating all of us at cards and the rest of the games were playing.

 The former President went to his local hospital on Thursday and had more tests yesterday. Im just going to have to be really careful, Ive put about 10 pounds of that weight I lost, back on during my book tour, Clinton told CNN. Ive got to take it off and just do everything I can to keep my cholesterol down, keep my blood pressure down.

 Still popular despite the sex scandals that dogged his presidency, Clinton, a former governor of Arkansas, has been active giving speeches and writing and promoting his best-selling memoir My Life since leaving office in 2001.

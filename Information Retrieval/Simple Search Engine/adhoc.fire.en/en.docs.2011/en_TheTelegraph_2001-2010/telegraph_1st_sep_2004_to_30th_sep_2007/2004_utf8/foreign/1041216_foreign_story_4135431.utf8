 Nannygate spills out of 9/11 cop?s dirty closet

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Bernard Kerik

 Washington, Dec. 15: The euphoria of election victory and anticipation of a spectacular January 20 inauguration of President George W. Bush have quickly given way here to ?nannygate?, the juicy scandal which has destroyed one of the President?s most high profile picks for his new cabinet.

 The skeletons that are tumbling out with the ferocity of a tornado from the cupboards of Bernard Kerik, New York?s police commissioner during the September 11 terrorist attacks, have also cast a long shadow over any 2008 presidential bid by another folk hero of September 11, the Big Apple?s then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.

 Giuliani, an icon for most Americans because of the way he handled fallout from the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, is under a cloud because Kerik was once the mayor?s driver: Giuliani catapulted him to be police chief.

 Miramax has all but dropped like a hot potato a film it has been making about Kerik?s life based on his best-selling autobiography, The Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice. Miramax had hired Rick Schwartz, executive producer of The Aviator, to produce the film.

 Kerik was recommended to Bush to be his next homeland security secretary by the former mayor and the President appears to have taken Giuliani at his word about Kerik?s past, which always comes under the scanner when nominees for the cabinet are exposed to Senate confirmation hearings.

 The latest scandal to erupt about Kerik will make New Yorkers gasp. The New York Times reported today that Kerik used an apartment near ?Ground Zero?, the site of the World Trade Center, for extra-marital trysts with Judith Regan, publisher of his autobiography.

 The apartment had originally been donated as a place of rest for police and rescue workers engaged in clearing up Ground Zero. Regan received an honourary New York police badge on Kerik?s last day as police commissioner.

 Regan broke up with Kerik, according reports in the New York media, after she discovered that Kerik had another mistress, a subordinate in the city?s law enforcement system. A lawsuit over the second mistress has come out in the open after Bush nominated Kerik to his cabinet.

 White House background checks have uncovered that Kerik was married to a woman in North Carolina. He kept this marriage secret for more than 20 years and his autobiography mentions only two other marriages.

 Adultery, however, is the least of Kerik?s image problems with the media tasting blood about his shady past. In the four days since Kerik withdrew from the new Bush team, newspapers and TV stations have uncovered alleged links between the former police chief and the mafia, bribery charges, allegations of abuse of authority, incompetence, shady business deals, conflicts of interest, one arrest warrant and civil lawsuits against him.

 The White House had hoped that the torrent would not open up after it cited his indiscretion in hiring an illegal immigrant as a nanny for his children as reason for withdrawing from a job where immigration control would have been one of his top priorities.

 Kerik?s ?nannygate? will be forgotten in a few weeks, but for most Americans, its long term impact will be on Giuliani?s political future. ?America?s mayor?, as he is known, was leading in opinion polls among the Republicans to succeed Bush in 2008, but his judgement in recommending Kerik to the President will be questioned in any such presidential bid.

 This is good news for conservative Republicans, who would have been loathe to accept a New York liberal and supporter of abortion as their candidate in 2008.

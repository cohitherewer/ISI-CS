 Aziz expands cabinet

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept 4: Two days after a 32-member federal cabinet was sworn in, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz today added another batch of ministers, inflating the size of his cabinet to 59.

 The majority of the new ministers include relatives of influential Pakistan families who support the army.

 Musharraf, who administered the oath of office to the junior ministers, has often called for grooming young MPs as future leaders.

 The new state ministers also include five women MPs, with two belonging to influential Punjab families. One of the, Sumaira Malik, is the granddaughter of a former West Pakistan governor Nawab Amir Khan Kalabagh and the niece of former President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari. 

 Critics have alleged that Aziz was not given a free hand in selecting his cabinet and pressure groups within the parliament blackmailed the government. Had Aziz been given a free hand, he would not have inducted those known for changing loyalties, Pakistan Peoples Party secretary-general Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said.

 Clash of visions in Afghan race

 Sinzari (Afghanistan), Oct. 6: More than 1,000 leathery, turbaned men gathered in a cavernous village mosque for a presidential campaign rally. 

 They no longer carried rifles, and some had even brought their small sons. But the assembly of mujaheddin, or former anti-Soviet fighters, crackled with esprit de corps.

 The veterans were all ethnic Pashtuns, and the rally was held in Kandahar province, the heartland of Afghan Pashtun culture and the birthplace of President Hamid Karzai, who comes from a prominent Pashtun tribe and has courted Pashtun votes in his bid to be elected president this Saturday.

 But these tough ex-fighters had come to show their support for someone else: Yonus Qanooni, the former interior and education minister and an ethnic Tajik, who is Karzai?s major challenger. To them, the candidate?s ethnicity mattered far less than his credentials as a fellow mujahid.

 ?We have all sacrificed a great deal, and we all lost brothers and fathers in the fight for our country,? said Asadullah, a farmer in the crowd. ?We want a leader who is a true mujahid, so our rights will be protected. We are all one tribe and one nation. We don?t like Karzai. We want Qanooni.?

 With Afghanistan?s first-ever presidential election just days away, analysts here predict that Karzai, 47, will garner the most votes. He remains by far the best known of the 18 candidates in the race, he is widely regarded as the American choice, and he has the power and perquisites of incumbency.

 But the unexpected inroads made by Qanooni make it increasingly likely that Karzai will not win more than 50 per cent of the vote. This would require an expensive run-off election that could take several months to arrange.

 The popularity of Qanooni among some Pashtun mujaheddin, moreover, suggests that the race may not break down along ethnic lines, as has been widely predicted, but instead become a contest between two clashing visions of Afghan society: one that is modern and western-leaning and one that is protective of traditional Islamic values.

 In Kandahar, Karzai?s campaign aides seemed confident of his success at the polls. Ahmad Wali Karzai, one of the President?s brothers and a wealthy Kandahar resident, has been receiving a steady stream of Pashtun tribal leaders from across the south pledging the support of their communities at the polls.

 ?Ninety-nine per cent of the provincial elders have guaranteed us they will vote for the President,? Karzai said. 

 ?We don?t see any strong challenger in any of the six southern provinces. From every district, they keep coming to volunteer. And the local cable channel has given us two channels free to use 24 hours for campaign messages.?

 Karzai suggested that any local support for Qanooni was limited to a small number of former militia commanders ? principally from one Pashtun tribe, the Alokozai ? who he said oppose the government programme to disarm and demobilise militias nationwide.

 ?They are against the programme, because they want to stay in business with their weapons and troops,? he said. He complained that officers under the city police chief, a Qanooni supporter, had taken down thousands of Karzai campaign posters in the city.

 Two new election surveys by international groups found that most Afghans responding were far more concerned about pressure or abuse from military commanders than about terrorist violence on election day.

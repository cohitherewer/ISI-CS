 Fearful Zardari to get protection

 Asif Ali Zardari

 Karachi, Dec. 17 (Reuters): The husband of Pakistan?s former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has been permitted to hire private security guards and use tinted glass in his vehicle after telling a court he feared for his safety.

 Asif Ali Zardari, freed on bail last month after spending eight years in jail on charges of corruption, murder and drug smuggling, complained to the court that police in the southern province of Sindh had refused to provide him with protection. 

 In a petition to the Sindh High Court, he also complained that the provincial authorities had ordered him to remove tinted glass from his vehicle.

 The court ruled that Zardari should be allowed to ?have the services of personal security/armed guards and to use tinted glass for his vehicle? until another hearing on December 22.

 Zardari said after the hearing that the court had ordered he be given police guards and also be allowed to have private security guards, but a copy of the court ruling made no mention of him being provided with police guards.

 Rauf Siddiqui, the provincial home minister, said the government respected the court order. ?We will implement and follow all the orders issued by the court,? he said, adding that security arrangements for Zardari were already in place.

 Sindh chief minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim said after Zardari?s release from jail last month he should restrict his movements because of security reasons.

 Sex and woman

 Los Angeles, Sept. 25 (Reuters): It?s the kind of plot twist that would have fit right in on Sex and the City.

 Less than a week after Cynthia Nixon won an Emmy award for her role for playing a hard-boiled but heterosexual lawyer on the HBO comedy, a source close to the actress yesterday confirmed New York newspaper reports that she is in a real-life relationship with another woman.

 ?Those stories are correct,? the source, who declined to be identified, said.

 According to the New York Daily News, Nixon, 38, and her lesbian lover have been seeing each other for about 10 months, following Nixon?s breakup in June 2003 with the father of her two children, photographer Danny Mozes.

 The actress? girlfriend was not identified, and the newspaper quoted an unnamed friend as saying: ?She?s just a private citizen who would like to remain private.? The actress herself was quoted by the Daily News as saying: ?My private life is private. But at the same time, I have nothing to hide. So what I will say is that I am very happy.?

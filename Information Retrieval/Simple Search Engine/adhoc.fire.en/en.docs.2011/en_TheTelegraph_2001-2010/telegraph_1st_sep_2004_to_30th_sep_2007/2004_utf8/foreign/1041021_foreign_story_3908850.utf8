Tokyo, Oct. 20 (Reuters): 

 Tom Cruise cemented his ties with Japan today, becoming 

 the first foreign actor to have his handprint earmarked 

 for a place on a central Tokyo square resembling Hollywood?s 

 Walk of Fame.

 The acclaim for Cruise coincided with news that Godzilla, a giant lizard-like Japanese movie character featured in numerous films, would be honoured on the Hollywood Boulevard sidewalk next month.

 ?I?m really honoured to be doing this today. I feel I have a very special relationship with Japanese audiences,? said Cruise, who starred in The Last Samurai, a movie set in 19th century Japan.

 Cruise, in Japan to promote his film Collateral, smiled and gave a thumbs-up with his left hand while making the imprint with his right before a crowd of adoring fans. The ceremony was held indoors because of heavy rain.

 New Milan opera house dazzles

 Milan, Dec. 8 (Reuters): Milan?s La Scala opera house reopened yesterday after a three-year renovation with dazzling displays both on stage and off.

 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, designer Giorgio Armani and actor Sophia Loren were among the famous faces that thronged into the cream foyer, marvelling at a faithful restoration of the 18th century house.

 More than 2,000 guests filled the frescoed bar, chandeliers glinted, 20,000 red roses glowed and women decked out in diamonds and evening dresses floated down the curved corridors behind La Scalas distinctive vertical boxes. Outside, anti-fur and anti-globalisation activists staged the protests that traditionally smudge the glitter of La Scala?s first nights.

 ?I?ve been waiting for this moment for so long. The house really is magical,? said Prince Emanuele Filiberto, who returned to Italy from exile.

 Oklahoma City, Sept. 18 (AP): Former child star Macaulay Culkin was arrested on drug charges yesterday during a traffic stop, authorities said.

 The 24-year-old actor, best known for his role in the Home Alone movies, was taken into custody on complaints of possession of a controlled dangerous substance without a valid prescription and possession of marijuana, according to the Oklahoma county sheriff?s office.

 Culkin, who lives in New York, was booked into the Oklahoma County Jail and re eased after posting $4,000 bond, a jailer said. Authorities confiscated about 17 g of marijuana from a vehicle in which Culkin was a passenger. Officers also found 16 mg of prescription medications used to control anxiety and seizures.

 Culkin was in a vehicle driven by a 22-year-old New York city man who was stopped for driving 70 mph in a 60-mph speed zone and for making an improper lane change. After receiving a verbal warning, the driver allowed police to search the vehicle. Culkin told an officer there was $3,000 in a bag on the floor of the car. The officer opened it and found a clear baggie of what appeared to be marijuana, the report said.

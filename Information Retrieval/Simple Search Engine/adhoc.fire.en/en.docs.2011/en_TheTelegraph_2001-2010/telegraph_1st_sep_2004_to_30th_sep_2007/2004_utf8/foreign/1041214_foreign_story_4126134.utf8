 Hu rescues close ally in bid to cement base

 Hu Jintao: Power games

 Beijing, Dec. 13 (Reuters): China?s Communist Party chief Hu Jintao moved a close political ally out of a problem-plauged province today and analysts say he will make more personnel changes as he continues to consolidate power.

 Hu only replaced Jiang Zemin in the country?s top military job in September after taking over as party chief in 2002, and political analysts say Hu is still consolidating power in the wake of his influential predecessor?s retirement.

 The official Xinhua news agency said today long-time Hu ally Li Keqiang had been removed as party chief of trouble-ridden central Henan and appointed to the northeastern rust-belt province of Liaoning, which houses the booming port city of Dalian.

 ?It?s a sign Hu Jintao?s sun is rising and Jiang Zemin?s is setting,? Kou Chien-wen, a Taipei-based China watcher, said by telephone.

 New York-based news portal chinesenewsnet.com also said Hu was expected to promote at least three allies to party chiefs of northeastern Heilongjiang province, northern Shaanxi province and southern Guangxi province.

 At 49, Li is one of China?s youngest provincial governors and a rising star in the party. He was previously with the Communist Youth League, Hu?s power base.

 Li went to Henan as acting governor in 1998 and was promoted to party chief in 2002.

 But Henan is potentially bad news for any politician?s career because China?s most populous province has been hit hard by AIDS, which spread through botched blood-selling schemes in the 1990s, before Li became the provincial party boss.

 Activists estimate more than one million are likely infected with HIV in Henan.

 ?Li Keqiang had wanted to leave Henan for some time now because he did not want to be held responsible for the mass deaths over AIDS,? activist Hu Jia said.

 In other problems in the province, 150 workers were killed in a coal mine explosion in October. The same month, at least seven people were killed in clashes between Muslims and Han Chinese after a traffic accident involving members of the two groups.

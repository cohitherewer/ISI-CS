 Bride amp; gloom at wedding

 COLIN JOYCE 

 Tokyo, Nov. 28: It was, by all accounts, a memorably grand occasion. About 400 guests attended the royal wedding of Japan?s Prince Arisugawa in April last year, including scions of high-born families, actors and television personalities.

 The prince and his bride appeared in antique court robes before he changed into the uniform of an honorary general, complete with ceremonial sword, and she into an ornate wedding dress. A famous actor, Junichi Ishida, toasted the royal couple in a speech.

 Perhaps the guests should have become suspicious when they were expected to hand over ?185 a head at the reception ? held at a private club in the grounds of the Canadian Embassy, next to the royal family?s home in Akasaka Palace.

 They were also charged an extra ?50 ? some reportedly gave much larger sums ? for posing for photographs with the imperial couple.

 What?s more, no other members of the royal family were present, the food was ?unspectacular? and lavish presents traditionally given to departing guests were merely plates bearing the Arisugawa crest.

 But it was not until six months later, when the police arrested three people for fraud, that the wedding guests learned that they had been duped by a grandiose and elaborate sting.

 The sorry tale of social-climbing and deception unwound in grand style last week. At a court in Tokyo, Shinya Kusanagi, a 43-year-old event planner, was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence for conning more than 13 million yen (?67,000) from gullible ?guests? who brought cash gifts in return for attending the fake royal wedding.

 ?Prince Arisugawa? was in fact Yasuyuki Kitano, 42, a commoner suspected of impersonating royalty for more than a decade. The Arisugawa branch of the imperial family died out about 80 years ago. Even the marriage was not legal, as it was not properly registered.

 Most guests had been in no mood to wonder whether they were being taken for a very expensive ride. Espa Ito, a television comedian, suggested that he was flattered to be asked. ?For a hick like me to get invited to a royal wedding was quite something,? he reflected.

 Prosecutors were only able to confirm that 150 guests attended the ?wedding? as many were too embarrassed to come forward.

 The enormous reverence in which the Japanese royal family is held had apparently assuaged any doubts. 

 The party, as guests? invitations reminded them, was being held in a place ?loved by Prince Takamado? ? the late cousin of Emperor Akihito, who died of a heart attack playing squash in the embassy grounds in 2002.

 Ruling on the case, Judge Takaaki Oshima told Kusanagi: ?You knew that Kitano was not a royal and you organised the wedding party for the purpose of fraud. You took money from guests who came out of respect for the imperial family.?

 The trials of Kitano and Harumi Sakamoto ? a divorced mother-of-two who posed as his bride ? continue.

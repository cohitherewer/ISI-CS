 Blair to spell out poll plan

 Tony Blair

 London, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Britain?s Tony Blair will spell out this week his legislative plans for the next session of parliament ? tantamount to an election manifesto, with the Prime Minister expected to go to the polls in May next year.

 Officials said the government?s plans, which will be read out to peers and politicians by Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday as tradition demands, would centre on security and crime, ranging from street violence to terrorism.

 The Queen?s speech will also include a bill on the European Union constitution, which will first be debated by parliament and then referred to the public in a referendum in early 2006. The bill may say what question will be put to Britons, who promise Blair an uphill battle to convince them to vote ?Yes?.

 Bills to introduce identification cards and set up a British version of the FBI, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, will grab the headlines along with new powers against drug barons.

 ?(We will) build safe and secure communities, safe from terrorism at the top, from organised crime, from drug trafficking, from human trafficking and then from yobbery down in our localities,? senior minister Peter Hain said.

 Home secretary David Blunkett said today he would consider more anti-terrorism laws ? including courts without juries and powers to target people merely suspected of ?acts preparatory to terrorism? ? but not until after the election.

 ?On Tuesday we?ll have the same old talk from Tony Blair. More promises, more wrong priorities,? Conservative leader Michael Howard said.

 Two terror suspects held after Hague raid

 The Hague, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Dutch police stormed an apartment and arrested two people today, ending a 14-hour stand-off that began when suspects sought in anti-terrorism probe wounded three officers in a hand grenade blast.

 A police spokesman said a special police unit entered the apartment in The Hague to end the drama that began when officers launched a pre-dawn raid on the building. Police said the suspects resisted arrest and threw a grenade at them.

 Heavily-armed police had circled the building all day, which is located in a poor neighbourhood of The Hague where almost half the population is immigrant. The area was cordoned off.

 One bystander estimated there were almost 200 police on the scene, including officers wearing balaclava masks and carrying machineguns.

 Shots had been heard as dusk fell. Police said one of the suspects had been injured in the shoulder. The raid came amid an upsurge in violence after the killing of outspoken filmmaker Theo van Gogh.

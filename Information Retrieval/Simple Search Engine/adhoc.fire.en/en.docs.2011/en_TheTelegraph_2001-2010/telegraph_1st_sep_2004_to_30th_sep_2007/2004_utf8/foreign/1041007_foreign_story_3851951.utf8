 Sprightly Blair shows off health

 Khartoum, Oct. 6 (Reuters): 

 Days after a heart operation, Tony Blair showed off his 

 health in Sudan?s sweltering heat today and sought to limit 

 speculation over his future by reaffirming his intention 

 to serve a full third term.

 Looking sprightly as he stood in the middle of the British ambassador?s garden in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, the Prime Minister laughed at questions on his health. ?In respect of my health, I think you can all see,? the 51-year-old Blair told a news conference on a typically humid day measuring about 35 degrees Celsius.

 ?Here I am addressing you yet again. There is nothing I find more conducive to quick recuperation and recovery than engagement with the British media,? he added. 

 Blair was treated for recurrent heart palpitations on Friday in an operation his aides described as routine and successful.

 In a public display of stamina, Blair is on a three-day visit to Africa to discuss the violence in Darfur with the Sudanese government and attend a regional summit in Ethiopia that starts tomorrow.

 Blair slept a few hours on an overnight flight from London before going straight into back-to-back meetings with Sudanese officials.

 At the news conference, Blair was also quizzed about the speculation over his future accompanying his heart treatment. 

 ?A full term is a full term. That is what it means,? he insisted. ?There comes a point of time when inevitably a political leader steps down. I do not intend to do that (during a third term) provided the British people re-elect us.?

 Before he went into hospital, Blair announced on Thursday night that he wanted to serve a full third term as Prime Minister but would not contemplate a fourth.

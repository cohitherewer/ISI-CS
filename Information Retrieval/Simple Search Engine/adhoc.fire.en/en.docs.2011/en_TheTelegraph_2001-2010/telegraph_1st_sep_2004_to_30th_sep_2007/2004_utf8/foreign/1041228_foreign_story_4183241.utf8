 China threat

 Beijing/Taipei, Dec. 27 (Reuters): China?s military will crush any major moves towards independence by Taiwan, a Beijing government policy paper said today, prompting the self-governing island to accuse Beijing of escalating tensions.

 The defence paper was released as senior Chinese lawmakers discussed a draft anti-secession law that analysts say may legally bind China to take military action if the island it claims as a renegade province declares statehood.

 ?Should the Taiwan authorities go so far as to make a reckless attempt that constitutes a major incident of ?Taiwan independence?, the Chinese people and armed forces will resolutely and thoroughly crush it at any cost,? the paper said. Taipei called on the world community ?to stop China before it is too late?. Taiwan split from the mainland at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, but Beijing still sees the democratic island of 23 million as a part of Chinese territory.

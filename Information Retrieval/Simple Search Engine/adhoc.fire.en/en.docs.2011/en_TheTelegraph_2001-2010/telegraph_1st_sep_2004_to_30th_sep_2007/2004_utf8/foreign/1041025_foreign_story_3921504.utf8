 Slight edge for Bush

 Washington, Oct. 24 (Reuters): President George W. Bush maintained a slim two-point lead on Democratic rival John Kerry for the third consecutive day in a tight race for the White House, according to a Reuters/Zogby poll released today.

 Bush led Kerry 48-46 per cent in the latest three-day tracking poll, a statistical dead heat that was within the poll?s margin of error. 

 Bush?s lead among likely voters the previous day was 47-45.

 The number of undecided voters in the poll fell to 4 per cent. Pollster John Zogby said only one in five of the undecided voters felt Bush deserved a second term in the White House.

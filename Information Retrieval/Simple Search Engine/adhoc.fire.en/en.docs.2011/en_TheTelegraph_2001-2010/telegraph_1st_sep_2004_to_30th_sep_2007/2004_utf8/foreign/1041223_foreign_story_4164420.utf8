 Rebels plan Kathmandu siege

 Kathmandu, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Nepal?s Maoist rebels said today they would indefinitely block vehicles travelling on two of the three main highways leading to the capital, raising fears of another serious disruption of supplies to Kathmandu.

 The rebels, fighting to topple constitutional monarchy and establish communist rule, successfully cut off the hill-ringed capital from the rest of the country for a week in August.

 The latest ban on vehicle movement was due to start tomorrow. Violence has acclerated in the run up to a January 13 deadline by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to the rebels to join talks.

 ?No means of transport will be allowed on these roads,? a local Maoist leader said, referring to the Nagdhunga-Benighat and Bhainse-Naubise roads that link Kathmandu to the southern plains.

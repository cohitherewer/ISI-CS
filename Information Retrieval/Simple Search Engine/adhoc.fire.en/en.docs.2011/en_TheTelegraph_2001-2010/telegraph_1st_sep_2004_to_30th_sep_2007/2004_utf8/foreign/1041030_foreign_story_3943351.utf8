 A reunion after three years

 Ramallah (West Bank), Oct. 

 29 (Reuters): For ailing Palestinian President Yasser 

 Arafat, a reunion with a nine-year-old daughter he hasn?t 

 seen for three years could be just what the doctor ordered.

 ?You will see Daddy soon in Paris my sweet,? Arafat?s wife, Suha, told their daughter, Zahwa, by telephone from his West Bank headquarters before the Palestinian leader was flown to France for hospital treatment today, an official said.

 The 75-year-old Arafat, weakened by what doctors think may be leukaemia, got on the line and delivered the same message to the child in the telephone call to Tunisia.

 Suha Arafat, 41, was reunited with her husband yesterday for the first time since 2001, when she moved to Paris with Zahwa. 

 Mother and daughter now live in Tunis.

 Sadr militia to disarm

 Baghdad, Oct. 9 (Reuters): A Shia militia led by Moqtada al-Sadr agreed today to disarm under a deal that could pacify a Baghdad flashpoint and remove one obstacle to Iraq?s plan to hold nationwide elections in January.

 Sadr?s militia has staged two uprisings against US and Iraqi forces this year. An insurgency by Sunni rebels still rages in large swathes of central and northern Iraq.

 Saddam Hussein?s former deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz is alive, the US military in Iraq said today, denying a swirl of TV reports that he had died.

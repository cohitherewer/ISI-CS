 Nike dragon draws China fire

 Beijing, Dec. 7 (Reuters): 

 China has kicked up a stink over a Nike footwear advertisement 

 in which US basketball star LeBron James takes on and subdues 

 a series of traditional Chinese characters ranging from 

 a cartoon kung fu master to a couple of dragons.

 Nike Inc and James have been named the first targets in China?s new censorship drive aimed at keeping advertising deemed offensive off the air.

 China?s state administration of radio, film and television yesterday ordered stations nationwide to stop broadcasts of Nike?s LeBron James in Chamber of Fear advertisements that it said had sparked anger and claims of offending ?national feelings.?

 In the advertisement, James, 19, a forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers, makes easy work of animated enemies including a white-haired kung fu master, two women in traditional Chinese garb and the pair of dragons as he ascends the video game-like levels of the ?Chamber?.

 ?The ad has aroused strong public indignation,? said a statement on the state administration?s website.

 It violated rules that stipulated ?all ads broadcast on television should protect national dignity and interests and respect the motherland?s traditional culture?.

 Nike?s main China office in Shanghai referred questions to their public relations agent which said it was meeting Nike representatives later.

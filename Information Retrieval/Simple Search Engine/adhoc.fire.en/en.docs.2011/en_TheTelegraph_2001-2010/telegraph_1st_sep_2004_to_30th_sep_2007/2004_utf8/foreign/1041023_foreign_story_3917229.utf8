 Two more soldiers face Iraq abuse trial

 Baghdad, Oct. 22 (Reuters): A US military court in Baghdad today ordered two more soldiers, including an alleged ringleader, to stand trial over the sexual and physical abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison.

 Military judge Colonel James Pohl rejected a bid by the defence counsel for one of the soldiers, Sergeant Javal Davis, to force defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld to testify at his trial.

 Like others convicted over the Abu Ghraib affair, which created world outrage, Davis and Specialist Charles Graner argue they were following orders to soften prisoners up for interrogation.

 Graner, named by one co-accused as a ringleader, faces up to 28 years in jail and other penalties on charges including cruelty, assault, committing indecent acts and adultery.

 A military investigator has told another court Graner, 36, had been identified by fellow accused Private Lynndie England as the father of her baby born this month. The adultery charge stems from that relationship.

 Graner is due to stand trial on January 7 and Davis on February 1. Both are army reservists. ?We are going to win. He was acting under fully lawful orders at the time,? Graner?s counsel, Guy Womack, told reporters at today?s hearing at a US base.

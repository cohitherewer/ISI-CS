 Song on lips, scandal-hit Blunkett quits

 David Blunkett

 London, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Senior British government minister David Blunkett, a trusted ally of Prime Minister Tony Blair, resigned today, a government official confirmed.

 Asked if Blunkett had resigned, a spokesperson for the home secretary said: ?Yes?.

 The resignation follows weeks of allegations that Blunkett abused his office to fast-track a visa for the nanny of a former lover and after he criticised senior government ministers in a biography.

 Blair had stood by his home secretary, awaiting an inquiry into whether Blunkett helped to obtain a UK residence visa for the Filipina child-minder of his ex-lover Kimberly Quinn.

 But Blunkett, who reached the top of the political tree despite his blindness, may have invited upon himself a curse which has befallen several other UK politicians who have dared to sing in public.

 He serenaded a pre-Christmas party this week ? a performance regarded as an error of judgement at such a sensitive time.

 Onlookers were stunned as Blunkett burst into a rendition of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers? Pick Yourself Up.

 The Mirror newspaper said Blunkett chirped, in a voice described as more Louis Armstrong than an angel, ?I pick myself up, dust myself off, start all over again?.

 Members of his party, already nervous at the stream of negative headlines Blunkett has garnered, were aghast.

 ?There is obviously general concern. I don?t want to comment specifically on this song,? said Bob Marshall-Andrews, a senior figure in Blair?s Labour party. ?But ultimately, if he is not up to his job then he has to go.?

 Abroad, the curse does not hold so firm. Billionaire Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was once a cruise-ship singer, Japanese Premier Junichiro Koizumi crooned an Elvis hit with actor Tom Cruise and Bill Clinton made a media virtue of his elementary skills on the saxophone.

 But in Britain, a song can be the last straw, maybe because reticent English are embarrassed to see their elected representatives in such unfamiliar territory.

 Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont famously admitted to singing in the bath after the pound bombed out of Europe?s exchange rate mechanism on his watch. He was sacked a while later. Peter Brooke did not last long as Northern Ireland secretary after singing My Darling Clementine on a TV chat show shortly after an IRA bomb killed seven workers in 1992.

 Conservative John Redwood will forever be haunted by footage of him nervously mouthing words to a Welsh anthem, which he clearly did not know, while in charge of the principality. That was his last job in government.

 And British political anoraks will never forget Peter Lilley who, as deputy leader of the Conservatives, refashioned Land of Hope and Glory at the party?s 1998 conference in an attempt to lampoon Blair?s claims to trendiness.

 To the horror of watching advisers, he sang in a thin voice: ?Land of chattering classes, No more pageantry, Darlings, raise your glasses, To brave modernity.?

 Lilley has since been tangled up in the political undergrowth.

 Far better, when in trouble, to reach for a pithy phrase.

 Margaret Thatcher stiffened followers? resolve by declaring: ?The lady?s not for turning?, and led on for many more years. 

 Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson pulled off a similar trick to defuse talk he may be toppled by plotters. ?I know what?s going on. I?m going on,? he told his party conference.

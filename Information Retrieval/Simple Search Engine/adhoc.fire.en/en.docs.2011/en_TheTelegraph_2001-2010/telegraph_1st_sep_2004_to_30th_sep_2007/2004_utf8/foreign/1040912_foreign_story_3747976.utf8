 Genesis capsule parts intact

 Washington, Sept. 11 (Reuters): After peering inside Nasa?s broken Genesis capsule with flashlights and mirrors, scientists said yesterday the craft?s unexpected crash landing left solar material intact and most scientific objectives within reach.

 ?We should be able to meet most if not all of our primary science goals,? Roger Wiens, a key scientist on the project, said. ?Overall, were quite confident that we can achieve a high degree of success from a science point of view.?

 The $264 million mission was designed to collect charged solar particles on delicate wafer-like plates and return them to Earth for examination. The wafers were believed to be so fragile that a helicopter-assisted parachute landing was planned. But the parachute failed to deploy on Wednesday, sending Genesis hurtling to Earth at 320 kmph.

 The crash left Genesis cracked and embedded in the Utah desert, and scientists were demoralised at first, said Don Sevilla, the lead engineer in the recovery project.

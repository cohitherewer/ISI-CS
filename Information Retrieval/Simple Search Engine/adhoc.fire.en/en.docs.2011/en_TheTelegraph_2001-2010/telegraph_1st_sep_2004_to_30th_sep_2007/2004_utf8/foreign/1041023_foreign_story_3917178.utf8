 Hamas cries revenge

 Gaza, Oct. 22 (Reuters): Hamas vowed today to hit back hard for Israel?s assassination of Adnan al-Ghoul, the ?Father of the Qassam? ? a rocket symbolising Palestinian militants? defiance of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his plan to quit Gaza.

 Israel killed Ghoul, number two in Hamas? military wing, just days before the Israeli parliament is to hold a key vote on Sharon?s proposal to remove all 21 Jewish settlements in Gaza and four of the 120 in the West Bank.

 The assassination of the master bombmaker and his aide Imad Abbas in a missile strike on their car in Gaza yesterday could help Sharon counter Far-Right opponents who say the withdrawal would reward and encourage Palestinian attacks.

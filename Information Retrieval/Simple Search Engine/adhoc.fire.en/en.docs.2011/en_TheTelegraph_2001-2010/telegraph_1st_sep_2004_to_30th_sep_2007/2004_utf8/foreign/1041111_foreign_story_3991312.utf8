 Smoking ban

 London, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Scotland became the latest country to take a stand against tobacco today by announcing a ban on smoking in public buildings.

 Scotland?s first minister Jack McConnell announced the decision today in an effort to dissuade the next generation from becoming addicted to cigarettes. ?I am proud to announce to parliament today that we will introduce a comprehensive ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces,? McConnell said. ?We noted the unequivocal evidence that smoke-free public areas will save lives,? he added.

 The ban is expected to be implemented in bars, restaurants and other enclosed public spaces by spring 2006.

 It comes only eight months after Ireland became the first country in the world to ban smoking in restaurants and pubs. Since then several more, including Norway and Malta, have imposed similar bans while in the US, New York city also has restrictions in place.

 Rhona Brankin, Scotland?s deputy health minister, said the death toll from smoking in Scotland was ?appalling,? with as many as one in four deaths among the five million population directly attributable to the habit. Smoking-related illnesses account for 35,000 hospital admissions in Scotland every year.

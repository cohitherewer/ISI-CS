 Charles to set record straight

 London, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Prince Charles will hit back tomorrow at government accusations that he is old-fashioned and out of touch in his views on ordinary people?s aspirations.

 At a seminar in London, the prince will say his ideas may be old-fashioned, but that does not mean they are wrong.

 He will also deny that he believes people should not try to rise above their station, according to officials. ?Success can come in many forms. In my view it is just as great an achievement to be a plumber or a bricklayer as it is to be a lawyer or a doctor,? he will say.

 Education secretary Charles Clarke said last week the prince should think carefully before intervening in the debate on education, and should not discourage ambitious children. He was reacting to comments made by the prince in a memo read out as evidence in an employment tribunal after one of his personal assistants suggested she and people like her should be trained for more senior positions in his household.

 ?What is wrong with everyone nowadays?? the prince wrote in the memo. ?Why do they all seem to think they are qualified to do things far beyond their capabilities??

 ?People think they can all be pop stars, high court judges, brilliant TV personalities...without ever putting in the necessary work or having natural ability.? Critics interpreted his outburst as evidence of snobbery ? an attempt to keep people in their place and stop them rising through Britain?s notoriously class-ridden social hierarchy.

 Supporters said he was advocating a flexible education system. ?Not everyone has the same talents or abilities but everyone, with the right nurturing, can make a real difference to their communities and to the country,? Charles will say tomorrow. ?Ambition is a good thing and should never be constrained by a person?s starting point in life.?

 Prove if fit for club, EU tells Turkey

 Brussels, Dec. 16 (Reuters): The European Commission president urged Turkey today ?to go the extra mile? to show Europeans it is ready for EU membership talks as the bloc prepared to approve them despite misgivings by many voters.

 Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan lobbied EU leaders intensively hours before the start of a crucial summit, urging them not to set discriminatory conditions and to open the doors of the bloc to a non-Christian nation.

 Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said it was up to Turkey to demonstrate it was fit to join the club, notably by recognising Cyprus, something Ankara has so far rejected. He voiced confidence EU leaders would agree a date to open talks. ?The challenge for Turkey is to win the hearts and minds of those European citizens who are open to, but not yet fully convinced of, Turkey?s European destiny,? Barroso said.

 ?I believe Turkey must sooner rather than later break new ground. It must go the extra mile,? he said.

 Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said after talks with Erdogan he believed Turkey would agree to extend its existing EU pact to the 10 new member states, giving de facto recognition to Cyprus, before starting entry talks next year.

 Turkish officials said Erdogan was trying to persuade the leaders not to describe the negotiations as ?open-ended? or refer to possible permanent safeguards against labour migration from Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation of 70 million.

 But EU officials said both terms were likely to be in tomorrow?s summit statement.

 ?They (EU) seem to have a positive approach to our sensitivities but we cannot say that all of the issues have been settled yet,? Erdogan said after meeting Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

 The Italian leader vowed to fight for an immediate date for starting talks without preconditions, saying he believed ?it is in the interests of the European people and of the West to have Turkey in the EU, to smooth the dialogue between cultures?.

 Diplomats said Erdogan was taking a moderate tone in private meetings with EU leaders and was not threatening to walk out.

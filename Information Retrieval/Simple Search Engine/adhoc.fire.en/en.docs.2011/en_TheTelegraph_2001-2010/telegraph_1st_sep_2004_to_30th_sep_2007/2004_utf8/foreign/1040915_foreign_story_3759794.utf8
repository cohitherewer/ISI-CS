 Baghdad car bomb carnage

 Baghdad, Sept. 14 (Reuters): 

 A huge car bomb blast tore through a crowded market close 

 to a Baghdad police headquarters building today, killing 

 at least 47 people in the deadliest single attack in the 

 Iraqi capital in six months.

 An Internet statement in the name of the Tawhid and Jihad group led by Jordanian al Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the blast, which it said was carried out by a suicide attacker. Washington says Zarqawi is its top enemy in Iraq and has put a $25 million price on his head. ?With the grace of God, a lion from our martyrdom brigades was successful in striking a centre for apostate police volunteers,? said the statement, which could not be verified. The health ministry said 47 people were killed and 114 wounded. The interior ministry said at least one car bomb was used in the attack on Haifa street, a flashpoint area notorious as a stronghold of criminals and guerrillas.

 In a separate incident in the restive town of Baquba, northeast of Baghdad, gunmen opened fire on a police minibus. The town?s police chief said 12 people were killed. Zarqawi?s group also claimed responsibility for that attack.

 Guerrillas also blew up oil pipelines in northern Iraq, cutting northern oil exports and forcing a nearby power station to be shut down. The attack meant large areas of Iraq were without electricity from 2300 GMT yesterday onwards. The Baghdad blast caused carnage in the crowded market and streets near the police headquarters building. ?I was standing there talking to my friend when suddenly all I saw was blood, and my friend lying dead,? said an Iraqi man who gave his name as Zafer, speaking from his hospital bed with blood and scratches on his face and bandages on his stomach.

 Hospital workers hosed pools of blood from the floor. At the blast site, rescuers pulled bodies from mangled market stalls. The area was littered with shoes, clothes and body parts, as well as fruit and vegetables from the market. Bloodstained corpses lay on pavements strewn with chairs, glass and rubble from blown-out shopfronts. 

 Dazed bystanders vainly checked bodies for signs of life. Smoke from blazing vehicles in the middle of the street billowed into the sky as fire crews tried to douse the flames. A huge crater was punched into the road. On Sunday, guerrillas mounted multiple car bomb and mortar attacks in central Baghdad, during a day of violence in which more than 100 people were killed across the country. Many of yesterday?s casualties were also on Haifa Street, where US troops have repeatedly clashed with guerrillas.

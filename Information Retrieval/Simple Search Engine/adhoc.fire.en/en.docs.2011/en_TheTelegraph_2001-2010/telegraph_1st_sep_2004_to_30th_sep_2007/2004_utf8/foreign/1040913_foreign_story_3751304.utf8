 Carnage tests Karzai power

 Herat, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Seven supporters of an ousted Afghan governor were killed and 20 were wounded today in clashes with police and US troops after crowds torched UN offices, medics and witnesses said.

 The violence occurred as protests erupted for a second day after President Hamid Karzai, campaigning for a presidential poll on October 9, replaced Ismail Khan as governor of the western city of Herat yesterday as part of a plan to rein in warlords.

 Bursts of small arms fire could still be heard round the city in the evening, as Afghan and US forces attempted to restore order after hundreds of Khan?s supporters burned and looted the UN offices and set fire to the Pakistani consulate.

 A Reuters reporter saw Khan backers shouting ?Death to Karzai? and ?Death to America? before setting fire to the offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN Assistance Mission and the UN Development Programme.

 Protesters threw stones at US soldiers in a Humvee.

 ?I have so far received seven bodies of protesters,? said a doctor at Herat?s central hospital. A Reuters cameraman saw at least 20 people being treated for gunshot wounds at the hospital.

 ?I was protesting in front of the UN office when the Americans shot me in the leg,? said Abdul Hamed.

 Karzai told a news conference Afghans had the right to protest peacefully. ?(But) anyone who resorts to violence against the UN or NGOs, these are rioters hurting the Afghan people and we will deal with them strongly,? he said.

 Hospital officials and witnesses said at least two people were killed in clashes with US and Afghan forces yesterday. The US military disputed this, saying two people were hurt.

 The violence occurred despite the presence of hundreds of Afghan and US troops in Herat and US military helicopters flying low overhead.

 UN spokesperson Manoel de Almeida e Silva said UN staff had been evacuated to the US military compound in the city and there were no reports that any had been hurt.

 Karzai replaced the governors of Herat and the restive province of Ghor after launching his election manifesto with a pledge to rein in warlords.

 Afghanistan?s ambassador to Ukraine, Sayed Mohammad Khairkhwa, arrived in Herat today to replace Khan.

 US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, a close Karzai confidant, said he was not aware of any deaths and praised security forces for restraint, even though some had been hurt by stone throwers.

 He said he had spoken to Khan, who would appear on television to urge cooperation with the new governor. ?I think it?s sent a clear message of where Afghanistan is headed and how you can be a part of the future of Afghanistan,? Khalilzad said of Khan?s replacement and other changes.

 Karzai had offered Khan, long a thorn in his side, the job of minister of mines. But Khan rejected the post, saying he would remain in Herat as a ?private citizen?.

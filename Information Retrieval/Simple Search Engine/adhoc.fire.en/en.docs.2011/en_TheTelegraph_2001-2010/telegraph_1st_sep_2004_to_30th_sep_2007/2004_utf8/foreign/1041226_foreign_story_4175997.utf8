 Incivility 2004 top word, OK!

Los Angeles, Dec. 25 (Reuters): The electoral 

shorthand for a divided America and the perceived nastiness of the US presidential 

race generated the defining words and phrases of the year, a website specialising 

in language said yesterday.

 The top phrase of 2004 was ?red states/blue states,? followed by ?moral values,? and ?two Americas,? the website yourDictionary.com said in its annual review of the changing state of the English language.

 ?Incivility,? which shot to prominence to describe what some commentators saw as the unprecedented shrillness of the US political debate, was the year?s top word, said Paul J.J. Payack, president of the language website. ?The main event that people were watching across the world in the past year was the US presidential campaign,? Payack said. ?That had a direct effect on English worldwide.? 

 In assembling its annual list, the website polls a network of linguists and language enthusiasts and tracks how prominently words are used in the media. In 2003, the roster drew heavily from the Iraq war, including ?embedded,? as in reporters assigned to accompany troops, and ?shock and awe,? a term used by US military planners to describe the opening phase of the war.

 Other top words for 2004 included ?blogosphere,? a term for the collective writings of Internet commentators who maintain Web logs, and ?flip-flop,? a charge of inconsistency that hurt Democratic nominee John Kerry. Technology contributed two of the year?s top words. Apple Computer Inc.?s iPod is fast becoming a synonym for digital music, the website said. The most widely spoken English word in 2004 remained ?OK,? a term also once popularised by US presidential politics, the website said. The widespread use of the word dates to the US presidential election of 1840, when Democratic nominee and incumbent Martin Van Buren was nicknamed ?Old Kinderhook? after his New York birthplace, Payack said. His supporters formed the ?OK Club,? which popularised the term but failed to deliver a re-election victory for Van Buren.

 Troops in Malaysia flu war

 Kuala Lumpur, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Malaysia is sending more troops to its border with Thailand to check smuggling of chickens into northern Kelantan state, under quarantine for a bird flu virus that can kill humans, defence officials said today.

 Around 40 extra soldiers will join the 400 Malaysian troops already deployed to watch border entry points into Kelantan, where thousands of birds were culled since the H5N1 strain of bird flu surfaced there last month, the officials said.

 ?We are adding 10 per cent more to that figure (of 400) for enhanced security,? Zulkifeli Mohd Zin, a senior army officer in Kelantan, was quoted as saying by state news agency Bernama.

 The reinforcement comes after the arrest of three people in Kelantan this week for smuggling in chicken meat from Thailand, where nine people have died from bird flu this year.

 Malaysia has yet to have a human victim of the disease, which has killed 29 people in Asia this year. The Southeast Asian country has so far contained its bird flu outbreak in one state.

 Officials said the bird population in Kelantan was more than 2.8 million but only around 4,000 have been culled.

 President to hang on as general

 Pervez Musharraf

 Islamabad, Sept. 15: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf will stay on as chief of the army staff, despite a promise that he would give up his military post by the end of the year.

 ?The President has decided to keep both offices of the President and the army chief beyond December 31,? information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told Reuters.

 Musharraf had previously promised to stand down as army chief by the end of 2004 in a deal with hardline Islamic opponents under which they agreed to enhance his powers. 

 ?The national situation demands that he keeps the two offices,? Ahmed told the Associated Press.

 Asked why Musharraf was going back on a promise to quit as army chief, Ahmed said: ?The situation has changed.?

 The decision comes after weeks of speculation, some fuelled by Musharraf himself, that he was considering backing out of the agreement with the hardliners.

 Battle lines drawn

 The pace for a possible constitutional battle was set during the day when the Northwestern Frontier Province (NWFP) assembly asked the President to make up his mind, adds Imtiaz Gul.

 ?The President should decide whether he will retain the presidency or office of the army chief after December 31,? the provincial assembly said in a resolution without suggesting any middle course.

 Fifty-five members supported and 14 opposed the resolution in a House dominated by the religio-political conglomerate Mutahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA), which rules the province and sits in opposition in the federal legislature.

 ?The NWFP Assembly deems Punjab Assembly?s resolution on President?s uniform a breach of the constitution and believes that the President will have to relinquish one of his two offices after December 31,? said the resolution.

 It came two days after the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-led Punjab House asked the President to continue as the army chief in the ?best national interests?.

 The ?uniform? controversy broke after Musharraf recently told a private TV channel that 96 per cent of Pakistanis wanted him to continue as army chief. ?I don?t think that even the West or the US will show any adverse reaction,? he had added.

 The MMA had last year announced its support to a package of constitutional reforms that had virtually indemnified all the actions and laws after Musharraf?s October 1999 coup against the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. In return, Musharraf had agreed to shed his uniform by December 31.

 The Alliance for Restoration of Democracy, made of the Pakistan People?s Party and the Pakistan Muslim League of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, respectively, has threatened to launch a public mobilisation campaign later this month against Musharraf.

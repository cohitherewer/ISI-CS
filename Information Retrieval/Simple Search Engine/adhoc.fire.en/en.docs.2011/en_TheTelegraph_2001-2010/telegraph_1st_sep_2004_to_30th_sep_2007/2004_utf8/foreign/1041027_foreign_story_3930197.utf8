 Pak death penalty for honour killings

Islamabad, Oct. 26 (Reuters): Pakistan?s National 

Assembly passed a Bill today that prescribes the death penalty for those who kill 

women in the name of family honour.

 Under centuries-old tribal customs, hundreds of women are killed in Pakistan every year for bringing shame to their families by marrying for love, committing adultery or earning an inadequate dowry. The so-called ?honour killings? are particularly common in rural Pakistan, where feudal and tribal laws hold sway.

 The Bill, passed by the lower house of Parliament on a voice vote, proposed the death sentence for the most extreme cases and prison terms from seven years to life.

 ?We have framed a law which should be a source of pride for women,? Nilofar Bakhtiar, adviser to the Prime Minister on women?s affairs, told the House after the passage of the Bill.

 ?We must have the confidence and courage to redefine the word honour,? she said.

 Human rights activists have long demanded that the government take stringent measures to curb honour killings. Government officials say there were more than 1,200 such killings in 2003.

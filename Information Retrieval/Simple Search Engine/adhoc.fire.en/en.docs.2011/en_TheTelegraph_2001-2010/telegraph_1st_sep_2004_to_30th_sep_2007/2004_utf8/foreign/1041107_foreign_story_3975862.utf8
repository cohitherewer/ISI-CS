 Musharraf lauds Karzai poll victory

 Kabul, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Pakistan?s President Pervez Musharraf today congratulated President Hamid Karzai on his election victory and said the neighbours needed to increase cooperation in the war on terror.

 Both Pakistan and Afghanistan are key allies of the US in its war on terror, but relations have been tense at times, particularly over Afghan accusations that anti-government rebels find sanctuary in Pakistani border regions. Musharraf became the first head of state to travel to Afghanistan to congratulate Karzai for his October 9 victory and praised Afghanistan for a successful election.

 ?It augurs well not just for Afghanistan, but for the region and also for Pakistan,? he told a news briefing after talks with Karzai at his heavily guarded presidential palace in Kabul. Musharraf said the destinies of Afghanistan and Pakistan were interlinked and both had to succeed in the war on terror.

 ?There is tremendous cooperation going on and we would like this cooperation to continue and be more extensive,? he said. ?The intelligence side must cooperate with each other in locating and identifying areas of successful cooperation.?

 Musharraf said Pakistan?s efforts to prevent militants crossing the border to disrupt the polls had helped the elections pass off smoothly.

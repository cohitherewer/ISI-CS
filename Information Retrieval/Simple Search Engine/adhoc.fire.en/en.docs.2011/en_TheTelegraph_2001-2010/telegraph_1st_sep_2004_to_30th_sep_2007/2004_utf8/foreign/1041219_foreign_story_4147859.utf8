 Pervez not to shed uniform

 Pervez Musharraf: Uniform move

 Karachi, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has said he will stay on as army chief, reneging on a pledge to quit the powerful post by the end of the year.

 ?I will remain in uniform even after December 31. I am telling you this for the first time,? Musharraf said in an interview with the private Kawish Television Network late yesterday.

 Musharraf pledged last year to shed his military uniform by the end of 2004 in return for support for constitutional changes validating his rule and giving him extensive power under a deal with an alliance of Islamist parties.

 Musharraf promised to tell Pakistan why he had changed his mind.

 ?I will talk to the nation in a few days. .... and tell them some reasons, and explain that,? said Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless coup in 1999.

 Musharraf previously signalled that he believed quitting as army chief would undermine Pakistan?s support for the US ?war on terror? and his efforts to make peace with India. The military has ruled Pakistan for more than half of the 57 years it has been an independent nation.

 Political opponents lambasted Musharraf for going back on his word to step down as army chief.

 ?This is a violation of the constitution and a violation of a pledge he made to the 150 million people of Pakistan,? said Liaquat Baluch, a leader of the Islamic Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA).

 ?He is practically bringing an end (to) the constitution,? Baluch said, adding that the conservative Islamic alliance would ?take all possible measures to remove? Musharraf from the government.

 Pakistan?s parliament passed a law last month that allowed Musharraf to retain both positions, giving early warning that he was unlikely to leave the army, infuriating Islamist and other Opposition parties.

 The MMA held two rallies last week as part of a campaign to force Musharraf to quit as army chief and was set to hold another on Sunday in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, near Islamabad.

 Raza Rabbani, a central leader of the Pakistan People?s Party of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, said Musharraf?s decision would ?increase political instability in the country?.

 ?Democracy is going back to the back burner. Democratic institutions will now become more and more redundant,? he added.

 But political analysts say the Opposition protests are unlikely to pose a challenge to Musharraf?s rule given the parliamentary majority of the pro-military ruling party and its allies.

 Musharraf has survived at least three assassination attempts ? two last December ? which security officials blamed on extremists incensed by Musharraf?s US ties.

 Leader sorry for Liverpool grief slur

 London, Oct. 20 (Reuters): A flamboyant British politician ate humble pie today when he apologised to an entire city over a magazine article which said Liverpool revelled in grief after the beheading in Iraq of a local-born hostage.

 Contrite Conservative parliamentarian Boris Johnson went to the northern port city to apologise for the Spectator magazine piece which said Liverpudlians enjoyed wallowing in ?victim status?.

 A debate about public displays of grief has been rumbling on in Britain since criticism of the widespread mourning after Princess Diana?s death in 1997. The piece about Liverpool appeared in the influential niche magazine, which Johnson edits, shortly after British engineer Ken Bigley was beheaded by Iraqi militants.

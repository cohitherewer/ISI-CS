 Moss gathers price

 WILL BENNETT

 London, Oct. 29: A nude portrait of the model Kate Moss by the artist Lucian Freud, painted while she was pregnant, is expected to fetch up to ?3.5 million when it is auctioned by Christie?s in London.

 The picture, which Freud called Naked Portrait 2002 without mentioning Moss? name, is the result of an extraordinary series of late-night sittings in London when the model was expecting her first baby two years ago.

 Freud, who is now 81, used to meet her at the Marquee restaurant in South Kensington and they then drove in his Bentley to his home in Holland Park where she sat for him until the early hours of the morning.

 Naked Portrait 2002 was sold to an overseas private collector, thought to be an American, by the leading New York art dealer Bill Acquavella, who represents Freud, shortly after it was completed.

 Now the collector has decided to sell the painting at Christie?s on February 9 and specialists at the auction house have given it a pre-sale estimate of ?2.5 million to ?3.5 million.

 This raises the intriguing possibility that the bidders at Christie?s could include Moss, who is thought to be worth about ?15 million and who was reportedly keen to buy it two years ago. ?It would be lovely if she was one of the bidders, it would be really nice for her to own it,? said Pilar Ordovas, an associate director of Christie?s post-war and contemporary art department, yesterday.

 Although Christie?s declined to say why the owner of the painting is selling it so quickly, the reasons are not hard to guess. The market for modern art is extremely strong.

 The current record for a Freud painting is ?5.8 million and, although Naked Portrait 2002 may not beat that, the fact that the subject is an internationally known model may push the price above Christie?s estimate. Freud rarely paints celebrities, although his subjects have included the Queen and Jerry Hall, former wife of the Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick Jagger, and there may be tremendous competition for the portrait.

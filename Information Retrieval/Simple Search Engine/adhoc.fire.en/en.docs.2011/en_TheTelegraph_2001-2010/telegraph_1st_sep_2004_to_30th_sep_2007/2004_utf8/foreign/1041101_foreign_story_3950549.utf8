 Tantrum troubles

 London, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Pop star Elton John says he doesn?t mean to throw tantrums ? it just comes with the territory of being creative.

 He told Britain?s Sunday Times magazine that his behaviour had changed since beating drug and alcohol addictions 14 years ago, yet ?the rage and the temper are still there ... but it?s part of being creative?.

 John, 57, said he was working to rein in his temper. ?I don?t seem to have anger ? I have rage. There are still times, especially when I?m tired, when the bad temper and the irrationality come out. And I hate that. Because I?m trying to change it.?

 The 30-year veteran of the music business also said he has grown weary of the industry?s excess. ?People slag me off because I?m a larger-than-life character, and that?s part of my thing from the past. ?I?m not happy being in the limelight much. I don?t want to be at every party. I used to love it. I hate it now. My life?s changed.?

 Cash bench

 San Antonio, Texas (Reuters): The first 

 wife of late singing legend Johnny Cash wants a bench where 

 he carved their names 53 years ago, but the city of San 

 Antonio will keep it. Vivian Distin, 71, asked if she could 

 have the log bench after finding it two weeks ago in the 

 same place along the San Antonio Riverwalk where they sat 

 in 1951, Ron Smudy of the city?s parks department said.

 Cool carnival

 Soweto, South Africa (Reuters): A palm-fringed desert island came to South Africa?s most famous township at the weekend, bringing tonnes of white sand and live music to thousands of revellers too poor for a real holiday. Throngs of young South Africans donned beachwear and sunhats at the Summer Spice beach carnival in Soweto, that is better known for political unrest than sun, sand and exotic cocktails. ?Holidays here are expensive and most people have never been to the beach, so it?s cool to be able to put on our holiday clothes and party,? said Thandeka Rithelezi, from behind a pair of over-sized shades. As well as sand, the festival brought beach soccer, volleyball and thatched huts selling brightly coloured cocktails to Soweto, once the home of former President Nelson Mandela.

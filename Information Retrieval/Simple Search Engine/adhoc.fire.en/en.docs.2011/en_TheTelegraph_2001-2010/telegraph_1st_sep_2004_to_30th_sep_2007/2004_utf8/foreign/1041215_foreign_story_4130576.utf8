 China grows too big for UN food bowl

 Beijing, Dec. 14 (Reuters): The UN World Food Programme will halt donations to China by the end of next year as the world?s seventh-largest economy boosts its own assistance abroad, WFP chief James Morris said today.

 China?s graduation from WFP food aid after 25 years is a milestone in its development and reforms, including a decade or so of soaring economic growth which has lifted 300 million Chinese out of poverty.

 ?At the end of 2005, we will no longer be an active, operating programme in China. China will no longer need us,? Morris said. ?When I look at the serious humanitarian needs around the world, there are places that need us much more than China does.?

 China, which was supporting WFP operations this year to the tune of $25 million, told Morris it would increase support of the WFP next year.

 ?The commitment was to do more,? Morris said. ?I did not ask for specifics.?

 China has had more experience moving people out of hunger and poverty than any country in history, he said.

 ?I?m hopeful that China will partner with the World Food Programme to help us do more to take advantage of the strength they have, the experience to address these tough issues elsewhere.?

 China suffered possibly the world?s most devastating famine after Chairman Mao Zedong?s Great Leap Forward campaign of the late 1950s tried to use communist fervour to modernise China.

 The movement brought economic ruin and an estimated 30 million people died of hunger.

 Although the WFP?s plan to scale back its aid to China was not new, Morris? five-day visit to China coincided with comments from Japanese foreign minister Nobutaka Machimura that Tokyo would soon review its programme of economic aid to its giant neighbour.

 Machimura said last month that Japan should stop giving official development assistance to Beijing in the near future due to China?s robust economic growth.

 China receives aid from various quarters, but many have questioned its spending priorities, including an aggressive manned spaceflight programme.

 Morris said he expected that many of the programmes the WFP is engaged in in China would continue under Chinese leadership once the WFP pulled out.

 ?I am here to say thank you for growing support from China,? he said. ?We?ve had good conversations about how we expand our work together going forward.?

 Morris met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and foreign minister Li Zhaoxing during his trip. He also visited the impoverished western province of Gansu. 

 The WFP has also asked China, North Korea?s closest ally, to consider donating to its isolated communist neighbour via the World Food Programme, which supports six million people there, including four million women and children, Morris said.

 ?China?s involvement with the World Food Programme in North Korea would be a very powerful message,? Morris said.

 ?I have asked for China to help us in North Korea. They understand the importance of the issue and they understand my feelings.?

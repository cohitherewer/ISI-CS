 Jeanne?s turn to hit Florida

 Fort Pierce, Florida, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Hurricane Jeanne peeled off roofs, snapped power lines and left large swathes of coastline knee-deep in sea and rain water today as it ploughed through parts of Florida already scarred by Hurricane Frances three weeks ago.

 Tree limbs and debris, including mattresses torn out of mobile homes, flowed through flooded streets along the Atlantic shore and more than 2 million people were left without electricity as Jeanne ? a record fourth hurricane strike for the state in one storm season ? moved inland.

 At least two people were reported killed ? a man electrocuted by a fallen power line in Miami and a truck driver crushed when ferocious winds flipped his cab ? but there was no official confirmation yet of the fatalities.

 Search and rescue teams will start moving out when the wind and rain die down to areas around the city of Stuart, where Jeanne made landfall at midnight with 192 kph winds, said Florida emergency coordinator Mike DeLorenzo.

 Up to 3 million of Florida?s 17 million people had been urged to evacuate trailer parks, islands and flood-prone areas, but many, emboldened by having survived Frances or weary after six weeks of hurricane alerts, decided to ride it out at home. ?Today the focus is on life and death,? DeLorenzo said. ?We need to get in there and find out what the situation is as soon as we can.?

 By 1500 GMT, Jeanne had weakened as it moved through central Florida and was 50 km east-southeast of Tampa. Its winds had dropped to 122 kph ? on the verge of being downgraded to a tropical storm.

 In its wake, winds, torrential rain and pounding waves left a trail of devastation in areas that had little time to recover after being slammed by Hurricane Frances on September 5, and where many damaged homes had been protected from the elements by little more than blue tarpaulin sheets.

 At the height of the storm, 300 people with special needs, such as the elderly or infirm, had to be evacuated from an emergency shelter in Brevard County after Jeanne began to rip off the roof, said a spokeswoman for the county?s emergency management agency.

 Stuart Mayor Jeff Krauskopf said a hospital lost half its roof but the 50 patients inside were safe. He said the howling of the wind outside his house was hellish during the night.

 Laureate?s absence mars Nobel prize party

 Stockholm, Dec. 10 (Reuters): Scientists and economists from the US, Israel and Norway received their Nobel prizes today at a ceremony marked by the conspicuous absence of literature laureate Elfriede Jelinek of Austria.

 Kenyan Wangari Maathai, the 2004 Nobel peace laureate, received her prize in Oslo, becoming the seventh African and the first African woman to win that award.

 Jelinek, a feminist author who suffers from a social phobia, declined to receive her prize from Sweden?s King Carl XVI Gustaf saying the public spotlight was ?like a physical violation? for her. She will receive the prize at the Swedish embassy instead.

 The Nobels, widely regarded as the world?s most prestigious accolades in science and literature, have been awarded since 1901. The 2004 prizes are worth 10 million crowns ($1.5 million) each and bring the winners instant fame.

 Israeli chemistry laureate Aaron Ciechanover said earlier in the week in Stockholm that his world had been turned upside down from the moment he was told he had won the prize in October.

 ?I answered the phone and my plain, orderly life was turned into chaos in 10 seconds,? he said.

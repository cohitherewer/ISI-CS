 N. Korea in sanctions war cry

 Tokyo, Dec. 15 (Reuters): North Korea warned Japan today that it would treat economic sanctions as a ?declaration of war? and threatened to try to exclude Tokyo from six-party talks on Pyongyang?s nuclear arms programmes.

 Calls are growing from the Japanese public and politicians for the government to impose sanctions on North Korea after Tokyo said bones Pyongyang had identified as those of Japanese it had kidnapped were from other people.

 ?If sanctions are applied against the DPRK (North Korea) due to the moves of the ultra-Right forces (in Japan), we will regard it as a declaration of war against our country and promptly react to the action by an effective physical method,? a spokesperson for North Korea?s foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo.

 North Korea handed over the bones at talks in Pyongyang in November, saying they were the remains of Megumi Yokota and Kaoru Matsuki, two of 13 Japanese who Pyongyang has admitted abducting in the 1970s and 1980s to teach its spies about Japan.

 Japan, which has no diplomatic ties with North Korea, lodged a protest with Pyongyang and demanded clarification on the fate of 10 Japanese who Tokyo believes were kidnapped. 

 North Korea has said eight of the 10 are dead and two others unaccounted for.

 North Korea?s spokesperson said it was ?unimaginable? that the bones handed over by Yokota?s North Korean husband were not hers.

 The North admitted in 2002 to kidnapping the 13 Japanese, and Japan believes another two were also abducted.

 Five have returned to Japan.

 Pyongyang has said in the past that any imposition of sanctions by Japan would be tantamount to a declaration of war.

 A hefty majority of Japanese citizens favour economic sanctions on North Korea, media polls have shown.

 However, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has taken a cautious stance, apparently for fear of jeopardising the six-party process.

 ?We must find out where their real intention lies,? Koizumi said when asked about North Korea?s remarks.

 A Japanese foreign ministry official said today that the six-party talks among the two Koreas, the US, Japan, China and Russia were unlikely to be held before President George W. Bush was sworn in for a second term on January 20 and might be delayed until March, Japanese media reported.

 South Korea, meanwhile, said that sanctions were not a good option. ?I would like to repeat that it is desirable to make real progress through peaceful dialogue by making North Korea join the dialogue table rather than sanctions or blockade,? South Korean foreign minister Ban Ki-moon told a news conference.

 North Korea?s spokesperson said Pyongyang might call for Japan to be excluded from the talks on its nuclear programmes, which also involve the two Koreas, China, Russia and the US.

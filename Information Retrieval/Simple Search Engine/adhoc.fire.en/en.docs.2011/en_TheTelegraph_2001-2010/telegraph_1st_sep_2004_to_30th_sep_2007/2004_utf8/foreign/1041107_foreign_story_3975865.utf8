 Universe to last for 26 billion yrs, says study

New York, Nov. 6 (PTI): The universe will last 

for another 26 billion years and not collapse in a ?big crunch? within 11 billion 

years from now as predicted earlier, a new study has found. 

 Relying on the theory of ?dark energy? ? an unseen force counteracting the pull of gravity ? astrophysicists have come to the conclusion that the universe is expanding faster than thought.

 Andrei Linde of Stanford University leads a team who previously predicted that the universe might end as soon as 11 billion years from now. But their latest research into dark energy gives us a stay on the end, Nature magazine reports.

 The team?s new calculation relies on recent observations from the Hubble space telescope, which has found several supernovae that are moving away from us faster than any others seen before, implying that the universe is expanding faster than we thought. Linde, the magazine says, concludes that the universe is likely to last for almost twice as long again as it has already existed, before collapsing back on itself in a ?big crunch?. 

 Linde?s model, relies on calculations made by Yun Wang, a cosmologist from the University of Oklahoma. 

 ?If we assume this model, the universe will probably be safe for the next 24 billion years,? Linde said.

 Many models describe dark energy as a negative pressure on the universe, unlike a gas. The pressure of dark energy actually increases as it expands. 

 But dark energy has never been directly seen. ?Even well educated guesses about dark energy are deeply problematic,? the magazine quotes Robert Caldwell, an astrophysicist from Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, as saying.

 Physicists, the report says, are still divided about the fate of the universe. Some say it will keep expanding forever, whereas others believe that at some point in the future it will begin to contract and ultimately collapse in a big crunch. ?All bets are off in terms of predicting the fate of the universe,? says Caldwell, who has previously suggested that the universe could ultimately end in a ?big rip? as it expands into infinity.

 But infinite expansion is just a cosmic illusion, according to Linde?s calculations. ?The duration of that expansion will ultimately be finite,? he says.

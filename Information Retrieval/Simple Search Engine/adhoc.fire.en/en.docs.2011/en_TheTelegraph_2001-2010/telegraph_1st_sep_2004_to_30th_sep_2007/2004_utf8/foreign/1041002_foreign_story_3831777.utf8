 London, Oct. 1 (Reuters): Britain?s Tony Blair underwent heart treatment today after a surprise pledge to serve a full third term if he wins an election expected next year.

 Designed to dampen speculation over his future, Blair?s announcement had the opposite effect, sparking frenzied talk of how long he can go on and whether he was blocking his number 2, finance minister Gordon Brown, from taking over.

 Britain?s Sky TV reported at midday the operation for recurrent heart palpitations had been successfully completed and that Blair was ?doing well?. Neither Blair?s Downing Street office nor London?s Hammersmith Hospital would confirm that. Before going in, Blair, 51, called the procedure ?routine? and vowed to back at work in days. ?I feel fine,? he said smiling en route to hospital.

 Blair first had heart palpitations late last year and suffered a ?mild recurrence? in August, his office said.

 The need for another operation has shocked Britons, many of whom blame his health problems on the gruelling routine of his job and especially the criticism he has taken over the Iraq war.

 But it was Blair?s accompanying announcement ? that he wanted to serve a full third term but would not contemplate a fourth ? that really sent UK politicians into a spin and prompted analysts to wonder whether he was unintentionally sparking a war to succeed him. Blair is expected to call, and win, an election in May 2005.

 ?Do I wish to serve a full term? The answer to that is ?yes.? Do I want to go on and on and on? The answer to that is ?no,?? Blair said.

 The announcement, on the final day of his Labour Party conference, seemed to rule out an early handover to Brown, widely viewed as the heir-apparent.

 With a full third term possibly taking Blair to 2009, many wondered if that could be too long for Brown, 53, to wait. Some Brown supporters say Blair has reneged on a supposed deal made back in 1994 for a handover of power in a second term. Analysts said a leadership race was now firmly on the horizon, with Blair losing authority in a third term. 

 ?I think he would become a progressively lamer duck,? said analyst Peter Kellner. 

 Financial markets showed no immediate reaction to Blair?s operation, though foreign exchange dealers said it added to already negative sentiment towards the pound today.

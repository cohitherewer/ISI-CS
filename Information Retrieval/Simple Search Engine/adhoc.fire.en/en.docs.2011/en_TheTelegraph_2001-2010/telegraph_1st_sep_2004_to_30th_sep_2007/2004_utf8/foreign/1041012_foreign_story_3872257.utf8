 US frees Saudi after three years

 Riyadh, Oct. 11 (Reuters): A Saudi-American citizen captured in Afghanistan and held in US military jail without charges for nearly three years was flown home to Saudi Arabia today.

 US-born Yaser Hamdi, accused of fighting for the Taliban militia that harboured Osama bin Laden, landed shortly after 0900 GMT. His return was delayed 10 days because of Saudi concerns over the US conditions for setting him free. 

 ?We are happy that he is home. He is happy that he is home,? Yaser?s father Essam said by telephone from his home in Saudi Arabia?s Gulf port of Jubail. ?He is not a Taliban or anything like that?.

 The transfer of American-born, Saudi-raised Hamdi ends a case that led to a landmark US Supreme Court ruling that Americans held in the US as ?enemy combatants? must be able to contest their detention. 

 Hamdi had been in US military jail since he was seized on the battlefield in Afghanistan in November 2001 and accused of fighting for the Taliban.

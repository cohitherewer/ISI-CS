 Gates top target of spammers

 Singapore, Nov. 18 (Reuters): E-mail users inundated with ?spam? messages have reason to hope Microsoft Corp will develop better tools for tackling the problem: Bill Gates is suffering more than anyone.

 Microsoft chairman Gates gets four million e-mails a day and is probably the most ?spammed? person in the world, his chief executive officer Steve Ballmer said today.

 However, only a few junk e-mails gets through to Gates? inbox thanks to anti-spam technology that filters his messages, Ballmer said at a Microsoft event in Singapore.

 Ballmer was speaking at the start of a two-day Microsoft-sponsored Asia leadership forum in Singapore.

 ?There are two people who probably are the number one spam recipients in the world,? Ballmer said, referring to Gates and himself.

 ?Bill Gates (is number one) because he is Bill Gates. Bill literally receives four million pieces of e-mail per day, most of it spam. And so we have special technology that just filters (spam). Literally there?s a whole department almost that takes care of it.? Ballmer said he was ?probably also amongst the most spammed people in the world? because he gave out his e-mail address ? stevebmicrosoft.com.

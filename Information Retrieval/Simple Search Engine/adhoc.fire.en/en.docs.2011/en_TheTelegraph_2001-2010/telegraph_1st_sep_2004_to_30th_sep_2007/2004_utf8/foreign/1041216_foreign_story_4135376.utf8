 Make a will for when you?re ill

 London, Dec. 15 (AP): British lawmakers backed a proposal to let people write living wills ? documents that set out what treatment they want if they become seriously ill and lose the capacity to make a decision.

 House of Commons legislators yesterday voted 354-118 to approve the bill, which will now go to the House of Lords for consideration. After hours of debate, lawmakers also rejected two amendments that would have placed restrictions on the bill, which critics fear will legalise euthanasia.

 The government says the mental capacity bill, which would allow people to instruct that medical treatment be withheld, merely simplifies the current law. Ninety-one lawmakers signed a petition saying the bill should specifically prevent decisions to bring about death.

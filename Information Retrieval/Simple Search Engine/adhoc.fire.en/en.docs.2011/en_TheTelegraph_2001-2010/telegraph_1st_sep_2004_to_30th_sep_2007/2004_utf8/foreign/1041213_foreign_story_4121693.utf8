 Berlin ?echo? in Ukraine

 Vienna, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Ukrainian opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko, speaking after doctors said he was poisoned with dioxin, today likened his country?s upheaval over a rigged election to the fall of Soviet rule or the Berlin wall.

 Yushchenko brought tens of thousands of supporters into Kiev?s streets in support of his allegations that the November 21 run-off, in which Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich was declared the winner, was subject to mass fraud. 

 The Supreme Court has since annulled the result and ordered a new vote on December 26.

 ?We had not seen anything like that for the past 100 years. I believe it would be appropriate to compare this to the fall of the Soviet Union or the fall of the Berlin wall,? Yushchenko told a news conference at the clinic where he was treated. 

 Doctors at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic said yesterday that Yushchenko had been the victim of dioxin poisoning but were unable to say whether it was the result of a deliberate act.

 Obliged to stop campaigning for a time, Yushchenko said it was part of a plot to kill him. His face remains bloated and pocked, though he says he is now in good physical shape.

 With his wife acting as translator, Yushchenko said the protests backing his allegations of vote-rigging had produced ?a different country, a different nation. ?I am truly happy that we were able to raise the nation. What we see were not merely voters, but citizens able to defend their rights.?

 After central Kiev was brought to a virtual halt for more than two weeks, he predicted that ?the regime that was in place for 14 years in Ukraine is now living its last days?.

 Ukraine played a key role in the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, two years after the fall of the Berlin wall. A referendum on independence, backed nine to one by voters, was followed within weeks by the dissolution of the Soviet state.

 Dr Michael Zimpfer, president of the Rudolfinerhaus clinic, said if the poisoning had been deliberate, dioxin may have been chosen because of the difficulty of detecting it.

 ?Until recently there was no blood test for dioxin. This may be one of the reasons why this kind of poison, if it was a criminal act, was chosen,? he said. ?We detected blood levels (of dioxin) at least 1,000-fold above tolerable levels.?

 Previous cases, he said, had involved inhaled dioxin ? rather than orally ingested dioxin as was the case with Yushchenko. Yesterday doctors completed a blood test.

 ?This was our final proof,? he said. ?We had the clinical problems of the patient, the tissue biopsy and now the blood test. This case is closed,? he added.

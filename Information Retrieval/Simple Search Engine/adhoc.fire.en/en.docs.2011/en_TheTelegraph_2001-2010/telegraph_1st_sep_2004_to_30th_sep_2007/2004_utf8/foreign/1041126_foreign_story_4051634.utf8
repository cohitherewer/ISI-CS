 Golden guitar

 New York, Nov. 25 (Reuters): Rock ?? roll fans with deep pockets can buy a Beatles guitar or a mugshot of the pop star formerly known as Cat Stevens at what Christie?s said yesterday was its biggest auction of show business memorabilia.

 The Gibson SG electric guitar, played by George Harrison from 1966-1969, is the star attraction among over 400 lots, ranging from Britney Spears? book report to a handwritten 1991 letter from the late Kurt Cobain to Courtney Love.

 The guitar, expected to fetch around $500,000, was used while recording the Beatles? Revolver album and in two Beatles films Paperback Writer and Rain. John Lennon also played it on what is commonly known as The White Album.

 The Beatles guitar was recently rediscovered and has been on loan to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame since 2002. Madonna fans can bid on the veil worn by the pop icon in her Like a Virgin video, estimated to bring as much as $2,500.

 Kabul, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Hamid Karzai was sworn in as Afghanistan?s first popularly elected President today, promising to bring peace to the war-torn nation and end the economy?s dependence on narcotics.

 Two of the men most responsible for easing him into power, US vice-president Dick Cheney and secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld, were among those watching as Karzai placed his hand on the Quran to take an oath of allegiance in the heavily fortified presidential palace in Kabul.

 The inauguration passed off peacefully despite threats by guerrillas from the former Taliban regime that they would disrupt Karzai?s investiture, the culmination of his victory in Afghanistan?s first democratic presidential poll on October 9.

 ?With international cooperation we can root out terrorism from Afghanistan,? Karzai, wearing a black lambskin hat and traditional cape, or chapan, said in an acceptance speech, broadcast live.

 ?The relationship between terrorism and narcotics however and the threat of extremism in the region... is a source of continued concern,? he said, referring to worries over Afghanistan being the world?s main supplier of heroin.

 He vowed that disarming private militias, fighting the drugs trade, stamping out corruption and forging national unity among Afghanistan?s different ethnic groups and tribes would be his goals over the next five years.

 At least six Taliban fighters and three soldiers were killed in Afghanistan?s southeastern province of Khost in a Taliban raid late yesterday, a provincial military official said.

 Cheney and Rumsfeld are two of the most hawkish members of President George W. Bush?s cabinet and key architects of the Washington-backed war that overthrew the Taliban in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US. Washington chose Karzai as interim leader of the war-torn nation, and he was later endorsed by a tribal council.

 But the election showed that Afghans now regard Karzai as their best hope for international guarantees of security and funds to rebuild an economy shattered by conflict, including occupation by the Soviet Union, civil war, Taliban invasions and then by US-backed forces.

 ?Whatever challenges may come, the people of Afghanistan can count on the friendship and support of the people of the United States,? Cheney said during a joint press conference minutes before the inauguration.

 Cheney and Rumsfeld both addressed U.S. troops earlier during a visit to Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul.

 ?Our goal is not to stay here, but to come and do the job and leave it a lot better than we found it,? Rumsfeld said.

 U.S. forces in Afghanistan are still hunting for Osama bin Laden, mastermind of al Qaedas attacks on U.S. cities on Sept. 11, 2001, along with the remnants of the Taliban militia which once protected him.

 Representatives from 27 foreign delegations attended Karzais oath-taking, including U.. Secretary-General Kofi Annans special adviser Lakhdar Brahimi, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavron, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, Pakistans Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao and the presidents of neighbouring Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.

 During the ceremony, Karzai was seated alongside ageing former king Zahir Shah, who remained in exile after being ousted in 1973, and returned home only after the fall of the Taliban.

 Security was extremely tight at the palace, with large numbers of Afghan and U.S.-led troops deployed and several key roads in Kabul closed to traffic.

 NATO-led peacekeepers drove armoured vehicles through Kabuls frosty streets in pre-dawn patrols, helicopters hovered overhead, and rapid reaction forces were put on alert.

 A measure of the worry about militant attacks was that VIPs were asked to supply their blood groups as a precaution.

 But the only reported incident was a Taliban attack on Afghan military posts on Monday night in Khosts rugged Ali Sher district near the Pakistan border ? an area that was a bin Laden stronghold during the Talibans rule.

 Kheyal Baaz Sherzai, the Afghan military commander in the area, said a large force of Taliban militants armed with mortars and heavy machine guns took part in the raid, but they fled towards the border once a counter offensive was mounted.

 Militant-related violence across Afghanistan since August last year has killed more than 1,000 people and has included several bomb and rocket attacks in Kabul.

 The violence has persisted despite the presence of an 18,000 strong U.S. force, and 8,400 NATO-led peacekeepers mainly based in Kabul.

 After Tuesdays ceremony, all eyes will be on who Karzai picks for his new cabinet expected to be announced next week.

 Its make-up is seen as crucial to whether the country can now chart a course of reform away from weak central control, regional warlords and an economy dominated by the drugs trade. (Additional reporting by Tabussum Zakaria at BAGRAM and Kamal Sadaat in KHOST)

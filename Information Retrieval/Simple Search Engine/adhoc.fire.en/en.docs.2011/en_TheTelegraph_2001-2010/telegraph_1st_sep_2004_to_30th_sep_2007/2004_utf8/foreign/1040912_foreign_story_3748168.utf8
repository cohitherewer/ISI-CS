 US soldier pleads guilty to abuse

 Baghdad, Sept. 11 (Reuters): The first American military intelligence soldier to be court-martialled over the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal was sentenced today to eight months in jail, a reduction in rank and a bad-conduct discharge.

 Specialist Armin Cruz, a military intelligence analyst, had pleaded guilty to maltreatment and conspiracy to maltreat detainees. The court martial accepted his guilty plea. Cruz, 24, is the eighth person to be indicted for abusing Iraqi detainees in an affair which provoked worldwide outrage when it broke in April. He was the second to be sentenced.

 In emotional testimony before being sentenced, Cruz told the court he took full responsibility for his actions, but he offered few explanations. ?I knew my actions were wrong,? he said. ?There?s no way to justify it.?

 As the first intelligence operative to be tried, Cruz?s case is significant because the Pentagon has said the abuse was the work of a few bad military police acting on their own accord, and not on the orders of intelligence officers.

 Defence lawyers for some indicted soldiers say intelligence officers ordered military police to ?soften up? prisoners ahead of interrogation, and that senior commanders knew about or even sanctioned the abuse.

 Stephen Karns, Cruz?s civilian lawyer, described his client as a ?war hero? who acted out of character in Abu Ghraib because he was suffering from traumatic stress following a mortar attack which blew up a close colleague.

 Karns said he was disappointed with the bad-conduct discharge and would appeal. ?I believe he can still make contributions to the US army... I think the army is losing a lot in this soldier.?

 In a report into the abuse by US army Major General George Fay issued last month, Cruz was identified as having taken part in the mistreatment of three prisoners at the jail. A photograph taken on October 25, 2003, showed Cruz and two other intelligence soldiers standing in the background as military police abused three prisoners in the foreground.

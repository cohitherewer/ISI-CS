 Jiang backs Hu, chants military unity mantra

 Jiang Zemin: Red salute

 Beijing, Sept. 20 (Reuters): China?s freshly retired military leader Jiang Zemin threw his weight behind his successor Hu Jintao today and advised the armed forces never to renounce the use of force to reclaim Taiwan.

 The comments came a day after China announced that the partys Central Committee had accepted Jiangs retirement as chairman of the commission, his last formal position of power, and installed president and party chief Hu in his place.

 ?Comrade Jintaos taking over as Central Military Commission chairman is completely up to standards,? state TV quoted Jiang as saying at an expanded meeting of the commission today.

 The system of one person acting as party chief, state president and head of the Central Military Commission ?is not only necessary in such a large party and large nation as ours, it is also the most appropriate method?, he said.

 Jiang, shown on China Central Television (CCTV) wearing a military uniform without insignia, said the military should never drop the threat of force to reclaim Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of Chinas sovereign territory. ?On the Taiwan issue, we should, with the greatest sincerity, make the greatest efforts to realise the peaceful unification. But we can never promise to give up the use of force. This is a very important political choice,? he said.

 Jiang and Hu both called for unity in the military.

 ?If the military is internally united, and the military and the people are united, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome,? he said.

 Hu, also wearing a green ?Mao suit?, said: ?Unity is strength. Unity is victory.?

 ?To complete our militarys glorious historical mission and realise our militarys strategic goals, we must unite more closely and further solidify the current favourable situation of unity and energetic advancement,? Hu added.

 China watchers often interpret calls for unity as a sign that there are major differences within the leadership. Prior to Jiangs retirement, many analysts said he was engaged in a power struggle with Hu. The transfer of military power at a party plenum that ended yesterday completed a leadership transition that began two years ago at the 16th Party Congress when Hu succeeded Jiang as party general secretary.

 Alliance partners deal blow to Nato?s Iraq mission

 Washington, Nov. 20 (Reuters): In an unprecedented departure from Nato practice, several alliance members will not allow their own officers assigned to Nato?s two command centres to participate in its first collective postwar mission in Iraq, a senior US official said on Friday.

 The Bush administration has hailed Nato?s new plan to train some 1,000 Iraqi army officers annually as an important signal of growing trans-Atlantic consensus after bitter alliance divisions in the run-up to the U.S.-led Iraq war.

 But the refusal of France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg to let their officers assigned to Nato?s command centres in Mons, Belgium, and Norfolk, Virginia, be part of that effort underscores that serious differences persist.

 ?Some of the countries have said they?re not going to allow their officers stationed in those Nato commands who come under the Nato structure itself to serve in Iraq. A number of us have been surprised by that,? said the senior US official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.

 ?I believe it?s the first time that this kind of thing has happened,? he said.

 He said it is one thing for NATO countries to decide not to contribute their own national forces to an alliance mission.

 ?But when you send a colonel to Norfolk for three years from any country, that colonel comes under the command of the (Nato) supreme allied commander in Norfolk ...One would think he would be able to deploy those officers as he wanted to,? the official said.

 The US is concerned about the precedent and ?there is a continuing disagreement? within Nato, he said.

 Still, he stressed, even holdout countries approved the mission by consensus and are committed to sharing costs.

 Publicly, the US focused on the positive.

 ?I think it does not detract from the important signal that achieving consensus on this mission represents and on the kind of cooperation that we?ve seen to actually deal with the logistics and get it under way,? state department deputy spokesperson Adam Ereli told a news briefing.

 The 26-member alliance agreed to set up the new training scheme at a summit in Istanbul in June after overcoming French and other countries? misgivings over whether Nato should have a role in Iraq at all.

 Rising crisis over Arafat

 - Palestinians and Israelis at odds over leader?s health

 Yasser Arafat

 Clamart (France), Nov. 4 (Agencies): Confusion reigned today about the fate of ailing Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat amid conflicting reports about whether he was dead or alive.

 In the West Bank, an official said some of the Palestinian president?s powers were handed over to his Prime Minister. ?Mr Arafat has not died,? said a spokesman for the French military hospital where Arafat, 75, has been treated since last week. An Israeli media report said earlier he was brain dead.

 Palestinian security chiefs were called to an emergency meeting at Arafat?s headquarters in Ramallah as concern mounted in the West Bank over the man who embodies the Palestinian struggle for statehood. 

 In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie said officials in France had told him the situation was unhanged. ?They say the situation is still as it was. He is still in the intensive care unit.?

 Qurie assumed some of Arafat?s powers over security and financing today, a senior official said.

 A senior Palestinian official in France said earlier that the Palestinian leader went into a coma overnight and was lying unconscious and in a critical condition. Doctors carrying out tests on Arafat since he was airlifted to France last Friday still did not know what was wrong with him, although they have ruled out leukaemia, aides said.

 ?God bless his soul?

 Asked about the reports that Arafat had been declared clinically dead, President George Bush said: ?My first reaction is God bless his soul.?

 ?And my second reaction is we will continue to work for a free Palestinian state that?s at peace with Israel.?

 The slide into illness of the former guerrilla leader, who has dominated the Palestinian scene for four decades, has raised fears of chaos among Palestinians locked in a four-year-old uprising.

 Arafat has named no successor since emerging from exile under interim peace accords with Israel in the early 1990s.

 Arafat?s immune system appeared weak as his health, which had at first stabilised after he arrived at the hospital, suddenly deteriorated on Wednesday, the aides said.

 He was transferred to the intensive care unit yesterday at 1600 GMT). ?He has no immunity whatsoever,? one aide said, adding he slipped into the coma around 2 am (0100 GMT) today.

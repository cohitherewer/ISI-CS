 Fine Print

 Hungary Houdini

 Budapest, Sept. 1 (Reuters): David Merlini, the man dubbed Hungarys Houdini, was encased in a four tonne concrete block and lowered by crane into the Danube river from Budapests chain bridge on Tuesday. He promptly escaped.

 less than 15 minutes he was out of the block, said one eyewitness, reporting Merlini was last seen suspended from a helicopter.

 Earlier in the day Merlini was placed in a glass container into which concrete was poured and allowed to set.

 Hundreds of people watched images from underwater cameras showing his escape but the murky pictures gave little away about how he did it.

 Merlini has sought to emulate the American stuntman Harry Houdini, spending 33 hours frozen in a straight jacket on one occasion and welded in a steel coffin at the bottom of the Danube on another.

 He has said Tuesdays stunt was aimed at promoting the image of Hungary as a new member of the European Union after it joined in May. 

 Spill drill

 Stockholm (Reuters): Coast Guards from 

 Scandinavia and the Baltic delighted seagulls on Wednesday 

 by using popcorn to simulate an oil slick as they carried 

 out an oil-spill emergency drill. The area is permanently 

 on high alert for spills because of intense tanker traffic. 

 Ten cubic metres of popcorn were used of the unsalted 

 and unbuttered variety. The seagulls did not seem to mind, 

 flocking around the oil tanker, nine coastguard vessels 

 and two tugboats taking part in the drill near the Brofjorden 

 refinery on the west coast of Sweden. 

 Doll drive

 Berlin (Reuters): A man caught having sex with a blow-up doll in a busy public shopping arcade had to be physically parted from his rubber lover and escorted away, said police in Stuttgart on Wednesday. The 38-year-old man was caught with his trousers down early on Monday evening after alarmed witnesses alerted the police. It was real, he was caught in mid-action with the doll, said a press spokeswoman. Police said that they had considerable difficulty separating the drunken man from his partner.

 Falluja fight fans Mosul fire

 Falluja, Nov. 11 (Reuters): US troops met dwindling resistance in the battered Iraqi city of Falluja today, but rebels hit back with an armed rampage in Mosul and a car bomb that killed 17 people in a crowded Baghdad street.

 The late morning car bomb in the heart of the Iraqi capital also wounded at least 20, a police source said.

 A Reuters reporter saw four bodies in burned-out cars after the blast near a police patrol in a busy street just off Nasr Square. The bomb devastated a nearby building and littered the street with twisted metal and glass from shattered shop windows.

 The Falluja assault has provoked an upsurge in violence elsewhere in Iraq, as happened in April during an earlier failed US attempt to subdue the country?s most rebellious city.

 US Marines met little resistance in the former insurgent stronghold of Jolan, in northwest Falluja today, firing only one or two mortar rounds as tanks pushed through alleys, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene.

 Jolan, a stronghold for Saddam Hussein loyalists, had seen some of the fiercest fighting of this week?s US-led offensive in the Sunni city, 50 km west of Baghdad.

 ?Things are going, I think, as planned. We?ve got about 70 percent of the city under control,? US General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told CBS television.

 ?There have been hundreds and hundreds of insurgents who have been either killed or captured,? he said.

 But rebels did manage to shoot down two US Cobra helicopters near Falluja, military sources cited by Al Arabiya television said today. It gave no details.

 And while US-led troops fought for the upper hand in Falluja, insurgents in the northern city of Mosul set police stations ablaze, stole weapons and roamed the streets.

 Residents said Iraq?s third largest city seemed to slide out of control as grenade blasts and gunfire rang through empty streets and smoke billowed from two burning police stations.

 Rebels attacked Iraqi national guards controlling a bridge in the city centre, killing five of them, witnesses said.

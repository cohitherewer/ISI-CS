 London, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Britain?s most famous acting dynasty launched a new party yesterday to promote the human rights it says have been abused in the war on terror and fight Prime Minister Tony Blair?s government in next year?s expected election.

 Vanessa and Corin Redgrave inaugurated the Peace and Progress party at a founding conference in London attended by academics, lawyers and human rights workers. ?The atmosphere was very warm, very enthusiastic,? Corin Redgrave said. ?People were very keen on the whole idea.?

 Speakers included his Oscar-winning sister Vanessa and Azmat Begg, whose son Moazzam is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

 The party?s aims state: ?We shall work for a government of Peace And Progress and support all those who share that aim. We shall represent all those whose human rights are threatened or denied, and we shall speak for all who want a country where justice in law, social justice, and human rights are paramount.?

 It comes a day after the UN expressed concern to Britain at parts of an anti-terrorism law which allows ?potentially indefinite detention? of foreigners without trial.

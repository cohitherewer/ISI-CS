 Hawk home hinges on architect nod

 New York, Dec. 14: A baronial 

 Fifth Avenue co-op building at the centre of an uproar over 

 its destruction of a red-tailed hawk?s nest last week agreed 

 yesterday to try to help the hawks rebuild in the same spot 

 overlooking Central Park ? if an architect approves.

 ?We had a very constructive meeting,? 

 said John Flicker, president of the National Audubon Society, 

 who, along with three Audubon colleagues and city and state 

 officials, met for 90 minutes with Richard Cohen, president 

 of the co-op?s board, its management agent and a building 

 engineer.

 ?It?s a much better situation 

 today than it was yesterday,? said Mary Tyler Moore, a resident 

 of the co-op, at 927 Fifth Avenue, who has joined bird lovers 

 and naturalists from across the nation in protesting the 

 hawks? eviction.

 Still, the negotiations yesterday, 

 part of which took place on the roof of the 74th Street 

 co-op as the most famous of the Fifth Avenue hawks, Pale 

 Male, circled overhead, provided only a first step toward 

 ending a conflict that some say requires speedy resolution.

 The saga of Pale Male and his 

 mate, Lola, who have fed happily on pigeons and rats in 

 Central Park, reproduced prodigiously from their roost above 

 a 12th-story cornice, and ultimately captivated the attention 

 of much of the city, came amid unavoidable questions of 

 what the hawks themselves will choose to do.

 ?We haven?t been able to talk 

 to the hawks, and they may have their own plans,? said Adrian 

 Benepe, the city?s commissioner of parks, who attended the 

 meeting yesterday at 927 Fifth Avenue. 

 Flicker said a central question 

 addressed at the meeting yesterday was whether the spikes, 

 which supported the nest, would be restored so Pale Male 

 and Lola could rebuild in the same place, or whether a new 

 platform or box would be constructed and provide a sturdy 

 base for a new nest on the co-op?s roof. Audubon Society 

 officials insisted the spikes be restored, and that anything 

 else would be inadequate. 

 According to Benepe and Flicker, 

 Cohen seemed agreeable to returning the metal spikes to 

 the cornice. But he insisted on consulting the co-op?s architect 

 before making any commitment.

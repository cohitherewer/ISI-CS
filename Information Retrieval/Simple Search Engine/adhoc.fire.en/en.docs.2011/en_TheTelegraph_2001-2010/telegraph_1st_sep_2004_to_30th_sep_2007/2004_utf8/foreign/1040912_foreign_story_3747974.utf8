 Tome brings Bush to book

 George W. Bush: Kitty details

 Los Angeles, Sept. 11 (Reuters): As if the 2004 campaign for the presidency has not been dirty enough ? get ready for a 700-page book by America?s most famous tabloid biographer that alleges illegal drug use and other youthful misdeeds by President George W. Bush.

 More than 700,000 copies of Kitty Kelley?s The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty are set to hit bookstores on Tuesday with the 62-year-old Kelley launching into a series of television interviews starting on Monday with three days on NBC?s Today Show.

 Despite sensational allegations and the heavy-duty publicity accompanying the book, the mainstream US press has been reluctant to delve into the claims, partly because of doubts about Kelley?s reporting and partly because the Republican party has labelled the book fiction. The White House spokesman has called it garbage.

 The doorstop of a book comes out in the middle of a presidential campaign that has distinguished itself for mud-slinging with ugly charges about the Vietnam War service of both Democrat John Kerry and President Bush.

 To have someone like Kelley weigh in with allegations that Bush snorted cocaine at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, while his father was President can cause severe heartburn in editors concerned about campaign coverage being hijacked by sensationalism.

 Kelley is famous for biographies that hold her subjects up to a harsh light. Her works have included the life stories of Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor and Britain?s Queen Elizabeth. Her most notorious biography was on Nancy Reagan in which she claimed that the former First Lady had an affair with Sinatra. That allegation was once front page news. Over the years, it has lost credence.

 ?The story of Kitty Kelley is not about accuracy but of attitude. She starts off hating the people she writes about and hates them all the way through,? said Vanity Fair writer Bob Colacello.

 ?Kitty Kelley generally makes the assumption that negative rumours are true. And in Nancy Reagan?s case, her totally negative portrayal missed the real woman. None of Nancy?s close friends talked to her and she relied on uninformed sources,? said Colacello.

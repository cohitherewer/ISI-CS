 US neglect led to killing, says Allawi

 Baghdad, Oct. 26 (Reuters): Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi today said ?major neglect? by US-led forces led to the murder of 49 Iraqi army recruits by insurgents this weekend.

 ?There was an ugly crime in which a large group of National Guards were martyred,? he told Iraq?s national assembly. ?We believe this issue was the outcome of major neglect by some parts of the multinational (forces).? 

 He did not explain. Al Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility on Sunday for the killing of the unarmed Iraqi soldiers who were dressed in civilian clothes and on their way home on leave.

 Allawi said he had ordered an investigation into the cause of the attack, one of the bloodiest yet against the country?s fledgling security forces.

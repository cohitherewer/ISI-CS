 Iraq polls on January 27

 Baghdad, Nov. 5 (Reuters): Iraq will hold national elections on January 27 to decide its political destiny, vice-president Ibrahim al-Jaafari said today.

 ?Bar a catastrophe, the elections will be held on this date. There is total agreement that they are a must for a stable and sovereign Iraq,? Jaafari, who also heads the Shia al-Dawa party, said.

 ?There is no justification for using violence and killing civilians to reach power. Those who want power can contest the polls,? he said, referring to Sunni insurgents in the city of Falluja facing an impending US offensive.

 Iraq?s election commission set the January 27 date, which is expected to be approved by the cabinet, Jaafari said.

 The elections could bring the Shia majority to power for the first time. That prospect could worry secular Iraqis and the Arab Sunni minority, who have held power since western powers carved Iraq out of the remnants of the Ottoman empire in the 1920s.

 Jaafari said that although Shia religious parties such as Al-Dawa and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq could dominate the elections, any new parliament would function according to national principles.

 ?We want to transcend sectarianism. We are the heirs of Mohammad Baqer al-Sadr, who was the embodiment of Iraq,? he said, referring to his party?s founder.

 Saddam Hussein executed Sadr along with his sister in 1980. Sadr, the uncle of anti-US cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, was a widely respected theologian who advocated democracy and the rule of law.

 Under Iraq?s interim constitution, drafted during the formal US-led occupation after the war, elections must be held by the end of January.

 But the interim government is battling to restore peace and stability to allow free and fair polls. Voters will choose a 275-member parliament, which will draft a permanent constitution. 

 Allawi spectator slur

 Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi secured cash and pledges of help from EU leaders today despite having raised hackles by describing states that opposed the US-led war to oust Saddam Hussein as ?spectators?.

 The EU pledged new funds to support elections due in January. But Allawi?s visit to Brussels was clouded by anger at his jibe and by President Jacques Chirac?s early departure from the summit in what some diplomats said was a snub to Allawi.

 ?I never said Europe was a spectator,? Allawi said referring to remarks made in Rome yesterday.

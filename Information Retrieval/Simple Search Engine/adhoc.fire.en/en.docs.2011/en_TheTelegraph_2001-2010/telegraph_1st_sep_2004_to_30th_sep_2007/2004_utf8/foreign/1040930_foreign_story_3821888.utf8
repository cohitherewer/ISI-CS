 Putin faces ire of 100

 Prague, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Former Czech President Vaclav Havel and some 100 other world figures have signed a petition criticising Russian President Vladimir Putin for using the Beslan school hostage drama to undermine democracy.

 The letter, according to Havel?s office, was sent to the leaders of all EU and Nato countries.

 Hundreds have died in Russia in a recent wave of attacks by Chechen separatists, including over 320 children and adults held hostage in a school in the southern town of Beslan, prompting the Russian leader to add to his already strong powers.

 In the letter, Havel, a perennial Nobel peace prize nominee, and other former and current policy makers warned of Putin?s moves and urged western nations to put themselves ?unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in Russia?.

 ?We are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in Russia,? the letter said. 

 ?Russia?s democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile. Since becoming President in January 2000, Vladimir Putin has made them even weaker.?

 Those to have signed the letter include senior US senators John McCain, a Republican, and Joseph R. Biden Jr, a Democrat, former CIA chief James Woolsey, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt and former US ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke.

 The four-year rule of the former KGB spy, who rose to power on the promise of stability after the tumult that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, has been marked by steady economic growth supported by high oil prices. 

 But Putins critics say that growth has come at a cost.

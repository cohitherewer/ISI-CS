 Iraq trials to kick off with Chemical Ali

 Ali Hassan al-Majid

 Baghdad, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Ali Hassan al-Majid, one of Saddam Hussein?s most feared deputies, better known as ?Chemical Ali?, will be the first leader of the former regime to be tried for war crimes, Iraq?s defence minister said today.

 The trial could begin as early as next week, defence minister Hazim al-Shaalan said through an interpreter, and would certainly start by the middle of January ? days before Iraq is due to hold its first post-Saddam election.

 ?In the next few days we will have the trial of Ali Hassan al-Majid, one of the close followers of Saddam Hussein,? Shaalan announced. ?He will be the first to be tried.?

 Majid, who is accused of some of the worst crimes committed during Saddam?s decades in power, including the gassing of up to 5,000 Kurds in northern Iraq in the late 1980s, is the only one of Saddam?s deputies so far set for trial, Shaalan said.

 Plans for an early trial of Saddam?s aides were announced by interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi yesterday, taking Iraq?s justice ministry and US officials by surprise.

 One Iraqi official suggested Allawi?s announcement was timed to create publicity ahead of the election, since campaigning for the January 30 poll officially began today.

 ?It?s a piece of showmanship, to try to show that something has been achieved before the election,? said the senior government official, who asked not to be identified.

 Allawi announced his election candidacy today.

 Questions have been raised about the trials being rushed, with investigators only beginning to sift through the evidence against Saddam and his deputies and Iraq?s justice system not yet ready for a major trial, with judges recently appointed.

 There are also concerns that Saddam and his 11 top lieutenants, all held at a detention facility on the outskirts of Baghdad for the past year, have not had access to lawyers.

 A large part of the evidence to be used in their trials is expected to come from the many mass graves that have been discovered around the country since the regime was overthrown. But the violence sweeping the country has made it extremely difficult to excavate many of those sites, and fresh ones are still being discovered, including one containing as many as 500 bodies found near Sulaimaniya, in northeast Iraq. 

 While Allawi said yesterday that several figures from the former regime could soon face trial, Shaalan said only Majid, number five on the US military?s 55 most-wanted list, was ready. 

 Karbala blast

 A bomb exploded near the offices of a senior Shia cleric in the Iraqi holy city of Karbala today, killing eight people and wounding 32, police and doctors said.

 One of the wounded was Sheikh Abdul Mehdi al-Karbalai, a cleric regarded as close to Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq?s most influential Shia leader. Hospital sources said he had been hit in the legs and was receiving treatment.

 Raid adds to chaos in Palestine

 Gaza, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Masked gunmen briefly seized the Palestinian governors office in a southern Gaza Strip town today, demanding compensation for Israeli raids in a protest that added to signs of growing lawlessness.

 The territory has been gripped by unprecedented turmoil amid demands for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to enact anti-corruption reforms and a tussle for control ahead of an Israeli plan to quit the occupied Gaza Strip.

 Gunmen took over the governors office in Khan Younis early today to demand compensation from Arafats Palestinian Authority for destruction caused by Israeli raids. They left about an hour later after authorities promised to set up a mechanism to compensate Palestinian homeless.

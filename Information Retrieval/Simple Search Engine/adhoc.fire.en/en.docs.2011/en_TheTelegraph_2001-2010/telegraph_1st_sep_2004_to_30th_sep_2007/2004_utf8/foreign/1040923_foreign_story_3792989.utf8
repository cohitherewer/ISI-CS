 Putin envoy asks scribes to focus on bright side

 Brussels, Sept. 22 (Reuters): 

 Russia has more than enough problems and doesn?t need foreign 

 reporters rubbing it in, President Vladimir Putin?s special 

 envoy on European Union relations complained today.

 Sergei Yastrzhembsky appealed to reporters working in Russia to also look for the bright side of life. 

 ?Obviously we need to improve our country. We need to make it more democratic. We need more respect for human rights. We need to resolve the Chechen problem. We need to develop the market economy,? he said. 

 ?But at the least what we need is for the journalists who work in Russia not just to show its dark side,? he told the European Parliament?s foreign affairs committee when asked why Russia?s image abroad was so poor.

 He said while in Las Vegas on January 1 he switched on his television to see New Year celebrations from around the world. 

 ?I saw that in the US and Japan there were happy people popping champagne corks. And then there was Russia.? 

 The coverage of New Year in Moscow from CNN featured two homeless men guzzling a bottle of vodka in a metro station on the fringes of Red Square, he lamented.

 President Vladimir Putin?s new envoy to Chechnya today urged local officials to end corruption, while troops swept towns and villages hunting for rebels.

 Yukos seeks US court help

 Moscow, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Stricken Russian oil firm Yukos may ask a US judge today to find Gazprom in breach of a court order for participating in a weekend sale of Yukos? core asset, which could expose the state gas giant to asset seizures.

 Gazprom said yesterday it had sold its Gazpromneft oil unit that attended Sunday?s auction of Yugansk but did not bid. Analysts said Gazprom was trying to shield itself from potential litigation by selling the unit. The focus has now shifted to Houston where a US federal bankruptcy court resumes its hearing on the Yukos case later today.

 ?My sense is that Yukos lawyers will now ask the court to find that Gazprom is in violation of the original order,? said John Papallardo, a partner at international law firm Greenberg Traurig which is acting for Yukos owners Menatep Group.

 Gazprom denied it had any part in the sale of Yugansk, which pumps 11 per cent of Russia?s oil. Authorities sold the unit to recover Yukos? back tax bill of more than $27 billion. ?All these allegations from Yukos are nonsense. We have officially sold Gazpromneft to an unaffiliated company before the auction,? said a Gazprom official. Most analysts think Gazprom or Kremlin-linked firms will end up with Yugansk but Yukos has yet to assert any link in court.

 Yukos filed for bankruptcy protection in Houston last week to stop Sunday?s sale in which Yugansk was sold to the obscure Baikal Finance Group for $9.4 billion. If Gazprom is found in contempt of the US court order that barred it from taking part in the sale, that could leave the supplier of energy to millions of Europeans exposed to foreign asset seizures. Papallardo said Gazprom?s sale of Gazpromneft will not shield it from lawsuits if world?s largest natural gas producer sold the unit ?to avoid complicity.? 

 ?It constitutes participation if you show up to bid. That legitimised the auction, which would not have been valid with just one bidder,? said Papallardo.

 Yukos has threatened legal action for $20 billion in damages against third parties participating in the sale, raising the prospect of oil cargo seizures abroad and adding to concerns over supplies from the world?s second-biggest oil exporter. Russia?s energy minister Viktor Khristenko said Yugansk?s sale would not affect its crude oil exports.

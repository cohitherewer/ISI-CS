 Scores die in Samarra raid

 Samarra (Iraq), Oct. 1 (Reuters): US-led forces stormed Samarra today and said nearly 100 guerrillas were killed in air strikes and street-to-street combat during a major new American offensive to wrest control of the Iraqi town.

 Doctors at Samarra?s hospital said 47 bodies were brought in, including 11 women, five children and seven elderly men. They said ambulances could not reach many wounded as fighting, which lasted throughout the night, was still going on.

 A spokesman for the US 1st Infantry Division said an estimated 94 insurgents were killed. He said a US soldier was killed during the offensive and four wounded.

 The US military said Iraqi commandos had taken over Samarra?s Shia Golden Mosque and seized 25 rebels inside. Iraqi troops also secured the town?s renowned spiral minaret.

 The interior ministry in Baghdad said that by 0900 GMT Iraqi police were in control of the centre of Samarra and most surrounding areas after a joint US and Iraqi operation to ?remove the terrorists who have been holding the town hostage?.

 The US military says it will retake guerrilla strongholds such as Samarra, the western cities of Falluja and Ramadi and the Baghdad districts of Sadr City and Haifa Street by the end of the year so elections can go ahead in January as planned. Before dawn, troops backed by tanks pushed through Samarra?s streets as guerrillas unleashed mortar attacks and fired rocket-propelled grenades and rifles from the rooftops.

 Sporadic fighting was still being heard in the early afternoon and electricity and water were cut off in the town of more than 100,000 people, 100 km north of Baghdad. 

 Hundreds of families were fleeing the area.

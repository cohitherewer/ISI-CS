 Sarah signs up for a family affair

 Sarah Jessica Parker: Loving her

Los Angeles, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Diane Keaton, 

Sarah Jessica Parker and Dermot Mulroney have signed on to the untitled Fox romantic 

comedy previously known as Hating Her.

 Claire Danes, Rachel McAdams and Luke Wilson are in negotiations to join the $10 million-$20 million project, which is set for a late-February start.

 Set around Christmas-time, the story revolves around a family whose favourite son (Mulroney) brings home the woman to whom he intends to propose (Parker), only to have his family turn on her.

 Keaton plays the matriarch and the family?s emotional core. Wilson and McAdams would play Mulroney?s brother and sister, while Danes would play Parker?s sister.

 ?It?s an embarrassment of riches,? Tom Bezucha, the film?s writer-director, said of the cast. ?You can?t even dream this big.?

 Bezucha is a former fashion exec who worked at Polo and Coach in New York before becoming a filmmaker. He recently wrote Anyone but You, which is set up at Paramount, for producer Lynda Obst. 

 Some of Parkers latest screen ventures include Hugh Wilson?s live action version of Jay Ward?s 1960?s classic cartoon, Dudley Do-Right opposite Brendan Fraser and Alfred Molina; Paramount?s Til There Was You opposite Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn, directed by Scott Winant; Alongside Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close and Danny De Vito in Warner Brothers? Mars Attacks, directed by Tim Burton and Simian Films? Extreme Measures, directed by Michael Apted with Hugh Grant and Gene Hackman.

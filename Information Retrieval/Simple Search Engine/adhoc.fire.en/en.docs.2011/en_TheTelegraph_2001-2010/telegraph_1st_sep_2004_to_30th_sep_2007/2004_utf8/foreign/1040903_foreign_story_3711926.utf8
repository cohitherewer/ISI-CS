 Court frees Anwar

 Putrajaya (Malaysia), Sept. 2 (Reuters): Malaysias highest court freed rebel politician Anwar Ibrahim from almost six years in jail today, overturning his conviction for sodomy in a shock ruling expected to win support for the new Prime Minister.

 The former deputy Prime Minister, confined to a wheelchair because of a back complaint, used his first few minutes of freedom to urge recently installed Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi to drive harder on reform.

 Wearing a broad smile over his neck brace, Anwar held an impromptu news conference inside the domed Moorish-style courthouse, as hundreds of supporters rallied outside, raising his old battle cry of Reformasi the reform movement he led before his 1999 jailing.

 Thank you, may God bless you, Anwar told the judges after the decision. His lawyers shouted Allah-u-akbar after the court adjourned, closing a chapter in one of the nations most extraordinary political sagas.

 Thank God its over, Anwar added, turning to address reporters. I have to give credit to the new Prime Minister for not interfering with the judiciary ... I appeal to Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi to make the necessary reforms.

 Before his jailing, Anwar was a lightning rod for disaffected Malays, the countrys majority ethnic grouping that dominates politics, and turned against the then Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad. The decision could be a defining moment for the leadership of Abdullah, who succeeded Mahathir a year ago.

 Age 15, vocation bombing

 Peshawar, Dec. 14 (Reuters): He talks like a hardcore Islamist, but sounds like a little boy lost.

 Fifteen-year old Khalid was part of a gang that planted a booby-trapped bomb that killed four schoolchildren in Pakistan?s troubled tribal region of South Waziristan last October. Under guard in a safe house used by Pakistan?s security forces in Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province, Khalid is a long way from his home in the Central Asian state of Tajikistan.

 Before being caught with two accomplices, one even younger than himself, Khalid spent a month being groomed as an Islamist guerrilla fighter in the mountains on the Afghan-Pakistan border.

 His teachers clearly found a receptive mind, judging by Khalid?s admiration for the Taliban?s interpretation of Islam. ?I want an Islamic government like Taliban. That was the only true government in the world,? he said of Afghanistan?s vanquished rulers, whose medieval system of punishments and religious intolerance was condemned in most of the world.

 According to Khalid?s world view, al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden could be a role model. ?He is a mujahid (holy warrior). I like him because I know a little bit of Islam and I understand he is a good man and doing good.? Wearing Pakistan?s traditional baggy salwar kameez dress, the shy, fair-skinned pimply youth spoke reluctantly how he spent time with militants linked to al Qaida.

 Sometimes he would cover his face with his hand apparently to avoid answering questions. ?I was just wandering there and doing nothing.?

 Khalid said he was kidnapped along with four companions on his way to school at a village about 45 minutes drive from Tajik capital Dushanbe and then brought to Pakistan. 

 ?We were blindfolded and thrown into a vehicle,? he said. Experts say there have been many reports of smuggling of children from impoverished Tajikistan where parents even sell their children because of grinding poverty.

 Pakistani military officials say militants were recruiting more and more teenagers from Central Asia to carry out attacks, and say they have intercepted messages specifically asking their contacts to send them children.

 ?They are the future terrorists,? said Lieutenant-General Safdar Hussain, who leads the army?s hunt for militants in northwestern Pakistan.

 ?They are the best people to be used for terrorism. They can plant improvised explosive devices without anyone suspecting them because they are very young.?

 With his own militant career curtailed, Khalid is at a loss over what he wants from life. Asked if he would like to see his widowed mother again, Khalid can only nod miserably, unable to raise his eyes from the ground. 

 Army operations in South Waziristan have flushed out large numbers of militants from the former Soviet-controlled states of Central Asia.

 Members of al-Qaeda linked Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), for example, landed up in the semi-autonomous Pashtun tribal lands after first taking refuge in Afghanistan, having been forced out of Tajikistan in 2000.

 The leader of the Uzbek group, Juma Namangani, was killed by a U.S.-led air strike in 2001, when Washington decided to retaliate against al Qaedas attacks on U.S. cities on Sept. 11 by bombing bin Ladens militant network in Afghanistan.

 Military officials say Namanganis charismatic successor, Tahir Yuldashev, was now reorganising these central Asian militants and recruiting young men for attacks on the security forces in the tribal region.

 ?Qari Tahir Yuldashev, who has his own political motives, is using these boys for terrorism,? Hussain said.

 Commonly known as Qari because of his clear recitals of passages from the Koran in a beautiful voice, Yuldashev has been on the run since Pakistani security forces launched an offensive on his stronghold South Waziristan last March.

 He was said to have been wounded, but managed to escape and has not been sighted since.

 Blamed for a series of bomb attacks in the Uzbek capital Tashkent in 1999, Yuldashev was sentenced to death in absentia.

 Khalid said he had never met Yuldashev but has seen his in pictures.

 Liv-ing it up

 New York, Dec. 16 (AP): Steven Tyler is now, gasp, a grandfather.

 Liv Tyler, daughter of the Aerosmith lead singer and model Bebe Buell, gave birth to a son in Manhattan on Tuesday, Us Weekly magazine reported.

 ?They are both doing great,? Tylers publicist, Stephen Huvane, said yesterday. He said the baby hadn?t yet been named. The 27-year-old actress is married to Royston Langdon of the band Spacehog. The two tied the knot in March 2003. Tyler played the elf princess Arwen in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

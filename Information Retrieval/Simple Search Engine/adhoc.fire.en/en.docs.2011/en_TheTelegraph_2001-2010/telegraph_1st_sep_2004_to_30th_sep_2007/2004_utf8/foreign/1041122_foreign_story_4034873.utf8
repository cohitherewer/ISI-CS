 Poncho parade on power catwalk

 World leaders, visibly uneasy, donned brightly colored blanket-style ponchos on Sunday instead of sober suits in an annual ?fashion show? for an Asia-Pacific summit in Chile.

 President George W. Bush, sporting a deep red, embroidered, square ?chamanto? slung over his shirt and pants, tried to look comfortable, putting an arm around Russian President Vladimir Putin, draped in brown.

 He then sidled up with Australian Prime Minister John Howard, drowning in his blue blanket-style garment, for the official photograph of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.

 The formal setting ? a red carpet in front of a stone fountain in the Orange patio of the neoclassical La Moneda palace of Santiago ? clashed strikingly with the leaders? unfamiliar garb.

 Presidents and Prime Ministers looked out of sorts in the short ponchos, which hung only as far as mid-thigh. Mexican President Vicente Fox, the tallest, suffered the worst fitting, the poncho barely reaching down to his waist.

 The ?chamantos? were handwoven in silk thread and wool by weavers from Donihue, a small town in central Chile, and embroidered in ?copihues,? Chile?s national flower, barley and wheat ears, blackberries, grapes, fuchsias, pansies and birds.

 Traditionally, the dark side of the garb is used during the day, while its light side is mostly worn at night. Finished with ribbon edging, Apec leaders can wear the garments on either side, if they ever wear them again.

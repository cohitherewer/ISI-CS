 CBS regrets Bush war report

 New York, Sept. 20 (Reuters): In a blow to its credibility, CBS News said today it had been misled over the authenticity of documents it aired in a story challenging US President George W. Bush?s military service and announced it was mounting an internal investigation.

 ?Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in a report,? CBS News said in a statement.

 ?We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret.?

 The announcement marked a dramatic and embarrassing reversal by the network that just five days ago said it was satisfied with the accuracy of the documents first aired earlier this month in a 60 Minutes II segment.

 In a separate statement, the network?s top anchor, Dan Rather, apologised for what he called a ?mistake in judgment? and said CBS News had been misled on the key question of how its source for the documents had obtained the papers.

 The four memos, purportedly written and signed by the late Air National Guard Lieutenant Colonel Jerry Killian, said that he was under pressure from his superiors to ?sugar coat? Bush?s service record after Bush, then a Guard pilot, was grounded for his failure to perform to standards or to take a physical.

 Immediately after the report was aired on September 8, Bush supporters and competing news organisations challenged the authenticity of the documents. They said that comparisons of the Killian memos with other documents from Bush?s National Guard service revealed inconsistencies in terminology and word processing techniques.

 Campaign debates

 The campaigns of Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic challenger Senator John Kerry have tentatively agreed to three face-to-face debates, a source familiar with the negotiations said early today.

 The debates, beginning on September 30, could prove pivotal in the closely fought November 2 election between Bush and Kerry, and in an effort to lower voters? expectations, each side in recent weeks has already begun to portray the other as having the stronger debater.

 The source familiar with the negotiations said the Bush campaign had tentatively agreed to the full complement of debates recommended by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.

 Sharper Bush in testy debate

 St Louis, Oct. 9 (Reuters): President George W. Bush and Democratic challenger John Kerry argued about Iraq, jobs and taxes in their second debate yesterday, with Kerry questioning Bush?s judgment and the President accusing Kerry of crumbling under political pressure.

 In a sometimes testy confrontation that featured a sharper and more aggressive Bush than in last week?s debate, the White House rivals roamed the stage to battle over the decision to go to war in Iraq and accuse each other of misleading Americans.

 ?The world is more dangerous today because the President didn?t make the right judgments,? Kerry said, adding Bush ?took his eye off the ball? in shifting his focus to Iraq while Iran and North Korea developed nuclear programmes. Bush defended the Iraq war, attacked Kerry?s record and said the Massachusetts senator?s willingness to shift in the political winds made him an unsuitable leader. ?I don?t see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics,? Bush said.

 Kerry denied that he had changed his position on Iraq and said Bush was turning his campaign into a ?weapon of mass deception.? ?Let me tell you straight up: I?ve never changed my mind about Iraq. I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat. I always believed he was a threat,? he said. ?This President rushed to war, pushed our allies aside, and Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons. He took his eye off the ball, off Osama bin Laden,? Kerry said.

 Protesters stage camp-in at Venice

Venice, Sept. 6 (Reuters): While stars sip 

martinis poolside at the Venice Film Festival, down the beach hundreds of activists 

are staging a camp-in to protest against Hollywood blockbusters and high ticket 

prices at the competition.

 The T-shirt and flip-flop wearing crowd has stormed the red carpet twice, marched down the Lidos main avenues in anti-war protests and last night they occupied the exclusive terrace at the Excelsior Hotel where actors go to see and be seen. That was our masterpiece, our crowning achievement so far, said Luca Casarini, an anti-globalisation activist and one of the organisers of the anti-festival called Global Beach.

 Paparazzi may be lining up for glimpses of Al Pacino and Nicole Kidman, but the guests of honour at Global Beach are outspoken US director Tim Robbins and anti-globalisation icon Naomi Klein both in town to present new documentaries.

 I couldnt come here just for the ... rarefied celebrity culture, said Klein, whose documentary The Take about radical labour initiatives in Argentina thrilled the crowd. Its always important to cross over, this is where our roots are, said the author of No Logo.

 Curious starlets like Scarlett Johansson even made the trip down the beach for the unspooling last night of Robbins Embedded-Live, the digital documentary of his theatre production Embedded about the Iraq war.

 The activists are squatting on a stretch of sand with abandoned cabanas that was once a resort for police and their families.

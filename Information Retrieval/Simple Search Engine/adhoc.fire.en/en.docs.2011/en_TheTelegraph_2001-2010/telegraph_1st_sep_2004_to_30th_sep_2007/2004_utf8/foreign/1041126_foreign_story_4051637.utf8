 Muslims recruit Bard

 London, Nov. 25 (Reuters): British Muslims have recruited William Shakespeare to give them an image makeover.

 No matter that the bard was white, Christian and has been dead for nearly 400 years ? this week he is at the centre of Muslim Awareness Week, a bid to highlight the contribution Britain?s 1.8 million Muslims have made to society. As part of the campaign, colourful images of Islamic culture are being projected on to the outer walls of The Globe, the open air Shakespearean theatre on the banks of the Thames.

 The theatre, a replica of an Elizabethan playhouse, will host an Arabic souk, an open-air market, and a reading of a rare version of Othello, Shakespeare?s great tragedy about a Moorish nobleman who fights for Christian Venice. ?Shakespeare?s plays are not about good versus evil, not about a world in which you are either ?with us or against us,?? said Shaykh Hamza Yusuf, a Muslim scholar who is lecturing on Shakespeare and Islam at The Globe this week. ?Shakespeare refuses to indulge in those cartoon caricatures of right and wrong. His plays are too complex for that.? Yusuf says young British Muslims would do better to heed the subtle words of Shakespeare than the more strident messages sometimes thrown at them by politicians and religious leaders.

 ?Poets have an immense amount to teach us,? he said at The Globe. ?We listen too much to our social engineers and social scientists and not enough to our poets.?

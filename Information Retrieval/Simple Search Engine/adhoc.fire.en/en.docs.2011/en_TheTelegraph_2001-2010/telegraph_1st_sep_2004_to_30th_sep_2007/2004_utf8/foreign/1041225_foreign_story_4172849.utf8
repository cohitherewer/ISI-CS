 2 officers convicted for Pervez attempts

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Dec. 24: A Pakistan military court convicted two low-ranking army personnel on charges of involvement in assassination attempts on President Pervez Musharraf in December last year, military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan said today.

 He added that one of the convicts, was given the death penalty and the other was sentenced to 10 years in jail.

 Sultan confirmed that the military court handed down the sentences two days ago. The two convicts are among ten army and air force personnel who had been indicted for being directly or indirectly involved in the December 15 and December 25 attacks on Musharraf. However, Sultan did not say in which of the attempts the two convicts had been involved.

 The spokesman refused to confirm whether any civilians were also being tried on the same charges. In the December 25 attack, two suicide bombers tried to ram their explosive-packed vehicles into Musharraf?s convoy, 2 km away from his official residence in Rawalpindi. 

 Sixteen people were killed and 40 were injured in the attack. Musharraf survived both assassination attempts. Several suspects had been picked up for interrogation after the attack.

 Boston, Nov. 3: Election Day began for Senator John F. Kerry with so much promise, with exit polling favouring his candidacy and crowds gathering wherever he appeared. 

 But as the night turned cold and wet and stretched into early morning, Kerry stayed in his Beacon Hill home, his chances for victory slipping away. It was Kerry?s running mate, Senator John Edwards, who appeared before supporters gathered in Copley Square at 2.30 am to vow that the election was not yet over. ?It?s been a long night, but we?ve waited for four years for this victory ? we can wait one more night,? he said. ?We will fight for every vote.?

 Tens of thousands of nervous supporters had crammed the square to hear singer Sheryl Crow and wait for any bit of good news as the outcome looked increasingly grim. 

 In the closing hours of a marathon day filled with at first hope, and then high tension, the Democratic challenger kept his thoughts about the future to himself. But at several points, the candidate waxed warm and sentimental. Kerry embraced supporters in Wisconsin at his last campaign event, thanked teary staffers who had stuck with him when he was all but written off a year ago, and even reached out to the members of his travelling press corps, whom he had not spoken to in months.

 Cool conman

 London, Oct. 22 (Reuters): A 52-year-old man who stole money and personal property from more than 50 rugby and cricket clubs around Britain over the last two years is in police custody awaiting sentence.

 The Rugby Football Union said today that Alan Phillips, from Yorkshire, lucky to have avoided dectection by his disgruntled victims, had been caught by Avon and Somerset Police and admitted at Yeovil Magistrates Court to more than 50 thefts.

 He admitted visiting rugby and cricket clubs the length and breadth of England and Scotland posing as a club official.

 ?Phillips was a very cool customer, acting the grey man in clubs across the country from Cornwall to Scotland,? said Becky Maddison of the Avon and Somerset police. ?Whenever a club asked for water bottles, he would go and get them as no one knew who he was.?

 Road rage

 Tehran (Reuters): An incensed Iranian motorist doused his car in petrol and set it ablaze with a match after picking up a parking ticket, media reported. The ISNA student news agency posted photographs of the charred shell of the car on its website and quoted witnesses describing the driver?s frantic but fruitless pleas to the parking attendant not to issue a ticket. ?Extremely angry, he took a jerrycan of petrol out of the boot and set fire to his car,? ISNA quoted a witness in poor south Tehran as saying.

 Duck hunt

 Washington (PTI): Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry put on a hunter?s garb and went duck-hunting in a party of four around Lake Ohio, in an apparent effort to seek votes from gun-ownership seekers. He announced jubilantly to reporters afterwards that each member of the party got a bird each yesterday.

 Ohio is one of the states which insist on ?gun rights? for their citizenry. One member of the party said kerry injured himself slightly during the hunt. However, kerry told reporters that the blood on his hand was only duck blood.

 Vice president dick cheney, an avid hunter, who was allowed campaigning in ohio yesterday, scoffed at kerrys duck hunt. ?My fellow sportsmen, this cover-up isnt going to work,? cheney said.

 Kerrys ?new hunting coat,? he said, was ?an october disguise?an effort he is mang to hide the fact that he votes against gun ownership rights at every turn?.

 But the 6 ft 4 kerry insisted that he really goes hunting periodically.

 The gun lobby is one of the most powerful lobbies in the country. Its slogan is that if citizens are denied guns, only criminals will have them. Pti tvp tck 10222042 del

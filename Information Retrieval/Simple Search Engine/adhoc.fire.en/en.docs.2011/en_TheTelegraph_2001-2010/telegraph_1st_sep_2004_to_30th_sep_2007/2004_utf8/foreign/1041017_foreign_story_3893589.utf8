 Chinese to get extra security, assures Pak

 Islamabad, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Pakistan will provide extra security to Chinese nationals working in the country and hunt down a former Guantanamo Bay inmate who masterminded the abduction of two Chinese engineers, a minister said today.

 Interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said after meeting visiting Chinese officials that Pakistan will take all necessary steps to bring the al Qaida-linked tribesman who directed the six-day hostage drama to justice.

 ?As the President said, the mastermind of this operation, Abdullah Mehsud, he would be dealt with by the law enforcing agencies,? Sherpao said two days after the death of one of the Chinese engineers. Wang Peng died after a rescue operation by army commandos on Thursday.

 ?We are not going to let (him) go,? Sherpao said of Abdullah. ?Whatever operations are necessary, they will be taken,? he said.

 Officials at the Pakistan?s interior ministry briefed the visiting Chinese about the kidnapping and the additional security arrangements for Chinese nationals in Pakistan, Sherpao said. ?There will be a multi-layered security system so that such incidents do not occur again,? he said.

 Some 3,000 Chinese are working on a number of development projects in the country. 

 ?The Chinese are fully satisfied with the operation and the security arrangements and have assured continuity of cooperation,? said Sherpao.

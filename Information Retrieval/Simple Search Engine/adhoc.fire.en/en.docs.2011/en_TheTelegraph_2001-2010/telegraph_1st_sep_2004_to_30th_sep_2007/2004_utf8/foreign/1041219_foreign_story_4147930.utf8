 Baby cut from womb found alive

 Kansas City (Montana), Dec 18 (Reuters): A baby girl who was cut out of her murdered mother?s womb and taken from the crime scene was found alive yesterday in the possession of a Kansas woman who police charged with kidnapping resulting in death.

 The motive for the bizarre crime remained unknown, investigators said, though local media in Kansas City reported that the alleged kidnapper had suffered a miscarriage.

 Todd Graves, the US attorney in Kansas City, Missouri, released an affidavit detailing how computer sleuthing by FBI agents tracked down the baby to the town of Melvern in eastern Kansas where she was found in apparently healthy condition at the home of Kevin and Lisa Montgomery. Lisa Montgomery, 36, was named in federal kidnap-murder charges, which carry the death penalty.

 Agents who made the arrest said Montgomery had told her husband that she had unexpectedly given birth. The couple has two older children but it was not clear from the document if she was also their mother. 

 The baby was located about 24 hours after the murder of Bobbi Stinnett, 23, who was eight months pregnant. Her body was found by her mother at her home in the town of Skidmore in rural northwest Missouri.

 The victim bred and sold rat terrier dogs and had been in communication on her computer with someone who asked for directions to her home to make a purchase.

 FBI agents were able to track down the Internet address being used to a server in Topeka, Kansas, and from there they found the home.

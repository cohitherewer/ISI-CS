 Mandela son critical

 Johannesburg, Dec. 7 (Reuters): The only surviving son of former South African President Nelson Mandela is in a critical condition in a Johannesburg hospital, the South African Press Association (SAPA) reported yesterday. 

 A spokeswoman at the Nelson Mandela Foundation said it ?was a private family matter? and she could not divulge the nature of Makgatho Mandela?s illness. He is believed to be in his mid-50s.

 Officials at the foundation could not be immediately reached for comment. His son?s condition will be a blow to the 86-year-old anti-apartheid icon.

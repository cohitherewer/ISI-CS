 Dunst it: Kirsten grows up

 JOHN HISCOCK

 Kirsten Dunst: Take charge

 London, Sept. 13: When you?ve been an actress since the age of three and shared a screen kiss with Tom Cruise at 11, it can be a little difficult to keep in touch with reality. 

 You are surrounded by people whose job is to make your life easy and painless: a protective mother, assistants, managers, agents, financial advisers and relatives, all eager to share in your fame and fortune.

 Until now it has been that way for Kirsten Dunst, the pretty, precocious blonde who became the envy of every teenage girl when she beat 5,000 other hopefuls for the role of Claudia, the seductive little bloodsucker in Interview With the Vampire with Cruise and Brad Pitt and went on to play Spider-Man?s girlfriend Mary Jane Watson in the hugely successful Spider-Man films.

 Fortunately for her she has grown into one of the brightest and most intelligent of Hollywood?s young actors. And, at the age of 22, she realises that she has to make some major changes and assume a few responsibilities. 

 After almost 20 years of work and more than 30 films, it has become important to her to have a life of her own away from the cameras, so she recently moved out from her mother?s home and bought her own house in the Hollywood Hills which she is currently remodelling. 

 She is also taking over the handling of her life and career and cutting back on the number of people who depend on her money for support. ?In the past it was all about making other people happy, but now it?s about making myself happy,? she says.

 ?It was time to get away. It?s still hard for my mom, I think. But things have changed. We still see each other every week but it?s nice to have my own place and space because I never went to college and had that experience.?

 Instead she spent her New York childhood going to auditions and making television commercials ? she appeared in more than 70 ? before appearing in her first feature film at the age of seven as Mia Farrow?s daughter in Oedipus Wrecks, Woody Allen?s segment of New York Stories.

 When she was 10, her family moved to Los Angeles so she could be nearer the film-making action; her parents divorced when she was 13. Her mother guided her career, choosing her projects and shielding her from rejections, although there were not that many.

 While she is a mature and accomplished actress, wise in the ways of Hollywood, Dunst is still in many ways a child-woman with big gaps in her knowledge of life. ?I grew up early in a lot of ways but I didn?t at all in a lot of other ways,? she says, with commendable self-awareness. 

 Her naivety shows itself in her joking remarks ? she caused a stir by saying in a recent interview that she thought Spider-Man should die and Mary Jane should have spider babies ? and her honesty: ?I get all my really nice clothes free from designers for doing press and premi?res and stuff,? she tells me with a giggle. She now picks her own projects and is involved in managing her financial affairs, although, she confesses, this is not something that comes easily to her.

 ?All I know is that as a 22-year-old girl I have a lot more responsibilities than most 22-year-olds have,? she says. 

 ?I?m learning about money and financing and things that are very adult that I have to deal with but it doesn?t make me feel more independent ? it?s just to know what?s going on. But sometimes it?s hard because you just want to be a 22-year-old with none of those worries.?

 Dunst found a compatible on-screen partner in Wimbledon co-star Paul Bettany, who flew to California to do a screen test with her at the the Hollywood hotel Chateau Marmont. ?We got along right from the beginning,? she says. ?It was such a relief for me to be able to work with him every day. With him I felt totally comfortable. I?d love to do a more serious movie with him one day.?

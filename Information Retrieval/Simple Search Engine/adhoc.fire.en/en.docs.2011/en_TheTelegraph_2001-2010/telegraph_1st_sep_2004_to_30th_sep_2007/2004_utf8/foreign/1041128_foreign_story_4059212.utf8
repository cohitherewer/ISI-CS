 Rebels planned to kill Bush

 George W. Bush

 Bogota, Nov. 27 (Reuters): 

 US President George W. Bush was targeted for assassination 

 by Colombia?s biggest Marxist rebel group this week when 

 he visited the Caribbean port city of Cartagena, a top Colombian 

 official said today.

 ?According to informants and various sources, we had information indicating that various members of the FARC had been instructed by their leaders to make an attempt against President Bush,? defence secretary Jorge Alberto Uribe said. He would not be drawn out on the details of the threat.

 The White House had no immediate comment.

 The US Secret Service, which protects the President, said it ?does not comment or release information regarding our protective intelligence and protective methods.?

 ?We do not discuss any alleged threats to our protectees,? said Jonathan Cherry, a Secret Service spokesman.

 The 17,000-strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, fighting a 40-year guerrilla war against the state, has long accused the the US of backing business interests in this Andean country while ignoring the 60 per cent of the population that lives in poverty. There was heavy security in Cartagena when Bush visited the city on Monday on his way back from the Apec forum in Chile. Military helicopters packed with armed soldiers flew over Bush?s motorcade while naval vessels kept watch offshore. Many shops were shuttered.

 The FARC has made many attempts against the life of President Alvaro Uribe, one of few conservative South American presidents with strong ties to Washington. Uribe, whose father was killed resisting kidnap by the FARC in the 1980s, narrowly survived a car bomb attack by the FARC during his 2002 presidential campaign.

 The last US President to visit Colombia was Bill Clinton, whose trip to Cartagena was marked by the seizure of bomb-making materials from a house six blocks from a building Clinton was visiting. Bush used his four-hour trip to solidify his alliance with Uribe, whom he considers an ally in the effort to curtail the illegal drug trade.

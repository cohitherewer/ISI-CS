 Rape slur on Nick Nolte

 Los Angeles, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Actor Nick Nolte has been sued by the parents of a teenage girl who said she was raped during a party in his absence at his California home after she was drugged by Nolte?s security guard.

 According to the lawsuit, Nolte was involved in efforts to cover up the videotaped assault and was aware that his Malibu home was regularly being used for parties where drugs and alcohol were furnished to minors.

 Culkin charged in Oklahoma

 Oklahoma City, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Oklahoma has charged Macaulay Culkin with illegal possession of marijuana and a controlled substance after the former child star was arrested during a traffic stop last week, authorities said today.

 Culkin was charged late on Monday with one misdemeanour count of possession of marijuana and one misdemeanour count of possession of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax without a prescription, punishable by up to a year in prison.

 Oklahoma law enforcement officials said it was unlikely Culkin, 24, would face prison time if convicted.

 A court date has not been set, and Oklahoma prosecutors are seeking drug treatment as part of any plea agreement.

 Culkin, best known for his role of the ingenious child who fends off burglars in the Home Alone movies, was arrested last Friday on a highway in Oklahoma City.

 According to the arrest report, an Oklahoma City police officer pulled over a speeding car in which Culkin was a passenger.

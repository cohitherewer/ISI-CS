 Mothers who moved 9/11 bill

 Washington, Dec. 9: In the past three years, Mary Fetchet and Carol Ashley have outmanoeuvered the US President and vice-president, the national security adviser, the speaker of the House and chairmen of congressional committees.

 Not bad for a social worker from Connecticut and a retired schoolteacher from Long Island. Yesterday, as the Senate gave final passage to the broad Intelligence Reform Bill, high officials lined up like so many sycophants to credit Fetchet and Ashley ? both mothers of September 11 victims ? for the legislative triumph.

 In the gilded Lyndon B. Johnson Room off the Senate floor, the Senate leaders, the legislation sponsors, and members of the commission that investigated the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks filed past the two women for a hug and a mug for the cameras.

 ?Welcome to our world, quot; said Fetchet, who was anxious to catch a 6.30 pm flight out of Washington so she would not miss her son?s hockey game.

 It is no exaggeration to say that yesterday?s reorganisation of the nation?s intelligence structure would not have happened without Fetchet, Ashley and the 10 other self-appointed representatives of September 11 victims? relatives who formed the Family Steering Committee. 

 Though they started out with little understanding of politics or national security, and they did not truly represent the thousands of victims? relatives (in fact, many other relatives opposed the legislation), they used the moral authority they earned from their losses ? invoked freely in vigils, at news conferences and in the lobbies of Congress ? to shame the government into action.

 ?Would we be here except for those two? I don?t think so,? Democrat Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, one of the legislation?s sponsors, said after thanking Fetchet and Ashley. ?It was impossible for a member of Congress to face the family members and say they wouldn?t do something.?

 ?I agree,? said Republican Senator Susan Collins, the co-sponsor. ?They had the moral conviction.?

 The family members? public complaints pressured President Bush to drop his initial opposition to a September 11 commission and his subsequent reluctance to meet all 12 commission members and to share with the panel his most sensitive intelligence briefings and the testimony of White House officials. 

 Loud criticism from the family members also moved opponents on the Hill to retreat from efforts to curb the commission?s budget and deadline. In recent weeks, the family members scolded holdouts until the legislation passed. ?President Bush must use his political capital to overrule the obstructionists and garner support from the House Republicans,? Fetchet said on Monday. ?In the memory of the 3,000 precious lives lost on September 11th, we the families will continue our mission of making our country safer. We hope our government does the same.?

 That is pretty sophisticated rhetoric for a woman who had no political or public-speaking background before she came to Washington in 2002 to speak at a rally in support of forming a September 11 commission. 

 ?It was like The Twilight Zone,? she said. ?I didn?t know who?s a senator or who?s a congressman (The Twilight Zone was one of US? most revered TV shows).? She was baffled when a strange man presented her with his business card (it turned out to be Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat).

 Now, congressional aides drive Fetchet and Ashley about town and carry their luggage. The women take calls on their cellphones from prominent officials and call them by first names. They are now recognised in Capitol elevators and know when a bill is ?engrossed?.

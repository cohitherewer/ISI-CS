 Arafat well, 

say aides

 Paris, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Medical tests carried out on Palestinian President Yasser Arafat have ruled out that he is suffering from any life-threatening condition, senior aides said. 

 ?The latest tests have found that President Arafat does not suffer from any life-threatening illness and what he has is curable,? senior aide Nabil Abu Rdainah said.

 Arafat underwent a battery of medical tests yesterday at a military hospital in France. He flew to the hospital outside Paris on Friday after leaving his shell-battered compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah. 

 Another aide said the doctors were also looking into the possibility of viral infection or poisoning.

 In final stretch, Bush gets lead

 DAVID RENNIE

 Washington, Oct. 19: With 

 just a fortnight to go until polling day, President George 

 W. Bush has suddenly opened up a significant lead over Senator 

 John Kerry, new opinion polls showed yesterday.

 The latest Gallup poll showed Bush leading Kerry by 52 per cent to 44 among likely voters, who appeared to be heeding the drumbeat of Republican attacks on Kerry?s ability to protect America from terrorism. 

 Other polls, by Newsweek magazine, ABC television and Time magazine, gave Bush leads of between two and six per cent. The swing among voters erased a brief advantage the Democratic senator gained by ?winning? a series of three televised presidential debates, in which Bush too often came across as flustered and defensive. A note of caution was sounded by pollsters of all persuasions, who noted that such national ?horse-race? numbers are of less and less use in predicting an election. With America sharply divided on partisan lines, the election results in most states are increasingly a foregone conclusion. 

 Barring a major surge by either candidate, which could place up to 20 states in play, the real fight currently centres on fewer than a dozen states: New Hampshire, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Iowa and New Mexico.

 Of those, the large states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania are viewed as the holy of holies, with the candidate who wins two of the three viewed as all but unbeatable. Florida is currently looking better for Bush, and Ohio stronger for Kerry. Pennsylvania is too close to call. With Bush showing signs of pulling ahead, the presidential race promptly headed into the rhetorical gutter, as Kerry began hurling a series of emotive charges at Bush. Kerry warned young people that a Republican win offered ?great potential? for the return of military conscription. He has also blamed Bush for a catastrophic shortage of flu vaccines in America this winter.

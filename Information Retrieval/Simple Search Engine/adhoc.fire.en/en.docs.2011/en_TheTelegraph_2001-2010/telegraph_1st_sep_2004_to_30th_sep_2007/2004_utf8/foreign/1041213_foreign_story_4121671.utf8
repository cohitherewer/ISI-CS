 Fan lifts suicide plot from Holmes 

 ELIZABETH DAY

 London, Dec. 12: A leading authority on Sherlock Holmes took his own life in a way meant to suggest that a rival had murdered him, it has been claimed.

 Richard Lancelyn Green, 50, a prolific author and collector of memorabilia relating to the fictional detective, was found garotted on his bed by police in March after trying to stop a ?2-million auction of Arthur Conan Doyle?s papers.

 Although the coroner returned an open verdict, friends and relatives of Lancelyn Green now claim that the evidence suggests he took his own life in a manner that would implicate an American rival.

 In an interview with The New Yorker magazine, James Gibson, who co-edited the first comprehensive Conan Doyle bibliography with Lancelyn Green in 1983, concludes that his colleague had ?wanted (his death) to look like murder?, and that he had set up a trail of ?false clues?. Lancelyn Green?s body was found in his flat in Kensington, west London, on March 27 with a shoelace tied round his neck and a wooden spoon, which had been used to tighten the noose, still entangled in the cord.

 In the weeks leading up to his death, Lancelyn Green had expressed concern that a forthcoming auction of Conan Doyle?s papers at Christie?s, consisted mostly of items that the author?s daughter, Jean Conan Doyle, had left as a bequest to the British Library. Lancelyn Green, a former chairman of the Sherlock Holmes Society, wanted access to the papers to research a biography of Conan Doyle.

 Gibson said that the more curious elements of the evidence ? which had revived talk of a Conan Doyle ?curse? ? could be explained by Lancelyn Green?s suicide. 

 ?He had to have used (the wooden spoon) to tighten the cord. If someone else had garroted him, why would he need the spoon? The killer could simply use his hands. I think things in his life had not turned out the way he wanted. This sale brought everything to a head.?

 Before he died Lancelyn Green had made several telephone calls to friends and journalists claiming that an American whom he did not identify was pursuing him. He feared that his opposition to the forthcoming auction could result in his death and his behaviour is said to have become increasingly erratic.

 Although ?the American? is not named in the New Yorker, there has been speculation among Holmes enthusiasts that Lancelyn Green was becoming increasingly paranoid about Jon Lellenberg, a policy strategy analyst in the office of Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, and a respected author of books about Holmes. 

 The men had collaborated on a number of Holmesian articles but fell out in the mid-1990s over Green?s close relationship with Jean. 

 If the theory is proved correct, Green?s death would echo the plot of one of the last Sherlock Holmes mysteries, The Problem of Thor Bridge (1922), in which a wife is found lying dead on a bridge, shot in the head at point-blank range. All the evidence points to the governess with whom the husband had been flirting but Holmes shows that she had killed herself to frame her rival.

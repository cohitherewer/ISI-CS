 Clinton released

 New York, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Former US President Bill Clinton was released from a New York hospital yesterday after undergoing quadruple heart bypass surgery earlier in the week, his office said.

 Clinton was back at his home in suburban Chappaqua, New York, north of New York, his office said in a statement. ?The president is in good spirits and has taken short walks in the hospital hallway and in his home today.? The former president was seen leaving the hospital in a motorcade of black vehicles but did not speak with reporters who had staked out the hospital in recent days. Clinton, his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea, 24, issued a statement thanking hospital staff and those who sent more than 85,000 get-well messages through the Clinton Foundation website.

 ?We appreciate more than words can say all the good wishes and messages of concern that we received during this difficult time in our lives,? the Clintons said. ?Your thoughts and prayers meant so much to us, and helped keep our spirits strong. We feel blessed to have such support, and it will continue to sustain us throughout the months of recuperation that remain ahead.?

 Clinton, 58, had the surgery on September 6 at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where doctors said he would have risked a ?substantial? heart attack without the operation because some of his arteries were 90 per cent blocked.

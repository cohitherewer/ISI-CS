 Miracle grips Japan

 Nagaoka (Japan), Oct. 27 (Reuters): In a drama that gripped Japanese watching on live television, a two-year-old toddler was pulled alive from a car that had been buried under tonnes of rock and mud for nearly four days after a deadly earthquake.

 The boy?s mother was airlifted to hospital later but was pronounced dead, and rescue workers had to call off efforts to save his three-year-old sister after darkness fell today.

 Orange-clad rescue workers shifted huge boulders that had crashed onto the family?s van to rescue two-year-old Yuta Minagawa, gently passing him from hand to hand before airlifting him by helicopter to hospital, where he called out: ?Mama.?

 Despite hours of intense effort as aftershocks jolted the area, the workers could not rescue Yuta?s sister, Mayu. Media reported that the girl, still in the car, had no vital signs.

 Takako Minagawa, 39, and her children were on their way home from visiting friends when the quake struck on Saturday, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 3,400 in the rural Niigata region, 250 km north of Tokyo.

 The 6.8 magnitude earthquake was Japan?s deadliest since a quake with a reading of 7.2 killed more than 6,400 in the western city of Kobe in 1995. More than 100,000 survivors of Saturday?s quake, many of them elderly, were still in makeshift shelters, enduring another day of stress and fatigue, raising fears the death toll could rise. The rescue operation, broadcast live for hours by most television networks, was preceded by another powerful tremor.

 At least one building collapsed in Ojiya, one of the towns hardest hit by Saturdays big quake. Officials said many buildings in the region had been weakened by recent tremors.

 Todays major aftershock had a magnitude of 6.1, hitting at 0140 GMT. It was also felt strongly in Tokyo, but there were no reports of damage in the capital. A man in Ojiya was taken to hospital after apparently suffering a stroke, and four others were injured, media said.

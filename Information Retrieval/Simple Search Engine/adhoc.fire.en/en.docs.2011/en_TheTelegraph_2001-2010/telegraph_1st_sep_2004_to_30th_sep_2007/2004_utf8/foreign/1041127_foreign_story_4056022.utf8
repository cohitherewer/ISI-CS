 Iraq parties call for poll delay

 Baghdad, Nov. 26 (Reuters): 

 Leading Iraqi political parties, including the two main 

 Kurdish groups closely allied to the US, called today for 

 elections scheduled for January 30 to be delayed because 

 of Iraq?s widening violence.

 Following a meeting at the Baghdad home of Adnan Pachachi, a moderate Sunni leader, 15 political parties and groups signed a petition calling for the election to be put off for up to six months.

 ?The participants call for elections to be delayed and to be held within six months, allowing for changes in the security situation and completion of necessary arrangements in terms of organisation and administration,? the petition read. Three interim government ministers attended the meeting and representatives from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party signed the petition.

 A delegate from the Iraqi National Accord, headed by Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, attended the meeting but did not sign. No representatives from the country?s two main Shia parties, Dawa and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, were present, underlining the political schism.

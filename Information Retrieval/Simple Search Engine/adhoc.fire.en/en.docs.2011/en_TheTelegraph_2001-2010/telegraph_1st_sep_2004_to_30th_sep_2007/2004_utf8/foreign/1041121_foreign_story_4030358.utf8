 Staff backs Annan

 United Nations, Nov. 20 (PTI): The UN staff union, representing over 5,000 employees, has strongly criticised the senior management of the world body for exonerating top investigator Dileep Nair of Singapore, who is accused of misconduct, and regretted secretary-general Kofi Annan?s decision to support it.

 But the union expressed full confidence in Annan, while terming the inquiry into allegations of misconduct against Nair, head of the UN office for oversight services, ?insufficient?. 

 President of the staff union Rosemarie Waters said: ?We not only have confidence in him (Annan), we support him fully.?

 Maoist bomb rips apart building

 Kathmandu, Dec. 9 (Reuters): Maoists rebels set off a powerful bomb in the Nepali capital today, causing no casualties but leaving a large part of a government building in ruins, police said.

 The explosion came a week after two blasts in Kathmandu blamed on Maoist rebels fighting to topple the constitutional monarchy. No one was hurt in those blasts either.

 The blast came hours before King Gyanendra inaugurated a controversial meeting of the king?s advisory council, the Raj Parishad, which is expected to discuss the issue of giving more powers to the king.

 Students and supporters of Opposition parties burned tyres on the streets and disrupted traffic in the capital demanding the abolition of the council. At today?s bomb site, damaged computer monitors, broken chairs and cupboards were visible amid the rubble, after parts of the first and second storeys of the building collapsed.

 Police said two young men entered the building compound before office hours, overpowered the guard using a pistol and planted the bomb. The men told the guard they were Maoists before ordering him to flee. ?After the blast, the ground trembled like an earthquake. I was stunned and was shivering. I couldn?t think any more,? Ram Raja Khatri, the guard who had been overpowered, said.

 Broken bricks, steel rods and papers were strewn around the compound of the building, which houses the offices of the state-run Agricultural Inputs Company. Dozens of window panes in nearby houses and buildings had shattered.

 Police and analysts say the Maoists, who want to establish a single-party communist republic in the Himalayan nation, occasionally set off bombs in Kathmandu to make the point that they can strike anywhere in the country.

 The rebels already control large swathes of the countryside.

 Talks between the government and Maoists in 2001 and 2003 failed amid rows over the role of the monarchy in a future political arrangement.

 In the past three months the government has repeatedly called the rebels for fresh peace talks. But Kathmandu has said it plans to go ahead with parliamentary elections next April if the rebels do not respond to appeals for dialogue by Jan. 13.

 The rebels have vowed to oppose the elections and demanded that polls to a constituent assembly that would prepare a new constitution be held first. The proposed assembly would decide the future of the monarchy.

 Gyanendra became king in 2001 after King Birendra and eight other memberes of the royal family were killed by a drunken crown prince who later turned the gun on himself.

 In 2002, Gyanendra dismissed elected prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and assumed executive powers amid a row over the timing of elections then set for November.

 He reappointed Deuba in June after sustained protests but political parties say the monarch is seeking more powers.

 More than 10,000 people have been killed in the Maoist revolt which started in 1996.

 Sharon union near collapse

 Ariel Sharon

 Jerusalem, Dec. 1 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon?s coalition reeled towards collapse today over a budget vote likely to force him to remake his government or call elections that would imperil his Gaza withdrawal plan.

 Sharon looks destined to lose the first reading of the 2005 state budget in Parliament because of a revolt by the Prime Minister?s main coalition partner, the Shinui party. He said he would sack Shinui if it defied him.

 To avert elections two years ahead of schedule and an indefinite delay to his plan for ?disengaging? from conflict with Palestinians, Sharon would have to replace Shinui with the Labour party and maybe a religious faction to pad his margin.

 Analysts said Sharon, who would hold only 40 seats in the 120-seat parliament without Shinui, wanted to wrap up a deal with Labour on Monday to avoid the risk of being toppled by a possible no-confidence vote over the economy.

 The government must pass the budget by March 31 or resign.

 The budget process has stumbled on the Opposition from Left-wing and religious parties to steep cutbacks in social spending.

 Having Labour on board would solidify majorities for the budget and Sharon?s plan to remove Jewish settlements from some occupied land. But powerful Likud rebels bent on scuttling his Gaza plan have balked at any such ?unity coalition?.

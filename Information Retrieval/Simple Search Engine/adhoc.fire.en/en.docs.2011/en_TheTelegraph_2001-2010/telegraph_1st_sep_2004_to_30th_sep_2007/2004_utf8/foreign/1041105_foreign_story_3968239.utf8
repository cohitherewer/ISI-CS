 Ebadi sues US over embargo

 New York, Nov. 4 (Reuters): Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi has sued the US because its economic embargo on Iran is blocking publication of her memoirs in America, a literary agency said yesterday.

 Iranian human rights lawyer Ebadi said she wanted to write a book for a US and international audience about her life and career ?as a woman, a mother and a lawyer living and working in a country that confronts many human rights problems.?

 The suit filed by Ebadi and the Strothman Agency seeks to strike down US treasury department regulations requiring a licence to publish authors from embargoed countries such as Iran ? a nation dubbed in 2002 as part of the ?axis of evil? by President George W. Bush along with Iraq and North Korea.

 ?The... regulations seem to defy the values the US promotes throughout the world, which always include free expression and the free exchange of ideas,? Ebadi, who won the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, said in a filing to the court.

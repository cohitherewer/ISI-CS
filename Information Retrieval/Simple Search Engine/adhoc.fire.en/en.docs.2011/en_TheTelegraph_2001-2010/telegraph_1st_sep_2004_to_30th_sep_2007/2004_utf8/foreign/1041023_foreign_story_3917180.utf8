 Pervez earns 

uniform breather

 Pervez Musharraf

 Islamabad, Oct. 22 (Reuters): The head of the Commonwealth today brushed aside concern over indications Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf plans to go back on his word and stay on as head of the army after 2004.

 Don McKinnon, secretary general of the group of mostly former British colonies, said Musharraf had taken the issue to parliament and it was up to the legislature to make a decision. ?The important thing is that the issue is taken to the parliament and the parliament debated that issue,? he told reporters after meeting Musharraf.

 The National Assembly, parliament?s lower house, last week passed a bill to allow Musharraf to stay on as army chief beyond 2004 despite a pledge to give up the job by the end of the year.

 McKinnon said he raised the uniform issue with Musharraf during the meeting and told him that the Commonwealth wanted ?some clarity?. 

 However, he said, the group also underlined the need for maintaining ?supremacy of the parliament and the constitution?.

 McKinnon?s visit to Pakistan comes amid rising tension between the pro-military government and Opposition parties over Musharraf?s dual military and political role.

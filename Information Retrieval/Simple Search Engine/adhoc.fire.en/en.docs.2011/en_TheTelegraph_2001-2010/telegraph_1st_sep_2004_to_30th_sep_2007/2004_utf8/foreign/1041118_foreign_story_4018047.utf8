 Bid to put Everest on danger list after scare

 CHARLES CLOVER

 London, Nov. 17: Conservationists and climbers will ask the UN to place Mount Everest on a danger list because its snows are retreating rapidly as a result of climate change. 

 They are calling on Unesco, the Paris-based organisation which is responsible for the care of world heritage sites, to designate the mountain and thereby place a legal duty on the international community to protect the area. 

 The petitioners include Sir David Attenborough, the broadcaster; Sir Chris Bonington, the mountaineer, and Reinhold Messner, the first mountaineer to climb the world?s 14 highest peaks. 

 The group gives warning that melt water is filling Himalayan lakes, which could cause catastrophic flooding if they burst. 

 Statements gathered from some of the most distinguished climbers of Everest will be delivered by hand to the World Heritage Committee in Paris by Pro Public (Friends of the Earth Nepal). 

 Pemba Dorjee Sherpa, who holds the record for the fastest -ever climb of Everest, eight hours and 10 minutes, said: ?Last year when Edmund Hillary came to Everest, he told me that so much snow had melted in the 50 years since he first climbed it. 

 ?In 1953 snow and ice had reached all the way to base camp, but now it ends five miles above. Everest is losing its natural beauty.?

 US in bid to simulate nuke blast

 Livermore (California), Dec. 23 (Reuters): Leading nuclear scientists with top security clearances will gather next summer at a screening room east of San Francisco and witness the results of the greatest effort ever in supercomputing.

 Using a computer doing 360 trillion calculations a second, scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Lab will simulate the explosion of an ageing nuclear bomb in three dimensions. The short, highly detailed video produced by the world?s fastest computer will attempt to illustrate how missiles dating back to the Nixon administration would perform today.

 ?My job... is to ensure that the nuclear weapons in the stockpile are safe and reliable,? said Bruce Goodwin, associate director for defence and nuclear technologies. ?Safe means no matter what you do to them they don?t go off when they are not supposed to. Reliable means that should the president ever have to use one, it will work exactly as it is supposed to.?

 The US has about 10,000 nuclear warheads as a deterrent against attack. Washington stopped real nuclear tests in 1992, a year after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

 Riots rock Thailand

 Bangkok, Oct. 25 (Reuters): At least two Muslim protesters were killed in southern Thailand today in clashes with security forces in the region?s worst violence in months, prompting the government to impose a night curfew.

 Dozens were wounded in the melee outside a police station in Narathiwat, one of three southern provinces where more than 360 people have been killed in violence since January.

 Thai television showed footage of soldiers in full riot gear firing water cannon and tear gas to disperse the 1,500 protesters who had surrounded Tak Bai police station since Monday morning.

 As the soldiers moved in, witnesses said shots were fired from the crowd.

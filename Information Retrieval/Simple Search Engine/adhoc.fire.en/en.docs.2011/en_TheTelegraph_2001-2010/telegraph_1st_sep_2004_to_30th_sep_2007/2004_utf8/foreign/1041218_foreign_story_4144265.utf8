 Fraud likely in Iraq polls: Iran cleric

 Tehran, Dec. 17 (Reuters): A leading hardline cleric in Shia Iran warned today of possible vote-rigging in next month?s Iraqi elections in the latest of a series of barbed exchanges between the two neighbours.

 Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, speaking after US President George W. Bush this week told Iran and Syria not to meddle in the forthcoming Iraqi vote, proposed that Iraqi clerics should supervise the January 30 vote to ensure it is fair.

 ?The possibility of fraud is very high in the Iraqi election. Iraqi clerics? comprehensive and strong supervision will protect peoples votes,? Jannati said in Tehran. Iraq?s interim government, whose Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and other key ministers are secular Shias, has accused Iran of backing insurgents.

 Osama oil threat

 Osama bin Laden has urged militants to concentrate their attacks on Iraqi and Gulf oil facilities, saying it was the most powerful weapon against America, said a transcript of a tape played on the Internet.

 ?Weakening America in Iraq economically, morally and through loss of life is a golden opportunity that you should not waste so not to have remorse,? said the tape.

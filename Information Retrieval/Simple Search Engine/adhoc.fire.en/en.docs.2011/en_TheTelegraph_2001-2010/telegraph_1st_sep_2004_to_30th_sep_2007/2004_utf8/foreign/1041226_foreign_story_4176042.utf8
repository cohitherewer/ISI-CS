 Osama kin probe widens

 Paris, Dec. 25 (Reuters): A French judge has widened a probe into the financial network surrounding the family of Osama bin Laden after questioning his half-brother and learning of a 241 million euro transfer to Pakistan, Le Monde daily said.

 Investigating magistrate Renaud Van Ruymbeke received court authorisation to extend his investigation after Yeslam bin Laden was questioned on September 27 over allegations of links with the organisers of attacks in 2001 in the US, the paper said in today?s edition.

 As a result, Van Ruymbeke was adding ?other instances of money laundering? to the probe already under way, Le Monde said. 

 On December 5, 2001, French authorities opened an investigation into financial transfers carried out through Paris between firms grouped within the Saudi Investment Company run by Yeslam bin Laden, who also manages some assets of the family?s Saudi Binladin Group.

 Yeslam bin Laden was questioned by the French judge in 2002, and has handed over a copy of documents detailing the distribution of the bin Laden family wealth to 54 brothers and sisters after the death of their father in 1967, the paper said.

 Although he denied having had any contact with his half- brother for the past 20 years, the paper said, documents held by Swiss banking authorities suggest that Yeslam and Osama bin Laden held a joint account in Switzerland between 1990 and 1997, according to Jean-Charles Brisard ? a private investigator hired by families of the victims of the September 11 attacks.

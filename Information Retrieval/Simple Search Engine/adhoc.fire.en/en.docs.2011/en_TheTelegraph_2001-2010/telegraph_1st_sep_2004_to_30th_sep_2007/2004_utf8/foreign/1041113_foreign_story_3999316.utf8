 Hugh Grant signals end to acting

 London, Nov. 12 (AP): Hugh Grant says he has lost interest in acting and is heading into retirement. 

 Grant, who plays heartthrob Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, was quoted yesterday by the Evening Standard?s Metro magazine as saying film acting is a ?miserable experience?. ?It?s so long and boring and so difficult to get right,? Grant said. ?I am sort of semi-retired,? he said. 

 ?I keep thinking I?m going to write a brilliant script... I?ve done bugger-all.? 

 Grant, who shot to fame playing the charming and foppish English man in films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Nine Months, gained international notoriety when he was caught in a car with prostitute divine brown in 1995. 

 The 44-year-old, who took new girlfriend Jemima, the former wife of Imran Khan, to this week?s Bridget Jones premiere, told the magazine he didn?t feel pressure to settle down.

 Reluctant Bono

 Bono was handed an award inducting him into the UK Music Hall of Fame in London. Minutes later the reluctant recipient joked that he was tempted to hand it back.

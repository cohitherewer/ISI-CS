 Madonna voice in kids? film 

 Madonna

 Paris, Oct. 22 (Reuters): Madonna will head the voice cast of the big-budget computer-animated Arthur, based on a series of children?s books written by French filmmaker Luc Besson, who will direct the project, sources said.

 The $80-million English-language project, scheduled for a 2006 release, follows 10-year-old Arthur who, in a bid to save his grandfather?s house from developers, goes in search of treasure hidden in the land of the Minimoys, a tiny people living in harmony with nature.

 Madonna is understood to be voicing the part of Princess Selenia, a character who travels with Arthur to a mysterious forbidden city where an evil being dwells.

 ?The recording is being done at the moment,? a production source said.

 The film will include some live-action sequences. 

 Arthur will be the first film directed by Besson since The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc five years ago.

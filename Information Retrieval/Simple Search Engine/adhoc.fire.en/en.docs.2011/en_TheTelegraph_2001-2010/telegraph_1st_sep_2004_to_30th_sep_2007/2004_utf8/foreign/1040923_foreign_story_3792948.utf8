 Iranian beating deal

 Tehran, Sept. 22 (AFP): An Iranian woman has taken her husband to court in a bid to secure a judicial order for him to beat her once once a week instead of every night, press reports said today.

 ?My husband is violent and beats me virtually every evening. I thought that he would stop after the birth of our child, but in fact it has got worse,? the woman, identified only as Maryam J, was quoted as saying in court by the Mardomsalari paper. ?I don?t want a divorce or compensation. My husband is violent. It is in his nature. I just want him to promise to beat me only once a week,? the woman argued, reportedly causing the judge and audience to burst out into laughter.

 Summoned to explain himself, the husband confessed to beating up his wife ?every evening?. ?I hit her because a wife should be afraid of her husband, and this way I oblige her to respect me,? said the man, who was not identified. According to the paper, the judge has demanded that the husband give a written assurance that he will stop beating his wife altogether. 

 Reckless monkey mania

 Kuala Lumpur (Reuters): A Malaysian man 

 shot his wife dead after he mistook her for a monkey picking 

 fruit in a tree behind their house, the New Straits Times 

 said on Wednesday. The man, 70, is being held by police 

 for causing death through recklessness after he fired a 

 shotgun at what he thought was a monkey in a mangosteen 

 tree on Monday, the newspaper said. His wife, 68, had used 

 a ladder to climb into the tree and was picking the tropical 

 fruit when she was shot.

 Waves of havoc in the past

 Washington, Dec. 29: The tsunamis that claimed thousands of lives across the Indian Ocean are the deadliest great waves in more than a century and probably in modern history. 

 More than 36,000 people were killed by tsunamis following the explosion of the volcano Krakatoa in the Sunda Strait near Java on August 27, 1883. Many estimates of the number killed in that disaster were even higher. 

 The toll from Sunday?s tsunamis has now topped 60,000 deaths in 11 nations. 

 Following the 1883 eruption, waves estimated as high as 90 feet slammed ashore on nearby islands, wiping out coastal communities in what is now Indonesia. 

 The earliest description of a tsunami-type wave comes from 479 B.C. in the northern part of the Aegean Sea. Similar waves have been reported worldwide, though they are more common in the Pacific. 

 Many historians believe the explosive eruption of Santorini in the Aegean Sea in 1500 B.C. caused a tsunami that brought widespread devastation to the eastern Mediterranean and Crete. Thousands of coastal residents in Spain, Portugal and North Africa were killed by waves spawned by an earthquake at Lisbon, Portugal, in 1755. 

 Over the centuries, Japan has been the land most plagued by tsunamis, with at least 66,000 deaths recorded there since A.D. 684. Among the deadliest tsunamis was one that struck Honshu, Japan, in 1896, killing an estimated 27,000. 

 On April 1, 1946, a Pacific-wide tsunami was generated by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake near Unimak Island in Alaska?s Aleutian Island chain. 

 A huge wave destroyed the US Coast Guard?s Scotch Cap lighthouse on Unimak, killing all five occupants. The lighthouse was a steel-reinforced concrete structure standing about 90 feet above sea level. That tsunami reached the Hawaiian Islands about five hours later. 

 Altogether, 165 people died, including children attending school at Hawaii?s Laupahoehoe Point, where waves reaching up to 25 feet struck. As a result, two years later the US established a Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii. 

 Other notable tsunamis have included: 

 August 16, 1976: A quake-generated tsunami on Mindinao in the Philippines killed 5,000-8,000 people in the Moro Gulf region. 

 March 28, 1964: A magnitude 8.4 quake in Alaska generated tsunamis that caused damage in southeastern Alaska, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and Washington, California and Hawaii.

 May 22, 1960: The largest earthquake ? magnitude 8.6 ? of the 20th century occurred off the coast of south central Chile, generating a Pacific-wide tsunami. 

 November 4, 1952: A strong earthquake off the coast of Russia?s Kamchatka Peninsula generated a great, destructive Pacific-wide tsunami.

 January 31, 1906: A strong tsunami struck the coast of Ecuador and Colombia, submerging half of Tumaco, Colombia, and washing away half of a nearby island. 

 August 13, 1868: A massive wave struck Chile, carrying ships as far as three miles inland at Arica. 

 April 2, 1868: A locally generated tsunami swept over the tops of palm trees and claimed 81 lives in Hawaii.

 Venice: Film fest or folly?

 Johnny Depp

 Venice, Sept. 12 (Reuters): The Venice Film Festival dazzled like never before this year with its string of Hollywood stars and hot arthouse directors, but the festival?s new chief may find delays and embarrassing blunders are what people remember.

 Marco Muller, a film producer and former director of the Locarno film festival, was named to organize the world?s oldest cinema competition just months before it was set to kick off.

 He wowed critics with his line-up, but producers, publicists and moviegoers who flocked to the Lido for the 61st edition of the festival say organisers bit off more than they could chew.

 ?We just weren?t able to make miracles even if we tried,? said Davide Croff, president of the Venice Biennale, which oversees the festival.

 At the height of the confusion, Al Pacino found himself without a seat at the premier of his own film, while Johnny Depp?s stroll down the red carpet for the screening of Finding Neverland was delayed by two hours until 2 am.

 Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein joked at the pre-dawn premiere that he would have his revenge on Muller. ?I?ll drown him in the lagoon, with his feet encased in cement,? he jested.

 At the awards ceremony last night, the presenter forgot to award the prize for best director and had to go back to it just before bestowing the Golden Lion on Vera Drake.

 Perhaps one of the most diplomatically delicate incidents, however, was the lengthy delay at the premiere of Malaysia?s most expensive film ever. 

 The crown prince and an entourage of musicians in traditional costume found a virtually empty theatre when the screening finally began well after midnight.

 The festival put on a free public show a week later in amends.

 A veteran European publicist called the festival ?amateur,? but officials said they are the victims of their own success.

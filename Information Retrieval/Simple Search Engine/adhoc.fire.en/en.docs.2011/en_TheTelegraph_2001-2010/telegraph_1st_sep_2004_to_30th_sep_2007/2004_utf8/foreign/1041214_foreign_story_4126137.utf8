 Former dictator?s hole in US hopes

 Dawr (Iraq), Dec. 13 (Reuters): 

 The hole where Saddam Hussein was found hiding a year ago 

 has not, as the US military hoped, been filled in, and a 

 two-room outhouse near the hideout is scrawled with pro-Saddam 

 graffiti.

 On the evening of December 13 last year, a haggard and bearded Saddam was pulled from the ?spider hole? on a farm south of his hometown of Tikrit and taken into US custody. A month later, US forces said they planned to fill in the hole to prevent it becoming a shrine.

 ?In order to avoid making it a tourist attraction and/or a shrine, we believe the best course of action is to eliminate it,? a military spokesman said at the time.

 But there was opposition to the idea from some Iraqi officials, who felt it was not up to the Americans to make such a decision, and a year on the hole, covered by a thick styrofoam slab with handles, remains right where it was.

 Trash is piled up in the corners of the hut, where last year soldiers found a suitcase with $750,000 in $100 bills and boxes of shoes.

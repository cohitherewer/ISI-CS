 Highway to Hell hits the road

 Melbourne, Oct. 1 (Reuters): 

 Australia hard rock band AC/DC may have angrily sang they 

 were on the Highway to Hell, but today a winding, 

 cobblestone lane in Melbourne was named after the band that 

 boasts more than 140 million album sales.

 ?Welcome to the Highway to Hell,? said AC/DC guitarist Angus Young in a statement issued to commemorate Corporation Lane changing its name to AC/DC Lane.

 In their famous song Highway to Hell, AC/DC sang: ?No stop signs, speed limit. Nobody?s gonna slow me down...Hey Satan, payin? my dues. Playin? in a rocking band?.

 But you?d be hard pressed to break the speed limit driving down AC/DC Lane or meeting Satan or hard rockers like the late lead singer Bon Scott, who died in 1980 after a drinking binge.

 The AC/DC Lane is a short, cobblestone lane which winds gently down to a nightclub called the ?Cherry Bar?, a retro dance club more suited to Nick Cave tunes and some old Johnny Cash. 

 The tiny lane eventually branches off a busy retail sector.

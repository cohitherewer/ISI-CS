 Diana tape reveals love trauma

 Princess Diana

 New York, Dec. 1 (Reuters): Princess Diana was ?traumatised? by Prince Charles? refusal to publicly declare his love for her on the day of their engagement and became bulimic to punish herself for their failed marriage.

 Diana vented her feelings about her life and the British royal family in a videotape made in 1992 by her public speaking coach, former actor Peter Settelen, and broadcast on Monday for the first time in an NBC News special.

 The princess, who was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, discussed her childhood, marriage to Charles, whom she divorced in 1996, and struggle with bulimia in the one-hour programme. Diana spoke of an early warning about Prince Charles? commitment to her during a ?ghastly? TV interview they did in 1981 on the day they announced their engagement to the world.

 ?This ridiculous ITN man said: ?Are you in love?? So I thought: ?Oh, what a thick question,?? she said. ?And Charles turned around and said: ?Whatever ?in love? means.? And that threw me completely,? she said. ?God. Absolutely traumatised me.?

 Diana expressed frustration with family members she turned to during troubled times of the marriage.

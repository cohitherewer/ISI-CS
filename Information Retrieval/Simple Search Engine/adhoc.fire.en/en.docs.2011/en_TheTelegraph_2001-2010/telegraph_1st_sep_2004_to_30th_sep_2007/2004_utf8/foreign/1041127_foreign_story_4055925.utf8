 Bestselling writer of Airport dead

 Nassau (Bahamas), Nov. 26 (Reuters): Top-selling British author Arthur Hailey, whose novels sold 170 million copies around the world, died in his sleep at his Bahamas home, his wife said today. He was 84.

 The author of several bestsellers that became blockbuster movies, like Airport and Hotel, had been ailing since suffering a stroke two months ago. But he had enjoyed dinner with two of his six children just a few hours before he died.

 ?He had a wonderful life. His greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that,? said his wife Sheila. Born in Luton, England, in 1920 as the only child of working class parents, Hailey began writing after World War II, when a meal served on a DC-4 flight triggered a story idea that was to propel him to fortune.

 He began to wonder what would happen if the flight crew went down with food poisoning and penned his story Flight Into Danger ? the first of his successful works. Hollywood producers bought several of his books and he flirted with script writing himself. He was known for his intricate research and wanted his readers to be entertained.

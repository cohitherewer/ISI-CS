 Iraq kidnap

 Baghdad, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Militants piled more pressure on Washington?s military allies in Iraq today, seizing a Polish woman and holding a Japanese man under death threat.

 With a British-Iraqi aid worker already in captivity, Iraq?s hostage crisis has intensified amid growing expectations of a US offensive on the rebel cities of Falluja and Ramadi. Iraq?s US-backed interim government has vowed to pacify the whole country before nationwide elections due in January.

 Al Jazeera television showed a video of an elderly woman seated between two masked men, one pointing a gun to her head. A hitherto unknown Islamist group said the woman was a Pole working for US forces in Iraq and demanded the withdrawal of Polish troops and the release of Iraqi women prisoners.

 Poland?s defence minister said the woman was not part of the Polish military contingent in Iraq and vowed not to bow to her captor?s terms. Al Jazeera quoted the hostage, who wore an orange polka dot outfit, as saying she had worked in Iraq for a long time. Poland has 2,500 soldiers in Iraq.

 US lawyers sharpen knives for legal battle

 Washington, Oct. 20: The ballots have yet to be counted, much less recounted. But attorneys for President Bush and John F. Kerry are already engaged in an intense legal battle for the presidency that could once again give the courts a say in who is declared the winner. 

 With less than two weeks to go before Election Day, an unprecedented number of lawsuits challenging basic election rules are pending in many of the battleground states. Both sides are in the final stages of training thousands of lawyers who will descend on the polls on November 2 to watch for voter fraud or intimidation. 

 Each campaign has teams of attorneys ready in the event of a recount in one or more states.

 Both are hitting up donors to pay the legal tabs in case there is a disputed outcome that leaves the winner in doubt after the polls close. 

 Four years after the election between Bush and then-vice-president Al Gore deadlocked in Florida and produced a 36-day legal whirlwind ultimately decided by the US Supreme Court, courtroom battles have become as routine a part of the campaign as rallies and television ads. 

 The result, experts say, is a race shaping up to be the most litigious in US history. 

 ?Bush vs Gore really let the genie out of the bottle,? said Richard . Hasen, an election law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. ?Election law has become just another part of the political strategy of the parties.?

 Both sides say they have assembled what amounts to the largest virtual law firms in the country, relying on new volunteers as well as old hands who cut their teeth in the 2000 recount. 

 In Florida, the Kerry team is headed by Miami lawyer Steven Zack, whose partner, David Boies, argued Gore?s case before the US Supreme Court in 2000. Bush?s Florida team is headed by Hayden Dempsey, who in 2000 worked as a lawyer for Florida governor Jeb Bush. 

 Nationwide, the Democrats plan to have more than 10,000 lawyers standing by at the polls in battleground states to identify and address voting problems.

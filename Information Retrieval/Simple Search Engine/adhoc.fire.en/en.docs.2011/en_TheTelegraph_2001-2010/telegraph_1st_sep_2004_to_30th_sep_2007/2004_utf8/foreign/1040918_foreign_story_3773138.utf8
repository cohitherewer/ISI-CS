 King of Pop in court

 Santa Maria, California, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Surrounded by members of his famous family and dressed in white, Michael Jackson arrived in court today for a key face-to-face encounter with the mother of the boy he is accused of molesting.

 Dozens of fans screamed and cheered as Jackson, his mother and several of his siblings entered the courthouse where his attorney will question the woman who once allowed her son to have sleepovers with the ?King of Pop? but who now accuses Jackson of being the devil. The mother of Jackson?s accuser ? a woman identified in court only as ?Jane Doe? ? was called to testify by the singer?s attorneys, who want to exclude from the trial evidence seized from the offices of private investigator Brad Miller. 

 Deny sex, invite abuse

 Madrid (Reuters): A Spanish man tried 

 to have his wife charged with domestic abuse because she 

 refused to have sex with him on five consecutive days, Spanish 

 newspaper El Sur reported on Friday. The middle-aged 

 man from Seville ? the city of Don Juan and Carmen ? said 

 her refusals amounted to ?degrading treatment? and domestic 

 abuse, a term used more often to describe wife-battering. 

 The judge shelved the case, Andalusia-based El Sur reported.

 Silent whisper

 London (Reuters): A bout of laryngitis has forced singer George Michael to pull out of Sunday?s breast cancer awareness concert organised by ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell. ?He?s devastated to miss the show after all the hard work she?s put into it,? said an aide to the former Wham! singer. Michael, whose hits included Careless Whisper, is planning to release a single in late October.

 Arnie ad for California

 Tokyo, Nov. 11: With California nearly broke, governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is touting a money-making idea to help the state reopen its Tokyo trade office: starring in a Japanese commercial. 

 While leading a four-day trade mission here, Schwarzenegger said he may accept one of the many multimillion-dollar offers he receives to make commercials for Japanese television. But instead of pocketing the money, he would plow it into an office to push California?s business interests. 

 Schwarzenegger, a familiar figure to the Japanese, having appeared in several television ads while a movie star, described how the plan would work. He would ?do a quick spot and make a few million dollars and take that money and open up an office and not have to worry about our budget.?

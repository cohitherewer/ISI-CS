 Ukraine court throws out PM?s complaints

 Kiev, Dec. 30 (Reuters): Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich?s dogged bid to overturn his liberal rival?s victory in Ukraine?s presidential election all but collapsed today after the Supreme Court threw out all his complaints.

 With West-leaning Viktor Yushchenko already discussing his post-election programme and holding a lead of about eight percentage points in the preliminary count, the Prime Minister has vowed never to concede defeat.

 He has refused to bow to demands from his opponents to step down as Premier and an aide has said he plans to file further legal challenges once the polls result is officially published.

 Supreme Court spokeswoman Liana Shlyaposhnikova said judges had now rejected all four complaints submitted by Yanukovichs team concerning the organisation of last Sunday?s re-run of the November 21 poll, which had been rigged in Yanukovichs favour.

 ?The last complaint will not be considered. All four complaints were rejected,? she said, adding that two were filed too late and two were not clearly drawn up.

 Parliament?s speaker, a key figure in resolving weeks of turmoil, congratulated Yushchenko on his victory. And he told Ukrainians that the protests against fraud which led to his election proved they had at last created a true civil society. 

 Yushchenko has begun setting down the aims of an administration he says will encourage business, uproot corruption and improve ties with western Europe.

 But, in a sign of possible trouble ahead, autocratic Turkmenistan announced it was suspending vital natural gas supplies as of January 1 in a row over pricing.

 The Central Asian state supplies nearly half of Ukraine?s gas needs.

 Although few doubt that Yushchenko will emerge the winner, the Central Election Commission began examining 27 volumes of irregularities, submitted by Yanukovich. They effectively postpone a formal announcement of Yushchenko?s victory.

 The head of the commission has described Yanukovich?s complaints as an attempt to draw an impartial body into politics. Yushchenko predicted they would be quickly dismissed.

 Commission officials said many complaints they had received from individual voters appeared to have been drafted by the same person or group and lacked sufficient documentation.

 In congratulating Yushchenko, speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn said the election outcome would open a new era in Ukraines history, ?above all in forming and consolidating an honest, transparent system of power directly linked to the people?.

 And in a New Year message to Ukrainians, he said: ?We have become witnesses and participants in the birth of a civil society.?

 Lytvyn spearheaded parliaments efforts to strike a deal to call the new election after weeks of mass protests and a Supreme Court decision to annul Yanukovichs victory in the November 21 poll on grounds of fraud.

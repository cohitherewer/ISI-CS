 Punjab boost to general

 Islamabad, Sept. 14 (PTI): The Punjab Assembly in Pakistan has adopted a resolution urging President Pervez Musharraf not to quit as army chief by the end of this year in the face of strong protests from Opposition parties.

 The Assembly, dominated by the ruling, pro-military Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam), adopted the resolution last night asking Musharraf to keep both the presidency and the post of army chief despite Opposition protests that he quit the military post. The Opposition parties have charged that the resolution is an attempt by the pro-military politicians to continue in power with the support of the generals.

 The resolution urged Musharraf to reject the agreement with the Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA) alliance. As per the pact with Musharraf, the MMA had supported the Pakistan President?s constitutional amendments on the assurance that Musharraf would step down as army chief by the end of this year.

 Similar resolutions are expected to be adopted by the Sindh Assembly and the Parliament, where the ruling alliance has a majority. The resolutions adopted by the prominent legislatures in the country are expected to provide political legitimacy to Musharraf ahead of his address to the UN General Assembly session in New York. During the past few months, Musharraf had openly indicated that he had second thoughts about removing his army uniform citing the unstable domestic political situation as a reason for not doing so.

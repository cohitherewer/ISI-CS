 Japan confronts life without Godzilla

 Could Tokyo finally be safe? Godzilla, the movie monster that terrorised the city in a series of films over 50 years, is set to stomp off into the sunset for what may be the last time. 

 After the release this month of Godzilla: Final Wars, Toho Pictures has decided to mothball the great green one, uncertain when, if ever, it?ll return to the big screen. 

 Japan?s largest film star has disappeared before ? going into hibernation for a decade in the mid-1970s ? only to come back with a vengeance after a grass-roots movement by fans nudged Toho into reviving the celebrity city smasher. But after 28 films over a half-century, even Godzilla?s makers concede that one of the longest-running film franchises in history appears to be losing steam. 

 In recent years, the ageing lizard?s movies have drawn about half the audiences they used to, barely covering production costs. Even the big-budget Hollywood version of Godzilla in 1998 was a monstrous box office bomb. 

 ?The choices for kids are more varied now and they are watching the cuter monsters, like the ones from Pokemon,? lamented Toho Pictures President Shogo Tomiyama. 

 ?If Godzilla does come back, it will be in the hands of another generation of movie directors.?

 Even the possibility of an end to the Godzilla franchise is a landmark moment for Japan. Here, Godzilla ? who roared to life in 1954 as a terrible lizard awakened from a 2 million-year slumber by US nuclear testing in the South Pacific ? was far more than a kitschy creature. Rather, it was a complex metaphor, the embodiment of uniquely Japanese fears in the only nation ever to experience the horror of a nuclear attack. 

 Godzilla?s boil-covered flesh called to mind the radiation victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The subtext of its rage ? taking vengeance on mankind for devising the nuclear bomb ? expressed the frustration of a nation subjected to, and later protected by, American military might. 

 But unlike King Kong, Godzilla was no tragic giant, no Darwinian leftover done in by humanity. Instead, in the vast majority of its films, Godzilla survived man?s best attempts to defeat it, leaving in its wake a grisly tableau of the Tokyo skyline as a reminder of the terrifying consequences of military science. 

 ?Godzilla was and is a powerful anti-war statement,? said Toshio Takahashi, professor of modern literature at Tokyo?s Waseda University and author of three books on Godzilla symbolism. 

 ?Besides that, he is a mirror into the Japanese soul.?

 In the US, Godzilla films have been mostly low-tech, sci-fi fun, their bad dubbing and hysterical scenes of panicked Tokyoites fleeing down rubble-strewn city streets offering a plethora of material for humourists. 

 Critics, however, tend to be kinder in the twilight of a star?s career, and Godzilla?s potential demise is sparking global eulogies fit for the most revered legends of the silver screen. Academics at the University of Kansas, for instance, held a major Godzilla conference in October. Last month, Hollywood offered up to Godzilla its own gold star on the Walk of Fame. 

 Back home, reverence to the lizard god of Japanese cinema has reached gigantic proportions. Godzilla has landed on dozens of magazine covers. A flurry of books ? including academic studies by leading ?Godzillaologists? ? have hit bookstore shelves. A new tribute CD ? G. LASTS ... Tribute to Godzilla 50th ? came out recently. Exhibitions on the era of Godzilla have opened at two major Japanese museums. In Hiroshima, a peace movie festival in 2005 to mark the 60th year after the atomic bombing will prominently feature the first Godzilla movie 

 ?It may be hard for many Americans to grasp the significance of Godzilla in Japan,? said Peter Musolf, a Tokyo-based writer. ?America is not a country that faced nuclear attack, and from the beginning, that anti-nuclear message was kept from American audiences.?

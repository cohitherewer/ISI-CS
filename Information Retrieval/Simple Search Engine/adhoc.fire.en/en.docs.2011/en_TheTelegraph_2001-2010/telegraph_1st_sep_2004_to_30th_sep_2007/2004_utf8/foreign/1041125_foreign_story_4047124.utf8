 Book reveals Britain?s dreaded ?stage police?

 Samuel Beckett

 London, Nov. 24 (Reuters): Never show Jesus Christ or Queen Victoria. Do not blaspheme or mention homosexuality.

 Anyone harming friendly relations with a foreign power is in trouble. Anything likely to cause a breach of the peace could bring the curtain down. It is a miracle any plays ever made it to the British stage, so strict were the rules laid down by the Lord Chamberlain, a senior member of the royal household who acted as Britain?s official censor.

 Now, for the first time, his records are being published, revealing the judgments of the ex-military officers turned ?stage police? that he hired to read every script.

 The 200-year-old office of the Lord Chamberlain had to check each new play before it was staged in Britain until 1968, when censorship was abolished.

 ?The whole thing was a tragi-comedy,? professor of English Dominic Shellard said. His book: The Lord Chamberlain Regrets was launched today. The censors were blunt and ruthless.

 Samuel Beckett?s Waiting for Godot was labelled ?an interminable verbal labyrinth? by censors who demanded that the Nobel prize-winning playwright replace one ?fart? with a ?belch.? Swear words were swiftly excised.

 John Osborne?s Look Back In Anger, the kitchen sink drama that spelled the end for genteel drawing room comedies, was in trouble too for foul language. References to pubic hair were cut from the text.

 As for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Tennessee Williams was lambasted for ?vomiting up the recurring theme of his not-too-subconscious where the gentlewoman is debased.?

 Shellard also felt many playwrights imposed self-censorship for fear of the Lord Chamberlain?s axe.

 While bizarre examples abound, serious politics were also at play.

 ?In 1938, the Lord Chamberlain didn?t want any plays passed that would insult a friendly power. Terence Rattigan wrote a satire on Hitler called Follow Your Leader, but because we liked Hitler in the early part of 1938, it was considered rude to him. By 1939 the censors readers decided they had made a terrible mistake and it was a great success,? Shellard said.

 Plays were not allowed any blasphemy, but that posed problems.

 ?You could not mention the deity on stage. That got them into difficulty with the Mystery Plays which had God in them and Satan on stage,? he said.

 Playwrights could not mention a member of the royal family unless they had been dead for 50 years.

 ?In 1948, several playwrights wanted to write about Queen Victoria and her gamekeeper John Brown. The Lord Chamberlain banned them out of hand as this could be damaging to the monarchy,? Shellard said.

 Homosexuality was also firmly off limits?which was a bit ironic as the theatre was so hospitable to gay people.?

 The beginning of the end came when the Lord Chamberlain sought a prosecution in 1965 over Edward Bond?s play Saved in which a baby was battered to death in a pram.

 ?Star witnesses included Laurence Olivier. The judge ruled the theatre guilty but fined them only two guineas. The government soon decided censorship was untenable,? Shellard said of an institution whose demise was mourned by few.

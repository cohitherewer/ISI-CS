 Lottery spin to Iraq ballot

 Ashraf Qazi

 Baghdad, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Spinning a big perspex drum filled with balls, not unlike a national lottery, Iraq?s Electoral Commission determined today where competing parties will rank on the ballot paper for the January 30 election.

 More than 200 parties, blocs and individuals have signed up to contest the poll ? around 7,700 candidates in all ? and the order they appear on the ballot sheet, which could be many pages thick, will be determined by chance.

 UN envoy to Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, pulled the first balls from the drum, as hundreds of candidates looked on expectantly, in a process designed for maximum transparency in the country?s first democratic election in nearly 50 years.

 ?Today is a great day in the history of your great nation,? Qazi told a crowd gathered in a room at a conference centre that used to be part of Saddam Hussein?s presidential complex. 

 ?It is truly in the interests of every Iraqi citizen, whatever their political views, to participate in this electoral process. It is the only way forward.?

 Iraq is being treated as a single electoral district. Registered voters will choose either an individual, party or coalition list of candidates, and seats in the 275-seat national Assembly will be distributed by proportional representation.

 The system, chosen with UN help, is designed to encourage the formation of alliances and coalitions that try to appeal across Iraq?s spread of ethnic and religious groups.

 Since the electorate, which is expected to be anywhere between 10- and 14-million strong, is inexperienced when it comes to democratic elections, the order in which names appear on the ballot may have some influence on voting patterns. 

 If around 10 million people end up voting, braving what is expected to be intense intimidation from insurgents not to do so, it would require around 36,000 votes to win one seat.

 Pak concern

 Pakistan hopes elections in Iraq will lead to a broad-based government there including all political and religious groups, its foreign minister told his Iraqi counterpart today.

 In a meeting with Iraqi foreign minister Hoshiyar Zebari in Islamabad, Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri expressed ?deep concern? about the security situation in Iraq, a Pakistani statement said.

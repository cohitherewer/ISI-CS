 Deuba in new talks appeal

 Kathmandu, Sept. 23 (Reuters): Nepal?s Prime Minister has made a fresh appeal to Maoist rebels to join peace talks to end an insurgency that has killed thousands of people and said the dialogue could be held in secret.

 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba?s invitation to the rebels, who are fighting to replace Nepal?s constitutional monarchy with communist rule, came late yesterday after a meeting of a peace committee formed to try to end the revolt. ?We have decided to officially call the Maoists for talks,? Deuba said.

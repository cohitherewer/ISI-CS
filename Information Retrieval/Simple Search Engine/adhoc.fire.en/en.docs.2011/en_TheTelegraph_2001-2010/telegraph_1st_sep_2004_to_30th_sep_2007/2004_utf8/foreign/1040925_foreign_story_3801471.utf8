 Palace caught napping

 London, Sept. 24 (Reuters): A journalist posing as a workman entered a private area of Queen Elizabeth?s official Scottish residence in the latest breach of royal security, the newspaper behind the stunt said today.

 The Sunday Times newspaper said one of its reporters wearing a hard hat gained access to state rooms adjacent to the queen?s bedroom in the turreted Palace of Holyroodhouse in the Scottish capital, Edinburgh, yesterday. 

 He waited there for 20 minutes before he was finally challenged by security guards, the paper said.

 The stunt has refocussed attention on security at the heart of Britain?s seats of power following a series of high-profile breaches this month.

 The paper said it decided to test the palace?s security before a visit by heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles this weekend and before the queen stays there following the official opening of the Scottish parliament building in Edinburgh on October 9.

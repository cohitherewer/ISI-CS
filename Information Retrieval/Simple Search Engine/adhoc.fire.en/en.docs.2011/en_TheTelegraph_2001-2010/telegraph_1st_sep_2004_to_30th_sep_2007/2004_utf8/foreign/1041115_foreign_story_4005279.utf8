 Falluja battle blocks aid

 Falluja, Nov. 14 (Reuters): No food. No water. No help. As fierce fighting casts a pall of smoke over the rubble-strewn Iraqi city of Falluja, thousands of Iraqi families remain cut off from desperately needed supplies. 

 Seven Red Crescent trucks and ambulances have reached the main hospital on the western outskirts, but it is still too dangerous for them to cross the Euphrates river to bring help to locals, including hundreds of children, cut off for six days. 

 ?Our situation is very hard,? said one resident contacted by telephone in the central Hay al-Dubat neighbourhood today.

 ?We don?t have food or water. My seven children all have severe diarrhoea. One of my sons was wounded by shrapnel last night and he?s bleeding, but I can?t do anything to help him.?

 The man, who gave his name only as Abu Mustafa, said he had seen US troops and Iraqi national guards in his street as explosions rang out. ?There were bodies lying in the street.?

 Abu Mustafa said he knew of six families nearby in a similar plight, but then broke down in tears. 

 ?We are still fasting, though it is the Id (end of Ramazan feast) today. Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar (God is great).?

 Aid groups describe the situation in Falluja, where US and Iraqi troops launched a full-scale military offensive last Monday to crush insurgents, as a humanitarian disaster.

 Up to half Falluja?s 300,000 people fled during daily air strikes in the countdown to the assault, but thousands remain trapped as fighting rages around them.

 There are no statistics on the number of civilians killed or wounded in the fighting, only personal accounts of pain, hunger and fear from those trapped in the city.

 Some locals say the stench of decomposing bodies fills the air. Others tell of children dying because it was too dangerous to get them to help.

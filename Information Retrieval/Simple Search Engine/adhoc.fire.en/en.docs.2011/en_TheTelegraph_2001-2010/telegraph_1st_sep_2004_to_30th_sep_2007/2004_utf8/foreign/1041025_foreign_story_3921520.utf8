 Angry Harry not to say ?sorry?

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 Prince Harry

 London, Oct. 24: Prince Harry will not apologise to the photographer involved in a scuffle with him outside a nightclub because his father?s private office blames the ?aggressive? behaviour of the paparazzi for the incident last week.

 Paddy Harverson, the communications secretary at Clarence House, said that the Prince had been ?monstered? and ?completely submerged? by photographers as he left the Pangaea nightclub in the West End of London shortly after 3 am on Thursday.

 Harverson admitted for the first time that Prince Harry, 20, had lost his temper after being accidentally ?smacked in the head? by a camera, but said the Prince of Wales had been ?supportive and sympathetic? towards his younger son.

 When asked if there would be an apology to the photographer involved, Harverson replied: ?It certainly seems to be the month for apologies, but no, I don?t think that it really requires that. I think it is fairly straightforward. OK, he lost his temper. It does happen. Let?s not get it out of all proportions

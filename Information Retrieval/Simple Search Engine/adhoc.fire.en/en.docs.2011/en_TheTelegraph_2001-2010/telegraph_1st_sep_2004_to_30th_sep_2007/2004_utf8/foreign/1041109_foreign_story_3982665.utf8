 Havana, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Cubans saw President Fidel Castro in a wheelchair yesterday in television images that showed the Cuban leader looking rested after shattering his left knee and fracturing his right arm in a fall on October 20.

 News broadcasts showed Castro holding an eight-hour meeting with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Saturday night, while sitting in a wheelchair with his plastered leg extended and his arm in a sling.

 Since his fall, Castro, 78, had previously been seen only once on television, which showed him from the chest up.

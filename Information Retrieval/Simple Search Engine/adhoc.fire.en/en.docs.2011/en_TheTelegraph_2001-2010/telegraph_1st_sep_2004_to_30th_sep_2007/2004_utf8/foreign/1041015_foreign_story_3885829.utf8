 China, Russia end border row

 Beijing, Oct. 14 (Agencies): China and Russia today resolved the last of their decades-old boundary dispute with Chinese President Hu Jintao and visiting Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin finalising the delimitation of their 4,370 km-long eastern border.

 According to diplomatic sources, the Chinese and Russian sides inked a series of accords including an additional agreement on the eastern stretch of the Russia-Chinese border which was not resolved previously. The disputed area was in the region of Heixiazi island and Abagaitu islet in the eastern section of the Sino-Russian boundary line. The two countries have been negotiating to reach a settlement for a long time. 

 The length of the Sino-Russian border is about 4,370 km. Of that, the eastern section accounts for about 4,320 km and the western 54 km. 

 The two countries signed 13 agreements after the meeting, including a joint declaration signed by Hu and Putin in which they supported a common, tough position against terrorism. ?There is no place for double standards in the struggle against terrorism. International terrorism can be only exterminated by joint efforts of all states,? the declaration said.

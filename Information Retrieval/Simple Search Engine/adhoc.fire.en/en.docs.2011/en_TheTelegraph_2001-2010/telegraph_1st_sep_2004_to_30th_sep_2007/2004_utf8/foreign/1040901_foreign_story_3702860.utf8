 9/11 on Bush camps lips

 New York, Aug. 31 (Reuters): John McCain and Rudolph Giuliani kicked off the Republican convention yesterday with an impassioned tribute to President George W. Bushs wartime leadership and said his response to the September 11, 2001, attacks proved his strength as commander-in- chief.

 At the conventions opening session, Republicans repeatedly invoked the memory of the attacks and described them as the proving ground where Bush grew to meet, in McCains words, the test of our generation.

 He has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time, and I salute him, the Arizona Senator said, describing the war on terror as a fight between right and wrong, good and evil.

 For his determination to undertake it, and for his unflagging resolve to see it through to a just end, President Bush deserves not only our support but our admiration, said McCain, Bushs bitter rival in the 2000 Republican presidential race but now a strong supporter.

 Giuliani, the former New York mayor whose leadership after the attacks elevated him to a national figure, compared Bushs fight against terror to British Prime Minister Winston Churchills battle with Nazi Germany and US President Ronald Reagans opposition to the Soviet Union.

 Like President Bush, they were optimists; leaders must be optimists, Giuliani said. Some call it stubbornness. I call it principled leadership.

 Republicans are holding their convention to nominate Bush for a second term in New York, less than 7 km from the gaping hole where the World Trade Center once stood, to showcase the Presidents leadership after the attacks.

 Three survivors of attack victims gave emotional testimonials to delegates and Giuliani vividly described the day, calling the inferno at the World Trade Center the flames of hell. He said the attacks had forced Americans to confront the reality of terror that had grown unchecked over recent decades.

 Terrorists, he said, had learned over the years they could intimidate the world community and too often the response, particularly in Europe, was accommodation, appeasement and compromise.

 Republicans led by Giuliani also took swipes at Bushs Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, drawing a contrast with the President and accusing Kerry of taking both sides of issues like the war on Iraq.

 President Bush sees world terrorism for the evil that it is, Giuliani said. John Kerry has no such clear, precise and consistent vision.

 McCain, a friend of Kerry and a fellow Vietnam War veteran, refused to join the Kerry bashing and said he was fortunate to call many Democrats his friends.

 But he defended the war in Iraq, saying that even if Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, the stated reason for going to war, he would have acquired them again.

 Our choice wasnt between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war. It was between war and a graver threat, he said. Only the most deluded of us could doubt the necessity of this war. The delegates opened the convention in an upbeat mood, with a flurry of new polls showed Bush gaining ground and slightly leading Kerry nationally.

 Bush, on a week-long tour of key swing states on his way to his arrival in New York tomorrow, told a rally in New Hampshire he was filled with absolute determination and resolve to defend the US. You know where I stand: I believe that we must never yield, Bush said at an event in Nashua.

 On the streets outside, the pace of protests slowed dramatically after hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched through the citys streets on Sunday. The homeless and people living with the HIV virus or AIDS protested against Bushs economic policies. At a rally outside UN headquarters, about 1,000 people held up signs saying: The Poor Will Be Heard.

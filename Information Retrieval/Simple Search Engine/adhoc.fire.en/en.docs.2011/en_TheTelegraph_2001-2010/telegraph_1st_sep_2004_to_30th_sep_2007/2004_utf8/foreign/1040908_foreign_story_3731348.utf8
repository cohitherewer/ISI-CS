 Parties slam Pervez bid to stay army chief

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 7: Pakistan Opposition parties today hit back at President Pervez Musharrafs suggestion that he might continue as army chief beyond December 2004 as most Pakistanis want him to continue in that post.

 Two Opposition alliances, the Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA) and the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy (ARD), expressed their outrage after Musharraf told the private Ary One TV channel on Monday night that ninety six per cent Pakistanis wanted him to continue as army chief.

 Ninety six per cent Pakistanis want me to continue as the army chief and I dont think that even the West or the US will show any adverse reaction, he had quickly replied when asked how the Americans or the western democracies would react to his decision.

 MMA and ARD leaders accused Musharraf of trying to subvert the constitution and threatened a countrywide movement against him.

 MMA president Qazi Hussain Ahmed blamed Musharraf for violating a deal he had struck with the MMA last year in return for the latters support in parliament for a package of constitutional reforms. 

 Following Musharrafs assurance to resign as army chief by December 31,2004, the parliament approved with a majority the controversial Legal Framework Order which is also called the 17th amendment.

 However, it seems Musharrafs internal compulsions may have forced him to review his earlier commitment. The general will be responsible for subverting the constitution if he does not quit as army chief, Hussein said.

 The MMAs supreme council will meet in Quetta later this month to discuss the latest development.

 A PPP leader also reminded the President that December 31, 2004, was the cut-off date for him to quit as army chief. Raza Rabbani, who represents his party in the Senate, said the ARD would soon convene a meeting to finalise its future course of action.

 Bush is ?villain of year?

 London, Oct. 28 (Reuters): 

 President Bush may see himself as defender of democracy 

 and compassionate conservatism but British film fans have 

 voted him ?Movie Villain of the Year.?

 The American ?Axis of Evil? fighter is wooing voters with security pledges ahead of the presidential election next week, but it was Bush?s role in Michael Moores anti-war film Fahrenheit 9/11 that won him the villainous title.

 In a poll for Total Film magazine, the US leader fought off competition from such well-known baddies as atomic scientist Doctor Octopus from Spider-Man 2. ?The overwhelming response of our readers voting Bush top villain just goes to show how frightening people found him in Fahrenheit 9/11,? Total Film?s editor Matt Mueller said.

 ?Give us back US we loved?

 John le Carre

 Los Angeles, Oct. 21 (Reuters): 

 British spy novelist John le Carre yesterday denounced President 

 George W. Bush as universally hated abroad and urged Americans 

 to ?give us back the America we loved.?

 There was perhaps only one reason to vote for Bush on November 2 and that was ?to force him to live with the consequences of his appalling actions and answer for his own lies,? Le Carre said.

 In a no-invective-spared commentary for the Los Angeles Times, the novelist said it might be preferable for Bush to be re-elected than ?a Democrat who would then get blamed for his predecessor?s follies.?

 ?Probably no American President in history has been so universally hated abroad as Bush,? wrote Le Carre, author of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and other novels, many of which were set in the Cold War period.

 The 73-year-old author added: ?Give us back the America we loved, and your friends will be waiting for you. Here in Britain, for as long as we have Tony Blair singing the same lies as George W. Bush, your nightmares will be ours.?

 Earlier this month, Le Carre took part in a letter writing campaign sponsored by the Guardian newspaper in which Britons urged voters in the swing state of Ohio not to back Bush. Recent polls have shown Europeans overwhelmingly oppose Bush.

 Le Carre, whose last novel Absolute Friends made no secret of his contempt for the Bush administration, attacked US policy in the run-up to the Iraq war with a January 2003 article in the London Times which said the US had ?entered one of its periods of historical madness.?

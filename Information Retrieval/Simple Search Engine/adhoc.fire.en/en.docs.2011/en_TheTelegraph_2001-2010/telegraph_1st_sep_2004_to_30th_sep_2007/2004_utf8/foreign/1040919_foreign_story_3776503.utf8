 Wimbledon: film amp; the turf

 HUGH DAVIES

 Kirsten Dunst

 London, Sept. 18: They 

 may be Britain?s most successful filmmakers, behind a string 

 of hits such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget 

 Jones?s Diary but that cut no ice with Eddie Seaward, 

 the head groundsman at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet 

 Club.

 When the Working Title team decided to base its latest romantic comedy around the Wimbledon championships they first had to deal with Seaward and his worries about the hallowed turf.

 Paul Bettany, who plays the lead role in the ?20 million film out next week alongwith Kirsten Dunst, said: ?They were like eccentric old English gentlemen, Home Counties old duffers, obviously with minds like a steel trap and, to be honest, they were entirely unimpressed by the idea, which was sort of lovely. They were really precious about their lawn and so they should be.?

 The filmmakers eventually were given the right to use the Centre Court for filming but only after agreeing to a number of strict terms.

 Richard Loncraine, the director, said: ?They were initially quite reticent and a bit nervous, as there had been a couple of films made about Wimbledon that were not exactly wonderful.?

 He said that the centre court was ?so enormous and high? that a company that specialised in rock shows roofed over the area in clear white silk and black material to keep the audience in the stands in shadow and the players in sunlight. ?It was hard to shoot,? he said. ?We could not give the crew Coca Cola because if you spill it on the grass it kills the turf. ?

 The sequence on the Centre Court was filmed last year, prior to a game featuring Tim Henman. Bettany said: ?We had six minutes to shoot before his match started. All we did was walk out, sit down, take a racket out. We didn?t play, thank God.?

 ?What I remember is that little cupboard underneath the umpire. It is a Wimbledon tradition to have two shots of brandy there for gentlemen who have a few nerves.

 ?You have to suspend your belief, as it?s about an Englishman doing well at a sport. It is a very hard film to hate.?

 Bettany, whose journeyman character dramatically advances through the championship, said: ?I didn?t know how to play tennis. Fortunately, what was going in my favour, was that the director knew nothing about tennis too.?

 Loncraine, who directed The Gathering Storm with Albert Finney and Vanessa Redgrave, said: ?Tennis is not the most photogenic of activities. I had a theory of about how to film it, trying to make it something between MTV and a Nike advert.

 ?I?ve done lots of ads. I wasn?t a sports fan. I knew almost nothing about tennis. Paul developed a very powerful service but not terribly accurate. You could be standing behind him and get hit.?

 Despite their previous success, Working Title needs a hit because its last picture, Thunderbirds, recouped just ?14 million of its ?36 million cost. But, despite appearances in the film by John McEnroe and intensive training by Pat Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, the knives appear to be out.

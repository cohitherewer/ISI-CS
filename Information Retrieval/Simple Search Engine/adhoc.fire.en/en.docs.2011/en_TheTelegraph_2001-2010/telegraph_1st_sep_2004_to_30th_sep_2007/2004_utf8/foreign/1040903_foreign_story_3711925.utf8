 Ex-cops hanged for Bangla rape

 Dhaka, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Two former policemen convicted of the rape and killing of a teenager were executed by hanging in a north Bangladesh jail early today.

 Senior prison official Mohammad Azizul Haque said it was the first time that a member of Bangladeshs police force had been hanged.

 The two, Moinul Haq and Abdus Sattar, were hanged one minute past (yesterday) midnight, he said at the Rangpur jail, 350 km north of Dhaka, where the sentences were carried out. The incident in the northern town of Dinajpur in 1995 sparked protests across the country, forcing the authorities to arrest the accused and put them on trial.

 Accompanied by another policeman, the men kidnapped Yasmin, an 18-year-old housemaid who worked in the capital, late at night when she asked for a lift home in their police van after missing the last bus.

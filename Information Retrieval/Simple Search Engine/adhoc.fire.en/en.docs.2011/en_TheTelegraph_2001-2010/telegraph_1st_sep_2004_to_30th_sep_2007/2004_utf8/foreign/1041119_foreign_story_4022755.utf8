 Iran pursuing bomb: Powell

 ROBIN WRIGHT AND KEITH B. RICHBURG

 Santiago, Nov. 18: The US has intelligence that Iran is working to adapt missiles to deliver a nuclear weapon, further evidence that the Islamic republic is determined to acquire a nuclear bomb, secretary of state Colin L. Powell said yesterday. 

 ?I have seen some information that would suggest that they have been actively working on delivery systems... You don?t have a weapon until you put it in something that can deliver a weapon,? Powell said en route to Chile for an Asia-Pacific economic summit. ?I?m not talking about uranium or fissile material or the warhead; I?m talking about what one does with a warhead.?

 Powell?s comments came just three days after an agreement between Iran and three European countries ? Britain, France and Germany ? designed to limit Tehran?s ability to divert its peaceful nuclear energy programme for military use. The primary focus of the deal, accepted by Iran on Sunday, is a stipulation that Iran indefinitely suspend its uranium enrichment programme. 

 The issue of adapting a missile is separate from the question of enriching uranium for use in a weapon.

 ?I?m talking about information that says they not only have these missiles, but I am aware of information that suggests that they were working hard as to how to put the two together,? Powell said, referring to the process of matching warheads to missiles. 

 ?There is no doubt in my mind ? and it?s fairly straightforward from what we?ve been saying for years ? that they have been interested in a nuclear weapon that has utility, meaning that it is something they would be able to deliver, not just something that sits there,? Powell said. 

 Iran has long been known to have a missile programme, while denying that it was seeking a nuclear bomb. Powell seemed to be suggesting that efforts not previously disclosed were underway to arm missiles with warheads. 

 Joseph Cirincione of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said Powell?s remarks indicated that Iran was trying to master the technology of reducing the size of a nuclear warhead to fit on a ballistic missile.

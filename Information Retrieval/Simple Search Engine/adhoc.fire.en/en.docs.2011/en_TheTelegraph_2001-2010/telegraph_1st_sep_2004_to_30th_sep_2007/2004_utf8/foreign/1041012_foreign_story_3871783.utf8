 Napoleon bone apart and mended

 RICHARD SAVILL

 London, Oct. 11: When Napoleon the cockerel was left with a broken leg after a fox attack the vet treating the bird thought she would have to put it down.

 But John Canney and Glyn Isom, the devoted owners, begged their vet Sandra Osborn to save it. So she performed an operation usually carried out on cats and dogs. The bird?s leg was reconstructed and a metal plate fitted in what is thought to be an unprecedented operation for a domestic fowl.

 Osborn?s main concern was whether it would survive a general anaesthetic, but the two-year-old Brahma cockerel was covered in bubble wrap to conserve body heat and avoid shock during the hour-long operation. 

 Yesterday it seemed as good as new as it strutted around the farmhouse near Honiton, Devon.

 ?We believe he?s the only chicken in England, possibly the world, to have had this operation,? said Isom, a television producer. 

 ?She said: ?Are you sure? He?s only a chicken.? But Napoleon is a very special character. He is so wonderfully proud. People would do this for a cat or dog. Why not a cockerel??

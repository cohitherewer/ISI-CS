 Saddam sees lawyer for first time

 Baghdad, Dec. 16 (Reuters): Saddam Hussein met a lawyer today for the first time since he was arrested a year ago, his defence team said.

 ?The interview lasted for more than four hours. The president seems in good health, much better compared to his first appearance before the court,? Saddam?s Amman-based legal team said.

 Iraq?s former leader has been in custody since US forces found him hiding in a hole near his hometown of Tikrit on December 13 last year and is due to be tried for war crimes along with 11 of his top deputies.

 Saddam?s defence lawyers said earlier this week they did not recognise the Iraqi interim government?s plans to try the 67-year-old or his aides since they had been denied access to their clients and had not been given legal documents on which to prepare their case.

 Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said on Tuesday that war crimes trials of some of Saddam?s top aides would begin next week. 

 Defence minister Hazim Shaalan said Saddam?s feared cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, known as ?Chemical Ali?, would be the first to stand trial.

 Osama tape

 An audio tape purportedly by Osama bin Laden praises gunmen who attacked a US consulate in Saudi Arabia on December 6 and warns Saudi rulers they could be toppled like the Shah of Iran.

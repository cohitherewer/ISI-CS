 Baghdad, Sept. 17 (Reuters): 

 A suicide car bomber killed at least eight people in an 

 attack on a police checkpoint in Baghdad today, after a 

 night of US air strikes around rebel-held Falluja that killed 

 scores.

 A government spokesperson said 

 the bomb had detonated beside a line of police vehicles 

 set up to seal off routes to nearby Haifa Street, where 

 US troops were continuing the battles they have been fighting 

 all week to dislodge insurgents. A large crater was gouged 

 into the road and several police cars were ablaze, sending 

 thick smoke into the sky. 

 The interior ministry said five 

 police had been killed and the health ministry said at least 

 three civilians were also dead, and the toll could rise. 

 Earlier, a government spokesperson 

 had put the toll at 13.

 The US military said an air strike 

 last night near Falluja had killed around 60 foreign fighters 

 loyal to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian with a $25-million 

 price on his head who is the Americans? number one foe in 

 Iraq.

 Early today, US warplanes destroyed 

 a compound in south central Falluja that the US military 

 said was also used by Zarqawi?s militants.

 Today?s violence in Baghdad began 

 before dawn near around the Haifa Street area. The US military 

 said its troops had fired on a car packed with explosives 

 that was driving towards a checkpoint, killing two men in 

 the vehicle. Later, blasts and gunfire echoed from Haifa 

 Street as US troops moved in.

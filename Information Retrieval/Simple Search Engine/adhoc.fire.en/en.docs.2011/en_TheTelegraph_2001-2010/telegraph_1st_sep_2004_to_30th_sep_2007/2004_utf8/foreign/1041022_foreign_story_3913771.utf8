 Loose cannon Teresa in Laura job slur

 Milwaukee (Wisconsin), Oct. 21: Senator John Kerry?s wife reinforced her reputation as a political loose cannon yesterday when she said President George W. Bush?s wife, Laura, had never had a real job.

 Teresa Heinz Kerry appeared not only to make the politically hazardous move of disdaining the role of a stay-at-home mother, but also to forget that Laura Bush was a teacher and librarian.

 Her unguarded remark in the USA Today newspaper risks infuriating suburban housewives, the ?swing? constituency her husband has spent the past fortnight wooing from Bush.

 Asked how she would be different from Laura Bush, she said: ?I don?t know that she?s ever had a real job. Her experience and validation come from important things, but different things.?

 To make the slightest of side swipes at Laura Bush is hugely risky as she is wildly popular in America, with her appeal spanning party lines. Karen Hughes, Bush?s image maker, said: ?Teaching is a real job. Working as a librarian is a real job. Staying at home and rearing a family is a real job.?

 In a statement last night Heinz Kerry said she honoured and appreciated Laura Bush?s service as First Lady and was ?sincerely sorry? she had not remembered her ?important work in the past?.

 Heinz Kerry is one of the wealthiest women in America. Her first husband, who died in a plane crash more than a decade ago, was the Republican senator John Heinz, the heir to the beans fortune.

 She has long been known for her outspoken ways, to the delight of the grassroots, but to the dismay of the party machine. With polls flickering back and forth yesterday, President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry rampaged across the same small patch of the heartland yesterday, seemingly trying to outdo each other in alarming voters.

 Taking advantage of the sudden onset of wintry weather and a rash of colds, the Democrat seized on the shortage of flu vaccines to accuse Bush of failing to protect the electorate from either war or disease. Bush accused Kerry of ?old-style scare tactics?.

 But the most chilling sound-bite was from vice-president Dick Cheney, who warned a rally in Ohio, the ?Ground Zero? of the election, that terrorists could bomb an American town with a nuclear device, and suggested that Kerry was not the man to counter such an attack.

 The Democrats accused him of waging the politics of fear before promptly unleashing their advertisements and attacks In Iowa Kerry made a direct appeal to the emotions of Americas women, a normally reliable Democrat constituency which he has had difficulties wooing in the face of Bush?s emotive campaigning style and fears over terrorism. ?No American mother should have to lie awake at night worrying whether her children will be safe at school the next day,? he said.

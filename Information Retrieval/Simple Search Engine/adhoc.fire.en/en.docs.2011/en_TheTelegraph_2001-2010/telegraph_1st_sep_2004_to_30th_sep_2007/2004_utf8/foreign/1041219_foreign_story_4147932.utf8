 Rumsfeld boost

 Washington, Dec. 18 (Reuters): The White House gave a new vote of confidence today to defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld amid growing criticism of him from members of President George W. Bush?s own Republican Party.

 ?Secretary Rumsfeld is doing a great job leading our efforts at the department of defence to win the war on terrorism and to help bring about a free and peaceful Iraq, and the President is focused on working closely with him on those matters,? said White House spokesman Scott McClellan. 

 Rumsfeld has faced heavy criticism for not sending more troops to Iraq and failing to give them proper equipment. 

 Former Senate majority leader Trent Lott said in his home state of Mississippi on Wednesday: ?I am not a fan of secretary Rumsfeld. I don?t think he listens to his uniformed officers.?

 Lott did not call for Rumsfeld?s resignation but said: ?I would like to see a change in that slot in the next year or so.? Arizona Republican Senator John McCain got the latest round of criticism under way by saying he had no confidence in Rumsfeld.

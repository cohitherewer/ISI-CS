 Migration theory stirs hornets nest

 Exeter (England), Sept. 6 (Reuters): Anthropologists stepped into a hornets nest today, revealing research that suggests the original inhabitants of America may in fact have come from what is now known as Australia.

 The claim will be extremely unwelcome to todays native Americans who came overland from Siberia and say they were there first. 

 But Silvia Gonzalez from John Moores University in Liverpool said skeletal evidence pointed strongly to this unpalatable truth and hinted that recovered DNA would corroborate it.

 This is very contentious, Gonzalez, a Mexican, said with a smile at the annual meeting of the British association for the Advancement of Science. 

 She said there was very strong evidence that the first migration came from Australia via Japan and Polynesia and down the Pacific Coast of America. 

 Skulls of a people with distinctively long and narrow heads discovered in Mexico and California predated by several thousand years the more rounded features of the skulls of native Americans.

 US running mates set for debate showdown

 Cleveland, Oct. 5 (Reuters): Vice-president Dick Cheney and Senator John Edwards take centrestage in the race for the White House in a nationally televised debate that is likely to focus on the Iraq war and US security issues but also will include domestic topics.

 With polls showing the race for the White House tightening after last week?s clash between President George W. Bush and Democratic rival John Kerry, the stakes for the showdown between their running mates have been raised dramatically.

 Cheney, the administration?s harshest critic of Kerry, will make the White House?s case for the invasion of Iraq and try to stem the momentum building for Kerry since he put Bush on the defensive in last week?s debate.

 Bush campaign strategist Matthew Dowd said Cheney would ?explain to the American people why the President?s policies are right for this country and the world in fighting the war on terror, in keeping our economy growing and responding to the new challenges in the 21st century.?

 Edwards, a first-term Senator from North Carolina who was chosen for the ticket by Kerry after a strong primary run, will try to put Cheney on the defensive about the administration?s policies in Iraq, its record on jobs and health care and its ties to special interests, Kerry aides said.

 Dinner damper

Santiago, Nov. 21 (AP): An elaborate state 

dinner tonight for President George W. Bush was scrapped after US and Chilean 

officials failed to agree on security measures at the presidential palace, Chilean 

media reported.

 Bush and Chilean leader Ricardo Lagos instead were to hold an informal working dinner tonight following the close of the Apec summit, leading Chilean newspaper El Mercurio reported today.

 White House deputy press secretary Claire Buchan confirmed that the dinner had been downgraded to a working dinner, but did not provide additional details.

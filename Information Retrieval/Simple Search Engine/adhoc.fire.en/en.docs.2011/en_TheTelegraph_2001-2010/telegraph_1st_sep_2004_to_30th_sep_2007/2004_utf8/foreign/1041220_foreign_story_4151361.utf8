 Pervez plan under fire

 Pervez Musharraf

 Islamabad, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Islamists vowed today to resist plans by Pakistan?s President to stay on as head of the army, breaking his pledge to quit the post by the end of the year.

 Qazi Hussain Ahmed, a leader of the Opposition Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) Islamic alliance, said the Islamists would unveil ?some important steps? at an anti-government rally in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, later today.

 ?We will answer him in public...in front of the Pakistani people,? he said.

 ?We have been against (this plan) from day one and we will resist,? Hussain said.

 The political temperature is likely to rise in the country following Pervez Musharraf?s statement on a private television network yesterday that he will stay on as army chief after December 31.

 Musharraf pledged last year to shed his military uniform by the end of 2004 in return for support for constitutional changes validating his rule and giving him extensive power under a deal with an alliance of Islamist parties.

 Parliament, where pro-military groups hold the majority, last month passed a bill allowing Musharraf to keep the dual offices of the President and army chief.

 In the television interview, Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless coup in 1999, also promised to tell Pakistanis within days why he had changed his mind.

 The military ruler previously signalled that he believed quitting as army chief would undermine Pakistan?s support for the US-led war on terror and his efforts to make peace with rival nuclear India.

 He also has said an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis want him to remain as chief of the country?s powerful military.

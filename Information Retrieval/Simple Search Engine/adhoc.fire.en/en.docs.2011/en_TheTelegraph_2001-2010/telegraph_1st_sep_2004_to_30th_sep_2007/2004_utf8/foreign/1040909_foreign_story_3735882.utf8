 Pak seeks niche in global arms market

 General Syed Ali Hamid

 Karachi, Sept. 8 (Reuters): Pakistan, striving to make a niche for itself in the global arms market, is touting locally-built tanks and other weapons during a defence exhibition that opens here next week, a top army official said.

 ?Our big-ticket items, which would take our sales up by maybe a couple of hundred million dollars or more, are just coming on line,? Major General Syed Ali Hamid, director general of the Defence Export Promotion Organisation, said today.

 He said the indigenously-manufactured Al-Khalid tank, which has been inducted in the Pakistan army this year, is the prime product for sale at the ?IDEAS 2004? arms exhibition opening in Karachi next Tuesday.

 Within the next two years, JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft, jointly produced by Pakistan and China, will hit the market, Hamid said.

 Pakistan?s defence industry is also working on a plan to produce unmanned surveillance aircraft.

 Already exporting around $100 million worth of weapons and ammunition annually to Africa, West Asia and South Asian neighbours, Pakistan hopes to increase its sales to $500 million within five years to take a modest one per cent of the global arms market.

 Hamid said Pakistan was not just offering defence products for sale, but also services to maintain and upgrade weapons.

 ?For example a missile system which may cost something $5.0 to $7.0 million can be updated for one-tenth of that price and it could be given a new life of eight to 10 years.?

 Hamid said Pakistan?s large fleet of Chinese T-59 tanks have been upgraded and fitted with the latest 125 mm guns ? similar to the new al-Khalid tanks.

 Six killed in clash

 Six Pakistani civilians were killed during a clash between the army and militants in a bazaar in a troubled northwest tribal region today, a top military spokesman said.

 Major-General Shaukat Sultan said on state-owned Pakistan Television the army had arrested 28 people after the clash in the main market of the town of Wana in the South Waziristan tribal region. Wana is about 400 km southwest of Islamabad.

 In an earlier account of the incident, a military official said troops killed six suspected militants in the shootout, and arrested 11. Sultan said soldiers came under fire from militants after their vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb. 

 ?Miscreants started firing on the convoy as a result of which six civilians were martyred and 11 were wounded,? Sultan said.

 ?The security forces responded and surrounded the area and arrested 28 people from there,? he said. Several soldiers were also wounded in the encounter, he said. 

 South Waziristan has been the scene of major operations by the Pakistani army in recent months and there are hundreds of al Qaida-linked foreign militants, including Arabs, Chechens and Uzbeks and their tribal allies hiding there, officials say.

 Fine Print

 Passion push

 Los Angeles, Nov. 20 (Reuters): Mel Gibson has sworn off using paid advertisements to seek Oscars for his blockbuster, The Passion of the Christ.

 Breaking with a growing Hollywood practice of heavy-handed pre-Oscar marketing, Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey have vowed not to spend a cent on television, radio or print ads hawking Passion for Academy Award consideration, a spokesperson said.

 However, Icon is presenting promotional screenings of The Passion and plans to send out thousands of DVD copies to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other industry groups that present year-end film awards.

 ?This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not on who spends more money for advertising. That?s really what the academy was meant to be and to celebrate,? Davey said in a statement. 

 Work woes

Sydney (Reuters): Australians work the longest hours in the 

industrialised world and are likely to work themselves into an early grave, a 

report said. Titled Take The Rest Of The Year Off Day, the report by The 

Australia Institute research centre said if Australians took the rest of the year 

off from tomorrow and then took their annual four weeks leave, they would still 

work the same as the average worker in other industrialised countries. Australians 

are working longer hours than Americans, the next longest working nation, and 

even the Japanese, who are known for ?karoshi? or ?death by work?.

 Bill blues

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Michael Jackson has been sued by a Los Angeles antiques dealer who claims the embattled pop star refuses to pay for nearly $180,000 in furniture that he took home in May. According to the lawsuit, Jackson bought $378,000 in merchandise from the Mayfair Gallery, but has not paid the entire bill. 

 ?We?ve heard rumblings about the lawsuit and what we will do is handle it in a good and business-like manner and take care of it as are all matters are in Michael?s business,? Jackson?s lawyer Brian Oxman said.

 A film contest that you just can?t refuse

 Los Angeles, Nov. 17 (Reuters): It?s the film contest you can?t refuse: pick the 100 most memorable movie lines, ranging from Casablanca?s ?Here?s looking at you, kid? to a bit of classic advice from The Godfather ? ?Leave the gun, take the cannolis.?

 The non-profit American Film Institute, or AFI, said yesterday it had sent ballots to 1,500 members of the film community, including artists, critics and historians, with 400 quotes to choose from. The winners will be announced in a three-hour television programme set for June 2005 on CBS.

 Casablanca had seven quotes, the most of any film represented in the contest, including Humphrey Bogart?s lament as bar owner Rick Blaine: ?Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.?

 Also among the Casablanca classic lines are ?Round up the usual suspects,? ?We?ll always have Paris? and Rick?s stab at explaining life to his former love: ?Ilsa, I?m no good at being noble, but it doesn?t take much to see that the problems of three little people don?t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.?

 Also among the entries are: ?Frankly, my dear, I don?t give a damn? (Gone with the Wind), ?Why don?t you come up sometime and see me?? (Mae West?s She Done Him Wrong), ?May the Force be with you? (Star Wars), ?I see dead people? (The Sixth Sense), ?Houston, we have a problem? (Apollo 13) and ?Show me the money!? (Jerry Maguire). There?s also Rita Hayworth?s comment as Gilda in the movie of the same name: ?If I?d been a ranch, they would have named me the Bar Nothing.?

 The earliest quote on the list came from the first full-length sound film, 1927?s The Jazz Singer: ?Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain?t heard nothin? yet!?

 The Wizard of Oz was the second most represented film with six quotes and Bogart was the most represented actor with 10 quotes on the ballot. Al Pacino and the Marx Brothers follow with six quotes each, including Groucho?s comment from Animal Crackers: ?One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don?t know.?

 Billy Wilder was the most represented writer with 13 quotes while Frances Ford Coppola had nine quotes, seven of them from The Godfather including Vito Corleone?s ?I?m going to make him an offer he can?t refuse.?

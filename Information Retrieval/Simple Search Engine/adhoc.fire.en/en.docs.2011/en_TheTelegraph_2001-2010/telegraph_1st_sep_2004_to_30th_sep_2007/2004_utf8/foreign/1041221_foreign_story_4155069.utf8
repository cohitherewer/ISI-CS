 Shipwreck shadow on The Life Aquatic

 Cate Blanchett: Shark tale

 New York, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Floating on the success of offbeat domestic comedy The Royal Tenenbaums, director Wes Anderson set out to make an epic about adventure on the high seas. But some critics are already predicting a shipwreck.

 Despite a cast of big names such as Bill Murray, Angelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Cate Blanchett, Anderson is the first to admit that the title of his new film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou doesn?t really make it as a blockbuster.

 ?It?s probably safe to say it?s kind of a terrible title in and of itself,? Anderson said. ?Any time somebody asked me what the movie was called ... I was reluctant to say because people are not sure what to make of it. ?It doesn?t serve the purpose of grabbing people when they know nothing about the movie, but if you already know it then I like it for that.?

 It?s not just the title that risks losing its audience ? the film?s quirky and ironic humour, minute detail and convoluted plotline may be hard going for those who are not already fans of the director who made his name with cult favourite Bottle Rocket and critical hit Rushmore.

 Newsday critic Jan Stuart said it ?launches with enormous promise, then sinks into a quagmire of misfired humour and misbegotten characters?.

 On limited release in New York and Los Angeles earlier this month the film made a respectable debut, averaging $57,000 per cinema in its first weekend. Yet with a budget of over $25 million, it has a lot of work to do after its December 25 nationwide release.

 The film creates a semi-fantasy world in which world-renowned but washed-up oceanographer and documentary maker Steve Zissou sets out to take revenge on a mysterious shark that ate his friend and former colleague.

 Bill Murray, who received an Oscar nomination for 2003?s Lost in Translation, plays the charismatic, if a little unbalanced, adventurer who leads Team Zissou, a cast of odd-ball characters wearing uniforms of powder blue speedos and red bobble hats.

 The fish in Anderson?s world are animated and wildly colourful, while a soundtrack of David Bowie songs rendered in Portuguese adds to the surrealism of the film.

 Anderson says he was careful to avoid letting the quirky and artificial details of his fantasy world take over, a criticism that was directed at The Royal Tenenbaums. ?Smart people who hated it often pointed to that, but I?ve been self conscious about that,? Anderson said. ?At the end of the day I just kept going by my own instincts.?

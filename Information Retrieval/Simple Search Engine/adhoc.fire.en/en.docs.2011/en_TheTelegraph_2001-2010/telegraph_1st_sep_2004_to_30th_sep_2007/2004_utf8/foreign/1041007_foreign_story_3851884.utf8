 Scientist of double helix discovery fame dies

 London, Oct. 6 (Reuters): Nobel laureate Maurice Wilkins, a British scientist who played a key role in the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, died yesterday, his university said today.

 Wilkins, who was 88 and still worked at King?s College London, shared the Nobel prize with Francis Crick and James Watson of the Cavendish Laboratories in Cambridge. He demonstrated the feasibility of using X-ray diffraction to solve the structure of DNA.

 ?Professor Wilkins was a towering figure, one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century and a man of immense humanity,? Professor Rick Trainor of King?s College said in a statement.

 Wilkins and his team obtained images of the structure of DNA in the 1950s with unprecedented clarity. His work supported that of Watson and Crick in unravelling the code of life.

 ?Maurice Wilkins was a central figure in one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century, the double helix of DNA, but his generosity and extreme modesty allowed others to share the prize,? said Dr Matt Ridley, author of the book Genome.

 ?It was he who first obtained an X-ray image of DNA, he who taught Francis Crick about DNA, his photograph that inspired James Watson. But later, it was he who finally proved the double helix correct.?

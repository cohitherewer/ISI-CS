 Fine Print

 Final puff

 London, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Nursing home staff paid tribute to a 105-year old British woman who had smoked since the age of 15 by cremating her with a packet of cigarettes and laying a large floral cigarette on her coffin.

 Marie Ellis died ? of natural causes ? at the Eaton Lodge Nursing Home in Kent, southeast England, in early December and was cremated on Tuesday, clutching a packet of her favourite Benson and Hedges cigarettes.

 ?We will always remember her for her smoking because the first thing she asked when she got up was ?Can I have a cigarette?,? said matron Maria Kallis, who commissioned a large wreath in the shape of a cigarette, made with white and yellow crysanthemums, for the spinster?s coffin. 

 Floral feat

 Amsterdam (Reuters): Fields of tulips 

 and daffodils being planted around Amsterdam?s Schiphol 

 airport will not only add more colour come spring but also 

 make it safer for planes to land, the airport said on Wednesday. 

 A spokesperson for Schiphol said the mice and other rodents 

 that some birds hunt were repulsed by the scent of tulip 

 and daffodil bulbs and that without their prey, the winged 

 predators would have little reason to frequent the area 

 around the airport. The airport reports approximately three 

 bird strikes for every 10,000 landings and take-offs.

 Silent light

 Wellington (Reuters): A New Zealand woman with Christmas lights on her house that play carols has been asked for an old favourite ? silent night. A noise-control officer told Robin Adams the carols coming from her decorations were too loud and asked her to turn off the lights, the New Zealand Press Association reported. ?Whoever complained just can?t get into the Christmas theme. It?s just a bit of a cheer up,? Adams was quoted as saying.

 the small South Island town of Blenheim, about 50 km (30 miles) south of Wellington.

 Prior to the complaint, Adams said she turned the decorations off before midnight out of respect for elderly people living nearby, saying the carols could become annoying.

 ?It does drive me a bit nutty, but thats why we only have them on for three or four hours each night.?

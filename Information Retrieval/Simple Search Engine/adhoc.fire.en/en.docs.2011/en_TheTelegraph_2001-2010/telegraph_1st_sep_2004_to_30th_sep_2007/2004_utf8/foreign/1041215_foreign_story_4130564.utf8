 Columbia crash-hit Nasa chief steps down

 Sean ?Keefe

 Washington, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Nasa Administrator Sean ?Keefe resigned yesterday after three tumultuous years at the US space agency, which were shadowed by the fatal break-up of shuttle Columbia and its painful aftermath.

 In his resignation letter to President George W. Bush, ?Keefe said he would stay on the job until a successor is named, hoping that the Senate would approve his replacement by February.

 ?Together, we?ve enjoyed unprecedented success and seen each other through arduous circumstances,? ?Keefe wrote. ?This was the most difficult decision I?ve ever made, but it?s one I felt was best for my family and our future.?

 ?Keefe, a former navy secretary who also worked for the federal office of management and budget, is a strong candidate to become chancellor of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

 Named to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration three years ago, ?Keefe was at the helm when Columbia disintegrated on re-entry on February 1, 2003, killing all seven astronauts.

 A seven-month investigation of the accident found a ?broken safety culture? at Nasa was as much to blame as the mechanical problems that led to the tragedy. 

 Falling foam from an external fuel tank damaged Columbia?s wing seconds after liftoff, allowing superheated gas to penetrate the spacecraft and tear it apart.

 ?Keefe faced withering questioning from members of Congress as he worked to put in place changes to safeguard against future accidents.

 Democrats stumble in HK

 Hong Kong, Sept. 13 (Reuters): Hong Kong?s democrats fell short today of expectations in legislative elections after voters wary of alienating China?s communist rulers chose the stability offered by the Beijing camp.

 The election yesterday for the 60-seat Legislative Council had been portrayed by democrats as a virtual referendum on gaining the right to elect all the city?s leaders. But Beijing?s carrot-and-stick policies and a complicated voting system favoured pro-Beijing politicians.

 ?I am disappointed. It shows how unacceptable the electoral system is,? said Martin Lee, ex-chairman of the Democratic Party, referring to the Byzantine proportional representation system.

 In a blow for pro-democracy forces, their candidates won 18 directly elected seats, just one more than in the last election and well below expectations, despite a record 55.6 per cent voter turnout, final official results showed.

 Wary of vexing Beijing and keen to safeguard economic prosperity that depends on the mainland, voters ensured a better-than-expected showing for the pro-Beijing camp. It took 12 of the 30 popularly chosen seats, up from just seven in 2000.

 However, results for the other 30 seats, elected by small professional groups, such as lawyers and doctors, and traditionally dominated by the pro-Beijing forces, brought the camps? totals to almost the same level as in 2000. The Beijing camp took 34, unchanged, the democrats gained three to 25 and independents won one, down from four.

 ?Citizens have given us a vote of confidence,? said Ma Lik, chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong.

 China?s policy-making Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office said the polls showed the city?s people were ?masters of their own house?. It did not comment on the modest pro-democracy gains. 

 But China?s drive to woo Hong Kong, including many economic incentives, was an important factor for many of the 7 million people in the Asian financial hub.

 Secret Harry tape given to court

 London, Oct. 15 (Reuters): 

 Britain?s royal family went on the attack today after lawyers 

 for one of Prince Harry?s former schoolteachers gave a court 

 a secret tape they said shows she helped him cheat on exams.

 Harry?s former art teacher Sarah Forsyth is suing for wrongful dismissal from Eton College ? the 650-year-old secondary school that was attended by Harry, his brother William and the children of many of Britain?s wealthiest elite.

 She says she was forced by her bosses to help prepare material that her royal pupil submitted along with his paintings for an art exam.

 Harry, the 20-year-old younger son of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, needed two passing grades to earn a spot at the army?s officer training academy where he is due to start next year.

 He received a B in Art and a D in Geography. Eton and the prince deny he received improper help on his exams.

 The teacher?s lawyers submitted a tape she made in secret of Harry, saying the prince confessed on tape to receiving help. But the palace said the tape was unclear.

 ?This is incredibly unfair on Harry. Miss Forsyth?s lawyers have given the court a brief extract from the tape and placed their own interpretation upon it,? Charles? communications secretary said. The tape ?contains barely audible half-sentences, and it appears to have been edited. It is also difficult to tell what Harry is saying and what he is referring to, due to the poor quality of the recording and the disjointed nature of the tape.?

 The hearings continue.

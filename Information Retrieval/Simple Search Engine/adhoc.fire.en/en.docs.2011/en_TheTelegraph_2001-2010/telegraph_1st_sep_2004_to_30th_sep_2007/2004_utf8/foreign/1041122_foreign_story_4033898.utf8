 China plane crash kills 53

 Beijing, Nov. 21 (Reuters): A China Eastern commuter plane crashed into a frozen lake seconds after takeoff in Inner Mongolia today, killing 53 people on board and one on the ground, the airline and state media said.

 ?Witnesses said that the plane broke into flaming fragments, a house beside the park was damaged by the falling aircraft and several yachts nearby were scorched,? Xinhua news agency said.

 It quoted one witness as saying the plane was trailing black smoke and rocking violently when there was an explosion and the plane crashed and broke apart.

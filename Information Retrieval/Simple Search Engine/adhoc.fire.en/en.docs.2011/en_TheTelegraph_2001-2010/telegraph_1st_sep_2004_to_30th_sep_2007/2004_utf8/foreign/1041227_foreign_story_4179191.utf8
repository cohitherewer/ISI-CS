 Iraq poll panel rejects US plan

 Baghdad, Dec. 26 (Reuters): Iraq?s election body rejected a suggestion in Washington it adjust the results of next month?s vote to benefit the Sunni minority if low turnout in Sunni areas means Shias have an exaggerated majority in the new assembly.

 Speaking of ?unacceptable? interference, Electoral Commission spokesperson Farid Ayar said: ?Who wins, wins. That is the way it is. That is the way it will be in the election.?

 US diplomats in Baghdad, at pains to keep their role in the election discreet, declined comment on a New York Times report from Washington which said Sunnis might be granted extra seats if the community?s vote was judged to have been too low.

 US officials have expressed concern that if the ballot on January 30 fails to reflect Iraq?s sectarian and ethnic mix due to violence and boycotts in Sunni areas, then the assembly will lack legitimacy. 

 But any attempt to fix the proportion of seats going to the main groups in advance could have the same effect.

 ?The Americans are expressing their views and those aren?t always the same as the commission?s,? Ayar said.

 ?But the commission is absolutely independent. It is not acceptable for anyone to interfere in our business.?

 Some leaders among Sunni Arabs, a 20-per cent minority who dominated the country under Saddam Hussein and before, have called for the election to be put off because violence in the north and west will make it hard for Sunnis to vote.

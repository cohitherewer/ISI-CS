 Jocular jailbirds

 London, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Two criminals showed their polite side yesterday when they thanked the judge after he sent them to jail for six years each for converting hundreds of blank-firing guns into lethal weapons.

 As judge David Paget sentenced Stephen Herbert, 47, and Gary Beard, 46, one of them called out with a smile: ?Thank you judge, that?s lovely.? The other was heard to mutter: ?We got away with that one.? Their crimes could have attracted maximum penalties of 10 years.

 A factory in southeast London run by the two men converted over one gun a day into fully functioning arms during a 14-month period. The weapons were sold on to criminals at ?600 a time, the court heard.

 The firearms being converted included the Walther PPK, famously used by James Bond. Police believe the gang pocketed over ?360,000 pounds from the venture.

 Dogs at UN

 United Nations (Reuters): The UN this 

 month is expected to draw scores of dignitaries to New York 

 for its General Assembly session, but on Friday it welcomed 

 a new contingent of a different sort ? bomb sniffing dogs.Jet 

 and Candy, a pair of Labrador retrievers, were introduced 

 to reporters before the main General Assembly session begins 

 on September 21. The trained dogs were a gift from New York 

 state police. Already some UN delegates have taken to referring 

 to them as ?assistant secretary-general dogs,? said UN spokesman 

 Fred Eckhard.

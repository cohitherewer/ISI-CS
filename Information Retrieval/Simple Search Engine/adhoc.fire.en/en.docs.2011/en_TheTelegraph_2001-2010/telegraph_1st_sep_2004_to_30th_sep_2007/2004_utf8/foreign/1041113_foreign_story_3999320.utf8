 Rare glimpse of daughter

 Cairo, Nov. 12 (AP): Television audiences watching Yasser Arafat?s funeral in Cairo today got a rare glimpse of his nine-year-old daughter Zahwa, weeping and standing next to her mother as his coffin as placed on a plane.

 Egyptian TV, the only station allowed to broadcast the funeral ceremonies, took note of the emotional moment. ?Don?t cry, Zahwa. Your father never cried. He was a man of patience and endurance,? an unidentified announcer said. ?Don?t cry, Zahwa. All the Arab children share with you your pride and dignity today.? Zahwa, which means pride, also was the name of Arafat?s mother.

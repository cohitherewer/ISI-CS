 6 injured in bomb attack near Dhaka

 Dhaka, Sept. 1 (Reuters): At least six people were injured when a bomb exploded in a town north of Dhaka today, 11 days after a deadly grenade attack at an Opposition rally in the capital killed 19, police said.

 The bomb went off at the main market in Gazipur, 50 km from Dhaka, a police officer said by telephone.

 Police said the blast spread panic in the town.

 Three of the wounded have been shifted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital in critical condition, a Gazipur doctor said.

 Police said they had found another crude bomb at the Gazipur Press Club.

 The bomb was found in a water bucket in one of the club rooms, and later taken away by police, said Iqbal Ahmed, a newspaper reporter and general secretary of the press club.

 Bangladesh has been hit by a wave of unrest and often-violent general strikes since seven grenades were thrown at the August 21 rally as Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina had just finished addressing the crowd.

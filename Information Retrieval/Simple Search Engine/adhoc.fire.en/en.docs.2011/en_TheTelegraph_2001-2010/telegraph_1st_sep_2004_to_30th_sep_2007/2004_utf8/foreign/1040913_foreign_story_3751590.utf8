 Canadian?s Silver spoof on Bush

 Toronto, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Describing his new film, Silver City, as part-murder mystery and part-political satire, director John Sayles made it very clear yesterday which politician the movie is satirising.

 ?(The) character is very much based on George W. Bush when he first ran for governor of Texas,? he said just before his movie made its world debut at the Toronto International Film Festival.

 Sayles, who started putting together the story shortly after the 2000 presidential election, and rushed pre-production so as to get the film into theatres before the November 2 election, said he was discouraged by the deterioration of ?the political and cultural conversation in the US.?

 ?There?s a real pressure not to raise your voice, not to question what?s going on internationally or in the country itself,? he said.

 The film features Chris Cooper as grammatically challenged Colorado gubernatorial hopeful Dickie Pilager, a born-again candidate backed by his father, a US senator with powerful corporate connections.

 Pilager at first struggles to keep his composure when confronted by the press, delivering lines such as ?Keeping the infrastructure in place, where it belongs, is a priority.?

 While Cooper said he drew some of the character?s traits from his own fear of public speaking, he acknowledged borrowing some mannerisms from Bush. 

 ?Certainly there are some recognisable characteristics in terms of our President,? he said.

 The film at first plays like a political satire, but evolves into a whodunit after a body turns up while Pilager is filming a campaign ad.

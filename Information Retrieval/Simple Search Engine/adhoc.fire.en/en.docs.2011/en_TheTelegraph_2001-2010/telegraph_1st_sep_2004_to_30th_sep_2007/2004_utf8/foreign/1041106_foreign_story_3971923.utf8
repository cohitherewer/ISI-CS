 Falluja sealed before assault

 Baghdad, Nov. 5 (Reuters): US troops urged civilians to flee Falluja today and launched air strikes on the rebel city ahead of an assault seen as critical to attempts to pacify Iraq before January elections.

 US forces sealed all roads to the city and used loudspeakers and leaflets in Arabic to tell residents they would detain any man under 45 trying to enter or leave the city. ?We are making last preparations. It will be soon,? Marine Colonel Michael Shupp said.

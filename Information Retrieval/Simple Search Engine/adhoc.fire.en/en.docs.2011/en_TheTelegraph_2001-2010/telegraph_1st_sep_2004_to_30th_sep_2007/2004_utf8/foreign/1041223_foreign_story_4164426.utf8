 Yushchenko must win by wide margin

 Yushchenko

 Kiev, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Liberal Viktor Yushchenko will need to win by a wide margin in a new presidential election if he wants to carry out a major overhaul of what he sees as 13 years of corrupt government.

 The more votes he wins in Sunday?s ballot, analysts say, the more solid will be his mandate to root out corruption in public and commercial life and fulfil the hopes of the protesters who backed him.

 Few would dispute that Yushchenko is heavy favourite in the new race against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich. The Supreme Court ordered the new ballot after overturning the prime minister?s victory in a vote last month due to mass cheating.

 With Yanukovich on the defensive, many see the issue as confirming at the ballot box the mass support in the street for Yushchenko, for his complaints against fraud and for his calls for change.

 ?Yushchenko must in the first place work in the interests of Ukraine?s people. And this is no mere slogan,? said analyst Oleksander Lytvynenko of Kiev?s Razumkov centre think tank.

 ?If there had been no rallies, we would have long had another president in place and inaugurated. People believe in Yushchenko not just because he is a charming and heavyweight politician, but because he stands for specific changes.?

 Yushchenko must now maintain unity among politicians focused on keeping out allies of outgoing President Leonid Kuchma, who they vilify as the embodiment of post-Soviet corruption. But first he must score well on Sunday.

 ?Everything depends on the magnitude of the result,? said one Western diplomat. ?Whether he gets 55 per cent, or 70 or 75 per cent ? that makes a considerable difference.? Yushchenko predicts he will win more than 60 per cent and finish first in up to 20 of the ex-Soviet state?s 27 regions.

 Securing a consensus for the new vote meant striking deals and compromises on key issues with various political forces.

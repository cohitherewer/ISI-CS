 Myanmar PM ousted by hawks

 Bangkok, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Myanmar?s Prime Minister has been ousted and put under house arrest after a lengthy power struggle that has tightened the grip of hardliners in the military government, Thai officials and diplomats said today.

 Khin Nyunt?s removal, yet to be confirmed by Yangon, was not expected to trigger a wider conflict within the military. But prospects for political change looked dimmer than ever in a country considered a pariah by the West for its detention of democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi and dismal rights record. 

 ?Change has never looked farther off than it is now,? a Bangkok-based western diplomat said. Thai authorities said Khin Nyunt, 64, had been stripped of the Prime Minister?s post and put under house arrest. 

 ?The person who signed the order said Khin Nyunt had been involved in corruption and not suitable to stay in his position,? said Thai government spokesman Jakrapob Penkair. ?It is still unclear who issued the order and we still don?t know who will be the next Prime Minister,? he said after a cabinet meeting in Mae Sot, a town near the Myanmar border.

 However, in a sign military strongman senior General Than Shwe had tightened his grip on power, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra hinted that Khin Nyunt?s successor might be Soe Win, a top general believed to be a hawkish and trusted Than Shwe deputy. 

 Diplomats said that according to rumours Khin Nyunt was arrested by officers loyal to army commander and vice-senior General Maung Aye, the number two in the junta.

 Speculation has been rife for months of a widening rift between Khin Nyunt, who had struggled since he was appointed last year to implement his ?roadmap to democracy?, and Than Shwe, the de facto chief of the secretive Yangon government.

 The military has ruled the former Burma in various guises since 1962 and refused to hand over power to Nobel laureate Suu Kyi after her National League for Democracy won a 1990 election. Signals that an internal power struggle had reached a climax emerged early in the day from Thai military sources.

 Another Thai army general said he had been told that Maung Aye, unhappy with Khin Nyunt?s leadership, had pressed the Prime Minister to resign during a meeting last night. 

 The last leadership shakeup in Myanmar occurred in 1992 when Than Shwe, with Khin Nyunt?s backing, ousted senior General Saw Maung.

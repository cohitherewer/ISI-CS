 Kids will suffer trauma for decades, feel experts

 DAVID DERBYSHIRE

 London, Sept. 4: Many of the children caught up in the Russian siege will carry psychological scars for decades and some may never fully recover, according to some of Britains leading experts in childhood trauma.

 While the symptoms of post-traumatic stress vary from child to child, many will suffer such terrifying nightmares that they will develop fear of falling asleep. Some will experience daily flashbacks.

 Younger children may be so frightened of being left alone that they become obsessively clingy. Bed wetting, tantrums, repetitive behaviour and difficulties with relationships will become common. Many will be terrified of returning to school.

 But despite the risks of post-traumatic stress disorder, the Russians should avoid sending in counsellors, Prof. William Yule, an expert in childhood trauma at the Institute of Psychiatry, London, said. The first thing they need is to be reunited with their parents and to feel safe.

 Prof. Yule, who advised the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on the NHS guidelines for post-traumatic stress disorder, said experts should take a back seat to start with.

 There is a suspicion that going in too soon might actually interfere with normal healing processes, he said.

 We know from studies that over the first eight to 10 weeks after a violent assault or road accident stress reactions come down quite considerably. The sleep gets back to normal, they are not so jumpy and they dont avoid things.

 Some people argue that you delay doing intensive treatment for two to three months afterwards. But someone needs to be in contact with the children and their families and monitor them as unobtrusively as possible.

 Victims of post-traumatic stress disorder, or shell shock, suffer intrusive, vivid replays of their ordeal. Other symptoms include depression, emotional detachment, guilt and fear.

 Children suffering from stress are likely to express their anxiety in drawings and repetitive behaviour. Younger children become limpet-like, clinging obsessively to parents.

 That can be exceedingly irritating to parents who are also traumatised, said Prof. Yule. The parents need guidance. They also need to listen to the children and not tell them to shut up about it.

 Prof. Yules study of child victims of a Greek cruise ship disaster found that five to seven years after the sinking 15 per cent were still suffering post-traumatic stress.

 Studies of the Aberfan slag heap disaster in Wales found that 30 per cent of primary school children who survived had post-traumatic stress disorder 30 years later.

 Peter Norman, an educational psychologist in Buckinghamshire who deals with disasters and accidents involving children, said: The key is the support systems that children already have. The last thing you need is to send in teams of counsellors.

 What you need is the support to feel safe, that you are with people who you are secure with, that you are removed from the threat.

 Normally, parents and teachers provide the best support.

 There will be children who carry the consequences of this for a long time, perhaps throughout their life. It could affect their confidence, how secure they feel, their ability to form relationships, their social skills, he said.

 Pervez urged to quit post

 Karachi, Nov. 24 (Reuters): Pakistan?s main alliance of Islamic parties demanded today that President Pervez Musharraf quit as army chief by the end of the year, as he has pledged to, and threatened protests if he does not.

 The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) alliance last year helped the government to pass a controversial constitutional amendment that gave sweeping powers to the president and validated decisions taken by his military-led government since an October 1999 coup.

 In return, Musharraf promised he would relinquish the powerful post of army chief by the end of this year, but in recent months he has suggested he might retain the post.

 ?We will formally launch a people?s movement if he violates his promise of resigning from the army,? Maulana Fazal-ur Rehman, general secretary of the MMA, said.

 The protest campaign is unlikely to pose a threat to Musharraf?s rule because pro-military members have a majority in parliament and they passed a bill last month allowing him to stay on as army chief beyond 2004. Musharraf has yet to sign the bill into law.

 A major ally in the US-led war on terror, Musharraf has suggested shedding his uniform could undermine his authority in the battle against militancy and his ability to push forward a nascent peace process with India.

 Military rule was formally ended with the election of a pro-military government in 2002 but the MMA said the army should have no role in politics.

 ?The MMA plans to unite all the Opposition leaders on the single issue of the presidents uniform,? Rehman said after a meeting of alliance leaders.

 ?Our protest is inevitable because the government appears set to violate the agreement,? said Rehman, who is the chief of the pro-Afghan Taliban Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and leader of the opposition in the National Assembly.

 The Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy (ARD), a grouping of secular parties, has already announced plans to launch a protest campaign in a bid to force Musharraf to quit the army with a rally in the northwestern city of Peshawar on December 5.

 Despite ideological differences, the MMA and the ARD leaders are trying to form a united front. The ARD, in which former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto?s Pakistan Peoples? Party is the main component, is generally seen as being closer to Musharraf on several issues including cooperation with the US and its war on terror.

 While western countries have voiced concern over Musharraf?s democratic credentials, criticism has been muted given his role in helping the US hunt al Qaida members responsible for the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US. The MMA plans to hold launch its anti-government campaign with a rally in Karachi, a teeming southern city of 15 million people, on November 28, Rehman said.

 Bangladesh foreign minister M. Morshed Khan arrived in Islamabad today to formally invite Pakistan to attend the 13th Saarc summit in Dhaka next January, official sources said.

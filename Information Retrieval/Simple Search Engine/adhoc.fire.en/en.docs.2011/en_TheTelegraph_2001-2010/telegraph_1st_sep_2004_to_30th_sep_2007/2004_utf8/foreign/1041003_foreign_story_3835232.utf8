 Fashion safari boom spells doom for pythons

 - Snakes 

not in danger: Designers

 There were zebra-skin hats, bags and boots in the show at Milan Fashion Week yesterday. And the distinctive diamond markings of one of the worlds longest snakes appeared on everything from bags and boots to ballet pumps and hats.

 Python ? which is cheaper than crocodile ? is the current luxe obsession. To underline its importance in the fashion firmament, the British supermodel Naomi Campbell had been chosen to open the show in a shiny python corset-dress, trimmed with black lace.

 Models paraded past wearing trenchcoats in python, decorated with silver chains and sequins; jeans featuring side-stripes of python; lace shirt-dresses with python collars and pockets; and python boots embellished with crystals. 

 Dolce amp; Gabbana are the latest in a list of international designer labels ? including Roberto Cavalli, Gianfranco Ferre, Calvin Klein, Chloe, Luella Bartley and Oscar de la Renta ? who are promoting python as a status luxury item. The design duo Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce said yesterday that the python skins were legitimately farmed. The zebra skins, they added, were not from a protected species or from either of the two endangered species ? the Mounted and the Grevy?s zebra.

 WWF, the wildlife charity, fears that the trend for python skin could prove disastrous for one of the world?s least-threatening snakes.

 Although all designers say that the python used is sustainably farmed, there is also a thriving illegal trade, involving forged export permits. Last week Chris Shepherd ? a leading expert on the sustainable exploitation of reptiles ? warned that the amount of skins being used in the industry indicates that many of the snakes come from the wild. Farmed python was much more costly to produce, he said.

 Andrew Butler, of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), urged the public not to buy animal skins. ?It is difficult with animals like crocodiles and snakes because they are not seen as cuddly,? he said. ?But they still have the same capacity to suffer.?

 Weapons lab found in Falluja

 Baghdad, Nov. 25 (Reuters): A laboratory for the manufacture of chemical weapons has been found in Falluja, an Iraqi minister said today, but Marines in the city said they were not aware of any such discovery.

 ?Soldiers from the Iraqi National Guard found a chemical laboratory that was used to prepare deadly explosives and poisons,? minister of state Kassim Daoud said.

 ?They also found in the lab booklets and instructions on how to make bombs and poisons. They even talked about the production of anthrax.?

 Yesterday, Marines in Falluja said they had found a banner of the insurgent group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in a chemicals laboratory in Falluja. 

 But they said there was no indication the lab was used to produce chemical weapons.

 Marines said they were not aware of any additional laboratories being discovered, and were sceptical that evidence had been found of the manufacture of chemical weapons.

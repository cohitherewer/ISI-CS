 Yukos core goes to dark horse

 Moscow, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Little-known company Baikal Finance Group was declared winner of an auction for Russian oil firm Yukos? main production unit today, outbidding gas monopoly Gazprom, the widely-viewed favourite. 

 Baikal, named after a huge freshwater lake in Siberia, bid 260.75 billion roubles ($9.37 billion) for Yuganskneftegaz, said the sale?s organiser, the Federal Property Fund. Gazprom announced it was not linked to Baikal in any way but analysts had said they suspected the gas giant might have had a hand in the winning bid.

 ?I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests,? said Paul Collison, a strategist with UBS in Moscow. He added Yugansk was likely to end up with Gazprom or directly in the state?s hands.

 The sale of Yuganskneftegaz, which pumps more oil than Opec member Qatar, went ahead in defiance of a US court order barring Gazprom and its foreign bankers from bidding, pending further proceedings in Yukos? application for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

 Yukos is widely seen by analysts as the victim of a Kremlin campaign to crush its politically ambitious owner, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and seize control of strategic sectors of the economy sold off in the chaotic privatisations of the 1990s. Khodorkovsky is now on trial for fraud and tax evasion and faces 10 years in jail if convicted.

 Gazprom had put in an opening offer for 76.79 per cent of Yugansk representing 100 per cent of voting interests at the minimum sale price of 246.8 billion roubles ($8.87 billion) but withdrew after Baikal made the winning bid.

 The auction was ordered to raise funds to help pay Yukos? $27.5-billion back-tax bill, the result of a relentless assault by the authorities which analysts say is aimed at breaking up the company.

 But Yukos has said selling Yugansk at the minimum price would destroy shareholder value, citing an appraisal by investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein which put the value at $14-$17 billion.

 A Yukos spokesman said today that whoever was behind the winning bid would be pursued through the law courts. ?The company (Yukos) considers that the victor of today?s auction has bought itself a serious $9-billion headache,? said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. ?Those who stand behind the winner ... have subjected their business to considerable legal risks. We declare that the sale of Yugansk is illegal?, he said.

 Hours before the auction got under way, lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, pledged to extend their fight against the selloff to other countries.

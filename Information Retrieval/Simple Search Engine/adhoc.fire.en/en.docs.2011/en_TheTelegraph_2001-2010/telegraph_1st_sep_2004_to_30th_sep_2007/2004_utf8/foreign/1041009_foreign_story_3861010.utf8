 Bush stands by Iraq war

 Washington, Oct. 8 (Reuters): President George W. Bush said yesterday he was ?right to take action? in Iraq even though a new US report found that Baghdad had no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and that its nuclear programme had decayed.

 ?Based on all the information we have today, I believe we were right to take action and America is safer today with Saddam Hussein in prison,? Bush said ahead of the second debate with Senator John Kerry in St Louis, Missouri.

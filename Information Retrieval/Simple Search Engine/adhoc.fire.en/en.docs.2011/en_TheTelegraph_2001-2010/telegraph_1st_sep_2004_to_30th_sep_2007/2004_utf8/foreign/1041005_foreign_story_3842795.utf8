 Fine Print

 Red let dogs out

 London, Oct. 4 (AFP): Staff at Britain?s famous Battersea Dogs? Home were baffled after an apparent troublemaker released dozens of animals night after night, allowing them to raid the kitchen and cause chaos. Little did they realise it was an inside job.

 It was only after video surveillance footage was studied that the culprit was revealed to be Red, a lurcher who had been brought to the London refuge as an emaciated stray several months earlier.

 Red had somehow learned to undo the bolt on his kennel, before freeing a group of chosen companions for a raid on the kitchen, staff at the home said today.

 The mystery break-outs had happened about a dozen times, Becky Blackmore said. ?They had had lots of food, lots of fun and lots of fun and games and caused loads of mess. We weren?t too sure what was going on,? she said. ?There are lots of stories about Battersea being haunted so we wanted to make sure that there was an explanation for what was going on and we managed to catch the culprit.?

 Red ? whose hungry life as a stray is believed to lie behind his obsession with food ? has now had his kennel made more secure.

 Confuse cut

 Bucharest (Reuters): An elderly Romanian 

 man mistook his penis for a chicken?s neck, cut it off and 

 his dog rushed up and ate it, the state Rompres news agency 

 said on Monday. It said 67 year-old Constantin Mocanu, from 

 a village near the southeastern town of Galati, rushed out 

 into his yard in his underwear to kill a noisy chicken keeping 

 him awake at night. ?I confused it with the chicken?s neck,? 

 Mocanu, who was admitted to the emergency hospital in Galati, 

 was quoted as saying. ?I cut it ... and the dog rushed and 

 ate it.?

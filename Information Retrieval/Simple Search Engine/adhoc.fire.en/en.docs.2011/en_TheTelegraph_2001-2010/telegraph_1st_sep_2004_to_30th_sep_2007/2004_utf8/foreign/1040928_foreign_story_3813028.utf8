 Osama still alive: Pak

 The Hague, Sept. 27 (Reuters): Intelligence reports suggest al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is alive, Pakistan?s President Pervez Musharraf said today.

 Musharraf said he did not know where bin Laden was hiding, but that the Saudi-born militant had not perished in US-led military strikes against him since the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.

 ?The evidence is interrogation of people that we have apprehended and also technological evidence,? Musharraf said during an official visit to the Netherlands.

 ?We have a lot of intelligence. Intelligence is human intelligence and evidence is technological intelligence and aerial surveillance. All this is combined to produce an intelligence picture,? he added.

 The al Qaida leader?s whereabouts were unknown, said Musharraf, who survived two assassination attempts last year blamed on al Qaida.

 The US commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan said bin Laden was more likely to be hiding in Pakistan than on Afghan territory. Lieutenant-General David Barno said in Kabul no major al Qaida figure had been caught or killed in Afghanistan since 2002, while Pakistan has arrested or killed dozens of operatives linked to the terror network since March.

 ?We see relatively little evidence of senior al Qaida personality figures being here (in Afghanistan) because they can feel more protected by their foreign fighters in remote areas inside Pakistan,? he said.

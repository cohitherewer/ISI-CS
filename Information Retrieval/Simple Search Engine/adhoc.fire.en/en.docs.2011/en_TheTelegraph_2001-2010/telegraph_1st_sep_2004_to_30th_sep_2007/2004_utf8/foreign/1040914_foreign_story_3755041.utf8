 Pacino part

 Toronto, Sept. 13 (AFP): William Shakespeare may have shuffled off this mortal coil 400 years ago, but his take on fundamentalism has warnings for today in a new movie version of The Merchant of Venice starring Al Pacino.

 The film is already drawing whispers of Oscar potential for Pacino?s tortured rendering of Shylock the money lender and its North American release was set for late this year to meet Academy Award 2005 requirements.

 The Merchant of Venice, a tale of romance and revenge, is one of the bard?s most popular plays, yet until now never made it to the big screen, though Orson Welles had hoped to film it. English director Michael Radford sets the battle of vengeance between Shylock the moneylender and the merchant Antonio in a dark and heaving Venice, a mine of distrust, torn between extreme Christianity and Judaism.

 Co-star Jeremy Irons said the film shows ?what happens if you take fundamentalism to the nth degree.?

 ?We seem to be living in a world that is more and more fundamentalist, people are polarising themselves more and more.?

 Lucky life

 London (Reuters): Former Westlife singer 

 Brian McFadden has shot to the peak of the British pop charts 

 with his first solo release since leaving the Irish boy 

 band, the official UK Charts Company said on Sunday. McFadden?s 

 big-production ballad Real To Me is his 13th UK number 

 one after topping the charts 12 times with Westlife, the 

 group he quit in March.

 Bush kin back trashy TV soap

 CATHERINE ELSWORTH AND MATT BORN

 Jenna and Barbara Bush

London, Oct. 16: Probably the last thing Josh 

Schwartz imagined when he created his sultry soap about rich, young Californians 

was that it would one day be cited by the US President?s twin daughters as their 

must-see show.

 In a pre-election interview with People magazine, Jenna and Barbara Bush, 22, admit that The OC is the programme they always watch - or record if something really big forces them to miss it (such as their father making a speech on another channel).

 It?s no small endorsement, given the coverage allotted to anything uttered by the Bush clan at this point. But significantly, when Jenna admitted being a fan, she added: ?I hate to say it.?

 This may be because The OC ? which Schwartz calls a ?soapedy? ? is distinctive chiefly for its ultra-glamourous young cast of 16- and 17-year-old high school students who seem to change partners and designer clothes with almost clockwork regularity.

 This recipe of sex and conspicuous consumption has a proven record for travelling well and is now becoming cult viewing among students and schoolchildren in Britain. Since its American launch in August 2003, it has secured a remarkable foothold in contemporary youth culture, influencing not only language, with its catchy one-liners and slang, but also music tastes and holiday destinations.

 With two showings a week and an average audience of 1.2 million in Britain, The OC on Channel 4 has become one of Sunday daytime?s highest-rating shows as well as a big pull for E4 on Monday nights. 

 When Channel 4 temporarily suspended the first series to broadcast Test cricket, it was swamped by complaints.

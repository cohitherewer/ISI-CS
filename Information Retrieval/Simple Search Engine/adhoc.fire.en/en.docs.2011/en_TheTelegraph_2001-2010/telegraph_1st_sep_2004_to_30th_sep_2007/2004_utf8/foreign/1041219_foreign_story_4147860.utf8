 5 killed in Maoist raid

 Kathmandu, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Maoist rebels attacked a police post near Nepal?s capital with crude bombs and automatic weapons today, killing five policemen, police said.

 The attack at Sankhu village, 20 km from Kathmandu, was the biggest assault by rebels so close to the capital since they launched a revolt in 1996. ?About 40 armed rebels set up road blocks and cut off access to the post before they attacked it,? the police said.

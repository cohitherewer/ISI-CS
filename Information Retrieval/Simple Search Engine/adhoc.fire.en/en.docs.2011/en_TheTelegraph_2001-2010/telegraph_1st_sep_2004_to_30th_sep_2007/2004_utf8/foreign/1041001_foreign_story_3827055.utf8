 Fine Print

 Brewer bar

 Brussels, Sept. 30 (Reuters): It may be the world?s biggest brewer ? and in beer-loving Belgium at that ? but InBev does not want its managers drinking at lunchtime.

 Alcohol will no longer be served in the canteen when staff move into a gleaming new headquarters this year. InBev was formed in August when Belgium?s Interbrew merged with AmBev of Brazil, and lunchtime drinking is out of tune with the culture of the new, more international company, spokeswoman Marianne Amssoms said.

 Unions upset at the lack of consultation were told that the company bar would still serve beer after work. Employees at production sites will not be affected by the new policy.

 Bear bully

 Denver (Reuters): Its a tale of 

 man against nature. A paralysed man in Aspen, Colorado lay 

 helplessly in bed for two hours while a black bear known 

 as ?Fat Albert? went through his kitchen breaking dishes 

 and looking for a tasty snack. ?I had 2kg of chocolate from 

 a ski trip. He ate it all ? it?s war,? Tom Isaac said, recounting 

 with a sense of humour how the 230-kg bear made himself 

 at home at his house on September 20. ?I could hear things 

 breaking for two hours,? he said of the bear?s ?visit? to 

 his home. Isaac?s bedroom was only about 3-5 metres from 

 the kitchen and he feared the bear would come in and attack 

 him.

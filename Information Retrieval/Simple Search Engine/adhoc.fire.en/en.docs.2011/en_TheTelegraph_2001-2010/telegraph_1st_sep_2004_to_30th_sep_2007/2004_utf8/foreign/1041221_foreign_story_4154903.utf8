 Bush defends Rumsfeld

 Washington, Dec. 20 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today brushed aside criticism of defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld over his handling of the Iraq war and described him as a ?caring fellow? who will win over doubters on Capitol Hill.

 ?He?s done a fine job and I look forward to continue to work with him,? Bush said.

 He added that Rumsfeld would ?reach out to members of the Hill, explain the decisions he?s made. And I believe that, in a new term, members of the Senate and House will recognise what a good job he?s doing.?

 Rumsfeld over the weekend came under barrage of fresh criticism and accusations of ?insensitivity? after admitting he did not personally sign his name on letters of condolence to families of soldiers killed in Iraq.

 Rumsfeld acknowledged that letters to family members of more than 1,000 US troops killed in action had been signed by machine and in a statement said he would now sign them in his own hand.

 Bush defended Rumsfeld. ?I know secretary Rumsfeld?s heart. I know how much he cares for the troops,? Bush said. ?I have heard the anguish in his voice, and seen his eyes when we talk about the danger in Iraq and the fact that youngsters are over there in harm?s way. He?s a good decent man.?

 ?Sometimes, perhaps his demeanour is rough and gruff. But below that rough and gruff, no-nonsense demeanour is a good human being who cares deeply about the grief that war causes,? Bush said.

 Mental magic

 Berlin, Nov. 24 (Reuters): A German computer scientist has broken the world record in mental calculation, needing just 11.80 seconds to work out the 13th root of a 100-digit number, a German mathematics museum said today.

 Gert Mittring, a 38-year old computer scientist, was faster working out the answer than several onlookers using calculators at an event in the western town of Giessen sponsored by the Museum of Mathematics.

 A spokesman for the museum said Mittring?s time broke a record set in 1988 by Alexis Lemaire of France, who completed a similar calculation in 13.55 seconds.

 Duty calls

 London (Reuters): Britain?s most 

 unusual war heroes ? including glow worms, elephants and 

 monkeys ? will be honoured for their devotion to duty under 

 fire. The Princess Royal, Queen Elizabeth?s daughter, will 

 unveil a war memorial in London?s Park Lane dedicated to 

 all the animals and insects that endured hardship with the 

 nation?s armed services. Among those honoured will be glow 

 worms whose light was used by soldiers to read maps during 

 the trench warfare of World War One. The stone memorial 

 bears the profiles of creatures from bears to monkeys ? 

 kept by soldiers as mascots ? and will be the most prominent 

 tribute to animal bravery in Britain, a nation often mocked 

 for loving its pets more than its children. In 1943 the 

 founder of the PDSA created the Dickin Medal to honour acts 

 of outstanding animal bravery. The medal, dubbed ?the animals? 

 Victoria Cross? ? Britain?s highest award for human bravery 

 ? has been granted to 60 animals.

 Italy knight

 Rome (Reuters): Franco Zeffirelli, the legendary filmmaker who has directed greats like Elizabeth Taylor and Placido Domingo, will be the first Italian to receive an honorary knighthood from Britain. The 81-year-old opera lover and director of films Romeo and Juliet, La Traviata and The Taming of the Shrew will be honoured at a ceremony at the British embassy in Rome. Zeffirelli, who burst on to the international film stage in the 1960s, hasn?t slowed down with age. He directed an ensemble of veteran women actors, including Judi Dench and Joan Plowright, in Tea with Mussolini in 1999 and most recently made Callas Forever about opera star Maria Callas, who was a close friend. In Italy, Zeffirelli, who is a member of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party, is also known for his conservative political views.

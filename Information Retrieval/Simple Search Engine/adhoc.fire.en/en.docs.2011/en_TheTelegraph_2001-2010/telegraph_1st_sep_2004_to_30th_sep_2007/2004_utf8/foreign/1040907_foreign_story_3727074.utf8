 Peoples general to keep uniform

 Islamabad, Sept. 6 (PTI): Indicating that he would not stick to his promise to quit as army chief by the end of the year, President Pervez Musharraf today claimed that most Pakistanis want him to retain the top post to maintain national stability. 

 Ninetysix per cent (of people) will say do not take off (uniform). You should go and ask this. They will say I should not remove uniform, Musharraf said in an interview to Pakistans ARY TV channel.

 these are things of significant national importance. If my uniform was needed for stability in this I will take that decision then, he said. 

 Musharraf had last year given a commitment to quit the army post by December, 2004, leading the Islamist alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA) to support his controversial Legal Framework Order and helped the government ratify them in parliament. 

 The Pakistani President said he will take a decision on his uniform according to the constitution. Now I have to see what people demand, what they think, what are their views, what they want and the second thing, which is very important, we have taken important decisions, he said.

 Musharraf said the MMA leader Qazi Hussain Ahmed, who has insisted that the President should quit the uniform, knew the constitutional position but was reluctant to admit it publicly. 

 I will not seek any amendment to the existing laws on the matter, he said adding that coping with terrorism and resolving the water issue was vital to the countrys stability.

 On the issue of terrorism, Musharraf said that an upheaval is going on and it will keep going on for some time. We have to bring it under control, he added. 

Bank security

 Pakistans Central Bank has told banks to beef up security and improve back-up systems to ensure they can continue operating in case of a terror attack or any other disaster, but it said the move was not in response to any specific threat.

 In a circular issued at the weekend, the State Bank of Pakistan said a highly vulnerable environment called for emergency preparedness and security measures. It directed banks and financial institutions to put in place contingency and business continuity plans within six months.

 Today, we are faced with multiple internal as well as external threats, it said, identifying a terrorist attack as among the possible risks.

 A central bank spokesman said today the circular had been issued because of the prevailing perception of threats to local and international security. There is no specific threat as such, he said.

 Pakistan, a key ally of the US in the war on terror, has seen a spate of deadly attacks on westerners, top government officials and religious minorities in the last couple of years. 

 Security forces blame al Qaida and its local supporters for most of these assaults, which have killed hundreds of people.

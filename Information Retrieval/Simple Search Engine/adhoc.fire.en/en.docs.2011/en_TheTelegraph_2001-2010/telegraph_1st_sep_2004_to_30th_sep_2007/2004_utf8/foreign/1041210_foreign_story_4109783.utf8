 Nike sorry

 Beijing, Dec. 9 (Reuters): Nike has apologised for a footwear ad featuring an attack on a kung fu master which was banned by China, saying it only intended to emulate the Hong Kong martial arts movie heroes of the 1970s.

 Chinas State Administration of Radio, Film and Television on Monday ordered stations nationwide to stop broadcasts of Nikes?LeBron James in Chamber of Fear? ads that it said had sparked anger and claims of offending?national feelings.?

 In the advertisement, James, 19, a forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, makes easy work of animated enemies including a white-haired kung fu master, two women in traditional Chinese garb and the pair of dragons as he ascends the video game-like levels of the?Chamber?.

 ?Nike expresses a deep apology to Chinese consumers for their concerns about LeBron James in the Chamber of Fear advertisements,? Nike said in a statement received by Reuters on Thursday.

 ?The idea of the advertisement came from Hong Kongs Kung fu movies of the 1970s. Nike hoped it could encourage Asia youth to face their fears in basketball.?

 The television administration had said the advertisement aroused?strong public indignation? by violating rules that stipulated?all ads broadcast on television should protect national dignity and interests and respect the motherlands traditional culture?.

 Nike ads featuring James and resembling graffiti last month provoked controversy and protests in ultra-tidy Singapore.

 About 50 people wrote to complain that the citys usually immaculate bus stops had suffered acts of vandalism after 700 of the posters went up, media said.

 Blair surprise

 Baghdad, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Protected by US Black Hawk helicopters, Tony Blair flew into Baghdad today in a surprise show of political bravado designed to boost prospects for Iraqi elections in January.

 The Prime Minister?s trip also sent a defiant message back home where Britons? disquiet over Iraq is likely to reduce the margin of his expected general election victory next year. While Iraq war ally President George W. Bush stayed at Baghdad airport a year ago, Blair chose to go straight into the central Green Zone on a military Puma helicopter. ?We stand on the side of the democrats against the terrorists... Whatever people felt about the original conflict, we the British aren?t a nation of quitters,? he said.

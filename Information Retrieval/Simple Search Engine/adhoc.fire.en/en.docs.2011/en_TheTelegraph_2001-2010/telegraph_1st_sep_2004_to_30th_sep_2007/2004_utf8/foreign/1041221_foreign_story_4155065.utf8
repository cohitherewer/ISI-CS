 Maoists in poll sabotage threat

 Kathmandu, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Nepal?s Maoist guerrillas will sabotage elections if the government goes ahead with them without meeting their demands to abolish the monarchy, the rebel chief said in remarks published today.

 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has given the Maoists until January 13 to begin talks to end the insurgency that has claimed more than 10,000 lives. Deuba has vowed to hold long-delayed elections by April even if the insurgents failed to respond.

 ?In fact, talking about elections without addressing the existing situation will ultimately lead to (more) bloodshed and is part of a conspiracy to complicate the situation,? rebel leader Prachanda (one name) said in an interview with the Nepal Samacharpatra newspaper.

 More than 80 people have been killed in the past week, as the rebels escalated attacks across the kingdom, including a string of bombings in the capital. ?We are committed to destroying these elections, under the existing conditions,? the rebel chief said.

 His comments came as schools and businesses closed and most public transport shut down in Kathmandu today in response to a two-day strike called by a group close to the rebels to press the release of jailed members.

 A Nepali cabinet minister said today the government was ready for talks with the rebels but would push ahead with plans for elections even if the Maoists failed to respond to the January deadline.

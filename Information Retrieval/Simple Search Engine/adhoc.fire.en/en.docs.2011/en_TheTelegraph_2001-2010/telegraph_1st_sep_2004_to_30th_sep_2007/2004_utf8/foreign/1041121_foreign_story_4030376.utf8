 Arnie in President bid buzz

 Sacramento (California), Nov. 20: More and more, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is acting as if he wants to be President. 

 Although he insists he is not aiming for the Oval Office, Schwarzenegger is keeping a public schedule that repeatedly puts him in forums that cast him as a political figure of global stature. He is using his office in ways that analysts and public officials say could strengthen a presidential bid if the Constitution is ever amended to allow foreign-born citizens to run. 

 He signed no deals and created no new jobs during his recent four-day trade mission to Tokyo, but the governor produced one enduring image that could pay off should he ever run for President: a face-to-face meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister. 

 One year into his term, he has visited the king of Jordan and the Prime Minister of Israel. At President Bush?s behest, he represented the US at a funeral for the Austrian President in July. He plans to visit China and Europe next year, where he can expect to meet more foreign leaders and speed his evolution in the public consciousness from entertainer to serious political figure.

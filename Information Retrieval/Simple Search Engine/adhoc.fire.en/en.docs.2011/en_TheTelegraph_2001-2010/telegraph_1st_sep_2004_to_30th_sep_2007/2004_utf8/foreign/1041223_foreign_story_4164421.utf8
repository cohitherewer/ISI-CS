 Painkiller warning to arthritis sufferers

 CELIA HALL

 London, Dec. 22: Hundreds of thousands of patients taking three brands of painkillers for arthritis were advised yesterday to see their doctors after new research raised fears of an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.

 The three drugs are Celebrex and Bextra made by Pfizer, and Arcoxia from Merck.

 The notice follows Merck?s voluntary withdrawal of Vioxx, a drug in the same class, two months ago because of similar findings.

 People taking the drugs who already run the risk of heart attacks or strokes will have their treatment changed, the government?s advisory agency on medicines said. For others, doctors will consider the alternatives.

 The advice followed the publication last week of a 33-month trial of Celebrex which found the increased risk of heart attacks and strokes in people taking 400mg or 800mg. The trial among 2,400 people was conducted by the National Cancer Institute in America and posted on Pfizer?s website.

 It found that people on a high dosage of Celebrex were 3.4 times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke and those on a lower amount were two-and-a-half times more likely compared with patients taking dummy pills.

 Celebrex is used by 600,000 people in Britain, many of them elderly. Vioxx was used by an estimated 400,000. Arcoxia and Bextra are used by more than 60,000 people.

 All four drugs are known as Cox-2 inhibitors and were heralded as safer than older painkillers. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said it was advising all patients taking Celebrex, Bextra or Arcoxia to seek ?non-urgent? appointments with their GP.

 The agency has not suspended or withdrawn the drugs. It said it was waiting to assess the new data. The charity Arthritis Care encouraged patients to heed the advice. 

 Flu threat: Japan?s health ministry said today that at least one person had been infected with the bird flu virus after an outbreak among chickens in February.

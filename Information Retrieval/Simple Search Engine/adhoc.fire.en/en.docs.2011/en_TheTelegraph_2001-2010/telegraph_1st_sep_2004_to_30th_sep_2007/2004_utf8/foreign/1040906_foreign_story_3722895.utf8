 Fine Print

 Novel nuptial

Jerusalem, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Defying a life prison term 

in isolation, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabins assassin has secretly married 

by proxy, his bride said.

 Larisa Trimbobler said she hoped her in-absentia wedding to Yigal Amir last month would help overturn a court ban on conjugal visits for the ultranationalist who shot Rabin at a 1995 rally in a bid to block peace deals with the Palestinians.

 Jewish law requires that two men witness a bride receiving her ring and marriage contract from the groom. According to Israeli media, Amir empowered his father to carry out the ritual in his stead and may have joined in by telephone.

 Trump card

Los Angeles (Reuters): Now that her ex-husband The Donald 

has become a TV star as host of The Apprentice, Ivana Trump is coming to 

prime time with a show of her own, helping a mature woman find love with a younger 

man. The 55-year-old Czech-born former model will assume the role of matchmaker 

in a two-hour reality special tentatively titled Ivana Man, aimed for later 

this season on Fox television. For years, rich older men have traded in their 

wives for pretty young women with bigger attributes, but now mature women 

are finding that true love can happen with younger men, Fox reality TV guru Mike 

Darnell said. 

 Spy spook

 London (Reuters): An unemployed man was charged with aggravated 

burglary and attempted robbery on Saturday after a machete-wielding attacker wounded 

two security guards at Britains MI5 spy headquarters. William Phillip Duncan 

Cornford, 41, armed with a large knife and a machete, was arrested on Friday after 

officers brought him down with an electric stun gun.

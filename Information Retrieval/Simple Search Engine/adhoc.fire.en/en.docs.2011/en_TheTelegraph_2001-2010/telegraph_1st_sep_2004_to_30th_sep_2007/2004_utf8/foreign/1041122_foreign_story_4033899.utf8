 Reform riddle in Myanmar release

 Bangkok, Nov. 21 (Reuters): As the man who was Myanmar?s second most prominent political prisoner enjoyed his first full day of freedom today, speculation deepened as to whether Min Ko Naing?s sudden release portends serious political reform.

 Hours after being granted his freedom, the former student leader who was jailed in March 1989 said he felt as if he had ?awoken from dreamland? and just started to open his eyes.

 But analysts say it is still too early to tell if he will notice any real change in the military junta that has kept him under lock and key for more than 15 years, and run the former Burma under various guises for more than four decades. In the murky and mysterious world of Myanmar military politics, optimists have a habit of being disappointed.

 ?I think we definitely still need to be cautious,? said Aung Zaw, editor of the Irrawaddy magazine, a Myanmar newspaper based in Thailand, adding that the motives of Yangon?s secretive generals were still unclear.

 This weekend?s mass prisoner release, which included a handful of opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) members, surprised analysts who saw last month?s purging of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt as a step back for a political reform.

 But opposition figurehead Aung San Suu Kyi was not among those released ? the Nobel laureate remains under house arrest in her lakeside Yangon villa, and initial reports about the release of a high-profile aide, Win Tin, were false.

 ?Of course, this is good news but I think people in Yangon remain quite sceptical, especially because the reports of Win Tin being released turned out not to be true, and the number of political prisoners released was tiny,? Zaw said.

 The junta, now under the exclusive control of army strongman Than Shwe, presented the mass release as a correction of arrests made ?inappropriately? under Khin Nyunt?s now dismantled military intelligence apparatus.

 However, the presentation of corruption charges to explain Khin Nyunt?s dismissal cut little ice with analysts, who say the military administration is graft-ridden.

 Only if the junta released Suu Kyi and started making credible noises about political reconciliation could people be sure it was serious about restoring democratic rule, said exiled opposition analyst Aung Naing Oo.

 ?If it starts talking about some concessions, for example, we will probably see the beginning of a political process moving towards liberalisation,? Aung Naing Oo said.

 In Yangon, the NLD was keeping a low profile, still reluctant to confirm the names of freed colleagues, possibly in case it triggered celebrations that might provoke a backlash from the ruling junta.

 Other analysts have pointed to a summit on November 29 of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), one of the few international groupings to let in Myanmar, as a possible catalyst. Despite its policy of ?constructive engagement? with the diplomatically isolated generals, Asean was expected to hit them with tough questions about Suu Kyi?s detention and the fate of Khin Nyunt?s ?roadmap to democracy?.

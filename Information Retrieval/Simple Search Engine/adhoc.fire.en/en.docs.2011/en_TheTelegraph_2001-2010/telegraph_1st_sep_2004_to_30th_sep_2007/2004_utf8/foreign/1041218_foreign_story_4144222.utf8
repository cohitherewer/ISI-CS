 CIA secret prison in a prison

 Washington, Dec. 17: Within the heavily guarded perimeters of the defence department?s much-discussed Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba, the CIA has maintained a detention facility for valuable al Qaida captives that has never been mentioned in public, according to military officials and several current and former intelligence officers.

 The buildings used by the CIA are shrouded by high fences covered with thick green mesh plastic and ringed with floodlights, officials said. They sit within the larger Camp Echo complex, which was erected to house the defence department?s high-value detainees and those awaiting military trials on terrorism charges.

 The facility has housed detainees from Pakistan, West Africa, Yemen and other countries under the strictest secrecy, the sources said. ?People are constantly leaving and coming,? said one US official who visited the base in recent months. It is unclear whether the facility is still in operation today. 

 Most international terrorism suspects in US custody are held not by the CIA but by the defence department at the Guantanamo Bay prison. They are guaranteed access to the Red Cross and, as a result of a US Supreme Court ruling this year, have the right to challenge their imprisonment in federal courts.

 CIA detainees, by contrast, are held under separate rules and far greater secrecy. Under a presidential directive and authorities approved by administration lawyers, the CIA is allowed to capture and hold certain classes of suspects without accounting for them in any public way and without revealing the rules for their treatment. The roster of CIA prisoners is not public, but current and former US intelligence officials say the agency holds the most valuable al Qaida leaders and many mid-level members with knowledge of the group?s logistics, financing and regional operations. 

 The CIA facility at the Guantanamo Bay prison was constructed over the past year as the agency confronted one of its toughest emerging problems: where to hold terrorists for interrogations that could last for years.

 During the 1990s, the CIA typically had custody of half-a-dozen terrorists at any time and usually kept them in foreign prisons, mostly in Egypt and Jordan. But just two months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, CIA paramilitary teams working with foreign intelligence services had arrested dozens of people thought to have knowledge of upcoming attacks on the US.

 The CIA is believed to be holding about three dozen al Qaida leaders in undisclosed locations, US national security officials say.

 Blair to meet Bush 

 London, Nov. 7 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair will seek this week to use his support for President George W. Bush in Iraq as a lever for greater US commitment to the quest for peace in West Asia.

 The first world leader to meet Bush since his re-election last week, Blair will be eager to show dissenters at home and across Europe that his often unpopular support for the US leader can pay dividends, commentators said.

 In a speech congratulating Bush on his election victory last week, Blair stressed that revitalising West Asian peacemaking was ?the single most pressing political challenge in our world today?.

 A spokesperson for Blair?s Downing Street office said the two leaders? talks, scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Washington, would focus on the agenda set out in that speech. The spokesperson declined comment on a Sunday Times newspaper report that Blair would try to secure Bush?s backing for a special conference of key Israeli and Palestinian figures in London in the new year.

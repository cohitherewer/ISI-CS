 Hollywood space flop show

 Pasadena (California), Sept. 

 8 (Reuters): A space capsule returning solar particles 

 to Earth after a three-year mission that probed the origins 

 of the solar system crashed in the Utah desert before it 

 could be captured in a mid-air recovery, officials at the 

 Jet Propulsion Laboratory said today.

 The silver, disc-shaped capsule containing ?star dust? was jettisoned as planned by the Genesis spacecraft but its parachute failed to deploy and the capsule spun out of control and crashed on the floor of the Utah desert.

 It was not immediately known if the container carrying the solar material inside the capsule survived the impact. Helicopters arrived at the scene to assess the damage and the prospects for retrieval.

 ?As it came within range of cameras we could tell there was no chute deployment,? a Nasa official said watching the descent on live television at JPL headquarters in Pasadena.

 Two Hollywood helicopter stunt pilots had been in the air to retrieve the capsule but their mission was aborted when the parachute failed to deploy.

 The container inside the capsule had solar ions, some as light as a few grains of sand. It was the first extraterrestrial matter to be returned to Earth by a spacecraft since the US Apollo and Soviet Luna missions brought back moon rocks in the 1970s.

 Genesis collected ions blown by solar winds on wafers of silicon, diamond, sapphire, gold and other materials in what scientists described as a ?fossil record? of the Sun. The atoms of oxygen, nitrogen and other elements aboard Genesis, if they survived the crash, will be studied for decades by the world?s scientists ?to learn how the solar system originated and evolved to their current diverse state,? Genesis programme scientist David Lindstrom said.

 ?It?s an important benchmark against which earlier models of the solar system will be compared,? he said.

 The planned mid-air retrieval by pilots Cliff Fleming and Dan Rudert, whose resumes include aerial stunts for action films like Batman and Hulk, would have made aviation history by capturing the first man-made object to enter Earth?s atmosphere from outer space, Corwin said.

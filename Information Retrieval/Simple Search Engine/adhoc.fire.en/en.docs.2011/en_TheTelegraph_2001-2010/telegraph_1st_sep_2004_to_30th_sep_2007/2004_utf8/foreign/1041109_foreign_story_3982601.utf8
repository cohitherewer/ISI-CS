 Armitage in Pak for talks

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Nov. 8: US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage arrived here today for talks on ?promoting a stable and lasting relationship? with Pakistan. 

 Armitage, who is visiting Pakistan for the first time after President George W. Bush?s re-election last week, will hold talks with foreign secretary Riaz H.Khokhar in Islamabad tomorrow. 

 ?We will underline the need of continuity in the American policies vis-?-vis Pakistan in the talks with Armitage,? foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said. 

 Armitage?s itinerary in Islamabad also includes meetings with President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri. 

 Continuing Pakistan-US cooperation in the war against terrorism and Pakistan?s relations with India will figure in the talks. Pakistani officials hope the talks will go a long way in bolstering cooperation in economic, commercial, trade and defence fields. The Pakistan-US Defence Consultative Group is also scheduled to meet next month.

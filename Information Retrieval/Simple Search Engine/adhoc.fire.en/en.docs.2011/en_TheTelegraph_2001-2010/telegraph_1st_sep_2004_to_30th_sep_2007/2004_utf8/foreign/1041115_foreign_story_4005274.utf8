 Kerry?s ex-flame sheds light on bedroom ?caveman? 

 PHILIP SHERWELL 

 John Kerry

 Washington, Nov. 14: If 

 John Kerry came across as stiff and awkward during his bid 

 for the White House, then a very different picture of him 

 is emerging ? as a silver-tongued womaniser ? in a book 

 to go on sale this month.

 Lee Roystone, a former girlfriend of Kerry, has written a semi-autobiographical novel in which her fictional alter ego, Nikki Matthews, has an on-off affair with a dashing Massachusetts senator ? a Democrat who she says is modelled on Kerry.

 Nikki, a Harvard graduate, describes her politician lover as a ?caveman? in the bedroom who would whisper sweet nothings to her in French ? a language Kerry speaks fluently. He has a home on Beacon Hill, Boston, like Kerry.

 In another part of the book, Hedge Fund Mistress, Nikki tells a friend about a particularly wild encounter over dinner with her political paramour, Senator Jim Hoyt. ?We were sitting at one end of the long dining room table and suddenly we were feeding each other and kissing, and all over each other, and undressing each other and plates were falling on the floor, food was everywhere, you know, our usual combustible frenzy, and then he carried me to the bedroom,? she writes. 

 Asked by her friend what happened next, Nikki says: ?We made mad, passionate love and he immediately fell asleep.? The unfortunate Nikki, however, almost dies as the senator lies snoring while she goes into anaphylactic shock from eating shellfish.

 Roystone recently caused a stir when she unveiled a website of memorabilia dating from her relationship with Kerry 14 years ago.

 She finished the book several months ago, but delayed publication until after the election. Roystone feared jeopardising the ambitions of a man whom she admits that she is still besotted with, although he broke her heart.

 She says that she had a 20-month affair with Kerry, who was single at the time after his divorce from his first wife, Julia Thorne. He started to see Teresa Heinz, the widowed ketchup and baked beans heiress, in 1992 and they married in 1995.

 The Daily Telegraph is the first newspaper to see the final draft of the book which Roystone is bringing out in a self-publishing deal later this month. Even after the election, Hedge Fund Mistress promises to embarrass Kerry.

 Although her Mills and Boon writing style will not win rave reviews, readers are treated to an ?insider? account of the senator?s bachelor days. Nikki describes the first time she met Senator Hoyt at a Democratic fund-raiser. ?His dark eyes ? were they green or brown or hazel? ? skittered around until they came to rest on her high black heels. His gaze moved slowly up the length of her body until they met her eyes. Nikki felt an electric jolt.? 

 Their romance, however, was not to last. Humiliated several times as the senator attends functions with other women, Nikki almost stops eating and eventually becomes seriously ill. ?The events in the chapter are all true,? said Roystone, 42, last week. ?I don?t think there?s anything derogatory or pornographic there, but I have told the story as it was. I?d thought of sending him a copy, but perhaps I?ll let him go out and buy it in a bookstore. He?s pretty thick-skinned and I doubt this will puncture that.

 ?I was young and smitten back then, and he was single and attractive. There were a lot of women in his life at that time. I still think very highly of him, but I sometimes wonder if he thinks about those little women now, about what happened to them.?

 The book?s title refers to Nikki?s subsequent affairs with two billionaires ? a pharmaceutical heir and a hedge fund supremo. It culminates when Hoyt runs for President several years after his fling with Nikki but loses, after a closely-fought campaign.

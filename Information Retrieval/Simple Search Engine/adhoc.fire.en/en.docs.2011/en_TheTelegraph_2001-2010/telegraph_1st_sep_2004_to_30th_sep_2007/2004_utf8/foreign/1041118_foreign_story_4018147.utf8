 ?Slender with spine of steel?

 SALLY POOK

 Margaret Hassan

 London, Nov. 17: Margaret Hassan spent more than 30 years of her life devoted to aid work among the disadvantaged in her adoptive homeland of Iraq.

 Born in Dublin and brought up in England, she moved to Iraq after marrying Tahseen Ali Hassan, an engineer, whom she met at university. Once in Baghdad, she began working for the British Council, teaching English to Iraqis. She soon developed a passion for the country, converted to Islam and took Iraqi citizenship. 

 After Saddam Hussein?s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 the council closed its offices and Hassan joined Care International, the world?s largest aid organisation. The charity runs nutrition, health and water programmes in Iraq.

 Known locally as ?modern-day Mother Teresa?, Hassan was described by friends as an extraordinary woman. She became a tireless advocate on behalf of the Iraqi people, particularly children.

 ?She is one of those slender people with a spine of steel,? said Felicity Arbuthnot, a film-maker who travelled to Iraq to document her work. 

 Hassan was a vehement opponent of the sanctions imposed against Iraq. Before the war last year, she warned both the UN and MPs in London that a fresh conflict would provoke a humanitarian catastrophe. ?The Iraqi people are already living through a terrible emergency,? she told a House of Commons briefing.

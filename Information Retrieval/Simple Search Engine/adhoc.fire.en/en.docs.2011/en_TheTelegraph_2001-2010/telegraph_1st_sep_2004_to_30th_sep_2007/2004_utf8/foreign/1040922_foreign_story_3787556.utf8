 Bloggers put CBS in a spot

 Dan Rather

 Los Angeles, Sept. 21 (Reuters): 

 Internet bloggers have drawn blood and American journalism 

 may never be the same.

 To hear some press experts tell it, CBS? admission yesterday that it was duped into using questionable documents about President George W. Bush?s National Guard service during the Vietnam War was a watershed moment brought on by a small army of Internet-based commentators known as bloggers.

 Their insistence, from the moment that CBS aired its report almost two weeks ago, that the documents were fake turned the question into a national issue ending with Rather, CBS and the American media establishment in a state of deep embarrassment.

 Orville Schell, dean of the school of journalism at the University of California in Berkeley, said CBS? admission of error after days of stonewalling was ?a landmark moment for the balance between the blogosphere and mainstream media.?

 Bloggers were the first to challenge the authenticity of the documents and the first to publish detailed examinations of the evidence by dozens of self-declared experts, some of them with Republican party ties.

 ?The credibility of the media has taken another hit, especially when you consider the story is not Dan Rather but President Bush?s service in the National Guard,? Schell said.

 That latter story ? that said George W. Bush ducked military service in Vietnam by entering the Guard and then getting special treatment thanks to his powerful father ? has been lost in the welter of complaints about the CBS story.

 It was not the first time that bloggers have stuck.

 Often working anonymously, bloggers have fanned the flames of controversies ranging from whether Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry deserved his Vietnam medals to whether Republican Trent Lott should remain a Senate leader after praising a segregationist.

 Atlantis trail

 Nicosia, Nov. 14 (Reuters): An American researcher on the trail of the lost city of Atlantis has discovered evidence of man-made structures submerged in the sea between Cyprus and Syria, a member of his team said yesterday.

 Robert Sarmast is convinced the fabled city lurks in the watery depths off Cyprus. 

 ?Something has been found to indicate very strongly that there are man-made structures somewhere between Cyprus and Syria,? a spokesperson said.

 The mystery of Atlantis, both whether it existed and why it disappeared, has fired the imagination of explorers for decades.

 Sarmast?s theory is that Cyprus is the pinnacle of Atlantis, with the rest of it about 1.6 km below sea level.

 Bull tamer

 Berlin (Reuters): A wild bull on the 

 loose in southern Germany was brought under control by the 

 charms of a cow which lured the distressed male back to 

 the barn, police said. ?When bulls break out there?s no 

 telling what might happen,? a police spokesperson in the 

 town of Hof said. ?He was pretty worked up.? Authorities 

 were getting a tranquiliser gun ready when the farmer?s 

 niece suggested luring the bull back home with a cow on 

 a leash. ?It worked,? the spokesperson said. ?He calmed 

 right down and trotted behind her back to the barn.?

 Charity date

 New York (Reuters): Want to see a middle-aged guy with a receding hairline and a paunch take off his clothes? The Rotary Club in Batavia, New York, is hoping thousands of people want a good look. The charity is publishing a calendar for 2005 featuring 13 of its members in the buff. As old as 65, the models bare nearly all. Mr. January covers his critical bits with a jackhammer. Mr. February poses behind a bouquet of well-placed flowers, while Mr. May perches on a desk with a laptop in his lap.

 The models include a retired dentist and a building contractor. The local county manager, Mr. April, wears nearly nothing save his running shoes.

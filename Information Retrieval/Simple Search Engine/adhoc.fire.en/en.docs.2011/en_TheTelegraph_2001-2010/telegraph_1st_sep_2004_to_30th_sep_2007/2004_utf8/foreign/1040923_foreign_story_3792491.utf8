 Bush soft line to woo women

 DAVID RENNIE 

 Derry, Sept. 22: George W. Bush is poised to re-write American political history with the help of tens of thousands of women such as Dina Murphy, a young mother from the swing state of New Hampshire.

 By her own admission, Murphy is ?not very political?. In the last three presidential elections, she voted Democrat, most recently for Al Gore in 2000, and she was far from alone. So many women voted Gore in New Hampshire that the flinty, normally conservative New England state nearly cost Bush the White House. In the end, it went Republican by just 7,000 votes.

 This time, Murphy thinks she will be voting Republican. In a world made far more frightening by the September 11 attacks and the war on terror, she is looking for a President she can trust to keep her family safe. Women such as Murphy offer a historic opportunity for Bush to overturn a ?gender-gap? that has sustained Democrats for decades. In a development that has galvanised US poll watchers, there are signs that Bush is succeeding. In a slew of recent polls, Bush has suddenly overtaken Kerry among women. In a July New York Times poll, women favoured Kerry over Bush by 52 to 40 per cent. In a new poll, Bush leads Kerry among women by 48 to 43 per cent.

 Possibly to her slight surprise, Murphy attended a political rally for Bush this week in the New Hampshire town of Derry. More than anything else, Murphy was looking to be reassured.

 ?I don?t feel comfortable voting for Kerry,? she said. ?It?s just a feeling, a comfort level. I trust Bush more to lead our country.?

 There is every sign that Bush senses the importance of the moment. Gone is the Bush swagger, the talk of catching terrorists ?dead or alive? or ?smoking ?em out of their holes, and bringing ?em to justice?, as he used to say.

 In Derry, when defending his war on terror, he spent more time talking about the Taliban than he did about Saddam Hussein. ?Young girls were not allowed to go to school,? he said, his voice quavering slightly with emotion. 

 ?Their mothers were executed in sports stadiums if they stepped out of line.? Ten million people in Afghanistan had registered to vote, 40 per cent of them women. How ?fantastic?, he said, shaking his head in wonder.

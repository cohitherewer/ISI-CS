 Times to be tabloid-only paper

 London, Oct. 29 (Reuters): The Times, it is a-changing.

 After 216 years as a broadsheet newspaper, The Times will become a tabloid-only publication starting on Monday. The move follows a decision 11 months ago to publish the British national daily, owned by a unit of Rupert Murdoch?s News Corp, in two different formats, which helped it reverse a downturn in circulation.

 It also follows a growing trend in the UK to publish smaller newspapers. The Times followed The Independent?s decision to become tabloid in September 2003.

 ?The move is a response to clear reader demand and we look forward to a compact future,? Times general manager Paul Hayes said.

 ?No Times staffers are affected by this,? a spokeswoman for the newspaper said in response to a report in the Guardian that some journalists would be sacked.

 The Times will still cost 50 pence during the week and 90 pence on Saturday. The Sunday Times will remain a broadsheet.

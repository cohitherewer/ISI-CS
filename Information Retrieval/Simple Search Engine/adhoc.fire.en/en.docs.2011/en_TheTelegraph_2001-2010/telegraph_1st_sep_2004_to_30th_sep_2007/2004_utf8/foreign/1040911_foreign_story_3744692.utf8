New York, Sept. 10 (AP): Now that baby Apple?s 

on board, actress Gwyneth Paltrow is putting the brakes on her film career.

 ?I can?t imagine going back to shoot a movie,? Paltrow reveals in the latest Entertainment Weekly, hitting newsstands today. ?I don?t imagine that I?m going to take on something very big in the next 6, 8, 10, 12 months.?

 But that doesn?t mean the London-based Shallow Hal actress has been off the road since giving birth to her child with husband ? and Coldplay frontman ? Chris Martin. 

 She presented the video of the year award during the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards in Miami and appeared on Oprah Winfrey?s season opener in Chicago with Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow co-star Jude Law.

 But what will Paltrow do with her non-shooting spare time? If her last three months with Apple is any indication, it might include attending pilates class or watching reality TV fare like MTV?s Newlyweds, staring Paltrow?s personal favourite, singer Jessica Simpson.

 ?I?m just glad that there?s one super-popular girl in america who?s not drunk, sleeping with tons of people, and wearing incredibly revealing, inappropriate outfits,? Paltrow told EW.

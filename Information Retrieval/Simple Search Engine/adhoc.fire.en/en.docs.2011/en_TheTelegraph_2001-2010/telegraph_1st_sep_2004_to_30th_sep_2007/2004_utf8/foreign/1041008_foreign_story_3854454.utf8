 Car bombing kills 40 in Multan

 Islamabad, Oct 7: A car 

 bomb explosion in Pakistan?s Multan city on Thursday killed 

 at least 39 Sunni Muslims and injured more than 100.

 This was second major incident 

 of terrorism in less than a week and the fifth since March 

 this year, causing ripples all over Pakistan about ?ineffective 

 security arrangements? by law enforcement agencies.

 The car bomb exploded near a gathering 

 held in the neighbourhood of Multan to commemorate first 

 anniversary of their leader, Maulana Azam Tariq, who was 

 gunned down a year ago on the outskirts of Islamabad. At 

 least 50 people were seriously injured in the blast, which 

 provoked activists of Millat-e-Islamia party (new name of 

 banned Sipah-e-Sihaba Pakistan), who chanted anti-government 

 slogans, demanding President Pervez Musharraf to give up 

 support to the US and its agenda to kill Mulsims.

 Deputy chief of Multan police 

 Talat Mehmood Tariq said a remote control device caused 

 the blast, which completely destroyed the car that was parked 

 a few hundred metres from the site of explosion.

 He said the device weighed 7 kg 

 and most of the casualties were caused by shrapnel of the 

 car, which was blown into pieces.

 Tariq said the explosives-laden 

 car was blown up once the congregation of more than 1,500 

 people began dispersing at 4.30 am ahead of the morning 

 prayers.

 The explosion also blew up a nearby 

 electricity transformer, cutting off the power to the area.

 As the relatives and friends of 

 the blast victims identified 36 bodies, hundreds of mourners 

 offered funeral prayers this afternoon in Multan.

 ?Relatives and friends claimed 

 the bodies after identification and took them to their native 

 towns,? a local Ahmad Tanvir said adding that more bodies 

 are still lying in hospitals for identification.

 Chief of the Millat-e-Islamiya 

 party Maulana Mohammad Ahmad Ludhiyanvi gave a seven-day 

 deadline to the government to arrest the ?culprits, while 

 addressing the mournters.?

 ?We will ourselves trace out the 

 culprits and award them exemplary punishment if the government 

 fails to arrest them by next Friday,? he said.

 He castigated President General 

 Pervez Musharraf for pursuing the US policy of genocide 

 in Pakistan?s tribal region of South Waziristan, saying 

 that killing of innocent people in the region should be 

 stopped forthwith.

 Pakistani security forces had 

 moved into South Waziristan, bordering Afghanistan?s Paktika 

 province in October last to hunt down suspected foreign 

 militants and their local supporters there. Authorities 

 believe that up to 600 suspected militants are still hiding.

 The attack in Multan, 425 km southwest 

 of Islamabad, came less than a week after a suicide attack 

 on a mosque of the minority Shias in eastern city of Sialkot, 

 which had killed at least 31 people, when a suicide bomber 

 had blown himself up in the middle of Friday prayers.

 At least 100 people were killed 

 in two different suicide bomb attacks on Shiite mosques 

 in Karachi on May 9 and May 31 this year.

 Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed 

 Khan Sherpao suspected Thursday?s attack was sectarian. 

 quot;It appears to be related to the Sialkot blast, quot; 

 he told reporters in Islamabad in the first official reaction.

 Officials had described the Sialkot 

 blast as reaction of the one of the 20 top most wanted terrorists 

 Amjad Farooqi?s killing in a shoot out with security forces 

 early this month in southwestern city of Nawabshah. 

 Farooqi, who was active member 

 of rabidly Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, an offshoot of SSP, is said 

 to be one of the masterminds of two assassination bids on 

 President Pervez Musharraf in December last year and murder 

 of American journalist Denial Pearl two years ago. ?Also, 

 there had to be a fallout of the killing of Amjad Farooqi,? 

 Sherpao said 

 Sherpao criticised the local administration 

 for allowing a religious gathering in the given circumstances. 

 ?Keeping in view the Sialkot blast and Farooqi?s killing, 

 it was not a wise decision,? he added. 

 The army was called out to maintain 

 law and order in the city.

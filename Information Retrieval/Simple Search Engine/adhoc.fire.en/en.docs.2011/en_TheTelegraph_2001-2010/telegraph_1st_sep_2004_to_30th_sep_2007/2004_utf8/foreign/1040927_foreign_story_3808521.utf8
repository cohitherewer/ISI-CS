 Fine Print

 Yale look at Jacko

 New Haven, Sept. 26 (AP): Michael Jackson, frequently savaged in the tabloid press, was picked apart by more rarified critics as scholars gathered for a conference on the pop star at Yale University.

 Eighteen scholars from US universities discussed sexual, racial and artistic aspects of Jackson?s life and music on Thursday and Friday in the first academic meeting to study him.

 Jackson ?in many ways is the black male crossover artist of the 20th century,? said Seth Clark Silberman, who teaches about race and gender at Yale. Panelists discussed Jackson?s plastic surgery and his skin tone change from dark to light, which Jackson says is due to a condition called Vitiligo. 

 Tan ban

 San Francisco (Reuters): California 

 governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill on Friday barring 

 children under 14 from going to tanning salons in his sunshine-filled 

 state. California lawmakers backed the legislation in May 

 citing concerns by dermatologists who blame the artificial 

 light in tanning booths for contributing to a rise in skin 

 cancer. Violators could be liable for a fine of up to $2,500. 

 Teenagers between the age of 14 and 18 need a note from 

 their parents to go to a tanning salon.

 Gender bind

 New York (Reuters): Ten-year olds who spend more time in activities typically associated with their gender tend to have more stereotypical academic interests, skills and characteristics two years later, research reports. For instance, girls who logged many hours on ?girl? activities like reading, knitting, dancing or playing with dolls tended to get better grades in English, show more signs of sensitivity, and were more likely to have low self-esteem, more common in girls, researchers noted.

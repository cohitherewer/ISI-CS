 Charles rebuked

 GEORGE JONES

 London, Nov. 19: The dispute between the Prince of Wales and the government over education intensified last night when a second cabinet minister rebuked the prince for claiming the current system fuelled unrealistic ambitions.

 The prince stood his ground despite being labelled ?old-fashioned and patronising? by Charles Clarke, the education secretary. In a speech to tourism leaders at Clarence House yesterday, Prince Charles said ?old-fashioned? views were coming round again ? and recalled that 12 years ago he had been ridiculed for having ?fiendishly old-fashioned views? that tourism and architecture needed to be environmentally friendly. Tony Blair sought to steer clear of what MPs described as the ?war of the Charleses?. But at Westminster, Labour MPs congratulated Clarke, patting him on the back when he arrived at the Commons. John Reid, the health secretary, showed no reluctance in joining his Cabinet colleague in casting aside the long-standing convention that ministers do not criticise the royal family.

 In an interview to be broadcast on Channel 4 tomorrow, Reid says that Clarke was ?a much bigger Charles in many ways?. While on many issues, such as organic food and the environment, Prince Charles had been ahead of the game, ?on this occasion I happen to think he is wrong?. Reid, describing himself as a meritocrat, said ambition was the driving force of the country. Children should be told: ?Whether you go to public school, private or state schools, whatever background you come from, you have it in you, if you use your own endeavours and energies, to be almost anything in this country.? 

 The prince said the education system made people believe they could be ?pop stars, High Court judges, TV presenters or heads of state? without the effort or having the natural ability.

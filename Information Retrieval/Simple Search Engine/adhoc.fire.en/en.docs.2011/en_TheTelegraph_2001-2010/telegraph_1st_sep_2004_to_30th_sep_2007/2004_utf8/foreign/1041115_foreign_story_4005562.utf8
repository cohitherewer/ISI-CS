 Merck ignored painkiller risk alert: Report

 New York, Nov. 14 (Reuters): Top executives at pharmaceutical giant Merck amp; Co Inc. decided in May 2000 against developing a study to test directly whether its Vioxx painkiller drug might pose a heart risk, The New York Times reported today.

 Just two months after results from a clinical trial suggested concerns the popular anti-arthritis drug might cause a higher risk of heart attacks, company scientists questioned whether a focused trial was possible and marketing executives apparently feared one would undermine sales, the Times reported in an article on its website.

 Merck?s marketers, meanwhile, apparently feared it could send the wrong signal about the company?s confidence in Vioxx, which already faced fierce competition from Celebrex.

 Merck recalled Vioxx on September 30 this year after a separate long-term clinical trial already under way in 2000 showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and strokes in patients who had taken it for over 18 months to prevent recurrence of colon polyps. Merck?s stock has fallen almost 38 per cent since.

 According to the Times report, based on what it called a detailed reconstruction of Merck?s handling of Vioxx, Merck scientists wondered in May 2000 whether a study to determine Vioxx?s cardiovascular risks, which might have required as many as 50,000 patients, was even possible.

 The Times reported that a slide prepared for a meeting of top executives said: ?At present, there is no compelling marketing need for such a study. Data would not be available during the critical period. The implied message is not favourable.?

 As recently as Friday, in newspaper advertisements, Merck has argued that it took ?prompt and decisive action? as soon as it knew that Vioxx was dangerous. 

 But a detailed reconstruction of Merck?s handling of Vioxx, based on interviews and internal company documents, suggests that actions the company took ? and did not take ? soon after the drug?s safety was questioned may have affected the health of potentially thousands of patients, as well as the company?s financial health and reputation. 

 Merck executives said that even if they had conducted the type of study they discussed internally and rejected in 2000, the company might not have detected Vioxx?s risks any sooner.

 ?Merck wasn?t dragging its feet,? said Kenneth C. Frazier, the company?s general counsel. ?It?s pretty hard for me to imagine that you could have done this more quickly than we did.?

 Today Merck faces not only Congressional and justice department investigations, but also potentially thousands of personal-injury lawsuits that could tie the company up in litigation for years and possibly cost it billions to resolve.

 Neverland named year?s best film

 Annette Bening

 New York, Dec. 2 (Reuters): Finding Neverland, a fictionalised account of the creation of children?s classic Peter Pan, was named best film of 2004 by The National Board of Review yesterday in the first major award of the Oscar season.

 Oscar hopeful Jamie Foxx was named best actor for Ray, director Taylor Hackford?s film about legendary singer Ray Charles, while Annette Bening won the best actress award for her role as a 1930s stage diva in Being Julia.

 The awards, voted on by about 150 members of a screening committee along with a 12-member awards panel, are sometimes an indicator of what to expect in the race for the Academy Awards in February, though frequently its choices are more esoteric than the Oscars.

 Finding Neverland director Marc Forster, who was shopping in a supermarket store when he heard news of the award, said his film offered an optimistic tale of mortality and growing up. ?We live in very dark times right now,? he said.

 The film is a fantasy about Scottish author J.M. Barrie and his friendship with a family of children including Peter, who is the model for Peter Pan, in Edwardian London. 

 The board?s list of top 10 films of the year had in second place The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a young Howard Hughes, followed by Mike Nichols? Closer, Clint Eastwood?s Million Dollar Baby and Sideways. Rounding out the top 10 were Kinsey followed in order by abortionist drama Vera Drake.

 Blockade threat fuels rush for oil in Nepal

 Kathmandu, Dec. 24 (Reuters): Hundreds of people queued up outside petrol stations in Nepal?s capital today fearing fuel shortages after Maoist rebels called for a ban on vehicles entering the city.

 Officials said Kathmandu, a city of 1.5 million people, had enough fuel supplies for about two weeks and food reserves for nearly a month, but residents weren?t so confident.

 ?I don?t want to take a chance and want to fill the fuel tank of my motorcycle,? said Gokarna Sigdel, standing outside a petrol pump in an upmarket area in Kathmandu.

 Trucks and buses stayed off the major highway linking the mountain-ringed Nepali capital with the southern plains because of the threat by rebels to attack vehicles defying the ban, now in its second day.

 A consumer group said prices of rice, oil and sugar had increased by up to 15 per cent and some goods, such as cooking gas and kerosene, had vanished from the market.

 ?This is only the beginning. The worst is yet to come if the ban does not end soon,? Nepal consumers? forum chief Harendra Bahadur Shrestha said. ?The government has failed to keep a record of the stock of goods available in the market and control hoarding,? he said. 

 The rebels are fighting to replace the constitutional monarchy with a communist republic and are notorious for their hit-and-run attacks on the military, police or anyone who defies their cause. While they are not present on the road, fears of being attacked kept drivers off the highway on which 90 per cent of goods to Kathmandu are carried.

 The ban is the second this year and is the latest tactic in their eight-year-old rebellion.

 The rebels cut off the capital from the rest of the country for a week in August, choking off food and fuel supplies.

 Transport operators said they were seeking compensation guarantees for vehicles if attacked. 

 ?We?ll not run until there is a convincing security guarantee,? said Shushil Nahata, chief of the Nepal Goods Carriers? Association.

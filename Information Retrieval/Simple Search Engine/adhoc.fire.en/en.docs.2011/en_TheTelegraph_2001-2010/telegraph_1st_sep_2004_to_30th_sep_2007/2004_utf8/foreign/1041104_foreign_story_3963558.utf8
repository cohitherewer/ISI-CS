 Daschle loses in shock result

 Tom Daschle 

 Washington, Nov. 3 (Reuters): 

 Republicans expanded their hold on the US Congress in yesterday?s 

 elections and Democrat Tom Daschle became the first Senate 

 leader in a half-century to be voted out of office, according 

 to network projections.

 While the outcome of the presidential race remained in dispute, Republicans retained control in the Senate and House of Representatives and positioned themselves to wield greater power in the US capital.

 The network projections showed Republicans would hold at least 53 of the 100 Senate seats, two more than they now have, and a slim majority of the 435-member House in the new 109th Congress, set to convene on January 3.

 Senate majority leader Bill Frist said it looked likely Republicans would win a total of 55 seats in the Senate, and add at least three seats in the House.

 ?It really is monumental. Nobody expected that. It is huge,? Frist told CNN, describing the election results as ?a huge endorsement of the President of the United States.? Speaking on ABC, Frist said he hoped strengthened Republican leadership in Congress could help end the ?extreme partisanship? that has plagued Congress in the past few years.

 Barack Obama, the state Senator from Illinois who emerged as one of his party?s brightest stars at last summer?s Democratic convention, handily won his race for the US Senate. He will become only the third Black senator since Reconstruction.

 Washington, Nov. 16: A Falls Church, Virginia, man who worked as a federal informant on terrorism set himself on fire in front of the White House yesterday, hours after announcing his suicide attempt and citing his growing despondency over how the FBI managed his case.

 Mohamed Alanssi, 52, approached the northwest guardhouse on Pennsylvania Avenue about 2.05 pm and asked the security detail to deliver a note to President Bush. When uniformed Secret Service officers turned him away, he stepped about 15 feet from the guard post and used a lighter to ignite his jacket, according to the US park police.

 Secret Service officers wrestled him to the ground and doused the flames with fire extinguishers. Alanssi was taken to Washington Hospital Center, where he was listed in critical condition with burns over about 30 per cent of his body, authorities said. 

 Alanssi, who is from Yemen and also uses the name Mohamed Alhadrami, recently discussed his work as a federal informant in a series of interviews with The Washington Post. 

 Yesterday morning, he informed the newspaper by faxed letter and by telephone that he was going to ?burn my body at unexpected place.? He also sent a copy of a letter he said he had faxed to the FBI agent in New York who is handling his case. 

 In two telephone conversations yesterday, Alanssi told a Post reporter that he would provide 10 minutes? notice of his suicide attempt and that only then would he reveal the location. When he called a third time, Alanssi said he had poured gasoline and would be setting himself on fire in two minutes, not 10, and it would take place near the White House. The newspaper informed DC police, who notified the special operations unit and the police.

 In the recent interviews, Alanssi expressed anguish over not being able to visit his family in Yemen. He said that he suffers from diabetes and heart problems and that his wife is seriously ill with stomach cancer.

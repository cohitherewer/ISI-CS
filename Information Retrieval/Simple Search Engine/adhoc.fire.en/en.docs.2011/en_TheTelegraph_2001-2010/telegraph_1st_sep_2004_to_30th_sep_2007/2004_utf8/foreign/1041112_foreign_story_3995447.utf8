 Silencer for cancer genes

 ROGER HIGHFIELD

 London, Nov. 11: The biggest 

 killers, such as cancer, obesity and heart disease, are 

 among a vast range of illnesses that could soon be treated 

 by a revolutionary method of ?silencing? genes that play 

 a role in the diseases.

 The technique, which represents the birth of an entirely new class of medicine, was first used to cut cholesterol levels, according to a report by American and German scientists in the journal Nature today. The method relies on a recent breakthrough in the use of RNA interference (RNAi).

 There has been much excitement about the potential for harnessing this established laboratory technique to create a new generation of drugs. The prospect, however, has not so far been realised because of the difficulty in delivering RNA, the genetic material, into cells.

 Until recently RNA was thought to carry out the commands of the DNA in cells, in effect translating genes into proteins, the chemicals that build and run the body. In the last decade, however, it was discovered that double-stranded RNA can be used to shut down specific genes.

 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company of Cambridge, Massachusetts, said it had developed a simple way to modify RNA by the use of an unlikely ally ? cholesterol. This has allowed it to be delivered, via an injection, to turn off a particular gene throughout a patient?s body.

 The advance was hailed as a ?breakthrough in molecular biology research? and a ?historical step forward? by Professor Phillip Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Nobel laureate and founder of Alnylam. The company will bring its first ?RNAi therapeutic? into the clinic next year to target VEGF, a protein which causes uncontrolled blood vessel growth in age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of adult blindness, said Dr John Maraganore, president of the company.

 Today?s study lays the foundation for RNAi-based-treatments for ?cardio-vascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hepatitis, cancer, and many infectious diseases?, he said.

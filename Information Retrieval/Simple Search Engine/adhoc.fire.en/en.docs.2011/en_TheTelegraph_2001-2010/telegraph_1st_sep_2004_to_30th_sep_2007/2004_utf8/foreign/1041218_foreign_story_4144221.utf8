 London, Dec. 17 (Reuters): 

 Hollywood actor Jim Carrey, in London to promote his latest 

 movie Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events, 

 was forced to flee his hotel today after a fire broke out.

 The film, in which Carrey plays the menacing Count Olaf, centres around three children whose parents are killed in a house fire.

 ?The movie?s all about fire and disaster and so I get up for the (press) junket today and suddenly my house is burning down, and I?m on the balcony like a damsel screaming with a very high pitched voice,? Carrey said. 

 ?No one rescued me, no one came, I had to find my own way out.?

 Despite the drama at London?s plush Claridge?s Hotel, Carrey was upbeat. ?I think it?s a very good sign.?

 He was not the only film star affected by the fire, which broke out in the kitchen of a hotel restaurant.

 Brad Pitt and Matt Damon had to cancel a press conference in the same building to promote their new blockbuster Ocean?s Twelve.

 Racy UK condom ads banned

 London, Oct. 13 (Reuters): British advertising authorities said today they have banned racy Trojan condom poster adverts with the phrase: ?Come online amp; play the sex organ.?

 The UK Advertising Standards Authority said the phrase could cause ?serious or widespread offence? and that the ads invited consumers to the company?s website, which linked to Trojan TV commercials unsuitable for people under the age of 18.

 It also is requiring Carter Products, which owns the Trojan brand in the UK, to clear future ads with the industry?s self-regulatory body, a company official said. 

 The authority, which received 41 complaints about the ads, ?acknowledged the advertisers wanted to promote safe sex and considered that the posters would not promote promiscuity,? which were among the company?s defences.

 About 3,500 of the posters were put up around the UK over the summer. They were made to look like a women?s magazine cover with Trojan? emblazoned where the title would be, and bold-letter headlines, including ?Amazing! Secrets of Sexual Pleasure Revealed,? on a photo of a woman with her mouth agape.

 Pak tribals fail to free hostages

 Tank, Pakistan, Oct. 13 (Reuters): A delegation of Pakistani tribesmen met the head of a group of al Qaida-linked militants holding two Chinese engineers hostage, but failed to secure their release, a member of the delegation said today.

 In talks last night, kidnap leader Abdullah Mehsud offered to free one of the two Pakistanis held with engineers Wang Ende and Wang Peng since Saturday in the remote South Waziristan tribal region bordering Afghanistan.

 But Abdullah, a former Guantanamo Bay inmate who is at a separate location from the kidnappers, insisted he would not order the freeing of the Chinese until his demands were met, said the source. 

 ?He did not spell out the demands, but repeated a demand for safe passage for both captors and the captives to join him.?

 A meeting of hundreds of elders of the Mehsud tribe to which Abdullah belongs met in Tank, near South Waziristan, but failed to find a solution to the standoff, said a leading elder, Qayum Sher.

 ?The tribal jirga has totally failed. We have been unable to rescue the Chinese,? he said. ?The last effort will be that relatives of Abdullah Mehsud will approach him to urge him to release the captives,? he said.

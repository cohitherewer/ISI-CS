 Kabul, Nov. 20 (Reuters): An Afghan man accused of killing four journalists in 2001, including two from Reuters, was found guilty today and sentenced to death after saying his gang was acting on the orders of a senior Taliban commander.

 Reza Khan, 29, was also found guilty of raping an Italian woman among the four journalists, and sentenced to 15 years in prison on that charge, said National Security Court judge Abdul Baset Bakhtari.

 In the same court hearing, Khan was convicted on separate charges of killing his wife and of holding up a bus and cutting off the ears and noses of four male passengers.

 ?The crimes are proven and there is no doubt about it,? Bakhtari told the court in reading the sentences.

 Khan stood impassively as the verdict was read.

 The four journalists, including Australian television cameraman Harry Burton and Afghan photographer Azizullah Haidari of Reuters, were killed on November 19, 2001, at Tangi Abrishum, about 90 km east of Kabul. They were both 33.

 Spanish journalist Julio Fuentes of El Mundo and Italian journalist Maria Grazia Cutuli of Corriere della Sera were the other two victims.

 The journalists were stopped on the road from Pakistan by a gang of about 12 gunmen while trying to reach Kabul days after the defeated Taliban had withdrawn from the city.

 Speaking in the judges? chambers before the hearing, Khan said he had shot ?the Afghan? among the journalists but insisted he had been ordered to and would have been killed if he had disobeyed. ?I fired two bullets from my gun and I killed the Afghan,? he said.

 In court before sentencing, he admitted killing his wife and attacking the bus passengers, but denied shooting any of the journalists and the charge of rape, however.

 ?I was forced to go there and I am really sorry for this action against the foreigners and locals,? he told the court. 

 ?I am seeking mercy because I was forced to go there by Mohammad Agha,? he said, referring to a local Taliban commander.

 Khan told the court that after the journalists were stopped and captured, Mohammad Agha had spoken by satellite telephone to a senior Taliban commander known as Mullah Brother who had given the order to kill them.

 He said they were made to stand in line with their hands tied and Mohammad Agha shot the woman first, about an hour or 90 minutes after they were first stopped, and then the others. ?He (Agha) said: ?We are going to do a jihad? and opened fire,? Khan said.

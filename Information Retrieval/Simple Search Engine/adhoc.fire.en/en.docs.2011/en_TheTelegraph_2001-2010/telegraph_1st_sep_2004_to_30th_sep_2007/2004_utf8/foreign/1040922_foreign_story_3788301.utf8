 Karachi, Sept. 21 (Reuters): Pakistan has stationed female security guards at US diplomatic missions because of fears they could be attacked by women suicide bombers, security officials said today.

 The women guards have been stationed at the US embassy in Islamabad, and consulates in the southern city of Karachi and the eastern city of Lahore, an interior ministry official said.

 ?We have done this as a matter of precaution. There is no specific information or threat as such,? he said. ?But there is a fear that women of Central Asian origin, or even Pakistanis, could be used in such attacks.? Karachi police chief Tariq Jameel said in the past, the threat posed by women had not been taken into account.

 ?We have deployed women security staff to check all women suspects,? he said. Pakistan became a front-line state in the US-led war on terror after the September 11 attacks on the US and has been the scene of repeated attacks by Islamic militants since then, including several on the US consulate in Karachi. The attacks have included several suicide bombings, but all carried out by men.

 Security forces have been pursuing hundreds of militants of Central Asian origin in Pakistans rugged tribal belt bordering Afghanistan since March.

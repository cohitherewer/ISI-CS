 Spiderman to take wing with 

thriller

 Tobey Maguire

 Los Angeles, Nov. 11 (Reuters): Tobey Maguire is taking flight to produce ? with an eye to star in ? Blackbird, a thriller that David Auburn will write for Columbia Pictures.

 Blackbird will be loosely based on a book proposal by Eric Olson titled Through the Glass Darkly, which has been set up at Regan Books. Olson?s father worked for the CIA when the agency performed LSD experiments in the 1960s, and he later died under mysterious circumstances. For 20 years, Olson?s family believed he committed suicide. When Olson found out that his father was given LSD by his employers a week before his death, he was compelled to investigate what happened.

 Maguire, who has a two-year, first-look deal at Columbia, has his hand in several producing projects, including Everything Changes, set up at Columbia, and Justice Deferred, set up at Warner Bros. Pictures. Also at Warners, Maguire Entertainment is producing Urban Townie with Paula Weinstein. Maguire was a producer of 2002?s 25th Hour, directed by Spike Lee.

 Maguire will reprise the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man for Columbia?s Spider-Man 3.

 Auburn won a Pulitzer Prize as well as a Tony Award for his play Proof, which he adapted into a feature film. 

 Set for a Christmas release, the Miramax feature stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins.

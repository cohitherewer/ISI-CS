 Suspected militant shot in Riyadh

 Riyadh, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Saudi police killed a suspected militant in a shootout in Riyadh and captured two wanted militants after a gun battle in the Red Sea city of Jeddah today, state television and security sources said.

 It was not clear if the militants were on the list of 26 most wanted militants linked to al Qaida, which has been waging a campaign of attacks in the world?s largest oil exporter.

 Security forces killed a man early today who had lobbed a hand grenade from his car at police combing a residential area in the capital Riyadh following a clash with militants the day before, state television said.

 ?Police followed the car and surrounded it and there was an exchange of fire in which the man was killed immediately,? it said.

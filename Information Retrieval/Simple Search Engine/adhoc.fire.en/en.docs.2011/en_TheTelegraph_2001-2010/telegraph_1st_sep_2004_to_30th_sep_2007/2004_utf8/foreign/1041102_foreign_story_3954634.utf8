 American, Nepali kidnapped

 Baghdad, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Gunmen kidnapped an American, a Nepali and two Arabs from their office in western Baghdad today, police said.

 ?They stormed the villa with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades,? said a police source. ?They had no chance.? The source said one man had been killed in the attack. He was thought to one of the kidnappers shot by a security guard at the Saudi Arabian company where the foreigners worked.

 The nationality of the Arabs snatched from the villa in Baghdad?s affluent Mansour district was unclear. Militants and criminals have kidnapped scores of foreigners, some of whom have been killed. 

 Gunmen assassinated the deputy governor of Baghdad today, a day after Iraq?s US-backed interim prime minister spoke of an imminent military showdown with rebels in the western city of Falluja.

 An interior ministry spokesman said Hatem Karim was killed and two bodyguards were wounded in a drive-by shooting in the southern Dora district of the Iraqi capital. There was no word on the motive for Karim?s killing, but rebels have killed many officials cooperating with US-led forces in Iraq.

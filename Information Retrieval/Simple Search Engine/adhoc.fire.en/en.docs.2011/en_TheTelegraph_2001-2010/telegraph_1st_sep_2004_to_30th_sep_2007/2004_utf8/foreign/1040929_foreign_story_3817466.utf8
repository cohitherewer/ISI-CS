 Crawford U-turn

 Crawford (Texas), Sept. 28 (Reuters): The newspaper in President George W. Bush?s adopted hometown of Crawford threw its support today behind Bush?s Democratic rival, Senator John Kerry.

 The weekly Lone Star Iconoclast criticised Bush?s handling of the war in Iraq and for turning budget surpluses into record deficits. The editorial also criticised Bush?s proposals on Social Security and Medicare. ?The publishers of The Iconoclast endorsed Bush four years ago, based on the things he promised, not on this smoke-screened agenda,? the newspaper said in its editorial. ?Today, we are endorsing his opponent, John Kerry.?

 It urged ?Texans not to rate the candidate by his hometown or even his political party, but instead by where he intends to take the country.? Bush spends many of his weekends and holidays at his Crawford, Texas, ranch.

 The Iconoclast?s publisher and editor-in-chief, W. Leon Smith, said the newspaper is sent to Bush?s ranch each week. ?But I don?t know if he reads it,? Smith said.

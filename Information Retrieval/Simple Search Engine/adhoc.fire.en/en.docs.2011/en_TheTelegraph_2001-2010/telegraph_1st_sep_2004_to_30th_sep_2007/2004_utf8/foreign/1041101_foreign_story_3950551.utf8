 Super casinos await UK nod

 London, Oct. 31 (Reuters): As Britain?s parliament prepares to vote on controversial new gambling laws, the government said today it would consider changes to calm critics of reforms that could allow giant casinos to spring up around the country.

 Members of parliament will pass judgment tomorrow on the government?s Gambling Bill ? intended to shake up 40-year-old laws ? with opposition parties and some of Blair?s followers pledging to vote against it.

 Culture, media and sport secretary Tessa Jowell insisted 90 per cent of the bill was about regulation and safeguards. She would not offer a cap on the number of Las Vegas-style ?super casinos? that could be built in Britain, but said some concessions could be offered if the bill ran into trouble.

 ?If it is absolutely clear that what parliamentarians want to see is a more gradual approach then of course we will consider that,? she told BBC Television.

 ?I will take very seriously constructive proposals for improving this bill that arise during the course of its parliamentary scrutiny.?

 International casino operators have already earmarked around ?5 billion ($9.15 billion) to invest in Britain if the Gambling Bill is approved by parliament. 

 Rules capping the size of casinos and restricting them to city centres will be loosened and membership laws will be scrapped if the bill becomes law. Blair said last week no more than 20 to 40 mega-casinos would be built.

 Industry analysts say more than 100 could be applied for.

 ?Not one single permission for one of these large casinos has yet been granted,? Jowell said, adding that they would only be accepted if local people actively wanted them.

 Local authorities would also be able to insist on other services to be offered alongside, such as cinemas or sport centres. ?Local people will decide whether or not they want this,? Jowell said.

 The opposition Conservative party says the proposals are unduly skewed in favour of the biggest operators, mainly American companies eager to come to Britain.

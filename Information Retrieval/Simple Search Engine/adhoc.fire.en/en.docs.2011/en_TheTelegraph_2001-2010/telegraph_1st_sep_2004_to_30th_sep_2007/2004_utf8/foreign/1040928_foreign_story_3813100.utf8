 Ancient Indian coin to be sold

 London, Sept. 27 (Reuters): An Indian gold coin which is nearly 1,900-years-old and shows one of the earliest depictions of Buddha is to be sold at auction where it is expected to fetch up to ?15,000 pounds ($27,000).

 The coin, about the size of a finger nail, shows Buddha on one side and Kanishka I on the other and dates from Kanishka?s rule in the first quarter of the second century. It is one of only four such coins. ?Kanishka ... ruled over a multi-ethnic society in northern India and central Asia and embraced Buddhism,? said Tom Eden of specialist coin auctioneers Morton amp; Eden Ltd, who will conduct the sale in November.

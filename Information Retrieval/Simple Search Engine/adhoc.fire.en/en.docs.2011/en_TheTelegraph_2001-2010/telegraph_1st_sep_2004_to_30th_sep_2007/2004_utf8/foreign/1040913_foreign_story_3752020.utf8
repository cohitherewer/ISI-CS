 Fine Print

 Marcos musical

 Manila, Sept. 12 (AFP): Already the subject of an award-winning documentary, the life of the Philippines former First Lady Imelda Marcos is now to be turned into a musical, according to a report today.

 The Los Angeles production will be staged by the Asian-American theater troupe, East West players, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said.

 The musical, set to open next May, will cover Imelda Marcos? rise to fame as a beauty queen, her marriage to Ferdinand Marcos, and the ?people power? revolution which ended his dictatorship in 1986 and chased the couple into exile in Hawaii.

 It will have ?the tone of Evita, with more light and funny parts. It will be reality-based, but theatre can bring a magical and surreal touch that film or TV could not present,? said Tim Dang, East West?s artistic director.

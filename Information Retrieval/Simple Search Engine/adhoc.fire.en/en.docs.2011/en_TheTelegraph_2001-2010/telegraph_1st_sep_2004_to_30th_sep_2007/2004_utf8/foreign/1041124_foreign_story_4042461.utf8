 Got cough? Try some chocolate

 London, Nov. 23 (Reuters): An ingredient in chocolate could be used to stop persistent coughs and lead to more effective medicines, researchers said yesterday.

 The study found that theobromine, found in cocoa, was nearly a third more effective in stopping persistent coughs than codeine. The researchers, from Imperial College London, said the discovery could lead to more effective cough treatments.

 ?While persistent coughing is not necessarily harmful it can have a major impact on quality of life, and this discovery could be a huge step forward in treating this problem,? said Prof. Peter Barnes of ICL. Ten healthy volunteers were either given theobromine, codeine or a dummy pill during the trial.

 To measure the effect of the different pill the researchers measured levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to cause coughing. The team found when the volunteers were given theobromine, the concentration of capsaicin needed to produce a cough was around a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine they needed only marginally higher levels of capsaicin to cause a cough compared with the placebo.

 Washington, Sept. 16 (Reuters): President George W. Bush yesterday urged Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to ?uphold the principles of democracy? in a carefully worded message expressing concern about Putin?s proposed political reforms.

 Bush offered his first comment on Putin?s proposal to do away with elections by popular vote for governors in Russias 89 regions. Candidates would instead be selected by the President and approved by regional assemblies.

 Bush counts Putin as a strong ally in the war on terrorism, has invited him both to his Camp David retreat and his Texas ranch.

 ?As governments fight the enemies of democracy, they must uphold the principles of democracy,? Bush said in a speech. Bush said he had recently spoken to Putin to express his condolences about the Beslan deaths. ?I?m also concerned about the decisions that are being made in Russia that could undermine democracy in Russia, that great countries, great democracies have a balance of power between central governments and local governments,? he said.

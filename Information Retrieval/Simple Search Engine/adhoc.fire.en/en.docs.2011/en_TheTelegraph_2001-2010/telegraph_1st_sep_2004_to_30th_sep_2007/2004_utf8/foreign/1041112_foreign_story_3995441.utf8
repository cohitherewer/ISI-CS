 Tobacco titan hid puff problems: Study

 London, Nov. 11 (Reuters): Philip Morris, one of the world?s leading tobacco manufacturers, was involved in research into the health effects of smoking 30 years ago but did not reveal data on the dangers of passive smoking, scientists said today.

 Although the tobacco industry claimed for many years that it was not aware of the toxic effects of cigarettes, the researchers said material from internal industry documents revealed Philip Morris used a German research facility to study the health impact of smoking from the early 1970s.

 ?Arrangements were made to conceal the process, not only from the wider public, but also from many within Philip Morris, although some senior executives did know,? said Martin McKee, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in London, in research published online by The Lancet medical journal.

 But New York-based Altria Group Inc, the parent company of Philip Morris, said the allegations in the journal were not new and had been made in many of the product-liability lawsuits filed against Philip Morris.

 ?We have successfully defended against them,? said John Wunderli, a lawyer for Altria.

 McKee said that although the company has argued for a long time that the evidence on the harmful effect of passive smoking is debatable, they had been undertaking research that showed second-hand smoke is dangerous. 

 The scientists at the German facility only reported some of their findings, he added.

 ?In particular, the unpublished reports provided evidence that second-hand smoke is even more harmful than mainstream smoke, a finding of particular relevance given the industry?s continuing denial of the harmful effects of passive smoking,? McKee and Swiss colleagues said in the journal.

 Health experts and anti-smoking groups have urged Britain to follow the example of Ireland which has banned smoking in enclosed public work places.

 The researchers said the company should explain its involvement in the German research facility and what it knows about passive smoking.

 ?Given the continuing debate about the way governments should respond to calls for a ban on smoking in public places, we have published this work early online to inform that discussion as a matter of urgency,? Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, said in an editorial.

 ?The research conducted in that facility appears to have been selectively reported in order to favourably shape public impressions about the safety of passive smoking.?

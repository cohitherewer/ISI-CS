 Jiang future on agenda as meet opens

 Beijing, Sept. 16 (Reuters): China?s Communist Party opened a four-day, closed-door meeting today that will decide whether military chief Jiang Zemin completes a leadership succession by passing on his last post to party chief Hu Jintao.

 Behind-the-scenes rivalry between Hu, 61, who succeeded Jiang as party chief in 2002 and president in 2003, and his ageing but still influential predecessor and their allies has emerged subtly into the open in recent weeks.

 But analysts said the rivalry was unlikely to blow up into a full power struggle because both see stability as indispensable to sustainable growth in the world?s seventh-biggest economy.

 Jiang, 78, had offered to resign as chairman of the Central Military Commission in the run-up to the plenum of the elite Central Committee, said a source with close ties to military leadership circles and a government insider, both of whom requested anonymity. They echoed a recent story in the New York Times.

 ?Jiang?s offer to step down needs the approval of the Central Committee,? the source with military ties said. The Central Committee has 198 members. It was unclear if Jiang?s offer to resign was a genuine move to go or a gambit to cling to the chairmanship. Several sources and analysts said that ? barring last-minute jockeying ? Jiang would not give up the top job in the military.

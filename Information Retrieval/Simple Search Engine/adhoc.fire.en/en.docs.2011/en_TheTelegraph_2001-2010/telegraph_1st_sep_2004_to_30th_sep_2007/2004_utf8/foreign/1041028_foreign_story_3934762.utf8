 Taipei food fight

 Taipei, Oct. 27 (Reuters): A food fight erupted in Taiwan?s parliament yesterday as lawmakers quarrelling over a massive arms budget hurled their lunch boxes at each other.

 ?You?ve got no shame!? screamed Chu Fong-chih of the Opposition Nationalist Party, after throwing a take-out box of chicken and rice at Chen Tsung-yi, a legislator from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party who backed the special budget. Chen responded by accusing Chu of sympathising with Taiwan?s arch-foe China, and flung his own lunch box at her.

 Taiwan?s parliament is notorious for fistfights, with many lawmakers enjoying the media attention when scuffles break out. Chairs and shoes have also been known to fly across the chamber on occasion.

 FT loses its Spirit

 Sydney (Reuters): A corporate sailing day on sparkling Sydney 

Harbour went awry on Tuesday when a yacht promoting the new Australian edition 

of the venerable Financial Times newspaper struck rocks and capsized. The 

maritime mishap could hardly have happened in a more public place with the 24-metre 

yacht FT Spirit lying on its side off Sydneys Opera House, smack 

in the middle of one of the world?s most famous waterways. The yacht, known as 

Spirit of Australia when it sailed in the 1992 America?s Cup, apparently 

sailed too close to the Opera House and struck rocks, tearing off the heavy lead 

keel bulb which keeps the boat upright.

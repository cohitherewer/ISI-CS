 ?Catwoman? gets on Jim Belushi nerves

 Los Angeles, Nov. 9 (Reuters): Actor Jim Belushi says his next-door neighbour, actress Julie Newmar, is spying on him, destroying his property and calling him names behind his back.

 So he has filed a $1 million harassment suit against the actress famed for playing the villainess Catwoman in the 1960s Batman TV series, saying he will not let her drive him out of the neighbourhood. 

 Newmar?s agent, Fred Wostbrock, declined to discuss the allegations except to say: ?You?ve got to be kidding. The only person Catwoman would hassle is Batman ? (actor) Adam West.?

 Belushi says that Newmar, 71, destroyed a fence and landscaping on his property, spied on the actor and his family and directed loud music into his backyard.

 The star of the ABC sitcom According to Jim also accuses Newmar of spreading defamatory statements about him by calling him a ?Peeping Tom,? a ?voyeur? and ?sick.?

 The suit, filed last week in Los Angeles county superior court and made public yesterday, describes Newmar?s behaviour as ?an effort to force Belushi to move from his home.?

 It says her conduct has grown ?more alarming and her harassment and apparent obsession have become more intrusive? over time. 

 The lawsuit makes no mention of why Newmar would direct such conduct at Belushi.

 President one of us, say French

 HENRY SAMUEL

 Paris, Oct. 30: Knocking John Kerry?s Gallic roots could be a thing of the past for George W. Bush?s camp after a claim that the President, too, is descended from the people his supporters call ?cheese-eating surrender monkeys?.

 French historians believe that Bush is a corruption of the name Boucher (butcher).

 The apparent connection was uncovered by a Le Figaro reporter in a book on French America, Histoire de ?Amerique Fran?aise.

 The paper suggested that was why the President?s official biographers never traced the family tree beyond 1850.

 ?Perhaps that is the moment when the Boucher of the old world became the Bush of the new?? Le Figaro said. Americanising French surnames was commonplace in the early 1800s. Desrochers, became Stone and Auclair became ?Clair. Yesterday Le Figaro revelled in its discovery, suggesting that it could tip the election in Kerry?s favour.

 ?With a name like Boucher, Bush may even lose the vegetarian vote,? it said. Such is the climate of American francophobia after France?s opposition to the Iraq invasion that any mention of the F-word could be damaging.

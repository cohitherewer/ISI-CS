 Rebel prize on Putin head

 Moscow, Sept. 9 (Reuters): 

 Chechen rebels, in a swift reply to a Russian bounty offer 

 for their leaders, promised today to give $20 million to 

 anyone helping them to capture President Vladimir Putin.

 Yesterday, the government offered $10 million for information that would help track down the two main Chechen leaders. ?We offer an award of $20 million to countries or individuals who give the Chechen republic help in detaining war criminal Vladimir Putin,? said a statement on rebel websites.

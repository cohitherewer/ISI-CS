 Blair puts re-election bid focus on crime, terror

 London, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Britain?s Tony Blair put tackling crime and terrorism at the heart of his re-election bid today, drawing accusations of scaremongering like those levelled at his ally US President George W. Bush.

 Outlining legislative plans for the next parliamentary session, expected to be curtailed by a vote in May, the prime minister unveiled measures to keep Britain?s streets safer and protect the country from terror attacks.

 The focus on security, in what effectively was Blair?s draft election manifesto, is a bid to beef up his Labour?s Party?s credentials on issues of prime concern to Britons where the main Opposition Conservative Party has traditionally done well.

 ?My government recognises that we live in a time of global uncertainty with an increased threat from international terrorism and organised crime,? said Queen Elizabeth as she read Blair?s proposals to parliament.

 ?Measures to extend opportunity will be accompanied by legislation to increase security for all,? she said. While polls put Blair well on track to win a third term, surveys also show that Britons have yet to feel the benefits of a string of government anti-crime measures.

 ?This is an area of vulnerability (for Labour) and Blair wants to take pre-emptive action to outflank the Conservatives,? said Wyn Grant, a politics professor at Warwick University.

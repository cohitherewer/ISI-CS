 Pak raids wanted militant?s hideout

 Wana (Pakistan), Oct. 20 (Reuters): Pakistani helicopter gunships today attacked a suspected hideout of Abdullah Mehsud, a former Guantanamo Bay inmate who masterminded the kidnapping of two Chinese engineers this month, witnesses said.

 ?Helicopter gunships are pounding the mountains near Spinkay Raghzai,? a resident of the area, where locals say Abdullah is thought to be hiding, said by telephone.

 Lieutenant-General Safdar Hussain, the Pakistani military commander in the South Waziristan tribal zone, said the area under attack since last night was Abdullah?s political and military base. ?The operation is still going on and there is very stiff resistance, but we are very confident we will overcome this.?

 Pakistan has vowed to hunt down Abdullah, who masterminded the abduction of the engineers working on a dam in South Waziristan on October 9, testing ties with Beijing, one of Islamabad?s closest allies.

 One of the hostages and all of the kidnappers, whom Abdullah had directed from a secret location, were killed after army commandos launched a rescue operation last week.

 Cold War?s last US statesman dead

 Paul Nitze

 Washington, Oct. 21 (Reuters): Paul Nitze, one of the last leading US statesmen of the Cold War period and architect of nuclear deterrence, has died at the age of 97.

 The School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, founded by Nitze in 1943 and later named after him, said on its website the former diplomat and presidential adviser died at home on Tuesday night.

 A wealthy, scholarly member of America?s Eastern Establishment who served Republican and Democratic administrations, Nitze held numerous government posts over four decades during which he saw the start of the Cold War and oversaw US post-war rearmament.

 During a period of bitter battles over arms control policy, Nitze was the target and the ally of hawks and doves alike.

 But both sides agreed the silver-haired patrician knew more about national security issues and dealing with Moscow than any other American. A Navy destroyer has been named after him. In a speech last week at SAIS, as the Johns Hopkins school is known, secretary of state Colin Powell called Nitze ?an icon to those of us who are in the state department.?

 ?It was like having Moses at the table. This man who had 50 years under his belt when I was just trying to figure out how to be National Security Adviser,? Powell said of his tenure in the Reagan administration.

 Former deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott, who wrote a book on Nitze entitled The Master of the Game, called him a ?really major figure both of the Cold War era and of the transition to the post-Cold War era.?

 ?He was a man at the centre of things ? both when he was in government and outside government ? on the toughest issues of nuclear war and peace. He was a hard-headed analyst and a ferocious negotiator and solution-maker (as well as) a ferocious opponent of policies he disagreed with,? said Talbott.

 When only 43-years-old, Nitze became principal author of a highly influential secret National Security Council document, which provided the strategic outline for increased US expenditures to counter the perceived Soviet threat.

 Deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz, who once headed SAIS, told a recent conference the document was a ?landmark contribution to national security? and Nitze?s ?foresight produced a plan for the post-war world characterised by creativity?.

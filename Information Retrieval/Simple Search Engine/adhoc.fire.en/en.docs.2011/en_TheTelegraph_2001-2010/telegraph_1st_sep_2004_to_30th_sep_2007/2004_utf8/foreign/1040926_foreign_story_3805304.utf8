 French intellectual icon dead

 Francoise Sagan

 Paris, Sept. 25 (Reuters): French author Francoise Sagan, who shot to fame with her first novel Bonjour Tristesse at the age of 18 and courted controversy throughout her life, died yesterday, a hospital spokesman said. 

 Sagan, who was 69, was an icon of 1950s intellectuals and lived the Bohemian lifestyle she portrayed in her writing. She was a longstanding friend of late President Francois Mitterrand and was convicted of taking drugs and for tax evasion. ?Francoise Sagan died today,? said Yves Buzen, spokesman for the hospital in Honfleur, in Normandy, where she died. 

 Born Francoise Quoirez into a wealthy family in 1935, she wrote under the name of a character created by Marcel Proust and burst onto the literary scene with Bonjour Tristesse (Hello Sadness).

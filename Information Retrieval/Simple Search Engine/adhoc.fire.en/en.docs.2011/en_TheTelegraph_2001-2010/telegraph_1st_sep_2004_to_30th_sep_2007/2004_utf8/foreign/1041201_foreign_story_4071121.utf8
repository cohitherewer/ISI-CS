 Annan ?hurt? by son

 Kofi Annan

 United Nations, Nov. 30 (Reuters): UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said yesterday he was ?disappointed? his son did not tell him the full story of his ties to a firm involved in the UN oil-for-food programme, now under investigation.

 Annan?s son, Kojo, received payments from the Geneva-based Cotecna firm until last February after the UN said he severed ties with the company in February 1999. Part of the payments involved an agreement not to compete with Cotecna in west Africa after he left the firm.

 ?Naturally I was very disappointed and surprised,? Annan said, saying the discrepancy had not been brought to his attention.

 Cotecna had been hired by the UN from December 1998 until 2003 to check civilian supplies reaching Iraq under the UN-administered oil-for-food programme, which is being probed for abuses by Saddam Hussein?s government. There is no evidence Kojo Annan, based in Nigeria, worked on the Iraq project for Cotecna, which was also hired by the US-led occupation in Iraq until mid-2004.

 Answering questions, Annan said: ?Naturally I have warm, family relations with my son, but he is in a different field. He is an independent businessman. He is a grown man and I don?t get involved with his activities and he doesn?t get involved in mine.?

 UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said the secretary-general had no role in the distribution of contracts, and those who signed the deal maintained they did not know in 1998 that Kojo Annan, then a trainee, worked for Cotecna.

 ?As I have said earlier, I have no involvement with granting of contracts,? Annan said.

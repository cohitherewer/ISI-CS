 Europe gets nod to slap trade ban on US

 Geneva, Aug. 31 (Reuters): The EU and its allies got the go-ahead today to slap some $150 million in sanctions on US goods in a row that could stir trade tensions ahead of the U.S. elections.

 World Trade Organisation (WTO) arbitrators backed the EU and seven other WTO members demand to punish US failure to revoke an anti-dumping law the so-called Byrd amendment repeatedly declared illegal by the Geneva-based body.

 EU trade commissioner Pascal Lamy in Brussels urged Washington to repeal the controversial law. I hope the US will now take action to remove this measure, thus avoiding the risk of sanctions, he said.

 In Washington, a spokesman for US trade representative Robert Zoellick repeated a long-standing pledge to work closely with Congress in order to comply with WTO rules. The US government has urged Congress to drop the measure, which passes on anti-dumping levies to US firms, but the law enjoys strong backing amongst legislators who see it as helping struggling industries.

 The US remains committed to resolving this issue in a way that promotes the competitiveness of American workers, said spokesman Christopher Padilla. The arbitrators, in a ruling running to more than 60 pages, set no amount for retaliation.

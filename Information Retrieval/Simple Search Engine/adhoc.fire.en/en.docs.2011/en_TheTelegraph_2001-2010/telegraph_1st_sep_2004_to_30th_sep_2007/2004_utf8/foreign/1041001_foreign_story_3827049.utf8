 Weary Pope meets Pervez

 Vatican City, Sept. 30 (Reuters): A tired looking Pope John Paul had difficulty reading his addresses today, including one in which he told Pakistan?s President that only dialogue and tolerance could lead to world justice.

 The 84-year-old Pope, who suffers from Parkinson?s disease, received Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Romanian President Ion Iliescu in separate private audiences in the Vatican. At the first, with Iliescu, the Pope began the brief address in Italian and, when he had difficulty pronouncing his words, his secretary gave it to an aide, who read it out to the delegation. Later, in the audience with Musharraf, the Vatican handed out the text of a two-paragraph English address which the Pope was to have read in the public part of the visit but did not. The Vatican said the Pope had read it to Musharraf during the private portion of the visit, which lasted 10 minutes.

 ?In these times of turmoil and violence, I encourage you and your fellow citizens to continue to foster a spirit of dialogue and tolerance in your region,? the 84-year-old Pope said in the printed remarks given to journalists.

 ?It is only by acknowledging the need for mutual understanding among peoples, through a frank and open exchange of ideas, that the world can obtain authentic justice and peace,? he said. In both audiences, however, the Pope gesticulated easily with this guests, exchanged gifts, and greeted each member of the delegations as photographers took individual and group pictures.

 In recent years the Pope?s ability to speak clearly has fluctuated. He goes through periods when his speech is incomprehensible, followed by periods when it is relatively clear and easy to understand. Vatican aides did not seem at all alarmed by the Popes condition today. Journalists had seen him in similar condition before. The Pope, restricted to a special chair by severe arthritis and a leg ailment, held his regular general audience for tens of thousands of people in St Peter?s Square yesterday.

 Musharraf?s audience with the Pope came at the end of a three-day visit to the Vatican, during which he called on fellow Islamic nations to reject extremism.

 Musharraf, who later discussed the world situation with Vatican secretary of state Cardinal Angelo Sodano, said during his visit to Italy that the war on terror would only be won if the entire Islamic shunned fanaticism and if the West resolved its political disputes with Muslim nations.

 A suspected Arab member of the al Qaida was arrested by Pakistani security forces today after breaking his legs trying to escape a raid on his house near Peshawar. Intelligence officials identified the suspect as Ahmed Abdullah, a Libyan national, but said he was not regarded as a major catch.

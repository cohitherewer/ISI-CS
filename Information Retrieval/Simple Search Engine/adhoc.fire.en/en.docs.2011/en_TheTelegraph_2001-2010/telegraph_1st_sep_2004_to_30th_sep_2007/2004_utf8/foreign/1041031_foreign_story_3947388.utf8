 12 Maoists killed in clashes

 Kathmandu, Oct. 30 (Reuters): At least 12 Maoist rebels were killed in gunbattles with Nepali troops that erupted after a truce for a major Hindu festival ended this week, officials said today.

 They said the guerrillas, seeking to topple the impoverished Himalayan nation?s constitutional monarchy, fired on security patrols at several places in east and west Nepal, forcing soldiers to retaliate.

 Ten suspected rebels died in clashes today in Siraha in eastern Nepal and Taplejung, near the border with India, while two more were killed last night, an officer said.

 But he did not have any further details, saying the clashes took place in the remote interior of Nepal. The rebels have made no comment. The rebels had declared a nine-day truce for Nepalis to celebrate the festival of Dasain. The government also suspended operations against the guerrillas.

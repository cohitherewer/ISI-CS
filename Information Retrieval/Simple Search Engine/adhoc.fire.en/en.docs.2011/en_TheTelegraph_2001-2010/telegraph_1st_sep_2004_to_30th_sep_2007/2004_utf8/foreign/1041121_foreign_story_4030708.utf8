 Plan to write off Iraq debt

 Berlin, Nov. 20 (Reuters): The US, Germany and other G7 nations agreed today to write off up to 80 per cent or $33 billion of Iraq?s Paris Club debt, which could pave the way for a wider international accord, officials said.

 A source at the 19-nation Paris Club of creditors said the deal was likely to be finalised tomorrow, adding: ?There is an agreement between the main creditors on (cancelling) 80 percent of the debt.?

 The breakthrough came in talks between German finance minister Hans Eichel and US treasury secretary John Snow on the margins of a meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the G20 group of rich and developing nations.

 A final Paris Club deal would end a dispute between the US, Germany and France over how much of Iraq?s debts they should waive and could serve as a benchmark for relief deals with other creditors such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and eastern European states.

Baghdad attack

 Guerrillas attacked Iraqi and US forces in Baghdad in daylight today, hours after a top US general conceded it was too early to say if a big Falluja offensive had broken the backbone of the insurgency.

 A dawn assault with rocket-propelled grenades on a police station in the Aadhamiya district killed at least three officers ? a day after Iraq?s National Guard raided a mosque revered by the Sunni minority.

 A Polish woman freed by kidnappers in Iraq and flown to Warsaw said she was treated well, raising hopes for other foreign hostages.

 Eindhoven Muslim school hit

 Eindhoven (Netherlands), Nov. 8 (Reuters): A bomb damaged an Islamic primary school in the southern Dutch town of Eindhoven today, the latest in a series of attacks on Muslim buildings since last week?s murder of a filmmaker critical of Islam.

 Police said they were investigating the cause of the blast in the early hours today, which followed a chain of attacks against Dutch mosques since film director Theo van Gogh was killed last Tuesday by a suspected Islamist militant.

 Eindhoven mayor Alexander Sakkers said nobody was hurt in the blast, which damaged the school?s entrance and shattered windows in the building and in nearby houses. A local man said the blast was deafening: ?It certainly woke us all up,? he said.

 ?Residents of the area are really shocked and many have to contend with damage,? Sakkers said in a statement. ?We have to do everything possible to keep the community united.?

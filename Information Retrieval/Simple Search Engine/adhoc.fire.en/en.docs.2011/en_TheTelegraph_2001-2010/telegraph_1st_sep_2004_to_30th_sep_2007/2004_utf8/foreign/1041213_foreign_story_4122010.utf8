 PLO invasion apology to Kuwait

 Kuwait, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Mahmoud Abbas, on the first visit by a top PLO official to Kuwait in 14 years, apologised to the Gulf state for the Palestine Liberation Organisation?s failure to condemn Iraq?s 1990 invasion of its small neighbour.

 ?I say yes, we apologise to the Kuwait people over our stand towards Kuwait,? Abbas said at the airport when asked how he intended to respond to demands for an apology.

 The move is expected to end a rift between the oil-rich Gulf Arab state and the PLO following the death of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, hated in Kuwait for refusing to condemn the Iraqi invasion.

 Abbas, accompanied by Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei, was met at the airport by Kuwaiti information minister Mohammad Abulhasan, who is also acting foreign minister. 

 Abbas and Qurei are the highest ranking Palestinian officials to visit Kuwait since 1990. 

 Before leaving Amman, Abbas had declared that the legacy of the past was over and a new page was turning in Palestinian-Kuwaiti ties cut by the 1990-91 Gulf War and said he planned to ask Kuwait for financial aid.

 Oil-rich Kuwait was one of the main financial backers of the Palestinians before ties were severed.

 Abbas? remarks echoed a similar sentiment yesterday by Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah-al-Ahmad al-Sabah who welcomed the visit by ?our brother Abu Mazen (Abbas)?. 

 ?To Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad, we have all love and appreciation,? Abbas said upon his arrival at the airport.

 Kuwait kicked out some 400,000 Palestinians after US-led forces drove Iraqi troops out of the emirate in 1991. Only a few thousand Palestinians stayed behind or have returned since.

 Kuwait last year put off a planned visit by Abbas, then the number two PLO official after Arafat. 

 The Kuwaiti Premier said Abbas was ready to offer more than an apology. 

 Asked if he intended to demand an apology from Abbas, the Kuwait Premier told the official KUNA news agency:?I hope we are not young children to keep repeating the word ?apology?... Still, apologising is easy and brother Abu Mazen is not against apologising; on the contrary, he will say more than an apology.?

Israel blast

 Four Israeli soldiers were killed and eight wounded when Palestinian militants blew up explosives in a tunnel near an Israeli army post on the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip on Sunday, Al Jazeera TV said.

 The blast was followed by another huge explosion along the border area, barely an hour afterwards.

 Iran defies UN, starts uranium tests

 Vienna, Sept. 21 (Reuters): Iran defied the UN today by announcing it would go on converting a large amount of raw uranium to prepare it for enrichment, a process that can be used to develop atomic bombs.

 The announcement was likely to provoke an angry reaction from Washington and increase suspicion in Israel, which plans to buy 500 ?bunker buster? bombs from the US that could take out Iran?s underground atomic facilities.

 Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the head of Iran?s Atomic Energy Organisation, told reporters Iran had begun converting 37 tonnes of raw ?yellowcake? uranium to process it for use in nuclear centrifuges ? the machines that enrich uranium.

 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN?s nuclear watchdog, unanimously adopted a resolution on Saturday calling on Iran to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment. The US, Russia and the EU reinforced the message yesterday by urging Tehran to comply.

 ?Some of the amount of the 37 tonnes has been used. The tests have been successful but these tests have to be continued using the rest of the material,? said Aghazadeh, one of Iran?s vice-presidents, who is attending a general conference of the Vienna-based IAEA.

 One nuclear expert has said that once converted from yellowcake into uranium hexafluoride, the feed material for enrichment centrifuges, Iran would eventually be able to enrich enough uranium for up to five nuclear weapons.

 Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said Iran was determined to press ahead with its atomic programme even if it brought an end to UN checks of the Islamic Republics nuclear sites.

 ?We are determined to obtain peaceful atomic technology even if it causes the stop of international supervision,? Khatami said. ?We have never wanted nuclear weapons. We want peaceful technology.?

 Iran had told the IAEA this summer that it intended to run what it described as tests of its uranium conversion facility. However, today?s announcement came after the IAEA board of governors passed the resolution on Saturday calling on Iran to halt all activities linked to uranium enrichment. Iran had promised France, Britain and Germany last October it would freeze all activities related to uranium enrichment in exchange for improved economic ties. But Tehran angered the EU?s ?big three? by announcing earlier this year that the production of feed material for centrifuges would not be included in the freeze.

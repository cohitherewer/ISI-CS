 ?We held hands and crouched?

 Phuket (Thailand), Dec. 27 

 (Reuters): William Robins vowed today to change his life 

 forever after the professional golfer from California and 

 his new bride, Amanda, narrowly escaped death in the grip 

 of a tsunami.

 The newly-weds were honeymooning on Phi Phi island ? made famous by the film The Beach starring Leonardo DiCaprio ? when a giant tsunami wave slammed into it yesterday. ?I honestly thought this is the worst way to die. I thought I?m not meant to die like this,? Robins, 26, said as he lay in a hospital bed in Phuket, his collar bone broken and most of his right ear torn off. Robins and Amanda, who lay next to him with a fractured pelvis, were among hundreds of tourists stranded on Phi Phi after the massive wave washed onto the island. 

 The couple were strolling near the beach yesterday when they heard people screaming and saw tourists jumping off boats. ?We thought it was a terrorist bomb, so we jumped over a hotel fence and hid in a storage room,? Robins said.

 ?We held hands and crouched in the corner. Then we heard a rumbling explosion that didn?t end.? Moments later, their hiding place collapsed around them, Amanda said.

 ?We were pushed through two layers of concrete and forced to let go of each other?s hands,? said the 27-year-old teacher. They were pulled underwater and swept 150 metres out to sea. ?There were broken pieces of wood and bits of metal everywhere. It smelled of fuel,? Robins said. Suddenly, they saw a hotel employee in a boat searching for lost family members. ?We were screaming. We said if we don?t get on this boat, we?re dead,? Robins said.

 The man tossed them a line and pulled them into the boat. By nightfall, they were in hospital on Phuket. ?We both came within 0.1 seconds of not seeing each other. There are going to be changes in our life from now on. We?re going to take a lot of the bullshit out,? Robins said. More than 22,000 people are now believed to have died yesterday after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake off Indonesia?s Sumatra island sparked tsunami waves that crashed into shorelines around the Bay of Bengal. 

 King?s grandson killed

 The 21-year-old grandson of Thailand?s King Bhumibol Adulyadej was among those killed by a tsunami that struck southern Thailand, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said today. Bhumi Jensen was last seen jet-skiing off Krabi when the deadly wave battered the popular resort area. His body was found later by rescue workers near Khao Lak beach.

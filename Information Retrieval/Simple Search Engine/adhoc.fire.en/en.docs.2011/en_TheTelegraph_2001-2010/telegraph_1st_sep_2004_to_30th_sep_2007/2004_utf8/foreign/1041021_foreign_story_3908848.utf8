 Thai tiger cull

 Bangkok, Oct. 20 (Reuters): Thailand ordered a cull of 40 tigers suspected of suffering from bird flu today after seven more of the big cats died, bringing the tiger death toll at an infected zoo to 30.

 ?We need to cull 40 sick tigers with a potassium chloride injection,? Thawat Suntrajarn, head of the health ministry?s department of disease control, said. ?Otherwise they will become a reservoir for the disease.? ?They all died after three days of showing symptoms so there is no need to keep them,? he said, referring to the first 23 tigers to die of flu-like symptoms after eating raw chicken at the Sri Racha Tiger Zoo.

 Ticket for dead

 London, Oct. 29 (Reuters): A British train conductor stamped and carefully returned the ticket of a slumbering passenger without realising the man was dead.

 Shortly afterwards the train pulled into York station in northern England and rail staff alerted paramedics when they realised the man was not breathing.

 ?The conductor needn?t have been so careful, as it turned out that the passenger had expired, long before his ticket ever did,? said a report in the British transport police?s staff magazine.

 Romp right

 Zagreb (Reuters): A top Croatian pop 

 star asked a Zagreb court on Friday to watch a private movie 

 in which she enjoys a lusty sex romp to see whether her 

 copyright was violated by a website that showed it to the 

 public. Severina Vuckovic, 32, sued the www.index.hr 

 web portal for publishing shots of her having sex with a 

 man later identified as a wealthy Bosnian Croat businessman 

 who is married with children. Her lawyers demanded the video 

 be shown in court, state news agency Hina reported. In a 

 separate motion, the defendants also asked that a court-appointed 

 sex expert see the video to determine if Vuckovic had ?demonstrated 

 anything not previously seen in the porn industry?, which 

 could qualify for copyright, Hina said.

 Clinton to have bypass surgery after chest pains

 Bill Clinton

 New York, Sept. 3 (Reuters): Former President Bill Clinton was being admitted to a New York hospital today for heart bypass surgery, according to a statement from his office.

 Former President Bill Clinton is being admitted into New York Presbyterian Hospital today and is scheduled to have bypass surgery, the statement said.

 ABC and CBS television reported that Clinton, 58, had checked into the hospital for quadruple heart bypass surgery. A Democratic Party official said Clinton, who served two terms as President from 1993 to 2001, had gone to the hospital complaining of chest pains.

 The severity of Clintons coronary problem was discovered after tests at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, New York, ABC News reported. His coronary results were not favourable and he was found to have multiple lesions, it said. CBS News said doctors found a blockage.

 CNN quoted a source close to the former President as saying the surgery could take place as early as tomorrow.

 Clinton, the 42nd US President, promised at the Democratic National Convention in July to be a foot soldier in John Kerrys race against Republican President George W. Bush. The former President received a rousing welcome from delegates after being introduced by his wife, New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.

 Clinton, who had a reputation for having a big appetite and for fighting a weight problem, showed no signs of heart problems during rigorous health examinations that were made public during his Presidency.

 Clinton has been active giving speeches and completing and promoting his best-selling memoir since leaving office in 2001. His charisma and political clout were seen as a big potential asset to Kerry in the coming hectic weeks of the presidential election campaign.

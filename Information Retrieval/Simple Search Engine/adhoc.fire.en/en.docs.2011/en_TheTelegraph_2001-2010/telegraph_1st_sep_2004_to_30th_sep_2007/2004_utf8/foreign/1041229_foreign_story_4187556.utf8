 Zardari gets passport, free to travel abroad

Islamabad, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Pakistani authorities 

issued a passport to the husband of Opposition-leader-in-exile Benazir Bhutto 

today and also removed his name from a list of people barred from travelling abroad, 

his lawyer said.

 The move came a day before a court in the southern province of Sindh was scheduled to hear a petition from Asif Ali Zardari, who was freed on bail after eight years in jail last month, against the government?s refusal to issue him a passport.

 ?Today the government has issued a passport to him and his name is also removed from the exit-control list,? Zardari?s lawyer Farooq Naik said.

 The issuing of the passport will allow Zardari to see his wife for the first time in five years. Bhutto, a former Prime Minister, has lived in self-imposed exile for fear of arrest on corruption charges since 1999.

 Zardari was reunited with their three children when they came to Pakistan this week. He said he would go to Dubai to see his wife on New Year?s eve. ?I don?t know how much time I will spend abroad,? he told private television channel Geo.

 Bhutto has been dividing her time in exile between Dubai and Britain. Despite his release from jail, seen as an attempt by President Pervez Musharraf to patch up relations with Bhutto?s Opposition party, Zardari still faces several criminal charges.

 Some analysts see concessions to Zardari as an attempt by Musharraf to mute criticism of his decision to go back on a pledge to give up his dual role of army chief at the end of this month.

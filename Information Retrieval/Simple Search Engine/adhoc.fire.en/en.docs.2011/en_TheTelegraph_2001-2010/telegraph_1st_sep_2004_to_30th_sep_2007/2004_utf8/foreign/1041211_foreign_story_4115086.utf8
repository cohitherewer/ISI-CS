 Kiss of poison

 Washington, Dec. 10 (Reuters): 

 The wife of Ukrainian Opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko 

 said today she tasted poison on his lips when she kissed 

 him, and blamed the poisoning for disfiguring her husbands 

 face.

 ?I thought there was something different about my husband when he came home that night ? because he has never taken any medicine, he?s a very healthy man,? Kateryna Yushchenko said in an interview on ABC?s Good Morning America.

 ?And I tasted some medicine on his breath, on his lips. And I asked him about it, he brushed it away, saying there is nothing.?

 She said the next day her husband became ill and eventually was rushed to a hospital. ?We were told that if we had only waited a few hours, we might have lost him,? Kateryna Yushchenko said. She did not specify when the incident occurred.

 Viktor Yushchenko fell ill in September while on the presidential campaign trail and was flown to Austria for treatment. He later accused the authorities of trying to kill him with poison. Speaking from Kiev, the Chicago-born Kateryna Yushchenko said her husband?s facial disfigurement increased over a period of weeks. ?It started slowly because obviously poison hits different parts of your body at different times, but it?s been coming out more and more,? she said.

 ?But doctors assure us that when the poison goes away, his face will return to the way it looked before. My husband was known as a very handsome man and I know he?ll look the same.? 

 Asked about who might have poisoned her husband, she replied: ?My husband has said it?s basically the people in power, the people who don?t want the system to change.?

 Moscow-backed Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich was declared the winner in the Ukrainian contest?s November 21 run-off, sparking street protests in support of Yushchenko and accusations the government rigged the election against him.

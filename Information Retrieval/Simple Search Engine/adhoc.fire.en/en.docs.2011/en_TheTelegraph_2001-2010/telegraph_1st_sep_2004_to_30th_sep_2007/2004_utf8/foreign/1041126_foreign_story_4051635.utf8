 Bushes to dine on leftovers

 Crawford (Texas), Nov. 25 (Reuters): When President George W. Bush and his family sit down for their traditional Thanksgiving Day feast, they will be dining on leftovers, the White House said.

 Bush played host at his Crawford, Texas, ranch yesterday to the king and queen of Spain and treated them to a turkey-and-stuffing lunch. ?Tomorrow, the President and his family will enjoy the same meal,? a spokeswoman said. The meal includes turkey and mashed sweet potatoes.

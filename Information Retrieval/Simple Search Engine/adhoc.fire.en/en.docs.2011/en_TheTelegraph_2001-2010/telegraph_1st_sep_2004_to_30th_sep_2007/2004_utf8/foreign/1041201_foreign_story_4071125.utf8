 Passage of law boosts Pervez powers

 Islamabad, Nov. 30 (Reuters): Pakistan passed a law today that will allow President Pervez Musharraf to stay on as army chief despite his pledge that he would quit his military post by the end of the year.

 Musharraf was on an official visit to Latin America, and in his absence acting President Mohammadmian Soomro, who is chairman of the upper house of parliament or Senate, signed the bill that was passed last month into law. ?The President can now keep both offices,? information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said.

 Islamist and mainstream Opposition parties had opposed the law letting Musharraf, who came to power in a bloodless coup five years ago, be both President and army chief. They say it will hinder democracy in Pakistan.

 Musharraf has said he has not yet taken a final decision on whether to quit as army chief but experts say he can now legally justify keeping both positions. Under a deal with an alliance of Islamist parties last year, Musharraf pledged to take off his military uniform by the end of 2004 in return for support for constitutional changes validating his rule and giving him extensive power.

 Musharraf recently suggested he was no longer bound by that pledge, saying quitting the army could undermine his authority in the war on terror as well as his ability to push forward a nascent peace process with India. Opposition groups denounced the signing of the bill and said it dealt a serious blow to democracy in Pakistan, which has been ruled by the military for more than half of the 57 years it has been an independent state.

 ?It is the darkest day in the political history of Pakistan,? said Raza Rabbani, a senior leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by exiled former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. ?It is perhaps the last nail in the coffin of democracy in Pakistan.?

 The signing of the bill came just three days after the main Islamist Opposition kicked off a public campaign to try to force Musharraf to quit the powerful army position. The Alliance for Restoration of Democracy (ARD), a grouping made up of PPP and other secular parties, has planned a protest campaign and will hold its first rally in the northwestern city of Peshawar on December 5.

 Despite ideological differences, the two alliances are trying to find common ground for a joint struggle against Musharraf. But the release earlier this month of Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto?s husband, after eight years in jail, triggered speculation that Musharraf was reaching out to secular groups among the Opposition.

 While western countries have voiced concern over Musharraf?s democratic credentials, criticism has been muted because of his role in helping the US in the war on terror.

 Today, Washington?s new ambassador to Islamabad Ryan C. Crocker praised Pakistan?s hunt for al Qaida-linked militants in tribal lands near the Afghan border, and said it was up to Pakistanis to decide what posts Musharraf can hold. ?Our aim is to see democracy developed in a broader sense of the term,? Crocker said in Peshawar. ?On this specific issue (of quitting the army), this is something that Pakistani people are going to have to decide for themselves.?

 Hundreds of Pakistanis, deported from Oman for immigration violations, arrived home on two cargo ships today.

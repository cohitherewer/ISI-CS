 Kabul, Sept. 15 (Reuters): Three Americans have been sentenced to up to 10 years in jail after being found guilty by an Afghan court on charges including torture, running a private prison and illegal detention.

 Jonathan ?Jack? Idema, a former US Green Beret, was arrested in July along with another ex-serviceman, Brent Bennett, and documentary film-maker Edward Caraballo.

 They had denied the charges and insisted they were in Afghanistan with US and Afghan government sanction to help track down al Qaida and Taliban extremists.

 ?I apologise that we tried to save these people,? Idema told reporters immediately after the verdict.

 ?We should have let the Taliban murder every one of them,? he said bitterly.

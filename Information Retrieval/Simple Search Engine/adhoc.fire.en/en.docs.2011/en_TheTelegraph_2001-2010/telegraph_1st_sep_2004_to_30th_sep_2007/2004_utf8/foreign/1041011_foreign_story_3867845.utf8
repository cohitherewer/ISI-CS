 Cuddle up in the air

 London, Oct. 10 (PTI): Virgin Atlantic has become the first airline to introduce double-beds on board its planes, giving rise to claims that it is tacitly encouraging couples to cuddle up and get intimate.

 The move is the realisation of a dream of Virgin?s owner Richard Branson, who wanted to give passengers a chance to get ?closer together? on long trips, The Sunday Times reported.

 ?We have a lot of honeymoon couples who fly on Virgin, and a lot of couples who have been together for many years. There is no reason why they shouldn?t cuddle up on board like they would at home,? Branson said. 

 Weekend workout

 New York (Reuters): Cramming in the recommended 

 weekly amount of exercise into the weekend appears to offer 

 some health benefits for otherwise healthy men, new research 

 reports. Experts urge people to get at least 30 minutes 

 of moderate exercise most days of the week, or a smaller 

 amount of high-intensity exercise at least three times per 

 week, to burn a total of 1,000 or more extra calories per 

 week.

 Bully bash

 Singapore, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Singapore has a high-tech solution for an age-old problem: school bullying.

 The wealthy city-state has begun a mobile phone campaign to stop bullying in classrooms, urging tens of thousands of children to send the message: Be cool, be bully-free across their mobile networks in the hope that bullies will yield to peer pressure.

 This campaign gives the victim the opportunity to confront the issue by sending the text to the bully, said Alfred Tan, executive director of the Singapore Children Society.

 About 80 percent of Singaporeans own a mobile phone, one of the highest penetration rates in the world, with more than 50 million text messages sent each day.

 The campaign, due to begin on September 13, is one of many state-led social programmes in orderly Singapore that, among other things, have exhorted citizens in the past to smile more, speak better English, tidy up public toilets and to have more babies.

 Juggle jig

 Berlin (Reuters): A man who walked into 

 a shop and amused shoppers by juggling with lipsticks and 

 other expensive cosmetics from its counters faces charges 

 after being spotted pocketing them during his performance, 

 police said on Tuesday. The juggler had bagged more than 

 200 euros in cosmetics in the store in the western town 

 of Euskirchen when staff realised something was amiss and 

 rang the police. People watched the 18-year-old man gradually 

 put the items in his bag, a police spokesman said.

 Nun nab

 Berlin (Reuters): Two German nuns took the law into their own hands and recovered a picture of the Virgin Mary stolen from their Franciscan hospital, police said on Tuesday. The engraving vanished on Saturday and Sisters Georgia and Isabella decided not to leave the case just to the police. The two nuns took a car and scoured the local area on Sunday morning, police said. They got lucky and found the picture at a flea market. When the seller asked for 500 euros they said they would have to ring to get someone to bring the money. Instead they called the police, he said. The seller is being investigated.

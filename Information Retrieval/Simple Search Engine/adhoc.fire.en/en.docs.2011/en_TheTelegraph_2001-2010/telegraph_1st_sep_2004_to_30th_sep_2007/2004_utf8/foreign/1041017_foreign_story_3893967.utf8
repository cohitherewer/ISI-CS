 Zarqawi held reports untrue: US

 Zarqawi

Baghdad, Oct. 16 (Reuters): The US military 

said today reports that Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had been detained 

in Iraq were not credible.

 ?We have heard those reports and we do not believe they are true,? Lieutenant Colonel Steve Boylan, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, said. ?We have been in contact with the Marines based around Falluja and we have heard nothing about those reports through our channels,? he said. An Iraqi spokesman also denied the report.

 The official Kuwait News Agency earlier reported that Zarqawi was believed to be among 10 militants seized in raids in Falluja. ?There was a senior cleric who we seized earlier today and there may have been some confusion,? Lieutenant Colonel Eric Schnaiblem said.

 Homely husband

 Helsinki, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Need someone to change a light bulb or babysit? Rent-a-husband Petteri Ikonen says he is your man for all chores about the house.

 ?I don?t sell sex services at all,? stressed Ikonen, a warehouse worker who set up his solo husband rental business a year ago, noting that his clients were mainly ?lonely women? but included men and families.

 ?I?ve given driving lessons, I?ve sung a birthday serenade, all sorts of things,? said the 42-year-old who charges 20 euros ($24.60) for the first hour and 10 euros per hour thereafter. But he said his more usual tasks were changing lightbulbs or hanging pictures. The services offered by the formerly-married Ikonen are not unique, but he said Finnish men had more to offer than most. ?The guy who starts to do this has to be responsible and have a good sense of humour, have good manners, be good with his hands,? he said.

 Car crisis

 Tehran (Reuters): An Iranian who saw 

 a woman driving what he swore was his own car accused her 

 of stealing it, only to find two identical vehicles had 

 accidentally been issued with the same registration plate. 

 ?You are driving my car!? state television quoted him as 

 saying on Wednesday, after he saw the car while walking 

 down a street in the northeastern city Mashhad. When she 

 protested, he rang his family to find his car of the same 

 colour, model and registration still safely at home. The 

 carmaker said there had been a mix-up because of Iran?s 

 new system of issuing plates.

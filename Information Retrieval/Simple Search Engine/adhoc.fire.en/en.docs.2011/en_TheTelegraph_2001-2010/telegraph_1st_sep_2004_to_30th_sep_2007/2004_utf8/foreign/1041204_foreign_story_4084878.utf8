 Breather for Blunkett

 London, Dec. 3 (Reuters): British Home Secretary David Blunkett, accused of abusing his position to help a former lover, won a preliminary legal skirmish with her on Friday.

 Blunkett wants to settle access arrangements to the son US-born Kimberly Quinn bore two years ago during a three-year affair with the blind minister. The issue is a key part of the scandal surrounding Blunkett, who faces an inquiry into whether he intervened to fast-track a UK residence visa for Quinn?s Filipina nanny.

 With unofficial campaigning under way before a general election expected in May, the Blunkett saga is potentially damaging for Prime Minister Tony Blair, who promised ?purer than pure? government when he took power in 1997.

 On Friday, a High Court judge refused Quinn?s application to delay until April the hearing in which Blunkett seeks ?contact? and ?parental responsibility? orders in respect of the child.

 Judge Ernest Ryder said that despite claims the pregnant Quinn?s physical and mental health would be put at risk by a hearing, he was rejecting her bid.

 ?Delay would be damaging to the relationship between Mr Blunkett and the child,? he said.

 Blunkett?s lawyers had argued it was in the interest of the child to have his parentage decided at the earliest opportunity.

 Blunkett, who heads Blair?s anti-terrorism and crime policies, said in a statement afterwards: ?I?m naturally relieved at today?s judgment so I can continue my attempts to gain access to my son.?

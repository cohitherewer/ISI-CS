 Net hunting comes to Texas

 Houston, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Hunters soon may be able to sit at their computers and blast away at animals on a Texas ranch via the Internet, a prospect that has state wildlife officials up in arms.

 A controversial website, http://www.live-shot.com, already offers target practice with a .22 caliber rifle and could soon let hunters shoot at deer, antelope and wild pigs, site creator John Underwood said on yesterday.

 Texas officials are not quite sure what to make of Underwood?s website, but may tweak existing laws to make sure Internet hunting does not get out of hand.

 ?This is the first one I?ve seen,? said Texas Parks and Wildlife Department wildlife director Mike Berger.

 ?The current state statutes don?t cover this sort of thing.?

 Underwood, an estimator for a San Antonio, Texas auto body shop, has invested $10,000 to build a platform for a rifle and camera that can be remotely aimed on his 133-hectare southwest Texas ranch by anyone on the Internet anywhere in the world.

 The idea came last year while viewing another website on which cameras posted in the wild are used to snap photos of animals.

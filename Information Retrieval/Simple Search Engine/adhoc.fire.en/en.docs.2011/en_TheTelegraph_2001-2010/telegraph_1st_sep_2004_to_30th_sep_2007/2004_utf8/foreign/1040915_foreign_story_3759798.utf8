 Jessica set for movies

 Jessica Simpson

 Los Angeles, Sept. 14 (Reuters): 

 Pop star Jessica Simpson has been cast as Daisy Duke in 

 the big-screen remake of The Dukes of Hazzard, a 

 project that essentially marks her feature film debut.

 Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville already had been cast as Bo and Luke Duke, respectively, in the Warner Bros. project. Jay Chandrasekhar is directing. A start date has not yet been set.

 The series, which ran on CBS from 1979 to 1985, followed the weekly adventures of southern cousins Bo and Luke ? ?just two good ol? boys, never meaning no harm,? according to the Waylon Jennings theme song ? who raised hell driving their souped-up Dodge Charger, the General Lee, in fictional Hazzard County. 

 They, along with their cousin Daisy and Uncle Jesse, staged running battles with the corrupt authorities, Boss Hogg and Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane.

 Pop star Simpson shot to fame when her marital misadventures with fellow singer and husband, Nick Lachey, aired on MTV?s Newlyweds: Nick amp; Jessica.

 She has played herself in countless TV appearances and had a guest starring run on That ?70s Show. On the big screen, she played herself in the 2002 feature The Master of Disguise.

 Jessica, who was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, began her performing career as a member of her church choir.

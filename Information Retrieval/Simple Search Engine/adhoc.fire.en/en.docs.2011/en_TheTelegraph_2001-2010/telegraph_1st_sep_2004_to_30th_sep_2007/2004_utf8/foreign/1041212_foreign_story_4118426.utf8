 Fine Print

 Russia globe rage

 Moscow, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Russian deputies got hot under the collar yesterday when a shop in their building was believed to be selling globes of the world that awarded a disputed island chain to Japan.

 Speaker Boris Gryzlov ordered checks into the reports that some of the Kurile islands might be depicted on the globes as belonging to Japan rather than Russia, media reported. Russia and Japan have contested ownership of four of the Kurile Islands, called the Northern Territories in Japan, since the last days of World War II when Soviet forces seized them. The dispute has prevented them from signing a formal peace treaty. 

 If the globes proved to be ?incorrect?, they would have to be taken off display, local media said. But, RIA Novosti news agency reported, the shop may have pre-empted the order. The globes were nowhere to be seen, and the shop was shut?due to illness?. 

 Stones still on a roll

 New York (Reuters): The Rolling Stones 

 recently concluded recording sessions for a new album in 

 Paris with producer Don Was, who worked with them on their 

 two previous studio releases. The band will reconvene in 

 the New Year for additional sessions for an album tentatively 

 due in summer 2005, Was told Billboard.com. Was described 

 the Stones? new music as considerably different from their 

 recent releases, such as 1997?s Bridges to Babylon 

 and 1994?s Voodoo Lounge. ?Mick (Jagger) and Keith 

 (Richards) are writing songs together in a collaborative 

 fashion that probably hasn?t been seen since the late ?60s,? 

 he said. ?I would say that longtime fans of the Rolling 

 Stones will be thrilled with these results, and new fans 

 will understand why they?re the greatest rock ?? roll band 

 in the world.?

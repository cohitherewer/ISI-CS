 Boss, friends rock the vote

 Philadelphia, Oct. 2 (Reuters): Bruce Springsteen rocked concert-goers while trying to rock the vote last night, leading a band of top musicians in a rollicking show to help elect Democrat John Kerry to the White House.

 Headlining the first in a month-long set of ?Vote for Change? concerts, the rock star known as ?The Boss? told a sold-out arena: ?We?re here to fight for a government that is open, rational, forward-looking and humane.?

 ?And we?re going to rock the joint while doing so,? he said. The concerts mark the first time Springsteen delved into partisan politics, despite decades of writing about working class heroes, American dreams and social injustices.

 He and others in the show sponsored by the liberal group MoveOn.org call the November 2 presidential election ?the most important election of our lifetime.?

 Yet the show?s stars, who included the band R.E.M and former lead singer of classic rock staple Creedence Clearwater Revival John Fogerty, spent no time bashing Republican President George W. Bush, briefly plugged Kerry as the candidate of choice and played a barrage of crowd-pleasing, sing-along anthems.

 Springsteen performed such trademark hits as Born in the U.S.A as well as No Surrender, which the Kerry campaign has adopted as a signature song played at the Massachusetts Senator?s appearances on the stump.

 Springsteen joined R.E.M. for the band?s hit Man on the Moon, R.E.M.?s lead singer Michael Stipe joined Springsteen for a rendition of Because the Night and the entire cast closed with a rousing version of Patti Smith?s People Have the Power.

 As Springsteen played in Philadelphia, five other concerts starring such artists as Bonnie Raitt, the Dave Matthews Band, the Dixie Chicks and Pearl Jam played in other cities across Pennsylvania, one of the nation?s so-called battleground states seen as possibly swinging to either Bush or Kerry.

 The Vote for Change musicians plan about 40 benefit concerts in other battleground states, including Ohio, Florida and Missouri.

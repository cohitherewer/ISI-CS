 Move over Monroe, at 89 Miller finds love again

 Arthur Miller

 London, Dec. 12: Arthur Miller, America?s greatest living playwright, is used to being envied. He was, after all, married to Marilyn Monroe. 

 Now, to his obvious delight, he is attracting renewed interest for his choice of partner: this time a painter called Agnes Barley who is 55 years his junior. Speaking publicly about their relationship for the first time, Barley said: ?I?m not naive to the fact that people are curious about us. I feel very lucky.?

 Jen Bekman, her Manhattan dealer, said yesterday that Barley, 34, and the 89-year-old playwright adore each other.

 ?It?s in no way a case of her hitting the jackpot. They are in love and it?s a true romance. She is astonished as anyone at the path her life has taken. I don?t think she expected to fall in love, but she genuinely did.

 ?Agnes is a rather wonderful person: very friendly, very interesting and very inquisitive. And Arthur has such a presence, such magnetism. I think they have an idyllic existence ? in being creative, in their companionship and love.? 

 Until now, the couple, who have been living together for two years, have kept their match out of the headlines, although they were recently filmed pottering around in the garden of Miller?s 340-acre farm in Connecticut, which he bought after marrying Monroe in 1956.

 He met Barley in the autumn of 2002 at a dinner with mutual friends, several months after the death of his fourth wife Inge Morath from lymphoma.

 The first intimations that Barley might be Miller?s girlfriend ? she prefers the word partner ? came when they were seen at the opening of her exhibition of paintings at Bekman?s gallery on New York?s Lower East Side.

 Barley?s abstract, minimalist paintings ? described in the catalogue by Miller as ?not pictures but rather captures of space in which structures under tension react? ? sell for between $1,100 and $5,000 (?575 to ?2,600).

 Now, in an interview with W magazine, she has spoken about her relationship with the man she calls ?Darling?.

 ?We wake up and have breakfast together. Then we?ll go into our respective studios to work. We?ll usually meet for lunch, and perhaps go for a little walk. Then I?ll usually go back to my studio and paint some more,? she said.

 According to interviewer Catherine Hong, his new love is a petite brunette, with a measured, serious style of speaking. 

 Their age gap is even bigger than that between her fellow artist, Picasso, and his second wife Jacqueline Roque, who was 46 years his junior, or between another artist, Lucian Freud, and his last known girlfriend ? 30 to his 81 years.

 Barley said when she was introduced to the author of After the Fall, The Crucible and Death of a Salesman, ?I honestly didn?t know Arthur Miller was still living! I thought, ?He?s alive?? ?

 From the moment they began talking, she added, ?there was a sparkle between us?. 

 Barley is the daughter of an architect. She left home in Jacksonville, Florida, when she was 15 to live with her grandparents. ?I had a very special relationship with my grandfather,? she said. 

 Miller, who recently had a West End hit with a revival of The Price, is said to have agreed to stage a new version of The Crucible in London. In addition, said Barley: ?Arthur has even taken up painting himself.?

 Sunnis in no vote poll plan

 Baghdad, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Plagued by violence and fearing reprisals, many of Iraqs Sunnis said today they had resolved to stay at home on election day long before Osama bin Laden said anyone who voted was a infidel.

 With only a month to go until Iraqs first free poll, many Iraqis in the Sunni north and west said they would not vote while US-led troops remained on Iraqi soil anyway. Even those who once dreamed of casting their ballot now say they are too busy trying to stay alive to think about the January 30 poll.

 ?It makes no sense to put your life in danger to vote when the Americans will put whoever they want in power anyway,? said Mohammed, a Baghdad resident who refused to give his full name.

 ?Whatever bin Laden says, people had already made up their minds not to vote. I didn?t even register.? An audio tape purportedly from the al Qaida leader was aired yesterday, urging Iraqis to boycott the poll and saying anyone who took part was an infidel.

 But Iraqis dismissed the Saudi-born militants threats as outside interference. They had more pressing worries.

 ?I?m not bothered about the election; all I want is to return to Falluja and for violence to stop throughout Iraq,? said Said al-Dulaimi, 42, who fled last months US-led offensive in the western Iraqi city. 

Tikrit violence

 Insurgents overran a police post near Saddam Hussein?s home town today, hauled 12 men outside and shot them in a dramatic show of force.

 The dawn massacre in Tikrit, where the guerrillas also blew up the police station, was the bloodiest in a spate of attacks in the Sunni heartlands north of Baghdad; at least five other policemen were killed.

 Life after Boeing amp; beefy men

 Boston, Nov. 4 (Reuters): 

 Life will be at once different and familiar for John Kerry. 

 The crowds, motorcades and media entourage will be gone, 

 but a new US Senate session and some old battles await.

 In the last hurrah of a two-year, back-from-the-dead campaign to unseat President George W. Bush, the Democratic challenger stood before tearful family, staff, volunteers and friends yesterday and lamented: ?I wish, I wish, you don?t know how much I wish, I could have brought this race home.?

 In Boston?s historic Faneuil Hall, beneath a painting of John Quincy Adams with a brass plaque declaring: ?Liberty and Union Now and Forever,? the Massachusetts senator called for healing in America but vowed to fight on for the principles he brought to his White House bid ? health care, middle class tax cuts and a sensible foreign policy. Kerry now takes that battle back to the US Senate, where he has served since 1984 and has another four years left of his current term. 

 When the end comes for presidential candidates, it comes quickly. Less than 24 hours ago, Kerry and his staff were ebullient, upbeat at the prospect of winning and oblivious to the cool drizzle that threatened their outdoor victory celebration. But as yesterday dawned blustery and sunny, they were wondering: ?What now??

 Kerry telephoned Bush in late morning and conceded. By 2 pm, he left his home in Boston?s exclusive Beacon Hill with family and friends in a motorcade of a dozen or more vehicles trailing three van loads of media.

 Ten minutes later, he delivered a gracious and heartfelt concession speech and, within the hour, three black SUVs deposited him and his party back at his townhouse.

 The custom outfitted red, white and blue Boeing 757 emblazoned with Kerry?s name and campaign logo ?The Real Deal? prepared to fly staff back to Washington. It will be stripped, refitted and used to ferry oil executives around Central Asia. The beefy men in dark suits and earpieces will disappear soon. As a former presidential nominee, Kerry will not rate around-the-clock Secret Service protection.

 Edwards wife has cancer

 Elizabeth Edwards, wife of former Democratic vice-presidential candidate John Edwards, was diagnosed with breast cancer the day her husband and Senator John Kerry conceded the US presidential race.

 Treaty on smoking in 3 months, says UN

 Lee Jong-Wook

 Geneva, Dec. 1 (Reuters): A global treaty against smoking, which health authorities say can help save millions of lives, will come into force in three months, UN officials said today.

 The countdown for the world?s first legally binding health pact began after Peru became the 40th signatory state to deposit proof of ratification late yesterday. With that, the treaty automatically comes into force in 90 days, which will be on February 28, 2005, officials at the World Health Organisation (WHO) said.

 ?The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control... will now become international law in 90 days,? the UN health agency?s director-general, Lee Jong-Wook, said in a statement. 

 ?Implementing this global treaty will help countries to limit the enormous harm done by tobacco,? said Lee.

 The convention, which was approved by the WHO?s 192 member states in May last year, demands countries ban or set tight restrictions on tobacco advertising, sponsorship and promotion.

 It also lays down guidelines for health warnings to be placed on cigarette packets, recommends tax increases on tobacco products and calls for a crackdown on cigarette smuggling, amongst other measures.

 The WHO says 4.9 million people die each year from cancer, cardiovascular disease and other conditions linked to smoking and that the toll is likely to double by 2020, with 70 per cent of the victims in the developing world.

 There are some 1.3 billion smokers worldwide and on current trends this figure will reach 1.7 billion by 2025.

 But ensuring that the treaty, legally binding on those that have ratified it, took effect was only half the battle, and the challenge now was to increase the number of states where it was applied, WHO officials said. The US, home to some of the world?s largest tobacco companies, has signed it, but not yet ratified it.

 The pact took three years to negotiate and faced intense resistance from international tobacco firms which urged that any restrictions be voluntary. The pressure paid off in one key area ? taxation policy ? with individual countries being left to decide whether they will increase the cost of smoking.

 The WHO has long argued that high cigarette prices are the best way to get smokers to stop and prevent the young from starting.

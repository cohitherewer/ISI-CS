 Survivors battle thirst as corpses rot

 Banda Aceh (Indonesia), Dec. 29 (Reuters): Reeking corpses rotted in the tropical sun from India to Indonesia today and many who escaped death from one of the worst tsunamis in history fought for survival against thirst and disease.

 Rescuers scoured remote coastlines around the Indian Ocean for survivors of Sunday?s colossal seawater surge triggered by an earthquake that caused an arc of death across southern Asia and may have made the world wobble on its axis.

 ?I would not be at all surprised that we will be on 100,000 (deaths) when we know what has happened on the (Indian) Andaman and Nicobar islands,? Peter Rees of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.

 The federation currently puts the death toll at 77,828, making it one of the world?s worst natural disasters. In parts of India?s Tamil Nadu state, officials gave up counting the dead in their hurry to bury them in mass graves.

 The UN mobilised its biggest relief operation as fears that cholera and diarrhoea could further worsen the death toll. The WHO said five million people lacked the essentials of food, water and sanitation to survive.

 ?There is no food here whatsoever. We need rice. We need petrol. We need medicine,? said Vaiti Usman, an Indonesian woman in her mid-30s in the devastated Aceh province in Indonesia where tens of thousands died. ?I haven?t eaten in two days.?

 In many areas, health experts said the relief operation looked woefully inadequate with shortages of coffins, equipment and medicine, while emergency workers struggled with power outages, destroyed communications and badly damaged roads.

 Disease could kill as many people as the wave, health experts said as the full extent of the tragedy began to unfold.

 Buddhist monks handed out rice and curry to survivors in Sri Lanka and aircraft dropped food to isolated Indonesian towns.

 In Thailand, where thousands of tourists were on Christmas breaks escaping the northern winter, idyllic resorts were turned into graveyards. Near Khao Lak beach,the stench of decaying bodies hung over a Thai Buddhist temple-turned morgue.

 ?We have only cloth to wrap the bodies in and our bare hands and machetes to retrieve the bodies,? Surasit Kantipantukul, one rescuer in Pang Nga province where Khao Lak is located, said. 

 Indonesia suffered the biggest number of victims, with 45,268 known to be dead, although the toll could rise to 80,000 in Aceh alone, the province closest to the quake?s epicentre.

 In Sri Lanka, where the death toll topped 22,493, Tamil Tiger rebels appealed for help as they dug mass graves to bury thousands of bodies. All 135 children at an orphanage run by women rebels were killed.

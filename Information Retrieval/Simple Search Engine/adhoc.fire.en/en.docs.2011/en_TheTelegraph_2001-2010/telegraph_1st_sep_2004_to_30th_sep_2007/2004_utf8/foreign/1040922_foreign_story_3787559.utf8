 ?Two women for two men?

 London, Sept. 21 (Reuters): 

 The family of a British hostage threatened with execution 

 in Iraq begged Prime Minister Tony Blair today to save his 

 life.

 Kenneth Bigley, 62, is being held hostage with American Jack Hensley by the Tawhid and Jihad group headed by al Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Another American seized with them last Thursday, Eugene Armstrong, was beheaded in a gruesome murder shown on an Internet video overnight.

 Bigley?s son Craig made a direct appeal to Blair, piling pressure on a Prime Minister who has already seen his popularity ratings plunge because of role in the Iraq war. ?I ask Tony Blair personally to consider the amount of bloodshed already suffered,? Craig said on BBC television. ?Only you can save him now... Please meet the demands and release my father ? two women for two men.?

 The US is holding two women scientists, suspected of working on ex-president Saddam Hussein?s banned weapons programmes, in a special prison for high-profile detainees. In the video of Armstrong?s murder, the hostage-takers said they had killed him because US authorities had failed to free women prisoners in Iraqi jails. They gave another 24 hours for Washington to do so, or the other two hostages would be killed. A spokesman for Blair?s Downing Street office said he had nothing further to say for now. Blair has said little on the capture of Bigley and the Americans, a stance which contrasts with appeals by President Jacques Chirac for the release of two French journalists held hostage and with George W. Bush, who he would not bow to kidnappers? demands.

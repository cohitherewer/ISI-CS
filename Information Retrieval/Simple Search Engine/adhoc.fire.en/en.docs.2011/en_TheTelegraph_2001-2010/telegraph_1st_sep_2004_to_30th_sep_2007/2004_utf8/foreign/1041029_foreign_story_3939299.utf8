 Blast after suffocation deaths

 Pattani (Thailand), Oct. 28 (Reuters): A bomb exploded in southern Thailand today, killing one person and injuring about 20, in what could be the first reaction to the deaths of 85 Muslim protesters earlier this week.

 The blast came just hours after Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra met his security advisers amid fears of Muslim outrage over the deaths of the protesters, which included 78 people suffocated in military custody.

 Hospital sources said at least one person was killed and about 20 others were injured by the blast in the border town of Sungai Kolok in Narathiwat province. Many of the victims were in and around a bar in the tourist centre of the town. It was the same province where the 85 died on Monday. Muslim leaders have warned of a violent backlash to the tragedy.

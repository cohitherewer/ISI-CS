 Bitter Blunkett breaks his silence

 David Blunkett: ?Just life?

 London, Dec. 13: David Blunkett has broken his silence over a relationship with the married publisher Kimberly Quinn and betrayed the full extent of his bitterness at the breakdown of their affair.

 The home secretary suggested in a BBC interview that he tried his hardest to make the relationship permanent, and public, but Kimberly Quinn, the publisher of the Spectator, had different ideas.

 ?I fell in love with someone and they wouldn?t go public, and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer, and then the News of the World picked up the story,? he told BBC Radio Sheffield.

 ?I tried for three years to make something work. I haven?t spoken about it and I don?t intend to. Even in the biography that?s being written about me I?ve ensured that there?s as little as possible.?

 The remarks, broadcast for the first ti me yesterday, were recorded in November before allegations surfaced that he had used his position to fast-track a visa application from Kimberly Quinn?s nanny.

 Blunkett, who denied new claims about his alleged role in speeding up the application, said he was a ?great believer in responsibility and consequences?, and whatever happened to him was his ?lookout?.

 Apparently referring to Kimberly Quinn, who is married to Stephen Quinn, the publisher of Vogue, he added: ?I always said, and I still believe it, that I would never be enamoured by money or glitter, although individuals sometimes shine like gold and when you rub them you find out they are not.? Asked who he was thinking about he said: ?Just life, just life.?

 Yesterday the home office strenuously denied reports that the home secretary held a meeting with his officials at which he brandished a letter written by immigration officials to the nanny, Leoncia Casalme, to intimidate them into speeding up her application.

 According to The Sunday Times, which cited a ?senior Whitehall insider? as its source, Blunkett is said to have ?hit the roof? when the officials said they were clearing the backlogs in the system. 

 A spokesman for the home secretary again insisted that Blunkett?s only involvement with the application was when he checked that the original application form was in order. No attempts were made to speed it up and he had not taken the letter to a meeting.

 ?David Blunkett had no contact with this letter at all, at any stage,? said the spokesman. An independent report into the visa controversy is expected to be published before Christmas.

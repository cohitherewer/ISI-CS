Kabul, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Independent observers described Afghanistan?s historic presidential election as mostly fair today despite turmoil over possible multiple voting that led most of the candidates to call for a general boycott.

 From the southern plains to the Hindu Kush mountains and northern steppes of the impoverished Islamic nation, millions of Afghans turned out yesterday to choose a leader for the first time, despite threats by Taliban rebels to sabotage the election.

 The largest group of independent poll observers, the Free and Fair Election Foundations of Afghanistan, made of 13 local non-governmental organisations, said the vote was fair despite the complaints. ?While the reasons for the incorrectly applied indelible ink remain to be seen, a fairly democratic environment has generally been observed in the overall majority of polling centres,? it said.

 Midway through yesterday, all 15 rivals of US-backed interim President Hamid Karzai had announced they were boycotting the poll because a system to prevent voting fraud had failed. Many demanded a new vote but Karzai, favourite to win, rejected the demand. 

 At issue was indelible ink put on the finger of everyone who voted to stop them voting again. Some election workers used the wrong pen to mark voters, and the ordinary marker ink was quickly washed off.

 And with questions over the late and rapid registration of 10.5 million voter cards in a population of about 28 million, there were accusations of illegal multiple voting.

 Karzai said today that some of the candidates who called for a boycott had changed their mind and were willing to accept its legitimacy.

 ?Some of the esteemed candidates have rejected the boycotting of the election,? Karzai told a news conference. ?And we are hopeful that other candidates do not ignore the national jubilation and let votes be counted. The Afghan people voted yesterday in millions and that is what I see,? he added. ?I am blinded to everything else. It was a celebration.? 

 Some 850,000 Afghan refugees voted in Iran and Pakistan, about half the number eligible in Iran and 80 per cent of those registered in Pakistan, the International Organisation for Migration?s refugee voting operation said in Islamabad.

 ?The millions who came to the polls clearly wanted to turn from the rule of the gun to the rule of law,? said the Organisation for Security and Cooperation of Europe.

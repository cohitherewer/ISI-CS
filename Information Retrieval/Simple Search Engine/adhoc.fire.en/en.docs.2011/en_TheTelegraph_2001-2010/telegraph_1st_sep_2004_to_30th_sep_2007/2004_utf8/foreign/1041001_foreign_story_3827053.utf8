 Older drinkers

 Dallas, Sept. 30 (Reuters): Older women who have a drink or two a day have better memory skills than non-drinkers, University of Texas researchers said yesterday.

 ?Moderate drinkers reported less depression, had higher self-reported health, performed better on instrumental everyday tasks ... and (had) improved memory performance,? Dr Graham McDougall, associate professor of nursing at the university, said in a statement.

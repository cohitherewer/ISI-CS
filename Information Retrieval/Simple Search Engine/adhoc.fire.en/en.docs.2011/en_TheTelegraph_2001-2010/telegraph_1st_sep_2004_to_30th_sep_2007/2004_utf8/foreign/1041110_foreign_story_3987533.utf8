 NRI family murder trial begins

 AMIT ROY 

 London, Nov. 9: The trial of three Englishmen accused of murdering an entire Indian family ? husband, wife, two children and mother-in-law ? has opened at the Old Bailey in London with these chilling words from the prosecuting counsel: ?Some crimes are beyond belief and, on any view, these horrific murders fall into that category.?

 The bodies of Amarjit Chohan, 46, his wife, Nancy, 25, and Chohan?s mother-in-law Charanjit Chohan, 51, were recovered from the sea last year. But those of Chohan?s two little sons, Devinder, 18 months, and Ravinder, two months, have not so far been found.

 In recent British criminal history, there has apparently not been a similar case where children have been murdered in order to guarantee silence.

 On trial are the alleged ringleader, Kenneth Regan, 55, of Forge Close, Wilton, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, who is said to have tried to steal Chohan?s business, with the help of his accomplices, William Horncy, 52, of Adeline Road, Bournemouth, and Peter Rees, 39, of King?s Close, Rowlands Castle, Hampshire.

 What unfolded at the opening day of the trial yesterday was an extraordinary and frightening story. 

 Amarjit Chohan, also known as ?Anil? Chohan, ran CIBA Freight, a business based in Southall, west London, with a ?5million turnover importing and exporting fruit. 

 The prosecuting counsel, Richard Horwell, admitted he was a ?chancer? ? English slang for a slightly dodgy businessman. Chohan was jailed for three years for tax evasion in 1996 and served 18 months. The business he ran was also somewhat chaotic since he paid staff with a mixture of cash and cheques.

 Regan, who had wormed his way into Chohan?s company through a mutual contact, decided to steal the Indian?s company. He was jailed for eight years in 1998 after being caught with 55lb of heroin and released in 2002. He apparently wanted to take over Chohan?s company as a front for future drugs dealings. 

 Regan was known as ?Captain Cash? because he used to flash cash around.

 ?Three generations of a family were executed ? deliberately killed because of the greed of these defendants,? said Horwell. ?They intended to make substantial gains from their dreadful crimes.?

 Regan lured Chohan into a trap by pretending he had found a possible buyer for his company but the men were turned up to the meeting were Regan?s associates, Horncy and Rees. 

 Chohan was murdered but in order to ensure the plot would succeed, the other members of the victim?s family were also abducted, killed and their bodies buried in a field. The court was also told that when Regan felt the police closing in on the farm, the bodies were exhumed, taken to sea and dumped overboard. Unfortunately for them, three were found.

 Regan pretended that Chohan had fled abroad with his family to escape tax and other money problems but Nancy?s brother, Onkar Verma, who had come from New Zealand, just did not believe his sister would disappear without a word.

 It seems the strength of Indian family ties paid off.

 ?He refused to accept that his mother, his sister and her family would have vanished without trace,? Horwell said.

 The court has yet to hear evidence on how the Chohan family members were killed.

 Describing the events of February 13 last year, Horwell said that Chohan was asked by Regan to come to a meeting in Stonehenge.

 ?In fact, Mr Chohan walked into a trap,? said Horwell. ?From that morning onwards, the three defendants were the only people ever to see Mr Chohan alive. On the Sunday Mr Chohan made a short call to one of his employees saying that he would be going away for some time. No one heard from him again. It was likely that he was murdered later that night.?

 The prosecuting counsel said: ?To make Mr Chohan?s disappearance appear genuine, it was or became necessary for his family also to be murdered. Horncy and Rees played important parts and they, no doubt, expected to be handsomely rewarded for their grim contribution.?

 He went on: ?At some point over the weekend of February 15-16, Nancy Chohan, her two sons and her mother were sucked into this wickedness. That they were murdered is beyond doubt. Precisely how, when and where is less clear.?

 Within a few days, the three defendants had buried the family?s bodies in the grounds of a house in Tiverton, Devon, owned by one of Regan?s women friends. 

 ?Realising the police were about to start making inquiries in Tiverton, the three returned to the farm where the bodies had been buried,? according to Horwell. ?They were dug up. On Easter Sunday, using a boat that had been specifically bought for the purpose, the bodies were taken out to sea and dumped.?

 Horwell continued his case: ?Two days later, the body of Mr Chohan was found floating in the water not far from Bournemouth pier. It was that unexpected and chance discovery that brought this plan to an end.?

 His wife?s body was recovered in the same area in July. Charanjit Chohan?s was found in November in a bay off the Isle of Wight.

 Horwell said that Regan and Horncy fled the country to Spain. Rees was arrested not long afterwards. The following month Regan was arrested in Belgium. Horncy surrendered to police at Dover in September.

 The trial is expected to last four to six weeks.

 Kerry, Bush spar over Iraq

 Sept. 7: (Reuters): Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry launched one of his harshest broadsides against the Iraq war yesterday, sparking an angry response from US President George W. Bush, as the war overshadowed their attempts to focus on the economy.

 Marking Labor Day, the traditional kick-off for what has become a marathon presidential campaign season, the two candidates held rallies in the battleground states of Missouri, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with Kerry now trailing by double digits in national polls.

 Kerry tried to focus on domestic issues at a neighbourhood meeting in Canonsburg, but members of the audience raised Iraq. After months of off-and-on criticism of the war, Kerry seized the opening, calling the invasion the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time, and said his goal was to withdraw US troops in a first White House term. In a statement issued later, Kerry called Iraq a quagmire created by Bushs wrongheaded, go-it-alone policy.

 Bush turned from his tax reform proposals to shoot back at Kerry during a rally in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, accusing the Massachusetts senator of vacillating on Iraq after bringing in new advisers.

 After voting for the war but against funding it, after saying he would have voted for the war even knowing everything we know today, my opponent woke up this morning with new campaign advisers and yet another new position, Bush said. 

 No matter how many times Senator Kerry changes his mind, it was right for America then and its right for America now, he told the crowd, which chanted back, flip-flop, flip flop. Some senior Democrats have advised Kerry to focus on jobs and the economy as he tries to reinvigorate his campaign. Polls show Bushs popularity with voters is particularly strong on Iraq and issues of national security.

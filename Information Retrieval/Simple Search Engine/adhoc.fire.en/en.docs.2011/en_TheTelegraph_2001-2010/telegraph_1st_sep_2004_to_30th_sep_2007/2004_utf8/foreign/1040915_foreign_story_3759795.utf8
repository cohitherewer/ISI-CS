 Caged catch

 Rio de Janeiro, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Two Brazilian car thieves started their life behind bars while still on the run when they chose a cage in a Rio de Janeiro zoo to hide from police, officials said yesterday.

 A zoo keeper said the pair were found hiding in an enclosure where deer and tapir are kept after police chased the fugitives into the zoo on Sunday. ?Apparently police thought that the bandits were going to take the animals hostage, but, thank God, that did not happen. They just wanted to hide,? the keeper said.

 Atomic U2

 London (Reuters): Irish rock band U2 

 on Tuesday disclosed the title and set the release date 

 for its next album, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, 

 which will hit record shops on November 23. The album, recorded 

 in Dublin and the south of France, hit the headlines after 

 recordings from it went missing in July. The disappearance 

 of rough versions of some tracks from a Nice, France, recording 

 studio prompted fears they would turn up on the Internet 

 before their official release.

 ?Vertigo? will be the first single from the new album, which is a follow-up to the 2000 success All That You Cant Leave Behind.

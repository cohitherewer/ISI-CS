 China coal mine blast traps 166

 Beijing, Nov. 28 (Reuters): A gas explosion tore through a coal mine in northern China today, trapping as many as 166 miners in what could be the worst disaster to hit the world?s most dangerous mining industry in four years.

 At least 127 miners escaped from the state-owned Chenjiashan Coalmine in Shaanxi province after today morning?s explosion, the official Xinhua news agency said.

 Of those, 41 were in hospital, five with serious injuries, Xinhua said on its website. Some of the escaped miners had suffered carbon monoxide poisoning.

 Some 2,000 rescue workers rushed to the scene along with acting provincial governor Chen Deming. Rescuers advanced several hundred metres into the mine but were blocked by heavy smoke, state media said. 

 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking in the Lao capital of Vientiane, said the accident highlighted the need for more high-level attention to safety measures.

 ?We not only must find out all the details of the disaster and seriously get to the root of who is responsible, moreover we must make efforts in safety and prevention measures,? said Wen, a former geologist.

 Warlords look for poll polish

 - Afghan candidates turn to spin doctors for ?softer? image

 Kabul, Oct. 3: The discreet white villa down a potholed Kabul sidestreet is the unlikely headquarters of Afghanistan?s first political spin-doctoring operation.

 From here, a small team of western political advisers, brought by the UN to teach 18 presidential hopefuls how to get ?on message? for next weekend?s historic election, has grappled with a string of daunting electioneering challenges.

 How, for example, could the ?positive? qualities of Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord accused of massacring thousands during the country?s civil war, best be brought out? And how, after Abdul Hafiz Mansoor, the former head of Afghan state television, famously banned women from singing on air, can female voters be persuaded that he is part of the ?new?, progressive Afghanistan?

 These are among the image problems that Christian Marie, a UN-funded adviser to Awaz, an Afghan media consultancy, faced while teaching fledgling politicians the dark arts of media manipulation.

 There is genuine excitement among Afghans at the prospect of voting for a President and Vice-President for the first time. Almost all the country?s 10 million eligible adults have registered for Saturday?s polls.

 Posters of the former Mujahideen fighters, academics and relatives of bygone royalty who are vying for their vote festoon every city street but few candidates have ventured out in person, partly because of threats from remnants of the ousted Taliban regime.

 Marie, previously a political adviser in France, has faced an uphill battle just ensuring that voters know who the candidates are.

 He said: ?Because it?s the first time anybody has voted, and because of the lack of newspapers and television, most people have never heard of any of the candidates, except perhaps Hamid Karzai, the current President.?

 Awaz ? literally, The Voice ? has 20 foreign and local staff helping candidates to produce party political broadcasts for radio and television, and design campaign posters.

 Marie?s team had expected candidates to pick an array of suggestions for manifestos and slogans but almost all plumped for similar themes reflecting the challenges facing Afghanistan ? unity, security and reconstruction.

 Instead, his team taught them how to stand out ? advising Dr Massouda Jalal, for example, a former teacher and paediatrician, to highlight the fact that she is the only female presidential candidate.

 Marie said: ?To avoid upsetting the male vote, she was not promoting herself as a woman. We said to her, ?You can be different from the warlords by focusing on the fact that you are a mother, doctor and teacher.?

 When the image-makers visited Gen Dostum at his heavily fortified headquarters near the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, they found him angrily refusing to participate in ?Bollywood acting? for his official campaign broadcast. 

 Eventually, they persuaded Gen Dostum ? an aficionado of ?buzkashi?, a type of polo played with an animal?s carcass ? to be filmed instead on horseback. The resulting shot proved suitably swashbuckling and became his defining campaign image.

 Ahmad Shah Ahmadzai, a stern-looking Islamist, was transformed into a smiling, grandfatherly figure for the lens. 

 Mansoor, the anti-singing candidate, made it clear that he did not need any advice from a UN-appointee. Marie said: ?We wondered how we might distance him from all that. But he made it pretty clear that he didn?t want people to forget about it.?

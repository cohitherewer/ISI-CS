 Prescott slams Bush

 John Prescott

 Brighton (England), Sept. 30 

 (Reuters): A senior British minister today hit out at US 

 President George W. Bush, one of Tony Blair?s key allies, 

 saying his government was only concerned about an elitist 

 few.

 Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, speaking at the ruling Labour Party?s annual conference, lambasted people of the political Right for never being concerned about the majority.

 ?If anyone is in any doubt about what happens when the Right takes over a country, go and ask the Dutch, go and ask the Swedes, go and ask the Danes what happened in those countries where everything they?ve done was dismantled by the Right governments,? Prescott said. ?And yes, go and ask the Americans. Bill Clinton was replaced by another Right-winger who used compassionate conservatism as his soundbite.?

 Quoting from Clinton, Prescott said: ?Compassionate: that?s the rhetoric. Conservative: that?s the reality.?

 Britain?s Labour Party has traditionally seen the US Democrats as natural partners, but Blair has annoyed some in his party for his staunch support for Bush over Iraq. But the party today overwhelmingly voted to support Britains military presence there.

 Blair appealed today to kidnappers holding a hostage in Iraq to make contact ? but ruled out doing deals as domestic divisions over the war continued to dog the Prime Minister. ?Of course, if they make contact, we are ready to talk to them,? Blair said of the captors of British engineer Kenneth Bigley.

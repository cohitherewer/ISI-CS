 Karzai leads in initial tally

 Kabul, Oct. 15 (Reuters): With 99 per cent of the votes still to be counted in Afghanistan?s presidential election, incumbent Hamid Karzai had taken a lead that many observers expect him to retain right to the end of a marathon count.

 Counting was halted today for the first day of Ramazan, and will resume tomorrow.

 Objections by Karzai?s opponents over voting irregularities meant counting only got under way yesterday, some five days after millions of Afghans went to the polls for the first time to pick a leader.

 During the few hours of counting some 34,078 votes were tallied, of which 19,367 went to Karzai, giving him a 57.9 per cent share of the votes counted so far.

 Afghan militant leader held in Pak

 Islamabad, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Pakistani security forces have arrested the head of an Afghan militant group responsible for kidnapping three UN workers in neighbouring Afghanistan, the information minister said today.

 ?Yes, we arrested Syed Akbar Agha, the chief of Jaish-e Muslimeen (Army of Muslims), in Karachi around 10 days ago,? minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed said.

 ?He was the mastermind of the kidnapping of UN workers in Afghanistan,? he said. Jaish-e Muslimeen, a small splinter faction of the Taliban formed earlier this year, is active in the Pashtun-dominated southern parts of Afghanistan.

 In October, the group abducted UN workers Annetta Flanigan from Northern Ireland, Kosovan Shqipe Hebibi and Filipino diplomat Angelito Nayan in Kabul. The three were freed unharmed on November 23. Habib Noorzad, a senior member of Jaish-e Muslimeen, denied that Agha, a former Taliban governor, was arrested.

 ?It is all part of the propaganda,? he said by satellite telephone today from his hideout somewhere in southern Afghanistan. ?He was in our contact till yesterday,? he said.

 But a military commander of Jaish-e Muslimeen, Ishaq Manzoor, said it was possible Agha had been arrested. ?We are trying to confirm the report. He was not in our contact for the past several days.?

 Ahmed, the Pakistani information minister, said Agha was arrested when security forces raided a flat. ?He was living there with his family members who have not been arrested,? he said. ?He is still with Pakistani security forces and is being interrogated.?

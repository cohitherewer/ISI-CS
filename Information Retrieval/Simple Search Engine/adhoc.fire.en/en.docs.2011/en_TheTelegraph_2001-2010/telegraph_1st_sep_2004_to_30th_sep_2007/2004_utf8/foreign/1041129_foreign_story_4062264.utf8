 Harry?s ?first true love?

 Prince Harry

 London, Nov. 28 (PTI): A 19-year-old blonde, whose father runs a game farm in Zimbabwe, has stolen Prince Harry?s heart and the pair have spent the past two weeks in Argentina at a remote polo lodge, 80 km from Buenos Aires, a leading tabloid claimed today.

 Harry spent almost the entire trip at the side of the south African student Chelsy Davy ? regarded by insiders as his ?first true love?, The Mail on Sunday reported.

 Harry and Chelsy first met when she was a pupil at exclusive Cheltenham Ladies? College ? close to Prince Charles? Highgrove estate. Their romance is believed to have begun eight months ago.

 Quoting a source at the El Remanso polo lodge, the tabloid said: ?Harry and Chelsy were like any young couple in love, kissing and holding hands, and he seemed quite besotted?.

 ?They looked madly in love and at one point Harry admitted she was his first true love. They did all the normal things young people do. We held a small barbecue and they sat beside each other and were laughing and joking. She seemed very relaxed in his company.?

 According to the report Harry even flew Chelsy out on a hunting expedition to a private game lodge in the province of Entre Rios last weekend. It is not the first time the pair have enjoyed a break together. The couple spent discreet weekends in Cape Town during the summer while Harry was working with AIDS victims in Lesotho, the report said. 

 The newspaper said Harry seemed paranoid about being seen together with Chelsy by the paparazzi following him.

 ?When they went on the hunting trip, where they were mostly shooting pigeons, someone got out a small camera. Harry seemed quite agitated about having their picture taken together.?

 It is obvious he is besotted with her....When someone asked how long they had been going out together she blushed and said, eight months.?

 ?Harry seemed very protective of her and often had an arm around her shoulders. She was definitely a calming influence on him. We had some drinks at the barbecue but he had only one beer and half a glass of wine.

 ?Chelsy was sweet and was very proud of harry when they were hunting, as he is a very good shot. They flew in together on a private plane and left together. There was no doubt they were a couple,? the paper said.

 Last night, at the spacious house in cape town she shares with her brother shaun, 20, and other female students, chelsy confirmed: ?i have known harry since i was at school.? asked about their romance, she seemed shaken and said: ?i have heard people linking us together.?

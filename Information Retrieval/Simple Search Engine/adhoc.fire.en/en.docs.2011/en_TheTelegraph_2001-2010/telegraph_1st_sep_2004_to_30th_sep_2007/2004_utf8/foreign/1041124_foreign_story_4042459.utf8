 Musharraf courtesy call to Sharif

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Nov. 23: In a bid to improve ties with Opposition parties, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf called Nawaz Sharif in Saudi Arabia to convey his feelings over the death of Sharif?s father.

 Confirming the telephonic conversation between the two leaders, secretary general of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League Mushahid Hussein Syed said the sole purpose of the call was to condole the death of Sharif?s father.

 This was the first direct contact between the two after Musharraf?s coup over Nawaz Sharif in October 1999.

 Sharif?s father died in Saudi Arabia earlier this year but the government refused permission to Sharif and his younger brother Shahbaz to attend the funeral of Mian Sharif in Lahore.

 The Sharif family had gone into exile under a deal between the Pakistan government and the Saudi royal family in December 2000, almost a year after Musharraf overthrew Nawaz Sharif.

 ?The contact between President Musharraf and former Prime Minister reflects maturity and decency in Pakistani politics,? Syed said.

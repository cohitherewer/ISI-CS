 Aziz to recast cabinet

 Islamabad, Aug. 31: Pakistans new Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz will name a cabinet tomorrow with changes in more than half the portfolios, but he will retain finance and there will be no change at the foreign ministry, officials said.

 Among those ministers expected to be replaced is interior minister Faisal Salah Hayat, said a senior official of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML).

 More than 60 per cent of the portfolios will change, the official, who did not want to be identified, said. But Aziz would keep the finance portfolio, while foreign affairs will remain in the hands of Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri.

 Officials and analysts said cabinet changes would not entail dramatic policy shifts and there would be no changes in Pakistans support for the US-led war on terror, which would continue to be led by Musharraf, who wields ultimate power as President.

 The official said those taking the oath tomorrow would be full ministers, while the names of junior ministers would be announced later.

 Officials have said Aziz was likely to appoint a deputy for the finance portfolio, with Omar Ayub, grandson of Pakistans first military ruler Field Marshal Ayub Khan, seen as one of the contenders.

 PML sources said the government, which comprises a coalition of smaller and regional parties led by the league, did not intend to change the number of ministries held by each partner.

 Aziz, a former Citibank executive credited with turning around Pakistans economic fortunes, was elected Prime Minister on Friday by the National Assembly.

 Musharraf picked Aziz in June to become head of government after the abrupt resignation of Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali. Aziz had to win a parliamentary seat before taking up the post.

 Baluchistan blast

 A powerful bomb blast killed three persons and injured ten, three of them critically, in the southwestern city of Qalat today. The police said the device was planted near a sweet shop in Qalat, 160 km from the Baluchistan capital, Quetta.

 The incident comes after a skirmish in which militants killed three paramilitary soldiers in an armed attack in Naseerabad district, 280 km southeast of Quetta, last week.

 Baluchistan has been in the grip of violent attacks by groups angered by the central governments policy of not giving the province its due share of gas reserves.

 Hu tells HK leaders to shape up

 Macau, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Chinese President Hu Jintao congratulated Macau today on its success with the ?one country, two systems? reunification formula but scolded Hong Kong?s government, saying it needed to shape up.

 Hu was visiting the former Portuguese-run enclave of Macau to mark the fifth anniversary of its return to Beijing?s fold. The unusual public criticism of Hong Kong came during a meeting he held with Hong Kong officials in Macau.

 ?I hope everyone will seriously reflect on what Hong Kong has gone through while implementing ?one country, two systems? since returning to the motherland, draw conclusions from its experience and examine its shortcomings ... and raise its administrative ability and standard of its governance,? Hu said.

 ?I hope everyone will bear in mind Hong Kong?s overall interests... and strengthen unity and cooperation,? Hu said as Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa and his ministers stood listening, expressionless. Hus comments were carried by Cable Television.

 Beijing has tried for years to convince arch-rival Taiwan to accept the ?one country, two systems? model for reunification crafted by late Chinese patriarch Deng Xiaoping, which allows for some local autonomy in exchange for accepting Beijings rule.

 Hu dwelt on Macau?s success during a speech marking its handover anniversary, but made no mention of Taiwan.

 ?Time has proven that Deng Xiaoping?s ?one country, two systems? formula is perfectly accurate and it will continue to exhibit an immense power to live on,? said Hu, who is visiting Macau for the first time as president.

 ?Macau?s return to China in the last five years has brought great improvements. Under the government of chief executive Edmund Ho ... it has overcome the Asian financial crisis, external economic changes, Sars and other challenges.? 

 Hu has never, as President, visited neighbouring Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997. Some analysts are questioning whether Beijing attaches more importance to Macau as a model to showcase ?one country, two systems? to sceptics in Taiwan.

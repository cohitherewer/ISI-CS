 Vote crucial for ending violence on women

 Presidential candidate Massouda Jalal

Kabul, Oct. 5 (Reuters): US-based Human Rights 

Watch said today women were still persecuted in Afghanistan, where many hope Saturday?s 

presidential election will be a milestone in the drive to end decades of violence.

 ?Regional military factions and religious conservative leaders, as well as the Taliban and other insurgent forces, are limiting Afghan womens participation in society through death threats, harassment and physical attacks,? the rights group said in a report.

 While the Islamist rule of the Taliban militia in the impoverished nation ended in late 2001, Human Rights Watch said change had been far too slow.

 There had been little follow through on women?s rights since US-led forces vanquished the Taliban in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the rights group said. Article 22 of the Afghan Constitution adopted this year reads: ?The citizens of Afghanistan ? whether man or woman ? have equal rights and duties before the law?.

 Human Rights Watch said the constitution, registration of more than four million women voters and one million girls at school were all encouraging.

 But Afghan women were victims of sexual violence, girls and young women were still exchanged to settle feuds or repay debts and there were still many cases of early and forced marriages.

 ?In 2001, after the fall of the Taliban, improving the rights of women was at the top of the international agenda,? the group said. ?In 2004, despite many well-intentioned programmes for women, women?s human rights appear to be more of an afterthought.?

 A study conducted by the ministry of women?s affairs and a non-government organisation showed around 57 per cent of women are married before they turned 16.

 A liberal candidate for the presidential election, Latif Pedram, was almost barred after he supported giving women rights of divorce. Hardliners accused him of being un-Islamic.

 Over 41 per cent of more than 11 million registered voters in the Islamic nation are women, but Human Rights Watch said that figure should be treated with caution. 

 In a country where illiteracy is the norm, women, who have had no political say before, are particularly disadvantaged. At a college in Kabul today, the UN ran a programme teaching women what to expect at polling centres.

 ?We even explain how to hold a pen,? said Amandine Roche, who was overseeing the exercise.

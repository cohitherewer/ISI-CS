 Dan Rather to quit in March

 New York, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Veteran newsman Dan Rather, embroiled in a recent journalism scandal about President George W. Bush?s service in the National Guard during the Vietnam War, will resign in March as the CBS network?s top news anchor, the network said today.

 CBS, a unit of Viacom, said Rather will remain as a correspondent for the news magazine show 60 Minutes and other assignments.

 ?I have decided to leave the CBS Evening News on March 9, 2005,? Rather said. 

 Rather said he began talks in the summer with his bosses about when would be an appropriate time to step down and decided to wait until after the recent election, which saw Bush elected for a second term.

 Dump destiny for 9/11 victims

 CHARLES LAURENCE 

 New York, Oct. 10: The remains of hundreds of victims of the September 11 attacks are to be permanently buried in the world?s largest rubbish dump, to the consternation of their grieving relatives.

 In the aftermath of 9/11, more than half a million tons of dust and ashes from the Twin Towers were taken to the sprawling Fresh Kills landfill site on Staten Island. 

 More than 100 years? worth of refuse from New York City had accumulated at the dump before it was finally closed just six months before the attacks. The rubble from the World Trade Center ended up covering some 48 acres.

 Relatives were assured that ashes would be returned after they were sorted, but city authorities have since balked at the estimated $450 million cost of transferring them again. Instead they have promised to lay a 2,200-acre park on top of the dump, whose rotting contents smell strongly of methane, and to erect a memorial to the victims.

 Relatives of 1,169 of the 3,000 who died have yet to receive any remains, and many are outraged at the authorities? decision.

 Diane Horning, whose son Matthew, 24, died in the North Tower, where he worked for insurance company Marsh and McLennan, said: ?We were promised the remains ? any and all remains of the victims ? and now we discover that my lost son is to spend eternity in a rubbish dump. This is morally reprehensible and emotionally unacceptable, and we are going to fight it all the way.?

 Matthew made two mobile phone calls to his family after the first jet struck the World Trade Center. He asked his father to tell his fiancee, Maura, that he loved her. His last word, sent on a pager message, was: ?Scared?.

 The office of the New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg, pointed out that the coroner?s office was still trying to identify 10,260 fragments of remains gathered at Fresh Kills. Those that remained unidentified would be interred in the official memorial at the Twin Tower site.

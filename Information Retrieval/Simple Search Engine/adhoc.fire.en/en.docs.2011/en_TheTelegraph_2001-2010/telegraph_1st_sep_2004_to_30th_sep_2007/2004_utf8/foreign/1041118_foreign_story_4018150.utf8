 Smelly scourge

 Berlin, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Germans find smelly co-workers to be the most annoying aspect of their jobs, according to a survey by the German business magazine Junge Karriere.

 The survey found 38 per cent of German office workers were ?most bothered? by the smells of their colleagues, 15 per cent said they were annoyed by co-workers socialising too much, and 14 per cent by untidy desks.

 The poll of 354 participants found 26 per cent were content with their jobs and have nothing at all to complain about.

 Force feed

 Wellington (Reuters): A woman in New 

 Zealand says she is breastfeeding her pet puppy because 

 she wants it to protect her baby daughter as they both grow 

 up. Kura Tumanako told the NZPA news agency on Wednesday 

 that she had started breastfeeding the Staffordshire bull 

 terrier pup after her baby stopped taking her milk. ?I didn?t 

 want to waste it so I gave it to Honey Boy,? she said. Tumanako 

 said she had fed the dog twice a day for the past week but 

 would probably wean it off in about six weeks? time. Her 

 baby, now two-and-a-half months old, is on bottled milk.

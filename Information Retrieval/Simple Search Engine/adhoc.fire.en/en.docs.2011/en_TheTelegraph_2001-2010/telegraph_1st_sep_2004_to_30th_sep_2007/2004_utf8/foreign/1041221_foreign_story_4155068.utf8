 UK terror lawyer quits in disgust

 London, Dec. 20 (Reuters): A senior lawyer tasked with defending terrorism suspects from secret evidence in Britain quit in disgust today, throwing security policy into more turmoil after judges ruled the state was violating basic rights.

 Ian Macdonald, on a government-appointed team of ?special advocates? given access to secret evidence in terrorism cases, said he was resigning because the state?s post-September 11 emergency anti-terrorism powers were ?an odious blot?.

 His resignation came days after judges in the House of Lords, sitting as the country?s highest court, ruled the three-year-old powers violate international human rights law.

 The case, like rulings by the US Supreme Court on the treatment of ?enemy combatants? earlier this year, dealt with fundamental questions of how far states could go to suspend basic rights in the fight against terrorism. Shortly after the September 11, 2001, attacks, Britain declared an emergency and said this allowed it to suspend the right to a fair trial guaranteed under European law.

 Cuba counters US publicity

 Washington, Dec. 18: A war of words flared yesterday when Cuban authorities displayed a giant swastika and pictures of abused Iraqi prisoners in front of the US mission in Havana.

 The propaganda stunt was in retaliation for US diplomats? Christmas decoration which highlighted the plight of Cuban dissidents. The diplomats awoke yesterday to the sight of two huge billboards opposite the mission?s entrance emblazoned with a swastika, the word ?Fascists? in bold red letters, and some of the infamous photographs of American troops abusing Iraqis at Abu Ghraib prison, Baghdad.

 To drum home the point to commuters on one of Havana?s busier avenues, the word ?Fascists? had a giant ?Made in America? stamp on top. The display was opposite the missions Christmas decorations, which infuriated the authorities with a neon 75, a reference to the 75 dissidents imprisoned by Fidel Castro last year. Cuba complained about the decorations to James Cason, the chief American representative, and demanded that he take them down.

 The speaker of the Cuban parliament, Ricardo Alarcon, said the display, which includes a Father Christmas and white lights wrapped around palm trees, was ?rubbish? and a ?provocation?. He said Cason seemed ?desperate to create problems?.

 The state department defended the decorations and said there were no plans to take them down before the end of the Christmas holiday. ?It shows our solidarity with Cubans who struggle for democracy and freedom,? said the department spokesman, Richard Boucher.

 When the decorations went up Cuba gave warning of unspecified ?consequences?. Yesterday the threat became clear as America was given its latest reminder of how the Abu Ghraib scandal has delivered Washington its greatest public relations setback in years. Cason has refused to back down.

 Atlantis mystery

 Limassol (Cyprus), Nov. 15 (Reuters): A US researcher yesterday claimed he had found the lost civilisation of Atlantis in the watery deep off Cyprus ? adding his theory to a mystery which has baffled explorers for centuries.

 Robert Sarmast says a Mediterranean basin was flooded in a deluge around 9,000 BC which submerged a rectangular land mass he believes was Atlantis, lying 1.5 km beneath sea level between Cyprus and Syria. ?We have definitely found it,? said Sarmast, who led a team of explorers 80 km off the south-east coast of Cyprus earlier this month.

 Deep water sonar scanning had indicated man-made structures on a submerged hill, including a 3-km-long wall, a walled hill summit and deep trenches, he said. But further explorations were needed, he added.

 ?We cannot yet provide tangible proof in the form of bricks and mortar as the artefacts are still buried under several metres of sediment, but the circumstantial and other evidence is irrefutable,? he claimed.

 At a news conference in the port city of Limassol, Sarmast provided only animated simulations of the ?hill?. Whether and where Atlantis existed has captured imaginations for centuries.

 According to ancient Greek philosopher Plato, Atlantis was an island nation where an advanced civilisation developed some 11,500 years ago. Theories abound as to why it disappeared, from Atlantis being hit by a cataclysmic natural disaster to Greek mythology which describes the civilisation as being so corrupted by greed and power that it was destroyed by God.

 Sick shock 

 London (Reuters): A British house-buyer 

 got more than they bargained for after the discovery of 

 a badly decomposed body in an upstairs bedroom of their 

 new home, the Daily Telegraph said on Monday. The 

 newspaper said the skeletal remains may have been in the 

 ?98,000 derelict house in Birmingham, central England, for 

 at least two years and had escaped detection despite complaints 

 from neighbours about a bad smell. The odour was blamed 

 on rubbish, including dead pigeons. 

 Rat ruckus

 Beijing (AFP): A China Eastern Airlines 

 passenger jet flying a daily route between Shanghai and 

 Singapore was grounded for three days as crews tried to 

 locate and exterminate a stowaway rat. It was spotted by 

 passengers on a flight to Singapore on the evening of November 

 10, but after a search the intruder was not found. It took 

 ground crews 36 mouse traps to capture the unwanted guest.

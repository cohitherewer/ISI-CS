 Palestine militants seek powers

 Gaza, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Palestinian militants pressed Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie today to assign them decision-making powers in a temporary unified leadership they say should be created if critically ill President Yasser Arafat dies.

 Militant leaders, who are seen as political rivals to the governing Palestinian Authority, said Qurie had ?agreed in principle? to their demand at a meeting in Gaza, but there was no confirmation from the prime minister himself. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the body they were seeking would ?guarantee the participation of all factions in formulating the national Palestinian decision,? adding that Qurie had promised to ?look into (how) to implement? the idea.

 Qurie, regarded as a moderate who wants peace talks with Israel, said: ?We are talking about unity in all forms and aspects.? The talks, which included 14 political and militant groups, came amid growing lawlessness in the West Bank and Gaza. Many Palestinians fear a political vacuum could emerge should Arafat, who is being treated in a hospital in France, die.

 Militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, whose stock has risen among Palestinians during four years of clashes with Israeli forces, have long pushed for security and policy-making powers in the government.

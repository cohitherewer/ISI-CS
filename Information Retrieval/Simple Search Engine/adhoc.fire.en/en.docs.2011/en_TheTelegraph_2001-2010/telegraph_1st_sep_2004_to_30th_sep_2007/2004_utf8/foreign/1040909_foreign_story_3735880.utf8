 Mimicking idols, UK girls use make-up

 London, Sept. 8 (Reuters): Even as young as seven, British girls are using make-up, mimicking pop idols and parents in a pitch for early adulthood, according to a consumer intelligence group.

 More than three in five of seven-to-10-year-olds questioned by Mintel said they wear lipstick and nearly as many use perfume, it said in a survey. 

 That girls so young should be slapping on make-up will come as no surprise to many parents but the survey results have worried family welfare groups. 

 ?Long before girls become teenagers, they use a wide selection of cosmetics as well as other skincare products and toiletries,? said Mintel analyst Claire Hatcher.

 ?Their interest in these products is fuelled by teen magazines and by swapping ideas and recommendations with their peer group and, of course, watching what their mothers use.? 

 Mintel quizzed 5,856 youths aged seven to 19, finding that by the time girls reach 14, around 90 per cent regularly reach for eyeshadow, mascara and lipstick.

 ?Cosmetic manufacturers must be ever mindful of the fine line they tread between encouraging children to look and behave like adults and promoting their products as being good, clean fun,? added Hatcher. 

 Donal McCabe, spokesman for UK health and beauty retailer Boots chemists said the survey came as no surprise.

 ?History has always shown that girls of that age have aspired to look older, to be like their teenage sisters or their mothers,? he added.

 He said Boots aimed its Glitter Babes range at that age bracket, using childish colours and innocuous product names. 

 ?You would not get something like ?Luscious Lips??. Nicola Watson of the Family Matters Institute, a Christian charity which promotes family life, said she was uncomfortable with such young girls being sold beauty products.

 ?Make-up traditionally is about attracting a mate is it not?? she asked, adding parents should not be afraid to guide their childrens choices. ?We know that teenagers are under tremendous pressure to be physically attractive. We surely don?t want to contaminate children who are even younger with that value?? Mintel said.

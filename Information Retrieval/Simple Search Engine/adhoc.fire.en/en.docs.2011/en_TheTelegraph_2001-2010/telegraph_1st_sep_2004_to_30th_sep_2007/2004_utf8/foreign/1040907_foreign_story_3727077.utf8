 Pak army to get new headquarters

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Pervez Musharraf

Islamabad, Sept. 6: Pakistan President Pervez 

Musharraf today set in motion the relocation of the Pakistan army headquarters 

with the ground-breaking ceremony of the new General Headquarters (GHQ) complex.

 The GHQ is presently located in the garrison town of Rawalpindi. 

 The idea to relocate the headquarters of the three services was conceived in the early Seventies with the establishment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) under an executive order by the then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

The headquarters of the navy and the air force have 

already shifted to Islamabad from Karachi and Rawalpindi. The navy had been given 

priority in the relocation as it had to shift from Karachi followed by the air 

force that had to shift from Peshawar to Rawalpindi.

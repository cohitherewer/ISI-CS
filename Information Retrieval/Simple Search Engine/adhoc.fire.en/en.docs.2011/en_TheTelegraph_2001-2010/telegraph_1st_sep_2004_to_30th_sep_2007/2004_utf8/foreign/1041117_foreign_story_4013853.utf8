 Cut off aid: Maoists

 Kathmandu, Nov. 16 (Reuters): Maoist rebels fighting to set up a communist republic in Nepal have urged foreign donors to cut off support to the impoverished nation where 12 people, mostly soldiers or policemen, died in rebel violence today.

 Officials said at least five soldiers were killed when rebels ambushed an army truck in Dhading, 80 km west of Kathmandu. Television channel Nepal 1 broadcast scenes of soldiers lying inert on a deserted highway after the attack, an army truck in flames and heavily-armed guerrillas marching on the blood-stained road.

 Further west, six policemen or soldiers and a rebel were killed in a firefight sparked by rebels who fired on a patrol in their stronghold of Kailali, 665 km west of Kathmandu.

 ?The Maoists must have (also) suffered heavy losses because they carried their dead or wounded comrades in two bullock carts,? an army officer said, but he did not give figures. Yesterday, Maoist leader Prachanda renewed a demand for third-party mediation to end the conflict.

 He said in a statement the rebels would only participate in peace talks mediated by a third party ? an option that the government has rejected. ?We appeal to the international community, who are on the side of the people, to help Nepali people?s aspirations for peace by stopping all financial, political and diplomatic support to the old feudal regime,? Prachanda said.

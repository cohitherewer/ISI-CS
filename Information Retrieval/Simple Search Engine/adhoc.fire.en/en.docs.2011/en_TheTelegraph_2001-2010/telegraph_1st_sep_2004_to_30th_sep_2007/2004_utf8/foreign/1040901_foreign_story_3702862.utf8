 Naughty noise

 Berlin, Aug. 31 (Reuters): A pair of young lovers so annoyed their neighbours with a noisy sex session that police had to go and ask them to lower the volume, police said today.

 Officers in the western city of Essen interrupted the couple shortly after midnight after neighbours, listening to the sounds through an open window, called to complain.

 Gradually more and more neighbours gathered in front of the house to investigate the noise, the police said. The embarrassed couple were asked to close the window and continue at a lower volume, he said. 

 Nude feud

 Madrid (Reuters): Naked people ride the escalator 

 and lie down in the park. Two young women pose naked on 

 the steps of a famous monument. The pamphlet makes Barcelona 

 look like a haven for nudists. Two thousand such pamphlets 

 were handed out in recent days by nudists wearing only a 

 smile. But publicity from the pamphlets, produced with government 

 aid, forced the mayor on Monday to come out and say the 

 city did not encourage people to go nude in the street. 

 If someone is walking the streets naked, the police will 

 invite him to get dressed, a city spokesman said on Tuesday. 

 Barcelonas government said it respected nudists rights.

 William ready to do battle for Britain

 JONATHAN PETRE

 Prince William

 London, Nov. 20: Prince William said yesterday that he would want to go into battle alongside his men if he joined the army, and would resist any attempts to ?wrap him in cotton wool?.

 The prince has yet to decide what he will do when he leaves St Andrews University in about six months, but he strongly hinted that he might follow his brother Prince Harry to Sandhurst.

 In a wide-ranging interview about his time as a student and his hopes for the future, the 22-year-old prince said that the military academy would be ?a great place to learn how to lead and earn respect?. But he joked that he was seeing how Prince Harry enjoyed it first. ?That?s why I put my brother in ? as a guinea pig.?

 He said that if he opted for a military career he would pursue it wholeheartedly and would not want to be treated differently from his fellow soldiers.

 Acknowledging that there would be concerns if the second-in-line to the throne found himself in the line of fire, the prince said: ?That obviously is another problem...talks will happen before I went anywhere. But the last thing I want to do is to be mollycoddled or wrapped up in cotton wool because if I was to join the army I?d want to go where my men went and I?d want to do what they did.?

 ?I would not want to be kept back for being precious or whatever, that?s the last thing I?d want. It?s the most humiliating thing and it would be something I?d find very awkward to live with, being told I couldn?t go out there when these guys have got to go out there and do a bad job.?

 The prince spoke of his pride in being British when he took part in the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph for the first time a week ago. 

 ?I just thought, what with the Iraq war and troops being abroad and particularly the Black Watch going through a very tough time, I thought it was the right time for me to make an entrance and be there for the youth and make a point that the young haven?t forgotten and still very much appreciate what?s been done for everyone.

 ?The army is obviously a lot more in the spotlight at the moment. The Remembrance service really does bring it home when you?re there and there?s actually a war going on somewhere at the time and the guys are fighting their hearts out.?

 He indicated that he was not intending to plunge into a lifetime of royal engagements too soon after university. 

 He said that his father, the Prince of Wales, had hinted that he should do more, but ?I?m very much the person who doesn?t want to rush into anything without really thinking it through. ?I don?t shy away from doing particular events but I do like to go to the ones that I really feel passionately about.?

 He also said he was keen to help the homeless and AIDS charities in Africa, causes with which his mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, was closely linked.

 War of the wives in France

 Bernadette Chirac 

 (Top) and Cecilia Sarkozy: Claws out 

 Paris, Sept. 26: All of France knows that there is little love lost between President Jacques Chirac and the pretender to the Elysee, Nicolas Sarkozy. Now it has emerged that relations between their wives, Bernadette Chirac and Cecilia Sarkozy, are equally frosty.

 While the French leader fears that the dynamic ?Super Sarko? is trying to push him out of office, his wife is furious that her rival, a glamorous former model, is nudging her off the front pages.

 On Friday, Sarkozy, 45, made a much-publicised television appearance on a late-night talk show. After a coveted appearance on the cover of Paris Match, last week she won a poll in another magazine, Questions de Femmes, to discover which woman in power French women relate to ? beating 71-year-old Chirac, who trailed in third place, and several top female politicians. In a six-page interview with the magazine she boasted of her own, and her husband?s, ambition.

 An aristocratic grande dame, Chirac was said to be in a ?bad mood? after discovering Sarkozy?s picture all over the city?s news kiosks under the headline, ?A woman of today?, Le Parisien newspaper reported.

 ?On the Right, Bernadette was the star, but today ?Berniemania? seems to have gone out of fashion,? it declared. One newspaper?s recent approach to Chirac was apparently rebuffed with a curt: ?I thought you were only interested in the Sarkozys.?

 The French are fascinated by Nicolas Sarkozy, 49, the son of Hungarian immigrants, and captivated by his half-Spanish wife, the granddaughter of a classical composer who abandoned her own musical aspirations to study law. On official visits, Sarkozy is rarely photographed without her. She is said to manage every aspect of his public life, including his diary, clothes and what he eats. This has led to some of her husband?s political aides nicknaming her ?the Control Tower? and claiming she is ?too tall, too cold, too beautiful and too bossy?.

 Cecilia met Nicolas when she was married to her first husband and he was mayor of the wealthy Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine. ?One of the first things he said to me was: ?I will climb the steps of the Assemblee Nationale with you?,? she said.

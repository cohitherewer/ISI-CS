 Iran bid to overhaul economy

 Tehran, Oct. 2 (Reuters): Iran today overturned a key plank of the constitution to allow large-scale privatisations in a bid to overhaul the lumbering economy, over which many hardline parliamentarians have been trying to maintain state dominance.

 The Expediency Council, Iran?s top legislative arbitration body, gave the green light to privatisations in the downstream oil and gas sectors, mines, banking, insurance, telecommunications, railways, roads, airlines and shipping. 

 ?In order to realise economic growth and development... investment, ownership and management of these fields by private, cooperative and public sectors are permitted,? a statement faxed to Reuters by the Expediency Council said.

 Article 44 of Iran?s constitution, written after the 1979 Islamic revolution decreed the core infrastucture must remain in the hands of the state.

 The Expediency Council made no reference to radio and television which are catalogued in the constitution along with the sectors now earmarked for sale.

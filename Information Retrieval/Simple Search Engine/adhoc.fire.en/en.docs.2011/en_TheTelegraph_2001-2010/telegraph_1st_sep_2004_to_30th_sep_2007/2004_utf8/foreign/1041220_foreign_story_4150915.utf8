 Meteor shock for Jakarta

 Jakarta, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Several loud blasts believed to be caused by a meteor shower echoed across the Indonesian capital Jakarta and nearby towns early today, startling residents who reported seeing fly ing objects in the sky.

 Police said they had found no evidence that the blasts were caused by bomb attacks. An official from the Indonesian space centre LAPAN told the official Antara news agency the explosions were likely to have been caused by a meteor shower.

 ?It?s suspected that a fireball originating from a big meteor entered the earth?s atmosphere ... This created the explosion,? said LAPAN space expert Thomas Djamaluddin.

 Police, on high alert after warnings from Western governments of possible terror attacks over the Christmas and New Year period, said they were investigating the blasts.

 Residents heard them around 7.30 am in Jakarta, the satellite city of Tangerang, and Serang in West Java province. ?The police have searched throughout the regency and we found nothing to indicate a bomb or meteor,? said one officer on duty in Tangerang.

 Indonesian air force spokesman Sagom Tambun said there had been no radar readings indicating a meteor. One caller to El Shinta radio from Bogor, just south of Jakarta, reported seeing a large object hit the earth in the distance.

 Western governments, especially Australia, have warned that an international hotel could be targeted for attack, possibly one of the three Hiltons in the world?s most populous Muslim nation.

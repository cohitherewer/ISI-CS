 21 Maoists killed in clash

Kathmandu, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Nepali troops 

killed at least 21 Maoist rebels and lost 13 soldiers in overnight gunbattles 

across the Himalayan kingdom, officials said today.

 An army official said at least 16 rebels and 10 soldiers were killed in a clash that erupted after more than 500 guerrillas fired from forested hills on a security patrol at Pandaun, 665 km west of Kathmandu, igniting the six-hour battle.

 ?We have recovered 16 bodies of Maoist rebels and we have lost 10 of our men,? army Colonel Ram Sharam Karki said. He said many more guerrillas might have been killed. At least 18 soldiers were also wounded in the clash. There was no immediate comment from the rebel side on the fighting, which started last evening.

 ?They were in columns like ants when they opened fire on our search mission,? Karki said. ?Soldiers still in the area have seen more bodies of the rebels. We have not collected other bodies yet.?

 It was the single bloodiest clash since a temporary truce between the Maoists and the government ended last month.

 Pandaun in Kailali district in far western Nepal is a stronghold of Maoist rebels who have been fighting since 1996 to establish a one-party communist republic in place of the constitutional monarchy in the world?s only Hindu kingdom. Three soldiers and five rebels died in separate clashes elsewhere, another official said.

 Last week rebels killed 20 soldiers or policemen in separate attacks and two powerful bomb blasts at government buildings in Kathmandu, blamed on the guerrillas, wounded 40 people.

 The Maoist rebels walked out of peace talks in August last year amid a row over the future of the monarchy.

 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has repeatedly called on the rebels to restart negotiations but the Maoists have refused, saying the government is not serious about talks. The rebels insist on the mediation of the UN or an international human rights organisation in any discussions.

 ?The Maoists are putting pressure on the government to resume peace talks on their terms,? said Indrajit Rai, an expert on conflict resolution.

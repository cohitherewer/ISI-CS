 Saddam in cage, Iraq in rage

 Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein

Baghdad, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Much has changed 

in the year since a haggard Saddam Hussein was pulled from a hole in the ground 

and taken into custody by jubilant US troops. In some ways it has changed for 

the worse.

 President George W. Bush hailed the capture as a breakthrough at the time, saying he expected his arch foe to be tried, convicted and put to death ? adding that would be up to the Iraqi courts.

 ?In the history of Iraq, a dark and painful era is over,? Bush declared in a television address the day after the capture on December 13. ?A hopeful day has arrived. All Iraqis can now come together and reject violence and build a new Iraq.?

 But twice as many US soldiers were killed by insurgents in the seven months after Saddam?s capture than in the seven months before, and thousands of Iraqis have died. There are growing fears elections set for January 30 could be derailed by the mayhem. 

 In the capital, hardly a day has gone by without a guerrilla attack. Some areas, including central Haifa Street, are insurgent strongholds.

 And Bush?s hoped-for trial of Saddam appears no nearer to happening, despite repeated pledges from Iraqi officials.

 Meanwhile, what has become of Saddam? Iraqi officials said they thought he could be convicted and even executed by July. Saddam did appear in court that month and was informed of the general charges against him. 

 But since then little progress appears to have been made. The head of the special tribunal set up to try him, Salem Chalabi, has been replaced. Investigators are only beginning to sift through the evidence. Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said in August he wanted proceedings speeded up and said trials against Saddam and his senior henchmen should begin by the end of the year.

 Officials at the special tribunal could not be reached for comment, but a US embassy official said he would be urging Iraqi authorities to prepare a statement for the anniversary of Saddam?s capture. It has been a long year.

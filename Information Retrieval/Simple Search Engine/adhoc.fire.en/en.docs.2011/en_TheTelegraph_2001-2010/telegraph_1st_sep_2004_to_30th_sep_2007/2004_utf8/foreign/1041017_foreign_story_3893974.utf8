 Dog clemency

 London, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Dog-lovers in Britain celebrated today after a judge granted clemency to Dino, a German Shepherd sentenced to death for biting, in a case that had gone as far as the European Court of Human Rights.

 Dino, a seven-year-old German Shepherd, got into legal hot water when he bit the hand of a woman who tried to intervene in his fight with her dog in January 2001. He faced a destruction order, but his owners, who say the incident was out of character, spent tens of thousands of pounds on a protracted legal fight to save him. 

 The case went as far as Britain?s High Court and even the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg where the dog?s owner, Bryan Lamont, argued his rights had been compromised by an unclear law and a disproportionate sentence.

 Gardez (Afghanistan), Sept. 

 16 (Reuters): Afghan President Hamid Karzai escaped 

 an assassination bid today when a rocket was fired at his 

 US military helicopter as it was landing in the southeastern 

 town of Gardez.

 The President?s campaign trip for the October 9 presidential elections, his first outside Kabul, was immediately aborted and he was flown back to Kabul, the US military and Afghan officials said. Witnesses said the rocket flew over Karzai?s helicopter and a crowd of about 400 supporters gathered to meet him at a school as he was about to touch down. 

 ?A rocket was fired at President Karzai as his helicopter was landing,? said a US military spokesman.

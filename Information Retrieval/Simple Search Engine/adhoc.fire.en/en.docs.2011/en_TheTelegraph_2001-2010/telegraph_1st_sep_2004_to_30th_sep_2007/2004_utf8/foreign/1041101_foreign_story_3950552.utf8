 Lid off gene therapy myth

 ROBERT MATTHEWS

 London, Oct. 31: The ?biotech revolution?, which has been acclaimed by scientists as the path to miracle cures, has not delivered genuine improvements, according to an official study published this week.

 Among the scientific breakthroughs attributed to biotechnology ? which is based on the analysis of the behaviour of human genes and living cells ? are the birth of Dolly, the cloned sheep, and advances in the search for cures for genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis.

 Another was the completion of the first draft of the map of the human genome, the complete genetic blueprint of humans, which was described by British Prime Minister Tony Blair as ?a revolution in medical science whose implications far surpass even the discovery of antibiotics?.

 A study of the impact of biotechnology on medical treatments, concludes, however, that the claims surrounding gene therapy have been wildly exaggerated and that it is an expensive myth.

 It has found that investment has, in fact, produced only a handful of useful drugs over the past 20 years, and despite a 10-fold increase in research spending worldwide, the total number of new drugs has remained virtually unchanged.

 The study, to be published in the journal Trends in Biotechnology this week, adds that the objective evidence ?provides no support? for the idea of a biotechnology revolution. It also warns of a ?substantial mismatch between the real world and the unrealistic expectations of policy-makers?.

 Paul Nightingale of the University of Sussex, the leading author of the study that was funded by the British government?s economic and social research council, said the outcome is likely to be far less impressive than the rhetoric of advocates of biotechnology suggest.

 Nightingale claimed that only 15 worthwhile drugs had emerged from biotechnology research over the past quarter-century, while, overall, there had actually been a reduction in the numbers of new drugs reaching the market.

 Nightingale said that his findings on biotechnology were unlikely to be well-received. ?We?ve had people screaming at us, but we have the figures,? he added.

 The findings support the scepticism of some leading scientists about the most spectacular ?breakthroughs? in recent years.

 Dolly the sheep, the world?s first cloned animal, was supposed to be the first step toward developing pharmaceuticals using farm animals. Yet the cloning process has proved extremely difficult, while Dolly died prematurely.

 The much-vaunted technique of gene therapy has also yet to cure a single person of any major genetic disorder. To date, only a handful of children with an extremely rare immune disorder, known as X-SCID, have been successfully treated. The trials have since been halted following the discovery that two of the children had developed leukaemia as a direct result of the therapy.

 Richard Ley, a spokesperson for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, conceded that inflated claims had been made in the early days of biotechnology research. He said, however, that the research investment was now beginning to pay off, with new therapies for illnesses such as chronic myeloid leukaemia. ?The point is that it takes so long for new medicines to be developed ? around 10 to 12 years ? and the human genome was completed only four or five years ago. It really is new science in that sense,? he said.

 Aisling Burnand, the chief executive of the BioIndustry Association, said: ?People have become more cautious, but advances have to come through in order to treat diseases like Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s Disease.?

 Russia, US clash on Ukraine future

 Sofia, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Russia and the US today clashed over efforts to win influence in Ukraine and other former Soviet republics, with Moscow warning the West against interference and Washington rejecting the charge.

 Disagreements over the election monitoring role of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) ? which alleged fraud in Ukraine?s November 21 presidential poll ? prevented the 55-nation group, meeting in Sofia, from agreeing on a communique.

 The disputes laid bare the tension between East and West which persists 13 years after the Soviet Union?s collapse gave birth to a host of countries that continue to be the objects of a struggle between Russia and the US. 

 The most vivid disagreement is over Ukraine and its disputed presidential poll that pitted pro-Moscow Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich against West-leaning Viktor Yushchenko.

 Yanukovich was initially declared the winner but Ukraine?s highest court ruled the poll was rigged and ordered a re-run on December 26. 

 The poll has sparked two weeks of street protests and inconclusive negotiations among Ukrainian politicians on how to hold a fresh vote that will not be tainted by fraud.

 Without mentioning Ukraine by name, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov suggested the OSCE was using one standard of election monitoring for the former Soviet republics and another for its other members, including the US.

 ?We must avoid the ever-more deleterious practice of double standards in the evaluation of electoral processes. We must not allow the OSCE monitoring to be turned into a political instrument,? Lavrov told the OSCE gathering through an interpreter.

 ?In the absence of any objective criteria, monitoring of election process not only loses its meaning but becomes an instrument for political manipulation and a factor for destabilising in a whole number of instances,? he added.

 Marathon man tears

 TOM COGHLAN 

 Kabul, Dec. 13: An American 

 soldier won Afghanistan?s first marathon yesterday, coping 

 with the country?s thin mountain air for three hours before 

 bursting into tears at the finish as he remembered four 

 comrades killed in recent fighting.

 ?I just thought about those four guys when I crossed, that they won?t be going home with us, and it kind of hit me,? said Lieutenant Mike Baskin, from Santiago, California. The marathon was held at Firebase Ripley, a remote US forward operations camp in the lawless central province of Uruzgan. A total of 186 soldiers and a handful of civilian contractors entered, with some flown in from other units around the country.

 Two US air force jets thundered low over the base as the runners lined up for the start. As well as an uneven dirt-track course and thin air at 4,500 feet above sea level, they had to contend with the possibility of Taliban attack.

 The Afghan Olympic Committee confirmed that it was the first marathon in the country?s history.

 Plastic palm trees were put up along the course to conceal gun pits and remind the Hawaii-based 5th US Infantry Regiment, which garrisons Firebase Ripley, of home.

 However, it was the cost of their deployment to Afghanistan that dominated the thoughts of the winner as he crossed the finishing line to cheers and handshakes after five circuits of the base. Given the conditions, his time of 3hours, 12 minutes, 15 seconds, was impressive.

 Prison abuse

 An international rights group said it knows of more prisoners dying in US military custody in Afghanistan, and Washington?s failure to hold anyone accountable had created a culture of impunity.

 ?It?s time for the US to come clean about crimes committed by US forces in Afghanistan,? Brad Adams, Asia Division director for Human Rights Watch, said today.

 In an open letter to US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Human Rights Watch revealed two new cases of deaths in custody and demanded an investigation into a third that took place three months ago. 

 The two new cases uncovered involved 

 the alleged killing of an Afghan army soldier mistakenly 

 arrested with seven others in March last year, and the alleged 

 murder of another detainee in 2002, HRW said.

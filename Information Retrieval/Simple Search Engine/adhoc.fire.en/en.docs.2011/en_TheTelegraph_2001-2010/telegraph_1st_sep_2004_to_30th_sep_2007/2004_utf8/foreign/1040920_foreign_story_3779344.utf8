 Spartan Saddam stay

 JOHN F. BURNS

 Saddam Hussein 

 Baghdad, Sept. 19: Nine 

 months after American troops pulled him dishevelled and 

 disoriented from an underground bunker near his hometown, 

 Tikrit, Saddam Hussein is living in an air-conditioned 10-by-13 

 foot cell on the grounds of one of his former palaces outside 

 Baghdad, tending plants, proclaiming himself Iraq?s lawful 

 ruler, and reading the Quran and books about past Arab glory.

 American and Iraqi officials who 

 have visited the former Iraqi leader say he wears plastic 

 sandals and an Arab dishdasha robe, eats American 

 soldiers? ready-to-eat meals for breakfast, and is permitted 

 three hours? daily exercise in a courtyard outside his cell. 

 He has undergone hours of interrogation 

 by investigators preparing evidence for his trial on charges 

 of genocide and crimes against humanity. But he has insisted 

 that his position as Iraq?s President gave him legal authority 

 for all he did and that his victims were ?traitors?. 

 More than 80 other ?high-value 

 detainees? at the same prison ? including more than 40 who 

 were on the Pentagon?s ?pack of cards? of Iraq?s most-wanted 

 fugitives ? are kept away from Hussein, said Bakhtiar Amin, 

 the Iraqi human rights minister. Hussein has been in solitary 

 confinement since his capture on December 13, officials 

 said, because of a fear that he would try to rig evidence 

 or intimidate old associates in the prison. 

 In prison, Hussein has asked for 

 some vestiges of the pleasures he enjoyed when he moved 

 between dozens of palaces. ?This was a man whose regime 

 used a shredder to turn human bodies into ground beef,? 

 said Amin, the 46-year-old rights minister, who spent years 

 abroad as an exile chronicling the abuses of Hussein?s government 

 and petitioning foreign governments and rights organisations 

 to shun the Iraqi government.

 ?And now he sits there in his 

 cell and asks for muffins and cookies and cigars,? he said.

 For Hussein and his victims, a 

 trial in the new court building, which The New York Times 

 was asked not to identify for security reasons, will 

 have a special irony. Hussein, who favoured an architectural 

 style emphasising huge sandstone columns and portals, will 

 face a reckoning in one of the buildings he erected to glorify 

 his rule. In the dock, he will be a short walk away from 

 the Republican Palace beside the Tigris River, once his 

 main seat of power.

 The Iyad Allawi government believes 

 that the Iraqis, subjected to decades of terror, will begin 

 to recover only when they see the men responsible brought 

 to account. ?Without justice, I don?t see any possibility 

 of healing the wounds in this society,? Amin said.

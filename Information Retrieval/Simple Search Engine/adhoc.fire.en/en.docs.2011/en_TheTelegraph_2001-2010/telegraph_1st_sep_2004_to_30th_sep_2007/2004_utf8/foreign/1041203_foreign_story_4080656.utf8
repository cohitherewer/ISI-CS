 Texas pardon

 Houston, Dec. 2 (Reuters) - Texas governor. Rick Perry granted a rare stay of execution to a Houston woman just hours before she was scheduled to die last night by lethal injection for the 1987 murder of her husband and two children. The decision by Perry, a Republican, came one day after the state?s parole board voted to recommend Newton receive a four-month stay.

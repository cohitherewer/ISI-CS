 Letter ?bomb? on Rumsfeld

 Washington, Dec. 19 (Reuters): US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld did not personally sign his name on letters of condolence to families of troops killed in Iraq but instead had it done by a machine, an action lawmakers said today showed insensitivity and was inappropriate for leadership during war.

 Rumsfeld acknowledged that he had not signed the letters to family members of more than 1,000 US troops killed in action and in a statement said he would now sign them in his own hand.

 ?This issue of the secretary of defence not personally signing the letters is just astounding to me and it does reflect how out of touch they are and how dismissive they are,? Republican Senator Chuck Hagel said on CBS? Face the Nation. Hagel noted that the families of the troops killed in Iraq have received letters signed by Bush.

 ?My goodness, that is the least we can expect the secretary of defence ... If the President can find the time to do that why can?t the secretary of defence?? said Hagel.

 Redgraves launch party

 London, Nov. 18 (Reuters): Britain?s most famous acting dynasty is launching a new party to promote the human rights it says have been abused in the war on terror, the latest foray by the entertainment world into post-Iraq war politics.

 Corin and Vanessa Redgrave, renowned for their Left-wing activism as well as stage and film performances, will inaugurate the Peace and Progress Party in London on November 27.

 The party?s manifesto includes calling for the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq and the return of British terror suspects held at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

 The famous siblings join a lengthening list of film stars and musicians who want to use their art and celebrity clout to have a say about the way the world has changed since September 11.

 Man sacked for beard size

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 14: A young 

 Muslim railway worker who claims he was sacked after a row 

 over the length of his beard has brought what is believed 

 to be the first case against an employer under new laws 

 which ban discrimination on religious grounds.

 Unfair treatment on grounds of race and sex have long been illegal but Tony Blair?s government extended legislation to cover religious discrimination last year, probably in an attempt to placate Britain?s 1.6 million Muslim population which has felt vulnerable in the wake of the Iraq war. For many years, Muslims have campaigned for legislation to ban religious discrimination but successive governments have stood out against this, partly because of the difficulty in finding a legal distinction between mainstream religions and ?cults?. The rarely used law on blasphemy covered only Christianity.

 An employment tribunal in London is now being told that Mohsin Mohmed, 23, a customer services assistant, was sacked from his job with Virgin West Coast Trains after he refused to cut his beard. He was asked repeatedly to trim his beard by senior Virgin staff at Euston, a mainline London station. When Mohmed, from Ilford, Essex, refused to serve alcoholic drinks to customers in the first-class lounge, a manager suggested he should wear gloves.

 Mohmed told the hearing he reduced his beard to ?one fist length? ? about four inches ? but at the end of a six-month probationary period he was sacked anyway in February this year. He has now brought a claim of racial and religious discrimination and harassment against Virgin West Coast Trains. He has been growing his beard since he was 18, Mohmed told the tribunal. ?According to my teachings a male from the Islamic faith cannot trim his beard shorter than a fist length,? he said.

 Muslims who cut it any shorter were ?in reality sinning?, he commented. At his job interview last summer, he was asked whether he would halve the length of his beard, which was eight inches at the time, and he said he agreed to do so. He claims that when he went to work at Euston, an assistant station manager, Mark Loveland, advised him he would not be able to wear his hat. 

 His task was to man an information desk on the concourse at Euston. On behalf of his employers, Jennifer Eady, representing West Coast Trains, said team leaders and other managers had found Mohmed lacking in enthusiasm and that one probation report had described him as ?a little bolshy? and having a ?bad boy attitude?.

 The hearing also heard evidence from assistant station manager David Adams who denied at one meeting with Mohmed giving him the ultimatum to choose between his beard or his job. He told the tribunal he asked Mohmed ?what he would do if he had a choice between shaving his beard or keeping his job?.

 ?I would like to make clear at this point when I used the word ?shave? with Mo (Mohmed), I did not mean or state shave off. I simply meant to trim off,? explained.

 Adams said: ?This is what I meant by the expression ?shave your beard?, this is what I believe Mo understood. I did not give Mo the instruction to shave off his beard below one fist length or threaten that if he did not, he would lose his job.?

 He added for him to have suggested Mohmed should be completely clean-shaven was ?nonsense?. The hearing continues. The case could prove to be an important one in deciding just how far Muslims can go in retaining their orthodoxy in the work place. No one thinks anything of Sikhs wearing turbans today but in the 1960s, there was banned on the buses for conductors. While many young Muslim women have started wearing the hejab to work, there has been no pressure from Muslim men to be allowed to grow long beards. The boss of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, cannot be against beards as such ? he has one of the most famous ones in Britain.

 Passion for Gibson

 Los Angeles, Dec. 3 (Reuters): A drifter who repeatedly demanded to pray with Passion of Christ movie director Mel Gibson was ordered to stand trial on charges of stalking.

 Zack Sinclair, 34, was arrested in October after arriving unannounced at Gibson?s Malibu home saying he wanted to pray with him, and turning up at a chapel where Gibson, a devout Catholic, attends mass on Sundays.

 court papers, Gibson said the man had also sent him numerous letters insisting they should pray together. Gibson said he found the letters ?alarming, harassing and annoying?. The Passion of the Christ, Gibson?s graphic account of the last hours of Jesus, provoked much controversy in the US but became a box office success and has grossed over $600 million in worldwide ticket sales.

 Sinclair, a homeless man who is now in jail, was ordered to stand trial by a Los Angeles area judge.

 Santa snoop

 London (Reuters): A Father Christmas 

 will have a webcam in his grotto to overcome parents? concerns 

 after several high-profile paedophile cases in Britain in 

 the past few years. The St Elli shopping centre in Llanelli, 

 south Wales, said children taking part in the Christmas 

 ritual of telling Santa their gift wishes would also sit 

 beside him rather than on his knee. ?It?s a sad sign of 

 the times,? St Elli manager Gilmour Jones said in The 

 Guardian newspaper. ?But I?m afraid that it was either 

 this or not having Santa?s grotto at all.?

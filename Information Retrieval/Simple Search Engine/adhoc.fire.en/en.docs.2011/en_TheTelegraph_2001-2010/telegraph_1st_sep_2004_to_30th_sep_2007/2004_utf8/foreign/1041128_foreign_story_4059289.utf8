 America fails

 New York, Nov. 27 (Reuters): America may dominate the world in sports and culture but in one arena where size doesn?t matter, the ?Geography Olympics,? the US was 88th behind minnows such as Madagascar and the Marshall Islands.

 More than 46,000 Americans have taken part in this online geography competition started by a man with a mission: Roger Andersen, who quit his job as a fibre optic engineer two years ago when he realised most Americans have never heard of Nauru and don?t know Cameroon is in Africa.

 Working from his home in Georgia ? the US state, not the country ? he created a jigsaw puzzle with pieces shaped like the countries of the world and launched what he calls the ?world?s biggest ongoing geography puzzle? on the web.

 Players have 200 seconds to locate 10 randomly selected countries on a map of the world with the names blanked out. The site www.geographyolympics.com has attracted more than 300,000 players from 179 countries so far. National rankings fluctuate throughout the day. 

 Tasty room 

 Berlin (Reuters): German artists 

 have unveiled a ?Biedermeier?-style room made entirely of 

 chocolate and marzipan, complete with panelling, vases, 

 cutlery and pictures all fashioned from the confectionery. 

 The eight artists at a chocolate factory in the eastern 

 city of Halle took three months and used 800 kg of chocolate 

 and 200 kg of marzipan to complete their creation. ?The 

 room looks good enough to eat!? Halloren factory spokeswoman 

 said.

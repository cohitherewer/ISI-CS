 Tom, Clint on Mission Fiat

 Milan, Nov. 25 (Reuters): 

 Can a ?Top Gun? and a tight-lipped loner out of the Old 

 West help rescue the fortunes of Italian carmaker Fiat on 

 a ?Mission Impossible? to learn English?

 Fiat has indirectly enlisted Hollywood stars like Tom Cruise and Clint Eastwood to help lift the carmaker out of a slump by showing their films to improve the English of its workers.

 Part of the troubled Italian firm?s rescue plan is to become more international and in a new drive to boost employee language skills, it has started showing films in English during lunch. 

 Some of the upcoming films being shown to help improve the spoken English of workers at Fiat?s sprawling Mirafiori factory include: Blood Work, starring Eastwood and Top Gun, starring Cruise as the irrepressible fighter pilot ?Maverick?.

 But it remains to be seen whether British films on offer, like Notting Hill, starring Hugh Grant and A Fish Called Wanda, starring ex-Monty Python star John Cleese, will muddy the linguistic waters much as they do between practitioners of the Queen?s English and American English.

 Foreign films are dubbed in Italy, with the lack of on-screen English often blamed for Italians generally poor command of the language.

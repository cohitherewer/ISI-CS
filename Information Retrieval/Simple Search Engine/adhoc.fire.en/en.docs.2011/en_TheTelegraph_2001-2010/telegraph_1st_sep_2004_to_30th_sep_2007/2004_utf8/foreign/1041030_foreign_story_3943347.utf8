 Thai remorse over deaths

 Pattani (Thailand), Oct. 29 (Reuters): Bomb blasts rocked southern Thailand today as Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra told southern Muslim leaders the deaths of 85 protesters in military custody should have never happened.

 ?A wrong is a wrong. A mistake is a mistake which must be accepted,? said Thaksin.

 ?Please know that the government is sincere in its concern,? he told the group, in Bangkok to convey outrage in the mainly Muslim south at the deaths by suffocation of 78 men crammed into army trucks after a violent protest on Monday.

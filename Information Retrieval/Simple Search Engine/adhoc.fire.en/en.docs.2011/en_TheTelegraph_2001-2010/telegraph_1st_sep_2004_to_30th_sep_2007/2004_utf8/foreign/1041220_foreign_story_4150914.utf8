 Myanmar in spy cell shake-up

 Yangon, Dec. 19 (AP): The deputy chief and several officers of Myanmar?s intelligence service have been ordered to retire in a continuing shake-up of the counry?s spy agency, a former military intelligence officer and a diplomat said today.

 Their exits come nearly two months after the sacking of Gen. Khin Nyunt, who headed military intelligence and served as Prime Minister. Internal rivalries are believed by diplomats to have led to his ouster.

 The officials said Maj. Gen. Kyaw Win, 59, the deputy intelligence chief, and several other senior officers of the service were handed their retirement papers on Wednesday. Kyaw Win, a painter and photographer who foreigners found easy to approach, had served in the position since 1993. A number of enlisted men from his office were sent to infantry units.

 Analysts speculate that the junta, headed by Senior Gen. Than Shwe, may take an even harder line following Khin Nyunt?s ouster.

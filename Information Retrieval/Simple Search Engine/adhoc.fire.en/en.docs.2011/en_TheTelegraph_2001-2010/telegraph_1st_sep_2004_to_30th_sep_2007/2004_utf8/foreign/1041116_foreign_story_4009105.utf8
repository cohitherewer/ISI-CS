 UK trial with camera in court

 London, Nov. 15 (Reuters): Television cameras will film in an English court for the first time this week as the government considers whether broadcasting of trials should be allowed in the future.

 A pilot scheme begins in the Court of Appeal in the Royal Courts of Justice in London and ministers opened a consultation process today on whether it should be broadened to include trials in courts in England and Wales.

 The Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, who announced plans for the pilot in August, says there is a strong case for filming some trials such as criminal appeal cases, which often do not involve witnesses.

 Full criminal trials are regularly televised in the US but Falconer opposes allowing television cameras into criminal trials in the UK, saying he is concerned about witnesses.

 ?No change to make our courts more open and accessible should worsen or jeopardise ... the position of witnesses and victims,? he said. ?Cameras in the courtroom would be a big step. We have to make sure that any such step would benefit justice.?

 Cameras from five British broadcasting organisations will be allowed to film some appeal hearings and civil cases for the pilot scheme. TV reports compiled from the footage will be shown to judges and other interested parties, but not broadcast to the public.

 The government has said no decision will be made on television trials until it has assessed the results of the five-week pilot scheme.

 ?I know these are difficult and delicate issues,? Falconer said. ?I know broadcasters and others will press for change. But my responsibility is to consider the issues fully and carefully, focusing on the prime goal of justice being done. ?The only court proceedings currently televised are judgments of the Law Lords.

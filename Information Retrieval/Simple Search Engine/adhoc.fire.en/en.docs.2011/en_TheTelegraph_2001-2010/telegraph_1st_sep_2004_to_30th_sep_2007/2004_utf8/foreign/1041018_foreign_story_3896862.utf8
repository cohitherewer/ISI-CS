 Great Afghan toss-up

 SUJAN DUTTA

 There is this tale of a Pathan crossing the Khyber Pass from his village deep in the folds of the Hindukush?s lunarscape. Tired after days and nights on horseback, dodging hidden enemies and battling the elements, he reaches Peshawar one late evening and seeks shelter in a caravan serai run by another Pathan.

 The Pathan of Peshawar is like his brethren elsewhere, welcoming and hospitable, and the newly-arrived gent is much thankful to him for the warm nan, the goat milk, the kababs and the shelter. In the course of the night, the two get talking of home in Afghanistan and discover that centuries ago their families were intimate but then the great-grandfather of one felt betrayed in battle by the great-grandfather of the other. The two families are now sworn to revenge.

 But the Pathan of Peshawar is in a quandary. His culture will not allow him to be harsh with a guest who has sought his protection after dusk. So he tells the horserider that he has until daylight to quit.

 ?When the sun is up,? the Peshawari Pathan says, ?I will look for your horse first and then for you. If you are here, I will slay you. If you are not, I will hunt you down and kill you.?

 What happens next is as difficult to predict as any other Afghan story. In a country where temperaments are notoriously mercurial, passions run deep, and rivalries are more numerous than Kalashnikovs in central Asia, only the warlord will vouch with a certainty about anything.

 Taking on the warlord, in more ways than one, will be Hamid Karzai. The October 9 poll in Afghanistan, though marred by allegations of irregularities, is being touted by the US and the UN as a successful experiment.

 If Karzai wins straight ? that is, he gets more than 50 per cent of the vote ? he will be the strongest among the competing leaders.

 If not, he heads into a run-off, a second vote with his closest contestant who is likely to be his education minister, Yunus Qanooni.

 When the election process started rolling, Karzai, with solid Pashtun and US backing, was a sureshot winner but the last-minute entry of Qanooni, a Tajik, in the fray threatens to cut into his support base. To neutralise that, Karzai has chosen a Tajik as his running mate for the vice-presidency. By the time a runoff is conducted, the elections in the US will have been completed ? on November 2 ? and the democratic exercise in Afghanistan will be sold as a feather in Bush?s hat.

 As an old Afghan watcher put it: ?If Karzai wins straight, it is good for him but bad for democracy in Afghanistan. If there is a run-off and no clear winner, it is bad for Karzai but good for democracy in Afghanistan.?

 If Karzai wins in any case, two immediate changes of language in discussions on Afghanistan will take place. Karzai will no longer be described as interim President and the country?s official nomenclature will cease to be the Transitional Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

 Mollycoddled by the US though he might be, the elections will give Karzai a political legitimacy on the international stage. He will sit down immediately to name two Vice-Presidents and his council of ministers.

 Jostling for the positions has already begun. Qanooni himself, with the backing of defence minister Fahim Khan, could be a power figure in the government of Hamid Karzai. Deals will be struck, with Rashid Dostum, Fahim and other strongmen ? or warlords ? staking their claim.

 There are some who Karzai may choose to ignore at his peril and some whom he will choose to antagonise. The new Afghan security forces ? the Afghan National Army, the police and the militia ? will be used with increasing frequency against them if they do not decommission weapons.

 In the Bonn Agreement of 2001, that set the timeline for Afghanistan?s re-emergence as a country with legitimate power structures, all participants had pledged to withdraw military units from Kabul. That has not happened yet and Karzai will be persuasive on this.

 Karzai will also seek to go selectively after the private militia tied in with the interests of the narcotics trade ? Afghanistan is the largest producer and supplier of opium and its extracts.

 By December, the UN-Afghan Joint Electoral management Body will have to announce the limits of districts that will be the constituencies for the elections to the Parliament ? a building for which is likely to be constructed by India ? called the Wolesi Jirga (House of the People).

 The parliamentary elections are slated for April 2005. Karzai could float a new party to contest them. There are already 36 parties registered and Karzai is contesting for President as an Independent.

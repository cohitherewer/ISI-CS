 Dragged from a wedding party to the 

 middle of the sea, alone

 Hokseumawe (Indonesia), Dec. 

 29: Mulyana, a 24-year-old housewife, had just sat down 

 to a wedding party on Sunday morning when the tsunami struck. 

 She ran and held on to a coconut tree. But the water pulled 

 her away anyway, far out to sea. 

 ?I was alone in the middle of 

 the ocean,? she said from her hospital bed in this town 

 on the north-eastern coast of Aceh province, the area of 

 Indonesia hit hardest by the disaster. ?I was afraid of 

 being pulled all the way to India.? 

 Mulyana, who cannot swim, clung 

 to a coconut tree floating nearby. Four hours later a group 

 of fishermen found her as they were pulling bodies from 

 the water. 

 Each morning?s tide brings with 

 it the bodies of more victims who, like Mulyana, were washed 

 out to sea, but were not so lucky. 

 Mulyana is one of more than 200 

 survivors who have filled hospitals here, many with similarly 

 harrowing tales of how they survived a tempest that Indonesian 

 and international relief officials fear may have killed 

 more than 27,000 people in this country alone. 

 ?We?re seeing devastation and 

 death beyond belief,? Michael Elmquist, who leads the UN 

 assistance office in Indonesia, said in Jakarta. ?I?ve been 

 through many disasters around the world, but I?ve never 

 seen anything like this. ? 

 In Banda Aceh, the provincial 

 capital, reports are filtering in of thousands of bodies, 

 some lined up outside a city mosque. Others are being carried 

 away in army trucks. 

 The waves were reported to have 

 inundated one city hospital, drowning patients. Local television 

 stations broadcast images from Banda Aceh that showed a 

 city drenched with mud and debris, with bodies lying in 

 the street or wedged among the flotsam and jetsam. Where 

 the bodies have been lined up, anxious survivors peer under 

 makeshift shrouds in search of loved ones.

 With phone lines down, relatives 

 of Banda Aceh?s residents are still waiting for news. At 

 the airport in Medan, worried Acehnese crowded ticket booths, 

 trying to catch flights to the ruined city. Employees of 

 the national airline, Garuda Indonesia, said they were trying 

 to obtain larger aircraft to accommodate them.

 Lhokseumawe, about midway between 

 the Medan and Banda Aceh, looks like a city under siege. 

 Soldiers with assault rifles patrol the streets on foot 

 and in trucks and armoured vehicles. Across Aceh, because 

 of the civil unrest, army outposts dot the roads, and soldiers 

 with automatic rifles periodically stop travellers. 

 It was soldiers, for instance, 

 who found 45-year-old Kamaryah Hasan stuck atop a coconut 

 tree on Sunday afternoon in Banda Aceh, her leg broken. 

 Earlier, Kamaryah had travelled from her home in Lhokseumawe 

 to Banda Aceh on her way to make the Haj, the Muslim pilgrimage 

 to Mecca. She was preparing to fly to Saudi Arabia later 

 that day when the tsunami struck.

 ?It sounded like a jet plane,? 

 she said from her hospital bed here. When she found herself 

 perched at the top of the tree, she said, she used one hand 

 to hang on and the other to wave to rescuers.

 Traditionally, Indonesia, with 

 a proud nationalist streak, has not sought international 

 aid for disasters and has accepted it only when offered. 

 But this week Indonesian leaders requested aid on their 

 own for the first time in years, Elmquist said. 

 ?This time they?re the ones requesting 

 assistance,? he said. ?No one?s fighting it. It shows the 

 magnitude of the devastation.?

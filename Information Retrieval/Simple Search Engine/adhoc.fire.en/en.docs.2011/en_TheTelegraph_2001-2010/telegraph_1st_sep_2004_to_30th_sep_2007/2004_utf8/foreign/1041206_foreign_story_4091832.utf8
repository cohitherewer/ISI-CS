 Heavyweight holiday tells on seats

 RAJEEV SYAL AND ELIZABETH DAY

 London, Dec. 5: Dozens of seats on the Queen Mary II, the world?s biggest, newest and most luxurious cruise liner, are being broken under the weight of obese passengers. 

 The Daily Telegraph has learned that the French company which supplied the chairs, both fixed and free-standing, claims that it is repairing and replacing them as fast as possible, as they creak and buckle under larger holiday-makers. 

 The disclosure confirms the suspicions of many specialists that fat passengers prefer sea-going holidays to the cramped seating of air and train travel.

 A spokesperson for Alstom Chantiers, the French company that provided the cruise liner with all its fixtures and fittings, said that it was replacing items within the one-year guarantee, including a large number of chairs.

 ?There are some things that need to be changed or replaced,? he said. ?For instance, there are some problems with the chairs because some of our passengers are heavier than we imagined.? The spokesperson claimed that the problem seemed to be mainly obese American, rather than British, passengers. ?It?s not an English problem; it?s probably more American,? he said.

 The Queen Mary II, the tallest and longest ocean liner ever built, set sail from Southampton on her maiden voyage in January this year.

 She carries 2,620 passengers and 1,250 crew, and cost an estimated ? 500 million to build. At present the ship is in the Caribbean, but she is expected back in Britain in April next year.

 Most seating on the ship is free-standing, but some seats ? particularly around the walls of the bars ? is banquet-style. Both types are being repaired by the French company. 

 One former ship employee said last week that many of the broken seats were in the bar and restaurant areas. ?We do have many large passengers on the QM II,? he said. 

 ?Most of the passengers are American, and many of them are elderly. And we do have 10 restaurants on the ship, so if they are big when they get on, they tend to be bigger when they get off.?

 Ian Campbell, the chief of the National Obesity Forum, said that rising numbers of obese and overweight people wanted to go on cruise holidays to escape the embarrassment of more claustrophobic forms of transport. ?Air travel can be a real challenge if you are overweight,? he said. 

 ?Fitting into small seats, pulling the tray down so you can eat and knowing that you are going to be a problem for other passengers as you manoeuvre through small aisles, can be a real problem,? he said.

 ?I am not so surprised that passengers are breaking chairs. They have become heavier over the last generation and the seating is designed for a lighter person from the past.?

 Fat people have already been marginalised by air companies. Two years ago Southwest Airlines, an American company, announced a policy to charge overweight passengers for two tickets.

 Earlier this year, the Air Transport Users Council, which represents passengers in Britain, said that it was receiving ?a very heavy postbag? from lightweight passengers, who complained that they have to pay a premium on excess baggage when other passengers were taking more body weight on board.

 A spokesperson for Cunard, which owns the Queen Mary II, said that it could not quantify exactly how many seats had been broken by obese customers. He did acknowledge, however, that there was an repair scheme, on board the ship, to replace and repair chairs. The problem is likely to be tackled during next year?s refit. 

 ?We do get some large passengers, but we get people of all shapes and sizes,? he said.

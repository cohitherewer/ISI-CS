 Millions stolen in great bank robbery

 Belfast, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Raiders have stolen an estimated ?30 million from a bank in Northern Ireland, a source said today, in one of Britain?s biggest ever robberies.

 The yesterday afternoon heist came after families of two members of staff were held hostage, the source added. Speculation was rife that the raid could have been the work of Northern Ireland?s paramilitary gangs which remain heavily involved in crime despite observing ceasefires in the province?s long-running sectarian conflict.

 Police said they were investigating a major robbery from a cash centre at the headquarters of Northern Bank in central Belfast, but gave few details.

 ?Detectives are investigating the removal of a substantial amount of cash from a bank in the Belfast area,? said a spokeswoman at police headquarters in Belfast.

 She declined to comment on the hostage reports or on the amount of money taken.

 If confirmed at ?30 million, the raid would top the ?26 million taken in a 1983 raid on a Brinks-Mat vault at London?s Heathrow airport.

 Britain?s biggest-ever raid was a 1987 break-in at a Knightsbridge safe deposit centre in London when ?60 million was stolen.

 Northern Bank is the largest retail bank in Northern Ireland, with 95 branches in the British-ruled province.

 Earlier this month, Denmark?s Danske Bank agreed to buy Northern Bank and National Irish Bank from National Australia Bank for 10.4 billion Danish crowns ($1.87 billion).

 ?The theft is being investigated by the police in Northern Ireland and we cannot discuss details at this stage,? said a statement from NAB?s headquarters in Melbourne.

 ?However, initial indications are that affected staff are safe ? this is our number one priority.?

 A report from an independent ceasefire monitoring body last month said both Protestant and Catholic paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland were involved in crimes including extortion, smuggling and bank robbery. Paramilitaries have also been blamed for several other high profile robberies earlier this year, including cases which involved hostage taking.

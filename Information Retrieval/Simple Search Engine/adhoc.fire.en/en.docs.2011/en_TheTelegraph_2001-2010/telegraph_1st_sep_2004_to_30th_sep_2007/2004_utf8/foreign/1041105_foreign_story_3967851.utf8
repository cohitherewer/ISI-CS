 Axe on Oxford tutorials

 JOHN CLARE

 London, Nov. 4: Oxford tutorials ? the foundation of the university?s almost unique system of one-to-one teaching ? are to be cut by half for undergraduates studying English, dons decided yesterday.

 The change is seen as undermining a centuries-old practice that has helped make Oxford and Cambridge, which has a similar system, world-class universities. 

 It is expected to be introduced in 2006, coinciding with a rise in tuition fees to ?3,000 a year.

 Terry Hoad, Oxford?s director of undergraduate studies in English, said that tutors were exhausted, and their ?intolerable? teaching burden had to be reduced.

 ?There has been a remorseless rise in what is demanded of university teachers,? he said. ?It is in no one?s interest, the undergraduates included, for tutors to be worn down by their various duties.?

 Instead of eight one-hour tutorials a term, undergraduates reading English will have just four, supplemented by classes of eight students. 

 They will also write fewer essays. Hoad claimed that the changes would enhance rather than diminish the undergraduate experience.

 His theories appeared to be at odds with the university prospectus, which tells students: ?Oxford offers you a unique learning experience through the tutorial system, in which you are responsible for managing your own time to ensure the necessary work gets done.

 ?Through this method of teaching you will develop your ability to think independently, which provide you with one of the many transferable skills employers find attractive when recruiting Oxford graduates.?

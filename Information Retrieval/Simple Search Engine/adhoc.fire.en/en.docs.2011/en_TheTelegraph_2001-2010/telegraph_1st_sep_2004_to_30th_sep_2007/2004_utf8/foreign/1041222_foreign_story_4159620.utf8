 Ray of hope for Blunkett in visa ruling

 London, Dec. 21 (Reuters): A special inquiry found today that former British home secretary David Blunkett was linked to the fast-tracking of a visa for his ex-lover?s nanny, but did not establish the reason for his involvement.

 The finding left an opening for one of the country?s most popular politicians to recover after resigning last week in the scandal.

 Sir Alan Budd found that while Blunkett had intervened to help Kimberly Quinn?s Filipina nanny Leoncia Casalme get a UK residence visa more quickly, it was not clear whether he had intended to help his lover or use the case as an example to speed up procedures in general.

 ?I believe that I have been able to establish a chain of events linking Mr Blunkett to the change in the decision on Ms Casalme?s application for ILR (Indefinite Leave to Remain),? Budd said.

 ?I believe there are two broad possibilities: Mr Blunkett was seeking special help for Mrs Quinn?s nanny or he was raising the case as an example of the poor performance of the IND (Immigration and Naturalisation Directorate).

 ?I do not have direct evidence that allows me to chose between the two possibilties,? he added. His finding could allow Blunkett, 57, Britain?s highest-profile blind person and a key ally of Prime Minister Tony Blair, to return to front line politics after elections expected in May, despite the scandal.

 Blunkett had denied abusing his office by giving special help to the nanny to get a visa more quickly, as a favour for his married ex-lover. 

 The nanny had originally been told her application to stay in Britain would require special consideration that could take months.

 But after Blunkett?s office contacted the civil service she got the visa within a month ? 120 days faster than average, Budd found. Blunkett did not escape the day entirely unscathed.

 A separate inquiry by a parliamentary standards committee earlier found he had broken the rules by giving Quinn train tickets that are supposed only to be used by the spouses of parliamentarians for travel between London and their constituencies.

 Marines fear nothing but Dear John letters

 Near Falluja (Iraq), Nov. 24 (Reuters): US Marines thousands of miles from home in Iraq face ruthless insurgents, a debilitating desert climate and tasteless food. But they dread nothing more than opening the Dear John letter. 

 ?It?s so hard when your girlfriend sends you that letter and says goodbye. It just shatters all your childhood notions of romance,? said Corporal Samuel Shoemaker, 22, of Shelton, Washington.

 ?She wrote me a vague letter about our future but I had no doubt about what she meant. It?s the last thing I needed out here. I first met her in grade school. I don?t have the stamina to chase her anymore.? 

 Thousands of US Marines launched an offensive this month that crushed Arab Muslim militants and Saddam Hussein loyalists in Falluja, Iraq?s most rebellious city.

 But many say victory can?t ease heartbreak by letter or email. ?Man I cant believe it. I was engaged to a woman who I raised our child with for three years,? said an infantry Marine who asked not to be named.

 ?She wrote me a letter to ask whether we could put it on hold so she could have sex with another man. Then she asked me if I could accept her having sex with another woman if I reject the man.?

 Strict rules of conduct have not stopped Marines from seeking love on base. But it is not always easy and dating Iraqi women is prohibited.

 ?They hit on us all the time. It is really annoying and we have enough to worry about out here,? said Corporal Ann Gorecka, 23, of New York City as she and a woman comrade looked at compact discs at the base PX store.

 Some Marines do everything they can to avoid the Dear John letter, even if it means being lonely in a country gripped by suicide bombings and kidnappings.

 ?I planned for it all along by making sure I was single before I came to Iraq. That way it cant happen,? said Captain Oscar Marin, 28, of New York City. But Antonio Figueroa spread the risk. ?I have never been in love so I am safe. But I have about three girlfriends so that if one sends bad news that is fine with me,? said the 19-year-old native of Long Island, New York. Lance Corporal Joc Sims was not so lucky. His girlfriend ended it when he was still in boot camp.

 ?It just stinks when you get the letter. She was my best friend,? he said.

 A married officer who asked to remain anonymous said he would welcome a Dear John letter.

 ?That would be great. God I would be free.?

 To look at U.S. Marine operations around Falluja, it is a wonder anyone still has time for romance. Deafening artillery shells are fired. Mechanics are priming tanks for possible battle. Hundreds of houses are searched for weapons caches.

 Corporal Madison Saba, a 22-year-old Marine of Iraqi origin, said she could not understand all the fuss about goodbye letters.

 ?This is part of life. People should just get on with their work,? said Saba, who is single.

 UK army shake-up

 London, Dec. 16 (Reuters): 

 Britain announced today the most radical shake-up in decades 

 of its army, already stretched in areas including Iraq and 

 Afghanistan, to create a smaller and more flexible force 

 for the new anti-terror age.

 But critics accused the government of emasculating its fighting forces in the middle of the US-led ?war on terror.? Defence secretary Geoff Hoon said four of the existing 40 infantry battalions would be cut and a number of multi-battalion regiments created to pool skills.

 There would also be cuts in heavy armour and artillery units in the age of more fluid military engagements. ?Our objective is to develop a more deployable, agile and flexible force,? he told parliament.

 Hoon also announced the creation of a multi-service ranger unit to support the special forces that have been the key in the war on terror.

 The British army, currently around 117,000-strong makes up just under half of the country?s armed forces. Today?s announcement which includes the merging of Scotland?s Black Watch regiment ? just returned from high profile duty in Basra and south of Baghdad ? into the new multi-battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland, prompted howls of protest.

 ?It is a dark day for our armed forces. And an even darker day for the proud regiments it seeks to scrap,? said opposition Conservative defence spokesman Michael Ancram. ?Our armed forces deserve better than to be betrayed in this appalling manner by their government,? he added.

 A parliamentarian from Scotland was ejected from the House of Commons debating chamber for calling Hoon a ?backstabbing coward?.

 But Hoon said the shake-up ? which follows similar slimming and trimming exercises in the 1960s and 1990s ? followed a thorough review of every aspect of the modern army in the light of its new responsibilities in an uncertain world.

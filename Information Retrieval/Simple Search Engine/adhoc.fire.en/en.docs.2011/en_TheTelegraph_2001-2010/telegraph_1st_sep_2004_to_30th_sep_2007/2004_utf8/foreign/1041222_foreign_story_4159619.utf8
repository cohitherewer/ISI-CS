 US warns of chilling effect

 Washington, Dec. 21 (Reuters): The Bush administration today protested Russia?s auction of Yukos? main oil production unit and warned it could have a ?chilling effect? on foreign investment in Russia.

 ?We are disappointed that Russia went ahead with the auction of the Yukos subsidiary,? White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. ?We have communicated to the Russian government repeatedly that its handling of the Yukos matter could have a chilling effect on foreign investment in Russia and affect its role in the global economy.

 Earlier in Schleswig, Germany, Russian President Vladimir Putin threw his weight behind the controversial sale of Yukos? core asset Yugansk today despite a threat from the stricken company to escalate its legal battle in foreign courts.

 A day after his finance minister said he knew nothing about the mystery winner of Yugansk at Sunday?s auction, now in charge of 11 per cent of Russian oil exports, Putin revealed the company had shareholders active in the energy sector for ?many years?.

 ?As far as I?ve been informed the auction conformed completely with current Russian law and I expect that all other activities in this area in the future will also take place according to law,? Putin said after meeting Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.

 Putin did not identify who owns Yugansk?s buyer Baikal Finance, which nobody in Russia had heard of before Sunday?s auction. The firm does not possess a single oil well or even a website and yet lodged the winning $9.4 billion bid. Russian newspapers linked Baikal Finance to No. 4 Russian oil firm Surgutneftegaz, sending its shares up 8.6 per cent on the RTS exchange.

 Surgut, run by billionaire businessman Vladimir Bogdanov, has denied any links to Baikal. Today its officials were not available for comment. Yukos stepped up the legal pressure, saying the sale violated a US bankruptcy stay in a statement in Houston.

 It threatened legal action for $20 billion in damages against third parties participating in the sale, raising the prospect of oil cargo seizures abroad and adding to concerns over supplies from the world?s second-biggest oil exporter.

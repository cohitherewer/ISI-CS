 Myanmar on cautious Delhi radar

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: The power struggle within Myanmar?s ruling junta that ousted Prime Minister Khin Nyunt and brought in a hardliner will not derail Yangon?s top man Senior General Than Shwe?s state visit to India from October 24.

 The five-day trip of the State Peace and Development Committee chairman (SPDC) ? the first by a top Yangon leader ? is being seen as the culmination of the process started by the two countries to develop strong economic and security relations.

 India has been closely watching the developments in Yangon and is aware that hardliners are coming back into the saddle. But these are still early days and South Block is yet to make up its mind about the final outcome of the developments that saw the ousted Prime Minister put under house arrest yesterday.

 One reason why India wants closer links with the military rulers is to ensure it gets the SPDC?s cooperation in tackling northeast insurgents who have often taken shelter in Myanmar. Delhi also knows that Lieutenant General Soe Win, the country?s new Prime Minister, has served as Myanmar?s commander for the northwestern borders and is, therefore, aware of the ?ground reality? in India?s northeast.

 Win was commander of Myanmar?s northwest, which borders 1,400 km of India?s northeast, when the two sides coordinated to launch military operations against insurgents on the Myanmarese side of the border in 2001. India does not want to jump to conclusions whether Myanmar will do what Bhutan did last year to drive out rebels from its territory, but it feels encouraged that key leaders in Yangon are aware of the situation in the region.

 Shwe, whose visit comes at a time when militant violence has escalated in some parts of the northeast, will get a chance to meet almost all top leaders, including President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and foreign minister K. Natwar Singh. He will also visit Bodh Gaya and Calcutta.

 India knows the northwest border is not a security priority for Yangon, whose problems stem more from the border with Thailand and China. The only way Delhi can force Myanmar to focus on the region is to ensure that it has high economic stakes in that area. Sources said the arterial Moreh-Kalemao road and other infrastructure activities of India would, therefore, come into play to make the military rulers interested in the area.

 India is also looking at Myanmar?s natural gas resources and has talked to a South Korean company. The Indian leadership is also thinking of reviving some of the traditional river routes from Calcutta to Myanmar that existed during British rule.

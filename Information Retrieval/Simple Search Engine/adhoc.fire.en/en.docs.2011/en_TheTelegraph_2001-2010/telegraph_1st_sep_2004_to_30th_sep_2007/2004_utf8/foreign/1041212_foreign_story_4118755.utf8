 Taiwan party in poll defeat

 Taipei, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Taiwan?s President Chen Shui-bian?s party suffered a surprise defeat today in elections likely to be welcomed in Beijing as a step back from what it sees as dangerous moves towards independence from mainland China.

 Political analysts said the result indicated voters were wary of Chen?s moves to create a separate Taiwanese identity and Beijing was likely to be pleased that the opposition Nationalist Party, which favours closer ties with China, kept control of parliament.

 ?We don?t want war. We don?t want our government to take the road of provocation and create tension,? triumphant Nationalist leader Lien Chan said as hundreds of his supporters set off firecrackers outside. ?We hope that we can maintain the status quo between the two sides,? he said.

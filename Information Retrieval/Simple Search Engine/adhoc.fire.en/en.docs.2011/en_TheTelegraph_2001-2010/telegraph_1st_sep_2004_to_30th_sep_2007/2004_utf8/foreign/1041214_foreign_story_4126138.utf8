 Cairo heat on Bush ancestor

 Cairo, Dec. 13 (Reuters): The censors at al-Azhar, Cairo?s centre of Islamic learning, have recommended the government ban a 19th century biography of the Prophet Mohammad by a scholar portrayed in the Arabic media as an ancestor of President George W. Bush.

 An al-Azhar official, who asked not to be named, said today the ban applied to the original English version of The Life of Mohammad by the scholar George Bush, first published in 1830 and reissued in the US in 2002.

 He did not give a reason but press articles on an Arabic translation of the book have criticised its account of early Islamic history. They quote Bush as saying Muslims spread Islam by force and persecuted Christians. Excerpts have appeared in the Cairo daily Nahdet Misr.

 At least one of the newspaper?s articles came with large photographs of George W. Bush.

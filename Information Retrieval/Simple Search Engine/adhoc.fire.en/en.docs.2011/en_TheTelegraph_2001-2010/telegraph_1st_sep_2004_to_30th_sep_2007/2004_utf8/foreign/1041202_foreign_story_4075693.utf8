 Pervez for controlled democracy in Pak

Karachi, Dec. 1: Pro-democracy sentiments in Pakistan are gaining momentum again but President Pervez Musharraf appears to be firmly in control.

 In fact, Musharraf is himself taking an interest in restoring, what he perceives, as ?controlled democracy.? The dramatic release of Peoples? Party of Pakistan (PPP) leader Asif Ali Zardari and Musharraf?s subsequent telephonic conversations with Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif have indicated that the President is keen to permit general elections in 2005 to ward off criticism.

 In Pakistan, it is an open secret of sorts that Benazir?s husband Zardari?s release after eight long years in jail was carefully worked out. 

 Facing series of corruption charges that earned him the dubious tag of ?Mr Ten Per Cent?, Zardari has been talking softly, projecting himself as an ?ambassador? between the government and the Opposition parties. The PPP is pinning all hopes on the prospects of getting back Benazir home early next year.

 Its sudden proximity with the military regime has triggered off a chain reaction. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), an umbrella organisation of Opposition parties, has gone on the offensive. Sensing that the PPP was getting close to Musharraf, the MMA, consisting of various radical groups like Jamaat-e-Islami and Jamiat-e-Ulema, are demanding that President Pervez Musharraf quit the post of army chief.

 Last week, the grand alliance of six parties launched its campaign against Musharraf and his government with its first political rally at Karachi?s Nishtar Park.

 There were tough words but a thin attendance at the park even as the MMA leadership warned that if Musharraf does not relinquish the office of army chief by the end of this year as required under the country?s 17th constitutional amendment, the alliance would not recognise him as President.

 However, yesterday acting Pak President Mohammedmian Soomro signed the ?President to Hold Another Office Bill-2004? that allows Musharraf to retain the office of the chief of army staff beyond December 2004.

 The bill was rushed through Pakistan?s National Assembly and adopted by the Senate on November 1 in the absence of the MMA which boycotted the session after describing the bill as a negation of the constitution as well as the parliamentary system of government.

 The new law puts no time limit on how long he can hold both positions although his term as President is meant to end in 2007. Jamaat chief Qazi Hussain Ahmad too clarified said their opposition was limited to the issue of Musharraf holding twin posts. ?We do not want a President in uniform,? and went on to clarify that if Musharraf wants he can continue to be President of Pakistan. ?But he must allow democracy, rule of law and supremacy of parliament and the constitution.?

 He said the MMA?s movement was necessary, as it would remove ?despondency? of the people. Qazi Hussain pledged that the MMA would continue its struggle till the attainment of the objectives ? supremacy of the constitution, end to US interference, independent foreign policy and resolution of the Kashmir issue in accordance with the aspirations of the people of Kashmir and UN resolutions.

 But significantly, the PPP is keeping itself away from a ?pro-democracy? agitation. 

 Since his release from jail, Zardari has given a series of interviews underlining the need for ?national consensus? on tricky Indo-Pak relations and ties with the US. The PPP leader has openly questioned the credentials of several MMA leaders accusing them of being ?hand-in-glove? with the ?establishment.?

 Another key player and leader in exile Altaf Hussain is busy making pro-India noises. Karachi is flooded with rumours that Altaf?s thrust on ?good neighbourly relations? with India has Musharraf?s seal of approval. The President has found Altaf as a strong votary of making peace with India. 

 At this juncture, it is difficult to figure out who will emerge stronger once general elections in Pakistan are called but political analysts are somewhat unanimous that the idea of ?controlled democracy? cannot be put in practice once a democratically elected government assumes office.

 Fine Print

 Girlie grouse

 San Francisco, Sept. 10 (Reuters): California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called Democrats ?girlie men? during a recent budget battle. Now, a Democratic lobbyist wants to turn him into one in the form of a bobblehead doll in a hot pink dress and matching pumps.

 The Republican governor, a former bodybuilding champion, first made the remark during California?s budget fight with the state?s Democrat-controlled legislature. The comment, which drew howls of protest from Democrats, echoed old Saturday Night Live television show skits about bodybuilders. ?If there is a perfect example of a girlie man it?s Arnold,? lobbyist John Edgell said, adding that Schwarzenegger?s jibe at Democrats and efforts to halt the sale of an earlier bobblehead doll both invited satire.

 Penny prize

 London (Reuters): A routine walk with 

 his dog turned into a profitable excursion for one man, 

 who discovered a 1,200-year-old gold penny during the stroll 

 and now expects to sell it for thousands of pounds. The 

 coin weighs just 4.33 g and was discovered on a public footpath 

 beside the Ivel river in Bedfordshire, England. It is the 

 first new Anglo-Saxon gold penny to come to light in nearly 

 a century. London auctioneers Spink estimate the coin will 

 sell for ?120,000-?150,000 when it goes under the hammer 

 in October.

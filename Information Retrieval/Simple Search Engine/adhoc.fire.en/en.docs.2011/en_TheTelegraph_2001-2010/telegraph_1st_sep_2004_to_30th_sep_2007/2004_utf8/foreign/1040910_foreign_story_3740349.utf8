 Drivers dare to date

 London, Sept. 9 (Reuters): Millions of British drivers use traffic lights and jams as the perfect opportunity to pick up a hot date and sometimes even a marriage partner, according to a survey today.

 Up to two million UK motorists every day openly flirt while driving, the survey said. Half-a-million sleep with someone after initially spotting them during a road trip and as many 150,000 have met their husband or wife in traffic. On-the-road flirting is most common in Wales, where over 60 per cent of drivers admit to exchanging sultry glances with others from behind the wheel, according to the survey of motorists carried out by car company Vauxhall. 

 Spicy spray shocks rabbits

 Amsterdam (Reuters): Dutch farmers have 

 devised a hot and spicy way to stop rabbits and rodents 

 munching their lettuce, carrots and wheat. Spraying fields 

 with the American sauce Tabasco sends the rabbits ?three 

 feet in the air? with shock and running for cover, said 

 a spokesman for a local agriculture cooperative. The Dutch 

 animal protection society is happy with the spicy repellent, 

 unworried by the possibility of burnt bunny mouths. ?Preventive 

 measures are exactly what we want. It?s better than going 

 into the fields with a shotgun,? said an animal welfare 

 spokesman. The farmers will now try to make Tabasco an officially 

 recognised pesticide for subsidised use on a larger scale.

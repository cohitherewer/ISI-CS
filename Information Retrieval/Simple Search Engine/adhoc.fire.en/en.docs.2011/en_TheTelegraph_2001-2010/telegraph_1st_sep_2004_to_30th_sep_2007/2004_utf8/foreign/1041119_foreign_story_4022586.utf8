 Pak militant held

 Islamabad, Nov. 18 (Reuters) Pakistani security forces have arrested an Islamic militant suspected of involvement in a 2002 bomb attack on the US consulate in Karachi in which 12 Pakistanis were killed, officials said today.

 The suspect, Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan, a member of Harkat-ul Mujahideen al-Alami group, was arrested yesterday in Wagah where he was working as a cloth merchant. His arrest came on the same day police shot dead a militant wanted in connection with the Daniel Pearl killing.

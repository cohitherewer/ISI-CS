 Storming a forced response

 Berlin, Sept. 3 (Reuters): The storming of a school to free hundreds of Russian hostages looked more like a forced response by special forces than a controlled and deliberately initiated raid at a time of their choosing.

 That was the prevalent view among about a dozen security analysts speaking after the bloody and chaotic denouement of the three-day drama in which at least a 100 appeared to have died.

 What the Russian government desperately want for this to be is a controlled operation, a controlled siege, a controlled ending to it. This is anything but that, said Hugh McManners, a former member of Britains SAS special forces.

 The idea of an improvised rescue mission was supported by comments from a Russian security official who said the authorities had been preparing for more talks, not for a raid.

 However, experts were unanimous that the Russians, even if they had not wanted to storm the school, must have made contingency plans to do so if the militants had started to execute their captives. An analyst said the refusal of the hostage-takers to allow deliveries of food would probably have forced the Russians to intervene anyway today.

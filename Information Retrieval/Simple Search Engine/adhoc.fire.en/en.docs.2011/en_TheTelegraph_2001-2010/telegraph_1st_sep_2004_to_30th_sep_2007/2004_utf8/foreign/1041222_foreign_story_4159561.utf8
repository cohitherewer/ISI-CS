 Fine Print

 Twin trick

 Stockholm, Dec. 21 (Reuters): A man has escaped from a Swedish jail after switching clothes with his identical twin brother, officials said today.

 The two 18-year-olds were left alone in a detention cell yesterday after one of them had just been sentenced to 10 months in a reformatory school for assault and robbery. The convict walked free from the jail after switching clothes and pretending to be his brother.

 His brother then told wardens they now had the wrong man and his true identity was confirmed by fingerprinting. He was arrested for aiding a felon, but was also released a few hours later. He may face charges.

 ?We were quite simply duped. They are probably having a good laugh somewhere right now,? said Lars-Ake Pettersson, head of the jail in Kronoberg in Stockholm. 

 Lemon luck 

 London (Reuters): Jim Carrey?s new film 

 Lemony Snicket shot to the top of the UK box office 

 charts over the weekend, knocking superheroes The Incredibles 

 into second place. The film with Carrey, Meryl Streep and 

 Billy Connolly took over ?2 million in the first three days, 

 Screen International said. Festive offering The 

 Polar Express was another popular choice, lying in third 

 place on the charts. Blade, a thriller with Wesley 

 Snipes, took fourth place while the Phantom of the Opera 

 dropped to fifth. 

 Perky pills

 Rio de Janeiro (Reuters): Six pistol-toting Brazilian men appeared to have more than cash on their minds when they robbed a drug store in Rio de Janeiro. ?They specifically demanded that we give them anti-impotence drugs,? the drugstore manager said. On Sunday night, the robbers opened the vault with a blow torch and fled with an equivalent of about $7,000 in cash and checks, as well as more than 100 boxes containing 400 pills worth about $2,600.

 Indian peer slams Blair

 AMIT ROY

 Lord Navnit Dholakia

 London, Sept. 22: Lord Navnit Dholakia, the most effective Indian peer in the House of Lords, turned his fire power on Tony Blair in Bournemouth today in his farewell speech as president of the Liberal Democratic Party.

 Accusing Blair?s government, which has a big majority, of trying to create an ?authoritarian and dictatorial state?, Dholakia attacked Blair?s deeply unpopular Iraq policy. Dholakia was speaking at the Liberal Democrat annual conference after serving two successive two-year terms as party president, the first Asian to hold such high political office. The general assumption now is that thousands of Muslim voters in key Labour seats will abandon traditional allegiances at the next general election, which could be held in May next year, and vote Liberal Democrat.

 This is why many political commentators have been wondering whether the Liberal Democrats would be prepared to serve in a coalition government with Labour. For the time being, the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, who formed a useful double act with Dholakia, has ruled out this possibility. 

 Dholakia said he did not accuse Blair of being dishonest or that he had set out deliberately to deceive the country over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ? the Prime Minister?s ostensible reason for going to war against Saddam Hussein. ?But I do think his judgment has been found severely wanting and if we can?t trust his judgment on Iraq, can we trust it on any other issue?,? said Dholakia. ?The message we?re getting from the electorate is: ?No, we just don?t trust you any more.??

 Millions of people were ?disappointed and disillusioned? with Labour, he added. Dholakia was born in Tanzania, has lived in Britain for nearly 40 years, and he and his wife, Ann, who have two daughters, make it a point to attend as many Indian functions in London as possible. His stint as party president has taken him all over the country.

 He said that both Labour and the Tories knew that even small swings towards the Liberal Democrats could ?wipe out some of their most comfortable Westminster seats?.

 In his emotional farewell speech, he said: ?There was a time when the other two parties would try to simply ignore us, perhaps in the hope we would go away. But those days are long gone and it is with pride that I say that the Liberal Democrats are now ?Labour Enemy Number One?.?

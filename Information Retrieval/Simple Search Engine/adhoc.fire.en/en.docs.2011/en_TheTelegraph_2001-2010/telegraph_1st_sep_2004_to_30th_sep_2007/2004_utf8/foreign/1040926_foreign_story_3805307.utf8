 Hendrix estate

 Seattle, Sept. 25 (Reuters): The brother of rock legend Jimi Hendrix is not entitled to any money from the guitarist?s estate, a Seattle judge ruled yesterday.

 King county superior court judge Jeffrey Ramsdell ruled instead that Janie Hendrix, step-sister to Jimi and to Leon who brought the lawsuit, will continue to manage the bulk of the estimated $80 million estate.

 Jimi Hendrix died in London in 1970. His father Al Hendrix eventually received the rights to his music but died himself in 2002. He left the bulk of his estate to his daughter Janie, whom he adopted after marrying her mother.

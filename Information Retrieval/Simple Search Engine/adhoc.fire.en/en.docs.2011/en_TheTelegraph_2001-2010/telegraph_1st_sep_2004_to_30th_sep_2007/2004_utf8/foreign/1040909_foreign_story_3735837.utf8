 Fine Print

 Motorist menace

 Washington, Sept. 8 (Reuters): The average US motorist spends 46 hours each year or nearly two full days stuck in rush-hour traffic jams.

 annual report yesterday by the transportation institute at Texas A amp;M University found Los Angeles to be the worst US city for congestion, based on 2002 federal and state highway data.

 The average motorist spent 93 hours sitting in peak-hour traffic in Los Angeles compared with, 67 hours in Washington and 50 hours in New York City.

 Traffic delays have more than doubled since the early 1980s as more vehicles have packed an aging highway system in large and fast-growing metropolitan areas. Motorists wasted 5.7 billion gallons of fuel idling in traffic, the study showed. 

 Path prize

 Madrid (Reuters): Spain?s top peace 

 award this year goes to ... a path. The ?Camino de Santiago?, 

 a Christian pilgrim route through France and Spain to Santiago 

 de Compostela, traditionally considered the burial site 

 of Apostle Saint James, beat 38 other nominees to scoop 

 the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord. The award is given 

 each year to a person or group whose work has contributed 

 ?to the brotherhood of mankind, to the struggle against 

 injustice, poverty, disease or ignorance ... to opening 

 new horizons of knowledge?. Last year it went to Harry Potter 

 author J.K. Rowling.

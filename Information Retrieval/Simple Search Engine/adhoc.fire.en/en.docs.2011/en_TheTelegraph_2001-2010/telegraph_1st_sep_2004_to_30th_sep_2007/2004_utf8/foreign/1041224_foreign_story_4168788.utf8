 Even Santa wanted to join union

 London, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Union power may have been on the wane for some time now but at the height of the people power movement in the 1960s even Santa Claus wanted to join a union.

 Records released today by the National Archive ? the guardian of Britain?s collective memory ? showed a bid in 1968 to set up the Brotherhood of Father Christmas and Santa Claus Union.

 The initial application to the Registry of Friendly Societies ? the government list of unions and charities ? was rejected but the solicitor working on behalf of the would-be organised Santas was undeterred.

 ?All members of the union must endeavour to bring the spirit of fantasy to bear on each child?s visit,? the firm said in its application. ?No promises must be made by Father Christmas unless he intends to keep them himself in reality.? Finally in 1970, the authorities said a formal application to register the ?Claus Union? could be put forward.

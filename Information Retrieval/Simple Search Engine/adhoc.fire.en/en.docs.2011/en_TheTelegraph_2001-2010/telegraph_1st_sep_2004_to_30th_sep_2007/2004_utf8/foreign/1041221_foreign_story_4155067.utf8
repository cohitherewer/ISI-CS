 Fine Print

 Italian quality

 Milan, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Northern Italy has the money, but the south has family.

 Northern cities Bologna, Trento and Milan topped a yearly newspaper poll on the quality of life in Italy, scoring highly on income, safety, services and environment and highlighting a historical wealth gap between north and south.

 However, southern regions Calabria and Sicily won the marital stability category, with the lowest rates of divorce and separation. 

 And Neapolitans, despite a brutal mafia turf war in their southern city, value their lives more than any of their neighbours ? Naples has the lowest suicide rate, while the wealthy northeast has the highest. The poll, published by newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, ranked the city of Messina last for quality of life among the 103 cities surveyed.

 Voice over

 London (Reuters): The speculation is 

 over. The angelic voice of the young orphan Oliver Twist 

 in the hit 1960s movie was dubbed by a girl, Britain?s Mail 

 on Sunday newspaper said. Speculation has swirled for 

 years over the origin of the piping voice given that Mark 

 Lester who played the title part in the film has admitted 

 to not being able to sing a note. But the Mail tracked 

 down Kathe Green, daughter of the film?s musical director 

 John Green, who 36 years after the event said she was the 

 voice of Oliver! ?I knew nothing about lip-synching. 

 But I did the lot in a week-and-a-half,? she said.

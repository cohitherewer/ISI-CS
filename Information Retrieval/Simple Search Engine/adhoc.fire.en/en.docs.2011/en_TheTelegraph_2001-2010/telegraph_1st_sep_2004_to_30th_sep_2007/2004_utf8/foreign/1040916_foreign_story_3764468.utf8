 US rebukes Riyadh on religion

 Washington, Sept. 15 (Reuters): The US today accused Saudi Arabia of severe violations of religious freedom in a rare official rebuke of a close ally and key oil supplier that potentially could lead to sanctions.

 ?Freedom of religion does not exist? in Saudi Arabia, the state department said in an annual report tracking religious freedom worldwide. It included the kingdom for the first time on a blacklist of eight countries ?of particular concern.?

 ?Freedom of religion is not recognised or protected under the country?s laws and basic religious freedoms are denied to all but those who adhere to the state-sanctioned version of Sunni Islam,? the report said.

 Today?s surprise designation allowed for a range of sanctions on Saudi Arabia, but there was no expectation any would be applied on the world?s largest oil exporter.

 Briton killed

 Three suspected Muslim militants gunned down a Briton in the Saudi capital Riyadh today, security sources and diplomats said.

 They said the gunmen, driving past in a car, shot the man twice in the chest and twice in the head in a suburb east of the city near a shopping complex.

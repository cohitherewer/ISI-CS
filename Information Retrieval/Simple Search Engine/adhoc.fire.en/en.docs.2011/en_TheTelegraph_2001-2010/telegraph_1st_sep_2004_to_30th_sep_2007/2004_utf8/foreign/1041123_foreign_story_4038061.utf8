 Plagues of Egypt

 Jerusalem, Nov. 22 (Reuters): Millions of locusts swarmed through Israel?s Red Sea resort town of Eilat yesterday, devouring crops and flowers in the country?s south.

 Israeli agriculture officials sent crop dusters into the air to spray against the locusts that swept in from North Africa in the first such invasion since 1959. Eilat residents reported clouds of locusts eating palm trees bare and wiping out entire gardens.

 ?You watch as trees that are covered with flowers are devoured. They ate everything, even a grassy roundabout,? said Meir, a resident.

 Curious residents swatted locusts as long as 10 cm which filled the air as they walked outside to inspect the damage. ?It?s like the plagues of Egypt,? said one resident. In the Bible, locusts were the eighth of 10 plagues that God inflicted on the ancient Egyptians.

 Kabul vote count begins

 Kabul, Oct. 14 (Reuters): Vote counting began in Afghanistan today, five days after millions of men and women shrugged off militant threats to take part in a landmark presidential election they hope will bring peace to the war-weary nation.

 With Ramazan expected to start tomorrow, counting now under way at five of the eight regional counting centres will halt until Saturday and it could be another week before any trends are evident.

 ?We might have a substantial result, something that you can interpret, in a week to 10 days,? said Reginald Austin, head of the Joint Electoral Management Body?s (JEMB) technical and logistics operations. 

 ?The voters have done their job very well. Now it is up to us,? said Austin, after the JEMB came in for heavy criticism over a series of glitches on polling day.

 Irregularities in Saturday?s poll overshadowed an otherwise triumphant exercise in which millions of men and women defied threats of attack by remnants of the fallen Taliban militia whose fiery warnings of chaos and car bombs proved empty.

 Expectations of a high turnout, after more than 12 million people registered to vote, were reinforced by the early returns.

 With figures in from fewer than half the polling stations, and none for the hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees who voted in Iran and Pakistan, the turnout so far was put at 3.3 million.

 Women accounted for around 41 per cent of those votes but their level of participation varied widely, preliminary figures showed.

 In the northern province of Faryab they accounted for more than 50 per cent, but only 11 per cent in Zabul, one of the southern provinces worst-hit by a Islamist militant insurgency inspired by Afghanistans former rulers, the Taliban militia.

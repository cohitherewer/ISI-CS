 Pak parties slam Pervez

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 16: Pakistani Opposition parties today reacted sharply to the announcement by President Pervez Musharraf that he did not intend to resign as army chief by the end of this year. 

 The announcement late yesterday caught all the mainstream political parties by surprise. They accused Musharraf of reneging on a commitment he had given to them and a pledge he had made to the nation in a televised speech in December 2003.

 Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, acting head of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-) of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said Musharraf?s decision was a ?disaster-in-waiting for Pakistan?. ?So far he has clung to the office not because of any electoral process but through the barrel of a gun and the uniform he is wearing,? Khan said. Liaqut Baloch of the religious alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) also warned of a constitution crisis.

 Musharraf, who had removed Nawaz Sharif through a bloodless coup in October 1999, had promised to give up his military post by December 2004 after a deal with the MMA which had agreed not to oppose a set of constitutional amendments Musharraf had wanted to push through the national legislature.

 Following the deal, the MMA abstained from voting on the controversial Legal Framework Order 2003 (LFO) that armed Musharraf with sweeping powers such as the right to dismiss government and dissolve parliament whenever he deems fit. 

 But Musharraf and his political supporters in the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) have since been testing public opinion on the issue. The President himself told a private TV channel last week that 96 per cent of Pakistanis wanted him to stay on as the head of the army. However, Musharraf said he would take a decision based on the constitution and the popular demand in the best national interest.

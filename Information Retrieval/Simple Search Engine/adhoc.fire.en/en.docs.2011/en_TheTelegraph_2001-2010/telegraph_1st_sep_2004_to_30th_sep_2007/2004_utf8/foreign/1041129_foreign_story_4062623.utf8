 Iran backs down on nuke plan

 Vienna, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Iran formally withdrew its demand to exempt sensitive research from a freeze of key parts of its nuclear programme ? a last-minute bid to remove the threat of UN economic sanctions, Western diplomats said today.

 Iran?s request to be permitted to operate 20 centrifuges, which enrich uranium for use as fuel in power plants or weapons, nearly wrecked an agreement it reached with the European Union to halt all work linked to making atomic fuel.

 A diplomat close to the UN International Atomic Energy Agency said: ?The IAEA received a letter from Iran regarding the 20 centrifuges. It seems to cover all the elements and appears to be acceptable (to the EU).?

 Details of the letter were not immediately available, but a Western diplomat in Vienna said it appeared to be enough to save Iran from the double threat of a UN Security Council referral and economic sanctions.

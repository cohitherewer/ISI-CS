 Science finds the God gene

 ELIZABETH DAY

 London, Nov. 14: Religious belief is determined by a person?s genetic make-up according to a study by a leading scientist. After comparing more than 2,000 DNA samples, an American molecular geneticist concluded that a person?s capacity to believe in God is linked to brain chemicals.

 His findings were criticised ight by leading clerics, who say the research undermines a fundamental tenet of faith ? that spiritual enlightenment is achieved through divine transformation rather than the brain?s electrical impulses.

 Dean Hamer, director of the Gene Structure and Regulation Unit at the National Cancer Institute in America, asked volunteers 226 questions in order to determine how spiritually connected they felt to the universe. The higher their score, the greater a person?s ability to believe in a greater spiritual force and, Hamer found, the more likely they were to share the gene, VMAT2.

 Studies on twins showed that those with this gene, a vesicular monoamine transporter that regulates the flow of mood-altering chemicals in the brain, were more likely to develop a spiritual belief.

 Growing up in a religious environment was said to have little effect on belief. Hamer, who in 1993 claimed to have identified a DNA sequence linked to male homosexuality, said the existence of the ?god gene? explained why some people had more aptitude for spirituality than others.

 ?Buddha, Mohammed and Jesus all shared a series of mystical experiences or alterations in consciousness and thus probably carried the gene,? he said.

 Drunk driver Hasselhoff 

 Los Angeles, Oct. 29 (Reuters): Former Baywatch TV star David Hasselhoff pleaded no contest yesterday to a charge of drunk driving and was ordered to attend an alcohol treatment programme for six months.

 Hasselhoff, 52, did not attend the court hearing and his lawyer entered the plea on his behalf. The actor was charged with driving under the influence after being stopped in the Los Angeles area in June.

 Hasselhoff, who played a lifeguard in the international hit show Baywatch, was also ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.

 The actor has struggled for several years to control his drinking.

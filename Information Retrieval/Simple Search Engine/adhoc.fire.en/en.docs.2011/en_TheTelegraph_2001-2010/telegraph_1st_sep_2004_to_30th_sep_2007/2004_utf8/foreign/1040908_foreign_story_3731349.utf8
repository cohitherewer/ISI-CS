 Clinton escaped big attack

 New York, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Former US President Bill Clinton was recovering after successful quadruple heart bypass surgery at a New York hospital yesterday, and his doctors said he would have risked a substantial heart attack without the operation. 

 Some of Clintons arteries had been 90-per cent blocked, chief of cardiology Allan Schwartz of New York-Presbyterian Hospital told a news conference.

 Dr Craig Smith, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the hospital, who led the procedure, said it had been relatively routine. 

 Starting this (Monday) morning at about 8 am, he had a relatively routine quadruple bypass operation. We left the operating room around noon and he is recovering normally at this point, Smith said.

 Clinton, who was admitted on Friday, is expected to remain in the hospital for four or five days and should make a full recovery within two to three months.

 Democrat daughters in Florida fight

 Plantation (Florida), Oct. 31 (AFP): The Democrats unleashed their girl power to battleground Florida deploying daughters of presidential hopeful John Kerry and those of former Presidents John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton.

 Also in the charm brigade were the daughters of Kerry?s running mate John Edwards and of former Vice-President Al Gore, who opposed Bush in the 2000 election, as well as veteran pop singer Carol King.

 ?We?re all going to take back our future,? Vanessa Kerry said at a rally in Plantation, north of Miami, one of the several girls staged to get out the vote in the pivotal swing state. ?He needs your help,? she said in reference to her father who is running a neck-and-neck race with Bush in Florida.

 ?This is the election of our lifetime,? said Caroline Kennedy, comparing the presidential race to the close 1960 election that brought her father to power. The crowed responded by chanting ?JFK? ? the initials of her father and of John Forbes Kerry.

 Chelsea Clinton received thunderous applause when she spoke of her father?s eight years in office, known as the Democrats? golden era. References to Bush were greeted with chants of ?liar, liar? and references to the chaotic and controversial 2000 election elicited boos from the crowd.

 ?We know we really won,? said Karenna Gore, echoing the belief of many Democrats that Bush stole the election when the US Supreme Court stopped five weeks of recounts, leaving him with a 537-vote lead in Florida that gave him the presidency.

 Fresh from Oceans, Zeta-Jones in Ivy league

 Catherine Zeta-Jones

 Los Angeles, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Catherine Zeta-Jones and her Ocean?s Twelve producer Jerry Weintraub are teaming up again on The Ivy Chronicles, a comedy-drama based on an upcoming novel by Karen Quinn.

 The Warner Bros. project centres on a former Wall Street high-flyer who, after losing her job and finding her husband in bed with the wife of her replacement, establishes a kindergarten referral service for well-heeled Manhattanites vying to get their tots into the country?s best schools.

 Quinn?s novel will be published in February by Viking Books. Zeta-Jones will star in the film adaptation, which Weintraub is producing. Zeta-Jones has recently been at work on The Mask of Zorro sequel, Legend of Zorro, as well as Ocean?s Twelve, which Warner Bros. will release on December 10.

 Other projects in the pipeline include Smoke amp; Mirrors, from director Mimi Leder, and Coming Out, a rugby feature set in Zeta-Jones? native Wales.

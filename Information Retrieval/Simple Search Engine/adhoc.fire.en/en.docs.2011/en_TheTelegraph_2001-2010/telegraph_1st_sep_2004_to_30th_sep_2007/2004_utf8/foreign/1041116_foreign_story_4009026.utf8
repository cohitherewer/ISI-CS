 Tom to crack the Code

 Tom Hanks

 Los Angeles, Nov. 15: Tom Hanks is expected to step into the scholarly shoes of Robert Langdon, the professor who unravels the mystery of the Holy Grail in the film version of Dan Brown?s phenomenally successful novel The Da Vinci Code.

 Hanks has emerged as director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer?s top choice for the lead role in the film, which Columbia Pictures hopes to begin shooting next year. 

 Talks have begun for the actor to join the project.

 ?Tom is an exciting actor to watch thinking,? Howard was quoted as saying in the latest issue of Newsweek. ?We probably don?t need his status from a box office standpoint, but he gives Langdon instant legitimacy.?

 Hanks, who currently can be seen onscreen in animated form in Warner Bros. Pictures? The Polar Express, previously worked with Howard in 1995?s Apollo 13 and 1984?s Splash.

 Howard is currently completing work on The Cinderella Man, a boxing drama starring Russell Crowe, which Universal Pictures will release in the summer.

 Akiva Goldsman, who wrote the screenplay for Howard?s A Beautiful Mind, is working on the screen adaptation of Brown?s Doubleday novel, which has spent 86 weeks on the New York Times? hardcover fiction best-seller list.

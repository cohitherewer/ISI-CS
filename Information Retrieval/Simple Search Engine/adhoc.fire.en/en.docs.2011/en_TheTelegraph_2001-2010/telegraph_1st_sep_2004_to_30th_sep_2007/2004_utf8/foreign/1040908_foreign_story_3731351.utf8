 Dubya slip 

 Poplar Bluff (Montana), Sept. 7 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush offered an unexpected reason yesterday for cracking down on frivolous medical lawsuits: Too many OB-GYNs arent able to practice their love with women all across this country.

 The Republican President, long known for verbal and grammatical lapses, included the anecdote about obstetrician gynaecologists in his stump speech attacking Senator John Kerry.

 At a rally of cheering supporters in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, Bush said: Weve got an issue in America. Too many good docs are getting out of business. Too many OB-GYNs arent able to practice their love with women all across this country.

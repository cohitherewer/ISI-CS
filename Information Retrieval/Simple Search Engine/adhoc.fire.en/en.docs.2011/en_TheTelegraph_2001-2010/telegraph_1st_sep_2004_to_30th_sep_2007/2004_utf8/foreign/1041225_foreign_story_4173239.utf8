 Merry time for luxury goods

 New York, Dec. 24 (Reuters): Fancy a $20,000 suit of armour under the Christmas tree? Or how about a crystal-encrusted Mrs Potato Head for $8,000? Or maybe a $50,000 Ferrari go-cart?

 While many US retailers are cutting prices to draw crowds and bolster holiday sales, upscale US retailers are having a merry time meeting strong demand for luxury gifts.

 The International Council of Shopping Centers expects the luxury market to be the retail story of 2004, with strong sales at upscale Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and Nordstrom stores, and Coach handbags being snapped up.

 FAO Schwarz, the upper-end toy store that reopened its flagship store on New York?s glitzy Fifth Avenue on Thanksgiving Day on November 25, said it had even sold its 3D motion simulator theatre with a price tag of $300,000.

 Using CD-ROMs, the eight-seat theatre can take users on rides ranging from flying off the deck of an aircraft carrier to taking a walk outside the International Space Station.

 ?We would not give numbers but we have had sales across the board of our luxury goods and we are very pleased,? said Kim Richmond, a spokeswoman for FAO Schwarz which also sells the Ferrari go-cart that can travel at 15 mph.

 No one was available at Neiman Marcus to comment on how many Americans would be getting a suit of armour for Christmas.

 Lower-end retailers aren?t having as much fun, with slow sales over the key Thanksgiving-to-Christmas period that accounts for 23 per cent of annual US retail sales, the latest data show. 

 Shoppers who only dream of New York?s ritzy Fifth Avenue stores have limited spending on gifts.

 Only two luxury items, jewellery and fragrances, had higher sales last weekend versus last year, one of the year?s biggest shopping weekends, according to market researcher America?s Research Group.

 ?We are now back to the pre-September 11 (2001) level of corporate entertaining and Christmas parties and this has helped drive sales of evening wear and jewellery,? Britt Beemer, the groups chairman.

 Beemer said sales of 23 other merchandise categories were lower or flat compared with last year. 

 Toy sales are down with no single hot toy inspiring purchases, while electronics sales are flat.

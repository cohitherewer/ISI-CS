 US gay bishop row

 London, Oct. 18 (Reuters): The Anglican hierarchy urged US church leaders today to apologise for consecrating a gay bishop and called for a moratorium on same-sex marriages.

 In a report designed to pull the 70-million-strong Anglican Communion out of its biggest crisis for a decade, Irish Anglican leader Robin Eames concluded: ?There remains a very real danger that we will not choose to walk together.?

 The crisis erupted last year when Canadian Anglicans voted to approve same-sex marriages and US Anglicans, known as Episcopalians, consecrated Gene Robinson, a homosexual divorced father of two, as a bishop.

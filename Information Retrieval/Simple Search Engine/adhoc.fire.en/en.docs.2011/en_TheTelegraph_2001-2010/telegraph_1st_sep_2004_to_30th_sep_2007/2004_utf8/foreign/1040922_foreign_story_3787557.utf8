 Fine Print

 Cruise control

 London, Sept. 21 (Reuters): Tom Cruise?s first outing as a screen villain has seduced British viewers and sent his latest film Collateral straight to the top of the UK box office, Screen International said today.

 Cruise plays an assassin in the film but he managed to warm cinemagoers? hearts with a walkabout at its British premiere earlier this month, chatting to fans in Leicester Square for more than two hours.

 Weekend box office takings amounted to ?2.2 million for the thriller, which also stars comic actor Jamie Foxx.

 Collateral pushed low-budget shark thriller Open Water into second place. The independent film, based on the true story of a holidaying couple stranded in the ocean and surrounded by sharks, has grossed ?3.4 million since its UK release.

 Brash Beeb

 London (Reuters): Britain?s media regulator 

 has chastised a presenter on a BBC children?s television 

 programme for wearing a T-shirt with a sexually suggestive 

 slogan. Dominic Wood, co-host of the BBC Saturday morning 

 show Dick and Dom in da bungalow, wore a shirt bearing 

 the phrase: ?Morning Wood,? a slang term for male arousal. 

 ?On one level the slogan could be viewed as harmless, in 

 that it was morning and the presenter?s name was Wood,? 

 media regulator Ofcom said.?However it was also clear to 

 some that the phrase had a sexual meaning.?

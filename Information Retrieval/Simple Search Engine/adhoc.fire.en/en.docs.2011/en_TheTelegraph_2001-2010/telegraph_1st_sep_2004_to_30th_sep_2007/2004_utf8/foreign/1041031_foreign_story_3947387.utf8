Los Angeles, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Rap star Eminem 

says in an interview released yesterday that fame makes him feel like he is living 

in a cage and that he never knows whether a woman is interested in him or in his 

success.

 In an interview to be published in the December issue of Vanity Fair, Eminem said he could live without his huge fame.

 ?I would take it back to where I made a comfortable living. To where I would just make music, have people appreciate it, even if it?s a few people who appreciate it, and be able to walk to a mall, walk to a store.

 ?When you get fame and fortune and you make something of your life and become successful... But (there is a) whole new slew of problems that I never expected that come along with it,? he said, adding: ?Sometimes I battle with these demons that make me say in my head: ?I?m not going to be locked in a... cage, I?m... gonna walk in this place and I?m not going to sign any autographs.?

 As for women, the rapper said: ?Do they truly, genuinely love me for me? The reason they?re approaching me is because I?m Eminem. And I will never be able to get over that insecurity ... Does this person care about me for me, or is it too late in the game now? Because I have money, I have fame, and I?m who I am.?

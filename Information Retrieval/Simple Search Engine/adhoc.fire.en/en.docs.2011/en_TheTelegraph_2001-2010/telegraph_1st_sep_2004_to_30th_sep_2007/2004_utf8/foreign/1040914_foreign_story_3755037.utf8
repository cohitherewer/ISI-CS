 20 die as US raids Falluja

 Falluja (Iraq), Sept. 13 (Reuters): US forces launched air strikes on the rebel-held city of Falluja today, targeting what they said was a meeting of key loyalists of their top foe in Iraq, Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

 Iraqi doctors at Falluja Hospital said 16 Iraqis were killed, including women and children. The health ministry in Baghdad put the Iraqi toll at 20 men. The US military said its intelligence suggested only followers of Zarqawi were killed.

 Elsewhere, another six Iraqis died after US forces opened fire on a village near the town of Hilla, 100 km south of Baghdad, Abdel Zahra al-Nasrawi, director of al-Musayib hospital, said. A US spokeswoman had no immediate information.

 The Falluja attacks followed one of the most violent days in Iraq in recent months in which at least 110 people were killed in Baghdad and other Iraqi towns. 

 ?Intelligence sources reported the presence of several key Zarqawi operatives who have been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks against Iraqi civilians, Iraqi security forces and multinational forces,? a US military statement said.

 ?Intelligence reports indicated that only Zarqawi operatives and associates were at the meeting location at the time of the strike,? it said.

 Dr Iyad Mohamed of Falluja Hospital said 16 Iraqis were killed and 12 wounded in the attacks in Falluja, 50 km west of Baghdad. The US military has accused Iraqis in Falluja of exaggerating civilian casualties. Most residents insist civilians are being targeted.

 Columns of black smoke rose into the sky and hundreds of Iraqis could be seen leaving the city. US forces used loudspeakers to call on them to cooperate and ?expel terrorists from the centre of the city?. 

 The city is a cauldron of anti-US anger. American Marines pulled out in May after weeks of fighting which killed hundreds of Iraqis and sparked nationwide outrage. Security was handed over to an Iraqi force which has since disintegrated.

 Hostage crisis

 In a bid to resolve the latest kidnap crisis, Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini flew to Kuwait today to appeal for the release of two Italian hostages ahead of a purported 24-hour execution deadline set by their captors.

 Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, who worked on projects to help Iraqi children, were the first western women to be kidnapped in Iraq.

 Underlining their plight, a videotape dated August 17 appeared on the website of Zarqawi?s Tawhid and Jihad group appearing to showing armed men slitting the throat of a Turkish truck driver abducted in mid-August.

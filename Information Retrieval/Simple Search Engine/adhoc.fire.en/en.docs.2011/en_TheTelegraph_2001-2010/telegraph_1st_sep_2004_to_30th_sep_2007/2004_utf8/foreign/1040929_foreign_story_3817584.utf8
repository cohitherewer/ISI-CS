 Fine Print

 Reality ruckus

 Rome, Sept. 28 (Reuters): It didn?t take long for the celebrities on the Island of the Famous, a popular reality show broadcast on Italian state television, to figure out that they hadn?t found paradise.

 First, Hurricane Jeanne crashed the party ravaging the tiny Caribbean island where the 12 famous personalities were due to compete in Survivor-style tests for top honours. The show?s launch was delayed for 10 days.

 on Monday, less than a week after the programme kicked off, seven of the 12 stars were evacuated to a nearby hospital with food poisoning after eating nuts found on the beach.

 Among those who needed treatment were former Italian soccer star Toto Schillaci and Indian-born actor Kabir Bedi, who has appeared in numerous soap operas including Dynasty and The Bold and the Beautiful.

 Tennis tale

 London (Reuters): Tennis tale Wimbledon has smashed 

the Tom Cruise thriller Collateral out of the number one spot at the UK 

box office, Screen International said on Tuesday. Starring Kirsten Dunst 

and Paul Bettany, the romantic comedy was slammed by critics as short on gags 

and unrealistic but it proved a hit with British audiences, grossing ?1.7 million 

in its first weekend. Director Richard Loncraine said he wanted his film to be 

the new When Harry Met Sally. It tells the story of Bettany?s bumbling, 

jocular Brit opposite a savvy, confident American love interest, played by Kirsten 

Dunst.

 Karzai bounces back on poll trail

 Ghazni (Afghanistan), Oct. 5 (Reuters): Afghan President Hamid Karzai hit the election trail today for the first time since an assassination attempt last month, telling supporters a historic vote in four days would be a turning point for the war-torn nation.

 While the President and his main rivals campaigned ahead of Saturday?s landmark presidential election, the local AIP news agency reported seven policemen were killed when their vehicle drove over a land mine in the southern province of Kandahar. There were no immediate details, but the Taliban guerrillas who have vowed to disrupt the poll were believed responsible.

 Hundreds of troops, police and security guards, including special American bodyguards, were on alert as Karzai spoke to a cheering crowd of about 10,000 people in the town of Ghazni, southwest of Kabul.

 Speaking alternately in the country?s two main languages, Dari and Pushto, Karzai said: ?This vote is not just to choose a President, but for peace and stability in Afghanistan.

 ?Instead of fighting, we are campaigning for our elections. We should be proud that we have freedom at last.? It will be the first time that Afghans will directly elect their own leader. Eighteen candidates, including Karzai, are in the fray.

 His main challenger, Yunus Qanuni, campaigned in Kabul, addressing about 4,000 supporters in the city?s main stadium.

 ?Dear brothers and sisters, you are the ones who will elect the President of Afghanistan,? the former education minister said. ?I want your support, I want your vote.? In the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif, another candidate, Uzbek General Abdul Rashid Dostum, addressed about 2,000 people. The flurry of electioneering comes as the campaign, which has been lacklustre so far, is scheduled to close tomorrow.

 All this is very new to Afghanistan, which has been torn by war since the 1979 Soviet invasion and has not held any form of election since the late 1960s. More than 10.5 million people have signed up to vote in the country itself, from a population of about 28 million.

 Almost 750,000 Afghan refugees in neighbouring Pakistan who fled the violence in their homeland have also registered. An estimated 400,000 to 600,000 are eligible to vote in Iran as registered Afghan refugees.

 Saturday?s election is being claimed as a foreign policy success by US President George W. Bush, who ousted Afghanistan?s Islamic fundamentalist Taliban rulers in late 2001 for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden after his al Qaida network attacked the US that September.

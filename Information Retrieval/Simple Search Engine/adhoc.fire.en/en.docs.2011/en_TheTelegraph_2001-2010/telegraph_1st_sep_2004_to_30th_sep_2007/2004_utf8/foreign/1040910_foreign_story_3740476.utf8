 70 dead in bloodiest raid on Pak tribals

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 9: More 

 than 70 people were killed in the bloodiest-ever missile 

 attack on Pakistan?s lawless tribal belt early this morning.

 However, Pakistan military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan confirmed that 50 people had been killed, most of them foreign militants. The local tribesmen insisted that the raids had killed more than 70 civilians.

 ?The terrorist training camp has been destroyed successfully through a ?precise strike? that lasted for two hours in Dila Khula about 25 km east of the region?s administrative centre Wana,? Sultan said. 

 ?There were confirmed reports of training activity being conducted by foreign elements, including Uzbeks, Chechens and a few Arabs,? he added

 When asked to comment on local reports of heavy civilian casualties, Sultan said: ?They were all militants and if there were any locals, they would have to be part of those militants.?

 Villager Ajab Nur said around 40 members of the Taliban militia and allied Islamic militants had gathered at the time of the attack. Many of the fighters were killed in the airstrikes.

 But, according to Nur, dozens of civilians also died in a subsequent raid after they gathered to survey the damage in the area located around 50 km from the Afghan border.

 ?There was a gathering of about 40 or so militants early this morning,? said Nur. ?Two bombs fell on them. Then villagers went to see what had happened ... and there was a second attack and many people were killed.? 

 Residents estimated that between 70 and 90 people had died, making it one of the bloodiest clashes in Pakistan?s lawless tribal belt since the military launched a crackdown on al Qaida-linked militants hiding there. 

 Top al Qaida militant Nek Mohammad was killed in a similar attack in Wana three months ago.

 A security official said in Peshawar that local tribesmen had been asked to close down the camp in the past, but they had failed to do so.

 Islamic militants are incensed at Pakistan?s decision to back the US-led war on terror, and have been blamed for two attempts to assassinate President Pervez Musharraf in December and a July suicide bomb attack on Shaukat Aziz, who is now Prime Minister.

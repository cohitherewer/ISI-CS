 Russian scientist sentenced for spying

 Valentin Danilov

 Moscow, Nov. 24 (Reuters): A Russian scientist convicted of spying for China was sentenced today to 14 years in jail, in a case rights groups fear was politically driven to stop scientists working with foreigners.

 Physicist Valentin Danilov was initially acquitted of selling state secrets to Russia?s southern neighbour, but was retried after security services complained about the verdict.

 ?Danilov was found guilty of treason... he gave away Russian state secrets and embezzled state money,? said Sergei Blinov, deputy head of the FSB security service in Siberia?s Krasnoyarsk region, where the trial took place.

 ?The information he gave damaged Russian security,? he told Russian television. ?This information was needed by China for military purposes.?

 Scientists and human rights groups condemned the conviction, saying it reminded them of Stalin-era trials used to crush political dissidents.

 ?The decision in Valentin Danilov?s case is causing irreparable damage to our state,? Vitaly Ginzburg, a physicist who won the Nobel Prize in 2003 and is part of a committee to defend scientists from political attack, told Ekho Moskvy radio.

 Danilovs case is the latest in a string of spying convictions of scientists and journalists who have worked with foreign organisations brought since President Vladimir Putin, himself a former spy, was elected in 2000.

 A second member of the Social Committee to Defend Scientists, veteran activist Lyudmila Alexeyeva, said the FSB was casting around for scapegoats in prosecuting scientists.

 ?The FSB does not have the brains or professionalism to actually find spies, so it attacks the easiest target by arresting people who work with foreigners ? diplomats and rights activists could be next,? she said.

 Another scientist told Ekho Moskvy it could stop academics, who often have to look abroad for funding, working altogether.

 ?...It creates an impossible situation. People wonder whether they should work at all in such a country,? said physicist Sergei Kapitsa, well-known nationally for making science accessible to ordinary Russians.

 Danilov, who was accused of selling a device designed to examine ways to destroy satellites and of embezzling university funds, will appeal in a higher court.

 ?Of course we will appeal to the Supreme Court and to the (European) court for human rights. I consider the courts decision illegal and unjust,? said his lawyer Yelena Yevmenova.

 ?Danilov said that he does not consider himself guilty, not because he is stubborn but because he doesnt know what he is supposed to be guilty of.?

 Danilov is the second scientist convicted this year. Nuclear expert Igor Sutyagin was convicted in April of passing secrets to a British firm fronting for U.S. intelligence.

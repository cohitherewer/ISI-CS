 New worm threatens PC systems

 Washington, Oct. 30 (AFP): A new Internet worm was spreading quickly, threatening to overload computer systems around the world by generating copies by e-mail, security experts said.

 California-based Panda Software yesterday issued a ?red alert? for the new variant of the Bagle worm. ?The Nagle.Bc worm is increasing its already high rate of propagation, causing more and more incidents in users? computers worldwide,? Panda said. ?Just a few hours after it appeared, it has made the top half of the ranking of the viruses most frequently detected.

 Messagelabs, another security firm, said it intercepted nearly 900,000 copies of the worm yesterday, which uses disguised addresses appearing to come from a legitimate friend, associate or family member. ?The spoofed subject header will contain greetings such as ?hello,? ?thank you!? and ?thanks,? and the viruses spread when e-mail attachments named ?price,? ?price? or joke are opened,? Messagelabs said.

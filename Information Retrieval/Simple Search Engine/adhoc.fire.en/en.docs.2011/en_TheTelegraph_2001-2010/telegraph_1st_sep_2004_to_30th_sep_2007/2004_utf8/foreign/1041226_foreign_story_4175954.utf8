 London, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Bookmakers Ladbrokes said today they had paid punters who bet on a white Christmas in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Manchester after an overnight dusting of snow.

 ?A chill went down our spines when it started snowing in Scotland on Christmas Eve,? a Ladbrokes spokesman said. Ladbrokes estimated the successful bets had cost it over ?500,000, and said it had not paid out on snow in Cardiff, London or Birmingham.

 The biggest bet on a white Christmas was was ?5,000 pounds on snow in London at odds of five to one, it said. Bookmakers did not pay out on a white Christmas in 2002 and 2003.

 Lucy Verasamy, of the Press Association WeatherCentre, said: ?Southwest England will get a dusting of snow over the moors.? English counties including Shropshire and Staffordshire have also seen snow. 

 Between 1971 and 1992 there was only one year ? 1980 ? when widespread sleet and snow fell across the UK on Christmas Day, whereas in the years 1993 to 2003 it happened five times.

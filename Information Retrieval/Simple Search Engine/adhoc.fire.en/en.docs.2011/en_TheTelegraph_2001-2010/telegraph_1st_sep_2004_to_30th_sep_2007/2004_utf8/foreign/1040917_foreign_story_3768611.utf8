 Annan says war illegal, doubts polls

 United Nations, Sept. 16 (Reuters): 

 UN secretary-general Kofi Annan questioned yesterday 

 whether Iraq could hold elections in January if violence 

 persisted and said the US-led invasion of Iraq was illegal 

 because it violated the UN charter.

 Annan, in an interview with the BBC, said the 15-member Security Council should have approved the invasion of Iraq in mid-March 2003. Questioned repeatedly whether he considered the war illegal, Annan said: ?Yes, if you wish. I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter from our point of view, from the chapter point of view, it was illegal.?

 ?I hope we don?t see another Iraq-type operation for a long time... without UN approval and much broader support from the international community,? Annan added. Annan made a similar comment on March 10, 2003 during a news conference in The Hague, Netherlands, shortly before the invasion. 

 The secretary-general, in a report to the council last week, said the persistent violence in Iraq would make it difficult to hold elections as planned in January. The UN has advised Iraqi officials on the polls.

 In the BBC interview, Annan was blunter. ?You cannot have credible elections if the security conditions continue as they are now,? he said. Annan said a judgment will have to be made by the Iraqi government.

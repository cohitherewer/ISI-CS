 Russia holiday suspense

 Moscow, Dec. 24 (Reuters): Christmas is coming but Russian lawmakers have yet to finalise the holiday calendar, leaving millions of Russians? holiday plans up in the air.

 The lower house of parliament whizzed through the second and third readings of a bill today to introduce a new week of holiday at New Year, but the measure still needs approval from the upper house and the president.

 If the holiday package goes through, Russians will have the first 10 days of January off in 2005, including the traditional Russian Christmas on January 7.

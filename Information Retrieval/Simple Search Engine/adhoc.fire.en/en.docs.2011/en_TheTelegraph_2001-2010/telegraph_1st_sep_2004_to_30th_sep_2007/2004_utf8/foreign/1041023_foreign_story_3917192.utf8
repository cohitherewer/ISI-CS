 Howls greet Wilde musical 

 London, Oct. 22 (Reuters): For Oscar Wilde, there was no such thing as bad publicity.

 In life he thrived on notoriety and once famously said: ?There is only one thing worse in the world than being talked about and that is NOT being talked about.?

 He would, therefore, have thoroughly approved of the chorus of howls which greeted a musical about his life that closed in London after just one night ? one of the shortest runs on record.

 The musical deals with the last six years in the life of the Irish playwright who died aged 46 in a Paris hotel in 1900, impoverished and disgraced after a scandal surrounding his homosexual affair with the son of a British aristocrat.

 Critics slated the musical by former BBC radio disc jockey Mike Read, calling it ?bilge?, ?excruciating? and ?over two hours of leaden dross?. 

 The press night for the show was packed with Read?s showbusiness supporters like pop veterans Cliff Richard and Alvin Stardust.

 But the reviews proved so coruscating that just five of the 466 tickets were sold for the first public performance at the Shaw Theatre. Read said: ?I am naturally devastated at the turn of events. We had a fantastic West End cast and the reaction of the audience at the press night was terrific.?

 Undeterred, Read said he now hopes to stage his next musical YMCA ? a tribute to gay icons The Village People.

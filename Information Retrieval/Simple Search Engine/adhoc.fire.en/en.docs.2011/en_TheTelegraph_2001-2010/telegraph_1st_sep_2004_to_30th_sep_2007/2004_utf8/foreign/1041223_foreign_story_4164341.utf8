 Saudis recall envoy from Libya over plot

 Riyadh, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador in Tripoli today over what it called an ?atrocious? Libyan plot to assassinate the kingdom?s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Abdullah.

 The Saudi action is the latest sign of the near-collapse in ties between Saudi Arabia and the north African state, though Libya has denied the accusation.

 ?The procedure we took is to recall the Saudi ambassador from Libya and ask that Libya withdraws its ambassador,? foreign minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said. ?A memorandum will be handed over to the Libyan government today.? Prince Saud said the kingdom?s move was a restrained response to an ?atrocious? incident. A US court sentenced prominent Muslim activist Abdurahman al-Amoudi in October to 23 years jail for illegal financial dealings with Libya and for his role in the plot.

 Amoudi, founder of the American Muslim Council and head of the American Muslim Federation, said in court documents that he had contacted Saudi dissidents in London on behalf of some Libyan officials to kill the crown prince. 

 A Saudi diplomat had said that Mohamed Ismael, a Libyan intelligence officer, and his four-man team were organising the plot in the holy city of Mecca last year and that a bank account with $1 million had raised suspicion about them.

 He said the money trail led to the exposure of the team, after which Ismael fled to Egypt, which then extradited him to Saudi Arabia.

 The US, backed by Britain, asked the UN yesterday to freeze the assets of exiled Saudi dissident Saad al-Fagih, who Riyadh also accuses of involvement in the assassination plan.

 Prince Saud said the request was connected to the ?Libyan conspiracy ... the kingdom has suffered from?.

 Fagih heads the London-based Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, which says it aims to topple the monarchy by peaceful means. He said the US action was an attempt to appease the Saudi royal family.

 Saudi officials accuse Fagih of exploiting social and economic discontent in the kingdom to further his radical Islamic cause. His group recently called for anti-government demonstrations in the kingdom, but they failed to materialise after the authorities took sweeping security precautions.

 The US has listed Fagih as a ?specially designated global terrorist? and accused him of supporting al Qaida and its leader Osama bin Laden.

 The US investigation into the plot began as Washington and London were welcoming back into the international community their long-time adversary, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, after he decided to dismantle his weapons of mass destruction.

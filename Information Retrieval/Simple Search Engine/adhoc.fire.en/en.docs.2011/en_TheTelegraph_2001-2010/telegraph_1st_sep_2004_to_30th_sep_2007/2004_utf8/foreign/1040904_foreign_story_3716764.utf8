 Barbaric, says White House

 Moosic (Pennsylvania), Sept. 3 (Reuters): The White House today condemned the barbaric taking of hostages at a school in Russia and blamed the terrorists for the loss of life after Russian troops stormed the compound to free the parents, teachers and children.

 There is no justification for the taking of innocent life, and the barbaric nature of this terrorist act is despicable, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said in a statement.

 The responsibility for the tragic loss of life rests with the terrorists, McClellan said, adding: The US stands side-by-side with Russia in our global fight against terrorism.

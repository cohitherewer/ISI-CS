 Fine Print

 Lord it for ?30

 London, Dec. 13 (Reuters): The British aristocracy has long been an exclusive club but now anyone can become a Lord or Lady ? for as little as ?30.

 A raft of British websites are offering one square foot of the Glencairn Estate in northeast Scotland and, with it, access to the prestigious-sounding title of Lord/Laird and Lady of Glencairn.

 Buyagift.co.uk is offering the ?fun? title as the ?ideal gift for anyone who aspires to greatness? for ?29.99, which includes a deed of ownership, a map of the Glencairn estate and a card which proves their title.

 One incensed aristocrat, the Earl of Bradford, is fighting back at what he sees is a scam and is warning potential shoppers that buying titles is meaningless.

 Time titans

 Zurich (Reuters): Switzerland?s reputation 

 for punctuality survived intact on Monday after the first 

 major change to the train timetable in 20 years went like 

 clockwork. ?There have been no problems worth mentioning 

 so far on the first working day of the new timetable,? the 

 Swiss National Railways said. The first train under the 

 new ?Bahn 2000? timetable pulled in a mere 30 seconds late 

 to Berne on Sunday to the strains of a traditional Alpenhorn 

 pipe.

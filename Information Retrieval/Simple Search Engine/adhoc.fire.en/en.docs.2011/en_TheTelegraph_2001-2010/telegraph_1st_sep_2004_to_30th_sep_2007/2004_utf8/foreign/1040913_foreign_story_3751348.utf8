 Pak Taliban fighters freed

 Pul-i-Chakri, Afghanistan, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Hundreds of Pakistanis who fought alongside the Taliban against US-led forces after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US were released from an Afghan jail today after nearly three years as prisoners of war.

 The 368 prisoners, the last of more than 2,500 Pakistanis captured during the overthrow of the Taliban, were being driven by bus 250 km to the Pakistani town of Peshawar for screening by Pakistani authorities. 

 ?We are glad that their ordeal is finally over,? said Pakistani embassy third secretary Zafar Ali Khan. ?We have been trying to get access to them for a long time. We believe there has been no need to have kept them for so long in Afghan jails.?

 The prisoners, ranging in age from 22 to 60, were captured as the Taliban disintegrated in the face of the US-led invasion that drove the Islamic fundamentalists from power in November 2001. Many had been drawn to Afghanistan from madrasas in Pakistan, attracted by the puritanical brand of Islam that the Taliban espoused.

 ?The mullahs in my area said that as Muslims we should go to Afghanistan to fight a jihad,? 22-year-old Amir Khan, from Peshawar, said. ?I cannot deny this was my intention. I arrived in Afghanistan in October. I spent three days in Kabul and then went to Mazar-i-Sharif. I was captured the day after I arrived there.?

 Like many of his comrades, Khan said he had received no military training and insisted he was a religious student who had been ?misled? by the mullahs. 

 ?They sold us,? he said. ?We learnt later that for every 10 mujahideen (holy warriors) that they sent, they would receive Rs 5,000 ($100).?

 Mohammed Afriqi, a 30-year-old from Pakistan?s rugged North West Frontier Province, said he was among a group of 50 that surrendered to forces of Abdul Rashid Dostum in November 2001. ?They treated us very badly,? he said. ?Of those I was with, there are only about 20 left.?

 He was initially held at the notorious Shiberghan prison, where Dostum?s forces are accused of killing hundreds of prisoners or allowing them to die because of overcrowding.

 In September 2002, Dostum issued a formal statement acknowledging that ?approximately 200 prisoners died, but mostly of wounds suffered in the fighting, disease, suffocation, suicide and general weakness?. Afriqi showed Reuters scars on his chest he said came from wounds caused by being whipped with electric cable.

 The prisoners said the past 18 months of their captivity had been much better than the initial stage, and today they all looked clean, fit and healthy.

 Qaida militants

 Up to 10 people were killed in fierce fighting between Pakistani security forces and al Qaida-linked fighters today, taking the death toll to over 70 in one of the deadliest actions against the militants.

 Military spokesperson Major-General Shaukat Sultan said ?six to eight? people were killed in clashes with the security forces in the rugged South Waziristan tribal region near Afghan border where more than 60 militants died last week.

 He said the security forces also suffered a ?few? casualities but declined to provide details. A government official said two soldiers were killed and two others were wounded in the latest fighting.

 Witnesses said security forces backed by helicopter gunships and artillery attacked suspected hideouts of the militants in the mountains surrounding Laddha and nearby areas in South Waziristan.

 Laddha lies 50 km north of South Waziristan?s main town of Wana, which itself is 400 km northwest of Islamabad.

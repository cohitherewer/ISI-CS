 Love wins over red tape

 Hafsa Khan: Relieved

 Islamabad, Sept. 24 (Reuters): Love triumphed over red tape and diplomatic rivalry today as Pakistan granted citizenship to an Indian woman letting her live with her Pakistani husband.

 The announcement granting citizenship to Hafsa Khan came as President Pervez Musharraf met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New York to nudge forward a sluggish peace process between the South Asian rivals.

 ?Despite legal limitations, this was done in the best interests of the couple and in a spirit of goodwill,? foreign ministry spokesperson Masood Khan said.

 Hafsa, who hails from Kerala, was known as Divya Dayanandan before she converted to Islam to marry Aman Khan last year. But Pakistani authorities refused to give her citizenship and ordered her to leave the country on the expiry of her visa in March.

 Aman challenged the interior ministry order in the court and secured a stay, and today, the ministry issued a new order granting her Pakistani citizenship. 

 Hafsa, who gave birth to a boy last month and lives with her Pashtun husband in northwestern Pakistan, said she was finally happy after months of anxiety.

 ?I am feeling good and happy,? she said over telephone from Hoti, a village some 120 km northwest of Islamabad. The couple met and fell in love while they were studying medicine in Ukraine. 

 Meanwhile, Hafsa?s husband has been granted a visa by the Indian high commission to visit India alongwith her.

 Finn kids? cellphone fever vexes officials

 Helsinki, Oct. 11 (Reuters): 

 Finland?s consumer watchdog said today it had reprimanded 

 broadcasters for causing children to run up huge mobile 

 phone bills with interactive television games and chat programmes.

 In one case a child played a television game as though it were a computer game, sending enough text messages to get a bill of 1,200 euros ($1,489).

 Finland, home of mobile phone giant Nokia, has seen a recent boom in television games and competitions that can be entered by sending text messages. The country?s consumer ombudsman said numerous parents had complained about the fad. 

 The Nordic country has one of the world?s highest rates of mobile phone ownership and many children get their first handset when they begin school. The interactive programmes, which generally charge 1-2 euros per message, are often broadcast in the afternoon, targeting children when they are home alone after school.

 The watchdog said the price information given was not even clear enough to fulfil legal requirements for advertising to adults.

 Britain?s online advertising market hit ?266.8 million ($479.4 million) for the first half of 2004, putting the industry on track to surpass commercial radio in the next year, an industry trade group said today.

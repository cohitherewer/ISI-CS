 5 die in Dubai crash

 Dubai, Sept. 27 (Reuters): An Indian was among five killed when a steel mesh wall collapsed during the building of a multi-billion-dollar extension to Dubai?s international airport today, authorities said.

 ?During the preparation of a wall, a section of the reinforcement cage fell, trapping workers,? Dubai?s Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) said in a statement. ?Twelve workers were rescued and sent to hospitals with injuries while five succumbed in the incident.? The accident occurred at the site of a $4.1 billion expansion project for Dubai airport, one of the busiest in West Asia. 

 ?When it (the wall) collapsed, everyone ran for help. Some people were trapped under and were shouting,? a worker at the site said.

 Hundreds of workers, mostly Asians, were seen streaming off the construction site and were driven away in buses. Police sealed off the area as ambulances and police cars rushed in and out.

 Many workers were caught underneath the rubble and it was not immediately known if the rescue operation was over. The DCA said it was launching an investigation.

 Dubai, one of seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, is a rapidly growing regional trade and tourism hub. Dubai airport is a main transit route for Asia and the West, handling 18 million passengers last year.

 The expansion project, due to be completed by 2006, includes a new passenger terminal and two concourses that airport officials say will raise the number of passengers handled to 60 million by 2010.

 One of the main contractors is a venture between local firm Al Naboodah and international group Laing ? Rourke.

 Design consultants include Lebanon?s Dar al-Handassah and France?s Aeroports de Paris International, operator of Paris? Charles de Gaulle airport where a terminal partially collapsed in May.

 There have been several industrial accidents in recent years in the UAE, an oil-rich Gulf Arab state where foreigners form the bulk of the workforce. In May, six expatriate workers were killed when a one-storey building under construction collapsed.

 Bush in heal bid: Blair

 London, Nov. 5 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair said today President George W. Bush wants to use his second term to heal the bitter rift with Europe over the US-led invasion of Iraq.

 In a wide-ranging interview with the Times newspaper, Blair said he had spoken to Bush by telephone before his re-election victory and the President had suggested he wanted to build bridges with Europe. 

 ?I think he (Bush) does want to do it, yes,? Blair said. ?There was a real sense that in the second term the President has space and energy to develop an agenda that I hope can unify Europe and America.?

 Blair defended his support for Bush and called on the world to come to terms with his victory on Tuesday against Democratic challenger John Kerry. ?The election has happened, America has spoken, the rest of the world should listen,? Blair told the Times. ?It is important that America listens to the rest of the world too.?

 The US-led war in Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein created deep transatlantic divisions, with France and Germany leading the opposition.

 Blair, Washington?s staunchest ally in the Iraq war, has faced fierce criticism over his stance from members of his ruling Labour Party and has seen his approval ratings slip in the last two years.

 He rejected criticism that he has unquestioningly followed Bush, ignoring many in Britain who opposed the Iraq war. ?The attitude is that we do not really believe in this war on terror, so we should get recompense for going along with it,? Blair said. ?But I do not feel we have been acting out of blind loyalty or out of compulsion as an ally.?

 Britain has nearly 8,000 troops in Iraq and saw three of its soldiers killed in a suicide attack south of Baghdad yesterday.

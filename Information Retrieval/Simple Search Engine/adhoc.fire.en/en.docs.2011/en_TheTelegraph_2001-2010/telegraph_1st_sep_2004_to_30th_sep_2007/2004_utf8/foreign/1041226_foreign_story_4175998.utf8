 Brando estate claim

 Los Angeles, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Marlon Brando?s former business manager has filed a $3.5-million claim against the late actor?s estate, accusing the Oscar-winning Godfather star of sexual harassment and breach of contract.

 The claim, filed on Thursday in Los Angeles county superior court and made public yesterday, says Brando ?caused a hostile work environment due to his continuous acts of sexual harassment? toward Jo An Corrales during three years of employment.

 The creditor?s claim provides no further details of the harassment allegations, said Joel Pipes, a Newport Beach attorney representing Corrales. If the claim is rejected by the estate?s trustees, a lawsuit would be filed specifying the allegations, he said.

 Corrales, a resident of Kalama, Washington, also claims Brando reneged on their contract by removing her as co-executor of his will just days before his death.

 In addition to the fees she was entitled to receive as an executor, Corrales claims she was owed an estimated $500,000 in unpaid commissions she earned on residuals she had recovered on his behalf. The filing says that under her contract with Brando, Corrales was paid $5,000 a month.

 Corrales is one of numerous creditors who have filed claims against Brandos estate since probate, or the court-directed distribution, of his $21.6 million in assets began in August.

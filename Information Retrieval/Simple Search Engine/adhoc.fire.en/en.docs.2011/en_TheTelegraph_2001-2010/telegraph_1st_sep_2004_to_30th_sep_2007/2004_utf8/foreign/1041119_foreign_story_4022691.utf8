 Afghan treasure trove found

 GUY GUGLIOTTA

 Washington, Nov. 18: They 

 were priceless artefacts, and the Kabul Museum curators 

 wrapped them carefully, some of them in pink toilet paper, 

 others in newspaper, and put them in metal boxes. 

 Then government people, eight to 10 of them, signed pieces of paper that were glued to the locks. No box would be opened unless all the signers were there.

 That was a quarter-century ago, during the Soviet occupation. But the pact held through the warlordism of the late 1980s and 1990s, through the xenophobic rule of the Taliban and the American invasion.

 Many feared the treasures were lost forever, but yesterday archaeologist Fredrik T. Hiebert announced that a just-completed inventory showed that all but a handful had been recovered from hidden caches in Kabul?s presidential palace complex and other ?safe places.? The dramatic story of Afghanistan?s artefact recovery bears a striking similarity to the re-emergence of treasures spirited away by the staff of Iraq?s National Museum before the US invasion and the looting spree that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein.

 But while Iraq?s adventures are well documented, the Afghanistan story has faded with time: ?Twenty-five years ago, there was a museum director and a minister of culture? who ?realised that the museum was imperiled,? Hiebert said. ?They?re long gone ? disappeared or passed away.? When the boxes were recovered, ?nobody knew exactly what was in them.?

 Or where they had been for two decades, or when they had arrived at their final storage places, sometimes after enduring abuses that Hiebert could only guess at. ?Every time an object came out [of a box] there was a stab of fear, followed by a leap of joy,? Hiebert said. ?It was amazing these artefacts were in such stable condition. The boxes were dented... and there was evidence that animals had nested on them.?

 Hiebert, funded by the National Geographic Society and the National Endowment for the Humanities, was originally invited by the Afghan government to inventory a hoard of 2,000-year-old Bactrian gold jewellery and ornaments, found intact in a bank vault in Kabul?s presidential palace in 2003.

 Hiebert?s team finished this work ? 20,400 objects ? and announced the results in June. ?To our surprise, though,? Hiebert added, ?the museum director said: ?Won?t you look at these other boxes??? There were six of them, Hiebert said; then there were 20, then 80, then perhaps 120.

 In them they found more than 2,500 more objects, including 2,000 gold and silver coins depicting Afghan royalty back to 500 BC, a collection long regarded as looted and missing. Next came plaster medallions, ivory water goddesses and intricately carved ivory plaques from the 2,000-year-old Kushan culture.

 In all, the boxes contained 5,000 years of Afghanistan?s history as a pivotal way station on the ?Silk Road? between Europe and Asia.

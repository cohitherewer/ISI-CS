 Nepal agrees to festival ceasefire

 Kathmandu, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Nepal today accepted a truce declared by Maoist insurgents to allow the troubled country to celebrate the Dasain festival and said government troops would not launch offensive military action during the period.

 The government?s announcement came three days after the Maoists, fighting to replace constitutional monarchy with communist rule, said they would suspend ?all armed operations? from October 20 to 28 to mark the Dasain festival.

 ?There will be no offensive (action) from our side,? said Mohammed Mohsin, Nepal?s information and communication minister.

 ?If there is any sabotage against us and if anyone tries to disturb peace the government will be on high alert to maintain peace,? he said.

 The rebels have called for such ceasefires in the past, but there was no indication that the latest truce could lead to peace talks to end an eight-year rebellion that has killed more than 10,000 people in one of the world?s poorest nations.

 Political parties and human rights groups have been urging both the government and the guerrillas to declare a ceasefire and open talks to end the conflict that has wrecked the tourism-dependent economy.

 Analysts said the truce was unlikely to last beyond the festival period.

 ?If both sides stick to the no first attack principle there will be an effective ceasefire during the festival,? said Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of the widely read Nepali magazine, Samay.

 ?If the current position of truce is not extended beyond the festival period by both sides, the obvious meaning of that will be the resumption of armed conflict.?

 Violence has been unabated since the rebels walked out of peace talks in August last year and broke a seven-month truce.

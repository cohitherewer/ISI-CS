 Pak lifts ban for tribals in Qaida hunt

 Islamabad, Sept. 25 (Reuters): Pakistan today lifted economic penalties against a tribal region near the Afghan border in a bid to win help from the Pushtun tribes to track down al Qaida-linked militants hiding there.

 The penalties, which forced the closure of shops and the impounding of vehicles, were in place in the South Waziristan tribal region since May after the tribes there failed to evict foreign militants. 

 Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, while announcing removal of the ?economic blockade?, urged the tribesmen to evict foreign militants from the rugged region.

 ?Crush the elements of terror belonging to foreign countries as they are bent upon damaging the country and its image,? the official APP news agency quoted him as telling a gathering of 500 tribal elders in the northwestern city of Peshawar.

 Under a centuries-old tribal code prevalent in the semi-autonomous region, an entire tribe can be punished for any crime committed by its members as part of collective responsibility.

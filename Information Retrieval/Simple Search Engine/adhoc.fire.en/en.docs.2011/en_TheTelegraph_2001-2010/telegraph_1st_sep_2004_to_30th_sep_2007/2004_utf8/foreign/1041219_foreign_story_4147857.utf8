 Busloads of kids visit Jackson ranch

 Los Angeles, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Dozens of children visited Michael Jackson?s Neverland Valley Ranch yesterday at the invitation of the pop superstar who is awaiting trial on child molestation charges.

 Three buses containing mostly grade-school children and some parents as well as five minivans drove through the gates of Jackson?s sprawling estate in the foothills above Santa Barbara, California, Reuters photographers said.

 It was unclear where the children had come from. Jackson?s spokeswoman said on Thursday such invitations were regularly extended to groups including churches.

 A Reuters photographer said the children appeared excited and happy and that one mother said she expected to spend the day at Neverland, which has theme-park style rides, a miniature train and a small zoo.

 It was not known whether Jackson, 46, was at the event or would meet his guests. The entertainer is free on bail awaiting trial set for late January on a 10-count indictment of child molestation. Jackson has pleaded innocent.

 Prosecutors say that it was at Neverland, almost two years ago, that Jackson plied a boy with alcohol, engaged in ?lewd acts? with him, then conspired with his staff to cover up his misdeeds.

 Police have raided the ranch twice looking for evidence to use at trial.

 Arafat battles for life, burial row on

 Paris, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Yasser Arafat lay critically ill with liver failure today and his condition was not improving, a Palestinian official said, as Israel finalised plans to bury the Palestinian President in the Gaza Strip. Arafat?s subordinates decided in his absence to enforce a law and order plan in Palestinian areas.

 Arafat wants to be buried in Jerusalem, holy both to Muslims and Jews, but Israeli officials refuse to bury him in land which Israel says is part of its indivisible capital.

 His deputy Mahmoud Abbas and Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie plan to travel to Paris tomorrow to visit the hospitalised President, Palestinian officials said today.

 Aides gave conflicting reports about the 75-year-old leader?s health and concern grew about who will succeed him and the fate of West Asian peace efforts that have stalled.

 Some aides said he was not in a coma. Others said his condition was so bad that he might be moved to Cairo, from where he could be flown home more quickly if he died. ?He has liver failure. His condition is not improving,? said a Palestinian official. ?One option being considered is moving him to Cairo.?

 The official said any decision to move Arafat could be taken only by the Palestinian leadership. 

 A row is brewing over where to bury the man who personifies the struggle to establish a Palestinian state, a dream Arafat has not fulfilled amidst a four-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. ?The defence establishment has completed preparations for an Arafat funeral in Gaza,? political sources quoted Israeli defence minister Shaul Mofaz as saying.

 In Ramallah, leaders decided to carry out a plan to restore law and order in the West Bank and Gaza. It calls for more security forces to be deployed. Militants will be banned from carrying arms except when confronting Israel and stopped from intervening in local disturbances.

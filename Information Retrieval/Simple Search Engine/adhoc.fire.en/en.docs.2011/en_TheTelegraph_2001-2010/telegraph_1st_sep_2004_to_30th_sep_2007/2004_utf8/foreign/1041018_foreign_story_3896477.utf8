 Kerry narrows Bush lead

 Washington, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Democratic challenger John Kerry cut President George W. Bush?s lead to 2 points with just over two weeks to go before the Novermber 2 election, according to a Reuters/Zogby poll released today.

 The situation in Iraq, a key election issue, worsened today as gunmen ambushed a minibus in Karbala carrying nine Iraqi police recruits home from a training course in Jordan, killing all of them. US jets bombed Falluja and troops fought rebels accused of shielding foreign fighters led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, America?s top foe in Iraq.

 Bush led Kerry by 46 per cent to 44 per cent in the latest three-day tracking poll of the closely contested race for the White House. The President led the Massachusetts senator by 48 per cent to 44 per cent the previous day. 

 ?The third debate is now registering among voters and Kerry had a good day,? pollster John Zogby said.

 The new tracking poll found Kerry regained a good lead among 18- to 29-year-old voters and consolidated his advantage among Hispanics. Bush and Kerry were tied among Roman Catholics, a group Kerry, himself a Catholic, must win to capture the White House, Zogby said.

 The poll of 1,211 likely voters was taken from Thursday through Saturday.

 Pak missile test before talks

 Islamabad, Oct. 12 (Reuters): Pakistan test-fired an intermediate-range, nuclear-capable ballistic missile today as part of efforts to boost defences but the test was not a show of strength for India, the military said.

 The test came at the start of two days of talks between Pakistani and Indian border officials in Chandigarh, their second meeting this year since regular contacts were revived to discuss frontier issues.

 Pakistani military spokesperson Major-General Shaukat Sultan said the missile test was meant to ?validate its design parameters?. 

 ?Our missile test is not meant to send any signal to anyone,? he said.

 ?We are happy that the peace process is going on and we hope it will produce positive results,? he said of the talks with India.

 The Pakistani military said Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz witnessed the test of the Hatf V, a type of Ghauri missile with a range of 1,500 km ? capable of hitting most Indian cities and which can carry a payload of 900 kg. 

 It said the test had been successful.

 Death term for Dhaka jail killers

 Dhaka, Oct. 20 (PTI): Three former army officers were today sentenced to death by a Bangladesh court for murdering four leaders inside Dhaka Central Jail after the assassination of the country?s founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a coup in 1975, bringing to end a three-decade-old case.

 Judge Motiur Rahman of the Dhaka district and sessions court delivered the twice-deferred verdict at a crowded court room amid tight security around the court complex.

 The judge ordered three junior military officers to be hanged, while 12 people were sentenced to life imprisonment and five others, including four prominent politicians ? former ministers Taheruddin Thakur, Obaidur Rahman, a ruling party legislator, Shah Moazzem Hossain and Nurul Islam Monjur ? were acquitted. The fifth is a retired army major, now serving in the foreign ministry.

 The three junior army officers were on the run and had been tried in absentia.

 The men were accused of the murders of Syed Nazrul Islam, acting president of the Bangladesh government in exile, his Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmed and ministers Monsur Ali and A.H.M. Quamruzzaman on November 3, 1975. 

 The belated trial started in 1996, when the Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina, now main Opposition leader, came to power. 

 The verdict was originally scheduled to be delivered on September 7, but has been deferred twice ? first as the judge was ill and a second time as it was put back for an extra hearing.

 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of Sheikh Hasina, and most of their family members were killed in a coup in August 1975. Judge Rahman in his 274-page said: ?The conspiracy theory against some of the accused could not be proved.?

 ?I think the faulty investigation can affect the case seriously,? he said.

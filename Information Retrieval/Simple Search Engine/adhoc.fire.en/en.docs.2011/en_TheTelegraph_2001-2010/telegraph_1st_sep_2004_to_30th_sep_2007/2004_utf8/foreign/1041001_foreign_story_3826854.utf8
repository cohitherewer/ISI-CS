 Britons seek happiness over fame

 Princess Diana

 London, Sept. 30 (Reuters): 

 Britons have little interest in becoming famous or rich, 

 with over half wishing instead for happiness for their children 

 and world peace, according to a survey today.

 The poll of 1,000 people, commissioned by Disney, concluded that just four percent of Britons would choose fame as one of their top three wishes. 

 Having more money attracted 37 per cent of people. But that was surpassed by the 70 per cent who named happiness and success for their children as one of their top three wishes and the 56 per cent who wanted an end to war and poverty.

 David Beckham also ranked low among Brits as the one personality, living or dead, they would like to meet. Jesus Christ, Princess Diana and war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill formed the top three.

 Ridge quits Bush team

 Washington, Dec. 1 (Reuters): US homeland security secretary Tom Ridge, who headed President George W. Bush?s efforts to build up domestic security after the September 11 attacks, resigned yesterday.

 In the latest shake-up of Bush?s second-term cabinet, Ridge, who oversaw the creation of a massive new department and was charged with trying to prevent another terror attack, announced his decision at a news conference after submitting his resignation to the President. 

 ?The President has given me an extraordinary opportunity to serve my country in this incredible period since September 11, 2001,? said Ridge, 59.

 Ridge told Bush he would stay in his position until February or until his successor is confirmed.

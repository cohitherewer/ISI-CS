 Fine Print

 Royal ruckus

 London, Dec. 23 (Reuters): A cousin of Britain?s Queen Elizabeth was banned from driving for six months today after he was convicted of speeding.

 The Duke of Gloucester, president of an organisation that promotes safer driving, admitted doing 70 mph in a 60 mph area in his Ford car in Cambridgeshire in August.

 The Institute of Advanced Motorists said the Duke would lose his membership as a result of the ban. But officials have yet to decide whether the 60-year-old will have to step down as the organisation?s president. The Duke was banned after being convicted of his fourth speeding offence in three years. Magistrates in Ely also fined him ?60 and ordered him to pay ?35 costs.

 Food alarm

 Nicosia (Reuters): Food lovers in Cyprus 

 could face a glum holiday because nothing is good enough 

 to eat any more. Authorities have pulled some brands of 

 nuts, dried fruit, honey and rose water from the market 

 because they are tightening quality controls to comply with 

 EU standards. Many of the foodstuffs are key ingredients 

 in seasonal delicacies and many cooks fear they will have 

 to ditch what they have baked for Christmas and get their 

 rolling pins out again. 

 False heat

 Helsinki (Reuters): A squad of fire-fighters accidentally set their own sauna ablaze on Wednesday but could not extinguish the fire despite their training. The sauna, at Lappi, 222 km west of Helsinki, was destroyed despite the volunteer fire-fighters? efforts.

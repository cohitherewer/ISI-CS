 UK works on sop to Muslims

 AMIT ROY

 London, Dec. 26: The department of inland revenue in Britain was today said to be considering an amendment to the law on inheritance to make it possible for British Muslims to pass on a husband?s estate to more than one wife free of tax.

 This does not mean the state is about to recognise polygamy ? in any case, the number of Muslims in Britain with more than one wife, though unknown, is certainly very small. 

 However, the Labour government is keen to accommodate orthodox Muslims on selected and specific aspects of the Shariat.

 One area where this has already happened is in the introduction of ?Islamic mortgages?, since orthodox Muslims are not supposed to either charge or pay interest.

 An arrangement has been worked out which allows the lender to buy the house, with ownership transferred to the purchaser only at the end of the repayment period.

 In a society where all the old rules on relationships are being rewritten, the government wants to be seen to be bending over backwards to be sympathetic to the UK?s 1.5 million Muslims. After all, it will not be long before half the births in the UK will be to couples who are not married but may be in long-term relationships.

 Muslim groups, negotiating with the inland revenue, have argued with some force that the (Christian) establishment should not negotiate with Muslims from a position of moral superiority.

 Although Britain is not prepared to introduce the Shariat for members of the Islamic faith ? many Muslim women will vehemently oppose this for a start ? some concessions may be granted on specific issues such as tax laws on inheritance.

 The National Audit Office recently concluded that the tax system inadvertently penalised devout Muslims. An inquiry into inheritance laws found that devout Muslims were not able to take full advantage of British tax laws, which allows spouses to inherit an entire estate from their husband or wife tax-free. 

 By contrast, for Muslim families who observe the Shariat, the woman receives only an eighth share of her husband?s estate tax free. The rest of the estate above the British inheritance tax threshold of ?265,000 is taxed at 40 per cent.

 In some ways, changing the tax law will be of benefit to older wives. It is the practice among a section of Bangladeshi men in their fifties and even older to divorce their first wife, return to Bangladesh to pick up a second very much younger wife and start a new family back in England.

 Ahmad Thomson of the Association of Muslim Lawyers told the Sunday Times: ?Wives and immediate children should be exempt from inheritance tax. If the government is family friendly they should change a tax which is unfairly hitting minority religious values.? 

 Sadiq Khan, a Muslim community leader, said: ?I am pleased to see the Inland Revenue applying common sense to the application of Islamic law on uncontroversial matters such as inheritance. There are some other uncontroversial areas of Islam law which could easily be applied to the legal system we have in the UK.? 

 The change in position by the Revenue emerged in correspondence from its capital taxes technical group sent to Haroon Rashid, an expert in inheritance tax planning at the law firm, BK Solicitors.

 John W. Murray, an official, wrote on November 29 this year in reply to a question on how to calculate tax on a will under Islamic law: ?It is a question of Islamic law whether or not this is the case. If there is any authority that you could direct us to then we would gladly consider it.?

 A Treasury spokesman said: ?We keep all areas of the tax system under review, and we are willing to consider all representations put to us on how to ensure the tax system operates in a fair, simple and consistent way.?

 Kim rues lack of mature roles

 Kim Basinger

Berlin, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Kim Basinger said 

actresses get the short end of the stick once the ageing process sets in and finds 

it a sad fact of life that Hollywood has so little interest in films featuring 

mature women.

 ?It depresses me that there are so few roles written for grown-up women,? said Basinger, 50, in an interview with Germany?s Welt am Sonntag newspaper.

 The American, in an interview to promote her film The Door in the Floor, said she stopped counting how many times she was told that she was ?too old? for a role she wanted.

 ?For every woman in this branch like Meryl Streep or Susan Sarandon, who thanks to their talent are able to keep their career continuing, there are a dozen well-known actresses older than 40 who cant get any roles any more,? Basinger said. She received an Oscar for her role in LA Confidential.

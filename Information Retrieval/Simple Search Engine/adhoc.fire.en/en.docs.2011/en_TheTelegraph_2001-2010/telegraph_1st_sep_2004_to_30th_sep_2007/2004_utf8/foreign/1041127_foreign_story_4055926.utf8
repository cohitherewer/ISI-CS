 Man stabs 8 children

 Beijing, Nov. 26 (Reuters): 

 A man broke into a Chinese school dormitory and stabbed 

 eight children to death in their sleep, the latest in a 

 wave of school attacks in China, the official Xinhua news 

 agency said today.

 The middle school students were sleeping at the Ruzhou No.2 Senior Middle School in Pingdingshan in the central province of Henan last night when the attack happened, it said. ?The killer escaped after the killing and is still at large,? Xinhua said. ?Local police said that they are trying their best to hunt down the suspect.? It was the sixth attack on schoolchildren in just four months, prompting schools in Beijing to recruit professional guards to protect students.

 Nepal ambush kills 10 soldiers

 Kathmandu, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Nepal?s Maoist rebels ambushed an army patrol in the east of the country today, killing 10 soldiers, an army officer said, in the latest outbreak of violence in the revolt-torn Himalayan kingdom.

 At least 70 people have been killed in Nepal since last week as guerrillas escalate attacks before a January 13 deadline, set by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, for them to join peace talks.

 The new attack took place at Mude village in Sindhupalchowk district, a Maoist stronghold 100 km east of Kathmandu.

 Details of the ambush in the remote village were sketchy.

 ?We have lost 10 of our men,? the officer said. ?The Maoists may have also suffered some losses in the gun battle that erupted after the ambush.?

 The rebels have been fighting since 1996 to topple the country?s constitutional monarchy and establish communist rule. More than 10,000 people have been killed in violence so far in the country sandwiched between India and China.

 The insurgents have rejected Deuba?s deadline for talks. Deuba set the deadline last month and vowed to hold national elections by April if the Maoists failed to meet the deadline.

 The rebels oppose elections under the present system. Instead, they want a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution to decide the future of the monarchy.

 Today?s attack came as global rights groups said defenders of human rights in Nepal face grave threats from both the Maoists and security forces.

 Nepali journalists, lawyers and local rights activists were being targetted as they tried to prevent rights abuses, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists said in a report.

 ?Human rights defenders have been killed, detained under anti-terrorist legislation, abducted, tortured and threatened, and the offices of human rights organisations have been raided,? they said in the joint report.

 ?Human rights defenders in Nepal play an indispensable role in protecting people against the appalling abuses committed by both the security forces and Maoist insurgents,? said Ingrid Massage, Asia director at Amnesty International.

 ?Attacks on human rights defenders not only violate their rights, but also greatly increase the vulnerability of all Nepalis,? she said.

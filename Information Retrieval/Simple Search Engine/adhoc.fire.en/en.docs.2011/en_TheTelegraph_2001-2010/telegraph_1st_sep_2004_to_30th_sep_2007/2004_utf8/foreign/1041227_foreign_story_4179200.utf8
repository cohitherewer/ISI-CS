 Hamas gains in municipal elections

 Ramallah, Dec. 26 (Reuters): Hamas militants defeated the mainstream Palestinian movement Fatah in nine of 26 local elections, results showed today, in a foretaste of challenges confronting emerging moderate leader Mahmoud Abbas.

 Hamas? standing in polls about national leadership has declined since Yasser Arafat?s death amid growing weariness with violence and a drive by the US-favoured Abbas to revive peace talks aimed at Palestinian statehood on Israeli-occupied land.

 But Hamas? solid performance in its first foray into electoral politics, and the first Palestinian grassroots vote since 1976, signalled discontent with corruption and chaos in Fatah that Abbas must overcome to establish his authority. 

 Abbas received boosts when 560 prominent Palestinians called in front-page newspaper adverts for an end to violence while Israel approved plans to pull back forces to help Palestinians vote in a January 9 presidential poll he is widely expected to win.

 ?The election is of supreme importance in establishing a (Palestinian) leadership with which we hope to move forward on the road map,? Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said, citing an international peace plan stymied by persistent violence. 

 In another gesture to Abbas, Israel said it would free tomorrow 113 of more than 7,000 Palestinians jailed as suspected militants. Abbas has made prisoner release part of his campaign platform to encourage militants to lay down arms.

 A tally announced by the Palestinian Authority?s Supreme Council for Local Elections showed Hamas scored won nine West Bank council races on December 23 against 16 for Fatah. Fatah won by narrow margins in two districts while the rivals tied for control of one municipality.

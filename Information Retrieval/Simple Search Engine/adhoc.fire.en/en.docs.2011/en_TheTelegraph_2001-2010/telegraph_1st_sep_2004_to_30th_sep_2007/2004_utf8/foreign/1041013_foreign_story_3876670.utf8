 Lahore, Oct. 12 (Reuters): Pakistani police have arrested a Sunni militant wanted in connection with more than a dozen sectarian murders and several bombings, intelligence officials said today.

 They said two other suspects were arrested in Lahore yesterday by intelligence teams probing Sunday?s suicide bombing of a Shia mosque, which killed five people including the bomber.

 Khawaja Muhammad Waseem, a member of the outlawed Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (Army of Jhangvi), was arrested in the small city of Khairpur in the southern province of Sindh four days ago, an intelligence official said.

 ?It is quite a significant catch,? said the official, who asked not to be named. ?He is wanted for the murder of more than a dozen people and was also involved in bomb blasts.? Names of the suspects arrested in Lahore have not been released.

 Police there have also been trying to determine the identity of the suicide bomber, whose head was found at the site of the attack, the latest in a spate of religious violence that has fuelled fears of a flare-up in sectarian violence between minority Shia and majority Sunnis.

 A total of 79 people have died in sectarian violence so far this month. The Lahore bombing came a day after the assassination of a leading pro-Taliban cleric, Mufti Jameel Ahmed Khan, and an associate in Karachi on Saturday and a car bomb blast on Thursday that killed at least 42 radical Sunnis in Multan.

 The Multan bombing followed a suicide bombing at a crowded Shia mosque that killed 30 in the city of Sialkot on October 1.

 Shias number about 15 per cent of Pakistan?s predominantly Sunni population of 150 million. Militants from the two Muslim communities have been waging a bloody campaign of attacks on each other for years, ostensibly over doctrinal differences dating almost to the birth of Islam.

 Analysts say President Pervez Musharraf?s administration has itself to blame for the recent violence after failing to follow through on vows to crack down on militant groups, which have been used by successive governments as policy tools against India and in Afghanistan.

 Musharraf outlawed five Sunni and two Shia militant groups after joining the US-led war on terror following the September 11 attacks in 2001. However, the key groups have simply resurfaced under new names since the ban. 

 Hostage crisis

 A council of Pakistani tribesmen today sought to secure the release of two Chinese engineers held hostage by al Qaida-linked militants as the government said it did not rule out the use of force to free them.

 Hundreds of Mehsud tribesmen gathered at Barwand, a village about 15 km north of the area of the remote South Waziristan tribal region, near the Afghan border, where the Chinese were being held.

 The tribesmen sent cousins of Abdullah Mehsud, the leader of the kidnappers, to fetch him for talks, but were unable to find him, one of the cousins, Alam Zeb, reported back to the meeting.

 ?We waited for him for a long time, but the meeting could not take place,? he said.

 However, Zeb said the cousins had made contact with three of Abdullah?s supporters and agreed to send elders to meet hi, who would report to the council tomorrow.

 Meet the male Bridget Joneses

 - More 

 men likely to stay single 

 Leave me alone: 

 A scene from Bridget Jones? Diary 

 Diary entry for November 7: Calories: 2,500 (pizza and curry). Alcohol: 20 units (10 pints). Weight: 14 stone. Women back to flat: one (mum to pick up washing).

 Move over, Bridget Jones, 30-something singletons are much more likely to be men than women. New research from Edinburgh University on the growing phenomenon of solo living has revealed that between the ages of 25 and 44, almost 20 per cent of men live alone, compared to just 6 per cent of women.

 Unlike their female counterparts, the vast majority of them have never been married. The findings suggest that the media has missed a trick with its portrayal of single women as pioneers of the no-ties life with characters such as Bridget Jones and Carrie Bradshaw of Sex and the City. Another Jones film, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, opens in Britain this week.

 Adam Smith, one of the authors of the report from the university?s centre for research on families and relationships, said: ?We already know that solo living is on the increase and are used to the idea of it being young women. In reality, it is men who are making up most of the single households.?

 The reasons for the trend are not clear, according to the researchers. One suggestion is that while Bridget Jones was desperate to find a husband, today?s solo-living men are afraid of commitment. 

 ?We don?t know if living alone is through choice or necessity,? said Smith. ?Many of these men have never married and could be examples of men avoiding commitment. It could also be a reflection of the demands of careers which take up more and more time and necessitate flexibility.?

 Well-documented superior communication skills and the female fondness for intimacy could also mean that more women avoid living alone. 

 ?It could be that women are more likely to live in shared housing, perhaps clinging on to their student days, and choose to live with one or more friends,? said Smith. ?This would fit in with the increasing number of single people clubbing together so they can afford to buy a place.?

 Jason Hart, a 34-year-old graphic designer from Hertfordshire, has lived on his own for six years. ?I lived in a shared flat when I was a student and didn?t really want to go back to that so I aimed to buy a place of my own. I think the benefits are that you can be yourself and don?t have to compromise.?

 ?For instance, the house is quite old and I?ve done it up myself and it doesn?t have central heating. I can imagine that if someone else was here they would be complaining it was too cold.?

 Hart said he was happy with his own company and rarely felt lonely. ?I do a lot of stuff and don?t spend that much time at home anyway,? he said.

 While the stereotype of the bachelor who cannot boil an egg and still takes his washing home to his mother may be outdated, recent research by Warwick University found living alone was, in fact, detrimental to health.

 Bridget Jones? taste for booze and ice cream was mirrored by the study that found that singletons drank more than married people because they socialised more and tended to skip meals such as breakfast or eat on the go.

 Tony Reynolds, a 36-year-old website writer who, by his own admission, ?likes a fag and a few pints?, said that renting his own flat recently had curbed his excesses. While the 36-year-old said that he was getting ?too old and grumpy? to have flatmates, he would not rule out living with someone special in the future .

 ?Good God no. I just think all my male friends who live alone do it through choice,? he said. ?They may be on the look out but they are perhaps more choosy than previous generations who had social pressure on them to settle down. We are fussy buggers.?

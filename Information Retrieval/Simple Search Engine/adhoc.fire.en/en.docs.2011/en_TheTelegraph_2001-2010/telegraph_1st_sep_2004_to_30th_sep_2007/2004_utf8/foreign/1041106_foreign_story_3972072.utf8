 Pak court outlaws ?Hindu? dowry

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Nov 5: Pakistan?s Supreme Court today ruled that giving large dowries and holding mehndi ceremonies before the marriage were of Hindu origin and have nothing to do with the Islamic concept of wedding.

 Terming the custom of giving dowry and the lavish spending on weddings ?exploitative? as it put pressure on the middle class, the court ordered that such practices must be stopped immediately.

 ?Ostentatious displays and wasteful expenditures on marriage ceremonies are exploitative customs, which not only add to the miseries of the people belonging to middle and lower middle classes but also put their existence at stake,? the court said in its judgment on an application challenging various provisions of an executive decree prohibiting wasteful expenses on marriages.

 Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif?s government had first introduced the law in 1997 to discourage the display of wealth in weddings.

 However, a vast majority of people, particularly those linked to the hotel industry and wedding halls and restaurant business, opposed the law on the ground that it would adversely affect their livelihood. 

 The law, which had ruled that no meals except soup and only soft drinks could be served at marriage ceremonies, was re-introduced in 2000. 

 The court said the custom of giving or receiving dowry was also a show of wealth and must also come to an end. ?Other functions (of Hindu origin) such as rasm-e-hina (mehndi) took place before the actual marriage and have nothing to do with the Islamic concept of marriage,? the court said.

 Base attacked

 Assailants fired three rockets at a Pakistani military base in a restive tribal region, injuring one civilian, officials said today. 

 Two rockets slammed inside the base in Wana, the main town in south waziristan, late last night, and a third landed in a nearby field, an intelligence official said on condition of anonymity.

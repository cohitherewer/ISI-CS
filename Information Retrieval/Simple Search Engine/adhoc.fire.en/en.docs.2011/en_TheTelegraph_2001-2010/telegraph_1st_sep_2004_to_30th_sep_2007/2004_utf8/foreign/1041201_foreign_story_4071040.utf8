 Minnie back to first love

 RASHOD D. OLLISON

 Minnie Driver

 Los Angeles, Nov. 30: Minnie Driver is in a fog ? mentally. The actor-singer is calling from her tour bus in England, where she?s promoting her debut, Everything I?ve Got in My Pocket. The days, the weeks have all been a blur so far. 

 ?I?m serious. I really don?t know what day it is,? she says in her bright British accent. 

 ?Wednesday,? someone exclaims in the background. 

 ?Thank you,? Driver shouts back. ?That?s my keyboard player.? 

 The road work has been gruelling. But the performer is excited about the fruition of a lifelong dream: to make music. The new album, which received mixed reviews upon release last month, may be a bit of a surprise to those who know Driver largely for her work in the movies. However, this music thing is no whim. 

 She has been writing songs since age 15, which is also around the time she started singing in jazz clubs in London. By the early Nineties, Driver landed a development deal with Island Records. 

 But after her acclaimed performance in Circle of Friends, a 1995 romantic drama, the Los Angeles-based artist shifted her focus. And when she received an Oscar nomination for her role in 1997?s Good Will Hunting, it looked as if Driver would never return to her first love. 

 ?This is something I?ve always wanted to do,? she says. ?It was a matter of finding the time to do it, to really concentrate on making an album. With the acting and singing, I don?t separate it, really. When I?m acting, I ask myself what is the most honest portrayal of this role. And it?s the same with music and when I?m writing: How can I honestly get the feeling across?? 

 Judging from Driver?s languid approach on the album?s 11 tracks, she takes her time. The songs kind of drizzle over you. After a while, the singer?s breathy vocals and the gauzy, glacially paced acoustic-folk music begin to blend.

 ?Metaphorically, this album is what I?ve got,? Driver says. ?The music is what I?ve got to offer now. There?s no way I could have been promoting this record and doing a movie.?

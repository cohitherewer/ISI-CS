 NYPD twist to comic Bandidas

(From top) Hayek, Cruz and Zahn

New York, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Steve Zahn is 

loading up his six-shooter to join Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz in the comic 

western Bandidas for 20th Century Fox and co-directors Joachim Roenning 

and Espen Sandberg.

 Shooting on the feature begins next month in Mexico.

 Zahn is slated to play a New York police investigator sent to Mexico to track a string of bank holdups. 

 But he winds up kidnapped by bank robbers (Hayek and Cruz).

 Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen penned the Bandidas script. 

 Bandidas brings together Zahn and Cruz, who star together in the upcoming Paramount action-adventure film Sahara.

 Zahn recently appeared in Bull?s Eye Entertainment?s Employee of the Month and Lions Gate Films? Shattered Glass.

 The movie is set in the 1880?s and tells the story of Sara (Hayek) and Maria (Cruz), who are enemies at first due to the difference in their social classes, but then join forces as bank robbers.

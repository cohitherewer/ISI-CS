 Bush?s terror chief quits

 Washington, Nov. 6 (Reuters): President George W. Bush?s point man for international terrorism policy has quit several months after botching a major report, the most well-known figure known to have resigned since Bush?s re-election.

 Cofer Black, the US state department?s coordinator for counter-terrorism, caused an embarrassment this year when the administration had to revise a faulty report he oversaw that had been used to argue Bush was winning the war on terrorism. The report underestimated the number of people who died from international terrorism last year.

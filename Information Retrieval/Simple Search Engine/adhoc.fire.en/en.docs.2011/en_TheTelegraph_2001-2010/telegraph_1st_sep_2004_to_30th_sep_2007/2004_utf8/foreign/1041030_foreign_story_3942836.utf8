 Crisis shadow on EU constitution

 Rome, Oct. 29 (Reuters): European Union leaders signed the bloc?s first constitution in a glittering ceremony today but their celebration of unity was marred by uncertainty over its ratification and turmoil over the stalled European Commission.

 The leaders said they would use private talks after the signature to discuss a standoff with the European Parliament that has blocked the entry into office of a new EU executive.

 German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder played down talk of a political crisis, saying he expected a revamped commission would be approved within a couple of weeks. Jose Manuel Barroso?s 25-member team had been due to take office next Monday.

 The lavish pageant was staged on the Capitoline Hill in the same Renaissance hall where the EU?s six founding nations signed the original Treaty of Rome in March 1957, launching the most successful enterprise in European unification.

 ?Never in history have we seen an example of nations voluntarily deciding to exercise their sovereign powers jointly in the exclusive interest of their peoples, thus overcoming age-old impulses of rivalry and distrust,? Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said in a speech.

 The leaders agreed the constitution in June after months of haggling, hoping to usher in a period of greater stability and better governance for the newly enlarged 25-nation club with 450 million citizens.

 It provides for a long-term president of the European Council of national leaders, a first foreign minister, simpler majority decision-making on most issues, more powers for parliament and eventually a smaller commission.

 But all member states must first ratify the treaty ? a daunting challenge with at least eight, including Eurosceptical Britain, planning to hold referendums over the next two years.

 Outgoing commission president Romano Prodi, who is staying on in a caretaker capacity, warned that signature ?does not mean we have crossed the finishing line? and ratification could not be taken for granted.

 Winning public backing across Europe will not be made any easier by the messy political reality, with incoming commission president Barroso trying to persuade national governments to come up with a changed team acceptable to the restive parliament. Barroso withdrew his first line-up on Wednesday to avoid a humiliating parliamentary defeat because of hostility to the Italian nominee for the justice portfolio, Rocco Buttiglione, over his conservative Roman Catholic views on gays and marriage.

 Flowers, fan mail for Clinton

 Bill Clinton: Heart-stopper 

New York, Sept. 5: All at once the citys most 

famous hospital patient, former President Clinton received flowers, balloons, 

phone calls and thousands of e-mailed get-well wishes and advice on Saturday on 

his upcoming heart bypass surgery. 

 Clinton, 58, was hospitalised on Friday at New York-Presbyterian Hospitals Columbia University Medical Center after an angiogram showed clogged coronary arteries. 

 He was in good spirits on Saturday,people close to the Clinton family said. 

 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat from New York, and the couples daughter, Chelsea Clinton, arrived separately at the hospital in Washington Heights on Saturday afternoon, entering through a side door. 

 Neither spoke to reporters. 

 Doctors have not specified what type of bypass surgery Clinton will undergo. 

 But, because the angiogram showed multi-vessel blockages, a triple or quadruple bypass is likely. 

 Democratic Party chairman Terry McAuliffe, who spoke to Clinton on Friday night, said the former President is expected to have surgery as early as Monday but probably Tuesday. 

 I thanked him for getting the Democrats back on the front page and he told me thats about as far as hes willing to go, McAuliffe said. 

 I said I needed him out on the campaign trail as soon as possible, and he said as soon as he recuperates hell be ready to go. 

 Democratic presidential candidate Senator John Kerry also spoke to both Clintons on Friday night, spokeswoman Allison Dobson said. He wished them well and told them that his thoughts and prayers are with them, she said. 

 Outside the hospital on Saturday morning, the extra security meant that Jean Fields-Davis had to walk an extra half-block to get in to visit a relative. 

 Its not an inconvenience. He is a great President, said Fields-Davis, of Parkchester, who voted for Clinton in 1992 and 1996. This is not a good time for him to leave us. I wish him well because we need him.

 Rufino Rodriguez, 57, of Norwalk, Conn., stood outside the hospital holding a laminated card hed made showing his own triple bypass procedure a few years ago. 

 The whole world is praying for him, Rodriguez said.

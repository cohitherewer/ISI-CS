 Chocolates cut to size

 NIC FLEMING

 Confectionery companies have agreed to phase out many king-size chocolate bars as part of the campaign against obesity.

 Production of the larger versions of Mars, Snickers, Crunchie and Boost bars, weighing up to 100g will cease next year.

 The concession is part of the food and drinks industry?s efforts to persuade the government that tough new laws on issues such as labelling, advertising to children and school vending machines are unnecessary.

 A department of health White Paper is expected to set out proposals later this year. It follows the House of Commons Health Select Committee?s warnings in May that Britain is facing an obesity ?epidemic? and accusations that food companies aggressively market and advertise sweet and fatty junk foods to children. Britain has the fastest growing obesity problem in the world.

 The Food and Drink Federation will publish its manifesto for food and health today, setting out the industry?s position in the debate. 

 On portion sizes, one of seven key policy areas discussed in the document, members have committed themselves to ?exploring new approaches for individual portion sizes to help reduce over-consumption?.

 Cadbury Trebor Bassett said yesterday sales of king-size Crunchie and Boost bars would cease at the end of next February.

 In the FDF manifesto, the company commits itself to ?phase out all non-segmented/non portioned king-size bars and discontinue the king-size nomenclature?.

 A Cadbury spokesman said: ?It?s down to all sections of society ? the government, the public, food manufacturers ? to play their part. This is our contribution.?

 Masterfoods said it had decided to phase out king-size Mars and Snickers, weighing 85g and 100g respectively, and replace them with bars with at least two portions next year.

 Michael Jenkins, the external affairs director at Masterfoods, said: ?Our king-size bars that come in one portion will be changed so they are shareable or can be consumed on more than one occasion.?

 Wisdom, saucy pictures in Klum book

 Klum

 New York, Dec. 4 (Reuters): When supermodel Heidi Klum decided to write a book, she didn?t want it to be just a picture book. She wanted to offer some words of wisdom.

 Of course the book, Heidi Klum?s body of knowledge, does have pictures ? 400 of them to be precise, including a number of nude shots and plenty of the German temptress clad in the underwear brand that launched her on the way to super-stardom.

 But that?s not the point of the book. Among eight ?rules of model behaviour? Klum outlines are such maxims as: ?You have to want it, baby? and ?Have a blast while it lasts.? And there are tips on getting ahead at work and getting better sex ? Heidi?s advice: ?Become the fantasy.? ?I wanted to write something because I thought I had so many great stories to tell and I had so many pictures and I didn?t want to just do a picture book,? Klum said.

 ?It?s for guys who want to know more about girls and for girls who want to know more about guys,? she says, adding that she sees it as her equivalent of a greatest hits album.

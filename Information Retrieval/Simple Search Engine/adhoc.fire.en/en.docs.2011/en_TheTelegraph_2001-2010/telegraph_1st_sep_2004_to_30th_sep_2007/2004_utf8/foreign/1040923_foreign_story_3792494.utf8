 Survivors forage after floods kill 700 in Haiti

 Gonaives, Haiti, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Survivors of devastating floods in Haiti wandered through mud-clogged streets in search of food yesterday as officials said more than 700 people had been killed and at least 1,000 were missing.

 Tropical Storm Jeanne swept north of Haiti during the weekend, drenching the impoverished Caribbean nation of 8 million, inundating cities and sending deadly mudslides through towns and villages.

 Officials at the Office of Civil Protection in Port-au-Prince said 709 deaths had been confirmed in the flood-stricken areas and 1,050 people were missing.

 Most of the dead were in the swamped coastal city of Gonaives and the toll was likely to rise as relief workers reached areas isolated by the floods. ?As the water recedes we begin to see bodies emerge from the mud,? said Fernando Arroyo, a UN official in Gonaives. ?There are bodies scattered on the roads, in the streets.?

 The dead were to be buried in mass graves as soon as heavy machinery arrived, to avert an outbreak of disease, he said.

 Relief supplies started to reach the worst-hit areas, but the pace was slowed by waterlogged roads and worries about security in a country that is still unstable after an armed revolt ousted ex-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February.

 ?I lost five people in the floods and I don?t have anything, no water, no food, nothing,? said a stunned Gonaives resident, Mercidieu Pierre-Andre, 49.

 Water was still waist-high in places and mud on the windows of homes illustrated a desperate tale of rising water that sent people clambering on to their roofs to survive. Some were still camped on the roofs of mud-filled homes, sleeping under plastic tarps on the only dry spots they could find.

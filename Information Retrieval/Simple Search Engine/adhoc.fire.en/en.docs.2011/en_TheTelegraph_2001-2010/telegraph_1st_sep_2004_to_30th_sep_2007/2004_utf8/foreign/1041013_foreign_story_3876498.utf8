 Reveal jeans turns Italy red

 Rome, Oct. 12 (Reuters): It might be fine for Christina Aguilera or plumbers, but not for school children ? jeans that reveal the back side have been banned by an Italian headmaster.

 Just as covering your face with a burqa is excessive... so is it beyond the bounds of decency to wear trousers that, when you sit down, reveal your bottom,? read a circular by the head of Vitruvio Pollione high school in the central Italian city of Avezzano.

 ?Most kids take the fashion in their stride, but in some cases it had led to rather ribald comments,? headmaster Angelo Bernardini told Corriere della Sera newspaper.

 Fashionable teenagers in Italy are fond of rapper-style baggy, low-hanging jeans for boys and midriff-revealing trousers for girls. In both cases underwear is often on view.

 ?A triangle of G-string popping out of the trousers ? that?s vulgar, that?s something I really would not like to see at school. But a glimpse of underwear elastic isn?t such a bad thing, it?s just a little innocent provocation,? founder of Italys Diesel clothing brand, Renzo Rosso, told the Corriere.

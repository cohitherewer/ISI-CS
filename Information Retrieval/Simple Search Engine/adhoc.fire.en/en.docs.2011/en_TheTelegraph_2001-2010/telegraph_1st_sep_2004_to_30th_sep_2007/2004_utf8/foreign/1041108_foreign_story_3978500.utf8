 Russia kisses custom goodbye

 Moscow, Nov. 7: Muscovite politicians have been told to stop kissing each other and stick to handshakes when they meet because the traditional greeting takes too long.

 Senior male officials in the regional government have also been irritated by local media poking fun at pictures of politicians kissing. 

 The verbal instruction is to use only handshakes, on the grounds that the ?kissing ceremony? takes so long that without it there would be time for several extra meetings every year.

 Russian tradition dictates that men should kiss each other three times on the cheeks at official functions, and the practice has been revived among high-ranking officials. In the past, a kiss from the tsar was the highest sign of recognition.

 The Moscow ruling, however, has prompted authorities in other cities to consider banning the practice. Alexei Kleshko, an MP in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, said: ?Single-sex kisses should be avoided, including at official meetings. It?s enough to shake hands. Of course, if one is talking about a long friendship or fatherly relations, it might be OK to embrace. But that?s the maximum that should be allowed.?

 Another parliamentarian, Vladimir Gorlov, said he only allowed himself to kiss the hand of a woman at work: ?There are informal relations and there are meetings governed by protocol,? he said. ?When a man is kissing another man at an official event, I have a negative attitude towards it. There are rules of decency.?

 According to the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper, the Moscow ban will apply to meetings and official receptions of the regional government.

 Leonid Brezhnev, the general secretary of the Communist Party between 1964 and 1982, was renowned for treating male colleagues to a full lip-lock. A photograph of him kissing Erich Honecker, the East German leader, was reproduced as a protest painting on the Berlin Wall with the caption: ? God, help me survive this deadly love?.

 In 1979, President Jimmy Carter was ridiculed by the American media after succumbing to a kiss from Brezhnev during the signing of an arms treaty in Vienna.

 A contemporary joke had Brezhnev gazing at the aeroplane of a departing foreign leader and exclaiming: ?Rubbish politician ? but what a kisser.?

 Boris Yeltsin, Russia?s first post-Communist President, largely refrained from public displays of affection, but Alexander Voloshin, the icy former chief of staff to Vladimir Putin, the current president, had a surprising predilection for kissing men, including soldiers, at formal gatherings.

 Putin himself takes a more conservative approach. He frequently looks uncomfortable when he is so much as embraced or slapped on the back by foreign leaders such as President George W. Bush.

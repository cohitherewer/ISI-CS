 Bank of ethics opens doors

 London, Sept. 22: Britain 

 today began an interesting experiment in financial services 

 when the country?s first Islamic Bank opened its doors in 

 London.

 The Islamic Bank of Britain, is located in the Edgware Road, not far from Marble Arch in Oxford Street, and its functioning will be overseen by a group of Islamic scholars. Their job will be to ensure the bank adheres to Sharia law, that no interest is offered or demanded and that investment is in undertakings that are ?ethical?. Firms dealing in tobacco or alcohol, for example, are on the prohibited list. Some western experts say that sharing profit is merely a disguised form of interest. Islamic scholars disagree. 

 Parts of the Edgware Road resemble little Arabia with bearded men relaxing with hookahs in Lebanese restaurants, women in burkhas pouring out of the Odeon cinema in small groups after watching Tom Cruise and Arabic papers on sale at grocery stores. 

 Michael Hanlon, managing director of the Islamic Bank of Britain, said: ?We are delighted to be opening our first branch. It marks a new era in Islamic banking in the UK and the beginning of our work to broaden our product offering and branch network.?

 He added: ?The current additional capital raising taking place will provide funds to allow us to implement these important growth plans, and we are confident that we can provide customers with a range of Sharia compliant products and services.?

 He said the products would be equivalent to those in a conventional bank and competitively priced. Tony Blair, who has lost support among Britain?s 1.5-1.8million Muslims because of his Iraq war, hopes that they will appreciate this gesture of trying to make those of the Islamic faith feel more at home.

 Most mainstream banks already have services adapted for Muslim customers but they are rejected by the orthodox because their banking practices are rooted in western ways. 

 The branch in Edgware ? others will follow ? will be the UK?s first stand alone Islamic bank. British Muslims have felt slightly lost since the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) closed more than a decade ago because of fraud at the top. 

 Today, it began offering savings accounts for sums ranging from ?1 to ?100,000 through the Edgware Road branch and nationally by telephone and post. 

 It plans to launch current accounts and loans in November, followed by mortgages, credit cards and business banking accounts in 2005. 

 There will be branches in Birmingham and Leicester in November, followed by eight further branches as well as Internet banking next year.

 Instead of offering interest on the accounts the bank will trade in Sharia compliant investments and share the profits with savers. The British public has been made aware that under strict Islamic practice, it is forbidden to give or receive interest.

 The bank has also launched a share offering to fund its expansion plans. It is offering 160 million shares priced at 25p each, although people must buy a minimum of 4,000 shares.

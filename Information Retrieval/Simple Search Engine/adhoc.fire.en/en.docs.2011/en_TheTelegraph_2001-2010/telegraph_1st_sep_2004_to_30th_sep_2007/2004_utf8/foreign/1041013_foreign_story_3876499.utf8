 EU cannot force us on uranium, says Iran

 Tehran, Oct. 12 (Reuters): The EU cannot force Iran to give up its right to enrich uranium, Iran?s foreign minister said, apparently slamming the door on EU efforts to halt the process and ease fears Tehran is seeking a nuclear bomb.

 ?It is wrong for them (the EU) to think they can, through negotiations, force Iran to stop enrichment,? foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi said in Tehran today. ?Iran will never give up its right to enrichment.?

 Diplomats said the EU had agreed yesterday to prepare a package of ?carrots and sticks? to get Iran to comply with demands by the UN?s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to suspend enrichment activities ? a process which can be used to make material for atomic bombs. The New York Times reported today that US officials were also working on the package of incentives with the EU.

 Washington believes Iran is secretly developing nuclear arms and wants it referred to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions.

 Iran says it wants to master the full nuclear fuel cycle, including enrichment, so it does not have to rely on imported fuel for an ambitious atomic energy programme.

 EU ministers had urged Russia, which is building an atomic plant in Iran despite strong US criticism, to join the initiative. But an official in Moscow said today Russia thought the EU proposals would be ineffective.

 Russia has long maintained that Iran has an entirely peaceful nuclear programme and cannot use Moscow?s atomic knowhow to make weapons. Although Iran is not enriching uranium at present, it is preparing a large batch of raw uranium ready for the process and has resumed building enrichment centrifuges.

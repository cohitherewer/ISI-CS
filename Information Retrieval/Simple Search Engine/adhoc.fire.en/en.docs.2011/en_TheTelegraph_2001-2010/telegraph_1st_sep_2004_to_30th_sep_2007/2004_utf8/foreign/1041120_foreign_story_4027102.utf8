 Rome, Nov. 19: It was billed 

 as a ?celebration? of Europe?s musical tastes but there 

 was an overwhelming American tang to the MTV Europe Music 

 Awards last night.

 Rock, R amp;B and hip-hop stars from across the Atlantic came within a whisker of sweeping the board at the ceremony in Rome.

 The sole European success was the British band Muse. The Devon band, whose symphonic rock has earned them comparisons to Queen, picked up the award for best alternative act.

 The awards, now in their 11th year, are voted by up to 120 million MTV viewers from across the continent and are regarded as one of the biggest barometers of the state of the European music industry.

 The biggest winners last night were OutKast, the innovative hip- hop band, who beat the Cure and the Streets to take the prestigious best video and best song award with Hey Ya! and were also named best group.

 Their triple triumph was almost matched by Usher, the R amp;B singer, who picked up three gongs at the American Music Awards at the weekend. Usher, who has topped both the singles and the album charts in the UK, saw off Robbie Williams, Justin Timberlake, Nelly and Jay-Z to win best male artist. 

 Britney Spears, who has married ? again ? and undergone a musical makeover during the past 12 months, cemented her position as the reigning queen of pop by being named best female, while Alicia Keys, the critically acclaimed singer-songwriter, won the award for Best R amp; B act.

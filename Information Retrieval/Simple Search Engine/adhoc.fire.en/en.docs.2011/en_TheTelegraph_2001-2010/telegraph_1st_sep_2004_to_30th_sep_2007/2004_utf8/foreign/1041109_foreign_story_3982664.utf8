 Disney is Incredible

 London, Nov. 8: Walt Disney 

 launched its latest computer-generated film, The Incredibles, 

 a parody of superheroes, in London yesterday.

 As two of the voice-over actors, Samuel L Jackson and Holly Hunter, attended the premiere at the Empire, Leicester Square, box office figures for its opening weekend in America indicated a blockbuster hit.

 In three nights, the film grossed ?39.2 million in a huge US release on 3,933 cinema screens. Within days, it will have easily recouped its production and promotion costs.

 This is the sixth consecutive box office number one for rivals Disney and DreamWorks, with the best of them, Toy Story 2 and Finding Nemo likely to endure as classics of their kind.

 The Incredibles, which cost ?55 million, tells of a father, mother and three children who are forced to give up crime-fighting when the world no longer needs superheroes, but who make a comeback when the Earth is endangered.

 Written and directed by Brad Bird, best known for his work on The Simpsons, The Incredibles is the first entirely computer created film in which all the characters are human and, at two hours, it is the longest.

 Analysts estimate that it could earn up to ?330 million around the world.

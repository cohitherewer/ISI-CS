 UK toys with forced marriage ban

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 27: Muslim schoolgirls will no longer be dragged back by relatives from Bradford or Manchester to Pakistan to be married off to ?uncles? twice their age, under tough new laws being contemplated by the home office to ban ?forced marriages?.

 It was also announced today that spouses who enter Britain in future will have to be, at least, 18-years-old and not 16, the legal age of consent in Britain.

 So far the government appears not to have consulted the Asian community for whose benefit the measures are apparently being considered but David Blunkett, the home secretary who is determined to make forced marriage a new criminal offence, says he does want interested groups and individuals to express their views.

 The government says it is not attacking the Asian system of ?arranged marriage? but has pointed out that in the last four years a special unit set up in the foreign office to deal with ?forced marriages? has handled 1,000 cases. 

 Since 2000, about 200 young women have been rescued and brought back to the UK.

 Although the government will want its proposals to be considered progressive, many in the Asian community will wonder whether the timing is connected with the general election expected in May next year.

 Some Right-wing organisations want even arranged marriages to be banned since they see this as a way of bringing in more Asian immigrants into Britain, mainly from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

 Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of Migrationwatch UK, said: ?This is welcome but it is a half measure. It?s not enough to discourage the use of arranged marriage as a means of immigration.?

 It is clear from anecdotal and other evidence that there is a serious problem and Asian women?s rights groups who run refuge centres have been putting pressure on the government to take action to curb forced marriage.

 However, it is also apparent that the problem is one which occurs almost exclusively in a section of the Muslim community, the most orthodox based in Yorkshire and the Midlands. It is also true that in the past some Punjabi girls have been rescued from Punjab by the British High Commission in Delhi and returned to Britain.

 However, Hindus and Sikhs will resent being penalised, as, no doubt, many will see the situation, for what is happening among orthodox Mirpuris and the most traditional of Muslim families, where a number of ?honour killings? have also taken place.

 So far as one can tell, no Bengali (as opposed to Ban-gladeshi) Hindu girl has been in the news for being the victim of a forced marriage, and Hindu Gujaratis and Punjabis (who make up the bulk of the Asian population in the UK) will feel they are being ?made to suffer? for what is happening in another community.

 The situation is a delicate one because in Britain, Hindus and Muslims, Indians and Pakistanis, take pride in their ability to get on and generally avoid divisive politics.

 Among educated Hindus, the problem, if there is one, is that many women are not marrying at all, mainly because they have sacrificed personal lives to pursue high-powered careers. Blunkett is also effectively raising the legal age of marriage for Asians who come from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to 18, while leaving untouched the age of consent for girls in Britain.

 The major difficulty for the government, according to social commentators, is that it is taking a blunt instrument to deal with the ?Asian community?.

 Even Muslim spokesmen have pointed out that there are big differences of class and attitude between, say, educated and middle class Muslims in London and their co-religionists in Bradford or Manchester. Blunkett justified his proposed legalisation by arguing today: ?Forced marriage is simply an abuse of human rights. It is a form of domestic violence that dehumanises people by denying them their right to choose how to live their lives. Valuing individual citizens, their dignity and the contribution they have to make to society in their own right is a central part of our drive for strong, active communities. The appaling practice of forced marriage represents the opposite extreme and that is why Government is taking tough action to eradicate it.?

 The Home Office and the Foreign Office are combing to set up a new ?forced marriage unit? to help girls in distress. 

 That the problem involves mainly Pakistan is recognised by the government, with ?an additional forced marriage entry clearance post to be created in Islamabad to help reluctant spouses and increase our ability to support victims?.

 The Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, said: ?Our High Commissions and embassies work intensively with police and judiciary overseas to stop Britons being forced into marriage. In difficult and stressful conditions our consular staff have removed victims from situations of extreme emotional and physical trauma. They have rescued victims who have been held captive, raped or forced into an abortion.?

 He went on: ?However, more can certainly be done and we hope these new measures will drive forward increasingly effective co-operation between all those groups who are determined to tackle the abuse, both in the UK and overseas.?

 Fine Print

 Turkey treat

 London, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Britons favour turkey with all the trimmings at Christmas over finer foods like lobster or caviar but half of the nation would swap a traditional snowy setting for sun, a seasonal survey showed today.

 For Christmas lunch, 77 per cent of people plumped for Norfolk turkey, 39 per cent chose lobster and 15 per cent Beluga caviar in a survey by a credit card firm.

 But Britons were split over the perfect destination for their holiday alternative ? 50 per cent chose the Caribbean island of Mustique, while just more than a quarter favoured Sweden?s Ice Hotel.

 Royal rage

Munich: King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and his German-born 

wife Queen Silvia are suing Germany?s biggest magazine publishers over what they 

claim are 1,588 made-up stories, including more than 500 front-page ?exclusives?, 

reports The Daily Telegraph. Their patience with the Mannheim-based Klambt 

group ran out when a recent story alleged that the king had been unfaithful, under 

the headline, ?The tears of a betrayed wife?. ?The magazine had retouched the 

photos to put tears in my eyes,? said Queen Silvia, 61. The royal family was also 

outraged over previous claims that next-in-line Princess Victoria was barren, 

King Carl Gustaf, 58, was seriously ill, and the queen had been suffering from 

cancer but was cured by a miraculous wristband.

 Drive crazy

 Kfar Rupin (Israel), (Reuters): An Israeli gardener, 

pleading ruin after having his driving license removed for talking on the cellphone 

while driving, set off on a 300-km trek with his lawnmower on Sunday to try to 

persuade authorities to give it back. ?I have no income or unemployment benefits. 

I have no money for a driver. I have no choice,? Yuval Weizman said as he puttered 

out of his hometown of Kfar Rubin in the remote Jordan Valley.

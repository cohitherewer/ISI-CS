 UN rejects drive to ban cloning

 United Nations, Nov. 20 (Reuters): A divided United Nations yesterday rejected a US-led campaign to ban all cloning of human embryos, including for stem-cell research, as a General Assembly committee opted instead for a non-binding declaration.

 With some viewing the practice as the destruction of human life and others as a potentially life-saving avenue of medical research, ?We thought it would be unbearable for the international community to be divided on an issue like cloning,? said Ambassador Mohamed Bennouna of Morocco, chairman of the assembly?s treaty-writing legal committee.

 ?The bottom line is that stem-cell research will advance. This declaration will not chill stem-cell research,? said Bernard Siegel, a Florida attorney who led a lobbying drive by scientists and patient advocacy groups to defend cloning for therapeutic ends.

 Adopting an agreement reached late on Thursday between supporters and foes of Washington?s three-year drive for a broad anti-cloning treaty, the UN committee shunted aside the US proposal by consensus.

 In its place, the panel adopted a resolution instructing a working group to meet in February for talks on a political declaration put forward by Italy as a face-saving compromise. Rome suggested the assembly issue a non-binding statement calling on nations to adopt laws ?to prohibit any attempts to create human life through cloning processes and any research intended to achieve that aim.?

 While proponents of embryonic stem-cell studies had problems with the term ?human life,? they agreed the text could form the basis of future negotiations, diplomats said.

 US envoy Carolyn Willson had no comment after the vote.

 In Washington, state department spokesperson Adam Ereli said the US was pleased the United Nations had not issued an endorsement of cloning. ?We are proud of our efforts to prevent human cloning. So the fact that there isn?t any action by the UN to endorse cloning is a moderate success,? Ereli said.

 Opponents of the US plan said the outcome showed that a majority of the 191 UN member-nations wanted to keep the door open to therapeutic cloning, in which human embryos are cloned as part of research such as stem-cell studies.

 But Ambassador Bruno Stagno Ugarte of Costa Rica, who led nations supporting Washington?s plan, said it would have won in a straight up-or-down vote but instead faced death through procedural challenges, as happened twice before in the panel.

 Friday?s committee action fell a little over two weeks after US elections in which stem-cell research was an issue.

 Opinion polls showed strong support for such studies, and the US Congress has so far shunned President George W. Bush?s pleas for a tough law that bans therapeutic cloning.

 Deuba poll ultimatum to Maoists

 Kathmandu, Nov. 25 (Reuters): Nepal will push ahead with planned elections if Maoist rebels do not respond by January 13 to a government offer for peace talks to end a bloody revolt, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said today.

 Deuba, 57, reappointed in June less than two years after King Gyanendra fired him for failing to tackle the revolt and hold elections then set for November 2002, said he was committed to end the eight-year-old revolt through negotiations.

 ?If the Maoists do not show their readiness to come to talks in search of a solution to the problem in a peaceful manner even during this period, it will not be possible for the government to stay waiting for long,? Deuba said. 

 Peace with the Maoists, fighting since 1996 to replace Nepal?s constitutional monarchy with a communist republic, is key to any election in Nepal, which has been without an elected parliament since 2002 because of rebel threats.

 Iraqi gunmen kidnap Italian women aiding schools

 Baghdad, Sept. 7 (Reuters): 

 Gunmen abducted two Italian aid workers and two Iraqis in 

 central Baghdad on Tuesday in a brazen attack that will 

 alarm foreigners already on edge from widespread kidnappings.

 Witnesses said about 20 men with AK-47 assault rifles and pistols with silencers stopped their vehicles in daylight in a busy commercial area of Baghdad and raided a building housing humanitarian organisation Bridge to Baghdad.

 They left with Italian staffers Simona Pari and Simona Torretta and two Iraqis, a women who worked for another Italian organisation Intersos and a male employee of Bridge to Baghdad.

 It appeared it was totally professional. It appeared they knew exactly who they wanted to abduct, said one witness, who declined to be named. Gunmen dragged the Iraqi woman away by her hair. She was screaming, a witness said.

 Jean-Domique Bunel, an official from a committee that groups together aid organisations in Iraq, said he saw two well-dressed men with guns enter the building and take away the hostages. The guards were unarmed and they did nothing, he said.

 The Italian women were involved in an aid initiative aimed at boosting school attendance in Basra and Baghdad including in the capitals Sadr City slums, home to thousands of Shias.

 An official at the Italian embassy said they had no immediate information on the kidnappings conducted on a side street just off a busy Baghdad square near a hospital and a congested avenue.

 The abductions raised the stakes in kidnappings that have gripped Iraq for months, with more than 100 foreigners and Iraqis seized since April mostly outside of the capital. Insurgents kidnapped and killed Italian journalist Enzo Baldoni last month as he travelled to the southern city of Najaf. In April, kidnappers killed Italian security guard Fabrizio Quattrocchi.

 The latest abductions are likely to fuel uncertainty over the fate of two French journalists whose kidnappings have triggered intense diplomatic efforts to free them. Aside from unleashing suicide bombers and shooting attacks, insurgents have carried out kidnappings in a campaign designed to drive out foreign companies.

 Sadr City firefight

 Iraqi fighters and US troops clashed in Sadr City slums today in firefights that killed 24 Iraqis and one US soldier and threatened to wreck a ceasefire called by rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Rocket-propelled grenades were fired at soldiers several times overnight and today.

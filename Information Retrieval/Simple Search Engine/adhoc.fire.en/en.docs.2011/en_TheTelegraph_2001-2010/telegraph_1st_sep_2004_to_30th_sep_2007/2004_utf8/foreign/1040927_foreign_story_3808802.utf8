 Musharraf attack mastermind killed in Pak

 Karachi, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Pakistan?s security agencies today shot dead a gunman who intelligence officials said may have been a wanted militant who masterminded an assassination attempt on President Pervez Musharraf last year.

 Authorities were trying to determine whether the gunman killed in an hour-long firefight was Amjad Hussain Farooqi, wanted in connection with attacks on Musharraf last December.

 ?The authorities have sent a brother-in-law of Farooqi to make an identification ... to determine if he is Farooqi or not,? an intelligence official said. 

 He said the gunman had refused to surrender. 

 Two others had also been arrested, one of them a foreigner whose identity was not immediately known.

 Pakistan?s security forces are on a state of high alert while a hunt for al Qaida members and their local supporters is carried out across the country.

 The clash took place in a middle-class neighbourhood of the small city of Nawabshah, 130 km northeast of the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, police inspector Ismail Jamali said by telephone from the area.

 Salahuddin Haider, the spokesperson in the provincial government of Sindh, earlier said the two Pakistani nationals had taken a family hostage. 

 ?They were heavily armed and therefore paramilitary rangers had to be called in. We do not know whether they are criminals or terrorists,? he said. ?We are investigating.?

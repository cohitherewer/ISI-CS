 Fine Print

 Toilet triumph

 London, Dec. 1 (Reuters): They are two of the most recognised works of art in the world, and they have lost out to an autographed toilet.

 Pablo Picasso?s Les Demoiselles d?Avignon and Guernica came second and fourth respectively in a poll of what 500 leading art world figures regarded as the five most influential works of modern art in the world.

 They were beaten to the top spot by Marcel Duchamp?s Fountain, a tilted and signed white urinal which he offered to a shocked art world in 1917. Third place in the survey by Turner Prize sponsor and gin manufacturer Gordon?s went to Andy Warhol?s Marilyn Diptych, with Henri Matisse?s The Red Studio in fifth place.

 Bar force

 Tokyo (Reuters): Japanese bar 

 hostesses clad in kimonos have joined forces with police 

 in a symbolic move to crack down on rising crime in one 

 of Tokyo?s most fashionable entertainment and shopping districts. 

 Complaining of what they say are rising rates of pick-pocketing 

 and mugging in the Ginza, several kimono-clad bar hostesses 

 have started to patrol the district in the heart of Tokyo 

 once a month. ?Men patrol the streets too, but we feel it?s 

 our duty to help out to take care of our town and return 

 it to a place of safe streets like it used to be,? said 

 Kie Kittaka, a bar owner, wearing a kimono with a green 

 sash reading: ?Protect our town?. 

 Tall tree

 Rio de Janeiro (Reuters): The lights are blazing from the world?s largest floating Christmas tree ? a gigantic metal structure as tall as a 27-storey tower block set on a lagoon in Rio de Janeiro. ?We?re competing with all the violent news from Rio to show the world what a marvellous city it is,? Roberto Medina, the project?s creator. The tree features moving images of church bells and doves flickering from nearly 3 million lights. The Christmas tree, first erected in 1999, constitutes Rio de Janeiro?s third biggest tourist event after the pre-lenten Carnival and New Years Eve on Copacabana and other beaches. Some 100,000 people came to watch on Saturday night when the lights were switched. Around 1,300 workers were hired to assemble the tree, constructed from 410 tonnes of metal scaffolding supported by 11 barges. The Guinness Book of Records lists it as the worlds largest floating Christmas tree.

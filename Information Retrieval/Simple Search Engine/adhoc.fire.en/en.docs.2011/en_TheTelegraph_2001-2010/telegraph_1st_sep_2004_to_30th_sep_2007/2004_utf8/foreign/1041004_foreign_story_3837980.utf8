 Jerusalem, Oct. 3 (Reuters): Israel today demanded that the UN investigate whether Palestinians filmed in the Gaza Strip were militants using a UN van to transport rockets for use against Israel.

 Israel has killed at least 50 Palestinians in a Gaza offensive launched after a Palestinian rocket attack killed two toddlers in a border town.

 UN officials who had seen the black-and-white footage, filmed by an Israeli military drone, said they did not believe the object seen being loaded into the back of a vehicle was a Qassam rocket ? but possibly a stretcher. The pictures showed men running towards a vehicle with UN painted on the roof. One of them carried a long thin object which Israeli officials said was a Qassam rocket.

 Israel?s ambassador to the UN, Danny Gillerman, demanded that Secretary-General Kofi Annan order a full investigation.

 ?This is a totally unacceptable situation...in which the UN, which is supposed to keep the peace, is cynically used by murderers to transport Qassam rockets in UN vehicles,? Gillerman told Israel Radio.

 The commissioner-general of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which cares for Palestinian refugees, insisted the object was not a rocket. ?It would have taken more than a Goliath or a world heavyweight lifting champion to carry a Qassam rocket of some 30 to 50 kg lightly in one arm,? Peter Hansen, the commissioner-general, said.

 He said he believed it was a portable lightweight stretcher.

 Israeli military officials said the footage had been analysed by aerial experts and they were certain it was a rocket. They added some Qassam models weigh less than 12 kg.

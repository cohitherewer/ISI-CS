 Fine Print

 Topless trouble

 Los Angeles, Oct. 24 (AP): Catherine Zeta-Jones has sued a Nevada topless club she said used her image for advertising and promotion without her permission.

 The lawsuit filed on Thursday in US district court in Los Angeles said the Spice House, which bills itself as ?Reno?s friendliest topless cabaret,? displayed her picture on ?numerous pages? of its web site, sometimes alongside partially nude women.

 That created the false impression the actor ?endorsed or approved of the sexually explicit content? and could ?dilute the value of her celebrity endorsement,? the lawsuit says.

 The star of Chicago and Intolerable Cruelty seeks unspecified damages and an order barring further use of her likeness.

 Dog?s day

 Dhaka (AP): A boy, attacked by a mob 

 on his way home from a mosque in northern Bangladesh, was 

 rescued by his dog, a news report said. The 15-year-old 

 boy was returning home after evening prayers when the group 

 attacked him, binding his hands and legs with a rope and 

 stabbing him, the daily Manabzamin said. His dog, 

 who had accompanied him, then jumped on and began biting 

 the attackers, who fled the scene in Rangpur district, 248 

 km north of the capital Dhaka. The boy?s neighbours, hearing 

 the dog barking, reached the spot and rescued him, it said.

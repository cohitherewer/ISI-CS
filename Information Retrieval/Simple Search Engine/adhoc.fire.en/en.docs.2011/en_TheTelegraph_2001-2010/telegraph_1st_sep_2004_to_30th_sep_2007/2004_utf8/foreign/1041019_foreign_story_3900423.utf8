 China in landmark free-speech ruling

 Beijing, Oct. 18 (Reuters): A Chinese court has cleared a magazine of libel charges filed by a state-owned real estate developer in what is seen as a landmark ruling for freedom of speech.

 All Chinese media are state controlled and expected to sing the praises of the government and play down bad news. The constitution enshrines freedom of speech, but defendants rarely win libel lawsuits.

 The People?s Intermediate Court in Tianhe district in the southern city of Guangzhou ruled on October 12 against Guangzhou Huaqiao Real Estate Development Co., which had sought 5.9 million yuan ($711,000) in damages from China Reform magazine.

 The July 1, 2003, edition of the monthly said Guangzhou Huaqiao had been stripped of its assets, posted losses and laid off workers as a result of its ownership changing hands several times. The news was sourced to company and official documents.

 The court ruled that journalists enjoyed legal immunity if news was backed up by a source which was reasonable and believable, and not based on rumours or fabrication, according to a copy of the verdict seen by Reuters today.

 ?Room for freedom of speech has been expanded,? libel lawyer Pu Zhiqiang said.

 ?In the past, if you say I?m no good and I?m unhappy, I can sue you,? Pu said. ?The ruling, at the very least, does not consider a fair commentary to be infringement.?

 An employee of Guangzhou Huaqiao said the firm had not received a copy of the verdict and declined further comment. It has 15 days to appeal.

 ?The things the plaintiff discussed were all facts, maybe various factors (made the court) give consideration to the magazine first. I don?t know why it?s like this,? Yang Jianguang, lawyer for Guangzhou Huaqiao, said by telephone. ?I don?t want to answer questions. Media issues are very complicated.?

 In its complaint, Guangzhou Huaqiao said the magazine had ?dealt a heavy blow to a large-scale state-owned enterprise with hopes of soaring, and caused huge economic losses?.

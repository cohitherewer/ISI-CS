 Oodles of oil

 Tehran, Sept. 20 (Reuters): Crude oil stirred by geological rumblings has bubbled up into homes and alleyways in the southwest Iranian city of Masjed Soleiman, state television and officials said today.

 Masjed Soleiman was Iran?s first oil town, lying in the arid oil heartlands on the Iraqi border. Iran holds the world?s second biggest reserves of oil and natural gas.

 oil official from the city said he had no details of the scale of this particular seepage but said two neighbourhoods had been regularly blackened by treacly crude eruptions for the last 20 years.

 ?The thing that is really bothering people at the moment is the smell of the gas seeping out,? he said. Oil was driven to the surface by underground tremors, experts were quoted on state television as saying. Dozens of small earthquakes jolted the region in January.

 Top tracks

 London (Reuters): Swedish DJ Eric Prydz?s 

 Call on Me has gone to the top of the British singles 

 chart, the official UK charts company said on Sunday. The 

 dance hit, which samples Steve Winwood?s 1980?s hit Valerie, 

 held off competition from Girls Aloud at number two with 

 Love Machine. US pop-punk band Green Day went in 

 at number three with the George Bush-baiting American 

 Idiot, making an all new top three. Teenage star Joss 

 Stone was the only other new entry in the top 10 with You 

 Had Me at number nine. Ex-Westlife star Brian McFadden, 

 who went straight to the top spot last week with Real 

 to Me, fell to number six. US rapper Nelly went from 

 two to four with My Place/Flap Your Wings, while 

 McFly?s That Girl just held on to a top 10 spot after 

 falling from three to 10.

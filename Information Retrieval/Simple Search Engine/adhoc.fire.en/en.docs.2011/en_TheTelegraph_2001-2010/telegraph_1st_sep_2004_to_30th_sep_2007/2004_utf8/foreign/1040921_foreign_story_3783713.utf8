 Some Dolce Vita for Italy: Sophia is 70

 Sophia Loren: Yesterday, today and tomorrow

 Rome, Sept. 20 (Reuters): Italians got a break from a steady stream of bad news about terrorism and taxes today, to be reminded that screen siren Sophia Loren had turned 70. Thats right, 70!

 The diva who started life as an illegitimate child in southern Italy went on to win an Oscar and became a living legend and a symbol of post-war Italy. 

 She is believed to be celebrating the birthday quietly with her family.

 But Italians will get to see her acting talents with the screening of a made-for-television film about an immigrant family set in Umbria and Canada.

 Corriere della Sera newspaper put the birthday on its front page, as if to remind Italians that some of the Dolce Vita, or sweet life, was left in a world dominated by bad news.

 Italys largest mainstream newspaper said it all: ?Happy Birthday, Sophia ? legend for a generation.?

 In fact, for Italians, Lorens birthday is not just an ordinary anniversary or commemoration but a bittersweet reminder that the post-war boom times she epitomised at the height of her fame no longer exist.

 The fact that Corriere used only her first name was not casual. She is the only woman in Italy who is universally known by her first name. When someone says Sophia on television, it can only mean ?La Loren.?

 Loren has outlived many of her film contemporaries from the days when Rome was known as the Hollywood on the Tiber because it was a major production centre and magnet for the jet set.

 Directors Federico Fellini and Vittorio de Sica are dead, as is Marcello Mastroianni, who was her leading man in many movies.

 She shot to fame with an Oscar for best actress in De Sicas neo-realistic classic Two Women in 1961, a film set in World War Two in which she proved that she was not just a pretty face.

 It would be 38 years before another Italian would win an Oscar for a starring role. Roberto Benigni clinched it in 1998 for his performance in La Vita e Bella (Life is Beautiful). Fittingly, it was Loren who handed him the statue in Hollywood.

 And, even though everyone agrees that Loren played many more serious roles, news bulletins treated Italians to clips of perhaps her most famous scene: a striptease for a howling Mastroianni in De Sica?s Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow in 1963.

 ?Getting ahead in a difficult profession requires avid faith in yourself. That is why some people with mediocre talent, but with greater inner drive, go so much further than people with vastly superior talent,? Loren once said.

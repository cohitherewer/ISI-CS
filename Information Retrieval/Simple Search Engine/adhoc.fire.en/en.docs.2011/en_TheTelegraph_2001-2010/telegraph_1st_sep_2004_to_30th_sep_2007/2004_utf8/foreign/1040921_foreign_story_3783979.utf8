 Karzai aide escapes bid on life

 Kabul, Sept. 20 (Reuters): An Afghan vice-president survived an assassination attempt today when a remotely controlled device was detonated near his convoy, while two soldiers from the US-led coalition were killed in a separate gunbattle.

 Nematuallah Shahrani, one of four vice-presidents in the interim government of President Hamid Karzai, was in a convoy with other officials in the northern province of Kunduz when it was attacked, said provincial governor Mohammad Omar Khan.

 Karzai, favourite to win an October 9 presidential election, survived an assassination attempt last week when a rocket was fired at a helicopter he was in as it came in to land in the southeastern town of Gardez. The rocket missed.

 Remnants of the Taliban and Islamic militant allies, including al Qaida, have been blamed for a wave of violence concentrated in the south and east of the country in which about 1,000 people have been killed in the last year. 

 They have vowed to disrupt preparations for the presidential election. Two soldiers from the US-led coalition were killed in a gunbattle in Paktika province.

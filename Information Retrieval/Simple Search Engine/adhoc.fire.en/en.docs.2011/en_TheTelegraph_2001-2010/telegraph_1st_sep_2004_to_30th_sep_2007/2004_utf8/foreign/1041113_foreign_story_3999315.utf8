 Moore plans sequel

 Los Angeles, Nov. 12 (Reuters): Director Michael Moore is planning a sequel to Fahrenheit 9/11, his polemic against the Bush administration, to be released about the time of the next presidential campaign, a spokeswoman for his distributor said yesterday.

 The sequel, dubbed Fahrenheit 9/11 and 1/2, will revisit the same issues as Moore?s earlier documentary, which he repeatedly said was aimed at swaying the outcome of the presidential race against President George W. Bush.

 ?We want to get the cameras rolling now and have it ready in two (to) three years,? Moore told Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd. ?Fifty-one per cent of the American people lacked information (in this election), and we want to educate and enlighten them. They weren?t told the truth.?

 Bush was re-elected last week, winning 51 per cent of the vote to Democratic Senator John Kerry?s 48 per cent.

 Moore added: ?The official mourning period is over today and there is a silver lining ? George W. Bush is prohibited by law from running again.?

 A spokeswoman for Lions Gate Entertainment confirmed Moore?s plans for the sequel.

 Moore?s film, which won the top prize at the Cannes film festival, has grossed nearly $120 million at the US box office since its theatrical release in June, a record for a political documentary.

 The film, which was backed by Miramax and distributed by a partnership including Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., is expected to be considered for a best picture nomination at the Academy Awards.

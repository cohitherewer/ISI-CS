 Family wants media to stay off kids

 Euan Blair

 London, Oct. 3: Tony and Cherie Blair demanded that their children be given the same protection from the press as Princes William and Harry, according to the former director of the Press Complaints Commission.

 The Prime Minister and his wife summoned Guy Black, now Michael Howard?s director of communications, to Downing Street to ask that Euan, 20, Nicky, 18, and Kathryn, 16, be ?completely removed from the media spotlight?. The request has been revealed by Black in an interview for a forthcoming book about the Blairs? inner circle, The Blairs and Their Court, by Francis Beckett and David Hencke.

 The book describes how Black was summoned to the Prime Minister?s private flat at No 11 in March 2003 and shown into a room with the Blairs, their friend Carole Caplin and Fiona Millar, Alastair Campbell?s girlfriend, who was then Cherie Blair?s assistant. 

 Tony Blair told him: ?I would like to have a similar agreement which has been reached between the press and the royal family over the coverage of William and Harry.? 

 Black says he replied: ?I?m afraid we can?t do this, Prime Minister. Your children are not going to be public figures in their own right. William and Harry are heirs to the throne.?

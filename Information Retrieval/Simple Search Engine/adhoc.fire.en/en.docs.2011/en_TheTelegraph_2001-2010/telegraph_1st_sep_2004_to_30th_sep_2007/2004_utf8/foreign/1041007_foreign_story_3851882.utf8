 Streetwise Bratz topples Barbie

 London, Oct. 6 (Reuters): At the ripe old age of 45, Barbie has been knocked off her perch in Britain by streetwise upstart Bratz in the Christmas battle of the dolls.

 ?It is the first time Barbie has been out of our top 10,? said Ben Green, chairman of the UK Toy Retailers Association as it predicted the must-have toys for Xmas 2004.

 ?Bratz has such a phenomenal impetus behind her. She is very much the new kid on the block,? he said. The busty and blonde Barbie has ruled supreme ever since her launch by US toymaker Mattel Inc .

 She saw off Cindy but now faces her toughest competition yet from multi-ethnic Bratz, brainchild of Isaac Larian who founded US-based MGA Entertainment, now billed as the world?s biggest privately owned toy company.

 ?The toy market is very fickle and so are children. Barbie is in her 45th year, Bratz is only in her second,? Green said as the ?2 billion UK industry geared up for the crucial Christmas market. ?Dolls dominate the girls? sector which is worth over ?400 million, so it?s no wonder that the competition is hot,? Green added.

 Barbie, all a-glitter in her sparkling ?Princess and the Pauper? carriage with interactive kitten Serafina at her side, put a brave face on the demotion.

 ?We are still confident we are going to have a great Christmas. Barbie will continue to evolve,? said Sarah Allen, a UK spokesman for Mattel.

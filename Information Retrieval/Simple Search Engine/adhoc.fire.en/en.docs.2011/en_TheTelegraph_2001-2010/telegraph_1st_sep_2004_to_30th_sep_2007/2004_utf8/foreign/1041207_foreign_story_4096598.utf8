 Christian hate is evil, says church

 Paris, Dec. 6 (Reuters): A Vatican diplomatic campaign to have ?Christianophobia? recognised as an evil equal to hatred of Jews and Muslims is causing concern among some Christian activists and diplomats.

 The discreet drive, which the Roman Catholic Church first mentioned publicly last Friday, seeks official recognition by the UN and other international organisations of discrimination against and persecution of Christians.

 The Holy See is pressing this point despite two setbacks this year when the EU refused to refer to the continent?s Christian heritage in its new constitution and turned down a traditionalist Catholic as a new commissioner. 

 The UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva now speaks of ?anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and Christianophobia,? terms the current General Assembly in New York is due to approve later this month. ?Obviously we have seen many countries where Christian minorities are in danger, but we don?t think this is the appropriate way to really ensure protection,? said Alessandra Aula of Franciscans International.

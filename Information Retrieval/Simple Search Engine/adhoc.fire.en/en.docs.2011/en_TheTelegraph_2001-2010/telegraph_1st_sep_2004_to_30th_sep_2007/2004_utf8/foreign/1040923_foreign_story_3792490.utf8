 Tribals flee homes

 Wana, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Thousands of Pakistanis have been forced to flee their homes due to clashes between Pakistani troops and al Qaida fighters in the remote tribal region along the Afghan border, a legal forum said today.

 Pakistani troops have deployed troops, helicopters and armoured vehicles in South Waziristan in the battle against al Qaida and Taliban fighters. Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is also believed to be possibly hiding out in the border region.

 A paramilitary soldier was killed and a woman seriously wounded today in the latest clash after militants machine-gunned a paramilitary base in Kaniguram, about 40 km north of South Waziristan?s main town of Wana.

 The legal forum report said those forced to flee the fighting were living without any assistance in adjoining areas.

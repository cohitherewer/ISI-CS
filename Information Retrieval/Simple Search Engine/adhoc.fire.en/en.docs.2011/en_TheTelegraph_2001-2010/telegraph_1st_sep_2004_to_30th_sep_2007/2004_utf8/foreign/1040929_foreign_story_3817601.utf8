 Joy in Italy as hostages freed

 Rome, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Two Italian women aid workers and their two Iraqi colleagues abducted in Baghdad have been freed after ?difficult? negotiations, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi told a delighted parliament today.

 News of the release was greeted with joy across Italy, which had been transfixed by the fate of Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, who were seized on September 7. ?At long last this affair is over,? a delighted Berlusconi said to loud cheers in the lower house of parliament. 

 ?Right this minute the girls are in a taxi heading to Baghdad airport after being handed over to the Red Cross one hour ago,? he said. ?They will be in Rome tonight and will be able to hug their families.? Al Jazeera aired footage of the women after they were released. It showed them wearing black veils, which they later lifted, smiling and chatting.

 A Kuwaiti daily said earlier today the women?s captors had agreed to free the hostages for a $1-million ransom. In Rome, the Prime Minister?s office declined to comment on the report, but Berlusconi said the hostages had been freed following tireless, behind-the-scenes manoeuvring. 

 He said the breakthrough came early today ?after a night which led us to a very difficult choice with two lines of pursuit which could have been mutually conflictual?. After news of the release broke, the mother of Simona Pari appeared briefly on the balcony of her Rome apartment and waved to dozens of well-wishers gathered below.

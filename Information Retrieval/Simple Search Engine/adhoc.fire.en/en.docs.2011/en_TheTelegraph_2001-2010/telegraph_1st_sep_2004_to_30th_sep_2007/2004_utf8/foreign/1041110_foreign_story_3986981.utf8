 Twin Nepal blasts shatter calm

 Kathmandu, Nov. 9 (Reuters): 

 Two powerful bomb explosions in Nepal today ripped through 

 a state-owned corporation building and a government office, 

 wounding at least 40 people in attacks authorities blamed 

 on the Maoist rebels.

 Three men walked into the office of the Employees Provident Fund building in Kathmandu and left a bomb on the first floor, a police officer said. It exploded moments after they left wounding 38 people, mostly labourers working to complete the high-rise building.

 Hours later another bomb went off at a government office in the temple town of Bhaktapur, 20 km east of the capital, wounding two people, police said.

 The blasts in the Kathmandu valley were the biggest since a temporary festival truce between Maoists and government forces ended last month.

 ?The mode of operation is the same as used by the Maoists,? the officer said. There was no comment from the guerrillas who are fighting to topple Nepal?s constitutional monarchy.

 The blast in Kathmandu left a crater on the ground floor of the six-storey building and damaged two escalators. Twisted metal and glass shards littered the compound and the street outside.

 ?It was a very big explosion. We were stunned and could not imagine what it was. There were glass pieces raining down on us,? said Dharmendra Yadav, an engineer who worked in the building. 

 Several pedestrians and a two-year-old child playing on the street outside were among the injured.

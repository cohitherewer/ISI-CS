 Govt tried to kill reporter, says former BBC boss

 Andrew Gilligan

 London, Oct. 17 (PTI): 

 Greg Dyke, former director general of the BBC, has claimed 

 that the government ?tried to kill? Andrew Gilligan, the 

 reporter who broke the story that British intelligence had 

 ?sexed up? a dossier on Iraq seeking to justify Britain?s 

 support for US-led invasion of the country. 

 ?The government tried to kill him,? Dyke claimed about Gilligan. The reporter was forced out of his job at the BBC in January in the wake of the Hutton report that inquired into the death of scientist David Kelly, the main source for the British national broadcaster?s story.

 ?Andrew Gilligan was a guy of 32; like all those press guys...They?re all a bit odd. It?s the nature of the world they work in. He lives on his own and he?s not the most popular man in the world,? Dyke said at the Cheltenham festival of literature in Gloucestershire last night. 

 ?Campbell (Alastair Campbell, the then chief of communications at 10, Downing Street) hated him. They tried to get him. When he wouldn?t do the deed (a reference to Gilligan apologising), they basically said to us: ?Right, we are going to throw the whole PR operation of the government against you?. These are not nice people.?

 ?The reason Kelly?s name came into the public agenda ? it was put there at the suggestion of Campbell by people from the press office in the ministry of defence,? he alleged. 

 According to the Independent on Sunday, Dyke also told the audience that he was twice offered a deal by the government. ?They said ? first through Peter Mandelson, former minister and close friend of Prime Minister Tony Blair, and then through Blair ? ?the deal is this. You?ve got to say the story is wrong and we?ll say you were entitled to broadcast it?,? he claimed. 

 ?Well, we didn?t know it was wrong. If you do that analysis now, Gilligan?s story was right. The BBC board will have to stand up for what it believes in.?

 Spelling deported Stevens

 New York, Sept. 26 (AFP): An incident this week in which British former pop star Cat Stevens was deported from the US as a ?no-fly? terrorist risk was caused by a spelling error, Time magazine reported.

 Stevens, 57, gave up his successful pop career in the late 1970s, taking the name Yusuf Islam and converting to islam.

 He had been travelling from London to Washington on Tuesday when his flight was diverted to Bangor, Maine, where he was detained on ?national security grounds? and put on a plane to London, according to US security officials.

 Time, in its on-line edition, yesterday quoted aviation sources with access to the ?no-fly? list as saying there is no entry on the list under the name ?Yusuf Islam,? but that there is a ?Youssouf Islam? on the list. They said the incorrect name was added to the list this summer. As Islam?s name is spelled ?Yusuf? on his passport, he was allowed to board a US-bound plane in London.

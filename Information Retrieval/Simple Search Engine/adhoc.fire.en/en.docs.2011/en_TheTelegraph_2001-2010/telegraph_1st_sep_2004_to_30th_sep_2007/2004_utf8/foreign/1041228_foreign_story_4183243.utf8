 Yushchenko inches to victory

 Kiev, Dec. 27 (Reuters): West-leaning Opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko took an unassailable lead today in Ukraine?s re-run presidential election, promising to end corruption and reform the ex-Soviet state?s damaged economy.

 He wants to align Ukraine, its economic potential squandered by years of mismanagement, with central and western Europe, fanning concerns in neighbouring Russia that it will lose influence over a region where it held sway for 300 years.

 Outgoing President Leonid Kuchma?s 10-year-rule was marked by murky privatisations, widespread poverty and political scandals such as the unexplained beheading of an investigative reporter and alleged arms sales to pariah states. ?For 14 years we have been independent. Now we have become free,? Yushchenko told supporters gathered overnight in Kiev?s Independence Square, site of more than two weeks of mass protests against November?s rigged election. ?The people proved their power.?

 With more than 98 per cent of yesterday?s ballot counted, election officials said Yushchenko had a statistically unbeatable lead, with just under 44 per cent for Moscow-backed Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich.

There were no early independent reports of the cheating that marred the November 21 ballot. But Yanukovich?s camp spoke of many irregularities, raising the possibility of legal challenges.

 The re-run was forced when the Supreme Court upheld charges of rigging in the earlier poll which Yanukovich had won.

 Yesterday?s result suggested Yushchenko, his face disfigured by dioxin poisoning, had won by a big enough margin to carry out a major overhaul of the state?s key institutions.

 Initial comments from monitors suggested Ukraine could become only the second former Soviet state outside the Baltics, after Georgia, to hold a free and fair vote in the last decade.

 ?I am much happier to be in a position to announce that the Ukrainian elections have moved substantially closer to meet OSCE standards,? Bruce George, the head of an Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitoring mission, said.

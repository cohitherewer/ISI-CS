 Band Aid hits top

 London, Nov. 30 (Reuters): More than 

 72,000 copies of the new Band Aid single were sold on its 

 first day of release, figures showed today.

 That made the record the fastest-selling single of the year so far, shifting more copies on Monday than the rest of the UK top 30 combined, a spokesman for HMV said.

 Dido, Robbie Williams and Chris Martin are among the stars on the new single, which is raising money to fight hunger in Africa.

 The sales figures were less than initial optimistic projections of 100,000 copies, but still put the charity single on target for 250,000 sales for the week ? and a guaranteed number one slot in the UK singles chart on Sunday, HMV spokesperson Gennaro Castaldo said.

 Bob Geldof and Ultravox singer Midge Ure created Band Aid, a supergroup of 40 artists, in 1984 and with the hit single raised over ?10 million for famine relief in Ethiopia.

 Free lingerie for votes

 Harare (Reuters): An unnamed Zimbabwean 

 politician has been trying to win women?s votes by handing 

 out free lingerie, state television reported on Tuesday. 

 Handing out gifts is not uncommon in election campaigns 

 in Zimbabwe, but this time the publicity incurred the wrath 

 of his ruling ZANU-PF party. ?Supporters have been angered 

 by the antics of an aspiring parliamentary candidate (who) 

 has been accused of using unorthodox means to garner support 

 ? including the buying of undergarments for women,? Zimbabwe 

 Television said.

 Bomb blast during Nepal strike

 Kathmandu, Sept. 28 (Reuters): A bomb blast in Kathmandu caused slight damage to a bank today during a strike called by Maoist rebels that shut down much of Nepal as soldiers killed 12 guerrillas in gunbattles across the kingdom.

 Police said no one was wounded in the blast, which took place after a panic-stricken taxi driver threw a package containing the bomb into a deserted street during the strike, the latest move in the Maoists violent campaign to overthrow the constitutional monarchy and establish a communist republic.

 In the hours before the strike, rebels set fire to about a dozen vehicles, including two cars carrying participants of an international tour to promote peasants rights, officials said. 

 No one in the tour, the Peoples Caravan for Food Sovereignty, heading to Kathmandu from India, was hurt.

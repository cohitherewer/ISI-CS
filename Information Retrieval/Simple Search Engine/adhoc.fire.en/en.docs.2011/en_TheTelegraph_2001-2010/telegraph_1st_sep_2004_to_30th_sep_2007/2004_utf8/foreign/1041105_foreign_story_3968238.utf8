 Stars fail to shine for Democrats

 Bruce Springsteen

 Los Angeles, Nov. 4 (AFP): Even the mega-wattage of Hollywood?s brightest stars from Titanic icon Leonardo DiCaprio to rock ?Boss? Bruce Springsteen wasn?t enough to illuminate the US presidential candidate John Kerry?s campaign.

 A battalion of entertainment industry glitterati shifted their powerful names and images from America?s theatre marquees to its campaign flyers as they came out in force to lobby for the Democrats? White House bid. But it simply wasn?t enough to defeat President George W. Bush. Ben Affleck, Sharon Stone, Uma Thurman and Brad Pitt couldnt lure enough Kerry voters into voting booths.

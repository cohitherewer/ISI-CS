 Ex-spy chief in Aziz team

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 1: The transfer of power in Pakistan was completed today with the induction of a 32-member cabinet representing a blend of experience and youth.

 President Pervez Musharraf administered the oath of office to the new ministers who will be allotted portfolios later. Prime Minister Aziz preferred to retain twenty veterans, who also served in the cabinets of former Premiers Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein and Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali.

 A significant addtion to the cabinet was former ISI chief General (Retired) Javed Ashraf Qazi. The veteran, who served as railway minister under Musharraf in the three-year military rule, is tipped to be the new interior minister. Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri is likely to continue as foreign minister.

 Among the old faces are former interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat, Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, Rao Sikandar Iqbal and Naurez Shakoor all key members of the Pakistan Peoples Party (Patriots). The party had parted ways from Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party after the October 2002 elections and joined the Musharraf government.

 The party, which is known for its close ties with President Pervez Musharraf, has staunchly supported the military rulers intention to continue as the army chief. The majority of the twelve new ministers who made it to the cabinet belong to the allied parties of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam).

 Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, one of the veterans who joined the new cabinet, said after the swearing-in that at least a dozen state ministers will also join the cabinet on Friday.

 Ahmad said that majority of the junior ministers would represent youth in the parliament as part of Musharrafs desire to groom young leaders.

 Qaida arrests

 Security forces arrested two important al Qaida operatives, including an Egyptian and a Saudi national, officials said today. 

 The pair, Egyptian Abdul Sattar Sharif ul Misri and Saudi national Abdul Hakeem, were arrested in Quetta on Monday, officials said.

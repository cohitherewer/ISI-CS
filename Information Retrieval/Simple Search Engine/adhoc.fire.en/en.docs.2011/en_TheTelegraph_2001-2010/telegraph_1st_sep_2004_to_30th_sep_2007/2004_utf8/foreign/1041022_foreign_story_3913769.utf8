 Fine Print

 Husband hound

 Sydney, Oct. 21 (Reuters): A Chinese woman living in Sydney has taken the unusual step of advertising for a husband on a billboard outside a cinema in Sydney?s eastern suburbs.

 Zhou, from Shanghai, said she had tried Internet dating but found men did not want to commit. ?People are happy to date but they dont want any commitment, only temporary relationships,? the middle-aged Zhou told her weekly local newspaper, the Southern Courier.

 Zhou spent A$5,000 (US$3,700) on the billboard which has a large headline: ?HUSBAND WANTED? and a lists of requirements, such as age up to 45, good health, non-smoker and drinker, caucasian, solid financial background and a good sense of humour. ?I?m not fussy,? said Zhou, who describes herself on the billboard as a beautiful and intelligent woman seeking a ?dream family with a fabulous partner?.

 Dutch drive

 Amsterdam (Reuters): Dutch police fined 

 the driver of a small hatchback car after spotting a Shetland 

 pony crammed in the back, police said on Thursday. ?The 

 small Shetland pony had no room to move and his head was 

 pressed against the window,? police said. A woman on the 

 back seat held the animal by a rope. Police fined the 42-year-old 

 German driver of the Volkswagen Polo 220 euros ($277.1) 

 for improper transport of the animal, just bought on a local 

 Dutch market.

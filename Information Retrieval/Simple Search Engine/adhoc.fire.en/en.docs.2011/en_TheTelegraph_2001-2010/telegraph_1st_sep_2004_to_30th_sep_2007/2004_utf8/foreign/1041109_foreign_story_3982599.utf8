 Plot to bury Arafat: wife

 - Suha spars with aides

 Paris, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Yasser Arafat?s wife accused Palestinian leaders today of plotting to ?bury him alive?, but they decided to go ahead with a visit to the critically ill Palestinian president at a French military hospital.

 Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie, foreign minister Nabil Shaath and Palestine Liberation Organisation secretary General Mahmoud Abbas planned to leave the West Bank for Jordan and then go to Paris, a senior Palestinian official said.

 Another Palestinian official said they would discuss Arafat?s medical condition with senior French officials tomorrow.

 Israeli media had reported the 75-year-old president would be taken off life-support equipment after the three leaders had visited him in the hospital?s intensive care unit.

 The leaders? departure from the West Bank appeared to have been delayed following a scathing verbal attack by Arafat?s wife Suha.

 ?I appeal to you to be aware of the scope of the conspiracy,? shouted Suha Arafat, speaking on Arabic Al Jazeera satellite television and sparking a war of words with loyalists of the three officials.

 ?They are trying to bury Abu Ammar (Arafat) alive,? she said in comments that flew in the face of efforts by Arafat?s lieutenants to project an image of unity and business as usual at a time when many Palestinians fear chaos if he dies. ?Abu Ammar is well and he is coming back to his homeland,? she said, accusing the three leaders of being desperate to succeed him.

 After her remarks, Palestinian and French officials said the trip from the West Bank had been called off.

 But Mohammed Dahlan, a former security chief close to Abbas and an influential leader in Arafat?s Fatah faction, said later: ?There is no change of plan. The delegation is going to Paris.?

 Palestinian officials have privately accused Suha Arafat of limiting access to and information about the veteran leader. ?We express our utmost regret at the comments made by sister Suha,? Qurie said in Ramallah.

 Islamabad Dec. 10: A powerful bomb exploded near an army truck in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta today, killing at least 10 people and injuring more than 21, officials said.

 The bomb was mounted on a bicycle and went off as the army truck was being parked in the Meezan Chown area of Quetta. Initial investigations revealed the bomb weighed 15-20 kg and was set off with a timer device.

 The blast in the centre of the city wrecked the army truck and at least eight other vehicles. At least 10 shops in a business district were also damaged, witnesses said. Human body parts and blood were splattered around the busy square, which was sealed off by the security forces.

 Senior police official Pervaiz Bhatti said the bomber chased the truck to the market and mounted the explosive device on the bicycle after after starting the timer.

 However, when asked whether the bombing was in reaction to the recent arrests of al Qaida terrorists and their supporters who are linked to militant outfits in Quetta, Bhatti said: ?There is nothing of the sort. The pattern is altogether different.? 

 Baluchistan, Pakistans largest but most backward province, borders Afghanistan and is a home to hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees.

 Pakistani security forces have deployed thousands of troops along the Afghan frontier to stop cross-border movements by the Taliban.

 The Taliban enjoy huge support in the Islamic schools of this province, which are mainly run by Pashtun clerics. Most of the Taliban are also Pashtuns.

 But militant Baluch nationalists demanding greater political and economic rights have also launched attacks in the province.

 ?These nationalist elements normally avoid civilian casualties while targeting officials and installations for the sake of their own popularity?, Bhatti said. Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad also blamed these elements for promoting instability in the country at a time when Pakistan is playing an important role in the war against terror.

 At least 164 people have been killed and 600 wounded in terrorism-related incidents this year in Pakistan. 

 A state of emergency has been declared in all hospitals in Quetta where the injured are being treated.

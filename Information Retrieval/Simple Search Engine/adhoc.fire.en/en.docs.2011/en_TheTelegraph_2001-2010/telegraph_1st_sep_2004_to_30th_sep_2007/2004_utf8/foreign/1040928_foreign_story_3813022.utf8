 Ghastly talent of a ?jihadi?

 Islamabad, Sept. 27 (Reuters): 

 Amjad Hussain Farooqi, who was shot dead by security 

 forces yesterday, was one of Pakistan?s most wanted men, 

 a cohort of September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 

 and a key link between al Qaida and local Pakistani militants.

 Officials earlier this year described Farooqi, who has used various aliases including Imtiaz Farooqi, Haider and Mansoor Hussain, as Pakistan?s most wanted man and said his arrest would help smash militancy and al Qaida activity in the country. That may be an overly optimistic assessment, given that key militant leaders remain free, but Farooqi, who was in his thirties, clearly had been a significant player.

 Farooqi hailed from a village in the Toba Tek Singh district of Pakistan?s Punjab province known not by a name, but a number ? 682/27-GB. Residents there say he joined militants in Kashmir in 1988 while still in his early 20s and later trained with Osama bin Ladens al Qaida in Afghanistan. He established high-level contacts within the network, including with its number three, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was arrested in Pakistan last year.

 In more than a decade as a jihadi, or ?holy warrior?, Farooqi honed motivational techniques that allowed him to recruit no less than 200 men from his home village alone to resist the US-led overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. He had also demonstrated a macabre talent for convincing impressionable young men to lay down their lives as suicide bombers in the name of Islam, Pakistani officials say.

 He has been linked with several banned militant groups, including Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami and Jaish-e-Mohammad, both of which have had members arrested for attempting to kill Musharraf. Farooqi dropped off the radar screen after Pearls murder, but a crackdown launched after the two attempts on Musharrafs life in December proved his undoing. His trail began to warm this year and police and intelligence agents say they narrowly missed nabbing him in the cities of Karachi, Faisalabad, Quetta and Lahore in recent weeks.

 First family tableau

Washington, Nov. 3: As aides juggled nerve-racking election returns, President Bush invited reporters into the White House last night to record the tableau of the President, his family and his dog serenely watching the numbers that would determine whether he achieved the re-election that had eluded his father.

 ?We?re very upbeat, thank you,? Bush said when asked how it was going. Pressed on whether the winner would be clear, he said with a smile: ?I believe I will win, thank you very much.?

 In a reversal of fortune from 2000, the election-night surprises this time were all promising for Bush. White House officials concluded that it was statistically impossible for Kerry to win. A veteran of the recount wars raised a glass of white wine in the West Wing. 

 When Bush received reporters in his residence past his usual bedtime, the setting was designed to project confidence after a grim day around the White House. With discouraging exit polls pouring into Bush-Cheney campaign headquarters in Arlington, Bush strategists privately described the early picture as cataclysmic. But they started reminding reporters and top supporters that those polls had been wrong in 2000, and they asserted that Bush was doing better than the figures suggested.

 With cameras crowded into his West Sitting Hall on the White House?s rarely visited second floor, Bush broke the ice by asking Barney, the family?s Scottish terrier, if he had anything to say. First lady Laura Bush, his parents and others were crammed onto a sofa, with Bush?s daughter Barbara perched on one arm. ?Enjoy working with you all,? Bush said. 

 Bush?s father, former President George H.W. Bush, said he felt ?good? as he walked briskly over to the Roosevelt Room. National security adviser Condoleezza Rice said she was spending part of the time in the quiet of her office and joked that she would be happy to discuss the Ukrainian election. ?Democracy in America is a little more complicated,? she said.

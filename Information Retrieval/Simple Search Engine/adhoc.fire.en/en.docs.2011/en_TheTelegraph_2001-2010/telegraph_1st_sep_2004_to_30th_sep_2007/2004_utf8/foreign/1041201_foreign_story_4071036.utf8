 Eight-hour history in the making on runway

 Frankfurt, Nov. 30 (Reuters): 

 Working through the night to rebuild Frankfurt airport?s 

 crumbling runway, workers face not only a ?no-compromises 

 deadline? to finish by dawn when jets start landing again 

 but unexploded World War Two bombs as well.

 In a carefully orchestrated operation that must be done in less than eight hours, they race the clock under spotlights to remove a 15-metre long slice of the airport?s 60-metre wide tarmac and insert three layers of fast-cooling asphalt.

 Making history with the world?s first such project, the practised team of 300 construction workers are turning the 4,000-metre runway that pilots once dismissed as a ?potato field? into what could be the smoothest landing ever. Three small bombs ? dangerous relics of fighting at the airport during World War II ? have been found beneath the tarmac and defused since the renovation began in April 2003. 

 Explosives experts carefully check the opened pit for bombs each night. ?We knew we needed to replace the runway but the airport would have gone bankrupt if we shut down for five months to do it,? said Gregor Rajewski, project manager for Frankfurt Airport?s runway reconstruction due to be finished next May.

 ?We had to find a way to put in a new runway without closing it down. The runway is the most important part of any airport. It?s the heart. What we came up with is open-heart surgery.?

 Each night at 10.30 pm, the air traffic control tower closes the runway and gives the construction crew the all-clear to roll out their pre-mixed asphalt.

 Four giant vehicles with heavy-duty jackhammers roll onto the runway and have exactly 90 minutes to break the 60-cm thick cement runway into 1,400 tonnes of rubble. Another set of vehicles scoop the broken cement into waiting trucks. At 12.30 am, after explosives experts give the all-clear, roller vehicles compress the ground base and half-an-hour later heat-resistant cable ducts for runway lighting are put in.

 The layers of the special fast-cooling asphalt are then poured into place and compressed by rollers. In a schedule measured by minutes, they?re finished by 4 am. Electric cables and lighting for the runway are then replaced. At 5 am the runway markings are painted and any leftover debris is cleared away. The critical issue was ensuring temperatures of the asphalt would drop beneath 85 degrees Celsius by 6 am when the first jets arriving from Asia and North American start landing.

 The high tech asphalt cools from 130 to 85 degrees within 90 minutes. The construction work stops in the summer, because the surface might not cool sufficiently by 6 am.

 Despite the speed each night, the reconstruction has progressed at snails pace ? 15 metres (yards) at a time. After each 150-metre section is finished, four centimetres of the surface are shaved off and a final asphalt surface is applied ? with the workers guided by laser beams for extra accuracy.

 ?The finished segments are as flat as a ping pong table,? said Rajewski proudly. ?The pilots dont complain anymore. Some of them cant believe what weve done and come at night to watch us work. When its done, itll be the best runway in the world.?

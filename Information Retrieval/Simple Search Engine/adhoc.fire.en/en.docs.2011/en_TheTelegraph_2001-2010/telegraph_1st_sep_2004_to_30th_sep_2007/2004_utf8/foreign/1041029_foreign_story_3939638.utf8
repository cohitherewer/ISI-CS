 Blast in Pak hotel

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Oct. 28: At least seven people were injured, two of them foreigners, in a powerful explosion at the Marriott Hotel late tonight.

 Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad told reporters that electronic short-circuiting caused the explosion in the main lobby of the hotel. The Marriot, a favourite choice of foreigners, is located close to the President?s residence and the parliament house.

 Senior security officials and doctors at Islamabad?s Poly Clinic hospital said one of the two foreigners is an Italian. They added that nationality of the other foreigner, who suffered at least 95 per cent burn injuries, has not yet been ascertained.

 The state-run Pakistan Television showed shards of glass littering the hotel lobby, where the roof had caved in.

 Many people were present in the main lobby, reception and dining hall when the explosion took place. One of the visitors, who did not want to be identified, said it was a bomb explosion.

 But inspector-general of police, Islamabad, Fayyaz Tooro denied the claim, saying it was not an incident of terrorism. Showing burnt wires, he said they caused the short circuit.

 Interior minister Aftab Sherpao said forensic experts and intelligence officials were examining the site to determine the cause of blast. Hotel officials said they had started evacuating a large number of guests.

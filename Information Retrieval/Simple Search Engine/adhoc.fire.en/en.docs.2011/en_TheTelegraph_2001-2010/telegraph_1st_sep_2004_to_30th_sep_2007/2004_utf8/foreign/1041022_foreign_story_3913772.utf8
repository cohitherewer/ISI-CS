 Liverpool snuffs out smoking

 London, Oct. 21 (Reuters): The northern English port of Liverpool has voted to become the first city in Britain to follow New York?s example by banning smoking in the workplace.

 While health officials in London are still debating whether to impose a national ban, Liverpool local politicians voted 57-7 to snuff out smoking in restaurants, bars, pubs and offices. ?The health of the people of Liverpool cannot wait until the government finally decides what action it takes,? a city council spokesman said today.

 Liverpool?s move added it to a growing number of cities, states and countries that have imposed sweeping curbs on workplace smoking.

 New York moved against smokers last year and in March Ireland became the first country in the world to impose a nationwide ban.

 ?This overwhelming majority sends a clear message ... about the way the council feels to the government, who are currently debating national legislation on this,? said Andy Hull, Liverpool?s environmental health officer. British scientists were the first to document the health risk of smoking, which is the leading cause of lung cancer and raises the risk of other diseases.

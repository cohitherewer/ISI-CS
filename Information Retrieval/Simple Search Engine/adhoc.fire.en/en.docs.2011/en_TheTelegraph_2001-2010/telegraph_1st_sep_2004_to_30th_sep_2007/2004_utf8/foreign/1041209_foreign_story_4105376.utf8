 Back from dead rapper sweeps nominations

 Chicago rapper Kanye West, who survived a near-fatal car crash to score one of the biggest hits of the year with his debut album, led an eclectic field of commercially successful Grammy Award contenders with 10 nominations, organisers said yesterday.

 R amp;B singers Alicia Keys and Usher picked up eight nominations each, followed by late ?Genius of Soul? Ray Charles with seven, and punk rock band Green Day with six.

 Jazz pianist Norah Jones, country veteran Loretta Lynn, funk musician Prince and engineer Al Schmitt each earned five. 

 West, whose nominations included the key categories of best new artist, album of the year and song of the year, said he was overwhelmed to receive so many nods. ?I won?t even lie. It?s really just as much scary as it makes you happy,? he said. Already a successful producer, West began recording his first album in 2001. But work was halted in October 2002 when he was involved in a car crash. Battered and bruised with his jaw wired shut, he returned to record the track Through the Wire, which related his experience.

 His debut album, The College Dropout has sold over 2.5 million copies in the US since its February release. It will compete for album of the year with Charles? posthumous duets album Genius Loves Company, Green Day?s American Idiot, Keys? The Diary of Alicia Keys and Usher?s Confessions.

 Green Day, which burst on the scene 10 years ago with its Grammy-winning major-label debut, becomes the first punk rock band to be nominated in this category, having topped the US charts with American Idiot in September. ?The older that you get and the longer that you?ve been around, for me, it?s a lot sweeter,? said Billie Joe Armstrong, the band?s singer/guitarist and primary songwriter. 

 It was a bittersweet experience for Ray Charles? friends and collaborators. The soul icon, who won 12 Grammys during his career, died of liver disease in June, aged 73. Charles will compete against himself in the pop collaboration with vocals category, with Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word (with Elton John) going up against Here We Go Again (with Norah Jones). Besides West, the other best new artist nominees were Texan rock trio Los Lonely Boys, country singer Gretchen Wilson and young English soul singer Joss Stone.

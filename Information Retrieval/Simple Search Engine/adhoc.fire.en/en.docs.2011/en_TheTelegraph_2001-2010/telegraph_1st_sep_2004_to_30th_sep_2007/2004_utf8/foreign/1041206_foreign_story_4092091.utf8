 French standoff

 Paris, Dec. 5 (Reuters): A soldier today threatened to blow up a site storing about 64 tonnes of munitions in eastern France, leading to the evacuation of about 400 inhabitants of three villages in the Marne region.

 The Marne district said the sergeant major, an explosives expert, had locked himself up at the site where he had worked to protest against his upcoming retirement. The depot mainly stores anti-tank mines.

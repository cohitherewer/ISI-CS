 Dylan memoirs

 Los Angeles, Sept. 27 (Reuters): 

 Singer-songwriter Bob Dylan said he didn?t find the process 

 of writing his new memoirs all ?that splendid,? according 

 to an article in the latest issue of Newsweek magazine.

 ?I?m used to writing songs,? the 63-year-old creator of such Sixties? hits as Like A Rolling Stone told the magazine. ?And songs ? I can fill ?em up with symbolism and metaphors. When you write a book like this, you gotta tell the truth, and it can?t be misinterpreted.?

 Dylan said he is proud of his book, Chronicles, Vol. 1, published by Simon amp; Schuster and excerpted in the magazine along with a rare interview. The book goes on sale next week. Dylan did not enjoy the process of writing it. ?Lest we forget, while you?re writing, you?re not living. What do they call it? Splendid isolation? I don?t find it that splendid.? Dylan banged out his book over three years on a manual typewriter. In it, he describes how it felt to be called the conscience of the Sixties generation. 

 ?That was funny. All I?d ever done was sing songs that were dead straight and expressed powerful new realities. I had very little in common with and knew even less about a generation that I was supposed to be the voice of.?

 Bush steams ahead of Kerry

 Washington, Sept. 10: President 

 Bush emerged from his New York convention with a solid lead 

 over Democratic challenger John F. Kerry, strengthening 

 his position on virtually every important issue in the campaign.

 He opened up a clear advantage on many of the personal characteristics that influence voters, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. For the first time in a Post-ABC News poll this year, a majority of probable voters say they plan to vote for Bush. Among those most likely to vote in November, Bush holds a lead of 52 per cent to 43 per cent over Kerry, with independent Ralph Nader receiving 2 per cent of the hypothetical vote. Among all registered voters, Bush leads Kerry 50 per cent to 44 per cent.

 Among a smaller sample in 19 battleground states, where strategists believe the election will be decided, Bush holds a narrower lead among likely voters, 50 per cent to 46 per cent. Among all voters in these states, the two candidates are running even. The survey highlights the damage to Kerry in August and during the Republican National Convention. Bush got a four-point ?bounce? in support among likely voters from his convention.

 But in other important ways, the poll suggests that Republicans achieved virtually all their objectives last week in New York, particularly their goal of making Kerry less acceptable to voters. What will not be known for another few weeks is whether Bush?s gains are transitory, as Kerry?s were in the immediate aftermath of his convention.

 Leave me alone: Law

 Sienna Miller and Jude Law

 London, Oct. 17 (Reuters): British actor Jude Law attacked the tabloid press today and said newspaper editors should realise that ?made up? stories could be very hurtful.

 While enjoying his acting success in films such as The Talented Mr. Ripley and the title role in upcoming remake Alfie, London-born Law said living in a country as small as Britain made him feel scrutinised.

 He urged the paparazzi to give him and his partner Sienna Miller more space. ?When you are hot you really want to cool down. You want a long cold drink and you need some air,? he told BBC television.

 ?People are very generous in the street... But at the same time there is the obvious tabloid attention and scrutiny which is uncomfortable,? he said. ?The constant attention and hounding by photographers, that?s an actual sort of physical violation.?

 Miller and Law met during the filming of Alfie and the pair turned on-screen chemistry into an off-screen romance. 

 This week Miller denied newspaper reports they were engaged.

 Law lamented how waking up to read the story of their ?engagement? put him in a awkward situation. ?There?s nothing more uncomfortable than being very happy and very much together and receiving endless phone calls from family and friends saying ?well done? because then you have to deny it,? he said.

 ?I think it?s a terrible shame that the editors aren?t recognising their responsibility,? he said. ?It just seems so careless and nasty.?

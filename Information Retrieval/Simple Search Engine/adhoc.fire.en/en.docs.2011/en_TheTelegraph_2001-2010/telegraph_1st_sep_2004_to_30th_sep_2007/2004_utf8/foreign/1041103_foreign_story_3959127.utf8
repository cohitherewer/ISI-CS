 President of UAE dies

 Abu Dhabi, Nov. 2 (Reuters): The President of Opec member the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, died today and officials expected a smooth transfer of power in the oil-rich Gulf Arab country.

 Sheikh Zayed was in his early 90s and had suffered from poor health for a long time. 

 Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, the eldest son of Sheikh Zayed, will automatically take over as ruler of Abu Dhabi, the country?s capital. Sources expect the council to elect Sheikh Khalifa as the next President with power remaining in Abu Dhabi where nearly all the oil wealth is concentrated.

 Iran takes on UN

 Tehran, Sept. 19 (Reuters): Iran today rejected a UN resolution calling on it to freeze uranium enrichment activities and threatened to stop snap checks of its atomic facilities if its case were sent to the UN Security Council.

 It said that if the Security Council went as far as punishing Tehran with sanctions, Iran might follow North Korea and pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty altogether.

 Washington says Iran plans to use enriched uranium to make nuclear weapons, but Tehran says its nuclear programme is dedicated solely to generating electricity.

 The UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, unanimously adopted a resolution yesterday calling on Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment-related activities.

 ?Iran will not accept any obligation regarding the suspension of uranium enrichment,? chief nuclear negotiator Hassan Rohani told a news conference today. ?No international body can force Iran to do so.?

 His words chimed with the view of the Iranian parliament, which urged the government to ignore the resolution.

 Although the IAEA board termed the suspension a ?necessary? confidence-building measure, it observed that suspensions would be ?voluntary decisions? by Iran and not obligations, enabling Tehran to tell Iranians it was not acting under UN pressure.

 Rohani said Iran would stop allowing UN inspectors to make short-notice visits to its atomic facilities if its dossier were sent to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions.

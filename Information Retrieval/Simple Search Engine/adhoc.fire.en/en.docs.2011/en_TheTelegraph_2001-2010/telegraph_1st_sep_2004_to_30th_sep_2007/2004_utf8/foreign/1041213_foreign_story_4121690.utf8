 Fan frenzy for Sony game

 Tokyo, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Game fans braved a chilly Tokyo night in long lines to be among the first in the world to get their hands on Sony Corp?s Play Station Portable, the consumer electronics firm?s first handheld game machine.

 About 200,000 of the sleek black devices, able to play movies, music and games, went on sale early today morning as part of a drive by Sony to loosen rival Nintendo Co. Ltd?s iron grip on the market for handheld game machines.

 The Play Station Portable (PSP), at a price of 19,800 yen ($189), went on sale 10 days after the successful launch of Nintendo DS, a game machine the size of a paperback book with a wireless connection and two screens, one of which is touch-sensitive and works with a pen-like device.

 Analysts say both will sell well this holiday season, bringing the biggest buzz to the sector since Sony launched its PlayStation 2 game console in 2000, although Nintendo?s much greater production capacity will give it an initial edge in sales.

 Excitement over Play Station Portable, with high-quality graphics normally only seen on a full game console, has been building for months with the Japanese press eagerly comparing it with the rival Nintendo DS, made by the company that brought the world games featuring characters Pokemon, Mario and Donkey Kong.

 ?With the DS you can only play games, but with the PSP you can also play music and movies. There?s added value there,? said Asuka Senaga, a 24-year old company employee who lined up outside an electronics retailer in Shinjuku yesterday at 1400 GMT.

 Senaga bought a car-racing game, Namco?s Ridge Racers, to play with friends who also bought a PSP. Equipped with a wireless LAN feature, the Sony machine allows users to play games with each other over the Internet.

 Sony has displayed mannequins holding PSPs in stylish shops around Tokyo since mid-November to create a buzz around the product that goes beyond traditional game fans. Ahead of today?s launch, fans bought 500 PSPs for about 30 million yen ($286,000) in an online auction on November 25 for victims of an earthquake in northern Japan.

 Sandra awarded $7 million

 Austin (Texas), Oct. 15 (Reuters): 

 Sandra Bullock?s Texas dream house turned into an expensive 

 nightmare but yesterday a jury awarded her $7 million in 

 a lawsuit against the builder.

 The star of Miss Congeniality and Speed testified in the two-month long trial that she had paid $7 million for the 930-sq-metre house on Lake Austin, but had never lived in it because of construction flaws. The house, which was begun in 1998 and still is not completed, had water damage, a bad roof, wiring problems and holes in the masonry.

 Builder Benny Daneshjou denied any wrongdoing and said he would appeal. ?We?re just basically ending up holding the bag on everything for the present, but we?ll deal with it,? he said.

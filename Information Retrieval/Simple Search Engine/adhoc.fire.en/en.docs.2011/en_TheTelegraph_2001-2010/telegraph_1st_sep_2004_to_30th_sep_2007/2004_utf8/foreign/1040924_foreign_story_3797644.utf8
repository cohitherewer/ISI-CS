 Karuna?s brother killed 

 Colombo, Sept. 23 (Reuters): A renegade leader of the Tamil Tigers has been killed in a firefight in Sri Lanka?s restive east, the rebel group said today, the latest in a rash of killings marring a truce that halted two decades of civil war.

 The LTTE denied any hand in the death of Reggie, the brother and deputy of breakaway commander Karuna who defected from the group earlier this year. But killings have been rife in the rebel-held east since the split and the government blames internecine feuding among the rebels. The Tigers, blacklisted by the US state department as a foreign terrorist organisation, are renowned for stamping down on any dissent ruffling their legendary discipline.

 ?Reggie and two more cadres have been killed,? Tiger spokesman Daya Master said by telephone from the rebels? northern stronghold of Kilinochchi. ?We were not involved.? The Tigers accuse the Sri Lankan army of helping Karuna, who is now living in hiding, to wage a silent war against them. Nordic officials monitoring a two-year ceasefire brokered by Norway dispatched monitors to investigate the latest killings.

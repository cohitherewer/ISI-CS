 Monkey embryo clone hope for humans

 New York, Oct. 24 (PTI): 

 In a major scientific development, US biologists have cloned 

 monkey embryos and successfully transferred them into monkey 

 mothers. 

 ?If researchers are able to repeat this process in monkeys, it might help them to refine the tricky technique without experimenting on human eggs and embryos, which are very difficult to obtain,? Nature magazine reported.

 It might help solve the mystery whether human embryonic stem cells, which can grow in a variety of tissues, will prove useful in medicine, it said. Although none of the resulting pregnancies lasted more than a month, this is by far the closest scientists have come to cloning a primate, the magazine said. 

 The study was released on Friday by reproductive biologist Gerald Schatten of the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the annual meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Philadelphia. Schatten?s team copied a technique used earlier this year to clone a human embryo and extract embryonic stem cells, the report said. 

 Schatten and his colleagues had struggled to create healthy monkey embryos by cloning, which involves removing the DNA-containing nucleus from an adult cell and inserting it into an egg stripped of its own nucleus.

 In a study published in 2003 Schatten suggested that extracting the nucleus from a monkey e gg also robs it of two proteins essential for survival. The resulting embryos were found having fatal chromosomal defects giving rise to speculations that cloning primates, including humans might be impossible.

 Schatten?s theory, Nature said, proved false in February this year, when scientists from South Korea announced they had successfully cloned human embryos.

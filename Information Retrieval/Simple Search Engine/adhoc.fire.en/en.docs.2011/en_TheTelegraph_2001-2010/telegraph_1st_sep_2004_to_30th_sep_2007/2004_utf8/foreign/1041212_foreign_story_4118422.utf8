 Bush security nominee quits

 Bernard Kerik

 Washington, Dec. 11 (Reuters): President George W. Bush?s pick to become homeland security secretary, former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik, abruptly withdrew his nomination yesterday due to what he said were questions over the immigration status of a housekeeper and nanny he employed.

 Kerik?s surprise decision sent the White House scrambling for a new candidate to oversee the nation?s sprawling department of homeland security, charged with helping prevent a repeat of the September 11, 2001, attacks.

 Bush?s current homeland security adviser, Frances Townsend, is one possible candidate. Others include undersecretary Asa Hutchinson and Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.

 Kerik, 49, nominated by Bush little more than a week ago, said in his withdrawal letter to the President that he discovered the problems about his housekeeper and nanny while completing documents required for Senate confirmation to the post, whose duties include enforcement of immigration laws.

 Kerik?s is the latest high-level nomination since the 1990s derailed by tax and immigration issues related to domestic help. 

 Kerik said he feared that the disclosure would ?only serve as a significant and unnecessary distraction to the vital efforts of the department of homeland security.?

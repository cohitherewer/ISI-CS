 Hamza charged, no extradition

 London, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri was charged by British police today with 16 offences including encouraging the murder of non-believers, meaning a US extradition attempt was put on hold.

 Abu Hamza, who lost an eye and both hands in Afghanistan fighting Soviet forces, is wanted by the US over 11 alleged offences and a full five-day extradition hearing had been due to start today.

 However this was postponed as the British case takes precedence and tight legal restrictions mean details of the US charges could not be given.

 The cleric, a former nightclub security guard who has preached in support of Osama bin Laden and the September 11 attacks, faces 10 charges of inciting his followers to kill non-Muslims. Four of the charges say he urged the killing of Jews.

 He is also accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour with intent to stir up racial hatred, one charge of possessing threatening, abusive or insulting sound recordings and one charge of possessing a ?terrorist? document.

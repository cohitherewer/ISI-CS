 Bid to move US families out of Nepal

 Kathmandu, Sept. 13 (Reuters): The US ambassador to Nepal urged Washington today to allow families of embassy officials in Kathmandu to return home due to security concerns, days after suspected rebels bombed the local American Center.

 Ambassador James Moriarty?s move came after two bombs exploded on Friday in the compound of the American information centre and library, located in the heart of the Nepali capital. 

 The blast caused minor damage to property but no one was injured as the centre had closed for the day.

 ?In light of the current security situation, the ambassador is recommending that the US state department allow the family members of the official community to depart Nepal if they wish,? a US embassy statement said.

 ?In addition, he is recommending the temporary suspension of the Peace Corps programme in Nepal,? the statement said, referring to the US government agency that works for community development around the world.

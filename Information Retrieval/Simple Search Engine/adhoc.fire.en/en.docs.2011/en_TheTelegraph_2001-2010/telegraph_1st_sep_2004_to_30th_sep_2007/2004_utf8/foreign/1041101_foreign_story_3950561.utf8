 Death deadline hangs on UN hostages

 Kabul, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Militants holding three foreign UN workers in Afghanistan have threatened to kill them unless all Taliban and al Qaida prisoners are released from US custody by 0730 GMT on Wednesday.

 The leader of Jaish-e-Muslimeen (Army of Muslims) said that the UN must also cease operations in Afghanistan, or the hostages would be killed ?in such a way by which Muslims will be happy?.

 The group also released a video of the hostages to the Arabic TV channel Al Jazeera today showing them in good health. The three ? Filipino Anjelito Nayan, Annetta Flanigan from Northern Ireland and Shqipe Hebibi from Kosovo ? were snatched from their UN vehicle in rush hour traffic on Thursday.

 They had been helping to organise Afghanistan?s first presidential election, which was held on October 9.

 Mullah Sayed Mohammed Akbar Agha, leader of the kidnap group, said in an interview that the group had four demands.

 ?The UN should leave Afghanistan and it should call Britain and America?s meddling in Afghanistan as illegal,? he said.

 ?Those who have no military involvement in Afghanistan, such as Philippines, must call Britain and America?s meddling in Afghanistan as illegal and must stop its contributions through the UN for America and Britain?s activities.?

 He also demanded that Kosovo and Britain immediately withdraw their forces from Afghanistan and that all Muslim prisoners in Afghanistan and Cuba, ?be they Taliban or al Qaida?, be freed.

 The kidnappings have stoked fears among the 2,000-strong foreign community that militants in Afghanistan may be copying tactics used by insurgents in Iraq.

 But a spokesperson for the Taliban ? the hardline Islamic regime ousted by a US-led coalition in November 2001 and now the main group fighting the government and more than 28,000 American and Nato troops in the country ? distanced the group from the kidnappings.

 ?We have no comment about the issue. It is their work and we are not involved in it,? said Hamid Agha, chief spokesperson for the Taliban.

 Another Jaish-e-Muslimeen commander, Sabir Mohmin, said that some members of President Hamid Karzai?s faction-ridden government had assisted the kidnappers.

 Karzai is the as-yet-undeclared winner of the election and is expected to choose a new cabinet by the end of November. A government official said Mohmin?s allegation that the kidnappers received help from a faction in government could be an attempt to exploit differences just as the interim government is going to be replaced by one of Karzai?s own choosing.

 The Jaish-e-Muslimeen have already proved they are holding the three by giving Reuters credit card numbers that authorities have confirmed are genuine.

 Security sources say so far the group has only contacted a handful of journalists in Kabul about the kidnappings, and investigators were trying to open up channels of communication with them.

 ?We call on those holding them not to harm them,? UN spokesperson Manoel de Silva e Almeida told a news briefing today. ?All three require medical attention and the best response to such a situation is their immediate release.?

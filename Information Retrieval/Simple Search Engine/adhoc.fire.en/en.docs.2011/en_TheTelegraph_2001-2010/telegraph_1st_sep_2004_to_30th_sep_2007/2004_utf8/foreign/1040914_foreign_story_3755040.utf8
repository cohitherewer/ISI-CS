 Pak troops clash with militants in tribal area

 Wana (Pakistan), Sept. 13 (Reuters): Pakistani troops and gunship helicopters fired on al Qaida-linked militants in the western tribal region today, a day after fierce fighting killed up to 10 people in the area, officials and residents said.

 Residents said the latest clashes, which also involved army artillery fire, were only sporadic in the rugged South Waziristan tribal region near the Afghan border, where US military officials say Osama bin Laden and close associates may be hiding.

 ?We have reports of two tribesmen killed in bombardment by the army this afternoon,? said a resident of Laddha, where security forces and Islamic militants have been pounding each others? positions since Saturday night.

 ?The army has moved in to the main bazaar of Makeen,? said the resident, who wished not to be named.

 Makeen is a market town with hundreds of shops lining its streets in Laddha, 50 km north of South Waziristan?s main town of Wana, itself located about 400 km southwest of the capital, Islamabad. A legislator from the tribal area, Maulana Mirajuddin, said in Islamabad that many civilians had been killed in clashes during the past week.

 He accused the government of killing ?innocent civilians? and targeting the homes of tribesmen.

 ?The military is hitting at precise targets,? military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan said in Karachi. Since Thursday, more than 60 militants had been killed, mostly foreigners, he said, adding that Pakistani security forces lost three soldiers. According to Sultan, more than 150 foreign militants had been killed in the area since March.

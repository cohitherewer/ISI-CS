 Crack the Kyoto puzzle

 What is the Kyoto protocol?

 It is a pact agreed by governments at a 1997 UN conference in Kyoto, Japan, to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by developed nations by 5.2 per cent of 1990 levels during the five-year period 2008-2012. A total of 122 nations have ratified the pact or acceded to it, according to UN data.

 Is it the first agreement of its kind?

 Governments originally agreed to tackle climate change at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. At that meeting, leaders created the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which set a non-binding goal of stabilising emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, a goal not met overall. The Kyoto protocol is the follow-up to that and is the first legally binding global agreement to cut greenhouse gases.

 So it?s legally binding?

 It is binding once it has been ratified by at least 55 nations and by countries representing at least 55 percent of developed countries? carbon dioxide emissions. Kyoto has been ratified by 126 states but has so far only received pledges from nations representing 44 per cent of total emissions.

 Russia holds the key to Kyoto?s success or failure with its 17 per cent share of emissions by developed nations. US President George W. Bush pulled out in 2001, arguing Kyoto was too expensive and unfairly excludes developing nations. The US is the biggest polluter with a 36 per cent share.

 When will it enter into force?

 Kyoto will apply worldwide 90 days after Russia completes ratification formalities, including approval by the Duma, upper house and signature by its key advocate, President Vladimir Putin.

 How will it be enforced?

 Under a 2001 deal made by environment ministers in Bonn, Germany, if countries emit more gases than allowed under their targets at the end of 2012, they will be required to make the cuts, and 30 per cent more, in the second commitment period which is due to start in 2013. They rejected the idea of a financial penalty.

 Does every country have to reduce emissions by 5.2 per cent?

 No, only 39 countries ? relatively developed ones ? have target levels for the 2008-12 period, adhering to the principle established under the UNFCCC that richer countries should take the lead. Each country negotiated different targets, with Russia aiming for stabilisation at 1990 levels and the European Union trying for an 8 per cent cut.

 How are they doing so far?

 Most countries are lagging targets under Kyoto. The UNFCCC secretariat says emissions by Spain and Portugal were worst, at 40.5 per cent above 1990 levels in 2002 while US emissions, for instance, were up 13.1 per cent. Emissions by ex-communist bloc states had fallen most sharply after the collapse of Soviet-era industries ? Russian emissions were down 38 per cent from 1990.

 What are greenhouse gases? 

 Greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. The main one is carbon dioxide (CO2), most of which comes from burning fossil fuel. The protocol also covers methane (CH4), much of which comes from agriculture and waste dumps, and nitrous oxide (N2O), mostly a result of fertiliser use. Three industrial gases used in various applications, such as refrigerants, heat conductors and insulators, are also included. 

 What happens to countries that miss the target?

 The protocol provides for ?flexible mechanisms? ? ways for countries to reach their targets without actually reducing emissions at home. These include emissions trading ? where one country buys the right to emit from another country which has already reduced its emissions sufficiently and has ?spare? emissions reductions.

 Another is the ?clean development mechanism? where developed countries can earn credits to offset against their targets by funding clean technologies, such as solar power, in poorer countries.

 Countries can also claim credits for planting trees in the Third World that soak up CO2 -- so-called carbon ?sinks?.

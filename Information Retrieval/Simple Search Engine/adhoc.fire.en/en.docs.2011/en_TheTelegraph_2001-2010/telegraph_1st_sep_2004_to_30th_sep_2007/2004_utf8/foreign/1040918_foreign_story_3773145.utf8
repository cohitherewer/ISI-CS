 Big splash of cash for Cash collectibles

 New York, Sept. 17 (Reuters): A three-day auction of items owned by the late Johnny and June Carter Cash raised nearly $4 million, more than twice the amount expected, as over 1,000 bidders snapped up property from the country music icons.

 A 1986 Grammy that went for $187,200 was the most expensive item sold, auction house Sotheby?s said. The winning bid was nearly 27 times the $7,000 expected price.

 ?We?re thrilled with the results,? said Leila Dunbar, head of Sotheby?s collectibles department. ?It?s been an extremely intense group of people showing their admiration for Johnny and June, which is not surprising, given the lengths of their careers and the accomplishments of their careers.?

 The total for the auction was $3.98 million, Sotheby?s said. The sale was expected to bring in about $1.5 million.

 The Grammy that pulled in the top bid was awarded for best spoken word or non-musical recording. Johnny Cash shared it with Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Rick Nelson and record producers Sam Phillips and Chips Moman for interviews taped during a 1985 reunion of the music legends.

 Dubbed the ?Man in Black? because of his trademark black stage garb, Cash recorded hundreds of songs in a career spanning almost 50 years. June joined his touring show in 1960 and performed with him for three decades.

 Other top bids included $131,200 for a custom-made Grammer model guitar used by Cash on his tours. The guitar was expected to bring in $10,000 to $20,000.

 A hand-crafted black Martin guitar, often used in Cash?s publicity photos, also went for $131,200.

 Mosques fuel Iraq attacks

 Amman, Dec. 2: A network of Syrian mosques is sending men, money and weapons to Iraq, fuelling the insurgency.

 An investigation by the Daily Telegraph has shown that Arab volunteers are streaming across the border despite Damascus government claims that it is curbing cross-border terrorism.

 Much of the traffic is financed by former members of Saddam Hussein?s regime living in the Syrian capital and has the backing of prominent tribal leaders.

 Under intense pressure from America and the Iraqi government, Syria recently began building an earthern rampart along its 400-mile frontier with Iraq and has closed crossing points.

 ?We are doing our best,? said Adham Marmadi, a Syrian foreign ministry official. ?We have long borders that cannot be controlled fully.?

 Such assurances have done little to change the reality. Support for the Iraqi resistance is widespread in Syria amid fears of an American invasion of the country.

 Several hundred Syrians are recruited, equipped and sent to Iraq every month. Iraqi exiles say that members of Saddam?s former Ba?athist regime pay ?1,600 a month to the families of the fighters.

 A senior American official said: ?Most of what is bad that comes into Iraq comes from Syria and I have seen little to change my mind about that.? 

 Troop boost

 The US military will boost its troops in Iraq to 150,000 this month, the highest level since the war began in March 2003, in order to improve security for scheduled January 30. elections, the Pentagon said yesterday. The increased total from 138,000 now in Iraq will continue until March and extend the promised year-long Iraq tours of 8,100 Army soldiers to 14 months and the seven-month tours of 2,300 Marines to nine months.

 In addition to the battlehardened troops whose tours are being extended to face a growing insurgency, 1,500 members of the elite 82nd Airborne Division based in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, will be sent to Iraq within days and remain for about three months to help bolster security.

 Previously, the largest number of US troops on the ground in Iraq during the 20-month war was 148,000 in May 2003, defence officials said

 ?At this point in time, it?s going to be (a new total of) 150,000,? Brigadier General David Rodriguez said.

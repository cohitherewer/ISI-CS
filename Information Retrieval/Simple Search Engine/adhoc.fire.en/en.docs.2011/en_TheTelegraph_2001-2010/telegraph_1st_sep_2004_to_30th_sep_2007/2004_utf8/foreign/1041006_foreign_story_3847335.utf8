 Gaddafi son to help free Bigley

 Vienna, Oct. 5 (Reuters): The son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said today he was using his charity foundation contacts in Iraq to help free British hostage Kenneth Bigley, saying the next 48 hours would be crucial for his fate.

 Saif Gaddafi said Bigley?s family had contacted him about the 62-year-old engineer, kidnapped nearly three weeks ago by militants who have already beheaded two Americans seized with the Briton.

 ?The family called two days ago,? Gaddafi said in Vienna.?We have good contacts in Iraq. We have friends in hospitals ... tribal leaders and we are talking to them.? ?Today and tomorrow are crucial for him,? the 32-year-old said, speaking at the opening of an art exhibition showing the work of Libyan artists.

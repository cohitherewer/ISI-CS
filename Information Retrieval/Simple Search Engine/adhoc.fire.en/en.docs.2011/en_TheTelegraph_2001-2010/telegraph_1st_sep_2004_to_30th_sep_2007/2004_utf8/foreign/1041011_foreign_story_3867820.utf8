 Marker pens erase fear of militants

 Kandahar, Oct. 10 (Reuters): When the main talking point of Afghanistan?s landmark election is marker pens and not militant attacks, you know the Taliban have failed.

 For all the fiery threats of suicide bombs and bloodshed overshadowing the country?s first experiment with democracy, violence by remnants of the ousted militia was limited to minor skirmishes and some landmine attacks in remote areas. Afghan officials and international experts say it is too early to write off the hardline Islamic movement, and a low-level insurgency will continue to undermine rebuilding efforts, especially in the restive south and southeast.

 Mullah Obaidullah, former Taliban defence minister, said shortly before the poll that the Taliban were here to stay. ?Our jihad (holy war) will continue even after the election,? he said from an undisclosed location.

 But many believe yesterday?s election, which saw men and women ignore warnings and turn out to vote even in the most unstable districts, dealt the insurgents an ideological and operational blow.

 ?I don?t think they can motivate people in large numbers to support them,? said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a journalist and expert on the Taliban who is based in Peshawar, Pakistan. ?The Afghan people know very well if the Taliban returned to power, the country would again be isolated.?

 Now that the cosy relationship that once existed between the Taliban and Pakistan has weakened, experts say the insurgents are finding it harder to raise funds, recruit and plan attacks over the border. 

 That, combined with international reconstruction efforts and Taliban failures to match words with actions, may erode their support base.

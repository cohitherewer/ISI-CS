 Fine Print

 Costly cat

 London, Dec. 10 (Reuters): A medieval limestone slab which for years was used as a gravestone for a dead cat called Winkle fetched more than ?200,000 pounds at auction today.

 The stone has a carved image of St Peter on it and dates from the early 10th century. It was found in a salvage yard by a British man who took it to his home in Somerset, southwest England, and put it at the bottom of his garden to mark the spot where Winkle was buried.

 It was only when the stone was spotted by local potter and historian Chris Brewchorne that its value became apparent. ?I was walking past the house one day and saw it in the front garden and knew immediately I was looking at something special,? Brewchorne said.

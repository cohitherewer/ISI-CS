 Global warming clock ticking faster: Scientists

 CHARLES CLOVER

 London, Oct. 11: Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are rising faster than at any time since records began, figures reveal.

 Scientists cannot explain the unprecedented increase in 2002 and 2003 but they believe it is more likely to be the result of a natural phenomenon rather than a surge in burning of fossil fuels.

 The rise suggests that global warming is speeding up.

 A possibility raised by scientists at the British Meteorological Office?s Hadley Centre is that, as the world warms, it begins to release more carbon from natural sources which normally soak it up, such as forests, soils or oceans.

 Dr Charles Keeling, 76, who began the longest-running carbon dioxide measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in 1958, said the unprecedented rise was ?a cause for concern?.

 Carbon dioxide, mostly from the burning of coal, oil and gas, traps heat that otherwise would radiate into space. Temperatures increased by 0.6 degrees Celsius over the 20th century and an international panel of scientists has concluded that most of the warming was probably due to man-made greenhouse gasses.

 While it has yet to be proved categorically that such gases will cause the world to heat up over the next century, the debate among serious scientists is no longer whether the emissions are altering the climate, but by how much and whether the costs of repairing the damage are worth it.

 Before the industrial era, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at around 280 parts per million (ppm), scientists have determined. The average concentrations last year, according to the figures recorded by Dr Keeling?s equipment 11,141ft up Mauna Loa, Hawaii?s second highest volcano, were 375.64 ppm.

 The Mauna Loa records show that concentrations of the gas rose by 2.08 ppm in 2002 and 2.54 ppm in 2003, the first time successive years have seen an increase of more than two ppm.

 According to the US agency which runs the observatory, the monthly average rises in carbon dioxide this year were higher than the 20-year average until June, when the rate of increase tailed off. The rise for this year is expected to be just under two ppm.

 Peter Cox, the head of the carbon cycle group at the Hadley Centre, said the figures for 2002 and 2003 looked like ?an interesting anomaly? which ?could not simply be explained by greater fossil fuel emissions?.

 He added: ?There must be something else happening, adding carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. My guess is that there were extra forest fires in the northern hemisphere, and particularly a very hot summer in Europe. This led to a dieback in vegetation and an increase in release of carbon from the soil rather than more growing plants taking carbon out of the atmosphere which is usually the case in summer.?

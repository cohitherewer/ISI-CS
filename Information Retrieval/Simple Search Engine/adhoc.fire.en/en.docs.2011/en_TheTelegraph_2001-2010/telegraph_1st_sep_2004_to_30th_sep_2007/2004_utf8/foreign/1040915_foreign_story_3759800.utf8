 Adultery rethink in Turkey

 Ankara, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Turkey?s two main parties signalled today the government may be dropping plans for a controversial adultery ban that has outraged liberals, unnerved markets and irked the EU that Ankara wants to join.

 Several EU foreign ministers have said the proposal to punish cheating spouses as part of wider penal code amendments might jeopardise Turkeys chances when EU leaders decide in December whether to give it a start date for entry talks.

 After a last-minute meeting before parliament was due to debate the reforms, top officials of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and main Opposition Republican Peoples Party (CHP) said they would present the penal code package as a joint proposal.

 ?We have an agreement to put forward a law which guarantees rights and freedoms,? justice minister Cemil Cicek said in a joint announcement with CHP leader Deniz Baykal and foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.

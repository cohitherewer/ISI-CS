 Fine Print

 Baywatch on guard

 Los Angeles, Nov. 13 (AP): Baywatch may soon be joining the ranks of Dragnet, Starsky amp; Hutch, Scooby-Doo and Bewitched on the list of old TV shows made into movies.

 Movie rights to the skin, surf and sand series ? which starred Pamela Anderson as a sexy lifeguard and David Hasselhoff as her heroic boss ? have been sold to DreamWorks SKG. FreemantleMedia, which owned the rights to the series, announced the deal yesterday. The studio is aiming for a 2006 release, but it?s still too early to say whether any original cast members would appear in the film. 

 Paparazzi pique over Diaz

 Los Angeles (AP): Two photographers sued 

 Cameron Diaz and her boyfriend Justin Timberlake for assault 

 and battery, claiming the celebrity couple taunted and attacked 

 them outside a fancy hotel. Saul Lazo and Jose Gonzalez 

 said the Charlie?s Angels star and the pop singer 

 threatened them as they tried to photograph the couple on 

 November 6. The lawsuit filed yesterday said the photographers, 

 on assignment for a photo agency, did nothing to harass 

 the couple and stood more than three meters from them until 

 Diaz ran at Lazo, hit him in the neck and tripped him, snatching 

 his camera. Timberlake then allegedly screamed at the bleeding 

 photographer: ?What... are you going to do, man? I know 

 you are not going to do anything.?

 Harry peaceful on pampas

 Buenos Aires (Reuters): Prince Harry arrived in Argentina on Friday to work on a polo pony farm on the pampas, far from the paparazzi who haunt him at home. Buckingham Palace said the 20-year-old prince landed in the country but would not reveal the name or location of the farm. It said Harry would return to England for Christmas with his family.

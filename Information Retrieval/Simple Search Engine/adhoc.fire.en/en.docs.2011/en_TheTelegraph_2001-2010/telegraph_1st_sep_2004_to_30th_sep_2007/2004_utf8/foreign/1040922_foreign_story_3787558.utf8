 Massive protest for democracy in Nepal

 Kathmandu, Sept. 21 (Reuters): About 15,000 people marched in the Nepali capital today to call for the restoration of a dissolved parliament and the formation of an all-party government in the biggest protest in the city for several months.

 Four political parties represented in a parliament dissolved by King Gyanendra in 2002 have vowed to press ahead with their protest campaign, after it was briefly suspended for the beginning of the rainy season.

 ?The government is a pawn in the hands of the king,? said Ghanashyam Poudel, a member of the United People?s Front, one of the four parties behind the protest.

 King Gyanendra fired Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba two years ago but reappointed him in June after sustained, often violent, protests by main political parties which said the constitutional monarch had grabbed power.

 The four parties behind today?s protest have not accepted Deuba?s reappointment, saying it was unconstitutional.

 Riot police put up barbed wire barricades to stop the protesters from marching on the king?s palace, as they paraded through Kathmandu carrying red and white party flags.

 ?No to active monarchy,? read one placard carried by protesters. Some of them shouted: ?We want democracy and peace.? Deuba was fired in 2002 for failing to control an insurgency by Maoist rebels, who have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy and replace it with a communist state.

 In the latest violence, the army said 13 rebels were killed in several clashes yesterday and today in various parts of the mountainous country.

 Hundreds of Nepalis lit candles and lamps in Kathmandu yesterday to call for an end to the Maoist insurgency.

 Nearly 1,000 men and women, including several westerners, gathered at dusk and lit traditional lamps in a park where Buddhist paintings representing universal peace were put up.

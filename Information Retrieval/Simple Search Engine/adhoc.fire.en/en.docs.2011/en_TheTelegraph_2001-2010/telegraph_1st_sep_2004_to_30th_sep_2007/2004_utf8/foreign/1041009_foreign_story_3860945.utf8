 How Stella announced pregnancy

 Paris, Oct. 8: Stella McCartney chose the launch of her spring/summer collection in Paris yesterday to announce that she is three months pregnant with her first child.

 She married Alasdhair Willis in August last year, and their baby ? due next April or May ? will be Sir Paul McCartney?s third grandchild.

 Stella, 33, said she did not know if she was expecting a boy or girl. ?I want it to be a natural thing,? she added. ?I want the surprise.? Gwyneth Paltrow, a close friend of Stella, was a front-row guest at the pret-a-porter show with her own daughter, four-month-old Apple. 

 Stella probably had impending motherhood in mind as she designed the collection. It featured billowing drawstring smocks in white cotton voile and A-line tunics in pale turquoise chiffon strewn with silver sequins, all perfect for flattering a bump. The look was intended to bring a tropical holiday feel to the urban environment, Stella said.

 Long shift dresses with drawstring waists in pastel lace and muslin had the romantic appeal of Victorian nightdresses. The whole feel was light and airy.

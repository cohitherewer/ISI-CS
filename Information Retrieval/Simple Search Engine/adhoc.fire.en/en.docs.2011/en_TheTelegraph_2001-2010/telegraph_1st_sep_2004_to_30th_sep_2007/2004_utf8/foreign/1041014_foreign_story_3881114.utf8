 Germany in Iraq troops hint

 Berlin, Oct. 13 (Reuters): A senior German minister said today that the country, which staunchly opposed the US-led war to oust Saddam Hussein, could eventually send troops to Iraq, although he ruled out any such move for now.

 The government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder played down the remarks, made by German defence minister Peter Struck in a newspaper interview and a separate briefing to reporters at a Nato defence ministers summit in Romania.

 Struck?s comments could signal a subtle shift in the German stance, which until now has categorically rejected the idea of deploying soldiers to the insurgency-riven country, and could be linked to the US presidential election, analysts said.

 ?I have made very clear that within the foreseeable future, it is out of the question,? Struck said at the meeting in the Romanian ski resort of Poiana Brasovin, in response to a question about sending German troops to Iraq.

 ?But certainly there could be times ahead, in years to come, when Germany will get involved,? Struck added. In his 2002 re-election campaign Schroeder derided plans to attack Iraq as an adventure that would set West Asia ablaze. 

 Schroeder has said frequently in recent months that German troops, who are present in Afghanistan, would not go to Iraq. 

 He reiterated this message to his cabinet today, a source who attended the meeting said, and a government spokesman said: ?There will be no German soldiers sent to Iraq. That will not change?.

 Still, experts expressed doubt about whether Struck had simply misspoken and pointed to the timing of his comments, made hours before George W. Bush goes up against John Kerry in a third and final debate. 

 Allawi ultimatum

 Iraqs interim Prime Minister warned the rebel-held city of Falluja today it must hand over foreign militants or face a major operation to root them out.

 ?Termination? whispers grip Mossad

 Meir Dagan

 Herzliya (Israel), Dec. 14 (Reuters): They?re whispering about ?terminations? again behind the high walls of Mossad headquarters.

 But nowadays the term is as likely to refer to staff lay-offs at the Israeli foreign intelligence agency as to assassinating enemies of the Jewish state. As many as 200 spies, among them several section heads, have quit or been fired in the two years since retired general Meir Dagan took over Mossad with a mandate to hone the hunt for Islamist militants and track Iran?s atomic programme.

 ?Dagan needs to get results, which means emphasis on major missions at the cost of more passive information-gathering,? a senior intelligence analyst said. ?For some of the old hands, that?s just too much to ask.?

 The shake-up has spawned public squabbles, long unthinkable for the ultra-covert service, with regular media leaks by the Mossad chief?s backers and detractors.

 Dagan has stayed in the shadows. But an interview he gave while serving as a government counter-terrorism adviser pointed to an approach very different from the back-door diplomacy championed by his Mossad predecessor Efraim Halevy.

 ?In my opinion, no terrorist should feel immune, anywhere,? Dagan told Channel Two television in 1998. ?I see a person?s life as forfeit the moment he decides to adopt terror tactics.?

 Such attitudes suit hawkish Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who parachuted Dagan, an army comrade, into Mossad ? a break with the tradition of agency apparatchiks assuming the top job. After al Qaida blew up an Israeli-owned hotel and tried to shoot down an Israeli airliner in Kenya in November 2002, Sharon ordered Dagan to take the fight to Israel?s foes abroad.

 Three Lebanese guerrillas and a leading Palestinian militant in Damascus have since died in car-bombings blamed on Mossad. Sharon?s office did not deny the allegations. Indeed, Israeli security sources, in an unprecedented admission, took credit for the Syrian assassination last September.

 Media reports say Mossad has thwarted four attacks against Israelis abroad, three in Africa and one in Southeast Asia ? but without providing details or independent confirmation. 

 Yet with Israeli prestige battered by Sharon?s tough handling of a four-year-old Palestinian revolt, experts question if Mossad can afford to revive the deadly missions for which it was famed in the 1960s and 1970s.

 Mossad has been under pressure in recent years. That, sources say, led Dagan to conclude Mossad should focus on classic intelligence-gathering ? by spending more of the agency?s estimated annual budget of $350 million on spy missions worldwide.

 ?There is the sense that Dagan wants to jolt Mossad back into leading the fray, by getting rid of those staffers who are more interested in consensus-thinking and pensions,? a senior analyst said.

 Divorced father in cuffs stunt

 London, Nov. 19 (Reuters): A disgruntled British father handcuffed himself to a government minister today in a bid to draw attention to a campaign for divorced fathers? rights.

 Campaigner Jolly Stanesby pounced on minister for children Margaret Hodge at a conference in Manchester and snapped on a set of metal cuffs. Police freed the trapped minister with bolt cutters after half-an-hour.

 Fathers 4 Justice, which has staged a series of similar high profile stunts this year, claimed responsibility.

 The group is campaigning against what it says is a court bias towards mothers in determining how much access divorcing parents should have to their children.

 In May, they breached security at the House of Commons and pelted Prime Minister Tony Blair with flour-filled condoms.

 In September a member of the group dressed as Batman climbed a ledge on Queen Elizabeth?s Buckingham Palace residence. 

 Last month, campaigners dressed as Batman and The Hulk scaled a rollercoaster in the seaside resort of Blackpool.

 Fresh polls can lead to mending of ties with Pervez: Zardari

 Asif Ali Zardari

Karachi, Nov. 27 (Reuters): 

 Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto?s husband 

 said today only fresh elections and an end to military rule 

 could lead to a rapprochement between Bhutto?s party and 

 President Pervez Musharraf.

 ?We want free and fair election... and the return of the armed forces to barracks,? said Asif Ali Zardari, who walked out of prison earlier this week after the Supreme Court granted him bail in a corruption case.

 The sudden release of Zardari ? who languished in prison for eight years on corruption and criminal charges ? has raised speculation that relations could be patched up between Musharraf and Bhutto?s secular Pakistan Peoples? Party. Musharraf, a staunch ally of the US in the war on terror, is also the army chief. 

 Opposition parties want him to quit the military post, but Musharraf has indicated that would hurt Muslim Pakistans efforts as a US ally in its war on terror. Analysts say Bhutto?s party is close to Musharraf?s agenda of a liberal Pakistan, supporting the anti-terrorism fight. But Zardari said Musharraf?s liberal stance was only to appease the West.

 ?You cannot evolve a liberal society through bayonet,? he said in an interview.

 But there was a need for a consensus among all political forces on the need to ?demilitarise society? and end military intervention in politics, he said. Pakistan has been ruled by the army most of the time since it gained independence from Britain in 1947, and the military has a history of manipulating political parties.

 ?I am not asking the people to come on to the streets,? he said. ?But they should hold on to this thought that there will be elections. He (Musharraf) will go. She (Bhutto) will come back. We will get democracy ? soon.?

 Bhuttos party was ousted from power in November 1996 on graft charges. She has lived in exile since 1999 to escape arrest, dividing her time between the United Arab Emirates and England. When in power, Zardari was known as Mr Ten Percent for allegedly giving out state contracts in return for commission.

 But Zardari said that was propaganda. ?They wanted to weaken civil society,? he said. ?We were not doing anything and it has been proven during the test of time in eight years.? Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif admitted that he committed a mistake, he said.

 Army pulls out

 After months of operations to flush out al Qaida militants, the Pakistan army today said it is pulling out its troops and winding up checkposts from the headquarters of south Waziristan tribal region.

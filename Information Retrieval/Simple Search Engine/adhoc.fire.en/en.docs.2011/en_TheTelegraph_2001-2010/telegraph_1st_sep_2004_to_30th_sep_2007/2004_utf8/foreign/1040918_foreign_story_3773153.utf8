 10-year Pak plan for combat teeth

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Sept. 17: Pakistani military officials today said they had embarked on a 10-year development programme to improve the armed forces? combat capabilities and to end a military imbalance in South Asia. 

 ?We are working hard to implement the package in order to end a military imbalance and bolster defence and combat capabilities of our armed forces,? the vice chief of the army staff, General Mohammad Yusuf, said. 

 He was speaking some 70 km northwest of Karachi, after a firepower demonstration at the end of the five-day international defence exhibition and seminar in the port city. 

 Attended by over 4000 delegates from 66 countries, the exhibition focused on aggressively marketing Pakistani defence products, including tanks and military aircraft, and exploring the possibility of buying military equipment from participating countries. 

 ?The 10-year programme is being executed on the directives of President General Pervez Musharraf,? Yusuf said.

 The military imbalance between Pakistan and India increased over the years because of a series of economic and military sanctions imposed on the Islamabad by the US, Japan and several western countries following the May 1998 tit-for-tat nuclear tests by Islamabad, days after Indian tests the same month.

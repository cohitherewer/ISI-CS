 Kiev, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Ukraine?s SBU security service denied today that it had any role in the poisoning of Opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko, favourite to win Sunday?s rerun of a presidential election.

 Yushchenko, a liberal 50-year-old former prime minister, said earlier this year the authorities tried to kill him by poisoning him with dioxin, which has left his previously youthful face pockmarked and bloated.

 Both Yushchenko and his US-born wife Kateryna say the poisoning may have occurred at a dinner with top SBU officials he attended at the start of September. Austrian doctors have detected 1,000 times the normal level of dioxin in his body.

 ?Due to media reports on the place and time of possible poisoning... the SBU press service considers it is necessary to state that the SBU had nothing to do with the deterioration of Viktor Andriyovych Yushchenko?s health,? it said in a statement on its website (www.sbu.gov.ua).

 The SBU said it had received no official documents providing any evidence of the poisoning or the time or place it happened. It said it would participate in the investigation. Yushchenko had dinner with SBU head Ihor Smeshko and his deputy Volodymyr Satsyuk at dacha outside the capital Kiev on September 5.

 Satsyuk, who was fired by outgoing President Leonid Kuchma earlier this month, previously said he had nothing to do with Yushchenkos illness, local media reported.

 Prosecutors and parliament are conducting two separate investigations into the poisoning. Yushchenko faces Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich in the presidential vote after last months election was cancelled by the Supreme Court due to massive fraud.

 Blair vows shake-up as minister quits

 London, Sept. 7 (Reuters): A British ministers shock resignation will lead to a wider reshuffle this week, Prime Minister Tony Blair said today, sparking rumours of plots and feuds at the heart of government.

 After a quiet summer, British politics is back with a bang. Work and pensions secretary Andrew Smiths decision to quit yesterday has fuelled reports of new tension between Blair and his powerful finance minister, Gordon Brown. Smith is a close Brown ally. His departure will trigger further ministerial changes although the biggest hitters will remain in place.

 The reshuffle will not be today, it will be by the end of the week, Blair said in his Downing Street home. There is not a great deal more I can say about that.

 Speculation is rife that former health minister Alan Milburn a Blair loyalist is set to return, possibly as Labour Party chairman. That would give Milburn a key role in the campaign for next years expected election, traditionally the fiefdom of Brown.

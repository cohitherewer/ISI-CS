 Maoists call nine-day festival ceasefire

 Kathmandu, Oct. 15 (Reuters): 

 Maoist rebels, giving in to popular demands, today announced 

 a nine-day truce for a Hindu festival period beginning next 

 week.

 ?Our party announces the suspension of all armed operations from October 20 to 28 on the occasion of the traditional festival of Dasain,? Maoist leader Prachanda said in a statement.

 But analysts said a short ceasefire was unlikely to lead to peace talks in the nation where more than 10,000 people have died in the rebellion. The guerrillas would use the festival truce to regroup, one expert said.

 ?Although this is a positive move, it does not give any room for optimism for a permanent ceasefire,? said Rajendra Dahal, editor of the widely circulated Himal magazine. ?This is a small break to give rest to guerrillas and prepare for more attacks.? The rebels, who are fighting to topple Nepal?s constitutional monarchy, have called for such ceasefires in the past.

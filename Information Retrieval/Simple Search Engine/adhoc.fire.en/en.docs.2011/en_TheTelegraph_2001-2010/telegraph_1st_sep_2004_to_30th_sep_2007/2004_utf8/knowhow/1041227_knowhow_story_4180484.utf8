 Of dark vision and bright ideas

 EXTREME MEASURES

 Francis Galton is remembered by 

 the general public as the founder of eugenics. To the better-informed 

 he is also a second cousin of Charles Darwin and a grandson 

 of Erasmus Darwin. Unfortunately few of us know about inventions 

 and discoveries of his that have affected our lives profoundly.

 Galton?s bright ideas, as well 

 as his dark visions, makes him a worthy candidate for a 

 biography. Martin Brookes grabs the opportunity to portray 

 an account of Galton?s rampage through science, depicting 

 a troubled, yet exceptional, mind.

 Galton began his forays in science 

 as a medical student at the Birmingham Hospital. But he 

 was an erratic talent who looked for constant challenges.

 Following his more famous cousin?s 

 footsteps he led an expedition to Africa and wrote an excellent 

 travelogue. Later he took to weather forecasting and invented 

 several new methods of metereology. He then innovated a 

 method of fingerprint analysis. But his idea of breeding 

 a super-race turned out to be the biggest hit.

 Brooke has done a splendid job 

 of painting a picture of Galton ? both disturbing and entertaining.

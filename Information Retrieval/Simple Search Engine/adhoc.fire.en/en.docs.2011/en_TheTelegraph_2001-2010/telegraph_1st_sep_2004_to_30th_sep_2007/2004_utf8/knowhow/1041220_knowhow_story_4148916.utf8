Not a mere spoof on the Nobel 

IGNOBEL PRIZES 2

If the newspaper you read isn?t averse to humour, 

you may have been intrigued by an announcement, just before the Nobel prizes are 

declared every year. It?s from the science humour magazine Annals of Improbable 

Research, awarding the IgNobel prize to individuals to celebrate the unusual 

and spur people?s interest in science, medicine and technology.

?The winner has to do something that makes people 

laugh, that makes them think,? says Marc Abrahams who has been organising IgNobel 

ceremony for the past 14 years. 

The book salutes the scientists who have helped labs 

look like funny places. Although in the initial years few scientists coveted an 

IgNobel, now they have begun to enjoy the spoof.

Who can resist laughing at papers with titles like 

?Why chickens prefer beautiful humans?, ?The constipated serviceman: prevalence 

among deployed US troops?, and so on.

You may not laugh out loud at the items but they will 

surely amuse you. And it will also make you think when you?ll know that the US 

state Kansas got science education prize after it banned teaching evolution in 

schools. Good choice!

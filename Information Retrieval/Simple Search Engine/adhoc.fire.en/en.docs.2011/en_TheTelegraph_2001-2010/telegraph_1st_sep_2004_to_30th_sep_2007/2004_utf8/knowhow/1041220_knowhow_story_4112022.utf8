The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

Just aim and shoot

 Want to buy a digital camera this Christmas? David Pogue advises 

 sleek and smart: Sony-Cybershots are tiny and head-turningly fashionable 

As a technology columnist the most frequently asked question I face at parties is: what digital camera should I get? Since 2001, I?ve conducted semiregular surveys of the latest digital cameras which are priced below $300. The lessons of this year?s roundup are clear. First, thin is in. The manufacturers figure that making a camera microscopic makes it more fashionable ? and makes it more likely that you?ll have it with you when one of life?s photo ops pops up. Second, thin can?t win; shrinking a camera?s guts inevitably compromises its photographic prowess. Unless noted otherwise, all of these are 4-megapixel cameras with 3X optical zoom, a proprietary rechargeable battery and a built-in, self-closing lens cap. 

NIKON COOLPIX 5200: As it turns out, there?s no correlation between the size of a camera and the number of megapixels it captures. Nikon?s latest is petite (3.5 by 2.3 by 1.4 inches), but it captures 5.1-megapixel photos. This metal-clad, beautifully sculptured $287 model is great for capturing movies and close-ups, even from two inches away. Few cameras offer as many canned settings for fireworks, beach/snow, sunset, and so on, although that may be to make up for the absence of manual controls. The colour and exposure of the 5200?s photos are excellent, and the camera even includes an autofocus assist lamp: an important feature that prevents a digital camera from flailing pathetically when trying to focus in dim light. 

SONY CYBER-SHOT DSC-L1: If you really want to get small, grab a magnifying glass and check out this new all-metal micro-model (3.7 by 1.7 by 1 inch), soon to be available in a choice of colours. It looks like an energy bar that was fortified with a tad too much iron. Sony packed a surprising number of features into this $270 nanocam, including most manual controls, full-screen movies, an autofocus assist lamp and ? a Sony exclusive ? a minutes-remaining battery display. 

OLYMPUS D-590: This $255 pointer-and-shooter is beautiful and very compact (3.9 by 2.3 by 1.4 inches), although why its on-off switch is on the front, where you can?t see it, is a mystery known only to those on Mount Olympus. In a quest for simplicity and cost savings, the designers also omitted manual controls, an autofocus assist lamp and even an eyepiece viewfinder. Note, too, that this camera requires the world?s most expensive and incompatible memory card format: xD cards (about $85 for 512 megabytes). 

KODAK EASYSHARE DX7440: The fun begins with what may be the best screen on any digital camera. It?s not only bigger than any of its rivals (2.2 inches), but it is also brilliant, even in direct sunlight. Then there?s the only 4X optical zoom lens in this group, an extremely desirable feature that brings you 25 per cent closer to your subject. Other goodies include optional lenses for telephoto or close-up work; full-TV-screen movies, limited in length only by the size of your memory card; continuous autofocus. The relatively bulky DX7440 (4 by 2.7 by 1.6 inches) is the only camera here that lacks PictBridge, a technology that lets the camera plug directly into today?s photo printers. 

CANON POWERSHOT A95: This ugly duckling will never be mistaken for a fashion accessory. It does, however, take deliciously sharp, colour-accurate 5-megapixel photos - tied with the Kodak for the best picture quality in this roundup. Talk about granting a photographer?s wish list: This model?s screen flips out and rotates so that you can shoot a parade over people?s heads or shoot the baby on the floor without throwing out your back. The A95 accepts Compact Flash memory cards, which are available in larger capacities, and for less money, than any other format. The A95 is bigger than most (4.0 by 2.5 by 1.4 inches), and its full-screen movie mode can capture only 30 seconds of choppy 10-frames-per-second video. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: If you want your camera tiny and head-turningly fashionable, choose the Sony. If you?re a straight-ahead snapshooter who has never used a manual control in your life, consider the Nikon or the Olympus. Buyers whose top priority is taking great photographs get Canon A95 or the Kodak EasyShare DX7440. Either one, however, will snuggle easily into your Christmas stocking, your coat pocket and your life. (NYTNS)

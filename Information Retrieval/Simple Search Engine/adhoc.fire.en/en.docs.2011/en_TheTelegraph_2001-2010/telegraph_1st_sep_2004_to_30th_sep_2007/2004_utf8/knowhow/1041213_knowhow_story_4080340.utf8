 Differences between the right and left sides of animal brains is like those in humans. With the MRI test of 66 chimpanzees, scientists at the Berry College and Yerkes National Primate Research Center, US, found that the neurological basis for handedness ? asymmetries in the brain areas that are associated with motor tasks ? is not unique to our species, reports Behavioral Neuroscience. 

Researchers at the University of Japan and Mexico?s 

National Institute of Anthropology and History have unearthed an evidence of human 

sacrifice ? a vault containing ten decapitated bodies, along with the remains 

of pumas, wolves and eagles ? from a pyramid in the 2,000-year-old city of Teotihuacan 

in Mexico. 

 Emory University researchers have created stable multiple chemical bonds between oxygen and platinum ? once thought impossible because oxygen is extremely unstable when combined with certain metals. The study, published in Science Express, claims that this holds the potential for applications in fuel cells and the emerging ?green? chemistry.

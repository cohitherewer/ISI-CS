 A novel antibiotic that is working well in mice may 

be the first new drug to fight tuberculosis in 40 years, an international team 

of researchers said last week. The drug works in a new way to shut down the bacteria 

that cause TB, reports Reuters. The drug is apparently cutting off the energy 

supply to the bacteria. It may be added to the cocktails used for TB to speed 

up the treatment, which takes months, the researchers report in the journal Science. 

Experts hope it can cut down on the treatment time needed, helping patients to 

achieve a real cure and helping to stop the TB bug from mutating into forms that 

resist treatment. More TB drugs are expected now because the disease has staged 

a comeback in the West.

An antimicrobial agent used in shampoos, hand lotions 

and industrial settings inhibits the development of particular nerve-cell stru-ctures, 

essential for transmitting signals between cells, according to a study at the 

University of Pittsburgh. Prolonged exposure to low levels of methyli-sothiazolinone 

(MIT) restricts the growth of neurons of immature rat nerve cells, apparently 

by disengaging the machinery of a key enzyme that is activated in response to 

cell-to-cell contact. This may have potentially damaging consequences to a developing 

nervous system. As a germicidal MIT is used in personal care products, as well 

as in water-cooling systems. 

Researchers at the MIT and Harvard Medical School 

say they are developing an injectable gel that can speed up repair of torn cartilage, 

a common spor-ts injury, and may help injured athletes return to competition sooner. 

The technique uses the patient?s own cartilage-producing cells and has the potential 

to be more effective and less invasive than conventional cartilage repair techniques, 

which include extensive surgery. When the liquid mixture is injected into areas 

where the cartilage is torn, the material hardens into a gel upon exposure to 

ultraviolet light, leaving the transplanted cells in place so they can grow new 

cartilage where it is needed. The biodegradable material is composed of a natural 

polysaccharide called hyaluronic acid.

Men are more likely to want to marry women who are 

their assistants at work than their colleagues or bosses, a University of Michigan 

study finds. The findings provide support for the widespread belief that powerful 

women are at a disadvantage in the marriage market because men may prefer to marry 

less accomplished women, claim researchers.

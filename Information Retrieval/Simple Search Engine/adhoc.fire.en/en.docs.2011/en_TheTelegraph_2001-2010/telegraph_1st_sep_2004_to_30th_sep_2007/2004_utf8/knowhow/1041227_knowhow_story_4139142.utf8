The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

 Postcards from 2005

 Care for a bit of time-travel to the 

 next year ? to get the news from the labs?

 A pill to kill appetite and curb obesity 

 Few treatments for obesity have evoked as much excitement 

 in recent years as rimonabant. French pharma giant Sanofi?s 

 experimental drug, unveiled last year at a medical meet, 

 was found to suppress appetite as well as fight heart ailments. 

 Rimonabant blocks chemical substances called cannabinoid 

 1 that stimulates hunger and cravings in humans, thus reducing 

 voracious appetites of the obese. The commercial launch 

 of the drug in 2005 will bring about a windfall in Sanofi?s 

 fortune because the US market ? more than a third of the 

 US citizens are overweight ? is ripe for a perfect obesity 

 pill with few side-effects. The company expects an annual 

 sale of at least $ 3.6 billion once the drug is launched. 

 Rimonabant is being touted as the most remarkable success 

 in years in drug discovery, because in tests it?s been found 

 to be the most foolproof anti-obesity drug to have appeared 

 so far. Preliminary results from large studies have shown 

 that it cuts flab more drastically than the existing drugs. 

 In four huge clinical trials the drug was found to cut as 

 much as 9 kilogrammes of weight and trim waistlines by 8 

 centimetres in a year. Besides, rimonabant is expected to 

 combat heart diseases, raising good cholesterol (by 23 per 

 cent on average) and lowering harmful fats called triglyceride 

 (15 per cent). The drug has other ingredients that may help 

 smokers kick the habit. 

 GenNext car 

 GenNext cars will roll out of Toyota factories. Two-seater 

 Triath-lons will be zero-emission vehicles. They will have 

 wheels running on electric motors. With a new combustion 

 technology, electrical voltage will transform the gaseous 

 fuel steam into plasma prior to combustion, making it a 

 zero-emission affair. It has already produced excellent 

 results with propane in the test drives. Compact, long-lasting 

 and portable energy sources will power these eco-friendly 

 ?flying? machines. They will use lithium-ion batteries, 

 which can provide three times as much energy and power as 

 the conventional lead batteries. The cars will have smarter 

 interior features and embedded hard drives that will store 

 maps and phone directories, digital audio network and a 

 customisable Wi-Fi interfaced dashboard. All these will 

 let the owners download MP3s or navigation maps to the on-board 

 systems. Price? Not yet announced. 

 Accurate cancer test 

 Spotting cancer long before symptoms of the disease 

 begin to appear has been a huge challenge for medical researchers. 

 But that miracle blood test to detect cancer at the earliest 

 stage has remained elusive. Most available screening methods 

 either miss too many cancers or pick up plenty of ?positives? 

 that turn out to be harmless tumours. The year 2005 is going 

 to witness a dramatic change in cancer diagnosis. Three 

 US-based companies ? Advanced Biochem, Ciphergen and Correlogics 

 ? are all set to launch tests capable of pinning down tell-tale 

 proteins from a single drop of blood. The sinister protein 

 patterns reveal vital clues to ovarian, prostate and breast 

 cancer quickly enough, so that oncologists can lodge a timely 

 assault. Protein profiling tests invented by these companies 

 showed more than 90 per cent accuracy in trials. 

 Trip to Saturn?s moon 

Huygens spacecraft will parachute into the mysterious atmosphere of Titan, Saturn?s largest moon, becoming the first man-made object to arrive on a world whose chemistry is believed to be somewhat similar to what it was on the earth before life began here. The spacecraft carries a CD-ROM engraved with pop songs composed by two French singers and other messages. Its two-hour descent will begin on January 15, and it will start transmitting data straightaway. Titan has fascinated scientists because its environment is believed to contain organic compounds found on the earth before life started its course here 3.8 billion years ago. The Huygens probe piggybacked on Cassini, the mothership which slipped into orbit around Saturn last July. 

 Centenary of a miracle 

?Zur Electrodynamik bewegter Korper?. Not many people may have heard of that title in a research journal in German. Yet it was this 30-page article ? ?On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies? in English translation ? published in the Annalen der Physik in 1905 that ushered in a new era in science. The man behind this revolution was Albert Einstein, a 26-year-old clerk working at the patent office in Bern, Switzerland, who was yet to earn his PhD. The bottom line of the paper: Time is just like one of the three other dimensions (left-right, front-back and up-down) of space. A sequel to that landmark paper yielded that all-time-great equation E=mC2. These two papers comprised what is now known as the Special Theory of Relativity. In the same year Einstein publish-ed three other equally startling articles in the same journal. To mark the centenary of that ?miracle year? ? no other scientist, before or since, has been so prolific in so small a time-span ? the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics has already declared 2005 as the ?World Year Physics?. Get ready for the gala celebrations. It?s time to take stock of our progress in understanding the Universe since Einstein. 

 Big leap in chip-making 

 Chip giants AMD and Intel will launch dual-core processors, 

 in which two chips are placed on a single central processing 

 unit. This will allow users to double their processing power 

 with minimum extra costs. This new technology will be used 

 in animation, video, computer-aided design, databases, and 

 server-based systems that are getting hungrier for faster 

 processing. A computer-aided design system harnessing dual-core 

 processors to design anything ? from a new car to a new 

 drug ? will reduce the time from design to market. Intel 

 is also ready to launch smarter, energy-efficient, mega-store, 

 molecular chip. The size of a transistor gets reduced by 

 30 per cent. Some university labs will also go for the lighter, 

 energy-efficient, molecular chip that will lead to the introduction 

 of quantum computing next year. 

 Mother of all histories 

 History is always a contentious subject ? the older 

 it is, the bigger gets the debate. So you can imagine the 

 confusion that can pervade our knowledge of the proceedings 

 after the Big Bang, the cataclysmic birth of the Universe 

 billions of years ago. Our best bet in this regard is to 

 analyse the afterglow of that burst of energy. In the Atacama 

 Desert of northern Chile, a telescope known as the Cosmic 

 Background Imager (CBI) has been doing just that. The year 

 2005 will witness a lot of news flashes from the CBI team, 

 giving the details of scenario prevailing in the infant 

 Universe. A knockout season for some pet theories. 

 Smart diagnosis 

 What makes some chain-smokers end up with cancer, 

 while others don?t? Why do blood pressure drugs work for 

 some patients, and fail in others? What genetic variations 

 make people susceptible to asthma? The answers to such questions 

 may emerge from an analysis of the so-called ?human haplotype 

 maps?, the first of which will be unveiled in 2005. A haplotype 

 map catalogues genetic similarities and differences in humans 

 to understand how such variations influence health, disease 

 and the response to drugs. The first version of the haplotype 

 map will contain 600,000 genetic variations. 

 Bendable laptop 

 In 2005, you may have to unroll your laptop to power 

 it up. Big and flexible organic light-emitting-diodes (FOLEDs) 

 and other foldable displays are ultimately getting out of 

 the lab. University of Toronto engineers have made FOLEDs 

 that will lead to the bendable television, computer and 

 cellphone screens. FOLEDs are made of light-weight, flexible 

 materials ranging from transparent plastic films to reflective 

 metal foils, whereas today?s flat-panel displays are made 

 of heavy and inflexible glass. The technology uses a low-cost, 

 high-efficiency mass-production method. 

 Nano magic 

 The next year will witness better, faster and tinier 

 electronic gadgets, perhaps 1,000 times smaller, thanks 

 to nanotechnology ? the fastest-growing area in solid-state 

 physics that aims to eventually build gadgets atom by atom. 

 Researchers at the Harvard University have produced nano-cables 

 that are 100 times thinner than a human hair. The researchers 

 can fabricate the wires with a uniform diameter and smooth 

 surfaces down to the atomic level. This makes them capable 

 of carrying light with a precision that ordinary cables 

 cannot hope to match. Transistors made from such carbon 

 nanotubes can operate at extremely fast microwave frequencies. 

 The new material will have applications in ever-shrinking 

 medical products, tiny photonics equipment such as laser 

 systems, and telecommunication storage tools of greater 

 precision.

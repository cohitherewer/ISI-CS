The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

BRAIN STORMING

DEBKUMAR MITRA

It seems the Finns are the best students 

of mathematics. So where are we? The news report that I read did not mention anything 

about the participating countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation 

and Development (OECD) survey. Now, after a search on the Net, I know 15-year-olds 

from 41 countries took part in the survey. And OECD is doing the survey once in 

three years for the ?industrialised nations.? So, that explains India?s absence 

from the list. It?s time our school system becomes a part of such a survey. It?s 

not enough to participate in a Mathematics Olympiad, where individual performance 

scores over overall impact of the school system on that individual. It is difficult 

to predict where India will be placed on the OECD survey ladder, but one thing 

is for sure ? it cannot be better than the Finns.

PUZZLE 1: A tournament 

is to be held between two teams. The first team to win four games wins the tournament. 

There are no drawn games. There will thus be a minimum of four, and a maximum 

of seven games. You support one of the teams, and want to end up having won $1,000 

if your team wins the tournament, and having lost $1,000 if your team loses. You 

may bet an amount on each game, and you win that amount of money if the team you 

bet on wins, and lose it if the team loses. How much money should you wager on 

the first game?

PUZZLE 2: ?We?re 

all keen on yachting in these parts,? said my tow-headed friend, Thalia Collingwood. 

?Father has a yacht, and so has each of his four friends: Colonel Drake; Mr Nelson; 

Sir Barnacle Hood; and Dr Benbow. ?What?s more, each of the five has just one 

daughter, and each has named his yacht after the daughter of one of the others. 

?So you see,? she concluded proudly, ?there?s a dear little yacht named after 

me.? Sir Barnacle?s yacht is the Gabrielle; Mr Collingwood owns the Lorna; 

Mr Nelson, the Rosalind. The Melissa, owned by Colonel Drake, is 

named after Sir Barnacle?s daughter. Gabrielle?s father owns the yacht which is 

named after Dr Benbow?s daughter. Who is Lorna?s father?

 PUZZLE CRACKED

Solution 1: The smallest positive integer in 

this case is 1,02,564. When its last digit is moved to the start of the number, 

the resulting number is larger than, and is an integral multiple of, the original 

number.

 Solution 2: There were initially 190 balls in the urn; 10 each of 19 different colours.

 Hint: Let the number of colours be ?? and there are ?x? number of balls of each colour. Probability of picking up two balls of the same colour=(x-1)/(nx-1). After 20 balls are added, probability changes to (xP2n+20P2)/(nx+20P2). Equating the probabilities, and simplifying them, we obtain nx(21-2x)=19.

 Solution 3: The probability that no two red marbles are adjacent is 7/33. Assume all the marbles of a similar colour are identical.

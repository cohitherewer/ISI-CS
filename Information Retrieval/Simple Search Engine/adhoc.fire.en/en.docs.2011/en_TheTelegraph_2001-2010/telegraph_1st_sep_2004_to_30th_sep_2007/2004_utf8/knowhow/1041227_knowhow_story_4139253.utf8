 4

 benefits of the miracle 

 drink

 1 Water is not a 

 cure-all, it is the primary ingredient to every healing 

 process within our body. Drinking more water helps to 

 keep blood pumped with oxygen. If there isnt enough 

 oxygen, the muscles produce lactic aid, causing cramps. 

 Water plays a role in curing indigestion back 

 pain, arthritis and morning sickness by regulating fluid 

 levels. 

 2 Lymph, the bodys waste-disposal system, 

 needs water to work properly. Water can rehydrate 

 the dried-up wastes in the large bowel to combat constipation. 

 Water helps get rid of extra sodium and prevents urinary 

 tract infections. It also prevents bad breath by washing 

 away foul-smelling germs.

 3 Insufficient amounts of water cause lack 

 of concentration, and slow thinking. Water helps us 

 beat stress, fatigue and headache. It flushes out 

 toxins and rehydrates the brain.

 4 The skin needs water to glow with elasticity. 

 Sun-ken eyes under the eye circles means you need 

 more water.

 People with low blood pressure and a weak nervous system often faint while standing for long hours. The latest study at the Imperial College London and St Mary?s Hospital prescribes a quick and easy solution for them: Have two glasses of water. 

The autonomic nervous system is responsible for the control of bodily functions not consciously directed, such as blood pressure, heart rate and sweating. Autonomic failure causes a trip in blood pressure level first. The research ? published in the latest issue of the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry ? says ordinary tap or bottled drinking water can work as a wonder drug on this problem. 

Prof. Christopher Mathias, from Imperial College London and St Mary?s Hospital, and the senior author of the research, says, ?This discovery could help us treat many other people who suffer from low blood pressure generally, especially those who faint.? 

The researchers looked at 14 patients with autonomic failure, and measured their blood pressure, before, and 15 and 35 minutes after drinking 480 ml of distilled water. For the patients with pure autonomic failure, it took five minutes for a significant rise in blood pressure while standing. 

Mathias adds, ?Autonomic failure poses a greater risk of fainting after food or even after mild exertion. This study will help understand why this happens. It may also benefit the many who, without autonomic failure, faint as a result of low blood pressure.?

Favourite lie

Who says evolution can?t explain why we have eyes? asks 

Steve Jones

A noble lord of my acquaintance has just sent me his 

copy of an invitation to a breakfast lecture at which my work is to be discussed. 

That is gratifying indeed, but a closer look suggests that the meal will be peerless, 

and I will stay in bed, for it is hosted by those drab proponents of stupidity, 

the creationists. Their cult is thriving, with a hundred million believers in 

the US alone and a determined attempt to buy their way into British schools. 

I really don?t mind if they burn my books, as long as they buy them first, but it is a bit of a blow to see my writings quoted as evidence against evolution, when they are exactly the opposite. 

When the facts don?t fit, tell lies; and when you lose a battle, claim victory. Those tactics are much resorted to by the anti-science brigade as they crow over the supposed defeat of the Darwinians. Their problem is arrogance: they cannot bear the idea that they share ancestors with simpler creatures. A favourite falsehood has it that Darwin?s ideas cannot explain the origin of complex structures such as the eye. 

That came up at the Scopes Monkey Trial, when evolution was mocked: ?A piece of pigment or, some say, a freckle appeared upon the skin of an animal that had no eyes. That piece of pigment or freckle converged the rays of the sun upon that spot and when the little animal felt the heat on that spot it turned the spot to the sun to get more heat. The increased heat irritated the skin ? so the evolutionists guess, and a nerve grew there and out of the nerve came the eye. Can you beat it? And it happened not once, but twice!? 

Darwin himself wrote that ?the eye gives me a cold shudder,? but, rather than just palpitating in the face of nature?s complexity, he went on to give a cogent explanation of how it evolved. He compared the eyes of modern creatures and inferred what the ancestor must have looked like. There are many kinds of eye ? cameras like those of men and squids, multiple lenses in insects or trilobites, and light-sensitive patches on a worm?s skin. 

Biologists often argue that the pattern shows that ? like the wings of a bat and a bird ? similar structures have evolved again and again in different lineages, each starting in a different place, but reaching a somewhat similar end. 

Now, its story is becoming less complicated and more convincing. A couple of years ago, evidence from the eye?s cells and light-sensitive pigments revealed just one deep split, between the vertebrates with their complicated rods and cones, and the simpler mechanism found in invertebrates such as flies. Perhaps the ability to see originated only twice, rather than many times; with just the details of the machinery changing in different creatures. 

This month, the new comparative anatomy (otherwise known as molecular biology) pushed the evidence even further back. It reveals just one origin for all eyes in that vast diversity of creatures, from flies to men, that have a head, a tail, a left, and a right. 

 Original idea: Charles Darwin compared the eyes 

of modern creatures

Drs Detlev Arendt and Jochen Wittbrodt of the European 

Molecular Biology Laboratory have found a protein very similar to the human light-sensitive 

pigment in a ragworm, a simple and unenterprising animal that has sat unchanged 

on the sea bottom for half a billion years. The worm also has cells that look 

rather like our own rods and cones.

However, neither the pigment nor the special cells are in its eye. Instead, they are hidden deep within the ragworm?s modest brain. In a startling parallel, the genes that make our own optic nerve (which cannot respond to light, but is in effect part of the brain) look rather like those in the worm?s eye. All this hints that the ancient ancestor of worms, flies, humans and almost everything else had two light-sensitive systems. One was used to see, while the other probably acted as a clock to sense the rhythms of night and day. 

Over the years, one part of the mechanism retreated into the brain (and humans still have light-sensitive brain cells that set the body clock), while the other kept its eye on the world outside. However, the vertebrates and the invertebrates went in opposite directions in deciding which system to use for what job, which is why human eye genes are in worm brains, and vice versa. 

Other deep similarities between vastly different creatures are also turning up. Fly bristles (which pick up signals such as sound) look rather like the ear cells, which do the same thing; and many hormones, nerves and body structures are, the DNA shows, shared by worms, flies and ourselves. 

We will never see a fossil of this ancestral beast, for it lived before the Cambrian, in a time from which almost nothing remains. Even so, we can use the genes of its many descendants to reconstruct what it must have looked like, and what has happened in its family tree. 

The lord of the flies, the worms, and the human race was a fairly complex creature, with a heart, brain, legs and more. There have been plenty of changes since then, and many genes have disappeared, or have doubled up, or have been modified by the force of natural selection. The big surprise is to find that humans have altered much less, compared with the universal ancestor, than have flies or worms on their own branch of the tree. Those humble creatures evolved at great speed, often by abandoning unwanted genes. 

They have lost around one part in six of the ancient ancestor?s DNA, while we have thrown out only one bit in 20 ? and the structure of the sections that remain has been much less modified in ourselves than in flies. Evolution proves that Homo sapiens is a natural conservative; we have stayed faithful to a basic structure that began 600 million years ago. 

Quite how the creationists will deal with the discovery that we are closer to the ancient roots of life than are the flying and crawling beasts that one day will consume our mortal remains is hard to say. At least it will give them something else to complain about over their bacon and eggs.

facts about the diet thats good for

1 More than 16 countries border the Mediterranean Sea. 

Although diets vary between these countries, the common pattern has lots of fruits, 

vegetables, cereals, beans, nuts, seeds, fish, olive oil and a moderate amount 

of wine. Little red meat or dairy products are eaten. Eggs are consumed zero to 

four times a week. 

 2 More than half of the fat calories in a Mediterranean diet come from 

monounsaturated fats (mainly from olive oil). Such fat doesnt raise blood 

cholesterol levels the way saturated fat (present in meat, eggs and dairy products) 

does. It also brings down blood glucose levels and blood pressure.

 3 The incidence of heart disease in Mediterranean countries is lower 

than in most developed countries. Death rates are lower, too. But this may not 

be entirely due to the diet. Lifestyle factors (such as more physical activity, 

non-smoking and extended social support systems) may also play a part.

A Mediterranean-style diet rich in plant foods and beneficial fats, coupled with a healthy lifestyle, can significantly increase life expectancy of the elderly, according to a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA). 

?This supports the hypothesis that a Mediterranean diet and lifestyle can reduce mortality from cardiovascular diseases and cancer, even at ages 70 to 90,? wrote lead researcher Kin Knoops, a professor of human nutrition at the Wageningen University, the Netherlands. 

The researchers observed the effect of a Mediterranean diet on 2,239 people aged between 70 and 90 for a period of 10 years. They measured the diet?s effects on death rate relating to cancer, coronary artery disease and other chronic heart disorders. They also looked at the three other factors: non-smoking, regular exercise, and moderate alcohol consumption prevalent in the lifestyle of the Mediterranean people. Few studies have investigated the effects of these factors on mortality. 

In another study, published in the same issue of JAMA, a group of Italian researchers reported that a Mediterranean diet helps those with a metabolic problem called ?Syndrome X? which is an early sign of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. 

?The advantage of the diet is that it is not as restrictive as some other prescription diets,? wrote Eric B. Rimm, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health in an editorial. ?I think it?s very easy to fit the diet into our lifestyle and you can follow it for years.?

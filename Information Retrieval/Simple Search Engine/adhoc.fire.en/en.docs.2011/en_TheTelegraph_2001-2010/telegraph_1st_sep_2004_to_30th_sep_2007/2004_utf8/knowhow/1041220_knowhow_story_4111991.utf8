The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

Right on target

 Scientists must be able to explain their work to grandmas, Claudia Dreifus reports 

 Non-conformist: Blobel is not scared of proposing new ideas 

Life, and how it functions, is at the centre of Dr Guenter Blobel?s research. Specifically, he studies proteins and the mechanisms that permit them to move within the cells of living organisms. For his efforts, he was chosen as the sole recipient of the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1999. A cellular biologist, Blobel enjoys lively companionship in the confines of his laboratory office at Rockefeller University in New York; each day he arrives at work accompanied by his three English setters. Throughout the interview, the dogs rooted about Blobel?s office. But it seems that was all part of their training. 

Your good friend Richard Axel will be leaving for Stockholm shortly to accept his half of the 2004 Nobel Prize in medicine. He?ll be sharing the award with the biologist Linda Buck. As a laureate yourself, have you offered him any advice? 

I advised him to go early so that he could enjoy it all better and really get into the mood. If you go early, you don?t have so much jet lag, and you can enjoy the musical performances, the beautiful steel-blue sky of Stockholm. But Richard doesn?t have the time. He will only go for three or four days. I told him it is a mistake. 

A lot of scientists say that their work gets ruined after the Nobel, that there?s no time left for science. Was that true of you? 

After I got the prize, someone said to me, Noblesse oblige. He meant that the prize is an obligation, and it gives you a platform. I used it to talk about the need for scientists to communicate their work to the public, a passion of mine. I?m always telling my students that if they can?t explain what they are doing to their grandmothers then they probably don?t understand it themselves. 

OK then, can you explain, in terms that my late grandmother would understand, what you won your Nobel for? 

It was for the basic science where we learned how, within a cell, proteins move from where they are made to the place where they perform their function. A cell contains about a billion protein molecules, which live on the average for about a week. Therefore, the cell has to continuously make more proteins to replace the degraded ones, and they have to go to the right place within that cell to function properly. To greatly simplify, we found that proteins contain built-in ?ZIP codes? that help them move to specific cellular addresses. Because of the ZIP coding, the proteins can traverse membranes by moving through channels to get to the areas where they are needed. 

Was there a moment when you felt you understood this process? 

I think by the beginning of the 1980s, I had the feeling that there was this mechanism in the cells, the ZIP code. Even then, not all of the details of that mechanism were known. We had hypothesised about it. That?s why some people at the time criticised me, because I had made a lot of hypotheses. Later, they were probably angry because we obtained data that confirmed the hypotheses. There was a 50-50 chance I was right. But the idea about the ZIP codes was also intuition. I kept asking myself, ?If I were to design a system, how would I do it?? The thing that people criticised me for most was the idea that proteins can go through a channel in the membrane that consists of proteins itself. 

Was there a specific moment when you finally felt you had the complete answer? 

There was no one moment. With every couple of years in the lab came another little peak of information, and each one added to the basic idea that there is a ZIP code that is being recognised and then targeted to a membrane, and then the ZIP code opens a channel through which the protein can traverse the membrane. By 1991, I felt, we had compiled enough evidence to prove our hypothesis. 

While your colleagues were doubting you, what gave you the confidence to keep plugging on? 

I?ve never cared about being judged. There is an internal revolt in me against conforming. After the war, my family lived in East Germany and that taught me that truth is the most holy and important thing in life. I thought my ideas were reasonable. So why not propose them. (NYTNS)

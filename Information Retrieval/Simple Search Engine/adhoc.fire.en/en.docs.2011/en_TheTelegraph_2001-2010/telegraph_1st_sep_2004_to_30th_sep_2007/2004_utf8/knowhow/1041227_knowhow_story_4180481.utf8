Spoon-fed childhood

 Life?s easy: We?ve 

 mobile phones made for kids 

 Even the young cyclist these days 

 is beginning to wear lustrous helmets, pedalling at a gallant 

 speed of approximately two and a half miles an hour. Of 

 course, that would be alright, if it were not for two related 

 facts: an anxious parent plodding behind at approximately 

 the same speed, and that the kid appears to be on a tricycle.

Welcome to the wonderful world of modern childhood, completely redesigned to suit your fragile child?s needs ? an ultra-safe, extra-secure, rubber-cushioned environment with the sole task of creating wimps.

The problem is more pronounced in developed countries, and child psychologists remain alarmed by their deleterious effects. For instance, social engagements and nurture from extended family are low in those places, and it?s no surprise that children?s intellectual skills follow suit. The power of decision-making, memory, and speed of mental processing are lost, and so is the ability to plan things, a critical part of the self-regulation system housed in our prefrontal cortex. Depression in modern medical terminology is seen as a disorder caused by unregulated thought patterns, which can be triggered early through parental hyper-concern.

In many parts of the world, children aren?t allowed to feel badly anymore, experience misery or hardships, virtues that are important to allow the brain to cope with such feelings. Making a mess, even at play, is loathed as a perceived consequence of unpleasant upbringing. Learning through error is emphatically linked to failure. Life is premeditated and cut out for these kids, and the ones who veer far are dealt with ruthlessly. Economic forces are clearly at work, but whether that truly translates to a rosier future for the better groomed is questionable.

The vicissitudes of life ? moments for critical assessment of emotional reactions ? are vanishing in such an artificial safety net. Even a child?s accomplishments are spoon-fed by parents disordered from an elusive paradigm of their own lives. An identity crisis of the young ? the feeling of unquestioning preprogrammed robots ? is the sad outcome. Face it: the new generation is risk-averse, success-driven, and zombie-like. It?s one that has been hijacked, and doesn?t ? or shouldn?t ? belong to them.

If an infant has gas, burping the baby is the sign of good parenthood. But when a 10-year-old has metaphoric gas, burping can be disastrous, says prominent child psychologist David Anderegg. It?s a feeling echoed by most in the profession. Exposure to the real world brings in difficult, often insurmountable, problems, contaminating the sanitised among us.

A recent UNICEF report puts the number of children growing up hungry, whose schools had become targets for warring villages killed off by AIDS, at over one billion. 

Who could say that the collective energies of the over-anxious wimp-creators might not find better use in the life of those wretched souls?

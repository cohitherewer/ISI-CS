 Science is fun

 With reference to Science beyond textbooks (December 6), it was nice to know that someone has come forward to make the study of science interesting. It?s a pity that most science textbooks force students to memorise and stuff their mind with bits and pieces of half-baked information. Science teaching in our country kills the natural curiosity and the spirit of enquiry in children. Even if textbooks mention simple home-based experiments as a footnote, few science teachers encourage their students to perform them on their own. Which is why India is churning out hordes of techno-coolies and not good basic scientists. I hope more people like Mr Samar Bagchi take the initiative to make science learning a real fun. Only then will India shine.

 Wrong signal

 It defies common logic and theory that too little sleep can make one fat (Tab on flab, November 29). If such findings are made public, I?m afraid lazy people will grab the opportunity to sleep more. But I?m sure this is not the only factor responsible for being overweight. There should be more research on the issue before scientists conclude something so dramatic.

 Different strokes 

 You have discussed two ?beautiful minds? holding different stands as far as their role as a pedagogue is concerned. (Strings attached and Right on target, December 20). Richard Feynman, one of the greatest theorists in the history of physics, found himself too engrossed in his research work to be available to offer crumbs of his knowledge to lesser mortals. On the other hand, Gunter Blobel, a chemist par excellence, is passionate about communicating his findings to all and sundry.

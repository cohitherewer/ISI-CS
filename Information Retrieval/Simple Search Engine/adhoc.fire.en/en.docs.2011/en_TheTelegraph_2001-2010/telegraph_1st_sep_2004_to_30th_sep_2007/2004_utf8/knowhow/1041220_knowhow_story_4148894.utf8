Third Law

 India is a strange country where bullock carts and ballistic missiles co-exist merrily, and charlatans use science to promote occultism. Computers are used to print horoscopes and scientists consult homoeopaths. So, the views expressed in Forget vaccines (Third Law, December 6) is not a big surprise. ?To grow a robust immunity? through a ?healthy lifestyle? sounds fine. But as long as that does not happen we cannot simply allow our children to succumb to vaccine-preventable diseases. Such retrograde mindset has stalled eradication of polio in India. I wonder where the letter-writer gathered information about the harmful effects of vaccines. There is no documented data anywhere in the world that proves the negative attributes of vaccines included in universal immunisation programmes. It is wise to ignore such scaremongers.

Abasic logic defies the possibility of hunting extra-terrestrial 

organisms based only on their occurrence in similar hostile environmental conditions 

under the seabed (Hidden Life, December 6). The organisms, which are now 

adapted to extreme surroundings like the deep seabed or ice shelf had originated 

in a more benign condition of environment. Gradually, they occupied and got themselves 

adapted to the extremes. But in the case of finding extra-terrestrial life, the 

bottleneck comes from the lack of favourable environment for the initiation of 

the primitive life form.

 Fatal combination

 With reference to Unconventional risks (December 6) people with periodontitis are also twice likely to suffer from heart disease. Believe it or not, our mouth has plenty of harmful bacteria that contribute to fatal heart diseases. No wonder Indians have a high incidence of both gum disease and coronary artery disease.

Cockroaches, too, have buddies

 Roboroach: For the study of mob intellect 

It might seem counterintuitive ? or, let?s face it, silly ? for scientists to create an artificial cockroach. Nature has, after all, given us so many of them, and considerable energies of humankind have been focused on exterminating them. 

But an international team of scientists has done just that. 

The purpose of the matchbox-size robo-roach is to study ?collective intelligence,? said Dr Jos? Halloy, senior research scientist at the Free University of Brussels, one of the institutions collaborating on the project. Roaches, ants, bees and many other creatures are gregarious and share a kind of mob intellect, he said. 

The researchers have found a chemical blend that smells roachish enough for the impostors to trick real roaches into believing they are part of the group, and even to modify group behaviour by getting the roaches to follow them from dark to light places. 

As tempting as it might be to imagine a pied piper leading roaches into glue traps, Halloy said their goal was not roach control. ?Everybody is enthusiastic that we are going to build a programme to get rid of the cockroaches,? he said. ?That is not the present stage or the aim at the moment.? When it comes to killing roaches, ?classical methods are better.? 

Ultimately, he said, the technologies could be used to make smarter computers and robots. ?We want machines to perform independently without human intervention,? Halloy said. 

The researchers are studying collective behaviour among many species. Working closely with Jean-Louis Deneubourg of the Center for Nonlinear Phenomena and Complex Systems at the university, the researchers say they hope to influence ?collective choice? and eventually ?control animal behaviour through the use of artificial systems? like herding sheep without the menace of a sheepdog or persuading flocks of grackles to leave parks. 

The researchers said they were also making progress with chickens, which exhibit a destructive ?panic behaviour? that might be calmed with poultrybots. 

?That?s the dream,? said Deneubourg. ?But, of course, we are far away from that. What we are trying to do is prove the concept.? 

?The idea of using microrobots to influence the collective behaviour of animals, and cockroaches in particular, is an old idea of Jean Louis?s, and we had some really hilarious brainstorming sessions a few years ago talking about it,? said another scientist in the field, Dr Eric Bonabeau. 

Bonabeau is the chairman of Icosystem, a company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Paris, that is exploring swarm technology ?for military purposes?. 

That could make the roaches sound almost cuddly.

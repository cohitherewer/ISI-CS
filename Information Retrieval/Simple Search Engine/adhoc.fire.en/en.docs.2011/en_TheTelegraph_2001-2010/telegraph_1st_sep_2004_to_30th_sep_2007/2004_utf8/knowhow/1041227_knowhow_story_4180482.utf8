The Telegraph - Calcutta : Knowhow

Why does drinking make us hungry?

WHY CORNER

 KnowHOW team explains: Drinking makes 

 us hungry because alcohol in the bloodstream causes production 

 of the hormone insulin. Insulin causes hypoglycaemia, a 

 reduction of sugar in the blood, which in turn stimulates 

 the sensation of hunger.

 Drinking large quantities of alcohol also disturbs the chemical balance of the body, which has to be restored. Our bodily fluids are made up of about 50 per cent water with about 0.9 per cent of mineral salts dissolved in it. Ideally, this level must be kept constant to keep all our body functions running smoothly.

 If we have more than one pint of beer (or about two pegs of spirits) we add a large amount of water but no trace of salt. What our body really needs is an extra dash of salt and that is why we crave peanuts, chips, kebabs or fried fish.

 Alcohol is a great disinhibitor, and one of its effects can be to disinhibit the conscious restraint that holds us back from over-eating. The presence of food in the stomach also retards the absorption of alcohol, especially if it is greasy food.

 Thus, eating more may be a subconscious effort of the body to prevent intoxication. This explains the craving for rich and oily foods which are generally considered unhealthy in the sober state.

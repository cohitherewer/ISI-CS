CHECKLIST

Children who watch sporting events on television also 

see a lot of violence thanks to the accompanying commercials. Researchers, who 

examined ads run during live telecast of sporting events, found that there were 

images that could have bad influences on younger viewers, at least one in 20 cases, 

reports Pediatrics. The researchers set out to investigate whether images 

of sporting events are safe for the young. The review of 1,185 commercials broadcast 

during the football, baseball, basketball and other sports in the US revealed 

that 14 per cent of them depicted unsafe behaviour while 6 per cent showed violence. 

The unsafe behaviour included riding a bicycle without a helmet, riding in a car 

without a seat and crossing a street without looking around.

A study that followed the health of asthmatic children 

found that stressful events significantly increased their chances of having asthma 

attacks. Researchers from the University College London report in Thorax 

that they investigated the families of 60 children, ages 6 to 13, to keep close 

records of their asthma attacks and to conduct daily tests of their breathing 

capacity. The families were also asked to record any events that might produce 

stress, including moving, changes in the household makeup and illness. The researchers 

tried to see whether there was a correlation. The results were unequivocal: the 

children were found to be four times as likely to suffer attacks within two days 

of stressful events.

 A recent study published in the journal Pain Practice 

identified situations in which injections of local anaesthetic will be the best 

treatment for pain and reduce unnecessary risk and procedural costs. Twenty patients, 

who exhibited allodynia, or pain with light touch, were given an initial ?diagnostic? 

injection after which results were analysed to determine if further treatments 

would be advantageous. The treatment consisted of injections into the sympathetic 

nerves that run along the front side of the spinal column. The procedure supports 

?rational use of sympathetic block quot; and suggests that this is especially 

useful when allodynia is present.

Rich countries can learn a lesson about caring for 

underweight babies from poorer countries, suggest doctors from Colombia who advise 

mothers to caress low-birthweight babies instead of putting them in incubators. 

The so-called ?kangaroo care? is more effective than mechanical warming, say the 

doctors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

Diary of misguidance

 Is it journalism?: A reader checks a weblog 

Blogging is steadily getting into the mainstream of 

Internet communication. Web logs or blogs ? regularly updated web journals ? allow 

people, the bloggers, to maintain a diary on anything under the sun. It encompasses 

a wide area ? from war to ethics, from technology to books, and even from drug-chasing 

to political gossip. And, it seems to have gained a serious and formal recognition 

early this month. Microsoft?s latest offshoot MSN Spaces joins the blogging bandwagon 

by letting people set up a web collection of quick, off-the-cuff reactions.

Blogs have what general web magazines don?t have: a personal touch. Censorship is non-existent in the world of bloggers. A blog publishes free-flowing, interesting but unconvincing articles, conversations, or mails. But blogs have no ethical or journalistic backbone. They disseminate information just for the sake of keeping one informed. This is by nature incompatible with newspapers, but more akin to live radio or television where there is a little scope for editing. But with the slightest distraction, the presenter can get fired. Blogging media has to follow this path. In this guardian-less world wide web, it should start reviewing ?off-the-track?, abysmally less-judged and blatantly offensive blogs, with safeguards. Regardless of all sorts of disclaimers, one cannot avoid the legal liability. Printed words, in any medium, give a primary notion of an absolute truth. Weblogs are no exceptions. A layman may get a skewed information out of them. Recently a CNN war correspondent was asked to shut down his popular site in response to a similar case. 

Should journalists blog? Is it a legitimate form of journalism? The online news arena has no concrete answer. Some say, it subtly distorts journalism with misguidance, plagiarism and unfounded news-sourcing. It is like someone unconsciously pleasing a handful of people. But a few big media bloggers notably MSNBC, Fox News etc. believe, blogs are a new and exciting form of journalism ? a kind of ?opinion? or ?democratic? voice in its purest form. These media giants are actively bringing new blogs by reporters and columnists onto their websites. Others, including CNN, Time and The New York Times, however, have not yet embraced blogging as an useful form of journalism. 

However, blogging is here to stay, and blogosphere may soon be a paid service. Not only does it bring business but helps express one?s viewpoint ? uncensored. If properly sourced it can turn itself into a robust journalistic tradition ?unfettered, with an individualistic voice and unfiltered grit, adding a dare-devil punch to stories. 

It?s a good sign that a company like Microsoft is joining up. This will surely provide a structured approach and offer a proper shape to blogging. Blogging has miles to go to step into journalism. Before that happens one has to adopt some kind of ethics to achieve the minimum credibility. The assumption that ?Anything goes in weblog? must be busted.

Useless but tricky organ

 Delay in diagnosing appendicitis can prove costly, says Jane E. Brody 

The appendix, a vestigial organ that people seem able 

to live very well without, is also one of the most distressing and costly parts 

of the human body. With little or no warning, the appendix can become obstructed 

and infected, making appendicitis the most common cause for emergency surgery 

in Western countries. Even though the incidence of appendicitis has declined significantly 

since the 1930s, about 250,000 cases still occur each year in the US. Appendicitis 

can afflict people of all ages, from infants to the elderly. In Western countries, 

9 per cent of men and 7 per cent of women develop appendicitis. 

Even with the widespread use of modern diagnostic tools like CT scans and ultrasound, appendicitis remains a diagnostic challenge in many cases, especially in infants and children, pregnant women and the elderly. Experts who have studied appendicitis in recent years report that misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis are still all too common. Misdiagnosis leads to the unnecessary surgical removal of a healthy appendix. Missed diagnosis can lead to serious, even life-threatening complications when an infected appendix is not removed soon after the symptoms develop. 

Since the risk of appendicitis is so common and delays in diagnosis can result in costly or even deadly outcomes, surgeons sometimes remove a healthy appendix in the course of abdominal surgery for other reasons. 

The appendix is at the tip of the caecum, a large blind pouch at the beginning of the large intestine. It contains a lot of well-organised lymphoid tissue and most likely evolved as an important part of the immune system. Its current function is unknown, and its surgical removal has not been linked to an increased risk of any illness, including colon cancer. 

In most people, the appendix lies in the lower right side of the abdomen, and acute pain in that region prompts many people to fear that they have appendicitis and to seek prompt medical care. The pain of appendicitis, however, can sometimes occur elsewhere in the abdomen. In some people, the appendix is on the left side of the abdomen, and in pregnant women, the enlarged uterus can push the caecum along with this pesky organ into the upper abdomen. 

In infants and small children, diagnostic delays are common because symptoms are often mistaken for gastrointestinal or urinary tract infections, or a host of other abdominal disorders with symptoms that can mimic those of appendicitis. 

Within 36 hours of the start of the symptoms, the appendix in a child can rupture, spilling its infected contents into the abdomen and creating a serious medical emergency. Within 48 hours after abdominal pain begins, 80 per cent of children will experience a ruptured appendix, according to a report in the journal Contemporary Pediatrics. The appendix ruptures in 90 per cent of children under 2. 

All told, in one-third of children with appendicitis, the appendix ruptures before the ailment is correctly diagnosed and treated. 

In the elderly, too, appendicitis often results in a delayed diagnosis, because even when the appendix is severely inflamed, the pain is often minimal and patients have no fever. In 40 to 75 per cent of patients over 60, the appendix has ruptured by the time it is surgically removed. 

Among pregnant women, in addition to the unusual location of the pain when the appendix is displaced by the uterus, patients often assume their symptoms are somehow related to pregnancy, not appendicitis. In women who are not pregnant, the symptoms of appendicitis can be confused with gallbladder disease, a ruptured ovarian cyst or pelvic inflammatory disease. 

Confusing matters even further, some people experience recurrent attacks of appendicitis, without rupture, over a period of years before the cause of their symptoms is determined. Experts say that appendicitis should be suspected in patients with a history of recurring pain in the lower right abdomen that goes away on its own. 

 Regular cuts: Surgical removal is the treatment 

of choice 

Appendicitis most often occurs between the ages of 10 and 30; 80 per cent of cases occur before age 45. Heredity figures in the risk, which is up to 10 times as great as normal in someone with a parent or sibling who has had appendicitis. Diets high in fibre are linked to a lower risk of appendicitis, probably because stool is softer and passes more quickly through the digestive tract. In countries with high-fibre intake, the incidence of appendicitis is one-tenth that of countries with Westernised low-fibre diets. Appendicitis occurs when the appendix, a hollow finger-shaped organ, becomes obstructed, most often by pieces of hardened stool, sometimes by parasites, stones, tumours or foreign bodies. Infection and inflammation and the buildup of fluid follow until the appendix becomes gangrenous and ruptures. In most cases, these symptoms are commonly associated with appendicitis: pain that starts around the navel and moves to the lower right side of the abdomen within a day; low-grade fever, rarely over 101 on the first day of pain; nausea and vomiting; a feeling of constipation; and a progressively severe ache that gets worse while walking or coughing. 

But even if you do not experience the usual symptoms, abdominal pain that comes on suddenly and does not go away within a few hours warrants a medical investigation, lest appendicitis be missed and result in a ruptured appendix. Following a description of symptoms, the medical work-up starts with a physical exam, which typically reveals localised tenderness and signs of muscle inflammation. The white blood cell count is higher than normal in about two-thirds of patients. 

If the diagnosis is in doubt, a sonogram, CT scan or both are often needed to help the doctor zero in on a correct diagnosis. Sonograms are most helpful in children and pregnant women. A refinement of the CT scan, an appendiceal CT scan that uses a dye inserted in the rectum, takes only about 15 minutes, involves far less radiation exposure and is more accurate in pinpointing appendicitis than a generalised abdominal scan, according to a report in the Emergency Medicine. 

A more invasive procedure, laparoscopy, is sometimes used for diagnosis. It enables the doctor to view the appendix directly and, at the same time, other abdominal organs to determine more precisely the cause of symptoms. Appendectomy ? surgical removal of the appendix ? is the only accepted treatment for appendicitis. This can be done through an ordinary surgical incision or laparoscopically. Although laparoscopy is more costly up front, it involves a shorter hospital stay, less pain, fewer complications and quicker recovery.

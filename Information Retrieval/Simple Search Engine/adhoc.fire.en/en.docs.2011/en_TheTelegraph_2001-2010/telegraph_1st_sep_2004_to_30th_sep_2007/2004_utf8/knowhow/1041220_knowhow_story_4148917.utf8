potato bar 

I (58) have been suffering from type II diabetes for the last 10 years. Although I have religiously avoided potatoes, I have come across research reports that say restriction on potatoes is not that important. Is it a correct dietary advice?

Dietary advice for diabetes is far more lenient nowadays. Potato or any other vegetable that grows underground is no longer considered prohibited. The emphasis is on a balanced diet which includes adequate amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, natural vitamins and minerals along with enough fibres or roughage. Potato is rich in a complex carbohydrate like starch, which is an important source of energy to the body. However, too much of it can cause the blood glucose to rise very quickly after a meal. Even this problem can be taken care of by consuming unpeeled potatoes. Obviously, the boiled form should be preferred to the fried ones in order to cut down calories. In this context, it should be kept in mind that 100 grams of potato yield about 100 calories, while the same amount of wheat or rice gives almost 350 calories.

swollen feet

I have been suffering from diabetes and hypertension for the last 12 years. Recently my insulin requirement has gone down and I have also noticed that my feet have become swollen. Please help.

The combination of long-standing diabetes and high blood pressure is worrisome. The swelling of the feet also needs attention. Moreover, a decreasing insulin requirement suggests your kidney function is deteriorating. Usually all these signs point toward what is known as ?diabetic nephropathy? which can lead to kidney problems unless it is treated in the early stage. Please get in touch with a diabetes specialist as well as a nephrologist to check the levels of creatinine and potassium in the blood. It should also be determined if there is any trace of protein in the urine. 

lean and thin

I am an 18-year-old man. I am extremely thin and weak in constitution. Moreover, I am extremely short. Please suggest a way out.

Your symptoms of weakness, thinness and short stature indicate that you have a chronic systemic illness which could originate in any organ in the body? the intestines, kidneys, lungs, heart or the endocrine system that regulates the hormonal secretion of the body. You need to consult a doctor about your case history and physical signs to determine the direction of investigations. However, you should be aware that at your age chances of gaining height are minimal.

bitter truth

I am 60. I eat loads of chocolates and have bitter items (fenugreek and bitter gourd) later to offset the damage. Is that effective?

As I have already mentioned, a diet for diabetics is not that restricted nowadays. All food items should to be consumed according to a daily meal plan and a specific calorie prescription. You can have small amounts of sweets once in a while, but obviously after reducing other sources of carbohydrates and fatty foods. Remember that chocolates have a lot of ?empty? calories that simply increase weight and enhance blood triglycerides, increasing the risk of heart diseases. It?s better to have your calories from legumes (such as soyabeans and gramseeds) which are nutritionally superior to chocolates. Eating bitter items is good, but they cannot counteract the harmful effects of an excess of calories and fats. So it is not wise to add too many calories with the hope that bitter herbs will bring down the blood sugar level.

artificial hormone

My son (18) has been obese since he was 14. Physical exercise and a controlled diet have failed to cut down the flab. A doctor has advised synthetic thyroxin. Is it a safe medication? 

Hormonal therapy with synthetic thyroxin (eltroxin) is the right prescription for your son. It?s also safe. Moreover, if his problem is left untreated, the risk of developing a malfunctioning thyroid gland is high.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

Indians? black hole idea triumphs

 BY PATHIK GUHA 

If you thought only the Cambridge University physicist Stephen Hawking has made black holes ? famous for gobbling up all matter in their vicinity, yet being able to eject trickles of radiation ? curiouser and curiouser, take a break. Four physicists ? Drs Biman Nath and Suparna Roychowdhury from the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore, and Drs S. Ruszkowski and M.C. Begelman at the University of Colorado, Boulder, US ? have also shown that black holes can cause ejection of hot gases from the centres of clusters of galaxies. 

The release of hot gas from galaxy clusters has been baffling experts, and various theories have been offered to explain the phenomenon. Nath, Roychowdhury, Ruszkowski and Begelman have written a paper in the Astrophysical Journal, basically elaborating on ideas first put forward by Nath and Roychowdhury in 2002, to show how black holes lurking in galaxy clusters can push out hot gases from them. 

?The crux of the idea,? says Nath in response to an e-mail from KnowHOW, ?is this: the accretion [due to huge gravitation] of surrounding matter by black holes within galaxy clusters produces enormous jets of particles moving in velocities approaching that of light. These particles, being more energetic but less dense than the surrounding gas in the galaxy clusters, move like bubbles in soda water. In the process, they heat up and push out the gas.? 

And now come observational data to show that Nath and co-researchers are right. In a soon-to-be-published paper, a group of astronomers from the Bristol University say it has got ?telltale hints? supporting their idea. ?The implications of the preliminary results are clear,? says Nath. ?Black holes not only gobble up what they find in their vicinity, they also dump huge amounts of energy into the surroundings.?

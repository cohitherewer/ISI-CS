CHECKLIST

 Feasting on fish, garlic, almonds, 

 fruits and vegetables, dark chocolate, along with a glass 

 of wine can reduce the risk of problems such as heart attack 

 when compared with the diet of the general population. Dining 

 regularly on a ?Polymeal?, which has ingredients to boost 

 the health of the heart and blood vessels, can cut the risk 

 of cardiovascular disease by more than three-quarters, researchers 

 claim. Scientists at the University Medical Centre in Rotterdam 

 devised the diet by searching the medical literature for 

 ingredients. They used mathematical models to analyse the 

 effects that regularly eating certain foods can have on 

 the health of a population. On average, men eating the ?Polymeal? 

 can boost their total life expectancy by 6.6 years, and 

 women by 4.8 years, the study estimates.

 Wafting perfumed smoke from ecclesiastical 

 candles or incense sticks may offer religious bliss to millions 

 of churchgoers, but chemical assaults on the lungs from 

 the incense can be 20 times as bad as standing next to a 

 busy road. According to a report in the New Scientist, 

 air quality test at two Dutch churches revealed high levels 

 of soot, metals and other toxins which can penetrate deep 

 into the lungs and cause a variety of heart and lung conditions, 

 including cancer. An earlier research at a temple in Taiwan 

 showed that incense-burning can create high levels of cancer-causing 

 organic compounds. 

 Magnetic brace-lets may offer pain relief in osteoarthritis, UK-based doctors have claimed. Numerous studies have failed to explain the effect of magnets on chronic pain. To resolve the issue, the group tested magnets for controlling pain due to osteoarth-ritis of the hip and knee in 194 patients ranging in age from 45 to 80 years. The participants were randomly asked to wear bracelets with a standard neodymium magnet with a field strength of 170 to 200 mTesla, a weak magnet intended to produce 21 to 30 mTesla, or a ?dummy? non-magnetic bracelet. The team concludes that the magnet therapy works as good as other frontline osteoarthritis treatments, such as non-steroidal topical creams, oral nonsteroidal drugs and exercise therapy. 

 Pornography is an addiction as 

 dangerous as crack cocaine, reports a sexual trauma specialist 

 from the University of Pennsylvania in the US. He took brain 

 scans of porn addicts viewing XXX images and found that 

 it triggered the release of natural opioids which have a 

 feel-good effect, just like the drug cocaine does in those 

 who abuse it.

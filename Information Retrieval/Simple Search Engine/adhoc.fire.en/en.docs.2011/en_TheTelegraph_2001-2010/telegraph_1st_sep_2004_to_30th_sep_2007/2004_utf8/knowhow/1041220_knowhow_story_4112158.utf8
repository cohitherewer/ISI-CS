Effective alternative

 Starving non-cancerous growth can do away with traumatic surgeries. G.S. Mudur reports 

 Silent epidemic: Uterine fibroids may be found 

in up to 40 per cent of women over 35 

After two years of what seemed to her like torrential menstrual bleeding that would last far too long each time and when medicines didn?t help much, the 38-year old woman began to prepare for a hysterectomy or surgical removal of the uterus. Fibroids, or benign, non-cancerous growths, had bloomed along the muscles of her uterus and she recalled hearing somewhere that the ?real solution? lay in the surgery. But doctors at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh, offered her an alternative. Instead of surgery to remove the uterus, they told her, she could opt for a far less traumatic procedure designed to selectively shrink the fibroids and leave the uterus intact. 

With a go-ahead from the woman, Dr J. Rajiv Bapuraj, an interventional radiologist, blocked the blood vessels that supplied blood to the fibroids ? a procedure called embolisation. Starved of their blood supply, the fibroids began to shrink. In six months, they had reduced to less than half their normal size. ?Hysterectomy has a place in medicine but it?s a kind of a mutilating operation,? said Bapuraj. ?This new procedure promises to be an effective alternative to many women.? 

Over the past two years, Bapuraj and his colleagues at the PGIMER have performed uterine fibroid embolisations in just over 35 women. The PGIMER doctors have presented a paper on embolisation as an option for the treatment of uterine fibroids in this month?s issue of the International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. ?It is a promising option, but it can?t be offered to all women,? cautions Dr Vanita Suri, a co-author of the paper and associate professor of gynaecology and obstetrics at the PGIMER. 

Gynaecologists say uterine fibroids may be found in up to 40 per cent of women above 35, although in a large number of women, they may not cause any symptoms. The size, the number and the location of the fibroids in the uterus influence the severity of symptoms ? heavy and long-lasting menstrual bleeding and consequent anaemia, pelvic pain, or a sensation of pressure in the pelvic region. Some doctors estimate that just 10 per cent of women with uterine fibroids actually require medical treatment. ?Hysterectomy and the surgical removal of fibroids continue to be offered as the key solutions to uterine fibroids,? said Bapuraj. Gynaecologists concede there is anecdotal evidence that women who did not respond to medication but may not have needed hysterectomies either have been offered the operation. 

?I?ve seen patients with fibroids less than two centimetres and heavy menstrual bleeding who?ve been recommended hysterectomy,? said Dr Sonia Malik, a gynaecologist in New Delhi and the general secretary of the Indian Menopause Society. Such small fibroids are unlikely to cause symptoms. The bleeding could have been due to hormonal problems that could be controlled through medication, Malik said. Almost all the women who have undergone embolisation for uterine fibroids at the PGIMER are between 35 and 45 years who have already had children and do not expect to become pregnant again. 

In embolisation, a radiologist inserts a catheter through an artery in the woman?s groin and guides it into her uterine artery ? the blood vessel that carries blood to the uterus. There, the catheter is used to inject a tiny amount of a synthetic polymer substance intended to block the flow of blood. 

?The architecture of the blood vessels in the region is such that the polymer selectively flows into the microvessels that feed blood to the fibroids, choking off blood supply only to the fibroids and not to the other muscles of the uterus,? said Bapuraj. Without blood supply, the fibroids shrink in size. Embolisation emerged as an alternative therapy for uterine fibroids about a decade ago. In India, however, it is still available ?on a very limited scale,? said Malik. This is primarily because hysterectomy reigns as the key solution and because expertise in interventional radiology has yet to spread across the country. 

However, doctors who perform embolisation caution that there is a subset of patients whom it may not help. The PGIMER experience, for instance, suggests that it is not effective in women who also have infections or inflammation and in women who have pressure symptoms caused by the fibroids. ?The technique is effective in the subset of women who have excessive bleeding as the primary symptom,? said Bapuraj. 

Although uterine fibroid embolisation avoids the risks of major surgery associated with both hysterectomy and the surgical removal of fibroids, it may subject the woman to the risks associated with a catheter-based procedure such as bruising or bleeding at the puncture site and infection. 

The majority of women begin to have normal menstrual cycles after the procedure. However, according to the American College of Radiologists and the Radiological Society of North America, in one to five per cent of women, menopause occurs shortly after uterine fibroid embolisation. But this appears to occur more commonly in women who are older than 45 years when they undergo embolisation. ?The possibility of menopause is a concern,? said PGIMER gynaecologist Suri.

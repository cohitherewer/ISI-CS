chest pain

I am a 48-year-old man. I often get chest pain. I had high blood pressure two years ago with a small rise in the blood sugar level. I have been smoking at least eight cigarettes a day for the last 11 years. Whenever there is a chest pain I take antacids which work fine. Can it lead to heart ailments?

Your occasional chest pain may not always be due to a problem related to flatulence. You have risk factors like high blood pressure, smoking, high blood sugar and so on which may increase your susceptibility to cardiac problems. You should go for tests under the guidance of your cardiologist to rule out the possibility of any cardiac problem. Please stop smoking and take medicines to keep your blood pressure under control. Take salt- and fat-restricted diabetic diet (your doctor will be able to guide you on this). Antacids aren?t an antidote to your chest pain. See a cardiologist and get an ECG done. 

blood pressure

I am a 63-year-old man. I used to take a few medicines for high blood pressure. Now my blood pressure is normal. Should I stop taking the blood pressure-lowering medicines? Please advise.

High blood pressure is a disorder which can?t be cured completely, but can be controlled through medicine. If you stop taking the medicines at this age, there is every possibility that your blood pressure will bounce back to a high level. So it is advisable to continue taking the medicines even if the blood pressure is well under control.

breathing problem

My father has been suffering from a chronic heart disease. Recently, he has developed a breathing problem. According to our cardiologist, he has an enlarged heart. Can it be cured? 

Various diseases may cause the enlargement of the heart. It is necessary to find exactly what has led to it. One investigation, which may be extremely helpful in this regard, is an echocardiography. Meet a cardiologist and get the test done.

Fatty deposits

I am a 43-year-old man suffering from a heart ailment. A cardiologist has recommended diet restrictions and exercises to reduce the chances of atherosclerosis. Please tell me more about the problem.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder in which arterial walls lose elasticity and thicken due to deposition of hard yellow plaque of lipoid material in the internal layer of the arteries. You have said you have a heart problem, but haven?t mention any specific irritant. Nevertheless, atherosclerosis can make one susceptible to heart attacks. Diet restrictions and regulated lifestyle can check atherosclerosis. For you, it would be wise to cut down on diet rich in fat and cholesterol. Do moderate exercises like brisk walking and swimming. Stop smoking or any other form of tobacco intake. If you follow these guidelines, the risk of atherosclerosis can be reduced. 

poor blood supply

My uncle (55) occasionally suffers from chest pain. The doctor says he has a problem called ischaemic heart disease, caused by poor blood supply to the heart, and advised him to undergo angiography. What?s wrong with him? 

Chest pain at this age may or may not be caused by ischaemic heart disease, a disorder in which blood supply to the heart muscles falls due to narrowing of the coronary arteries (which supply blood to the tissues of the heart). It is necessary to ascertain whether your uncle has pain on exertion or during any other activity. To pin down the cause of the chest pain, he should undergo investigations like electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography. A blood test is necessary to know whether he is diabetic. The levels of lipid in his blood also need to be checked. On the basis of these investigations a doctor will decide whether he needs angiography (a test to reveal the functioning of the arterial system by injecting an opaque liquid into it). See a cardiologist.

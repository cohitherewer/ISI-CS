BRAIN STORMING

DEBKUMAR MITRA

Newspapers are full of mathematical surprises. 

Every morning one?s attention is drawn to the business pages ? they are full of 

numbers. And one can spend the whole day creating a whole lot of puzzles by using 

the business number facts. I tried it last week and the result with the Bombay 

Stock Exchange sensex and it was quite interesting. I?m sure many of you would 

be doing the same. One other interesting game is to fill the crossword puzzle 

grid with numbers. One can use the grid as many ways as one likes. However, one 

has state the problem clearly and then attempt to put numbers on the grid. Another 

simple game is to calculate the frequency of use of a particular word over a week 

in headlines. Soon you would know the favourite word of your daily. Have fun with 

your newspaper, bye!

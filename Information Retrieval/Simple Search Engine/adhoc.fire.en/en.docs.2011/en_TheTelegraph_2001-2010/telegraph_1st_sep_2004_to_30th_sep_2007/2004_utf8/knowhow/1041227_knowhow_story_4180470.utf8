Ball 

Crystal Ball

 Scientists have used a needle, just 0.000,000,000,000,001 cm thin, to perform a delicate surgical operation on a single living cell, says a study to be published in Nano-Letters. In order to manipulate cells, this will soon replace tiny injectors called micro-capillaries which introduce molecules such as proteins, peptides and genetic material into cells without any fatal damage. A team of Japanese doctors claim that the new procedure can be used to manipulate embryonic stem cells (mother cells that can give birth to any type of cells) for medical treatment. This ?nano-needle? was applied along with an ultra-thin atomic force microscope to penetrate the membrane of a cell to a minuscule depth.

 One drawback of the wireless hand-held 

 devices like the BlackBerry and the Treo is that they allow 

 spammers to follow users wherever they go. This may not 

 be the case any more. A new version of InBoxer, a software 

 package made by Audiotrieve, brings spam filters that are 

 common on full-size computers to the world of e-mail on 

 hand-helds. InBoxer 2.0 incorporates its own message-forwarding 

 function, allowing it to do the filtering first.

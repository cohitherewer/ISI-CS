Guinea pig on chips

 Tissue engineers may put an end to animal tests, writes Prasun Chaudhuri

 live experimenting 

It?s a thumbnail-sized silicon chip, stuffed with hundreds of thousands of liver cells meant to mimic the metabolism of a lab animal. The so-called animal-on-chip has a job cut out for it ? to allow scientists to test drugs or cosmetics for toxic side-effects, sparing monkeys, rats and guinea pigs in laboratories. 

Rabid animal-rights activism and acute organ shortage provoked tissue engineers to grow the cells of complex organs and assemble them on tiny silicon chips. However, growing a functioning organ has proved elusive, because a kidney or a lung need lots of plumbing ? capillaries, arteries and veins ? to despatch nutrient-rich blood and remove body waste. But scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), US, and the Cambridge University, UK, have been able to develop a rudimentary liver-on-a-chip which can realistically stimulate a lab animal?s metabolism. 

?Animals-on-chip are highly in demand because biomedical research is being constantly attacked by animal rights extremists,? said Dr Lize King, the communications officer at the Cambridge Massachusetts Institute (CMI), a partnership between the American and British institutions. 

One of the leaders of the project is MIT?s tissue engineer Linda Griffith. Her team has been able to perfect a liver chip that mimics the function of a real liver. ?Well, it?s the body?s largest organ and essential for several body functions,? said Griffith. ?The artificial liver could lead to new methods of testing drug toxicity and new treatments for critical liver disorders.? 

Liver disease is very difficult to study, because once liver cells are outside the body, they lose their ability to become infected. Griffith built a tiny three-dimensional silicon scaffold that, combined with a few liver cells, turns into a tiny liver-on-a-chip. The chip is made with small channels that mimic the blood vessels of a real liver. Once the chip is attached to a circulation system, fluid is flowed through the tissue, just like blood would flow through in the body. This enables scientists to study the cells and understand what?s happening in the tissue. 

The hope is that the liver chip will allow scientists to test drugs and perform other experiments that will never be possible with people, avoiding the use of lab animals. 

Although drug-makers use animals to predict if an experimental compound will have toxic side-effects or if it will make people sick instead giving them a cure, animal tests are usually slow, expensive, often inaccurate and objectionable. 

Four out of five drugs that make it through animal tests fail in human clinical trials because animal organs, and the processes that take place in them, are not identical to those of humans. 

Every year hundreds of drugs that would have been safe in humans are shelved because they sicken animals. Interestingly, penicillin ? the wonder drug of the last century ? was found to be toxic in guinea pigs, but the researchers went on to test it on mice to rule out the safety concerns. 

Moreover, in animal experiments researchers must use several animals to test different doses of a drug, and must monitor those animals over time to pick up the side-effects. To acquire and maintain a single lab animal is pretty expensive. In contrast, an animal-on-chip is expected to be priced below $50. Simply put, it will save millions in drug tests. 

?Right now, the cost of clinical trials is very high,? said Griffith. ?What we hope is that the technology will allow researchers to much better predict how a treatment will work before organising a clinical trial, avoiding the use of lab animals, and eventually few human patients may be needed.? All this will surely sound as music to the ears of animal activists.

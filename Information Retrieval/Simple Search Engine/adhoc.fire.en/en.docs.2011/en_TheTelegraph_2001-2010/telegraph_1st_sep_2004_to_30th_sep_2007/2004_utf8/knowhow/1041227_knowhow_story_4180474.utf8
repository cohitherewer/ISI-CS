 Plant oil benefit

 A group of researchers from the University of McGill have identified a new way to reduce fat and cholesterol levels in the body. Reporting their findings in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the scientists say that consuming plant-derived sterols (or oils), along with exercise, may benefit those who are suffering from various coronary heart disorders. Plant sterols are present in nuts, seeds, legumes and vegetable oils. According to the scientists, exercise involved using stair-stepping machines and stationary bicycles three times a week. 

 Pacemaker aid

 Pacemakers can help protect epilepsy 

 patients from sudden death after or during seizures, say 

 a group of British researchers in the journal The Lancet. 

 During seizures, undiagnosed heart rhythm problems play 

 a role in sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. In fact, 

 one in 1,000 epilepsy patients die of an unexplained cause 

 after a seizure. The researchers say that pacemakers can 

 protect them from sudden heart disorders which become fatal 

 during seizures. 

 BAD NEWS 

 Empty stomach evil 

 A University of Buffalo study says that consuming alcohol mostly without food is a significant risk factor for developing hypertension, reports the journal Hypertension. This is over and above the other ill effects of consuming alcohol. The researchers say that the effect on blood pressure, which leads to hypertension, was present even in people with light-to-moderate alcohol intake. The research also confirms previous findings showing a relationship between heavy alcohol consumption and high blood pressure.

 Obese immigrants

 According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, those immigrants who have lived in the US for at least 15 years are nearly as obese as US-born adults. Interestingly, most of the immigrants considered during the study were from countries where the prevalence of obesity is lower than that of the US, but acculturation to the US environment led to an increasing prevalence of obesity among this population. The study was led by Mita Sanghavi Goel, a researcher from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

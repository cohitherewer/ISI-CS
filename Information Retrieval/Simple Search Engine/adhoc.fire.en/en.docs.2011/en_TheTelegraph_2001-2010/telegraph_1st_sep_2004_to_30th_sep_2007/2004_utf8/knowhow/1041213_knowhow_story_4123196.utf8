Needed: ears, not eyes

 Wild eyes: Pentagon (shown in picture) trying 

to learn evolutionary games 

For andrew parker,who fills his days at the Oxford 

University studying the irrigation system in beetles and the dazzling iridescence 

of butterfly wings, life changed through an e-mail. His book, In the Blink 

of an Eye, had stirred up the Pentagon, and they wanted to talk.

Until recently, Parker?s book would have been for the intellectuals. But not any more. The Pentagon met him at a secret location, where scores of their own staff helicoptered in. Parker wasn?t briefing them on urban irrigation or glittery makeovers. Even his book that caused such a brouhaha dealt with the mystery of the Cambrian explosion, a geologic event 543 million years old, definitely off-limits to Washington?s ?search-and-destroy? missions. As palaeontology?s greatest enigma, this Big Bang of evolution had rapidly transformed life into a stunning array of species. Earth?s oceans, which were replete with blind, squirming jelly bags, looked radically different after it. Parker theorised that the eye?s emergence had triggered such a change. 

Those that possessed visual senses relished on the all-you-can-eat buffet of their blind relatives. In response, others soon developed their own defences, sparking an evolutionary arms race.

Suddenly the Pentagon?s monotonic gaze seemed to crystallise out differently: maybe Parker could help them solve the arms race by simulating the Cambrian explosion! The ?Cambrian Programme? he was assigned was a humongous computer modelling system which could provide information leading to emerging threats ? in principle.

The good folks in Washington weren?t resurrecting these jaded creatures, after all; the ghostly creepy crawlies with unpronounceable names and unthinkable architecture were still extinct but intact. Nor was it heartbreaking to again lay the groundwork for a one-way street ? misusing science to suit petty self-interests. Rather, statutory duties ? the job of getting inside a terrorist?s head ? raised the billion-dollar question: Will the Pentagon?s efforts really pay off? The answer is harder to predict than the course of evolution itself, since random mutations will shatter even the most predictable outcomes.

But as the Pentagon grows eyes, the terrorists will become invisible. Specialised light-sensitive cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion, yet full-blown eyes awaited opportune times. The prime mover was light itself. With no light, the Pentagon turns blind, but the terrorists lose the need to possess their visual organs as well. This metaphorical light, which must be the root cause of terrorism, is the darkness that surrounds the oppressed. Unless the Pentagon deigns to remove their invasive light of tyranny, real light will have to wait, and the arms race will continue to spiral in a dangerous, feedback loop.

Sadly, it?s hard to hear logic when you?re drum up your arrogance. One has to wonder, then, whether the Pentagon is after the wrong sense organ. What they instead need to grow may just be a pair of old-fashioned ears.

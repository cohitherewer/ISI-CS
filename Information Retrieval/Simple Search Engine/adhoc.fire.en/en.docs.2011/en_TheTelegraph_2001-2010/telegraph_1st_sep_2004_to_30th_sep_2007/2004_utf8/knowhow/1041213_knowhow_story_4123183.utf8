 IBM?s still-incomplete Blue Gene/L system ? to be installed next year at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to study the US nuclear stockpile and for other research ? has officially been named the fastest supercomputer in the world by the Top500 project, an independent group of university computer scientists, reports AP. The system, just a quarter of the planned size for calculating 360,000,000, 000,000 calculations a second in future, was measured at 70,720, 000,000,000 calculations per second, double the performance of the reigning leader, Japan?s Earth Simulator (35,860,000, 000,000 calculations a second).

Bible readers who study scripture on hand-held palmtop 

devices have a new version ? in fact, six versions in one. Three publishing houses 

in the US have together released the Zondervan NIV Study Bible Suite, software 

for the Palm OS and Windows Mobile operating systems that includes Zondervan?s 

New International Version Study Bible with 20,000 footnotes and 100,000 hyperlinked 

cross-references. Readers can add notes, highlight text and bookmark passages, 

or customise font size and colour in their screens.

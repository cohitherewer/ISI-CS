BRAIN STORMING

DEBKUMAR MITRA

 I am looking at the calendar 

 2005. It is rather interesting. The year starts on a Saturday 

 and ends on a Saturday. When was it last that a year started 

 and ended on the same day? Can we calculate that? Is there 

 a general formula? 

 I will wait for the answers. 

 I?m sure there is more than one smart way to calculate the 

 same. Do write to me at debkumarkqscore.com. 

 Meanwhile, let me take this 

 opportunity to thank you all for the fabulous support for 

 the column throughout the year. Keep the good work going 

 ? send puzzles, write to me and send answers. This one (2005) 

 is a prime year. If you add the digits you get seven. Do 

 expect some prime puzzles from me. Wish you and your families 

 a Very Happy New Year.

 PUZZLE 

 1: For Tim?s birthday, his mother brought him 

 and three friends to the local arcade for an evening of 

 fun and games. The boys spent the evening competing with 

 each other for the highest scores on their favourite arcade 

 games, all of them classic older games. Determine the full 

 name of each friend, each friend?s favourite arcade game, 

 and the game on which each friend achieved the highest score: 

 (1) Tim?s favourite game is not Asteroids. The boy 

 whose last name is Spade scored highest in Tetris. 

 Rick?s last name isn?t White; (2) The favourite game of 

 the boy who scored highest in Battle Zone was Centipede;

 last name wasn?t Parker; (4) Tim scored the highest in Q-Bert. 

 Sam?s favourite was Asteroids; (5) The boy who scored 

 highest in Battle Zone wasn?t Rick. The boy whose

 of the boy whose last name is White. The boy whose last 

 name is Parker didn?t get the highest score in Pac-Man.

 PUZZLE CRACKED

 Solution 1: We should bet $312.50 on the first game. We can deduce the answer by going backward from when the score is (3,3) (3 won and 3 lost). When the score is (3,3), the amount won or lost must be 0. When the score is (4,2) the sum won or lost must be $1,000. We can arrive at (3,3) or (4,2) from (3,2). So when the score is (3,2), the sum won or lost must be halfway between 0, and 1,000, i.e. 500.

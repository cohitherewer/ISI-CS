THE 

SEVENTY GREAT INVENTIONS 

Edited by Brian Fagan

Thames amp; Hudson; pound; 24.95

 Stone choppers, eyed needles, z-type folding beds, waterproof umbrellas ? human history is paved with remarkable inventions. 

 The book takes you on an eye-opening and unusual journey through human innovations from the early Stone Age up until the early medieval period ? some fundamental and others intriguing and bizarre. An international team of scientists, archaeologists and historians reveals 70 of the most extraordinary inventions, from two-and-a-half million years ago up to the early medieval period. Expectedly, the book begins with the basic technologies of stone, fire, woodworking, ceramics and so on.

 The wonderfully illustrated coffee-table book has hundreds of photographs, diagrams, reconstructions and plans. 

 Fagan, eminent anthropologist and an authority on world prehistory, has taken pains so the book examines the earliest human traditions, including body painting and tattooing, and traces the beginning of writing as well as early use of codes and ciphers.

 Read this book if you want to know what made us what we are today.

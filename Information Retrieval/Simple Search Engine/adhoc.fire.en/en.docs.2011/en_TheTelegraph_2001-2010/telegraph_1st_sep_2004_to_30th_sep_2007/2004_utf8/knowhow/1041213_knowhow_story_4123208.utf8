glaucoma risk

My father (55) suffered a complete vision loss due to glaucoma. I?m now 28. Although I?ve no visual problems as yet, is it possible that I will also develop glaucoma? Is there any preventive measure? 

Genetics and family history play some role in glaucoma. But there is no specific preventive measure as such. However, an early treatment is crucial to combat glaucoma and you need a regular eye check-up. I recommend you go for a few tests for early detection of the occurrence of glaucoma. These tests (such as dark-room test, water-drinking test and so on) detect the disease at an early stage. Apart from these, examination of the optic nerve-head can also be carried out for an early detection of the disease. 

glass problem

My daughter (21) is short-sighted. She is using spectacles, but looks odd with them on. She can?t wear contact lenses because they cause redness in her eyes. Is there any surgical operation that can help her? 

Your daughter is suffering from an ailment related to the refraction of the eye known as myopia. Since she dislikes spectacles and is unable to use contact lenses, a surgical measure by applying laser (called LASIK) can be used to tackle her problem. In this operation, the curvature of the cornea is changed precisely so that it can help focus light exactly on the retina. But the success of the operation depends on a number of conditions like the power of the eye, extent of myopia, condition of cornea and so on. I think a thorough assessment of the condition of her eyes is required. 

enlarged eyes

My son is 2 years old. All of a sudden his eyes have got enlarged and he keeps avoiding looking at light. There is also watering from both the eyes. Please help.

It seems your son is suffering from a problem known as congenital glaucoma. In this condition the eye pressure is increased since birth and it?s manifested as bulging of the eyes. A few investigations for assessing the extent of glaucoma should be carried out and a surgical treatment should be done. So see an ophthalmologist soon for deciding on the next course of action.

watering eye

I am a 62-year-old man suffering from watering in the left eye. I?ve consulted an eye specialist who says it is due to some weakness in my eye muscles. Is it so? Can you help me?

First, the cause of the watering has to be confirmed through clinical examination. Then you will have to undergo a test called syringing to exclude any obstruction in the tear passage. If there is any obstruction, you?ll need an operation to clear the passage. But if there is no obstruction other causes of the watering should be explored. Sometimes, in people of your age, the opening of the tear passage turns outward and this results in watering from the eye. This can be corrected by surgery. However, if the weakness in the eye muscles is confirmed, then treatment should be carried out accordingly, both by medicines and operation.

cataract surgery

My father (65) is a diabetic who had undergone a cataract operation three years ago, followed by implantation of intra ocular lens (IOL) in both the eyes. Initially he didn?t have any problems but recently, his cataract has recurred. Does he need another operation? 

It appears your father has got a complication of cataract operation known as ?after-cataract?. It?s truly not a cataract, it?s the thickened posterior covering of the lens of the eye. In patients suffering from diabetes, the problem is quite common. It?s important that your father controls his blood-sugar level. Regarding the necessity of operation, it?s important to assess the visual level of the patient. If he can?t carry out his normal activities with his left eye, even with the aid of spectacles, he should undergo laser surgery to get rid of the after-cataract. However, a strict monitoring of the condition is required.

 Vegetable power

According to a study reported in the Journal of Nutrition, antioxidants in spinach help in protecting the eyes from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light ? a leading cause of cataract. Though vitamin E is known to protect the eyes from UV-induced damage, the antioxidants in spinach and other deep green vegetables were found to be nearly 10 times more powerful at the task.

and evening, after office hours. The difference in mood was observed in the of

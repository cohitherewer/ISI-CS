 GOOD NEWS

 Arthritis antidote

 The bark of a Christmas tree (the real one) may offer a clue to curing arthritis. A study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry by researchers from the University of Turku in Finland says that a group of anti- inflammatory compounds in the bark of the Scotch pine ? widely used for Christmas trees ? can be developed into food supplements or drugs for treating arthritis and pain. The scientists also add that these compounds are likely to be found in other pine species as well.

 Odour diagnosis

According to a study presented by researchers from 

the Columbia University at the annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, 

the inability to identify the smell of lemons, lilac, leather and seven other 

odours predicts which patients with minimal to mild cognitive impairment will 

develop the Alzheimer?s disease. This will help in early diagnosis of the Alzheimer?s 

in a large number of patients and help them make the most from the available treatment.

 BAD NEWS 

 Stroke risk

 People suffering from migraine are twice more likely to suffer from a stroke than others. According to a paper published in the British Medical Journal, researchers in Canada and the US looked at 14 studies probing an association between stroke and migraine. They found that the risk of stroke for migraine sufferers was 2.16 times that for non-sufferers. They feel the increased risk of stroke is probably due to the reduced blood flow to the brain which usually occurs in migraine. 

 Equal damage

 A report published in Nicotine amp; Tobacco Research says that people who smoke light cigarettes are getting just as much tar and nicotine as those smoking normal cigarettes. A study conducted by K. Michael Cummings from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, says that most smokers think light brands are less dangerous, but they actually contain the same tar and nicotine levels. A study conducted by Michael Thun, head of epidemiological research for the American Cancer Society, last year reached the same conclusion and showed that lung cancer risk from light and ultra light cigarettes was identical to regular cigarettes.

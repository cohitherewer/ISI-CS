Just a few hiccups

 Should your PC double as a telephone? Thomas Z. Fitzgerald asks 

 Inexpensive calls: Internet phone-providers are 

coming up with several new features 

With e-mail and instant messaging, the Internet has already changed the way people communicate, but the technology it threatens most directly is the telephone. Among the attractions of Internet telephone service, already in an estimated 600,000 households in the US, are inexpensive, often unlimited local and long-distance calling plans and less red tape when compared to conventional phone service. In addition, many of the Internet phone-providers have rolled out new features and options made possible by the decentralised nature of Internet technology. 

The growth in new features is attributable to a jump in the number of companies providing Internet phone service (known as VoIP for voice over Internet protocol), each vying for a slice of a growing pie of new subscribers and differentiating themselves on options as well as price. Sorting through these plans may take some time, but it can pay off in the form of greater savings and more features. 

To establish VoIP service, you need a broadband Internet connection, a standard telephone and a telephone adapter, usually a paperback-size device supplied by the service- provider, which connects the telephone to your Internet connection. 

Most plans include conventional phone services like caller ID, call wa-iting, voice mail and call forwarding. Features beyond those can include having your voice-mail messages e-mailed to you so you can listen to them on a computer; adding a foreign phone number to your account so overseas callers can reach you at no charge; maintaining an online address book that synchronises with your PC?s address book; and keeping your phone number or switching to one in nearly any area code. 

But while VoIP offers many benefits, there are some negatives to be aware of. It is important to understand how a provider?s 911 service works before signing on, especially if you are replacing conventional phone service that includes enhanced 911, which automatically provides information to the operator about the location of a caller. Some VoIP providers offer 911 service, but most do not yet offer enhanced 911. 

Quality of service can be another drawback. Because the calls often travel across the Internet, packets of data can be lost or delayed, which can cause occasional echo or lag. Such hiccups are usually not disturbing enough to be deal-breakers, and the providers are working on improving the technology. 

Another issue is the possibility of a power outage. Even with batteries backing up your broadband modem, router and telephone adapter, the service may not work if you lose power because your Internet service-provider may not guarantee service during outages.This can be important to know during an emergency. Residential VoIP service providers generally fit into two broad categories: BYOB, for bring your own broadband, and the cable operators. With a BYOB provider, it does not matter where you get your Internet access, as long as it is a high-speed account. 

Vonage, an early BYOB start-up, is still the leading provider of residential service, although its market share has come under attack. Vonage offers plans with either limited or unlimited calling within the US and Canada, and both plans include basic features like voice mail, caller ID, call waiting and call forwarding. 

Like most VoIP providers, Vonage includes a Web-based 

interface to manage account settings. For example, you can set up e-mail alerts 

to notify you of new voice-mail messages, and the messages themselves can be attached 

to the alerts as WAV files, enabling you to listen to them. You can also use the 

Web interface to activate call forwarding, block international calls, view your 

calling history and billing information and listen to voice mail. (NYTNS)

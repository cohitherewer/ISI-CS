 Buddha spikes mayor sop on water tax

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has made it clear that mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s rejection of the water tax proposal, under pressure from Mamata Banerjee, is but a temporary respite for middle-class house-owners.

 The chief minister asserted on Tuesday that residents of Calcutta, Salt Lake, Howrah and their adjacent areas will have to pay for their home supply of filtered water. 

 Which means that even the households connected with smaller ferrules ? 10 mm and 15 mm ? will come under the tax purview. Till now, only those households in the city shell out the tax that receive water through 20 mm and 25 mm ferrules.

 Bhattacharjee, however, did not clarify whether the water tax will be charged across the board or collected selectively, from house-owners whose annual property tax is above a certain cut-off mark. 

 The dispute over the issue started snowballing when the Trinamul-BJP civic board amended the rules and linked water tax with property tax, instead of consumption of filtered water. By the amendment, most house-owners in the city proper (from Shyambazar to Tollygunge) came under the tax purview, while their counterparts in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur were left out. 

 According to urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya: ?The nominal amount that will be charged will be spent on the upkeep of the infrastructure.? Bhattacharya?s comment came after the chief minister inaugurated the Rs 37-crore Bansdroni-Bidhanpally underground reservoir-cum-booster station. The project, an endeavour by the civic body and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), will benefit over 1.25 lakh residents of four wards.

 Though the project cost of the two-million-gallon pumping station was Rs 14.72 crore, the CMDA had to cough up almost double (Rs 27.79 crore) to lay the water mains and distribution lines in Behala. The civic body, too, had spent an additional Rs 8.70 crore to lay the distribution lines in Jadavpur.

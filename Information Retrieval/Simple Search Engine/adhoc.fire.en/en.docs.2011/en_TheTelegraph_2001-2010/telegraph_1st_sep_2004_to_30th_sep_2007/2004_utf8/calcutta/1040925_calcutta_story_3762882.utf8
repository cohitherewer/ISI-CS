The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Band with the best

Music Zone

Zeeshan Jawed finds out what it 

takes to gang up in harmony 

Western music came to Calcutta ? or rather Park Street 

? a long, long time ago. With performers like Usha Uthup (then Iyer), Louiz (then 

Louis) Banks, Biddu and Gary Lawyer performing at various hotels, the city was 

on song three decades ago. Then came a long lull, with the city all but robbed 

of its rhythm.

Some of that has changed with the advent ? and achievements 

? of Bangla bands. With the Chandrabindoos and Bhoomis rocking the college stage 

and the big auditoriums alike, picking up a guitar and getting the gang together 

for some song and dance seems the easiest thing to do. But before banding together 

make sure you have what it takes and you can take what it has in store.

Beat basics

There is a lot of sweat (and often blood) that goes 

into making a band. You must be clear and confident of what part you?re playing 

in the gig for you?ve got to be completely clued into music from all parts of 

the world. ?Pick up the nice things from all genres. You might be playing rock, 

but some knowledge of folk music will always come handy,? says Soumitro Ray of 

Bhoomi.

Words? worth

A boy-girl band is all about youth and exuberance. 

So, if you are not talking the language of the youth you might as well press the 

mute button. A well-written song is as important as a good tune. As a Bangla band, 

be the voice of the Bengali youth and talk about their joys and sorrows.

Dream on

?Though the foundation of Bhoomi was laid on a joke 

that somebody cracked, factors like lack of sensible music groups and the social 

conditions prompted us to form the band. The popularity of our music led us to 

put in more effort and now we are reaping the benefits,? says Soumitro. The financial 

rewards and the accolades aside, harbouring the dream of being on the horizon 

is a major driving force.

Gang up

Harmony should not be in the music alone, but also 

within the gang. It helps if you have known your band members for a while. If 

the group lacks coordination, it?s just a matter of time before it all comes unplugged. 

?We are a group of seven on stage, so a very high level of coordination is required 

between the hands and the vocalists,? says Biswa Mitra, lead vocalist of Dhumketu.

Practise hard

Getting a guitar is just the start. Practising hard 

is the mantra. But be prepared to face resistance. ?We would practise in one of 

our band member?s house in Hazra but the neighbours would often complain about 

the din we created. It?s different that they are the first ones to reach at our 

shows now,? recalls Biswa. 

Check the decibel level when you practise, Johnny-come-lately, 

?coz you?re sure to strike the wrong chord with your surroundings. So, it?s better 

to rent a place (after impressing the landlord with your sound, not noise).

Start sputter

Start out assuming that the start-up will be bumpy. 

Resistance from family, roadblock to stage shows and thorny path to first album 

are all part of the game. Wanna quit? Don?t play.

Stage clutter

The bottom rung is crowded but there is always space 

at the top. Every club or college might boast a band, but it requires ?heavy mettle? 

to belong to the big stage.

Cash colour

Just when you fear you will never see the colour of 

money can come that break. Once established, a band can command a good market 

price for stage shows. ?In Calcutta, we charge anything between Rs 45,000 and 

Rs 50,000 (including equipment and transportation cost). But if we go for shows 

to the US or the UK, where there are a considerable number of Bengalis, the amount 

almost doubles,? says Soumitro.

If you are an upcoming band, do not set your sights 

so high. ?With our own lights, sound and equipment we charge anything between 

Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 depending on the area and the organisers,? says Abhishek 

Saha of Dhumketu.

Besides stage performances, road shows are a lucrative 

option but it sure means a hard day?s night.

Glam grind

A beeline for the ticket counters, fans screaming 

hysterically and your songs being played in every nook and corner of Calcutta? 

If and when that happens, one thing you can be sure of ? the slog that has gone 

into that sweet sound of success is huge. ?This profession will give you anything 

but leisure time. There have been times when drops of sweat have trickled from 

my nose to my toes. And when I would look at my shoes I would realise how strenuous 

a job it is,? recalls Soumitro, who also admits that the applause and the accolades 

make him forget the fatigue. 

Boom dhoom

Puja time is boom time for Bangla bands. But generally, 

the period from September to February is the peak period. ?The festive season 

is a factor and moreover nobody wants to sit in a packed auditorium in the month 

of May,? says Biswa.

Stick around

That one song might give you wind beneath your viewless 

wings, but staying on top is tougher than getting there. Once you deliver a big 

hit, the only way up could be down. So, just keep strumming harder.

SOUND SCAM

After a debut with the eponymous set of rock anthems 

on love, Fossils is set to unleash the power of its anti-establishment 

second offering, pre-Puja.

 Musically, the sound of Fossils II is closer to contemporary hard rock than 

Fossils, with elements culled from diverse genres like alternative, blues, progressive, 

psychedelic, heavy metal and punk. We strongly oppose whatever is static 

and stagnant, observes singer-lyricist Rupam.

 And the angst flows freely through finely chopped rock riffs, from the rhythm-driven 

opening ballad Keno korle erokom to the vitriolic Acid and the funky Bicycle chor.

 Production house Asha Audio ensures international quality with 

recording and mixing at city-based Solaris and mastering done at Sterling Sounds, 

New York, by Steve Fallone. Fossils have their own sound, with a great hard 

rock feel, writes Fallone, who has mastered the likes of Eric Clapton and 

Norah Jones.

 Fossils: Rupam (vocals), Chandra (bass), Partha (guitar), Deep (guitar), Bubun 

(drums) and Parikshit (management).

Float along

 Shaggy of Oh Carolina and Boombastic fame will perform in New Delhi on October 

1 and in Mumbai on October 3. Sixteen lucky youngsters from Calcutta will get 

a chance to see Shaggy perform live. To get on board, one has to keep a tryst 

with the Romanov Shaggy float travelling to the hotspots in town. On Saturday, 

the float will be all over town, starting at Ultadanga at 1.20 pm and ending at 

Bosepukur at 7.30 pm, via Khanna Cinema, Sovabazar and Swabhumi.

 Mirror, mirror on the makeover wall

 The Pujas are over, long live the look of the Pujas. As the Devi is immersed and the holidays get over, some experiments with trendy truths are here to stay. The Goodlife decided not to let the festive fashion die a sudden death and, instead, scouted around some beauty spots where the look-good-feel-great spirit rules the Puja period and beyond.

 June Tomkyns

At this popular pit stop on Ballygunge Circular Road, 

the charge of the deck-up brigade began well before the Pujas. ?It was like a 

madhouse? This year was busier than the last few years. We have tried to accommodate 

the extra customers by keeping our salon open longer,? says owner Sharon Tomkyns. 

GenX was going in for everything ? streaking, hair extensions, nail art, application 

of crystals in the hair, blow-drying and ironing ? while the older gang was more 

caught up in make-up and sari draping towards the evenings.

 Solace

From a range of hair treatments, exotic facials, exfoliating 

scrubs to rejuvenating massage therapies, everything on the look-feel ladder seemed 

to be high in demand at Sunny Park last week. ?With Durga puja, we have most certainly 

doubled our usual sales. While on a normal basis it would be our members who use 

the spa utilities, at this time they bring along so many of their guests,? says 

manager Rutu Tawade.

 Habib?s

The response to the latest Habib?s hair and beauty 

salon, unveiled on Sashti at Short Street, has been ?tremendous?. The salon is 

focussed on hair styles and colouring techniques. The spirit of the season, proclaims 

Jawed Habib, is experimental and so refraining from the ?conventional route of 

using browns and golden?, and instead opting for a unique style statement was 

prescribed and practised.

Hair was definitely a big highlight this season. ?We 

have done extensive hair straightening and streaking this year. Blonde and mahogany 

streaks are what people keep asking for,? says Raman Bhardwaj.

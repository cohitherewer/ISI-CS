Wear a white ribbon and join the movement to stop 

violence against women? was the cry during the international campaign in Calcutta 

to stop violence against women and girls, from November 25 to December 10.

 The white ribbon signifies the pledge to never commit violence against women, not to remain silent when it happens and not to condone such acts. It?s time that the fairer sex stepped out of the shadows and stood up for its rights.

 Women are being brutalised in many ways. Behind closed doors, in the safety of their own homes, it?s often more shocking and tragic than on the roads. But first, women have to help themselves by speaking out.

 On November 25, the international day to stop violence against women at Shahid Minar, survivors of recent events spoke of how they were able to deal with and overcome the violence they faced. Women who lost their lives due to violence were also remembered. Celebrities like Aparna Sen offered support by lighting diyas in their memory. The common consent was that violence against women at home would not end till they stopped considering the husband their lord and master.

 On November 29, to raise awareness among students, an interactive film screening session was held at St Xavier?s College. The girls were joined in their cause by several guys sporting the white ribbon.

 The next day was a landmark in the campaign ? Bangladeshi students were in Calcutta, supporting the campaign. A programme had been organised by the NGO Swayam to spread the message of peace, justice and human rights, at Nazrul Manch. The star attraction was Bangla band Chandrabindoo.

 The programme kicked off with a skit on domestic violence. Though students from both the countries were supposed to perform, the Bangladeshis couldn?t take the stage because of some security issues. A second play on eve-teasing was presented. Next was a Bangla abritti with music. 

 The guys from Chandrabindoo felt such campaigns are going to be very effective to raise awareness, especially among men who are willing to support the cause of women and take responsibility to stop violence against women and girls.

 The Bangladeshi students felt that women today are able to at least think of doing things impossible even a few years ago. Such campaigns are allowing them to step out of their shells and speak up. However, they said the condition of women here is better than in Dhaka. But the basic problem in both countries remains the same ? innumerable acts of violence against women are committed everyday and only a small percentage is reported. So, much more has to be done to spread the awareness.

 Hence, reaching out to the grassroots level has been one of the main aims, through rallies, human chains etc, in busy areas like in front of cinema halls and metro stations.

 The final programme was held on December 10, Human Rights Day, at Shahid Minar, where a human-rights mela by students was organised.

 ?Let our voice be so loud that the voices of the wrong-doers get drowned in their own sins. Let the woman of the world find a world she has always dreamt of!?

Past perfect for future

 The event ?War and Peace (An evening in the past, an evening for future)?, organised by the Alumni Association, Calcutta Chapter, of Bharathidasan Institute of Management (BIM), Trichy, at Tollygunge Club on December 11, saw a host of speakers from corporate and academic backgrounds conjure images of their chosen events from history, deliberating on the nuances and lessons learnt from them for management practice today. 

 N. Jaysankaran, the former director and member of the board of governors, BIM, and vice chancellor of Kanchi University, inaugurated the event. To look to history for insights into the cultural and organisational climate, he set the stage for the speakers, emphasising BIM?s commitment towards a multi-disciplinary approach to management learning. 

 The speakers were invited to select events from history and draw management lessons from them. The battle of Kurukshetra was Sanjay Mukherjee?s choice. The professor from IIM Calcutta explored the myriad complexities and multiple forces in the battle, drawing parallels in the various facets of work in organisations. Citing the sparing of Arjuna?s death at Karna?s hands, owing to sunset, he spoke of principles in the context of everyday life and work.

 Chandan Das, head, HR, Research Engineers Ltd, said English is an integrating and a glorious remnant of the British rule in India. He brought out its role in shaping the managerial idiom today.

 Sujoy Banerjee, GM, HR, Eveready Industries, took everyone on a walk down memory lane, talking about his student-day impression of the Russian Revolution. He sought to uncover the lessons from communism that may engender more humane relationships in today?s workplace. 

 Greek mythology found mention in the elaborate treatment of the fall of Troy, by Kaushik Bhattacharya, associate partner, IBM Global Services. Through the Trojan War and the Achilles heel concept, he extended the idea for a need of skillful enquiry of weaknesses in a business. 

 The last speaker of the evening, Dipanker Banerjee, VP, HR, the ABP Group, befittingly touched upon the ?if onlys? of history to bring the evening to a close. From an engaging introduction of the origins of the words ?this requires action?, through the making of the atom bomb and the ?if only? of the steam engine, he recounted the various behind-the-scenes happenings during World War II to leave the audience wrestling with the ?if onlys?.

Verbal warfare

 The war of words began in July. The regional competitions of the LN Birla Debate were held in Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune. The topics varied from ?Pasta not Paratha is India?s new flavour?, ?India is shining?, ?All problems of existence arrive from disharmony? and ?Privatisation of education?, to ?Computer chips cannot feed the world?, ?India?s education system fails to educate?, ?A sound mind needs a sound body? and more. 

 On December 10, Calcutta witnessed the national finals of the 5th Inter Institutional LN Birla Debate. Sixteen students from around India fought it out. The participating institutions included Cathedral and John Connan High School and Jamnabai Narsee from Mumbai, Stella Mary?s College and PS Senior Secondary School from Chennai, Sri Aurobindo Memorial School and Mount Carmel College from Bangalore, St Stephens College and Delhi Public School from Delhi, Little Flower High School and Indian Institute Of Management and Commerce from Hyderabad, Pune?s Symbiosis Law College and Fergusson Junior College, Modi Institute of Education and Research and International College for girls from Jaipur and Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society and St Xavier?s Collegiate School from Calcutta. 

 The chief guest was Andrew Hall, deputy high commissioner, British Deputy High Commission. Suman K. Mukherjee, director, JD Birla Institute, conducted the debate as the chairperson. 

 The students argued on ?In the opinion of the house, television destroys the mind?.

 The supporters of the motion tried to portray the wide range of knowledge provided by TV, while the opposition spoke on the issues of pornography, and adult programmes, which adversely effects young minds. The speakers also touched on the topic of unwanted advertisements.

 One speaker pointed out that the choice lies in our hands. Generally speaking, even certain foods destroy our metabolism and certian forms of exercise, our body. We should be selective. TV, too, should be treated the same way. 

 In the college category, Ankit of St Stephen?s was declared the champ, followed by Bhawanipur College?s Rahul Chawla. In the school section, V. Sathyanarayan from PS Senior Secondary bagged the first position, with Vrinda Marwah from Delhi Public School in second place.

Sight amp; sound bites

December 2 was a memorable day, as we said farewell 

to our Irish friends. The two weeks came to a close. The programme started with 

the tilak session. Then was the lighting of the lamp. The speeches recollected 

the history of the student exchange programme over eight years. Three Irish students 

then performed ? one of them sang, another played the tim-whistle (a traditional 

Irish instrument) and the third played the baron. First on the Xaverians? list 

was Siddhant Chamola and Rishav Chowdhury, who sang Time of your life. 

Then was Chalte chalte, where Aakash Bhotika played the guitar and a few 

boys sang, followed by Purano shei diner kotha, sung by Sumon Chatterjee, 

Rohitasva Dutta and Rishabh Poddar, with me on the keyboard. Our headmaster, Rev 

Father Michael Fohshow, SJ, gave a speech and played the mouth organ. Baul 

gaan and a fireworks display later, it was dinner and goodbye.

December 17 was a day to rock at Calcutta University, 

College Street campus, for Diorama 2004, to jointly celebrate the freshers? welcome 

and the re-welcoming of the former MA journalism and mass communication students. 

The ad-making contest took place the previous day. On D-day, the makeshift stage-cum-ramp 

was set on fire by the freshers, from solo, duet and medley dances to short plays, 

recitations, and also a dumb charade contest involving even the ex-students. Everyone 

got into the ?flower power? theme. The noise was deafening as some of the freshers 

strutted their way to a stardom of sorts in Style Check. The suave Sudip emerged 

Mr Fresher 2004, while the ravishing Rashmi took the honours as Miss Fresher 2004.

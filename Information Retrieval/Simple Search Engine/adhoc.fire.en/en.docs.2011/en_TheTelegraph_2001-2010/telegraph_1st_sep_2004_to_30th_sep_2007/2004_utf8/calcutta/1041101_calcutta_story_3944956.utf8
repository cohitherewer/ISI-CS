 Recipe for entertainment

 Adding liberal helpings of mirth and laughter to an already robust festive spirit that has gripped the city, is Theatrecians latest production, The Real Inspector Hound. A thoroughly entertaining play by celebrated absurdist playwright Tom Stoppard, it is a comic travesty of the genre of the English Whodunnit. Set against the typical backdrop of suspense thrillers, it contains all the necessary trappings to provide a perfect setting for a spine-chilling murder mystery ? an isolated English manor house, two beautiful young ladies, a suspicious philanderer, a handicapped, jealous lover, terrible English weather and, to top it all, a mad murderer on the loose, ? only to topple these stock devices and turn them into the ingredients for a hearty comedy. Directed by Dhruv Mookerji, the play also explores within the frontiers of comedy the possibility and consequences of fiction spilling into reality.

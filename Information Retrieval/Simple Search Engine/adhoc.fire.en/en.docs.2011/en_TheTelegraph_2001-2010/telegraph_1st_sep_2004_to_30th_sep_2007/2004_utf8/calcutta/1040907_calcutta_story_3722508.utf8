 Star Spot

Amrita Panja

Sporty Scorpio...

Is this 19-year-old. She was not just house captain in Class XI 

in her former school, MP Birla Foundation, but also the champion of many a track 

and field event, from long jump to relay race. Amrita was a five-time awardee 

of the athletics class championships. Thats apart from the cluster of inter-school 

events she participated in and won accolades for. The Druk Track Fest and CBSE 

Inter-school Relay, to name a few, are among her trophy titles.

Dancing queen...

She is too, with training in Bharatanatyam, kathak, creative dance 

and most recently Odissi, from Dona Ganguly. The second-year English honours students 

first public performance at age five led to bigger and better things, including 

the best dancer award from Kala Sangam at an inter-school competition. She had 

to give up the hobby for her board exams, but now in Asutosh College, shes back 

in fine form.

Words and images...

Are her passion. The winner of the overall proficiency award in 

Class IX wants to be a scribe when she grows up. Essay competitions, freelancing 

for city newspapers, speaking during assembly and participating in impromptu speaking 

competitions she has been doing from a young age. Ditto for art contests. Amrita 

has won first and second prize in the Camel Colour Contest in the kids category. 

But while words remain her true love, art has taken a back seat. Creativity is 

her favourite pastime and future pursuit. Next, Amrita is gearing up for her debut 

in theatre with the NEO production Andrews 94, on September 10.

Rebel without a cause...

She is not, more like teachers and parents pet. Academics she 

is good at, too, with an 82 per cent in ICSE and 72 per cent in Class XII. But 

she does like to break the rules just a wee bit occasionally. A memorable moment 

was appearing on the television game show Haun maun khaun, on a 

private channel. So shes not really nervous about her first acting experience. 

Not that stage shy figures in her prolific vocabulary.

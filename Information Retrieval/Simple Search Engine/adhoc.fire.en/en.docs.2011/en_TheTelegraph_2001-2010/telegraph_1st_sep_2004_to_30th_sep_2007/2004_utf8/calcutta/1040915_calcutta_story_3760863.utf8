Aqua effect in green zone

Feng Shui Matters

Pinky Kapoor

Q:We live on the ground floor of a building 

that has an adjoining space for a garden. We recently moved in here from the first 

floor and want to do up the garden well. Can you provide some Feng Shui guidelines 

for doing so?

Mita Agarwal

The Solution: Feng Shui principles can be incorporated 

by applying the element theory. To start with, a small pond or a fountain can 

be set up in the north of the garden to enhance the auspicious energies related 

with business. As metal helps in producing water, something made of silver or 

copper should be placed in the pond. The southern side of the garden should have 

bright lights with statues of flying birds. Even barbecue arrangements can be 

done in this part while hosting parties. Metal swings can be introduced in the 

west for children. Wrought iron garden chairs with metal wind chimes and bells 

hanging from the trees in the north-west would activate heavenly energies. Introducing 

a rock garden with heavy boulders and stones can enhance the ruling big earth 

energy of the south-west. North-east, which is ruled by the small earth energy, 

should have small rocks, tiny pebbles and a stone lamp. The ruling big wood energy 

of the east should have tall trees whereas, small leafy plants, shrubs and seasonal 

flowers in the garden would help activate small wood and wealth energies of the 

south-east.

Q: I have a 10-year-old son who is unwell 

most of the time. Due to his deteriorating health conditions, his education is 

getting affected. Though he is under regular supervision of a good doctor, I would 

like you to suggest some ways that can help him enjoy better health.

can be further enhanced by placing some metal like silver or copper in the water

The Solution: The first step is to check his 

immediate surroundings. Please ensure that while sleeping or studying there are 

no sharp, pointed, angular or otherwise threatening objects. Draping soft cloth 

over them can soften such features. Make him sleep in a room that corresponds 

to his health direction, with his head pointing in the same direction. Facing 

his health direction while eating is also extremely beneficial. Make sure that 

he is not sleeping or studying under an exposed beam. Negative pictures or toys 

should not be displayed in the room. Young boys are usually fond of miniature 

guns, cannons and firearms. These are best hidden, or if displayed, they should 

not be pointing towards him and the bedroom door.

Q: We used to live in a joint family for 

several years and very recently we have separated, with demarcated areas in the 

house for each family. We have been given an area that forms an L-shape. The centre 

of the house also falls out of our possession. We are not happy with this arrangement, 

but we have no other option. Please suggest how the shape can be improved so that 

we get energy from all the directions.

Name withheld. 

The Solution: L-shaped homes are not considered 

auspicious, as firstly the letter ?? suggests loneliness, and secondly the residents 

lack the luck symbolised by the missing corners. If you are on the ground floor, 

try to construct the missing area. Alternatively, install a strong floodlight 

to fill up the void or place a mirror on the internal wall of the missing area 

to extend the house into the cut corner. If the above remedies are not possible, 

then demarcate the flat into two or more separate units and then individually 

divide them into nine sectors. This will give you four cardinal and four inter-cardinal 

directions along with a centre in each unit. Then enhance the eight aspirations 

of life by energising each direction of the house with their ruling and nourishing 

elements, colours and patterns.

Q: I recently bought a couple of stunning 

elephant statues made of metal and marble as someone had told me that they bring 

good luck. I would like to know the ideal placement and significance of the statues.

Amrita Katyal

The Solution: The elephant is regarded as one 

of the seven treasures of Buddhism. The Chinese consider it a royal animal symbolising 

power, caution and energy, and believe that personal wishes are granted when placed 

on its back. A pair of elephants brings immense luck when placed at the entrance. 

You could either place them in a way that they guard the entrance, or make them 

face the house so it seems they are walking into the house. If a silver box filled 

with coins or precious stones are placed on their backs, they become doubly auspicious 

and bring brilliant fortune. Earthen or metallic elephants are also believed to 

enhance luck for conception when placed in the west of a couple?s bedroom.

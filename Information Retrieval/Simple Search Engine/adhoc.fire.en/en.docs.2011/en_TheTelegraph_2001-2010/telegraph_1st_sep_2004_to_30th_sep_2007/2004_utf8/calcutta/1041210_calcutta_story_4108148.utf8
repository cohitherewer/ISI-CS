Ode 

to a Friend

 She was a friend. She favoured anonymity, but 

was amiable to me. I first met her in Class IX. She was sitting solitary, in the 

darkest corner of the classroom. At first I thought her to be a hypocrite. Maybe 

others abandoned her for the same reason. After knowing her, I realised that my 

first impression was wrong. 

Gusto gone

 She lacked gusto, but was genial. She lost 

her mother in Class VII and lived in joint family. Her father had a marriage of 

convenience with her aunt. She had to do the household chores look after her eight 

brothers and sisters. Her life was a misery under the influence of her conventional 

and over-possessive father. 

 She was not always so lackadaisical. Once upon 

a time, she had the gusto to make things happen. She loved life. That year, she 

failed in class. 

Lament loss

 She continued with her studies and passed out 

with 60 per cent in her ICSE exams. This thrilled me. My excitement evaporated 

when I received her marriage invitation. None of her friends but me attended the 

reception. We lamented our separation. I thought this was the end of our friendship. 

But no. On friendship day, she called.

 She told me that her husband was a nice man 

and he loved her. I was very happy. On a special occasion, she visited her maternal 

home. I went to see her. And found out that she had cancer. I can't put my feelings 

into words.

Sunset

 Life was like a turbulent sea. She did not 

lose hope, but her strength her faded. Doctors said she would survive for quite 

a few years, maybe she would recover. Whoever imagined that a small swelling in 

her leg could cause such a disease. 

 After the first chemotherapy session, she began 

to lose clumps of hair and her beauty vanished, giving her skin a coal-black hue. 

Some old friends and I celebrated her 18th birthday with pomp and show. A week 

later, she melted into thin air. Clouds had covered the sunshine.

Upasana Mallick, Class XII, St Thomas Church School, 

Howrah

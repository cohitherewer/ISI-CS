Screen On amp; Off

Ben Affleck

 Ever since Gigli happened to Ben Affleck, 

giggles have become synonymous with his name. Seldom has one film done so much 

to wipe out the smile of an actor as this Jennifer Lopez-starrer did.

 But we dont want to be harsh on the Hollywood hunk one Gigli, after all, should not unmake a career. And you can start September by going home to good ol Ben in the blockbuster Pearl Harbor, to be screened at 9 pm on Wednesday, STAR Movies.

 The Michael Bay film recreates the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour seen through the eyes of two boyhood friends serving as officers in the Army Air Corps. Ben plays Rafe, an energetic young pilot picked to fly with the British in Europe when America is still not at war. After Rafe is presumed killed, friend Danny comforts Rafes former lover, Evelyn, and the two draw closer. The dramatic twist in the tale, of course, is the return of Rafe.

 With his acting career not exactly going great guns, Ben wants to get back to screenwriting with old friend and partner Matt Damon. The two had earlier penned the Oscar-winning script for Good Will Hunting. One script the pair has been keen on is an adaptation of Dennis Lehanes novel Gone, Baby, Gone, about a detective duo in Boston investigating the kidnapping of a four-year-old girl. The duos friendship has fast become the stuff of pop-culture legend as it has inspired an off-Broadway hit recently, simply titled Matt amp; Ben.

Ben, meanwhile, has another film up his sleeve, Mike 

Mitchells Surviving Christmas. Slated for a November release, it finds 

him playing a rich record executive who has to spend Christmas alone after his 

girlfriend dumps him.

Jishu and Puja: Cosy twosome. Picture by Aranya Sen

 Know that girl in black cosying up to Jishu Sengupta? 

Shes the latest Tollywood import from Mumbai, Puja Bharti, whom you might catch 

a glimpse of in Anurag Basus Tumsa Nahin Dekha, starring Emraan Hashmi 

and Diya Mirza, slated to release on September 24. The lady also has two Telugu 

films under her belt and two more ready for release.

 Closer home, in director Anup Senguptas new Tollywood venture Rajababu, Puja is the epicentre of an emotional turmoil involving the two leading men in her tumultuous life, played by Jishu and Mithun Chakraborty. 

 The story goes thus: as armyman Jishu leaves for war leaving a pregnant unwed Puja behind, zamindar Mithun steps in to rescue the damsel from disgrace. But just when the couple has settled down and everybody thinks the strapping lieutenant is dead and gone, enter Jishu (Pearl Harbor in Patipukur?) to push the plot to its climax. 

 Its basically a two-hero film with lots of action and I have an almost parallel role along with Mithun, gushes Jishu. Also starring Tapas Pal, Dipankar De, Nayana Das and Dolon Roy, Rajababu will be shot in Mysore, Bangalore and Hyderabad.

Rugrats: One of the popular Nick shows

 Switch off the TV and go out to play. It wont be 

an angry mom saying this to her children on October 2, but, surprise surprise, 

a TV channel. 

 The kids channel formerly known as Nickelodeon will go media dark on that Saturday. Part of the Nick (thats what its called now) initiative Lets Just Play, its meant to encourage children to give outdoor sports a chance and not just be couch potatoes.

 Between 3 and 4 pm, the channel will suspend regular programming. Instead, a series of messages will urge children to go out. Harsha Bhogle will feature in some of the messages as our brand ambassador, says Pradeep Hejmadi, director, business amp; operations, Nickelodeon India.

 A kid contact programme organised by Nick is currently on in 450 schools across Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore. 

 We are going to the classrooms and inviting kids to play Tango Nick, a game developed by us which doesnt need any equipment, explains Hejmadi. On October 2, city winners from Tango Nick will get free passes to play at Nicco Park. Later, they will sign a pledge to play more outdoors.

But Nicks rivals at Cartoon Network have no plans 

to follow suit in this noble mission. It wouldve been great though if we could 

join hands and make it a complete play outside day, adds Hejmadi.

 Buoyed by the success of the first digital film festival held last year, British Council is fine-tuning plans to host its second. The six-daylong IInd Indo-British Digital Film Festival is slated to take off at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre on October 4 with around 280 digitally made short films from the UK, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and India.

 The five films that have made it to the screening list from 20 entries representing eastern India are Sanjeet Chowdhurys Interpersonality, Aveek Mukherjees Glich, Qaushiqs Le Pocha, Nilanjan Bhattacharyas The Dark Faces of Drowning and Abhijit Guptas The Third Schedule. 

 I make these short films on digital video mainly for myself to get away from the drudgery of ad films. This British Council festival gives me a platform to showcase my work, says ad film-maker Sanjeet Chowdhury. His festival film Interpersonality, which is all of nine minutes, revolves around a bank clerk who takes on the persona of a 21-year-old girl while chatting on the Internet.

 All the digital films, shown in the festival, are of short duration and plans are on to screen as many as 40 every day, said a British Council spokesperson. A seminar on the topic digital film-making is a hassle-free option is also on the cards with film-maker Subrata Sen (who made Nil Nirjane, the first official digital feature film in India) as one of the speakers.

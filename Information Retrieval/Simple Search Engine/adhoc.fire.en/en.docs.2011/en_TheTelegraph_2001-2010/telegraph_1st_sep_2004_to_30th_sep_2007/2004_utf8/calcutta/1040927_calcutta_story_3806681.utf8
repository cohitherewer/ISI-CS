 Flu bugs under scan

 Calcutta is among the five cities, chosen by the Indian Council for Medical Research, where scientists will work on unidentified strains of the influenza virus, a major worry for healthcare providers across the country.

 ?Influenza (flu) doesn?t have a cure. And what is worse, we?re coming across a new strain almost every year,? said virologist Leena Yeolekar, of the Pune-based National Institute of Virology. 

 ?The research programme is aimed at identifying the emerging strains,? she added.

 Apart from the city, the programme will get underway in Delhi, Chennai, Pune and Dibrugarh, ICMR officials said on Sunday. Tackling flu outbreaks has been a constant source of worry for healthcare providers in the five states. 

 In Calcutta, the multi-crore research project will be launched at the National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED). 

 Flu affects around 1.5 billion people across the world, causing more than five lakh deaths. In a city like Calcutta, an outbreak may affect at least 15 per cent of the population.

 Coinciding with the announcement of the research programme, Aventis Pasteur, a vaccine manufacturing company, launched on Sunday an anti-flu vaccine (Vaxigrip).

 ?The virus can affect all groups of people, but the most vulnerable are children and the elderly, as well as those suffering from diabetes, asthma and heart ailments. We hope the study in Calcutta will help us a lot in understanding the virus and prepare a better defence mechanism against the disease,? said Fredrick L. Reuben, Aventis director (scientific and medical affairs).

 According to city-based virologists who will be associated with the research, any new development will be routed to Atlanta, via National Institute of Virology, for further study. 

 The flu virus infects the respiratory tract (nose, throat and lungs) and the symptoms are often confused with that of common cold. 

 A contagious disease, influenza can also lead to various complications, such as dehydration, bacterial pneumonia and even heart failure. 

 ?Once the new strains are identified, we?ll suitably modify the vaccine. One must also know that it?s virtually impossible to control influenza when it is on the rise,? Reuben said.

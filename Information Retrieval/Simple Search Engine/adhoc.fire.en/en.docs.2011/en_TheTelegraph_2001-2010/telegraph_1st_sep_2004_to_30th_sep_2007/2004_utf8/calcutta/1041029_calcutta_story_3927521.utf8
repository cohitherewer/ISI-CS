More to love than animal attraction

Feng Shui

 Pinky Kapoor

 Dont fret if your life partners Chinese 

Zodiac animal clashes with your own. Sometimes the most unlikely animals can get 

along just fine. Like this tiger and piglet, who seem blissfully unaware of any 

differences (Reuters)

According to Chinese astrology, I am a wood Tiger and my fianc? is a metal Monkey. We are getting married in December. Our courtship is going well but are there any chances of clashes between us in future? These two animals are incompatible and metal is believed to destroy wood. How should we sleep as I belong to the east group and he belongs to the west group?

 Name and address withheld

The Solution: Chinese astrology is much more 

complex than the twelve animal signs. Your year, month, day and hour of birth 

comprise the Four Pillars of Destiny. And from these pillars we derive the elements 

present in the person?s birth chart. For the purpose of marriage compatibility, 

it is necessary that the elements of the two people should compliment each other. 

Since your dates of birth are not given, this can?t be determined. But if you 

are getting married soon, do not let it play on your mind and spoil a wonderful 

relationship. An interesting aspect of this combination is that the tiger and 

monkey are both adventurous by nature and love to explore and experience new situations 

in life. The tiger has the tendency to wander carelessly, whereas the monkey tries 

to protect him from dangers by anticipating ways to solve problems. The husband, 

or the breadwinner, gets priority according to Feng Shui, so usually, the wife 

has to sleep in a direction favourable to him.

 I am 22-year-old woman and have completed my graduation this year. I am interested in pursuing a postgraduate degree but I am not getting admission into any university. I don?t want to lose a year. Moreover my parents insist that I get married after completing my degree. How can I find a good match? My date of birth is 15.02.1982.

The Solution: Fill up your application forms 

facing west and then keep their photocopies with a note of affirmation in a white 

or a golden folder in the north-west of your study or bedroom. This will help 

you get admission. You are a strong earth person and wood element in your pillars 

represents your husband. Surround yourself with its associated colour green and 

wear a green coloured dress when you are supposed to meet your prospective life 

partner.

Lucky numbers

I have taken admission in a company secretaryship 

course this year. I would like to know whether this career will bring success. 

Which direction should I face while studying? How can I succeed in my personal 

relationships? I was born on 21.02.82. What is my lucky number, colour, birth 

element, animal sign and direction?

Sudha Agarwala

The Solution: According to your pillars of 

destiny, you are a strong wood person and need to be balanced with fire and earth 

elements and colours. Water being prominent in your chart suggests you should 

choose a career related with law, banking, finance and accounts. Kua numbers 

are your lucky numbers that also reveal your auspicious directions. Your lucky 

number is six and the directions are west for success, north-east for health, 

south-west for marriage and north-west for personal development respectively. 

Face west while studying and energise south-west for relationship.

Flushed out

My husband works from home and the door to his 

room faces the toilet door. Somebody suggested hanging a large pa kua mirror on 

the bathroom door. My husband does not like to work in his office. I am worried 

and concerned. What should we do? 

Anandita

The Solution: Pa kua mirrors are known 

to have an adverse effect when placed anywhere inside the house. If it is feasible, 

relocate the bathroom door altogether. Otherwise placing a round rug between the 

office and the toilet door will help the energy to flow into the office rather 

than getting drained in the bathroom. A wind chime hung between these two doors 

can also act as a barrier and saves the energy from being depleted. And remember, 

the simplest remedy is to keep the bathroom door closed at all times.

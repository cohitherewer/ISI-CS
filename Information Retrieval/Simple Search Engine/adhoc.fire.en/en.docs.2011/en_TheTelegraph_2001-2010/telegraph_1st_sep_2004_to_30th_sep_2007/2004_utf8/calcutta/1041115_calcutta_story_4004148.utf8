 Mishaps at immersion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mishaps marred the immersion of Kali idols on Sunday evening, leaving seven persons injured in a clash on the way to the ghat and an idol smashed in the second incident. 

 At Dum Dum?s Ghoshpara, members of the Daga Colony Shyama Puja Committee and Ghoshpara Club clashed after the latter stopped the immersion procession, demanding right of way in their own locality. Harsh words led to blows. A police contingent reached the spot at 7 pm to disperse the mob and restore order.

 In the other mishap, an idol fell off the truck taking it for immersion and was smashed on Eden Hospital Road, off College Street. The truck driver fled. Police had to fetch another driver for the immersion.

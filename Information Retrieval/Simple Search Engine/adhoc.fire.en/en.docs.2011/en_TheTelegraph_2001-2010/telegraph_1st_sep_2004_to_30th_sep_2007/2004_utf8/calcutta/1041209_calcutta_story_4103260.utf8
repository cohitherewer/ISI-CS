The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Breather amp; death breath

Diesel defiles city?s winter air

 If winter means drawing in a deep breath to feel refreshed, forget it. For, a breath of Calcutta air at this time of year is more foul than fresh.

 The winter air in Calcutta has officially been branded the most polluted among Indian metros, with the principal blame lying with the exhaust pipes of diesel-driven vehicles.

 As the mercury plummets and the smog thickens, there is no respite in sight for the country?s pollution capital during cooler climes, according to a World Bank-supported study.

 Calcutta was found to have the highest proportion of PM 2.5 (or, particulate matter equal or less than 2.5 microns in size) with the maximum pollutant potential to cause health hazards, including cancer.

 The report, titled Towards Cleaner Urban Air in South Asia: Tackling Transport Pollution, Understanding Sources, covers major south Asian cities including Calcutta, Mumbai and Delhi.

 It reveals that the average PM 2.5 concentration in Calcutta winters is 305 micron per cubic metre, with Delhi a distant second at 231 micron per cubic metre.

 Diesel vehicles have been identified as major culprits for the PM count, but the Bengal government, of course, has done nothing to curb the emission evil, first slamming the brakes on Bharat II and then going slow on the implementation of tailpipe emission norms.

 The study, undertaken as part of a joint UNDP and World Bank Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP), is the first detailed one on fine particulate matter sources in south Asia.

 It was conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology, National Physical Laboratory in Delhi, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mumbai and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in Calcutta.

 The NEERI regional office went to work between March and December 2002. 

 ?We collected 19 samples within the open area of our office in Kasba in a PM 2.5 filter sampler? Diesel emissions do appear to dominate,? explains Arun Kanti Biswas, scientist and regional office head.

 In other seasons, however, Calcutta?s pollution level is comparable to other cities. ?In summer, diesel contributes 61 per cent of the overall small particles while the figure drops to 43 per cent in autumn, 24 per cent in spring and 15 per cent in winter,? adds Biswas.

 Though the relative share of PM 2.5 from diesel sources is less in winter, in absolute numbers, it is almost double that of summer.

 In winter, stagnancy is created in the atmosphere, preventing normal dispersion of particles. 

 So coal, bio-mass and road dust particles are concentrated close to surface. Bio-mass pollutants originate from garbage and burning of cow dung, while coal particles are industrial emissions.

 An independent study by the state pollution control board (PCB) conducted in 2002 confirmed that PM 2.5 contributed about two-thirds of the city?s respirable particulate matter. This is disastrous, as these directly affect the lungs.

 According to experts, diesel emissions from vehicular sources contain more than 40 toxic compounds that can cause cancer.

 Alarmed at the figures, the state PCB is poised to put the pollution-health hazard link under the scanner.

 ?Introduction of alternative fuel is the only sustainable option. CNG should be introduced in Calcutta as soon as possible, and that can only happen on the state government?s initiative,? says Sunita Narain of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), which has been urging state environment minister Manab Mukherjee to take the Delhi route.

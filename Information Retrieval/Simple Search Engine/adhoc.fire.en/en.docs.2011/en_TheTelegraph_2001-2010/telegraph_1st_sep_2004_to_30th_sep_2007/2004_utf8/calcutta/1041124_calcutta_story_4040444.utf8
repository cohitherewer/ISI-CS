The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bandh, nap hold stars on the trot 

Snooze sets off chain of delay

 - Twin speedbreakers slow down return of Russian Circus animals

 The return of the Russian Circus to Calcutta, after almost two decades, has been slowed down by the twin speedbreakers of a localised Bharat bandh and cross-country travel.

 If one involved an arrest and its aftermath, the second has more to do with the sleeping habits of the animals on the move ? travel for one hour, snooze for four.

 As a result, the city has already lost out on four ? out of the scheduled 40 ? shows, with the Netaji Indoor stadium kick-off pushed back to November 28.

 The special air-conditioned trucks carrying the animals ? four sea lions (weighing a total of 940 kg), seven domestic cats, 13 Eskimo dogs and around 100 birds ? wouldn?t have made it on time even without a Vishwa Hindu Parishad bandh leaving them stranded near Raipur on Monday.

 That?s because the trucks? precious passengers were on the road for an hour and taking a nap for the next four. Sleeping on the move is a no-no.

 Said Russian state circus company technical director Popavov Dmitry: ?The birds are not the problem. But the big animals, like the dogs and lions, are very sensitive and find it difficult to acclimatise themselves to a new environment. Then they have problems with the water and food. If we can carry enough material, that?s fine but usually we run out and then it gets difficult.?

 During the journey, the team had run out of salmon fish stock, staple food of the sea lions, which had to be rushed from Calcutta.

 For the trip from Moscow to Mumbai, the animals boarded a special chartered Russian flight.

 ?As per rules, the Russian Aeroflot flight is not allowed to land here in Calcutta. We also tried other means but all the animals couldn?t be fitted on the same domestic flight from Mumbai to Calcutta. They are being attended by one doctor and two trainers and so cannot be transported separately,? explained Neha Prasad Yadav, director, Choice Events amp; Trade.

 Once in Calcutta, the animals will be kept in a special air-conditioned hangar at the Netaji Indoor stadium itself.

 The bandh hold-up between Mumbai and Calcutta has set the company bringing the Russian team to India and organising the shows in Calcutta, Mumbai and Delhi back by ?anything between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh?.

 The delay in transport has meant that the special ice stage is not in place. The preparations can only get underway once the ice-making machine arrives. 

 ?It?s an elaborate process to make the stage. First there has to be a layer of plywood. Then a layer of thermocol. Next, the water (a minimum of three gallons, without salt and iron) is poured on it and frozen by refrigerating it through tubes. The machine helps to keep the water frozen, irrespective of the outside temperature,? said one of the Russian engineers.

 The Russian Circus kicks off on Saturday, with the first show dedicated to physically-handicapped children.

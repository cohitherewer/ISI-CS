The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sorry, Mr Chief Minister, we women feel unsafe 

CM?s claim on Monday afternoon: ?I have always 

maintained that Bengal is safe in comparison to other places. She might have said 

certain things, but since she is a foreigner, I guess she doesn?t have much clue 

about this state.?

Citizen cry on Monday afternoon:?It could have 

happened to us.?

The day after the Navami night molestation of a 

Polish woman at Dover Terrace came to light, Metro commissioned MODE to check 

how safe women felt in chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s ?oasis of peace?.

Of the 150 women, in the age-group of 15 to 35 spoken 

to, 95 per cent said the October 22 incident could have happened to them. 

So much for the CM?s safe city. And his balm ? ?In 

this particular instance, I will personally see to it that the case is handled 

properly? ? seemed mere tokenism. For one, the Polish woman is said to have left 

for Rajasthan, leaving the cops clueless. And more importantly, what about those 

countless instances the CM does not ?personally? look into?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Top cop musters men into action

 A STAFF REPORTER

 DO IT NOW: Commissioner of Calcutta Police Prasun Mukherjee. A Telegraph picture

 No casual meetings, no courtesy calls and no lounging.

 A fortnight into his new shoes, Prasun Mukherjee, Calcutta?s new commissioner of police, is busy giving shape to his mantra: ?action?. 

 So, when artist Shuvaprasanna recently complained that he had been duped of Rs 20,000 ? by someone who had bought one of his paintings ? there was no dragging of feet. 

 The matter was passed on to the detective department through a joint commissioner and the officers swung into action immediately.

 On Friday, Shuvaprasanna told Metro: ?Police have been really fast and the money has been recovered. It was a great show on their part.? 

 Commissioner Mukherjee, however, is not willing to take any credit. ?It would have been the same with any other commissioner in the chair,? he asserted. 

 In the short time that he has been leading the force, Mukherjee has evolved an unwritten code of conduct to keep members on their toes and ensure that complaints are acted upon promptly.

 To start with, he has made it clear that he would not like officers calling on him just for courtesy. A few days ago, a team of four assistant commissioners, including one from the detective department, had turned up at Mukherjee?s office to meet him. 

 But they were turned away with the message: the commissioner will get back to them as and when required.

 On Tuesday, hours after taking over as officer-in-charge of Karaya police station, M.A. Saleh had gone to Lalbazar to meet Mukherjee. 

 After waiting for over an hour, he was told to return. ?The commissioner, as the police boss, is obviously a busy man. I was told he would get back to me,? Saleh recalled. 

 Not one to keep work pending, Mukherjee stays back in office much beyond duty hours. And he has made other senior officers follow suit. ?No one now dares to slip out before 9 pm. Even senior officers are staying back till the commissioner leaves,? said a detective department officer. 

 Those manning the corridors add that quite unlike his predecessors, Mukherjee often visits the rooms of his subordinates to keep tabs on the goings-on. 

 For the moment, Mukherjee would rather not talk about the changes he is bringing about. ?An unnecessary fuss is being made about the steps I am taking,? he said. ?Certain changes are necessary and I have been merely trying to put things in place. And my entire team is involved in this. Thankfully, things have started looking up,? he added.

 Elaborating on his mission, Mukherjee said he wants to instil a sense of trust among those who need to lodge a complaint with the police. ?There has been a lot of talk about good behaviour and community policing, but not much has changed,? he said. 

 In keeping with Mukherjee?s orders, the north-east end of the headquarters has been cleared of junk vehicles. The eastern gate of the complex, on Rabindra Sarani, will be opened after years for movement of forces. Besides, efforts are on to allow visitors to use this gate.

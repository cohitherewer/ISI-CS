 Infant melts hearts in jail

 - Undertrials fawn over baby of doctor murder case accused

 BARUN GHOSH 

 Even women accused of murder and other heinous crimes gave in to their motherly instincts when Piyali Das, one of the accused in the gynaecologist Susil Pal murder case, landed at Alipore?s Presidency jail on Monday evening with her 15-day-old son.

 Das, the woman whose baby Pal had allegedly refused to abort on July 2 at Bally?s Sebayatan nursing home, was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department on Monday, and subsequently sent to jail by the sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Howrah. 

 Minutes after Das and her baby were taken to the ward by two female warders, women undertrials jostled with each other to hold the baby. Some of them tended to the ailing Das, who had undergone a Caesarean section to give birth. 

 Officials said even Manjusha Mukherjee, who has kept herself confined to her cell ever since her 21-year-old son Sampad died inside the jail on Sunday, spent hours hugging and tending to the baby in an effort to get over her shock. 

 Sampad, his mother and brother were lodged in the jail in connection with the teenager Kuntal Sain murder case. 

 ?Nobody would say they were criminals when the women undertrials vied with each other to shower their affection on the baby. Some of them promised to buy him a new set of clothes,? said a jail official.

 Jail superintendent R. Hossain said Das and her baby had to be shifted to the jail hospital during the day to ?keep them out of the reach of other female inmates?. 

 ?We have 70 to 80 Bangladeshi children in the jail who are here with their mothers on the charge of illegally crossing the Indo-Bangla border. But Das? baby is only 15 days old, unlike the others, and has to be kept in segregation to avoid contact with other inmates,? he added.

 According to Hossain, a petition was moved during the day on Das? behalf, praying that the baby be handed over to her mother. ?It?s really difficult to keep a baby in a hospital where modern medical facilities are not readily available,? he added. 

But the baby has many well-wishers. Among them is 

Talat Sultana, widow of slain Forward Bloc MLA Ramzan Ali.

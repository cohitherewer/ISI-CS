 Cops inert over girl?s suicide note

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nearly 48 hours after Priyanka Das committed suicide by throwing herself in front of a running train, the police were yet to take any action.

 Contrary to the prompt police action in the Shibendu Saha case, in which they arrested Shibendu?s uncle and aunt on the basis of his suicide note, the cops of South 24-Parganas announced that they needed a ?written complaint? before taking any action against the accused geography teacher. 

 ?We are still waiting for a complaint to be lodged. Until that arrives, we cannot do a thing,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) on Friday.

 Family members of the schoolgirl sat for a meeting in the evening to decide what they would do next. ?Priyanka?s parents have been very ill all day. We can?t decide what to do,? said uncle Dhananjoy Mondol.

 Later, the family decided to lodge a complaint in a day or two. ?I will definitely file a complaint against the teacher because I don?t want any other child to die like this, persecuted at school,? said Priyanka?s father Pradip.

 When contacted, the teacher in-charge of the school said she would convene a managing committee meeting to discuss the ?delicate issue?. The accused teacher took regular classes on Friday.

 Tired of being ?singled out? in the prominent south Calcutta school by her geography teacher, Priyanka left her Bagha Jatin home around 6.30 pm on Wednesday and headed for the local railway station. 

 Around 11.30 pm, her family was informed by the police that her body had been found on the railway tracks.

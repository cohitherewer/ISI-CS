Chit Chat

Goooaaal!

The UEFA Euro 2004 tournament in Portugal may be over, 

but this latest instalment from the EA Sports stable lets you relive the action, 

and with you in control. With every new version of football, EA makes the game 

seem more and more real. Playing EURO 2004 almost feels like you?re watching the 

match on TV. The movements are smooth and the faces of Beckham, Figo and company 

appear incredibly lifelike.The controls are slightly tougher than before, with 

more moves and shooting options thrown in. You can control the swing and speed 

of the ball while taking a free-kick or corner. A few new feints have also been 

introduced. National anthems, crowd cheer and trophy celebrations add to the football 

fun. Kick away.

Heartsongs

He?s 15 years old, but a star. Billy Gilman has sold 

millions of records and won the Favourite New Country Artist at the Annual American 

Music Awards in 2001. His claim to fame is not just soulful lyrics and country 

music. The boy from Rhode Island has a cause ? singing for the victims of a fire 

in his home town or sharing his time and talents with children?s charities. He 

began singing at seven, and made his mark with the single One Voice when 

he was 11. Billy is also the youth chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. 

In his latest album (the fourth), Music Through Heartsongs: Songs Based on 

the Poems of Mattie J.T. Stepanek, Billy uses the words penned by Mattie, 

who wrote hundreds of poems in his short lifetime, and died fighting the disease 

earlier this year.

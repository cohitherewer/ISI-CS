The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It?s pitter, patter and pirouette

 - Parents and kids queue up for classical ballet lessons to be focused and fit

 Ballet, for Calcutta, has been all about magic memories conjured from far-off shores. Of the ethereal Swan Lake by the Bolshoi Ballet at Rabindra Sadan in 1984 or the dazzling show on ice by the USSR team at Netaji Indoor stadium in 1988? But now, if the eager feet queuing up for tickets can manage the triple turns and jumps, classical ballet can be of and by Calcutta.

 A small beginning with a big dream will be made on Friday. The Indian Ballet Academy is opening its doors with the aim of promoting the dance form and working towards a professional classical ballet company, the first of its kind in India.

 ?Ballet can be intimidating, as it is unknown here, as also because it is difficult. It is not easy to do 10-12 turns or be on point. But it can be made easier through yogic breathing techniques for warm-up. If you breathe well, you dance well,? explains Ash Mukherjee, the 25-year-old director-instructor of the academy, who passed out of London Studio Centre, where the ballet faculty is ?among the world?s best?. 

 Ash will be joined in April by American ballet dancer Christine Thorpe.

 Pointing out how ballet-based workouts are in vogue in the West, Ash says the dance form helps one focus, be musically aware and fit, giving adults, too, a reason to join. And parents there were aplenty at a demonstrative workshop on Sunday at the Indira cinema building, in Bhowanipore. While the children freely stretched on the floor, jumped and turned to the music of the Nutcracker Suite, the adults watched longingly.

 ?It is so beautiful that I want to join as well,? resolved Madhulika Dant of Alipore, who had brought seven-year-old daughter Ilisha for her first taste of the art. This means the ?monotonous aerobics regimen? being given a miss by Madhulika for the classical dance routine.

 For Sheetal Bagaria of New Alipore, the decision to enrol both son and daughter arises from a wish to go for the real thing. ?They pick up Bollywood dance anyway by watching TV. And what?s the use of teaching something that will fade tomorrow?? So, ballet.

 Beauty and fitness aside, does the dance form have a future? On both screen and stage, assures Ash, who trained with the team of Andrew Lloyd-Weber?s musical Bombay Dreams. Bollywood is using more western classical moves (think Aishwarya Rai?s ballet split in Taal) and there is a growing demand abroad for dancers adept at both forms in English films using the Bollywood look. If the demand lies westward, why choose Calcutta as a cradle for the classical form? ?Mumbai is too market-driven, Calcutta is open to variety for the sake of art,? argues Ash.

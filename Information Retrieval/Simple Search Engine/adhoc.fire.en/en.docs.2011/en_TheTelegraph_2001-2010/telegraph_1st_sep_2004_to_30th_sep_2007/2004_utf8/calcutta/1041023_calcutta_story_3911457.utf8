 The battlelines are drawn in Behala over a game of cards. Within a radius of three km, three pujas are happening this year with the same theme ? Dashabatar tash pot. 

 Behala has been the hotspring sprouting forth theme-based artistic wonders every year. But for as many as three puja organisers ? Debdaru Fatak Sarbojanin, Behala Club and Barisha Tapan Sangha ? to stumble upon the same uncommon idea in one year is too close and coincidental for comfort. With days to go before the Pujas, the mood at the three pandals had varied from resignation to an effort to keep some of the cards, at least the ace, close to the chest. Now the veil of secrecy has been lifted and with the pujas tied on the novelty factor, it is aesthetics that is playing the decider. 

 Dashabatar cards are a throwback to a forgotten game. Organisers at both Behala Club and Debdaru Fatak have dug some depth in search of its roots. According to Debdaru Fatak convenor Goutam Halder, who undertook his first journey to Manasatala village in Bishnupur in January after seeing a programme on TV, the game was imported from Orissa by Veer Hambir of Bishnupur, though it was also played in Rajasthan, Mysore, Maharashtra and Karnataka as Ganjifa. The pot was created in Bengal by Hambir?s general Kartik Foujdar. 

 The cards are circular, with the 10 hand-painted avatars of Lord Vishnu making up one side. A series comprises an avatar, his minister, and the figures one to 10. A full set is made up of 120 cards. 

 All three pujas landed up at the doors of families bearing the Foujdar name in Bishnupur. ?We met Bidyut Foujdar in June. His father Sudhir was a Rashtrapati Purashkar winner as a Dashabatar card artist. Now the sons have to run a cigarette shop to make a living,? says Uttam Bose of Tapan Sangha. 

 Theme-maker Amar Sarkar of Behala Club is happy that his creation is bringing a forgotten art to the limelight. 

 ?Even if the theme is the same, the pandals look different. So people would want to see all three,? reasons Bose.

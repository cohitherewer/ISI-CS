The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Quartet in art

 Any artistic endeavour is bound to be successful when the artist colours images of reality with his own aesthetic vision. The ongoing exhibition of paintings and drawings by four of the citys artists portrays a picture of life that is familiar yet fantastic, enabling viewers to discover beauty and sublimity in the most mundane facets of everyday life. Kalyan Chakraborty?s paintings explore modern concepts in ancient tradition to offer a fresh perspective on modernism as a product of our rich heritage. The world of Pradip Pradhan comprises objects and figures of eternal beauty that possess the power to transcend the ravages of time, thus bestowing on them a form and quality that is ethereal and divine. Pradip Sarkar?s paintings (picture above) are concerned with capturing and recreating the intensity of a particular moment; a moment that is apparently ordinary, but upon close observation proves to be a focal moment loaded with profound significance. Tapan Biswas? works invoke the supernatural forces of the universe, which he believes can deliver humankind from an all pervading darkness and evil, and lead them in their quest for eternity.

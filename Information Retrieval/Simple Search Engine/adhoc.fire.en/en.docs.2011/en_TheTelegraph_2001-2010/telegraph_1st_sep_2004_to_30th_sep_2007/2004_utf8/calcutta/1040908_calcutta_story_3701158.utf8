STRIKE A POSE

MODEL-TURNED-ACTRESS 

RESHMI GHOSH DRAWS UP A MUST-DO LIST FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO HIT THE RAMP 

IN EARNEST

 This 

is probably true of all fields first find out whether you are in the right profession 

or not. For a model, its very important to have the correct height and posture. 

I feel a minimum height of 5 ft 6 inches to 5 ft 7 inches is necessary. Below 

that is okay in India, but there wont be any chance of making it at the international 

level with that kind of height. 

 The second-most 

important thing is to keep fit. A good diet regimen would help. A lot of people 

think dieting means staying off food and going hungry, which is very silly. A 

model needs to eat healthy, drink lots of water and keep away from junk food. 

This keeps the body fit and the skin clear.

 Work 

out daily. Thats the best way to stay in shape. Going on a crash diet a couple 

of days before a shoot or a show is no good. A strict exercise regimen is a much 

healthier way to go about things.

 Sport 

the right attitude and be very comfortable with your body. Once you are on the 

ramp, you cant complain that a bulge or a shoulder is showing. Keep a check on 

every movement while walking. Theres nothing like good body language in this 

profession.

 A model 

needs to cultivate an aesthetic sense and understand what the designer wants from 

her. On the ramp, you are just a mannequin showing off a garment. But off it, 

too, you need to wear something that looks good on you that you can carry off 

really well.

 When 

a designer gives a model an outfit say some lingerie with maybe just a scarf 

 and asks for a very casual look, she needs to understand what she is required 

to do. This is vital, be it on stage, for a still photography shoot or before 

the moving camera. This comes with a lot of practise.

 Groom 

yourself by reading fashion magazines, watching fashion channels, updating yourself 

about what is happening around you. Learn by observing experienced models at work.

 Skincare 

is important, too. If your skin tone is dark, dont worry. Dusky skin is best 

for modelling. In fact, a dusky complexion helps Indian models to stand out at 

international pageants. Also, a lot of fair skin is toned down because that complexion 

doesnt always come out well on camera. Stick to natural skin treatments, because 

applying make-up all the time anyhow damages the skin in the long run. So, avoid 

chemicals for skincare as much as possible.

 Positive 

thinking stands one in good stead on the ramp. People may think that we just keep 

changing clothes and walking around, but let me clarify that its a very tough 

job. 

 Good 

sleep is essential to look good. I know many models have to handle late nights 

but it is important to strike a balance.

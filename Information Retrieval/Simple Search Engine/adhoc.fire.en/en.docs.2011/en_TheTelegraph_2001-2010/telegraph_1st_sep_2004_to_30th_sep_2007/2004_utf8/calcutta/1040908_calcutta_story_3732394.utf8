The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Adventure, exotica, action and Harrison Ford there are too many reasons why one cant get enough of Indiana Jones. The archaeologist-adventurer whose search for a sacred treasure leads him around the world is back on beam. Zee MGM brings the ever-popular trilogy on three consecutive Thursdays.

 Watch Indiana Jones battle bulldozers, tanks, motorcycles, ships, Pan Am clippers, a Nazi flying wing, snakes, spiders, booby traps, explosives, machine guns and machetes (phew!) in Raiders of The Lost Ark to get to the Ark of the Covenant on September 16 at 9 pm.

 Next week, he is off to rescue a damsel in distress and get entangled with the Chinese mafia in the Temple of Doom. On September 30, in The Last Crusade, he dives headlong into a series of traps to save the world from the Nazis who have kidnapped his father (Sean Connery, no less) for his diary containing maps and first-hand accounts of the Holy Grail.

 The Indiana Jones saga germinated from a discussion in May 1977 between George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, a week before Star Wars was released. Three years later, on June 23, 1980, Spielberg began directing the film at La Rochelle, France. And 24 years later, we are awaiting the fourth movie in the series.

 Reports quote John Rhys-Davies (Sallah in two of the Indiana Jones movies and Gimli in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) confirming that Indiana Jones co-writer and producer George Lucas had shelved the project earlier in the year as he had reservations about the script. So Indiana Jones 4 has been pushed back at least a year. Till then, we must satisfy ourselves by revisiting Indiana Jones three previous appearances, at home (provided the RPG Netcom vs Zee-Turner storm blows over). 

Gwyneth Paltrow: Royal connection

 A New York family with plenty of problems to spice up life and a reunion that brings with it drama and comedy. Not a new concept, perhaps, but the three children are all geniuses, who achieved fame and fortune as youngsters but lost the golden touch after their father left home. Now hes back to try and make up for his mistakes, when the family reunites after one member announces a terminal illness.

 But what makes The Royal Tenenbaums a truly special movie is the all-star Oscar-winning or nominated cast led by Gene Hackman as the loony patriarch (Royal) and Angelica Houston as the mother who held things together (Etheline).

 Gwyneth Paltrows deadpan character Margot is contrasted by Ben Stillers craziness as Chas, and they are joined by the Wilson brothers Luke (Richie Tenenbaum) and Owen, Danny Glover and more, as the wonderfully dysfunctional family is adeptly brought to life by the actors. 

 Catch the capers of the Tenenbaum family on Star Movies on Wednesday at 10.45 pm.

 And theres more in store for Paltrow fans. The sci-fi action flick Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, also starring Jude Law and Angelina Jolie, is gearing up for a September release in the US and will be headed here soon. This was the film the Shakespeare in Love lady made while she was pregnant with daughter Apple. Her next project is Every Word is True, a biopic of author Truman Capote, for which the cameras start rolling in January 2005.

 The Royal Tenenbaums had a selective big-screen release in 2001, so dont miss the TV premiere. A guaranteed laugh, with plenty of witty moments. A sample Margot tells her erstwhile father, You probably dont even know my middle name, to which he replies: Is that a trick question?

 Monet Mazur: Biker babe 

 They did gyrate throughout but both Esha Deol and 

Rimii Sen never attempted to jump on to those mean machines driven by the Uday 

Chopras and John Abraham in Dhoom. No sweat, theres Monet Mazur to do 

the needful. Well, she is the sexy biker babe in the other road film running in 

the city Torque.

 Before showing off her oil-stained legs in her bike shop in the film, Mazur has also upped the glam quotient of other high profile films like Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Angel Eyes and Just Married. Torque, though, is her first real biggie.

 And more than anything else, the super bikes made Mazur sign the film. The dangerous element is what has always attracted Mazur to the fast road rulers. Predictably, it wasnt all smooth sailing at the shoot. Mazur dropped the really heavy bike on her foot and sprained her toe. 

 More than the pain, it was embarrassment that the model-turned-actress struggled to cope with. The one scene that Mazur is most excited about in the film is the fight sequence between her and Jaime Pressly on their motorcycles charging at each other and a whole lot of kicking and punching.

 Apart from Torque, Mazur has a couple of other films in the pipeline. Theres In Memory of My Father about the son of a legendary Hollywood producer who accepts a bribe from his father to document his death. And theres also the Jennifer Lopez film Monster-in-law alongside Michael Vartan and Jane Fonda.

 Guess who is MTVs Apna Artist of The Month for September? Surprise, surprise its Kishore Kumar. Thats not just a testimony to the enduring appeal of the legend but also to his huge fan following among youngsters.

 If remix is the best form of flattery today, the scores of albums featuring Kishore classics to techno beat flooding the market say it all. But the one we are talking about here is good ol rewind, not remix.

 MTVs tribute to the singer-actor has a peg: his 75th birth anniversary. Lined up all month-long on the popular music channel are Kishore Da Special, featuring the funniest movie scenes and song clips with words from todays stars on the legend to boot; Kishore Express, a non-stop, half-hour ride with Kishore hits, and MTV Select Festival that finds the current crop like Abhijeet and Babul Supriyo paying tribute to their guru.

 So, all you Kishore fans, start humming.

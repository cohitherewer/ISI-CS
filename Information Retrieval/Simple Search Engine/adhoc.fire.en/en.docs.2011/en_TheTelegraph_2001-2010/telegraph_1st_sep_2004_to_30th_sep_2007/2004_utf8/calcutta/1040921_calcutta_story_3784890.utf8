The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Busy in inner chamber

Subha (Mudgal) has created sheer magic. It?s the kind 

of music that will play on people?s minds for a long time, especially the title 

track,? claims Debojyoti Misra about the musical score of Rituparno Ghosh?s Raincoat 

. He has made A. Hariharan and Subha Mudgal sing his five lilting background 

tunes set to Hindi lyrics penned by the director himself. 

 Over the past decade or so, this 40-year-old music composer has created the signature tunes of some Bengali TV channels, the title tracks of several mega-serials, the soundtrack for around 1,500 ads and a couple of stage productions, plus nine of Rituparno Ghosh?s films and a few by Swapan Saha and Haranath Chakraborty.

 Chokher Bali has been, by far, his most challenging project in terms of both technique and concept. ?For instance, the short thumri at the end of the film, which was meant to create a special moment. After starting off the thumri the conventional way, I blurred out the tabla, then the sarengi and the tanpura, and slowly introduced the cello, viola and contrabass? And we have dealt with Rabindrasangeet in a very interesting manner too,? explains Misra, also a trained violinist.

 For years, he would play the instrument with ?guru? Salil Chowdhury on stage. Yet, the most memorable of his violin days was being part of the orchestra for Satyajit Ray?s Ghare Bairey.

 ?He (Ray) had worked out a very different, unheard of interpretation of E ki labanye purno prano with the orchestra, and that stayed with me? even when I used this song in Chokher Bali,? reveals the Mera Pyar Shalimar man, who ventured into feature films with Moloy Bhattacharya?s Kahini.

 ?I work with a lot of forms and western classical music is always present,? he says, having first plucked at the strings of a sarod at age five and later trained in Hindusthani classical music under Pandit Bhimsen Joshi.

 And what are the other projects he is satisfied with? ?Dahan, where I have achieved a lot in terms of orchestration. Also Patalghar, one of my most experimental works? And yes, a couple of tracks for Florian Gallenberger?s Shadows of Time.?

 Misra has just finished recording an ad jingle for Asian Paints with Subha Mudgal and is now busy with Abhishek Bachchan?s Bhojpuri track in Antarmahal.

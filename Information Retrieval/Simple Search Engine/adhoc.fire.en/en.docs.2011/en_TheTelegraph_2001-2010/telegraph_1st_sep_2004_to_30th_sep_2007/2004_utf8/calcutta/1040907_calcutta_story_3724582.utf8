 Local telly turf tussle treads Street Legal

 - Clamour for cartoon, telefilm amp; market watch grows as cable conflict hots up

 The big-screen version of Scooby Doo, whos missing in action in lakhs of drawing rooms

 The battle over the BCCI cricket rights witnessed a lull in Chennai on Monday, but the tussle over local telly turf took an ugly twist. It steered the cable conflict towards court and pushed back the return of Cartoon Network and the rest of the Zee-Turner channels to around six lakh households.

 Zee-Turner, which had switched off its bouquet on the network of multi-system operator (MSO) RPG Netcom, served a legal notice on Monday, naming leading officials of the company. Refusing to link the move to Zees acquisition of the lucrative domestic cricket rights contract, Siddharth Jain, COO, Zee-Turner said: It is routine procedure that the company needed to follow.

 Caught in the crossfire, once more, are deprived viewers, led by the legion of little ones. Kids, confirm cable operators and parents, have been the worst affected by the Zee blackout, having to go without their favourite fare on Cartoon Network and Pogo. My son (two-and-a-half) is hooked to Scooby Doo. Its impossible to manage him without Cartoon Network, cried a young working mother, after a bribe of chocolates failed to do the trick.

 After kid channels, there is also pressure on the last-mile operator for the return of regional channels. The serials and telefilms on Alpha Bangla are next in the popularity pull, followed by market movements, Monday to Friday, on CNBC.

 The channels offered as replacement by RPG Netcom have hardly managed to fill the void. Splash, a kids channel from down South, has proved a poor substitute, while filling in the rest of the blanks are CMM (for steamy music videos), Channel News Asia, Bloomberg (global business news) and CCC (a 24-hour movie channel caught in time warp).

 Off-screen, Zee-Turner has slapped the legal notice to recover the bounced cheque amount of Rs 1.7 crore from RPG Netcom. We will deal with the matter through our lawyers and comply with the directives, said Amit Nag, CEO, RPG Netcom.

 Officials of Netcom, distributor of STAR and Sony, did not rule out the possibility of the bouquets going off SitiCable on Tuesday.

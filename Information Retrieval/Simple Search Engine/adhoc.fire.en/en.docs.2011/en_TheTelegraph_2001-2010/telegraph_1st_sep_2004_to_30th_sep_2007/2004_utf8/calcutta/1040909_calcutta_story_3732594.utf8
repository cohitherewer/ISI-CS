 Cop idles in god?s name

 - Widow wounded by in-laws sent away from police station

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Wounded widow: Amake bachaan, sir. Apnara chhara amar keu nei (Save me, sir, I have no one else to turn to).

 Callous cop: Arrey, jar keu nei, tar oporwala achhe (Those who have no one, have God).

 On the midnight of August 31, Parijat Bibi, a 38-year-old widow and resident of Barasat, turned to her local police station for help. Bearing multiple injuries, allegedly inflicted by her in-laws, she broke down before an officer, later identified as A.K. Hazra.

 Parijat Bibi?s pleas drew nothing more than a casual remark and a routine entry (No. 170/04, 31-07-2004) in the general diary from a representative of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s ?people-friendly? force.

 Going by the book, Hazra should have taken Bibi to Barasat hospital, a five-minute drive from the police station, for a medical examination and a certificate that would later serve as the basis for police investigation into Parijat Bibi?s complaint. Instead, the policeman on duty chose to leave everything to ?oporwala?.

 ?I do not recollect having said any such insensitive thing to anyone who came here seeking help, especially not a woman,? said Hazra, when asked later about the incident. ?As a policeman, it is my duty to extend help to people in distress,? he asserted.

 Chandrashekhar Das, inspector-in-charge of Barasat police station, was even more nonchalant: ?This police station registers, on an average, 3,500 general diary entries a month. It is next to impossible for me to look into every entry.?

 Some of Parijat Bibi?s neighbours, who had accompanied her to the police station, later admitted her to Barasat hospital, where she is still undergoing treatment.

 Hafiz, the victim?s nephew, said Parijat Bibi had been living out a nightmare for the past several years, ever since her husband died. 

 ?They (her in-laws) want to drive her out of home. Two complaints were lodged with Barasat police station. Police picked up Parijat Bibi?s main tormentor, brother-in-law Rahim Baks, alias Khude, but he came back the next day and started torturing her again,? alleged Hafiz.

 According to Hafiz, the widow had been hit repeatedly in the face, head and abdomen.

 On condition of anonymity, a senior police officer said: ?The woman is in hospital for nine days, proving how serious her injuries were? The officer should have taken her to hospital and on the basis of the medical report, lodged an FIR.?

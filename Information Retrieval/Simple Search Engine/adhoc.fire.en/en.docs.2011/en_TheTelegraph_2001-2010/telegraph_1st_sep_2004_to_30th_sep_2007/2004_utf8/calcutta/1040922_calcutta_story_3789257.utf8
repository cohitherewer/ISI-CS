The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rising from the fall

Anurag Basu needs a break. Not from his hectic promotional 

schedules of Tumsa Nahin Dekha (Dia Mirza doing a Marilyn Monroe above). 

But from those who are making him relive his traumatic days in the cancer ward. 

?I don?t want to talk about it. It makes me weak,? he told the horde of journos 

when he came to Calcutta.

 Basu, who spent his childhood in Calcutta, just wanted to be involved with film-making. ?I have grown up in rehearsal rooms with both my parents into theatre. I did a lot of production work but never assisted any major director. The big break came with Tara ? I directed close to 200 episodes.?

 Serials became his daily cereal, as Basu directed one telly thriller after another ? from Saturday Suspense to X Zone. Finally Basu became a member of Balaji?s K-family. ?I had a good association with Ektaa Kapoor and I became the creative head of serials like Kasautii Zindagii Kay, Kumkum, Kyunki Saas? I supervised the screenplay and the final product.?

 But when Basu entered filmdom on Balaji wings, problems cropped up. ?Kucch To Hai was my first film and I had given my heart and soul to it. But Ektaa was changing the story and even the killer after every schedule. I realised that the mutual trust between us had gone. I didn?t even have the courage to see the film but learnt that they have given my name in the credits. Na dileyi bhalo hoto.?

 At such a stage, Basu thought his career was over. ?I returned to television with Karishma. Mahesh Bhatt, with whom I had worked briefly for a telly show, called up and asked me to direct Saaya for him. While reading the script, I liked it ? I didn?t know it was a copy of Dragonfly. Anyway, I had to do the film. The Bhatts signed me on for two more films when Saaya was just two schedules old.?

 Murder, however, changed all equations. ?It was a do-or-die film for me and also for the Bhatts with their last three films Inteha, Footpath and Saaya being washouts. More than the flesh factor, I think it was the sincerity in the performances that worked.?

 Tumsa Nahin Dekha is no Murder, though. ?It was like batting on a different wicket. The timing of my leukaemia detection was very wrong. The music was already out and the release couldn?t be delayed. Bhatt saab had to complete the film. After I returned to the post-production room from hospital, I wasn?t completely convinced seeing the rushes. Two people cannot paint the same painting. But those who have seen the complete film have loved it.?

 Basu protests the label of a hero slapped on him. ?Anyone in my place would have done the same. If you know you are dying, the will power comes from within.?

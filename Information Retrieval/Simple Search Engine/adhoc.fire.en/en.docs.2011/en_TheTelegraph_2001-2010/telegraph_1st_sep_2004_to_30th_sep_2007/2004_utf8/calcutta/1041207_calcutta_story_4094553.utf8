The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bouquet blackout beyond borders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The battle of the sports channels has spilled over beyond Bengal. Even as ESPN and STAR Sports continue to remain frustratingly out of reach for around 80 per cent of city cable homes for almost three weeks now, the two channels have done a disappearing act in parts of Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Ludhiana, Pune and Kerala.

 ESPN STAR Sports switched off beam on Hathway Cable and Asianet over the weekend, alleging dues to the tune of Rs 7 crore from Hathway and Rs 2.5 crore from Asianet. ?We had to either take this decision or allow them to carry on without making payments,? offered Sricharan Iyengar, VP sales amp; marketing, ESPN STAR Sports.

 ?It?s yet another arm-twisting tactic from ESPN STAR Sports,? complained Milind Karnik, president (finance) of the Rajan Raheja group-owned Hathway Cable, from Delhi. 

 ?The amount is around half of what ESPN STAR Sports is claiming. They have billed us for areas where we have not taken their service. Besides, we are not receiving proper payments from the ground due to reasons like increased service tax, and sought time from the sports channel for clearing the dues,? Karnik added.

 Indian Cable Net, formerly RPG Netcom, was quick to point out that such a blackout was just waiting to happen. ?ESPN STAR Sports had been continuously leveraging content to carry out hikes and revamps,? said a spokesperson of Calcutta?s biggest multi-system operator (MSO). 

 ?Now that Team India cricket has been divided among all sports channel, they are finding it hard to follow the same strategy,? he added.

 In the aftermath of the BCCI telecast rights saga, that?s one of the hurdles the sports broadcaster has to cross. ?Unfortunately, some MSOs think they should pay only because of cricket featuring India,? said Iyengar. 

 Lack of that, despite beaming soccer, tennis and hockey action, has ensured minimum pressure from operators and viewers during a switchoff. 

 ?But the viewer should not be deprived of content he is paying for,? said Iyengar.

Theatre - Adaptations

Kashinama

 Set in the backdrop of Varanasi, Kashinama is a poignant tale of the battle for survival between fanaticism and culture. The protagonist is the temple city that has long suffered in the name of religion. The challenging production with a cast of over 40 actors addresses the apparent dissimilarities between globalisation and its propagation by cultural pundits. Rangakarmee?s stage adaptation of a story by Hindi author Kashinath Singh promises to raise some pertinent existential questions.

 Catch it at Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre, at 6.30 pm on Sunday 

 Godor Pratikshay

 Two tramps, Vladimir and Estragon, wait by a tree for a certain Mr Godot to arrive. They quarrel, make up, contemplate suicide, try to sleep, eat a carrot and gnaw on some chicken bones. Two other characters appear, a master and a slave, who perform a grotesque scene in the middle of the play. 

 Dream Theatre?s take on Samuel Beckett?s Waiting for Godot is a development on the title of the play? a tale about anticipation and alienation. 

 Catch it at Muktangan on Thursday at 6.30 pm

 Steel style on table top

SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

You don?t need to have nerves of steel anymore to 

flaunt your priceless crockery when friends come visiting with kids in tow. Stainless-steel 

crockery combining the sturdiness of metal and the elegance of china is catching 

hungry eyes at dinner tables now.

If retro is rocking everything from music to fashion, 

kitchenware can hardly be left behind. Brands like Art d?Inox and Magpie have 

launched lines of stainless steel table accessories (picture left by Rashbehari 

Das) ? taking in crockery, coasters, vases, photo frames, bar sets, dinner sets, 

bathroom sets, paper weights, business card holders, candle-stands, buckets and 

even dustbins.

 The trendy pieces are polished and packaged well with chic matte finishes and sophisticated shapes. The burnished steel comes in outlines as varied and abstract as can be. 

Flower-shaped saucers paired with slim cups, pieces 

of bent steel passing for bottle openers, flower vases in beaker shapes ? the 

twisted forms and designs difficult to define bring a touch of class to the table.

Also, combining durability with style, some of the 

items come in combo packs like a steel saucer with a ceramic cup, coffee mugs 

with a glass body and steel handle and so on. The articles score simply on the 

novelty factor if nothing else.

 Some of the restaurants like Grain of Salt and Ragaa have been using matte finish steel crockery and accessories since their inception, complementing the no-frills, sophisticated interiors. 

 For the home, too, the articles are possibly best brought out at a formal do. Team them to optimum advantage with contemporary wrought iron furniture. 

 More rowdy events like a pyjama party or a bachelor bash could also do with their sturdy presence.

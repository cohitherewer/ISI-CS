The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Winter weaves

IPSITA DEB

Two 

designer tags powered the wooden tiles at 1 Allenby on Friday evening, showcasing 

their latest fall-winter collections at the eponymous address. 

 The show kicked off with the Silk Route collection by Calcutta designer Usha Bagri. Delicate motifs and vibrant colours dominated her collection of bridal outfits and Indo-western ensembles in silk, tussar and dupions. Solid colours like emerald, orange, red, aqua blue and magenta highlighted the simple yet eye-catching embellishments of embroidery, beads and sequins. 

 ?The line has been compiled after extensive research, in which customer preferences reign supreme,? said Usha.

Batua-style bags and totes designed by Usha, 

and those imported by her from Thailand and Malaysia are up for grabs to team 

with the outfits.

 Next on the ramp was Delhi-based designer Nandini Baruah?s collection titled Reflections, which was ?all about celebrating the multi-faceted 20th century woman, who is outgoing, charismatic, yet serene?. 

 Different lengths of crumpled skirts, with a chic bohemian look, teamed with intricately embroidered blouses, formed the major part of Nandini?s collection. 

 The designer relies heavily on rich silks from Assam in muted earthy and pastel shades. The no-nonsense silhouettes are emphasised with texturised fabrics flaunting a good fall.

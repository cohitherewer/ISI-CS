 With the information technology (IT) industry in the state showing signs of steady growth, neighbouring Bangladesh has started looking up at Bengal with great interest.

 From seeking space in the state?s software technology parks to emulating the success story beyond borders, Bangladesh Computer Samiti (BCS), the apex body of the country?s IT industry, is looking at various options to gain from Bengal?s growth run.

 ?Due to our geographical proximity to Bengal, we think we can benefit a lot from the state?s experience,? said S.M. Iqbal, president of the 18-year-old organisation. 

 Iqbal led a 30-member contingent from Bangladesh that took part in Infocom 2004, organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication. 

 Besides taking part in the conference, the team also had its presence at the exhibition venue, where the it networked with local players and explored business opportunities. 

 ?The trip has been really beneficial, and we would like to come back next year with a bigger team,? added Iqbal. 

 According to him, Bangladesh has around 3,000 small and medium IT companies, which employ around 500,000 people. 

 The 51 universities in the country churn out around 3,500 IT graduates every year, and Iqbal said the association is trying to improve both the quality and quantity of IT professionals. 

 Though most of the companies deal in hardware, some of the bigger ones have already switched to software development. 

 ?Our export volume is around $5 million and we think we have the potential to grow faster,? added Iqbal, who called on state IT minister Manab Mukherjee during his stay in Calcutta and urged him to allot land to Bangladeshi companies in the Salt Lake Electronics Complex and Rajarhat. 

 ?Some of the companies are willing to start operations in Calcutta. If we get the permission, it will be a win-win situation for both countries. The minister promised us that he would consider the case of Bangladeshi companies without prejudice,? said Iqbal. 

 Besides joining hands with the Bengal government, the association is also trying to tie up with Nasscom and roll out joint programmes in Bangladesh. 

 ?Every year, we organise a BCS Computer Show, the biggest IT expo in our country. We want to scale it up further with help from Indian corporations and associations like Nasscom,? signed off Iqbal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Dreams come true of touching the sky

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 Nine-year-old Mahvas Parvez had not been able to sleep a wink on Tuesday night. 

 Class IV student Dipak Hela went crazy with excitement at getting a wee bit closer to his dream of becoming a pilot. 

 Sumit Roy, 16, wondered if this was his chance to meet his Rani Mukherjee on board, like Saif Ali Khan in Hum Tum.

 And with Wednesday morning came the big moment. For 100 under-privileged children from various schools, it was a total Flight of Fancy, aboard a Sahara aircraft, for a 45-minute ride, organised by the Rotary Club of Calcutta as part of the Rotary centenary celebrations. 

 ?Through this programme, sponsored by Sahara, we wish to touch the lives of at least 100 children for whom a plane ride might forever have remained a dream,? explained Vikram Somany, club president.

 And it was with true soaring spirits that the children arrived at the domestic terminal of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport. 

 Shama Parveen, student of Maulana Azad College, stood with a group of 18 from the Garden Reach slum development organisation. ?I can?t believe I?ll really fly in a plane,? she gushed. 

 ?I will probably never be able to do this later,? observed Abu Bashar, Class VII student, fiddling with his boarding pass and wondering whether he would be able to sit next to his best friend on the flight.

 Checking in at the lounge and travelling up the escalator done, the children did not seem to mind the delay in journey, while the elders waited for mayor Subrata Mukherjee to arrive. ?Doesn?t matter if we have to wait,? said young Samar Adhikary, gazing out into the runway and a waiting aircraft through the dark glass of the boarding lounge.

 Chakraberia High School students Arghya Ghosh and Prasenjit Chakroborty pointed out their friend Mintu Saha as the only one who ?could sleep at all last night?. 

 ?But that was only between 2.30 am and 4 am,? protested Mintu. 

 Kanta Soni, teacher of Jyotirmai Vidyamandir explained: ?They have been on cloud nine ever since this excursion was announced ? talking about what will happen over and over again.?

 With the arrival of the mayor, things started moving swiftly. Stepping into the plane, being welcomed by ?uncles and aunties? of Sahara, settling into the seats, toying with the seatbelts took up quite some time. 

 As cakes, biscuits, water bottles and attractive gift packets were distributed, the plane nosed towards the runway. 

 Eyes went wide in wonder as the cabin crew went over the safety procedure, prompting everybody to bend over, search for the life jackets mentioned by the ?Sahara uncle? and wonder whatever the lights and switches above the seats meant.

 This, however, gave way to squeals of delight as the aircraft gathered speed and lifted off the ground. 

 ?Ekhan thekey amar bari dekhtey pabo (Can I see my house from here)?... Didi, planeta cholchhey to (Is the plane really moving)?... Bairey geley ki meghgulo amader bhijiye debey (Will the clouds drench us if we step out)??

 Curiosity and thrill ran faster and higher than the aircraft. With the weather playing truant, visibility was poor. While younger ones like Puja Kumari of Jyotirmai Vidyamandir were a trifle upset at not being able to see much outside, for older kids like Sunita Oraon of Infant Jesus or fashion designing students Ishrat and Shisham of Aapne Aap, ?it was like floating in heaven?.

 While the cabin crew tried to keep the children still, the captain?s booming voice pointed out the Hooghly as the plane followed its course, the Haldia port and the Bangladesh border to the left. 

 Eager faces peeped out, amazed at the green carpet and the wide, brown, meandering Hooghly. 

 And before the magic 45 minutes drew to a close, Rizwana Parveen and Shaheena Rahman, from Loreto, had already made friends with Shahina Khatun of Garden Reach. Little Dipak Hela comforted his new-found friend Santosh, who felt sick during the plane?s landing. 

 As the kids walked out through the lounge, waving goodbye to the flight crew, mayor ?uncle? and Rotarians, every face had a smile. And every heart a dream, after having really touched the sky.

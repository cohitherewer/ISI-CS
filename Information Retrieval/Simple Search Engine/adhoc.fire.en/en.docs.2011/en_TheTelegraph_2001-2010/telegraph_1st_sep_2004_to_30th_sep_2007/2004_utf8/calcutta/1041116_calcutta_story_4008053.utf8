The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hospital ferry fee too high 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Private ambulance services are thriving in the Behala area at the expense of the two ambulances, supposed to be run by the Behala municipality, that have been lying inoperative for months. 

 Fed up with having to opt for the more expensive private ambulance services, residents of the area, led by the Behala Jukta Sangram Committee, have threatened to start a movement if the municipality ambulances are not repaired and made ready for use within a fortnight. 

 Mohit Mondal, on behalf of the committee, said most Behala residents belong to the lower middle class and cannot afford to shell out the extra cash to hire an ambulance.

 ?In the event of a medical emergency, the victim?s relatives are forced to pay a neat Rs 500 to hire a private ambulance. It is an exorbitant sum for most residents of Behala,? he said. 

 ?It is unfortunate that the authorities have paid no heed to our plight. Consequently, we are forced to pay nearly 10 times more every time an ambulance is required,? Mondal added. 

 An official of Behala municipality said the civic body has two ambulances. One of them was condemned a long time ago, and the second one has been inoperative for more than three months. The crew of the two ambulances, including their drivers and mechanics, are sitting idle. 

 ?I have repeatedly written to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s health department, but they have not taken any steps to sort out the problem,? said Anjan Das, chairman of Borough XIV. ?I had asked for the condemned vehicle to be replaced and the damaged one to be repaired immediately, but in vain,? he added.

 According to Das, the ambulances run by Behala municipality used to be available for about Rs 50 to carry a patient from home to hospital. 

 Poor people could avail of the facility free after obtaining a certificate from the local councillor. 

 ?I am unaware of the situation. I have not received any file or memorandum from my officers about this,? said mayor-in-council member in charge of health Pradeep Ghosh.

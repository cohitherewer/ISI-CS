 Magic moments framed in his master?s steps

 One morning in 1970 Uday Shankar asked his disciple Shanti Bose to do a few steps with him on the verandah of his Golf Club Road residence and got brother-in-law Bishu to click them. ?He must have foreseen something,? muses Bose, pointing at a black and white photograph on the wall of Gaganendra Pradarshashala. A bouquet of 147 pictures of the maestro was displayed in celebration of 50 years of Bose?s career, which includes two decades as a ballet master in Shankar?s troupe.

 If his master took a course in painting before turning to dance, Bose started life as a body-builder. An acquaintance took him to IPTA. Four years later in 1958, he enrolled in the Academy of Dance, Drama and Music where Shankar was the dean. On passing out, with a kathakali specialisation, he joined Shankar. 

 In 1961, Bose debuted in a ballet based on Tagore?s Samanya Kshati. After a 45-day run at Mahajati Sadan, the production left for Delhi. ?It was staged at Ifax Hall, with Pandit Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Radhakrishnan in the audience.? But more than the audience, Bose remembers the eight-hour rehearsals that Shankar put them through for weeks together. ?He took us to his Madras home so that there would be no distractions,? the 68-year-old recalls.

 The next year, when the troupe toured the US and Europe with a repertoire including Samanya Kshati, Astrapuja and Great Renunciation, Bose went along as the youngest in the group. ?Only Ananda and Mamo (Mamata Shankar) were younger,? he laughs.

 By 1966, when work started on Prakriti-Ananda, based on Tagore?s Chandalika, Shankar had enough faith on his student to use some of his compositions. Bose loves the way the production would start. ?It was as if we were in rehearsal, seated in a semi-circle on stage, dressed in casuals.? The characters would enter on cue; gradually the costumes would change to take the look of a staged project.

 Another of Bose?s favourite projects is Shankarscope, the multimedia show that Shankar had conceived, years before such a thing could be visualised in India. ?Dada was much ahead of his time. He was the first to use strobe lights here. Part of Shankarscope took place on-screen while the live dance happened on the stage below. A magic moment was when an actor would walk out through a flap on the screen and down the adjacent stairs to the stage. In the last scene, the screen came down to the stage level and women walked out from behind it.?

 Bose?s proudest memory is of Shankar training him for the role of Kartikeya and handing over his own costume. ?On the 1968 tour, he did Indra and I Kartikeya,? says the man who was hailed as ?Shankar?s heir apparent? by Houston Post that year. 

 He recalls how little Mamo would dance away backstage to the music whenever the troupe performed. As if on cue, Mamata Shankar walks in at the exhibition. Stopping before a striking picture of her parents, she pleads: ?Amake ekta copy debe Shantimama?? Bose?s collection (only half was exhibited) is priceless, but without help, he is fighting a lone battle to preserve them.

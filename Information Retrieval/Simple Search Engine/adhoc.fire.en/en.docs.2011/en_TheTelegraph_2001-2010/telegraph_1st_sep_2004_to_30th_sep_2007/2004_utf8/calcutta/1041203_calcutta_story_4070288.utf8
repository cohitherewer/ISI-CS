 Festival fare from far and near

 A moment from Teater Pero?s Tongue-tied, to be staged at the Nandikar theatre festival

 When words sound trite, actions shout out loud. Such is the case with Tongue-tied, the Swedish production scheduled to lift the curtains on the 21st National Theatre Festival hosted by Nandikar, later this month.

 The Stockholm-based Teater Pero will, in all probability, leave viewers tongue-tied with its minimal use of speech and a performative approach under veteran Peter Engkvist?s direction, feels Rudraprasad Sengupta, at the helm of the festival fiesta.

 The 10-day annual gala begins at the Academy of Fine Arts on December 16 with a bouquet of 19 plays and a film. Trundling into town with a variety of plays are troupes from Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Pondicherry, Assam and Manipur. 

 The other foreign flavour of the festival is likely to be another Teater Pero production, Orjan, also directed by Engkvist.

 The spotlight, this season, is on children?s theatre. ?Doing theatre over the years, I felt it was necessary for it to be related to various segments of society. So we began working with children in urban and suburban schools, slums, streets and also with the blind,? says Nandikar director Rudraprasad, who feels ?not enough? stage work has been done with children.

 The festival is hosting eight plays in this vein, starting with Tongue-tied. Among the others are Ganapati, an English play emphasising rhythm, by Adishakti from Pondicherry. Director Veenapani Chawla is known for her experimental work, confirms Rudraprasad.

 Two other productions have come about through collaborations spearheaded by Nandikar. Joray Joray involves children from seven schools in Budge Budge, while eight institutions in Uttarpara have participated in Swapna Muhurte. Yet another act will be put up by Laban Hrad Vidyapith, under the guidance of stage actor Debshankar Halder. 

 Two of Leela Majumdar?s short stories ? Adharmoni and Dulia ? adapted on stage by Nandikar are also on the programme list. While the first comprises the troupe?s young trainees, the other fields Sohini Sengupta Halder in the lead. 

 Barda, based on a Munshi Premchand story and directed by Goutam Halder, is the third Nandikar entry.

 The other significant city-based children?s production is Ramaprasad Banik?s Ekla Pagol, which Rudraprasad finds ?extraordinary?.

 A separate section in the festival has been earmarked for Manipur. In view of the recent atrocities in the hilly state, Manipur Day reflects on some of the issues through stagecraft, film screening and talks.

 Friday the 24th features Soldier in Sarong, a film by Lokendra Arambam of theatre troupe Forum for Laboratory in Imphal, before Kalakshetra takes the stage with Draupadi. Directed by H. Kanhailal with veteran actress Sabitri Meisnam in the lead, the play remains a must watch for its bold timbre and modern-day take on the mythological character.

 Habib Tanvir returns to the Calcutta stage with a mix of old and new plays. Alongside favourites Charandas Chor and Kamdev Ka Apna Basant Ritu Ka Sapna (an adaptation of Shakespeare?s A Midsummer Night?s Dream), the Bhopal-based Naya Theatre brings in its brand new Zahreeli Hawa, dwelling on a communal wave troubling the country.

 Natrang, the Jammu-based theatre group that had been assaulted on board Himgiri Express while travelling to the city for this festival last year, will be back. Under Balwant Thakur?s direction, it stages the Hindi play Aap Hamare Hain Kaun?. 

 This apart, Purbaranga from Guwahati adds a different flavour with its Sanksrit act Sri Ram Vijoy. Udaipur-based Ajj Rangmandal will roll on with Mahamayi.

 ?As we get to see local theatre all year round, the Nandikar festival aims to bring quality productions from outside Bengal,? explains Rudraprasad.

 The stage fare is likely to be complemented with an exhibition on children. ?We have been conducting a survey of schoolchildren on the cultural and social influences they live under. Questionnaires have been sent to various schools across town, the results of which will form the basis of the exhibition,? says Rudraprasad, adding that the study will throw up some interesting finds.

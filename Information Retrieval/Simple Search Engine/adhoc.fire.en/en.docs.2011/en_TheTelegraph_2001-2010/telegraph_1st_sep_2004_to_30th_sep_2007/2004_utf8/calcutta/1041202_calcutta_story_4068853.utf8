Minuscule, but by masters

 Gallery Katayun, at 4A, Auckland Square, has reopened with a small but beautiful collection of exhibits by old and new masters. 

 Most of the works are tiny, with the exception of one Nirode Mazumdar, one Ganesh Haloi watercolour and another by Gopal Ghosh. Some of the exhibits are minuscule. There is a set of eight drawings by Jamini Roy, one about the size of a thumbnail. These are small jottings that he blows up in his paintings. 

 Familiar motifs like the bauls, the rows of dancers in languorous poses, the dholak, the cows with soulful eyes and the goddess on a mount appear in infinitesimally smaller forms, sketched with either pen-and-ink or pencil. The master must have executed them in a few seconds? time. There are two early Jamini Roys, besides. This is a period when his work was heavily influenced by the Post-Impressionists. The colouration is very similar to that of his European counterparts.

 There is one remarkable Nirode Mazumdar, a work inspired by a patua whom the artist used to know. In shades of grey, black, an Indian myth comes alive through the eyes of a modernist painter. The undulating, graceful lines of a pata look fractured after undergoing severe stress. Where patas are exuberant, Mazumdar?s gaze is cold and analytical.

 There are two splendid works by Gopal Ghosh. He evokes breakers with a few strokes of watercolour. There is another exquisite study of shrubbery against an orange background, done with pastels. The colours look surprisingly fresh, as if they had been applied yesterday.

 An etching by Geiv Patel interestingly focuses on the head of a dead politician, like a photograph taken before his bier is taken out in procession. Nestled amid flowers, his black moustache accentuates his lugubrious grimace.

 Ganesh Haloi?s two watercolours are in dark shades of green, amber and grey. His compositions have the severity of geometrical designs, yet he can make nature alive. His works are spare, yet they have a richness he has achieved after working for years, rarely shifting his gaze, yet discovering a new way of expressing himself each time he does so.

 There are contributions by Shyamal Dutta Roy, Sunil Das, Prakash Karmakar and Paresh Maity, too. Maity recreates an image ? that of a langur ? which, years ago, had launched his career as a successful artist.

Fear factor rules Halloween fest

Plan a Party

Give your guests some goose pimples, suggests 

Zeeshan Jawed

DO

 Make a jack-o-lantern and bake a pumpkin pie 

 Find a wacky costume to spook your friends

DON'T

 Forget about safety: kids can have accidents in restrictive 

clothes, no matter how cute

Bollywood fright flicks may not be doing too well 

at the box office, but that hardly means audiences don?t like a good scream. And 

with Halloween just around the corner on October 31, make your next party a spine-chiller. 

The holiday has become associated with bizarre costumes and candy, the perfect 

ingredients for a rocking bash. Here is how you can pull it off at home.

Hang it

Witches, warlocks, pumpkins, Dracula and spooks are 

just a few images that come to mind when you think about Halloween. You can throw 

in some black cats, bats and spiders for an added scream. The most celebrated 

Halloween decoration however, is the jack--lantern ? a hollowed-out pumpkin carved 

to resemble a grotesque face and eerily illuminated by a candle inside. Remember, 

orange and black are the colours that click on this spooky day.

Incognito

Dressing up in costumes is one of the most popular 

traditions of Halloween, the freakier the better. Costumes usually include witches, 

ghosts and other supernatural elements, but the popular trend is to take a cue 

from contemporary culture. Imitate superheroes with Spider-man, Batman, Superman 

and Catwoman garb and gear. Children might prefer to go as Harry Potter (AFP 

picture above). Doc Ock, the Green Goblin or Voldemort are good choices if evil 

is what appeals. Don?t forget to invite your pet friends and get them dressed 

up too (AFP picture, below), whether they like it or not.

Spooky tunes

Avoid the regular hip-hop music and opt for some spooky 

tracks instead. ?Songs from movies like Ghostbusters are sure to give your 

guests some goose pimples. You can also play Black Gangsters Den and Tark Trums 

or soundtracks from Hitchcock movies,? says DJ Girish. Phantom of the Opera 

has a happily haunting note as well. If you want to give a more 3D effect, 

some scare on screen could be called for. Opt for creepy flicks. Again, Alfred 

Hitchcock is the universal favourite. If movies do not scare you much either, 

do a Darna Mana Hai. Sit around a bonfire, or light candles and have a 

story-telling session.

Fright night

Amongst all the fun and frolic, there are certain 

safety measures you may want to keep in mind. If you are inviting kids to the 

bash, do keep a vigil as costumes and candy usually are a chaotic combination. 

Also make sure that their gear does not include any hazardous implements or protrusions. 

Instead of masks, non-toxic face paint might be a safer option. If a mask is unavoidable, 

ensure that proper holes are made for unobstructed vision and breathing.

Dig in

Food must include as much candy and chocolate as possible. 

Trick-or-treating is an integral part of Halloween, but unless you get the whole 

neighbourhood mobilised, that is not really feasible. So do what you can to pamper 

your own sweet tooth. Have some fake vampire lips and stick-jaws for sure. With 

all the leftover pumpkin from the lanterns, bake a pumpkin pie.

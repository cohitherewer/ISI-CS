 Cops do the force proud

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Brickbats in the city, laurels elsewhere. That?s what, it seems, has always been in store for Calcutta Police. 

 Two sub-inspectors of the 1996 batch of the city police returned on Wednesday from Dergaon, Assam, after winning seven medals, including two gold, at the four-day All-India Police Duty Meet. 

 The duo ? Soumya Thakur from Beniapukur police station and Suborno Dutta Chowdhury from Phoolbagan police station ? and Prosenjit Bishnu of the state police rounded up the three top honours in the focal event relating to forensic science and investigation. 

 ?The performance of our men proves once again that Calcutta Police has a name in the circuit of the law-enforcement agencies in the country,? said a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters.

 ?It was a great opportunity to take part in a national-level competition and, for this, I am grateful to my superiors,? said Thakur, who bagged three medals.

 He won the gold medal in a written test on forensic science, while colleague Dutta Chowdhury took the silver. Bishnu stood first in the medico-legal event, with Dutta Chowdhury emerging the first runner-up.

 ?This particular batch is now considered to be among our force?s most efficient men. These young officers have saved the day for Calcutta Police on several occasions earlier,? said another senior officer at the police headquarters.

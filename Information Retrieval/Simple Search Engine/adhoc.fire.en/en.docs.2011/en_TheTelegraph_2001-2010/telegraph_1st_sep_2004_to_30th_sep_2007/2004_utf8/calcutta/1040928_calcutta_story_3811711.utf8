 Powerless and on a prayer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jitendra Nath Sinha has only prayers to fall back on.

 His 24-day-old nephew awaits a neurological surgery on the second floor of BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children under Dr M.K. Bhattacharya, and if power trips again at night, Sinha says he would just crumble.

 And so will many others from the hospital?s administration. The state?s only referral hospital for children has no system in place to ensure uninterrupted power supply.

 Worse still, both the CESC and the public works department wing in the hospital are at a loss.

 ?Almost all the major state-run hospitals, including SSKM, have a second point of power supply, with each supply having a duplicate feed. But BC Roy is an exception. There is no back-up and the hospital authorities have never approached us for this,? claims D.N. Majumder, CESC executive director (distribution).

 The hospital authorities plead helplessness. ?A year-and-a-half ago, we had sent a proposal to the state finance department seeking clearance for generator sets. But that was turned down,? says M.K. Chatterjee, BC Roy hospital superintendent.

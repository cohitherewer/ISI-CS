 Cops on collision course over haul 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A tussle between Calcutta and Patna police is on the cards. A report is being prepared by the city police on how a detective team from Calcutta was kept confined in a police station in Patna for several hours. 

 City police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty, who was informed about the incident on Thursday, will take up the matter with the home ministry.

 The seven cops from the detective department, including two officers, reached Patna on Tuesday to arrest a gang of cell phone burglars. 

 According to police, the gang had looted four cell phone shops in the city. It is also accused of committing burglaries in Delhi, Mumbai and Allahabad. ?We had information that the gang was from Rajmahal, Bihar, and the stolen phones were being sold from a shop in the Srikrishnapuri police station area,? said an officer of the detective department?s burglary wing.

 The detectives arrested three of the accused ? Ahmed Hussain, Waker Alam and Amit Gupta ? in Rajmahal, before raiding the shop in Srikrishnapuri. ?Owner Amogh Chaurasia was caught red handed. We had recovered 28 cell phones that were stolen in Calcutta,? said the officer.

 Around 3 pm on Tuesday, the team reached Srikrishnapuri police station with Chaurasia. 

 ?Officer-in-charge K.K. Singh?s conversation with Chaurasia proved that he used to take bribes from the shop owner,? said another officer of the detective department.

 The OC allegedly asked the team to hand over half the recovered phones. ?Singh said he would claim that Srikrishnapuri police had recovered 14 cell phones during a raid. But we did not agree,? the city sleuth added. 

 The team was then allegedly detained in Singh?s room under his instructions. The sleuths contacted deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Peeyush Pandey, who immediately called up S.S. Singh, superintendent of police (Patna). 

 ?The Patna police chief assured Pandey that he would look into the matter. But the situation in Srikrishnapuri did not change one bit,? said a senior officer at Lalbazar.

 ?We were detained in Singh?s room till 12.30 am on Thursday. Policemen stood guard so that we could not leave with the cell phones, which were in Singh?s drawer. By midnight, we were exhausted and had no option but to hand over half of the recovered cell phones,? said a member of the the team.

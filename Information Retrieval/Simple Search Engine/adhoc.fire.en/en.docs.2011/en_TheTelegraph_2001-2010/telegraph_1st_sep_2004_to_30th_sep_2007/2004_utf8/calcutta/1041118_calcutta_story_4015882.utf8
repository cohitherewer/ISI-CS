 Rerun in cell store break-in

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Robbers from Jharkhand seem particularly interested in cleaning out city showrooms of mobile phones. 

 Barely three days after a burglary at a cell phone shop on Raja Rammohun Sarani, a gang broke into a mobile phone showroom at 1A, Nandan Bagan Street, in the Burtola police station area, on Tuesday night, and escaped with phone sets and cash worth around Rs 2 lakh. 

 Police suspect the involvement of a gang from Rajmahal, in Jharkhand, that is generally after new cell phones that fetch handsome returns beyond Bengal borders. 

 The detectives said the gang entered the shop by shifting the asbestos sheets on the roof and walked away with several cell phones and Rs 43,000 in cash.

 ?It appears that the robbery was planned well in advance. Going by the style of operation, it seems to be the Bihar-based gang,? said the officer-in-charge of Burtola police station. This is the fourth robbery of its kind in the city in recent times. A week back, a cell phone shop on Jatindra Mohan Avenue was looted. 

 Not long before that, there was a break-in at Capital Electronics on Chowringhee.

 Ticket trouble at twin stations

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Passengers at Sealdah and Howrah railway stations faced a trying time on Tuesday as the computerised unreserved ticketing system (UTS) at both places shut down for nearly one-and-a-half hours. 

 The problem, which Eastern Railway officials said was due to a Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) link failure, continued from 11.25 am to 12.40 pm.

 ?At Sealdah, tickets could not be issued from 19 UTS counters at the main as well as south sections. At Howrah, 26 UTS counters failed to function,? an Eastern Railway (ER) spokesperson said.

 At Sealdah, 11 self-printing ticketing machine (SPTM) counters at Prafulla Dwar, adjacent to platform 1, which were not converted into UTS counters, functioned normally. Tickets were issued from these counters and five others ? four at the north and one at the south sections. 

 Two manually-printed ticketing counters were made functional during the crisis period. 

 At Howrah, 32 SPTM counters were opened to tackle the crisis. Twelve were used for issuing local tickets and 20 for long-distance unreserved tickets, an official said. 

 ?The computerised passenger reservation system counters functioned normally,? the spokesperson added.

 BSNL officials said they were not aware of any such link failure. ?The railway authorities have not informed us about the incident,? said S.K. Bhaduri, general manager, customer services, Calcutta Telephones. 

 But ER officials claimed that a complaint had been lodged with BSNL. ?The complaint was received officially,? a railway official asserted.

 ?We were stuck at the station for quite some time before railway authorities asked us to sign on a blank paper and board the train,? said Nirmal Maity, who took a train to Tarakeswar from Howrah. 

 Swapan Santra could not attend office due to the crisis. ?I was standing in the queue to buy a ticket. Suddenly, the counter was shut and we were told by the railway employees that tickets would not be issued,? Santra stated. 

 Angry passengers were told of the link failure by the railway officials. Announcements were made through public address system, requesting passengers to purchase tickets from SPTM counters. The passengers, however, blamed the authorities for their plight.

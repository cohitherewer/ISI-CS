The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Methods of the movie madness

 Marilyn Monroe and (top) a still from Star 

Wars 

 From Cleopatra to Star Wars, from Marilyn Monroe to Elizabeth Taylor, Kevin Burns has captured every Hollywood phenomenon on camera. Viewed through the seasoned eyes of the man who has worked in every big US studio ? from 20th Century Fox to Foxstar ? his documentaries have not only taken us into the makings of several big-screen blockbusters but have also exposed the unknown tales of many a celluloid legend. Now, with the first ever DVD release of the Star Wars Trilogy by Lucasfilms, which includes a special disc of Kevin?s documentary Star Wars: Empire of Dreams, the man?s craft is back under the spotlight.

 In a telephonic chat with Metro from the US, Kevin turned nostalgic at the very mention of Star Wars. ?When the first Star Wars film came out, I was 22 and going to film school in Boston. It was such a rage that the anticipation for the sequels Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi was huge. Then George Lucas came up with this new Star Wars trilogy. Those who have loved the original trilogy of the 60s don?t like the new films. Again the younger generation does not find the old films exciting. When the third episode of the new trilogy comes out next year, the two families will be complete and the debate on which trilogy is better will be more justified.?

 For Kevin, though, more than the films it is the people associated with the film-making process that provide food for his thought. ?What interests me most is the human story. The personal struggles, the plights of movie stars, the obstacles and difficulties they go through? I find them very intriguing. For example, in my documentary on the making of Star Wars, I am not interested in the loads of special effects used in the film; I focus on how George Lucas accomplished it and how it changed his life and the lives of others around him.?

BURNING 

IT UP

 Kevin Burns is a champion of the making of... films having done 

Beyond Titanic, Behind the Planet of the Apes, and his latest Star Wars: Empire 

of Dreams

 Through his documentaries, Burns has been able to dig out many unknown facts 

and secrets about films like Cleopatra and personalities like Marilyn Monroe

While Kevin has dabbled in fiction, the documentary genre remains closer to his heart. ?I grew up as a child watching movies and television. And I loved the fantasy, the horrors and the sci-fi stuff that were dished out. But I found documentary the most direct way to connect to the visual language of cinema and television. The political and social history associated with the world of images fascinates me more.?

 But Kevin admits it is not as easy to make a documentary on behind-the-scenes film-making. ?The process gets different with every project. Sometimes, film-makers are not available to help you out. Sometimes the studios take a non-co-operative stand. For example, when we made Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood, everyone told me that it was too scandalous and that Fox would never allow the real story to be told. But we did do a fine job and Fox complimented us on coming out with such an honest effort.?

 Kevin?s most profound experience was the making of Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days. ?I was aware of the existence of the footage from her last unfinished film. There was a documentary earlier which tried to tell the real story but it was phoney. When we embarked on the project, we had no pre-conceived notions. We used her last film Something?s Got To Give as the foundation and then used it in our production reports and interviews. A lot of people spoke to us very honestly because they knew they were going to pass away. And at the end of it all, we were hailed as the only people who got the story straight, as to how Marilyn had died.?

 Kevin, though, is not too impressed in the phenomenon named Michael Moore and his blockbuster documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. ?He is a propagandist, a sensationalist and a radical socialist. He has this very amusing style, where he creates an argument out of pieces that appear to be part of a documentary. The facts he presents are very much questionable. Bottomline is, he is not a documentarian. He creates works of fiction in a documentary style. He didn?t deserve the Oscar.?

 The champion of so many ?making of?? documentaries is not sure why films of this genre do not do well in India. ?I must say I am not that familiar with the Indian market. But there is definitely a common sentiment that one shouldn?t make films that debunk the myths of a movie. Then there are audiences who are hungry to know more about how a film is made. Ultimately, all films should be able to narrate a human story.?

 His story is certainly that and much more. ?My average day is stranger than fiction which involves everyone and everything from Faye Dunaway to Lost in Space to Harrison Ford to Star Wars,? says Kevin. ?When I was a kid staying 3,000 miles away from Hollywood and watching Lost in Space on television, I could never imagine that one day I?ll be making that same show business my livelihood.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Question mark on bug-shut surgeries

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four days after four operating theatres (OTs) at the Medical College and Hospital were shut down for testing positive in tetanus-causing spores, the authorities were clueless about when the quartet would be functional again.

 Hospital deputy superintendent Amarendra Biswas said the authorities were in constant touch with the infection control team and microbiology department for a clearance report, so that the OTs could be reopened.

 ?We have fumigated the OTs and more tests have been carried out. We are hopeful of performing operations from Wednesday,? said Biswas.

 Routine inspection of the OT walls and floor through swab tests revealed the presence of tetanus bacteria earlier this week. 

 Panic-stricken staff at Medical College and Hospital immediately cancelled all scheduled surgeries from last Thursday and closed down the OTs.

 Rattled by the incident, specialists across the city have urged the government to address the problem immediately. ?We are not sure how frequently the OTs are fumigated. This problem has been around for ages. We are not even sure whether the instruments are sterilised properly,? said R.D. Dubey, Indian Medical Association joint secretary (headquarters).

 A day after the Metro report on the infection scare, anti-Left healthcare organisations, patients and relatives queued up at the hospital to inquire about the situation. ?If required, we will shift our patients elsewhere,? a few of them said.

 Malignant malaria cases are also keeping the Medical College and Hospital staff on their toes.

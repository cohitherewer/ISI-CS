 Hardware recipe for tech success

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bangalore and Hyderabad excelled as centres for software, and Calcutta can carve its niche as a centre of hardware technology in the country. The recipe for success for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal came from BJP leader and former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha. 

 Sinha was speaking at a function organised by hardware training major Indian Institute of Hardware Technology (IIHT). 

 The private-sector training outfit, set up in 1992, has over 150 centres across the country and is in expansion mode. 

 As part of the company strategy to take hardware education to more and more people, IIHT inaugurated its eastern regional centre in the city. 

 Besides Sinha, the function was attended by Romesh Bhandari, former governor of Uttar Pradesh, film-maker Pahlaj Nihalani and G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT, government of West Bengal. 

 Addressing the students at the gathering, Sinha said: Not only software, India will also become a crucial player in the field of hardware technology and the private sector will have to play a major role in making that happen. 

 While Gautama talked about the giant leap that Bengal has taken in the field of IT, Bhandari reiterated the need to harness human resources to change the future of India. 

 Nihalani focussed on how the use of information technology has redefined the rules of the game in the entertainment industry.

 Preparing for growth in the industry by churning out industry-ready professionals was the key theme at the inaugural ceremony of IIHTs biggest centre in the country, on Chowringhee Road. 

 An estimate by consulting major Ernst amp; Young reveals that around 2.2 million jobs will be created in the hardware sector by 2010 and the gap between demand and supply will be around 1 million. We are gearing up to produce employable professionals and are drawing up expansion plans, said Devesh Srivastava, regional director, IIHT. 

 He added that the companys growth was highest in this part of the country. 

 According to the plan, 25 more IIHT centres will come up in the state and in the Northeast by 2005. IIHT also has plans to set up centres beyond the national boundaries, announced N. Keshava Raju, chief executive officer, IIHT.

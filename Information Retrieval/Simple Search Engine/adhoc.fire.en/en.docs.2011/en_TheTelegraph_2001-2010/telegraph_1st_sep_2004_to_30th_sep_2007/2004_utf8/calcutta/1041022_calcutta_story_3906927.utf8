The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mayor set to spread light

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With an initial allotment of Rs 7 crore, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has set about illuminating around 350 streets in ?no-light? zones.

 The zones, comprising more than 800 streets and lanes, are in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, as well as in certain pockets on the eastern fringe of the city. 

 The added areas, merged with the civic body in 1985, are spread over 81.4 sq km. 

 It?s the first time since 1985 that the civic body has allotted such a large amount for installing streetlights in the areas that are plunged into darkness after sundown.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee alleged that the former Left Front board, which had merged these areas with the city proper for its political benefit, had failed to light up a single street or lane in the 15 years of its tenure.

 ?My task would have been easier had the earlier board lit up even half of the no-light zones,? he added. 

 According to mayor-in-council member (market amp; lighting) Shamsuzzaman Ansari, councillors and chairpersons of five boroughs of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur have been asked to submit a list of roads that do not have lights.

 Only three chairpersons ? Sushanta Ghosh, Anjan Das and Iqbal Hossain Gazi ? have come up with their lists. Based on that, the civic body has granted Rs 1.81 crore. 

 ?Over Rs 60 lakh will be spent on installing lights on the streets in Haridebpur and Dhawan Colony, and on Najlisha Ara Road and Bamacharan Roy Road,? said borough XIII chairperson Sushanta Ghosh.

 Borough XIV chairperson Anjan Das said the civic grant was not enough for the 120 roads in his area. Roads in Ananda Nagar, Green Park, Talpukur Road and Subhas Pally will be taken up in the first phase, he asserted.

 The Garden Reach roads that will be lit up in the first phase include the ones in Ayub Nagar, Aris Nagar, Badartala and Pir Lane.

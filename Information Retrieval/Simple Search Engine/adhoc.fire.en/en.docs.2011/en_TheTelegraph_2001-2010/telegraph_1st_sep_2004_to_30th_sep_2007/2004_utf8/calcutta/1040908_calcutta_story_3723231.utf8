The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Phuchka is extremely popular even in rural areas. Moreover, it provides 

employment to many. But it is rather sad that both the phuchka vendors 

and the consumers are not at all quality conscious. Only a handful use clean water 

and prepare the food in hygienic conditions. The food inspectors of Calcutta Municipal 

Corporation should regularly collect samples from the vendors and check their 

quality. Vendors who offer unhygienic phuchkas should not be allowed to 

do business.

 Sushil Jyoti Avenue is one of the main roads in our locality. It is dotted 

with gaping potholes that turn into muddy puddles after every shower. Leave alone 

bumpy rides for passengers, even walking along the road has become a nightmare. 

Heavily loaded trucks and lorries, carrying construction material, that pass through 

the stretch are the main reasons for the potholes. Promoters also dump these materials 

along the road for days. The drains in the area are clogged with bricks and stone 

chips that fall from the passing trucks. Earlier, a lorry overturned on a compound 

wall while negotiating the narrow road blocked with construction material on either 

side. Fortunately, no one was injured. But we fear that someone may get injured 

one of these days. The residents of Rabindrapally have made several representations 

to the Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality in the past but to no avail. Many continue 

to suffer silently in fear of reprisal. It is high time that the civic body took 

up the complaint in right earnest.

 The recent incident of a teenaged hawker being thrown off a running train just 

because he had boarded the ladies compartment was shocking. It is quite possible 

that someone accidentally boards the ladies compartment just when the train is 

leaving the platform. To avoid such incidents the railways should paint the ladies 

compartments in a different colour. This would also help female passengers to 

identify the coach easily when the train is entering the platform.

 My name was wrongly spelt in my Calcutta University registration certificate 

but it hasnt been rectified to date despite my repeated appeals. I have faced 

a lot of problems because of the error. The university should not harass students 

unnecessarily like this. The staff members should show some willingness to amend 

their mistakes. I appeal to the universitys higher authorities to take stern 

action against the lackadaisical attitude of its staff in redressing complaints. 

 Md. Tarique Nisar, Collin Street.

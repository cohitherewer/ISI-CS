Two thousand and counting. Happy Club, Calcutta?s 

?first and only virtual club? offering single-card access to a whole host of facilities 

from pubs, clubs, hotels and travel breaks, has crossed the magic mark of 2,000 

members, 18 months from inception.

?We began our journey with the revolutionary and unprecedented 

virtual club concept. It seemed a daunting task at the beginning. But 2,000 members 

later, Happy Club is overwhelmed by the love and trust showered by Calcutta. More 

and more members are being added everyday to the Happy fold through references 

of satisfied members,? says Sushil Poddar, chairman, Happy Group of Companies.

The club has not just gained currency with the middle 

and upper-middle class, it is fast catching on with Calcutta?s GenX. While the 

management is on the lookout for strategic tie-ups, nationally and internationally, 

to satisfy growing demands and to commemorate the landmark of 2,000 members, the 

club has announced a clutch of fresh benefits for new entrants.

The virtual club has a dedicated team that provides 

24X7 assistance and information to new, existing and future members. There is 

also a research and development team working to provide better service to its 

clientele.

?We live in an extremely stressful world today. Wholesome 

entertainment and relaxation is often totally missing in our lives. Keeping this 

in mind, we decided to create something that would provide comfort as well as 

joy. Now, with more and more members willing to be a part of the Happy family, 

we are thinking of new, innovative ideas,? says Poddar.

The club had started with basic tie-ups across the 

city, but now boasts of national and international partnerships that provide members 

with unlimited options. Happy Club is looking to expand in the northeast as well. 

It will not only target new members but also shore up facilities for existing 

patrons.

A Happy Club member can enjoy facilities like clubbing, 

gym, swimming, pubs, holiday packages and Internet surfing ? all with the help 

of one card only.

?We are not getting carried away by the success. We 

are happy that people have liked our innovative ideas and we will try our best 

to live up to their expectations,? assures Poddar.

Against an annual membership fee of Rs 15,567 for 

an individual and Rs 9,567 for spouse and child, the management of Happy Club 

promises facilities with a cumulative worth of Rs 3.5 lakh, approximately.

Family membership (for the couple and one child below 

12 years) comes for Rs 30,567, ?with no hidden costs?.

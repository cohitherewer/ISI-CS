 Nature shift in engineer cradle

 A STAFF REPORTER

Shibpur Bengal Engineering College

Joining the rest of the nation in observing Engineers? 

Day for the first time on Monday, the Shibpur Bengal Engineering College has resolved 

to revise its curricula and make it more environment-oriented by 2006. 

 ?The theme of Monday?s programme was ?Engineers and Environment Protection?, focussing on the role of engineers in social development,? said vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea. 

 ?At the end of the programme, we pledged to modify our courses so engineers graduating from our institution will be more green-conscious,? added N.R. Bandyopadhyay, event coordinator and endowment scientist associated with BE College?s School of Material Science and Engineering. 

 The speech delivered by chief guest Shankar Sen, former state power minister, was aimed at inspiring students and the faculty to go green. 

 Sen enthralled the 200-strong audience, comprising faculty members, post-graduate students and guests, by recalling how Tagore had first started environment education in school. 

 Pupils up to Class VI should be taught their lessons in the lap of nature and the exam system should start only from Class VII, Sen said. 

 ?The lecture was very inspiring and relevant. The former minister spoke of the ethics component in education and industry,? Bandyopadhyay recalled. 

 Vice-chancellor Banerjea?s message to his students was simple: ?We human beings live to learn and learn to live.? Appreciating Sen?s views, he elaborated on why Engineers? Day was a momentous occasion for all Indian technocrats.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Local or global, nowhere to travel

 - Hotels chock-a-block, resorts full up, flights with serpentine waiting lists

 NISHA LAHIRI

 Budget or five-star, domestic or international, if you?re planning a last-minute Puja trip, forget it. Unless it?s on a deserted island or on a mountain peak ? and accessible by road ? there aren?t too many options left. Hotels are booked up and flights are chock-a-block. Till mid-November, it?s all a festive fight for air and room space.

 If last autumn?s figures were phenomenal (post-Iraq and SARS, people were desperate to head out), the numbers this year are even better. Southeast Asia being the top draw for Calcuttans is no surprise. But north Bengal and Sikkim are very much back on the Puja map.

 Sikkim bookings are up by 70 per cent, says Sudip Nandi, leisure manager, International Travel House, while Madhulika Saraf, director of Gainwell Travels, says there are almost no hotel rooms available in Darjeeling. ?For the first time, I am having problems getting rooms in Darjeeling,? she says. Indian Airlines flights to Bagdogra are full up, with serpentine waiting lists.

 Mountains apart, beaches remain the big draw. Port Blair is a sell-out hotspot, and Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and even Sri Lanka and Bali are being overrun by the Bengal brigade, while Australia and New Zealand are attracting their fair share.

 On the waterfront, cruises are fast catching on, too, from the Alaskan to the Mediterranean, Hawaiian to the Caribbean, as spending shows a spurt. Although the easing of visa regulations to Mauritius and China are only just catching on, Europe is the western top draw, ahead of the US. 

The only problem, getting any where, is the lack of 

flight space. quot;Last year, people spent about Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000. This 

time, its about Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000, quot; says Nandi.

About 20-25 couples have so far booked the Hawaiian 

and Caribbean cruises from Gain well, at $700 per person (if booked in advance). 

But the most popular are the Southeast Asia Star cruises.

But the Puja booking period isnt even over yet. 

Indian Airlines expects much more, while SOTC is having trouble with last-minute 

planners.

For Dipayan Gupta, from the leisure division of Globe 

Forex and Travels, the remarkable trend has been kids making demands from parents 

for holidays to destinations that they have glimpsed in Bollywood films. quot;I 

dont even know about it, until they tell me, quot; says Gupta, explaining 

how New Zealand is a Kaho Naa? Pyar Hai locale.

The winter vacation deluge, too, has already begun. 

 quot;Two people at Gainwell are right now dedicated to winter bookings, quot; 

says Saraf. 

The surprise package is honeymooners, with exotic-destination 

requests. quot;We have had a large number of honeymooners, particularly for the 

cruises, quot; adds the Gainwell director. quot;Honeymooners want a lot of things, 

from exotic locales to shopping and nightlife, quot; explains an SOTC spokesperson.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wedge of cheese, sip of wine, life divine

 - Carnival to bring classic combination out of star hotel confines, on to Calcutta palate

 SUBHRO SAHA

 A true-blue Italian Parmigiano cheese goes with nearly any wine, but a strong tannic Cabernet Sauvignon is ?perfectly heightened by the cheese?s sharp flavour?, recommends Andrea Immer in Great Wines Made Simple.

 Wine and cheese, that classic combination, dates back more than 6,000 years. And this winter, Calcuttans can discover new pairings, a bottle and a wedge at a time. A wine and cheese festival organised by Grain of Salt, in collaboration with Chateau Indage, at the Camac Street eatery (December 15-22) promises to bring the harsh young reds and the mellow whites ?outside the confines of star hotels for the first time?, pairing them with choicest imported cheese.

 Experts from the Chateau Indage stable will stand by to aid the uninitiated and the connoisseur alike. ?The whole idea of the carnival is to encourage dialogue,? says Grain of Salt?s administration head Pankaj Tandon.

 The organisers hope that by the time the week laced with crisp Riesling or fruity Beaujolais is out, a clutch of Calcuttans would have embraced the wine-cheese pairing and mastered its grammar as well. Besides, of course, being well-versed in vine truths ? like mature, unwooded white wines go well with mild cheeses, or that wines shouldn?t be served too cold when pairing with cheese, as the ?fat would solidify when the cold wine hits the palate?.

 With more and more Calcuttans travelling abroad and satellite TV titillating taste-buds with dollops of lifestyle bytes, wine and cheese evenings have become popular in the city now, feels Nitin Kohli, director, Grain of Salt. ?Wine consumption has increased manifold, and some of our diners don?t just say they want a red or a white wine. They even specify the label and grape,? reveals Kohli.

 The Chateau Indage experts, besides giving out small handouts on how to enjoy the pairings in small groups, will also educate the consumer on wine-and-cheese etiquette and custom. For instance, semi-soft cheese tends to be ?more assertive? and can stand well-made rose wines, light reds and flavourful white wines. 

 ?But we would leave the table wide open for experimentation. The idea is to get people into a festive mood,? says Tandon.

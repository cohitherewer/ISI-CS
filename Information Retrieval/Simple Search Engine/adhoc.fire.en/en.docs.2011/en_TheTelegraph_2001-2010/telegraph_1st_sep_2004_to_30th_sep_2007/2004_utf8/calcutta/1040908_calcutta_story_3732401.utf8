 Skirt smart with flared frills, designer jewels to match

ZEESHAN JAWED

The 

skirt sweep is on. Diva, a boutique on 19 Mahanirvan Road, opposite Triangular 

Park, is yet another destination to measure long skirt lengths. Crushed cotton 

and silk ensembles with brocade trimmings is what they have for girls out to make 

a statement with the hottest garment in vogue. 

 Helping you coordinate your stuff better, Divas got matching crushed shirts with scarves. The sleeveless, halter and cap-sleeved tops edged with brocade pair with the skirts for a semi-formal occasion while kurtis in pure crepe and georgette are for more formal dos. As for an all-out evening splash, Divas got crushed skirts in light silk with satin and brocade trimmings again. Coupled with layers that add volume, these can give designer lehngas a run for their money. If all this is too heavy for you, theres nothing like the classic combo of a long flared bottom teamed with a fitted tee, in a contrasting shade.

 Trinket trend

 Jewellery is finally being seen more on the wearer than in her bank locker. Designer jewellery is gaining fast ground with the young and the trendy who value a jewel for its face value than its weight in karats. 

 Jewellery designer Chetna Nandas got her finger right on the pulse, or rather the purse, of this segment as showcased in a two-day exhibition this weekend. 

 A combination of ethnic and contemporary motifs in gold jazzed up with precious stones like diamonds, rubies, emeralds and pearls found ready takers. 

 The pieces have been designed for both formal and informal occasions by Chetna, who has nurtured a passion for trinkets since childhood, which found a professional face post a course from the Gem and Jewellery Council of India, New Delhi. 

 Chetna has an array of bridal designs as well that include kundan pieces, antique work jewellery, ones in Victorian style and a lot more.

 Veg out

 Green is the colour of the day if the mushrooming of vegetarian joints in the city is anything to go by. 

 The latest hangout to veg in is Dwarikapuri in Cossipore. North Indian, South Indian and Chinese dishes vie for menu space in this air- conditioned restaurant run by people with over 40 years experience in the business. 

 We have been running a dhaba in the vicinity for close to half-a-century now. There was a huge demand in the area for another eatery on the same lines and so we decided to take the plunge, said owner Bishwakarma Singh.

 Veg Biryani, Veg Pulao, Paneer Butter Masala and different kinds of parathas is what youll be looking in the Indian section apart from regular South Indian fare of dosas and idlis. And if you thought Chinese without chicken is a no no, try their Veg Noodles, Chilli Paneer and Paneer Manchurian for taste. 

The fare is reasonably priced between Rs 40 and Rs 

50.

Overheard...

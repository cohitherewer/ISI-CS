 Junk food feeds festive spirit

 Some food action on the city streets. Picture by Sanjoy Chattapadhyaya 

Kochuri and aloo dum, chana bhatura, 

masala dosa, phuchka, papri chaat, bhel puri, batata 

puri, pav bhaji, telebhaja, chop, fish fry, chowmein and chilli 

chicken, roll, singara, sandwich, popcorn, chips, ice cream, candy floss? 

It?s one giant feast these festive days. And the best thing about it all is that 

the junk food jamboree all but trundles right up to your door.

 The festive menu is long and luscious enough to keep the worst glutton satisfied ? and we?re talking just pavement ? and park ? fare here. Pandal-hopping is never complete without taking time out to try the junk food and snacks on offer at the footpath stalls. What?s more, the delicious morsels can be had at mid-day or midnight, depending on your munch mood.

 Selimpur in the south or Vivekananda Park in the north, Mohammad Ali Park to College Square and Surya Sen Street, Park Circus, Singhi Park and the Salt Lake swimming pool area ? it?s all a hungry arm?s length away. The vendors line the roads, with stalls and stoves working overtime to feed the hungry mouths queuing up, be it at 2 am or 2 pm.

 The culinary delights in the north and the south are distinct in menu and taste. A walk down from Md Ali Park to College Square has some lesser-known treats that are not to be missed. Rolls, pav bhajis and dahi vada reign supreme, as does chowmein cooked for the Calcutta taste buds. But in the smaller lanes and bylanes, the occasional mashima or pishima can be found selling hot, home-made fish fry.

 Fist-sized telebhajas and vegetable chops are other delicacies. Phuchkawalas can be found in clusters, in front of Medical College and Hospital and in Vivekananda Park. And they?ll serve up the goodies as long as customers slurp them up.

 Burgers and fries, chicken sandwiches, fried rice and ice cream go down quite well with a can of cola after a visit to Ekdalia Park. But there?s no replacing the kochuri and aloo dum or luchi and chholar dal. Between the fancy restaurants are lanes and bylanes punctuated by small stalls and food vendors selling a wide variety of delicacies. 

 Jodhpur Park to Palm Avenue, there?s something for everyone, be it just jhaal muri or a plate of mutton biryani. The junk food trade does do particularly brisk business in the Puja period and it rubs off on regular haunts like the Gariahat roll shops, dishing out the famous egg-muttons as fast as the crowds can gobble them up. 

Bright pink candy floss might keep the kids happy, 

but what?s Puja without stopping for phuchka at Park Circus Maidan after 

a darshan of the Devi and a bit of shopping for knick-knacks?

A couple of pop picks from the junk food yard:

Mohammad Ali Park

What

 Pav bhaji and dahi vadas from Mayaram?s Snacks on Lord Sinha Road known for its distinct taste. Keep a bottle of water handy while slurping the hot stuff. Their dahi vadas are as much a treat for the eyes as for the tongue with an array of sweet, hot and tangy chutneys whetting the appetite.

 Bhel puri at the Gupta?s stall is yet another attraction. Get it made as you like it best. Lal chutney for the sweet toothed and a dash of some really hot hari chutney will have your eyes watering well before the bhashan! 

How much

 Those fed on Mayaram?s flavours are advised not to skip this stop while out to hop and jump pandals. You get a discount of a good five to 10 bucks here, what with a plate-full of the heavenly fare available for Rs 20 only. Gupta?s bhel puri comes even cheaper at Rs 15 per plate.

Saptami sales

 Around 450 plates of pav bhaji and 400 plates of dahi vada at Mayaram?s. Over 250 plates of bhel puri at Gupta?s.

Tarachand Dutt Street (on Chitpur Road)

What

 Papri chaat is drawing in the peppy lot by hoards here. Though the fare is inherently sweet, they also serve a spicier version to cater to the pre-dominantly non-Bengali neighbourhood. So remember to specify preferences if you don?t want to munch by the book!

How much

 Rs 20 per plate

Saptami sales

 Around 200 plates

Do it yourself

(By Victor Banerjee)

 Every festive season has its ups and downs, its highs and lows, its tears of joy and pathetic moans over excesses. Just for the fun of it, I intend to make you sick with not only one of the funniest concoctions of death ever conceived but also a panacea that tastes as foul as anything that ever crept out of our sewers into Babu Ghat and dissolved in the waters of our unholy Hooghly. 

First, the killer:

Ingredients 

 500 g Quaker oats or dalia, 500 g Kashmiri or Sunderban honey, 6 pints double cream and three 75 ounce bottles of Scotch or its best Indian equivalent.

Method

 Crush the oatmeal and soak it in a pan of cold water overnight or for 24 hours. Strain the liquid and combine it with the cream and honey. Stir in the Scotch and put it in the refrigerator to chill. 

 As fatal as the above might sound, all it has ever done is encourage duels at dawn with pistols of your choice and the rightful pair of lovers living to a ripe old age.

The killer recovery: 

Ingredients 

 1 egg yolk (unbroken), a good pinch of salt, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 4 drops Tabasco sauce.

Method

Place the ingredients, in order, in a shot glass (or 

medicine glass). Close your eyes, make a face like a banglar paanch and 

swallow it in one gulp. 

Also known as the ?Prairie Oyster?, this medicine 

for the morning after the night you should never have had, has made sharpshooters 

of dawn-duelists whose knock-kneed approach to Victorian romances had made bus-burning 

Marxists out of sandesh-quaffing Boisnobs.

 My pronams to my elders and my love and blessings to the youth whose futures we depend upon, for Bijoya.

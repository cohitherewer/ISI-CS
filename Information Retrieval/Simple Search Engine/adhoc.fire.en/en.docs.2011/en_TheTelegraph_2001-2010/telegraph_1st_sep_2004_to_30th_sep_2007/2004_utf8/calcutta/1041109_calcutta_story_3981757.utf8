 Indonesian thrust to integrated township 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Housing development in west Howrah has been put on the fast track with the chairmen of the Indonesia-based Salim Group and Ciputra Group touching down on Monday to finalise the details of an integrated satellite township there.

 Slated to come up on 390 acres at the junction of Howrah-Amta Road and National Highway 6, the township will boast of nearly 7,000 bungalows, schools, hospitals, shopping centres and multiplexes.

 Beni Santoso, executive director of the Salim Group and Ciputra, chairman of the Ciputra group, along with senior officials of both companies met commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen, housing minister Goutam Deb, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and finance minister Asim Dasgupta on Monday morning. 

 ?We expect the first phase, spread over 17.65 acres, to be complete in one-and-a-half years. The entire township should be complete in around four years,? Ciputra said at Writer?s Buildings.

 The Indonesian visitors were taken on a three-hour sightseeing tour by officials and engineers of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA).

 ?Apart from West Howrah, we also took the delegation to Dankuni township, second Vivekananda Bridge (Bally bridge), Belghoria Expressway and some National Highway projects in the vicinity to review the local infrastructure. We told them that once the Bally Bridge is commissioned, Dankuni would only be a 20 minute drive from the airport,? said a state government official who accompanied the team. 

 The Indonesian groups are reportedly considering developing the Dankuni township.

 A memorandum of agreement was signed in July between the CMDA and Beyond Limit International Ltd (BLIL) , a company formed by the groups for developing the Howrah township.

 BLIL will pay CMDA Rs 95 crore to obtain a 999-year lease of the land. The first instalment of Rs 20 crore will be paid to the state government on Tuesday, at the time of the land registration.

 On Monday evening, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said this is the first instance of a foreign private player developing a township. 

 ?The bosses of Salim and Ciputra groups are here and will stay till Tuesday evening, when the West Howrah township project will be finalised. The Salim group has expertise in the field ? they have developed townships in Vietnam and China,? Bhattacharjee said. He expressed hope that the Dankuni township would also be developed.

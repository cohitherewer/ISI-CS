 Driver on cell, car kills man

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Blood was spilt yet again on the mishap stretch off Indira Bhavan, home of former chief minister Jyoti Basu. One person was killed and two people were seriously injured on Monday after a VIP car mowed them down.

 Witnesses said the driver of the white Ambassador was on a mobile phone when his car knocked down the passersby on Third Avenue, close to Basu?s house, in the Bidhannagar (North) police station area. 

 Ajit Hazra, 57, died on the spot, while Bishnupada Sarkar and Suranjan Bose were severely injured. Both were admitted to Bidhannagar sub-divisional hospital, but Sarkar was later shifted to Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital. 

 Around 11 am, the VIP car from Karunamoyee was headed for EC island. Witnesses said the driver, talking on the phone, lost control of his vehicle while trying to avoid crashing into a car in front. The vehicle knocked down the three men. Police said they were verifying the cause of the accident. 

 The car first hit Hazra, who was walking towards Poura Bhavan. As he fell down, the car hit Sarkar, who was riding a bicycle. ?In a bid to flee, the driver rammed the car into Bose, a bystander,? an official said.

 Hazra lived in Salt Lake?s CD Block. Sarkar lives in Dum Dum Park, while Bose is from Baguiati. ?We got the car?s number from the witnesses,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

Poncho power in pret pick

Fashion focus

Smita Roy Chowdhury tells you what 

to slip on and how, this winter

World leaders, including President George W. Bush, 

paraded it on a power catwalk at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Summit 

in Chile last month. From the runways to the high streets, down to the neighbourhood 

malls in the US, the UK and most other European countries, the one garb dominating 

fashion frontiers for the past few months has been the poncho.

This traditional outfit ? a rectangular piece of fabric 

with a hole cut out in the centre for the head ? is back with a bang, and this 

time with more style than ever before.

The trend has trickled down to our city too and some 

of our top designers have already started churning out interesting variations 

of this garment, deemed as this winter?s must-have. 

The poncho plays a major role in designer Kiran Uttam 

Ghosh?s winter ?04 line (flaunted by model Tanushree in picture left). ?The poncho 

is here to stay, at least for some time, and it?s the outfit to be seen in this 

New Year,? declares Kiran.

?I remember growing up as a child wearing ponchos 

in the Seventies, when my mother and aunts would knit them out of wool, with pom 

poms hanging from the end of the strings. It?s a fairly traditional garment, yet 

very current,? she adds.

What the designer loves about the poncho is its versatility, 

which makes it open to experimentation. Kiran has worked on quite a few variations 

of the traditional poncho.

Assymetrical high-low hemlines, wraparounds (where 

one open side of the outfit can be draped elegantly over the shoulder like a shawl), 

three-layered with tassels, slitted with one arm showing, hooded and even off-shoulder 

are some of the popular innovations. 

?It?s a very interesting drape and can be utilised 

in whichever way one likes. One can just wear the regular poncho with the hanging 

sides in the middle and that immediately gives an interesting V-shape both at 

the front and back,? says Kiran.

Designer Rupam Banerjee has given an ethnic twist 

to the poncho with batik prints, hand-paint and embroidery. These are mostly 

in earth tones as base, with bright splashes of fuschia and pink.

While these have a fairly semi-formal look, the young 

designer also has a line of party ponchos in solid colours or embellishments like 

sequins, gotah, mirrorwork, and brass borders. The prints, where she has 

used them, range from the floral to the abstract. The palette picks on fuschia, 

turquoise, black, white and red. 

There is experimentation in the cut too. The kaftan 

ponchos are slightly longer than the regular ones and have been perfectly paired 

with churidars, while there?s another variety in which one side of the 

outfit has been kept open to reveal a bustier inside. Rupam has also given some 

definition to the waist and the sleeves to lend a more feminine feel to this otherwise 

shapeless silhouette.

?I?ve been doing ponchos for quite some time now and 

my stuff has been majorly in demand with young girls. I think it?s going to be 

quite a big hit during the New Year,? feels Rupam.

The fabric focus is mainly on georgettes and chiffons 

for their free-falling advantage.

?Till now I?ve been doing mostly georgettes and chiffons, 

with some cottons and crochets too. For the winter, I have a special line of Pashmina 

ponchos. The ones I have done with Indian fabrics and brocade borders are just 

flying off the racks in the UK and the Middle East,? reveals Kiran. 

Georgette seems to the most popular choice of texture 

when it comes to ponchos.

?The fall of a poncho is very important and it should 

be absolutely free flowing. So, it comes out best in georgettes, chiffons and 

crepes. But you can?t make silk ponchos as the fabric tends to be rather stiff 

and doesn?t give the outfit a good fall,? feels designer Megha Dalmiya, who has 

been quietly feeding the poncho fetish from her Alipore boutique, M amp;S. 

Megha has a line of party ponchos with embellishments 

like coins, sea-shell buttons, beads, stones and patchwork. The beaten track is 

abandoned in the form as well ? tie-on ponchos that can be strapped around the 

waist for feminine effect, off-shoulder ones are more. Megha?s casual line comprises 

printed ones with little embroidery. 

?The poncho is an amazing garment and it suits practically 

everybody. You don?t have to bother about the fit and the cut. It covers up the 

mid-section figure flaws, too. It is doing really well with my clients, especially 

a line where I have teamed them up with brocade pants,? says Megha.

The best thing about the poncho, in fact, is that 

you can pair it with almost anything ? skirts, trousers, jeans, capris and even 

churidars.

Whatever you wear it with, the poncho is the thing 

to be seen in if you are out to make an impressionable style statement this New 

Year.

Nature?s way to harmony

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

We live in a duplex flat where the stairs run 

anti-clockwise. We have been told that this is inauspicious. Though we have been 

living happily here for many years, this is now playing on our minds. What is 

the solution and how should we plan our staircase when building our next house?

Mousumi Majumdar, Calcutta

 Feng Shui revolves around the movement of the sun. Stairs moving upwards or doors opening should be in harmony with nature. This is also symbolic of moving ahead in life. This problem can be solved by placing mirrors on the wall running parallel to the stairs. Further, placing fresh plants in a zigzag manner along with beautiful artefacts and paintings on a well-lit landing will enhance the energy. In general, Feng Shui prefers wide and broad stairs to narrow, steep and straight ones. Such stairs cause chi to move too fast from one level to the next and are considered harmful and unlucky. It is better when they curve softly and change direction at each level, carrying auspicious chi in a gentle and meandering fashion. Gaps between steps cause energy to get lost as it moves upwards. This is considered a source of draining wealth.

I am fighting a prolonged legal battle regarding 

my property. There are three shops in the house, which have been occupied by a 

distant relative for the past 60 years. They refuse to vacate the premises or 

to pay rent. Recently, the doors of the shops have been painted blue. I am very 

disturbed by this. My date of birth is December 12, 1933. What can I do to bring 

some relief to my family?

Dipen Kundu, Jatin Sen Sarani

 The north-west area of the house, bedroom or office is the region where blessings are believed to pour in. If energised properly, the father of the family also enjoys fortune in abundance. This area is known for its movement. So your legal case will be sorted out in no time if you place the documents pertaining to the case here in a yellow file. Next, take a picture of your house, highlight the three shops with a yellow marker and write ?vacated? across them with a gold pen and sign underneath.

 Level living

We have recently moved into a company-furnished 

flat where we will be staying for the next five years. The master bedroom is divided 

into levels and the bed is on the lower level. I feel this is not correct. Is 

this Feng Shui-friendly?

Soumitra Mukherjee

Feng Shui does not encourage split levels at all. 

They may seem artistic but they cause chi to be disturbed. This may lead 

to unnecessary problems. You should sleep on the raised level and keep the depressed 

one for entertaining or watching TV. 

Beam burden

We live in a very old house where there are 

beams all over. In our bedroom, the overhead beam runs across the bed. We are 

ageing and our health is deteriorating. Should we alter the beam to enjoy better 

health?

Madanlal, Calcutta

 Beams carry the load of the upper floor and exert downward pressure on the person sitting or sleeping directly beneath it. They disturb and suppress the smooth flow of energy over the region of the body they pass over, affecting the person?s energy field. The effect varies from individual to individual depending on constitution, health and energy levels. As you are ageing and have been sleeping under the beam for a long time, its pressure has weakened your health. They are not harmful from a health point of view if you do not sit or sleep under them. You must relocate the bed or conceal the beam with a false ceiling. Or you could hang a soft cloth canopy over the bed, like you would on a four-poster bed.

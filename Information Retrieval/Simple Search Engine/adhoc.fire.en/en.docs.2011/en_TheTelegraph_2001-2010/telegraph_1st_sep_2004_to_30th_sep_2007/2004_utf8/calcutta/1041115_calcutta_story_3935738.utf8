Beyond the classroom

Staffrooms are not what most would consider 

a real office, but for teachers, it is the place where all the backroom 

work gets done, writes Zeeshan Jawed

The smell of paper, piles of files, high ceilings 

and ancient wooden furniture. That ? along with the passion for education ? makes 

a staffroom. This is not your typical office, where boulder-like babus rule the 

roost and red tape reigns supreme. This is the workplace of people who have dedicated 

their lives to prepare the rest of us to take on the world.

But the business of education is a constant race against 

time, with the pressure to complete ever-growing syllabi, prepare lessons, meet 

correction deadlines, handle problem children and other tasks. The staffroom is 

where most of the work gets done, when the classroom-hopping comes to an end.

Open doors

While schools across the city may have found swank 

new avatars, older establishments have stayed just the same. They wouldn?t think 

of going the corporate way with cubicles.

?Doing so might be detrimental,? feels Debolina Sen, 

senior assistant teacher, Ling Liang High School. ?It would stop the flow and 

interaction of ideas. Teachers will also become unapproachable to students,? she 

adds.

Just like in a commercial set-up, it would introduce 

an element of politics, and could create a rift between junior and senior teachers. 

In staffrooms, veterans share the same space as relative novices. 

?I have colleagues who were my students once upon 

a time. But nobody forgets to draw the line amidst all the camaraderie. That helps 

maintain a congenial atmosphere at our workplace,? explains Diya Banerjee, assistant 

teacher, Loreto, Bowbazar.

She has some advice for seniors too: ?Respect juniors? 

individuality or else you might end up losing your place of prestige.? So the 

first rule is to work as one coherent unit. 

The last thing you want is wily students playing one 

teacher off against the other.

Positive pulse

After a hectic day in classrooms, staffrooms are an 

anchor. It is a great place to unwind if the atmosphere is friendly.

It is the place to have a casual chat with a colleague, 

share the sometimes heavy burden of managing young minds and shed some anxiety. 

But things can go awry if there is negative energy. Best to clear misunderstandings 

up as soon as possible, advise senior educators.

Shared moments

Often, this is the room where special friendships 

are forged. ?We share a common room, sitting space and shelves. We see each other 

first thing in the morning. So after a point, colleagues become more like family. 

Sharing lunch, ideas and confidences becomes quite normal. Even a 10-minute adda 

is a big stress reliever,? says Debolina Sen.

New rules

But teachers are no longer confined to an ivory tower 

making them inaccessible to students. Efforts are on across the board to bridge 

the gap. Teachers at The Heritage School have all their meals with students. Faculty 

and students of Calcutta International School buy their food from the same canteen.

Efforts are on to update staff about latest technology. 

Internet access, a well-stocked library, yoga classes and counselling are increasingly 

at a teacher?s disposal. So, while discipline is still strict, teachers and students 

are discovering new and more informal ways of connecting.

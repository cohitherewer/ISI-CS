Red red wine, stay close to me

It might be a little late in the day to brew it now to go along with home-made cookies and pies this Christmas, but as they say, it?s never too late to start. You can always use it next Christmas or New Year (or mid-year if you feel too greedy).

 A long-standing tradition among the Anglo-Indian and Christian communities in the city, the process of wine making has to start at least three months in advance, which is the minimum time required for the sugar to ferment thoroughly.

 Families in Bow Barracks have been known to brew wine for home consumption for a long time now, a major part of which is downed on their annual Christmas-eve bash ? a colourful gala packed with live music, a benevolent Santa, home-made goodies and lots of cheer.

 The mood ?inspired? musician and film-maker Anjan Dutt to make an English feature film, Bow Barracks Forever. The film was initially supposed to be titled Aunty Lobo?s Wine, based on a middle-aged Anglo-Indian character who lives by baking cakes and brewing red wine in a screen saga depicting the ?story of survival of the people of Calcutta, and particularly of the Anglo-Indian community?. 

 The film is yet to release, but you can always go ahead and buy a 750 ml bottle of wine for Rs 85 to Rs 90 from a friendly family you may know of. You might have to face a little resistance on the residents? part if you don?t go through known channels as a couple of people here have faced liquor-licence related harassment from the authorities even though the wine is brewed strictly for family consumption.

 A couple of kindly families, however, were generous enough to share their fiercely-guarded wine recipes with Goodlife. ?Grapes are not the only ingredient you can brew wine with. Apple, beetroot, raisin and even ginger can be used,? reveals Susan D?Souza, who has many interesting recipes up her sleeve. These were passed on to her by her mother who, in turn, learnt of them from her mother, and so on. ?Each family has its own special touch,? says her neighbour Mary George.

 ?Cleanliness is the key when brewing wine at home, so make sure all the fruits or vegetables are thoroughly washed,? offers Mary. The utensils as well as the gloves you?ll use for crushing the ingredients should be squeaky clean.

 d-timers recommend porcelain vessels for best results, though plastic buckets can also be used to crush the fruits. ?There is no hard and fast rule regarding the sugar-fruit ratio, which is subject to your own discretion, depending on how sweet or bitter you want the wine to taste,? says Susan.

 Beginners can start off with this simple recipe that combines the best of Bow Barracks:

 Crush the fruits or vegetables thoroughly. 

 Caramelise the sugar for colour.

 Boil some water and cool it.

 Add the sugar and water to the crushed fruits 

along with a little yeast, cover and keep in a cool place.

 It is to remain like that for 21 days, but 

in the interim you have to stir it once everyday. While stirring, it is advisable 

to taste a little to see if you need to add more sugar, for once the sugar is 

fermented, you can?t alter the taste.

 After 21 days, strain it with a fine, clean 

muslin cloth, cover and keep aside.

 After seven days, strain it again and let it 

stay.

 After three weeks, strain it again and let 

it stay for another month or two.

 Pour in sterilised whisky or rum bottles and 

secure the cap tightly.

 It takes roughly three months before the wine is ready, at the end of which all the sugar would have fermented into alcohol. The longer you keep it after that, the better it will taste, but that of course is subject to your patience!

 Some keep on straining the wine from time to time, for no matter how well you?ve strained the wine while brewing it, sediments keep forming. Home-made wine usually tastes sweeter than its branded counterparts, so if you want, you can lace it with a little rum or alcohol to make it nice and strong. 

 Cheers!

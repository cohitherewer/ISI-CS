The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Waste check time lapses

 JAYANTA BASU 

 The deadline set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) passed almost nine months ago. 

 Yet, only eight of the 126 municipalities in the state have complied with the directives of the Supreme Court and the CPCB to obtain authorisation from the state pollution control board regarding solid waste management. 

 ?Despite arranging a series of interactive programmes with the civic bodies, only 29 of them had applied for the authorisation. We?ll soon file an affidavit in the Supreme Court in this regard,? said an official of the state environment department.

 The municipalities that have complied with the apex court directives are Mahestala, Panihati, Bhadreswar, Chandernagore, New Barrackpore, North Dum Dum, Garulia and Siliguri.

 West Bengal?s case, however, is not unique. The CPCB order is being violated across the country. 

 Early in 2004, a writ petition had been filed in the apex court regarding the non-compliance of the directive.

 Acting on the petition, the court had directed all chief secretaries to ensure that the state pollution control boards, along with officials from the local bodies and the departments of urban development and revenue, ?pro-actively scout for suitable waste management locations?. The states were asked to ?submit quarterly progress reports?. 

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya admitted that ?solid waste management is the most crucial issue for the local bodies?.

 He added: ?The funding of the project, as well as spotting a suitable site for it, are the two major limiting factors for the municipalities.? 

 To find a way out, he has written to the Centre, pleading for a ?national urban solid waste management programme?, especially for major metros like Calcutta.

 Minister Bhattacharya had a word of praise for Bhadreswar, Kanchrapara and Kalyani municipalities for their waste management systems. 

 While the Kanchrapara model is the latest in the state, the one followed by Kalyani deals mainly with bio-medical waste. 

 ?Apart from the usual allotment, we are also using megacity funds for the purpose,? the minister said.

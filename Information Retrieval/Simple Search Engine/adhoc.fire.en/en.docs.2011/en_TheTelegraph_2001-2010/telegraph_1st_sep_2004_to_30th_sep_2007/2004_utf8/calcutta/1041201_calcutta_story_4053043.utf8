 Barbecue fire to light sizzling season

 IPSITA DEB

In 

case you are wondering how to make the most of that pleasant nip in the early 

winter air, take a cue from star hotels to warm up with a sizzling barbecue?

 Rum ?? roast

 Lighting up your fire is the Bar-be-Que fest by the Oberoi poolside accompanied by a great assortment of beverages.

 Come evening and the night air comes alive with live counters with over a dozen chefs at work conjuring up enticing aromas of stir-fried, tandoor and grilled goodies. 

 Eggs, prawns, chicken, fish, babycorn and broccoli in the stir-fried section are seasoned with spices of your own choosing. Noodles and rice to go along with the assortment are also cooked in customised styles. 

 Tenderloin, king fish, beckti, lamb and chicken form the mainstay of the grill. While the desi touch is provided by kebabs ? fish, chicken, lamb ? served with mint chutney and freshly chopped salad. And all this while you warm yourself up by the softly burning bukhara (small earthen oven). 

 Wash it all down with some home-grown flavoured dark rum. Available in orange, cinnamon, cherry, five different kinds of spices and coffee flavours, the rum is supposed to be had on the rocks, no diluter required insist the stewards. ?Rum is one drink that goes excellently with barbecue,? stressed executive chef George. 

 Private punch

 Also biting the barbecue bait is the winter poolside restaurant at the Taj Bengal, which is open every evening, between November-end and early March. 

 The entire poolside is dimly lit with the wrought iron tables and chairs placed far apart to offer privacy. Each table is placed under the canopy of a tree or a shrub, while candle light brings romantic perfection. 

 A band, comprising a keyboard player and a saxophonist, play soft rock instrumental numbers at the far end of the pool. A neat bar stands at one end with wine glasses and champagne flutes strewn around, while an exclusive corner near the band, to be booked in advance, remains far from the hardly madding crowd. 

 The menu, which changes every year, is an eclectic mix of new recipes culled from other eateries in the hotel. ?We get queries and bookings almost a month prior to the restaurant opening each year. While Mongolian cuisine ruled the menu in 2002, Tex-Mex was the order last year. This year the theme is barbecue,? said chef Surinder Singh.

 The open kitchen dishes out a wide range of preparations. In the Continental section, the chef recommends Grilled Salmon with Asparagus and Black Olive Ragout accompanied with crisp seed potatoes, and the Roast Rack of Lamb with Shallot Wine Jus for non-vegetarians. While vegetarians are advised to dig into Potato Roesti with Shitake and Porccini Mushroom Ragout apart from the regular dishes. 

 For those who prefer to have a barbecue Indian style (aka tandoor items on a sizzler), there are a variety of options as well. For non-vegetarians, there is the Kalmi Shirazi, a char-grilled chicken mince and nut-stuffed drumstick preparation. Vegetarians would find the Khumb Galouti Kebab a good bet, which comprises velvety mushroom kebabs flavoured with special spices. 

 Wrap up with some sizzling Chocolate Passion with hot chocolate sauce and ice-cream. Melting in your mouth with a mix of hot and cold, it?ll keep you craving for more.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 How to spend a crore

 One fine day, you wake up to a crore, 

 a bonanza out of the blue. What would be your impulse buy? 

 What would be your savings plan? An opinion poll catches the 

 young Crorepati Calcuttan in action

 One fine day, you wake up to a 

 crore, a bonanza out of the blue. What would be your impulse 

 buy? What would be your savings plan? An opinion poll catches 

 the young Crorepati Calcuttan in action

 From buying a hill in Darjeeling 

 to bidding for Manchester United, bringing Michael Jackson 

 down for a show to booking an island in the Sunderbans, 

 buying a video camera to a Versace?

 If you harbour any doubts that 

 the young Calcuttan dreams big, but with one foot planted 

 firmly on the ground, all you have to do is ask one question: 

 what would you do if you woke up, one fine day, to a windfall 

 gain of Rs 1 crore?

 To understand the money minds 

 of 200 young men and women, in the age group of 15 to 20, 

 Metro on Sunday commissioned an opinion poll on the 

 One-Day Calcutta Crorepati.

 The result of the survey, conducted 

 by market research agency MODE in the festive first week 

 of November, throws up a mixed bag of options, a plethora 

 of piquant purchase plans and an entire spectrum of savings 

 strategies.

 But before dividing the booty 

 between buying and saving decisions, comes the moment of 

 reckoning. Over 65 per cent of respondents said ?screaming 

 in disbelief? would be their first reaction after hitting 

 a jackpot of Rs 1 crore.

 Once the vocal chords are weary, 

 it?s time to weave dreams. A whopping 83 per cent of respondents 

 said the surprise sum would trigger a spending spree.

 And a shopping basket way beyond 

 reality reach can suddenly be viewed through the binoculars 

 of bounty.

 Now, let?s pause at what the young 

 gang aspires to acquire. The survey reveals that when it 

 comes to spending, going international ? be it rack raid 

 or travel plans ? is the modern mantra.

 Topping the list of items (76 

 per cent) on which they would like to splurge are luxury 

 cars and the preference is clearly for the Porsche and the 

 Merc (what?s a Maruti, man?)

 Once in the driving seat, what?s 

 destination next for GeneratioNext? A world tour would be 

 just fine (for 73 per cent of respondents), with long hours 

 spent at swanky malls to shop till the power lasts in the 

 purse (71 per cent vote for upper crust designer dresses).

 World tour over, 64 per cent of 

 respondents would go for makaan after kapda, with 

 modern apartments a must. Tech talk loses out to the good 

 life with computers, video cameras and DVD players slipping 

 down the purchase pole.

 The opinion poll also traced some 

 out-of-the box dreams spun by the likes of Sanchita of Swinhoe 

 Street, Md Hussain of Entally, Monali of Jodhpur Park and 

 Alipi of Santoshpur.

 Their dream buys: a hill in Darjeeling, 

 a stake in Manchester United (the richest football club 

 in the world), an island in the Sunderbans and a live show 

 on home turf by the ultimate modern entertainer, Michael 

 Jackson.

 The decision on what to buy done, 

 let?s work out the budget and allocate funds under various 

 heads.

 The respondents were also asked 

 to mention their planned outlays on spending, saving and 

 charity. The result, after averaging the individual numbers, 

 is music to the banking and finance industry?s ears with 

 respondents trading off today?s fun with a safety net for 

 tomorrow.

 In a clear signal that the dream 

 run is on its last lap, come the safe deposits. Out of the 

 Rs 1 crore kitty, around Rs 50 lakh would end up being saved, 

 Rs 33 lakh would be spent and around 15 per cent would be 

 earmarked for charitable institutions like the Missionaries 

 of Charity and the Ramakrishna Mission.

 Fantasy spend, political correctness 

 and social commitment apart, there are a host of middle-path 

 investments and safe savings routes waiting to be walked.

 Even in an easy money scenario, 

 the preference to play it like Rahul Dravid rather than 

 Virender Sehwag is clear. Despite the bull run at the bourses 

 and the spiralling real estate prices, around 84 per cent 

 of the respondents prefer fixed deposits over investments 

 in the stock market and in property deals.

 With safety and security at the 

 top of the saving mind, it?s time to show dreams the door 

 and get real. Eighty per cent of respondents have never, 

 repeat never, tried their luck at lotteries, in the belief 

 that no pot of gold lies at the end of the reality rainbow.

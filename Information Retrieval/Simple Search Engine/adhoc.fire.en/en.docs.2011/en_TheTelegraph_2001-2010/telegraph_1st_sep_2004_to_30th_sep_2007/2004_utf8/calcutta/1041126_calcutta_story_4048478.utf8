The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

Reliance has given us lots of talk time (and we aren?t 

talking cell phones here). After all, rentals may be the same but gossip comes 

for free. Hook on to more of this as you go scandal surfing during that supper 

or sizzler snack.

Oh brother!

 After the rags to riches story, it?s time for the Ambanis to wash dirty linen 

in public, barely two years after founding father Dhirubhai?s demise. ?I?m sure 

it?s A who is at the root of all this. Older brother M seems like such a good 

boy. No wonder he was daddy?s favourite,? could be one end of the rift squeal. 

?Give me A any day. He?s as cool as M?s stuffy,? could be the other. With the 

T vs N melancholy wives of Mumbai tale also unfolding as a sub-plot and a showgirl 

squeezed in between the Reliance princes, what a pot-pourri! Biz, brothers and 

Bollywood! 

Test run

After the Aussie assault and a Pakistani punch, Indian 

cricket finally hit level ground at the Kanpur test against South Africa. A draw 

may be better than a loss for optimists, but it?s a good idea to put it down to 

the guests leaving the best of their bowlers behind to sound more in the know. 

Keeping your fingers crossed ? and a ticket handy for an Indian hurrah ? is the 

way to be in the run-up to the forthcoming match at our Eden, starting Sunday.

Comedy kick

It?s time for some laughter again. The master of modern 

day comedy Priyadarshan is back with another laugh riot, Hulchul, where 

the talented Akshaye Khanna pairs up for the first time with Kareena Kapoor. A 

series of talented character actors in the form of Jackie Shroff, Suniel Shetty, 

Paresh Rawal and Arbaaz Khan make the film a must watch. Time for more hungama...

Wedding bells

If it?s not chiming in your courtyard, it could be 

across the road. The wedding season is on in full swing and chances are most of 

you will end up going ethnic rather than noodle strapping this weekend. Don?t 

fret if you haven?t been invited to any as yet. Exchanging notes on who ditched 

whom to hitch with whom can be as much fun as doing balle balle from Amritsar 

to LA!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Remix rage to classic comfort

The 

weekend saw some high-voltage action at Big Ben with guest DJ Akbar Sami of Jalwa 

fame. The Mumbai man rocked the house with his brand of remixes as he took to 

the console post-midnight. 

 ?I brought DJ-ing to India at a time when nobody was aware of the concept,? bragged the table turner while taking a break between the Raat Bakis and Jalwas. 

 This break though, wasn?t as long as his four-year absence from the console, for which he had a ready explanation. ?After Jalwa hit bull?s eye, every Joe in town wanted to be a DJ. So, I decided to stand back and watch the fun,? chuckled Sami, who will be releasing his next album in November.

 Batik bouquet

 If you haven?t had enough of the drape drill yet, there?s another option in town. Shampa Mukherji, an English teacher in Modern High School-turned-fashion designer is offering a range of saris in tussar, crepe, silk and cotton in essentially bright colours from her P-203, Lake Terrace Extension address. 

 Priced between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,500, her collection portrays a variety of batik prints along with hand-painted traditional motifs. The creations displayed at an exhibition at Chowringhee Terrace recently won the new designer rave reviews. 

 Stroke to note

 Art connoisseurs experienced a delectable treat at Akar Prakar?s exhibition at the ITC Sonar Bangla art gallery on Saturday. Paintings by renowned artists like Shuvaprasanna, Paritosh Sen, Somnath Hore, Sushmit Biswas, Ganesh Pyne and Bhaskar Lahiri among others were on display at an exhibition-cum-sale. 

 Adding to the repertoire were musical recitals by Arnab Chakrabarty on sarod, Biplab Bhattacharyya on tabla and Somnath Roy on ghatam, that kept a select audience suitably entertained.

 Cops in dark over murder 

 - Sleuths see killer links with gangs in city, districts

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Two days have passed since Shibpur-based businessman Sekhar Roy was shot dead in broad daylight by a gang of unidentified men on a flyover leading to Vidyasagar Setu. 

 The police are yet to make a headway in the case. 

 The needle of suspicion points towards four persons, including Narayan Khatua, who was accompanying Roy on Tuesday morning.

 Senior officers of Howrah police said a combing operation was on for the killers.

 ?The special operation group of Howrah police has conducted several raids in and around the district in the past 48 hours,? said a police officer on the case. 

 However, the motive of the murder was still unclear, he added.

 Though district police officers had claimed on Wednesday that Roy was murdered by criminals operating within the district, they are now trying to find out whether the murderers have links with gangs in Calcutta and other adjoining districts.

 The sleuths suspect the gang has links in Calcutta, Salt Lake, North 24-Parganas and South 24-Parganas.

 Khatua, Roy?s driver Raj Kumar Mondal, and local youths Mohan and Joydeb have been interrogated for several hours at various police stations in connection with the case. 

 ?They are making incoherent statements, which are not in line with the information and clues our officers have gathered during investigation,? said one of the sleuths. 

 The gang that killed Roy snatched a bag containing Rs 4.5 lakh and a cheque for Rs 1.5 lakh from Khatua, who was riding pillion on Roy?s two-wheeler. 

 ?Khatua was injured during the robbery, but surprisingly, the murderers did not cause him any harm,? the officer pointed out. ?We are attaching a great deal of importance to this point.? 

 Superintendent of Howrah police Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya said: ?We want to leave no stone unturned in our probe into the murder.? He, however, refused to divulge details. 

 Inspector-general (South Bengal) V. Mishra visited Howrah on Thursday morning to inquire about the case and held a meeting with superintendent Bhattacharya. 

 ?We are investigating the case, but so far, there has been no major development,? Mishra admitted.

 Mamata Star war rued

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mamata Banerjee?s decision to stay away from the inaugural programme of the new-look Star Theatre on October 13 has triggered a controversy among Trinamul Congress functionaries. 

 Several of them, including some mayor-in-council members of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), on Tuesday resented the manner in which Mamata had declined to accept the invitation simply because she would not like to share a dais with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee confirmed Mamata?s rejection of the invitation on Tuesday: ?She has refused to participate in the inaugural programme, though the invitation letter was sent to her a long time ago.?

 Mayor-in-council members like Pradip Ghosh, Moyn-ul-Haque Chowdhury and Samsuzzaman Ansari and chairman of borough XIII Sushanta Ghosh openly supported the mayor?s stand. 

 On the other hand, mayor-in-council members like Anup Chatterjee and Mala Roy rued the fact that the mayor had not discussed the issue in the mayor-in-council meeting before dashing off the invitation to the chief minister.

 ?The government should have taken the initiative to revive the theatre, but it did not. The mayor proved the civic board is capable of refurbishing the theatre on its own. Hence, we must invite the chief minister to the programme,? reasoned Pradip Ghosh. 

 A key party functionary said Mamata should shun her ?narrow politics? and instead, join the programme.

 Star Theatre, on Bidhan Sarani, was closed down in 1991 after a devastating fire. Later, the CMC took up the Rs 15-crore rejuvenation project.

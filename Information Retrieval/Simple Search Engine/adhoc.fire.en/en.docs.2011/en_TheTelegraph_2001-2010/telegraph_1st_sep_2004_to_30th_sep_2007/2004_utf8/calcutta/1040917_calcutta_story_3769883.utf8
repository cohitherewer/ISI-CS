The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 M.F. Husain Success is yours in dealings 

with people of authority. You are optimistic and have the positive energy to carve 

success for yourself. You may grow restless with the material world. You prefer 

solitude to company. Classical dance and music inspire you. A remarkable memory 

for names and faces is a great asset. ? Kusum Bhandari

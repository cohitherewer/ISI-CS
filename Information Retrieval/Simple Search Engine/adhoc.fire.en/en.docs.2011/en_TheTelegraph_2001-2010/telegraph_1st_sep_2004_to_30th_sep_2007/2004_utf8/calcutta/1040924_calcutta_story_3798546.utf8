 33 arrests in hooch hangover

 Five more persons were arrested on Thursday in overnight raids on illegal country liquor shops in Dum Dum and the airport area, where over a dozen people died after consuming hooch last week. The total number of arrests in the case has gone up to 33.

 Thursday?s arrest list reads: Biswajit Pal (alias Bishu), Satyajit Pal (alias Tinku), Manas Sarkar, Gouranga Sarkar and one of his accomplices. All of them were involved in the country liquor business. 

 ?These people are linked to the gang that collects empty bottles from registered liquor shops and fills them with locally-made hooch, flavoured with the scent of country spirit,? explained Chayan Mukherjee, inspector-general of police (law and order).

 ?When we raided the house of Gouranga Sarkar, in Dum Dum?s Joalpara area, we came across men lacing a liquid in large jars with scent. We seized several empty bottles, caps, vending machines and label printers,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas). 

 Manas Sarkar, according to police, played a pivotal role in the racket.

 Sources said he would often approach country spirit shops of the locality with the proposal of supplying cheap liquor. ?The shops found his rates very attractive, and fell for the stuff he would offer,? a police officer said.

 Residents alleged that Manas could not have carried out his operation for such a long time without the patronage of a section of local police and politicians. 

 ?If you look at the spread of the illegal trade, you?ll realise it could not have flourished without the blessings of local politicians and the cops. We had informed police several times about Manas? activities, but in vain,? said Srihir Bhattacharjee, chairman of South Dum Dum municipality.

 On condition of anonymity, an officer admitted that a section of local politicians had often prevented the police from acting against the racket.

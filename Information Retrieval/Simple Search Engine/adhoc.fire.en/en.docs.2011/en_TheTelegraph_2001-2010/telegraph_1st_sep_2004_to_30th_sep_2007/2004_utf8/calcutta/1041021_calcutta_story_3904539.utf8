The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Myriad moments of mirth and melancholy

 The city has just witnessed a high-profile shoot involving Abhishek Bachchan and Soha Ali Khan for Antarmahal, where the mother figure is central to the plot. Without giving much away, all we can say is that daughter Soha makes the perfect modern-day Durga for Rituparno Ghosh four decades after mother Sharmila was Satyajit Ray?s Devi. On Mahashtami, Metro relives some enduring screen moments from recent memory woven around the goddess. 

 Joy Baba Felunath

 For Satyajit Ray?s suave sleuth with a hyperactive magajastra, there?s no respite even when he?s holidaying with cousin Topshe and writer friend Jatayu. A Bengali family based in Benares has lost a priceless image of Ganesha and the man of the house asks Feluda to fish it out. With a few days to go for Durga puja, the family gears up for the festivity while an artisan moulds the goddess in the courtyard. The artisan is murdered, leaving Feluda to grapple with a jigsaw puzzle, arch rival Maganlal Meghraj and a shady sadhu.

 Crucial moment: Feluda?s (Soumitra Chatterjee) brainwave in cracking the dadu-nati code, ?Ganeshta achhe Africar rajar kachhe?.

 Anusandhan

 The Bengali version of Barsaat Ki Ek Raat finds Amitabh Bachchan busting a smuggling racket run by Utpal Dutt and Amjad Khan in a picturesque hill station, but not before bumping into blind heroine Rakhee. Durga puja in this pastoral tea garden is symbolic of the good triumphing over the evil. 

 Crucial moment: Villain Kaliram?s (Amjad) dhol bursts while in musical combat with ?lamboo? at the pandal setting the tone for the big fight. 

 Utsab

 A family reunion is at the core of the Rituparno Ghosh film with Durga puja being the ruse. As the sons and daughters of Sumitra get together for the festivities, hidden tensions and concealed conflicts surface with a simmering intensity. Eldest daughter Mamata Shankar shudders at the repeat of her incestuous relationship with cousin Dipankar De as son Ratul gets close to Arpita Pal. The setting is a grand old barowari puja, the mood pregnant with possibilities.

 Crucial moment: Youngest daughter Rituparna?s estranged husband Prosenjit returns to her as the women engaged in sindoorkhela stop in shock.

 Devdas

 The story is best not repeated. But for the uninitiated, the third Hindi celluloid version of the Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay classic has an elaborate Durga puja underway at Aishwarya Paro Rai?s in-laws, while Shah Rukh Devdas Khan inches towards death, bottle in hand. The puja sequence in this Sanjay Leela Bhansali magnum opus kicks off with malkin Ash paying a visit to courtesan Madhuri Chandramukhi Dixit for a handful of mitti.

 Crucial moment: Dola re dola... the dramatic song-and-dance sequence that deviated from the original, brought Paro and Chandramukhi together, broke barriers and box-office records.

 Daman

 What started off as a bold statement on marital rape fizzles out within an hour, but carry on, if patience permits, for the triumph of wife power over the devil disguised as husband. Shayaji Shinde leaves wife Raveena Tandon on the wedding night for a prostitute and later in a grotesque parody of woman power he paints her face like Durga before raping her. What follows is a lone woman?s struggle for survival with teen daughter Raima Sen in tow.

 Crucial moment: The penultimate scene when Raveena drives a dagger into her husband?s chest, with the bhashan imagery unfolding in the background.

 Paroma

 The archetypal struggle of a woman confined to a social comfort zone that does nothing to sustain her soul. The dramatic entry of a stranger into a life so well set raises a storm that forces protagonist Rakhee to confront truths about her self and her life. With director Aparna Sen playing a crucial cameo as Paroma?s confidante, the film drew critical acclaim for the treatment of womanhood and popular flak for sensationalisation.

 Crucial moment: Paroma fills the screen in a white sari with red border, sindoor emblazed on forehead in the foreground, with Goddess Durga in soft focus behind her. She is a woman deified, defiled and finally, rediscovered.

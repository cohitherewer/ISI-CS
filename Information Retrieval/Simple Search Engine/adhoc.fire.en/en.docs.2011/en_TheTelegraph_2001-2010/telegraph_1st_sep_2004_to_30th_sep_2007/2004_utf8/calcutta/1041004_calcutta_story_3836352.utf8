The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Doctored car fuel drives the market

 OUR BUREAU

 The city is in the grip of a spurious fuel racket, which is also partly responsible for the spurt in road accidents. 

 The spiked petrol and diesel, mixed with other substances, are sold at rates much lower than the sanctioned prices from makeshift stalls near autorickshaw and bus stands. When pumped into a vehicle?s oil tank, the fuel affects the carburettor and the engine.

 ?Yes, the racket does exist,? admitted superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta. ?At times, district enforcement branch officers raid the stalls, seize adulterated oil and arrest the culprits,? he added.

 In the south, the racket?s reach extends from Garia to Jadavpur and Behala. Stalls selling spurious fuel can be seen in Regent Park, Thakurpukur, Kasba, Baruipur and Bishnupur. 

 In the north, Dum Dum, Baguiati and Lake Town are among the places that figure on the racket map.

 Petroleum ministry officials, too, are aware of the racket. But they say they have little to do to put an end to it. 

 ?Our duty is to deliver oil to depots and retail outlets and our officials make sure that there is no pilferage up to that point. Beyond that, we are not responsible,? said Dipankar Kumar Roy, chief divisional retail sales manager (Calcutta division), Indian Oil Corporation. 

 Cocking a snook at the proverbial long arm of the law, the racketeers themselves boast of their booming business. ?Police are aware of our outlets,? said Madhai Das, who has a stall at the Garia autorickshaw stand. 

 ?Without their cooperation, we would not be able to earn our daily bread,? he added, sarcasm dripping from his voice. 

 When the price of a litre of petrol crossed Rs 42 at registered outlets, the racketeers sold the fuel at Rs 30 a litre. Similarly, when the diesel price was pegged at Rs 27-plus a litre, people could have it from the illegal stalls at Rs 22.

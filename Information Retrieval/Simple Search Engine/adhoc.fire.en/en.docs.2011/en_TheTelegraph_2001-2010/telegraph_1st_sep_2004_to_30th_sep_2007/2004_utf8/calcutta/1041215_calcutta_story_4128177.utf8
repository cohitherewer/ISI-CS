The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CU scurry for speedy results

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A Supreme Court directive to the state Higher Secondary council has set Calcutta University (CU) working overtime to expedite the process of publication of the results of all major under-graduate exams.

 The university will take a string of measures to ensure that the results of BA, B.Sc and B.Com (Parts I and II) are declared early.

 The move will enable students to seek admission to post-graduate courses in other universities, especially those outside the state.

 ?Starting next year, we will try to announce the results of all Part II under-graduate exams by the first week of July,? Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic), told Metro on Tuesday.

 ?The examination department is in a scurry to achieve the target. And if we are successful, many of our students who want to pursue post-graduate courses in other states will benefit,? he added. 

 The usual practice of the university is to announce the results of under-graduate Part II examinations towards the end of August, when admissions to post-graduate courses in most universities in other states are complete. 

 In its order to the Higher Secondary council, the apex court had observed that the results of the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations are announced long after the results of equivalent examinations in other states are declared.

 Such a system prevents a large number of students from seeking admission to subsequent courses in other states. The Supreme Court had asked the council to ensure that the Higher Secondary results are announced by June 10.

 CU controller of examinations Onkar Sadhan Adhikari said that in order to expedite the process of the publication of results, spot valuation will be given more emphasis. 

 In this system, teachers will have to assemble at a spot and assess the answer-scripts together. 

 That apart, the university is planning to advance the date on which under-graduate examinations begin from 2006. ?In fact, we will set the ball rolling from next year. The Part II exams in 2005 will start on April 12. Till this year, the exams never commenced before the third week of April,? Adhikari added.

 The authorities are also trying to rope in as many teachers as possible for the evaluation process. The university requires more than 10,000 teachers for examining around two million answer-scripts of 1.60 lakh-odd examinees.

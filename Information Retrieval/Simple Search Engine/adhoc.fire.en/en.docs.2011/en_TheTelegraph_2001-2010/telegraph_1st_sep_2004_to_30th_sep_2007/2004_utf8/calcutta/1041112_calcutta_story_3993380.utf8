 Simply Kali, in search of new look

 Elokeshi, Raktachamunda, Durgakali, Akali, Hajar haat, Shoroshi, Chhinnomasta... If theme is what makes Durga puja in Calcutta, variety of form is the name of the Kali puja game. And it is all happening in a small area in south Calcutta, bordered by Chetla bridge on one side and Keoratala crematorium on the other.

 This is the heartland of Kali puja in Calcutta, with a pandal, or the entrance to its serpentine alley, beckoning at the pandal-hopper every couple of feet apart. And no two pujas worship the same form of the Dark Mother.

 ?The Kalighat-Chetla belt has a tradition of Kali puja. It was the hotbed of dacoits years ago who worshipped the Goddess before every marauding venture. The presence of the Kali temple and the crematorium adds to the mystique of the area,? explains Tapan Augusti of ABS Sporting Club, which is worshipping a Shwet Kali for the 30th year. White in colour, the idol has a trishul and dugdugi in hand while an ox sits at her feet in place of the fox in the traditional form. 

 Close by, on the approach to New Alipore bridge, the trail starts off with Chamunda and Singhabahini flanking each other. The first, in its 57th year, worships the Mother in the moment of the destruction of the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha in an ambience of a burning ghat with psychedelic lights. The second, an effort of Debabrata Smriti Sangha, has the Devi on a lion in a riverside temple, with Ramakrishna being welcomed at the ghat.

 Then as one takes a turn into Chetla along Peary Mohan Roy Road, the show begins. Chetla Sarbasadharaner Kali Puja, which worships Dashmahabidya (or the 10 forms Sati had shown Lord Siva when he was refusing her permission to visit her parents for the yagna) stands apart with a Rs 2-lakh budget. The 90-year-old puja comes second only to Sahanagar Keoratala Swansan Kali puja, which is completing 130. 

 Most others are small and recent ventures, drawing visitors with their novel names. 

 Such is the peer pressure that pujas which had started off worshipping the traditional Shyama Kali are shifting to ?unique? forms. And since forms mentioned in the scriptures have already been ?booked? by older pujas, those in search of a new look are resorting to other sources. 

 Chetla Prabhat Sangha?s Adi Chamunda was inspired by a picture on the wall of a neighbouring saloon. 

 Many, however, resort to sheer flights of fancy.

 The CMDA complex on Chetla Haat Road has seven buildings and hosts as many as four Kali pujas. All four worship different forms ? Chandraghanta, Tara, Nataraj and Jangla Adi Kali. ?We imagined this form when we decided to switch from our traditional idol six years ago,? says a volunteer at the Nataraj Kali pandal.

 Chetla Pranab Sangha is another example. Organising Kali puja since 1970, the boys decided on a new model two years back. ?We took the advice of the priest in Murshidabad?s Palshanda village where Sati?s crown had fallen. The goddess there is a simple block of stone. But the Kiriteshwari Kali here (just the head of the goddess with a huge crown) is our imagination,? says club secretary Bubai Saha.

 Sports may act as an inspiration too. A group of 20 Mohun Bagan supporters has started the Sabuj-Merun Kali puja. Housed in an alley featuring the Mohun Bagan XI on the walls, the idol is painted in the club colours. ?The Durand Cup loss yesterday spoilt a lot of our plans,? rued Nirmal Ghosh.

 The search for novelty may lead to the ridiculous. The Hanuman Kali, making a debut in the Matalibagan alley this year, stands testimony to that scary eventuality, complete with its long bushy tail.

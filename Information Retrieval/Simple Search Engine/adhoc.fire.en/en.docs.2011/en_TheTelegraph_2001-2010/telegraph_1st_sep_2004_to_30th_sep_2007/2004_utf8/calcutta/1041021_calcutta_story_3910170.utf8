The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Quintet amp; the crowd

From Tarzan to Krishna, from guess-the-theme to no theme 

? there are popularity points aplenty as Calcutta goes pandal-hopping, here, there 

and everywhere. Backed by police figures, Metro pauses at five favourite 

footfall spots and figures out what makes them the top draws this October

Mohammad Ali Park, 36th year

The twin-flavoured pandal sees the exterior modelled 

on the Royal Albert Museum in Jaipur and the interior done up like Sheesh Mahal, 

also in Jaipur. The idol scores here, with people from all religions surrounding 

Durga, praying to her to put an end to terrorism around the world. Picture by 

Pabitra Das

College Square, 57th year

The rush reason is a pandal modelled on the Cooch 

Behar Rajbari. Light attractions include comic-strip characters like Chacha Chowdhury, 

Tarzan and space expeditions. The idol is traditional. Picture by Pabitra Das

Jodhpur Park, 52nd year

The brilliant golden idol is drawing in the hordes 

to a puja that looks ?beyond theme, back to the roots?. The simple temple that 

houses the goddess has an adjoining chamber, with a lived-in look. Picture by 

Pradip Sanyal

Santosh Mitra Square, 69th year 

The gimmicky contest is the main draw. Guess what 

the pandal is modelled on and win a diamond ring or necklace, on Dashami. The 

Himalaykanya idol, Nabadurga paintings and kaantha-stitch decoration add 

to the appeal. Picture by Pabitra Das

Telengabagan, 39th year 

The theme is Sri Krishna?s Durga puja in Brindavan. 

The walls have painted scenes from Krishna?s life, while a separate natmandap 

has a revolving podium with clay figures on it. No fancy lighting here. Picture

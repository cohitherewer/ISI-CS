 Hafiz can?t speak Bengali or Hindi. Shibshankar can?t speak English. But the two are best of friends, overcoming national, cultural and linguistic barriers. 

 Hafiz is part of a group of nursing students from Singapore helping Shibshankar and the other people of Uttar Gobindapur to improve their lives. ?There was a translator, but a lot of times we couldn?t talk. But the people were very friendly and we bonded, working together every day. Shibshankar was good fun. We got along really well,? smiles Hafiz.

 A group of 28 ? eight boys and 20 girls, including one teacher ? from Singapore Nurses Association had spent two weeks in Kakdwip, working on development programmes in the village, from health check-up camps to HIV/AIDS awareness campaign, cultural exchange to first-aid training. But the main project was gifting a tubewell to the villagers.

 ?We did all the work, including digging,? says group leader Gan. ?It gives them a sense of ownership, because it belongs to them, not the government. They have to pay 10 per cent of the cost. There is now a committee to maintain it.?

 The Calcutta-end of the programme was organised by the NGO Indian Institute of Training and Development, which has extensive projects in Kakdwip. The students, for most of whom it was a first-time experience, were from Nanyang Polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education. They had to ?rough it out? for two weeks (December 6 to 19) but had ?great fun? and are ?very sad? to leave. 

 Spending noisy nights on the floor in sleeping bags and cold water baths in the morning to frequent toilet trips from eating too spicy food was difficult. But the people made up for it. ?They are very poor, but very generous. They made laddoos for us,? recalls Lin.

 Sisters Indumathi and Kossila had a great time singing and dancing for the girls of Sunderban Balika Vidyalaya and the boys of Kakdwip Shishu Shikshayatan, and having the kids do the same for them. And they learnt from sitting in on a panchayat meeting and interacting with the SDO, BDO and the sabhapati. But most of all, they enjoyed being with the villagers. ?We hope to come back,? signed off teacher Vivien.

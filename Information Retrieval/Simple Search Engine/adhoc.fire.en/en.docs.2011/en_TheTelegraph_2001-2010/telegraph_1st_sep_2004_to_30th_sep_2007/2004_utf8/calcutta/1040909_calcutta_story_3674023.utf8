 Irradiation aid for added area sullage

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is planning to introduce the atomic irradiation technique of treating sullage in the added areas of Behala, Jadavpur and Garden Reach. It will replace the existing system of dumping raw sewage into outflow channels.

 The scheme will be implemented as part of the Rs 1,245-crore Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, backed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

 In the absence of an underground sewer network, house-owners in the added areas were required to construct septic tanks on their premises.

 With a Rs 730-crore underground sewer scheme now in place, the civic authorities have decided to link every household drain with the network. The accumulated sullage will be pumped out into outflow channels at Chowbhaga, Charial Khal and Monikhali. 

 ?An underground sewer is a new concept for residents of the added areas. These areas, unlike the city proper, also lack the scope for natural recycling of sewage in the bheris. We have to work out something to prevent release of raw sewage directly into the outflow channels,? said mayor Subrata Mukherjee. He has asked municipal commissioner Debashis Som to carry out a feasibility study of the atomic irradiation technology.

 Sludge Hygienisation Research Irradiator (SHRI), the key component of this technology, is developed by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) for hygienisation of urban sewage. In this process, raw sewage is stored in tanks in pumping stations, from where the sludge is collected. After an isotopic treatment through regulated atomic radiation, the sludge is made free of harmful bacteria and can be used as manure.

 ?I think it?ll help us keep the outflow channels clean,? mayor Mukherjee added. 

 Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar, who?s ?expecting a positive response from the civic body?, said radio isotope-based products and services are available through the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology. 

 The SHRI unit is offered to civic bodies at an affordable price. The authorities can recover the cost by selling the manure. 

 In Vadodara, where the system has been successful, the cost of production of irradiated manure is Rs 1.5 a kg, Kakodkar added.

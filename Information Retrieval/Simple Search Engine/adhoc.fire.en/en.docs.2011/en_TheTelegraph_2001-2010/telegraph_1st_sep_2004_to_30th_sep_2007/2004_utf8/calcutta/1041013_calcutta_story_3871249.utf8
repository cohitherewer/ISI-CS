 Ray of inspiration in blocks of stone

 He finds the sun and inspiration in the galis of Calcutta. In his eyes, sari-clad Bengali women look like Greek goddesses. He speaks no English but breaks easily into the tune of Mera joota hai Japani.

 With magnificent works displayed all over the world ? Greece to Toronto ? Armenian sculptor Levon Tokmajyam, on his first visit to India, is in Calcutta to add his own touch to the city?s diverse art palette.

 The sculptor has been holed up in a makeshift studio on Mirza Ghalib Street, where at the request of the Armenian government, he has been busy sculpting a marble bust of Arutyun Shmavonyan, the founder of the first Armenian language press in India. 

 Dressed casually in shorts and faded T-shirt, the 67-year-old?s face breaks into a wrinkled smile that reaches out beyond language barriers, as he speaks through interpreter Henrik about the charm that Calcutta holds for him.

 Inside the white-washed studio, fashioned out of a garage at the Armenian College on Mirza Ghalib Street, Tokmajyam is in his elements. While the huge piece of sculpture lies on the ground, the diminutive artist picks up chunks of marble and smiles gleefully at visitors, trying to tell them how he would like to shape the block of stone. ?When I looked at the scraps left from the huge marble block used for the bust, I saw the Calcutta sun in them and felt inspired,? says Tokmajyam.

 ?I love the natural ways of life. The Calcutta just outside my studio has shown me enough of the happiness and pain that lie within the intrinsic fabric of simple life,? adds the sculptor. And his exhibits are proof of this inspiration ? sculptures of a rickshaw-puller (down to the beads of sweat trickling down his face), to a worn-out face of Mother Teresa and Indian women in saris.

 ?I have met many artists all over the globe. But nowhere else in the world have I come across such helpful sculptors like the ones in Calcutta. Tapas Sarkar, for one, has become like a brother to me over the past few days,? says Tokmajyam. He is scheduled to be back to the city in December for the inauguration of his work.

 Sarkar, a sculptor himself, realised how the city would be missing the Armenian?s work on seeing Tokmajyam work on the bust. ?When I thought of this exhibition, he readily made over 15 exclusive pieces based on his experiences in the city,? said Sarkar. 

 Now that the work is almost over, Tokmajyam is ?feeling relaxed? and looking for people to take him out to ?feel the real throbbing heart of the city and usher in new inspiration?.

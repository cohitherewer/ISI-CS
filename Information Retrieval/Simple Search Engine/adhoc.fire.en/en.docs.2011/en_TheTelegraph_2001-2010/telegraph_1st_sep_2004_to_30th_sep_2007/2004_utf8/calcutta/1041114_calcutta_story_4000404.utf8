 Someone else at SPE

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Aziz Ibrahim 

 The samajhdars were all 

 there, expecting a fusion fiesta they?d shake their glasses 

 to and cheer on. But in the end, Aziz Ibrahim and Dalbir 

 Singh Rattan?s brand of Asian Blues left the crowd a little 

 more than disappointed.

 The venue: Saturday evening 

 at Someplace Else. Word had spread about the programme featuring 

 a celebrity guitarist from the UK ?who has played with Simply 

 Red and Stone Roses?. Simply Red okay, Stone Roses who? 

 Never mind.

 In attendance were Skinny Alley, Neil Dutt, the Violin Brothers and more of the musical fraternity. The denim clad, spaghetti-top young crowd was matched in equal number by sari, kurta and slightly older looks. 

 Full marks to the assembled, though, for trying their mightiest best to like and appreciate the music. But more often than not, attention lapsed as groups drifted into conversation mid-song, sometimes drawing a quip or rap from the guitarist himself.

 The duo doggedly stuck to their own music, performing tracks from their little-known album Lahore to Longsight. Mostly instrumentals and strictly no covers. Wrap-up, a little after 10 pm, was early by SPE standards.

 ?We?ve run out of songs,? Aziz confessed over the microphone. Most of the samajhdars had walked out by then anyway. An enthusiastic young crowd politely asked for an encore, which was met with another instrumental.

 Soon after, it was a ?thank you and goodnight? from the band, and back to the comfort of recorded music for the pubbers still hanging on.

 Quick quiz: Who described 

 Aziz Ibrahim?s stint in the Stone Roses as the ?toughest 

 job in the world?? Noel Gallagher of Oasis, no less.

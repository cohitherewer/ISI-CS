The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Skirt to sari, dual roles of twin realities

 Ami bhabteo parini prithibi samparke tomra ato kom jano (I couldn?t imagine you know so little about the world),? Sameera Reddy exclaims with a stern face and turns to Buddhadeb Dasgupta. ?Is this amount of irritation okay?? Absolutely fine, comes the reply. 

Dasgupta is visibly satisfied with the sincerity that 

the J. Lo of Bollywood exudes as she mouths her Bengali lines and gets the right 

expressions of a teacher scolding her class.

 ?Every night after shooting, I sit for two-three hours to mug up my lines for the next day. It?s an alien language and I have to understand each and every word to emote,? smiles Rahul Bose?s screen wife and a mother of two. 

 In indigo blue cotton sari, hair tied back in a bun and black bindi on forehead, Sameera looks the perfect Bangali bou that Dasgupta was desperately looking for while picking his cast.

 ?More than playing a mother or a wife, I think the challenge lies in getting the body language of my character right. I am in saris all the time and wear no make-up. I even broke off my nails. I had to drop my glam look and be messy and even learn the way women here walk in saris,? she adds. 

 ?And there was no time for homework. Two weeks after signing the project, I started shooting. So, Rajeshwari (Dasgupta?s elder daughter) would sit with me in between dubbing for Musafir and shooting for Benaam with the script.? 

 On the sets, screen-hubby Rahul has proved to be ?a helping hand? with his knowledge of the language. ?Besides, having shot for the past three weeks, I am very confident now. I play an ambitious and strong woman who wants to rise,? she asserts.

 In between the scene arrangements at the Salt Lake school, where the Kaalpurush team camped for most of Sunday, the girls and their mothers huddled around Sameera for autographs. But all the trouble is worth it as this youngest of the Reddy sisters is raring to stand out with her histrionics. So, an appeal of a different exposure and a regard for the director prompted her to grab the project. ?I have seen Charachar and a few other films too. There?s a sense of reality in dada?s films that I love very much,? she adds.

 But that?s another kind of reality altogther. In the offing is Sanjay Gupta?s Musafir, which is riding high on the hype surrounding Sameera?s sizzling role. ?It?s nothing like that. In fact, everybody is getting it wrong. I play a traumatised married woman who tries to break out of the trap. I am glamorous in this film, but I don?t colour my hair or wear coloured glasses for that. The story is very real and so is my character,? says she. Yet the lip-lock scene with Anil Kapoor did ruffle her in the beginning. ?I was very worried and shy. But now, when I look back, I feel it was done in a very classy way.?

 On the floors is Anees Bazmi?s Benaam which finds her starring alongside Ajay Devgan. It?s an action-packed thriller with few songs and dances. ?I am on the run with Ajay here,? chirps Sameera, taking a quick look in the mirror. Mention the complete role reversal awaiting her in the week ahead and the sombre face lights up in a smile. 

 BBC has chosen her for a cultural exchange programme alongside Emma Bunton of Spice Girls. As part of the project, Sameera will stay put in London for five days to get clued into Emma?s lifestyle just as Baby Spice had a taste of the Bollywood girl?s routine on a recent trip to Mumbai.

 ?I had the entire plan chalked out for Emma, right from dressing up in Rocky S designs, meeting the press and Bollywood directors, and attending filmi bashes. She even made a guest appearance in a Hindi film. Now it?s my turn,? gushes Sameera. ?BBC wanted someone bubbly and without attitude who could portray Bollywood in the west and I was selected from among all the new actresses.?

 So on the London agenda is a probable dressing up in Prada clothes, meeting up celebs and the press, attending the dos, plus a guest appearance in a serial or a film. 

 ?I would like to meet the Queen and Prince Charles, too. But I don?t think that?s going to happen,? she breaks into a giggle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All in the stars amp; stakes

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

CRYSTAL 

BALL

AROUND 10 local Bengali channels featuring astrologers, Feng 

Shui advisers and tantriks

 PAY between Rs 2-5 lakh per month 

to MSOs

 FOR a prime place on the cable 

network

 RAKING IN Rs 5,000-10,000 per 

hour from anchors

 PUSHING OUT popular kids, sports 

and news channels 

After the saas-bahu soaps, it?s the stars (not of the Smriti Irani kind) that are ruling the small screen. From Tallah to Tollygunge, Baguiati to Ballygunge, ?special channels? annexed by astrologers, Feng Shui advisers and even tantriks are often pushing out popular picks.

 If CTVN, Fortune, Channel Vision, Sonar Bangla vs Channel V, Ten Sports, Pogo, CNN sounds like a no contest, it is. The Bengali brigade is beating the high-profile beams hollow.

 The cause lies in the cash. ?These channels pay anything between Rs 2 and 5 lakh a month to multi-system operators (MSOs) as carriage fee for a spot on their network,? reveals an industry source. ?For placement in the prime band, they shell out a premium.?

 The prime band is considered lucrative by broadcasters for its availability on almost every TV set, including the basic black-and-white ones that still find a significant presence in Calcutta households.

 On an average, such a free-to-air channel spends around Rs 10 lakh in placement fees alone. ?Usually, there are six hours of live shows and astrologers pay around Rs 5,000-10,000 per hour to the channels. Also, half-hour and one-hour slots are sold at Rs 4,000-5,000 for music videos and other entertainment content,? adds an industry insider.

 As phones refuse to remain silent on the live shows ? with queries ranging from day-to-day dilemmas to career choices to marriage moves ? it?s easy to cash in on a star-struck city. Astrologers and soothsayers ? in Rajneesh-style robes or working clothes ? play to the lowest common denominator galleries, day in and night out.

 Viewers left with no option

 The MSOs and the channels are not too keen to discuss rates and fees. quot;We hardly feature such programmes? the others do, quot; says one. quot;Our earnings cant be shared with the public, quot; offers another.

 quot;There is nothing wrong in taking carriage fee for free-to-air channels, quot; feels a city MSO representative. quot;And we ensure that the cable operator receives all channels from us. quot;

 Try telling that to the viewer denied. quot;I want all the sports channels, but my cable operator leaves out one or the other, slipping in one of those astrological channels, instead, quot; complains an advertising executive of Lake Town.

 quot;I like Channel V but for my operator thats niche, not seen by many and so replaceable, quot; rues a student in Rani-kuthi.

 The problem lies between the service provider and the end user. MSOs may be offering 70-80 channels, but most last-mile operators do not regularly update their infrastructure to increase capacity required to accommodate the new channels. As a result, viewers either do not get channels placed in higher bands like UHF at all or get them grainy.

 Not all channels, however, are willing to toe the horoscope line. quot;We do not air such programmes as a matter of principle, quot; says Abhijit Dasgupta of Bangla Ekhon. quot;Sex, sensationalism and scandal used to sell on TV, now its superstition. Its the easiest way to make money, quot; he points out.

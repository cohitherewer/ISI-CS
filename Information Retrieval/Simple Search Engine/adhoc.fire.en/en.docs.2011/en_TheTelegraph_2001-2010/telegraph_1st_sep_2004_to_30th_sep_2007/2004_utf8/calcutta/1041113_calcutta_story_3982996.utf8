The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Long-distance train passengers often take the advice of porters and stand at 

a spot on the platform to board a particular compartment. But on several occasions, 

the train, after coming to a halt, once again readjusts its position. The passengers 

are caught unawares and it causes a commotion. Can?t the trains stop at a designated 

spot immediately on entering the station?

 B.N. Bose, Dum Dum. 

 Baureah is just a few kilometres from Budge Budge. Residents of Sarangabad are forced to take an autorickshaw to Budge Budge and yet another to the Launch Ghat. From there, we cross the Hooghly to reach Baureah. The permit-issuing authorities could sanction a separate autorickshaw route from Bata More to Launch Ghat to help the regular passengers.

 T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge.

 These days the government is spending a lot on health projects but little is 

being done to create awareness among the poor. Labourers and daily wage earners 

fall easy prey to hawkers selling gutkha and pan masala at every 

traffic signal. Can?t the government also initiate awareness campaigns against 

these addictive substances? 

 Nita Jain, Southern Avenue. 

 While I was passing by the Shyambazar five-point crossing on Saptami, I found 

that posters and hoardings had inundated the island. The statue was hardly visible 

because of them. Hoardings should not be allowed near the statue. A garden at 

the base of the statue will beautify the spot. The installation also needs urgent 

repairs.

 Dalim Kumar Datta, APC Road. 

 There is a dearth of detailed maps of the districts of West Bengal in the market. 

The few that are published by College Street-based publishers do not clearly describe 

the arterial roads and railway lines. The quality of the print is also not good. 

It is high time the government brought out such useful maps. 

 Biman Saha, Lake Town. 

 Between Ranaghat and Gede under the Sealdah division, there are seven halt 

stations. But passengers suffer due to a paucity of passenger sheds during rainy 

and summer seasons. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia, Nadia.

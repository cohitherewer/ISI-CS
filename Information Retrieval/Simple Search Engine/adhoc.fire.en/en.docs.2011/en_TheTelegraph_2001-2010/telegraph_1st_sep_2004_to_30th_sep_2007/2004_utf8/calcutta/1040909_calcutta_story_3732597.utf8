The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On a kathi roll 

Light Bite

Calcutta is widely acknowledged as the birthplace 

of the kathi roll. Apparently, it was cleverly devised during the Raj for 

the benefit of Britons who wanted to eat parathas and kebabs without getting 

their fingers dirty. So, Nizam?s, the iconic roll and biryani destination behind 

New Market, now unfortunately closed, claims to have been the first to put the 

kebab into the flaky fried bread and wrap it up with paper.

The roll has now become staple roadside-stall fare. 

Every para has one, and it comes in numerous avatars. The real kathi 

roll would be garnished with some onion, green chilli and lemon. Some stores still 

stick to this winning, rather more subtle, concoction. But this requires succulent, 

tasty kebabs. Others, who may use inferior quality fillings, douse it with tomato 

and chilli sauce.

Double Chicken, Egg Chicken, Double Egg Double Chicken 

? the limit depends on your appetite alone. Bihar (next to Nizam?s where all that 

really remains is a makeshift counter run by employees) offers a potato filling 

as well, making the chicken-andaaloo combo a hugely satisfying 

? and filling ? hit. Apart from meat (usually chicken, mutton or beef), the egg 

roll, paneer roll and vegetable roll are variations catering to vegetarians.

The roll has now become pan-Indian. Caf? chains such 

as Barista have given into the popular appeal of this desi treat, making 

room on sandwich racks for vegetarian and non-vegetarian versions. After spreading 

its crispy calorific flavour all over the country, it has travelled overseas as 

well. A kathi roll shop in New York has become a runaway success.

Hot 

Kati Roll

Close to the Park Street-Chowringhee crossing, this 

has become a favourite place for some of the best rolls the city has to offer, 

especially convenient for office goers in search of a quick bite.

Kusum Rolls

A little further down Park Street inside the Karnani 

Mansions complex, this rivals Hot Kati for popularity and quality.

Karco?s

After the near-death of Nizam?s and the decline of 

Badshah, Karco?s has emerged as a good option for those on a shopping spree.

Bedwin

While there are quite a few outlets all over town, 

the Gariahat roll counter is the most popular in the south. The Fish Tandoori 

roll is particularly good apart from the usual fare.

Zeeshan

This Park Circus restaurant has a loyal fan following 

for the usual varieties, as well as the more exotic brain rolls.

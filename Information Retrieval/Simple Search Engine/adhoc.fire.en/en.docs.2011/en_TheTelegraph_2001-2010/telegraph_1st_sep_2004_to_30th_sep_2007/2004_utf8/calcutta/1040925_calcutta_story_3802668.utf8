The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Politics and patriarch

 This Sunday, the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai will be a busy place ? the man with the magic potion would be announcing yet another new film, Mr Prime Minister.

 ?All of Mumbai will be there,? promises Dev Anand (seen above with Konkona Sen Sharma and Ajay Devgan). While there is no reason to take him seriously, this time around Devsaab might just be on to something bigger and better than his staple non-starters.

 ?This will probably be the best film of my life,? announces the thespian. Haven?t we heard that before? But for once ? maybe because it?s politics and all that ? the octogenarian?s statement sounds more serious than usual. ?As a man of my country, I saw this flash before my eyes and I set about making my film. It is a political statement that I am trying to make out here,? he asserts.

 Unlike his recent attempts at film-making (Love At Times Square, Censor and Main Solah Baras Ki), Mr Prime Minister has a proper cast in place. Apart from the actor-director himself ?who, of course, plays Mr Prime Minister ?there?s Boman Irani as a power-player and Tara Sharma as a terrorist with shades of grey.

 ?I just cast the people who were available for the two-and-a-half months needed for my shooting,? declares Devsaab. The man himself is hardly hassled about wearing the twin hats of actor and director all over again: ?I have been doing this for the past 25 years. Yes, it?s tough, but it?s finally all in the mind. If you want to do it, you can certainly do it.?

 Having already canned several indoor sequences, Dev Anand and his cast will next head for the earthquake-hit zone of Bhachao in Gujarat to shoot the outdoor portions. ?I am sure every Indian from the roadside hawker to an aristocrat will be able to identify with the critique in my film.?

 Unlike most Dev Anand films, Mr Prime Minister will just have two songs and that too not picturised on him. 

 ?One of the songs has been composed by Bappi Lahiri and the other one by a newcomer,? says the ultimate celluloid survivor.

 What about battling the box-office blues? ?How many films are made in India every year and how many actually do well?? demands Devsaab. ?As a film-maker I can?t stop making films.? Period.

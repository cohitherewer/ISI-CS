The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Chit 

Ch@t

Joy, jest amp; jamming

Fest fever hit town post-Pujas, rocking campuses and 

setting stages on fire. Some big ones are in the bag, but a few are yet to come, 

so buckle up. St Xavier?s College is going beyond barriers with Pakistani band 

Strings lined up for a performance at Xavotsav. The action there kicks off on 

December 23.

But before that is Umang, at Bhawanipur College, presented 

in association with The Telegraph, from December 10 to 14. And they aren?t ready 

to be outdone. Daily post-event acts include Krosswindz, DJ Harish and DJ Pre-anjana. 

For the grand finale, on prom night, at Royal Calcutta Golf Club, will be Delhi-based 

band Parikrama and DJ Aqeel, all the way from Mumbai.

The celebrity judges line-up has names like danseuse 

Preeti Patel and Alokananda Ray, make-up artiste Prabir De and fashion designer 

Abhishek Dutta. 

Indian hockey legend Gurbux Singh will be judge and 

jury at the live commentary event, while former deputy commissioner of police 

(traffic) M.K. Singh, who is also a singer, will pass judgement on the budding 

poets in the shayari competition.

The events from Saturday to Monday will take place 

on the college campus. The finals on Tuesday will happen at Kala Mandir. Last 

but not the least is the prom, on December 14. And among the events, there?s something 

for everyone. Whatever be your forte, flaunt it and fly high on fame.

There?s Calligraphy, body tattooing, hair styling, 

interior decoration, jewellery designing, T-shirt painting, website making, dialogue 

and scriptwriting, war of rappers and much more. 

The conventional contests like quiz, debate, dance, 

theatre and fashion show, of course, will be part of the programme. Be there or 

be square. Preparations and rehearsals at Bhawanipur College are in full swing 

(pictures above by Aranya Sen). 

There are loads of throw-away prizes for the audiences 

as well as the winners, from Spykar jeans, Mapui salon, Fun City, Sparkz, Rolex 

and more. Have a go and grab your gift.

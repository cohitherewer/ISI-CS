Cook combos in hi-tech home

Clubsandwich

A strictly no-onion, no-garlic, no liquor menu at 

its 175-seater all-vegetarian restaurant (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). A 

captive bakery that doesn?t use eggs or yeast in its cakes and tarts. Hasya Kavi 

Sammelan on Holi, Sharat Purnima celebrations on Lakshmi Puja or the Diwali Preeti 

Sammelan. Sounds like a middle-aged melting pot? Not quite?

True, the institution was conceptualised on a cold 

and dark winter evening in colonial, pre-Independence India, when a group of 15 

?strong-willed? patriots got together to give birth to a ?revolution against alien 

culture?.

Over the years, Hindusthan Club has striven to present 

a platform for harmony and camaraderie between the present and the future. The 

swank new premises is an effort to extend that platform, maintains the management.

?Yes, the space spiral from 8,000 to 80,000 sq ft 

translates into a plethora of facilities that would obviously excite youngsters. 

The club is keen to strike a dignified balance between the old order and the new 

as a mark of respect for our senior members. It?s a home out of home where people 

of all ages can enjoy quality time with the basic values firmly in sight,? observes 

president G.D. Bhaiya.

Designed by architect Dulal Mukherjee and executed 

by L amp;T, the 10-storeyed showpiece club building is the culmination of the 

makeover efforts kicked off by Bhaiya during his tenure as president back in 1991. 

?Our entire effort is channelled towards creating state-of-the-art facilities 

for members and we realise the importance of bringing in youngsters to make the 

club a more happening place,? says Vinit Mehta, honorary secretary.

And GenX footfall has soared since the club opened 

its doors on the prime spine of Lansdowne Road. The increased focus on youth is 

manifest in the new kitchen combos as well.

?Quality vegetarian cuisine has always been the forte 

at Hindusthan Club, with a platter of over 300 dishes, served on a rotating basis,? 

says Mehta. Even as the dal bati/churma, kesaria jalebis, gulab 

jamuns and club kachoris remain as popular as ever, there is a club 

buffet lunch on the first Sunday of every month, and constant reinvention is the 

order of the day to tickle the taste buds.

But palate is not the only avenue the new-look Hindusthan 

Club is using to catch the contemporary drift. Swarovski chandeliers for the banquets, 

Technogym equipment-fitted ultra-modern gym, health club with sauna, steam and 

jacuzzi, home theatre, swimming pool and squash courts and the 14 guest rooms 

including four regally appointed suites spread over the eighth and ninth floors? 

Facilities conforming to star standards in a club that makes members feel at home.

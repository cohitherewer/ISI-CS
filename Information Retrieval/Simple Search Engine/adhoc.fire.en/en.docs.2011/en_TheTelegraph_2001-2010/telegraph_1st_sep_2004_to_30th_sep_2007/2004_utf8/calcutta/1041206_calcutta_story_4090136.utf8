 Gunshot foxes cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two men were detained on Sunday for questioning in connection with Saturday?s shooting in which one person was injured a few hundred feet from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s heavily-guarded Palm Avenue home. 

 Wounded Firoz Khan, a criminal wanted in connection with several cases, was stated to be in a critical condition. 

 Senior officers reviewed the bandobast in and around Bhattacharjee?s house. ?What foxes us is how a wanted criminal could be shot by another in front of the chief minister?s house,? said an officer. 

 According to them, certain changes would be effected in the security shield surrounding the Bhattacharjee residence. A new batch of guards is expected to be posted soon. 

 Special branch officers and the local police tried to figure out how gunman Sheikh Anwar shot Khan and managed to walk away under the nose of the guards.

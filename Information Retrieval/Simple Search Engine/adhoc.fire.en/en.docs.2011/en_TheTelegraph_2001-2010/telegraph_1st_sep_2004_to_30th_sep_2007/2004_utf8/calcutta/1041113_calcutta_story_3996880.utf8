 The evening of November 11 was a series of let downs for everyone in and around 89 Cinemas. The Pakistani cricket team and board members were supposed to catch the all-colour version of K. Asif?s magnum opus Mughal-E-Azam on the big screen at the Swabhumi multiplex. 

 This was a special screening of the movie on the request of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) for the Pakistani contingent, with the official release scheduled for Friday at 89 Cinemas and other halls in the city. 

 Here is a closer look at what took place, or rather, what didn?t really take place:

PRESS PUNCH

 The invitation that went out to the media had mentioned 7.45 pm as the time for the curtains to go up on the classic film. So the media mob patiently parked itself in front of 89C Moulana Abul Kalam Azad Sarani venue.

 By 7.15 pm, the place was teeming with journalists, outdoor broadcasting vans and photographers, to take a snapshot of the Akhtars and Afridis arriving for the show. But soon, news trickled in that none of the players or board members were going to show up for the movie.

 Only a handful of delegates had come in, forcing scribes and lensmen to beat a hasty retreat.

HUNGER HALT

 But amongst those who had actually showed up for the screening, the excitement about seeing the enhanced Mughal-E-Azam was huge. The audience ? not all of whom were only interested in the special guests ? comfortably settled into their seats by 7.30 pm, armed with soda and popcorn. 

 But the lights didn?t dim till 8.25 pm. Former cricketer Zaheer Abbas and veteran diplomat Shahryar Khan were disappointed, leaving the auditorium before the on-screen action began.

 ?I really wanted to watch the movie? I will try to catch it tomorrow,? said Shahryar Khan. 

 The reason for the late start was apparently a delay in getting the prints from the producer.

SECURITY SLIP

 But most disappointed was the expectant crowd that had gathered outside the cineplex to catch a glimpse of the star sportsmen, kept out by a tight security cordon. 

 ?I had no clue that the Pakistani cricket team would come here for a movie. But once I saw the security, I got really curious. Then I was really excited about seeing Shahid Afridi. Ah, well,? sighed Diya Poddar, one of the adoring onlookers.

 It was time, at last, to head home.

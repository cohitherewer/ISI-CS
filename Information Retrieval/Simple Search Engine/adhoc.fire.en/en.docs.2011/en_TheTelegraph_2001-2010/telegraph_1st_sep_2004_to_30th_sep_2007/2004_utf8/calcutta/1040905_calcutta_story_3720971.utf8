Ray, cola amp; kanchagolla 

Satyajit Ray on the sets of Pather Panchali

 In its 50th year, a chance to watch the classic that almost didnt get made due to budget constraints, in a hi-tech multiplex theatre with flavoured popcorn and vanilla cola in hand!

 Watching Satyajit Rays Pather Panchali on the big screen, in style, was the USP of the surprise package rolled out by INOX-City Centre in a tribute to the power of Bengali cinema. This 14-day Bengali film festival aptly titled Shera Cinema, organised by INOX in association with BFJA (Bengal Film Journalists Association) and WBFDC (West Bengal Film Development Corporation), opened on Friday with the most path-breaking movie from this part of the world.

 The festival was formally inaugurated by film-maker Sandip Ray at the City Centre multiplex. Ray junior looked upon this as a takeoff point for more such events that can successfully bring back cine classics to the big screen. 

 It is a great beginning and a very good step towards promoting Bengali cinema, said the man who has kept the Feluda flag flying high.

 Also present on the occasion was actor Subir Banerjee, Rays little Apu on the big screen, who was asked why he didnt progress to a life in cinema. I wasnt allowed at home, was the unexpected answer from Banerjee.

 While the audience turnout wasnt that path-breaking (a mere 30 per cent for the Pather Panchali show), the positive word-of-mouth publicity is expected to help the festival turnout pick up in the coming days and specially in the weekend.

 Apart from Pather Panchali, which will be shown again during the festival fortnight, 13 other milestone Bengali movies will be screened in the coming days.

 Avant garde favourites like Utpalendu Chakrabortys Chokh, Buddhadeb Dasguptas Grihajuddha, Ritwik Ghataks Titas Ekti Nodir Naam, Goutam Ghoses Padma Nadir Majhi, Ajay Kars Madhuban and Utpal Duttas Jhor will be shown in the first week at the Salt Lake multiplex.

 For two weeks, INOX-City Centre will stay decked up in traditional Bengali dcor, with a special sweets corner, too. So, when you are not discussing why Ray broke the 180-degree axis in the train sequence, you can help yourself to some classics like kanchagolla, jaffran barfi, kesar badshah, jal chocolate, chamcham and rosogolla.

The tickets for the festival have been specially priced 

at Rs 60 and Rs 80 and the two daily shows have been scheduled at 2.35 pm and 

7.45 pm.

Basics behind boom

Smile and greet the customer politely, offer help without being overly solicitous, know and do what the customer wants, know your store and the range of products on the racks, dont chat among peer group members or talk loudly To sum it all up: show that you care (for the customer).

 Moments of truth on the shop floor that bring in the footfalls begin the instant a customer walks in through the sensormatic portals of MusicWorld on Park Street. The in-house HR team believes basic hygiene coupled with strong emotional connect has propelled the store to new highs (read: monthly sales of Rs 1 crore in December 2003).

 Our structured orientation programmes are designed to enhance empathy and efficiency levels of our customer service associates (CSAs) and supervisors with performance-linked incentives, stressed R. Sai Radha, assistant manager (HR), MusicWorld Entertainment Ltd. She was in town along with Christy Charles, regional manager, MusicWorld Bangalore, for a training workshop for shop-floor staff ahead of the busy Puja and winter months.

 Ambience, service and product range are the three props on which any retail venture stands, and the groups HR bosses attribute the Park Street stores consistent performance to sincere adherence to fundamentals.

 Besides a strong benchmarking of products and services, we have focused on a few key areas like VCDs and DVDs, accessories, Hindustani and classical formats and regional repertoire, which have borne encouraging results, Charles added.

 But what about the mental block parents have towards shop-floor jobs? There are some reservations, but we do our best to dispel doubts by inviting parents to come and see for themselves how a typical day for their ward unfolds, said Lalita Sinha, regional manager, east.

 Devi or Durga, the doe eyes have clinched it for both mother and daughter. Decades after Sharmila Tagore played goddess in Satyajit Rays classic, SOHA ALI KHAN descends on Calcutta this week to inspire Abhishek Bachchan sculpting Durga in a zamindar household of 19th Century Bengal. In the courtyard of Thanthania Lahabari, chhotobou Soha starts her second Bengali venture with Rituparno Ghoshs Antarmahal.

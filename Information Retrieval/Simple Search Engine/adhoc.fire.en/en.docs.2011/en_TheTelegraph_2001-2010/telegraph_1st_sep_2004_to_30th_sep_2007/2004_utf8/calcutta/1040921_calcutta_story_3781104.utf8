 Yards of style and shimmer

Thirty years ago, Ananda established itself as one of the first sari boutiques on Park Street. It started on the Queen?s Mansion premises in 1974, with emphasis on the weaves of Bengal. Now, it draws the work of the finest craftsmen across the nation, catering to traditional as well as contemporary clientele at 13 Russell Street.

 With peak shopping season in progress, the festive range has hit the shelves. The special attractions for the Pujas are discharge prints on twill, chiffon with silk woven borders, chiffon Benarasis and crepes with woven silk borders.

 Exclusive designs, block and screen makers and the best master-weavers of the country ensure the selection at the store stays a cut above.

 This is the start of the rush, with winter sales picking up thanks to the return of NRIs from the US and UK on holiday. ?While domestic buyers often look for something different from the standard fare, our loyal clients from abroad always come looking for traditional saris,? explains an Ananda spokesperson.

 So the boutique tries to stock old-school weaves and prints, as well as trendier geometric designs. While classical styles have found their way onto more popular fabrics ? like chiffon Benarasis ? this is not the place to look for sequins.

 Innovation is a constant at Ananda. Though a ready-to-wear range a few years ago did not do very well, next year, dress materials will find their way into the Ananda offering. With sari wearing on the wane, it is a challenge to reach out to the younger shopper.

 ?We would like to make popular motifs available to those who prefer to wear salwar-kameezes,? adds the spokesperson.

 Reprints of a number of styles that have come to be associated with Ananda are frequent. Trademarks like the kalka (paisley), scroll and alpana, variations like the patli pallu and the half-and-half (where the pleats are of a different print than the body) have become popular over the years.

 The range cuts across budgets and occasions. Casual daywear to bridal best can be found on the carefully-stocked shelves. Starting with cotton prints at Rs 500 to real zari pieces for upwards of Rs 38,000, the collection is comprehensive.

 Cotton Dhakais woven in Bengal come at around Rs 4,000. Tussars from Indore begin at Rs 2,000. Printed Bangalore silks range from Rs 1,750 to Rs 3,000. Gadwals, ikkats and Mangalgiris are sourced from Hyderabad.

 The menswear collection at the store sticks to the traditional, with tussar and garad classics dominating the kurta range. Dhotis are more innovative, with the coloured variety catching on here.

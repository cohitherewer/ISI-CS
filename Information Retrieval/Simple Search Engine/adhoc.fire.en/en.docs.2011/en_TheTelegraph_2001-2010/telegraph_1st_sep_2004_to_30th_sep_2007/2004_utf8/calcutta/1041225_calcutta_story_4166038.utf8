 Mayor?s stick for litterbug shops

 - From January, cash fines and boycott notices for clean roads

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee is determined to teach traders who litter the roads a lesson in civic sense.

 Starting from the first week of January, traders found guilty of throwing garbage on the roads will have to pay cash fines to Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). An appeal might also be pasted on the walls of their establishments asking people to boycott them.

 ?A cleaner city is citizen?s pride? is the theme of this drive. Shop-owners would be let off with fines the first two times they are found to litter the roads. 

 If they commit the offence a third time, the appeal will be pasted on their shops. 

 The decision to initiate the drive was taken at a meeting between the mayor and municipal commissioner Debashis Som on Monday. 

 It was also decided at the meeting that the conservancy department would start sweeping the city roads in the afternoon from 1 January.

 ?We are with the mayor. But before taking steps against individual traders, he must provide enough litter bins,? said president of federation traders organisation Taraknath Trivedi. 

 Licensed traders, he pointed out, pay refuse tax to the civic body.

 At present, there is a vat for every 20,000 people in the city. Trivedi was of the opinion that the traders who litter the roads are mostly unlicensed hawkers and food vendors. 

 He said that under section 429 of the CMC Act-1981, the mayor is duty-bound not to allow encroachments within 48 metres of a stall in a civic market, but quite often, hawkers set up business right in front of licensed stalls. 

 A blueprint for the cleanliness campaign has been prepared by mayoral council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb after a meeting with chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar and the district conservancy officers (DCO) of the twelve boroughs on Tuesday.

 According to the plan, initially, a special cleanliness drive and afternoon sweeping will be carried out twice a week between 12 noon and 5 pm near important junctions in the city. Borough conservancy officials will supervise the operation.

 ?A team equipped with hand carts, sprinklers and receipt book for collecting fine will take part in the drive,? said deputy director (conservancy) Swapan Mahapatra.

 The sprinklers will be used to wash the leaves of the roadside trees, said Mukherjee.

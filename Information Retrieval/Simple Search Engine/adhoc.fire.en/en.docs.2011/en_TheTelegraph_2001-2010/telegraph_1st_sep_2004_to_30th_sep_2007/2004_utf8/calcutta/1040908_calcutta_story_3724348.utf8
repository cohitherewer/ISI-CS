The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buses, autos clog road

 - ALL WHEELS, NO MOTION

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 CALCUTTA CAMEO: Haphazard parking of buses, dug up roads and chaotic traffic. A Telegraph picture

 Its quite an ordeal for residents of MG Road, off the Tollygunge Metro station, to step out between daybreak and till late in the night. 

 Thanks to a clutch of illegal bus and autorickshaw stands, not to speak of temples in the middle of the 10-ft-wide road, the residents have hardly any space to move. To make matters worse, the road doesnt have pavements. 

 Using up the narrow space are stands of private buses of routes 40 (Thakurpukur-Babughat), 40A (Julpia-Babughat), 40B (Thakurpukur-Babughat) and 47/1 (Karunamoyee bridge-Salt Lake). 

 Minibuses plying on the Kalitala-Howrah, Masjidbari-Howrah and Haridevpur-Howrah routes and government bus C4 (Joka tram depot to Patuli), too, have their stands on MG Road.

 For want of a proper parking bay, the buses are all parked on the road.

 The road also provides parking space to nearly 3,000 autorickshaws, plying on the Kabardanga-Thakurpukur, Haridevpur-Tollygunge Metro station and Masjidbari-Tollygunge Metro station routes. 

 And if that would not make the crowd burst at the seams, the road is flanked by scores of shops. The result: traffic is almost at a standstill during peak hours. 

 Jayanta Roy, a resident of Kabardanga, said he had to spend an hour daily to cover the 12-km stretch to Tollygunge Metro station. Repeated appeals to the local councillor have evoked no response, he complained.

 Among regular users of the road are patients on the way to or from Thakurpukur Cancer Hospital. Its pathetic that even cancer patients are not spared by the bus and autowallahs. They do not move an inch to make room for the patients, he added.

 Local Trinamul Congress councillor Ratna Sur blamed the chaos on the indifferent attitude of the CPM leaders. I have submitted several proposals to the civic body to ease the traffic congestion. But nothing could be done, as vested interests, including a section of local residents, pre-empted all moves with the backing of the CPM, she lamented.

 CPM councillor Manju Kar, however, was defensive. She said the party was quite aware of the problem. Even transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has been approached. He had agreed to look into the problem. We are now looking for land to relocate the bus stands, she added.

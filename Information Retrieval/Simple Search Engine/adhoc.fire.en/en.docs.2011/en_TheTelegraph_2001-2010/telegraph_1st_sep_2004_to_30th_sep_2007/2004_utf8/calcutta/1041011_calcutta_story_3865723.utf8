The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can get through this week without...

 Going on a hygiene high

Thursday?s floods may have brought in all the nutrition you didn?t need for your 

front garden in the form of sewage water and garbage residue, but now that you 

are home and dry once again, go on a disinfecting drive. Get the pest-control 

guys to do the needful or roll up your sleeves, get your nose to the ground and 

give your driveway and front porch a thorough scrub.

Getting into dancing gear

High time you took stock of your traditional gear, if you don?t want to be seen 

dashing to the nearest Dandiya venue in that frayed denim and kurta, come 

Navratri. Starting October 14, there isn?t much hope to hit upon a jackpot and 

afford that designer tag. Harass mommy instead to part with that Benarasi, 

rush to the para darzee to turn it into a lehnga and boast loud 

and clear how you got this latest from a name that counts, for a steal! And do 

practise those steps and strokes if you want to stick it out through nine nimble-foot 

nights.

 Aiming for Mrs India

If you missed the Gladrags Mrs India 2005 city selections this weekend, rush your 

entries to Gladrags headquarters in Mumbai in a jiffy, for you don?t want to be 

caught napping when your next-door-neighbour may be busy doing an Aditi Govitrikar, 

do you? Leave hubby dear to play housekeeper while you zoom off for that gruelling 

grooming session under the strict guidance of madam Maureen and emerge a new sparkling 

leaf.

Losing Cruise control

This time in the garb of a contract killer in now running Collateral, Tom 

Cruise is back in action, big time. Catch him once again, but in less familiar 

? just as fetching ? shades. Go, Cruise!

Grabbing an eyeful of billboard beauties

Finally, you have all the eye candy you wanted while your boyfriend-cum-driver 

is left staring at the rough road ahead. As Zulfi Sayed bares (almost) all on 

giant billboards about town, flaunting his rather tiny briefs, have a good laugh 

(in between drools) as he protests bitterly about below-the-belt ?obscenities? 

(ha!).

 Taxi baby parents win full custody 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The baby who began life in the rear seat of a taxi, alone and abandoned, has been granted a permanent home and a family she can call her own.

 The family court on Friday finally awarded permanent custody of Ananya to Shanta and Arup Ghosh Dastidar. Ananya had been handed over by a taxi driver to Cossipore police station on May 1.

 The cheerful little girl was produced in the family court, where the judge allowed the Ghosh Dastidars, a childless couple from Barrackpore, to take permanent custody of her.

 Earlier, the same judge had handed over Ananya?s interim custody to the couple for a period of three months.

 ?She cannot stay without me for five minutes at a stretch,? Shanta told the court. ?I think she is a gift of God,? she added.

 Counsel for the Ghosh Dastidars Supradip Roy told the court Ananya was ?happy? with her parents. ?The couple is doing its best for the child,? he stressed.

 After the cabbie handed the infant over to Cossipore police, she was sent to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The nurses at the hospital named the girl Ananya.

 After reading about her in the papers, the Ghosh Dastidars met the hospital superintendent and sought her custody.

 When the hospital staff members refused to hand over the child, the couple moved the family court. Counsel Roy had told the court that his clients ?would raise her as their own daughter?.

 The judge on May 11 passed an order granting interim custody of the baby to the couple.

 After enactment of the Juvenile Justice Act, only the Juvenile Board has the right to allow a person or a couple to adopt a child. 

 When Ananya?s custody was granted temporarily, the state government raised a question about the validity of the order.

 The matter was brought to the notice of the high court, which confirmed that the family court had the jurisdiction to allow someone to take custody of an abandoned child. ?But to take the parental right of the child, the persons concerned will have to take the permission of the Juvenile Board,? the court observed.

 That bridge must now be crossed by Ananya?s parents.

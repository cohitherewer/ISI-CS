The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Club culture for her

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

Hail, the first ever women?s club in Calcutta.

 And who better to lead the novel move than the leader in the women?s magazine segment and its path-breaking editor?

 Sananda, the magazine that has empowered so many women with news and views, has now given its female followers a chance to unite on one platform, called Sananda Club.

 Before you men snigger, chat and chaat sessions are not the only things in store at this club. The plan is to address issues faced by women today through regular interactive sessions with experts.

 The inaugural session of the meeting was held at Oh! Calcutta, the speciality Bengali restaurant in Forum shopping mall.

The occasion marked the launch of the Sananda Club 

card by editor Aparna Sen (Picture above by Rashbehari Das). What was supposed 

to be a formal evening with a few words from Sen, ended up becoming the first 

interactive session with members pouring out ideas about the club?s way forward.

 ?Will you teach karate?? asked writer Bani Basu. Someone else wanted to know how she could get her child to read more Bengali books. A practising criminal lawyer raised the question of the club supporting rape victims while a child psychiatrist offered remedies for kid concerns.

 ?Given the response at the very first session of this club, I?m extremely optimistic about the success of this club,? smiled Sen.

 Membership to the club can be sought by filling out the membership form appearing in the magazine. ?This effort is being made by Sanada so that it can extend its horizons and get closer to its readers,? explained the editor.

 ong with readers, honorary members like writers Bani Basu, Suchitra Bhattacharya, actresses June and Sudipa, film-maker Anindita Sarbadhicari, theatre person Dolly Basu will be part of Sananda Club.

 ?We will expect them to extend help whenever we need them,? said Sen of the club?s celebrity member list.

 Starting with Calcutta, the club is expected to throw its doors open to members from the suburbs and then reach out to the rural areas. ?The expansion plans will depend on the operational convenience,? said Sen, who seemed more than happy to share her experiences as a mother and field questions about her life as an actor-director on the club?s opening day.

 Matching the food for thought were the yummy snacks served up by the restaurant: Kakra Chingri Bhapa, English Kebabs, Phoolkopir Chop?

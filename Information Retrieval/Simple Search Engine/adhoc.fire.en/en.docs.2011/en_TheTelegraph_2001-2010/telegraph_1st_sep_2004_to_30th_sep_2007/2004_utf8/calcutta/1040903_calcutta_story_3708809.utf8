Milan mantra: Frog Princess rediscovered

Sabya Speak

Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee says 

he will carry slices of Bengal to the fashion capital

Even daring to dream about going to Milan for Fashion 

Week had seemed wrong so far. It is the fashion capital of the world (though Paris 

still claims to be) and these were designers I grew up seeing in magazines. It 

seemed impossible that I too would get a chance to go. It is so exciting to be 

seen on the same platform as designers like Prada, Missoni and Gianfranco Ferre.

My collection has the same sensibility as Frog Princess 

(seen at India Fashion Week) as both are spring-summer 2005 lines. 

But this one has far greater depth. It is like an 

edited version of that, taking the best of the designs and concepts and developing 

them. There are a lot of distressed fabrics, tea stains, gussets and layering. 

I have worked mainly with chiffon and cotton. It is almost European with an Indian 

soul.

I also wanted to carry some of Bengal with me, so 

there is a lot of kantha stitch and quilting. I have used quite a bit of 

vegetable block prints, which Bengal is famous for.

so, for the hair, I am using narrow tangail borders 

as selvages to be braided into the hair, and then coiled up at the side of the 

head, with little tendrils hanging out. Like the kind of braids with ribbons little 

girls wear to sleep.

I am reviving one of the best parts of my first India 

Fashion Week collection the models will be wearing glasses again, perched on 

the nose, Meg Ryan style. Freckles, light lips and smudged mascara will complete 

the look.

The girls will walk aimlessly down the ramp, eating 

bread and chocolate again to the sound of vintage violin music.

To the world, India is still all about peacocks and 

elephants. I didnt want to show that at all. I consciously avoided the opulent 

world of maharajas. This is a second hand, worn in collection once again.

It also goes quite against what Italian fashion is 

famous for cuts and finishing. The clothes are almost shapeless, with a lingerie 

look. But then, it isnt sexy lingerie, either. It is more Victorian, back to 

the days of bloomers.

Getting ready for an international event like this 

was quite a feat. Once again, I found myself involved with too many projects at 

the same time. 

I had to turn down the chance to go to New York fashion 

week, which I was supposed to attend as a delegate, having won a competition at 

India Fashion Week. But there was no way I could go there at the beginning of 

September. I would rather spend that week working on my Milan clothes.

Logistically, it is also a struggle. When a sportsman 

goes abroad to represent the country, there is a huge amount of interest from 

sponsors. Luckily I was doing a collection for Tanishq and when I approached them 

they readily agreed to come in as main sponsor for the trip. Otherwise it would 

have been impossible for me to cover the costs. They are also designing the jewellery 

for the show, inspired by some junk trinkets I picked up from a warehouse recently.

I am almost hoping my show is received with huge critical 

acclaim; but we receive no orders! There is a huge amount of detailing that has 

gone into each outfit and with so many things happening I dont think we could 

handle it. Not including time spent on embroidery, we are spending over a day 

on each ensemble.

Finally, I hope to be noticed in Milan. Nothing more. 

So next year, they invite me back!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 I?m a drop in the ocean named cinema: Anil

 (From top) Anil Kapoor, the Musafir 

look and (above) with Goldie Hawn 

 A new look. A new heroine. A new film. ANIL KAPOOR is back ruling the billboards and the airwaves with Sanjay Gupta?s Musafir. He spoke to Pratim D. Gupta on what keeps him going and where he is headed.

 From Ishwar to Musafir, you have 

kept experimenting with your look in films. Is that a key to your sustenance at 

the top?

 My looks have always been according to the characters I have played. A look is essentially a character-based concept. It is, of course, an external thing but it has to be backed by a certain attitude and a certain performance. Otherwise, the look appears plastic. There are other actors who have experimented with their looks in the recent past but they have remained looks and nothing beyond. For me it has always been the character. From my first film Woh Saat Din to Ishwar to Virasat with that long moustache to the ?42 look in 1942: A Love Story to the non-moustache look in Lamhe, I have always changed with the characters I have played. There are like-minded actors these days but I have been doing this all my career. It has not been any strategy to sustain myself in the industry.

 But wouldn?t you agree that it has been risky, 

too?

 Yes, certainly. The moves have been risky. Being mainstream, I am aware that people want to see me in a certain way. They pay money to watch their stars. Now that they have lapped up my look in Musafir, they would expect me to come up with the same look in my forthcoming films. But then again it?s up to me whether I stick to these rules or break them or make my own.

 So Musafir?s a risk, too?

 Not really. It?s a very entertaining movie. It works on the psyche of a typical commercial film.

 How has it been like working with a completely 

new team like Musafir?

 It?s been a pulsating experience. Both Sanjay Dutt and Sanjay Gupta have been best friends for years. Then there?s Sameera Reddy, Aditya Panscholi and Mahesh Manjrekar. I have never ever worked with any of them before. So it was like working in an atmosphere totally alien to me. It?s like being in a territory where you are like an outsider. But then I had decided to take the plunge and we have all done a good job.

 What about your character in the film?

 My character is always at the receiving end in the film. I am being pushed around throughout. It?s quite different to what I have played on screen.

 There?s a lot of talk about the bold scenes you 

have done in the film?

 Yes, I have heard that, too. But there?s hardly any bold scene in the film. I have done bolder stuff before.

 What are the other films you are working on?

 There?s Murder At Shree Krishna Building, which is Mr Ram Gopal Varma?s project, directed by his assistant Jijy Phillips. Then there are two home productions Bewafaa and No Entry.

 Is it tougher to handle the dual role of actor-producer?

 Definitely. The workload is tremendous. But then again I work better when challenges are thrown at me.

What about direction? Is that on the cards too?

 Never. I just feel I am not cut out for it.

 How do you keep carrying on as the hero with 

so many young men appearing every Friday?

 I have never been a hero who sings and dances around trees. I have always played very strong characters, the main protagonists. Then again, I have done films like Biwi No. 1 and Taal where I have not played the central character but my roles have been very important to the script. I choose to do films where my character is either the main one or at least supporting in a very big way. I?ll try and stick to the role of a hero as long as I can and then move on to character roles. The transition will be easy. As for the younger lot of heroes, some of them are really good and I hope they do well.

 After the National Awards and mass adulation, 

where does Anil Kapoor go from here?

 The world of cinema and showbiz is like an ocean and I am just a drop in it. I feel I have done nothing and I have to do a lot more. In fact, one lifetime is not enough to do everything in this world. I will just carry on. I have a long way to go.

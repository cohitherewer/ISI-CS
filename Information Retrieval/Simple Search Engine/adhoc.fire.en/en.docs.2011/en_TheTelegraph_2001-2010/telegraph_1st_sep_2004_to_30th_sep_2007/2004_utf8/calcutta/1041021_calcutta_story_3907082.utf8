5 held over chanda thrash rerun

 OUR BUREAU

 After Barasat, Sankrail. After an armyman, a businessman. 

 A day into the Pujas, Tarak Shaw and his 12-year-old son Dipak were so severely beaten up by members of a local club in Sankrail that they had to be rushed to separate clinics on Wednesday (Saptami). 

 Shaw and son were ?punished? for refusing to cough up the subscription the members of the club had demanded. 

 The assault, that prompted the arrest of five club members, comes close on the heels of a similar attack on a former armyman and his wife at Netaji Pally, in Barasat. Subhas Sarkar and his family were assaulted after he refused to pay the puja subscription. 

 The two incidents highlight police failure to hold in check the menace of forcible chanda collection. 

 Fifty-four-year-old Shaw, owner of a shoe outlet in Mouri Bazaar, off Sankrail, picked a quarrel with members of Mohiari Bandhab Samity on Wednesday when they asked him to fork out Rs 501 and even made out a receipt without his consent.

 Shaw refused to pay up, offering Rs 51 instead. The club members warned him of dire consequences. When Shaw did not oblige, the club members began to punch him. 

 Drawn by the businessman?s screams for help, his son Dipak and wife Sandhya rushed to his rescue.

 Neighbours said the club members soon attacked both mother and son. 

 While the woman was allowed to escape with minor bruises, the father and the son were ?taught a lesson?. 

 Shaw was admitted to Sebayan Nursing Home, in Andul, while his son was admitted to West Bank Hospital. Till late evening, their condition was stated to be serious. 

 Soon afterwards, a team from Sankrail police station arrested five club members. 

 ?They were later produced in court,? said Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, superintendent of Howrah police. 

 The administration asked the sub-divisional officer immediately to cancel the permission for the club?s puja. 

 Back in Barasat, the Sarkars plan to sell off their house in Netaji Pally, as they feel insecure following the attack on them by members of a local club, Bibek Sangha. 

 With Sarkar and his wife still in hospital, they fear a retaliatory attack.

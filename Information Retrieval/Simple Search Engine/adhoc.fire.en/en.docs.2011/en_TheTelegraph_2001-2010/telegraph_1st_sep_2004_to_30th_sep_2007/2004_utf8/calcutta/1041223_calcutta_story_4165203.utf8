 Fun flavour

 If all you want to do this Christmas is stay at home, relax and enjoy some quiet quality time, then ring in the festive flavour with the telly. There?s plenty to keep kids and adults happy, with a range of seasonal programmes on the small screen. The film front finds Jingle All the Way and Santa Claus 2 leading the way on STAR Movies.

 The Arnold Schwarzenegger-starrer is the all-American Christmas story, where Arnie, a mattress salesman, leaves the gift-buying till the last minute. But what his son wants is on every other little boy?s wishlist ? Turbo Man. It?s a race against time ? and also an over-eager father played by Sinbad ? to grab that gift. The hilarious comedy is sure to have you in splits, with two grown men fighting over a toy.

 Santa Claus 2 has Tim Allen back in the role of the bearded toy-giver. Except this time, Santa?s son is being naughty. Plus, he has to get married, according to the fine print in the rulebook. So he leaves a substitute in charge to take care of some family business. But the substitute Santa is not really doing things the right way?

 Catch another laugh riot on HBO, with The Munster?s Scary Little Christmas. Eddie Munster is upset when the local bad boys make fun of his Dear Santa letter. His family tries to cheer him up, but things go humorously haywire when Santa Claus is turned into a fruitcake. 

 Get into the Yuletide spirit with the heartwarming A Town Without Christmas, where adults find happiness while trying to help a little boy in distress. Chris writes a letter to Santa wishing to leave this world to save his divorcing parents the trouble of looking after him. But a journalist and an author help save him and fall in love, too.

 True to nature, AXN has an action-packed December 25 programming plan, with a six-hour three-film bonanza for the youngsters.

 From noon, Three Ninjas Kick Back, Three Ninjas Knuckle Up and Three Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain will have the three black belt karate champs Rocky (15), Colt (14) and Tum Tum (8), saving the day with some smart moves to floor the bad guys.

 And finally, not to leave the little ones out, Cartoon Network has a plethora of programmes lined up from morning.

 There are Christmas special episodes of Bob the Builder, Scooby Doo and The Flintstones (a 90-minute show), A Very Jerry Christmas in the Tom amp; Jerry series and movie-length toons like Barbie and the Nutcracker and Batman and Mr Freeze. Catch it all on Christmas.

 Robbie the Reindeer reigns this Xmas on Pogo, with friends Donner, Prancer, Old Jingle and Tapir. The winner of three British Animation Awards comes in back to back episodes from 5 pm.

 Christmas is also the flavour of the episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine, Kipper, Oswald, Teletubbies, Pingu and Miffy the Friends. Mr Bean gets into Christmas action on Pogo from 7 pm.

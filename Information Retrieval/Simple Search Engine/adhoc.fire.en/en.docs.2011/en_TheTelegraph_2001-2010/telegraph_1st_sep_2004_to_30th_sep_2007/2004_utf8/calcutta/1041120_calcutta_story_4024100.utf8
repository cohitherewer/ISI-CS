The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Designer dreams muscle out factory fare

 One?s a master. The other?s a maverick. One has returned after an eight-year-long hibernation. The other?s dished out a new commodity from his assembly-line production house. Both are in the mood for love. 

 Yash Chopra?s ?new love legend? has opened to packed houses across the country and beyond. Ram Gopal Varma?s ?hard as nails? love tale hasn?t been able to find a sizeable audience for the dance drama. 

 Pratim D. Gupta decided to swing from popularity peak to disappointment depths. In other words, he sat through Veer-Zaara and Naach, back-to-back. And after the six-hour-long reel romances he was left wondering whether the content matters at all. Here are the high and low lights.

The Teams: Yash Raj Films Vs RGV Film Company

The Players: Veer-Zaara Vs Naach

 Crowd Count: At INOX (City Centre) on Thursday afternoon: more than 300 for the Yash Chopra movie, seven, repeat seven, for the Ram Gopal Varma film.

 Flying Start: Dream song sequences get both films off the mark. While Antara?s yogic careening in the pouring rain sets the mood for Naach, Shah Rukh?s scampering around sunflower fields instantly reminds you that you are watching a Chopra special. The matter-of-fact verbal exchanges between Abhi (Abhishek) and Rewa (Antara) in the bus gets you in the groove for the spontaneous reality that is Naach. The self-conscious larger-than-life structure of Veer-Zaara is evident straightaway as Veer (SRK) breaks his 22-year-old silence after the instant two-minute monologue of Samiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukherjee).

 Middle Overs: With both essentially being musicals, a legend named Madan Mohan is pitted against two comparative novices in the form of Amar Mohile and Shailendra Swapnil. But the 30-year-old tunes are too raw for comfort and the spicing up by son Sanjeev Kohli lacks the seasoning so essential to see a Yash Chopra film through. Main yahan hoon and Tere liye are the saving graces but they come too late in the day. The Naach score, like the film, is impromptu ? it bursts out in ecstasy, languishes in agony and mixes effortlessly with the tangible sound effects. The songs complement the inner psyche of the characters, who speak less and let other body parts do the talking (Abhishek?s brooding eyes and Antara?s body)?

 Slog Saga: A veteran of many a romantic razzmatazz, Chopra knows how to disguise that all-important slower delivery. So the sweet little twist in the tale and the SRK monologue does add sheen to the predictable pitch named Veer-Zaara. The typical Indo-Pak harmony hamming, the youth deciding the future of international relations and the adarsh maa-beta communion ? all that you love to hate but love all the same. The Naach ending plays true to its ruthless treatment but like the maker?s arrogance (I don?t care for the box-office: Varma) it never bothers about the audience. Like Antara?s character, the film remains ?professional? and only allows you to steal a very objective view of the proceedings.

 Prize Distribution: Sometimes, a briskly baked pizza can be tastier than a long-simmering dum pukht biryani. But to judge that, one needs to bite into both. Thanks to Chopra?s expansive promotion and Varma?s bizarre marketing strategies, the star draw of SRK-Preity-Rani versus the low-pull lull of Abhishek-Antara, the winner was decided even before Diwali Friday came and went. So even if there?s no love (not even two days) and only separation (22 years), Veer-Zaara might turn out to be the grand celluloid romance Chopra conjured. In Bollywood these days, legends are not born, they are created?

 What We are Watching

BOLLYWOOD - Brain ?n? brawn

 Phir Milenge: Tale new, takers few

 Phir Milenge (U) 

 Revathy returns to the big screen after her award-winning directorial debut Mitr: My Friend. More commercial in look and feel, the film tries to make people aware about AIDS without being preachy. It features the brawny Salman and the brainy Abhishek.

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 12.35 pm, 7.25 pm; INOX (City Centre): 1.30 pm, 7.15 pm; 89 Cinemas: 8.40 pm; Jyoti: 12 noon, 3 pm, 6 pm, 8.45 pm Flop factor Despite the critical acclaim, the film has failed commercially. Dhoom spillover has helped its sagging prospects but 89 Cinemas still registered a mere 30 per cent in the second week.

Rakht: Cold scare 

 Rakht (U/A)

 Apart from the sexy Nehas and Bipashas and Amritas, Mahesh Manjrekar?s first supernatural thriller has some hot males too ? the sturdy Suniel, the debonair Dino and the deadly Dutt.

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 2.40 pm, 10 pm; INOX (City Centre): 1.40 pm, 6.40 pm, 9.30 pm; 89 Cinemas:12.25 pm, 5.45 pm; Elite: 12 noon, 3 pm, 6 pm, 9 pm.

 Flop factor First week collections at 89 Cinemas was less than 50 per cent while INOX registered a slightly better 60 per cent. Guess horror?s not the mood of the hour.

 No entry barriers for foreign participation, please, from business to birdie. The Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) brass? assurance that the greens ?were open to (non-member) foreigners? put Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at ease on Friday afternoon.

 The chief minister, desperate to woo business to Bengal, did the rounds of golf?s oldest home outside the British Isles on Friday, on the occasion of the heritage institution?s 175th anniversary celebrations. Besides being bowled over by the ?wonderful? course, he was reassured to learn that foreigners passing through town were welcome on the Royal?s hallowed greens.

 The captain of the do-it-now Left, who has used every possible forum of late to underline the potential of the fairways to attract business, agreed that the picture-perfect RCGC course could act as a catalyst to enthuse prospective overseas investors. ?Wonderful, absolutely fabulous. Hard to believe there?s so much greenery in this city,? exclaimed the chief minister, after going around the manicured Royal, all decked up for the weeklong gala, in a golf cart.

 ?He also wanted to know about our junior programme and how the vast course is kept ship-shape,? said Ashit Luthra, immediate past captain, after driving the chief minister around.

 Bhattacharjee, who later joined the club officials for tea and snacks, was also interested in the earning potential of the game, as well as its start-up costs.

 The chief minister had a word of encouragement for local golfer S.S.P. Chaurasia, who caddied for a while before rising through the ranks to become one of the top pros in the country. 

 ?The elitist myth that surrounded golf is gradually getting smashed and the chief minister?s active interest augurs well for the city and the sport,? felt Jaideep Chitlangia, RCGC finance convener.

 The Japanese brigade present at the Royal was quick to spot value in Bhattacharjee?s sojourn. ?It?s heartening to see the chief minister take time out and visit this fantastic golf course, which compares with the best in business,? said Kenji Shimizu, Japanese consul-general in Calcutta.

 Shimizu felt the ?new buoyancy? in town, with so many malls and multiplexes, besides, of course, ?the availability of two international-standard golf courses?, have enthused more Japanese business people to come in.

 ?The number and frequency of Japanese nationals flying into Calcutta have both increased and that?s a tribute to the improved perception,? the consul-general added.

 Ken Okubo, chief operating officer (India), Itochu Corporation, who has been in Calcutta for five years now, shared the consul-generals views on the ever-improving business climate in the state.

 ?There are still many vexatious infrastructure issues to be addressed, like roads, proper designing of flyovers, etc. However, there?s no denying the new excitement in the air, which should translate into better business ties with Japan,? said Okubo,

 The Itochu man, all praise for the chief minister?s ?positive attitude?, was hopeful of bagging the sky-train project deal to ease traffic congestion in the city next year. 

 Itochu experts are expected in the city by mid-2005 to prepare a feasibility report.

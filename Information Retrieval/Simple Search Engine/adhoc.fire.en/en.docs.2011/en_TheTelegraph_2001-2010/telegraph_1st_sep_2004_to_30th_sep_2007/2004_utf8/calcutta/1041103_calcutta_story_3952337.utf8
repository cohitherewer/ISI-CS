 Extortion racket back in action

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Extortion is back with a bang. This time, with ringleaders in jails, the henchmen are doing the job. The targets are mostly promoters and traders.

 On Sunday afternoon, Ullu Razu picked up a promoter and then went on a shooting spree near Park Street. This 24-year-old terror from the Rashid Alam (Gabbar) gang is not alone.

 Police records suggest that extortion is rampant in Bowbazar, Hare Street and Burrabazar, too. 

 Barely a week ago, Saima ? uncle of gangster Nadeem ? demanded a hefty sum from a New Market businessman. Police sources said the trader had paid the money to buy peace with Saima and had shied away from lodging a complaint. 

 As for the Sunday incident, Taltala police station has lodged a case of kidnapping for ransom against Razu, who has always managed to elude the police net ever since his leader, Gabbar, had been arrested. 

 A former resident of Wellesley Second Lane (his mother still stays there), this trusted aide of Gabbar turned up with four others at a construction site at 43, Imdaz Ali Lane, in Taltala. 

 The site belongs to Arun Gomes. He has handed it over to Mohammed Karim to construct a four-storeyed building.

 Work was on in full swing when the criminals on motorcycles swooped down on the plot around 12.30 pm.

 Razu and his men first looked for local promoter Mohammed Azad, calling him by his name. Not finding him, the gang picked up Karim.

 With Karim in their custody, Razu and his men raided three construction sites, off Park Street, that are being developed by Azad. As the promoter could not be spotted anywhere, the gang opened fire in disgust. 

 From there, the gang went to Park Circus, where they dumped Karim. But they extracted an assurance from him that he would let them know Azad?s whereabouts.

 Park Street police station officer-in-charge Faiz Ahmed Khan said: ?It seems Razu has been operating with some local contacts.? 

 In Burrabazar and Posta, police claim that a few of Gopal Tiwari?s gang members, including Ved Prakash Ojha and Panther, have been extracting money from businessmen. 

 Much like Razu, these gangsters disappear from the city after every operation.?Ojha and Panther had been arrested but were released on bail. These days, they come to the city only on specific tip offs. Their hideouts are mainly on the fringes of Howrah,? informed an officer of Burrabazar police station. 

 In Bowbazar, the racket is run mainly by Chikna Sajid, Simi and Sabir ? all associates of Nadeem. 

 ?We hope to nab these men soon,? said Rajiv Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

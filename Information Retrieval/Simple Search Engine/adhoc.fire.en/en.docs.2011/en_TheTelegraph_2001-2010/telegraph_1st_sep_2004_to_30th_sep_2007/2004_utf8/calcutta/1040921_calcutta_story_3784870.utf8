Mother Nature amp; animal instinct

 Back to Basics:They?re young and inexperienced, 

but these young crusaders have an abundance of what matters most ? enthusiasm 

and determination. With these weapons in hand, Instinct is going about saving 

the environment and protecting wildlife. Some members of Instinct take time out 

on one of their field trips (top). Back to work on a boat, for hands-on experience 

of what it takes (above).

Instinct by name and instinctive by nature ? that?s 

what this bunch of young saviours is all about. Wildlife is their target and their 

aim is unerring. Twenty might not be a big number, but it?s enough to form a group 

and save the environment. They follow their animal instincts as they battle to 

preserve and protect Mother Nature from human hands.

 Formed about a year ago, Instinct was the brainchild of a few eager beavers who wanted to do their bit. ?One day, me and some friends approached sir (Dipak Mitra) to help us,? says Suvrajyoti Chatterjee, one of the founder-members of Instinct. Dipak Mitra of Calcutta Snake Park is a veteran, associated with this kind of work for the past 35 years. He is the guiding light behind these boys and girls.

 Instinct already has a number of good projects to its credit. The top priority for the volunteers is creating awareness about wildlife in the city and the districts, so that animals can be rescued from a hostile locality and put back in their natural habitat. The group has so far rescued three snakes and returned them to safe places.

 Instinct has been on numerous field trips to places like the Sunderbans, Badu Snake Park, Narendrapur Wildlife Sanctuary and Fishermen Co-operative Society, near the EM Bypass, researching and exploring. At the moment, Instinct is trying to stop the illegal selling of the oil obtained from the tail of the Sanda lizard. 

 On World Environment Day, the youngsters held a rally from Park Circus to Nandan. They were also active participants in the Nandan wildlife film festival. Instinct has had some high-profile help from knowledgeable quarters, in the form of Aranyak, the environmental NGO supported by Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s daughter Suchetana. 

 On a recent trip to Serampore, Instinct had organised an essay competition among local school students, as well as slide shows and a photography exhibition, on wildlife. The theme was Prani O Prakriti. 

 Jumping in with both hands with no idea of what you?re up against is always dangerous, especially when it?s wild animals you?re working with. Instinct?s work involves a lot of sweat, toil and risk-taking. And, of course, physical fitness, to either catch the creatures before they bite or run like the wind to escape them. ?We go on regular field trips to get trained with hands-on experience. We need to read up, too, for relevant information,? says Sudipto Mitra, another member.

 Fun for fresh faces

 It?s that time of year again, when schools bid goodbye and colleges say hi. It?s never easy, leaving everything you know and entering new territory. To make the move a little easier, college authorities and students organised a series of events to welcome the new batch. Here?s a brief look at a few.

Insomnia grips campus: With colleges opening 

their doors to new students, seniors can take a cue from JU about welcoming freshers 

in style. After the mandatory round of breaking the ice (ragging is a strict no-no), 

the civil and the electrical engineering departments summoned the magic of the 

city?s hottest youth rock band, Insomnia, to welcome the freshers. 

 Playing to a packed Gandhi Bhavan, the eight-member rock band got the crowd jumping to old favourites from Led Zeppelin, Jim Morrison and Bon Jovi, as well as its own tunes from their soon-to-be-launched album Cry of the Spirit. Bengali tracks from the bands maiden venture Bangla Gaan proved to be a hit, too. 

 Treated to the two-day nirvana organised by the seniors, the new ?children of rock? on campus are definitely not complaining! Insatiable fans of Insomnia can catch them at Someplace Else on September 26 at the promotional launch of their new album.

Shake a leg: The freshers? welcome was an eventful 

occasion for Loreto College students, new and the old. An orientation programme 

had been organised for the freshers, which began with principal Sister Tina Farias 

welcoming them and introducing the college staff. The presidents of the different 

societies in college then spoke about their varied activities. 

 The first years were then taken to their classrooms and introduced to the departmental staff, after which they acquainted themselves with their seniors and classmates. This was followed by an entertainment programme organised for the freshers by the second and third years. It was inaugurated by a prayer dance and then came a foot-tapping song and dance routine. During the programme, a few enthusiastic first years decided to take centrestage and shook a leg with their seniors.

 A library orientation was held for the freshers the next day, organised by librarian Papiya Mukherjee and the second years. There was an interactive question-answer round, where prizes were awarded to all those with the right answers.

Culture and music: The freshers might still 

be learning to cope with college life at St Xavier?s College, but the welcome 

the department of commerce gave was aimed at easing the process. The event, which 

was supported by the professors, the principal, vice-principal, rector and dean, 

began with a sarod recital by Arunabha Das.

 This was followed by speeches by the professors, Bengali songs and a reading from the Bhagvad Gita, the Holy Bible and the Quran. The programme was aimed at making everyone feel at home, by embracing all cultures and religions. It concluded with a western music performance by Sourendro Mullick, Debokranti Das, Vikram Paharia, Rahul Pandey and myself.

Masti and hungama: The campus was abuzz with 

excitement and nervousness as freshers made sense of a new world. D-Day at JD 

Birla Institute witnessed a warm welcome for the latest batch of students. The 

theme of Banjaras found them dressed in ethnic and colourful skirts and ghagras. 

 The colours of India were all over campus. The four corners were decorated according to culture (north, south, east and west). The girls represented different states, from Kashmir and Punjab, to Bengal and Assam. There was dance and music, masti and hungama. The seniors performed dances to popular folk songs. There were games and humourous skits, too. This entertained the freshers and helped them adjust to their new surroundings. Thus the ice was broken. 

 This was followed by a Miss Fresher competition. Four Miss Freshers were chosen, representing a state from the east, west, north and south. The food comprised specialities from all four corners of the country. The principal ended the ceremony with some valuable advice for newcomers.

Correction: In ?Q Junkies emerge top of TOPS? 

(September 19), one of the participants was referred to as Jayshree Pohankar. 

It should have read Jayshree Mohanka.

Ring in centenary celebration

 Interact, the youth wing of Rotary, rang in the centenary celebrations with the bell that?s travelling around the region, on September 13. The bell was escorted to a few Interact schools, before being taken to Rotary Sadan for a cultural celebration organised by the Interact district council. There were talks by various rotarians on the fellowship brought by the bell, a dance performance on skates by Spree Kanodio of MB Girls? and music by Apeejay School?s band. The annual assembly for Interactors was held on September 17. While in the morning the board members of various Interact schools were given counselling and training sessions by eminent rotarians, the evening was reserved for Interface, the assembly. The district Interact newsletter was also released, which emphasised the two major Interact projects ? Sanjog in association with Groupe Developpement and ECPAT International and Pulse Polio in association with the Corporation, Rotary International, UNICEF and WHO. A panel discussion on ?How urgent is it for children and youth today to be educated on child protection? was held, which revolved around Sanjog, a campaign against child sexual abuse. Issues like sex education, disaster management, the need for a broader mindset, etc were also covered. Finally, there was a rocking performance by the youth band Insomnia (picture left by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya).

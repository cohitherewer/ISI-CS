The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bag basics for men on the move 

Shabby hold-alls and boring briefcases 

have given way to smarter and sleeker options for the busy brigade. Zeeshan 

Jawed digs out some favourites from the fare offered by city stores

A few seasons ago, Joey on the sitcom Friends tried 

carrying around a handbag, only to get laughed at by his pals and sundry strangers 

alike. The world, clearly, was not ready at the time for the style statement that 

had made it to the ramp.

But while ?purses? may be far from the fashion reality 

of the Calcutta male, there are plenty of peppy accessories for the busy executive.

Men?s bags are becoming smaller and sleeker. But while 

making a choice, watch out for not only appearance but also space and utility.

Portfolio bag

Valued more for their reliability than charm, this 

everyday accessory for the office-going male has come a long way since the days 

of the shabby hold-alls. The focus of a portfolio is usually depth and capacity 

rather than looks. From calculator to cardholders, files to folders, these have 

separate compartments for all the necessities of daily life.

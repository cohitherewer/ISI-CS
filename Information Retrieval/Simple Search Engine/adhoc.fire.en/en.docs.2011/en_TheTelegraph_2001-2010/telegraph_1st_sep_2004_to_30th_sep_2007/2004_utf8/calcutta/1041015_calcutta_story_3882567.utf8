 Cry of civic neglect

 - Minority leaders remind mayor of pledges

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 

 A delegation of over 450 Muslim organisations, under the banner of the Calcutta Khilafat Committee (CKC), met mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Thursday to draw his attention to the civic authorities? ?persistent neglect? of minorities.

 The delegation reminded the mayor about two of his pre-Lok Sabha elections commitments that are yet to be honoured ? reserving 15 per cent jobs in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for minorities and transferring a 1.5-cottah plot at the Colootola Street-Phears Lane crossing.

 The Muslim leaders, led by CKC president Ayub Khan and working president Javed Ahmed Khan (also a mayor-in-council member), alleged that after the announcement of job reservation, more than 3,000 youths had been appointed on contract, but none of them belonged to any minority community.

 Citing the other instance of breach of commitment, the leaders said that on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections, in which mayor Mukherjee had contested from Calcutta North West, the civic body had handed over the 1.5-cottah plot to the CKC. But to date, no lease deed or agreement relating to the transfer has been signed by the authorities.

 Another complaint of the delegation was the absence of any Urdu reporter in the secretary?s department to note down the minutes of the civic body?s monthly meetings. This, despite the fact that the board has 23 Urdu-speaking councillors. 

 Reminding the mayor that more than 30 per cent of the city?s population lives in slums, the delegation demanded a cleanliness drive for the Pujas and Ramzan.

 The leaders also drew mayor Mukherjee?s attention to the poor condition of the burial grounds for both Hindus and Muslims. 

 Javed Khan requested Mukherjee to take immediate steps to stop diversion of slum development funds for development of certain colony areas, where a section of political leaders had vested interests. ?I am not against development of colony areas, but the mayor should set up a special fund for that,? Khan emphasised.

 ?Since most slum-dwellers are poor and uneducated, it is easy to fool them and divert funds meant for them,? said Ayub Khan.

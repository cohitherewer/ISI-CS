 Small coins on way out

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to withdraw all 5, 10 and 20-paise coins from circulation. 

 Those who will exchange the coins will be paid an equivalent amount in higher denominations.

 Small coins, now rarely used in any transaction, are on the verge of becoming antiques. Even beggars are choosers when they are offered small coins. 

 Shopkeepers refuse to take them, calling them achal paisa (useless). Bus conductors even allow a free journey when confronted with them, while priests at temples refuse with folded hands to accept them as pranami (offerings).

 Altercations between shopkeepers and consumers, and between bus conductors and passengers, over small coins are not too infrequent. 

 ?Lakkhir bhare rekhe din (Keep them in the piggy bank),? is the advice often heard from bus conductors and owners of roadside stalls. 

 RBI assistant manager Ashis Chattopadhyay said on Wednesday: ?We have decided to withdraw small coins from circulation to stop all confusion and controversy.??

 He asserted: ?We are flooded with complaints from various people on non-acceptance of coins by traders and shopkeepers. We want to make it clear that the RBI has never cancelled any coin and the traders are bound to accept whatever is offered to them.? 

 ?We have sent notices to all trade associations, asking them to accept small coins. Many people, to avoid any unpleasantness, do not want to force traders to accept the coins. We want to put an end to this,? said Chattopadhyay.

 The RBI assistant manager has drawn up an action-plan to collect small coins. Individuals will get sufficient time to get the coins exchanged. 

 ?A counter was opened last week at the RBI for exchanging the coins. Besides, we are planning to set up camps at various markets, government offices and departmental stores after the Pujas to collect the coins. We are also planning to open special counters at select nationalised banks,? he added.

 The project will initially run in the city and will later be extended to other urban areas. 

 According to a rough estimate by the RBI, there are more than five million coins doing the rounds in Calcutta.

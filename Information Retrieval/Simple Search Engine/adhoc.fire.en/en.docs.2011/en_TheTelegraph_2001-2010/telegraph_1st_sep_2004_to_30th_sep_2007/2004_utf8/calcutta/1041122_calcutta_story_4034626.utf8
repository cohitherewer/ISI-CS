Khazana at Taj Bengal

IPSITA DEB

Regal regalia

Khazana at the Taj Bengal is true to its name: a house 

of Indian treasures. Amidst regal ambience, with tasteful books chosen carefully 

for the erudite reader, apparel gracefully draped on mannequins and across the 

store, this is a place for the artist, the window-shopper and of course, the shopahalic. 

With a tea counter and skincare products, this is a one-stop shop for buying gifts 

and pampering yourself. With specially-crafted merchandise exclusively for the 

Taj stores, the authenticity of the items bears five-star guarantee (Pictures 

by Rashbehari Das).

Garments galore

The apparel section has an assortment of designer 

wear, including creations by Ritu Kumar. Smart sequinned and multi-coloured jackets 

and waistcoats, cashmeres and stunning dresses hang elegantly at the store. Silk-brocade 

lehngas and sophisticated trousers with chiffon kurtis are other 

items worth a buy, or definitely a look. Embroidered and Madhubani salwar-suits 

in silk and cotton are priced between Rs 3,000 and Rs 6,000.

The saris are the most precious treasures here. Some 

exquisite traditional kanthas, Kanjeevarams, Benarasis and Dhakai saris 

drape the racks, alongside trendy chiffons, georgettes, printed crepes and designer 

labels. The traditional range is upwards of Rs 3,000.

The exquisitely designed silk scarves, patchwork stoles 

and georgette dupattas are ideal for glamourising any outfit. Under the 

umbrella of shawls, there is a large and varied range with designers like of Rohit 

Bal, Manoviraj Khosla, Ritika Dalal and Gopal Ghosh extending their talent to 

the intricate pieces. Jamewar prints and high-value Swarovski-studded shawls can 

be found on silk pashmina. 

The men?s section has some well-cut cotton shirts 

and cashmere and pashmina mufflers. Kantha stoles and dupattas for 

sherwanis are specially crafted with subtle nuances in earthy shades.

Perhaps the most stunning in the men?s wear section 

is a range of exclusive silk ties. These are reasonably priced between Rs 400 

and Rs 1,200.

Match it up

Bags in bandhni and brocade, with hand-embroidery 

and trimmings of silver beads, mother-of-pearl and other semi-precious stones 

can be found here. Lovely crochet and cloth bags with kantha and mirror 

work are also of interest.

The silver ethnic jewellery found here is traditional 

in the form of pure silver balis, necklaces and earrings, starting at Rs 

70. Bangles and rings with semi-precious and precious stones can also be found 

here. For men, there are cufflinks in silver with or without stones.

In the leather section, under labels like Hidesign, 

handbags, laptop bags, wallets, jackets and belts can be found.

Art amp; Craft

Gold-plated marble and silver artefacts, gemstones, 

old bronze items, hookahs, stools and boxes, sandalwood figurines of animals and 

deities can be found here. Paintings by Chhaya Parekh, Pooja Mewar and Kiran Mohinder 

are also available. Apart from these, silk brocade original tankhas from 

Tibet, Mughal miniatures with real gold lithographs, paper miniatures, silk and 

special ivory-hilted paintings can be found here.

?Because this is in a five-star, people feel things 

must be exorbitantly priced. I want to change that view and let people know there 

is something for everyone at Khazana. Our merchandise is specially sourced, keeping 

it exclusive,? says Simanti Nair, manager, Taj Khazana.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 One-day match hitch

 OUR BUREAU

 When the CPM calls a bandh, the party cadre takes to the streets to ensure the city does not get to work. But Wednesday may well script a very different story. At least 50,000 CPM activists in Calcutta will take to the streets to resist Wednesday?s SUCI bandh.

 For the past three days, the CPM workers have taken to extensive street-corner meetings. ?We have already organised meetings in every locality to make people aware that the bandh is totally unjustified,? CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said on Tuesday.

 Wednesday?s CPM programme includes persuading office-goers to reach their destination on time, help them avail of public transport and asking shop-owners not to down their shutters.

 Playing down the shutdown, Left Front chairman Biman Bose said: ?Bandhs are like one-day matches now. They hardly create any impact.?

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, meanwhile, lashed out at the three political parties behind the bandh calls. ?If anyone awards prizes for child?s play, all these parties must be given gold medals,? said Chakraborty.

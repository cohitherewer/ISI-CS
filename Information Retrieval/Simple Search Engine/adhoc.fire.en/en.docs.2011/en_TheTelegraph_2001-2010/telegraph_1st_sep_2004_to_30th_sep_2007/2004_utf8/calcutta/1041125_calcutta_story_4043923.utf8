 Star pluck on stage purse strings 

Few takers for new-age Star

 - Left out of revival loop, cost-conscious group theatre wary of nostalgia address with modern trappings

 Tech tools to cushioned comfort ? resurrected for Rs 15.5 crore, Star now has almost all that is needed at a new-age theatre stop. Except theatre.

 With more than a month gone by since its formal inauguration with a celebrity parade, a cloud of confusion hangs over the new-look Star. 

 To play or not to play is the question at the Beadon Street address.

 Did the audience that Star commanded die with Ghatak Biday, the last production staged before the hall was gutted 13 years ago? Is there a ready audience for the new Star? And before that, is Star ready for theatre?

 ?Not immediately, for a lot of things need to be put in place, for instance fire-fighting measures and water connection. But once these are sorted out, theatre will surely be revived. The jatra troupes may also be interested,? says veteran Ganesh Mukherjee, chairman of Star Theatre Banchao Committee, who was also closely associated with the resurrection of the Hatibagan landmark.

 The city?s theatre crowd is split over the Star turn, with money matters pulling at the purse strings and nostalgia tugging at the heartstrings. 

 Though the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is yet to fix the rent, how far Star will rise or set could depend on the economic viability of the space.

 Stage artistes feel a large section of theatre troupes ? which still find the Academy of Fine Arts too expensive, with the show rates stretching from Rs 3,700 to Rs 4,250 ? can ill-afford Star comfort.

 ?Group theatre troupes will not be able to afford it if the authorities don?t have subsidised rates. If this isn?t the case, then the hall will have to be sustained on call shows by office recreation clubs, cultural programmes, music soirees or maybe an occasional jatra festival. I am not interested in lavish auditoriums but rather a space where we can do theatre seriously,? asserts Koushik Sen, director, Swapnasandhani.

 The cost element would decide whether Rudraprasad Sengupta takes the Star stage. ?I am not going to perform if the rent is, say, Rs 8,000. Let the authorities work out the logistics first... The Academy of Fine Arts is the most ill-equipped theatre in the city but still some of the best theatre has happened there,? stresses the director of Nandikar.

 Money matters apart, the attitude of CMC officials would also be crucial to a theatre revival. ?The Star authorities did not involve actors of the young generation at any stage of the project,? complains Koushik, who is not the only one nurturing the grouse. 

 ?We were not even invited at the inauguration of the hall. Does it then imply that the space is not for us? This hall should belong to all people doing experimental theatre. And why can?t there be concessional rates for group theatre, just as the government provides us at halls like Madhusudan Mancha?? demands Usha Ganguly, director, Rangakarmee.

 The CMC may have engineered a modern theatre complex, but building the much-needed base of theatregoers is the challenge, feels Rudraprasad Sengupta. 

 ?Why should people give Star a try? For that, a definite strategy needs to be worked out. The clientele has to be singled out and a support base extended to theatre groups in the form of, say, token rates. Campaigns in schools, colleges and on streets are also vital.?

 Then, will jatra make Star viable? No simple answers to that one, either. ?I doubt how many jatra troupes will want to perform at the new Star, as it has a seating capacity of around 500, against the earlier 900-plus. In comparison, Mahajati Sadan is large enough to accommodate 1,208 people,? points out Dilip Das, producer of Satyanarayan Opera.

 Nostalgia might be the only enduring draw. ?I would love to do theatre at Star. It?s where Nati Binodini used to perform, the one who paved the way for us all,? says Dolly Basu, actor-director, Chupkatha.

 But Nati Binodini belonged to what used to be called ?commercial? theatre, which is all but dead.

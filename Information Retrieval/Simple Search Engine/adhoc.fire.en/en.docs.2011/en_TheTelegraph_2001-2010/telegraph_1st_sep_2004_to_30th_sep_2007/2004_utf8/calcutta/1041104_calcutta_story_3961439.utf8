 Chambal terror, puja totem

 - Jailed bandit queen to visit Kali pandals, promote film

 Seema Parihar on her previous visit to the city

 The bandit queen from Chambal is ready to step out of Etawah jail and stride into Kali puja pandals in Calcutta.

 Weeks before the release of Wounded, Seema Parihar will hit town to promote the controversial biographical film and visit a host of Kali puja pandals.

 Seema has been invited by five Kali puja organisers, and if the film?s producers are to be believed, at least four more invites are in the pipeline. All are eager, they say, ?to felicitate a symbol of stree shakti?.

 The Etawah jail in Uttar Pradesh, where she is presently lodged, has already accepted her plea for interim release and a faxed message confirming this has been sent to the event managers in Calcutta. ?She is set to arrive here on November 8 and stay for three days,? said Ashok Agarwal.

 Among those accompanying her would be the film?s director Krishna Mishra, who spent his childhood in the city. Seema is set to visit a Kankurgachhi puja powered by Trinamul Congress leader Paresh Pal, followed by a stopover at a club in Bhowanipore en route to a puja pandal in Chetla that plans to recreate Veerappan?s jungle kingdom.

 Pandal hopping apart, Mishra would also aim to cash in on the opportunity to promote his film on Chambal ki rani that is also eyeing an international release. The film that traces Seema?s abduction, rape, forced marriage and her plunge into Chambal?s world of crime, has run into a string of controversies.

 ?We would need heavy police protection during her visit here,? admitted one of the event managers, Debasish Chatterjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Wheels in motion, cut in pay

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should the day?s salary be deducted for all employees for absence on a bandh day? More letters will be published next week

 Stop, or else..: A bandh supporter brings a state bus to a halt 

Piyal Mukherjee

 Lake Town

 Government employees shouldn?t have the luxury of enjoying a paid holiday at the cost of the public exchequer. Hence, a day?s salary must be deducted for government employees who are absent on a bandh day. However, I don?t foresee such a rule being implemented, given that in West Bengal, even the ruling parties call bandhs quite often.

Debyani Basu, 

 Birati

 Bandhs should be the last recourse of political parties to bring an issue in focus. But these days, it has become the primary option for parties in the state. And in an attempt to make a bandh successful they force people to stay indoors. Given the scenario, it would be unfair to deduct the salary of government employees for being absent on bandh days. After all, they themselves will have to finish the work that accumulates on the day.

Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepore

 The day?s salary should definitely be deducted if government employees are absent on a bandh day. Obviously, exception should be made in the case of employees who apply for earned leave or come from areas where traffic was disrupted. No mercy should be shown to the rest as only strict measures can curb the reluctance of employees to attend office on a bandh day.

Milon Chakraborty, 

 Hind Motor

 Salary deduction for absence on a bandh day is not unjustified, provided the government arranges for transportation of employees to and back from the work place.

Ujjal Bbhattacharyya, 

 Salt Lake

 Salary deduction for absence on bandh days is one way of eliminating the effectiveness of bandhs. But the state must adopt a rational approach. It is unfair to deduct the salaries of employees in the absence of proper transportation arrangements. The authorities should take the initiative to find out the reason for absence before making a salary deduction.

Biswanath Pakrashi,

 Serampore 

 All bandhs do not have the same impact. Bandhs called by leading political parties tend to paralyse life. Defying such a bandh might not be a prudent thing to do. In such a situation, the government can deduct salaries only if it arranges for the transportation of employees.

prasanta kumar ghosh, 

 Barasat

 Government employees are supposed to be apolitical. Hence, they must not participate in bandhs and should suffer paycuts for their absence from office on bandh days, provided, of course, they fail to produce medical certificates.

Debashis Pathak,

 Beleghata

 An absentee should lose the day?s salary unless he has a specific reason for being absent on a bandh day. A worker should suffer a paycut for abetting an unconstitutional mode of protest, directly or indirectly. In fact, such an action calls for more severe punishment. However, the deduction of salary should be made without prejudice and also when the ruling party calls the bandh.

Ali Asgar Poonawala,

 Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road

 I don?t think it is a good idea to deduct the day?s salary of employees for being absent on a bandh day. The last few bandhs might not have had much of an impact on day-to-day life, but what about the countless others which did bring life to a halt? Also, employees who live in distant places cannot afford to risk their lives by venturing out on bandh days.

A.K. Ghosh,

 CIT Road 

 Absolutely. No work, no pay, should be the mantra. If we are to move ahead with the other states and countries, the government has to implement this law. Ideally, political parties should be prevented from calling bandhs. If that cannot be done, salary cut is the way to go.

Sayan Banerjee,

 Belgachhia Road

 If public transport is easily available on a bandh day and still an employee is absent, deducting the day?s salary is justified. However, if employees cannot make it to office due to dearth of public transport or violence on the streets, then, obviously, they should not suffer a salary cut.

Sushma Jalan,

 Alipore

 Certainly. If an employee is absent on a bandh day, his or her salary should be deducted. Bandhs are harmful for the society as it means loss of crores of rupees. We have started taking bandhs as paid holidays and thus, are silently supporting parties which call the strikes. Bandhs are harming us more than we realise, and when the judiciary and the government are giving us the support, we, as responsible citizens, should attend work on bandh days or go without payment.

Sulagna Sengupta,

 Convent Road

 Salary deduction for absence on a bandh day will offer no solution to the problem of bandhs. Salary deduction will merely result in higher attendance at government offices, nothing more. People should oppose bandhs on their own rather than for the fear of salary deduction. It should also be kept in mind that high attendance does not ensure work getting done. 

Vaijayanta Chattoraj,

 Bowbazar

 On a bandh day, the day?s salary should be deducted for employees who do not turn up. When the court has declared bandhs as illegal, and against the progress of the nation, no citizen has the right to enjoy a paid holiday. If they want to, they have to face the consequences.

T.R. Anand,

 Sarangabad

 Anyone who is absent from work on a bandh day should suffer a paycut, whether he or she works for the central or state government or even for private companies. Such a move would help to rid the state of the bandh menace.

Indranil Sanyal,

 Dhakuria

 Deduction of salary for being absent on a bandh day is not desirable. Bandhs called by major political parties paralyse the city and finding transportation becomes really difficult. The possibility of violence also cannot be ruled out. There is no reason why employees should take chances by trying to get to work on bandh days given that political parties won?t take the responsibility of people injured in bandh-related incidents. Political parties, and not ordinary people, should be penalised to stop bandhs.

Indranil Sengupta,

 Salt Lake

 Even if a day?s paycut is introduced, it will hardly make an impact on willful absentees who take leave on any bandh day. Bandh calls will also not stop by introducing this system. In fact, matters have reached such a state that most people won?t mind a paycut for enjoying an unexpected holiday, especially if it comes after a weekend or another holiday. A harsher measure, like a fine along with a paycut or temporary suspension, might help in improving the work culture in the state.

S. Bhattacharya,

 Deb Lane

 An employee should be granted leave on bandh days, if he or she applies for it. My father was a state government employee who used to attend office on bandh days. He was not very healthy and hence, we used to constantly worry about his whereabouts on bandh days. I don?t think it?s fair to force people to attend office on bandh days.

Ranadip Ganguly,

 Diamond Park

 A bandh results in loss of hundreds of crores of rupees for the economy. So, there is no reason why employees shouldn?t suffer a paycut for being absent on the day. Such a rule would send out the message that work culture is not totally absent in the state.

Subhobrata Basu,

 Ballygunge Station Road

 Bandhs are detrimental to the development of the society and people can help prevent them by going to office and not enjoying ?forced holidays?. If people fail to realise their duty, the government has no option but to start deducting salaries for absence on bandh days. Obviously, the government should ensure easy availability of public transport on bandh days.

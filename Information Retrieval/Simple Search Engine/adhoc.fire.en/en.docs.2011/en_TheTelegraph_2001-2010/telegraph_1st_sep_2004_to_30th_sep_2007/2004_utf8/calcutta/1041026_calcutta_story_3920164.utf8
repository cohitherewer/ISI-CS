The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 To fight the killer

 With the menace of AIDS assuming dangerous proportions in modern society, it is essential to make citizens aware about this deadly disease and help counter its rising incidence. Produced by Ensemble in collaboration with Action-Aid India, the two short plays, Aparadh and Proti Chhoy Second, highlight the critical issues relevant to AIDS and make an effort to remove misconceptions and erroneous beliefs regarding the cause of this dreaded disease. Set in the relaxed atmosphere of a cafeteria, Proti Chhoy Second is concerned with dissipating a crisis that develops when one among its regular patrons is detected as being HIV positive. The play initially records the typical reactions of people misinformed about AIDS when they suddenly confront someone afflicted by it. Though there is palpable tension in the air, a series of categorical arguments finally helps dispel the misinformation and taboos about AIDS which drive its victims to face social ostracism, often leading them to end their own lives. Ending on a positive note, this AIDS awareness play is directed by Sohag Sen.

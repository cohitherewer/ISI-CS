 Desert rhapsody

 The call of the desert is indeed alluring at a time when the city is under the spell of incessant showers. And what could be better than an evening spent enjoying the performances of music and dance by the folk artistes of the deserts of Rajasthan? Presented by Thar Lok Kala Sansthan of Bhinyad, in Rajasthan?s Barmer district, Songs and Dances of the Desert is a programme of folk songs, music and dances, featuring compositions by Langa-Mangniar singers, devotional songs, musical instruments played by children, and Kalbeliya, Bhawai, Terahtali and Ghoomar dances performed by women, all to the accompaniment of Rajasthani folk musical instruments. The Langa-Mangniar songs, essentially folk numbers but resembling classical music in style and presentation, are unique in the sense that though they are sung by Muslim singers, they are performed at various Hindu religious and festive occasions. The bhajans of Lord Shiva, Lord Krishna and Lord Rama inspire devotional sentiments, while the dangerously intricate movements of dancers balancing utensils on their heads and swords in their mouths, evoke feelings no less than wonder and admiration.

 Event: Programme of folk songs, music and dances from Rajasthan

 When: Today at 6 pm

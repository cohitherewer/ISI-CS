 Stronger vigil for sound 

 JAYANTA BASU

 The pollution control board has decided to be more vigilant in certain pockets of the city on Kali puja and Diwali.

 Complaints received in the past two years suggest that maximum violation of norms regarding use of crackers and loudspeakers take place in the Jadavpur, Regent Park, Behala, Lake Town, Kasba, Cossipore and Dum Dum areas. A large number of complaints poured in from Barasat and Sonarpur, too.

 ?It?s a fact that we receive much more complaints from these pockets than from the rest of the city. We?ll be more vigilant in these areas this year,? said Shyamal Sarkar, member-secretary of West Bengal Pollution Control Board. Of the 70 complaints received in 2003 and 59 in 2002, most were from these fringe areas. 

 Milon Kanti Das, deputy superintendent of police and nodal officer of noise pollution control in South 24-Parganas, too, said his department will be extra alert in the pockets that had witnessed large-scale violation of norms in the past couple of years.

 ?There were, however, a few complaints from posh areas of south Calcutta. The violations, especially bursting of banned crackers, mostly took place in big housing complexes,? said a senior official of the board. 

 In pre-Kali puja raids this year, the board has seized more than seven lakh banned crackers (around 350 kg) in Mahestala, Budge Budge, Baruipur and Barasat. Seven persons were arrested in this connection, said board chairman Prof Sudip Banerjee.

 In a major haul on Monday, a team from the board had seized a large number of banned crackers from M/S Jangi Das Nurula, in Barasat. The unit, one of the biggest suppliers of crackers in the state, has been fined for hoarding banned items. The owner was summoned by the board?s law officer on Tuesday.

 ?The unit, despite not having a no-objection certificate, was selling crackers that can produce sound between 90 and 125 decibels (dB),? said a board source. 

 The board has allowed eight units to produce banned fireworks, to be sold outside the state. It?s believed some of them have found their way into local markets.

 Among the banned fireworks are chocolate bombs, chain crackers, kali patkas, dhani patkas, dodomas and rocket bombs. 

 ?Those crackers have been banned that can produce sound more than 90 dB at a distance of 5 m. And according to a Supreme Court order, bursting of any type of cracker is banned after 10 pm,? informed board chairman Prof Banerjee.

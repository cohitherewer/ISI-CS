The wedding season has finally arrived and the yagnas 

are lighting up across town. If you are tying the knot this winter, it?s time 

you started following a strict beauty regimen to be able to flaunt your finery 

to full effect. And while for the big makeover on the Big Day you are likely to 

queue up for professional help, you might just give yourself a dress rehearsal 

to get a preview of the final result. Make-up artiste Jolly Chandra of Satin Rose 

parlour in Salt Lake takes model Misha through the various steps associated with 

a bridal makeover.

Squeaky clean

Like with any make-up session, the first step for 

a perfect bridal face is cleansing and toning of the skin. ?Since most brides 

want that fresh-bud feel, we need to cleanse her skin thoroughly to give her a 

soft, innocent glow,? says Jolly.

So, Misha?s face is first cleaned with Biotique?s 

red plum scrub. Once she?s looking fresh, the next step is to close the pores 

with a toner before applying foundation.

?To complete the porcelain look, we?ve used Mac Studio 

Fix which brings the final flawless effect, spreading it evenly all over the face 

and neck,? adds Jolly.

Eye effect

Special care should be taken to accentuate the beauty 

of the eyes. Model Misha does not have very large eyes and hence needs that extra 

darkening of the inner and outer curves with a darker shade.

?We have used a kohl pencil to highlight the eye and 

then smudged it to get the smoky look,? explains Jolly. Since the look of this 

bride is meant to be contemporary, you can dust some gold powder on the entire 

eye area for that extra dab of dazzle.

?We have also made Misha wear brown coloured contact 

lenses to give her eyes a sparkle and look brighter than usual,? says Jolly.

To add volume to the eyelashes, L?Oreal volume mascara 

has been applied. With the eye make-up in place, half the work is really done.

Cheek charm

If your foundation is right, the cheeks are not much 

of a challenge. The cheekbones are crucial to give the face definition, and the 

well-tinted cheeks can make a girl look much brighter and more vibrant.

In keeping with the dazzle theme of the do, a generous 

dose of shimmer has to be used on the cheeks as well.

A blush-on has been used to give Misha?s high cheekbones 

prominence. ?I have used a rust-coloured blush-on in keeping with the colour of 

her attire,? offers Jolly. A co-ordinated lipstick, after an appropriate lip liner, 

is the clincher.

Hair high

On most women?s wedding day the hair is mostly hidden 

by lengths of cloth. But the hair cannot be neglected. Here, instead of the traditional 

plain bun hanging low, the beauty expert has gone for a topknot in the middle 

of the head. The effort obviously is to get a more urbane, smart look as opposed 

to the usual traditional effect.

Add-on appeal

A contemporary bride often prefers to stay away from 

the trouble of applying decorative chandan paste to her forehead.

Instead, bridal bindis have become quite popular 

and readily available. Elaborate stone-studded decorative stick-ons are often 

the embellishment of choice.

?These bindis add to the sparkle and are easy 

to use as well. If they seem too elaborate, you can decrease the number of stickers, 

according to your taste,? suggests Jolly. While an empty forehead might not suit 

the occasion, clutter should be avoided as far as possible.

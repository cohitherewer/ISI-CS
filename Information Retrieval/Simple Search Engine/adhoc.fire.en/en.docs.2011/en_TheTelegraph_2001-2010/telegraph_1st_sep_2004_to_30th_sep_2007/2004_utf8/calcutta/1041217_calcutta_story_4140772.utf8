Warrior prince

The story in Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within 

begins a few years after the conclusion of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. 

The Prince has returned home to Babylon, to find himself hunted by a supernatural 

creature bent on his destruction. Forced to live a life on the run, he seeks counsel 

from an old mystic, who explains that his actions have spawned an immortal incarnation 

of Fate, known as the Dahaka. In his quest to save the Sultan?s palace from destruction, 

the Prince created a rift in the Timeline. Hunted by the Dahaka, the Prince embarks 

on a journey to defy his preordained death. The only way to stay alive, he realises, 

is to travel back and stop the sands of time from being created. There?s more 

grim and grit in the sequel. As before, meticulously animated moves are the mainstay 

of the game (triple somersault, bouncing off walls et al), while great 

graphics are a visually stunning plus.

Santa?s students

Aspiring Santa Claus? learn how to deliver gifts to 

their children from Japan?s one and only authorised Santa Claus trainer, Paradise 

Yamamoto, at a school for budding Santas in Tokyo. About 40 fathers are learning 

how to say a perfect ?ho ho ho? to their kids and how to walk like Santa. Yamamoto 

is the only Japanese with a degree from the International Association of Authorised 

Santa Claus, based in Greenland. (AFP)

Chat masala as shop sop

Retail Riot

Simple sales are pass?. The retail space is abuzz 

with interactive forums designed to engage the customer.

Discussions, chats and interactions have become increasingly 

popular tools to hold shopper attention. While cerebral destinations like bookstores 

including Landmark and Crossword could seem like obvious venues for such events, 

department stores like Pantaloons, Westside and Shoppers? Stop are also using 

innovative platforms as buyer bait.

Issues on the anvil could be purely lifestyle related 

? like hair care and makeovers ? or purely serious ? like healthcare and child 

rearing. 

Pantaloons, hosting a women?s festival titled She 

is U for the third year, has included serious talks and workshops along with the 

usual line-up of fun, games and prizes to be won.

?This is entirely a customer-relationship building 

exercise,? explained a Pantaloons spokesperson. The serious note has been added 

in the form of panel discussions and seminars, which have turned out to be crowd-pullers. 

A talk on fitness and a makeover session last weekend saw, according to officials, 

a ?decent audience coming in?. A session on how to handle young children last 

Saturday was the biggest hit so far.

?Both parents and kids found an open forum to discuss 

their problems and share experiences. With a child psychiatrist handling queries 

from the audience, the session was all the more helpful for a host of parents,? 

the spokesperson added.

The store is planning to wrap up the fortnight on 

Saturday with a discussion on how working women can strike a balance between home 

and office. While retailers feel there are other ways of boosting footfalls apart 

from events, there is no denying that interactive meets help customers feel at 

home. It also gets busy-bee shoppers to spend more time at the store on a single 

visit.

Crossword, the national bookstore chain, which has 

held workshops for children in the summer, recently hosted a music festival with 

musicians from Calcutta and other parts of the country coming in to perform. ?These 

add value to customer?s visits to the store,? explained Sidharth Pansari, owner, 

Crossword. The add-on culture has been built into the framework of the chain as 

a whole, he clarifies. ?Ours is not just a bookstore, it is like a community centre 

for people to meet, so we keep having these events to keep people interested,? 

he said.

With players fighting to be heard above the din on 

retail street, the fight for customer loyalty has become the scene of some wily 

warfare. And till now, at least, the Calcutta consumer has emerged as the apparent 

beneficiary.

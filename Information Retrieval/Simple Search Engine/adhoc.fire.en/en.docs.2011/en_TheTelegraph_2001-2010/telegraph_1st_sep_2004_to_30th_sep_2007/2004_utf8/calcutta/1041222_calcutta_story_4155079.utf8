The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Penalise parties, spare staff

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should the day?s salary be deducted for all employees for absence on a bandh day? More responses will be published next week

 Game for a holiday: A familiar bandh day 

scene

Kaberi Mukherjee

 Santosh Roy Road

It would be extremely unfair if people are penalised 

for failing to reach their workplace on a bandh day. Despite having the best of 

intentions, it might not be possible to come to work on a bandh day. Are we supposed 

to risk life and limb to convince the government that we are not interested in 

enjoying paid holidays on bandhs? Penalise those who call the bandhs and not those 

who have to suffer for it. 

B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

When the government cannot ensure that services remain 

normal on a bandh, how can it expect employees to attend office? It?s pertinent 

that most English-medium schools, where the children of top administrators and 

business tycoons study, remain closed on bandhs. How is it that these people, 

whose work ethics cannot be doubted, do not feel the need to oppose bandhs by 

sending their children to school?

Kanai Saha, 

 Gauri Bari Lane

Considering how daily wage earners suffer due to bandhs, 

it is only fair that government employees also take a paycut for absence on bandhs. 

But those with leave available should certainly be given the opportunity of adjusting 

their absence on bandh days against leave. As for the rest, it would certainly 

be justified to deduct their pays.

R.M. PalMazumdar, 

 Shyamnagar

It is unfair to make government employees the scapegoat 

for the state?s failure to ensure normalcy during bandhs. Employees are not responsible 

for the bandh call in the first place, so they should never be made to suffer 

for its success. In my view, paycut for absence on a bandh is totally unjustified.

Surajit Gupta, 

 Fakir Chand Mitra Street

Whether the court opposes or supports bandhs, it is 

a fact that they can bring life to a standstill. However, if the last few bandhs 

are any indication, it seems that they are losing their potency. If the trend 

continues and people are still reluctant to attend office on bandhs, then it would 

be fair to deduct their salaries. 

Abdul Fateh Kamruddin,

 Chandbati, Hooghly 

Salaries should not be deducted for absence on bandhs. 

The government cannot and will not take the responsibility of employees who venture 

out to attend office on bandhs, so how can it force a paycut on them? No employer 

can make employees take risks that are not unavoidably linked with the job. The 

government?s case is even weaker as the ruling party also calls bandhs. On those 

days, government offices are locked deliberately and police shoo away willing 

workers. 

Sandhya Banerjee, 

 Salt Lake

I agree. That is the only way to compel employees 

to attend office on bandhs instead of letting them enjoy a holiday. The exchequer 

should not incur a loss due to the irresponsibility of politicians and a section 

of employees. 

Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

There should not be a salary cut for absence on a 

bandh. There are codified leave rules for government servants, which cannot be 

overruled by extraneous mandate. Also, if the transport service is disrupted, 

how can employees commute to their workplace despite the best of intentions? Finally, 

if the bandh is called by the ruling party, would the government have the moral 

right to deduct salaries of employees?

Subham Chakraborty,

 Belur

The day?s salary must be deducted for the employees 

who treat a bandh like a holiday. It?s laziness, and not the threat of violence, 

that keeps them home on bandhs. What they do not realise is that the state suffers 

huge losses for their indifference. If the central government employees can take 

a paycut for not attending office on bandhs, the state government employees, too, 

should be ready for the same. 

Pankaj Bhatia,

 Loudon Street

Yes, employees should be docked a day?s salary for 

absence on a bandh. The revenue loss suffered due to a bandh is immense, and efforts 

must be made to prevent that. However, easy availability of public transport should 

be ensured on bandhs before such a rule is implemented.

Dhananjoy Ghosh,

 Baruipur 

If political parties are unscrupulous enough to call 

bandhs in defiance of court orders, why should ordinary people be made to suffer 

for it? The government, being a constitutional functionary, is duty-bound to resist 

a bandh. Citizens have no such compulsion. Who will take the responsibility if 

someone is injured in bandh-related violence? It will be unfair to deduct salaries 

of employees for being absent on a bandh day. 

Basant Kumar Choudhary,

 Kankinara, North 24-Parganas

Formulation of such a rule will have a negative impact 

on employee morale. The government will lose the trust and faith of the people 

who work for it, which in turn, will lead to a decline in the productivity level. 

In trying to be a strict taskmaster, the government might end up with more unfinished 

task in its hands. 

Saptadipa Ghosh, 

 Bhadreshwar

Yes, I think there should be a paycut for absence 

on a bandh. Strikes are not the solution to problems, yet political parties keep 

calling bandhs. The people should, however, try their utmost to ensure that bandhs 

are not successful. Salary deduction for absence on a bandh would go a long way 

in prodding people to do that. 

Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park

If transport is available, one must not stay indoors 

and enjoy a holiday. The government, on its part, must ensure the security of 

individuals before starting to deduct salaries for non-attendance on bandhs. But 

attendance alone should not be enough: work should be done like on any other day. 

Employees must not be victimised in the tussle between the judiciary and the executive 

over bandhs.

Biman saha,

 Lake Town

It might not be possible for an employee, especially 

if he or she is aged or physically challenged, to reach office on a bandh due 

to lack of transport or for fear of violence. It would not be appropriate to deduct 

his or her salary in such a scenario. Political parties must give up calling bandhs 

so that the state does not have to suffer its ill effects. There is no other way 

to counter bandhs.

Mehjibin Yunus,

 Bright Street

The common man does not have faith in bandhs as a 

medium of protest, and hence cares little about the reason for a bandh call. However, 

if people try to go out on bandhs, they face great harassment due to shortage 

of transport. People are also reluctant to take risks, which is natural. It would 

be unjust on the part of government to deduct salaries for absence on bandhs. 

It should explore other ways to make up for the lost work-hours. 

Rounak pal,

 Birati

Bandhs are holidays for most people working in the 

organised sector, but a day of heavy losses for daily-wage-earners. To make the 

babus feel the pinch, a paycut for absence on bandhs is in order. Cooperation 

from all sections of society is needed to weed out bandhs. The best way to do 

that would be by reaching office on the next bandh.

Ajit S. Ganguly,

 Salt Lake

One must be pragmatic while deducting salaries for 

absence on bandhs. Those who suffer a paycut will definitely feel badly done by 

as they were not responsible for the bandh call in any way. In my opinion, salaries 

should only be deducted if the general attendance is over 60 per cent.

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala

Absentee employees should be allowed to explain their 

absence. If the explanation is found to be satisfactory, then their salaries should 

not be deducted. However, employees who have applied for leave or are medically 

unfit should be exempted from the system. Exceptions should also be made for those 

staying far away.

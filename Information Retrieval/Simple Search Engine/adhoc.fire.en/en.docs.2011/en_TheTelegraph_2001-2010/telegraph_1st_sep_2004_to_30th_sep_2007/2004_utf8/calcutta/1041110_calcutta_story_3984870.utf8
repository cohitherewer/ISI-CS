The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flights full in home run

 NISHA LAHIRI

 If you?re planning to fly to Mumbai for Diwali or bhai phota, it?s no trouble at all finding a seat. Getting the return ticket, however, is mission impossible.

 A one-way ticket out of town is all that the airlines can offer for the next few days. Take this: on November 10, there are seats available on all seven flights from Calcutta to Mumbai (three Indian Airlines, two Jet Airways, two Air Sahara), but to fly back home, you better be Superman.

 A spokesperson for Indian Airlines confirms that for the Diwali period, flights from Mumbai to Calcutta are 100 per cent full, while bookings for Mumbai are nowhere near that magic mark.

 Jet Airways? numbers are much the same, leaning heavily towards inbound traffic.

 It?s the why that has airlines and travel agents stumped. If flying home for the festivities is one pull factor, the India-Pakistan cricket match on November 13 is another.

 ?Our inventory department has been turned topsy turvy trying to track the sudden upsurge,? claims an airline official.

 ?This is the first time that there are so many people travelling in this sector during this season,? he adds.

 Manish Sood, director, sales and marketing, Ginaney Travels, adds: ?It is a surprise. Where we would normally make about Rs 10 lakh overall, we are now earning Rs 10 lakh from apex passengers and Rs 8 lakh from the rest. So sales during this phase have actually doubled.?

 Flights are, in fact, being overbooked. ?If there are 100 seats on a flight, about 125 are being sold,? says Sood.

 Victoria Travels is ?advising customers according to availability?, with more requests pouring in but no seats available, while Caravan Travels is having to turn away travellers desperate for a Mumbai-Calcutta ticket.

 Indian Airlines is also witnessing a flurry of arrivals from Delhi, at over 90 per cent, Bangalore and Hyderabad.

 Passenger flow from the Far East, too, has picked up. Thai Airways flights from Bangkok to Calcutta are going full up, although the outbound segment is low, says S.C. Kapur, district sales manager, eastern India.

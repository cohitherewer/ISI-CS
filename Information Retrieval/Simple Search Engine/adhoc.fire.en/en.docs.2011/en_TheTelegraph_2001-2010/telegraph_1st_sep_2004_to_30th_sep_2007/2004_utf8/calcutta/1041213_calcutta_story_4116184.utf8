The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Measured for entertainment

 The theatre circuit in the city being bitten by the Shakespeare bug, this week too starts off with Jadavpur University Department of Englishs (JUDE) performance of Measure for Measure. A play that has amused as well as perplexed audiences and critics alike for centuries, this evening?s show is presented by undergraduate and graduate students in a novel style that successfully experiments with an unusual concept of acting. Traditionally designated to the genre of a dark comedy for its ambiguous approach to moral issues though ending on an apparently happy note, this production, however, steers clear of pedagogy to provide a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience for the audience. An unconventional, playful way of dealing with the theme of justice versus mercy, along with a complex treatment of law and order, power, authority and sexuality, nevertheless, provide enough intellectual stimulation to the keen theatre enthusiast. Direction: Prof. Ananda Lal.

 Event: Play in English, Measure for Measure, produced by JUDE

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Wings to fly for nimble feet

 It has been a long journey for both of them. From Habra and Sodepur, to Paris, Mexico, Israel, New Zealand They have gone places, and are raring to go further.

 Sujit Karmakar, 36 and Debashis Basu, 37, of the Ananda Shankar Centre for Performing Arts (ASCPA), have been selected among 500 dancers in auditions conducted all over India, Europe and the US to participate in an international production. 

 They will be two of the elite four to perform in Ruins, a presentation by the UK-based Anurekha Ghosh and Company. Ruins, to be choreographed by Kumudini Lakhia, Shobana Jeyasingh and Anurekha Ghosh herself and slated for a spring 2005 premiere in the UK, will aim to combine contemporary movements with martial arts and classical dance forms.

 This is a matter of unbelievable honour for us, said Karmakar, the shyer of the two. Travelling from Habra to Palm Avenue everyday, where he works as trainer with the ASCPA, Sujit remembers his early days in 1986. I had come to ASPCA with my father. That had been my first journey to a city, also the first time I travelled by train. For over two years, my father accompanied me for my weekly classes to the centre. It took Ananda Shankars strict high time you grew up! rebuke that helped Karmakar make his journey alone.

 If Karmakars father, a footballer, had been more than encouraging, Sujit Basus Sodepur family of doctors, lawyers and government job-holders were dead against a boy taking up dance as a profession. They would rather have me pursue a career in the Life Insurance Corporation of India, like my father. But I always had a knack for dancing since school and then had merely applied for the post of professional dancer at ASPCA, in response to an advertisement in 1986, said Basu. Under the impression that a dancer could not get into ASPCA without an insiders help, he was surprised when he got through. That was the beginning and the institute has taken us from there.

 Theirs is a typical story of small town boys making it big. They have worked hard and we have chipped in with help and encouragement, said Tanushree Shankar.

 Both the dancers, each with a Masters degree in kathak from Rabindra Bharati University, have visited many countries with the Ananda Shankar troupe. But this is their first major achievement as individuals in the international arena, where they had been pitted against hundreds from all over the world and emerged winners to dance in Anurekha Ghoshs Ruins. 

 Ghosh found them just right for the production which, she said promises to bring together aspects of classical and contemporary kathak and investigates different levels of the state of ruin of the world and the inner self. 

 With dancers, designers, vocalists and instrumentalists to troop into London in the first week of September for rehearsals, it is time for Basu and Karmakar to pack their bags and get used to a new rhythm of life for the next six months.

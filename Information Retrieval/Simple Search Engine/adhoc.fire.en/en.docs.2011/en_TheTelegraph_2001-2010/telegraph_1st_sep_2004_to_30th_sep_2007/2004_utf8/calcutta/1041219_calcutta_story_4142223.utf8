The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Weeklong window for fun 

One-two, one-two-three? The strains of peppy music 

pick up pace and the bunch of bubbly kids fall into step. They are rehearsing 

for the members? programme, the high point of DKS Week, the annual carousal at 

Dakshin Kalikata Sansad, an alternative party pad during the Christmas-New Year 

week.

Sports is the lifeblood of the south Calcutta club 

housed inside Deshapriya Park and this is the only time in the year when the management 

disrupts sporting activities to usher in the New Year with pomp and pageantry.

?We have coaching schemes in various sports at the 

club, including tennis, cricket and table tennis. If we have social functions 

spread across the year, the continuity is disturbed and the children suffer. So 

a few years ago, we hit upon the concept of the DKS Week to fit in all the festivities 

in the weeklong window,? explains Hironmoy Chatterjee, honorary general secretary 

of the club.

While most big-ticket New Year-eve bashes at the city 

social clubs come for a princely price, the DKS Week promises ?loads of fun and 

colour in a clean atmosphere without burning a deep hole in the pocket?.

The festivities kick off with the children?s Christmas 

party on December 25, followed by the inter-club Antakshari the day after. A musical 

evening with Raghav Chatterjee of Devdas fame is slated for December 27, 

while the members? programme, the showpiece of the gala, is slated for the 28th.

Usha Uthup takes the stage on December 29, while the 

children from the club?s various coaching schemes are set to spice up the 31st 

night party with their choreographed numbers.

The curtains come down on the extended extravaganza 

with the Oindrilla Kundu Memorial bridge championships on January 1 and 2, a meet 

as big as the nationals, with no less than 540 participants vying for top honours 

and Sharmila Tagore giving away the prizes.

?We are essentially a sporting club and all our activities 

are geared towards sports. However, the children need to relax some time to break 

the monotony of rigorous training and our adult members too need time out to relax. 

The DKS Week, which is not a high-flying spectacle like at most social clubs, 

allows them to have a nice time amidst like-minded revellers,? says Chatterjee.

The club also provides a platform for talented youngsters 

to show their mettle in art and music during these festivities. Artistes like 

Shamik Pal, Chandrachud Mukherjee and Barnali Banerjee all got their initial break 

at DKS, the management points out.

The lawns are all lit up these evening as the club 

gets ready to usher in 2005. But once the festivities are through, it?s back to 

business with the ONGC ITF Junior Tennis Championship slated for January 24-29.

Adjudged the ?best organised tournament in 2002 by 

the International Tennis Federation?, the annual major at DKS attracts talented 

juniors from all over the world (picture left shows Ramesh Krishnan with daughter

 Clean-up action at station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The taxi driver-tout-coolie raj at Howrah station may finally be busted before the Pujas, if the state government is to be believed.

 The government on Monday announced a clean-up to be launched at the station in the run-up to the festival.

 State tourism minister Dinesh Dakua said he had discussed the drive with partymen from the district and had sought their support. 

 ?We are trying to instil discipline at the station. Passengers, especially tourists, are often harassed by touts and taxi drivers, who are known to have a nexus with the local police and railway personnel,? Dakua added. 

 The situation, he said, is frightening at night, when the 24-hour taxi booth turns into a den for local goons.

 ?Around 200 volunteers will be pressed into service. They will help keep the touts at bay during the Pujas,? the minister asserted.

 Asked whether the volunteers would be party cadre, Dakua replied: ?They will be social workers.?

 Dakua has called a meeting on October 6 with top bosses of the railways, superintendent of the railway police, the local MLA and MP and the Howrah mayor to review the security scenario at the station.

 The minister denied that the taxi unions, touts and coolies were backed by Citu. ?Had they been under the Citu umbrella, things may not have gone out of hand,? he said.

 Makeover magic

A basic aesthetic sense and the right attitude 

are musts to make it as a make-up artist, says Aniruddha Chakladar

 Make-up 

can do wonders is the most common phrase used nowadays. It is believed to be capable 

of transforming a plain Jane into a glamorous starlet. The biggest mistake most 

people in the profession seem to make is in doing away with a personality completely 

and creating an artificial fa?ade instead. The very aura and essence of a person 

must come out at all times and the use of make-up is simply to enhance and not 

transform that aura. The extrovert, the introvert, the shy, the coquettish will 

each have her own style of make-up. 

Two essential attributes required to make it in this profession are a basic aesthetic 

sense and the right attitude. This is a creative job and in my opinion you either 

have it or you don?t. Anybody can learn those certain amateurish dos and don?ts 

in applying make-up but without that creative instinct and flair, there really 

is no point. If you cannot visualise the person?s aura and change through make-up, 

the profession will seem monotonous and boring.

If you want to broadly categorise three styles in applying make-up, they can be 

the natural, nude look (which gives the no-make-up look during the day), the shimmer 

and shine look, and the wild and smoky look. The shimmer look came into vogue 

and with it did hundreds of different varieties of cosmetic products providing 

glitter, both underplayed and in-your-face. The smoky look is adopted to provide 

that extra sensuousness to a person. All these are dependent on the parameters 

drawn by a person?s complexion and personality. Never play around with the fact 

that what suits one person may not suit another.

The Indian woman has always been prided on her incredible eyes. The exotic appeal 

of the eyes can only be defined with the use of a kohl pencil. Very few women 

abroad can carry this off with as much elan as an Indian. I believe in focussing 

more on the eyes than the rest of her face and creating subtle, yet stark nuances 

with it.

What is a social life? What is a personal life? If you want to succeed in this 

profession, no such thing can ever exist. If you think this is a glamorous profession 

comprising dressing up the rich and famous, you are mistaken. Dedication and commitment 

are essential and work must come before all else.

So how do you make a name for yourself? Sheer publicity. The game lies in word-of-mouth 

where one person will tell five, who in return will tell another 20 and so on.

A word of advice: Never think that you have done it all or you can?t go further. 

The biggest competition is yourself. You must live by the motto ? tomorrow?s work 

is always better than today?s.

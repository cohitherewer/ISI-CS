 A gang stormed The Good Companions, an outlet for charitable items on Russel Street, around 4 pm on Wednesday and ransacked it, after assaulting all 17 elderly women volunteers working there.

 ?It was outrageous, the way the 30-odd attackers roughed up the women. They hurt my arm,? complained chairperson Shukla Chaudhuri, holding up her wrist that had swollen to twice its size.

 Late on Wednesday, Subrata Ghosh, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station, said: ?We are aware of the incident but the details are not clear as yet. We will first hear out all the sides involved before responding to the preliminary complaint.?

 The volunteers who were beaten up and evicted from the shop claimed the attackers were led by Mary Ann Mukherjee and her brother Charles Mantosh, who is, apparently, keen to expand Floriana restaurant next to The Good Companions. 

 ?For the past few months, the charitable institution had been receiving threat calls from the Mantoshes. A first information report was lodged with Shakespeare Sarani police station on Wednesday morning,? said lawyer Bikramjit Banerjee.

 Officials of Floriana, when contacted, said owner Mantosh was not present at the time. He could not be reached on his cell phone either. A man who identified himself as Mantosh?s son said his father was in Delhi and so, could not have been involved in the incident. He also claimed that Floriana?s owners were the Kumars, and not the Mantoshes.

 Around 4.30 pm, the women at the 70-year-old institution stood in shocked silence outside the outlet, with its shutters down. 

 The injured were taken to SSKM Hospital after two plainclothesmen from the local police station arrived in a taxi. 

 One of them told Chaudhuri that police were preoccupied with the cricket at Eden Gardens and it would take time to start the investigation. The cops finally did take a look around the building.

 ?The men in the gang were mostly burly waiters and staff members of Floriana,? alleged Rani Gujral, a volunteer who was assaulted. 

 ?They barged into the outlet, started beating us up and pushing us out of the premises,? she added. 

 The victims alleged Mantosh had been planning to expand his eatery. The move would require breaking down the wall separating the two establishments, and The Good Companions having to vacate the address.

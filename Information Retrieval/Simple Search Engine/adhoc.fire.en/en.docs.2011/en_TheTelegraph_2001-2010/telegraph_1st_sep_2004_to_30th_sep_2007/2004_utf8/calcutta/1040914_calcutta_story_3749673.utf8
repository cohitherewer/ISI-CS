 - Pranab asks Laloo for funds to buy Lake oustees housing plot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee has assured settlers along the railway tracks at the Dhakuria Lakes of alternative accommodation under the Valmiki Ambedkar Abasan Yojana.

 On September 3, Justice Barin Ghosh of the high court had given the railways three weeks to evict around 19,000 settlers from along the tracks between Ballygunge and Tollygunge stations. 

 The order followed a case regarding pollution in Rabindra Sarobar, which the settlers use for bathing and washing clothes and utensils.

 Mukherjee, also state Congress chief, has sought funds from railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav for buying a plot from the state government to build a housing estate for the oustees.

 ?Pranabda told us that Lalooji has agreed to allot a lumpsum amount, which we can offer to the government for the plot. The housing estate can be set up under the Valmiki Ambedkar Abasan Yojana,? said Sougata Roy, president of the Gobindapur Railway Colony Sangram Committee. 

 Roy, also Trinamul Congress MLA from Dhakuria, met Mukherjee on Saturday to discuss the rehabilitation package. ?Pranabda is serious about the rehabilitation of around 19,000 settlers. I believe they will leave the place without any resistance if they are assured of an alternative accommodation,? Roy added. 

 The Sangram Committee, on its part, has called off its month-long agitation plan. ?We had decided to hold a relay dharna from Monday on the banks of the Lake to protest the proposed eviction. But it has been called off following the assurance,? said Ratan De, a local councillor associated with the committee.

 Sukhendu Shekar Roy, the settlers? lawyer, said he?ll pray for more time when the case comes up for hearing later this month. He expressed the hope that the railways would not oppose his prayer. 

 Eastern Railway officials said they had handed over all documents to the police last week. ?It?s up to them to decide on the date of eviction,? a spokesman said.

 Aryan sounds better than me: Shah Rukh

 From Veer Pratap Singh to Mr Lajawab, Shah Rukh Khan is scripting a new chapter in his acting career. Like most of his Hollywood counterparts, King Khan has finally taken up the challenge of lending his voice to an animation film ? the desi version of The Incredibles. In this interview to Metro, SRK talks about the experience.

Did you say yes to the project because of your 

son, Aryan?

 Yes, when my son saw the stills of the film, he said that only a real hero would do this film. So when SPE Films India approached me, I just had to take it up. I only hope my voice does justice to Mr Lajawab. Neither Aryan nor myself has seen the final result yet. It was a nice way to learn how Disney has different ways and reasoning of making a film.

 nHow did Aryan take to the recording studio? Did you have to guide him or is he a natural actor like his dad?

 Sometimes during the dubbing of the film, there would be a word or a line which he was unable to understand and I did help him out. But that?s because today?s children have a limited attention span. They want to finish off their work very quickly. During the dubbing, I realised that a child acts very differently from the way we professionals act. But the beauty is that when kids do it, they do it in the purest form ? in a simple way, right from the heart. It is not perfection that art looks for, it is what is felt from the heart. No wonder Aryan sounds much better than me in the film.

Tell us something about the film?

 It is a complete family entertainer and has all the elements in it to appeal to the Indian audiences. Also, with the Christmas holidays approaching, the timing for the release is perfect. During these holidays, one should leave everything and just watch Hum Hai Lajawab. It won?t let you down. This film is for everyone ? grown-ups, children and teens. Javed Jaffery has translated it brilliantly. There is also a message at the end of the film, of good triumphing over bad.

 nAnimation is a big thing abroad. But why aren?t Hollywood animation flicks taken seriously here? Animation has been in our industry for many years now, though it?s still in its infancy. Raj Kapoor had said that he learnt his film-making from the comic strips he used to read. It has always been my dream to learn how animation is done. That?s why I wanted to be a part of The Incredibles, be it dubbing, or even if I were supposed to draw a single line in the movie. I?m sure this movie will open up new doors in India.

What preparations did you have to take for the 

dubbing?

 The character I lend my voice to is a big man with huge muscles and I thought I would need to alter my voice. But the Disney team was very kind and told me to talk just the way I do. I did keep my voice a little deeper than usual. But this was the first time I felt responsible for someone else, because usually when I dub for my own films, I know it?s for my character but this time I felt if I didn?t do it right I would let Mr Lajawab down.

 I think he is very cool in the way he speaks. Sometimes he is so cool that I don?t feel I?m cool enough! 

 Which cartoon character does Shah Rukh Khan identify 

the most?

 There is great similarity between Mr Lajawab and me! The similarity is the softness of the character. He is very loveable. And that?s what I like most about him. Mr Incredible is like a big bear. He is about 6 feet 4 inches tall, but he is a gentleman ? very charismatic, generous and adorable. I would like to believe that I am as kind as he is. There is a certain amount of respect given to a guy so huge but so gentle and sweet at the same time.

How was the experience of working with Disney?

 A wonderful learning experience. It has got me to understand this genre better and I would definitely like to participate in more such movies.

 The entire Disney team is a lot of fun to work with. They make people around them feel extremely comfortable. Beyond the professionalism and the work that they do, is how they do it. I think this is a childlike quality that is most endearing and even me as a producer or a distributor wanting to release a film would not have the excitement that Disney shares. I think it?s extremely contagious.

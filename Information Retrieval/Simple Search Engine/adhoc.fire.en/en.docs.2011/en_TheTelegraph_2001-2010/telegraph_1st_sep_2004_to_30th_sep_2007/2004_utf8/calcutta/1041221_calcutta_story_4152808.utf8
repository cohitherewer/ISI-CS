The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Behind the bar

The festive days are round the corner and you must 

have already got your act together with cakes and wines ready to raise a toast 

to Santa. While the occasion requires you to try your hand at making some wine 

at home, don?t feel left out from the festivities in case you?re a non-drinker. 

Give the usual sweet and heavy mocktails a miss for once and try out some tea 

concoctions instead.

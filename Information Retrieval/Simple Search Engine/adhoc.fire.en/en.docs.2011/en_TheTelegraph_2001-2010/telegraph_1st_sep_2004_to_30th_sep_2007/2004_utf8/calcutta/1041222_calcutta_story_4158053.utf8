The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Deal inked for broadband tie-up

 - Home Netway eyes 1.3 million cable homes 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 State nodal agency Webel and Reliance Infocomm on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to jointly provide broadband products /services to residential customers in West Bengal through a network of cable operators.

 The Home Netway broadband services will include television, telephony, Internet, video-on-demand and interactive video games.

 Rajesh Tiwari, president, business development, Reliance Industries, said: ?The tie-up with Webel will give us an opportunity to tap an estimated 1.3 million cable homes across the state. We plan to cover 193 cities in the first phase and extend the service to all 5,000 locations where the communications business will be present.?

 S.K. Mitra, managing director, Webel, said: ?We already have more than 2,000 cable operators under our umbrella. We plan to rope in 10,000 more in the next three months. There are around 20,000 cable operators across the state.?

 Webel is eyeing a 25 per cent share of the estimated Rs 1,000-crore market in the first year of operations.

 The services will be introduced in two phases. The first phase will cover wireline voice (basic telephony) and Internet services. Video-on-demand and interactive video games will be deployed in the second phase.

 Reliance Infocomm will commission the broadband products in Calcutta in the first stage and later extend it across the state. As per terms of the MoU, Webel has conferred the status of ?most preferred partner? on Reliance Infocomm. 

 However, in case Reliance Infocomm wants to expedite the roll-out process, it may seek third-party assistance in consultation with Webel.

 According to the agreement, Reliance Infocomm requires Webel to interface with the master control rooms and local cable operators for deployment of broadband products and services.

 The agency will also utilise its domain knowledge in the cable industry to develop the market for broadband. 

 Webel will enable faster processing of necessary permissions and clearances to facilitate rapid and cost-effective rollout of services. 

 The agreement does not cover the existing ISP business of Webel, though this will not affect the broadband rollout. Reliance Infocomm and Webel will work jointly for a year and then renew ties, depending on the performance and quality of service, though the contract is valid for two years. 

 Tiwari added that with a countrywide optic-fibre backbone, Reliance Infocomm plans to centralise all broadband services at the data hub in Jamnagar.

 Reliance Infocomm is expected to announce the commercial launch of Home Netway in mid-2005 and is engaged in a pilot project with cable operators in Mumbai.

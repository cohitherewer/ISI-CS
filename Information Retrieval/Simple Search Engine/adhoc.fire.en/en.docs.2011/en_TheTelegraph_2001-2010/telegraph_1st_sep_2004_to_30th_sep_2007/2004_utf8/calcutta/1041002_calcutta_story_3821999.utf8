The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Recently, the stretch from Ultadanga to Kankurgachhi crossing was widened by 

reducing the width of the pavements on either side. The vendors who used to sit 

on the pavements earlier, have now occupied a part of the carriageway itself. 

The whole purpose of the road widening work has thus failed. The problem gets 

aggravated as taxis also park on the roadside, right next to these vendors. Will 

the Corporation and the police take stringent measures immediately?

 The hoarding displaying an advertisement of Derby Special is proof of the level 

consumerism has stooped to. The ad features a bottle encapsulating the contours 

of a girl. It is visual pollution, if not pornography. Can?t our chief minister, 

who is known for his inclination towards all things cultural, do anything against 

this advertisement which borders on vulgarity? 

 Sunrit Deb, Beadon Street. 

 For a long time now, the statue of Mahatma Gandhi on Mayo Road has been lying 

uncared for. The street lights near the statue do not glow. It seems the authorities 

put in efforts to maintain the statue and its vicinity only before Gandhi jayanti. 

The Corporation is requested to instal the statue at its original Park Street 

site.

 Last month, when I went to the Circus Avenue post office to pay my telephone 

bill I was surprised to see the unusually long queue. On inquiry, I came to know 

that a lone counter was handling telephone bills as well as money orders. Till 

a few months back, there were two counters. This made the work easier and faster. 

Two of us went to the post master to complain about it but we were told that there 

was lack of manpower. However, we noticed that two staff members were vending 

stamps ? something that could have been easily managed by one.

 A particular neighbour of mine has dumped his worn down car on my property. 

Repeated complaints with the police have not yielded any results. Once the car 

owner was summoned by the police but he refused to cooperate, saying that only 

the public vehicles department (PVD) has the right to ask for the car documents. 

But as per practice, isn?t the PVD supposed to be informed about such cases by 

the police? I request the PVD director to clarify.

 S.K Datta, Haji Mohasin Road.

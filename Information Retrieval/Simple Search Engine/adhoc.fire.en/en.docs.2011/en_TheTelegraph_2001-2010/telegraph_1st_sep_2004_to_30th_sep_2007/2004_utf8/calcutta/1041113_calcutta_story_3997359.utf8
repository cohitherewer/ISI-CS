The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

 If you don?t like cricket, don?t even think about 

leaving the house this weekend. Because if there is one thing you can count on, 

there will be no other conversation to be had, with the city swamped by cricket 

players, cricket fans and even a cricket restaurant.

Mixed menu

Whatever Sourav does on Saturday?s pitch, he is sure 

to be the most talked about of all. Because next to cricket, what Calcutta loves 

most is a good meal. The skipper?s Food Pavilion will be the place to be seen 

at if you manage a toe in.

Ticket ticker

Getting a toe into the stadium may not be quite as 

difficult. There is much chatter amongst those who want to get a seat for the 

Big Match. More measured calls are being made by those looking to off-load their 

passes. Like some shrewd life members overheard hawking a hot seat in the clubhouse 

for Rs 3,000, and counting.

Arms amp; the fan

With so many legends being feted at the BCCI?s platinum 

jubilee, pull out your cricket trivia books and find out just what made these 

greats so great. After gaping at Immy, get into gear for the real thing, armed 

with serious Diwali ammo ? for win or loss.

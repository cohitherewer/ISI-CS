 TODDLER TRENDS: There?s high fashion and cool casuals, and kids are crazy about them. Picture by Pabitra Das

 Anuj Mazumdar loves to shop for clothes. The first thing he does when he enters the store with his mother is race to the T-shirt counter, where he heads straight for bright colours, fast cars, cricket balls and Bob the Builder. Anuj Mazumdar is two years old.

 Anuj may be only a few months into Montessori school, but when it comes to clothes, he knows what?s in and what?s out. More important, he knows exactly what he wants, and gets it, too. Because mother Sumita knows that if the garments in the cupboard are not to his liking, that?s where they?ll stay.

 Kids are clearly finding fashion before finding their feet. Vardaan Market or Forum, cheap or expensive, formal wear or cool casuals, party gear or designer denims ? everything?s available in the latest styles, colours and prints, in the smallest of sizes. From baby bathrobes and special hats for party dresses, matching underwear (to even don over nappies) for girls and slogan vests and detachable pants (full or three-quarter) for the boys ? there?s no dearth of trendy threads for toddlers.

 Three-year-old Anamika Ghosh is a tomboy, so her preference is for the sporty look. Embroidered denims ? ?especially at the hem on capri pants? clarifies her mother Koel ? are her favourites, with matching but bright T-shirts and tops with spaghetti straps, teamed with a pair of sneakers.

 Strictly no frills, please. ?Anything I buy that she doesn?t like, she straightaway tells me to change it,? adds Koel.

 With the babies growing by the month, they form a chunk of the retail revenue to reckon with ? 13 per cent of total sales at Pantaloons and about 10 per cent at Shoppers? Stop. Understandable, then, that they have entire sections dedicated to their apparel in big stores.

 The big brands flooding the market range from Rough, Weekender, Stop Kids, Freelook and Little Kangaroo to Tantra T-shirts, Ginny amp; Johnny, Disney and Warner collections.

 Shopaholic or spendthrift, there?s plenty of choice to keep the tiny ones busy. And happy. Still in a cradle or a twinkling little star in Montessori, pester power starts early.

 ?Nowadays, whatever is available for adults is also in stock for kids, from infants to teens, sometimes even better. That?s mainly because it doesn?t matter that they?ll outgrow the clothes soon, as long as they look good,? feels Suresh Sadhwani, store manager, Pantaloons, 22 Camac Street.

 Stocks are updated with new designs every season, from summer-spring and autumn-winter at Shoppers? Stop to the festive period at Pantaloons.

 Accessorising, too, is vital. For instance, Anuj loves sunglasses and a cap at the right jaunty angle, to match his casual look (he?s a completely ?shorts person?, clarifies mother Sumita).

 Ethnic outfits, too, are all available, from ghagras to dhotis to sherwanis, as well as formal wear like full shirts and delicate dresses for the party animals. ?But kurtis are the favourites this season for the girls and slogan T-shirts are selling like hot cakes for infant boys,? says Sonali Sanyal Chopra of Shoppers? Stop. 

 With winter fast approaching, woollens are back on the shelves. But as your fashion-conscious toddler will tell you, it?s fancy fleeces and designer jackets that will be hot this season.

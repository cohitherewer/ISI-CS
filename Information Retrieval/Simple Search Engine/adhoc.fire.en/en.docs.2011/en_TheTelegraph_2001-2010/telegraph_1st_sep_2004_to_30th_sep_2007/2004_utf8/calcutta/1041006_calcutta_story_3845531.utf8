 Four arrests sew up case

 OUR BUREAU

 Several twists in the tale later, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Tuesday claimed to have cracked the Susil Pal murder case. 

 Proof of the police claim: the arrest of four ?prime accused?.

 With the owner of a clinic in Bally, Howrah, and his three employees being rounded up, the total number of arrests touched nine and the case, said the CID, was all but solved.

 ?We have solved the murder case by arresting all four culprits who masterminded the murder,? director-general of police Shyamal Dutta said at Writers? Buildings.

 The prize catch was Sebayatan nursing home owner-cum-secretary Biswajyoti Basu, also a member of the CPM?s Bally zonal committee. 

 The CPM leadership was quick to expel Basu and another party member, Subhonarayan Ghosh, arrested earlier.

 Pal, a gynaecologist attached to the Serampore Walsh hospital, had visited a nursing home in Bandel after leaving his Bright Street residence on the morning of July 2.

 He was murdered the same afternoon and his mutilated body was recovered the next morning.

 According to CID sleuths, Basu and his three employees ? Amit Banerjee, Rajiv Nath and Prahlad Sarkar ? had killed Pal ?with sharp instruments? in the second-floor operating theatre of Sebayatan nursing home, in north Howrah, when he refused to carry out an abortion. 

 The woman was five-and-a-half-months pregnant.

 Amit and Prahlad then took the body down in a stretcher, carried it in a Matador van to a canal in Howrah?s Sankrail and dumped it there. 

 The CID acted on a tip-off from an employee of the nursing home, who was witness to the murder.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Folk on a roll, fashion funk for all

The 

Joan Baez poster made the agenda clear near the doorway: ?Every singer needs to 

be serious at some point of time?. Someplace Else rose to the occasion for the 

second time in as many months. Thursday night saw Anjan Dutt and his Music Folk 

present another evening of folk music titled The Poet and the Band.

 And just like the debut do a month ago, which saw Aparna Sen, June and Russi Mody clapping in the audience, this performance had Moon Moon Sen parking herself at the pub for the entire duration of the two-hour-long gig. 

 More star power followed with percussionist Bikram Ghosh joining the singer. Wife Jaya Seal watched in rapt attention as hubby dear launched into a percussion jugalbandi with drummer Chirodeep Lahiri. 

 The marathon session was followed by Anjan?s own number Bandra Blues accompanied by Bikram?s deft groove.

 The beats got louder as drummer Nondon Bagchi joined the Music Folk in Knocking on Heaven?s Door. 

 Squeezed between the special appearances was every folk favourite from Paul Robeson, Joan Baez to Bob Dylan. Son Neel helped pull off the marathon session with equal elan where daddy Anjan left off to catch his breath. 

 But cry hoarse his dad sure did. ?Can we do it Calcutta? 

Can we make some serious music with our glasses of whiskey in hand? Can we do 

it here?? Anjan asked the packed Someplace Else crowd to a resounding ?Yes!? Even 

Incognito and Dublin DJs Saranjit and Harish dropped by to cheer the Dylans and 

the Baezs.

The interaction extended to an invitation to aspiring 

songwriters and singers to join the group a couple of Thursdays thereafter. What 

this particular evening did was set the tone for ?quelling old notions and setting 

the tone for a new language of music?. The closing song said it all: ?We shall 

overcome some day??

 Sole style

 More creative license and the need to ?make a difference in the lives of people who want to look good? propelled 20-something Namrata Kanoi to chuck her export house job and launch her own accessory label. 

 Bags, belts and shoes are her forte but footwear in natural fabrics is what has captured her imagination. ?The use of fabrics allows me to experiment with colours, which would be much more difficult and expensive if I worked with leather,? says the young designer. She uses silk, jute, denim and even brocade as the base for slippers, which are embellished with sequins, copper coins and semi-precious stones to snazzy effect. A pair of flat silk slip-ons with fur straps is what Cinderella would have liked to sport. 

 Retailing from her home in Satyam Apartments at Alipore, Namrata also shows off a range of bags in various shapes that boast of funky patterns in embroidery and patchwork targeted at trendy teens. Ones in more restrained embellishment but bolder colours are meant to be toted at formal parties.

 Glare garb

 No more excuses to take frequent breaks to ease tired eyes at work. Protective eyewear from GKB?s stable has just increased the slog hours. 

 Its top-of-the-line Miyabi collection of light and flexible (you can twist and turn them to unbreakable point) frames available in an assortment of trendy colours make for as much eye candy as protection from computer fatigue. 

 ?The computer vision syndrome is a common phenomenon of our working lives. These glasses are coated with non-reflective electromagnetic elements that filter out the harmful rays and other sight annoyances,? claims Lalit Gupta, marketing director, GKB.

 The latest collection of polycarbonate sun shades in fetching colours like pink, blue, grey and brown from GKB balance the UV vagaries as well. Coming with a 100 per cent UV protection promise, these come in polycarbonate casing that is believed to be lighter than glass and tougher than plastic.

 The success of the range remains to be seen given that a measly one per cent of the Indian population opts for anti-reflection glasses as opposed to a 99 per cent in Japan, 70-75 per cent in France and Germany, 60 per cent in the US and 45-50 per cent in the UK, claims the company. 

 GKB has launched an awareness campaign in all seriousness via interactive sessions and audio-visual films at its centres to promote the cause of hi-tech glasses. 

 The prices start at Rs 800 and go up to Rs 2,000.

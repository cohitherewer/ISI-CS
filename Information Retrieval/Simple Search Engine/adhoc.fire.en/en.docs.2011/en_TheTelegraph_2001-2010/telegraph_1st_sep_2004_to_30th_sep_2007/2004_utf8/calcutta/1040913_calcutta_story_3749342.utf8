The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Power dressing in feminine garb, chicken out of chinese cooking

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI, ZEESHAN JAWED

The 

well-dressed corporate hunk might soon get a complex from his fairer counterpart. 

With Oobe, a women?s wear brand, coming to Calcutta, corporate wear for women 

has taken yet another fresh turn. 

 Bright stripes rule the racks at the first city outlet of the brand, inaugurated on Thursday at City Centre, Salt Lake.

 ?Gone are the days when formal meant either wearing a salwar kurta or a drab white shirt over a skirt. Women now are looking for more options for their workplace wardrobe and Calcutta is no exception,? explained Nilesh Mehta, chairman, Oobe.

 Tailored in pure cotton, the uppers have smart cuts and excellent finish. From short-sleeve tops in pastel shades to checks and stripes on white and cream, the woman will find things to go with both skirts and trousers.

 If the mornings are bright then the nights ought to be jazzy. Check out the club-wear range, available under the same brand, in a selection of electric and night colours with silver streaks, sequins and what you will.

 A range of casuals and denims are also up for grabs as are leather and corduroy jackets for the ensuing winter. Flaunt the brown rugged-look jacket priced at Rs 999 to heat up the winter.

 The price ranges from Rs 399 to Rs 1,299. ?We have 

kept the prices competitive so young executives can afford our clothes easily,? 

said Mehta.

B?day finale

 Someplace Else?s birthday bash may have finally come to an end with the release of a coffee table book about The Park hotel night spot on Saturday, but the revelry is still on.

 Just as one thought the festive fervour had died down after more than a month of special events, the haunt piped up again with desi Latin band Monojit Dutta and the Orient Express on Saturday night.

 Apart from the line-up of Monojit Dutta (percussion, back vocals), Deboprotim Baksi (percussion, vocals), Sourav Chatterjee (percussion), Sankar Das (percussion), Rajkumar Sengupta (guitar and vocals), Dibyendu Mukherjee (lead vocals and percussion), Subhojit Ray (keyboard and vocals) and Sibabrata Biswas (keyboards), the gig saw the talented Tanya Sen make her debut at the pub.

 The Hollywood Salsa Melodies night had the band churning out tracks from blockbusters like Robin Hood, Ghost and My Best Friend?s Wedding.

 Veggie treats 

 Chinese food, the city?s preferred cuisine while eating out, is now finding more favour with the vegetarian community. Moving away from the mainstays of chicken and pork, the lip-smacking favourites are being modified and customised to give the veg-only community more choices than ever before.

 Restaurants all over Calcutta are cashing in on this trend and the latest entrant into the arena is Teej, a vegetarian restaurant on Russell Street, which will, come September 15, unveil its Chinese menu.

 ?People avoid oily and spicy food nowadays, which is why some patrons are cutting down on the usual north Indian fare. This has given demand for Chinese food a boost, by virtue of its taste and preparation,? explained Gaurav Sharma, CEO and development chef at Teej.

 ?Finally we gave in and decided to introduce Chinese food ourselves. But we are still staying vegetarian, given the nature of our clientele,? he added.

 Soups and starters include Mein Chow Soup (flavoured with soy sauce, ginger and garlic), Lemon Coriander Coconut Soup (a creamy concoction flavoured with lemongrass, coconut and coriander), Vegetable Gold Coin and Vegetable Balls in Hot Garlic Sauce.

 For the main course, one can choose from the array of noodles and rice, with a host of vegetable accompaniments. Stir Fried Vegetables with Cashew Nuts, Sweet and Sour Vegetables and Broccoli and Paneer in Lemon Coriander Sauce are a few of the options.

 The new choices on the menu are priced between Rs 70 and Rs 125.

 Sale hour

 The Puja shopping spree has officially begun, with the city witness to week-long sales for everything from garments to microwaves. Catch the last day of the sale at Ice Skating Rink, where a range of products are on show.

 Pick up household goods, from electrical appliances to kitchen gloves, artificial flowers to crockery sets. Fashion jewellery and smart purses are a must-browse for those getting their festive wardrobe together. The scant garment stores have salwar suits and saris on offer.

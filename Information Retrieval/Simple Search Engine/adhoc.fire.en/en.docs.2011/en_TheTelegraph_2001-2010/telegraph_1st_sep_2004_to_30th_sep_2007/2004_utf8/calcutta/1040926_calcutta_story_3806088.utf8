The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Twin treat at the turntable

 Party Hopping

 The leading ladies of the Kabir Sadanand directorial debut, Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao! kept the night trip at Winning Streak on Friday short and simple.

 After a hard day?s work, which included everything from a lunch at Starstruck to music musing at a city store, Rashmi Nigam and Tanishaa chose to unwind behind the DJ box and not on the floor.

 The two had their own reservations of not getting sporty at the sports bar. Tanishaa was at her prim and propah best. ?I am fine here,? she announced with an air of arrogance that would have done her sister (Kajol, of course) proud.

 She, however, did pick up the headphones and tried to look convincing behind the turntables. Even the voice-over to the Winning Streak crowd was kept straight and swift: ?We have had a blast making the film and we hope you have a great time too.?

 Rashmi, on the other hand, had earlier asked in sheer despair, ?Can you tell me where have all the good men gone?? She went on to come up with her own answer: ?Probably in the US, to study.?

 So when she walked into the HHI nightclub, she was jiving to the beats of Dupatta but refused to take the floor. She did have a lame excuse, though: ?We have to be up by 4 in the morning to catch a flight. We are off to Hyderabad from here for our next promotional stint.?

 As the audio-visual teasers of Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao! kept beaming on the giant screens of the sports bar, both Rashmi and Tanishaa kept staring at their larger-than-life selves, all wide-eyed.The two are making no bones about banking a lot on this fun film for their future careers. ?We saw the film on Thursday night and it really rocks,? they chorused.

 Guess we have to wait till Friday the 1st to get mast, popcorn style!

 Rewind rhythm rules

 He calls his music an irresistible cocktail capable of kicking your spirits to an all-time high. Little wonder then that only Taz could have done justice to the Koi? Mil Gaya number, It?s Magic.

 And yet, the man?s music can be as effective in a Bollywood flick as it can be on the Indipop charts and on the party floor. ?That?s because I classify my music as global pop fusion,? said the face and voice of Stereo Nation, who was in town on Friday for a performance at the TAAI convention.

 The UK-based band that created a rage of sorts with Oh! Carol some years ago, is set to come out with a new album during Diwali. ?Despite being in the business for the past 17 years, I have never released my greatest hits album. This new album, which has a working title of Rewind Selector, will have remixes of my old popular tracks by some very good friends in the business like Bally Sagoo and Apache Indian. There will also be some brand new songs,? says Taz.

 Just the list of music men who have influenced Taz is enough to gauge the range of his rhythm. ?Prince, George Michael, Carpenters, Drifters, R.D. Burman, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Gurdaas Mann ? they have all been big inspirations. I also consider A.R. Rahman a huge source of inspiration. I have bumped into him quite a few times and I hope we can work together some time in the near future.?

 Taz?s Mehbooba has been used recently in a Hollywood film titled New York Minute starring the Olsen sisters, Mary and Kate. ?The response to the track has been very heartening. There are also a lot of film roles on offer from the West and I am seriously considering them,? said the performer.

 The man, who was last seen sizzling with Koena Mitra in a sexy video, is sceptic about the Indian music industry. ?The music Bollywood is producing is high energy stuff. The Indipop music is alive too, but the videos are very revealing. The only thing missing is the melodious side to Indian music, that much-needed classical touch. But then again, so much of westernisation is drawing the foreign audiences to the screen.?

 Come November 15, Taz, along with 

 Stereo Nation, will go for a month-long music tour across 

 15 cities in the country and Calcutta is part of the fixture. 

 The party, has just begun.

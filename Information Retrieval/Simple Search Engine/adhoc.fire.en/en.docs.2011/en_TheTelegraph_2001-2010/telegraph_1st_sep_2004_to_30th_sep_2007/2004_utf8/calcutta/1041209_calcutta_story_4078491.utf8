Grooving to a garage grind 

Plan a Party

Sangita Sultania G. Roy drives home 

a formula for a bash in the car zone

Do

 Park the car out of the garage for the night

 Get a car-wash to paint the interiors in psychedelic colours

 Litter the place with tyres and other car accessories for effect

 Get hold of some hip-hop and R amp;B tracks, or even hip-hop mixes of Hindi 

numbers

Dont

 Plan an elaborate menu, finger food would 

do just fine

 Flaunt designer tags. Worn-out denims and peppy T-shirts would suit the 

occasion best

If your folks aren?t likely to leave town in a hurry 

and you?re desperate to host a blast, take a short cut. Just get the family car 

out of the garage for a night and turn the space into your own party zone. So 

what if it?s just a garage party, you can still rev up in real style. Here?s 

how:

Grease grouse

If the clean-up seems more foul than fun, just spray-paint 

the interiors in psychedelic colours. Throw the fresh-coat bait if your father 

freaks at the colour code. Scour the neighbourhood repair shops for some clean 

tubes and tyres, top them with colourful rugs and cushions and you have a comfortable 

pad to plonk in. The seating should be essentially low to make the place look 

less cramped.

For party people with more drive, event manager Sanchita 

Kushary Bose advises piling up spare tools and other knick-knacks on a wall, for 

authenticity. She would like to jazz it up further with the model of a convertible 

or some other vintage variety and use it as a bar counter.

Restaurateur and avid party animal Naveen Pai of Coffee 

Pai on the other hand, wouldn?t like to cramp the inside space with food and beverages 

and carry the fun outdoors to the lawn or kitchen garden. ?That way you can add 

a whiff of fresh air to indoor privacy,? justifies Navin.

If you have a bigger gathering in mind, try renting 

one of the old warehouses dotting the Taratala, Joka, Tangra and Kidderpore areas. 

Known to hold some wild private parties, the warehouses are far from residential 

complexes and have high ceilings for better sound reverb. Lighting should be elaborate 

to create the illusion of space. Jazzed up with radium and neon lights to lend 

it a nightclub effect, you can party in your own private disco.

Grunge to lounge

The concept of garage parties has roots in the African-American 

community in the US that had limited access to nightclubs. So the music veered 

more towards hip-hop and R amp;B. Even today, the hip-hop mixes of Hindi numbers 

like Sajna ve sajna and Dhoom rule the garage party scene, especially 

in the UK. ?The Indian community there thrives on Punjabi garage for such dos. 

Punchy, bottom-heavy rhythms are the rage, in fact anything with a heavy bass,? 

says DJ Saranjit.

Naveen, on the other hand, prescribes lounge music 

like Buddha Bar and soft rock due to low ceilings, which may cause a bad reverb 

in case of loud, thumping beats. But really, the idea is to go with your kind 

of stuff. In case you?re feeling lost, take our advice and warm up with some good 

classic blues, reggae and soul by artistes like BB King, Van Morrison (Astral 

Weeks), Eric Clapton and Bob Marley. Go on to liven things up with some straight-ahead 

rock as the drinks start to flow. In this category, there?s no beating the eternal 

appeal of songs like (I can?t get no) satisfaction and Jumping 

Jack flash by Rolling Stones, Hotel California by Eagles, Roadhouse 

blues, Light my fire and LA woman by The Doors. To shake a leg 

as the night proceeds, hip-hop comes in handy. We dig tracks like Get busy 

and Phenomenon, apart from old school hip-hop from the stable of Dr 

Dre, Snoop Doggy Dog and P-Diddy. How goes your list?

Finger food

Just dish out fun munch even if blokes expect an elaborate 

menu. You might have to do it because of space constraints, but finger foods and 

neat wraps like sandwiches and tarts can be as much fun as live counters and a 

catered-to bill of fare. Endless rounds of sandwiches, salads, falafels, nachos, 

pita bread with exotic dips like hummus and tzatzaki, mini kathi 

rolls, paneer tikkas, cocktail samosas and delicious 

cheeses can keep up the tempo as well as any five-course feast, if not better. 

In the same spirit, the downers are best pre-mixed as well. Depending on your 

budget you can do wine or Breezers, but lethal punches, especially of the rum 

variety, would go very well with the mood.

Funky flare

You?d best leave your glad rags back home; there?s 

no room for designer tags in a garage grind. Take it easy in worn-out denims, 

pepped up with sporty shirts and tops, preferably of the tied-up variety. It would 

also be good time to show off chunky studded belts and psychedelic scarves and 

bandanas. The mood is casual and funky, so get some body paints to show your true 

party colours!

 Mayor slashes lottery tax

 - Subrata taunts CPM duality to defend boon for hi-tech satta

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee announced on Wednesday a record cutback on the civic tax ? from Rs 15,000 a year to Rs 3,000 per year ? on online lotteries. 

 Mukherjee, who had to face severe criticism from the CPM Opposition members as well as some members of his own party in the monthly meeting of the civic house on Wednesday, said in defence: ?I, too, am against the running of online lotteries in the city.?

 He explained: ?I would have been the happiest person if the state government had banned them altogether. But instead of banning these gambling games, the state government has been collecting two per cent sales tax from the operators.?

 According to civic estimates, over 2,000 online lottery centres are currently operating in the city, and their number is increasing at an alarming rate.

 Trinamul Congress councillors Arup Biswas and Firhad Hakim said the online lottery system is nothing but a technologically-upgraded version of satta. 

 They pointed out that hundreds of poor families are now either on the verge of starvation or heavily in debt, since the bread-earners are addicted to on-line lotteries.

 Justifying his move to reduce the tax, Mukherjee said: ?We had imposed Rs 15,000 as the tax on them, but the high rate of taxation has virtually yielded nothing, since not a single online operator had shelled out the amount.?

 He added: ?Some of them pointed out that since they operate on a commission basis, it was beyond their means to cough up such an exorbitant amount. I hope the inflow of revenue will start now.? 

 Refuting Left Front chief whip Amal Mitra?s charges that he was taking the city in a backward direction, Mukherjee said: ?It is better than the CPM?s duality. They collect sales tax from the operators, while mobilising the party?s youth wing, DYFI, against the online lotteries.?

 The proposal for slashing the tax amount on online lotteries was placed before the civic House on Wednesday.

 Since the Opposition bench did not demand a division and the treasury bench did not want to defer the discussion, it was deemed to have been passed in the civic house. 

 Municipal commissioner Debashis Som pointed out that the civic authorities were not in a position to close down the business or impose penalties if a trader did not pay his trade licence fees.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Buckle up, in size and style

The ubiquitous accessory that holds your 

denims in place can well be a fashion statement and the talking point at parties. 

Ipsita Deb hunts down some haunts to try on the belt that makes your waistline 

wow

You have nothing to wear for the party tomorrow night 

and everybody has already seen the only things you do have. So what do you do? 

Go and splurge on a new outfit or simply alter the style of something you have 

worn before? Fashion accessories provide the perfect ticket to changing the look 

of an outfit, no matter how casual or worn out it may look.

Often, we are too caught up in dressing up what lies 

below ? or above ? the belt. Here, for once, we pause at the dividing line itself 

? the ubiquitous implement that can either be just strapped on to hold your trousers/denims 

in place or emerge as a fashionable navel accessory that can become the talking 

point of a party. Be it leather, suede, reptiles and exotic skins, wooden links, 

plastic strips, plastic links, simple fabrics or even straw, belts can be made 

of anything and everything just to go with the garment.

Till yesterday, belts were rather narrow, made of 

chain, cord or strap and worn on the actual waistline. Today, they are broader 

and more decorative, and are either absolute slaves to gravity or remarkably upwardly 

mobile.

After fabric to form, the focus now has shifted to 

the buckle. Made of wood, metal, plastic or fabric, in square, rectangular, oval 

or triangular shapes, the buckle does much more than bind the belt ?it acts as 

a style statement.

Here?s raiding some favourite belt spots around town.

1 Allenby

This exclusive designer store off Elgin Road is strictly 

up-market. The belts here have an identity of their own with resplendent designs, 

cuts, styles and intricate embroidery. These accessories can transform a casual 

outfit into one perfectly suited for clubbing or a fancy dinner. The broad belts 

are the rage in darker shades with colourful threadwork, beads, sequins and metallic 

embellishments. The price you pay for the classy, designer look is Rs 1,000-plus.

Kaya

?Till a year ago, patchwork, handicrafts and jointed 

fabric belts were everywhere. The look now is more sophisticated and a little 

less loud, perhaps. Patent and authentic leather in dark colours with a diamant? 

broach or buckle seems more suitable to our times,? says designer Komal Sood. 

The buckle, which comes in various shapes and sizes, can be transformed and changed 

according to the need of the garment (and the waistline).

At Kaya, you will find anything from crystal roses 

as a broach and strings of crystals or turquoise beads (?a big colour accessory 

for the season?) as a necklace kind of belt.

?The belts must be moderately thin so as to fit through 

the jeans loops or may slant from the navel to the side of the waist to provide 

a decorative element,? adds Sood. Priced around Rs 850, these belts, too, must 

be worn with care.

Hugli

This lifestyle store has a limited but stylish supply 

of fabric belts. Using silk yarn and cotton, the belts are just right for a feminine, 

sophisticated look. The colours range from red, light brown and darker hues to 

some dual shades of multiple stripes. 

The belts with hand-painted silk yarn may be teamed 

up with skirts or trousers for a formal yet stylised effect. Prices are moderate 

and the wide range makes it affordable for all sections.

Shopping malls

At Forum, despite the varied number of stores, finding 

a belt is not such an easy task. Revolutions stores a number of trendy metallic 

and coloured stone-embellished belts, priced within Rs 1,000. The suede-finish 

and leather belts in different colours are chic and wearable at night and during 

the day.

Nam?s, which imports most of its products from Bangkok, 

feels the need for ?non-leather belts? with small and large inscriptions, patterns 

and small buckles. Catering to the party animal, the belts are very reasonable.

At Bizarre, the hip and trendy store from Delhi, the 

style is ?jhatka?. Colourful glitter and sequinned belts in both narrow 

and broad sizes are the fad.

Stores in Metro Plaza like Shock and Upahar stock 

belts that are very reasonably priced and the in-thing with yuppies. Bronze, silver 

and gold seem to be the rage colours here with coins, beads and studs in different 

shapes and sizes being the order of the day. Strung metal chains and hooped belts 

are most common.

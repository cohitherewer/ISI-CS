The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Quit cloud on Academy revival

 BARUN GHOSH

 The plan to refurbish the Academy of Fine Arts has run aground with trustee board president Russi Mody?s resignation.

 The former Tisco boss quit on October 6, immediately after a joint meeting of the board and the executive committee, called to discuss a ?comprehensive plan? to renovate the Academy. 

 Mody took over as president in 1997, at the instance of Lady Ranu Mookerjee, who had been the chairperson since husband Sir Biren Mookerjee?s death. Lady Ranu died on March 15, 2000. 

 Academy director Colonel (retd) Ashim Kumar Das said on Saturday: ?Mody?s resignation is yet to be accepted. He?s still the board president.? 

 But Mody himself was quite categorical that he would not withdraw the resignation. 

 ?I am 87 and it is almost impossible for me to carry out the job. Moreover, I have been holding the post for over seven-and-a-half years. I believe one should not stick to such a key post for such a long time,? he told Metro. 

 Result: The Rs 3.5-crore plan to refurbish the Academy has run awry. The plan envisages setting up an air-conditioned gallery of international standards, overhauling the museum, upgrading the 735-seat theatre hall-cum-auditorium and putting a fresh coat of paint on the building.

 ?The proposal topped the agenda for the October 6 meeting. But nothing could be discussed, as Mody?s resignation turned out to be the key issue,? said director Das. ?We will have to wait till a new president is appointed,? he added.

 There is also an uncertainty over the board?s next meeting, scheduled to be held in December. 

 The Academy, which has been promoting the fine and performing arts, saw the light of day in a small room of the Indian Museum on August 15, 1933. Maharaja Prodyot Kumar Tagore was the first president.

 The present building on Cathedral Road came up in 1960, on a 1.25-acre plot leased out by the state government. 

 Although there was no formal inauguration of the building, it became functional with an exhibition of 50 paintings by Nandalal Bose. 

 The museum, on the first floor, has 2,709 exhibits, including Tagore?s paintings, manuscripts and memorabilia. ?Besides, robes, caps and some other items which Tagore had gifted to Lady Ranu are on display,? said an official.

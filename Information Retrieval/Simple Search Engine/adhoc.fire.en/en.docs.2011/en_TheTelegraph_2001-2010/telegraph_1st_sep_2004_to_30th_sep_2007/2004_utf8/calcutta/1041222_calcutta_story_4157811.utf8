 Four threads of inspiration

 Animal prints, opulence in black and white, abstract art from European masters and a play of ornament colours; all these and a ?single surprise lehnga?. That?s what the house of Satya Paul promises to unveil on the ramp on Wednesday night.

 Organised in association with Marwar magazine, Emami and Jamin Jewellery Exports, To Kolkata With Love, the fashion extravaganza by the Taj Bengal poolside, will present four exclusive collections by Satya Paul, designed specially for the show.

 The fashion display will be followed by a poetry reading session from the Gitanjali by Shobhaa and husband Dilip De.

 ?The range we are going to present actually combines four different collections with four threads of inspiration,? says Puneet Nanda, design director of Satya Paul.

 The first of the four collections is a unique line of saris inspired by animal prints. ?Last month, we had a show inside the Governor house in Mumbai for the first time ever. It was aimed at raising funds for the Mumbai zoo and so we had done a limited edition of saris with animal prints. The concept worked so well that we decided to develop a whole line of saris on the same lines and bring them to Calcutta,? says Puneet, the son of Satya Paul.

 Though animal prints have always been a favourite with the fashion house, this is the first time an entire line of saris has been designed with them.

 The next collection is all about opulence, though the palette surprisingly is restricted to black, white and gold. The works of European masters like Pollock, Rothko, Gustav and Klimt inspire the third line, while the fourth one plays around with the colours of gems and jewellery.

 ?Satya Paul is all about modernity and tradition meeting paradoxically, and that?s what we will be projecting in this show,? promises Puneet.

 While the collection for the Calcutta show and for three different bridal lines have kept the designer busy for the past few weeks, the Spring Summer 2005 ball has already been set rolling. A concoction of chiffons, georgettes and satins in a riot of yellow and green is what the fashion house has in store for the coming summer.

 ?A lot of modernity is creeping into our work by the way of graphics in the saris and the summer line will see an extension of this. But there will definitely be a very strong segment with flowers,? reveals Puneet, pegging February as the month of unveiling the new line.

 The usual collections will come and go, but Puneet?s focus now is to ?touch the lives of people? through his work. If this October the house did a mega show throughout the country for the cause of breast cancer awareness, next year the cause celebr? would be the environment.

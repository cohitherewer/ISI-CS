 16 ailing children amp; a whale of a picnic

 For seven-year-old Amina (name changed), Thursday had begun days earlier. For a week, she had been bragging to her para friends in Amta about the picnic, going over and over about the dress she would wear, the jewellery she would borrow from her sister Manowara and the fun she would have.

 For, amid constant trips to the hospital, dropping out of school and a nagging depression at home, the Nicco Park visit was bound to be a special outing for Amina and her family. Amina is HIV-positive, as are her mother and younger brother. Her father died recently of the disease.

 But for Amina and her friends and their parents, ailment and anxiety were the last things on their minds, as the kids hunched over their colouring books, or ran on green patches and took toy train rides at Nicco Park on Thursday afternoon. 

 The recreational programme was organised by Child In Need Institute (CINI) and sponsored by Standard Chartered Bank, as part of the world AIDS week observance. 

 Rumeli Das, assistant director of HIV-AIDS programme of CINI Bandhan, said: ?Almost all these children have AIDS, or else have HIV positive parents. Seeing their family wasting away in front of their eyes, losing a parent, dropping out of school because of financial reasons, battling their own diseases? they hardly find any reason to smile.?

 Games and painting have been known to work well in drawing such children from their shells, explained Das. That the method worked well to loosen them up found proof enough in the glowing faces and bright smiles of the 16 children, ranging in age from 18 months to 14 years. 

 From the sit-and-draw contest on the terrace of Nicco Superbowl to the rides on the toy train, Pirate Ship, Merry Go Round and other games, to a lunch of steaming rice, dal, vegetables, chicken, salad and ice-cream, it was fun all the way.

 As gleeful little Misha waited for her turn on the Pirate Ship, dangling her stubby legs from a railing, she sang Bhoomi?s Barandaye Roddur to the best of her baby-gibberish capabilities. 

 Her mother Pratima (name changed), an HIV-infected sex worker, watched with quiet pride, as Misha sang a few other songs her mother had taught her, then smartly rattled off the names of her best friends and all the games she loves playing with them. ?She has been up since 5.30 am today, and would not sit still in excitement,? said her mother.

 Jahanara (name changed) had the same complaint about her five-year-old son Zakirul. ?He kept on harrying me to give him an early bath. He and his sisters had planned to wear their new Id dresses.?

 Akash, 7, hopping up and down on his way to the food tent, had refused food all morning. His mother said: ?I could make him eat only after reaching the park after noon.?

 ?Look, I am not afraid of anything,? said a diminutive Rahul (name changed), climbing out of his boat after a ride. Sticking his tongue out playfully at someone, pulling someone else?s hair, he stopped only for a moment to say: ?I hate school and love playing? I am loving this.? 

 And then to make most of the day, the HIV-positive boy hurried on to look for his next target of mischief.

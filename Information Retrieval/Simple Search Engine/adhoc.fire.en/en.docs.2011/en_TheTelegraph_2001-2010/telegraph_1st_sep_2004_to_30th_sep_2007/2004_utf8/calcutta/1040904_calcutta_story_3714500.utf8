The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mid-September log-in for major player

 - GE Capital confirms modest start for major operations in year ahead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 GE Capital has finally rolled out its plans for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal. At a meeting on Friday with state information technology (IT) minister Manab Mukherjee and IT secretary G.D. Gautama, GE Capital officials Manoj Sharan, vice-president and head of recruitment, and Sunit Tyagi, manager, telecom confirmed that the company would kick off Calcutta operations in the next two weeks.

 They told us that their call centre in the city will be up and running from September 15. Though the company has major plans for Calcutta, it is beginning in a modest way from a 2,500-sq-ft rented space in Bengal Intelligent Park Building of Sector V, said Gautama.

 During the 45-minute meeting at the IT departments office on Camac Street, GE Capital officials told Mukherjee and Gautama that the company was ready with its first line of workforce and the set of equipment to meet the September 15 deadline.

 Along with the specific date, the GE Capital team also presented a detailed time schedule about the companys blueprint for Bengal ranging from investment figures to headcount, project schedule to type of work.

 The leading business process outsourcing company, which offers back-office voice and data services to international clients, has centres in Gurgaon, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Jaipur and Chennai.

 They want to set up a facility on the four acres of land that we have identified for them in Sunrise City, at Nonadanga. Going by the schedule they presented before us, the facility will be complete by September 2005. Over a period of time, they would take the headcount in their city centre to around 3,000, said Gautama.

 Though the company has always remained cagey about sharing the financial outlay involved in its projects, Gautama said GE Capital would be investing around Rs 80 crore to set up the facility off the EM Bypass.

 According to the IT secretary, GE Capitals decision will do the IT and IT-enabled services industry in the state a world of good in terms of boosting brand Bengal.

 The past three months have seen some major players unfolding their future plans revolving around Calcutta (see box).

 The response we are getting of late is encouraging, but GE Capitals affirmation is very important. We have been pursuing the company for the past two years. GE Capital has come to Calcutta after a lot of due diligence and its presence here will surely help us sell the states investment potential better, summed up Gautama.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Blast, fog havoc on train services

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A curtain of dense fog and a bomb blast triggered by suspected Maoists combined to disrupt long-distance train services to Calcutta for the second time in the current week, officials said on Thursday.

 Calcutta-bound passengers of long-distance trains from north India, especially the two Rajdhanis, faced severe difficulties as the trains approached Howrah and Sealdah stations hours behind schedule.

 The blast occurred at 1.10 am at Gurupa station, on the Dhanbad-Gaya section of the East Central Railway, in Bihar, early on Thursday. Suspected Naxalites blew up about a 1.5-metre stretch of railway tracks.

 The Poorva Express and the Amritsar Express were cancelled on Thursday and a number of trains were rescheduled as a result of the dislocation. 

 The blast forced trains like the New Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express and the New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express to halt at Gaya for more than three hours each. 

 The Howrah-bound Rajdhani arrived three hours behind schedule, while the other Rajdhani reached Sealdah six hours late.

 Officials said patrolling has been stepped up on the tracks in zones where Naxalites are active. 

 ?In cases, when there is a gap of 30 minutes, a goods train is being sent first, followed by a bunch of passenger trains,? a senior railway official said.

 ?We heard about the blast inside the train and panicked,? said K. Singh, a resident of Delhi who came to Calcutta by the New Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express.

 Among the trains running behind schedule were the Kalka Mail (13 hours), Poorva Express (24 hours), Mumbai Mail via Allahabad (12 hours), Jodhpur Express (14 hours), Doon Express (15 hours) and the Haate Bazare Express (11 hours). 

 Officials said they were working overtime to bring the situation under control by interchanging rakes.

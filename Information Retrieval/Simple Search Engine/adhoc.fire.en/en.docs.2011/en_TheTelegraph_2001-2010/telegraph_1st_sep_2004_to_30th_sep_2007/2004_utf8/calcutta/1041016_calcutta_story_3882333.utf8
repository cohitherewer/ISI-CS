 The reign of the proletariats

 Sansriti?s latest production, Phataru, is a daringly experimental play with a distinct political message that throws a challenge at the audience: to accept the play with its radical message or leave it as it is. Based on a story by Nabarun Bhattacharya, the play deals with the revolutionary struggles of the subaltern class in trying to destroy the foundations of capitalism. Structurally supported by an apparently absurd and loose plot, the play introduces the audience to its three eccentric characters: Madan, Purandhar Bhatt and DS. In its use of unrealistic dramatic devices, such as its flying militants who can take flight on chanting their magical mantra Phat Phat Sai Sai and a richly metaphoric but imaginary language, lay hidden the radical thoughts and ideas of the three protagonists. Directed by Debesh Chattopadhyay, Phataru takes a bold step towards building a classless society.

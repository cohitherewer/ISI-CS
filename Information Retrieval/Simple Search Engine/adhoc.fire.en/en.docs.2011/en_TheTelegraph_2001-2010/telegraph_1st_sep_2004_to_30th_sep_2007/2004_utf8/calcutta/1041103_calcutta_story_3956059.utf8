 Gate crash, garden bloom

 - Statues to star in mayor?s Rs 3-crore green screen

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Denied a gate, the mayor now has designs on a garden.

 With the Calcutta gateway failing to get off the ground, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has thrown his weight behind a landmark beautification project ? a grand garden opposite Rabindra Sadan.

 Though a joint venture of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Calcutta Police, it is Mukherjee who is steering the conversion of a traditional fairground into a sprawling garden, said a senior civic official. ?This is how he is planning to sign out as mayor,? he added.

 The Rs 3-crore, five-acre green stretching from the south gate of Victoria Memorial Hall to Queensway is slated to be unveiled in March 2005.

 Municipal commissioner Debashis Som has already allotted Rs 2 crore for the project and entrusted director-general (civil) Udayshankar Sengupta to ensure its timely completion.

 The highlights of the project, according to CMC officials, are:

 Forming a buffer zone against pollution

 Creating a beautiful green patch in the heart 

of the city

 Planting more screening plants and fountains 

to check intrusion of pollutants into the Victoria Memorial complex

 Setting up a small food court

 Putting in place a gallery on the heritage 

of the site.

 The most important aspect, they stressed, was the relocation of a few marble statues from the British era that had been uprooted and dumped at the Barrackpore Latbagan 25 years ago. Of the 25 statues banished to Latbagan, five would be reinstalled in the garden.

 Five bronze gates alone would cost Rs 50 lakh and the garden would have over a dozen fountains of variable height, a variety of trees, and a 400-sq-ft freshly dug out waterbody.

 The mayor brushed aside any talk of extravagance. ?It is a matter of outlook. I don?t think of Calcutta as a city of beggars and pavement dwellers,? proclaimed Mukherjee.

 ?The primary objective of the beautification project is to preserve the aesthetic character of the area and to create a proper zone for viewers entering the heritage site,? he added.

 The land in question belongs to the ministry of defence and Calcutta Police is the monitoring authority of the zone on which the garden is coming up. 

 The land for the garden has been made available to the CMC following the high court ban on holding fairs on the Maidan greens.

 CID custody for accused

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The five persons netted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in connection with four-year-old Ganesh Palodhi?s abduction and murder were produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) in Uluberia on Sunday. 

 SDJM Madhuchhanda Basu sent the five accused, who were held at Bauria on December 18, to CID custody for 13 days. 

 ?They will be produced before the court on January 8 for further orders,? the magistrate said. 

 The five ? Haru Sheet, Budo Sheet, Bapi Kumir, Kamal Hudati and Anup Kanrar ? have been charged with abduction, killing and criminal conspiracy.

 ?In the 13 days, we will find out the details of the case from them,? said a CID official. 

 Four-year-old Ganesh Palodhi went missing on December 3 while riding a bicycle in front of his Bauria residence.

 Siddhartha, his father, received ransom calls, initially asking for Rs 25 lakh. 

 The amount was later brought down to Rs 72,300, which was paid.

 On December 21, police recovered the decomposed body of the child from a shallow pit near a fig tree in front of the Palodhi home. 

 The CID sleuths investigating the case had previously rounded up Jagannath Kanrar, a neighbour of the Palodhis and the alleged mastermind of the conspiracy.

 The sleuths said that Chitra Kanrar and Sushankar Manna, wife and brother-in-law of Jagannath, were also interrogated over the abduction-murder. 

 Though director-general of police Shyamal Dutta claimed on Friday that his force had solved the Ganesh Palodhi murder case, the CID officials believe that a number of questions pertaining to the case remain unanswered.

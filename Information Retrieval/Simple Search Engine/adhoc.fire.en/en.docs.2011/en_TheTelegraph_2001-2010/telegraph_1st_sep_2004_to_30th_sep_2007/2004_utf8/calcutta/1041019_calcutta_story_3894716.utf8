 Worship by camaraderie, not creed

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Had he been alive today, Bollywood film-maker Manmohan Desai would have been inspired to make a sequel of Amar Akbar Anthony. For, the Durga puja at New Market is right out of the plot of his blockbuster.

 The puja committee chairman is a Muslim, the president is a Christian, the secretary a Hindu. 

 And the craftsmen erecting the pandal and recreating sequences from Mahabharata and Ramayana in panels are all Muslims. 

 In the 34th year of the puja, organised by New Market 54-Pally Durgotsav Committee, mayor-in-council member Javed Khan is chairman and John Mantos is president. 

 The organisers have neither a club nor a clubroom, but in keeping with the tradition of Bengali hospitality, visitors are treated all afternoon to prasad on Navami. 

 The puja budget this year is under Rs 5 lakh. The joint secretaries of the puja committee, Ajay Gupta and Dilip Sarkar, are reluctant to call it a New Market puja, as the participation of shop-owners is almost negligible. 

 ?We get only Rs 5,500 from the traders of New Market as subscription, even though the total number of shop-owners and vendors in the market is over 5,000,? Gupta said.

 According to chief organiser Kanailal Sonkar, the pandal is being erected by Sheikh Jahangir, while the interior, with motifs depicting Kurukshetra and Ram?s twins, is being carved out of thermocol sheets by Abdul Rashid and Sheikh Moinuddin. All the craftsmen are from Sikol village, in the Shyampur police station area of Howrah.

 Javed Khan and John Mantos said: ?We are happy to be associated with Durga puja.? 

 Khan added: ?Perhaps you don?t know that we, too, like to hit the city and crawl the pandal trail. It is not about religion, but the festive mood that is more vital.? 

 Mantos echoed: ?It is an openness, a sense of togetherness that made our participation possible.?

 This involvement, cutting across community, is more than skin-deep. Abdul Rashid, who was busy carving out a motif of Shiva in the pandal, said: ?I learnt this trade from Ajmer, in Rajasthan, in the 1980s. My guru, Lalchand Sharma, is a Pakistani.?

 Sharma had taught Rashid the art of painting, writing signboards and carving on thermocol.

This is not the first time that Rashid and Moinuddin 

have been associated with the puja. ?We had earlier decorated pandals in Varanasi, 

Jamshedpur and Batanagar,? said Rashid. A studio painter, he has acquired the 

skill of preparing models of deities with materials like plaster of Paris or cement 

and sand.

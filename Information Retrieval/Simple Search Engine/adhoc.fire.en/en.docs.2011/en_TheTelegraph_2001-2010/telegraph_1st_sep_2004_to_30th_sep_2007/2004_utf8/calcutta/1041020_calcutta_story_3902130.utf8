 Children of a lesser goddess

 Puja is the time for revelry and joy. It is also an occasion for mass participation. In an effort to expand this horizon and encourage child participation, Khadim Shoe Private Limited along with Studio PrintArt - Prayasam (an NGO working for child rights) have jointly been organising Sarba Shiksha Sharod Abhiyaan. Stepping into its fourth year, the aim of this parikrama has has been to spread a social message and to encourage children from different socio-economic backgrounds to interact among themselves and, in the process, learn the values of sharing. This year the participants aim to spread awareness on sanitation and hygiene. The two-day event, supported by Kamarhati Municipality, was flagged off by its chairman yesterday at 8 am and ends this evening at 4. Children are penetrating the remotest alleys to visit Puja pandals with slogans and placards on 10 basic principles of sanitation. Today?s parikrama ushers in the children from Child Labour School, Kamarhati for a joy ride. The less-privileged children of Rishi Aurobindo Colony, Dakshindari have volunteered to monitor the proceedings and take care of other children during the day-long pandal-hopping. Participants will have the last word in matters pertaining to their refreshments and the pandals they want to visit. For a day, at least, they will be the monarchs of all they survey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Now, log in and work in Bengali

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Regional is the rage. Following the success of regional television channels, software developers for computers are donning the local look. 

 Imagine a computer environment completely in Bengali, where the menu, programmes and almost everything else appears in the vernacular.

 Bringing that dream closer to realisation, open-source software provider Red Hat has launched Fedora Core 3, a flavour of Linux that will have support for five Indian languages, including Bengali.

 ?With English and Hindi, you can reach out only to a percentage of the population,? said Javed Tapia, director of Red Hat India. ?The regional languages will help reach out to a wider section.?

 The localisation of Linux to Bengali means that when users boot up their PCs, most of the menu items appear in Bengali. They can interact with the computer ? as well as create documents and send emails ? in Bengali.

 Due to the open-source nature of Linux, most of the software is put together by a community of voluntary developers. The Bengali project was started around a year ago by such groups across the country. ?We worked and collaborated with the groups and provided leadership to the community,? Tapia explained.

 Linux, says Tapia, currently has a market share of 5-10 per cent in the desktop segment and 25-30 per cent in the server segment. 

 ?That is some growth, compared to two years ago, when it was almost nil,? he said. ?The interface has undergone changes, software like Open Office have come up and the overall ease of use has improved. I think the Microsoft monopoly has already been broken.? 

 But there are areas in Linux, admits Tapia, where a lot of work needs to be done, including better support for drivers and gaming.

 ?Linux-based computers have their uses in education and governance,? Tapia said. The cost and language options would enable access for children in rural areas. ?Several state governments have already implemented various Linux projects,? Tapia added.

 Apart from Bengali, there will be support for Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi and Tamil in Fedora Core 3. The formal launch of the Bengali version will take place during Infocom 2004, the biggest IT exposition in the east, that gets underway on December 1 in Calcutta.

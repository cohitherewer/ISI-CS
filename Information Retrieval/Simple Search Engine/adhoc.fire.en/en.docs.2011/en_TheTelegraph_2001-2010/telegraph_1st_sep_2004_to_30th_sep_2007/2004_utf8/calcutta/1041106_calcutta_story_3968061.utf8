The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Salute to a splendid address

Guest Column / Ina Puri

Telling the story of Raj Bhavan was a daunting task, 

but from the House of Lords the toil seemed well worth it

When at the historic House of Lords, a personable 

young man came up to me and introduced himself as James Curzon, the grand-nephew 

of Lord Curzon, the erstwhile Governor-General whose Kedleston Hall had been the 

inspiration for the present Raj Bhavan in Calcutta, a sense of disbelief numbed 

my being.

Lord Swraj Paul had just released Raj Bhavan of 

Calcutta before an august gathering and it was already quite an overwhelming 

experience when James added to the euphoria with his warm praise for the book. 

Copies of the book were doing brisk sales and I was pleased that this reception 

at the glittering Attlee Room would benefit some deserving underprivileged children 

in Calcutta since all the royalties were going to the Governor?s Charitable Trust. 

At Lord Paul?s behest, I met some wonderful people, including Baroness Mary Goudie 

and Manek Dalal.

Lady Paul spoke fondly of her long association with 

Calcutta and Shree Nair, whose husband was from the Indian High Commission, and 

reminded me of our last meeting at Minu Tharoor?s home in New York. Dr 

Shekhar Mukherjee, present on the occasion, alone, knew the stress of the last 

three-and-a-half years.

Far away from this moment and luxuriously appointed 

environs of exquisite tapestries, luminous oils and marble busts, another evening 

came to mind. The shadows were lengthening and cassia blossoms in the Raj Bhavan 

gardens reflected the pink of the twilight and as the lights were switched on 

the house looked magnificent. The chandeliers illuminated rows of marble busts 

called the 12 Caesars and it was quite magical till one looked carefully. Then, 

the illusion broke.

Bereft of care, most of the priceless sculpture had 

developed cracks. The heritage building, a symbol of power and grandeur, had down 

the years fallen upon hard times. Everywhere was a genteel patina of decrepitude.

Sharing the concern, Governor Viren J. Shah and his 

wife Anjana Shah told us they intended to turn things around. And true enough, 

so they did. The newly refurbished mansion was reinstated to a semblance of its 

former glory. Anjana Shah?s tireless efforts ensured that the official residence 

of the Governor looked impressive to visiting state guests and dignitaries. Personally, 

I lauded her most for those ingenuous touches ? like the plants she brought in 

to fill vacant corners and the freshly-cut flowers she arranged in the suites 

and offices. The air once dank and malodorous inside the shuttered rooms was now 

open to the sunlight streaming in.

Raj Bhavan opened its doors to the city and soirees 

and concerts became a regular feature. Very often a visitor would be greeted with 

the sight of children scampering around the vast hall or staging a performance 

for the Governor and his guests.

I had occasionally interacted with the Governor and 

his wife when it was discovered there was no inventory of art and artefacts. I 

had been requested that a list be made of the existing ones and we had discussed 

the urgent need to identify capable art restorers to prevent further damage to 

the older works.

Still, it was a great surprise when he commissioned 

me to produce a coffee-table book on Raj Bhavan. I accepted, knowing fully well 

there would be a great deal of balancing between the commissioned expectation 

and my own ideas. In the next three-and-a-half years I would realise I had been 

only too accurate about my predilections. 

For a coffee-table book, equal emphasis had to be 

laid on the visual content and I sought Manjit Bawa?s advice on the matter. I 

had also planned that I would ask Rashmi Kaleka to design the book and Archana 

Press to print it. It had been decided that the panel of writers should be ideally 

based in Calcutta. Fortunately, everyone I approached accepted and I had on board 

scholars like Sukanta Chaudhuri, historian Basudeb Chattopadhyay, architect Probir 

Mitra, art critic Sovon Som, social historians Bunny Gupta and Jaya 

Chaliha and mediaperson Swapan Mullick. After a couple of meetings 

in the Governor?s office or the historic Council Chamber, it was smooth sailing.

Each one had a definite subject defined other than 

Sukantada who offered to write on The City, the Palace and People. When 

I felt the need for voices from the past alongside articles focusing on the present, 

I requested Saroj Mukherjee to write on her experience when she was the 

official hostess to her father, erstwhile Governor Dr Katju.

Later, on my trip to London, I spent a memorable day 

at Alan Tritton?s lovely cottage, surrounded by acres of Chelmsford countryside 

that had once inspired the great artist Constable. From his great collection of 

books I gathered more material ? including Lord Curzon?s Preface. As I was taking 

leave, Tritton gave me some unsettling news ? India and Pakistan were at war. 

It was May 1999.

After returning to Calcutta, my next task was sourcing 

authentic photographs. This was where we faced insurmountable odds. Over the years, 

the majestic Raj Bhavan had been systematically stripped of virtually all its 

antiquities, furniture, silver, porcelain, crystals and a lot of its art works. 

Yet, it was imperative to recreate the interiors in the book to provide a glimpse 

of those days.

At the end of our tether, Manjit and I met the magician 

who would with a wave of his hand produce a treasure. Jayant Patel of Bombay Photo 

Stores offered his amazing collection to us so generously for use in the book. 

Most of the masterly black-and-white photographs were either from his own collection 

or the Shepherd?s archives. In the end we were more than satisfied with what we 

had been able to source in the most unlikeliest of places ? but isn?t that the 

ethos of the city? And it?s quixotic riddle?

The bulk of the present-day photographs of Raj Bhavan 

were taken by Asit Poddar. Sunil K. Dutt added to the aesthetic appeal of the 

book. Sunilda?s marvelous lensmanship had captured not only a fog-shrouded 

Darjeeling Raj Bhavan but also the toy train.

In the midst of the project we had relocated to Delhi 

and the entire operation moved with me! Fortuitously so, as both Rashmi Kaleka 

and Archana Press were based in Delhi. We spent sweltering summer days reviewing 

the layout and design. Finally, dummy in hand, I was boarding a flight to Calcutta 

to show Governor Shah the results.

En route, I stopped at the Penguin office to show 

our labour of love to David Davidar, my meanest critic. Instead of lecturing 

me on the need to concentrate on the other assignments, he called in his marketing 

team and Penguin ended up being the publisher!

A day after the book release at the House of Lords, 

Dr Shekhar drove us to Uffington, famous for its Celtic ?painting? of the White 

Horse. Around us we saw groups of children valiantly trying to fly their kites 

against the wind. I recalled it was, by a strange co-incidence, Viswakarma puja. 

I hope the funds generated from the sales ensure there are a few more children 

flying kites on the streets of my city.

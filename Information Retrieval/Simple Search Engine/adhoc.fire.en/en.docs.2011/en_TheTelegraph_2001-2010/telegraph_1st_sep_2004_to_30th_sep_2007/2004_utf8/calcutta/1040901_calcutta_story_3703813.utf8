 Koena, candid amp; coy

Koena Mitra

I almost broke my bones. Koena Mitra winces at the 

memory of shooting for Musafir. No, the girl from Rashbehari Avenue has 

not done any martial stunts in Sanjay Kaante Guptas forthcoming film. 

It was a dance sequence with Sanjay Dutt that she was dwelling on, over dinner 

at The Park. My costume weighed 25 kg. And boy, did the skirt of coins she wore 

leave its mark There were circular impressions on my body for days, as well 

as cuts and bruises.

 The setting was an open-air tent, created at Mehboob Studios in Mumbai. If Koena had to move (and shake) in the metal outfit, she is quick to add how much effort her co-star Sameera Reddy also put in. She danced to a techno trance number that included a chain-and-fireball routine. 

 Koena, who shifted base to Mumbai after winning the Gladrags title in 2001, debuted with an item number in Road. That song required more emoting than movements, she recounts. It is with Musafir that she is being introduced as an actress and Koena is as candid as she can be about her screen time. My role is a small one. I want to tell people that instead of people telling me that after the film, she clarifies.

 In fact, Koena was to have done just a song in this film as well. But on the sixth day of the shoot, the director offered her a role. No one wants to commit a role without seeing an actor on screen. I am lucky that they had faith in me.

 Sanjay Dutt, who is co-producing the film, is, in Koenas eyes, like a rock star, totally chilled out. But does he still have two left feet on the dance floor? He doesnt need to dance. Such is his body language that even if he was just sitting in a corner, he would look fabulous. No shaking the faith of a fan who has watched every Sanjubaba starrer since Rocky.

 As Anil Kapoors wife (in Musafir), Koena also has a romantic song with the ageing superstar. Anil treated me like a baby. He rehearsed every scene 10-20 times. Where to smile, when to use glycerine I learnt a lot.

 But before you get any ideas, the romance is not of the steamy sort. There are too many actresses in that category now. And if sex had so much selling power, Julie would have been the years biggest hit, concludes Koena.

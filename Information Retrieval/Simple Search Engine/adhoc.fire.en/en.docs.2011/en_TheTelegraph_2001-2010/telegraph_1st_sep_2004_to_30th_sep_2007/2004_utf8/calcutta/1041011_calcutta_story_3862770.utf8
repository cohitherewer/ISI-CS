The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Be your boss, at home

With a large number of men and women opting 

to work out of home, Ipsita Deb lists the basics to kick-start the new 

office address

 Nine-to-five is a thing of the past. The new-wave 

slog roster is all about flexi-hours and tele-commuting, video-conference and 

consultancy. And this has brought with it a large number of men and women working 

out of home.

Add to that a booming entrepreneurial spirit and employees 

breaking free from the corporate rat race to set up their own businesses and agencies. 

Top it off with stay-at-home moms trying to do their own thing.

?After having been in a formal office environment 

for 30 years, I decided to kick off my shoes and work from home. I found it much 

easier to work in a relaxed environment rather than waste several hours merely 

commuting to and from work. Being home means you are accessible at all times and 

if at four in the morning a great idea pops into my head I can store it on my 

computer there and then,? says public relations consultant Rita Bhimani.

The only downside: domestic disruptions. ?For example, 

the cook might barge into my room to tell me that some vegetables need to be bought. 

But here again, on a more optimistic note, I do have ample time to devote to my 

house affairs,? asserts Bhimani.

If you are one of those plucky people with the confidence 

and craft to start out on your own, and wish to keep overheads down by converting 

your address into office-home, here are some basics to get you started.

Set it right

When setting up an office at home, there are many 

aspects to take into account, including supplies, workspace and equipment.

If the office is at ground level, a separate entry 

for clients can be designed to provide privacy. Locate your office in such a way 

that there is minimal noise, space and visual clutter from your living area. 

Adequate lighting is also critical. Invest in at least 

one quality chair with solid arms and back support.

When configuring your home-office, try to keep in 

mind your work habits. Arrange the furniture conveniently. If you will often need 

the file cabinet, make sure the drawers are within arm?s length of your desk. 

Make sure you don?t have to get up to answer the phone. Keep spare chairs handy.

Stay connected

Identify the equipment you will need: personal computers, 

printers, a fax machine, answering machine, telephone and copier. Choose the position 

of your telephone line with care (you might want to keep it close to the computer 

for Internet access). Also, invest in a PC or laptop with enough memory and hard 

drive space for all your work needs. Consider a large, glare-minimising flat-screen 

monitor if you anticipate long hours in front of the computer.

Storage tips

Buy a desk with plenty of drawer space for your home-office. 

Try and get a computer desk, too. This will allow you to set up a larger work 

area. File cabinets and bookcases also help reduce clutter. According to interior 

designers, a safe rule to follow is planning for four file cabinet drawers per 

person per year.

Chi choices

Feng Shui is the ancient art of placement and design 

that is used to balance and enhance the flow of energy in living environments.

?Choose your office room in a place near the entrance. 

Make sure that it is in the south-west corner as this comprises earth and energy 

which will lead to stability and gravitational force in business,? says expert 

Pinky Kapoor.

?Sit in the south-west corner of the room, diagonal 

to the entrance, as opposed to the north-west which signifies movement and hence 

you may not find your place in the office. Do keep the computer or office-related 

data there as this will surely increase your networking skills,? she adds.

While second-hand office furniture may seem like a 

good deal for entrepreneurs on a tight budget, it may have bad chi. Do 

not buy used furniture from a business that went bankrupt, as it may fill your 

office with the energy of anxiety and disappointment.

A large desk provides energetic room for expansive 

thinking and growth. The desk chair represents your support and foundation, so 

make sure it is in good shape for the job.

An office that lacks windows can make you feel isolated 

and out of touch. If your office has small, high windows or no view at all, use 

landscape posters with a far-off horizon. If you have a scenic view, use a large 

wall mirror to reflect into the room and fill it with positive chi.

Wherever you sit, you should look at something that 

makes you happy: a frame of your spouse and children, a much-desired exotic vacation, 

or a mock certificate of the position you wish to reach someday!

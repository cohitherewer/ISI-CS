 Art camp in aid of special children

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A one-day art camp for a worthy cause ? to help out a school named Asha for special children, run by the Army Wives Welfare Association ? was organised on Wednesday at Fort William. 

 About 27 eminent artists, including Ganesh Haloi, Aditya Basak, Deepali Bhattacharya, Jogen Choudhury, Shuvaprasanna, Rabin Mandal, Jaya Ganguly, Jayashree Chakravarty and Prakash Karmakar, participated in it.

 The protegee of one of them had turned up uninvited. There were complaints of art material having disappeared into the thin air. 

 Though many of the artists worked at the venue ? the officers? club that looked far too beautiful to belong to Calcutta ? some had chosen to bring their canvases from home and display them. 

 The event was organised by an NGO named Panchali, that works among women and children in distress. 

 These works will be formally exhibited at the Lalit Kala Akademi in March next year. 

 The event was coordinated by Bhavna Kakar, an art historian based in Delhi.

 Asha had opened in 1992 and is housed at the Command Hospital in Alipore. It has 55 students between the ages of five and 19, most of them from army backgrounds. One is just three. 

 Special facilities are provided for these children with multiple problems. One of the teachers, Jasvinder Bakshi, a special mother herself, said the school has eight teachers and the children are taught music, production of detergent powder, drawing and painting, computers and also cooking.

 Nilanjan Banerjee, 27, deaf and mute himself and also a senior student at the school, teaches his fellow-students drawing and painting. 

 He used to study at the Beltala school for deaf and mute children himself, says the young man, who can just manage to articulate himself.

 Among the younger students was a boy from Chennai named Michael Jackson, both of whose parents are from the army. He says he loves to paint and dance, and as evidence, he had created a basket of fruits in the brightest of watercolours. 

 There were some other paintings, too, by these children, in equally eye-catching hues.

 Since the art camp was held for the benefit of these special children, one wished one could see some more of them at the venue itself. 

 Seven of them were there ? perhaps the more presentable and better-behaved ones. 

 This, in a way, defeats the whole purpose of breaking the mental barriers that most of us erect the moment we hear the word ?handicapped?, ?disabled?, or the more fashionable euphemism, ?special?.

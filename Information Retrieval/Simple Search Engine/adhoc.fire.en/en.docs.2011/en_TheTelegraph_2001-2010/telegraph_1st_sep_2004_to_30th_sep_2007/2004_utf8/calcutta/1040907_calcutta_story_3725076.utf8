The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Directly to Kuala Lumpur

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 From December, Malaysia Airlines will operate direct flights between Calcutta and Kuala Lumpur three days a week. The announcement followed a meeting airline officials held with tourism minister Dinesh Dakua on Monday evening. 

 The airline already operates flights from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad. 

 Calcutta is the only metro from where we were not flying. The idea is to bring tourists from all over the world to Calcutta, via Kuala Lumpur, said Henry Moses, sales manager (North India), Malaysian Airlines. The airline will operate Airbus 330s, which accommodate 280 passengers. 

 The inaugural fare, Moses said, will be attractive and competitive with fares of Indian Airlines and Thai Airways on the same route. Malaysia Airlines charges Rs 17,500 on the Delhi-Kuala Lumpur route, inclusive of a three-night and four-day stay at the Malaysian capital.

 We have conducted a survey on the business potential of Bengal and are planning to market destinations like the Sunderbans for foreign tourists, the airline officials said. 

 However, the airline is not happy with the slot provided to it by the Calcutta airport authorities. We wanted night slots between 10 pm and midnight. Ideally, we would want to land at around 10 pm and take off for Kuala Lumpur around midnight. Unfortunately, we have been given morning slots instead, Moses said. 

 However, we are hopeful that the night slot vacated by Royal Brunei will be allotted to us, he added. 

 Moses will meet the airport director on Tuesday morning to seek a slot of the airlines choice. We are ready to operate in 60 days time, he added. 

 The tourism minister assured the Malaysian team of his support. If required, the government will talk to the airport authorities on behalf of the airline and help them out, Dakua said.

 Malaysia Airlines is not the only foreign airline about to start operations in Calcutta. GMG, the private player from Bangladesh, will operate flights between Calcutta and Dhaka from September 8. 

 According to officials, the Malaysian airline had shown interest in Calcutta more than two years ago, and talks were continuing on the issue. 

 The interest foreign airlines are showing now stems from the open skies policy declared by the United Progressive Alliance, officials said. 

 This, coupled with the Centres decision to turn Calcutta airport into a hub for Southeast Asia operations seems to have clinched the deal this time. 

 Jet Airways and Sahara India have both got the nod from the Bangladesh government to start flights to Dhaka.

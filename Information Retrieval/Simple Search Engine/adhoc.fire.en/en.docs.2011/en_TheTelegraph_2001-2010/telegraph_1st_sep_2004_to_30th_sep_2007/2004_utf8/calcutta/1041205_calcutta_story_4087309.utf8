 Fanning fusion flames

 Aditi Govitrikar, Diana Hayden and now, Shyla Lopez? The December night air over the east is being warmed by some of the hottest bods from west and north.

 Saturday saw the former Miss India in town to promote Fusion, the new bar lounge at Golden Park. The pace of the city is something Shyla finds most comfortable. ?I connect to Calcutta very well. It goes down well with my relaxed lifestyle,? reveals Lopez. 

 It is her laid-back approach to her career that explains why she is not running around town to bag roles of running around trees. Proof of her foot-off-the-pedal pace lies in her relocation from Mumbai to Delhi. ?Life in Mumbai is maddening. Half your life is wasted just paying your bills or earning money to pay your bills. That is just not up my street. I want to enjoy the simple pleasures of life,? says the sultry siren.

 What gave Shyla a sense of perspective was a one-year stint with a hospital as public relations manager. ?That was the first time I came in contact with so much pain and misery,? recounts Shyla, adding how she bought a grave for herself with her first salary in Bangalore, her hometown.

 But her tryst with the glamour world ? the Miss India crown in 1992 ? put her on course to stardom.

 Commercials poured in, ramps rolled out the red carpet and then the music videos happened. Rap king Baba Sehgal?s frenetic Traffic jam was followed by the sensuous Baahon mein chale aao and Aaja piya tohe pyar doon. After this, Shyla went into a shell. ?It was intentional. I was losing focus. I headed to Kodaikanal and spent time there in the monasteries. I returned rejuvenated,? she reveals,

 A couple of big screen projects are in the pipeline. At present, she is busy choreographing ramp shows. Before all that, it?s time to enjoy her brief stint in Calcutta.

Global beats

 Someplace Else, the Mecca of live music, played host to a different musical genre last Wednesday, showing off once more that when it comes to tuning into live beats over bottles of beer, Calcutta has more audience than one can ask for.

 The Park Hotel address went the world music way with the Violin Brothers.

 Those who had turned up to tune into their usual mid-week favourite Hip Pocket had to bear with a brief phase of disappointment until brother duo Deb and Jyoti Sankar took the stage and the crowd.

 While Deb played his signature Indian style, Jyoti stuck to the more flamboyant western style of playing the violin. 

 Together they concocted what might well be termed global music, replete with groovy beats of contemporary western compositions as well as the strain of Indian classical music.

 The packed house of regulars actually began to enjoy the ?different but nice music? all of which were original compositions of the musicians. To ring in the feel of global music as also to insert interesting twists in their compositions, the duo used the violin, keyboard, drums, kajun (a Latin American percussion instrument) and the tambourine.

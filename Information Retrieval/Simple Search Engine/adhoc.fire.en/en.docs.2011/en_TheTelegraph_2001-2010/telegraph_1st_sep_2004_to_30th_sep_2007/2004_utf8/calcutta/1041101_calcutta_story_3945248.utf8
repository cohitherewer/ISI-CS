 Varsity job cells on campus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In its first-ever attempt to open more job avenues for students, Calcutta University has decided to set up separate placement centres on each of its campuses across the city.

 At present, the university runs only a single centralised placement cell on its Rajabazar Science College campus that houses most of its science and technology departments. Officials said on Sunday that this was not enough to provide job opportunities for students who have passed out through campus interviews. So, the university has engaged two senior teachers to supervise the task of setting up different branches of the placement cell.

 ?Ours is a vast university with more than 50 departments spread over six big campuses. It is not possible for a single placement cell to maintain regular contact with industries and companies for arranging campus interviews for students in so many fields,? said Chitta Bhattacharya, a senior teacher of the university?s geology department, who has been given the responsibility to set up the placement units at the university?s Ballygunge and Alipore campuses.

 According to sources, students complained that only those studying in the departments housed on the Rajabazar Science College campus are benefited by the present placement cell. The departments housed in Rajabazar include physics, chemistry, applied physics, applied chemistry, chemical engineering, radio physics, electronic engineering, computer science, physiology and psychology.

 ?We notice every year that the university arranges campus interviews with companies that need fresh post-graduates only in those subjects taught at the Rajabazar Science College. This system needs to be changed,? said a student of the university?s geography department, located at the Ballygunge Science College. Apart from geography, the departments which are run at Ballygunge are bio-chemistry, bio-technology, geology, zoology, botany and agriculture. Apart from Ballygunge and Rajabazar, the other campuses are at College Street, Baranagar, Alipore, Hazra Road and Hastings.

 As of now, sources said, only a small number of students who have passed out from the departments located on campuses other than Rajabazar Science College have been able to get jobs through campus interviews. ?But these interviews were mostly organised through the personal initiative of teachers of the respective departments,? the sources added.

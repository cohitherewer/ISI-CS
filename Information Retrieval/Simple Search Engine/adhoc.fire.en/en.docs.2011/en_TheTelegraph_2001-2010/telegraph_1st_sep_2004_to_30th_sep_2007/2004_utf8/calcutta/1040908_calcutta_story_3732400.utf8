Clutter-free corner for kid call

Feng Shui

Pinky Kapoor

 Placing pictures or paintings of children on the 

western wall of a couples bedroom enhances child-bearing luck. Pictures 

of pomegranates also help as their seeds symbolise fertility

Q: We have been married for four years and 

have been planning to have kids for a long time now. Due to physical problems, 

it was not working out, though we have now sorted matters out. What changes should 

we make in our room and direction of bed so we have better luck with kids? My 

date of birth is 03.02.72.

Piya Sen

The Solution: To start with, see that the western 

corner of each room, which is associated with children, is free of clutter. Next, 

position the bed or the pillows so that both of you sleep with your heads pointing 

towards your husbands nien yen direction. His kua number, calculated 

from his year of birth, reveals this. Display pictures or paintings of children 

in metal frames on the western wall of the bedroom. Pictures of pomegranates are 

also beneficial as their seeds symbolise fertility. Putting a music system here 

could stimulate luck. Lastly, place a note of affirmation in a silver box and 

visualise your dream coming true. 

Q: We have lived in our house for many years 

but neither my son nor I prospered since the day we moved in. My son, also suffering 

from health problems, has gone into depression. The house is split into levels. 

The western area where the bedrooms are is lower. I am in the south-west bedroom 

whereas my son is in the north-west. We enter from the east and the living room 

is in the centre, which is at the lowest level.

Sumangal Mehta

The Solution: The house lacks complete support 

if the back has a structural depression. Entering the house and stepping down 

symbolises going downward in life. Climbing steps from inside to leave the home 

indicates enormous personal struggle. The centre, being at the lowest level, does 

not benefit from positive chi flowing from all sides. You should shift 

your son to the north-east room if possible, as the north-west is bad for him. 

Fill the land behind and in the centre. If this is not possible, erect a tall 

wall behind the house and plant tall trees and place tall lights at regular intervals. 

For the time being, you can lift the energy from the centre by installing tall 

pedestal lights and putting potted plants in four corners of the living room. 

Striped wallpaper in the room will also help raise the energy level.

Q: I am a 30-year-old man working for a 

multinational company. Though I am friends with a lot of women in my workplace 

and otherwise, I am not finding the right match for myself. My parents insist 

that I get married soon. I too want to get married. My date of birth is 30.11.74. 

Aditya Bose

The Solution: Your animal sign is Tiger. You 

have a clash with the Monkey this year and so you can expect something significant 

happening. Moreover, you are a wood person, and as metal is in power this year, 

it may lead to a change in your status. So, there are good chances of your getting 

married. Hang pictures of couples in your room. 

Q: My friend brought for me statues of Fuk, 

Luk and Sau from Singapore. The statues are all the same size. I have read somewhere 

that the statue of Luk should be taller than the other two idols. What is their 

significance and where should I place them?

S.Ramakrishnan

The Solution: Fuk, Luk and Sau represent the 

three most important aspects of good luck. The Chinese believe that Fuk blesses 

the residents with wealth and happiness. Luk, holding the sceptre of power and 

authority, represents material comfort. Sau, carrying a peach in one hand and 

a walking stick in the other and accompanied by a deer, represents longevity. 

They are always placed together in the living or the dining room. Fuk, the god 

of fortune and happiness, is taller than the other two and is always placed in 

the centre. You can place a small wooden platform underneath the statue of Fuk 

to give it the required height.

Q: I am planning to have a small office 

in my residence to work out of on weekends but I live in an old house where the 

rooms are very big. I dont want to spend much on the interiors. Please suggest 

some easy options. 

Siddhartha Suri

The Solution: Choose a room close to your entrance 

so the rest of the house is not disrupted. Try placing your self in the south-west 

of the room facing one of your auspicious directions. Ensure that you have a solid 

wall behind you. Place low bookshelves, cabinets or screens in such a way that 

they mark the boundaries and give the feel of an independent room. This will help 

contain the energy within the room and lend privacy. Put fresh plant in the south-east 

of the room to help your business grow.

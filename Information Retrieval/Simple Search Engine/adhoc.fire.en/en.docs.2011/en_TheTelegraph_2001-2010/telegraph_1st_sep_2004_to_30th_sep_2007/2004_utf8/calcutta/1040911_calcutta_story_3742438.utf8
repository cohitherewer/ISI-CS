The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fashion focus 

Global Eye

 Models sport Tommy Hilfiger outfits at the 

Olympus Fashion Week 

Fashion was the flavour of the week around the world, 

from the US to China. While New York is no stranger to the bold or bizarre creations 

dished out by designers every season, Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejing province 

in eastern China, was in for a real treat. 

More than 40 models from 29 countries and regions 

participated in the 2nd Xinsilu New Silk Road World Fashion Model Contest 2004.

But first, back to one of the fashion capitals of 

the world. The Big Apple is playing host to Olympus Fashion Week Spring 2005, 

which encompasses some of the biggest names in the fashion industry, from designers 

to retailers, buyers to customers and fashion fans. Around 80 shows were scheduled 

during the week at Bryant Park, Manhattan.

The designers ranged from Tommy Hilfiger and Kenneth 

Cole to Vera Wang and Tracy Reese, while the ramp attracted Jennifer Jason Leigh, 

Gretchen Mol and Chloe Sevigny. 

The metrosexual man also had plenty to crow about 

with the preppy look being in vogue. But the Olympics designer wear line had some 

of the most eye-catching Greek-Roman styles with a modern touch. Oh, and the launch 

parties featured wilder fashion than the ramp.

Now in this part of the world, The New Silk Road modelling 

contest held in China is one of the biggest of its kind in the country, as the 

fashion industry gains ground. Li Zining from China, Zhanna Havenko from Ukraine 

and Kwon Hyun-ji from South Korea were the winners, declared after the finals 

on September 5.

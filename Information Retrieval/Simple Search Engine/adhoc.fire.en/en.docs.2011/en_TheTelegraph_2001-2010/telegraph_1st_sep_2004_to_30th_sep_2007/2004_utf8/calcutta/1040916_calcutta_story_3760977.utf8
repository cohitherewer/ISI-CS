The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Magic realism in reel dream

 It is more miraculous than any Hindi film ever, says Mahesh Bhatt. It is quite incredible, gushes Dia Mirza. One has to see it to believe it, announces Emraan Hashmi. No, they are not promoting their new film Tumsa Nahin Dekha but describing the spirit of their director Anurag Basu.

 After the huge success of their last film Murder, the core team of Bhatt, Anurag and Emraan, is set to return with Tumsa Nahin Dekha, to release on September 24. Unlike the Mallika Sherawat erotica, this film is ?a charming love story? between millionaire Daksh Mittal (Emraan) and a stripper (Dia).

 ?We could have made another Murder but it is a psychological fallacy to make a safe product,? says Bhatt. ?The consumer always comes up with an apathetic response to a replay of the same thing. An entertainer has to reinvent himself from product to product. Tumsa Nahin Dekha resurrects the dreamy world of my earlier films Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke and Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin. It explores the audacity to dream in a world that is crumbling and dying around you.?

 Like his earlier films Footpath and Murder, Emraan is playing an off-beat character in Tumsa Nahin Dekha ? a spineless spoilt brat, who is forced to choose between the wealth of his father and the love of his life. ?It is not coincidental that I play these slightly grey characters in my films. I would say I play a psycho in all my films. There is a certain level of madness in all my characters. You know what, the audience loves watching a mad person on screen,? laughs Emraan.

 For Dia, Tumsa Nahin Dekha is the first of a kind. The actress who has so far only played goody-goody girl in Bollywood takes her first steps down dare-bare lane. ?I asked Bhatt saab whether I?ll look convincing as a stripper. He told me, if you go and watch these dancers otherwise, you wouldn?t be able to distinguish them from girls from good families. Then I convinced myself that I am playing a character on screen and not Dia Mirza. While it was very uncomfortable to wear such short clothes, I thought that if this film happens to add value to my career, so be it,? Dia revealed to Metro.

 While the shooting schedules of the film were going as planned, a medical bulletin one fine evening left the entire team shell-shocked: Anurag Basu had been diagnosed with leukaemia. ?We were joking amongst ourselves on the sets and the next moment he was fighting for his life. It was heartbreaking,? recalls Emraan. ?The one word to describe Anurag is life,? says Dia. ?And to see him as a patient in a hospital was an absolute shocker.?

 But what followed was the twist in the tale. ?On life-support system he was issuing orders from his hospital bed on his phone. As soon as he was off the respirator he became a cheerleader of sorts, urging us to finish the film. In an industry where people look for the slightest excuse to stall shooting, here was Anurag fighting for his life and still hell bent on meeting the September 24 deadline. Mohit Suri, my nephew, and me completed what was at hand. We were only chiselling his vision, concluding what he traced out,? says Bhatt.

 It also changed the way the star cast looked at the film. Says Dia: ?We did become much more responsible towards the movie. The enthusiasm became far more intense. We had to do it for him.?

 For Bhatt, a title like Tumsa Nahin Dekha best describes Anurag Basu. ?He is the manifestation of courage, professionalism and dedication. It is people like him who would lead India to the 21st Century and not the ones sitting in their air-conditioned rooms and making visionary statements. Anurag is the one aspirational figure I have always fantasised about. Someone like him will give diseases like cancer a cold nose.?

 Last heard, the director coming off a round of chemotherapy was supervising the dubbing and finalising the background score for Tumsa Nahin Dekha till 1.45 am on Wednesday.

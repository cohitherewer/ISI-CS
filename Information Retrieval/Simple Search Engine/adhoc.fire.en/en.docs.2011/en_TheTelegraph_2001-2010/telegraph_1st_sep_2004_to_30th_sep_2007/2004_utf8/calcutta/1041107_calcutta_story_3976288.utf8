 City Lights

 One for all, all for one

 They don?t need props or costumes. 

 Neither an elevated podium for a stage, as the shade of 

 a mehul tree or a university classroom is good enough. 

 The performers could be just about anyone identifying with 

 the issue on hand ? agricultural labourers of Bengal or 

 slum-dwellers of Delhi, criminalised children of Sudan or 

 the tribals of Jharkhand.

 Theatre of the Oppressed, the worldwide movement conceived by Brazilian theatre activist Augusto Boal several years ago, has reached the interiors of India, from Orissa to Maharashtra, Gujarat to Tripura. Yet, it all began from a hamlet in the Sunderbans some two decades ago when Sanjoy Ganguly, desperately looking for a performing art form to address social issues, met Boal by chance in Paris.

 ?We enact a piece on a social problem pertinent to the area, say alcoholism in the Sunderbans, and leave it unresolved. The viewers, all villagers, are then invited to come on stage and act out their version of a probable solution. In this way, the spectators become active agents in solving a crisis, instead of being told what to do by some educated people from the city. This is called Forum theatre,? explains Ganguly, steering Jana Sanskriti, the organisation he had formed along with a few friends in 1986.

 ?Now, the women in the Sunderbans raise their voices through this platform against domestic violence and alcoholism,? he adds. After training with Jana Sanskriti, 25 theatre teams are working in the districts of Bengal, while several others are spread across the country.

 To gather Forum theatre activists near and far under one umbrella, Jana Sanskriti is hosting Muktadhara, the first-ever festival of its kind in India, from November 17 to 21, with performances, seminars and workshops. Alongside teams from Bengal, Tripura, Orissa, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Pakistan, activists and academics from the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Brazil and Nepal will also participate in a string of interactions and workshops. 

 The five-day-long event kicks off at Lalan Mancha, on the Maidan, with a three-piece performance where viewers will be asked to step in midway and resolve the crisis. While two teams from Bengal dwell on oppression at the panchayat and political levels, a woman?s life is the subject of the Delhi troupe comprising slum-dwellers.

 Day Two has a group from Orissa debating the exploitation of a tribal girl and another from Ahmedabad discussing Gujarat, post-Godhra. Untouchability and insurgency are the problems dealt with by troupes from Maharashtra and Tripura, respectively, on Day Three. But the spotlight is firmly on the Pakistani team, highlighting Indo-Pak relations. 

 Gujarat grabs attention once again on Day Four, with fundamentalist forces in focus, while the last day wraps up with a Pakistani team enacting the lives of brick kiln workers. The Maidan bower apart, performances have been lined up at EZCC, St Xavier?s College and Jadavpur University.

 In the first of the interactive sessions that gets underway on Saturday, Simon Malbogat and Luciano Logna from Canada will share their experiences of doing Forum theatre in countries as diverse as America, Brazil, Italy, Turkey and Ukraine, at the EZCC. On Sunday, Jane Plastow and Ali Campbell from the UK take the stage for an audio-visual presentation on a children?s reformatory in Sudan.

 The workshops, in progress at 

 Jana Sanskriti?s training centre near Madhyamgram, are being 

 conducted by Julian Boal, son of Augusto Boal, who practises 

 the form in Paris, Jean Rancois Martel from France and Campbell.

 Fashion, just for fun 

 Friday night saw a ramp romp of a different kind at the Tollygunge Club. The show named Tolly Members Fashion Show boasted city designers like Abhishek Dutta, Monapali, Komal Sood, Shamlu Dudeja, Sayan Mitra, Durzi, Burlingtons and Kyra. Most models sporting their clothes were not professionals but members of the club.

 ?The show is a celebration of the love and bonding between the members of Tollygunge Club over a period of time. It also delves into the past, present and future of the prestigious institution,? said Gitanjali Jolly, who co-ordinated the event with the help of other club members.

 The 14 sequences of the pageant showcased the various facets of Tollygunge Club with more than 100 members between six and 60-plus strutting the stage in style. 

 The first sequence took the audience down memory lane into the time when movies were shown on the Tolly Terrace. The older members illustrated the camaraderie and excitement of getting together on those special evenings.

 Then it was time to showcase the romance on the Tolly greens. Boy meets girl aur pyar ho gaya, and what?s more, in the true sporting tradition of Tolly, mummy-daddy do not play spoilsport and bless the bachhe. It was all dhoom dhadaka from there on with actress June dressing up as the dulhan.

 Post shaadi, it was time to move on. The children?s party, which is a big draw at the club, found kids from three to 11 rocking the ramp. A few even refused to budge from the stage after the act, loving every bit of the limelight.

 ?Training the kids was a delight. It was tough to choreograph them but then their imperfection is sweet in its own way,? said Priyanka Chowdhury, choreographer for the show.

 But it was the arrival of the club?s GenX that finally stole the show. If the guys banked on their bulging biceps, the girls were all elegance in their Friday night best and some.

 The slip side: the dew factor 

 almost played havoc on Tolly?s outdoor stage at the Far 

 Pavilions. As the November night darkened, stage strut became 

 a steep struggle. 

 Three ladies in particular found themselves on a slippery slope. But all?s well that ended well with the sporting crowd cheering every move as Friday night fun was had by all, club class.

 Ramp romp: June hots up 

 November night

 Leading the ladies in all their 

 finery at Tolly was June, equally at ease ruling the ramp 

 and heating up the heavens as apsara Urvashi (in 

 Dhyat Terika on the telly). ?The multi-coloured skirt 

 I wore on Friday is made of crushed silk and sequins, teamed 

 with a satin corset,? said June, looking stunning in the 

 Komal Sood creation.

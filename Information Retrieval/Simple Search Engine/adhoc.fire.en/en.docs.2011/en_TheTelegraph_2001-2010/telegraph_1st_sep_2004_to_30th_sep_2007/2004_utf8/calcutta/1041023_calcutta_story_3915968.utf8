 The City Diary

 Accompanied by NGO Banchbo, 30 streetchildren visited major Puja pandals in the city and judged them. Tarun Sangha, in Dum Dum Park, was declared the best puja, followed by Dakshin Purba Dhakuria Sarbojanin, with Nabapalli (Charu Market) and Babubagan as joint third. US consul-general George N. Sibley and wife Lee Alison flagged off the bus carrying the jury on Saptami morning.

 Around 8,000 people turned up at the Alipore zoo on Friday ? the highest during the Pujas. Zoo director Subir Choudhury said the average turnout during the Pujas is four times the normal footfall around this time of the year. Apart from the zoo?s own guards, police, scouts and guides have been deployed on the premises to keep a close watch on the crowd and prevent any untoward incident. A first-aid camp, too, has been set up. 

 Around 250 government-run primary schools in the city are facing closure because of a lack of adequate number of students over the past five years. The student turnout started dropping ever since the state government decided to abolish English at the primary level. The Bengal Primary Teachers? Association (BPTA) has decided to launch an agitation after the Pujas to protest the government?s decision to close down the schools. BPTA general secretary Kartik Saha said on Friday that demonstrations will be held in front of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education office, in Salt Lake. 

 Fire services department officials toured the city on Friday to check whether Puja organisers were adhering to the mandatory fire prevention norms. The government has already written to at least five errant Puja committees, asking them to follow the norms. The names of the organisers have been forwarded to the police, a fire services official said. 

 esides, the government has lodged separate complaints with police against pandals where fires broke out. The government will compile a report and chalk out its course of action, the official added.

 NCC cadets are working with the traffic police to control crowds and ensure smooth flow of vehicles. They have been placed at every major intersection across the city, joint commissioner of police (traffic) Banibrata Basu said on Friday. The city police, he added, are not imposing spot fines on jaywalkers during the Pujas, ?as it is more important to manage the crowd and vehicles?. He argued that the department doesn?t have enough personnel to collect spot fines during the five days of the Pujas.

 At least 50 employees of the National Library donated blood on Friday. A spokesman for the National Library Staff Association said the camp was organised because the city faces an acute shortage of blood after the Pujas. The camp was held beside the pandal on the library premises.

 When funds are flowing in abundance for most organisers, Lake Town?s Patipukur Sammilani may be forced to stop its 47-year-old puja ?due to lack of funds?. The organisers have put up a notice in front of the pandal, appealing to visitors to donate generously so that the festival could be organised next year, too. 

 A youth was killed in a road accident in Salt Lake on Friday. Police said the unidentified person was run over by an unknown vehicle at Karunamoyee at 1 pm.

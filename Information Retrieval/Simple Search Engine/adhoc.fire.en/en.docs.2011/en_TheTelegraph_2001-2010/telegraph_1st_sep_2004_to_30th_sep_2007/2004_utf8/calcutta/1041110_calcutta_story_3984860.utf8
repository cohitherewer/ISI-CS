 Walkout over bad roads

 - Howrah Congress councillors protest neglect

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Lack of development work and poor road conditions in Howrah prompted Congress councillors of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) on Tuesday to walk out of a meeting with mayor Gopal Mukherjee, and later burn his effigy in front of the premises. Police subsequently arrested 130 Congress supporters.

 Seema Naskar, leader of the opposition in the HMC, later described the mayor as a ?good-for-nothing? and threatened to launch a bigger movement if the civic authorities failed to ensure proper amenities for residents.

 Concerned over the HMC?s failure to repair the ravaged CTI-Balitikuri road despite repeated appeals, local residents on Tuesday submitted a video cassette on the road?s condition to the mayor. The residents threatened to go on a hunger strike and stop paying taxes if the HMC authorities did not take necessary steps to repair and develop the four-and-a-half-km road joining the Balitikuri crossing with the CTI water tank. ?We have urged the HMC to repair the road and improve the civic amenities in the added low-lying area which remains slushy throughout the year,? said Nemai Roy, another resident. 

 Inquiries revealed that 32 years ago, the then panchayat samity had developed the road and plots were allotted to local people to build houses. But since 1984, the area has come under the jurisdiction of the HMC as an added area under ward number 50. 

 ?The ward?s councillor and member, mayor-in-council, Ramlal Chatterjee, has repeatedly asked the HMC to pay attention to road conditions, but his pleas went virtually unheeded,? Manna said. It is learnt that former mayor Subinoy Ghosh took the initiative to develop the road and drainage system, but the scheme was not implemented. ?We wonder how the other roads of the same area could be repaired several times and this particular stretch left out,? he added. 

 HMC officials said a road inspector undertook a survey of the road concerned in July, but no subsequent steps were taken to repair the damaged portions. ?The mayor had promised to take steps to repair the road within two or three days, but nothing has been done even after a month,? said Kali Shankar Pal, who lives there.

 Mukherjee said the new set-up developed some technical problems and the engineer concerned was asked to conduct an inquiry. Mamata Jaiswal, member, mayor-in-council, roads, has been directed to look into the problem and suggest remedial measures.

 Rights plea a washout

 OUR BUREAU

 If the Supreme Court verdict sealed the fate of the 69 NRI-quota students earlier this month, the state human rights commission could not do much for them, either.

 Former Chief Justice Shyamal Sen, who heads the rights panel as chairman, summoned both director of medical education C.R. Maiti and a delegation of NRI-quota students for a hearing.

 However, after going through the case history, the commission concluded that it could not do much, since the case was sub-judice under the apex court of the country.

 The students, who tried to plead their case with Sen, were unable to impress him and returned dejected. 

 The day after the government announced that it was planning a new faculty for the ousted medical students, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee claimed that the government was constantly in touch with the students and their families. 

 Told that the ousted students and their parents had refused to accept his proposal for admission into a new medicine-related faculty, Bhattacharjee said he was hopeful that talks would help break the deadlock. ?We are holding talks with them now,? was all he would say.

 In the Assembly on Tuesday, the Opposition gheraoed the Speaker around 11 am and demanded an explanation from him. 

 Amid much slogan-shouting, all the Opposition MLAs rushed to the Well of the House, demanding that the chief minister immediately clear all doubts about the fate of the students. The chaos continued for half-an-hour.

 The students said they would wait for another day before deciding their next course of action. ?We have heard that the health minister will make a statement on the issue. Let?s see what he says,? said a spokesman, indicating widespread agitation.

 The students of the SSKM institute and Midnapore Medical College and Hospital went on a hunger strike after the apex court on December 13 cancelled the admission of 69 students taken in under the NRI quota. 

 quot;Weve asked the University of Technology, under the higher education department, to explore the possibility of opening a new faculty related to medicine. Theyve told us it can be done. We will accommodate these students there, quot; Bhattacharjee had announced on Monday. 

 However, neither the West Bengal Medical Council nor the students who are supposed to get enrolled, had a clear idea about the nature of the new faculty.

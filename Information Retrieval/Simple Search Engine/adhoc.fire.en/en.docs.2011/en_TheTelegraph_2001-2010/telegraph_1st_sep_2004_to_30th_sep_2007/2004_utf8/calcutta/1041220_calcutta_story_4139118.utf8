The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Busy bee for bossy eyes

All work and no play making you dull? Catch 

Sangita Sultania G. Roy mixing business with pleasure

Remember Bridget (Renee Zellweger) and Daniel (Hugh 

Grant) flirting non-stop on the office messaging system in Bridget Jones?s 

Diary? Well, she never got fired for mixing business with some pleasure, so 

why shouldn?t you play a little at work as well? 

It?s true bees who appear to buzz busiest walk away 

with honey and spice and all things nice, even if you are the fastest worker in 

the hive. The catch is to play smart when you get snatches of leisure at work?

Phoney affair

Tempted to catch a quick chat on the phone between 

assignments? Keep a notepad handy, pull on an absorbed expression and scribble 

away from time to time, nodding vigorously. 

The idea is to appear to be conducting business. And 

if the boss is within earshot, brag loudly about company performance or shower 

praises in his/her favour, pretending to be oblivious of the presence.

And just in case?

 Boss boom: ?Would you like a telephone allowance??

 Smart Alec: ?With the next raise please!? 

Chatterbox

If you?re blessed with 24-hour Internet connection 

on your computer, nothing like it. Brush your communication skills further by 

chatting online when the rest of the gang is too busy to gossip. Keep a dozen 

other sites of your professional interest open, narrow down the chat window and 

they never found a more dedicated researcher in the team. Who knows, you might 

as well be the next R amp; D guy they decide on!

And just in case?

 Boss boom: ?Do we need more Windows??

 Smart Alec: ?Just rooms without a view, sir!?

Surf succour

The golden sands may be miles away but there?s enough 

surfing pleasure on the Internet. A good way to avoid being caught mouse handed 

is to install Windows XP in your computer that groups all the windows. So all 

the boss will be able to see is a site as boring as himself/herself! Most of them 

are technologically challenged, but in case they?ve just come back from a crash 

course in computers, take extra precaution by hiding the menu bar too.

And just in case?

 Boss boom: ?Shall we shut down the office 

library??

 Smart Alec: ?Yeah, paperwork is out!?

Sound of music

Add to your perks by downloading your favourite MP3s. 

Napster may be history but now there is Kazaa, a cool music-sharing engine that 

connects you to other computers. With it, you can download your kind of music 

from any computer in the world! Alternatively, you can look up MP3s in a search 

engine and download directly from the music sites. And this is one trick that 

needn?t interfere with your work ethics either, provided you don?t forget to plug 

on those invisible earphones! 

And just in case?

 Boss boom: ?Even our MPs have some scruples!?

 Smart Alec: ?Please don?t mix MPs with MP3s!?

Rhyme or reason

There?s no better time to try your hand at limericks 

when chaos reigns supreme. Just let you thoughts ramble on the keyboard? abuse 

them if you have a short fuse, or poke fun at that bloke? the experience could 

be cathartic! But if you value your job, don?t make the mistake of saving it in 

your hard disk.

And just in case?

 Boss boom: ?How come you never contribute 

to the house journal??

 Smart Alec: ?It?s best to have more friends 

than foes!?

Think tank

If you thought contemplating over endless cups of 

beverages is the sole preserve of copywriters, change track to give strategising 

a new meaning. Immerse yourself in a heap of charts and diagrams that were the 

stuff of your secondary school geometry class and they?d be impressed enough to 

miss that dazed look as you trek far beyond office space?

And just in case?

 Boss boom: ?It?s not all that necessary to 

migrate to the mountains to meditate, is it??

 Smart Alec: ?It?s best to be down to earth!?

Conference call

Suggest a meeting if you feel like a round of tea 

and snacks at an odd time. Draw up an agenda that can be as vague as the need 

for better video-conferencing technique to woo the aliens! 

The trick is to table your case with as straight a 

face as possible! 

And just in case?

 Boss boom: ?Why don?t you write a novel titled 

Vagueness Vagaries next??

 Smart Alec: ?Will you accept the honour of 

it being dedicated to you, sir??

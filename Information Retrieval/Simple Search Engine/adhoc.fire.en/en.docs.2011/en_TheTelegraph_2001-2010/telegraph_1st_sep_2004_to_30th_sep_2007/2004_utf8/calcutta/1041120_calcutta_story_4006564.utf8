 The season?s splurge: sold if it?s gold

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The lure of the yellow metal has never been stronger. And for once, price is no deterrent. 

 Even as gold prices touched a 16-year high of Rs 6,500 a kg this Dhanteras, Calcuttans bought jewellery worth around Rs 100 crore ? 20 per cent more that last year?s figure. 

 ?Had gold prices not appreciated by 41 per cent in the past three years, the growth would have been at least 25 to 30 per cent,? says Sankar Sen, joint general secretary, Swarna Shilpi Bachao Committee and CEO of Senco Gold Jewellers.

 This year also saw Bengalis turn out in large numbers to buy jewellery on Dhanteras and Diwali. According to Premjit Sengupta, regional manager (east) of Diamond Trading Corporation, jewellery sales this year surpassed expectations by 25 per cent.

 Dhanteras shopping, he says, has become a weeklong affair. ?Since Dhanteras was late this year, it practically ran into the marriage season, with sales continuing even now. Jewellery stores in north and central Calcutta did brisk business till past 9 pm.?

 Bullion dealer Harshad Ajmera feels the steady rise in the prices of gold has made it a viable investment option.

 ?Those who have stopped investing in banks because of low interest rates and consider stock markets a risky proposition, are investing in gold. With an annual return of 14 per cent, the investment stays with you and can be encashed anywhere in the world,? explains Ajmera.

 Indications are that prices will move further up and by the end of this year, as a Mumbai-based dealer says, will touch Rs 6,750 a kg.

 Cashing in on the boom, jewellers have been issuing more guarantees for purity, which includes hallmarked jewellery and buyback certificates. 

 Bengal is the country?s largest jewellery-manufacture hub, drawing 20 per cent of the total 850 tonne annual gold import. Around 150 kg of gold comes to the state every day, half of which goes to create ornaments.

 According to Pankaj Parekh, convener of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, the 75 per cent slash in import duty on gold and the abolition of duty on rock diamond have provided a fillip to the jewellery business.

 ?The move, on the one hand, has helped stop smuggling of gold into the country and, on the other, given a boost to consumption. It has also made diamond jewellery affordable for the middle-class,? Parekh said. The sale of diamond jewellery, one-fourth the total jewellery sale this season, has recorded a 35 per cent growth over last year.

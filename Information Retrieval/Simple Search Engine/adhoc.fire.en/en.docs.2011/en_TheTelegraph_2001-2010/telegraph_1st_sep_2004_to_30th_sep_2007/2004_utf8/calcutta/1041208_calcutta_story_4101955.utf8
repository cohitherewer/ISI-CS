The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Comedy amp; character

 Versatility is something Boman Irani swears by. After his hilarious turn in Rajkumar Hirani?s Munnabhai MBBS, he played a real stern on-screen father in Yash Chopra?s Veer-Zaara.

 ?After all that laughing in Munnabhai, I don?t even smile in Veer-Zaara,? laughs Boman, who played Preity Zinta?s no-nonsense father in the film. 

 ?It doesn?t matter what kind of role one plays. One can make any character look and sound interesting,? he adds.

 More than interesting scripts, it is with credible people that Boman prefers to work. ?A good script means nothing. All film-makers say their scripts are fool-proof. But translating words on paper to cinema screens is something totally different. I try and work with people who can successfully do that translation.?

 For the stage and screen actor, the script has to be ?decent?, but the ?maker matters more?. He has to have some understanding of cinema and be easy to get along with, explains Boman.

 After the signing is over and done with, Boman believes it has to be a collaborative effort. ?Working in a film is like being part of an orchestra. One cannot work in a vacuum. The whole team has to believe in what it is doing.? 

 And for Munnabhai, he feels all the essentials came together. ?We managed to find that balance between great art, great craft, great passion and great heart.?

 Also very close to Boman?s heart is Let?s Talk, India?s first digital film, which had him in the male lead. 

 ?The film opened up a lot of doors. After its release, a brigade of young film-makers figured out that they could realise their dreams and everyone wanted to jump onto the bandwagon,? he says.

 A look at Boman?s forthcoming releases will tell you that the man is in demand and that, too, in a variety of avatars. 

 ?I play a villainous guy in Khosla Ka Ghosla. Then, I am a police detective in the Ram Gopal Varma production Galti Se. Also, there are two comic roles, one in Vipul Shah?s Waqt and the the other in Boney Kapoor?s No Entry. Isn?t that a lovely mix?? asks the photographer-turned-actor.

 And Munnabhai?s Dr Astana is also doing another film ? Dev Anand?s political satire Mr Prime Minister. 

 ?That man has some energy levels. The experience of working with Devsaab has been absolutely and unforgettably joyous. The reason I agreed to do the film was for the man ? Dev Anand. He has been in the business for a good 55 years. That?s quite some time,? Boman signs off.

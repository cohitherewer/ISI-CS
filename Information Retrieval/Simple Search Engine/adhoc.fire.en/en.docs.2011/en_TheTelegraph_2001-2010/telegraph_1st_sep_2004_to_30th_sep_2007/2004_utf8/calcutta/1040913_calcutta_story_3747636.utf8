 Beauty buzz for Behala belles

Few women can stay away from lending an ear when the topic is beauty tips. And a constant pitter-patter was just not good enough reason to hold the residents of Behala back home. The Good Life Talk Show on beauty tips, organised at the Arcadia Community Centre near Ashoka cinema, had pulled in more than 150 people on a rain-washed Saturday evening.

 To share her beauty regimen with the audience was Aparajita Auddy, TV actress and anchor of the popular game show Taka Na Sona on Tara Bangla.

 Rita Bhimani kicked off the good grooming chat, inviting the audiences to discuss their beauty problems with the actress who might help them find a solution. The first query came from Mira Bose who wanted a remedy for the dark circles under the eyes of her 17-year-old daughter. Drink lots of water, sleep adequately, cut down on oily food, eat fruits and also consult a doctor, suggested Aparajita.

 Sunburn, rashes and freckles turned out to be a common problem dogging working women and college-goers. Sangita Pal was worried about the freckles that surface on her face once she steps out in the sun. ?Use an oil-free sun-protection lotion 15 minutes before leaving home. And please don?t forget to use an umbrella and sunglasses, too,? advised the actress.

 For Rama Gar, who was bothered by blackheads, Aparajita recommended a home-made pack of rosewater and fuller?s earth. This apart, dabbing the face with the juice of cucumber and coconut water daily would also help minimise the problem, she assured. ?But everything will come to nought if you don?t remove your makeup or the sun-screen lotion after returning home. Washing the face 20 or 30 times a day and cleansing it properly are the basics of skin care,? was the word of caution.

 Debasree Sen Roy?s peeve was blemishes caused by waxing. The expert suggested that she rub the waxed areas with ice and use an ointment, if needed, after consulting a doctor.

 Ratna Mukherjee voiced a common concern: cracked feet. ?That?s a problem you need to address immediately, before winter sets in. Add a few drops of coconut oil to some warm water and soak your feet in it for 10 minutes. Then, apply glycerine on the affected areas,? said Aparajita. ?But you must make it a point to wear socks in winter.?

 Next, a question for Rita Bhimani. ?What is the secret of your glossy hair and slim shape?? asked an audience member. ?I use a good shampoo and a conditioner. As far as food is concerned, I eat everything but avoid a second helping. And I swim everyday,? revealed the anchor. ?Physical exercise is very important if we want to stay fit. So, try and go for a morning walk, or practice yoga at home,? she added.

 ?How can one do pedicure and manicure at home?? cried a young voice. The expert tip: mix a little shampoo in warm water and soak your hands and feet in it for around five minutes. Then clean your nails with a soft brush.

 Sanchita Mukherjee has been troubled with dry and falling hair ever since she dyed her tresses brown. Oil massage at least three times a week without delay was advised. ?If shampoos don?t suit your hair, soak reetha overnight in water, extract the juice and use it as a shampoo. It will bring back the lustre to your hair.?

 Sikha Sengupta wanted to know what the busy actress nibbles before rushing out for work. ?I eat on my way to work, but I stick to a heavy breakfast. My platter comprises three rotis, some vegetables, an egg, some chhana and papaya,? smiled Aparajita. ?I eat a lot because I don?t believe in staying slim by going without food. And I work out before going to sleep at night.?

 It was time to wrap up as the clock had touched 10, but the listeners were in no mood to let go their expert. So, another round of queries followed during the photo session with both Aparajita and Rita tossing up some more solutions. ?Well, whatever you do, don?t forget that a healthy diet is more effective than putting all the food ingredients on your face,? summed up the actress, before leaving the audience content with tips from tip to toe.

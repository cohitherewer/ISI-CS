The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wrap up in wool style 

Himika Chaudhuri

 Designers who specialise in men?s or women?s wear are as common as the seasons of the year, but designers who specialise only in winter wear ? and that, too, Pashmina ? are few. One of them is Smriti Lohia who, with her label Naturally Classic, has been experimenting with the silk-and-wool weave for the past five years. Having exported to design houses abroad, she has now given Calcutta its first Pashmina-only outlet.

The Rawdon Street address (at Hallmark building, opposite 

Kookie Jar) that opened its doors earlier this week will deal in the best of this 

classic weave (as seen in picture by Rashbehari Das) that has warmed up 

beautiful bodies and jazzed up royal wardrobes.

 ?We began with plain Pashminas in bold colours but soon moved into jacquard designs (geometric patterns woven on the material), a big hit with clients simply because of the rich look they give the piece,? said Smriti, who gets most of her work done by artisans in Nepal.

 But the ring Pashmina forms the real high point of the collection. ?Made from the finest wools and silks, this is so soft that it can be passed through a finger ring,? claimed Smirti.

 These, along with Cashmere (woollen Pashmina), do best in the international market. ?Both the jacquard designs and the ring Pashminas have been created keeping in mind international palettes, since we cater to the market abroad,? explained Smriti.

 So, from electric pinks and blues to golden yellow and soft green, the Pashmina here comes in the most vibrant of colours. Yet, there are also the traditional blacks and maroons on the racks that the Indian consumer loves to don.

 In keeping with the demand of the Indian body size, larger shawls have been created in the women?s section. Scarves, blankets and wraps form the bulk of other items available. For the fashion conscious, leather and Pashmina bags coupled with shawls and stoles jazz up the line on offer.

Even if your idea of a night on the town isn?t a plunge in the pool, this is one space that entices all those looking for a mellow evening where you can hear yourself think and others speak.

 The latest chill-out zone in the city has opened up at The Park spa, called H2O. This is superb use of existing space. The poolside, with the blue glow from the water and gently flickering candles, has come enthrallingly alive.

 ?The name is spontaneous and catchy and fits in with our aim of wanting people to enter the place and first say, ?wow, look at the pool?,? says manager Siraj Mukherjee.

 Open on weekdays from 11 am to 9 pm and on Fridays and Saturdays indefinitely, depending on the crowd response, the city?s first open-air night destination focuses on the three Ms: media, models and movie personalities. ?The concept has been developed along the lines of the European ?bed?s bar?, where there is no dance floor and lots of space to lounge around in the midst of soothing music,? adds Mukherjee.

 Spacious white divans, comfy cushions and sun-beds (it is a pool after all) lend an air of serenity. The seating is spread out, and you can stretch your legs and lie down if you wish. An abundance of candles, reflecting off the moonlit water is a magical touch.

 This seems to be the perfect oasis for those tired of partying, loud noise and loud music. ?People should feel free to kick off their shoes here. Post-midnight, many want to shift out of nightclubs and hang out with their gangs in a quiet space.?

 For more adventurous water-babies, there are swimsuits on hire so you can actually have a cool dip and clear your spinning head.

 The music, churned out by DJ Andy from Tantra, is equally exotic. Lounge music in the form of Buddha Bar, Karunesh and psychedelic lounge are the predominant notes. There are no hip-hop, trance or Hindi numbers here, just plain soothing tunes.

 The drinks, too, are not the usual brews. Exclusive cocktails and pop picks like Cranberry Mojito, Peach Daiquiri and Cosmopolitan are found here. Food is restricted to snacks, with a select assortment of kebabs and health food.

 With such exclusivity, a crowd control and screening mechanism is also in place. There is an entry fee of Rs 250 per person, but it is a cover charge, and can be recovered against purchases inside.

 Multi mix

 Orbit, the multi-cuisine restaurant at Senator, the four-star hospitality address promoted by P.C. Chandra Jewellers was re-launched on Saturday evening, to tell the city that the 74-seater eatery is ready to take on external diners as well as in-house guests.

 ?Despite high occupancy, our proximity to Park Street has curbed the number of walk-ins,? says Prodip Dutta, CEO, P.C. Chandra hotels. The Camac Street address is serving up an array of Indian, Continental and Chinese food as its core area.

 The simple yet cosy ambience, with colour-changing star-like sparkles sprinkled across windows, is a nice family place. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are being dished out. As of now, breakfast and lunch are on the buffet, while dinner is a-la-cart.

 The kitchens are being managed by consultant executive chef Samir Bose and chef Tanmoy Dutta. Together, they are rustling up lip-smacking delicacies including dishes like Hunan Chicken and Red Island Prawns in the Chinese section, the delicious kebab platter in the Indian section and Bekti Waleska and Lasagne Verde for fans of Continental food.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The Calcutta Police must take steps to save commuters from harassment by cabbies. 

Most taxi meters, both the electronic and the ordinary ones, seem to overshoot 

the average fare for any destination in the city. Those who travel in taxis on 

a regular basis on the same route are the ones who realise the seriousness of 

the problem. When confronted, many drivers offer silly excuses and hollow assurances. 

Then, there are others who openly challenge the passenger saying, Come with me 

to the motor vehicles department office and I will prove that my meter is correct. 

This not only leaves the commuter confused, but also gives him an impression that 

the department officials might be hand in glove with these drivers. Meter-tampering 

complaints must be followed up by the police and the offenders brought to book. 

Random checks of taxi meters will serve as a warning for errant cabbies.

 The space between rows of seats in most private buses, including mini buses, 

is too narrow. Passengers, even those of average built, find it difficult to comfortably 

rest their legs below the seats.

 Parts of BB Ganguly Street, Lenin Sarani, College Street, APC Road, stretches 

of Amherst Street, and certain areas in Moulali have become difficult to negotiate 

in the monsoon. Sometimes the streetlights do not work, adding to the pedestrians 

woes. Often, live electric wires hang loose. With streets and building entrances 

flooded, the live wires can electrocute any person who comes in contact with the 

water. A few such mishaps have occurred in the past. Since the Corporation seems 

to have given up on attempts to solve the waterlogging problem, it is now up to 

the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation to pre-empt such accidents.

 Strange are the ways of functioning of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. 

On July 26, while going to pay tax at the designated counter at the head office 

at SN Banerjee Road, I had a taste of how the staff work. The counters are supposed 

to stay open from 11 am to 3 pm. After waiting in queue till 11.30 am, we learnt 

that the particular counter had stopped accepting tax bills. The main counter, 

we were told, was open for the same. Surprisingly, no notice had been displayed 

to inform the public about the change in procedure. How many more people faced 

the inconvenience is anybodys guess. How is the regular tax depositor supposed 

to know of such changes?

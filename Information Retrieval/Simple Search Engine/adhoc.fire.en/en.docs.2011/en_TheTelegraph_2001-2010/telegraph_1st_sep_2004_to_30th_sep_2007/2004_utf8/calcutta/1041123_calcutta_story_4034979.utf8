Den of cheer

Ipsita Deb whips up a heady mix of the right 

attitude and accessories required to set up a bar at home

Finding the right woman took oodles of charm followed 

by plenty of determination. After weeks of wooing and drinking glasses of the 

finest wine at restaurants well beyond your budget, it?s finally time to bring 

her home for a drink within the comforts of familiar territory.

Nothing spells success like a well-stocked bar. And 

the finest brews in the world deserve ambience to do them justice. Remember, it 

won?t impress her much if you serve your most prized vintage in a coffee mug.

So, make sure you leave her shaken and stirred with 

the right glasses and accessories. Here are some basics of setting up a bar at 

home.

Drink decor 

Start off with the practicalities of light fixtures, 

under-bar storage cabinets, a sink and a freezer. Then proceed to decorate the 

back bar for an attractive display of bottles. 

Entrepreneur Rony Ray, who has an exquisitely decorated 

bar at his Alipore residence (pictures by Pabitra Das), has put many hours 

into his pride and joy. ?The walls of my bar are made of broken floor tiles. There 

are solid wood pillars and just enough bar stools to provide the not-too-cluttered 

feel.?

After you?ve got the bar standing in its designated 

place, personalise it with whatever you wish to display. Ray has decorated his 

bar with collectibles from all over the world. Some mugs, lighters, a hog from 

a pub called Hog in the Pound, London, an old brass phone, a small standing fan 

from an auction house, a gun and a mirror from the Spanish Riviera, a travel iron 

from the 1920s in its original tin box, Commemoration plates of Queen Elizabeth 

and the Duke of Edinburgh, numerous odds and ends from a junk shop in Grasmere...

?My bar is on the lines of an English pub, and no 

English pub can be complete without something of The Beatles and British royalty,? 

says Ray. While the Beatles smile on the top rack, a cosy cricketer?s corner, 

with specially autographed bats by British and Indian cricketers, sits on a little 

table away from the bar. 

Coasters collected globally adorn a part of the wooden 

structure, a specially ordered dartboard from The Pub with No Beer in Covent Garden 

is placed against a granite slab. Paintings add style to the walls, while books 

on wine and cocktails sit quietly on table tops.

Music is an essential feature in a bar room. Ray has 

his own home theatre, on which he rolls out tracks from the 60s, 70s and early 

80s. 

Spirit stock 

Then, it is on to the essential element. According 

to Ray, a must-have bar list should include whisky, vodka, beer, brandy, rum (black 

and white), gin, tequila, sherry and a few varieties of wine including Champagne. 

A few basic liqueurs like Campari, Cointreau, Drambuie, Tia Maria, Kahlua, Bailey?s 

Irish Cream and Creme De Menthe are also necessary. 

?You have to allow your bar to grow with time,? says 

Ray. He has a formidable collection of 60 different varieties of malt whisky and 

vodka and 32 varieties of premium-blended scotch. One of the most interesting 

items here is a bottle of Chinese wine with a real cobra in it, preserved with 

ginseng roots and herb.

Creating a personalised liquor menu could be a fun 

idea too. 

Mix mantra

If you are an amateur mixologist, along with the basic 

liquors you would need mixers like tonic water, juices, soda and bitters, a potent 

ingredient that sets off the flavour of many cocktails.

Garnishes such as cherries, lime and olives might 

add class points. 

ways make sure the ice cubes in your freezer have 

not picked up flavours from stored food.

Glitzy glasses 

Most glasses used for cocktails have distinctive shapes 

for different reasons. Some essential ones for your glassware collection are the 

cocktail/Martini glass, highball glass, Collins glass, shot glass, Pilsner glass, 

beer mug, Champagne flute, Irish coffee glass, wine glass, Margarita glass and 

the liqueur glass.

These are not at all hard to find at superstores and 

specialised crockery shops.

Tool talk

A well-stocked bar won?t help much if you don?t have 

the supporting tools. The must-haves are a bar spoon, cocktail shaker, cutting 

board, juicer, strainer, ice bucket, ice crusher, ice tongs, jugger, knife, measuring 

spoon, pour spout and corkscrew.

Tip top

Having a bar at home is a passion which you must nurture. 

And the least you can do is keep the place clean. 

?Just as I enjoy having my evening drink, I also like 

cleaning the bar. It?s my passion and I don?t allow anyone else to touch anything, 

knowing people are bound to say that they accidentally broke something or the 

other,? shrugs Ray.

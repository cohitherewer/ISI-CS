 Son suicide after murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Thirty-year-old Apurva Dewan committed suicide after killing his ailing mother Ranu (55) in their Tangra home on Wednesday morning. The investigators found Ranu?s body bore no external injury marks but Apurva?s throat was slit.

 A suicide note left by Apurva was found in the room. It said Ranu had been suffering from several diseases for 15 years and he was finding the condition unbearable.

 During post-mortem, traces of insecticide were found in the stomachs of both mother and son. ?It seems Apurva first poisoned his mother and himself and then slit his throat to make sure he did not survive,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Residents of Topsia Road grew suspicious when they found the main door of the Dewan home closed till 8 am. They sent for the local police.

 A team of officers reached the spot. Repeated knocks on the door elicited no response. ?So, we decided to break it open,? said a member of the team. ?We entered the house to find the two bodies,? he added. 

 Ranu?s body was on a bed, and looked like she was asleep. Apurva?s was on the floor, in a pool of blood, with the kitchen knife beside it. ?What kind of food Apurva used to poison his mother can only be ascertained after the reports from forensic department reaches us,? said an officer on the case.

 Preliminary investigation revealed that the incident took place while Ranu was alone at home. Her husband and younger son left home early in the morning. ?She had been suffering for more than a decade. The family had to spend a good deal of money every month for her treatment. It seems they found it difficult to bear the expenses any longer. That may be one of causes behind the incident,? explained the officer.

 Preliminary investigations on Wednesday revealed that Ranu had her own savings in a bank. ?But she refused to withdraw money from her account and insisted that her son or husband bear the cost of her treatment,? said the officer.

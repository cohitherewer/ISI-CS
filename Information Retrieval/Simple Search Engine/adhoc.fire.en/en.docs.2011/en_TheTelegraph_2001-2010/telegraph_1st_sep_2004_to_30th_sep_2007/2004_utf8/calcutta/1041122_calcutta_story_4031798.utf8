 Two years of loyal service, all the while having to put up with the harsh words and blows of her employers. A blind right eye is all that nine-year-old Surita Kumari Singh, alias Guria, got in return. 

 ?Guria went blind in her right eye due to a traumatic cataract, caused by an injury. She was operated upon on Wednesday. We replaced the damaged lens with an artificial lens,? said Dr Somnath Chakrovarty of City Medical Centre. ?She can see now, and will be discharged on Wednesday.?

 Guria?s mother, Munni Devi Singh, had rushed to the city after hearing of her daughter?s suffering. She wanted to take Guria back home, but Sister Cyril, principal of Loreto Day School, Sealdah, had a better idea. That of keeping the child at the Sealdah school till she recovers and starts wearing spectacles. After her rehabilitation, she will be admitted to a Loreto school in the Drondia area of Ranchi. Convinced that her daughter is in safe hands, Guria?s mother has returned home. 

 On October 3, residents of AF-228, Rabindra Palli, in Kestopur, under Rajarhat police station, led by Sruti Ghosh, a student of Loreto Day School, Sealdah, had rescued Guria from the clutches of her cruel employers. 

 Santanu Banerjee, a World Health Organisation officer, and his wife Piu, a teacher, would regularly torture the child, whom they had brought from her Ranchi home a couple of years ago to tend to their only son, Sanju. The couple used to regularly beat up and torture Guria.

 About four months ago, Piu had hit Guria in a fit of rage. The rings on her fingers had caused the injury that led to the surgery. ?She was already myopic, with minus power in both eyes, and had never worn spectacles. Her left eye had more power, and hence, the right eye was the functional one. After the injury, she was practically blind,? Chakrovarty said.

 Christine DRozario Gupta, project coordinator of a home for destitute girls at Loreto Day School, Sealdah, where Guria was provided shelter, was aghast at the brutality with which the Banerjees used to treat the girl. 

 ?With barely any vision, Guria performed her chores regularly. Even then, she was beaten up. They even struck her on the head with a knife once,? D?Rozario Gupta said.

 ?The injury had led to opacity of the lens, a condition that causes blindness. The only way to protect the child?s vision was to go for surgery and implant an artificial lens,? Chakrovarty said. ?The procedure was cataract surgery, costing Rs 12,000. Sister Cyril paid the amount,? he added. 

 Santanu Banerjee was arrested on October 4 for torturing Guria. He was produced in Barasat court, where he was granted bail.

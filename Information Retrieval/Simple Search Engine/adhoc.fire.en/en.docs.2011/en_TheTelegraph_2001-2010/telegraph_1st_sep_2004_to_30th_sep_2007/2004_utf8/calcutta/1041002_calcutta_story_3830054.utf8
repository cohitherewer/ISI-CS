 A PIL can put pandals in place in 2005

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 You the people can help the court put an end to the road raj of puja pandals from the next festive season.

 This was the message from Calcutta High Court to a petitioner on Friday. While dismissing the ?individual problem? of a resident of Dover Lane complaining against the Singhi Park Sarbojanin Durga Puja, acting Chief Justice A.N. Roy said pandals encroaching on city streets was ?a problem faced by thousands?.

 So, a public interest litigation (PIL) could allow the court to intervene and set things right before Durga puja 2005.

 ?We want that there should be a guideline on the erection of pandals for different festivals. A PIL should be moved before us after the ensuing festive days, so that we can intervene in the matter,? said acting Chief Justice Roy, presiding over the division bench.

 ?You (Tapan Kumar Mitra) have come to court with your individual problem. But the pandals on the city roads are the problem of thousands of people. So, we are not entertaining your petition. But considering the sentiment of the general public, we must advise you to come to us with a PIL in this regard. We will chalk out a guideline to minimise the problems of many Calcuttans from next year,? he said.

 Mitra had alleged that the organisers of the Singhi Park puja were erecting a pandal rendering Dover Lane and Ramani Chatterjee Road, off Gariahat, off-limits. This was inconveniencing all residents of the area, he alleged.

 After hearing the petition, the bench observed: ?If we pass a general order at this moment, a good number of puja committees will be in trouble, as there are just a few days left for the festival.?

 The judges, however, wanted to know what the Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s (CMC?s) stand on the matter was. CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh, who was present in court, said: ?We have our own guidelines for erection of pandals on city roads. But, generally, we allow the puja committees to erect pandals on the roads if the police and fire brigade give their approval.?

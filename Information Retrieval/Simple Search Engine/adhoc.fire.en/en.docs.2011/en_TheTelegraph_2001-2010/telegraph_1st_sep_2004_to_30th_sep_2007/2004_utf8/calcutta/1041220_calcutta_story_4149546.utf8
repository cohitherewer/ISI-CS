Police on Sunday shut down scores of online lottery outlets operated by Playwin retailers in and outside Calcutta, charging their operators with violation of the Act governing the lottery business.

 ?We found that most of the agents and distributors connected with the outlets are violating the rules and conditions mentioned in the West Bengal Lottery Regulation Act, 1998. We had no other option but to take away the equipment and close down the outlets,? said Gautam Mohan Chakraborty, additional commissioner of police (III). A large number of electronic devices were seized from the outlets.

 Sunday?s police action came against the backdrop of several suicides, rising tension in neighbourhoods and growing pressure on the administration to control the lottery trade. According to popular perception, online lotteries sought to make electronic gambling look respectable and led to the ruin of several families across Bengal.

 Providing a basis for the police action was a prod from the state finance department, which assessed the complaints that poured into its offices regarding the adverse impact of the electronic lottery on families. 

 ?Our findings show that this new form of business impacts families? Popular opinion is against it,? said a finance department official. 

 He, however, admitted that the business was recognised by the government and the outlets functioned after paying the requisite taxes.

 Protesting the police action, Playwin stated that all its games, marketed on its behalf by agents in Sikkim, Meghalaya and Nagaland, Karnataka, Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra, are transparent, driven by high-end technologies and operated within the legal framework.

 ?A certain percentage of monies goes to various states for use in social development? During fiscal 2003-04, Playwin alone deposited more than Rs 8 crore as sales tax to the Bengal government,? said the statement.

 In the current year, Playwin said it has already generated over Rs 9.5 crore. ?The business carried out by retailers is legal, as held by orders issued by Calcutta High Court two years ago,? Playwin added.

 ?There is misinformation being spread in Bengal questioning our social concerns,? the statement signed off.

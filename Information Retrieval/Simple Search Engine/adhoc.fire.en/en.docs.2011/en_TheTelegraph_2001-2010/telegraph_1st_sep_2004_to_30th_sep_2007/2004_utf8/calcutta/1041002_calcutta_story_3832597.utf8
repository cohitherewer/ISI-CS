The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Sting New ideas will bring in luck. The 

ability to make a good decision even under pressure makes you a born leader. You 

are very loyal to friends. You will dabble in philosophy, religion and spirituality. 

Books will occupy your leisure. Guard against absent-mindedness. ? Kusum Bhandari

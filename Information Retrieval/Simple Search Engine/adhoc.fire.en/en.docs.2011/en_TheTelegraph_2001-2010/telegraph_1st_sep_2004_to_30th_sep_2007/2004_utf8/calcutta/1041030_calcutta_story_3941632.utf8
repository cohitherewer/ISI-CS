The first leg of festivities are finally over with 

Durga puja gone by, but the best is yet to come for a large part of Calcutta?s 

population. With Karwa Chawth on Sunday and Diwali in a couple of weeks, there 

is still much dressing up to do.

If you are already bored with your Puja makeover, 

here are some suggestions for a brand new one. The regime of hair colouring, straightening 

and cutting has started again. With a multitude of colours and cuts to try out, 

here is one combination that might be the winner for you.

Undoing

The model has naturally curly hair and also a coat 

of previous hair colour. So the first step is actually to undo the existing colour, 

to make the hair free to accept the new colours that go with the look.

The last time Babla coloured her hair was almost three 

months ago, so it is perfectly safe to try another shade. But to maximise the 

effect of the new colour, the hair must be treated, technically known as pre-lightening.

?We use a product called Effasor that helps remove 

the previous colour build,? explains Sabina Yah. The shades are ?Oreal?s colours 

of the season ? golden highlights with a mahogany base. ?There is no specific 

time that Effasor has to be kept on the hair. You have to keep checking if the 

strands have turned pale yellow,? adds Sabina. Once the hair turns this hay-like 

tone, it means the de-colouring is complete. The next step is to rinse out the 

hair thoroughly. Now it is ready for the new hues.

Colour code

The two dyes ? Light Blonde Golden Reflect for the 

highlights and Mahogany Ash Reflect for the base ? are the international autumn-winter 

collection colours.

?Gold and mahogany look good on the Indian complexion,? 

suggests Sabina. ?Just one colour is monotonous and is best avoided. A combination 

of two to three colours is ideal for a lively look.?

At the end of the two-hour session, Babla?s tresses 

have been transformed into a mass of brown and gold ? just right for her wheatish 

complexion.

Straight drive

Like Babla, most Indian women have naturally wavy 

hair. So for the more sculpted look that Babla wanted, straightening is usually 

required. Alternatively, you could leave some of the natural waves intact for 

that casual, unkempt look. ?One can just straighten the sides and keep the rest 

of the hair wavy,? recommends Sabina. Internationally, both straight and wavy 

are in this season, she stresses. 

Cool cut

The snipping gives Babla a sweet yet chic look. The 

mid-length hair with rounded sides and loose curls lends softness and elegance. 

Care is taken to give the carefree look and allow a subtle interplay of colours. 

The bold styling contrasts highlights on top with gently structured volume.

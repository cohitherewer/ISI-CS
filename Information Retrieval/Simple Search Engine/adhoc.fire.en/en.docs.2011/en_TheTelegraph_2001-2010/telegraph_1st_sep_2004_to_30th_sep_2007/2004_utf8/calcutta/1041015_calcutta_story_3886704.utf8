Chit Ch@t

Those brought up on a diet of Superman and Batman 

might find this comic book somewhat bizarre. But the graphic novel finds Alan 

Moore perhaps at his best (not counting From Hell that is). The story is 

set in 1898 with characters and events from Victorian era adventure literature. 

The British government decides to form a league to protect the country. Mina Murray 

from Bram Stoker?s Dracula is told to assemble the strange group comprising 

Captain Nemo (Jules Verne?s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), Allan Quatermain 

(the hero of H. Rider Haggard?s King Solomon?s Mines), Henry Jekyll/Edward 

Hyde from Robert Louis Stevenson?s novel and Hawley Griffin (H.G. Wells? Invisible 

Man). Other characters from literary works of the period flood the book. Mina?s 

inclusion makes you wonder how it?s a league of gentlemen, but that?s typical 

Moore-ian humour. Illustrations by Kevin ONeill are stunning. The film version, 

with Naseeruddin Shah as Nemo, may have been a flop, but the book is a hit.

Hannah Dakota Fanning was born in Conyers, Georgia, 

on February 23, 1994. The family moved to LA so Dakota and sister Mary Elle (born 

on April 9, 1998), could pursue careers in Hollywood. Dakota began at age five. 

A year later, she was starring opposite Sean Penn in I Am Sam. By the time 

she was eight, the youngster with TV appearances in high-profile shows like Ally 

McBeal, ER and Spin City was the youngest person to be nominated 

for the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Four awards and widespread acclaim later, 

Dakota is still going strong, with roles in Steven Spielberg?s mini-series Taken, 

 and the 2003 Dr Seuss: The Cat in the Hat. Her recent accomplishments 

include working with Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken in Man on Fire.

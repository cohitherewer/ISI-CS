Barnyard romp: save it for a sunny day

Plan a Party

Set your sights on a barn party to chase 

away those morose monsoon blues, says 

Sangita S. Guha Roy

 Do

 Get some hay to give your home the stable 

feel

 Get a barbecue going

Dont

 Get a real farm full of animals. Try some 

fake ones instead (and have some fun too, like in the Reuters picture, top)

It?s time to take the adage of making hay while the 

sun shines to heart. With the rain coming down like it is going out of style, 

dream, hope and plan for a sunny day. Talk of the great outdoors doesn?t have 

to lead you to the usual picnic on a mat. Do it in country style with a barn party 

to remember.

Theme thump

If you were planning to let all the cows, goats, hens 

and ducks loose, think friends and family instead. Though the gang from Chicken 

Run, where the restless poultry was on the verge of revolution (featuring 

Mel Gibson?s voice as an unhappy chicken, Reuters picture below right), 

would be most displeased, it?s a good idea to let the livestock stay where they 

are. Instead, take arm-loads of straw to redo your home. Harass the dairyman for 

a heap of hay. Clear out the furniture clutter from your home and throw a couple 

of colourful rugs and cushions around, and lo, you can put the most discerning 

buffalo to shame! Khadi curtains and jute throws would do well to cover 

any white patches, and can add a cosy touch, advises event manager Sanchita Kushary 

Bose of The Dream Merchants. 

Cover your tubes and bulbs with paper lanterns and 

crazy cut-outs. Roll in a wheelbarrow for authenticity and invite house pets over 

if you don?t feel at home with the usual farm inmates. Gypsy skirts and dungarees 

are the dress code advised by Sanchita, but anything can go as long as it is cool 

and casual. A couple of cowboy hats and dummy pistols (here?s hoping you don?t 

have the real thing) would bring up a rockin? rear. A farmhouse or a riverfront 

would be the best bet for all the galloping, but then if wishes were horses, you?d 

never come back to civilisation again!

Barn bites

Being true to the cause is one thing and chewing cud 

quite another. The sophisticated animal in you would deal better with the following 

options we?ve lined up.

Let the do-it-yourself spirit burn bright at live 

counters in case you?ve been able to manage a green patch under the blue canopy. 

Roasts, stir-fries, fresh rice or noodle toss-ups with a choice of sauces, or 

even some good old porridge, khichdi, rolls and wraps in case you are stuck 

indoors, should keep all the two-legged hogs (not the four-hoofed variety) happy.

To keep the fun alive, opt for recipes that take less 

preparation but more cooking time advises restaurateur Navin Pai. ?The idea is 

to make the process interactive. Sitting around the fire and catching up on good 

old gossip is the best way to enjoy some country fun,? he says. Exotic veggies 

like snow peas, broccoli, zucchini and bell peppers in a variety of colours and 

the like are ideal choices for a stir fry. For fun food, get corn-on-the-cob to 

much on (AFP picture left).

But to get to the meat of the matter you might consider 

a stock of masala sausages, smoked ham, bacon and chicken salami. There?s nothing 

as festive as a duck or chicken roast. ?Easy marination with fresh lime, pepper, 

ginger and garlic paste, red and green chillies does the trick and then you can 

spend lazy hours roasting your catch,? suggests Navin. 

He?s got an apt recipe for dessert as well. All you 

need to do is dip your favourite fruits in a mix of vodka and sugar syrup for 

10 to 15 days prior to the party and store in a cool, dry place. Served with or 

without freshly whipped cream, each piece will kick you like a couple of tequila 

shots! If you are game for more, keep punches handy. But to pamper the devil in 

you, there?s nothing like tequila shots or maybe some flamb? cocktails. Experimenting 

is the key to keep off the beaten track, provided you are willing to take the 

good, bad and ugly effects in the right spirit, and the clean-up in your stride.

Music mix

The remix brigade should consider giving this party 

a miss. The chill factor at a barn party warrants some mellow country music moving 

on to more energetic folk rock sound before culminating with the infectious R amp;B 

and hip-hop. Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash can rub shoulders 

with Eagles, Rolling Stones, Neil Diamond and Grateful Dead. If you?ve practised 

those seductive moves to perfection, feel free to carry Nelly, Usher and Craig 

David.

There?s nothing like roping in a live band to turn 

up the tempo at a do that thrives on all things real and rustic, or the neighbourhood 

guitar player to serenade the night crashers. But if that seems like a far cry, 

come armed with a couple of percussion instruments like shakers and djembes to 

indulge in some juicy jammin?.

Game gambol

Folks with interminable reserves of energy can use 

the party as an excuse to indulge in silliness you last encountered on the school 

ground. Organise activities like three-legged races, pie-eating and pumpkin carving 

contests, hide and seek and maybe even pig-wrestling for the kids and their rather 

grown up counterparts.

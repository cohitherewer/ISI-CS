The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Celebrate in harmony 

Two groups of students from different cultures, countries 

and backgrounds come together for a music concert to celebrate a good cause. As 

the two teams live and practise in unison, they learn about each other. Young 

Metro catches them in action.

Mitali Makhal stayed in a small house with her parents, 

brothers and sisters in Nepalgunj. Seven years ago, she went to live in Mathieson 

Music School, set in paddy fields beyond Thakurpukur. The 13-year-old has learnt 

to play, among other things, the violin, and has been as far as the UK to perform. 

?I want to be a musician or a teacher,? she smiles shyly.

Mitali isn?t the only one. The Mathieson School was 

started in 1994 by cellist Anup Biswas and now has 60 under-privileged students 

living and learning under its roof. ?After my father?s death, I went from our 

home in Nadia to study in Oxford Mission School in Calcutta, where Father Theodore 

Mathieson introduced me to western classical music,? recalls Biswas, now a well-known 

musician in the UK, who has even performed for the Queen of England.

The students of Mathieson, like nine-year-old cellist 

Suraj Doloi, learn a variety of skills, from Indian classical dance and math to 

English and western classical music. So far, four students have made it to the 

UK on scholarships to study music. 

In a collaboration with the Christ?s Hospital School 

in the UK, students from both schools will perform in a symphony orchestra on 

October 30 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Mathieson School. Six staff members 

and 21 students from Christ?s Hospital School are residing in the Thakurpukur 

building, as they practise with the Calcutta kids.

?It was fun practising in the open, but it was so 

hot and we were sweating so much that our instruments kept slipping,? laughs Molly 

Carroll. ?But it was really nice how they set up the rooms for us, with colourful 

mosquito nets and all. We talk to the children here quite a bit, with a lot of 

hand movements. The first day we gave them toys, and they hugged us.?

Luke Allwood, who plays the clarinet, adds that the 

group?s first trip to India has so far been ?great? and that they?d love to come 

back for more. That?s even before the students and staff are off to Darjeeling 

(after the concert) for a short holiday. 

?Living and interacting with the children of Mathieson 

School has been a real eye-opener for all of us, and has made us realise how privileged 

we are,? observes teacher Bruce Grindlay. ?But there are lots of common things 

between our schools, like the fact that even we have quite a few children from 

deprived backgrounds.?

Tradition is something that the school, founded by 

King Edward VI in 1552, also strongly believes in. The students? uniforms date 

back to the 16th century, right down to the yellow socks, which, rumour has it, 

were white, but were dipped in saffron and tied round the children?s heads at 

night to prevent the rats from biting (London used to be infested with them).

?Christ?s Hospital School has a long association with 

Calcutta. Bishop Middleton, the first Anglican Bishop of the city and founder 

of St Paul?s Cathedral, was an old boy of our school,? smiles Grindlay.

?We have three acres of land at the moment, but we 

hope to expand soon. Funds from our concerts will be used for this,? signs off 

Biswas. 

The concert is at Kala Mandir from 6.30 pm on Saturday.

Trivial? 

(A Puja poem)

Twilight tinges, 

The water reflects 

The glittering glow that mingles. 

Humans flock at the adorned site, 

Embellished and enticed, 

Boisterous blows... and smite! 

The beggar?s lair! 

Spectre-thin, lying in College Square. 

A blow to the bowl;

Who knows? 

Does anybody even care?

Desert Lake

 Ashes of blue ink, 

Remains of a pen 

Where the forked nib 

Once oozed rivers 

Like blue veins. 

And cactuses drew them to their heart. 

Prolonged osmosis ? then slept. 

They never dreamt dreams 

But listened to the drumbeat receding 

In their veins, in their arteries. 

Till silence like dry ice, slowly set in 

Never curious and like Time at times, tasteless 

The paper remained a discarded landscape 

Where only ashes sketch the silhouette 

Of the dying sun

And shift away, turn, 

Change like nothing... 

It is just the beginning of an end.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A touch of care in sunset hour

 - Aged, 

frail and poor, but bonding with life

 One of them promises she will never fight with her best friend. Another puts up an extempore show of stand-up-comedy. Yet another will not for the world miss DD Bangla?s Pratiksha Ektu Bhalobashar. 

 Some of them readily confess to being paan addicts, while none of them can get over the trips to Birla Mandir and the second Hooghly bridge.

 They are all old and frail ? thakumas, didas and dadus ? and all below the poverty line, who drop in to Calcutta Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology?s day-care centre in east Jadavpur six days a week for four hours of adda, food, recreation or rest. 

 Indrani Chakravarty, secretary of the institute, says: ?The day-care centre for the aged in Purbalok was set up in 2000. We maintain 50 elderly people at the centre and take care of all their needs ? food, clothes, health and recreation.?

 A regular day at the centre starts at noon, with the mashimas and meshomoshais ? as they are called by the caregivers ? trooping in. Says social worker Nupur Sarkar: ?Just like in school, we begin with a prayer, after which we read out the newspaper headlines to them. Next comes the period for settling disputes. The problems can be serious, often family-related and regarding torture and abuse.? 

 But as Snehalata Haldar, one of the elderly, points out: ?There are minor problems as well, regarding who will sit where in the centre or watch which programme on TV.?

 Order restored, some mashimas prefer to go and help in the institute?s kitchen as the cook prepares the mid-day meal of steaming rice, dal and vegetables. Says Sandhya Das, known for her repertoire of comic capers: ?Post-lunch it is time for us to take rest, watch TV, make thongas or carpets, embroider tablecloths or covers, or merely chew paan and catch up with each others? lives.?

 Chakravarty explains that nobody is forced to work, but if any member makes something, the institute organises for the sale and the proceeds go to the creator.

 Social workers trained in the geriatric animator course carry out door-to-door surveys and pick out the poorest elderly people within a radius of three km. 

 ?None of these aged people can afford public transport. They walk to the institute. If somebody is too frail to walk, we arrange for them to be sent to government homes,? says Chakravarty. 

 Doctors and physiotherapists attend to them a few times every week.

 ?We have been on picnics in luxury buses to Tarapith, Belur and Dakshineswar,? says Sumoti Biswas, while her friend Sabitri Haldar nods. Sujon Dey hastens to add: ?There was music in the bus.?

 The dadus and didas are on a rehearsal-high now, brushing up their poetry and music for the ?special? October 1 programme at the centre to celebrate World Elders? Day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bon Appetease

Victor Banerjee

If we cringe when people describe us as a State with 

no work culture and one that destroys rather than builds institutions, it would 

be a lot closer to the truth than describing Goa as a haven for nudism and drugs 

? which it is certainly not.

One wonders if, as a reaction to such tainted objectivism, 

it is worth burning another tram or bus or school or hospital; or maiming an industrialist, 

thrashing a doctor or kissing comrades? feet for. Why do Goans sing instead?

Bengalis and Goans are both the most laid-back (some 

might say laziest) people on the subcontinent. Football, love for music, and indolence 

are genetic inheritances engraved into our chromosomes and psyches.

But, while we indulge in ?bhashon baji? to 

blame everyone else for the mess we are in, Goans smile, imbibe quarts of coconut-palm 

Fenny and merrily dance their cares away.

We are both fish eaters and can?t live without it 

in our daily diets. Yet, we here, are more obsessed with disease, psychosomatic 

fantasies and plebeian paranoia than any consumers of Zintac on the planet.

We still innocently distinguish between Bengalis and 

Mohammedans as if the latter were not Bengalis, while Goan Christians, Muslims 

and Hindus live oblivious to religious differences ? though some sparks do fly 

when you bring up the question of American style evangelism that is creeping into 

the country; working more miracles on stage with a four voice choir and juiced-up 

band singing gospels in accompaniment, than Jesus performed on the shores of Galilee. 

Last year, when Goa was judged the most progressive 

state in India, we were all taken by surprise. This year, amazingly, it slipped 

to second place. We, of course, have held steadfastly to our victimised position 

and remain proudly one-up on Laloo?s Bihar.

They used to say that if you threw a stone anywhere 

in Goa it would either hit a priest or a pig. No more. The pigs have virtually 

disappeared and ecumenical dispensation has allowed priests to look like any one 

of us frockless sinners. But there is a trace of both that one can easily find, 

if one bothers to look. 

A mass at the cathedral of Bom Jesus where the naturally 

preserved body of St Francis Xavier lies, is still a moving experience with congregations 

of talented musicians and singers singing hymns in a style that you will never 

forget. And for adventurous eaters, on your way to Panjim from the airport, just 

as you cross the Cortalim bridge, is the village of Agaciam.

Here you will see garlands of the most mind-blowing 

smoked sausages ever conceived by man, in celebratory streamers outside almost 

every home, put up for sale.

Buy them and keep them. You don?t even need to freeze 

them. They last for up to two months simply hanging in ribbons in your pantry 

or for even six, in your refrigerator. 

A one line recipe is all you need for this delicious 

sausage, called Chouriz, that you can cook with gravy into an accompaniment with 

rice or cook it thick to slap on pao and devour.

Stare at the little sausages (don?t forget to take 

off the nigh invisible plastic wrapping) and chop up as many onions and garlic 

pearls as you think will please you.

Remo: sand and sound

Caramelise the onions and brown the garlic with as 

little oil as possible and then throw in the sausages (that release oil of their 

own) and after tossing it around for two minutes, voila! Chourizzopao!

So while the ?bhog bilashi? Bengali kills himself 

working to put food on the table of a nimno-modhdhobitto-paribar (LMC family), 

the laid back Goan simply pulls out a few delicacies from the length of streamers 

in his reserve and cooks up a meal that is nourishing, delicious and absolutely 

unique.

But for those of you who can lay your hands on the 

regular Goan sausages or even the spicy sausages available in New Market, here 

is a pulao that will make you the most popular mum, or cook, in your para.

Sausage Pulao 

Recipe for packet sausages, not the Rosary type available 

in Madgaon

Calculations per packet of sausages 

Place a pressure cooker on the gas oven and? 

 Cut some onions and bagar in very little 

oil (3-5 mins) 

 Cut up the sausages. Get it out of the covering 

and bagar with the onions (5 mins), keep stirring. The sausages will release 

a lot of oil, so don?t put too much the first time 

 Cut potatoes and bagar for 5 mins (now 

you have onion+sausage+raw potato), keep stirring

 Clean rice and wash 

 Put the raw rice in (onions+sausages+semi-cooked 

potatoes), cook for 5 mins, keep stirring

Now that everything is flavoured with that PIG? add 

water (calculated in the same cup that the rice was poured from). The ?formula? 

is, if you put 3 cups of rice, put 3 cups of water (same cup) and add one extra 

cup for your potatoes and seal the cooker... 

Now, wait with your tongue hanging out for one whistle 

and turn the gas off. Wait with your tongue hanging out for another 10 mins to 

open the cooker.

HAPPY EATING!

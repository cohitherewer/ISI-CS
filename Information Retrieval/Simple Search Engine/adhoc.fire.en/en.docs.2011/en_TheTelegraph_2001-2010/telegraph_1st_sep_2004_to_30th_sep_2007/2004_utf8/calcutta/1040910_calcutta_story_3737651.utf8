The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small Talk

To kick off a catty conversation this weekend or be 

left out of the loop, like Indian soccer, read on?

Smell a rat

Even if you want to take a break from the rat race, 

you can?t do without a little rodent rant that left a royal egg on the face of 

Bengal on black Wednesday. The half hour of darkness ? in front of the winners 

from the land of the rising sun ? at Salt Lake stadium disrupting the World Cup 

qualifying football match between India and Japan could be a funny pill to go 

with your cocktails. The hilarious excuse of a rat causing the fiasco by entering 

a sub-station close to the stadium is reason enough for a good guffaw in the face 

of the ignoble gaffe. To seal the game on an optimistic note, you may be kind 

enough to give Constantine?s boys a couple of free kicks for reducing the defeat 

margin at the legs of Zico?s men from 0-7 in Tokyo to 0-4 on home turf.

Malay magic

 Desi Puja may be selling for big bucks, but 

suave party people know better than to dig the din that is Calcutta at that time. 

Lend a touch of the Orient in that continental course by announcing plans to visit 

Malaysia, yet again. Take extra pride in informing your friends about the proposed 

direct flights by Malaysia Airlines from Calcutta to Kuala Lumpur, supposed to 

be operative from December. See them going greener by yapping about the three-days-four-nights 

package deal that comes with it for a steal.

Way of all flesh

With the best of Bollywood flocking to Tollywood for 

Bengal?s most high-flying director, here?s a rosy chance to lift the veil on the 

tale of love and longing being shot in town. The cross-currents of colonialism, 

patriarchy and religion can be discussed in all seriousness at more sober times, 

but when you?re on a high this weekend, feel free to talk the way of all flesh. 

With three attractive women (Rupa, Raima and Soha) slipping into just jewellery 

and sari for Rituparno Ghosh?s Antarmahal, and the Little B stirring up 

some ?potter? mania minus his phatua, it?s all happening here, and how!

Bitchy banter

Give the gang a scandal or two to chew on. Pick on 

the absentees to cook up who among them is dating who. Never mind the authenticity, 

the next morning is another day!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Pandal Buzz

Cloth crunch

The older the city, the bolder the citizens. With 

bold and beautiful (B amp;B) becoming the anthem of the week, there?s no stopping 

the hemlines from rising.

A taxi-driver on Saptami was all red-faced while recounting 

his brush with the B amp;B brigade. ?Sashti raate Maddox Square-e ja 

dekhlam, ekebare Nalban,? sighed the middle-aged man, referring to the pandal 

as romance capital.

And what about the girl who hopped into his cab from 

there? ?Khub chhoto jama aar finfine pant (tiny top and flimsy trousers),? 

was the clinching couture comment from the cabbie.

GenY point

Still at Maddox Square, the Puja hangout for the young 

Calcutta crowd. It?s where they go to see and be seen. On Sashti evening, the 

park was alive with the sights and sounds of school and college students doing 

what they love best on the grass ? chatting. Adults were conspicuous by their 

absence, as the youngsters huddled in groups, big and small, some lying on their 

backs others perched on papers. And, yes, puppy love was most definitely in the 

autumn air.

Mother of all gifts

With puja spirit gripping the city, it?s raining gifts 

all around. We?ve got sweets, say some; we?ve got shirts, say others. But every 

Deewar came crumbling down when one recipient declared, ?Mere paas maa 

hai?.? His prized possession from the corporate gift pack ? the clay visage 

of Ma Durga in a blue box.

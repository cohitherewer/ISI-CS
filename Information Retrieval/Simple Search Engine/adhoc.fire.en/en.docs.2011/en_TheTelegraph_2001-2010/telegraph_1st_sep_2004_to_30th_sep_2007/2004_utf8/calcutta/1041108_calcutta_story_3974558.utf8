The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without...

Making a Diwali difference

Rack your brains to devise eco-friendly crackers. Auto-emission norms deadlines 

may be repeatedly missed by the powers that be in the state of West Bengal, but 

citizens can sure do their bit to improve the state of the air we breathe. If 

you feel the need to compensate for piping down, add some colour and shimmer with 

some rustling silks (though not before the fire). Or, there?s nothing like perking 

up with a bright rangoli palette. And in the spirit of things, use flower 

petals, not chemical-based powders.

Trying your luck

You may be tempted to check your luck lustre while waiting for the goddess to 

shine on you. But to spice things up with some good, clean fun, wager things money 

can?t buy. Get the loser to cook a three-course meal. Make a date with the loser?s 

partner. Dare your boss to give a day off.

Getting trendy

Catch a glimpse of some of the designs that will rule the fashion front in the 

months to come. The Stylefile Winter Show 2004 on Saturday brings together the 

couture kings and queens ? Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Anamika Khanna, 

Rina Dhaka, Manish Malhotra, Rahul Khanna, Rohit Gandhi and the likes on the ramp 

at Hyatt Regency. And even if you are not much of a designer-wear person, indulge 

in a visual treat, watching some of the hottest bods in the country ? Jesse Randhawa, 

Joey Matthew, Tupur Chatterjee, Laxmi Rana, Sonali Rozario et al.

Catching the original fat cat

He might not meow, but Garfield has kept readers purring for decades. Now you 

can catch another cartoon character come to life in the latest live-action-meets-animation 

film, Garfield ? The Movie. Though the film may not be receiving the warmest 

of reviews, there is one good reason to try it on for size ? Bill Murray?s fantastic 

rendering of the lazy lout?s drawl. 

Checking the cricket count

Now that dada is fit to play again, the boys may not look so blue after 

all. After watching wickets tumble in record time at the Wankhede, time to pray 

for a good ? and peaceful ? game at Eden this weekend when Inzy and Co. come calling.

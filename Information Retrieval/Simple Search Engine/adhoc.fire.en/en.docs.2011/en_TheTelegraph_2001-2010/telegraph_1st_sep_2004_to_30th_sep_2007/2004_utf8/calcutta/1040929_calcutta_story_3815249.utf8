 Crazy putting or putt-putt golf is here. Calcutta, home to the world?s second oldest golfing green, is ready to unveil the country?s first indoor, nine-hole, 21-par championship-ready mini golf arena before the Pujas.

 The fully-contoured, modular miniature golf course, with moveable obstacles and multiple cups, laid across 4,000 sq ft, will be teed off by Governor Viren J. Shah on October 16 at Ocio, at Belvedere, the ?citys first leisureplex?, with a putting competition for couples.

 Pre-fabricated rockwork, waterbody and theme elements as hole hazards to add to the challenges and thrills. Movable simulated obstacles and vegetation for use on artificial greens or fairways, full-course signage? All the fun and excitement of adventure golf holes will be available in air-conditioned comfort.

 ?Mini golf is a huge craze abroad and we had the synthetic arena in our master plan when Ocio was conceptualised by our chairman S.S. Kanoria, a passionate golfer. It will be the USP of the leisureplex, and an exciting family destination in the city,? declares CEO B.M. Thakkar.

 The club plans to throw open the facility to walk-in enthusiasts for a price of Rs 200 for two rounds (18 holes) and also start a family golf membership for Rs 36,000 a year.

 Imported from Cost of Wisconsin of the US for Rs 41 lakh, the facility is recognised by the US ProMiniGolf Association (USPMGA), an affiliate of the World Minigolf Sport Federation. 

 ?It is a tournament-style course and is sanctioned by the USPMGA for world tournament play,? association president Bob Detwiler confirms in a letter to the club at 5, Belvedere Road, Alipore.

 Brandon D ?Souza, president, Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM), the agency which drives the Indian Tour, agrees the mini golf arena at Ocio could become a popular family destination, besides providing the right impetus to the uninitiated. 

 ?It?s great entertainment, a healthy pastime and has the power to bring under one roof people who have never had anything to do with golf,? says D?Souza.

 Ace golfer and coach Indrajit Bhalotia also feels mini golf is a great family outing, adding that the indoor facility at Ocio could give the novice a ?feel? of the game. ?Often, you catch the sport on TV and don?t really realise how difficult it is to sink a putt. This could offer an initiation, a start-up impetus, while essentially being a fun thing,? he observes.

 While the focus is very much on entertainment and easy fun at mini golf courses the world over, the management at Ocio is keen to take it to a bunker more serious and challenging. ?We will organise all-India corporate-level tournaments on the course, besides orientation programmes for kids to kindle their interest in the game,? offers general manager J.K. Seal.

 Involving students would be the best way forward, concurs D ?Souza.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Badman to babu

 He has donned hundreds of disguises, stepped into the shoes of thousands of bad men but is all set to appear as a ?true Bengali? for the first time.

Yes, Bollywood?s ?bad man? Gulshan Grover (seen in 

picture with Mahima Chaudhuri and in a film still with Masumi below) plays a Bengali 

film director in ace cameraman Madhu Ambat?s directorial debut 1:1.16 ? An 

Ode to Lost Love. 

 ?Earlier, I have played characters who have been Bengalis just by name,? Gulshan told Metro. ?Not here, though. I play this film-maker Probod Dasgupta, who is Bengali by sensibility. Over the years, creative intelligence has become synonymous with Bengalis. Had I been made a Punjabi in the film, my character would have been associated with a lot of guts and not creativity.?

 The film also sees Gulshan playing goodman for a change. ?I am this young hip film director who could have been trained from New York University. My best friend is the director of photography in the film, played by Atul Kulkarni. We have two very different points of view towards film-making. While I believe in making films in a very modern way, he has a very artistic approach towards the medium. 

 ?He has had a traumatic past and is in a shell as we make the film within the film. Then there is this heroine of that film, played by Masumi, who becomes friends with the cameraman. While he loves her, the girl falls in love with me. There is a shocking ending, which ultimately ruins the relationships between two friends, a brother and a sister and also a mother and a daughter.?

 Gulshan had no problems in getting the Bengali feel to his character. ?I have always had a lot of Bengali friends. Bikram Chaudhuri, the yoga guru from LA is a good friend. Then there was Bhaskar Chaudhuri. Even my first girlfriend in college was a Bengali. While aami ektu ektu Bangla bolte pari, there are no Bengali dialogues in the film. It?s an out-and-out English movie.?

 The film also marks another first-of-a-kind for Gulshan and that is his remuneration ? all of one rupee. ?Madhu has been the cameraman for many of my films and he has been a good friend all this while. This film was being funded partly by NFDC and partly by the film-maker himself. 

 ?When Madhu came to me with the role he said, ?I need a lot of your dates but I have no money to give you. If I pay you your usual fee, I have to reduce the budget for equipment, save on lights and other accessories.? Now, creativity cannot be compromised with. So I told Madhu to give me one rupee as a token.?

 That?s not all. For the shoot, Gulshan travelled in trains. ?Since that?s all he could afford, I didn?t have a problem. We were shooting in Pune and usually I stay at the Blue Diamond Hotel there. For 1:1.16, I stayed in this small guest house in a bylane behind the hotel. It was a different experience,? he signed off.

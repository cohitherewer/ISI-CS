The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Record rush to tie knot

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was an all-action Sunday, and not just at the Eden Gardens or Netaji Indoor stadium. Cricket and Russian Circus apart, a more-than-usual number of Calcutta?s young and eligible young men and women were tying the knot.

 ?Today, there has been many more marriages than usual in Calcutta,? says registrar Rina Pal. ?Each of the 155 registrars in the city must have recorded at least five marriages, which is unprecedented.? 

 About 10 to 12 marriages are performed per registrar per wedding month. So far this month, there have been only two dates. Registrars pegged the figure at a record 725-plus on Sunday.

 According to Ram Krishna Shastri of the International Institute of Astrology, the planetary positions on November 28 made it a particularly auspicious day. Venus, the ruling planet of marriage, was in a good conjunction with the moon, making it a special occasion.

 Caterer Munna Maharaj supplied the food at five weddings on Sunday night, turning down ?at least 15 more? requests. ?We have to limit ourselves, for quality control,? he said, adding that it was a specifically good and busy day on the city?s marriage calendar. 

 Hotels ? five-star and otherwise ? too, faced a glut. If Taj had three weddings, ITC Sonar Bangla had to turn down a few bookings. Observed Ranvir Bhandari, general manager, ITC Sonar Bangla: ?We have one reception. Because our other halls were booked for various events, we had to turn down requests. Today was definitely a good day for Marwari marriages.?

 Marwari businessman Sundeep Bhutoria was invited to 14 weddings on Sunday, as well as three wedding anniversaries. While the day was an auspicious one on the Hindu calendar, he felt that this year was unique. 

 ?It was the first, very auspicious mahurat after four months of no marriages, which ended on Friday. So, those who got engaged some months ago would want to get married on the first auspicious day, which happened to be today. That?s why the rush,? he explained.

 Venues were booked up, caterers sold out and marriage registrars kept busy all day as the wedding party began. 

 And it wasn?t just the Hindus either. Muslims, too, tied the knot in earnest, from Topsia to Tollygunge.

 Imran Zaki, who runs a leather products chain in town, said: ?I saw three marriages in Topsia alone, and I was invited to another. In our community, there is a spurt of marriages post-Id and Sunday seems to be especially busy.?

 According to festive figures from other cities, both Mumbai and Delhi had crossed the 1,000 mark. 

 But if the crowded corners near marriage halls were any indication, Calcutta is catching up, and fast.

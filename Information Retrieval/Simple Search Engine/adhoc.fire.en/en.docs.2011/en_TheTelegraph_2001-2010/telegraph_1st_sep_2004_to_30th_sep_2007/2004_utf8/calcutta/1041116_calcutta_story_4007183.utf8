 Cops block cop march

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Whenever policemen from Calcutta have visited Bihar or Jharkhand to arrest gangsters for crimes committed in the city, they have been confronted with the police-criminal nexus that exists in these two neighbouring states. 

 Sometimes, they have failed to arrest a criminal only because police in Bihar and Jharkhand refused to cooperate.

 ?In the past six months, whenever we went there, it was a nightmarish experience. The way they behaved with us is beyond belief,? said an officer of the detective department, who, along with others, was kept confined in a police station in the capital of Bihar for 10 hours last week.

 Annoyed with the refusal to cooperate, sleuths have complained to city police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty. According to officers, the matter will be taken up soon by the state government.

 An officer of a central Calcutta thana said he had gone to Ranchi to arrest the mastermind of a fake marksheet racket four months ago. ?After arresting the accused, we brought him to the local police station. Officers present at the police station asked us to submit the papers related to the case. We provided evidence of the man collecting Rs 3 lakh from different clients to sell fake marksheets of various institutions affiliated to Jharkhand and Bihar-based universities,? said the officer.

 ?The officers placed Rs 3 lakh in cash on the table of the officer-in-charge. They asked us to take the money and release the accused,? said the officer, adding: ?The proposal was astounding. They told us to return the money to the clients from whom the accused had collected it. They even suggested that we tear the arrest warrant and tell our bosses that the mastermind could not be arrested.?

 Citing another example, a sleuth of the detective department?s motor theft section said: ?We went to Bihar two months ago and recovered a four-wheeler stolen from the city. We kept the car in a police station near Patna because we needed a permission from court to bring back the vehicle to Calcutta. When we went there with the court permission, the car was not there.? 

 An officer at Lalbazar said: ?Gangsters from these two states come here frequently and return after committing serious crimes. We have specific information about the whereabouts of the goons. But we can?t share it with the Bihar and Jharkhand police.?

 Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (detective department) said: ?I will discuss it with the authorities concerned.?

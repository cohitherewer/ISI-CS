 A more proactive dialogue between decision-makers and professional architects/planners, people?s participation and respect for the laws of nature are the key requirements to improve built environment, according to the architects? fraternity.

 ?Cities have long histories and we must be extremely sensitive to the past when we build. We can?t allow bureaucrats and politicians to take over public space. The administration must listen to the professionals and not just pay lip service,? Arvind Krishan, head, department of architecture, School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), New Delhi, told Metro on Monday.

 Krishan is in town for Natcon 2004, the 21st national convention of the Indian Institute of Architects (IIA). His views were echoed by IIA president Balbir Verma: ?West Bengal has set high standards through the public-private participation model, which needs to be carried forward through increased dialogue with end-users.?

 Summit convener Mukul Mitra and IIA West Bengal chapter chairman Dulal Mukherjee concurred that the government must act to ?stop non-technical persons? from influencing project profiles. ?Unilateral decisions can?t be taken in public space development anymore,? stressed Mitra.

 Krishan lamented that Calcutta?s rich cultural heritage is ?not often expressed in its architecture emphatically?. He said: ?Some of my students at SPA have done theses on Calcutta?s riverfront development, and it has tremendous potential. However, one international flower market or renovating the Strand warehouses may not be enough. Development along the waterfront has to be contiguous and must include all the stakeholders.?

 Vadodara-based architect Karan Grover, an expert in green buildings, felt Calcutta has ?remained somewhat insular? to the country?s evolving architecture matrix. ?Maybe the city needs more icons to enthuse budding architects and students, and getting noted outstation architects and planners down to speak as visiting faculty might add to the excitement,? he observed.

 Concerned at the ?brain drain? to IT and other ?more lucrative? sectors, the state chapter is considering setting up a dedicated architecture/planning institute in Bengal.

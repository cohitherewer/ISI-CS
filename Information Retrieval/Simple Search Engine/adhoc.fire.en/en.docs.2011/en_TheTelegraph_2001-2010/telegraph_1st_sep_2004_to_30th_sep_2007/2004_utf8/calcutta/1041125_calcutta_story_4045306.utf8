 3 grilled over murder

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Three persons have been detained by Howrah police in connection with the murder of Sekhar Roy, who was shot dead on Vidyasagar Setu on Tuesday morning.

 Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, superintendent of police (Howrah), said vital clues have been obtained about the identity of the killers, who were still in the district.

 ?It is just a matter of time before we get to the bottom of the case. We won?t reveal the identities of the killers for the sake of investigation,? added Bhattacharya.

 After a combing operation, the special operation group of Howrah police picked up Roy?s driver Raj Kumar Mondal, alias Raja, and two others, Mohan and Joydeb, identified as local toughs. All three are residents of Khetra Banerjee Lane, in the Shibpur police station area.

 ?They have not yet been arrested but have been grilled for several hours. We have obtained vital clues from them,? said a senior police official. 

 On Wednesday, a police team carried out a reconstruction of the murder on the flyover leading to the toll plaza of the bridge in the presence of Narayan Khatua, an employee of Roy who was present at the time of murder. 

 ?He has showed us how the murder took place, but we need to clarify a few things,? said an officer of the team. 

 Preliminary investigation has revealed that the killers knew when Roy used to fetch the money from his business partner Piyal Bhadra, who lives near Bengal Engineering and Science University in Shibpur. They followed Roy for a few days, but got the opportunity on Tuesday morning, when he was on a motorcycle, taking the money to deposit it in a bank in Calcutta. It was also learnt that for the past three years, Roy used to collect the money from his business partner?s house. 

 ?There is no doubt that the killers knew the locality very well and that is why they managed to flee from the spot so quickly,? Bhattacharya said.

 Roy?s 87-year-old father Birendranath said on Wednesday that only chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s intervention could lead to the arrest of the culprits.

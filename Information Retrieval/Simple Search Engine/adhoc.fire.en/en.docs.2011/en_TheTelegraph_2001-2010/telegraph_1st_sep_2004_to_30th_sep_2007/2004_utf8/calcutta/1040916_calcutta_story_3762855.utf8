The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Man of action, high on ideas

 D. Ashish

 The demographic map of north Calcutta is such that highrises are flanked by slums. Wails of the bereaved and accounts of people dying without treatment regularly reached these residents. Ashish Dutta (better known now as D. Ashish), then a strapping collegian, was among the few who sat up and took note of the suffering. Thus, in 1980, was born the seed of Medical Bank, a name to reckon with in social work. 

 ?So many people throw away medicines. We thought it would be a good idea if we could collect them and put them to use. Once the medicines reached us, we went to the local doctors and enlisted their help,? Ashish recalls. As patients queued up from Kumartuli, Sovabazar, Bagbazar and Ahiritola, Medical Bank started its next project of collecting used spectacles.

 A good five years went by and the Bank went from strength to strength. ?By 1985, we were going out to check on patients in slums near and far with our mobile vans.?

 With health, came the thought for education. ?We started a school with 12 streetchildren, called Jibon.? In quick succession followed schools for child labourers and children of sex-workers. ?We also opened a centre for working women where maids and factory-hands would come to pick up the three As, sewing lessons and family planning methods. We even got them to bring their husbands once a month for counselling.? This worked wonders for the families as many of them left their drinking ways and the path of crime. The streetchildren now even celebrate occasions like bhaiphonta and rakhibandhan, informs the diminutive man of action.

 Another significant milestone that his organisation has achieved, feels Ashish, is increasing awareness about blood donation. ?When we started out, so many people thought it led to weakness. In these 25 years, we have created 10,000-15,000 donors.? 

 He also sends out a message to parents about to marry off their children. ?A father spends so much on a wedding. Why not do a simple blood test to check thalassaemia??

 He is emphatic in his belief that if one is transparent and genuine in one?s actions, there will no dearth of helping hands. ?We have received gifts of ambulance, ultrasonography and ECG machines, oxygen cylinders as well as cash from people. Our volunteers number 10,000 across the state.?

 Ashish?s operations has spread too far and wide for exhaustive mention. ?I wish there were more hours to a day,? he smiles. So busy has the 44-year-old disciple of Swami Vivekananda been that he has not had even time to marry. ?That would hamper my work,? he states.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Man shot at by drunken friends

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Twenty five-year-old Kishore Paswan had a narrow escape on Wednesday when one of his friends fired at him. The friend, who was drunk, missed his target and the bullet grazed past Paswan?s abdomen. 

 The injured man has been admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition, but the police have failed to arrest the friend.

 The incident took place on Muktaram Babu Street, in the Jorasanko police station area.

 ?Paswan left his north Calcutta residence around 7 pm. He and his friends spent three hours together, doing the rounds of the local pandals. The group then went to another friend?s house, where Paswan was invited for drinks,? elaborated an officer of the police station.

 Paswan wanted to leave the place at 10.30 pm. But two of his friends, Bittu and Raju, requested him to stay back for another half-an-hour, to which he agreed.

 During preliminary investigation, police came to know that a quarrel broke out between Paswan and the other two, both in their early 20s. 

 They referred to a dispute among them that took place a few months back.

 ?Soon, Paswan and the duo were engaged in a scuffle. None of them was in his senses,? the officer said. ?Bittu and Raju first beat up Paswan. When he slumped to the ground, Bittu took out a firearm and pulled the trigger,? he added. 

 ?But he missed the target and the bullet grazed past Paswan?s abdomen. Immediately after, Bittu, Raju and the others present at the party fled,? the officer explained.

 A sleuth on the case said: ?It seems the attack was deliberate. The group invited Paswan to drink together with an intention to kill him. He is not in a position to answer our queries. But we are certain that the attack was a sequel to an old rivalry.?

 In search of the self

 Rooted in a concern to respond to and protest against all the forces that inhibit the fulfilment of humanity, Rangakarmee, one of the country?s leading theatre groups, demonstrates in its performances the battle for survival and tales of struggle of repressed women of different standing and in different circumstances down the ages. In Antar-yatra, Usha Ganguli (who designs, directs and acts) brings together the experiences of these women, assuming various personae in a powerful collage of acts, to play out the whole history of womanhood, particularly in the Indian context. Portraying a rich and complex reality through the idiom of her performance, Ganguli takes the audience on a journey into their inner selves, whereupon they gain critical understanding of the deprivation, discrimination and injustice that they are subject to, even today. Incorporating a number of dramatic modes, ranging from the naturalistic to the epic, highlights the roles that each woman protagonist assumes, who all emerge to a higher state of realization as they grow within the play.

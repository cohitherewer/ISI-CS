The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bite bonanza to power eleventh-hour spree

 Nobody 

 wants to be lonely? sang Ricky Martin and Christina 

 Aguilera at City Centre. The lonesome twosome was blaring 

 out of the jukebox at Hangout, the chill-out zone at the 

 Salt Lake entertainment hub unveiled on Saturday evening.

 Creative cuisine and live band music were other attractions at the opening of the hangout. ?The bottom line is to provide variety and warmth to the shoppers who do not always have the time to have elaborate meals. So Hangout will provide the option of catching up with some grub before and after the shopping mania,? said Vineet Verma, CEO of Bengal Ambuja Metro Development Limited.

 And shopping mania sure is catching on at the Charles Correa-signature destination. Footfalls in excess of 40,000 last Sunday and sales of Rs 17.13 lakh-plus logged by anchor Shoppers? Stop are definite pointers to the buoyancy.

 A mega push is being provided by the 26-day Mela. Kicked off on October 10 with the show Celebrating Confluence featuring Span, Dhwani and Sapphire, the festival offers a mixed bag of events and activities. Visitors can participate in various competitions, adda sessions, antakshari and tambola, while DJ sessions, music concerts and fashion shows are lined up, as are games, rides, competitions and activities for kids.

 ?During The Mela, there will not only be offers and bargains galore across the gamut of shopping, food and entertainment options available at City Centre, but the sprawling concourse will be alive with events and activities for everyone. This is an attempt to continue the evolution of the property?s philosophy of ?confluence? ? of all kinds of products and services for all kinds of people,? explains Harsh Neotia, the man behind the novel mixed-use project. 

 With the big-ticket Pizza Hut leading the way, a clutch of new outlets has been unveiled since the inauguration on June 5. And now, the 6,500-sq ft funky food court adds to the platter pick.

 If Stun the Sun promises to shine with veggie delights, Yummy Tummy dishes out Chinese favourites. The chatpata chaats from Bombay Shivsagar and biryani and kathi rolls from Kwality can be rounded off with a final stop at Just Desserts for some caramel custard and Baked Alaska. All of this while you just Hangout!

 Stage truths

 What does one do when Calcutta laps up bedroom farces from Mumbai ignoring the classy acts in its own backyard? To get to the bottom of the matter ? or maybe go behind the scenes ? city-based troupe Theatrecian gathered its peers and a room full of stage veterans at Crossword Bookstore on Friday.

 The adda on commercialisation of English theatre and its prospects took off with the salt-and-pepper brigade of Sumit Roy and Katy Lai Roy, among others.

 The popular pendulum swung in favour of packing in more mass appeal in stage productions as several panelists reiterated the need to reach out to a wider audience. ?As a director I would like to do plays that I like to see or read. But yes, we need to be more flexible in order to make theatre commercially viable,? said Katy Lai, of The Red Curtain.

 Members of Theatrecian snatched the opportunity to enact some scenes from its forthcoming productions, Tom Stoppard?s The Real Inspector Hound and Jean Paul Satre?s The Respectful Prostitute.

 Flashback

 Beatles, Elvis Presley, Abba ? the night was all nostalgia at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) this weekend.

 Singer Francis Lepcha belted out the golden melodies from the cushy comfort of his chair. ?I?d like to move more, but there?s no space to manoeuvre,? lamented the singer happily pointing to the packed floor.

 Part of the fun Friday concept that kicked off last week with a rock ?? roll night at the club, the 60s music took the older lot down memory lane as they nursed their drink and looked wistfully at the younger crowd going crazy on the floor.

 The event, organised by Innovative Ivy and sponsored by Castle Lager, went down real well with all those looking for a welcome departure from the ear-splitting noise at other regular night haunts.

 Those who still wanted to rock Royal found DJ Craig?s mix great to groove to.

 Glitter grab

 There?s nothing as wholesome as wholesale, some say. After doing 25 years of business as suppliers to better-known jewellery brands in the country RR Agarwal Jewellers Pvt Ltd unveiled its own showroom at Azimgunje House on Camac Street this Saturday.

 But there was no missing the wholesale hangover as the last-minute Puja shoppers and early Diwali shoppers were lured by the jewellery house offering ornaments at wholesale ? not retail ? rate.

 If the show window aglitter with heavy pieces was not magnet enough, Shweta Keswani of the popular STAR Plus serial Des Mein Nikla Hoga Chand has been flown down for a touch of small-screen glamour.

 With prices starting at Rs 3,000, Camac Street might play host to yet another popular shop stop.

 Diamond diner

 So what if Marilyn Monroe is known to have bathed in champagne? Now, you can have diamonds for dessert.

 Yet another gimmick for the gullible glutton, the offer on at Oh! Calcutta and Mainland China allows each diner a scratch card at the end of their meal carrying the promise of a lucky draw and a gold gift.

 If this whets your appetite, the jewellery to be won will be from Oyzterbay. As for the promised dessert, it will arrive at the end of the celebrations as a draw of lots. The jackpot winner will take home a piece of diamond jewellery.

 Out to lunch

 Office-goers at and around Ho-Chi Minh Sarani have a brand new haunt to lunch at now. The Golden Park opposite Metro Plaza is offering a Chinese buffet lunch at its recently opened lounge resto bar, Fusion.

 Priced at Rs 275 per head, the buffet packs in an array of soups, starters, the main course and desserts. One can choose between veg and non-veg soups, veg and non-veg starters, four vegetarian dishes, three non-veg dishes, veg/non-veg noodles or rice and a variety of desserts. While there are Spring Rolls and Crispy Chilli Potatoes for starters, there?s Devil?s Prawns and Thai Chicken apart from more fish and lamb preparations to go with noodles or rice. An assortment of vegetables including mushroom, baby corn and broccoli powers the veg platter. 

 ?We are targeting the busy executives in the area who don?t have too much time to spare for lunch and like to grab a light bite. Therefore, we zeroed in on Chinese cuisine which is inherently light and healthy unlike a full-course Indian meal,? said owner B.S. Gujral. 

 The buffet is available between 12.30 pm and 3 pm.

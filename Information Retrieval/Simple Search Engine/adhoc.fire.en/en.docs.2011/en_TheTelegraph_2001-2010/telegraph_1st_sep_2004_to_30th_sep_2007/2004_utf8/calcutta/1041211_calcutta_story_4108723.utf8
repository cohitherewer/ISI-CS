The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The railway authorities must be praised for introducing earthen cups for serving 

beverages. Most roadside tea-stalls and vendors still serve tea in plastic cups, 

which are not environment friendly. Can?t the civic body also ban use of plastic 

cups at these stalls? It will help a lot in solving the problem of land pollution 

in the city. 

 Md. Ayub, Bright Street. 

 Residents of CIT Road, in the Kankurgachhi area, always park their cars on 

the pavements during the day instead of using their garages. This causes much 

inconvenience to pedestrians. The stretch, from the Kankurgachhi crossing to the 

Phoolbagan intersection, has been widened not by reducing the width of the pavements 

but by cutting into the boulevard dividing the two flanks. So, the car owners 

continue to encroach upon the pavements which have developed uneven surfaces. 

Why doesn?t the Corporation stop this illegal parking?

 Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake. 

 Those who put up signboards and posters on lampposts periodically hire men 

to lop off the branches of trees planted in the past few years by the forest department. 

A few days ago, they struck near Bentinck Street and cut off the branches in the 

dead of night. When some pavement-dwellers, resisted the labourers admitted that 

they were acting for these advertising companies. The next morning the street 

was piled with hacked-off branches and the Corporation sweeper, as usual, refused 

to touch the litter. We urge the police to crack down on these ad companies responsible 

for this attack on greenery. 

 Leena Biswas, Bentinck Street. 

 Barrackpore Trunk Road is notorious for traffic jams. It has been so for years 

and the government is quite content to leave it that way. The road was widened 

but since it is used as an illegal parking lot and because shanties and shops 

come up overnight along the sides, any effort to hasten traffic movement proves 

futile. So, every morning while going to work I inevitably face traffic jams at 

Dunlop, the Sinthee crossing or further down near Tobin Road. The snarl-ups hold 

up traffic for 10 to 15 minutes, or sometimes longer. But on Tuesday morning it 

was worse than ever. It took the bus an hour to cross a stretch between Sinthee 

and Tobin Road that should not take more than five minutes to traverse. At the 

end of this ordeal, passengers discovered that traffic was moving along a single 

file so that the contractor could enjoy the privilege of repairing the stretch 

at 10 am, a peak hour. Is there any logic to this? 

 Urmila Nayak, Khardah.

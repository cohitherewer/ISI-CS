The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Floating like a butterfly...

Rani, Namrata, Raveena, Mahima, Aarti and now Amisha 

(picture below) ? Adnan Sami?s bevy of Bollywood beauties just keeps growing bigger. 

?I know there is a curiosity around my videos and I ensure that there is always 

a surprise presence,? smiled the big man, during his recent visit to the city 

for Samsung [V] Super Singer contest.

 While the video featuring Amisha Patel as a dance student has gone on air from Sunday, Adnan?s new album Teri Kasam will only release on October 27. ?It has been a very intense album for me. I started off with as many as 85 tracks and narrowed them down to eight. I have had to do the composing in the middle of a world tour. It was maddening but very fulfilling at the same time. What I have tried to do is take my music to the next level after my last couple of albums. It has been all about fierce concentration.?

 Adnan, who has worked with the very best in the industry, wants to collaborate with other musicians for his projects. ?Even for Teri Kasam I invited a couple of musicians. Pandit Vishwamohan Bhatt has played the mohanveena while Ustad Sultan Khan has played the sarangi. In the future, I may do more out-and-out instrumental albums.?

 The year-end will also see Adnan venturing into Bollywood music direction in a big way. After composing one-off tracks in many films, he will be the sole music director for Salman Khan?s home production Lucky. ?I was taking my time. I never rush into anything. Even the frequency of my albums is lesser than the others. I believe in taking my own sweet time,? he explained.

 The Lift kara de man was impressed with the Calcutta singers whom he selected from the Super Singer auditions. ?Of the 39 I chose from here, 29 were girls. So the boy-girl divide was quite radical. But the talent is quite good with respect to that in Mumbai and Delhi.?

 Unlike other talent hunts, Adnan is just looking for a golden voice and not a Julia Roberts lookalike. ?I am also seeking someone versatile. That?s the key in playback singing. Look at Ashaji ? she can sing a qawwali, a cabaret, a typical love song, a ghazal, just about anything. If you go on singing one type of song you get branded. But that is something some singers try and achieve deliberately.?

 Adnan feels that talent hunts like Super Singer are more of a reality check than a heartbreaker for those losing out. ?Many people jeopardise their education and career taking themselves to be great singers. This basic assessment points out their true standing and advises them to keep singing as just a hobby. And for those who come out on top, well, it?s like the mountain coming to Moses.?

Fashion fiasco in the skies

Ritu Rules

Ritu Kumar on why our flight uniforms 

have failed to take off

Our national airlines gives many visitors the first 

impression of India. From a fashion perspective, too, it portrays the philosophy 

of the airline, much as Singapore and Thailand portray a traditional, yet concise 

message that reflects well on their countries.

In today?s corporate world, professionalism is a much 

sought after word. And nowhere is its absence more apparent than in government 

or state-run organisations when compared to newly-minted private companies.

One look at the corporate uniforms of Jet Airways 

or Sahara Airlines will give you a feel that, in their own distinct way, each 

one is portraying an image born out of a thought process reflecting the company?s 

philosophy. 

Indian Airlines, on the other hand, seems to think 

that diversity is the order of the day. Two types of patterns are used for the 

saris worn by the stewardesses. One pattern with curling vines is in a turquoise 

colour, and the other is a completely different, more ethnic pattern in rust orange. 

The quality of the saris is most ordinary and the design unimaginative.

Air India also goes through many processes of choosing 

their uniform design. Unfortunately, it is in many ways amateurish. The decision 

on something as important as the image of the country is not handled by a professional 

design team but left to ad hoc decisions made by officials who are not qualified 

to deal with the task. It does not seem to follow a clear colour palette or a 

storyboard. Uniforms, by their nature, have to follow a minimum requirement of 

aesthetics in proportion to functionality and formality.

I have on occasion been asked by various airlines 

to design their uniforms. The difference between how a company like British Airways 

and Air India approach the subject is glaring. Air India issues tenders for designs, 

or asks inexperienced students to do the job. More often than not, the decision 

on the design lies with the wife of the person in charge. This whimsically quaint 

way of dealing with the matter just builds up a wide diversity of design, and 

not a consistent visual.

No other country has the richness of India?s textiles. 

We as a nation have managed to keep an indigenous identity in our fashions and 

clothing. This in particular applies to women?s clothing. Under the highly professional 

JRD Tata team, we saw our airline stewardesses sporting sophisticated woven saris 

from Kanchipuram. This was followed with a design made in the bandini technique, 

again very attractive, exotic and representative of India?s crafts and colour. 

After the government take-over of the national airline, 

confusion has prevailed. If the government would wake up to the necessity of joining 

the professional world, we would once again see a more sophisticated presentation 

of our airline staff. Also, it would be a pleasure to see some of the most beautiful 

of Indian textiles reflected as part of our national airlines? image.

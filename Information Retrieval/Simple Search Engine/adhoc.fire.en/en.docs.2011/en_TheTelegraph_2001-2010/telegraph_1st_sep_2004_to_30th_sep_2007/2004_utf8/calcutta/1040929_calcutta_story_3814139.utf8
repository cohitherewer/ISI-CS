 Colours of the season

 The many-hued splendour of the season of rains inspires the monsoon exhibition of Indian art and sculpture hosted by Idiyas Gallery. With an impressive collection of carefully selected masterpieces, the ongoing show is a veritable visual treat for those with an eye for colour and craftsmanship. Paintings in a riot of vibrant colours are on display, in a variety of mediums including tempera, watercolour, oil, acrylic and charcoal. Experimental forms such as metal, bronze, marble and fibreglass share pride of place in the exhibit of magnificent sculptures. What is special about this exhibition is that while it calls upon the genius of renowned masters like Paritosh Sen, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Prakash Karmakar and Suhas Roy, it also acknowledges the talents of promising young artists like Rajesh Roy (Personal Feelings; picture above), Debabrata Chakravorty, Sumon Roy, Sajal Kanti Mitra and Parimal Bhowmick.

 When: Till October 17; 10.30 am - 7.30 pm

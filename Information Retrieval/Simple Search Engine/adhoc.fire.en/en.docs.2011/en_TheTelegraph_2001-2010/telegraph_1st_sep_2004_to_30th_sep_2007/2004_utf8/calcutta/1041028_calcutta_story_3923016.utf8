DEREK O?BRIEN

 Welcome to a new column in its third week! You will enjoy this if you are a Calcuttan (there can never be a ?Kolkatan?!). You don?t have to be a quiz junkie to relish this column. We will bring you nuggets of our favourite city under any of the ?Cal? categories each week. So there could be Gastronomi-Cal, Histori-Cal, Topi-Cal, Comi-Cal, Physi-Cal, Typi-Cal, Politi-Cal, or even Lexi-Cal. This week, let?s get Histori-Cal and Gastronomi-Cal.

QUESTIONS

Histori-Cal 

1. Calcutta has many famous buildings. Here 

is a question on one of them. The foundation stone of which famous building did 

King George V, then the Prince of Wales, lay on January 4, 1906? 

 2. Here is a little- known fact about a very well-known Bengali. The transfer of which famous Indian is often regarded as the only known submarine-to-submarine transfer of a human during World War II? 

 3. How well do you know the national flag? Try this. The evolution of the Indian national flag is usually traced back to one that was hoisted in August 1906, in Parsee Bagan Square in Calcutta. Which two words were inscribed on this flag? 

Gastronomi-Cal

topi-cal 

Typi-Cal The present logo of the Calcutta Municipal 

Corporation was adopted on February 22, 1961. Among other things, it features 

a Mayurpankshi boat. The boat depicts the erstwhile naval trade of southern Bengal, 

a reminder of the times when Calcutta was a bustling commercial hub to reckon 

with. Many of us are still waiting for a return to the glory days of Calcutta 

as a top-notch business centre.

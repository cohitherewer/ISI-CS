The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Jacket in jamewar jam

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

Design 

Gallery, the chic multi-designer outlet inside Burlingtons on Free School Street, 

launched its festive collection on Thursday. With a melange of styles ? the magical 

Indian five yards to the western jacket ? all a woman could want is here, under 

one roof.

 Fabrics used range from tweed silk to khadi, linen to georgette, tussar to gleaming silk. Bright shades of pink, orange and electric blue and the classic black are the favoured hues of the collection.

 Labels on the racks include Shane and Falguni Peacock, Malini Ramani, Aki Narula and Geisha. But it?s the Calcutta-based Komal Sood?s designs that score the highest in terms of style and attitude. Her range of tops, skirts, jackets and salwarkurtas merge simplicity and innovative appeal with elan. Take the churidars, for instance, which come with flat fronts to help combat the usual bunching up around the waist and hips. Or the funky dupattas with small contrasting colour patches attached to them as embellishments.

 Her collection of skirts in silk, tussar and tweed silk are pop picks as well. The silk tweed skirts with bias cuts stretch to figure-hugging perfection.

 ?Kurtis are actually out of fashion now and tops are in once again,? said Komal, pointing out her line of plain and chiffon-layered silk tops. 

 Tops with khari prints and embroidered collars are other new arrivals worth checking out. Graceful, ethnic eveningwear in blacks, creams and a few subtle shades also form part of Komal?s collection.

 But it?s the reversible jackets in tussar, khadi and jamewar from Komal?s stable that steal the show. Meant for semi-formal evenings, the jackets come in various lengths. The reversible jackets with French cuffs have minimal detailing in kantha.

 The jackets range from Rs 3,500 onwards. A range of saris from Rs 6,500 to Rs 19,500 is also available. In bright colours and with intricate zari work, these are great for family gatherings and of course, the great Indian wedding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Drizzles depress spirits

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcuttans woke up to an overcast sky and dank weather for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday, with the depression staying put over the city. 

 As the intermittent drizzle all day dragged down the temperature steeply, the weather office on Wednesday predicted intermittent rain in the city and its adjoining areas during the next 24 hours, with the possibility of heavy rains in some parts. 

 The districts of south Bengal, particularly the coastal regions, have been warned of heavy rain. 

 ?The depression that had developed near Calcutta last Sunday has hardly shifted. It is moving very slowly in a north-westerly direction. So, we expect bad weather to continue for at least another day,? said K.K. Chakraborty, director of the weather section at the regional meteorological centre at Alipore. 

 High winds, ranging between 55 kph to 65 kph, have been blowing in the coastal areas and the Met office has flashed an alert for fishermen.

 The rain spelt bad news for the kitchen, with most vegetable prices climbing by 50 p to Rs 1.50 a kg.

 Writers? Buildings, too, was rain-hit. A number of ministers arrived late for the Cabinet meeting. Greeted by quite a few empty chairs when he entered, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asked: ?Has a rainy day been declared??

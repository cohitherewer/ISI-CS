The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Go wild for a week

Spare a thought for the animal kingdom, ravaged and 

spoilt by human hands. Jungles are not as green as they used to be and a lot of 

our furry and feathered friends are in danger of extinction. Young Metro 

takes a look at some of the programmes to be held in the forthcoming few days, 

to be celebrated as national Wildlife Week.

 Urban animals in concrete jungles, have little time 

to pause and ponder about our counterparts living in the leafy greens. Except 

that these places are not so green anymore. Thanks to man-made threats like poaching, 

the animals do not have a spring in their step either. Even the king of the jungle 

needs a hand staying alive on his own turf ? the Kenya Wildlife Service is pushing 

to give the African lion protected status. Conservative estimates put the population 

of the big cats at 23,000, Kenya wrote in a proposal.

The status of the Royal Bengal tiger is no secret, 

and diminishing forest cover is forcing the endangered wild elephants in Asia, 

estimated at between 35,000 and 50,000, to encroach into surrounding human settlements. 

Hundreds of humans and elephants die as a result of the conflict every year. 

Wildlife Week, observed in India since 1972 in the 

first week of October, gives us a chance to do our bit to save this corner of 

the world. The directorate of forests uses the occasion to raise awareness about 

the well-being of our furry and feathered friends.

?Students are our target group,? says V.K. Yadav, 

conservator of forests, wildlife, West Bengal. This year, a plethora of activities 

has been planned from this weekend. First up is a quiz on Wildlife and their Habitat 

on October 2, from 9.30 am, at South Point High School. The quiz is for Classes 

IX to XII, with separate editions in English and Bengali. Twelve three-member 

teams have already registered. It will be conducted by Leslie Samuel, and is likely 

to be a visual treat with Yadav promising the use of lots of slides. ?Even if 

we ask a question on the number of species of tigers in the country, we will be 

showing a clip,? explains the conservator, who is also a wildlife photographer. 

The next day, a sit-and-draw contest will be held 

at St James School at 10 am. While the theme will remain the same, this event 

will involve the juniors as well, with the three categories ? up to nine years, 

10 to 14 and 15 to 18 years.

The prize distribution will be held on October 6 at 

the Indian Museum auditorium, with the chief minister doing the honours. 

Yadav says the forest department does not want to 

restrict its activities to Wildlife Week. ?We want an army of people to support 

our cause.? Response has come from the youngsters of the National Cadet Corps, 

who have taken part in several raids on bird markets.

?In the past five years, we have rescued about 10,000 

birds and set them free in the neighbouring greens,?says Yadav. The directorate 

has intensified its awareness activities through slide shows and talks in schools 

on topics like the importance of the wetlands. ?We are also motivating the nature 

clubs in the city,? he adds.

What?s on your mind this week

 Census 

censure

The latest census has stirred up a religious storm 

in a political tea cup. But the most worrying trend is the skewed girl:boy sex 

ratio. The number of girls being born compared to boys is dropping at an alarming 

rate. Legislation banning sex determination tests has not controlled female foeticide. 

It is not enough to say the practice is illegal, constant supervision is needed 

and punishment should be meted out to the guilty. Sex determination and abortion 

clinics abound even in rural areas under the guise of ultrasound centres, but 

so far no doctor or would-be parent has been caught. While the malaise affects 

the entire north, the worst offenders are, surprisingly, in one of in the most 

prosperous states in the country ? Punjab. The Sikh community is known for its 

progressive views and practices, and in fact the Akal Takht, the highest Sikh 

religious body, issued an edict in 2001 which threatened ex-communication to any 

Sikh indulging in female foeticide. But it needs implementation. Greater social 

awareness is required to change attitudes and the mindless preference for male 

progeny.

Actress-turned-director Revathy deserves accolades 

aplenty for her Phir Milenge, her second film as director. It revolves 

around the much-prejudiced fatal disease, AIDS. It is not a commercial flick and 

perhaps that?s why it failed at the box office. But it did not stop the lady. 

With her maiden venture, Mitr ? My Friend, she?s got a National Award under 

her belt. She has garnered, in no time, an impeccable reputation. It will to take 

her a long way.

Tea and talk

An adda session over steaming cups of elaichi 

cha, and if you?re fortunate, garam samosas to spice things up ? Srijan 

offers this to all. The difference: the focus of discussion is not if Saurav is 

the best Indian captain or Faria Alam?s love (ahem!) conquests. Instead, you talk 

about something more meaningful ? literature and music. Srijan gives you the opportunity 

to decipher literature and music in your own way and bars you from being guided 

by anyone else?s perceptions. It gives you a platform for your mind to think and 

your soul to feel. Srijan could also help you discover a budding poet or writer 

in yourself. If this sounds ?antellectual?, join up to find out for sure at the 

rooftop of 176, Sarat Bose Road. Discover yourself and the world around you.

Politicos

?Presi? and ?politics? are indeed synonymous. If you 

take a stroll from the portico of the main-building to Promodda?s canteen, 

you would be hard-pressed to find a single stretch of wall devoid of graffiti! 

With annual elections through secret ballot deciding which party will form the 

college union, Presidency is a miniature political system. Although there are 

political tensions at times and even minor tussles, it?s untrue that any student 

who enters Presidency will inevitably be sucked into politics. But it also serves 

a purpose. The union helps in maintaining the college campus and in organising 

numerous cultural programs and events, including the annual-fest, Milieu. It is 

often the only means of voicing students? opinions.

Tintin and Alph-Art is the little-known last 

volume of the Tintin series, left unfinished by Herge?s death in 1983. Tintin 

et l?Alph-Art was published posthumously, incomplete and in sketch form (picture 

above shows a drawing from the book). However, three unofficial versions of Alph-Art 

were completed by other artists and then published, including Yves Rodier?s 1995 

version, R?gric?s 1996 version and one by Ramo Nash. In the story, Captain Haddock, 

on Bianca Castafiore?s advice, buys a piece called Alph-Art. A few days later, 

the owner of the art gallery where the Alph-Art was stored is mysteriously assassinated. 

Tintin investigates and discovers a stash of fake masterpieces, which seems to 

be linked to a secret sect that Castafiore joined. Tintin is kidnapped during 

his search and the last frame of Herge?s work shows him being led towards the 

place where he will be cast into an abstract statue...

I elbow and jostle 

Amidst the din and bustle 

Tracing my steps 

Through gaping faces 

And fleeting heads 

The streets are all clogged 

And my mind?s too, I feel 

Trapped in this sickening drill.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small Talk

Just the right mood to plan a rain bash but chances 

are most of you have already had your fill of all things wet (from the romance 

to the laundry) over the past week. So here?s some munchies to mouth with steaming 

cuppas, in between those aaa-tishooos, that is. 

Weather woes

 For once you don?t have to turn to the weather as 

the last resort. The forecast for the weekend is still the drizzle and the depression. 

It may be ages since you went out clutching your shopping bag early in the morning, 

but a little clucking to do with the rising prices of essentials, while nibbling 

at your cheeses and canap?s, will help maintain a healthy balance.

Will power

 As the vs B battle snowballs into a public spectacle, 

a little salivating over ?s fortunes shouldn?t be considered in bad taste. Late 

lady P?s generosity towards her auditor has kept tongues wagging ever since the 

family drama unfolded. And fact that Mr has impressed first with his silence and 

then with his words, should be reason enough to start warming up to your lady 

boss at the next office party!

Fever pitch

Even if you are not such a sport, the least you can 

do is tune into some cricket action off the pitch. Good to spice things up on 

a bland evening with all the ingredients needed for a blockbuster: big money ($308 

million and counting), court cases and lots of behind-the-scenes drama. All for 

the right to show cricket matches featuring Team India in India. Just know the 

crux: Dalmiya ? dev to some, devil to others ? is the third umpire, always!

Village bound

Do you see dead people? If you don?t, at least have 

the sixth sense to decode the signs of the new M. Night Shyamalan film. With the 

Pondicherry-born maker leading us all into The Village and asking everyone 

to keep away from the surrounding woods, it?s time to talk scared again (so what 

if it?s in a multitudinous multiplex).

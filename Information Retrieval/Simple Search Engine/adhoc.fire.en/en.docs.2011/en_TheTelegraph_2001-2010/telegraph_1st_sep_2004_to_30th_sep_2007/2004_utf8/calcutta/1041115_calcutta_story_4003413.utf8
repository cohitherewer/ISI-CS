 Bad debts shed in biz overhaul 

 - Cable company clean-up

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The chime of change is ringing out loud through the cable industry. More so, at the local level. First, it was a 90-day cable deadline set by the state government in end-October for a cable clean-up.

 Now, RPG Netcom, the largest city multi-system operator (MSO), is set to go through some significant restructuring. Applying cosmetic changes first, RPG Netcom rechristened itself Indian Cablenet Limited with effect from November 1. Reasons cited included ?a growing national presence? and the fact that ?none of the RPG group companies carries the RPG tag?.

 The MSO, beaming to nearly half of all city cable television homes, now plans to shed ?around 30 to 40 per cent? of its subscriber base (roughly ?15 per cent of its market share?) by the year-end. 

 The reason: a clear word from the top to ?pull out from everything that is not remunerative?. That includes nearly 80 of the 200-odd cable operators that the MSO currently has in its fold.

 Initiating the project, notice was served in the past few weeks to 22 operators who owed the MSO huge dues. Service has been discontinued to some of them already.

 With repeated attempts at streamlining the industry not yielding results, the decision was firmed up by the MSO to let bad debts go. ?The policy for the MSO is clearly to make do with units that are paying up rather than be bogged down by numbers,? a source said.

 The RPG Netcom brass recently met its cable operators, who were informed that a list of around 120 operators has been drawn up. These are the ones the MSO plans to continue working with in future. 

 They were also told that the company is seeking greater cooperation and involvement from them. A steering committee will be formed, comprising operator representatives, that would govern some of the policy decisions the MSO undertakes.

 RPG Netcom officials also told cablemen of a proposal to test-run set-top boxes with value-added services. Around 50,000 boxes ?lying with the company since the doomed conditional access system (CAS) failed to take off ? will be offered to RPG Netcom subscribers on a first-come-first-served basis.

 For an additional Rs 130 a month, consumers can avail of five new channels ? including Hollywood Movies and Adventure One ? along with virtual classroom facilities (an RPG Netcom project scheduled post-CAS, where students would benefit from coaching over TV). Plans are on to start the service by next month.

 ?Certain business restructuring is being carried out,? was all that an RPG Netcom official would say. But there is no missing the market buzz. 

 Reaction to the developments has been mixed, with a section complaining about the ?high-handedness? of the MSO, and another welcoming the no-nonsense attitude.

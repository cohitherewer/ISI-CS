 Heckling halts milk supply 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Supply of milk from Belgachhia Central Dairy was disrupted on Tuesday after employees heckled additional milk commissioner Tushar Mukhopadhyay on Monday and brought operations to a standstill. 

 ?Two-thirds of the daily output was ready, but a section of employees did not let the loaded trucks leave the premises,? an official of the animal resources department said. 

 However, dairy top brass held out the assurance that supply would normalise on Wednesday.

 Central Dairy milk will be available next month in old polypacks of the West Bengal Dairy and Poultry Development Corporation (Dairpol) and will be marked Lassi, Slim Milk, Astha Milk or Manthan Milk, the officials said. 

 Production and distribution of milk from the dairy has been erratic since July because of sporadic supply of polypacks. ?The firm engaged to provide polypacks can only supply around 30 metric tonnes, though their contract requires them to supply 150 tonnes between July and September,? an official said. 

 Milk commissioner N.C. Majumdar said no inquiry had been initiated into Monday?s incident since no written complaint had been lodged. 

 ?It was a misunderstanding on part of the employees, who held their superiors responsible for the erratic supply of polypacks,? he said.

 However, officials said the heckling occurred because a section of dairy staff had been hauled up by their superiors for corrupt activities.The department had recently showcaused 110 employees for taking bank loans with forged documents.

 Impressions in nostalgia

 Artistic creativity is not merely a function of the artists own state of being. Inspired by his environment and milieu, the artist paints to articulate his view of life and society. The ongoing exhibition of paintings and drawings by Dipendranath Pal provides an insight into the way the artist interprets the evolving trends in a fast-changing social order. His works, though conspicuously modern in theme and style, are faintly but surely reminiscent of the impressionist paintings of the last century, revealing the artists hidden desire to hark back to the past. An almost bizarre combination of bold and subdued colours, where the solid starkness of a symbol of material power blends hazily into a muted background, clearly evokes a sense of detachment towards life?s transient attractions. Weakening of inter-personal relationships, the fear of losing oneself in a race for survival against anonymous contenders and a feeling of nostalgia for a time when material success did not matter, figure prominently in the paintings of this promising young artist, who seems to have a romantic fondness for all that is associated with the past.

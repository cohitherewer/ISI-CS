Talk 

about art

 Is fashion art? The seemingly simple question stirred up quite a storm at Crossword bookstore on Friday evening. Fashion designer Abhishek Dutta, artist Samir Aich and journalist Saborni Das debated on whether fashion should be included in the liberal arts section or be treated as just another profession.

 ?A sense of fashion, unlike music or painting, is not inborn. A child doesn?t know what fashion designing is, it has to be learnt,? said painter Samir Aich, clearly not ready to share his ?creative personality? tag with the fashion fraternity. 

?But doesn?t an artist market his paintings as a designer 

sells his clothes?? retorted Abhishek, the designer who conceptualised the panel 

discussion. Not ready to give up yet, the veteran painter promptly replied: ?Then 

he?s not an artist but a businessman using art to make money.?

 Even M.F. Husain found little favour with Aich as he proceeded to chide a young member of the audience when the teenager gave Husain?s example to point out how his paintings sell at a premium, which in turn boosts the ?value? of his work. 

 ?Only an artist can tell if another artist is really talented. There is no reason to judge an artist by the amount at which his paintings sell,? argued Aich. 

 As the conversation meandered from the basic difference between art and fashion to the academic differences between the two, Abhishek put forth his views articulately. ?I started designing my clothes without any investment, but to do a fashion designing course these days is expensive,? he said. 

 Saborni held forth on popular fashion versus designer wear.

 The little boutique tucked away on the first floor of a Behala address may not appeal to folks who swear by the brand they flaunt. 

 But if you have a keen eye for good handwork and innovative designs, Devali, which was formally opened only last week, might just be the right place to check out. 

 Situated off Ashoka cinema hall in Behala, the boutique is the brainchild of Sonali Das, who braved quite a few odds to come up with the venture. 

 ?It wasn?t easy as I had a family and little kids to take care of. But I managed to find time as designing is something very close to my heart,? said Sonali, who has quite a few innovative creations up her sleeve. Her batiks with sequin work on chiffon, or the acid painted floral designs for some cool options in eveningwear deserve special mention. Cotton saris with embellishments in tussar, or Sambalpuri cottons jazzed up with mirror and sequin work are some of the daywear choices from her stable. 

 Kantha saris and dupattas available off the rack have bright yet classy colour combinations and the handwork is elaborate and attractive.

 Though the boutique specialises in saris, salwar-kurtas are up for grabs as well.

 Some of the garments are priced as low as Rs 300 to Rs 600.

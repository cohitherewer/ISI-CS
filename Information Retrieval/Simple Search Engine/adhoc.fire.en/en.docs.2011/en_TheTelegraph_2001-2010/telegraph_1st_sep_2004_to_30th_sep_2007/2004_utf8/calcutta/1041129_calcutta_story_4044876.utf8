 English suburbia, Calcutta cluster

 - Low-height townhouses, with focus on landscaping and privacy, plus backyard and sunken garden

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Rose vine and crab-apple tree, Golden Shrubber and ivy bridge. Broccoli in the backyard and barbecue in the sunken garden, cut-outs and strip-forestation perimeter? Call it a slice of English suburbia, Toronto outskirts or turn-of-the-century Chicago, but it?s all in Action Area II, New Town Rajarhat.

 Construction of Calcutta?s ?first cluster of townhouses? is set to commence in January 2005, with targeted completion in 36 months. Each of the 13 townhouses, christened after trees like Maple and Oak, and with a captive elevator, will be made up of four duplex apartments. The cost of each duplex will work out to Rs 40-45 lakh.

 Developed by Bengal United Credit Belani Housing Ltd, a joint-sector company between United Credit Belani Group and West Bengal Housing Board, the townhouses are part of Hiland Woods, a multi-layered project designed by architect Dulal Mukherjee.

 ?It?s a dream solution, quite in the mould of the quaint London properties in the old quarters of Knightsbridge or Hammersmith, which can?t be conceptualised for congested downtown areas. The focus of the low-height townhouses will be on landscaping and privacy,? says Mukherjee.

 Nandu Belani, managing director of the joint-sector firm, adds: ?Every duplex, for all practical purposes a two-storey bungalow inter-linked through small cut-outs, will have its own private lawn, back garden and dedicated concealed parking slot, with access from the basement.?

 Following the European model, the front lawn will be minimal and the back gardens exhaustively done. There will be a four-metre forestation strip as natural boundary and the exposed-brick buildings peeping behind lush foliage will be girdled by a riot of colours in flowerbeds and rare trees. The semi-organic pattern of the sunken gardens will resemble terrace cultivation and spiral upward.

 ?All European hamlets near big cities and outlying districts have interesting mosaics of townhouses, but sadly Calcutta, despite its British legacy, has no such property. The Rajarhat project promises to plug that void,? Mukherjee observes.

 Owners of the exclusive townhouses will also have access to a ?distinguished? family club, housed in the adjacent 22-storey HIG (high-income group) tower. 

 To be located between the 19th and 22nd floors, the club ? with indoor sports, library-cum-lounge, health spa and wading pool ? will offer a ?stunning view? from the top.

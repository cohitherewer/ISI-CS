 Mother plea for bail denied

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

The Howrah vacation and sessions judge Kanchan Chatterjee on Wednesday rejected the bail petition of Piyali Das, one of the prime accused in the killing of gynaecologist Susil Pal on July 2. 

 Das? lawyer Asit Ganguly moved the bail plea on Wednesday afternoon pleading that Das? baby is in miserable condition. The child is falling ill from time to time, and the jail environment is not suitable for him. He pleaded that the mother be released for the sake of the baby. 

 ?The baby is falling ill and he needs a change of scene ? a homely atmosphere rather than the jail. Earlier, too, the baby had fallen ill and was admitted to hospital for treatment,? said Das? lawyer in court. 

 Previously, Das? bail petition was moved before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s (SDJM) court in October, but that time, too, the SDJM rejected her bail petition. 

 Gynaecologist Piyali Das, a resident medical officer of Bally Matrisadan, a hospital run by the Bally Municipality, was arrested at her residence in Entally on the night of October 10 as the police suspected that she was involved in the murder. 

 She was produced before SDJM, Howrah, Raja Chatterjee, the next day with serious charges like murder, suppression of facts and criminal conspiracy against her. She was accompanied to court by 12 other accused, including CPM zonal committee member, Biswajyoti Basu, who is also owner of Bally nursing home, on October 19.

 Earlier, CID officers had said that after a thorough investigation they had found documentary evidence against Piyali Das, who had conspired with Biswajyoti Basu to tamper with the attendance register at Sebayatan nursing home in Bally, where Pal had examined her, and also at Matrisadan. 

 The register was tampered with to establish that Das was present at Matrisadan and not at Sebayatan on the day of the murder. Das was then five months and 20 days pregnant. Even Basu was aware of it when he asked Sushil Pal to abort the child. After Pal refused to oblige, he, presumably, had to suffer the consequences. Later, she delivered the child at a Shyambazar nursing home. Pal?s body caked with mud was discovered in Saraswati Canal in Sankrail, Howrah, on July 3. 

 The SDJM, after releasing all the accused from police custody on October 19, had ordered them to be put in judicial custody till November 22. 

 The CID sleuths had prayed before the court that the 13 arrested persons, including Das, make confessional statements. But the CID was disheartened as all of them refused to oblige and pleaded with the magistrate that they be tried before the judicial officers pronounce any sentence.

 Though her bail petition was moved before court, Das was not brought before the magistrate on Wednesday.

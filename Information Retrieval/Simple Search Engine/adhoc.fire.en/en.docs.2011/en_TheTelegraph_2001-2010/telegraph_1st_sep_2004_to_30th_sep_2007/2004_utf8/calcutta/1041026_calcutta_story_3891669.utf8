The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

L-zone: Weaver Studio

First weaves

What better way to make a style statement than by 

using ingredients from the rich cultural heritage of India, especially Bengal. 

Weavers Studio does just that. Started by Darshan Shah in 1993, this design studio 

thrives on innovative techniques in weaving, printing and embroidery, all with 

natural dyes.

 At the same time, the studio supports women-oriented cooperatives engaged in weaving and embroidery by providing them with a commercial outlet for their efforts. More than a decade old, this south Calcutta organisation has an international presence in countries like Japan, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Germany. It has held numerous exhibitions in galleries abroad and registered its presence at international fairs like Pret-a-Porter (Paris), Interstoff (Germany), Texworld (Paris), Intertex (Milan) and the India Garment Fair (Osaka), taking its novelty, creativity and exclusive designs to the global market.

 ?Though it started off as a business, over the years our mission statement began to incorporate our commitment toward both craft and crafts people. Our constant value addition has been the fact that we use as many hands as possible. We intend to further experiment and ensure the creation of contemporary markets for value-added textiles,? says Darshan Shah.

Antiques attract

 Weavers Studio has three production units ? two for printing and one for weaving ? where it employs almost 300 artisans. Another 500 artisans are engaged for weaving, embroidery, surface ornamentation and tailoring. The studio has a collection of over 500 antique kantha, bandhni and baluchari saris and contemporary world textiles from Japan, Africa and Indonesia. The wide variety of scarves, traditional saris, salwar-kameezes dupattas, shirts, rugs and art textiles are critically admired and also fly off the rack in no time.

Motif mix

Blended and pure yarn are used by the label in the 

process of weaving, the results of which can be seen in the numerous products. 

Block printing, screen printing, spraying, hand printing and roller printing are 

the different types of techniques applied to create the exclusive look. Batik 

makes for popular items at the store. 

While dyeing the fabrics, shibori, a Japanese technique of tie-and-dye using natural indigo dye in combination with other dyes, is used to bring out intricate designs, colours and stitching. The hand-woven cotton khadi shirts, an image of comfort, style and affordability, make excellent gifts for men and women. These are all eco-friendly and bio-degradable.

 The hand-embroidered apparel use rich and subtle colours, delicate and stiff fabrics in breath-taking kalamkari, chikankari and kantha work. Patchwork and tribal embroidery are another specialty at this studio.

Off the shelf

 The in-house library at Weavers Studio houses over 1,000 textile books, 20,000 sample swatches and 300 or more representative textile forms from all over the world. Even art workshops are held at regular intervals to exchange views and help new ideas evolve. This also hopes to nurture awareness for textile design.

 The studio also conducts extensive studies in natural dyes, especially indigo, and research of trade textiles, their history and reproduction for revival and contemporary usage.

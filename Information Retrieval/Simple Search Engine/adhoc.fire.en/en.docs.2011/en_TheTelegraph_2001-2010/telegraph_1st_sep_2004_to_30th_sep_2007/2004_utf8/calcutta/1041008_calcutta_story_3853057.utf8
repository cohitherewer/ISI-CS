 Dance for the gods

 As a traditional art form, folk dances of Bengal have gained immense popularity and recognition over the years. Usually performed during festive seasons or to mark a happy occasion, these dances, ingrained in folk culture, reflect local faith, tradition and custom. In fact, some religious folk festivals are celebrated through the performance of some typical forms of songs and dances that characterise devotion, prayer and worship. Gambhira, a popular annual festival of Malda, comprises songs and dances closely related to agriculture and mythology. The performances depict on one hand, the success, failure, or annual production of crops, and on the other, tell stories about mythological figures. Depending on the theme, dancers perform in solo, duets or groups, stepping in tune with the beat of dhaks. This evening Sukla Chakraborty, accompanied by Molly Roy, embodies Gambhira in its ancient, archetypal form. Colourful masks, representing gods and goddesses like Kalika, Chamunda, Rama, Hanuman, Shiva and even animals and birds, promise to make the performance both charming and entertaining, while retaining the authenticity of this primitive dance form.

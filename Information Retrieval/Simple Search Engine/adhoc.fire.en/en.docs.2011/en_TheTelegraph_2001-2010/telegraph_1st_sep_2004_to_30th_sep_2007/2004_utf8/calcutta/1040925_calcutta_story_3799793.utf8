 Clamour in cathedral

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after Calcutta High Court granted anticipatory bail to Rev. P.S.P. Raju, Bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the Churches of North India (CNI), fresh trouble erupted on Friday at the triennial meet of the diocese council members. 

 Members of lobbies for and against the Bishop confronted each other, chanting slogans, shaking fists and waving placards in and outside St Paul?s Cathedral, where the meeting took place. 

 Members had gathered outside the cathedral from the morning to give vent to their feelings.

 On Wednesday, the Bishop had moved the high court, seeking anticipatory bail in connection with a case of alleged misappropriation of funds. 

 The area around Birla Planetarium, off St Paul?s Cathedral, was taken over by the agitators from 9 am on Friday, when the council meet started. 

 Visitors were denied entry to the cathedral all day as Section 144 was imposed on the premises, apprehending trouble during the meeting.

 While members of the anti-Bishop camp held rallies outside the cathedral demanding his removal, his supporters shouted slogans against diocese secretary Sailesh Mukherjee for his ?attempts to tarnish the image of the CNI? by bringing false charges against the Bishop. 

 Soon after the meeting, R. David, spokesperson for the CNI, said: ?Today?s meeting will continue till tomorrow and there was overwhelming support for the Bishop.? 

 He added: ?The council members feel that the name and spirit of the community was being unnecessarily sullied by a few individuals with vested interests, who are trying to further their own ends by making the Bishop a party to the controversy.? 

 The meeting in the cathedral hall was far from orderly. There were heated exchanges between the two sides. Members belonging to the anti-Bishop lobby started airing their grievances. 

 Some even walked out, saying the meeting should not have been held, as elections were pending to three of the 27 churches.

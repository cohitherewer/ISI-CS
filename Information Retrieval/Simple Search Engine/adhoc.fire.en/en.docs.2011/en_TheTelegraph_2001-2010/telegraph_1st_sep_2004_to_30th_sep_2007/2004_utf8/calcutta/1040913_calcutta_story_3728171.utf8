 Keeping Puja and politics in mind, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has set a dual deadline for the Parkomat on Lindsay Street.

 With Puja shopping gaining momentum and construction work restricting footfall in the New Market area, the CMC has set a September third-week deadline for Simplex Projects to clear the clutter on Lindsay Street, closed for work on the Parkomat for the past 17 months.

 Civic officials said mayor Subrata Mukherjee has made it clear to the promoters of the hi-tech parking plaza that the project has to be completed before June 2005. The construction company has agreed to this.

 The immediate task on hand is to create a wider passage for vehicular movement on Lindsay Street. At present, a narrow chaos corridor exists between the construction site and Globe cinema. This, said civic officials, would be widened before the Puja month arrives.

 ?As far as the completion date goes, there is tension in the air as the mayor is insisting that the project be completed before the next civic elections,? said a CMC official. He added that Mukherjee was ?very upset? with so many deadlines being missed on commissioning the project.

 The Lindsay Street Parkomat with a computer-driven elevator parking cars will provide parking space for 284 cars and will also house a 15,000 sq ft commercial complex.

 Simplex Projects was chosen to construct the facility on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. 

 The firm will manage the Parkomat and share five per cent of the gross revenue with the CMC for 20 years, before handing it over.

 Billed as his dream project, Mukherjee has grand plans to convert the area around Lindsay Street, New Market and Globe cinema into a pedestrian plaza dotted with trees, fountains, phone kiosks and cafes, besides the modern car-park facility before seeking re-election in June 2005. 

 But Simplex Projects, the civic body?s partner in building Parkomats in the city, has again deferred the commissioning of the Rs 23-crore project opposite New Market, this time by three months. This is the second time the firm has missed the deadline. 

 Nilangshu Bose, director-general (project and development), Simplex Projects, admitted that the deadline has been missed a number of times. ?Even the delayed commissioning in October 2004 has had to be deferred. Now, it is targeted for May 2005,? he said. 

 But the construction major has its own explanations. According to Arup Chaudhury, regional manager, work suffered to a great extent in March-April because of protests from local residents and traders.

 ?Even now, because of the protests, we are being forced to scale down the sheet-piling job from nine hours to four hours a day. It will not be possible for us complete the Parkomat before the first week of May, 2005,? Chaudhury added.

 Patient slits his throat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 45-year-old cancer patient grabbed a kitchen knife in a crowded ward on Monday morning and slit his throat inside a toilet at the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute.

 Radhakanta Sardar, admitted to bed no. 403 of the hospital?s emergency radiation ward on September 21, was suffering from cancer in an advanced stage and had, of late, slipped into depression. 

 Around 6 am, Sardar got hold of a knife from the adjacent bed and walked to the toilet. When nurses asked him where he was going, Sardar, father of a two-year-old child, said he wanted to relieve himself.

 He locked the toilet door and slit his throat with the knife. After 10 minutes, the ward boys realised that someone was crying out in agony. 

 ?We broke open the toilet door and found that the patient was bleeding profusely but was still alive,? said a senior official. 

 Sardar died soon afterwards and the authorities alerted the police. Around 7 am, police informed Sardar?s family at Dhakuria about the death.

 His family and residents of Gobindapur Railway Colony lodged a complaint with Bhowanipore police station, alleging negligence on the part of the hospital authorities. 

 When police decided to take the body for post-mortem around 2 pm, relatives went on the rampage and smashed some glass panes.

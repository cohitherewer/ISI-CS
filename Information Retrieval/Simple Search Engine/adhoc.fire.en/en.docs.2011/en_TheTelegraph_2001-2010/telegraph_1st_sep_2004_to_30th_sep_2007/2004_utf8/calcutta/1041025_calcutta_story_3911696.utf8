 Amidst all the revelry, it is the homes of many small-scale artisans of Kumartuli 

that will be immersed in darkness during the festive days and maybe for a few 

months to come. Many of them have incurred heavy losses because of the rain a 

few weeks before the Pujas. These families toiled tirelessly for the past six 

months to ready the clay idols. Meeting orders on time was a big challenge for 

them. All puja committees that have won various awards should come forward and 

openly acknowledge the contribution of these artisans. If possible, they should 

also share the prize money with them.

 Customers are often taken for a ride because of the faulty weighing scales 

used in most of the small shops in the city. The authorities should make it compulsory 

for sellers to use electronic weighing machines.

 Durga pujas in residential areas are increasingly becoming a costly affair. 

Puja organising committees are often splitting as a result of disputes amongst 

the area?s residents. Instead of patching up, two or more Pujas are being organised 

in a small area. Chances are that the number of Pujas will keep multiplying this 

way. This has another ill-effect ? the amount of subscription asked of an individual 

household goes up. It is high time residents of every locality put aside their 

petty differences and pool money to organise a single big community puja. After 

all, the festival is supposed to propagate friendship among neighbours.

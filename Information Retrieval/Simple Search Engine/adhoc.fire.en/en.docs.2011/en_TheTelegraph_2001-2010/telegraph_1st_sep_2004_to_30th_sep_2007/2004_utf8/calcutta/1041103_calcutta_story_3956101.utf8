 Varsity to rewrite exam rule

 The proposed change in rule holds out hope for students who have failed to clear the compulsory additional language papers in the Part I examinations this year. A Telegraph file picture

 Following strong protests by students and college principals after a large number of candidates failed to clear the compulsory English and Bengali papers in the BA and B.Sc Part I examinations, the Calcutta University authorities are considering an amendment to the examination rule.

 The university is likely to abolish the rule which makes it mandatory for students appearing in BA and B.Sc Part I examinations to score pass marks in the language papers.

 Officials said an emergency meeting of the university?s undergraduate council has been called on November 9 to finalise the decision regarding abolition of the rule.

 ?After we announced the results of the 2004 BA and B.Sc Part I examinations on October 15, we were flooded with letters from students and college principals demanding a revision of the rules,? Suranjan Das, university pro vice chancellor (academic) said on Tuesday.

 He added: ?Scrutinising the complaints, we noticed that a large number of students who had scored very high marks ? even first class marks in honours subjects ? had failed the examination because they had failed to score pass marks in the compulsory additional language papers.? 

 Under the present system, these students will lose a year. They will have to clear the papers next year before becoming eligible for the Part II examinations the year after.

 However, if the council approves the change in the rules, they will be allowed to appear for the Part II examination in 2005.

 Under the proposed system, students will not be barred from appearing in the Part II examinations even if they fail in the compulsory additional language papers the previous year. 

 But along with taking the Part II examinations, they will have to sit for the language papers, too, during the Part I examinations. 

 ?The present system is wrong because majority of the students devote most of their time to studying the honours and elective papers and hardly get time to study the language papers. We welcome the university?s plans to revise the system,? said Priyanka Banerjee, who has failed in a compulsory additional language paper this year. 

 University officials attributed the drop in the pass percentage in the BA and B.Sc (honours and general) examinations this year to the dismal performance in the language papers. The pass percentages in the BA and B.Sc Part I honours examinations have dropped to 82.78 and 78.5 from 83.6 and 82.78 per cent last year.

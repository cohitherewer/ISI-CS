The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Endearing tradition, enduring ties

 Though I have stayed in Calcutta for a long stretch earlier this year for the shooting of Shri Bimal Mitra?s Sahib Biwi Gulam, I have never experienced the city during the Pujas. Just a mention of Calcutta brings back so many memories at one go? The Kalighat temple, which I visit every time I am in the city, some good friends I made during my stay and I miss them very much even now. And yes, mishti doi! That?s a great favourite and something I just couldn?t do without when I was there. Even now, I ensure that a niece of mine, who works with an airline, gets me lots of mishti doi each time she flies to Calcutta.

 My first brush with the fanfare associated with Durga puja was in Mumbai. Here, a couple of my Bengali friends organise pujas. One among them is singer Abhijeet, who hosts a huge puja every year. I have been to his place a couple of times with friends for a darshan or anjali. But it has always been a private visit, not the kind of pandal-hopping several celebrities in Mumbai do for a fee. I just can?t think of attending a puja and taking money for it? 

 Rather than real life, it?s the celluloid and TV through which I can associate myself with this festival. In Daman, directed by Kalpana Lajmi, we had a scene on sindoorkhela and the Durga being immersed, which was symbolically linked with my role. But it was during the shooting of Sahib Biwi Gulam that I actually got a hang of the elaborate rituals. We had a full Durga puja sequence in the serial, where the ladies cover Durga?s face with paan leaves. In fact, working in this serial opened up a window to the tradition and culture of Bengal.

 I was very happy last Friday when the Lycra MTV Style Awards crowned me the most stylish woman on television for Sahib Biwi Gulam. The credit, I think, goes entirely to the richness of Bengali style and culture? The heavy saris with zari borders, the traditional jewellery, tilak and sankha-sindoor made the whole look so appealing that it stood out from the variety of western wear.

Back in Mumbai, the one festival I used to wait for 

eagerly till a few years ago was Holi. It was a whole lot of fun and craziness 

then, but now it?s rowdy outside and has lost much of its charm. I rather prefer 

staying back in our apartment where all of us take part in the festivity with 

a DJ playing the music. I now look forward to Diwali, which usually falls on my 

birthday, that is the 26th of October. So, it becomes a double celebration for 

me and my family!

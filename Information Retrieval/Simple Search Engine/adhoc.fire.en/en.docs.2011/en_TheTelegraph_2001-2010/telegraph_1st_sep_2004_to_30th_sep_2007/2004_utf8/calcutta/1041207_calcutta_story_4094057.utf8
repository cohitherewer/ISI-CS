The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A blast of jazz, and more

 - Congo 

square brings heady mix on dalhousie green 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Hellborg will be back with his magic bass

 The heady rhythms of ?frevo?, ?baiao? and bossa nova from Brazil, avant-garde jazz and 12-tone music from Germany, Indo-jazz fusion from US-based South Asian diaspora and the unusual chords and ?unbelievable control of space? of fretboard sultan Steve Topping? The Kolkata JazzFest 2005 (January 20-23) on the Dalhousie Institute lawns promises to be a blast and more.

 Congo Square, a registered non-profit society, which revived the city?s annual pilgrimage to jazz, blues and fusion music last year through a four-day international festival of world music, is back with an eclectic set this winter, featuring a Brazilian ensemble ?for the first time? in the city JazzFest.

 Steve Topping will be filling in for guitar guru Allan Holdsworth, who has cried off citing clash of dates with a major gig, Congo Square spokesperson Ashok Banerjee informed Metro on Monday. Topping will team up with Swedish bass virtuoso Jonas Hellborg ? artistic director for the last edition and an advisor this time ? and multi-instrumentalist Gary Husband, who has performed with the likes of Jack Bruce, Billy Cobham and Andy Summers.

 Mandu Sarara, the Brazilian quintet, ?aims at preservation and dissemination of Brazilian popular music of authentic cultural value?. With influences from composers like Antonio Carlos Jobim and Hermeto Pascoal, the group adds to the vigour of Brazilian rhythms ?a diversity of musical instruments?.

 Der Rote Bereich from Germany, Indo-German fusion band Mito and the Sunny Jain Collective from the US complete the overseas line-up confirmed till date. Negotiations are on with a few other outfits, including ?a jazz heavyweight?, to plug the other two slots.

 Indian participation in the fest, supported by Vision Comptech, will be in the form of HFT, with Arjun Sen on guitar and Lew Hilt on bass providing the home-grown flavour and Bhuvan Sachdeva on drums weaving a collage of jazz, rock, folk, Indian classical and blues. ?The Sunny Jain Collective (with Jain on drums, Rez Abbasi on guitar/sitar guitar, Gary Wang on acoustic bass and Steve Welsh on tenor sax/effects) is another interesting soundscape worth waiting for,? said Banerjee. The US-based group ?takes up Bollywood tunes and jazzes them up?.

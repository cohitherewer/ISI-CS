The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Batsman bowled by light bite

A sunbathed Kali puja morning proved to be a busy 

one for Hangout, the Food Court at City Centre. After Samsung?s favourite Team 

India members evacuated the Salt Lake mall, the action shifted to the third-level 

arena with faces ?from home and away ? dropping by for a mid-day meal. Zaheer 

Abbas, former Pakistan cricket captain, who will be feted at Eden Gardens on Saturday, 

had a relaxed lunch with old friends Kishore and Rita Bhimani and Vineet Verma, 

CEO, City Centre.

?I love having the vegetarian food in Calcutta,? he 

smiled, passing up kebabs to dig into a plate of crispy Chinese Bhel.

Spicy strike

The bright, glass-walled eatery lent the perfect ambience 

for a spirited conversation, starting with the fabulous Green Curry from the Just 

Desserts counter, moving on to Pakistani players trying to get under young Sachin?s 

skin as he took strike, Karachi?s hospitality legend and the stunning street food 

of Lahore.

On the final point, the Karachi-based legend was particularly 

vehement. Life without a taste of such sumptuous eats was quite incomplete (?You 

haven?t seen anything yet?).

A taste of the Ra-Ra Mutton from Kwality was enough 

to turn the conversation back to Calcutta, and how it goes ga-ga over cricket. 

The stylish batsman who last played on the Calcutta pitch in 1983 is ?looking 

forward to watching the match in a city with a great knowledge of cricket?.

While he is looking forward to Saturday?s match, Abbas 

also watched the India-Australia series with interest. ?Australia is the world?s 

best team and it?s no joke to beat them,? observed the cigar-smoking cricket great.

Savour shops

Mainland China?s Anjan Chatterjee (whose new restaurant 

brand China China is opening shortly at the mall) and adman Ram Ray also chose 

Thursday afternoon to check out the fare at the recently-opened destination. Hangout 

was awash with colour, abuzz with excitement, not just because of the star in 

its midst. It has caught on with shoppers, according to Verma. Last Sunday, for 

instance, over 3,000 hungry mouths were fed, leaving counters empty well before 

closing.

With food far superior to the standard fare at such 

outlets, there is substance to sustain its popularity. Apart from the Kwality 

and Just Desserts outlets, there is Dakshini, Stun the Sun and Bombay Shiv Sagar, 

with Bengali and Rajasthani counters lined up.

The food court also scores with its seating arrangements. 

Finally, Calcutta has a place for those in search of an open-air eating experience, 

just in time for winter. 

And those who prefer to stay sheltered from the sun 

won?t miss out on the fun either. Even the enclosed, air-conditioned area is bright, 

cosy and captures just enough outdoor feel.

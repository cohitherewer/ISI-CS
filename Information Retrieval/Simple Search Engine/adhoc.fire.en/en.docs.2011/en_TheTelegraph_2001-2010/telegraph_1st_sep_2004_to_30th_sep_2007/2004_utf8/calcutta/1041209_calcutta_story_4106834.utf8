The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scream of the lambs

 What do you get when you bring together an advertising guru, an actress known more for cricket, a young director, and a snazzy, upmarket channel just born? You get Bali.

 December 10 will showcase Prahlad Kakkar?s first foray into cinema with this 75-minute film to be aired on STAR One. Produced by Kakkar?s ad agency Genesis, the film has been directed by newcomer Shujaat Saudagar (also Kakkar?s co-worker at Genesis) and stars Mandira Bedi (in a still from the film above) with Ram Kapoor (a TV actor who had a bit role in Monsoon Wedding).

 The film is based on Roald Dahl?s short story Lamb to the slaughter (thus Bali ? sacrifice). ?But while adapting it for television I had to make several changes,? says Shujaat. ?The original story is about one evening, but my film stretches for a week.?

 Prithvi, a senior police officer, is caught between his pregnant wife Anchal (Mandira) who he doesn?t love anymore and Tanya, an attractive woman who has just come into his life. To add to his list of worries, Bali, a serial killer Prithvi had shot, is on the run. The film follows the parallel tracks till Prithvi?s body is found by his wife in their house. Then the hunt for the killer begins.

 ?It?s the first long-length film Genesis has done,? offers Shujaat. ?And we did it to prove a point. The budget wasn?t big, it was shot entirely in Mumbai and Mandira and Ram worked for free.? But why debut with a ?dark? film? ?I always wanted to do a macabre film with lots of blood and gore, and this provided the opportunity,? explains the 31-year-old.

 The screenplay took three months to write (?a looooong time?) and production had to be just perfect. ?We shot the film with a handheld camera and the screenplay structure is quite interesting, there?s a lot of back and forth in time.?

 Mandira compares the editing style with Quentin Tarantino?s Pulp Fiction. ?The first few minutes, you are completely lost,? she says. ?Then, slowly, it all starts clearing up.?

 Working with Mandira is not a first for Shujaat. He is the man behind the ?Mandira in the rain? promo for the Champions Trophy as well as the one for World Cup cricket, both on MAX. ?Mandira is a great director?s actress whose talent has been largely untapped,? is Shujaat?s verdict on cricket?s first lady on TV, who shot to fame with the soap Shanti.

 Mandira is just as full of praise for the ?young, talented and very promising? director. ?Like the ad campaigns, he has taken this film to another level as well,? is Mandira?s stamp on Shujaat. 

 Bali premieres on December 10 at 11 pm on STAR One. The slot has already featured films from first-time directors, like Nitin Kaker?s Pehchaan and Veena Bakshi?s Na Na Karte.

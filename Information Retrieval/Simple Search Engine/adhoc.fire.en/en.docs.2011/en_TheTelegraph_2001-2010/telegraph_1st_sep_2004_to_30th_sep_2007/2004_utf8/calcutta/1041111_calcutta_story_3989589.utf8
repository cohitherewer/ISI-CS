The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sporty touch, youthful style

The 

Indian consumer has plenty to choose from when it comes to formal wear, feels 

designer Abhishek Dutta. 

 His new Pret line, titled Adnormal, is his solution to the rest. It caters to all kinds of customers, from a 15- year-old to a 35-year-old. The collection includes tops, trousers, shirts, jackets and skirts at a rather affordable price. 

 According to Dutta, the inspiration comes from the sporty attitude of the youth. ?Everything about the new line is young and happy,? he smiles.

 There is a great deal of stitch detailing. He also experiments liberally with fabric, using various treatments, prints and simple machine stitches.

His signature ? leather trimmings ? also surfaces 

here, in the form of leather patchwork, belts and sashes. These add to the funky, 

hip effect.

 To complete the look, Dutta has also come out with a wide range of accessories in the form of bags, caps and gloves. The prices range from Rs 1,500 to Rs 8,000. 

 Dutta has also renovated his studio along the lines of a Formula One racing track with a hint of the vintage.

Trendy tresses

 Sunsilk?s award-winning salon Satin Rose, in Salt Lake, is all set to pamper the women of the township. 

 The spacious beauty station offers bridal make-up packages, hair treatments and special facials, apart from the usual treatments.

 With the Diwali rush on, beautician and owner Jolly Chanda went a step further on Tuesday to style model Pinky?s hair to give her the winter look.

 ?I have created the style keeping in mind that during the party season, women prefer to don western outfits,? explained the proprietor. 

 Pinky?s black curly hair was first straightened and then cut and styled in asymmetrical layers and bangs. 

 ?Since black is a strong colour that can not be easily removed, I used L?Oreal Magimesh blonde to help achieve another colour without pre-lightening her hair (removing the old colour),? Jolly added. 

 Random streaks of Magicontrast magenta red create a vibrant effect. ?With the top layers flush with colour, we couldn?t leave the insides of the hair bland. So I went for very bright magenta for the underground colouring (dyeing the inside strands),? she signed off.

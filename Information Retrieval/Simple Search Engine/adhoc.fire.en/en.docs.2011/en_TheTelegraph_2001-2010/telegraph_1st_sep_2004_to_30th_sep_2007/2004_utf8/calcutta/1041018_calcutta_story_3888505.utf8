The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 With reforms taking the frontline, the government is all 

 for teaching English in the primary schools. But why do 

 many city buses have the names of places displayed in Bengali 

 only? Hordes of tourists visit Calcutta, especially during 

 the festive season. Shouldn?t we make travelling easier 

 for them by displaying the details on the buses in English 

 also. This way, instead of seeking help from people on the 

 roads, these outsiders can be a little self-reliant while 

 travelling in the city. The better their stay, the more 

 the chances of pushing the state as a tourist destination. 

 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge. 

 Many government-sanctioned online lotteries have been closed 

 down on the plea that they are detrimental to society, especially 

 to the lower-middle class. If that be the reason, why not 

 close down the country liquor shops as well? They are also 

 frequented by people from lower-middle class. Probably, 

 some organisations/political parties intend to carry on 

 extorting huge sums to allow them to run. 

 Md. Moinuddin, Ballygunge. 

 We generally tend to focus on the weaknesses of a civic 

 body but ignore the brighter side. In this context, it is 

 pertinent to point out that despite the loopholes in its 

 functioning, the Corporation has performed admirably well 

 in the supply of drinking water. Amherst Street and its 

 adjoining areas have been suffering for want of drinking 

 water for the past two decades. But the supply has appreciably 

 increased in the recent times. Kudos to the CMC for changing 

 the scenario. 

 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flurry of pleas in township plot case

 OUR BUREAU

 The Legal Aid Forum will file a revision petition with the Supreme Court on Wednesday, asking for a review of an order relating to the distribution of plots in Salt Lake from the chief minister?s quota.

 Forum spokesman Jaydeep Mukherjee said on Monday a division bench of the apex court had deviated from the grounds of the case while holding Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee guilty of wresting undue favours from the state government. Banerjee, a former judge of Calcutta High Court, was not the target of the petitioners, the forum spokesman argued.

 The bench, while disposing of two petitions alleging that the authorities had deviated from the Salt Lake master plan while distributing plots, had observed that Banerjee had ?an unholy nexus with the government?. 

 The court had criticised the former judge for obtaining a plot from the chief minister?s quota in 1987 and directed him to vacate the plot within a year. 

 Describing the judgment as ?more emotional than subjective?, forum members said petitioners Tarak Singh and Dipak Ghosh had only challenged the legality of altering the master plan. 

 The forum feels the matter should be dealt with by a higher bench of the Supreme Court. 

 ?The judges, instead of applying their minds to the main allegation, had made the land distribution matter the subject of dispute,? spokesman Mukherjee said. 

 Sunita Prova Rao, a cousin of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and an assistant secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Association, will be the advocate on record of the revision petition, Mukherjee added.

 The two petitioners of the original case, Singh and Ghosh, have already declared that they will move the apex court through revision petitions, seeking penal action against Jyoti Basu, during whose tenure Banerjee was allotted the plot. 

 Another revision petition will be filed by Justice Banerjee?s lawyer, asking for a modification of the order. 

 Given that all parties to the case are moving the Supreme Court with revision petitions, it seems the state government, the main respondent of the case, will be left with no option but to move the court for a review of the judgment.

On a par with the best

 These awards aren?t about competition. At least not with others. The International Award for Young People (IAYP), previously known as the Duke of Edinburgh Awards, is about furthering one?s own abilities. 

 On Sunday evening, 54 youngsters from eight schools collected their badges, determined to better themselves further.

 Among the young people constantly striving to improve their skills were the likes of Shabana Khatun, a confident young lady from an under-privileged background, and Pradip Sikdar, a student of Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys? Academy.

 The East Zone Awards Authority encompasses West Bengal, Bihar, Assam and Orissa, with 37 school units and about 6,500 participants, 1,180 of them active. 

 The awards scheme, active in 112 countries, is conducted in four areas ? skill (the arts), physical recreation (sports), social service and expedition ? and in three stages ? bronze, silver and gold. Youngsters between 14 and 25 can participate in the scheme.

 Sunday was the turn of Calcutta students to receive their awards. Around 11 schools are part of the special project in Calcutta under the IAYP scheme. So, receiving the awards alongside La Martiniere, Birla High School, Apeejay School, Modern High School and Sharada Math was Emmanuel Ministries. 

 As part of the colourful cultural programme before the awards were handed out, each school put up a presentation, as did girls from the Bustee Welfare centre with a dandia and the boys from Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys? Academy, who entered the programme two years ago. 

 As Pradip put it: ?It has made us more confident and aware, and given us more energy and the chance to realise our potential.?

 For students like Pradip and Shabana, taking part in the scheme and keeping up with the others is sometimes a struggle against odds. The IAYP authorities have to help by providing trainers for sports dance and music. 

 At other times, special training and guidance has to be given, like to the blind boys, before they depart on a trekking expedition. 

 But handicapped or under-privileged, they all do everything required of them. As David Manson, secretary-general, Duke of Edinburgh?s Award International Association, said: ?Every person who wears the badge in any part of the world is on a par with the others in every way.?

 On his first IAYP-related trip to Calcutta ? although he lived here for two years, seven years ago ? Manson spent two days visiting schools and talking to students ?to collect enough memories to convince very official people in clinical offices back home to keep supporting the scheme?.

 Of the three gold winners, Angana Roy Chowdhury, an ex-South Point student, will be travelling to Hong Kong soon, for the once-in-three-years International Gold Event, where gold-winners from around the world meet and share their experiences.

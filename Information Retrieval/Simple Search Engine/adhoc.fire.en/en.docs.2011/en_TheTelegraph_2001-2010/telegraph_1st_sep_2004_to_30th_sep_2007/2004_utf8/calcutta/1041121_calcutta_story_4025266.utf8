 The wrap-up party for the 10th 

 Kolkata Film Festival, hosted by Patton chief Sanjay Budhia 

 and wife Minu, was an event destined to be talked about 

 for some time to come. ?It was like a party at the White 

 House,? gushed an excited guest on Wednesday evening. The 

 elaborate arrangements at the Sunderbans, the sprawling 

 dew-kissed greens at the ITC Sonar Bangla, may not have 

 been presidential, but certainly were a class apart.

 From a city nightclub, where Budhia 

 has in the past hosted festival parties, this was a huge 

 leap. For those on the regular guest list, the ITC affair 

 was a pleasant surprise.

 With two well-stocked bars, cushioned 

 sofas positioned at comfortable intervals across the greens, 

 white table-clothed round tables for dinner, a dance floor 

 and a large patch of grass left uninterrupted for those 

 in the mood for an evening stroll ? the shimmering backdrop 

 was set for a touch of magic.

 So, while Sunil Gangopadhyay chatted 

 with Jogen Chowdhury on a sofa at one end, at the other 

 side of the venue, actresses Rupa Ganguly and Debashree 

 Roy hotted up the dance floor with their moves. US consul 

 general George Sibley and wife Lee Alison preferred a quiet 

 dinner with Speaker Somnath Chatterjee. Even Governor Viren 

 J. Shah spent a fair amount of time at the event. ITC chairman 

 Y.C. Deveshwar zoomed straight in from the airport to attend 

 the bash.

 The guest list included, among 

 many others, Soumitra Chatterjee, Mrinal Sen, Aparna Sen 

 and daughter Konkona, Goutam Ghose, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, 

 Arindam Sil, Anamika Khanna, the consul generals of Italy, 

 Myanmar, Germany, Japan and Bangladesh, top cops and senior 

 bureaucrats.

 The food was strictly vegetarian, 

 with options aplenty from two Indian restaurants at the 

 hotel ? Dum Pukht and Peshawri. From spicy idlis 

 to Sarson Ka Saag and Subz Gehloti Kebab ? the spread of 

 100-odd specialities kept the guests busy for a large part 

 of the evening.

 The entertainment of the night 

 came from an impromptu performance by Usha Uthup and a visit 

 by Bappi Lahiri. As the clock ticked past midnight, the 

 spirits rose higher and the sounds of laughter grew ? Calcutta?s 

 way of rubbishing the 24-hour bandh and turning out to socialise 

 in style.

 True to its name, the Connoisseurs? 

 Evening at the Oberoi Grand on Thursday was an event for 

 lovers of the good life. Free flowing wine of various kinds, 

 an elaborate spread of Awadhi cuisine, music by Usha Uthup 

 and a crowd comprising the city?s cr?me de la cr?me ? the 

 classy do was truly an epicure?s delight.

 Organised by Grover Vineyards 

 of Bangalore, the occasion was the wine maker?s sit-down 

 dinner for 70 select members of the city?s glitterati. The 

 guest list included Russi Modi, George Sibley and wife Lee 

 Alison, Augustino Pinna, Konkona Sen Sharma, Bikram Ghosh 

 and wife Jaya Seal Ghosh, Bani Laxman Singh and Rupen Roy.

 The highlight of the evening was 

 the menu. The guests were greeted with Deluxe Canap?s with 

 Shiraz Rose prior to the dinner. Authentic Awadhi food was 

 lined up for dinner, served with three kinds of wine, which 

 got stronger with each course. So, one got a taste of Viognier 

 Clairette, a white wine, with starters like Gosht Gilawat 

 Kebab, Kesariya Jhinga, Nawabi Tangdi, Tandoori Phoolgobi, 

 Paneer Multani Tikka and Rajmah Gilawat.

 Next on the chart was a serving 

 of Barf Ke Goley, a watermelon and black pepper sorbet, 

 as a palate cleanser. Dum Ki Macchi (baked bekti fillet 

 with almond and yoghurt) for non-vegetarians and Dum Ka 

 Khumb (baked mushroom with almond and yoghurt), served with 

 Sauvignon Blanc, another white wine. The next wine was red, 

 served with Tar Khorma (lamb braised in brown onion gravy 

 with Kashmiri chillis) or Shahi Paneer. The dinner was wrapped 

 up with a serving of Aam Ki Kulfi.

 Abhay Kewadkar, vice president, 

 Grover Vineyards, livened up proceedings with interesting 

 nuggets about wine. ?A wine maker?s dinner is an event where 

 a wine maker speaks about his wines. A particular variety 

 of wine, unlike most beverages, does not taste the same 

 when created by two different makers. The terroire ? 

 the identity of the wine owing to climate, soil, grape variety 

 and method of making ? differs with each maker,? he said.

 The menu for the evening was set 

 to break the myth that wine goes with Western foods only. 

 ?Wine goes well with any kind of fine cuisine,? he added. 

 While in international cuisine, white wine is served with 

 white meat and red wines with red, in Indian cuisine, the 

 pairing depends on the level of spice in the food. For instance, 

 a lightly-fried Calcutta bekti should ideally be had with 

 white wine, while a medium-spicy bekti tandoor goes 

 best with a rose and a spicy bekti curry is to be had with 

 red wine.

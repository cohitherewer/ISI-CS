Best of Bengal?s culinary alchemy

Serving clients flavours from their own 

traditional cuisine can be a tricky proposition, finds Madhumita Bhattacharyya

The alchemy of mashima?s kitchen is the inspiration 

for much that goes on at Oh! Calcutta. But in many cases, this is just the catalyst 

for creative culinary twists to the Bengali cuisine we have grown up on.

When all things Calcutta became the credo of this 

restaurant, a wealth of history came with it, and a host of stakeholders, too. 

As long as every Bengali household has the perfect recipe for Chingri Malai 

Curry, no store?s impostor version can really match up. As long as every Calcuttan 

dines on Park Street once a fortnight, Chicken Strog-anoff must taste and look 

just so. Mess with it at your own risk.

Such resistance need not mark the demise of a culinary 

quest to capture the flavours that have seeped through the city over 300 years 

and beyond. But as this restaurant found out, it does make it a little more challenging.

Taste test

While on the subject of Stroganoff, the Oh! Calcutta 

experience has been worth noting. 

?We chose a recipe that was close to the authentic 

one, with certain Anglo-Indian accents,? explains chef Joymalya Banerjee of the 

fourth-floor restaurant at Forum. The Russian combination of chicken and rice 

? usually made with beef or veal in its place of origin ? came to the city, explains 

Banerjee, possibly through the Firpo?s chef, who was Russian himself. The same 

goes for Chicken a la Kiev.

The Calcutta clientele has grown up on a Stroganoff 

that had evolved into a slightly creamy, whiter sauce than the one served up at 

Oh! Calcutta. However, after running it through the taste test, the chefs stood 

by their version.

Was there a glimmer of doubt about what was being 

put on the table? Far, far from it. 

?We pay close attention to what our guests suggest,? 

says Banerjee. Every diner with a suggestion is not only heard, but put through 

the litmus test. The dish is made with the recipe suggested. If it is really better, 

a modification is made. If the powers-that-be prefer the Oh! Calcutta original, 

it stands unchanged.

Steam stir

The healthy side of the cuisine is currently on display, 

with a bhapa festival, that goes well beyond the standard paturi. 

?Everything is rooted in Bengali flavours,? explains the chef. So a chicken kebab 

may not be readily associated with traditional cooking, but a bite into the succulent 

meatball reveals the delicate flavour of aamada. Bhapa Dhonepata Machh, 

bekti steamed in a fresh coriander sauce tastes surprisingly like a machher 

jhol though it also has Parsi roots.

A regular part of the menu makes the most of steamed 

Kolkata Bekti. Gandharaj Machh is one of the most popular starters at the eatery. 

The creation was inspired by owner Anjan Chatterjee?s desire to capture the unique 

flavour of gandharaj lebu. The result is an exquisitely aromatic, tender 

fish fillet, with a tangy yoghurt-based sauce infused with lemon juice and rind. 

This kind of cooking ? light on the stomach but not 

necessarily on the palate ? has a growing fan following.

Often innovations are in the presentation. Bhapa Shorshe 

Narkol Chingri is made from finely-minced prawn with a whole prawn embedded in 

it, all steamed together to resemble a Continental starter with decidedly Bengali 

taste. 

Men at work

With around 300 covers being catered to a day, the 

kitchen is carefully segregated to avoid chaos. The Bengali section is the largest, 

owing to its dominance in the menu. The Continental, Indian, and tandoori 

segments are also sizeable. Around 20 hands are generally required.

The morning starts with curries and dal being 

made. The restaurant has even created a customised kadhai. The metal handle 

is vacuumised to prevent it from heating up. To use the usual tongs when the kitchen 

is in full swing can be dangerous.

?The East India gourmets, longing for the familiar 

tastes of home but handicapped by unfamiliar ingredients, harnessed the inventive 

powers of local bawarchees...? writes Chatterjee in a prologue to the menu. 

It is that tradition which continues.

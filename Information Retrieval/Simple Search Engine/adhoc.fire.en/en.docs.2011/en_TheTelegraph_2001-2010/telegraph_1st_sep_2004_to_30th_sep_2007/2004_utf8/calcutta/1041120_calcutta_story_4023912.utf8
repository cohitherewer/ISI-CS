 A trans-literary experience

 The hallmark of all great art is that it lends itself to multiple levels of meaning, allowing the viewer to interpret a work according to his own understanding and perception. Ranan?s production of Girish Karnad?s Naga-Mandala takes this facet of the arts to a totally different plane by exploring the effects of overlapping and fusing various literary, dramatic and practising art forms. Weaving together two Kannada folk tales, the original play addresses on a basic level the themes and problems raised within these two stories. Dramatic representation of the plot through classical Kathak and Odissi dance adds a new and complex dimension to the play, resulting in a unique performance that wonderfully merges the style and rhetoric of literature and the performing arts. Directed by Vikram Iyengar, the dance-theatre constantly encounters, challenges and reworks the conventional modes of dramatic presentation, in the process helping the audience uncover layers of alternative meaning within the same narrative.

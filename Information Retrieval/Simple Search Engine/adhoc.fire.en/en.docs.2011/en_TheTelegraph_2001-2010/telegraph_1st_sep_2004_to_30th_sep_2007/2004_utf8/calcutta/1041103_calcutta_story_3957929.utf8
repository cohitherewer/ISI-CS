 Jewellery haul in dawn dacoity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two days after a promoter and his henchmen raided a house in Salt Lake and severely beat up the residents, dacoits invaded another house in the township on Tuesday morning and decamped with jewellery and other valuables.

 This time, the target was EC block, close to City Centre. Ten armed men entered the house of the Agarwals at EC 38 around 6.20 am. Rajesh Agarwal, who owns a plastic-manufacturing unit on Jessore Road, was sleeping with his two-and-a-half-year-old son Visharat. 

 His mother Shakuntala had gone out for a walk, while his wife Punam was out on the main road to put their six-and-a-half-year-old daughter Avantika in the school bus. Rajesh?s brother Rajendra and his wife Shilpa were sleeping in their room.

 ?The maid and the servant, too, were asleep when the men entered our house. They overpowered the durwan and came inside,? said Rajesh. When he came out of his room, he suddenly came face-to-face with the dacoits.

 ?They pointed a gun at me and snatched my gold chain,? said Rajesh. At 6.30 am, Punam returned home. The dacoits took away all her jewellery and tied her up with a rope. They threatened to explode bombs and told Rajesh to hand over the cash. ?We did not have much cash at home. So they asked me to show them the locker,? he added.

 As the dacoits were busy opening the locker and taking out the jewellery, Rajesh called his brother on the cell phone and told him about the dacoits in whispers. But his brother panicked, and when he came out of his room, the dacoits caught hold of him and yanked off his gold chain. 

 As they tried to get into his room, his wife slammed the door and bolted it from inside. The gang panicked and ran off, carrying jewellery worth more than Rs 3.5 lakh, expensive wristwatches and shoes. 

 According to the family members, the dacoits were conversing in Hindi. A team of policemen from Bidhannagar (North) police station visited the house. 

 Block residents panicked when they learnt of the dacoity. ?We feel unsafe. The Agarwals have a guard. Yet the dacoits overpowered them,? said Pabitramoy Sengupta, a resident of EC block.

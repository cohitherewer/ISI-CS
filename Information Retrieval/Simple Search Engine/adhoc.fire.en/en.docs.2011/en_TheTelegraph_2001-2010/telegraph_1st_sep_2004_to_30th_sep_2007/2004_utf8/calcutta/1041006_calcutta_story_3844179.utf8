 Malaria toll war hots up

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND KINSUK BASU

 Mamata Banerjee?s Trinamul Congress, running the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), and the Left in the civic Opposition are trading charges over the recent malignant malaria deaths, now that the civic polls aren?t too far away.

 The CPM and other Left parties have unleashed a campaign holding the CMC and, to an extent, mayor Subrata Mukherjee responsible for what they claim are nine deaths due to malaria in the past three months. 

 Mayor Mukherjee puts the toll at five. The figure, he claims, was inflated to gain political mileage. This number game is being played as doctors in city hospitals stress that malaria cases are alarmingly on the rise. 

 ?With the civic polls round the corner, the Opposition will surely try to make an issue of malaria,? Mukherjee said. He held a meeting with health officials on Tuesday in the presence of municipal commissioner Debasish Som and mayor-in-council member (health) Pradip Ghosh. 

 To counter the Opposition charge, Mukherjee ordered the immediate deployment of five more mobile clinics, and asked the health clinics run by the civic body to work through the week. There are 86 malaria clinics under the CMC, and of these, the 24 located in the malaria-prone zones will remain open between 8 am and 2 pm every day, till November. 

 Tuesday?s meeting follows the Opposition leader Nirmal Mukherjee?s claims that while two people died in August, five died between September 24 and October 2. As if this was not enough, mayor-in-council (slum improvement) Javed Ahmed Khan claimed that two people died of malaria at Sapgachhi and GJ Khan Road.

 Without paying any heed to such claims and counter-claims, doctors attending the outdoor clinics of almost all government hospitals observed that malaria cases have shot up like never before. 

 At Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, for instance, health officials believe that this time, the number could well be more than twice that of last year. ?Against six cases in July last year, the corresponding figure for this year stood at 17,? said Sukumar Das, superintendent of the hospital.

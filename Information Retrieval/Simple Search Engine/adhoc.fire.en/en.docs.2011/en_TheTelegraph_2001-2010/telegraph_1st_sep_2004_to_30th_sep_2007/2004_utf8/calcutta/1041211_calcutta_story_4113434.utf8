The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Suspect?s house burnt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A mob set fire to the house of Akhtar Sheikh at Akra Fatak in Rabindra Nagar on the southern fringes of the city early on Friday for allegedly murdering Ganesh Mahato, a local realtor, on Thursday night. The residents were furious as they had handed over Akhtar to the police but he was let off after interrogation. 

 A police force, including Rapid Action Force personnel, was deployed. On Friday, all shops and educational institutions were closed in protest. 

 On Thursday night, Ganesh was at a tea stall when Akhtar shot him from a close range. He breathed his last at hospital. District superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said Mahato might be killed because of business rivalry. They were partners earlier but had fallen out recently. A search is on for him, he added.

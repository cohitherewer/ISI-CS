 Patches of purple peeping out from most collections established the colour story of the season. Just as glimpses from the lines of the country?s top names in couture established the fashion story at large at The Stylefile Winter Show 2004. Pointers to what is going to rule the fashion frontier were aplenty on Saturday, when the city?s biggest fashion show hit the Hyatt Regency ramp. Now, welcome the chill in style.

 It was the place to be seen, despite the high-profile Mittal party and various other engagements that dotted the town?s social register. So, hardly a name on the people-who-matter list gave the prestigious event a miss. Calcuttans and temporary residents alike made a beeline for the packed venue, as Sumedha Saraogi and Preeti and Sanjeev Goenka played the part of hosts to perfection. The Neotias, Budhias, Bhimanis, Kumars (Sunita and Naresh), Anjana Shah, Anoushka Shankar, Arjun Atwal, Nilanjanaa and Jishu Sengupta, Prosenjit Chatterjee, Debasree Roy, Koel Mallick, Bikram Ghosh, Jogen Choudhury, Suvaprasanna, Shamlu Dudeja were just a few of the faces spotted in the 1,400-strong crowd.

 While the invitation card requested the guests to be seated by 6.45 pm, there were long queues outside the door from a little after 6 pm ? almost unheard of in this laid-back city. By the time the audience settled down, the collective anticipation had reached a fever pitch.

 The show started off with Anamika Khanna?s sequence, where models walked the ramp to These are a few of my favourite things and Doe a deer? Lots of texturing and layering went in to make the contemporary silhouette, like long jackets, skirts, tight pants and long kurtas.

 Next came Delhi-based designer Varun Bahl?s range of western wear, with an emphasis on skirts. Subdued colours like beige and various shades of brown gave way to brighter purples and greens. 

 Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna of H2O and Cue started off with browns and neutrals again. Skirts, loose tops and long jackets in flowing fabrics were followed by short skirts and stringy tops in bright purples and blues. The next designer lined up for the evening was Vivek Narang, whose line could well have been named the most wearable of the night. Neatly-cut, structured basic silhouettes like trousers, jackets, skirts, kurtas and tops, mostly in beige and black with splashes of red, could find their place in any working woman?s wardrobe. 

 The most-awaited sequence of the evening, that of style diva Rina Dhaka, lived up to expectations. Cocktail kurtas paired with tight churidars, saris, skirts of various kinds teamed with bustiers, mostly in turquoise, purple and orange, defined the ?winter collection for the contemporary Indian woman?. 

 Kiran Uttam Ghosh changed the mood with her line based on the 1920s. The skirts, poncho tops, long jackets and dresses had a very Indian feel, and hovered mostly around the red family with glimpses of white and black.

 Puja Nayyar unveiled a completely international winter collection with a funky feel. Tunics, minis, mufflers, caps, jackets, all in winter fabrics with a retro look.

 The king of Calcutta couture, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, was the last of the professional stylists to showcase his collection. He gave a glimpse of his Frog Princess line, which he took to Milan Fashion Week earlier this year.

 The real magic came in the form of couture jewels from Raj Mahtani. Chunky gold jewels blended exquisitely with large rubies, emeralds, pearls and diamonds for necklaces, earrings, belts, armlets and headgear.

 The newly-introduced Stylefile Young Masters award was given to Prashant Ranjan, a final-year student of the National Institute of Fashion Technology, who also got a chance to showcase three men?s wear ensembles alongside the pros.

 The catwalkers who sashayed on the ramp included the likes of Joey Matthew, Jesse, Carol Gracias, Laxmi Rana, Sapna Kumar, Michelle Innes, Tupur Chatterjee, Sonali Rozario, Bhawna Sharma, Vidisha Pavate, Moni Dutta, Sanjukta, Tina, Aditya Bal, Muzzamil, Rajat Chanderlal and Iggy. The show, put together by event management firm Encore, was choreographed by Tania Lefebvre and Aparna Bahl from Preferred Professionals, Delhi.

 The show was followed by an exhibition of the outfits on Sunday. Apart from the designers who participated in the show, there were additional labels ? jewellery by Suhani, clothes by Iksenya from Bangalore and shoes and bags by Rinaldi. While the selling was supposed to start at 11 am, women queued up outside the hall half-an-hour early and by mid-day, almost half the stock had flown off the racks.

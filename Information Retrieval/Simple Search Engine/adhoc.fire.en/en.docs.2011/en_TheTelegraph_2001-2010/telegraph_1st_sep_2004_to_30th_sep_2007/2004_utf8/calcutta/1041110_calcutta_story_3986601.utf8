 The City Diary

 The power department is worried over the possibility of power cuts in the state on Thursday (Kali puja) following a drop in the supply. Large areas in the city and the districts experienced power cuts for over an hour on Tuesday as the shortfall in CESC-served areas increased to 130 MW in the evening. The deficit in state electricity board (SEB)-served areas was over 300 MW.

 EB officials said the supply from the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC)?s plant at Farakka dropped by 150 MW, following the temporary closure of a 500-MW unit last week. One 210-MW unit in Kolaghat and two units in Santaldih collapsed on Tuesday. ?The Kolaghat unit and one of the Santaldih units were started up late in the afternoon. But another 210-MW unit in Bakreswar has not been functioning since November 2,? an official said. The SEB, as a result, could not supply more than 170 MW to the CESC grid.

 he CESC has requested the power department to ensure uninterrupted power on Thursday. Senior SEB officials are trying to procure power from other states through the Power Trading Corporation.

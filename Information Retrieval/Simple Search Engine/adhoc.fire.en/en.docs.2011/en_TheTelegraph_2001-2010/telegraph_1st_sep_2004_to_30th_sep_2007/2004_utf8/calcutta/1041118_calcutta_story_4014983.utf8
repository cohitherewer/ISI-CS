 Mamata shade on jubilee bonanza

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Delegates from 14 countries, across four continents. Gala celebration plans, including a toy bank for kids and lens implant for the visually-challenged. 

 The only spanner in Rotary International?s 100-year celebrations in Calcutta next month could be Mamata Banerjee?s bandh call on December 3. ?We?ve written to her with a request to withdraw the bandh,? says Sekhar Mehta, chairman of the organising committee. ?And we?re keeping our fingers crossed.?

 Calcutta?s prime place in the celebrations is due to the fact that Rotary has spread to the rest of India and Asia from here. ?The first meeting was held on September 26, 1919, and now there are almost an equal number of clubs in Asia as in the US, where Rotary was born,? says Mehta. 

 The centenary celebrations will be held on December 3, 4 and 5. ?Following a gala inauguration ceremony, we?ll have seminars and discussions on aspects of service. We will reflect on the past 100 years, look ahead and plan for the future and strengthen our pledge to eradicate polio completely,? Mehta explains. 

 For the polio drive, WHO, Unicef and the US-based Centre for Disease Control are partnering Rotary.

 A programme to fit 100,000 patients with intra-ocular lens implants will also be launched through a live video telecast of the first operation.

 The president of Rotary International, Glenn Estess Sr, will be in attendance, along with the vice-president, treasurer and six directors.

 Rotary plans a novel contribution to Calcutta. ?There are so many libraries in the city, but not a single place where a child can go and play with toys,? says Mehta. ?Trying to change that, we are building a toy bank.?

 Delegates from all over the world have been asked to bring at least five toys each, which will be placed in a library-cum-bank. ?We?re planning to build a structure resembling the train bogeys on a plot in Salt Lake, where work begins soon.? 

 Children of all ages can visit the bank and play with the toys. Like a library, if they want to take the toys out, an amount has to be paid.

 ?We are also planning to put in place a mobile toy van, on the lines of the mobile library run by Sister Cyril of Loreto school,? Mehta adds. ?The van will help us reach the children in the slums.? 

 As soon as the project gets running, toy companies will come forward, Mehta hopes.

 The only worrying factor is the Trinamul-called bandh on December 3. ?We are expecting around 400 to 450 delegates. Some will be arriving at the stations, while others at the airport, and we would not like them to go through any hassle. India is the largest recipient of Rotary donations, and the image of the city and country will take a severe beating before the foreign delegates,? Mehta admits.

 Mamata Banerjee is yet to reply to Rotary?s plea.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kitchens at play with monitors away

 - Civic 

body sans food inspector as govt sits on notification 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 With the drive against eateries stopped long ago, there?s no knowing what?s being cooked up

 Three years ago, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had started a drive against dirty kitchens and substandard food in eateries. Cases were filed against even posh eateries as food samples collected from some of them did not make the mark. 

 But the drive could not continue because everyone ? from hotel owners to the mayor and some members in mayor?s council ? became uneasy. Municipal commissioner Debashis Som directed the health officials not to take any action without his permission.

 Adulterators are happy because mayor-in-council member Javed Khan, who had launched the drive, has been shunted to another department, and neither the local health authorities nor the food inspectors in the civic body have taken action against adulterators. 

 During a reshuffling of portfolios among four mayor-in-council members in 2003, Javed Khan had been given the charge of slum development by mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

 The civic health authorities? drive against food adulteration has remained suspended for about a year since December as the state government had failed to publish a gazette notification of the 29 newly-recruited CMC food inspectors. 

 At present, there is virtually no food inspector in the civic health department, who can legally collect samples of edible items for laboratory tests and file cases against an offender.

 As a result, when on an average over 100 adulteration cases used to be filed in municipal magistrate?s court every year, now the figure has dropped to only four or five this year. 

 By way of explanation, member, mayor-in-council (health), Pradip Ghosh said that earlier, doctors were recruited to the post of food inspectors. In 2003, the civic authorities decided to lower the essential qualification required for the post of a food inspector to science graduate having chemistry as a subject. 

 The CMC then recruited 29 science graduates as food inspectors in December, and the four doctors who were working as food inspectors till then, were promoted to the post of medical officer.

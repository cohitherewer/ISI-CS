 Words are not necessary when emotions are universal? The underlying message was driven home through a colourful melange of mime, silent theatre, dance and music at the eighth edition of the International Festival of Non-verbal Arts (IFNA). 

 Held at Rabindra Sadan, Girish Mancha and Tata Consultancy Services auditorium in Salt Lake between December 7 and 9, the festival was spearheaded by mime artiste and Body Language School director Ashok Chatterjee, in association with Ghatakpara Society for Education and Research. 

 Apart from acquainting the Indian audience with the current trends in mime the world over, Chatterjee intends to ?create new audiences through such meets by quashing the notion of silent art as traditionally understood in India since Shri Jogesh Dutta?s days?. 

 His intention found voice in clown mime and gesture theatre presented by artistes from South Korea, Sweden and England, in which various forms of performing arts and entertainment overlapped to create the colourful extravaganza.

 Clown mime by South Korea combined clowning, juggling and magic, with audience interaction being an integral part of the performance. 

 The themes were as varied as they could get. While the South Koreans relied solely on tricks and tomfoolery, Swedish mime artiste Jay Baker-Eriksen sought to portray the story of a little boy as he goes about exploring his world through simple acts of sleeping, playing, messing around with his ice cream and so on. 

 The English troupe expanded the boundaries of silent art through its Water and Fish mime, in which the couple Bonzo and Doris starts off with a gold fish circus, using an array of unusual and colourful props. ?It came to me in a dream,? smiled Paul Elliott, who played Bonzo. 

 ?In England we do more silly stuff than skillful,? chuckled Elliott, who also played the guitar in the V. Balsara orchestra, a part of the Indian section. 

 ?It was a real honour playing alongside Balsara. Musical prowess apart, he is such a wonderful man and has enormous energy for somebody his age,? added Elliott, who plays Irish folk music back home. 

 Apart from Balsara?s instrumental compositions in which Japanese, English, Irish and Indian musicians collaborated, Anirban Chatterjee presented a sitar solo, with Shubhashis Nandi on tabla. Kashmira Samanta?s dance group Nritya Upasana portraying AIDS awareness was another attraction from the Indian side. 

 More music was forthcoming from Japan with Yoshimi Ueno on the flute aided by his high-tech ?musical computer?. Renditions of a Japanese prayer song and other tunes apart, Yoshimi charmed Calcutta by playing Tagore?s Hriday amar nachere aajike. 

 ?It?s so much glory for me that I play Rabindrasangeet for Calcutta audience, dhanyabad,? he said to thunderous applause, proving there?s no substitute for that personal touch.

 Al Pacino: Comeback

 While waiting for the release 

 of his forthcoming film The Merchant of Venice, Al 

 Pacino is also planning a comeback to Broadway with August 

 Strindberg?s The Father. 

 The play, first performed in 1887, centres around the relationship between Laura and her husband, and his descent into insanity when the paternity of his child is called into question. The Father made its Broadway debut in 1912 at the Berkeley Lyceum Theatre. It has since been produced on the Great White Way six times. 

 Al Pacino was last seen on stage in 2003, at a reading of Oscar Wilde?s Salome, with a cast including Marisa Tomei. The Academy Award-winning actor made his Broadway debut in the 1969 production of Does a Tiger Wear Necktie?, which fetched him a Tony Award. The 1977 revival of The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel earned him his second Tony. Before Salome, in 1996, Pacino acted in and directed a revival of Hughie.

 How do new recruits in a company loosen up and build team spirit? By participating in a theatre workshop, of course, as Airtel employees found out.

 Leadership skills and management lessons are being doled out through simple skits, where except for the script, everything is prepared and enacted by the participants. 

 ?The idea is to enable the experience of a power team,? says Paul Mathew, conducting the workshop. Paul is an ex-Indian Army man who took up theatre as a full-time profession, before realising its use in the corporate world, particularly as a team-building tool.

 ?At the workshop, we help the participants drop their personality completely. Through interaction and working in a team, their self-consciousness disappears and they are free from their ?personality prisons?.? 

 The result, as most participants put it, is ?fantastic?. At the Tollygunge Club on Thursday, where the workshop is being held, the group of around 20 was all action and enthusiasm. Container lids (as cymbals), bedsheets (as rivers and gowns) and paper crowns and swords were the only props at hand.

 ?I only provide them with the script for a skit that lasts five to seven minutes. Everything else is done by the actors,? explains Mathew. ?And it?s not the staging of the skit that counts but the production process where ideas are exchanged and everyone performs as a team.?

 The participants are all praise for the ?unique experience?. ?After going through different things together, the team develops a natural bond,? says S.K. Pal, who had attended one of the earlier workshops.

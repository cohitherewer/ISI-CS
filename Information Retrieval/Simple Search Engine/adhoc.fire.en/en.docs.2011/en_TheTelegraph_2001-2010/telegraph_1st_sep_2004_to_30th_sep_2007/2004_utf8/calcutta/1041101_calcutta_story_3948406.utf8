The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Township to ease twin burden

 GOPAL MUKHERJEE, mayor of Howrah, met readers of The Telegraph at Sarat Sadan, Howrah, for an exclusive interactive session. 

There were several issues, including preservation of heritage buildings, need for markets, waterlogging and garbage problems and safety of women in the area. The mayor offered explanations and assured remedies

Kajal Sarkar: There isnt a proper market 

in Shibpur. Bazaars on both sides of a narrow road restrict vehicle movement. 

Any plans for new markets? Also, even after a short spell of rains, the roads 

get waterlogged and remain so for a long time.

Howrah was made in a very unplanned manner, as a result 

of which there are several such problems in many areas. There is a move, therefore, 

to build a west Howrah township, which will be a planned township. If we have 

to relocate vendors from within Howrah, a lot of compensation has to be given.

As far as waterlogging is concerned, one of the biggest 

problems is with plastic packets, bottles and other things thrown by people into 

the drains. Plastic packets less than 20 micron in thickness cannot be recycled. 

They block the vents on the roadsides and are difficult to get rid of.

M.L. Das: What are you doing regarding the added 

areas? I have recently built a house at Rabindranagar, which is plagued with drinking 

water and drainage problems.

In many of the added areas, for funds and other reasons, 

we have not been able to start work towards providing some of the services. 

Tax structure and collection methods have also not 

been finalised. The problem is that a lot of people have already purchased land 

and have started building houses there. For better water supply, we are setting 

up a booster station. By 2005, the problem should be sorted out.

Swapan Makal: I want to highlight the problem 

of garbage, particularly in Kadamtala bazaar, where you are confronted with unbearable 

stench. Also, any plan for recycling garbage?

The roads are very narrow and there isn?t any broad 

road where garbage can be dumped. We have repeatedly told the traders in the market 

to collect all garbage and hand it over to the municipal garbage collector who 

comes daily. But it seems to have no effect. We can clean up once, but not throughout 

the day. We should make it a habit not to throw garbage everywhere.

Dipak Roy: Some of the roads are supposed to be 

one-way, but they are hardly so. This causes traffic congestion and chaos. Further, 

the autorickshaw stand at Salkia Chowrasta adds to the traffic mess in the area.

A one-way road should always remain so. Police, I?m 

sure, are doing the needful, but it certainly needs a tight roping in. 

 Regarding autorickshaws, permission is given separately for plying in Howrah and Bally, but the drivers do not follow that and ply wherever they want to. We are talking with the autorickshaw association for fixing the routes. 

Suparna: Ive recently shifted to Mandirtala. 

There are hardly any streetlights there. Taking advantage of the darkness, suspicious 

people move around in the area. 

We will immediately try to address the problem regarding 

streetlights. For the rest, we will inform police. 

S. Chatterjee: Everyone has talked about problems, 

but I must say the corporation has also done a lot of work. But something more 

could be done about sports and 

culture zone-wise competitions perhaps.

We are taking initiatives towards encouraging more 

cultural activities. Infrastructure is being put in place, including a training 

facility for footballers.

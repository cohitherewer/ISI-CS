 Tax yoke vexes cablemen

 - MSO convenes interface to thrash out levy collection

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After under-declaration, turf trouble and regulatory worries, the latest bone of contention in the cable industry is the payment of service tax. In an unorganised market, a section of cable operators is not keen to pay the tax to the state government.

 ?Since September 10, operators are supposed to pay their service tax through the MSO,? said an official of the multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable, which has nearly 20 per cent market share. 

 ?We were the first in the city to start billing operators on service tax as per government norms. But the reason cited by some operators for not paying up is that other MSOs have not done so yet.?

 The Centre shifting its stance on the issue a few times has added to the confusion. 

 Initially, both the cable operator and MSO were brought under the purview of the service tax. Later, it was clarified that ?value of taxable services provided by a MSO in relation to cable services? would be exempt from service tax.

 According to the new rules, the service tax rate with effect from September 10, 2004, is 10 per cent of the value of taxable service. An education cess of 2 per cent on the service is to be additionally levied.

 Most cable TV consumers across the city, however, are having to fork out the additional amount, irrespective of whether it is finally reaching the government coffers or not.

 ?There is concern among the operators that the MSO might not deposit the tax amount collected,? said a SitiCable joint venture partner. ?Besides, some operators do not have registration numbers, so they cannot issue bills or collect tax from consumers. But we are under pressure from the service tax department.?

 To address the problem, SitiCable is organising an interaction with service tax department officials and its operators at the end of this month. ?We would like the confusion to be cleared by the officials themselves.?

 It?s not a big problem yet for the other MSOs. ?We have started billing our operators and expect to collect the tax,? said an Indian Cablenet (formerly RPG Netcom) spokesperson. ?If they don?t pay up, we will have to take up the matter.?

 CableComm feels these are niggling worries in a new payment system transition. ?We are sending circulars to our operators underlining the service tax aspect,? an official said.

SHIP SHAPE

With parlours around town offering various 

skincare facilities for men, beauty is no longer a womans domain, says 

Ipsita Deb

While the world of fashion has always been all-inclusive, 

beauty has been rather gender-biased in scope. The market has over the years been 

flooded with beauty products that are part of a ritualistic experience for women, 

but has shown scant regard for a man?s dermatological wellbeing. Except for a 

few after-shave lotions and shaving gels, the men?s skincare segment has been 

more or less ignored. But now, men are slowly catching up. It?s about time too, 

in a country where males have been particularly strong consumers of fairness creams.

Effective skincare discipline involves cleansing, 

toning and conditioning routines carried out with religious regularity. The beauty 

business professionals have caught on quick, with salons and spas currently offering 

a range of rejuvenating face masks and scrubs to boost the skin?s appearance, 

temper the effects of stress, and improve its overall health. So, if you are a 

novice in the field of pampering yourself, time for some expert help.

Taboo turner

Until a few years ago, most men felt too shy or intimidated 

to enter a salon or spa, even if they wanted to. It was seen as the domain of 

the woman. But that perception is changing and men can be spotted openly booking 

treatments. The metrosexual man acknowledges the need for a massage to release 

stress, pamper ravaged skin and be swaddled in wraps, scrubbed clean, with occasional 

pedicures and facials thrown in to pretty themselves up. 

?Men are far more regular spa visitors than their 

female counterparts. While missing appointments is rather common with women, men 

never miss a single sitting,? reveals Rutu Tawade, the manager of Solace.

Gender gap

When it comes to face care, men are usually the biggest 

possible fans of a bar of soap and a splash of cool water. But there is a growing 

awareness that our lifestyle ? combining outdoor sports, smoking, alcohol and 

stressful work ? calls for more. Plus, men are prone to more severe bouts of acne, 

that are only aggravated by harsh soaps, as they tend to have thicker, oilier 

skin and large pores that need regular exfoliation.

Men?s skin must be treated differently than a woman?s, 

as he has larger pores, causing production of more sebum (oil). Facials for men 

are geared to hydrate, exfoliate, remove impurities and renew the skin.

Beauty benefits

Daily shaving can cause redness, small nicks and irritation. 

Using after-shave and cologne can also contribute to dry and irritated skin. By 

going in for facials regularly, shaving will become less of a bother, as it can 

reduce the number of ingrown hairs and razor sensitivity, eliminate blackheads 

and other blemishes.

Facials help improve acne-ridden skin that men in 

their 20s often suffer from. Similarly, problems like crow?s feet and wrinkles, 

stressed-out dull skin and pigmentation patches can also be alleviated with proper 

skincare. 

Skin spas

While there are innumerable beauty salons offering 

treatments for women, there are a select few that welcome men. Solace at Sunny 

Park recommends its Pearl Facial for oily skin, Silver Facial for dry skin and 

Gold Facial for normal skin. However, the most popular here, particularly with 

golfers, seems to be the skin lightening souffle, which removes tan and tones 

up the skin. Prices range between Rs 625 and Rs 1,100. 

?Older men should go in for a facial every 30 to 35 

days, while the younger lot should restrict themselves to a proper cleansing treatment 

only,? adds Ritu.

Usually, the treatment starts off with a deep cleanser 

followed by a massage to release tension and stress. The application of a soothing 

mask thereafter balances and hydrates the skin. There are more specialised treatments 

as well, according to your needs.

The Addlife spa at 22 Camac Street uses Mineral Line 

products, enriched with Dead Sea minerals, to rejuvenate the skin. They offer 

a facial targeted at renewal and regeneration of dormant skin cells. It has, apparently, 

anti-ageing, tightening and firming properties, besides stimulating blood circulation 

and removing toxins from the skin. The treatment takes one hour and is priced 

at Rs 450. A separate eye treatment also helps remove dark circles, fine lines 

and puffiness.

The Sonar Spa at ITC Sonar Bangla perhaps has the 

widest range of men?s facials. Using German techniques and products, the papaya-enzyme 

facial is used for normal skin, while the Modelage revitalisation facial helps 

lighten it. 

Dr Spiller?s Collagen Intensive Skin Special is perfect 

for acne-prone skin, while the whitening facial removes pigmentation.

An age-repair facial and bio-lift facial also help 

nourish the skin and bring back its glow and vitality. A special fruit facial, 

with a papaya pack, grape scrub, almond milk and vitamin E, helps improve the 

texture. All these come at a rather steep price, between Rs 3,200 and Rs 4,500. 

Each session packs in a consultation, cleansing, scrub, steam, toner, body massage, 

face pack and moisturiser.

?Surprisingly, price does not pose much of a problem 

here as male clients queue up for these,? says a spokesperson of the spa.

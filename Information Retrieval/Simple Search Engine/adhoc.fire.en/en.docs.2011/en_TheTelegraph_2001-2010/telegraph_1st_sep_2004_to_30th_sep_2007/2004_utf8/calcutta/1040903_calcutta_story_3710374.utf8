TOLLYWOOD - Fugitive love

 Soumili, Jishu and Prosenjit on the sets 

of the film

Gyanrakol (U) 

A sweet-sour tale of two couples bungling their way

and a runaway wedding.

Success story Though Rachana Banerjee doesnt 

have much to do other than go the glycerine way at the drop of a hat, Prosenjit 

pulls it off with some support from Jishu Sengupta and Soumili Biswas. 

 Bikram and Jaya 

Hothat Neerar Jonyo (A)

A woman runs into her ex-flame (now a celebrity), 

renews the relationship, comes back to her husband and wants to forget it all.

Slowdown saga

The publicity blitz and censor board trouble helped 

it stay in the public eye for the first few weeks. But the footfall has thinned, 

despite the real-life romance of lead pair Bikram Ghosh and Jaya Seal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Critical-care ambulance on call, 24x7

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The ARMS ambulance

 An acute leukaemia patient suffers a sudden stroke leading to left-sided paralysis, and is sinking fast. His family calls a leading city hospital with emergency services. When the ambulance actually arrives three hours on, it?s a struggle fetching the patient, with one side hanging limp, down from the fourth-floor apartment, since the rickety stretcher doesn?t even have straps. Worse, the ?emergency ambulance? has no ventilator, cardiac monitor, emergency drugs or qualified staff?

 A nightmarish situation no Calcutta household is immune to. But there?s hope for critical patients and their kin. 

 Asia Rescue amp; Medical Services (ARMS) is launching the ?city?s first fully-dedicated critical-care ambulance? service that promises to ?make a difference? in primary handling and treatment in a clutch of emergencies like trauma, heart attack and stroke, syncope or surgical emergencies.

 The first of the special vehicles, an air-conditioned Tempo Traveller road ambulance, fitted with life-sustaining equipment and medication with ICU-trained nurse and specialist doctors on standby, will roll out on October 15. 

 ?The 24x7 service will be available within a 10-km radius inside city limits with a toll-free, three-digit number through Airtel and Hutch. Depending on response, we would bring in a second ambulance soon,? says Anraj Singh, medical director, ARMS (Ambulances), who is starting the service with partners Sabyasachi Ray and Ritu Singh.

 The Rs 20-lakh intensive care unit on wheels will have a roll-out stretcher trolley with oxygen for transportation of a critical patient from the ITU or accident site to the ambulance with handrails supporting a transport ventilator and multi-parameter transport cardiac monitor. 

 The crew can perform basic and advanced life-support procedures, monitor cardiac rate and rhythms and manage intubated patients on mechanical ventilation support.

 Scoop stretcher, vacuum mattress, head immobiliser, cervical extrication collar, traction and splints for lower-limb fractures, infusion syringe pumps, ECG machine, lightweight oxygen cylinders and emergency medicines for use in a critical-care environment combine to promise ?prompt, caring and efficient? bed-to-bed ambulance transfer when every second counts.

 The city?s medical fraternity feels the service will address a crying need. ?In case of trauma, a second injury, frequently caused by improper primary handling of patients, could be avoided, which often spells the difference between life and death,? observes orthopaedic surgeon Hassan Iqbal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Admission rap for tech institutes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 All 13 private management institutes in the state are under the scanner. 

 The West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) has asked the institutes to furnish details of their admission procedures by September 29, failing which officials will visit the centres for an on-the-spot inquiry.

 Samir Bandyopadhyay, WBUT registrar, said the university wanted to verify whether the institutes were abiding by a Supreme Court order on admission of students. The court had directed that only those students who had cleared any of the three entrance tests, conducted either by the Centre or the state government, would be admitted to private management institutes this year. 

 A complaint from a student prompted the university to launch the probe. 

 He had alleged that though he had not cleared any of the three stipulated tests ? Common Admission Test, Management Aptitude Test and Joint Entrance Management Admission Test ? an institute in the city had promised him a seat under the ?management quota?, provided he coughed up many times more than the normal fee.

 Following the complaint, the authorities had started a preliminary probe, which revealed that quite a few students had managed to get admitted to private institutes without clearing any of the three tests. There were, however, no documentary evidence to prove these irregularities.

 ?Every college is bound to follow the Supreme Court?s directive. Appropriate action will be taken against the institutes found violating the order,? registrar Bandyopadhyay asserted.

 Apart from asking for the details of the admission procedures, the university has also asked the institutes to send details of each student admitted this year. 

 ?The institutes are required to submit their replies by September 29. If they miss the deadline, our officials will visit the colleges and see for themselves whether there was any violation of the apex court order,? said an official. 

 ?If any student is found to have gained admission without clearing any of the mandatory tests, his application for registration will not be accepted,? he added.

 According to the rules, every student is supposed to get his or her name registered with the university for appearing in the final examination.

 When contacted, the authorities of a number of management institutes told Metro that they have been strictly obeying the Supreme Court directive.

 Now, pay to walk in Eden

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the Victoria Memorial, the Garden of Eden.

 Come New Year, a breath of fresh air early in the morning on the green by the Hooghly will no longer come free.

 The urban and recreational forestry division has decided to introduce an entry fee of Rs 2 each for morning-walkers at Eden Gardens from January 1. The entry fee at Victoria Memorial is Rs 4. 

 ?We want to increase the revenue collection by introducing the fee and using the money for further uplift of the garden,? Somenath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests, said on Wednesday.

 Earlier, the garden had been free for all. But on November 1, the authorities had introduced a fee of Rs 2 between 8 am and 5.30 pm. Morning-walkers were exempt, as were others willing to enter the premises between 5 am (when the gates open) and 8 am. 

 ?The idea behind introducing the fee was to keep unwanted elements out. The response encouraged us to bring morning-walkers within the purview as well,? Mukherjee added.

 Monthly tickets for morning-walkers will come at Rs 30 each and yearly tickets at Rs 300. Around 400-500 morning-walkers come to the garden every day. 

 ?Calculating the expected revenue at this stage is difficult, as we are not sure how many will opt for the monthly or the annual tickets,? an official said. The least the authorities expect is Rs 1 lakh.

 Considering the average daily footfall of 750 to 800, officials are confident of mopping up around Rs 1,500 a day.

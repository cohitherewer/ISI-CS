The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 An Italian exposition

 Art is a matter of the artist?s faith and represents his state of mind. The ongoing exhibition of drawings, etchings and lithographs, hosted by Seagull Foundation for the Arts in collaboration with the consulate general of Italy in Calcutta, bears out the verity of this statement. Featuring works from the collection of celebrated artist Eva Fischer, it includes creations by Italian masters, like Giorgio De Chirico, Renato Guttuso, Corrado Cagli, Franco Gentitlini (Senza Titolo; picture alongside) and Giuseppe Capogrossi, who used to meet on the famous Via Margutta in Rome in the period following the devastation of World War II. Appropriately titled A Street Called Margutta, the works on show depict the artists looking beyond death and destruction to better days ahead. Their abstract, figurative art is surreal, almost metaphysical in nature, and symbolizes an emotional way of looking at reality.

 Event: An exhibition of drawings, etchings and lithographs

 When: Till today; 2 pm - 7 pm

 Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

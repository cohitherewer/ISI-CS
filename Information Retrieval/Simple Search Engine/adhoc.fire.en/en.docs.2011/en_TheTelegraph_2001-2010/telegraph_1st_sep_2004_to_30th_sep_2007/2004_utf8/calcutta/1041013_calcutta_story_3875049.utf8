The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Guide for pandal crawlers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The police on Tuesday released guide maps for Puja pandal-hoppers.

 ?On the five Puja days, the vehicular load on the city roads swells four to five times and the population rises to nearly a crore,? police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty said while releasing the maps.

 ?Calcutta Police have taken some special measures to ensure a hassle-free journey for the revellers,? he added.

 The special measures include installation of closed-circuit TV cameras at three key intersections ? Shyambazar, Rashbehari and Park Circus ? to monitor traffic movement. 

 The wireless section will convey information about any emergency to patrol units. This will help the traffic police control crowd movement from a central location. 

 Besides, in association with a cellphone service provider, the police have developed a software that will be pressed into action for the first time during the Pujas.

 Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic), said the software will enable his men to despatch messages to mobile phone-users, informing them about traffic blocks and suggesting alternative routes.

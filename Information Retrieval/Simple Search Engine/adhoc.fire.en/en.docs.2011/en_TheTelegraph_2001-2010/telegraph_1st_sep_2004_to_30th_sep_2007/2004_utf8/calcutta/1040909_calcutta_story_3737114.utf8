The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dancing with dreams

 From Bombay to Broadway, from Rani Mukherjee to Reese Witherspoon, Farah Khan has been there, done that. And with Main Hoon Na, she has added her name to the list of Bollywood?s ?big directors?.

 In the city on Tuesday to launch Indian Idol, Farah spoke like the seasoned campaigner she is. ?I always knew Main Hoon Na would be a big hit. Not because there is some secret formula that I used in the film. It?s just that during the shooting itself I could feel that there was magic happening all around. It had all the clich? jokes and brotherly relationships, but in my style? which worked.?

 Having directed such a blockbuster and already moved on to another film, Farah doesn?t find choreographing for others exciting enough. ?It is really boring to choreograph them. But there are so many close friends in the industry that I can?t say no to some of them.? So Farah made Akshay, Salman and Priyanka dance in Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and will do the same for David Dhawan?s next with Salman, Katrina and Sushmita.

 She isn?t quite ready to talk about her next directorial venture, yet. ?We are writing it at the moment. It is going to be produced by Shah Rukh. The film will be different from Main Hoon Na, but an entertainer all right with a whole lot of comedy. It will have an ensemble cast with Shah Rukh, of course. I can assure you that it will have my trademark stamp.?

 But the project may just get delayed if some big Western project butts in. ?After Bombay Dreams and Vanity Fair, there have been many offers and I am considering them,? says Farah, who just can?t get over the Hollywood experience. ?Mira and I have worked before in Monsoon Wedding (for the Chunari Chunari sequence) but the schedule was so tight that we really couldn?t enjoy? I am so happy that she thought of me for this big Hollywood project. It was just great. Here was Reese Witherspoon, three months pregnant but no nakhras, no mummies on the sets ? the pleasure was all mine.?

 Farah was less tight-lipped about her marriage plans (she recently got engaged to editor Shirish Kunder) than her forthcoming film. ?He just gave me a ring and it became this big secret engagement. Even my mother read about it in the newspapers. As for the marriage, I don?t know when it will happen but it will be a really private occasion.?

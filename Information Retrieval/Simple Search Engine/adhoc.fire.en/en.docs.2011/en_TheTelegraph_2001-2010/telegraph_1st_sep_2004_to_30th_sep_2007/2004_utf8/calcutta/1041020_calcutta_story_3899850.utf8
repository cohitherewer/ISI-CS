 Township trees in fell peril

 - SALT LAKE RESIDENTS BLAME CIVIC CONTRACTOR

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Salt Lake has been fast losing its famed green cover, prompting public protest and an inquiry into allegations of illegal felling of trees. The guilty, it is alleged, is a contractor who has been hired by the civic body to trim township trees. 

 ?Of the two contractors assigned the job, we suspect one has been felling trees,? said Sutanu Kar, executive officer of Bidhannagar Municipality. His contract has been cancelled and he has been asked to face an inquiry committee.

 Admitting that the civic authorities had received several complaints about felling of trees, Kar asserted that offenders would be dealt with sternly, in accordance to the municipality?s rules.

 Several trees on First Avenue and Crossroad One have been chopped off, alleged Ramen Das, secretary of the 400-strong Bidhannagar Horticulture Society. ?Sector I has been the worst hit. Sectors II and III are not lagging behind, either,? he added. 

 At a recent meeting of the society, almost all members, representing various blocks of the township, alleged that trees were actually felled in the name of trimming. The society will lodge a complaint with the municipality soon, Das said. 

 Sabyasachi Dutta, councillor of ward 10, alleged a racket has been active across Salt Lake. ?They chop off full-grown trees and sell the logs and branches to the adjacent sawmills,? Dutta said, quoting residents. 

 Residents of BF block have complained to him that big trees at the park are being chopped off regularly.

 ?Complaints from other blocks, too, are pouring in. Most of the complainants inform us over the phone,? said a civic official. 

 In DD and DC blocks, residents alleged that the branches are cut in such a way that the trees would not survive. 

 ?We hire contractors only to trim branches. But at times we are compelled to chop off trees that are destroying properties or are on the verge of death,? explained Dilip Kumar Gupta, executive engineer of the municipality. He, however, asserted that right now, even those trees that are destroying drainage lines are not being felled.

 West Bengal Pollution Control Board officials pleaded helplessness in curbing the trend. 

 ?A 1991 court order had restricted our jurisdiction to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area only,? said an official. ?It is up to the district and sub-divisional officials to ensure that trees are not felled in the township.?

 Christmas carols, colour amp; culture

Christmas is a quiet, quality family occasion for 

some and time to party hard for others. And the kids are rarely left behind. There 

are plenty of celebrations in town just for the youngsters, with a variety of 

events on offer. 

 Indus Valley, a multi-cuisine restaurant on Syed Amir Ali Avenue, has organised a fun-filled week of unlimited food, fun and frolic for children. ?Jitni marzi khao aur masti mein gul ho jao is the theme. Any festival is important for the kids. Hence, the Christmas fiesta for the kids,? says Neerja Nopany, owner of Indus Valley. 

Chomp and chew your way to a full stomach, from chocolate 

shake, crunchy corns and crispy French fries, to cheesy pizzas, burgers and chole 

bature . The fun and games cost Rs 150 per person. On December 25, LauncherZ 

had organised a workshop on the significance of Christmas. 

The Kenilworth hotel had a Pokemon Jungle Christmas 

party last week for toddlers, with a host of gifts, games, activities and shows, 

as well as Santa Claus. 

At Just 4 Kids Montessori School, it was a three-day 

extravaganza, from December 20 to 22. On the last day, the boys were dressed as 

Santa, while the girls were angels, pretty in pink and white. The tiny tots sang 

Jingle Bells and gorged on Christmas cake to usher in the holidays.

Santa?s little maker

Devang Kumar, a Class III student of La Martiniere 

for Boys, celebrated Christmas this year with a unique Santa Claus, a creation 

that was his own. Devang?s Santa is different from the ones available on shop 

shelves. This eight-year-old?s Santa is 7 ft tall and made of wooden planks stuffed 

with cotton wool. Devang?s enthusiasm to create his own Father Christmas led him 

to the market to choose the right material and colours for his ?masterpiece?. 

Devang used white polyester staple fibre for the beard, his own red karate belt 

and red velvet for Santa?s clothes. The little creator also decorated a 9-ft Christmas 

tree, with bells, stars, confetti and other knick-knacks. Devang converted his 

entire room into a mini North Pole (the snow is made of white polyester staple 

fibre). There was even a ?snow-blower machine? in place to clear the way for Santa?s 

arrival on his sleigh on Christmas. The room is all lit up, and Devang plays Christmas 

carols for all who enter his wonder world (picture by Rashbehari Das).

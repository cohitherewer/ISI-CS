One of them has been on the music stage for a quarter 

of a century with a single band while the other a year more, but with three. Setting 

these minor differences aside, Shafin Ahmed and Ayub Bachchu are both rock gods 

in their own country, as also names that music lovers on most college campuses 

in Calcutta swear by.

Ahmed is the driving force behind Miles (Phiriye 

Dao fame) while Bachchu founded LRB (best known for Shei Tumi), the 

two Bangla rock bands that have travelled from across the Padma for a concert 

where they would feature alongside local lads Chandrabindoo and Cactus.

?Miles has been coming to Calcutta since 1993,? said 

Ahmed, the vocalist and bassist of the band. ?Till recently, we were playing at 

campuses, but the trend seems to be changing now.?

The proof lies in Rock Jugalbandi, where the bands 

would perform at the Salt Lake stadium on Saturday evening. ?Sponsors are coming 

in and people are paying to see Bangla bands.? 

As for LRB, ?it stands for Love Runs Blind and not 

Little River Band as is the common notion,? points out Bachchu. He was with Feelings 

for three years and with Souls for the next decade, before forming LRB in 1991. 

Nine albums, numerous live appearances and foreign tours have happened since.

?Band music? is huge in Bangladesh. ?Concerts easily 

draw 30,000 people who pay an average of 100 to 200 Taka,? says Ahmed. When the 

country received Test status in cricket, the government decided to celebrate with 

a gala rock concert. 

Calcutta is going through the initial phase of Bangla 

rock, feel both Ahmed and Bachchu, something Bangladesh went through ?decades 

ago?. 

Miles and LRB have some common influences ? Deep Purple 

and Led Zeppelin, particularly ? but while LRB considers itself a ?100 per cent 

rock band?, Miles even plays soul, R amp;B and jazz.

Upcoming projects include new albums for both. Miles? 

eighth album, Pratidhwani, slated for a winter release, will have ?an early 

Miles flavour but new styles and sounds?. LRB?s 10th is yet to be titled but should 

come out around December. Miles is planning a ?live? album compiled from its vault 

of live performances while LRB is firming up plans for its music school in Dhaka.

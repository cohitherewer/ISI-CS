 Private wash for hospital dirty linen

 - Turbo-powered laundries to oust dhobis

 KINSUK BASU

 Care to hit the bed on milk-white bedsheets or sleep on pillows with starched and pressed covers in a government hospital? 

 Or, for that matter, walk into a state-run hospital and find clean curtains on the windows? If it sounds good, read on.

 In a move to do away with the age-old system of getting hospital linen ? and other materials ? cleaned by dhobis, the mandarins of the state health department have decided to seek private participation to do up the face of the hospitals.

 The state health department, for the first time, has invited bids from private cleaners to take up the task of cleaning all hospital linen, including bedsheets, pillowcases and even tabletops, at competitive prices. 

 Buoyed by the move ? which for many is a small step towards the giant leap of privatisation of the health sector ? some big names in drying and cleaning have already shown interest and, if insiders are to be believed, the selection process will kick off soon. 

 ?We have received letters of interest from three major companies and the tender will be floated soon. Our logic is simple ? we want to provide better service. A patient surely has the right to a clean mosquito net and bedsheet,? explained the director of health services in the state, Prabhakar Chatterjee. 

 The state will set up three huge mechanised laundries, which will be managed by private players, at three zones across the city. 

 The North zone will include Calcutta Medical College, RG Kar and BC Roy Hospital for Children. Bagha Jatin State General Hospital, Institute of Psychiatry, SSKM and others will comprise the South zone while NRS and National Medical College and Hospital will be a part of the Central zone.

 According to the preliminary plan, the feed from South and Central zones will be sent to two laundries in Bagha Jatin State General Hospital, while Calcutta Medical College and Hospital will take the entire load of the North zone. Around 14,000 beds will be covered from almost all the tertiary and secondary-level hospitals.

 Once the deal is finalised, the state plans to do away with the few dhobis who are still on the government payroll. The damages will be worked out per item on the basis of weight. A bedsheet weighing around 500 g, for instance, will cost Rs 2.50. 

 The private party will have to ensure that the laundering not only meets the desired hygiene standard but also abides by the norms set by the pollution control board. 

 ?Since the laundries will be turbo-powered, the hospitals will get their feed of clean linen without any backlog,? said an officer of the health department.

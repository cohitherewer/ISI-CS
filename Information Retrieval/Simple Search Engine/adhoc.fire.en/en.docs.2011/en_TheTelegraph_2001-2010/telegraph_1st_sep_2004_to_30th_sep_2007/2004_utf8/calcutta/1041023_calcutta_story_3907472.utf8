 Puja Buzz

 Tech tradition

 Puja 2004 saw tradition and technology 

 coming together like never before. Puja organisers have 

 chosen traditional themes over gimmickry and rewind to roots 

 is clearly in vogue, but telecom technology is out in full 

 beep-and-click glory.

 ?Thank god tradition is back,? 

 said a pandal hopper near Telengabagan on Ashtami night, 

 busy capturing the essence of the puja on his camera phone! 

 From offering anjali at Kalighat to conveying sharad 

 shubhechha, keeping in touch in a crowded pandal to 

 sending a picture message of the devi ? it?s all 

 about Puja on the smallest available screen. And then there 

 were the eyeballs riveted on idols in the inbox, with ?Hente 

 noy, Net-e dekhun? becoming an anthem 

 in web world.

 Fleet street

 It was zip zap zoom on Saptami 

 night along VIP Road, with vehicles hitting what is a veritable 

 chaos corridor during every peak hour pleasantly surprised 

 by the kilometres being gobbled up like kebabs. The reason 

 for the unexpected breather ? a markedly below-par kick-off 

 by traditional traffic-stopper Sreebhumi Sporting Club and 

 extreme police measures. Sreebhumi did make a comeback of 

 sorts on Ashtami, with footfall soaring as the night wore 

 on. But driving along VIP Road still stayed seamless. For 

 residents and frequent flyers, the Puja days were too little 

 of a basic luxury ? getting home on time or catching a flight 

 without being waylaid by VIP Road traffic. Monday, it?ll 

 be back to the same old traffic snarls.

 Beauty Q

 We are used to queues ? be it 

 at railway stations or in banks. But what about waiting 

 in front of beauty parlours? 

 With each Puja day demanding a 

 new visage, some beauty parlours in and around Calcutta 

 saw ladies lining up, literally, to look their best. And 

 they werent huffing and puffing about it either. With 

 customer being queen, temporary shades in front of parlours 

 sprung up and provisions for chairs were made. ?I don?t 

 want to be blamed for a customer getting all tanned while 

 waiting for a facial,? said an owner, pointing to the temporary 

 tent.

 In the line of festivity

 Falling back into line, here a 

 queue, there a queue, everywhere a queue is what caught 

 the eye while passing through pandal territory. At places, 

 it was taking two hours to get from the starting point of 

 the wait to the devi darshan. Cramped and crushed 

 in the sea of heads moving at snail?s pace, pandal-hopping 

 was the ultimate test in Puja patience and endurance. But 

 let?s raise a toast to the true-blue pandal-hopper who stood 

 in line, with a smile on his face and praise for the Pujas 

 on his lips.

 Fusion feel

 Therapeutic massages and the sweet 

 taste of tender coconut water, a hearty Bengali lunch complete 

 with shukto, posto and rosogolla, unwinding 

 at Santiniketan-style mud cottages? The foreign and NRI 

 guests of Happenings, in town for Mahotsav, the four-day 

 Puja trek, had a whale of a time at Vedic Village on Ashtami, 

 after all-night pandal hopping. From flying a kite to taking 

 a bullock-cart ride to trying their hand at the dhaak 

 ? the mood was one of relaxed camaraderie in the cradle 

 of rural Bengal. From Vedic by day to the newly-unveiled 

 Star theatre and the fusion beats drummed up by Bikram Ghosh 

 at night ? the canvas was as kaleidoscopic as could be. 

 ?Exotic stuff? was the universal refrain, as the tourists 

 trooped out of the auditorium.

 Road (mis)rule

 With the usual bamboo-poll fencing 

 that reins in the crowds and keeps them on the sidewalks 

 absent at many places this Puja, revellers were seen spilling 

 onto the roads, leading to car crawl along stretches of 

 Chittaranjan Avenue, Vivekananda Road, Gariahat Road and 

 other thoroughfares with big-ticket pandals. ?Didi, doya 

 kore footpath diye hatun,? a bus conductor pleaded with 

 a lady straying onto Beleghata Main Road, even as the driver 

 struggled to navigate the maze. With the pavements taken 

 over by the junk-food yard, police pleaded helplessness 

 and people ruled the roads.

 With a wink

 Talking of traffic-stoppers takes 

 us to Maddox Square, the meeting ground for all things youthful 

 and beautiful. The Ashtami award for show stealer went to 

 the Madhuri Dixit-lookalike (from the back, that is), in 

 a choli straight out of Hum Aapke Hain Koun?! 

 And, boy, werent there enough pandal people dying 

 to tell her exactly what she was to them! Only the stern 

 gaze of cops ( quot;look, but go no further quot;) maintained 

 the peace at Maddox and all around...

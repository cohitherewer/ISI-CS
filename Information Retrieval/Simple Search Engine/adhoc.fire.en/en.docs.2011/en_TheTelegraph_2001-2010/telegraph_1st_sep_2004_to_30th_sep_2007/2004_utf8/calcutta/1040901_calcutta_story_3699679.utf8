What We are Watching 

BOLLYWOOD - Love triangles

 Mujhse Shaadi Karogi: Keep laughing

Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (U/A) 

David Dhawans brand of crazy comedy returns on the 

biceps of the hottest new combo in tinsel town Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar. 

Theres Priyankas oomph factor for company.

Catch it at INOX (Forum): 3.45 pm; 89 

Cinemas: 2.45 pm; Elite: 12 noon, 3 pm, 6 pm, 9 pm Success story 

The film has continued to bring in audiences despite new big releases in the 

form of Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... and Fida. The release of Dhoom 

will definitely hamper its prospects but the film has made enough business to 

be counted in the hit list of Bollywood 2004. 

 Fida: Cold cut 

Fida (U/A)

Ken Ghosh tried to go hatke with his version 

of Abbas Mastans Humraaz. But the the audience was anything but fida.

Catch it at Inox (Forum): 2.30 pm, 5 pm, 10.35 

pm; INOX (City Centre): 10.35 am, 4.10 pm, 6.40 pm, 9.10 pm; 89 Cinemas: 

11.30 am, 7.15 pm, 9.45 pm; Metro: 12 noon, 3 pm, 6 pm, 9 pm.

Flop factor Second weeks collections in 89 

Cinemas have plunged to 40 per cent. The hype got the better of the film and the 

Bebo-Shahid chemistry was marked absent.

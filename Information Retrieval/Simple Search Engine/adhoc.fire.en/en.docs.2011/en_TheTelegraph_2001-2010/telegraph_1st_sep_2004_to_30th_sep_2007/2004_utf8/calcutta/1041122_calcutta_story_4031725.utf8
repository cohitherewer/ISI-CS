 Rulebook on pruning green cover

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 If it?s festive season in the city, roadside trees are bound to look different: broken branches and twisted twigs. 

 Most Puja organisers, in their zeal to remove obstructions, flout all Green bench rules and prune trees mercilessly, or chop them altogether.

 Lack of environmental awareness among citizens has prompted the state government to prepare a set of guidelines that will soon be implemented in the city to protect its green cover.

 ?Proper pruning is essential to protect the environment. We often receive complaints of trees being pruned in such a manner that it is as good as felling,? said Shyamal Sarkar, member-secretary of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board.

 ?There are no proper rules now to guide the pruning of trees. And that has prompted us to prepare a set of guidelines,? he added.

 According to the guidelines, drafted by the forest department?s urban and recreational forestry division, pruning operations should be supervised by trained field staff.

 ?Pruning should either be handled by skilled labourers, which is not the case now, or it should be done under the supervision of trained staff, who must have some accountability,? said a senior forest department official. 

 As the trees planted along the roads in Calcutta and Salt Lake over the past 15 years have not been maintained properly, most have grown long branches that often obstruct streetlights or traffic signals. 

 As a result, during major events like Durga or Kali puja, or even a neighbourhood soiree, the trees causing obstruction are recklessly hacked, the forest department said in the preface to the guidelines.

 Officials said proper maintenance of a tree requires timely pruning of branches. The guidelines have been prepared primarily to identify a set of scientific methods that will be followed during pruning operations.

 The guidelines specify that a committee will be formed with representatives from the pollution control board, forest department and the public. ?Whenever any roadside tree is to be pruned, the committee will have to be approached for consent,? an official informed.

 If more than 10 trees are to be pruned together, the authorities will have to arrange for a field inspection. The guidelines also mention that every trimming/pruning drive must have a follow-up inspection.

 ?If any irregularity comes to notice, the executing agency must be penalised with a fine to compensate the damage. The fine can be used for planting more trees,? the official added.

 The guidelines are being fine-tuned and will be forwarded to the pollution control board for approval. Some of the recommendations are: 

While pruning a branch, the snapping point must be as close to the main stem as 

possible and the cut surface must be painted with coal tar or a fungicide

Except for a pruning knife, tree pruner or a pruning saw, no other instrument 

is to be used for trimming trees. Use of the axe has been expressly forbidden, 

as it causes grievous injury to the tree 

Pruning should be done at the end of a dormant period (February-March), when the 

tree is ready to sprout new shoots. A light pruning may be allowed during or just 

after the monsoon.

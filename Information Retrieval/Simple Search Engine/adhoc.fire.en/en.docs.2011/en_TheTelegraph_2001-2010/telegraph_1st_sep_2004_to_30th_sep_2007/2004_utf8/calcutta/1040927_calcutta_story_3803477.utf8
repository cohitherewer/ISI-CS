The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Highrises and high risks of firemen 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Expressing concern at the rise in the number of fire-related incidents in the city, the state fire department has termed as ?veritable death traps? residential highrises and commercial buildings that haven?t addressed safety measures seriously.

 ?There are more than 24,000 tall apartment buildings in the four metros at present, and a large number of those are sealed tinder boxes, presenting a major challenge to fire-fighters,? said B.M. Sen, director, West Bengal Fire Services.

 Sen was speaking at a seminar where the Confederation of Real Estate Developers? Association of India (CREDAI), Bengal chapter, announced an award for the best-maintained residential complex in town, with fire-fighting preparedness being a principal criterion.

 The fire department has ladders that can go up to a maximum of 17 floors. So, if a fire breaks out in a building taller than that, the consequences depend entirely on the in-built safety mechanisms, the director said, stressing the need to appoint a fire officer in all tall complexes.

 ?Proper education of occupants on quick evacuation and escape routes, accessibility of fire engines to the structure, adequate water supply source, installation and proper maintenance of smoke-detection and control devices and a proper public-address system go a long way in minimising the damage. Lives are often lost through irrational behaviour triggered by panic,? Sen observed.

 Besides fire-safety norms, the award for the best-maintained building instituted by the developers? forum in conjunction with integrated facility management firm Novalogix Solutions, will take into account a plethora of parameters.

 They are ? housing-keeping services; security amp; surveillance; mechanical amp; engineering services; pest control; landscape amp; gardening services; administration of club services; bill generation amp; collection of payment; event management; running of soft services.

 The panel of judges will comprise well-known citizens, representatives from the fire services department and reputed audit agencies, architects and engineers, besides three members from CREDAI, Bengal.

 ?The accumulated prize money will be Rs 5 lakh every year,? said developers? forum president Jugal Khetawat. Novalogix will sponsor the best building award, initially restricted to residential complexes within greater Calcutta.

 ?Later, commercial buildings and retail shopping centres will also be covered,? said Pradip Chopra, honorary secretary of CREDAI, Bengal, who pushed a four-point formula (?educate, motivate, legislate, innovate?) as the way forward.

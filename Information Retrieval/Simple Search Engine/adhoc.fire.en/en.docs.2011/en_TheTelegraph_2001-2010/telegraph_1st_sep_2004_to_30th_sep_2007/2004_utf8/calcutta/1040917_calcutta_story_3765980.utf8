 Train timing irks students

 - Tracks blocked to seek shift in schedule to suit school hours

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A set of 200 students blocked the railway tracks at Bamangachhi station, near Barasat, for two hours on Thursday morning. 

 Reason: the railways have advanced the timing of a Habra-bound local, on the Sealdah-Bongaon section, which they avail of to attend schools in Bamangachhi and its adjoining areas. 

 The students, from at least 10 schools, complained that if they take that train, they will be too early for school. And if they take the next train, they will be too late to enter.

 A series of meetings with the protesters failed to persuade them to clear the tracks. They relented only after the railway authorities assured them of fixing a meeting with the divisional railway manager (DRM) on Monday.

 The students decided to block the tracks almost as soon as they reached school on Thursday. 

 They came straight to Bamangachhi station and squatted on the tracks around 10.30 am. Two teachers accompanied them, but did not take part in the demonstration. They kept an eye on the students. 

 Elaborating on the reason for the blockade, a railway official said the students were against the rescheduling of a particular Habra-bound train, which came into effect on September 1.

 They were demanding that the old timings be restored immediately. ?The students are mostly from Barasat, Hridaypur and Madhyamgram. They are peeved because the train, following the revised schedule, reaches Bamangachhi at 10.10 am, which is 40 minutes before their schools start,? an official said.

 ?We have to leave home at 9.30 am. When we reach school, it?s too early. The classrooms are locked,? said Rajat Biswas, a Class IX student of Duttapukur Mahesh Vidyapith. ?Eto aage giye ki korbo, school-er baire dariye thakte hoy (what is the point going so early, we have to wait outside school),? he added.

 Malia Ghosh, of Nibadi Girls? High School, said: ?The next train reaches Bamangachhi at 11.10. If we take it, we will be late. Our teachers won?t allow us to enter class.?

 A section of local residents, too, are supporting the students? cause. 

 ?Despite the disruption in services, we handled the situation with tact. The moment the students were assured that they would be able to meet the DRM, they lifted the blockade,? said Subhankar Chatterjee, sub-divisional police officer of Barasat.

The essence of well-being 

Ship Shape

The healing and rejuvenating powers of 

essential oils have been used to cure ailments for ages. Nisha Lahiri finds 

out why

Egyptians used them to entomb mummies. Indians used 

them to appease the gods. The Greeks and Romans believed in their powers and Shakespearean 

apothecaries propagated their benefits.

Essential oils have been around for thousands of years. 

For many centuries they have been used for medicinal value. But it was French 

chemist Rene Maurice Gattefosse who coined the term aromatherapy in 1928, after 

he burnt his hand, dipped it in lavender oil and discovered its healing powers. 

After extensive research, Gattefosse published his 

findings and sealed the future of aromatherapy as a method of natural healing 

and rejuvenation for mind and body.

Perfumes and bath soaps, incense sticks and night 

creams, aromatherapy is gaining ground in a number of applications, taking root 

in daily life as a fuss-free route to well-being. 

Pour a few drops of lavender oil on to your pillow 

at night and sleep like a log. Tea tree oil can treat a cut or bruise. The uses 

are as endless as the list of oils on offer.

All about aroma

Rose, sandalwood, myrrh, eucalyptus, ylang ylang, 

patchouli, lemongrass, rosemary, peppermint? There are more extracts than you 

may have believed possible, easily available at places that commonly practice 

aromatherapy, like spas, beauty clinics and gyms. 

They are available at stores as well, being sold by 

a number of brands including The Home Store and Blossom Kochhar. The price depends 

on a range of factors, not least of which is the availability of the plant.

If the products are expensive, the figures explain 

why. To produce one kilogram of their respective oils, approximately 400 kg of 

thyme, 2,000 kg of rose petals, six tonnes of orange blossoms and four million 

jasmine flowers are needed. However, blends have the best benefits, with a combination 

of therapeutic values and only a few drops of any one essential oil used at a 

time.

The oils are highly-concentrated extracts from various 

parts of a plant including flower, bark, root, leaf and stem. They are never used 

undiluted. Mixed with water in a bath, burnt over a candle, blended in creams 

or vegetable oil (like almond for a massage or a facial) are just some of the 

ways in which these potions can tickle the olfactory senses.

How it works

Soothe the nerves, loosen the muscles, calm the mind 

and treat those nagging aches and pains ? aromatherapy can be good for whatever 

problem you?ve got. 

?They play with emotions, enhance your senses and 

help circulation, all through smells and physical application,? explains Rutu 

Tawde, manager, Solace spa, which offers aromatherapy treatments. ?At the end, 

you feel refreshed.?

The Sunny Park health centre uses Blossom Kochhar?s 

aromatherapy products and treatments. ?There are so many uses for aromatherapy. 

It is not a wonder cure, but arthritis and hair loss to insomnia and stress, it 

can help with a lot of conditions. Some oils have antiseptic and antibiotic properties. 

But they are never ingested and there are certain restrictions. Some oils are 

dangerous and pregnant women should restrict use,? explains Tawde.

The massages and treatments at VLCC?s aromatherapy 

studio at the Alipore centre all deal with stress. ?We ask clients if they have 

any specific needs. Depending on the condition, whether it?s insomnia, hypertension 

or depression, we use the required oils and blends, put together at our Delhi 

office,? says Mita Chatterjee.

Self help

Anxiety, tired feet or insect bites ? head to toe 

solutions are provided by the different oils. Most are simple enough for home 

use. The trick is getting the dose right. Also, watch out for products that are 

labelled as containing fragrances rather than the oils themselves, as these are 

not the real thing.

You could pour a few drops of oil in the bath water 

or use some pre-mixed products. Dab some sandalwood oil behind the ear and neck 

for a no-tension day at work or spray some jasmine before a date to create the 

right chemistry.

Whatever aroma you choose, a sweet smell might be 

the key to stress-free success.

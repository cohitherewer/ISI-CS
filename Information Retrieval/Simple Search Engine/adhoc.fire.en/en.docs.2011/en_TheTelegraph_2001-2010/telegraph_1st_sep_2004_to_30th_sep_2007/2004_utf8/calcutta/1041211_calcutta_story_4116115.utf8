The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Roots amp; bitter truths 

She was a 1st-year history student at Miranda House 

when riots ripped the calm in Delhi, that October afternoon in 1984. Twenty years 

on, Shonali Bose (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya) still lives with the memories 

of faces contorted in agony, relief camps swamped with the homeless, and untold 

stories buried in time.

 ?It surprised me that there were so many unsolved incidents of the 1984 riots and yet nobody had written anything or made a film on them. I had worked in relief camps and street plays back then. We came across several incidents of communal violence and Amu is based on one of those,? says Shonali, about her first film on an Indian American girl?s quest for identity. 

 The gripping narrative of Amu follows Kaju (played by Konkona Sen Sharma) visiting her uncle?s family in Delhi, her frantic efforts to trace her roots and unravel a genocide a city desperately wants to forget. Amu was shot in sync sound and on-location in the Manikpura area of old Delhi.

 ?But I wanted to take the story beyond and so worked on a format where the present looks back at the past. It?s about people like me and Keya (Kaju?s mother, played by Brinda Karat) who have lived with the pain through the years and also the elitist St Stephen?s boy who wants to come out of his mould,? adds the 39-year-old film graduate from University of California, Los Angeles.

 After schooling in Loreto House, the Calcutta girl moved to Delhi and (then) Bombay before settling down in Los Angeles with husband and two children. She now produces and hosts a monthly radio show on South Asia in the US.

?The censor board has made five cuts and wants to pass Amu with an ?A? certificate. I wanted U/A because second-generation kids can relate to the film. But the censor board asked me why should I let children know about a past that is buried,? exclaims Shonali, who has pulled of a brilliant ensemble cast comprising politician Karat and the elderly Aparna Roy.

 ?Brinda is my maasi and Aparna Roy is Safdar Hashmi?s mother-in-law,? laughs Shonali, admitting that the two needed a lot of coaxing before agreeing to play the parts.

 For Kaju, Shonali auditioned around 50 to 60 girls in Los Angeles and San Francisco before deciding on Konkona. ?She stayed with me in Los Angeles for two-and-a-half weeks to work on her American accent. We rehearsed the scenes; I would be Keya and she would be Kaju. I also did a lot of rehearsals with the entire cast to be a family, so shooting was no problem at all.?

 While filming Amu, Penguin came up to her with the offer to pen it as a novel. ?And there I was, writing the book while editing my film,? says Shonali. The film and the book release on January 5 next year.

 Stringed harmony

 Carrying forward the musical legacy of their illustrious father, violin maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman, the siblings GJR Krishnan and Vijayalakshmi are today leading exponents of instrumental classical music. Their duet violin recital this evening, which marks the beginning of the three-day Carnatic music festival hosted by Rasikhapriya, imbibes the very essence of Carnatic classical music. Demonstrating sparkles of innovation in presentation while scrupulously adhering to tradition, the duo promises to delight and stimulate the senses of the musically inclined. Characterised by pristine purity, lucidity, melody, rhythm and an emphasis on sahitya, Krishnan?s music touches the heart and elevates the mind. Vijayalakshmi excels as an artiste, displaying wonderful musical temperament by eloquently capturing the mood and essence of any composition. A commendable effort on the part of the organisers, offering Calcuttans an opportunity to experience the rich heritage of Carnatic music.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All of 25 tunes, to play at a theatre nearby

 Jhankaar Beats and Musafir. 

 From a couple of songs in Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi to a probable 25 songs ? yes, 25 ? in Sujoy Ghosh?s new film Home Delivery? Music-makers Vishal and Shekhar are on a dramatic growth chart.

 Amidst writing more songs for one film than runs Virender Sehwag can score in an innings, Vishal Dadlani spoke to Pratim D. Gupta from Pune about their musical journey, past, present and future:

 How it all began: As a kid, I was always into music, treating the Elvis Presleys and Chuck Berrys as gods. I was also a major Amitabh Bachchan fan. So while watching almost all his films, I became familiar with Bollywood music of the likes of R.D. Burman, Kalyanji Anandji, Laxmikant Pyarelal. In college, a friend, Shiraz, and I started this music band named Pentagram. It did very well and was a huge hit in the college circuit. Shiraz, who dabbled in ad films and music videos, became Raj Kaushal?s assistant for Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi. I had made Woh pehli baar just out of my love for my then girlfriend and now wife. When Raj heard the song, he said: ?We have to have it in our film.? That was the start.

 Moving on: Raj and I had a common friend in Benoy who played a Nepalese folk song and Raj wanted it to be adapted for Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi. That?s how Musu musu hasi was born. Shekhar composed a couple of tracks for the same film and we got together to score the title song. Sony Music heard the songs, bought the rights and in no time Woh pehli baar and Musu musu hasi were topping the charts and everyone was talking about the music. Shekhar and I decided to make more music together but the concept of a career was never there. 

 Jelena rocks to Dupatta Beimaan Re.

Growth curve: We didn?t know how to network 

to capitalise on the success of Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi. We set up a little 

studio and started doing a whole lot of advertisement jingles. Thankfully, we 

didn?t have to go to producers with harmoniums looking for work. We never even 

thought of producing stock music to use later for other films. We leave it for 

the Himeshs (Reshammiya) of the universe ? it works for them. We just wrote a 

lot of songs for ourselves. That period was very useful for both of us. When two 

people collaborate for something creative, one has to know how the other works. 

Then we started getting a lot of one-off assignments for films. We did the title 

tracks for Champion, Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai, Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil 

Mein and the Chhod na re track in Kaante.

Pancham punch: After hearing the music of Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi, even before the release of the film, Sujoy (Ghosh) came to us and said, ?I have no funds but I am doing this film which is a tribute to R.D. Burman.? 

 We heard the script and it was funny as hell and moreover there was the RD factor. We said yes to Jhankaar Beats. Sujoy wanted to use all original R.D. Burman tracks but being a small film, he would have got into a lot of legal hassles. So we got to do something original.

 Then there was Vivek Vaswani who stole the formative idea and started making Dil Vil Pyar Vyar. It was shameful how he even stole the idea of the three couples. But the film failed despite his having the ?greatest music director? (RD).

 Where Jhankaar Beats worked was that we didn?t try to rip the legend?s work. His understanding of music was all so modern that they can be used in any film today without even touching them. When we won the R.D. Burman Award for the film, it was our greatest high.

 Vishal and Sekhar, the duo behind all the 

music 

What lies ahead: The music of Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao! has been well received, especially the item number Dupatta beimaan re. I love item numbers. Let?s face facts here, Yeh mera dil, Mehbooba mehbooba, Laila main Laila were all item numbers. 

 We have done the music for Sanjay Gupta?s new film Musafir. He just said, ?What I need are really kick-ass tunes?. That was a pretty cool brief.

 He has come up with this concept of twin albums for the film, Club and Lounge. We orchestrated and arranged the music our way and then DJ and VJ Nikhil Chinappa gave his feedback on the songs. 

 Musafir?s music has gone beyond Kaante and can easily fit into the music that?s happening around the world.

 We are doing two other films for Pritish Nandy Communications ? Shabd and Na Jaane Kaise. Then there?s Sujoy?s new film Home Delivery with his typical understated brand of comedy. 

 Yes, there are 25 full songs in the film and none of them is a background track. It should redefine Bollywood music.

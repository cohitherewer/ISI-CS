 NRI seats fixed at 15 per cent 

 - Apex court rejects plea on MBBS admission 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the applications of medical students admitted through the NRI quota, and said, for the moment, the quota reserved for NRI students in medical colleges has been limited to 15 per cent of the total number of seats. 

 According to a copy of the record of the proceedings at the apex court, Justice Y.K. Sabharmal and Justice Tarun Chatterjee observed: ?By the impugned judgement, the high court has quashed the NRI/NRI-sponsored quota. In two colleges where the total intake of students is 200, 104 students have been admitted under NRI quota, which accounts for more than 50 per cent admissions.? 

 Justice Sabharmal and Justice Chatterjee further observed that: ?Regarding the interim arrangement to be made, we are of the view that no case has been made out to grant complete stay of the impugned judgement of the high court? However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we permit admission to NRI students in those two colleges to the extent of 15 per cent of the seats, that is, 15 students in each of the colleges, out of the 104 candidates who have been granted admission. To this extent, on merits, the admission of 30 students in all can continue subject to further orders that may be passed while disposing of the matter.?

 The interim arrangement brings the axe down on 74 of the 104 students already admitted to the MBBS course at two colleges, while at the same time offering some hope to all those candidates who had successfully cleared the Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE). 

 The apex court?s directive comes as a major embarrassment for the state government, which had been trying to admit students into the newly-set up Midnapore and SSKM medical colleges through the NRI quota by imposing a capitation fee of over Rs 9 lakh per candidate. The government will have to return over Rs 6 crore to those candidates who will not retain their NRI quota seats. 

 Delhi-based advocate Ghanshyam Joshi, on behalf of the respondents, sent a missive on Friday to the principal secretary of the state government, the chairperson of the central selection committee (medical), and the director of medical education, informing them of the development. ?The interim applications for clarification ? and/or recalling the earlier order dated October 29, 2004, were dismissed by the Supreme Court of India,? the message reads.

 The 104 students, screened from 1,300 through an entrance test, had forked out Rs 9.24 lakh each for an MBBS seat under the NRI quota at SSKM Hospital or the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital.

 On September 29, however, Calcutta High Court nullified the entire process, instructing that the seats be allocated to successful JEE candidates of that year.

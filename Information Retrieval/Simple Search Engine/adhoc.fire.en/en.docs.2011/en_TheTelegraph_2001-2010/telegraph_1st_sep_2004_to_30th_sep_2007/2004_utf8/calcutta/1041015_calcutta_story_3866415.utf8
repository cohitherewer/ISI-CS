The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Puja plate full

 The festive fever has hit the city hard, and restaurants around town are getting set to add to the mayhem with a bit of culinary magic of their own. Here are a couple of Puja platters that the Good Life could dig in to, with many more to follow:

Maharaja

 Choices in the Indian, Continental and Chinese sections at this multi-cuisine restaurant have been enhanced ahead of the Pujas. The 80-cover eatery near Rabindra Sadan serves up quite a bite for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.

 Cheese dominates the Continental selection. Both the Chicken Maringo and Chicken Princess are wrapped in cheese, while the veggie variation of this ? the Cauliflower Mornay ? is cooked in much the same way.

 The Chinese menu features steamed chicken dumplings for starters and Prawn Lemon Leaf Curry in the main course. Two green options are Red Curry Mixed Vegetable and Cheese and Corn Kernels.

 The Indian new entrants are Murg Shajahani cooked in cashewnut gravy, Bhuna Gosht, Paneer and Tawa Subji.

Aahvaan

Aahvaan , the 10th-floor banquet at Hotel Lindsay 

will be hosting a traditional Bengali food festival during the Pujas (picture

pm from Saptami to Dashami.

 The buffet spread includes Lal Saag, Moong Dal, Chholar Dal, Begun Bhaja, Aloo Bhaja or Potol Bhaja, Mukto Mukher Sukto, Potoler Dalna, Doi Potol, Aloo Phoolkopi, Rui Kalia, Doi Machh, Bhetki Paturi, Ilish Bhape, Chingri Malai Curry, Palang Murgi, Murgi Aloo Jhol and Kasha Mangsho, accompanied by rice or luchi. The sweet selection is Mishti Doi or Payesh, Kamala Bhog, Rasa Malai and Mishti Pan.

 The vegetarian thali comes for Rs 225, while the non-veg alternative is Rs 50 dearer. ?The roof-top restaurant Blue and Beyond has been open for a year and we have had great response. This inspired us to try the traditional Bengali spread as well,? explained Rahul Bhutoria, director, Hotel Lindsay.

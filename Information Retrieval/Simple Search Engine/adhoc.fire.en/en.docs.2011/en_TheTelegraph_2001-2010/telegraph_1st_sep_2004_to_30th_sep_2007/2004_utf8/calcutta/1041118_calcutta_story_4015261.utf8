 G?nter Grass: Strong Calcutta connection

 An evening of verse, an international panel discussion and an impromptu adda with college students mark the agenda of G?nter Grass? visit to Calcutta in January next year.

 The Nobel laureate writer, artist and committed interventionist in socio-political issues of global concern, will be visiting India for the first time after 1986, on the invitation of the Goethe-Institut, Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB).

 ?We are very proud he has accepted the invitation. Wherever Grass goes, be it in Europe or Latin America, it?s an event and it?ll be a great honour for us to host him in the city,? says Martin W?elde, MMB director. He feels it would be ?extremely interesting? to see how Grass renews his special relationship with Calcutta.

 ?MMB would like to bring Grass in contact with the Calcutta of here and now and not evoke any trip into the past, which Grass himself is not at all interested in. He would also not like to revert to his old texts during the events in this visit,? says S.V. Raman of the German cultural centre.

 His programme in the city will kick off with an evening of lyrics on January 25, where Grass will read a selection of his poems from Lyrische Beute (2004), which are being translated for the first time into Bengali for this event.

 The Bengali translations will be read by four prominent Bengali poets, who will also read from some of their own works. On January 27, Grass will be the pivotal speaker at an international panel discussion on ?The Segregation of Cultures in the Contemporary World. Clash, Convergence or Cooperation??.

 Among other panelists having confirmed their participation are writer Amitav Ghosh, Najam Sethi, editor of The Friday Times and Daily Times, Lahore, and T.N. Madan, sociologist and anthropologist specialised in religion. 

 Invites have also gone out to Arundhati Roy and Shirin Ebadi, Nobel laureate from Teheran. Grass rounds off his Calcutta visit with a face-to-face with students on the campus of a city college or university on January 31.

 After Danzig, perhaps no other city has had as great a significance in the life and works of Grass as Calcutta. His books Der Butt (The Flounder) and Zunge Zeigen (Show Me Your Tongue) bear this out. Grass had once said that one goes back to ?only those places that one loves?. 

 ?No other author, artist or intellectual from Germany has shown so much interest and commitment for India like G?nter Grass. To that extent, his third trip to India is not merely a coincidence, but rather a sign of great attachment to this country and the city of Calcutta, to which he owes a lot, as he had once said,? observes W?elde.

 In this electronic age, technology has provided many facilities which help us keep pace with the race of life. The option of offering anjali on the Internet is one such facility. Though such efforts are welcome, the truth is nothing can replace the feeling of reverence that overcomes the mind on stepping inside the pandal and facing the goddess, resplendent in all her splendour. It is this ambience that makes the experience of giving anjali a fulfilling one. An e-anjali is like making do with a second best option when the real thing is not available. Clicking on the screen to offer arati works for expatriate Indians in lands where no puja is taking place nearby. But otherwise, it can never be a substitute for anjali in the pandal.

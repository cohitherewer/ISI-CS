The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through the week without...

 Lighting your Diwali fire

If you?ve been acting like a Roman when in Calcutta, bet the best part of your 

annual bonus went down the Puja drain. So if Dhanteras looks lacklustre, make 

a style statement of your very own by turning off the splurge route. Practice 

rangoli to give a colourful welcome to the goddess so that she shines brighter 

the next time round. Also, scout for some innovative earthen lamps to light your 

fire on D-day.

Going over the moon, with a difference

Fasting and feasting for hubby dearest may not be quite your thing but now that 

the sati-savitri business is over and done with, take the liberty of turning 

Karwa Chawth on its head and mooning over your next-door neighbour for a change! 

It?s been a while since honeymoon, hasn?t it, and Starry, Starry Nights doesn?t 

sound the same, does it?

Believing bottoms up is the only way up

The Germans may have already drained their beer caskets this year, but the fun 

has just begun in this part of the world. One star hotel has declared November 

3 as the city?s date with Oktoberfest, but clearly no one?s playing by the rules, 

so why should you? Guzzle it down to your heart?s delight, belly be damned!

Cribbing about cricket, loud and clear

Shout out loud that you?ve just about had enough from a pampered, pathetic bunch 

of non-performers. ?In no other profession are failures felicitated and losers 

made lakhpatis (with a few zeros suffixed, at that)? My mother-in-law would 

be a better bet in the middle order? Batsmen who can?t bat and a keeper who can?t 

keep might as well stay in the dressing room? Team India would be better off with 

Gavaskar opening the batting than giving gyan? ? could be some of your 

sporting gaalis for the week. But then don?t forget to display your true-blue 

Bengali colours by singing praises of Shib Shankar Paul (so what if his nickname 

is Maco and he?s beefy without being Botham?).

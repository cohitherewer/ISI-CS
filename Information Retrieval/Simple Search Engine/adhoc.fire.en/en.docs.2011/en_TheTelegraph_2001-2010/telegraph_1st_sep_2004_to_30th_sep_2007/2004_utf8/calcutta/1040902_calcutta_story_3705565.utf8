 Memorial hedges for time

 - Victoria yet to put in place fee structure for walkers, visitors

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Victoria Memorial authorities on Wednesday sought more time from Calcutta High Court for examining the court-prescribed fees to be charged from morning-walkers and general visitors.

 We have not been able to introduce the fees the court wanted to become effective from Wednesday. It would be deeply appreciated if the court reconsidered the fee structure, said Bikash Bhattacharya, counsel for the Memorial authorities, before a division bench of Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice Tapan Dutt.

 The bench decided to hear the Memorial authorities case against the court-prescribed fees as and when it came up for hearing. We will hear the matter in due course, Justice Ganguly said.

 The development followed the Memorial authorities decision to have the issue mentioned in the court as part of an explanation for not introducing the prescribed fees for admission into the sprawling grounds.

 A few weeks ago, the division bench, after examining the recommendations of an experts committee, had asked the Memorial authorities to charge morning-walkers Rs 2 each and general visitors Rs 5 each. It also asked for introduction of a monthly card, priced at Rs 50, and an annual card, priced at Rs 500, for morning walkers.

 Environmentalist Subhas Duttas petition contested the authorities stand, arguing that it reflected their reluctance to take adequate measures for the upkeep of the Memorial. 

 By September 1, Dutta pointed out, the authorities were required to erect boards at various spots within and outside the premises, listing the dos and donts for visitors. 

 But the boards have not been put up, he lamented. I visited Victoria Memorial on Tuesday. No such boards were to be seen. Its clear the authorities are unwilling to follow the court directive. It is not clear how they are going to protect the structure.

 Dutta also pointed out that the police were yet to act on the expert panels recommendation that stalls within a 500-yard radius of the Memorial Hall be removed.

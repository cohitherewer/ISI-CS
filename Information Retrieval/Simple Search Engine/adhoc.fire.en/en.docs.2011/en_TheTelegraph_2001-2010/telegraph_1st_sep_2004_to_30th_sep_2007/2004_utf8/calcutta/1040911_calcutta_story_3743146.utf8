The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Car crawl at schools

The day after cops pledged to clear the snarls, Metro 

gets stuck in 5 study zones 

La Martiniere

Time: 1.30 pm

Roads to avoid: Rawdon Street, Loudon Street, 

AJC Bose Road-Beckbagan crossing, Minto Park extending into Sarat Bose Road

Picture of chaos: With a large number of schoolchildren 

being picked up by private cars, the snarl is unending. Cars waiting to pick up 

kids, cars waiting to get out with kids, cars honking to get out of the zone, 

a lone cop flailing his arms in futility?

Way out: Additional police presence at the 

school exits to monitor traffic flow; special traffic measures to ensure vehicles 

not picking up children are not forced to a halt.

South Point School

Time: noon, 3.15 pm, 5 pm

Roads to avoid: Mandeville Gardens, Swinhoe 

Street, Ekdalia Road, Ballygunge Place and Ballygunge Phari

Picture of chaos: The otherwise quiet residential 

locality is transformed into a battle zone as schoolbuses and private cars struggle 

to outmanoeuvre each other. The left flank is clogged by cars parked to pick up 

kids, another illegal ?parking lot? has sprung up at the Ekdalia end 

Way out: School authorities to disallow private 

cars from being parked outside the gates. Police to ensure the no-parking zone 

is not violated.

Shri Shikshayatan-Sakhawat Memorial Girl?s School 

Time: 3.15 pm

Roads to avoid: Lord Sinha Road, Shakespeare 

Sarani, Little Russel Street

Picture of chaos: Private cars parked illegally 

along the left flank of Lord Sinha Road as the schools give over at 3.20 pm and 

3.50 pm, respectively.

Way out: Police should ensure that one leg 

of the traffic not linked to school pick-up keeps moving.

Loreto House

Time: Noon to 1.45 pm

Roads to avoid: Middleton Street-Middleton 

Row-Camac Street zone

Picture of chaos: Fleet of cars parked here, 

there, everywhere.

Way out: Traffic police pickets at strategic 

intersections.

St James-Pratt Memorial schools

Time: 1 pm

Road to avoid: The stretch between the Moulali 

intersection and the Park Street-Mullickbazar intersection on AJC Bose Road

Picture of chaos: Movement stalled by stream 

of private cars and school minibuses, three lanes thick, around the school exits.

Way out: Police to regulate traffic flow along 

AJC Bose Road; school authorities to instruct guardians not to park near the school.

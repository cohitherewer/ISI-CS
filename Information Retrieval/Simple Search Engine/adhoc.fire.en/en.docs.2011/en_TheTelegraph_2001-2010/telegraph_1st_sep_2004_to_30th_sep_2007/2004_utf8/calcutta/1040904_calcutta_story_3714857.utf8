 War over dues keeps channels off

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Claims, counter-claims, allegations and denials. As the war of words continued between Zee-Turner and SitiCable on one side and RPG Netcom on the other, around eight lakh cable subscribers went without some of their favourite channels for the second day on Friday. Zee-Turner blacked off its beam on RPG Netcoms network on Thursday, claiming dues of Rs 7 crore.

 SitiCable, the multi-system operator belonging to the Zee stable, felt that RPG Netcom was unnecessarily dragging it into the issue. There is no reason to involve us, said Soumen Roy Chowdhury, vice-president of SitiCable. The claim that we pay less to Zee-Turner is absolutely false, since we pay at the rate of Rs 55, he asserted.

 There is pressure on cable operators from viewers. Its always difficult to explain a switchoff to subscribers, since they make regular payments, said one in Bangur. Apart from Alpha Bangla and Cartoon Network, pressure regarding CNBC is expected on Monday, when the stock markets open, he added.

 RPG Netcom, however, isnt shifting from its stand. We are trying our best to settle the issue as quickly as possible, said CEO Amit Nag, but theres no question of paying what is not due.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A putt as pastime and passion

It?s serious swinging in the morning and glow ga-ga 

once twilight descends, as Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), the oldest golfing 

greens outside the British Isles, tees off its 175th anniversary gala in style.

If city-bred champ Arjun Atwal, the first Indian in 

the USPGA Tour, was the cynosure in the first session on Saturday, the candle-lit 

fairways of the Royal was to see a blast after dark with 60 couples assembling 

for a ?shotgun start? as Calcutta welcomed glow-golf for the first time.

After the solemn beginning, the real fun begins in 

the evening when the glow-golf couples get together at 6 pm for the city?s maiden 

tryst with the fluorescent spectacle.

?Imagine hitting a ball without knowing what lies 

underneath,? quips Brandon D?Souza, Tiger Sports Marketing president and tournament 

director for the celebrations presented by Airtel in association with The Telegraph, 

and featuring 16 other Royal Clubs.

D?Souza remembers Kapil Dev (at RCGC in picture ) 

having fired up a chunk of earth after having missed the glowing ball completely 

with his first swing at the Delhi Golf Club.

Kaps and Leander Paes will be feted as part of the 

celebrations next Saturday, to coincide with the first round of the invitees? 

meet.

The tee-off on Saturday night fever though continues 

well into the night with DJ music and dinner to set the tone for the commemoration 

cavalcade.

O Calcutta Nite will feature music of the 70s on Thursday. 

Old Firpo?s music by Pam Crain and Don Saigal is billed to be a big draw. Usha 

Uthup will take centre stage on the last day, November 28.

?We have had an overwhelming response to the seniors 

meet, with 220-plus entries till date,? adds Satbinder Singh, golf convenor. 

Singh also thanks the Royal Calcutta Turf Club for 

its ?wonderful gesture? of incorporating two special races for the event.

The course, the shamiana, locker rooms, the 

19th Bar and the club?s Maidan bowling greens have all got a facelift.

Star guests include the 250-year-old Royal amp; Ancient 

Golf Club of St Andrews, the 125-year-old Royal Colombo Golf Club, the Royal Ashdown 

Forest, Royal Belfast, Royal Perth and Royal Liverpool.

National names include Bangalore Golf Club, Bombay 

Presidency and Madras Gymkhana.

A host of corporate honchos would also be around to 

drive home the point that golf means business. Something Bengal could sure do 

with.

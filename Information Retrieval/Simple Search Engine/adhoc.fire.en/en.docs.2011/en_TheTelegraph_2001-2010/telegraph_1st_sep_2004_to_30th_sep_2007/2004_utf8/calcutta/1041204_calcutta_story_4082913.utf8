 Mystery fever from far away

 - Meningitis-like symptoms baffle doctors

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Four-year-old Mohit is down with fever, contracts conjunctivitis in both eyes and his hands swell. Doctors diagnose meningitis. But as the child?s condition deteriorates by the day, they realise that they have a difficult case on hand.

 Investigations reveal Mohit?s heart muscles have swollen along with his skin, eyes, lungs and lymph nodes ? all symptoms of the dreaded Kawasaki disease. The disease shares some of its symptoms with a particular type of meningitis (inflammation of brain and spinal cord membranes), causing confusion among doctors. 

 First detected among Japanese children (mostly below five years) in 1967, the disease is now stalking Asia and Europe, with several cases being reported from Calcutta. 

 ?Still considered a rarity, we have come across Kawasaki cases in the city. Doctors should not confuse it with meningitis,? warned cardiac surgeon Ajay Kaul. 

 According to paediatric cardiologist Biswajit Bandyopadhyay, five to six cases of the disease are being detected in the city every two months. 

 Though researchers have deciphered a genetic factor in the disease, Kawasaki Syndrome is still considered a mystery. 

 It starts with destroying the body?s medium-sized arteries through inflammation of blood vessels and then damages cardiac coronary arteries, causing an abnormal dilation or bulge. ?The damaged arteries can hinder blood flow to the heart and can even cause a heart attack,? cardiac surgeon Kaul warned. 

 In advanced countries like the USA, more than 300 cases are reported a year, 80 per cent of the victims being children of around five.

 The disease manifests itself with the following symptoms:

 High fever for four-five days Conjunctivitis 

in both eyes Cracked lips and inflammation of lips and throat Swelling 

and redness of the skin on the palms and soles A rash on the torso 

Heart rhythm abnormalities Signs of heart failure Swollen glands 

in the neck Pain and swelling of the joints Diarrhoea and vomiting 

 Weakness of facial muscles.

 The disease is treated with a dose of gamma globulin, a collection of proteins and antibodies from donated blood. The medication is administered intravenously. Some doctors prefer aspirin drugs.

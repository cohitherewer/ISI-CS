The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hunt on for Hawn

Is Goldie Hawn in India? That?s the million-dollar 

question vexing film fans at the moment. She first came to India in 1980 and has 

since returned a few times to the country that she reportedly loves. Oscar-winning 

Hollywood actress Hawn (seen with family ) was last seen here in 1996, making 

the documentary In the Wild: With Elephants for the US television channel 

PBS (Public Broadcasting System), on the status of the animals in South Asia (available 

on DVD and video). 

 Taking her on a guided tour was elephant activist Mark Shand, author of books like River Dog: A Journey Along The Brahmaputra and Skulduggery. Goldie had been introduced to Tara, the star of Shand?s book Travels on My Elephant, eight years ago. Shand chronicles his journey from Konarak to the elephant market in Sonepur in the Gangetic delta, with photographer friend Aditya Patankar and a motley crew including a mahout and a former circus performer. Tara was then housed in Kipling Camp, Kanha National Park.

Kipling Camp authorities told Metro that Tara 

is doing very well in her home, and a spokesperson from the NGO Elephant Family 

(of which Shand is the director) said over phone from the UK that the intrepid 

adventurer and author is in India on another trip at the moment. 

But the real news is that Hello magazine spotted Hawn with the younger son of her partner actor Kurt Russell, 24-year-old Boston, at Heathrow airport, on October 22, on her way to India, dressed in all white. She hasn?t stopped by in Kanha to say hi to Tara yet, but chances are that if she needs help on Indian turf, Hawn will turn to her activist friend, Shand.

 According to reports, the 59-year-old grandmother (courtesy daughter Kate Hudson) is back in India for an update on the status of the elephants for PBS. But no one seems to have spotted her yet. So where is the blonde babe? Deep in the jungles for a dose of life in the wild or camping out in a five-star hotel somewhere? Any guesses?

 Hawn has been a supporter of Asian elephants for a while, as has actress Meg Ryan, who did a documentary on the animals in Thailand. She has been out of movie action for a while, her last appearance having been in The Banger Sisters (2002), co-starring Susan Sarandon and Geoffrey Rush.

Hawn?s affinity for India and all things Indian has 

been evident before in her trips to Dharamshala, with Richard Gere, to support 

the Tibetan cause of a free country. In fact, for Michael Douglas and Catherine 

Zeta-Jones? wedding in 2000 (picture right), she wore a red sari .

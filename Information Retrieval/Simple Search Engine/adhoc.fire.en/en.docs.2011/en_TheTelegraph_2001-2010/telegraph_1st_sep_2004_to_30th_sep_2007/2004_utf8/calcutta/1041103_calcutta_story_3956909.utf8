 Jail warder under scanner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A warder and a discipline officer at Presidency jail were showcaused on Tuesday for smuggling in 66 packets of cannabis for the inmates. 

 Several crimelords, including Gabbar and Sheikh Vinod, are lodged in the jail. 

 The incident comes close on the heels of a warder being chargesheeted for dereliction of duty in connection with the death of Babulal Sharma, a key accused in the murder of former Dum Dum municipality chairman Sailen Das, in Dum Dum Central jail. 

 ?Gross indiscipline among the 4,000-odd warders, assigned to oversee the well-being of inmates in various jails, has been plaguing the administration. The indiscipline has to be curbed at any cost,? observed a senior jail official.

 Samir Roy, the showcaused warder of Presidency jail, was caught carrying cannabis on Tuesday morning. 

 ?He confessed to jailer Nazrul Islam that he had smuggled in the contraband in collusion with discipline officer A. Salam against hefty payment by some inmates,? the official added.

 Salam, who was manning the gate, was showcaused for not searching Roy during his entry. ?Had he been searched, the cannabis might have been discovered,? the official said. Deputy inspector-general (prisons) Ramapada Bhattacharya said he would seek details of the case from the jail superintendent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bold tamers of the tide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The navy is all set to build a disaster management hub in Calcutta for better handling of natural disasters in the state.

 ?We have prepared a feasibility report and are waiting for the defence ministry?s nod,? Commodore A.K. Patnaik, naval officer-in-charge (West Bengal), told Metro on Thursday.

 ?Whenever a natural calamity strikes this part of the country, we have no option but to wait for life-saving equipment and rescuers to arrive from Visakhapatnam. Precious time is lost during transit. So, the navy has decided to set up a disaster management centre in the city,? Commodore Patnaik explained.

 The proposal envisages setting up a seven-member team, comprising an officer and six sailors. All are expert divers and are adept at sailing in rubberised craft with heavy equipment. ?Once the hub is set up, we will be able to jump into action immediately after getting news of a disaster,? the Commodore emphasised.

 Earlier in the day, on the sidelines of a press conference during the Navy Week celebrations, Commodore Patnaik said two fast attack craft, designed at Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, will be launched this month. They will be commissioned in a year. 

 The high-speed vessels, which can carry small guns, are part of a security arrangement being worked out for the coastlines, he said.

 Between April and September 2002, navy vessels had escorted 22 ?high-value? US ships through the Malacca Straits. The force had also provided security at the request of Mozambique during the second African Union Summit in July 2003.

 Commodore Patnaik said the force is engaged in exercises with all major navies of the world, including Australia, France, Russia and the USA. 

 To meet operational commitments, the navy is constantly updating its wherewithal. Acquisitions in the near future will include aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov, along with its squadron of MiG 29K aircraft, Scorpene submarines and ASW Corvettes (being built in Calcutta).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 Don?t let your talents go unnoticed. Life is certain 

to throw up a lot of challenges, but you will meet them squarely. You are a lively, 

positive person who inspires others. Your intuition stands you in good stead. 

You like to work at a steady pace. A foreign trip or a new course of study is 

on the cards. ? Kusum Bhandari

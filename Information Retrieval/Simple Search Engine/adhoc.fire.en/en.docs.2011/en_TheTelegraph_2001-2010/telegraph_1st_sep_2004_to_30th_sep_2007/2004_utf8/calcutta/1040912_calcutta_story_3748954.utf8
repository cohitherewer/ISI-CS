 Stage, through stages

 The Oxford Companion to Indian Theatre, a comprehensive survey of the various urban and folk forms practised in India spanning more than 2,000 years, will adorn bookshelves later this month. The weighty tome, running into 580-odd pages with 750 entries and 270 illustrations, aims to fill the need for an exhaustive guide on Indian theatre.

 ?It?s the first attempt to put together information on the various forms of theatre practised in rural and urban India. I have included all forms that are related to any kind of performing art,? says Prof. Ananda Lal of Jadavpur University, English department, and editor of the Companion.

 Oral narration, puppetry, mime, and specific forms like kathakali, chhau and Marathi kirtan have all found mention.

 ?Indian theatre has not been researched extensively and as a result there is lack of primary material. I have covered all major Indian languages in which theatre is practised. For instance, there?s Kashmiri, Konkani and Dogri. But the aim is not to analyse any idea,? explains Lal.

 The chronological pattern of the encyclopaedia kicks off with the ritualistic dialogues of the Rig Veda, then flowing on to the Sanskrit playwrights. A lot of archaeological evidence has also been attached with entries (for instance, artist?s impressions of 3rd Century BC cave theatres of Madhya Pradesh and the amphitheatres of Nagarjunkonda).

 Apart from proscenium theatre, street theatre, children?s theatre, third theatre and theatre for social development have also made their way into the volume. 

 ?There is a long discussion on Indian cinema, the relation between film and stage in the pre-Independence era? and the contribution of personalities like Utpal Dutt, Shambhu Mitra and Naseeruddin Shah (in picture above with wife Ratna Shah). And the illustrations and photographs documented are of archival value,? adds the theatre critic.

 The book also includes theatre personalities and their work. But picking a few and leaving out some has been a difficult task, confesses Lal, who has had to restrict the contemporary period to Mahesh Dattani. 

 Lal started out by identifying specialists in the field and ended up enlisting 63 of them across the country whose contributions have been incorporated. ?When I approached the commissioning editor of Oxford University Press around seven years ago, I had expected her to reject it as the project involved a huge investment,? he smiles.

 Though the book will primarily be reference material for students, researchers and scholars in theatre studies, a layman can access it, too, as it is rid off jargons, assures the editor.

 The Companion will be unveiled at the British Council, Delhi, on September 14.

Pretty girl with an eye on goal

 When Hrithik Roshan and Farhan Akhtar hugged her after the premiere of Lakshya for making the film look so good, Keya Banerjee (picture right by Pabitra Das) knew she had got close to her goal.

 Successfully mapping the uncharted territory called visual effects supervision in Bollywood has dragged this pretty, petite younger daughter of actor Victor Banerjee into the limelight.

 For Keya has made Preity Zinta sit in front of the Bofors gun and Hrithik climb a steep cliff, all in the post-production studio. ?Ask me something else please, other than the Bofors gun and the rock-climbing scenes,? she pleads, tired of explaining over and over again how she created a mountain in Mumbai and then did the rest through computers.

 Fine, but how did she slip behind the camera when posing in front of it was the more obvious option? ?The day I saw a computer I fell in love with it. I knew I had to do something with it and visuals. But it all really began when my parents gifted me a multimedia course after school,? says the 27-year-old who graduated in anthropology and sociology from St Xavier?s College, Mumbai, after finishing school in Mussourie.

 On her return from the US, where she took a degree from Harvard University in visual effects, Keya joined UTV in Mumbai as a graphics trainee. There, she was assigned the visual effects for 25 episodes of Shararat, a TV serial, which paved the way for Lakshya.

 ?While I was getting a hang of the industry, I realised that a lot of problems at the postproduction stage could be avoided on the sets itself. So, I decided to supervise work during the shooting,? says Keya.

 The first step to her Lakshya involved long, extensive discussions with Farhan, chalking out the shots, angles and the storyboard with sequences that required special effects. From then on, Keya camped with the crew at Ladakh, supervising each shot on the sets. ?I would look for glitches. Sometimes, a hidden wire would come out which may not be visible to the director, but I would have the shot taken again as this would pose a problem later.?

 During post-production, her job involved monitoring the scanning, recording and graphics. ?For the scene where a chopper flies through a grassland, I took still images of Ladakh and layered them to create a whole image? Farhan gave me complete creative control,? adds Keya.

 The whole point was to ensure that her special effects look real on screen. ?If my work shows, the entire purpose is defeated? When my mother (Maya) is happy with my work, I feel great,? adds the girl, whose favourite celluloid work in terms of stunning special effects is Lord of the Rings.

 Talks are on for a few more feature films but before all that Keya has something special to take care of ?she?s tying the knot on October 3, during an action-packed three-day bash organised by her dad at Hrishikesh.

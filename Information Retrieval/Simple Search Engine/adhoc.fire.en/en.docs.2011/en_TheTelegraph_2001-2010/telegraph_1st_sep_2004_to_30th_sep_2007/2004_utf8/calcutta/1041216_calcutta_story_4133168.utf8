 Creativity in the classroom: The earlier the better, when it comes to toddlers 

exploring their talents

 A song-and-dance solving the mystery of the whys and wherefores of caterpillars, butterflies and moths, by two ladybirds named Sherlock and Watson. It was a show definitely for the kids, but by the teachers. That was the graduation programme by the students of Academy of Progressive Montessori on Wednesday, showcasing some of what they had learnt during the course. 

 Started over a year ago on Purna Das Road, there were 22 students accepting their diploma course on Wednesday, from grandmothers to 20-somethings looking for careers as Montessori teachers. Also present was Roger Edwards Bragg, who conducted two workshops on Tuesday at the academy. 

 The subject of the workshop was the principles of mind-mapping applied to Montessori learning ? ?a thinking and organisational tool through association and creativity?, explained the UK-based man who has been to Calcutta off and on for the past two decades. 

 Apart from the fact that the education scenario has changed in the city over the years, Bragg, now associated with the Swiss training company Ascom, says it is more a question of letting kids in the classroom develop their creativity rather than putting them under too much pressure. 

 ?There are two ways of doing it. Either talk to them and expect the children to follow, or treat them as individuals, with respect, and involve them in the process,? he adds. ?Although Montessori is not accepted by the Indian government, over time, people are realising the importance of the system.?

 The Academy of Progressive Montessori aims to do just that, by spreading the word among teachers. In October, 16 students and teachers of the elementary and foundation courses went on a trip to Thailand. In five days, they visited three schools in Bangkok, at nursery and Montessori levels.

 ?We learnt a lot of things, particularly how important hygiene is,? says Shalini Sunderlal, of the academy. The plan is to disseminate the information among Montessorians through a newsletter, which will be out in January. Also on the cards is regular guest lectures. ?Mr Bragg was the first. Hopefully, we can continue it,? signs off Sunderlal.

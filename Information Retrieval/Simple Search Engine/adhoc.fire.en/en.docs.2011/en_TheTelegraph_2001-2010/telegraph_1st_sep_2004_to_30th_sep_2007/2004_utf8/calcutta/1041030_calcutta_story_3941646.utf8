 Seat solution for MBBS

 - Apex court sets 15 per cent for NRIs, rest for merit list

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Some students admitted to the MBBS course in Bengal under the NRI quota will find their way into the classroom, after all, along with another batch from the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) merit list.

 On Friday, a Supreme Court division bench of Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justice Tarun Chatterjee held that 15 per cent of the seats at two medical colleges would be reserved for NRI/NRI-sponsored students. 

 The rest, earlier filled by the same section, would now be left open to students short-listed in the JEE.

 The order has been sent to the state health department with a copy forwarded to the chairman of the Central Selection Committee that looks after the admission of students who have cleared JEE in both the engineering and medical streams. 

 ?We are yet to receive the order. By Monday, it should reach us and we will then decide on our next step,? said Prabhakar Chatterjee, director of health services. 

 The order comes in the wake of the state?s appeal to the apex court against a previous high court directive that the seats in question be filled by applicants figuring in the JEE merit list.

 A batch of students, including Chayan Kumar Roy and Soumyadeep Datta Roy, argued against the state government filling up more than 50 per cent of the newly created seats in the state-run SSKM Hospital in Calcutta and Midnapur Medical College.

 Senior counsel and former additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi, appearing for the aggrieved students, alleged that the state government had ?surreptitiously? filled up 104 of the 200 seats in these two colleges, violating the high court order.

 Rohtagi argued that NRI students who gained admission over and above the 15 per cent ceiling, would now have to make way for ?meritorious? students like the present petitioners (respondents in the Supreme Court).

 The Bengal government had thrown open 200 seats for admission under the MBBS course at SSKM and Midnapur Medical College earlier this year. Of these, 150 seats were reserved for NRI students selected through a separate admission test. They were asked to pay Rs 9.24 lakh for admission.

 But with the Medical Council of India dragging its feet on recognising both these colleges for conducting undergraduate courses in medicine, 45 students opted out. 

 Friday?s interim order would kick-start a selection process from 300-odd students who had their hopes dashed after the JEE merit list was out.

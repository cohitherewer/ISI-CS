The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wed in high style at star address

 - Hospitality industry pulls out all plugs to host marriages amp; reap benefits

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Elaborate buffets piled with the finest food from across the globe and around India, champagne and cocktails doing the rounds as guests lounge around an elegantly decorated ballroom, plush carpets padding stilettoed feet bustling around the bride and groom decked up in designer finery.

 What has become the best way to make a style and status statement ? tying the nuptial knot in a five star ? is also bread, butter and jam for the hospitality industry.

 With the average annual number of weddings held at the main star addresses hovering at around 50 each, a sizeable chunk of their revenue also comes from the marriage mayhem. ITC Sonar Bangla played host to 40 weddings, bringing in 60 per cent of its revenue last year. Taj Bengal?s 70 weddings raked in around 55 per cent of the cash flow. A hundred wedding and wedding-related events at The Park contributed 45 per cent of business.

 This might seem rather disproportionate, but these are evenings where splendour is the driving force and the price tag is almost incidental. The bill for d?cor and lights alone can run into lakhs, leave alone mandaps and shamianas. The cost per plate can range anywhere between Rs 700 and Rs 3,000 for a capacity of anything between 150 and 3,000 guests. The array of exotic wines is billed separately.

 ?Most hotels in Calcutta will shut down if they stop hosting weddings,? says Modhurima Sinha, spokesperson, Taj Bengal, where 50 weddings are already booked this year. ?While Bengali marriages are economical, extravagance tops the priority list as far as Marwari weddings go. Starting at around Rs 10 lakh, such marriages can run into crores,? adds Shyama Mishra, spokesperson, Hyatt Regency. Hyatt hosted 35 weddings last year, and is likely to better the figure this fiscal. It is already house-full at ITC Sonar Bangla, with all auspicious marriage dates having been snapped up.

 With a calendar so full, it is best to plan in advance. The peak period is between November to February, with some scheduled between April and July. The all-in-one venue is the big raw ? besides the star status, of course ? for parents of the bride or groom. ?Do think about the safety and service provided at five-star hotels. You get everything under one roof,? stresses Ranvir Bhandari, general manager, ITC Sonar Bangla. 

 Hassle and headaches are avoided through the one-window (or close to it) option. ?We have our own set of people who take you through the entire process,? explains Bhandari.

 The only restrictions that come with the comfort are something like this ? food amp; beverage provided by the hotel only (ITC Sonar Bangla, Taj Bengal and Hyatt Regency); independent caterers allowed, but don?t carry your own booze (The Park).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without...

Saying you?ve been to Sourav?s

Being seen at the launch of Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion was a matter of status. 

But if that little badge of honour (read: the entry pass) didn?t come your way 

for the Thursday lunch, don?t lose your appetite. Just make sure you check out 

20G Park Street this week. If nothing else, do spend some time at One Day, the 

24-hour coffee shop on the first floor, or Prince of Cal, the lounge bar on the 

top floor. If one is big and bright, the other is dim and stylised. So, give the 

CCDs and the Shisha Bars the miss for once and step into the captain?s kitchen.

Surfing the new channels on air

Quite a few to choose from, provided you get them all. STAR One has to be on top 

of the list. The latest from the STAR stable provides a welcome break from the 

saas-bahu soaps and a stronger focus on the urban youth. The kids? channel 

Hungama is another new entry that deserves a dekho. Home-grown programmes 

are the channel?s strength. Also, tune in to Discovery Travel amp; Living for 

a glimpse of the good life and a lifestyle take on this, that and the other.

Going ballistic about bandhs

Enough is enough. Shout out loud as shutdown countdown grips the city. Three bandhs 

in three weeks (November 17, November 22 and December 3) is a bit three much for 

even the lazy Calcuttan to take lying down. Just as the city was switching back 

into work mode comes the horrid bandh hat-trick. Events to emergencies, business 

takes a beating and life takes a backseat ? unless, of course, you put your words 

into action, defy the bandh call and treat it as just another day in?

 Embarking on a biryani binge

After all the mithai mania during Diwali, it?s biryani time this 

week. Give the restaurants a slip and go for home-made authentic flavours. If 

you don?t have one yet, quick, befriend someone who can whip up an Id special 

with melt-in-the-mouth rice repast. Just go the whole handi.

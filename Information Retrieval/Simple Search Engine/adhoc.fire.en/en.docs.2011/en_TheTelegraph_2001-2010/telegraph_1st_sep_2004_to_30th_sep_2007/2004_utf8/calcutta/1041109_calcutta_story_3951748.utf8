Behind the bar

Shaun Kenworthy - Executive chef, The Park

Yellow, brown, black? it?s all beer. It may come with 

all sorts of names and packages but it?s all a fermentation of hops, wheat or 

other grains. 

I used to work in a restaurant in Manchester about 

10 years ago that had a micro-brewery running over four floors ? one floor for 

each stage and would take between four to six weeks. The four beers we brewed 

were a German-style beer, a wheat beer which was slightly cloudy, a peach beer 

which had a slight taste of peaches and a blackcurrant stout which was black with 

a good, creamy head. 

I?ve found myself playing around with beer in food 

preparations over the years. Beef in Guinness is an old British favourite. I?ve 

even made beer ice cream and lager and lime sorbet in the past which were both 

big winners, let me assure you. Here?s an idea for a cocktail you can try for 

a bit of fun, but I have no idea what to call it. I also fancy the idea of making 

maybe a Beer Bloody Mary?

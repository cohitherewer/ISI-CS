 Molestation charge against Jadavpur hospital guard

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 32-year-old woman accompanying her sick father to the government-run Bagha Jatin State General Hospital, in Jadavpur, was allegedly molested on Kali puja night (November 11) by a private security guard. Barely two days ago, a married woman was molested at Karimpur block hospital, Nadia, by a Group-D employee while she was sleeping in the male ward, a few feet from her husband, admitted there with diarrhoea. 

 The Bagha Jatin hospital case came to light on Tuesday when over a hundred residents of the area demonstrated in front of the hospital, demanding that the guard be arrested. The demonstrators were led by local Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy. 

 They later handed a memorandum to acting superintendent Archita Biswas, requesting her to probe the matter. ?We requested Biswas to see to it that the security guard is debarred from joining work,? said MLA Roy. 

 Though both the hospital authorities and the victim lodged complaints with Jadavpur police a day after the incident, sleuths have so far done nothing on this score. They said the accused has been absconding since Kali puja night.

 According to police, the woman, a resident of Rabindra Pally, took her father, Gopal Mondal, who complained of abdominal pain, to hospital with the help of neighbours around 2.30 am on November 11, and admitted him there. Though Mondal?s wife Jyotsna was allowed to stay beside the patient, the victim was asked to wait outside in a hall. Accordingly, she sat on a bench in an empty hall.

 The victim, during interrogation, told police that Shankar Chakraborty, who was on duty in the hospital, first sat beside her and then grabbed her in spite of the resistance she put up. 

 ?Freeing herself from the clutches of the security guard, the woman ran to a nearby club where Kali puja was being held. She told club members about the trouble she was in, when all of them ran to the hospital,? said a police officer during the day.

 Sensing trouble, the accused escaped in the dark and is yet to be traced. ?Though we conducted raids in various places, the man is still absconding,? said a senior officer. Bibhu Nandi, a neighbour of the victim, said Chakraborty had approached the woman the next day and offered her Rs 3,000 so that she dropped the charges brought against him. She also alleged that the local CPM legislator put pressure on her to withdraw her complaint against the security guard. 

 However, the CPM leadership dismissed the allegation and said no party worker was involved in the hospital molestation incident. 

 Hospital superintendent Biswas said a complaint was lodged with Jadavpur police station. ?We have asked the supervisor not to allow Chakraborty to join work,? she said.

 Additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Subarno said police were looking into the victim?s and the hospital authorities? complaints. ?I have asked the officer-in-charge of Jadavpur police station to make a thorough inquiry and take necessary steps,? he said.

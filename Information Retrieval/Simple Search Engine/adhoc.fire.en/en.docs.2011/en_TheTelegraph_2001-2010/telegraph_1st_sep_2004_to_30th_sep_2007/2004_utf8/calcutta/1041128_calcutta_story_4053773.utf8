Little dog, big attitude

Nilanjanaa

Hope you enjoyed your sojourn into the wildlife with 

my sister Chandana. Now, let?s get back to basics. I would like to re-introduce 

you to the spunky little dog with such a personality ? the Pomeranian. Throughout 

history, this tiny puffball with its happy pleasant nature has been a companion 

for royalty and common folk alike. 

Origin: The Pomeranian is a toy-sized descendant 

of the Nordic Spitz family which also includes the Samoyed, Siberian Husky, Alaskan 

Malamute, Chow Chow and American Eskimo, to name a few. Prior to being bred down 

to the present size, their ancestors were used by the Nordic people to pull sledges.

The breed received its name from Pomerania (located 

on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea) from where it hails. Until the late 1880s, 

the breed was not well-known, but its popularity soared after Queen Victoria took 

an interest. As proof of her love, the Queen wanted her favourite Pomeranian, 

Turi, to be present at her deathbed.

Characteristics: It is a compact, short-backed, 

active dog with pricked ears, foxy face, a thick double coat and a fluffy, high 

tail. Males are seven to nine inches in height and upto 4 kg in weight, while 

females are around five inches in height and weigh around 2 kg. 

The Pomeranian can be found in shades of white, cream, 

red, sable, black, tan as well as combinations like chocolate and tan, brindle, 

beaver. They are also particoloured ? white dogs with patches of one of the above 

colours on the body.

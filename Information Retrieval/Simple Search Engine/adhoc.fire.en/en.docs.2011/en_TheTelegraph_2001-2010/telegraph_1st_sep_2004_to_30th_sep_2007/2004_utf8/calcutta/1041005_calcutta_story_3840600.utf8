 Calcutta is setting its bar rather high these days. Every event calls for a Mumbai name to add the glamour component and last weekend was no different.

 While Katrina Kaif was at Tantra on Friday night, Sunday evening saw half a dozen Mumbai names walking the ramp at the annual leather trade show organised by Indian Leather Products Association, and hosted by Hyatt Regency.

 Calcutta happily opens its gates to classier, lankier lasses from the glamour capital of the country and except for a small dose of city names (usually Sanjukta and Sreshtha, sometimes an occasional third), Mumbai is ruling the city ramp.

 The show on Sunday was a conglomeration of products from 13 leather exporting companies. The core exhibits were bags in all possible shapes, sizes and colours ? from chic sequinned leather slings to Shantiniketan specialities.

 Only one of the participants, Rishi Exports, showcased a collection of short skirts and bikini tops for women and black leather trousers and jackets for men. 

 The biggest hit was a kids? leather accessories line, brought to the ramp by Tria Trend. As the popular Las Ketchup song played and a bunch of four to 10-year-olds danced their way onto the ramp, the audience just didn?t stop clapping.

 Sari shimmer

 Yet another festive collection from a city boutique. The latest offering is from Rozelle, a Park Street sari store, which unveiled its collection of saris featuring antique embroidery from western India. 

 The ensemble celebrates the colour and romance that was prevalent among the royal houses of Rajasthan and Gujarat. The opulent lifestyle and attire of the Maharanis is reflected in the clothes on display.

 ?The craze at the moment are the filmi and saas-bahu saris. The red and black sequinned sari which was draped on Sushmita Sen in Main Hoon Na is a rage with our customers and we have received umpteen orders for it,? said Arun Diwan, director Rozelle Saris. Other popular numbers include the Kumkum sari and the Tulsi sari. 

 A-line and umbrella cut lehngas with kathiawad embroidery and colourful Mewar kundan work are also part of the collection. 

 The use of stark bright prints in reds, oranges, lime greens and pinks with interesting sequin work and beads lend a dressy, chic look. 

 ?Our clients are always asking for heavy embroidery which requires greater manual work,? added Diwan.

 Indian georgettes and crepes are priced at Rs 2,000 upwards, while their Italian counterpart costs Rs 4,500 upwards.

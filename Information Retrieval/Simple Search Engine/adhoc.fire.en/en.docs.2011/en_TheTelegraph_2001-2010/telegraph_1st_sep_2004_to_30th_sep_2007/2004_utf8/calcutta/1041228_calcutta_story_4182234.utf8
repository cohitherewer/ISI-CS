?From the ship, the jetty was visible one moment and then gone the next ? sucked in, with the few cars and the small knot of fishermen on it, by the awesome wave,? recounted Nandini Chakraborty.

The resident of south Calcutta, along with her parents 

and five-year-old son, had just set off on a Sunday morning cruise from the fisheries? 

jetty in Port Blair, when the tsunami struck. ?I will never forget that sight,? 

said Nandini, at Calcutta airport on Monday afternoon.

 The Chakrabortys were among those streaming into Calcutta on the four flights that landed from Port Blair.

 If 319 passengers were put into three Alliance Air flights on Monday, Jet Airways brought back 121. ?No matter how many flights you operate now, they will be inadequate. Thousands are waiting outside our terminal,? said Arpan Sanyal, airport manager at Port Blair.

 Among those waiting anxiously for word at Calcutta airport were family members of 61 students from Loyola School in Jamshedpur. ?The authorities have been unable to provide us with any information,? said Kalpana Mitra, whose niece Rijuta Dey is stranded there.

 Even as the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government pledged Rs 70 lakh-worth of relief material, including clothes, blankets and tarpaulins to the Andamans, the islands ? and many others near and far ? were rendered off-limits for New Year crowds.

 Aniruddha Sinha, managing director of Peerless Resorts, said 75 per cent of the bookings for Port Blair had been cancelled. ?A majority of our New Year bookings has been cancelled,? Sinha said.

 The tsunami effect has taken a travel toll further off, as well. There are hardly any takers for the Star Cruise from Singapore to Phuket any more. ?The ship on Sunday had to change course towards Lankavi, instead of Phuket,? said Rajkumar Karmakar of Thomas Cook.

 Manoj Saraf of Gainwell Travels said they were advising potential travellers against visiting places like Phuket, Sri Lanka, Krabi and Bali.

 ?Tours to Bangkok and Singapore are on, but people are avoiding island destinations like Malaysia, Phuket and Pattaya,? admitted Sanjoy Sett, regional chairman of Travellers Agents Association of India (TAAI).

 At Discovery Travels, all 75 bookings for Bali in January have been cancelled. ?We?ve sent about 120 tourists from Calcutta to Southeast Asian destinations. Those on their way to Bali and Phuket have been diverted to Bangkok,? said Prashant Binani.

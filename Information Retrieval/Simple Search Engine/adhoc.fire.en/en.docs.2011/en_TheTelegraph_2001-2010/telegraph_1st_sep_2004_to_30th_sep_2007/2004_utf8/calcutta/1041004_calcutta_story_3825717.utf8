The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mirror, mirror on make-up wall

GUESSING GAME:(From top) Arnold Schwarzenegger, 

Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman and Helena Bonham Carter 

 Now you recognise them? now you don?t. A few frames or the entire length of a film, dramatic changes in star appearances often leave the audience stumped and wondering why the face looks familiar. It?s usually just in the make-up, but a few minutes of shooting can take hours of preparation.

 The success of Ben Kingsley?s enduring portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi was possible not just because he acted well, but also because he looked the part.

 Nicole Kidman?s dyed hair and false nose made her almost unrecognisable as the Australian film star and more like the Virginia Woolf she played on screen.

 Salma Hayek?s eyebrows and a few other alterations did the Frida trick (although a tad more glamourous).

 The right look is harder to create when it is a question of real people, and fictional characters allow for more imagination. Robin Williams was hilarious as the loveable Mrs Doubtfire, but the on-screen antics adjusting to the false breasts, wig, stockings and womanly ways and paraphernalia were a tad easier than the backstage battle of getting it all in place.

 Cate Blanchett was brilliant as the later-years Elizabeth (remember the white, painted face and wardrobe in Elizabeth?) and South African model-turned-actress Charlize Theron was frighteningly believable as serial killer Aileen Wuornos, false teeth, extra weight and all, in her Academy Award-winning performance in Monster.

 Although sometimes playing ordinary individuals is tougher for the beautiful Hollywood people (Halle Berry was almost turned down for her Oscar-winning role in Monster?s Ball because she was too pretty), looking ugly, or even like an alien, is a tougher task.

 Just ask British beauty Helena Bonham Carter, who had to undergo hours of make-up every day for her role in the Planet of the Apes re-make.

 It is the comic book characters ? usually villains ? who are often the most memorable. Jim Carrey wouldn?t have been complete in The Mask, Batman Forever (he played Riddler) and How the Grinch Stole Christmas without the wonderfully over-the-top green look, and very few non-X-men fans know that the blue-bodied, yellow-eyed, shape-changing Mystique is the lovely Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.

 But perhaps the best-known bad guys have come to us via the Batman films. Who can forget Danny DeVito as the oddly-poignant Penguin, Jack Nicholson as the Joker (his trademark laugh gave him away, though) and Arnie as the magnificent Mr Freeze?

 The celebrities might change their own looks and styles as often as their clothes, but playing parts under layers of make-up and false anatomical additions is a pain few others outside the profession can understand.

 Here?s a toast to the trouble they take to make us laugh, cry or just forget the outside world for a short while, enjoy the show and keep us guessing.

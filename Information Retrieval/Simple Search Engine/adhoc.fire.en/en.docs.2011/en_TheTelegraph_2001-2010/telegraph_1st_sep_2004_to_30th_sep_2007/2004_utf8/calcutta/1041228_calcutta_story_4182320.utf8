The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Deported chief back home

 - NGO head says he?s tired, but determined to return to city

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Carlos Duran, founder-director of Sabera Foundation, the Kalitala-based NGO, is back home in Madrid, Spain, after being deported by the Indian government on Saturday. 

 Speaking to Metro over phone, Duran said he had spent the past 24 hours trying to ?rest and recover? with his family and talking to his friends and supporters in Spain and in India about the next course of action. 

 ?From Calcutta, I was taken to Amman, on a Royal Jordanian flight, and then given a ticket to Barcelona. From there, I had to get to Madrid on my own. All I had was the clothes on my back and my wallet. I bought a ticket with my credit card,? he added.

 Still not sure about why it all happened, Duran maintained that despite his Indian visa being cancelled, he was determined to return to Calcutta, ?my home?. 

 However, he was quick to clarify that he didn?t want to ?fight? and just wanted to be allowed to come back ?peacefully?. 

 ?I am shocked, heartbroken and tired about the whole thing. There are allegations against me that are not true. All the money we have raised is in bank accounts here, which are on record and clear for everyone to see,? Duran asserted.

 ?But what happened to the millions of dollars that was raised in Melanie Griffith?s home in LA at the charity dinner two years ago? They wanted to control Sabera India from New York and Spain, which we didn?t allow. So, they cut off ties and the funds have been languishing,? he added.

 A spokesperson for his wife Celestine, who is now managing the NGO?s home in Calcutta, said that they planned to engage lawyers here and in Spain to find out why Duran had been deported and why he wasn?t given any notice by the authorities.

 ?His rights were violated, because he wasn?t told why or when. He wasn?t even given the customary three days? notice that is required before a deportation. Duran just had a day-and-a-half,? the spokesperson said.

 Sabera?s home in Kalitala is being run by a committee and is overlooked by Celestine. ?She can?t leave now, because she has to look after the girls, who are very upset,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sega saga

IPSITA DEB

The 

story of a Mauritian starting the day with a continental breakfast, following 

it up with an Indian lunch and finishing off with a Chinese dinner may be a common 

clich?. But Calcuttans have the next 10 days to check out the variety that is 

the spice of life in Mauritius.

 The Mauritian Food Festival at the Atrium, Park Hotel, was stirred up by Anil Kumarsingh Gayan, minister of tourism and leisure in Mauritius, with Sega dancers and creole cuisine adding to the festive feel.

 Why Calcutta? ?A journey back to my roots, for people who can truly experience life both exotic and close to home,? replied the minister on Thursday.

 A Mauritian adage holds that a good curry must burn twice: the moment you eat it and the day after. So, beware when you dig into the omnipresent Creole Rougaille or Guguy (a meat or vegetarian curry served with rice).

 But to kick things off, exotic fish creole was whipped up by the minister, mixing bell pepper, aubergine, broccoli and fish and cooking them on a low flame with olive oil. Other items on offer included Mutton and Bellpepper in Oyster Sauce, Zucchini a la Creole and Penne and Shrimps in a Light Rougaille.

 There will be a special buffet spread for both lunch and dinner with each day of the festival having a different line-up to highlight a large number of Mauritian dishes.

But the highlight could well be the Sega dancers 

(picture by Rashbehari Das) who belly-danced their way through the hotel, in colourful 

bikini tops with flowing skirts and flowers, on Thursday. They are sure to show 

no signs of slowing down over the next nine days. So, if you can?t make it to 

Mauritius, make it to Atrium.

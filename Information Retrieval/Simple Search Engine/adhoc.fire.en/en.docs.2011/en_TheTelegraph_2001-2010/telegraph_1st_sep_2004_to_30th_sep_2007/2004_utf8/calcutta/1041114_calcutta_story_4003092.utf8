 Along with questions, comments 

 and suggestions, you can now write in with your computer-related 

 problems to TechTalk. Be sure to include the configuration 

 of your PC and be specific about the problem. Write to techtalkabpmail.comThanks 

 for writing in. Here are solutions to some of your computer-related 

 problems.

 Puspen Haldar: I have an assembled PC with Celeron 1.7 

 GHz processor, Gigabyte Technology motherboard, 128 MB DDR 

 RAM, 40 GB HDD, 52X CD ROM and running Windows XP Professional. 

 My PC is nearly 14 months old. For the past two weeks, whenever 

 I start the PC, a message is displayed during POST: ?CMOS 

 checksum error-Defaults loaded Press F1 to continue, DEL 

 to enter setup/Q-Flash?. On pressing F1, the computer starts 

 normally and I don?t encounter any problem. But after restarting, 

 the message is displayed again. This time, instead of pressing 

 F1, when I enter CMOS setup, I find that the boot sequence 

 has changed automatically from ?HDD-0, CD ROM, Floppy? to 

 ?Floppy, HDD-0, CD ROM?. I have to change the sequence and 

 save it. After exiting setup, the computer starts normally 

 and the message is not displayed. The problem recurs. My 

 SMPS was damaged twice recently.

 TechTalk: A checksum is 

 computed as an error-detecting code to protect the BIOS 

 settings stored in the CMOS memory. Each time the system 

 is booted, this number is recomputed and is checked against 

 the stored value. If they do not match, an error message 

 is generated indicating CMOS memory contents may have been 

 corrupted. Your problem may be due to a weak CMOS battery, 

 in which case you need to get it replaced. A virus that?s 

 changing the CMOS settings, may also be the cause. Do a 

 thorough check-up with an antivirus. For the frequent SMPS 

 damage, check the input AC Voltage and the ?earthing? of 

 your electricity distribution.

 Ashis Biswas: I have a PC with PIII, 36 MB RAM, 10.2 

 GB HDD, 15-inch Samsung monitor and Windows XP. Two days 

 ago it was displaying the message ?no sound card installed?. 

 Now it is not booting. What do I do?

 TechTalk: You have not 

 mentioned your problem in detail. The two problems may not 

 be related. Please check a few things before you can come 

 to a conclusion. Is the PC receiving proper AC Voltage? 

 Is the PC doing the Power On Self Test (POST)? Is the memory 

 check being done and the hard disk detected during POST? 

 Are all the CMOS settings correct? Is the boot sequence 

 in CMOS setup correct (hard disk followed by floppy or CD)? 

 If all these are OK, then the problem must be with the operating 

 system.

 Jeet Roy: I own a PC with Intel 1.3 GHz Celeron processor 

 and 128 MB RAM on which Windows 98 is installed. Since purchase, 

 I?m facing several problems. The CDROM drive was not working, 

 and now the PC is not booting. I also discovered that my 

 vendor has actually given me 64 MB RAM. He is now avoiding 

 me whenever I?m trying to contact him. What do I do?

 TechTalk: It seems you 

 have been a victim of a dishonest computer vendor. You can?t 

 approach manufacturing company directly since your PC is 

 assembled. You can get in touch with reputed computer showrooms 

 and ask them for repair options. You may have to get into 

 an annual maintenance scheme, but it will ensure your peace 

 of mind for the future. To avoid such a situation, remember 

 to crosscheck your vendor?s credentials before buying.

 Sumit Paul: I want to know about free downloadable sound 

 sample websites and how I can download them. Also, what 

 is the function of karaoke software ? is it a free download?

 TechTalk: There are many 

 websites from which you can download free sound samples. 

 Some, like www.soundcentral.com, allow you to download free 

 samples of different instruments. You can find out about 

 other websites through search engines like Google and Altavista. 

 Many of the websites will ask you to register first and 

 then allow download. 

 Karaoke software helps you to 

 sing along with Karaoke files. Like your MP3 players, you 

 can set up playlist, edit karaoke files or customise a karaoke 

 session. There are different Karaoke software available 

 on the Internet. Some of them are free.

 Suman Rana: My configuration is: Mercury motherboard, 

 PIII 1.13 GHz processor, 192 MB RAM, 40 GB HDD. For the 

 past one month, while booting, I get the following massage: 

 ?Pri master: qp100-12 Samsung sv4002h ultra DMA mode-5, 

 S.M.A.R.T. capable but disabled, CMOS setting wrong CMOS/GPNV 

 checksum bad, press F1 to run setup press F2 to load default 

 values and continue. After changing S.M.A.R.T. enable, I 

 get the message ?CPU has changed, press any key to enter 

 setup. 

 TechTalk: It may be just 

 a coincidence that you encountered the error after you enabled 

 S.M.A.R.T. for your hard disk. There is no relation between 

 the two. Try to load the default CMOS settings first. If 

 it doesnt work then you may have to change your CMOS 

 battery.

 Trigem's new personal computer TG/PD, 

 launched in Seoul recently, promises to change the name 

 of the game. The new multimedia personal computer has 

 strengthened audio entertainment functions with its 

 front cover resembling a music player

 Tuhin Mitra: My two-year old PC has the following configuration: 

 Intel Celeron 1.10A GHz processor, 128 MB SD RAM, 40 GB 

 HDD, Mercury 810e2 TFST motherboard, 52X CDROM, 600VA Microtek 

 UPS. When I bought it; there were two types of Celeron processors 

 available. One, the Celeron 1.1 Ghz and the other Celeron 

 1.10A GHz. I chose the latter. I want to know the difference 

 between the two. Also, I want to upgrade to 256 MB DDR RAM, 

 but my motherboard doesn?t support DDR RAM. I was also told 

 that changing the motherboard wouldn?t help because my processor 

 wouldn?t fit in current motherboards. Please suggest a way 

 out.

 TechTalk: There are architectural 

 differences between Celeron 1.1 and 1.1 A. Celeron 1.1 has 

 the Coppermine based 0.18 micron core whereas Celeron 1.1A 

 has Tualatin based 0.13 micron core. ?A? denotes Tualatin. 

 The maximum temperature of Celeron 1.1 is 77 degree Celsius 

 and the power is 33.0 Watts. For Celeron 1.1A the maximum 

 temperature is 69 degree Celsius and the power is 28.9 Watts. 

 The core voltage of Celeron 1.1 is 1.75 Volt and Celeron 

 1.1A is 1.48 Volt. For the second problem, there seems no 

 way out. You might have to change the whole setup, but if 

 you only want to a memory increase, look for SD RAM.

 P.K. Basu: I have an assembled PC with Celeron 1 GHz 

 Intel processor, 128 MB RAM and 40 GB HDD. Windows 98 and 

 Windows 2000 Server are loaded. While Defragmenting drive 

 C, after completing 10% it repeatedly shows ?Drives contents 

 changed...Restarting?. I also have huge number of files 

 in the Temporary Internet Files folder. Can these be deleted? 

 Further, by removing a particular program using Add/Remove 

 programs, do all the files actually get deleted? If not, 

 how do I remove unnecessary files? 

 TechTalk: Usually, the 

 error message ?Drives contents changed? is shown when you 

 try to run Defrag while the anti-virus or screen saver is 

 running. Select ?None? for your screensaver menu, disable 

 the antivirus program and then try Defrag. If it still doesn?t 

 work, boot your system in Safe mode and run Defrag. The 

 Temporary Internet files can be deleted safely.

 The answer to the last question 

 depends on the program you want to uninstal. A good uninstaller 

 program should remove all the components, including the 

 registry entry. But some uninstallers don?t clear all files. 

 If you know the location of these files or registry entries, 

 you may try to delete them manually.

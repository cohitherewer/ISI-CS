 Dry run in dairies? milky way

 - Sweet shops accused of stocking up for pujas

 SWATI SENGUPTA 

 It?s not hurting yet, but chances are it will, in the coming festive season. 

 City connoisseurs of food, with their yen for butter and ghee-dipped delicacies or paneer pakoras, are likely to be left dispirited. After all, what can be more agonising than not getting ghee, butter and paneer to one?s heart?s content?

 And what can be more disturbing than not having enough of flavoured milk, mishti doi or yoghurt from state-run outlets while on a shopping or pandal-hopping spree?

 The market of milk products in the city and surrounding areas seems to be heading for uncertainty during the Pujas, as the daily supply of milk to the dairies has declined abruptly. 

 And the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is worried that there may not be enough milk products available to meet the increased demand during the festive months. 

 ?In a bid to stock up huge quantities of kheer and ghee for the festivities, sweet shops all over town are procuring excess milk, and this has resulted in the sudden slide in the supply of milk,? a senior state official said on Friday.

 ?Better storage facilities make it possible for the confectioners to stock up the stuff that can be used during the festive season when the demand surges,? he added. 

 The official hastened to add that the supply of processed milk would not be affected ? ?there?s no need to worry on that score?.

 But the supply of raw milk has, indeed, become erratic, with the daily shortfall now ranging between 10 and 15 per cent. ?The state-owned Belgachhia dairy, for instance, requires 50,000 litres of raw milk every day. But the supply now is between 37,000 and 40,000 litres,? the official added. 

 Dairies in and around the city purchase altogether 450,000 litres of raw milk daily, and produce 900,000 litres of processed milk. Apart from the processed milk, products such as paneer, ghee, butter, mishti doi and flavoured milk are also produced from this supply of raw milk. 

 ?Low supply of raw milk means most of it is being used up to produce processed milk, and not much is left for the by-products,? the official explained. 

 Confectionery owners, however, are not ready to be held responsible. R.K. Paul, general secretary of the Paschim Banga Mishtanna Byaboshayee Samity, said: ?It is not true that sweet shops across the city and in the suburbs are buying extra milk for the entire festive season from now. They may be procuring in excess of their normal demand for Viswakarma Puja, which is a week away.? 

 The government official, on the other hand, asserted: ?We have information that the sweet shops have started stocking up. They are buying milk directly from the producers by paying more than the Milk Federation, which procures 90 per cent of the total supply to the city.?

 The government is repeatedly ?urging milk cooperatives to increase the supply, so we can cope with the increased demand during the Pujas?, he added.

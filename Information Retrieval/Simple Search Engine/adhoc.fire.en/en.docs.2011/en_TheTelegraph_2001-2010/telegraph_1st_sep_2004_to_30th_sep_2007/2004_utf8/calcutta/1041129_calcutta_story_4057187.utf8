 Feel-good to boost milk

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government is exploring new avenues and strategies to market its milk.

 After deciding to sell milk under the brand name Webmilk from December 11, the government is now working on a proposal to increase the commission of its agents, as also to reimburse an increased transportation cost.

 The government procures raw milk from cooperatives and processes it at the Belgachhia dairy. Altogether, 80,000 litres of milk are processed at the dairy every day for the Calcutta market. 

 The city?s total intake of milk, from government as well as private dairies, is pegged at nine lakh litres a day. 

 Presently, there are 200 registered agents, who collect milk from the Belgachhia dairy and supply it across the city. The government intends to double the number of agents. 

 According to the present commission structure, an agent gets 25 paise per litre of milk. The sum will be hiked to 35 paise. The transportation cost, too, will be increased from 15 paise per litre to 50 paise per litre, according to the distance covered.

 ?The hike in the commission has become an absolute necessity to sell more milk. We cannot but keep all our agents happy. After all, up early in the morning, the customer is more interested in getting a packet of fresh milk than quibbling over the brand name,? a senior official of the animal resources development department asserted on Sunday.

 ?Our success will depend on our ability to reach customers, and this will be made possible by our army of agents. Hence, our concern to make them feel good,? the official explained.

 The department wants to pay the agents what could turn out to be the highest commission in the market, so that they prefer the government brand to others. 

 ?We have to make our package attractive. And, with an expected 400 agents happy with their commission, we are hoping to make things work out better in the future,? the official added.

 ?The new rates will come into effect around the same time as Webmilk pouches enter the market,? he said. 

 The state is already suffering huge losses in the sector ? to the tune of Rs 50 crore to Rs 60 crore annually. 

 ?The hike in commission will not aggravate the losses. Especially because we are going to increase the production manifold,? another official of the department pointed out.

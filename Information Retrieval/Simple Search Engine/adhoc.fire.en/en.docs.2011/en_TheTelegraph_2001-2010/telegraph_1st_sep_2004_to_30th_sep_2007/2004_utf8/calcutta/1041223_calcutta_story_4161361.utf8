The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wielding the willow, building bridges

 NISHA LAHIRI

 A mission for peace and friendship has taken on a life of its own.

 That?s because the people involved have made it their mission to build bridges and fill the gaping hole between two neighbours. And once again, children are the driving force behind the initiative.

 Beyond Boundaries was started earlier this year by Delhi-based NGO Leapfrog, an initiative by Soumya Sen, to bring together the children of Pakistan and India, from varied backgrounds through cricket.

 Sen?s wife, actress Nandita Das, who has been involved with the programme, will also be in town.

 While a team of 32 youngsters from this side of the border toured Pakistan in April, this month, a reciprocal trip is in progress.

 Twenty-one children crossed the Wagah border on December 13, and will be coming to Calcutta on December 24, for a three-day sojourn. Joining them on their journey around the country is a group of 25 Indian children, mainly from deprived areas, including two boys and two girls from Calcutta.

 Cricket is the means to spread the message of harmony and unity during the 10-city tour, says Sen. ?The children have met the Prime Minister and in Mumbai at a special screening of Munnabhai MBBS, the cast was there, including Sanjay Dutt. I was a little apprehensive about what it would be like here after the overwhelming response in Pakistan but it?s been wonderful so far.?

 Cricket excites a lot of interest and makes people notice, but it?s the interaction that?s important, says Charulatha Banerjee, senior programme officer, CINI Asha, the partner NGO in Calcutta hosting the group.

 The Pakistani youngsters ? some from public schools, others child labourers ? will play five-over matches with three teams ? Don Bosco Park Circus, a CINI Asha project team from the streets and railway platforms and the third with the Indian group travelling with them. 

 The group of 21 will also meet the Governor, interact with schoolchildren and, in a unique move, some will spend a night with the families of the staff members of CINI Asha.

 The children, who will be staying at St Thomas School, Kidderpore, will have time for the little things, like watching the light-and-sound show at Victoria Memorial.

 But when they will really bond with the place and the people is during the interactions, at a bonfire night in Kidderpore and a programme in Diamond Harbour.

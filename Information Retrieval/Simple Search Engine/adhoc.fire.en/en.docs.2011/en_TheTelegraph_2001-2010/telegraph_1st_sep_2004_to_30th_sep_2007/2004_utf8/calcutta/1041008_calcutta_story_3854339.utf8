 Deluge prelude to boat advent 

Upbeat amid washout

 - Furrows line faces of artisans, decorators and organisers

 The astrologers, for once, are spot on. Goddess Durga, this autumn, is destined to arrive by boat. The effect of a journey in the watery vehicle is noukayang shashyabriddhi jalabriddhischa. In other words, a good harvest, but a rise in water levels. With less than two weeks to go for the Pujas, the city is swimming, thanks to the deluge from the heavens, as if paving a watery path for the Devi?s voyage.

 Creased brows to looks of resignation mark the faces of all those associated with Pujas ? organiser to decorator to artisan. ?We are unlikely to meet the deadlines. We appeal to all the puja committees to cooperate with us,? says Babu Pal, secretary, Kumortuli Mritsilpo Sanskrity Samity.

 Entering the artisan?s hub, off Banamali Sarkar Street, the first sight that arrests the eye is the arms, fists clenched to get a grip on the weapon or fingers in benison mode, jutting out of cubby-hole studios. On Thursday afternoon, the hands were there but the fingers had melted away.

 Entrances to many studios were barred by plastic sheets, tied to Ganesh?s trunk or the lion?s jaw. The idols left out on the streets due to space constraint were in a muddy mess. 

 ?The string tying the idols to the framework rotted in the rain and wore off,? says a worker at K.C. Pal?s about the idols that have collapsed, headfirst.

 Word has reached Gorachand Pal that his gigantic Janbazar Baroari idol being built on site has melted. But he has his hands full. Seven studios in the lane are in the same boat. Lower than street level, they have been inundated. 

 ?We have drained some 40 buckets since the morning. When will we work?? cries Pal, continuing with the cup-and-bucket operation.

 Kumartuli, now in colouring mode, has been forced back to patchwork repair.

 If the artisans are worried about failing clients, Puja organisers have other worries. At Purba Putiary, Kudghat, the water is still standing in the park where the puja is to be held. ?We will try to pump out the water on Friday,? says secretary Prosenjit Saha.

 At Bosepukur Talbagan, vice-president Subhendu Ghosh is ruing the loss of three days: ?The alpona designs are not registering on the rain-soaked plaster of Paris walls. We will have to throw it all away.?

 But no one is giving up, yet. The hands are moving faster and the hours of sleep are being slashed. As Kali Saha, of 25 Pally, Kidderpore, puts it: ?Pandal-hoppers need not lose heart. We will present the Pujas the way we have planned, come what may.?

 Buck passes, blaze rages

 - Firemen blame Port Trust for safety norm flout in godown

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Forty hours after it was detected, the blaze at Shed No. 4 of Netaji Subhas Dock flared on. Fire-fighters said on Thursday that the flames had been contained but not doused.

 ?The biggest problem we are facing here is the large quantity of combustible material that was stocked in the shed,? said a senior fire department official. Among the goods charred in the shed since Wednesday were bulk quantities of garments, bales of raw silk and electronic items.

 Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee and senior fire brigade officials on Wednesday held the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) authorities responsible for the fire that gutted the three-storeyed storehouse, causing an estimated loss of Rs 10 crore.

 After a half-an-hour visit to the godown, the minister criticised the CPT for not adopting basic fire-safety measures. ?The basic gadgets that should have been installed were not there,? he said.

 Fire services director-general Baren Sen echoed Chatterjee, saying: ?The CPT authorities could have easily set up a well-equipped fire-fighting system, as they have the advantage of an adequate supply of water. But they didn?t.?

 Sen also listed the other lapses on the part of the CPT authorities. ?There was no concealed waterline in the godown. Also, no fire alarm had been installed,? he said. ?The fire might have broken out long before the CPT men noticed the smoke.?

 Minister Chatterjee accused the CPT authorities of informing the fire brigade late. ?I don?t know why they took so long to call us in. Firemen reached the spot around 2 pm and by then, the situation was beyond control. Had they called us immediately after the smoke was noticed, the godown could have been saved.?

 CPT chairman Anup Chandra declined comment on Chatterjee?s observation. ?The priority now is to put out the fire and I think we should concentrate on that task. If the minister has made any remarks, they must be based on some information provided to him,? he said. ?We are awaiting a report from the police.?

 Asked about possible insider involvement in the blaze, minister Chatterjee said: ?That can only be confirmed once the flames have died down. Forensic experts will visit the spot and collect samples. We will decide on a course of action after the report is received.?

 Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), was of the same view. ?A case has been registered with West Port police station. But our report will be based on the forensic findings. If they suggest any foul play, we will probe the blaze.?

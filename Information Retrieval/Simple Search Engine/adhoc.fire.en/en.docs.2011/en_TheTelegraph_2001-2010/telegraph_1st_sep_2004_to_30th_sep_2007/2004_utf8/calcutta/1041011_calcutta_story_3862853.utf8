The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bengal focus for US trade top brass

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Left may have its reservations on the policies of the US, but the big daddy is showing interest in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s ?resurgent? Bengal. 

 Come October 13 and 14, Kenneth Juster, US under-secretary for industry and security, will touch base with the Writers? Buildings top brass and who?s who of corporate Calcutta during his visit to the city, on the invitation of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). 

 According to the apex chamber, the visit can be seen as the Bush administration?s renewed focus on India and especially this part of the country, which got a boost after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s September meeting with the US President. 

 ?No one of Juster?s stature from the US administration has ever visited Calcutta. Being the under-secretary in the bureau of industry, his role is very important in bilateral economic and business issues. We tried through our Washington office and the visiting delegations to convince him to include Calcutta in his itinerary,? said Ravi Poddar, deputy chairman, CII eastern region. 

 During his stay here, Juster will meet the chief minister and a couple of his senior Cabinet colleagues in Writers?. Besides, on October 13 night, he will have a session with senior government officials and a select group of city industrialists over dinner, to be hosted by Sanjeev Goenka. On the next day, the under-secretary ? the architect of the Indo-US Next Steps in Strategic Partnership and High Technology Cooperation Group (HTCG) ? will interact with the city?s business community. 

 ?We have decided to keep a Bengal focus at the interaction and we expect the under-secretary will lay down the US government?s agenda with regard to doing business with this part of the country,? said Amitabh Khosla, regional director, CII eastern region. 

 Along with the US consulate, CII is drawing up Juster?s other programmes in the city, ranging from a trip to the state?s IT hub in the Salt Lake Electronics Complex and site-seeing. 

 ?Given the importance of IT in Indo-US bilateral business relations and the under-secretary?s role reducing barriers in high technology trade between the two countries, we will also take him to the Saltlec to show him the growth of the knowledge industry in the state,? summed up Khosla.

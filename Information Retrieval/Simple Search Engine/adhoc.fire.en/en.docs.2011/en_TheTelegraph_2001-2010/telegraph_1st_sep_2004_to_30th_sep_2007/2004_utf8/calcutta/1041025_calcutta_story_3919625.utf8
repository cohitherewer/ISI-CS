The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without...

taking Bijoya greetings to heart

A jolly good time to remember long lost friends and family. Whichever side of 

the kola-kuli fence you are on (waiting for the warm embrace, or staying 

an arm?s length away), do it in style with sugar-free sweets and chocolates after 

the traditional overdose of caring and sharing. Text and picture messages are 

as good a bet for lazy louts and busy bees to keep the community feeling at your 

fingertips.

carrying on from the festive flirt

Follow up on the ?friendship? you struck with that cute guy/gal while doing some 

disco dandiya at the Salt Lake stadium or maroing adda at Maddox 

Square last week. You did put your best foot forward (Woodlands or Bata?) to catch 

that roving eye, didn?t you! So, kadam kadam badhaye ja...

 leftover dressing on Lakshmi puja

If the four fervent days didn?t do enough justice to your endless shopping sprees 

in the months preceding the Pujas, Wednesday is a good day to show off at least 

one of the designer tags. Richness is the rage, which the goddess of wealth is 

bound to approve of!

turning Monday blues on its head

Take the liberty to prolong the festive spirit by carrying the holiday mood to 

work. Regale ?em with pandal titbits from your para or exchange notes on 

other destinations you are just back from. Bribe the boss with some Bijoya mishti 

and the mid-day adda will be eminently excusable.

counting the calories all over again

If indulgence ruled your celebrations, jump on the treadmill to work off those 

calories. Add two more days to your three-day-a-week exercise routine if you hope 

to be able to squeeze into that itsy-bitsy choli you got for Diwali. While 

you are at it, try to shed a few extra kilos than necessary to be able to binge 

on the forthcoming festive platter sans guilt pangs.

coming the nip in the air

Take stock of your winter moisturisers and glycerine soaps before flaky lips and 

cracked heels catch you unawares. In case you haven?t noticed, you are sweating 

like a pig no more despite the sun shining in all its fiery glory and have been 

getting up groggy to turn down the morning fan. Would also be prudent to strike 

some early winter bargains before the Christmas rush starts.

catching the screen scare or dare

One is scared and the other scurried. Sushmita Sen and Mallika Sherawat are fighting 

it out at the tinsel turnstiles this week for the only two new Bollywood releases, 

Sourabh Usha Narang?s Vaastu Shastra and Govind Menon?s Kis Kiski Kismat. 

Sush and Sherawat display everything from emotions to essentials. Last heard, 

scare was scoring over sex. If you want to figure out why, learn about vaastu 

by day and destiny by night.

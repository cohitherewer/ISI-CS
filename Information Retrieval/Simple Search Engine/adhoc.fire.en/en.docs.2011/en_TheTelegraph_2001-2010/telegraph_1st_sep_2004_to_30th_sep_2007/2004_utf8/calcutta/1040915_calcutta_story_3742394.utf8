The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Safety last to school, back

 - Busmen throw up hands hours before apex court deadline

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A string of directives, a flurry of training sessions and a hue and cry over enforcing a Supreme Court deadline lapsing on Wednesday. Yet, safe journey to and from school remains a distant dream for hundreds of children. 

 Reason: owners and operators of contract carriages, who ferry the maximum number of schoolchildren in the city, claim they will run up huge losses if they are forced to meet the guidelines within the stipulated time.

Keen to rein in schoolbus operators, the apex court 

had issued a 10-point guideline for all metros. For Calcutta, September 15 is 

the deadline. Hours before it expires, the owners and operators have thrown up 

their hands. 

 ?It?s a tall order to meet the guidelines. Our members, for instance, have complained that it?s difficult to keep an attendant along with a help for each bus. That will not be economically viable,? said Himadri Ganguly, secretary of the West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners? and Operators? Association.

 One guideline states that a driver should have at least five years of experience. This has left the operators in a fix, as most drivers don?t have that experience. And the handful available charge exorbitant rates, complained an operator.

 ?The court orders says a schoolbus has to be painted yellow with a six-inch blue border. Most operators have not been able to abide by this directive,? said Ganguly, whose association accounts for more than 2,000 schoolbuses in the city and adjoining areas.

 It has even appealed to the public vehicles department (PVD) to take into consideration these factors while deciding on a schoolbus operator?s plea for a ?fitness certificate?.

 A PVD official said: ?If we decide to be lenient, we may face the wrath of the court.? 

 The traffic police, however, are not willing to budge. 

 ?The Supreme Court order has come into force in all other metros. We have made it clear to the operators that if they miss the deadline, we will start slapping fines,? asserted Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic). 

 ?If the transport department agrees to extend the deadline, we?ve no problem. Otherwise, we?ll go ahead with our plans,? he added.

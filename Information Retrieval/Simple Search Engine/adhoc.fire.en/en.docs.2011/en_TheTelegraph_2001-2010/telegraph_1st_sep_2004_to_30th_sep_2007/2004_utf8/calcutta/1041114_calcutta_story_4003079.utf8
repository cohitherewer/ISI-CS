The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Look who?s talking

 Mohona Paul, Class XII student of MB Girls? School, loves listening to the radio. Less for the music of her choice and more for the anchor?s voice she would love to emulate.

 Sikandar Sultan is a 44-year-old businessman who makes pouches for a living. But with his good people-skills, the ex-Don Bosco Park Circus student wouldn?t mind taking up MC-ing, full-time.

 Pranaadhika Sinha, on a sabbatical from academics after finishing school, has just founded an NGO. She knows she needs to deliver her lines well in order to get her message across to diverse groups of people.

 Last week saw Aditi, Sikandar and Pranaadhika, and many others like them, hitting a Townsend Road address with much apprehension and hope to attend a workshop on the art of anchoring.

 ?With events, shows and just about 

 any launch becoming an anchor or MC-driven affair, there 

 is a dire need for good anchors in the city who would be 

 able to hold their ground and keep the audience focussed,? 

 explains Rehan Waris, event manager, who organised the workshop 

 (picture above by Pradip Sanyal).

 The four-day affair was aimed at training and motivating people interested in pursuing a career in anchoring and jockeying.

 Day One began with the students interviewing each other. Next up were Just-a-Minute (JAM) sessions on topics ranging from literature and art to child sexual abuse, Fahrenheit 9/11 to teenage love affairs, fashion to journalism.

 Also on the agenda was a session on voiceover, TV anchoring and microphone mechanics by Sutapa Biswas, guest faculty at Loreto College. In another session, a Half-a Minute (HAM) competition tuned into participants talking each other out on fun topics like ?I woke up in the morning to find myself with a bottle of beer??.

 Propped up by the success of his maiden effort along the same lines earlier this year, Waris was confident his workshop would click this time, too.

 ?Most people thought this course might help them improve their communication skills while giving presentations as well,? he says. If the excitement among the participants was anything to go by, the workshop had definitely broken their shells of shyness and stage fright.

 ?The mere thought of walking up and talking to a crowd would give me the creeps. Rehan?s sessions have changed all that,? beams 27-year-old Mohana Kanjilal, who has taken up ?writing for a living?.

 For Zameer Vaswani, a La Martiniere for Boys student who just wants to speak well, the workshop took him a step forward in sharpening his oratory skills. ?Though I want to take up science in college, public speaking is a sphere I think can help me all the time,? he says, oozing confidence.

 Soumya Srivastava, a singer who performs on TV, gave the workshop a try to boost her stage skills. ?At the ice-breaking session, I had thrown up my hands in despair when my turn came to speak at the microphone?But I am sure I have improved over three days,? she smiles.

 Local notes, global rhythm

 The beat of one Calcutta-based percussionist is being heard in some unexpected places. Tabla player and world music composer Abhijit Banerjee is working on a number of global projects, among them a University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)-supported programme in Indonesia with traditional gamelan musicians.

 Having played with big classical names in India ? Pandit Ravi Shankar to Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, and big contemporary names abroad including Herbie Hancock ? he is keen now to experiment with his own sound. The gamelan team ? Indonesian orchestra comprising percussion instruments ? hopes to perform at the Sacred Music Festival next year in Los Angeles.

 Banerjee sticks to traditional instruments and prefers to describe his brand of rhythm as world music rather than fusion. ?Most fusion-style musicians play instruments like the octopad, but I try to revive the old instruments,? he said, a day before leaving Calcutta for LA, where he spends four months of the year teaching.

 A regular in the classical music circuit, Banerjee started his own centre called the Dhwani Academy of Professional Music. It started in Calcutta, at Rashbehari, and has now branched to LA. ?We teach tabla, south Indian percussion, drums and music appreciation,? explains the 38-year-old who also teaches two blind students a year.

 The enthusiasm of young students about classical music is very encouraging, feels Banerjee. ?I take part in a number of Spicmacay events and there clearly is still a passion for the classical forms.? 

 Banerjee is also doing his bit to spread the knowledge about Indian percussion. The World Beat Centre in San Diego had no Indian instruments on its curriculum till Banerjee fought his way through. A course in Indian music was introduced this year which Banerjee is overseeing.

 Future plans for the experimental 

 musician include a long-awaited trip to Latin America. And 

 there could be good news for Calcuttans, too. ?I am planning 

 to do three shows in January with an American group called 

 Arohi,? he reveals. Also on the anvil is a gig with Louiz 

 Banks. ?It is not yet finalised. We are looking for a vocalist 

 to make it a more complete show,? says Banerjee.

 Crossover cricket: Perizaad 

 hits purple patch

 Jogger?s Park, Bollywood 

 Calling, Mumbai Matinee and now Morning Raga. 

 Crossover films may sure be her cup of tea, but the tag 

 doesn?t hang heavy on the slim frame of Perizaad Zorabian. 

 She is now padding up to lend verve and voice to Harsha 

 ki Khonj, the ESPN-STAR Sports hunt for a sports presenter. 

 The bubbly beauty breezes through town on Tuesday for the 

 Calcutta chapter of the hunt along with Wasim Akram. Reverse 

 swing, anyone?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flight of fantasy, reality bites

A still from Aabar Ashbo Phire and

 Come September 24 and Tollywood will dish out two films by two first-time directors of opposite inspirations and aspirations. Pitted against Ravi Ojha?s Aabar Ashbo Phire, etched on a larger-than-life canvas, is Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti?s hard-hitting reality drama, Dwitiya Paksha.

 If one is the most expensive film ever to have rolled out of Tollywood with lots of gloss and glamour, the other is a low-cost, high-brow venture with a strong social message. From love and rebirth to women?s reservation and power politics, this Friday is clearly a choice between popcorn pleasures and serious soul-searching.

Aabar Ashbo Phire

 Cast: Saswata Chatterjee, Koneenica Banerjee, Victor Banerjee, Sabitri Chatterjee, Tapas Pal, Barun Chanda

 Director: Ravi Ojha

 Release at: Priya, Mitra, Globe, INOX (City Centre), 89 Cinemas

 Storyline: He?s a smart and suave UK-returned doctor, she a nurse raised in a church. They meet in the operating theatre, where she tries to kill him and then lapses into a fit! Intrigued, the hero tries to help the lady cope with her trauma and digs up the past in the process ? the tale of their undying love and rebirth.

 Cushioned in a Rs-3.5 crore budget, the unrequited-love-and-reincarnation theory makes a thumping comeback on the Bengali big screen in a glossy pack. Slick editing, taut script and commendable performances are likely to stand it in good stead.

 Director Ojha, who canned the film over a period of around 120 days, has spared no effort to mount it on a lavish scale. ?I have tried to make Aabar Ashbo Phire on the magnitude of a Viraasat or a Roja. It?s a complete film with a good storyline that people across Bengal can watch and enjoy,? he claims.

 Watch out for the seven songs picturised at a cool cost of Rs 1.5 crore, and the 10-minute jungle scene that traverses Mumbai, the forests of north Bengal and Saranda.

Dwitiya Paksha (The Second Innings)

 Cast: Santu Mukherjee, Arindam Sil, Meghna Haldar, Srilekha Mukherjee

 Director: Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti 

 Release at: Nandan II

Storyline: Shyama, the dark and docile daughter of a poor peasant wedded to a widower, is asked to contest the panchayat polls from a seat reserved for women as per the 73rd Amendment Bill. Stepping into the shoes of her politician father-in-law, the village girl succeeds in toppling the hierarchy and frustrating the power structure.

 The film focusing on the silent impact of women?s reservation in a rural household has been created with an all-woman crew (camera by Ranu Ghosh, editing by Sharmishtha Jha and costumes by Bibi Russel). Launching newcomer Meghna as Shyama, Dwitiya Paksha was shot in Baruipur Rajbari and Bawali village of South 24-Parganas.

 ?The 73rd Amendment paved the way for one million women to come to power in rural India. Most of these women were allowed to contest the polls by their male relatives who thought they would be able to pull the strings from behind. This assumption, however, turned out to be wrong in many cases. And we underestimate viewers when we say they don?t like to watch intelligent films,? says Ananya, a journalist and documentary film-maker.

 Dwitiya Paksha is for all those wishing to watch a politically-relevant family drama with a point to ponder.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bon Appetease

Victor Banerjee

Therefore, Sourav?s skipp(er)ing the mandatory press 

meeting is perfectly excusable for all members of the exclusive club of celebrities 

I mentioned above. Indiscipline and a stylish arrogance is one of the perks that 

comes with having worked hard and overtime on a gaddi, under the sun or 

arc lights, to become a celebrity in a country of a billion lacklustre tillers 

and petty merchants and let no power try and snatch that privilege away from us. 

You might well ask what this prologue has to do with 

food. I am coming to that. When I read the Shankaracharya cooked his own food, 

I realised how subjective priorities might have deluded objectivity and transformed 

spirituality into violent tendencies amounting to murder. 

And Sourav?s nagging back problem? Well, some orthopaedics 

and physiotherapists feel it has been brought on by flopping around on giant settees 

in the lounge bar of the Pavilion, staring at the chiaroscuro of his own portraits. 

Few know that it was on the expert advice from his chiropractor that Sourav painstakingly 

extended his working hours on the field: it was only in order to delay getting 

back to and being forced by promoters to lounge around in his lounge at the Pavilion. 

Sir Clive Lloyd, in his captaining days, as many young admirers of his will vouch, 

had no such lower back problems, and, therefore, failed to understand why the 

Indian captain should be rewarded instead of suspended.

It hurts the cricket-loving millions of West Bengal, 

and India, just as much as it does bank managers, to see their Prince, their hero, 

forced to return to a Pavilion that in a month earns him less than he makes in 

a single match. What?s worse, once back at the Pavilion, Sourav has to contend 

with sofas and menus and meals that can only turn his strut into sloth and render 

him useless for the nation.

So, with the Shankaracharya in trouble cooking his 

own meals and Sourav in trouble for having to eat his own endorsements, where 

does that leave the ordinary consumer of dal roti and jhol bhat? 

In the royal soup. Now that the elections in America are over, conclusively supporting 

the Southern Baptists? vision of tomorrow?s world, and over a thousand lie dead 

on the streets of Falluja (where once four US businessmen were butchered and 600 

Iraqis killed in retaliation within 72 hours), the world-in-a-soup dinner diet 

shall become commonplace for us all.

If, as in the words of Chaucer, ?In his own grease 

I made him frie/ for anger and for jealousie? then the wife of Bath?s tale should 

honestly apply to those who deserve to stew in their own juices. But, rather than 

starch the topic with an abundance of potatoes I shall depart from the ?Irish? 

and give you a recipe for a ?Hearty Moton Stoo?: one of the most popular diets 

of the young and ailing, sick and dying, withering and ageing, flatulent and moaning 

sufferers from overindulgence in this our fair land of Bangla, is stoo (sic[k]).

Ingredients: 1 kg boneless mutton; 1/3 cup 

all-purpose flour; 1/3 cup refined oil; 1 large onion, chopped; 6 to 10 cloves 

garlic, minced; 3 cups water, 4 chicken cubes or 4 cups stock, 1 tsp salt; ? tsp 

pepper; 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce; 5 medium potatoes cut into chunks; ? kg carrots 

cut into chunks; 150 grams fresh or frozen peas.

Method: Cut meat into one-and-a-half-inch chunks. 

On waxed paper, coat the meat with flour and reserve leftover flour. Heat oil 

in a large container sufficient to hold the stew. Brown meat all over in oil a 

few pieces at a time, remove pieces as they brown. Reduce heat to medium. To drippings 

in pan, add onion and garlic, cook for three minutes, stirring until onion is 

slightly brown. Stir in reserved flour. Gradually add water, stock, salt, pepper, 

and Worcestershire sauce, stirring until mixture is slightly thickened. 

Add meat, heat to boiling, then reduce heat, cover 

and cook till almost tender, stirring occasionally. (If pressure cooking, to the 

meat you must add the roux for thickening after the meat has cooked). Add potato 

and carrot chunks over medium heat, heat to boiling. Reduce and simmer for 20 

minutes. Stir in frozen peas, cover and simmer five to 10 minutes or until all 

the vegetables are tender and the gravy has thickened to the required consistency. 

Serve immediately with hot bread!

This fabulous stew recipe is my gift to the eternally 

recuperating (from something or the other) public I encounter everyday in West 

Bengal. Suddenly, the sick and dying shall rise and shine so long as you pretend 

that this delicious stew was exactly what the doctor had recommended. Meanwhile, 

the whole family can gorge on this meal and celebrate the sick. Bon appetease!

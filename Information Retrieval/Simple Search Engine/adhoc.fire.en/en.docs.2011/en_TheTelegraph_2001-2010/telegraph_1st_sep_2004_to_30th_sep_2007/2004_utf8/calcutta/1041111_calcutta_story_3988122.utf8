 Picture stories

 Performance photography, though a relatively uncharted artistic territory, offers immense opportunities for creativity and expression. The ongoing exhibition of photo performance work, Native Women of South India ? Manners and Customs, explores the history of photography as a tool of ethnographic documentation. Consciously invoking the traditional studio environment with its artificial, elaborate sets, artist Pushpamala N., in the role of various female persona, and photographer Clare Arni, who invades her own photographic frame, play out an eccentric array of ?native types?, recreating figures ranging from the religious and mythological to the fictional and real. The series of photographs on show ironically comments on our post-colonial obsessions and our nationalist ideal proclaiming ourselves as a diverse people. Turning on its head the conventional notions related to subject and object, photographer and photographed, real and fake, the vividly compelling images provide an interesting interpretation of the life of our times, using the devices of performance and masquerade.

 Event: An exhibition of photo performance work

 When: Till November 21; 2 pm - 7 pm

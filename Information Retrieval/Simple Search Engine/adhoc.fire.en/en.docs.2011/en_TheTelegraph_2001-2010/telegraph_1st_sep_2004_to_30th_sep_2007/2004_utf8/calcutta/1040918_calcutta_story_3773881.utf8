The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Just wanna have fun

She was one Girlfriend many people had problems 

with. But Ishaa Koppikar still stands by the film that helped her hit the headlines 

(and how!) with complete conviction. Now, as her new film Kundan Shah?s Ek 

Se Badhkar Ek hits the halls, she looks back at the Karan Razdan venture as 

?a great career move?.

 ?Yes, the film received a lot of flak and was driven into a huge controversy but you have to look at a movie as a movie. It was not a documentary on lesbians, it was meant to just entertain. But I?m sorry about all those people who felt offended by the film. It was just that we took a few cinematic liberties.?

 Ishaa still remembers the kind of ?special preparations? she went through for Girlfriend. ?I worked a lot on my body language and my body, too. I had to be more of a man. The main homework I did was to get into the psyche of the character. I learnt the knack of switching on and off at will. I even shot for the music video Bhor within a day and a half of the Girlfriend shoot.?

 For Ishaa, however, it?s now time to just have some fun with Ek Se Badhkar Ek releasing after being in the making for almost two years. ?Although I did some comedy in Aamdani Atthani Kharcha Rupaiyya, you can say that this is my first comedy. I play a detective in the film. It?s more of a subject comedy and I do not really go out of my way to make people laugh.?

 It is the man himself, Kundan Shah, that Ishaa found most funny. ?He looks very serious but he can crack jokes with a straight face. I am really lucky to have been able to work with a great director like him.?

 For the girl who had men going berserk with her Khallas moves, nothing?s planned. ?That I have been branded with this glam image was never a conscious move. It happened; what?s fated will happen. I have tried and done different roles and now you will get to see me in different looks.?

 First up will be Pankaj Parashar?s Inteqaam opposite Manoj Bajpai. ?Then there are two more comedies ? David Dhawan?s next film with Salman, Katrina and Sushmita and Ektaa Kapoor?s Kya Kool Hai Hum with Tusshar, Ritesh and Neha Dhupia.?

 But in between all these desi assignments don?t be surprised if Ishaa does a chhota stint in the West. ?It?s possible... I have been blessed with a face which is both Indian and Western.?

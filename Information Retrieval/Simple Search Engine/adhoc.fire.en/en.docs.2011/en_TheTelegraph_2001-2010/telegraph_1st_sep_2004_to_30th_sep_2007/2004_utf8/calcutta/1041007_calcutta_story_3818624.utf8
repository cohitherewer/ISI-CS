Bid that tan goodbye

Ship Shape

Skin-lightening treatments remove the toasty 

layer and perfect your pre-Puja preen, finds Himika Chaudhuri

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who?s the fairest of them 

all? If you never dared to ask this question , here is some hope for all those 

who equate beauty with pale skin. Thanks to skin-lightening treatments available 

in various parlours and spas around the city, you now have a chance to get rid 

of that tan that you have been sporting ever since the summer simmer started. 

All you need in hand is a couple of hours of your time and a couple hundred rupees.

Whether you plan to go pandal hopping or intend to 

spend the festive days at cosy parties at home, gleaming skin could be part of 

the pre-Puja preen package.

?The treatment helps remove the dark screen on the 

skin, which is caused by over-exposure to the sun. The result is fairer and brighter 

skin,? explains Rutu Tawde, spa manager of Solace, the fitness centre at Sunny 

Park. The treatment is offered along with the bridal package at the spa. ?It is 

also perfect for the festive season, when everyone wants to look their best,? 

adds Ruby Biswas of Saajo, a North Calcutta beauty parlour.

?The treatment is perfect for the working woman who 

doesn?t find time to pamper herself, but don?t be in a rush as it takes at least 

two-and-a-half hours to get rid of the tan,? says Rutu.

Most parlours use Jansen, a German product that contains 

mulberry extract and claims to be very good for the skin. ?Repeated skin lightening 

facials can lighten the skin quite significantly,? believes Saroj Mundra of Rapunzel 

beauty salon.

Here are a few of the places offering the peachy promise:

Solace

The elaborate affair begins with scrubbing the entire 

body. The use of Himalayan herbs and essential oils gives a refreshing feel. After 

a wash, you are back to the cool confines of the room to be smothered in a cream 

souffle. With lights dimmed and soft music playing in the background, you can 

take a 25-minute nap as trained masseurs get to work. Depending on your skin type, 

the souffle uses a powder or cream to remove the pigmentation.

Time taken: Two-and-a-half hours

Price: Rs 700 plus taxes for the scrub and 

Rs 875 plus taxes for the pack

?We use Mineral Line products for the skin lightening 

facial. The beauty package, especially the Dead Sea scrub, is believed to help 

immensely in the removal of excess pigmentation,? observes Sharon, a beauty consultant 

at the salon.

Use of aroma oils as part of the treatment, helps 

rejuvenate tired bodies and minds, further adding to the holistic glow.

Time taken: 1 hour

Price: Rs 950

Park Tropicana

The Park Street salon has a slightly different approach. 

?We use a special aroma gel to remove the tan depending on the skin type of the 

person,? says beautician Subhra Dutta. The skin is cleansed before the gel is 

applied. The next step is to apply a pack on the face (including the lips and 

eyes). Once the pack dries, it is wiped off to uncover soft, glowing and fairer 

skin.

Time taken: 1 hour

Price: Rs 1,000

Rapunzel

Here too, the German import is preferred. ?We use 

the Jansen products because the mulberry extracts and vitamin C content are very 

good for the skin,? points out Saroj Mundra.

Time taken: One-and-a-half to two hours

Price: Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,500, depending on skin 

type

Saajo

At this parlour, the prescription for lighter and 

more radiant skin is to use the treatment twice a month for the first three months.

?After that, you can reduce application to just once 

a month,? she says. ?We use Jansen products as well since they contain agents 

that help exfoliate the skin and also help to lighten complexion and fade age 

spots.?

Time taken: 1 hour

Price: Rs 1,200

 Dalhousie, fair and Square

 - Plans afoot to restore, beautify business hub as heritage zone

 SWATI SENGUPTA 

 The focal point of the city ? Dalhousie Square (BBD Bag) ? could possibly become more picturesque if Friday?s meeting at Writers? Buildings between the state government and a representative of the New York-based World Monuments Fund (WMF) yields any positive results. Plans are afoot to improve and preserve the square as a heritage zone. 

 Mark Weber, technical director of WMF, an international conservation organisation, said: ?We are trying to work out a plan to develop Dalhousie as a heritage zone, and the WMF is investing its energy, time and expertise to translate the plan into reality.? However, he made it clear that no funds were forthcoming. 

 WMF is a well-known private, international, non-profit organisation, involved over the past 40 years in the preservation of imperilled works of art and architecture. The WMF technical director went around Dalhousie Square and talked to senior government officials about the plan. 

 In the evening, Weber met principal secretary to the chief minister Arun Bhattacharya at Nandan.

 ?Dalhousie Square has been included on the WMF list of 100 most-endangered sites. The list includes sites like the Panama Canal, the Great Wall of China Cultural Landscape, Dampier Rock Art Complex in Australia, and so on. We hope to see a masterplan work out, and observe the stakeholders? interest,? Weber explained. 

 A committee, comprising the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, public works department, private players and the government will be formed soon, Arun Bhattacharya said. ?We have started work in right earnest. A concept plan is likely by early next year, and will be tabled at a conference that is to come up in February,? he said.

 City-based consulting architect and conservator Manish Chakraborti had nominated the site on behalf of the Action Research in Conservation of Heritage (ARCH) to the WMF, enabling Dalhousie Square to be included in the WMF list. The project was submitted by ARCH and supported by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach).

 ?Our point is to make the area cleaner, and focus on improvement, taking into account the sidewalks, streets, signage, streetlights, restoration of buildings and so on,? Weber said. 

 ?The fact that we are interested in the project does not necessarily mean we are offering funds. However, the point is to get a lot of people ? private players and the government ? interested in the project, which means there shouldn?t be a dearth of funds, whatever the source,? he added.

 Here is another taste of the Durga Puja 2004 food offering. Watch out for more on the menu...

Orko?s

 Calcutta is all set to bite into a new range of delicacies as the city gets its first ?kebabs only? restaurant, Orko?s, at City Centre, from October 15.

 The launch on Friday afternoon saw actor-singer-film-maker Anjan Dutt dropping in at the 100-seater Indian eatery. ?The food obviously is the focus, but our USP is specialised service and ambience,? said director Orkopal Sen.

 It?s kebabs all the way as you get everything from the mundane to the exotic. With paratha and biryani also on offer, the menu has mind-boggling options.

 Chefs from Delhi promise to toss up the best in an interactive kitchen. The decor of this fourth floor, 3,200 sq ft address is flush with style, colour and excellent lighting. Unlimited kebabs come at just Rs 300, plus taxes, per platter.

 ?With trained waiters to suggest the kind of kebabs each guest should try, eating at Orko?s is going to be a great experience,? gushes the owner.

ITC sonar bangla

 The five festive days ? Sashthi through Dashami ? will see a special splash at ITC Sonar Bangla?s eateries. Pala, the banquets, will offer a flavour of each of the restaurants, taking in cuisine from around the world. A seafood blitz will bombard the rest of the hotel. Eden Pavilion is serving up everything from calamari to oyster. Reel in the catch of the day at Pan Asian, where the freshest seafood can be ordered by weight, not portion. Peshawri will zero in on seafood kebabs, while Dumpukht will focus on Bengali fare. For the party people, Dublin will remain open on all Puja days.

Starstruck

 This multicuisine restaurant at Forum has introduced Mongolian fare as a permanent part of its dinner menu. This is the first choice for a quick bite, as you can choose from a variety of noodles, vegetables, meat and sauce, to be tossed into a bowl by the chef. 

 ?There is no fixed menu. It is what you make it out to be ? bland or sinfully spicy,? explains Bunty Sethi, owner, Starstruck. One helping is good enough for two diners if they are small eaters. ?We allow people to share their food as long as they don?t make a second trip to the counter, for which they are charged again,? adds Sethi.

 It is priced at Rs 200 for the vegetarian fare, Rs 250 for chicken and lamb toppings and another Rs 25 for prawn.

Tangerine

 The Outram Street eatery will feature an interactive buffet on each of the festive days, comprising an assortment of culinary delights. It will include light bites like Thai Papaya Salad, Aloo Papri Chaat, Chicken Tikka Salad, Shredded Lamb Salad, Dimsum and more.

 The various combinations at the vegetarian and non-vegetarian counters will be changed every day. For non-vegetarians, there will be a new style of prawn, chicken and mutton, like Yangste Chilli Prawn, Lagaan Gosht and Roast Chicken with Chilli Mint Jus on Sashthi. An assortment of bread, noodles and pulao also will be at hand.

 For dessert, dig into fruit, chocolate or low-calorie options. Lunch or dinner, the buffet comes for Rs 300, which includes a pint of beer.

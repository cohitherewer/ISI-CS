 Can do better with better facilities

Sandip Banerjee: Is the present infrastructure sufficient to handle the scale of unfair trade practices?

 The department of legal metrology has branches in all districts of the state. Besides, there are inspectors who keep tabs on local traders and markets. In every district, the department is headed by an assistant controller. In course of our regular raids and seizure of goods, we often come across traders who are ignorant of the legal trading norms. There is hardly any agency which can inform the trading community about the rules.

 With a couple of hundreds officials, it is impossible to educate all traders. We are now stressing on group awareness so information about legal metrology could be spread in a chain reaction. However, as a major revenue generator, we can always expect better infrastructure to strengthen our vigil.

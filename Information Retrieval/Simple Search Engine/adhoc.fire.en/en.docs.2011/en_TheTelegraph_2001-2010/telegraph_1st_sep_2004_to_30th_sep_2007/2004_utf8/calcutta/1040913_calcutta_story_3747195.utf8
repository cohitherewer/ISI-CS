The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A sobering influence

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 Alcoholism lost him his job in the navy, his wife, his daughter and parents. Having hit rockbottom, Vikas Sengupta (name changed) came to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in 1999.

 He has been sober since; he has a new job as regional security manager of an international courier company; his parents have their son back; he is best of friends with his ex-wife and is an active participant at parent-teacher meets at his daughter?s school. ?Thanks to AA, I no longer feel I am living on borrowed time,? said the 38-year old. 

 Sengupta is one of the increasing number of people who ?owe? their lives to AA. The Calcutta chapter, which turns 21 on September 19, was started with a handful of people and now has over 500 members ? 350 of whom have enrolled in the past five years. 

 Though there has been a steep rise in AA membership in the city, there is reason to believe that many alcoholics are loathe to enrol, considering the taboo associated with the idea.

 ?We get over 40 calls a week at our centre, of which, at the most, only 10 finally enrol. Of these 10 new entries, may be only a few stay on for meetings over a long period,? said a member of AA and a recovering alcoholic. 

 ?Another change that has come about is the number of women calling for help. Earlier, we would get one phone call in a fortnight. Now, we get eight to 10 from women every week. But, it is still much more difficult for women in the state to enrol as alcoholics,? said Rakesh Guha (name changed), another AA member.

 Life for 46-year-old Guha, a social drinker-turned-alcoholic, had turned around after he joined AA in 2001. ?I had lost my job and my sanity to alcohol. Since joining, I have married and now my wife, who has attended a few meetings with me, is my staunchest supporter,? said Guha. 

 The 500-odd members of AA meet at least twice every week in 11 groups across the city, such as the ones in Howrah, Salt Lake, Ripon Street (St Mary?s School), Market Street (St Antony?s School), Ballygunge Circular Road (St Lawrence School), Park Street (St Xavier?s School), Shyambazar, Behala, Rashbehari Avenue (Lycee School) and Jadavpur. 

 ?Of the 500 members at any given time, 20 per cent are not fully clean,? explains Sengupta. ?Even if you have been sober for years, you remain an alcoholic all your life, because this is an incurable disease,? he said. 

 He pointed out that 99 per cent of alcoholics suffer relapses when they go through a rehab programme without a support system like the AA. ?The bond we forge at voluntary meetings keeps us alive.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fortnight crusade for girls in distress

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For all women tortured and abused. For all women who suffer in silence and wince in pain. It is for them that a fortnight of protest and campaign is set to roll from Thursday in Calcutta. 

 The International Campaign to Stop Violence against Women and Girls (West Bengal chapter), starting November 25, holds a lot of promise of celebration and protest with mobile mass-awareness programmes, street plays, poster exhibitions, songs, poetry-readings, interactive sessions with doctors, rallies, workshops, seminars, panel discussions, debates, contests? the list goes on. 

 ?The events over the next fortnight will be conducted by various partners of the West Bengal campaign coordinating committee,? explained Parul Mittal, on behalf of the organisers. ?We have 63 participants this time, against eight last year. NGOs have taken up the onus of each programme at the various venues and it is through their grassroot communities that we hope to reach out to the maximum number of people.?

 At the outset, the campaign agenda has a memorial service for women who have lost their lives to violence and a tribute to the fortunate others who survived. Film personality Aparna Sen will inaugurate the event at Shahid Minar on Thursday. 

 Mittal mentioned other programmes on the campaign menu. ?There will be a student cultural exchange programme on November 30, in which students from Bangladesh will perform with Chandrabindoo at Nazrul Mancha. Since we are targeting the 18-25 age-group this year, we hope programmes like these will attract youngsters and help spread the good word.?

 An integral part of the campaign fortnight will be a mobile van that will follow a pre-designated route to various schools and colleges from 8 am to 9 pm every day. At the brief stopovers, the campaigners will distribute posters, stickers, caps, T-shirts and other awareness kits. ?Through our poster catchline Wah, kya cheez hai, we have tried to capture the essence of the silent harassment that girls and women suffer every day, bombarded with apparently harmless barbs,? explained Mittal.

 The fortnight will also include the celebration of World AIDS Day on December 1 and World Disability Day on December 3. ?We have many organisations working with HIV-AIDS problems and others working with the disabled as partners in our programmes,? said Mittal, listing Actionaid, Prajak, Sanlaap, Mobility India, Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, Child In Need Institute and others as the partners involved. 

 ?Last year, out choice of venue did not attract many people. This time, with venues at Shahid Minar, Nazrul Mancha, the Maidan and schools and colleges, we hope to see enough participation,? signed off Mittal.

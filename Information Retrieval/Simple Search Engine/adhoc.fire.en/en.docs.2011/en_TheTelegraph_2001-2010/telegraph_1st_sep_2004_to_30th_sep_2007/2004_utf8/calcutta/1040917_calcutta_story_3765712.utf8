The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sparkle, style and celeb speak 

It?s 

no longer enough for your work (read wares) to speak for itself. It?s become mandatory 

to second the brand equity with some celeb speak ? or at least celeb click. Long-shining 

stars and just-twinkling starlets can be caught at their active best at this time 

of the year. Some of the best known faces from tinsel town ? yesterday, today 

and tomorrow ? went on a ribbon round in the past 48 hours, pushing products and 

promises in style. We collected some stardust to power your Puja countdown?

Actress Koel Mullick added to the sparkle of Oyzterbay 

diamond jewellery on Wednesday. The occasion: launch of a treasure box with one 

key at the Park Street outlet. The lucky customer whose key fits stands to win 

contests, the contents of which are not yet out of the box.

The store, which boasts of intricate and trendy diamond jewellery, is open seven days a week. If no key fits by mid-October, a lucky draw will be conducted.

Veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee has also had to 

learn some trend talk and is delivering the buy banter as well as his Ray lines 

(or maybe not quite).

 Sold on the stuff from Sharbari Dutta?s stable as far as kurta couture goes, Chatterjee was equally ?amazed to see the vast collection of styles and designs? at Orly?s, the outlet at 3B Upper Wood Street, on Thursday afternoon.

Celebrating its 15th birthday, the store took the 

opportunity to launch its festive collection. From urbane chikan and cotton 

kurtas for Rs 350 onwards to the opulence of sherwanis and bandhgalas 

with lavish embellishments for Rs 4,500 onwards, the store?s got something for 

every festive do. 

 A collection of cotton formals, semi-formal and ethnic shirts in solids, checks and stripes under the in-house brand, Dali, pitches in for those in-between times. 

 Looking as glamorous as ever in a striking orange sari and classy silver jewellery, was actress, director and editor of Sananda, Aparna Sen, waxing eloquent on matters of home and hearth at the Crossword bookstore on a balmy Thursday evening. For once the quotes matched the occasion ? the launch of Sampurna, the latest publication from Sananda?s stable.

 Detailing tips on home d?cor, the book is a celebration of the popular Bengali magazine?s motto for the past 18 years: ?to be utilitarian, to serve the people with insights to create a home and hearth of their choice?.

 Stylishly designed with several pictorial journeys into the homes of Calcuttans like Rituparno Ghosh, Arun Lal and Renu Roy, the book packs in handy tips to enliven a home by simple do-it-yourself methods. Divided into numerous sub-sections, it explores the correct use of bath tiles, kitchen sinks, Vaastu, lighting, wallpaper and more. 

 ?Wallpaper,? said Sen, ?can be created by tearing up and rebuilding tiles, using fabrics and even painting it in designs suitable to the person?s taste. One need not hire a professional, but merely use the handy guidelines to create a personal space for oneself.? 

 The book is priced at a modest Rs 100.

 Oozing oodles of attitude in a shimmering green chiffon sari at the inauguration of the city?s eighth Caf? Coffee Day outlet on Ballygunge Circular Road was actress Koneenica Banerjee. Co-actor Saswata Chatterjee (in the forthcoming flick Aabar Ashbo Phire) tagged along, doing a little balancing act.

 What followed was lots of adda and endless rounds of coffee as director Ravi Ojha joined his star cast in a t?te-?-t?te revolving around the big-ticket film due to hit the halls on September 24. 

 ?I am very excited and tense,? confessed Koneenica, ?fighting the butterflies? in her stomach.

 Caf? Coffee Day is running a contest in all its outlets across the city. Winners will fetch CDs, cassettes and tickets for the film, while a lucky few will get to chat up the stars at the Ballygunge shop.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pension PAN on the cards

 Nand Kishore, accountant-general (accounts amp; entitlement) met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. 

Participants included Md. Amiruzzaman, D. Ghosh, Santanu Bhattacharjee, Ranajit Basu, Pranabesh Das and Sanjana Basu

Santanu Bhattacharjee: The provident fund ommission 

has introduced a number analogous to PAN to identify PF holders. Why don't you, 

too, employ such innovative methods? 

At present, we don?t have a system of issuing cards 

or any special number to the pensioners for the identification of their files 

lying with us for transaction. But we may introduce such a system in future. Presently, 

we assign a number to the files of each pensioner. This serves as the pensioner?s 

identification number, too. 

All our records are prepared using that number as 

the index number for the pension-holder. If any pensioner wants, he may submit 

his file number to the Pension Facilitation Cell (PFC). It will be treated as 

his identification number. 

D.Ghosh: All these systems and infrastructure 

are available in this office only. How do pension-holders in the districts benefit?

 We do not have any offices in the districts. All pension files are received here. To settle any dispute or to furnish any information, pensioners often have to come to us. In case of multiple queries, one has to come more than once. We know how tough it is for a person living in a far-flung district to come to us. On the top of that, he may have to stay in the city for a couple of days to complete the formalities. 

To find a way out, officials are visiting the district 

headquarters at regular intervals. They try to sort out the cases there, taking 

them up with the departments concerned. They ask for the documents, absence of 

which had resulted in the file being held up.

Ranajit Basu: Do you have any office in the districts 

to inform pensioners about the visits?

No, we don?t. Our officials generally coordinate from 

the office of the district magistrate. A pensioner having problems with his files 

can come and meet the visiting official. In fact, the visits are aimed at enhancing 

the pensioners? access to us, so they can feel free to express their problems. 

Sanjana Basu: How can pensioners in the districts 

come to know about the visits?

 There are three ways a pensioner can know about the visits made by our officials. They can know from the offices of various departments that deal with us. For, we inform the departments beforehand so they can keep their documents ready. Pensioners can also know about the visit by calling the Pension Facilitation Cell, in Calcutta. 

Our officials in the Cell will inform them about the 

details of the visit and how the visiting officials can be contacted. The third 

way to know is to keep in touch with officials at the district magistrate?s office. 

Pranabesh Das: What are the hurdles you are presently 

facing in tackling pension cases?

 As such, there is no any hurdle in tackling the cases. We, however, face some problems because a few cases are pending in courts. Fortunately, the cases pending for a long time are being sorted out fast. 

We are planning to expand the scope of the Pension 

Forums and re-designate them so that various aspects of pending pension cases 

can be addressed. To achieve this, we want to organise joint participative seminars/workshops 

with the state government. Our aim is to make all pension sanctioning offices 

fully conversant with the common loopholes and drawbacks that come in the way 

of speedy disposal of cases.

Md. Amiruzzaman: Is your department thinking of 

seeking any technical help to reach out to the pensioners?

 We are thinking to introduce an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to enable the pensioner to know about the status of his file, which is very crucial in approving his pension claim. 

 We will assign identification numbers to all pension applicants. After dialling a particular number, the applicant has to put in the identification number and can know which department is looking after the file

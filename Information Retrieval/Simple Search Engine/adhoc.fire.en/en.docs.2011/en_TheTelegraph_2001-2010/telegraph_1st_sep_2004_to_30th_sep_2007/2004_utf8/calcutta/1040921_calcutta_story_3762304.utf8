 Scurry for certificates among much-married couples

 SIMI KAMBOJ 

Amitava Chakraborty and wife Sandhya are in a fix. Both in their late 60s, they 

live in a Sunny Park apartment. The Chakrabortys want to visit their daughter 

in the US and have applied for a visa. Though married for over 35 years, they 

have no documentary proof of their wedding. They approach a marriage officer in 

Ballygunge, who supervises the registration. Two months later, the elated couple 

calls up the officer to announce they?re off to the US. 

Businessman Ashok Pal wants to open a joint account with Moumita, his wife of 

15 years. The Pals, residents of Lord Sinha Road, have to wait for over a month 

to open the account because the bank wants proof of their marriage. Only after 

they obtain a certificate are they allowed to open the account.

 Waking up to the need for registration of their marriages, hundreds of couples are thronging registration offices to legalise their union.

 ?A majority of them have been married for 10 years or more, but had not felt the need to register their wedding. Now, with banks, insurance companies and even schools demanding marriage certificates, couples are making a beeline for the document,? said Manashree Chatterjee, secretary, Progressive Marriage Officers? Association.

 Close to 150 such couples are visiting marriage offices every month to collect their certificates. The trend, officials say, has caught on over the past five years.

 ?The document is a must for couples seeking a visa. Banks and insurance firms are increasingly insisting on it. Several couples come for certificates while entering into deals over land or investments,? said marriage officer Mamata Banerjee.

 The rush for the document is most visible among defence personnel, who want to name their wives as nominees.

 Against this backdrop, the office of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages is planning to rope in priests to do the needful. 

 According to the proposal, the priests are to be empanelled with the local civic body. They will keep a record of every marriage they officiate and pass on the information to the registrar?s office every quarter. 

 ?The idea stems from the Christian system of marriage, where licence ministers who solemnise the marriage take care of the registration,? said an official in the registrar-general?s office. 

 The registration problem, officials point out, occurs mostly in Hindu marriages. 

 ?We have seen that 40 per cent of the grooms who apply for registration under the Hindu Marriage Act do not turn up for registration once the wedding is solemnised. Consequently, if the husband abandons the wife later, she is unable to claim her rights, because she has no documentary proof of the marriage,? an official added.

 Christian marriages and Muslim nikahs are simpler: these are solemnised by ministers and kaazis, who are legally empowered to register the marriage.

 More than 300 marriage registration offices are in Calcutta. Across the state, there are around 1,500 such offices. 

 ?Registration of marriage helps a woman secure her socio-economic and legal rights, as well as succession rights for her children,? Gurupada Bayen, registrar of births, deaths and marriages, pointed out. 

 In August 2002, the government had hiked the registration fee under the Hindu and Special Marriage Acts from Rs 45 to Rs 420. A couple is charged Rs 60 extra for a double copy of the certificate. The marriage officer collects two-third of the registration fee, while the rest goes to the government coffers.

 If marriage registration is made compulsory, 2.5 to three lakh couples will enrol every year, enabling the government to mop up a neat Rs 40 crore.

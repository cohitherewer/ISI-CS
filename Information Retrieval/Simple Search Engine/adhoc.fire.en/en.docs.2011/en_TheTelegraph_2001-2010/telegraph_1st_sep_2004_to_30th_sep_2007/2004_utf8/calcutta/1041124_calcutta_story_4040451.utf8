 ?Swindler? denied bail

 Jhawar: Web of blackmail

 Madhu Jhawar, who figures high on the city police?s most-wanted list for allegedly blackmailing businessmen, was rejected anticipatory bail by the court on Tuesday.

 Thirty-five-year-old Jhawar would allegedly lure her victims to her home, drug them and rob them of their valuables.

 Her photographer accomplice would take pictures of the men in compromising positions, which she later used to blackmail them.

 ?All this while we could not arrest Jhawar since she had sought anticipatory bail. We will pick her up soon,? said detective chief Peeyush Pandey.

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Justice Amitava Lala and Justice P.K. Deb, rejected Jhawar?s bail plea on Tuesday.

 Police said Jhawar came to Calcutta from Guwahati two years ago. She would pose as a social worker in need or a helpless widow or as a divorcee with no means to support her son, and approach affluent businessmen for help.

 On certain occasions, Jhawar even played blue films to entertain her ?guests? at her rented apartment in Lake Town. The drinks she offered would be laced with sedatives.

 Later, she would threaten to pass on their photographs to their families. Cornered, the businessmen would cough up the exorbitant sums she demanded.

 Twenty-five victims later, Jhawar had amassed around Rs 2 crore.

 In October, the detective department received complaints against her from businessman Kailash Bihani and palmist Narayan Das Daga. 

 Police raided Jhawar?s Lake Town residence and seized two dozen photographs of her alleged victims, initiated a case against Jhawar and busted the honey trap.

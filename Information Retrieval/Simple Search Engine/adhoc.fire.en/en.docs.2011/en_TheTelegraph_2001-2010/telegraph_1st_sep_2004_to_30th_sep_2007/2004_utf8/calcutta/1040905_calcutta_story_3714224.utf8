The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Gearing up for a Royal salute

The ball is not quite a perfect lie yet and the rough 

edges along the walk are still being smoothened. But theres no missing the excitement 

in the air around the sprawling, 195-acre oasis. As the grand old lady decks up 

for the big bash, its time to get the skin graft, make-up and manicure to match 

the splendour of the occasion.

The weeklong gala to celebrate the 175th anniversary 

of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), the oldest golfing greens outside the 

British Isles, tees off on November 20 with the spectacular glow golf rounds along 

candle-lit fairways, and bids adieu on November 28. An RCGC Celebration Symposium 

on November 24 will analyse the link among golf, industry and tourism.

Outgoing captain Ashit Luthra and his committee promise 

that the Royal would be pretty as a picture in time for the party. The refurbishing 

and beautification drive started with the bowling green at the RCGC Maidan tent. 

Ours is the only lawn bowling green in the country and we have re-laid it with 

new grass to meet international specifications with an eye on the 2010 Commonwealth 

Games, says Luthra. The wooden pavilion has also been renovated and the illumination 

on the green upgraded.

On the main club campus on Golf Club Road, the third 

shamiana, the gents changing room and the Mountbatten (tea) Lounge are 

all being remodelled. The course, which naturally peaks in Calcutta only around 

February, is also being primed to be shipshape for the birthday bash, which will 

feature fun events like golf with your spouse and golf for seniors (55-plus).

While doing up the greens and fairways, we are careful 

to preserve both the rawness of the course for the golfer as well as the manicured 

look for the visitor, says CEO Manmohan Singh.

The captain of the Royal amp; Ancient Golf Club of 

St Andrews will be one of the guests at the welcome dinner for outstation participants 

on November 26, and the club expects around 75 foreign delegates including representatives 

from the 61 Royal golf clubs around the world. Luthra and golf convenor Kapil 

Sood had been invited to attend the 250th anniversary of St Andrews in Scotland 

(picture above left).

Theres nothing so past as a past captain, feels 

Luthra, but he looks back on his tenure with a fair degree of contentment. When 

we took over, there were three main objectives before us to solve the labour 

issue, to have a championship-ready golf course and make the cash flow positive. 

By and large, we have achieved all the targets, he smiles.

Sood agrees there are a lot of positives to take home. 

Its easy to be at the helm when the going is good. But when the captain took 

over, the club was at ground zero in terms of image, upkeep and administration, 

and we didnt have any reserves The club has since gained financially and now 

has control over people, staff and property, he observes.

With the groundwork done, the incoming committee (the 

AGM is on September 17) can focus on a masterplan to first give the club a Royal 

salute this November and then drive hard for glory.

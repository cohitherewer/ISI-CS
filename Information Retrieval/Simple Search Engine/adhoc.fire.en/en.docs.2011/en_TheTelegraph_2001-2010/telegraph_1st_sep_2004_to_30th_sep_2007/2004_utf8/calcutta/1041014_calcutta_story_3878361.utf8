The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Banibrata Basu

 Joint commissioner of police, traffic, Calcutta Police

 This will be difficult to implement. It will also lure traffic personnel towards corruption. From our viewpoint, though, the proposal is great. The percentage of roads in Calcutta is small in comparison to the traffic volume. If people use car pools, the space taken up by car parking will be saved. It is parking that creates congestion in front of the schools. We cannot stop people from buying cars. But there can be some rule to control their use. In Singapore, for instance, they allow odd-numbered cars to take the streets on some days of the week and even-numbered cars on other days. Another solution could be putting restrictions on parking. There is an astronomical fee to park in central London. But here the fee is the same for all times and for all places. The Corporation may put an astronomical fee on parking in the central business district.

 Diyas have given way to aromatic, floating candles. Ethnic ensembles no longer come from Burrabazar. No wonder sweets ? so much a part of the festival of lights ? have also changed form and flavour. The local halwai has packed up, leaving the sweet legacy to the big shops, which have lived up to the challenge, innovating with the designer touch. Cartons have given way to bright packaging in all manner of material. Here is a menu made for the sweet tooth this Dhanteras and beyond:

Gupta Brothers

 The ?Abar Khabo Shoppe? is having a culinary bonanza called Festive Treats. The sweetmeat extravaganza entails lip-smacking mithai, savouries and delectable give-aways. It also showcases an array of ?designer sweets and namkeens? in various shapes and sizes. 

 The special Diwali Ki Thali consists of an irresistible combination of Missi Roti, Jodhpuri Kofta, Meva Pulao, Bikaneri Rasmalai Aur Sanger Ka Kofta and Gatte Ka Sag, as well as other sweets. It is priced at Rs 125.

 Custom-made corporate gift hampers cost between Rs 101 and Rs 500.

 Dry fruit laddoos are priced between Rs 150 and Rs 180 per kg. The range of sandeshes like Sukha Sandesh, Jalbhara Sandesh and special Light Delight Sandesh, are priced between Rs 6 and Rs 10 per piece.

Gokul

More than mithai

 They look good, taste great. That is the main selling point of cookies, candies and confectioneries that have flooded the Diwali market. All those bored of dishing out the standard fare of sweets are turning to more western options instead. 

 The innovations however, delightful as they are, come at a price. And isn?t that the point, with what you give as a festive token becoming a status symbol of sorts.

 Here are some options for those thinking out of the mithai box:

Saffron

 Cr?me Brulee Khubani ka Meetha is the main draw. Strewn with steamed apricots, this dessert is a light adaptation of the Andhra speciality. The Chocolate Gulab Jamun is stuffed with chocolate and dipped in chocolate sauce. Rich Almond Halwa, along with Gajar Ka Halwa, Phirni and Kulfi are being dished out. Mishti doi finds a new avatar as Mishti Doi Mousse.

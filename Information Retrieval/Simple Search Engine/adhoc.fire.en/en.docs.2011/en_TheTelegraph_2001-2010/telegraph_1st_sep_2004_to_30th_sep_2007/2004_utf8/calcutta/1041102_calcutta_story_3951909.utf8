 Midnight robbery in city centre store

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Robbers struck at one of the oldest electronics stores in town, walking away with goods and cash amounting to over Rs 35 lakh.

 The Chowringhee showroom of Capital Electronics was robbed sometime between midnight and early Sunday morning. The crime, in the heart of the city?s business district, wasn?t discovered till Monday morning.

 ?Not only is this a heavily policed area, but the shop also had private security personnel,? said Rajiv Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central) on Monday.

 Sanjeev Agarwal, partner of the 60-year-old Capital Electronics, said he and his staff discovered the robbery at around 10.15 am on Monday. Security personnel, attached to a private agency, only noticed the broken exhaust grille at 9 pm on Sunday night.

 The shop houses Capital Enterprises, Capital Chowringhee and Capital Electronics. The Esplanade showroom is one of several run by the Agarwal family as separate entities under the Capital Electronics banner.

 Police believe the thieves entered the premises through an exhaust vent. ?Investigations are on and we are exploring the possibility of inside involvement,? said Kumar.

 ?They stole goods and cash amounting to Rs 35 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, according to estimates,? said Agarwal. They also swiped US $1,000 that he kept in a laptop case on the premises.

 Expensive cell phones, digital and SLR cameras, VCDs, handycams, a synthesiser and wristwatches are among the goods stolen. Seven cash-boxes were broken and emptied out.

 Around 90 cell phones ? ranging from Rs 1,800 to Rs 20,000 ? have apparently been taken, as have more than 60 wristwatches, worth between Rs 1,200 and Rs 5,000 each. While the robbers broke into seven sub cash boxes, they could not locate the main cash box.

With the shop shut on Sunday, the robbers had time 

on their side, and managed to ransack both floors of the store.

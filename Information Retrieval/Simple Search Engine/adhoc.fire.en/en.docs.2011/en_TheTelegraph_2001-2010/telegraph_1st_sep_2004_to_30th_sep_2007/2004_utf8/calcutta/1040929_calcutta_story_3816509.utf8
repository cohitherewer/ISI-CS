 The City Diary

 Sports-lovers, particularly football fans, were at the receiving end of another cable dispute as sports bouquet ESPN STAR Sports disappeared from the network of multi-system operator (MSO) Manthan. The MSO has nearly 400,000 households in and around the city.

 he sports bouquet is currently beaming crucial Champions League matches, involving heavyweights like Real Madrid, Manchester United, Liverpool and Juventus. According to ESPN STAR Sports, the MSO has run up dues of nearly Rs 1 crore over the past three months. ESPN STAR Sports ran an ?on-screen display? on Monday evening, informing Manthan viewers that the channels were liable for disconnection. 

 ollowing the message, Manthan switched off the channels late on Monday.

 The outstanding ESPN is claiming is due to a revamp proposed by them, which we did not agree to,? said a Manthan official. ESPN STAR Sports, however, denied the allegation, saying Manthan is already paying according to the revamped rates. ?We have not switched off the channels and don?t want to deprive Calcuttans of sporting action, but Manthan has to pay up,? the sports bouquet added. Owing to soccer pressure, perhaps, reports of the channel being pirated were received from different parts of the city.

 Power supply to Tiljala and parts of the Ballygunge, Bhowanipore, Southern Avenue and the Rashbehari Avenue areas is likely to be affected from 7 am to 10 am and from 3 pm to 5 pm on Wednesday because of work by CESC engineers to boost the distribution system. ?The high-tension network reorganisation job will be carried out at the Ritchie Road distribution station,? said a CESC official. 

 Three students were killed in separate accidents in the city and its adjoining areas on Tuesday morning. Puja Singh, 12, was killed near the Taratala-Hyde Road crossing. She was going to school, riding pillion with friend Sunita Kumari Tiwari on a motorcycle driven by father Rajendra Singh. A lorry dashed the two-wheeler from behind. All three were taken to SSKM Hospital, where doctors declared Puja dead. Singh and Tiwari are being treated. The driver fled with his vehicle. 

 n Barasat, Arjun Nahar and Saharin Khatun, both 16 years old, were run over by a lorry at 7 am. The truck was impounded, but the driver managed to escape. Later, local residents put up a roadblock, demanding the driver?s arrest. 

 he blockade was lifted after senior police officers intervened and assured the protesters of taking immediate action to arrest the driver. 

 Surendra Lal, 45, died of injuries he sustained in the head after falling off a bus at the Netaji Subhas Road-Mahatma Gandhi Road crossing at 3 pm on Tuesday.

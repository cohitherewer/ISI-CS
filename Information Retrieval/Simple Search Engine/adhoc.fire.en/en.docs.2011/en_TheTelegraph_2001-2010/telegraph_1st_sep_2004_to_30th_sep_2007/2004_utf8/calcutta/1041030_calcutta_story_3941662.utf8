The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Echoes of voices from past

An opinionated barber, a philosophic tailor, an overseer 

inclined towards spirituality... faces drift into Samir Mukerjee?s vision

From the labyrinths of the past come echoes of footfalls 

which I was once familiar with. It then becomes easy to resurrect those special 

people who came into my life, filled it with lingering colours and withdrew in 

silence. My father?s barber, Hari, was a remarkably robust character who had stories 

to tell and opinions to offer without being prompted. He used to shave Subhas 

Chandra Bose and had a tremendous admiration for him. Hari had no respect for 

Mahatma Gandhi and his ritual fasts. According to him, the Mahatma?s fasts were 

an absolute sham as he kept going on goat?s milk and fruit juices. Our barber 

felt that Ghandhiji?s non-violent non-cooperation would never drive the 

British out. Such a slow and tortuous method would only perpetuate British rule. 

We enjoyed his acerbic comments when he talked in this vein. With a cut-throat 

razor he did a superb job on my father. On his way out he was always ready with 

his valedictory remarks for me. 

Mohammad Selim was a very efficient tailor who worked 

for Rankin at one time when the British presence in Calcutta was very strong. 

He learnt all his skills there and came to us in the middle ?40s. His tailoring 

was flawless and there was no question of trials and retrials. He made very smart 

suits for us. His sartorial style was that of a minor Muslim dignitary. With a 

Jinnah cap adorning his head, he came attired in a sherwani and loose pyjamas. 

He wore pump shoes with a bow stuck on top which a lot of Muslims wore in those 

days. His shirt front was invariably stained by paan juice. While he was 

taking our measurements he kept chewing paan and sometimes I caught a whiff 

of some heady ittar from behind his ears. When he was in a relaxed mood 

he used to come up with verses like: 

?Shohrat ke bulandi bhi pal bhar ka tamasha hai

Jis shakh pe baithe ho, who toot bhi sakti hai?

(The heights of fame can be a fleeting fallacy/ Even 

the branch you are sitting on can snap)

How many tailors would be armed with such philosophical 

observations? 

My mother?s Bengali tailor, Noor Mohammad Laskar, 

came all the way from Metiabruz to make her blouses and petticoats. He was a dear, 

amiable old man but often complained about his niggling infirmities. What he needed 

was vitamins and nutritious food but he was too poor to afford them. Inspite of 

these handicaps, the smile on his face denoted simplicity and a sort of primeval 

innocence. Mother might have shouted at him for his goof-ups, but he never lost 

his equanimity. 

My grandfather had a few overseers who would drop 

by occasionally to attend to specific problems concerning the house. There was 

the antediluvian Narsingh Hazra whose face was criss crossed with furrows. He 

looked as if he had stepped out of the 19th century with his inordinate gentleness 

and gravity. He always wore a jacket over his dhoti. He was a devotee of 

Sri Ramakrishna and longed to spend the last years of his life in Kamarpukur. 

When I met him, he had already taken charge of his inner life so that the work 

he did in my grandfather?s house and in Martin Burn Ltd was probably no more than 

a stopgap arrangement. 

Upen Ghosh Dastidar was an artist who had painted 

some pictures for our drawing room when we stepped into our new house, at 6 Lower 

Circular Road, in April 1941. They were very dreamy and evocative representations 

of Omar Khayyam and Saqi in a close huddle, lost to the outside world in a trance-like 

state. The palpitating lines of Fitzgerald summed up the situation: 

?Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough

A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse and Thou

Beside me singing in the wilderness

And wilderness is Paradise now?. 

To a child like me those wispy and ethereal paintings 

seemed the very quintessence of romance. Upen Dastidar also drew innumerable pictures 

of gods and goddesses in my copybook, nurtured carefully for a long time. They 

were part of grandfather?s engineering world but had very interesting personalities. 

Ambuj Nath Banerjee was my mother?s cousin. Baramama 

stood first class first in ancient Indian history in his MA examination. He was 

meant to be an academic. Due to parental pressure he was forced to study law and 

become a pleader. The law courts appalled him and I remember him telling me he 

could never be a successful lawyer as he abhorred lies and duplicity. 

I have never met a more self-effacing and intrinsically 

kind person. During the ferocious August riots in 1946, he travelled by tram all 

the way from Shyambazar to our house on Lower Circular Road. Personal safety never 

worried him, he hadn?t quite given up the ideal of human goodness and that probably 

sustained him when the city had gone berserk. I used to enjoy his tea time conversation. 

Here was a man who wasted his sweetness in the desert air, unassertive, undemanding, 

always anxious to retreat into himself. Even today I cannot think of him without 

a feeling of profound sadness. 

In 1943, when I was in Class V B at St Xavier?s, my 

father appointed Ronald Louis Montebello as my mathematics tutor. Arithmetic and 

geometry were proving to be bugbears and my discomfiture was at its height. Mr 

Montebello was like a patient and kind friend rather than a forbidding taskmaster. 

He took my brother and myself to the Globe for a Laurel and Hardy film where he 

laughed more than we did. 

He often talked about the failings of the Anglo-Indian 

community. But the Anglo-Indian girls, he felt, were models of efficiency in their 

workplaces and they alone kept the home fires burning and made their homes a comfortable 

nest for all the members of the family. In his own way he was a remarkable teacher 

who tried to understand the psyche of his wards and treat them with respect. 

As the fading light gathers force all around me and 

the brooding tints of an autumn sunset induce a sense of melancholy, the people 

I have talked about here seem determined to travel with me as if I would need 

their presence on the last lap. 

IN MEMORIAM

Amina Halim, daughter of our Speaker Hashim Abdul 

Halim, died on October 19 after fighting a valiant battle against cancer for six 

years. She was only 45 with promises to keep and miles to go before she slept. 

Her zest for life was phenomenal even when cancer 

was creeping up on her. She was looking for escape routes to reassert her sense 

of normality. Once she went all the way to Cairo to look at the antiquities. Later 

on, she went to Sri Lanka for a breather. 

She made efforts to expand her mental vistas. When 

she talked about Pericles or the Greek myths or Renaissance art or plays by Ibsen, 

she displayed a rare erudition. She loved coming to tea at our place and would 

gorge herself on my wifes sandwiches. She was a gourmet and loved sampling 

different types of cuisine on her travels not one to head for MacDonalds.

She was doing very well as a lawyer. A promising career 

was cut short by this devastating illness.

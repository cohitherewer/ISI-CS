 Civic body given booster station charge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will hand over the responsibility of running the booster pumping stations at Behala, Garfa and Bansdroni to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). This was decided at a meeting between the state government and civic authorities last week.

 ?All water reservoirs of the CMDA will be handed over to the CMC. We will only generate the supply; the CMC will take care of the distribution,? said municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya after the meeting with mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

 ?The CMDA cannot carry out regular maintenance work. Besides, the CMC collects tax for rendering civic services. Hence, the responsibility of running the booster pumping stations has been entrusted to the civic body,? the minister explained.

 The CMC will have to clear all of its dues to his department, Bhattacharya asserted. According to him, the civic body owes the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA) Rs 34 crore for generation of water from Garden Reach.

 ?We are short of funds for clearing electricity bills and buying water-purifying chemicals. The CMC has sought more time to pay the dues,? the minister said.

 Keeping in view the ?adverse comments? from the accountant-general?s office, the CMWSA has signed a deed of agreement with all municipalities to which it supplies water regarding timely clearance of dues. According to Bhattacharya, 10 civic bodies, including the CMC, owe the CMWSA Rs 458 crore for water supply. 

 The CMC will also take over maintenance of streetlights on the EM Bypass and in some areas of south Calcutta, including Southern Avenue. The responsibility of the maintenance of streetlights is currently with the CMDA. The advertisement kiosks on these roads will also be taken over by the civic body. 

 Mayor Mukherjee has announced that the Kasba water reservoir and the park built over it will be thrown open by December-end. Entry to the park will be free, he said.

 Announcing plans for a new reservoir at Garden Reach, the mayor said he had already inspected the site. ?The CMDA chief executive officer and the municipal commissioner will visit the site soon. The reservoir will have a capacity of seven million gallons,? Mukherjee said. While the CMDA will provide the land and carry out the construction, the CMC will take care of water distribution. 

 The civic body will soon start laying underground sewerlines at Chingrihata under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Scheme funded by the Asian Development Bank.

 In the first phase, Rs 2 crore will be spent to lay the lines. The Rs 1,245-crore scheme was originally meant for six wards in north Calcutta and 41 wards in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur.

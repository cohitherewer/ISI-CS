 The state government will soon form a technical committee to advise it on which form of rapid mode of transport is best suited for the city. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, at the inauguration of the Lake Gardens flyover on Thursday, said the process of inviting global tenders for the project had been completed and the government is in the next step towards introducing a speedy form of transport in the city.

 ?This mode of transport will be both for passengers and cargo. The transport system in the city is miserable now. We have to work out something so that we can move out of the dangers of the present transport system? There used to be massive traffic jams in Bangkok. If Bangkok and Jakarta can do it, why can?t we?? the chief minister asked. 

 Bhattacharjee said the Lake Gardens flyover was a way of infusing more and more speed into the city?s traffic movement. ?We need more flyovers in the city and more speed? If we fail to increase the speed, then we cannot keep pace with the times,? he added. It should require just 20 minutes to reach Writers? Building from Dum Dum airport, he said. 

 Amidst all the urbanisation plans, Bhattacharjee also highlighted on the importance of greenery in the city. ?Let the greenery not be destroyed. Rabindra Sarobar needs to be developed well. Then there is the Maidan, Subhas Sarobar? We will not allow any filling of the wetlands along the EM Bypass. I have told police to arrest all those involved in landfill.? 

 The chief minister mentioned he had written to Union railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, urging that the Centre contribute 75 per cent, or at least half, the cost of constructing overbridges in the state. ?Take the case of Lake Gardens? the contribution of the railways in today?s project is far less than the CMDA or public works (roads) department.? 

 According to the chief minister, the CMDA and and the PWD (roads) spent Rs 15 crore and Rs 6.59 crore for the Lake Gardens flyover, while the railways contributed Rs 3.27 crore ? 12 per cent of the total cost. 

 The 1,256 m flyover, connecting Rabindra Sarobar with Prince Anwar Shah Road, cost Rs 28.75 crore and took nine years to be completed.

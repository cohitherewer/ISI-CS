The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without...

Asserting your cricket rights

Putting in a call to your cable operator to revive ESPN STAR Sports before you 

miss just about every landmark in the world of cricket. Sachin?s ton on Saturday 

was the last straw. If you come under Indian Cable Net or Manthan, stew in silence 

or take a stance against being held to beam ransom at the drop of a cable connection. 

Viewer?s voice, what?

Having wine with cheese

The holiday spirit brings with it flowing spirits (of the bottled kind) and great 

grub. So dig into the season?s party flavour with a wine-and-cheese bash of your 

own. La Cucina at the Hyatt is having a do on December 14, while Grain of Salt 

lays the table for a wine-and-cheese festival the day after.

Eyeing The Incredibles

The latest animated flick to turn the city loony tunes is The Incredibles, 

releasing at a theatre near you on Friday. For once, the Hindi version might be 

worth a watch and listen, with Shah Rukh Khan (no less), voicing one of the lead 

roles. Or stick to Samuel L. Jackson and Holly Hunter in the English version of 

the must-watch flick that is a parody of superheroes.

Gift shopping

Chances are, you had more than a couple of wedding gifts to shop for this month. 

But if your will and your wallet still permit, it is time to buy a few Christmas 

baubles for those closest to you. Perhaps it will behove your bank balance to 

invest your time in gifts high in creative value and low on cost. Why not bake 

a batch of cookies or try your hand at some scrumptious home-made wine?

 Embroidered fantasy

 Rich in imagery and symbolism, the folk art of Bengal has inspired detailed study among scholars over the ages. The ongoing exhibition of kantha embroideries of Bengal, Artistic Stitchworks, marks Biswajit Mukhopadhyays efforts to understand and unravel the mystery and magic deeply rooted in this art form. Having studied the arts of the tribal groups of Bengal and Bihar, his embroidery represents a synthesis of their creative designs, at the same time improvising on them and evolving a distinctive style and pattern that is his own. Each of his works is a pictorial narrative interweaving various themes and motifs in a spectacular combination of colours and textures that is bound to captivate the viewers? attention. Mukhopadhyays art, with its intricately stitched, unconventional, semi-abstract forms, provides not just viewing pleasure but helps enrich the art heritage of Bengal and to revive a traditional form.

 Event: Exhibition of kantha embroideries of Bengal

 When: Till November 19; 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Academy of Fine Arts, Central Gallery

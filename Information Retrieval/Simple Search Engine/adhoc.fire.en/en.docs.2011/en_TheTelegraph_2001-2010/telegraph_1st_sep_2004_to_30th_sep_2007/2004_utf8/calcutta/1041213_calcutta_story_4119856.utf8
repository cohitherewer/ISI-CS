The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 German fair date for tech units

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Having underlined the employment-generating potential of Hannover for Calcutta?s ?talented management brains? last year, the German fair authorities have turned their gaze on small and medium-sized engineering units in the city and its adjoining areas for Hannover Fair 2005.

 ?India is gaining importance in world trade, especially in the engineering sector. Our fair holds out unique opportunities for Calcutta?s very strong medium-sized engineering sector, particularly from the sub-contracting division,? said Wolfgang Pech, managing director, Hannover Fair.

 Pech was in town recently, speaking at a presentation organised by the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce (IGCC) jointly with the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) on next year?s fair. The meet was organised to promote participation in Hannover and its sister expo at Shanghai (November, 2005) by engineering industries from the eastern region.

 Expressing satisfaction over the recent increase in the number of Indian engineering firms participating in international trade fairs, particularly in Hannover, Pech also stressed the need to look at China ?as partner rather than competitor?. He said it was important for Calcutta and the eastern region to use China as the ?gateway to increase the share of business in the East?.

 B.G. Roy, regional director, IGCC Calcutta, said a joint delegation with EEPC would be sent to the Shanghai expo next year. ?We have taken up dedicated space of 1,000 sq m for the purpose, so that all the exhibitors from India can be housed under one roof,? Roy said. The number of firms participating in Hannover from India was 83 in 2004 and is expected to exceed 100 in the next edition.

 Pointing out that China had started with a roster of 100 a decade ago and has catapulted to 1,100-plus exhibitors in Hannover, Pech said the Indian industry should take heart from and a leaf out of China?s belligerence. With Russia being the partner country at Hannover 2005, he predicted great business potential for Indian companies in general and those from Bengal in particular, in view of ?the excellent political ties with Russia?.

 EEPC chairman Rakesh Sharma emphasised the need to participate in Hannover to ?increase exports of engineering goods to Europe and other parts of the world?.

 German consul-general in Calcutta Erhard Zander promised support to engineering companies in the state willing to take part in the German expo, now regarded as the world?s ?number one event for technology, innovation and automation?.

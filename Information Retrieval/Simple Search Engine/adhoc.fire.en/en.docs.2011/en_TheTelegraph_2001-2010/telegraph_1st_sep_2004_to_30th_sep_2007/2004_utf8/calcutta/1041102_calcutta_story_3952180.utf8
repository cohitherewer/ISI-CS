The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Road blocks after twin mishaps

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two road accidents in north Calcutta, in which an unidentified middle-aged man was killed and a teenager seriously injured, sparked off protests on Monday morning. Local residents blocked roads at both places and jostled with police.

 The first accident took place on CR Avenue, in front of Girish Park Metro station, around 9.50 am. 

 ?The man was crossing the road when the bus knocked him down. He slumped to the ground, bleeding profusely from the head. 

 ?The driver of the bus managed to flee with the vehicle,? said a police officer. ?The man probably ignored the traffic signal, resulting in the accident,? he added.

 Some local residents took the injured man to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he underwent surgery. But he succumbed to his injuries after an hour-and-a-half.

 Protesting police apathy in enforcing traffic discipline, local residents put up a roadblock. 

 They alleged that the accident was caused by reckless driving. The situation worsened when police tried to remove the blockade. 

 The demonstrators refused to back out and were engaged in a scuffle with the policemen. The road could be cleared only after senior police officers assured the protesters that the killer driver would soon be arrested.

 In the other accident, 17-year-old Surojit Saha was knocked down by a private bus on route 214A on Maniktala Main Road, near Bagmari, around 8.30 am.

 He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical.

 Here too, local residents blamed the mishap on reckless driving and put up a roadblock. They demanded round-the-clock vigil by a traffic sergeant and deployment of an adequate number of traffic constables.

 Cops from Maniktala police station had to resort to a mild lathicharge after the protesters turned down their plea to withdraw the blockade. Vehicles started plying normally along Maniktala Main Road from around 9 am.

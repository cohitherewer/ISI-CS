The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

All smiles, flying high

If your work station is up in the clouds, 

the rules of the game are very different from more grounded occupations, finds 

Zeeshan Jawed

Office life may have changed dramatically over the 

past few decades, but few employees of few companies get the chance to defy gravity 

on a daily basis. With space travel still a ways off, airline staff are still 

the closest to touching the heavens.

The rules of the game (at least domestically) have 

been transformed, thanks to a growing number of players competing for air space. 

Carriers like Kingfisher are taking the glamour route to sell seats, appointing 

the likes of Katrina Kaif as the face of the brand.

But there is a flip side to this exotic job: stress 

and exacting standards. Flying high may seem glamorous from the outside, but industry 

insiders will attest to just how demanding this most difficult form of hospitality 

really is.

Cabin scurry

A flight-crew attendant is always on duty, whether 

in the air or not. ?Most people think that cabin crew get a break every two days. 

But we have to work even when we are not flying,? says Reshmi Dogra, an airhostess 

with Lufthansa.

When grounded, attendants have to prepare for the 

next flight they are assigned to. Stock of supplies and first-aid options on board 

have to be taken care of, leaving little leisure time. But once passengers board 

the flight and the aircraft taxis down the tarmac, there is little time to breathe.

One is expected to welcome the passengers with a warm 

and gracious smile and help them settle down in their seats, luggage securely 

locked away. A careful eye has to be kept on passengers who might require extra 

assistance, like the physically challenged or minors. First-timers have to be 

instructed on how to make use of the airflow system and seat belts.

Then it is on to the monotonous yet vital safety drill, 

detailing where the emergency doors of the aircraft are, how to use oxygen masks 

and safety belts. After take-off, she or he has to navigate narrow aisles with 

trolleys laden with goodies, food and drink, candy and coffee, snacks and tea. 

On a calm flight, this might be considered a standard 

task. But when confronted with air-turbulence, the job gets that much harder. 

But the most important quality to have is patience. ?Some difficult passengers 

will keep bombarding us with queries. Even when we are not on duty, we have to 

think of ways to improve customer care,? adds Reshmi.

 The job may seem glamourous, but there is much 

more to being a cabin crew than just a pleasant smile 

The up side

For travel buffs, this is the perfect way to travel 

the globe, though it hardly leaves you time for much sight-seeing. There are other 

perks that come with the job, including interacting with some of the most important 

people around ? from celebrities to everyday, interesting people.

That aside, airlines compensate well for the hardship 

and time spent away from home, in the form of high salaries, perks and allowances.

Hazard high

Banish the thought that this is an easy profession 

that only requires a pleasant smile. Nothing could be further from the truth, 

warn professionals. You could be out at least four to six days a week for 12 or 

14 hours at a stretch, depending on whether it is an international or domestic 

carrier. Flight cancellations and delays make matter worse. 

And don?t forget the inherent risks. Accidents may 

not be common, but they occur. Crew also have to be prepared ? mentally at least 

? for terrorist activity, hijacking attempts and diseases like SARS. 

Check list

A cheerful disposition and positive attitude are the 

pre-requisites for high fliers. One does not earn any points for general knowledge. 

Performance is measured on how you conduct yourself on board. The job demands 

behavioural best while interacting with passengers. Travellers are usually upper-class 

professionals who are not willing to compromise on service standards. 

Physical attributes are as important. Height, weight 

and eyesight are checked at the entry level. You have to look pleasant and conform 

to certain criteria to match the image of the airline.

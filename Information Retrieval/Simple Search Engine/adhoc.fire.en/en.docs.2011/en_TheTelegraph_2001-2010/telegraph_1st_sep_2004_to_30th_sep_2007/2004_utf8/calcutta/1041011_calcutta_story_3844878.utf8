 Science fest forges ties

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 Devangana Kalita, from Dibrugarh, might have beaten over 10,000 whizkids to win a national science seminar. But in her heart of hearts, she wants to be a journalist. 

 ?Anita Pratap is my idol,? said the 16-year-old, after being declared winner of the National Science Seminar 2004 on Science Awareness: Needs and Prospects, organised by the National Council of Science Museums.

 The final round, among a candidate each from 33 states and Union Territories, was held at Science City earlier last week. The National Science Seminar this year had over 10,000 contestants, between Classes VI and X. 

 According to Jayanta Sthanapati, director of the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, Devangana?s achievement was no mean feat. 

 ?A seminar was held in every district of every state and Union Territory. Two students were selected from each to compete at the state-level contest. The winners, from each state except Jharkhand and Lakshadweep, competed for the national final,? he added. 

 Flush with the excitement of having emerged on top, with a shining trophy and a Rs 1,000 scholarship per month for the next two years, Devangana outlined her path to success. 

 ?We had a pretty tough inter-school competition in the district, then at the state level and now here. But the biggest gain in Calcutta has been the amazing friends I am making from all over the country.?

 Shougaijam Dibyalaxmi Devi (Manipur) and Duyu Kampu (Arunachal Pradesh), too, were happy that they had been able to visit Calcutta. ?Frankly, I don?t like science much. I prefer literature and music,? said Dibyalaxmi, adjusting her costume for a Manipuri dance she was to perform at the valedictory ceremony. 

 ?This has been real fun. All of us living together, like in a hostel? sharing ideas and forging bonds,? gushed an excited Kampu. 

 The participant from Jammu and Kashmir, Mohsin Raj Mantoo, was the youngest at the final. Bit by the shyness bug, he sat huddled in a corner of the auditorium with his father. Getting ready to sing a Kashmiri song, he said: ?I am not upset that I have not won a prize. The opportunity to travel to Calcutta was unique.? 

 The contestant from Bengal was Abhishek Dey, of Ramakrishna Mission, Purulia. He was sad he had not been ?able to figure in the top 10, though thrice in the past five years, students from our school had been able to win a place?.

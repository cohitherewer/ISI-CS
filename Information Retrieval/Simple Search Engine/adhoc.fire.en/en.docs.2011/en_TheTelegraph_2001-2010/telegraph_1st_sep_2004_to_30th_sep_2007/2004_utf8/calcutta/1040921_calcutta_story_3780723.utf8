 Dance drama, strings attached

 After creating ripples with the sound of music, sitar daughter Anoushka Shankar is all set to make her acting debut in Pamela Rooks? Dance Like A Man. Here, she replies to questions e-mailed to her by Pratim D. Gupta.

 Q: Your foray into cinema took many of us by surprise. Were you always interested in acting?

 A: As long as I can remember, I was always interested in acting, though as a child I was drawn more to the theatre than the thought of films. Basically, I love the stage ? it?s so much more tactile and romantic. I acted in several plays through my school years and had a habit of spending hours in front of the mirror acting out all sorts of life experiences. Sometimes I would play several people at a time and even make myself cry when that was needed.

 Q: In hindsight, would you have rather picked a bigger venture as your debut vehicle?

 A: Actually, I deliberately stayed away from big-budget, highly commercial ventures for my debut. There were a couple of offers for starring roles in Hindi films but it seemed too big a step to begin with. Not being an actress, I wanted to test the waters in a smaller environment and see whether I enjoyed it before taking on something bigger.

 Q: What prompted you to sign Pamela Rooks? Dance Like A Man?

 A: The story appealed to me. There aren?t many films made in India nowadays that deal with our classical arts and I loved the idea of being part of one. Also, I was excited by the prospect of a double challenge ? acting for the first time and also having to train in Bharatanatyam! Finally, I had met Shobana a few years ago, and am good friends with Pamela?s son. Working with them appealed to me.

 Q: How did you train for the role of a dancer?

 A: For two months prior to shooting the film, I trained daily with Delhi-based dancer Rama Vaidhyanathan, who also choreographed my dance items. I even took a few lessons with Ramaa Bharadwaj in Los Angeles before coming to India. It definitely helped that I had danced as a child because at least the most basic concepts of the dance style didn?t have to be explained. But it had been 10 years since I danced ? so it was still very difficult.

 Q: How was it to face the cameras for the first time?

 A: It was surprisingly comfortable. We did a really simple scene in which I had to carry a tray of tea into a room and say a few words. My biggest worry was keeping my accent correct and balancing the tray! It was sweet, because everyone clapped at the end of the scene, and that made me feel really welcome. Being a stage performer? I didn?t have to waste energy being nervous or self-conscious and could just focus on what needed to be done.

 Q: What are the kind of films you love watching and would like to be a part of?

 A: My taste in films encompasses a pretty wide range of genres. I love strong, gritty dramas, but a certain feminine side of me loves a good teary romance now and then. Some of the raunchy or pseudo-stupid American comedies can be fantastic when they?re made cleverly enough. And I love old black-and-white films from both India and abroad. If I had the option I would love to act in a strong, emotionally charged movie in a character that demands a lot of me with a wide range of emotions and experiences.

 Q: Would you also be interested in regional Indian cinema, perhaps a Bengali film?

 A: Absolutely. Bengali films for example, tend to have more scope for unusual, interesting storylines and strong acting than most Hindi films. However, I would definitely need to work on the language before taking on a film in anything other than English because I?m far from fluent!

 Q: Your father (Pandit Ravi Shankar) had given the background scores for classics like Pather Panchali and Gandhi. Would you like to take up similar film assignments?

 A: Actually I just did the music for a beautiful short film called Ancient Marks. It?s a collection of moving images based on photographs by Canadian Chris Rainier, a world-renowned photographer with the National Geographic? I would, of course, love to score music for other films in the future.

 Q: Will you now juggle film and music careers?

 A: At the time of taking on the first film, I obviously didn?t have a clue whether it would be just once or more than that. But simply put, I enjoyed the process and liked acting. So over the years I would love to do films if the opportunities come my way? I happen to be a musician with many other interests. If I can manage to stay abreast of my music, and continue to grow and explore in other aspects of myself as well, then I will be happy.

 Q: What happens next?

 A: At the moment, I?m on a year?s sabbatical from touring. I?m working on my new album through the rest of the year and go back on tour next year. I?m looking at a couple of scripts, including an interesting one set in Tibet? I really hope to be able to structure the next couple of years so that I can do more.

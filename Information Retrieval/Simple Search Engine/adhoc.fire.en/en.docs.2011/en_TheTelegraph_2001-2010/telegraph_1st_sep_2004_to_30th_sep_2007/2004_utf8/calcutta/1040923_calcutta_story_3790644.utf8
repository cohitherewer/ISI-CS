 Late fee rap for Memorial

 - Court brushes aside Hall loss excuse, admits fresh affidavit

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday allowed petitioner Subhas Dutta to file an affidavit on the proposed construction of an art gallery and auditorium on the Victoria Memorial Hall premises.

 Dutta, during hearing of the case on pollution around the Memorial complex, drew the court?s attention to the Calcutta Tercentenary Trust?s move to construct the gallery and auditorium. ?Though the news is out in the media, the (Memorial) authorities are keeping the court in the dark about it,? Dutta submitted.

 A division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Tapan Dutta observed that the court could not act on media reports. On the petitioner?s plea, the bench granted him permission to file an affidavit on the matter.

 The bench came down on the Memorial authorities for the delay in introducing entry fees for visitors wanting to take a stroll through the lush green of the complex. Expressing displeasure over the way the issue is being handled, the bench asked: ?Why, then, did the authorities not come to the court with specific suggestions on the entry fee??

 Earlier, submitting an affidavit, counsel for the Memorial authorities Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya stated that his clients would face problems if the two-tier entry fee (Rs 2 for morning walkers and Rs 5 for general visitors), as ordered by the court, was sought to be implemented. ?Memorial employees will face public ire if the two-tier structure is implemented,? he added.

 Bhattacharya also submitted that the income from the entry fee would not be enough to cover the cost of running the system. ?At least six employees will have to be appointed to collect the fees,? he argued.

 Rejecting the explanation, the bench observed: ?The argument is imaginary, not based on logic. The expert committee?s report had stated that the authorities would earn Rs 1.5 lakh more per month, once the fees are introduced. How could the authorities say that they will face a loss??

 Justice Ganguly, senior judge of the bench, asked all parties, including the government and the pollution control board, to file affidavits and express their views on the Memorial authorities? stand. 

 The matter will come up for hearing again on November 11. 

 The bench, on the basis of a public interest litigation, had constituted an expert committee to find out ways to save the century-old monument from air pollution.

Arunabha Guha: We often find unscrupulous persons roaming outside the court premises and harassing the public. How can this be stopped? 

 Generally, these touts target illiterate people who come to court seeking justice. In the judicial process, the minimum basic requirement is a person who will complain against another person. There will be two lawyers and the judge. That apart, there is no other process to get a verdict from the judiciary. One has to keep in mind that the judiciary speaks in terms of a legal code, which common people do not understand.

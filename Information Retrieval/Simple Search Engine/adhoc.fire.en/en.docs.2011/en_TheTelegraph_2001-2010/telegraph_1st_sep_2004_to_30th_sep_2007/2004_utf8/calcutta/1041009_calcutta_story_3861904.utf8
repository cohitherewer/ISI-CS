The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Attuned to the middle note

Eye on Calcutta

 Is music in Bengal on the decline or on an upswing? 

An optimist?s defence with full respect to the naysayers

 Melody-makers: (Top) V. Balsara at his residence; 

Bhoomi on stage 

I once eavesdropped on a conversation between a tear 

rolling down a cheek and a bead of sweat on the same face. ?It just cannot be 

done!? said the tear. ?That?s what my salt tells me!? ?Of course, it can be done,? 

said the bead of sweat. ?That?s what my salt tells me!? 

From that day on I learnt two things: one,that even 

eavesdropping had its positive side, and two, that life is all about how you look 

at it. It?s all a question of your point of view. Like the fellow who once said, 

while speaking of a relative who was hanged: ?He died during a tightrope performance.? 

Then there was Oscar Wilde who arrived at his club one evening, after the opening 

night of one of his new plays, which was a complete failure. ?Oscar, how did your 

play go tonight?? inquired a friend. ?Oh?, was Oscar?s lofty response, ?the play 

was a great success; it was the audience that was a failure!?

It?s up to you to decide whether you want to complain 

because rose bushes have thorns or rejoice because thorn bushes have roses. Here 

in Calcutta, the centrepoint of points of view, there?s room enough for all points 

of view. Each of us living in it, in a room, with or without a view, has a point 

of view to which others will listen. They may not see it your way or even meet 

you half way, but they will listen. 

Over the last few weeks I heard so many points of 

view, each so different from the other, yet each so convincing, that I was tempted 

to agree with all of them. I listened to points of view of a ?Brahmin-Hindu musician-journalist? 

who embraced Islam, a poet-singer-guitarist-filmmaker who knows the soul of Calcutta 

better than most, a Parsi music legend who has been in tune with the city some 

50 years, a Bangladeshi writer who shoots straight from the lip and a Professor 

of English who may go down in history as Indian theatre?s greatest protector. 

I didn?t agree with all, but I listened, and, because they had a point of view, 

my admiration for them grew.

Let?s start with the Professor. Ananda Lal, a member 

of JU?s star-studded English faculty, has conceived and created a landmark publication 

for OUP, the Oxford Companion to Indian Theatre. At the panel discussion 

launch at The British Council, the theatre guru lamented that in India the study 

of theatre hasn?t got off the blocks, and perhaps, never will. I have a different 

point of view. Young scholars will draw inspiration and information from his latest 

work that encompasses 2000 years of Indian theatre. They will now have a starting 

point. Ananda did not; look what he did! Imagine what they will! 

I was imagining what I would do in an episode of a 

TV programme anchored by the straight-talking newspaper editor Suman Chattopadhyay, 

and featuring the straight-shooting writer Taslima Nasreen and the straight-faced 

Parsi who is as Bengali as anyone of us, V. Balsara. What the ?Pujas? means to 

us, was what we talked about. Of course, we agreed to disagree ? particularly 

Taslima and I ? we just didn?t see eye-to-eye. She wondered why it took a religious 

festival to bring people together in a secular country; I countered that this 

in fact was our greatest strength. 

For years I was the bhashaan secretary of our 

para Puja. Many a Sunday, after ensuring that the immersion went off smoothly, 

I went straight to church from Babu Ghat. It didn?t make me a Hindu or less of 

a Christian. For me, it was social bonding; just as many Hindu friends of mine 

never miss Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. Taslima criticised Durga Puja for being 

a man?s domain and spoke about fellows doing puja and then going home to bash 

their wives.

I countered that with this ? for me and many others, 

Durga puja is, in fact, the time when daddies and dadus take a backseat. 

It?s when we stop to realise the true worth of the women in our lives, specially 

our mothers. She blasted the sheer waste of money in an age when the poor are 

getting poorer. She had a point; so did I. My view was that there should be a 

ceiling on a puja committee?s kharcha, just as there is on the campaign-expenditure 

of a candidate during an election; but no way could we follow her advice of making 

it a non-event, because even the less fortunate forget their troubles and walk 

on air, if only for four days.

Mr Balsara and I differed on a subject that, technically, 

I have no right to argue with him on: music. His take was that there are so many 

artistes and so much music being churned out from, and in, the city, but almost 

none of it is worthwhile. My defense, as a lay listener, was that there is a huge 

variety of music and a massive effort on out there on the part of performers, 

producers, listeners and the media. I witnessed it up-close at Aamar 106.2 FM?s 

pre-puja bash at Nazrul Mancha ? a dozen performers, each with their own distinctive 

style and fan following. If you believe, as I do, that it is for audiences, and 

audiences alone, to decide what is worthwhile, then music in Bengal is on a huge 

upswing. Care for some factual evidence? 

It is estimated that there are about 500 Bangla bands 

in the state, 25 of them in Garia alone! The likes of Bhoomi and Chandrabindoo 

charge upto half a lakh a show and perform up to 250 shows a year; the ladies? 

favourite, Indranil, and his company, Prime Music, is slated to produce 28 albums 

of various artistes this year; scores of aspiring singers, musicians and writers 

are chucking up jobs and getting into this industry. All this must mean that it 

IS worth someone?s while! 

It was certainly worth my while being with Anjan Dutt 

and Kabir Suman, Onek Din Par, as they released their first Bengali album 

(by that name), after many years, and their first together. While in one song, 

Anjan, in his inimitable style, laments that D?gama Saheber pastries and 

cakes have deserted (!) New Market, Suman is at his best as he pays tribute to 

the incredible Begum Rukiya Sakhawat Hossain, who brought light into the dark 

lives of so many girls, with education. At Planet M that evening the two poets 

extraordinaire were of the view that their genre of music and lyrics had few takers 

and today?s performers had little in common with them. 

I respect them both immensely, not merely as singers 

and musicians, but as original thinkers; but I can?t endorse their view. It is 

they, in fact, who have inspired a generation of intelligent, passionate Bengali 

lyricists and singers, who are concerned about the times that they live in and 

have the conviction to belt it out. Many of these new-age guitarmen may not have 

the depth of Kabir Suman and Anjan, and are not as outspoken as Nachiketa, but 

they have the spirit, the will and their fingers on the pulse.

I shall write about this conscience-keeping generation 

of singers and writers in my next column. For the moment, I?ll just say a final 

salaam to two men who are ?their own men?: one, a Paulite from Darjeeling 

who has the elements of east and west so perfectly mixed in him; and the other 

a radio-TV journalist, who says he converted to Islam about the time Graham Staines 

was burnt alive for the ?sin? of dedicating his life for the welfare of leprosy 

sufferers. They are men who will be remembered as social historians of our times, 

and perhaps, a little before theirs!

 Epitome of energy

 Goddess Durga is symbolized as the epitome of positive power and energy in this universe. Represented in the multi-faceted forms of Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali and Chamunda, she is a metaphor for Shakti, or the essential energy that resides in every woman.The ongoing art exhibition Devi, curated by Ratnottama Sengupta and Prabhas Kejriwal, celebrates this spirit of woman power through images of the Goddess iconised as the supreme restorer of good and destroyer of evil. The works on show, which put into perspective the eternal conflict between the dark and the divine, also emphasise the omnipotence of the feminine holy trinity embodied by Durga and her daughters ? that of the universally sought ideals of strength, wisdom and prosperity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Udita Goswami: Heavenly body

 She sinned in Paap but got rave reviews for the effort. And now, Udita Goswami is all ready to set the small screen on fire as the Channel [V] Goddess. The green-eyed beauty of the ramp made her foray into cinema with Pooja Bhatt?s directorial debut. While the film didn?t work at the turnstiles, the electric chemistry between Udita and the male lead, John Abraham, was definitely the talk of tinsel town.

 While Udita continues to walk the ramp, movies is not happening at the moment. But with her drop dead looks and that killer smile, it?s only a matter of time before Udita faces the arclights again. 

 Even as she takes a break from the big screen, you can definitely track her moves on the telly as she careens around your drawing rooms (and bedrooms), thanks to Channel [V].

 If you missed her getting up close and personal on the music channel, don?t sweat, as she graces every show from [V] Hotline to [V] Crush.

The Simpsons: We can scare you, too

 It?s a harrowing Halloween Sunday this October 31. At least for couch potatoes. Some channels have taken on the self-appointed task of scaring viewers silly on the night of the dead, when the witches and devils come out to play. 

 First up is a Simpsons extravaganza on Star World. For most Bart and Homer fans, that might seem more amusing than frightening, but beware. There are a few episodes that can really scare you. Star World promises a ?spooktacular? night? 

 Tune in at 1.20 pm and watch on till 7 pm (with a break of an hour?s Baywatch in between). 

 Following that is the real treat ? Ghosts, Best Evidence Ever Caught On Tape. Now that?s guaranteed to have even a few sceptics running for cover ? and the light switch. Check out the reality programme of people catching ghosts on video. 

 AXN has something truly scary lined up on Halloween night. Kingdom Hospital is no ordinary hospital. Built on a site where two previous fires destroyed many young lives, the current inmates and doctors have to deal with the supernatural forces of sad souls roaming its corridors. 

 The film about paranormal activity and the fight between good and evil will be screened at 8 pm. 

 Or you could try catching The Exorcist: The Beginning on the big screen. 

 Either way, when the kids come knocking for ?trick or treat?, you?ll be more likely to lock your door than open it with a smile and a box of candy in hand?

Timothy Daly: Fugitive

 Vintage action is reaching viewers in a new exciting package. Zee English has launched The Fugitive, which has had successful previous incarnations on both big and small screens.

Dr Richard Kimble is accused of murdering his wife. 

On his way to prison, the train he is riding in crashes. He becomes the fugitive, 

an innocent man running from the law. Trying to avoid being captured by Lt Gerard, 

hot on his heels, he is also on the hunt for a one-armed man who actually committed 

the crime, whose capture would allow him to prove his nnocence. 

 This story first reached viewers on September 17, 1963, when The Fugitive was introduced on ABC network in the US. David Janssen starred as Dr Richard Kimble, a character based on the real life story of Sam Sheppard. Barry Morse, who played Lt Gerard, soon became known as ?the most hated man in America?. The show was nominated for a Golden Globe award in 1967 for Best TV Show.

 Thirty years later, the story hit the big screen with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in the two main roles. Soon after, Mahesh Bhatt (trust him) gave us a Hindi version Criminal starring Nagarjuna and Manisha Koirala. 

 It?s time for viewers here to catch up on the latest edition that updates the classic 1960?s action series with the thrills and high-tech style of the 1990?s Oscar-nominated blockbuster. The CBS offering has Timothy Daly, star of the hit show Wings, in the lead. Mykelti Williamson, ?Bubba? Bufford-Blue in Forrest Gump, plays Lt Gerard. A unique thing about Williamson is that he is the first African-American to play this role that has usually been cast as a white male.

 ?We have received tremendous success with shows like Witch Blade and The Sopranos. The same enthusiasm is expected for The Fugitive,? says Ajay Trigunayat, business head, Zee English. Beam time is Wednesday, 8 pm.

 His age may not be the best thing about him but there?s little doubt that Anil Kapoor is still going very strong. And with his look in the new Sanjay Gupta film Musafir being talked about, he is definitely back in the reckoning after a brief hiatus.

 Now you too can enter into the mindscape of Anil as he makes a rare appearance this week on STAR News? Masand Ki Pasand. Talking at length about the film, the veteran actor explains why he?s still getting leading roles in an industry inundated with young blood every Friday. 

 In the candid conversation with Rajeev Masand, the actor confesses that he wants to die with greasepaint on. He also talks about the risks he has taken in his long movie career and the results of those risks.

 So catch Anil on Masand Ki Pasand on Star News, Saturday at 8.30 pm and the repeat on Sunday at 10.30 am.

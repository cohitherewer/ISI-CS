The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Quiet code for efficiency

 - Motivation equals sustained competitive edge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From inadequate communication skills and stage fright to an endemic inertia and inflexibility in attitude ? the human-element roadblocks for business organisations are numerous. And more and more small and medium-sized enterprises in Calcutta, the backbone of the city?s industrial fabric, are realising it pays to pay heed to these issues to grow successfully.

 Lackadaisical attitudes, suspicion of management, militant unionism ? the stigmas had stuck with Calcutta?s work culture. Labels employers and employees alike are now keen to get rid of, and HR help in training and consultancy is fast gaining currency.

 As the city?s mid-segment groups strive to derive competitive advantage through differentiation, rather than mass customisation, the focus has shifted to development of soft skills among staff. ?This competitive advantage must be converted into sustained competitive advantage, since the deadlines now are always yesterday, never tomorrow,? says Ajay Agarwal, the quiet motivator working towards changing outlooks and perceptions in corporate houses and individuals.

 Agarwal, whose ?strength areas? are strategy to success, management topics, positive attitudes, team-building, leadership, communication skills, organisational and human behaviour, feels Calcutta employers had been ?more rigid? in their response to HR needs, compared with counterparts in Mumbai or Bangalore in the past.

 ?But, all that is changing. From price-takers, the consumers have become price-makers and hence, improving efficiency is no more a matter of choice, it?s basic hygiene,? points out Agarwal.

 His clients include organisations like the Indian Institute of Port Management, National Thermal Power Corporation, IBP, Power Grid Corporation, State Productivity Council, the defence ministry, Lions and Rotary clubs and Hindusthan Club.

 Once an organisation approaches the motivation guru, he first conducts a diagnostic study and then submits a report, which is ?fiercely debated? by all the stakeholders.

 Agarwal, who feels training needs must be identified at a micro level, prescribes a four-pronged formula for efficiency ? ?build commitment, competencies and culture and put systems at work?. Soft skills and attitudinal training can become the motherboard for true acceptance of on-job training, which otherwise often ?dilutes into a picnic?, he points out.

 Not just corporate houses, but individual entrepreneurs, students and even home-makers are queuing up for the motivation classes and seminars aimed at improving self-confidence, communications skills and quality of life.

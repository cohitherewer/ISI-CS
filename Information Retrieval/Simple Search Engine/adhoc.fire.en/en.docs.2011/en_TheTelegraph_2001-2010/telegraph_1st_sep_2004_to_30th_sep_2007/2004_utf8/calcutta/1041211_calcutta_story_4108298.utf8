 A generous sprinkling of shine and shimmer is how this seven-month-old boutique is hoping to sizzle your party season. Offering a predominantly fusion line, Viva on 19 Mahanirban Road (off Rashbehari Avenue, opposite Triangular Park) packs in a wide range of Indo-western pant suits, salwar suits, skirts, ponchos, kurtis, halters, spaghettis, bustiers and cropped shirts with cap sleeves.

 The colour palette is vibrant with a splash of orange, pink and cobalt blue. ?Colours are in this season and there is no place for muted shades,? said co-owner and designer Ratna Dutt. Embellishments include heavy embroidery, sequins and beads with a touch of gold and silver.

 Ponchos, which are a rage this season, come in interesting prints as well as light embroidery. 

 These can be teamed with embroidered long skirts in soft crushed silks and georgettes for evening wear and light cottons for day wear. 

 The marriage mart hasn?t been given a miss either. A range of heavy crepe salwar suits have been designed for this purpose. ?These are very versatile and can be worn for the main ceremonies as well as the various side-shows in a wedding,? said partner Priyanka Chandhok. 

 In case you want to take a break from endless partying, there?s also a range of ethnic cotton salwar suits. A touch of embroidery, sequins and beads in this line makes sure you are never too far from celebrating the mellow season.

 Bauble boom

 With Christmas and New Year knocking at your door, it?s time you did a wardrobe check. After all, the last minute scramble to buy that ideal neckpiece to match your evening gown is best avoided in favour of well-planned ensembles for festive nights. Gurls, a boutique that deals exclusively in party wear, is worth keeping on your list of stops this season. 

 This one-year-old boutique in Alipore Apartments at 30-B Judges Court Road, offers a host of fashion accessories and party wear, made from materials imported from Korea. ?My collection includes funky accessories, party tops and long skirts targeted at teenage girls,? says owner Jasbeer Bala.

 There are hair accessories like extensions, pins, clips and bands. The motifs are mostly floral with lots of semi-precious stones and crystals as embellishment. Earrings, neckpieces, rings, toe-rings, bracelets and bangles made of metal and stones of various hues can be paired with western party wear perfectly. The accessories start as low as Rs 40 and climb to Rs 450.

 There are pretty party tops in pastel shades with floral prints and sequin work. The halter necks and tube tops are the high point of this collection. The tops can be teamed with the crushed cotton skirts on offer. While the skirts are priced between Rs 250 and Rs 350, the tops go up to Rs 550.

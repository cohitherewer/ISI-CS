 Buddha: Let?s play host

 With the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) bringing its biggest business meet to town, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is moving into top gear to spruce up and sell well. Between January 12 and 14, Calcutta will host CII Partnership Summit 2005. Besides tying up for the high-profile business event, barely a month after Infocom 2004, the Bhattacharjee government is ready to use the occasion to showcase the best of Bengal, from revamped roads to non-stop meetings.

 ?This is a truly international event and we want to get the maximum out of it,? Sabyasachi Sen, state industries and commerce secretary, told Metro on Wednesday. With confirmations from a clutch of CEOs and delegations from the US, UK, Oman and Singapore, the chief minister is ready to play perfect host to over 800 visitors, both global and local.

 ?The Partnership Summit started in Calcutta in 1995 with then Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as chief guest. Two years later, British Prime Minister John Major came here, but then the meet moved out of the city. We are happy to hold it here after eight years,? said Ravi Poddar, deputy chairman, CII eastern region. According to Poddar, rising interest in the city, among the business community, has brought it back.

 For Sen, convener of the steering committee put in place to make the show a success for Bengal?s business, the task is to spruce up and sell Bengal. The Partnership team is headed by chief secretary Ashok Gupta and CII eastern region chairman B. Muthuraman of Tata Steel.

 From giving a new look to city roads to initiating beautification projects, the committee has drawn up an ?exhaustive? things-to-do list. A ?special venue?, the National Library, has been chosen to host part of the show.

 The sales strategy revolving around the chief minister will find him on the spot all three days, engaging in one-to-one meetings on the sidelines and hosting a dinner for the visiting delegates. ?The objective is to showcase the best of Calcutta and leave a lasting impression in the minds of visiting delegates,? summed up Sen.

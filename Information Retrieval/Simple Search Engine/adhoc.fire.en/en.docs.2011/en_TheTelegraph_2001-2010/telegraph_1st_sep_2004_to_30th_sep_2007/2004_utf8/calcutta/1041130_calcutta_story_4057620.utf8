 Healthcare healing pills 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to counter the exodus of patients, city-based hospitals have embarked upon a drive to improve the image of healthcare in Calcutta, either by performing top-notch surgeries or by introducing new facilities.

 Apollo Gleneagles Hospital is one of the hospitals that has taken the initiative of winning over patients. For a difficult case of hip replacement surgery, the hospital recently flew in special equipment so that its orthopaedic department could attempt the first-ever, minimally-invasive hip replacement surgery. 

 When 49-year-old Gopal Kundu was admitted to the hospital with a history of Perthes? disease, orthopaedic surgeon Buddhadeb Chatterjee knew that it was just the case for hip replacement. 

 Kundu, however, needed to get back to work early.

 ?I had received training for minimally-invasive hip replacement surgery in the US. I wanted to make use of the knowledge, even though the procedure had never been attempted in eastern India,? said Chatterjee.

 Once the equipment arrived from Mumbai, the surgical team, led by Chatterjee, carried out the surgery by making a 10-cm incision, instead of the standard 20 cm.

 ?The pain was minimal and the hospital stay was shortened to three days. Kundu could walk the very next day,? said Chatterjee. 

 In conventional surgeries, two blood pouches are required, but blood transfusion was not needed in this case.

 Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Centre is also doing its bit to salvage the image of healthcare in the city. 

 It has decided to introduce a concept known as diabetic foot clinic. ?Several diabetics develop foot problems, including foot ulcers, which force patients to go in for amputation. Keeping this in mind, we decided to introduce the foot clinic, which will help patients learn more about caring for their legs,? said Rupak Barua, vice-president (administration) at the hospital.

 ?Any patient coming to the foot clinic will be assessed by a multi-disciplinary team,? said Sujoy Majumdar, consultant diabetologist at the hospital. 

 The latest investigative techniques have also made their way to the city. 

 ?With the more pervasive use of non-invasive imaging for evaluation of a variety of non-specific symptom complexes, more than 50 per cent of the renal cell cancer (RCC) cases are detected immediately,? said urologist Amit Ghose. 

 RCC cases are very difficult to detect otherwise.

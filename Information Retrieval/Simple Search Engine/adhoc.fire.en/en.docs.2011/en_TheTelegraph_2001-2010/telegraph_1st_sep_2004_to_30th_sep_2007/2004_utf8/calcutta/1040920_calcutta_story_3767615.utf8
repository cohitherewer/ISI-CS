 Experiments in Indianness

MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

Culinary innovations today could well become a part 

of our tradition a few decades down the line. Chef Abhijit Saha?s new menu for 

Saffron does the spirit of experimentation justice, combining unusual ingredients 

and flavours while upholding its quintessential Indianness.

 The offering at the Indian speciality restaurant at The Park has been ?contemporised? by the Bangalore-based chef. Weeks of tinkering in the kitchen have resulted in a spread that marries age-old techniques with new-age combinations.

 The Mishti Doi Mousse, with caramelised banana and butterscotch sauce, is the perfect case in culinary point. It showcases Bengal?s best with sleight of hand. Mishti doi, explains Saha, is whipped with cream and then refrigerated. ?This gives the lightness of a mousse with the flavour of doi,? he adds.

 Not everything will suit every palate, but the extensive menu includes enough of the purely traditional to keep even purists pleased.

 The Asparagus Khaas is a simple starter that packs in quite a punch. The baked greens come with a spicy cream cheese dip. The Open Samosas come in mushroom or corn and capsicum varieties, with light, crisp crusts. 

 The kebab section holds interesting options. While the Tandoori Bharwan Amrood proves that guavas may be best kept out of the tandoor, the Paneer Sandwich Kebab combines paneer with tangy sun-dried tomatoes. The non-vegetarian options are impressive. The Vilayati Fish Kebab brings delectable salmon to the table, cooked in pesto, as well as bekti in Creole spices and black olive.

 A showman?s take on Daab Chingri appears here. Served in the green coconut shell, flamb?ed at the table with Malibu, it is a novel variation, but it is not so much like the beloved Daab Chingri. But as an experience ? like the rest of the innovations ? it is definitely worth a shot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In respectful remembrance

 With the passing away of noted Rabindrasangeet exponent Roma Mondal last Friday, the city music scene has lost one of its most accomplished and versatile singers. Having trained in Rabindrasangeet under the disciplined tutelage of Suchitra Mitra, Mondal became one of the most popular and successful singers of her generation. A mellifluous voice, coupled with mild manners and a quiet dignity not only won her the admiration of her fans but even the respect of her peers. Organised by Bhavna Records and Cassettes, Shraddharghya pays homage to the departed singer with an evening of Tagore songs by almost all leading city artistes. Renowned singers like Ajoy Chakraborty and Ruma Guhathakurta, among others, who are not strictly Rabindrasangeet practitioners, have also consented to lend their voices in tribute. Veteran cultural icons of the city including Soumitra Chatterjee and Sunil Gangopadhyay share their memories of her musical genius. All are welcome.

 Event: Shraddharghya; a musical tribute to Rabindrasangeet exponent Roma Mondal

 When: Today at 5.30 pm

 Where: Uttam Mancha

 Collision afresh in hit zone

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A private bus rammed into a police outpost in front of Jyoti Basu?s Salt Lake residence, Indira Bhavan, early on Wednesday, injuring a constable.

 This was the third mishap near the former chief minister?s residence over the past six months. Four lives were lost in the earlier two.

 Humayun Kabir, Salt Lake?s sub-divisional police officer, said Wednesday?s accident was caused by reckless driving. ?The driver of the bus lost control while overtaking a taxi and hit the outpost. He managed to flee, but the vehicle has been impounded,? Kabir added.

 The incident took place around 1 am. ?The bus on route 239 was plying down the left flank of the road, heading for EC Island from Karunamoyee,? said an officer, who was on duty at the spot. 

 ?After overtaking the taxi, the driver missed the cut-off point, at which he should have steered the vehicle to the right flank. Instead, he drove straight and rammed into the outpost,? he added.

 The left flank of the road in front of Indira Bhavan is kept blocked for security reasons.

 ?Constable Purna Haldar was admitted to the Bidhannagar sub-divisional hospital with a critical head injury,? the officer added.

 In May, three persons were killed in a collision between a private bus and an autorickshaw on the spot. 

 In August, a four-year-old girl died in a taxi-autorickshaw face-off.

 ?All the mishaps took place when the vehicles were veering towards the right flank at the cut-off point. And rash driving was the cause. Had the driver followed our directions, the mishap could have been averted,? said an officer. 

 ?Something has to be done to ensure that drivers are more careful on that stretch,? he added.

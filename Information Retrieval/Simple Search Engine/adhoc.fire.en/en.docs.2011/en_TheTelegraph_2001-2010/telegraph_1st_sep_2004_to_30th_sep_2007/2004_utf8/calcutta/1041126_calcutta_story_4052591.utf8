 Ewan McGregor: On song

 Baz Luhrmann?s musical Moulin Rouge was proof enough of his singing and dancing skills. And now, Trainspotting star Ewan McGregor is all set to make his West End debut in Guys and Dolls as Sky Masterson.

 The role of a chronic gambler who falls in love with a missionary was made famous on the big screen by Marlon Brando in the 1955 Hollywood blockbuster.

 The West End revival of Frank Loesser?s 1950 musical is being directed by Michael Grandage, artistic director of London?s Donmar Warehouse, and produced by Howard Panter for The Ambassador Theatre Group and David Lan for Clear Channel Entertainment.

 Guys and Dolls opened on Broadway in 1950. When it premieres in June 2005, the show will be the first new London production in 23 years. The production has music and lyrics by Frank Loesser, is designed by Christopher Oram and choreographed by Rob Ashford.

 The musical also marks the 33-year-old Scottish actor?s return to the London stage. McGregor was last spotted in 1999 in Little Malcolm and His Struggle against the Eunuchs at Comedy Theatre. 

 Famous for playing Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars trilogy, McGregor has recently published a book on his 20,000-mile around-the-world motorcycle trip. He is currently filming The Island alongside Scarlett Johansson.

Fancy footwork: Cast members of Dirty Dancing The Classic

instructor while vacationing with her parents. The play premiered at Royal Theatre, 

Sydney, on November 18 and will continue till December 4. (Reuters)

Ushering in the season of chilly evenings, a melange 

of song, dance, poetry and prose captivated the audience at The Saturday Club 

on Wednesday. 

 Falling Leaves: Ode to Winter began with a thumri recital by Kumar Mukherjee, after which actress Sudipa Basu took the podium to read Manik Bandyopadhyay?s Jake Ghoosh Dite Hoy. 

 Next up was Rupanjana, a familiar face on the small screen, who chose a short poem by Nabanita Dev Sen on adolescence.

 Rabindrasangeet singer Suchanda Ghosh enthralled her listeners with a mellifluous rendering of Jani tomar ajana nahi and Shukno pata ke je chhoray.

 Arindam Sil tickled the funny bone with poetry by Nirendranath Chakraborty and Sunil Gangopadhyay. Gopa Ghosh sang a western composition, adding a different note to the soiree.

 Suchita Raychaudhury read out poetry by Jibanananda Das, while Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee, who conceptualised and directed the collage, read excerpts from a Bertolt Brecht piece that explored the relationship between the season and infanticide by an unwed mother. Deboleena Dutta rounded off the evening with a ballet piece to the tune of Enya. Organised by the library committee of The Saturday Club, the show was anchored by Rita Bhimani, who also read a self-composed poem.

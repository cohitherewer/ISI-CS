 Net-a-cat at state hospitals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Cats are back in government hospitals by the hordes, the labour room and gynaecological wards being their most favourite haunts.

 Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee has asked the superintendents of government hospitals to rope in NGOs in their efforts to rid the premises of cats.

 He recalled that two NGOs, People for Animals and Love-N-Care for Animals, had earlier responded positively to the health department?s appeal for help.

 Following the advice, the superintendents of hospitals have sent an SOS to the city-based NGOs. 

 Love-N-Care for Animals launched its ?catch them unhurt? operation on Thursday at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, Beleghata Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital, Vidyasagar Hospital (Behala), Jadavpur and Uttarpara hospitals. 

 The superintendents of SSKM, NRS and RG Kar medical colleges and hospitals have approached People for Animals. 

 ?We had caught 58 cats from the wards of the three medical colleges in the second week of July. All of them have been sterilised and vaccinated on our Ashari campus, in Mukundapur,? said Debasish Chakraborty of People for Animals.

 The unexpected rise in the city?s feline population has caused a steep jump in the expenditure of the organisations that look after the welfare of animals.

 ?It takes Rs 2 lakh a year to feed and nurse the 110 stray cats we have sheltered. The amount will rise several times, now that more cats are coming in from the hospitals,? said Sushmita Roy of Love-N-Care for Animals.

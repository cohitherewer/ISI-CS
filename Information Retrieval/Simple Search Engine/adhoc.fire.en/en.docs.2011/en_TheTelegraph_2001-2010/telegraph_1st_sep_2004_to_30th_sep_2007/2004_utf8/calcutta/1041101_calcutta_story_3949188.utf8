 Family faces tenancy feud fury

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A promoter and his henchmen forced their way into a Salt Lake flat in broad daylight and beat up residents over a tenancy dispute.

 Aditya, a Class XII student, was severely injured and had to be admitted to a local hospital. Head of the family Arun Bajoria, his brother Jeetendra and wife Pushpa also sustained injuries.

 The family had moved into the ground-floor apartment at CE 113 on October 15. Around 11.45 am on Sunday, a group of 30 men, allegedly led by local promoter Shantanu Chakraborty, broke in and attacked the Burrabazar-based cloth merchants.

 ?They dragged my husband and son to the stairs and started beating them up. Jeetendra went to stop them and was also beaten up,? said Pushpa. When she tried to intervene, she too was allegedly beaten with rods.

 ?I rushed out to the street and cried for help,? she explained, adding that son Aditya was beaten with chains and an iron rod before goons rammed nails into his feet.

 The Bajorias claimed the promoter had threatened them earlier, warning them not to move into the flat. They had lodged a police complaint on October 15.

 ?We paid for the apartment and now the promoter wants to forcibly evict us and hand it over to someone else,? said Arun Bajoria. ?A case is on at Sealdah court regarding tenancy rights to the second floor,? he added.

 Chakraborty and six associates were arrested later in the day, said officers of Bidhannagar (north) police station.

 ?If there is a property dispute, it should be solved in court. We have lodged several complaints about the promoter?s illegal activities,? said Sabyasachi Dutta, Trinamul councillor of ward 10.

 According to police, the Narcotics Control Bureau had conducted a raid on Chakraborty?s house.

 Lalbazar laurels for its honest men

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to inspire hard work and honesty in policemen, the state government will organise an annual programme to felicitate them for good service. 

 Responding to a proposal by the city police, the state home department has started holding discussions with senior officers hoping to arrange the programme this year.

 The process of honouring policemen has already started. A committee comprising four additional commissioners of police and a representative of the state home department will be formed to select the winners. The committee will be headed by commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty.

 ?It will definitely encourage our policemen who do not belong to the IPS cadre. We organise the annual prize distribution ceremony for the state police. If everything goes well, we will honour members of Calcutta Police from this year,? said a senior officer at Writers? Buildings.

 The prizes will be in four categories: commitment, bravery, appreciation and service. The divisional deputy commissioner will recommend names to the commissioner. After the selection committee has made its decision, the chief minister himself will approve the final list of winners.

 According to a police officer, medals for commitment will be handed over to those policemen who have performed their duty for the past 25 years without facing any charges or complaints. ?Apart from the medal, a cash prize and a certificate will be awarded,? said the officer.

 Five policemen will be selected in the category of bravery. Apart from the medal, they will be handed over Rs 15,000 and certificates. 

 ?The appreciation medal will be given to all those policemen whose work has been appreciated by every section of our society. Each of them will be handed over a medal, Rs 10,000 and a certificate,? said an officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.

 The medal for service will be given to those who have been working for the past 10 years and maintaining a good track record in their service books. For this category, 25 policemen will be selected and each of them will awarded Rs 5,000 and a certificate.

 According to officials, the service record will play a vital role for being selected. ?If we find anyone who has an adverse record in his service-book, his name will be cancelled,? said an officer.

 The state government will have to spend Rs 4.6 lakh per year on this annual programme. ?We have started working on the city police?s proposal. We are holding meetings with senior officers at the Lalbazar police headquarters and a clear picture will emerge within a week or two,? said a senior officer at Writers? Buildings.

 ?The idea is to encourage policemen to achieve more than they would in the normal course of things,? said an official. ?There is the President?s police medal. This is on similar lines for non-IPS officers.?

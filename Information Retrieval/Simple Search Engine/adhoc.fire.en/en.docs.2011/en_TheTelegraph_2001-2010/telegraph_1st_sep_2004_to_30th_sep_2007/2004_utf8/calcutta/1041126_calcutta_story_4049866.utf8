 Army aye on fence knockdown 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A weeklong stand-off over the Maidan fence eased on Thursday, with the army relenting for the time being and the police heaving a sigh of relief.

 The army decided to remove the fence and allow cars to be parked on the green during the South Africa-India Test, starting Sunday. The facility will also be extended to pilgrims heading for the Ganga Sagar mela a few weeks later.

 The army had ignored repeated pleas by the police to remove the barbed-wire fence on the grounds that the barrier was necessary to protect the greenery, as well as the 7,000 saplings planted recently. 

 Two years ago, 2,000 saplings planted on the Book Fair grounds had been crushed under the feet of visitors.

 The Thursday thaw followed a meeting on Wednesday between the army brass in the city and police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty. Among those present at the meeting was Major-General Z.U. Shah, general officer commanding (Bengal area).

 ?The controversy has been put to rest. We have removed the fence and replaced it with tree guards to protect the saplings,? the major-general announced.

 The army has, however, made it clear that the barriers will be back in place in a few months and that police should start scouting for a proper parking lot.

 ?In future, during cricket matches at Eden Gardens and religious occasions, police will have to park cars elsewhere, not on the Maidan,? asserted an army officer.

 Though short-lived, police are elated with the relief granted by the army. ?During the last India-Pakistan one-dayer, we faced a lot of trouble. We could not provide space for the cars that had yellow stickers on. The army?s decision will definitely help us keep the situation under control during the Test and the Ganga Sagar mela,? said Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Elaborating on the army?s stand, major-general Shah said the forces are keen on saving the green. Keeping this in mind, the army has suggested that the government look for alternative parking areas. 

 ?But the police commissioner seemed helpless, because there is not much space left near the Maidan where so many vehicles can be parked. Still, one must think seriously about this issue,? he added.

 A senior officer at Lalbazar said: ?We have managed to make them (the army) understand our problems.? 

 Earlier, deputy commissioner Mukherjee had sent four letters to the army, requesting it to remove the fence. ?In all the letters, we urged them to reconsider their decision as citizens? interests and religious sentiments are involved,? said the officer.

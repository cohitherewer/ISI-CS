 Rain adds 2-crore load on road bills

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A sudden atmospheric depression and nagging rain for four days have added a Rs 2-crore extra burden on the pre-Puja road repair budget of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 

 According to the civic roads department, over 100,000 potholes have developed across at least 900 km of the city?s roads as their bituminous cover remained soaked for four days at a stretch.

 Bituminous roads, comprising about 90 per cent of the city?s 1,500-km road network, and those with tram tracks have been the worst hit in the last four days of this monsoon. 

 On an average, the civic authorities have to repair 1.5 lakh sq m of city roads annually, but this time, thanks to the incessant rain, the figure has risen to about 3.5 lakh sq m. 

 On Tuesday, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya expressed concern over bad road conditions, and mayor Subrata Mukherjee told him the CMC would take up road repairs on a war footing. 

 At the time, however, mayoral council member (roads) Anup Chatterjee said: ?Since the Pujas are just five weeks away, it will not be possible to repair all the roads by the start of the festive season.? 

 The mayor had urged the minister to take steps to speedily withdraw trams from the city roads, or else arrange for the government to see to the maintenance of the tracks.

 Before the unusually long wet spell, it was estimated that 300 km of road length warranted immediate attention and needed to be repaired before the Pujas. 

 All the required logistics had been kept ready accordingly. The four-day wet spell, fluctuating from a drizzle to pelting rain, has upset all the calculations, Chatterjee added. 

 However, he pointed out, patchwork will be done on all the damaged roads to cover the potholes before the Pujas. 

 According to engineers of the civic roads department, APC Road (near Harisha Market), Bidhan Sarani, Rabindra Sarani, BK Pal Avenue and Beadon Street in the north require immediate repairs.

 A large number of roads in the Behala and Garden Reach areas, too, need attention before the Pujas. 

 CPM councillor and member of Parliament Sudhanshu Sil, formerly mayoral council member (roads), held the Trinamul Congress board in the CMC responsible for the situation. Repairs were suspended for about a month till September 14, as there was no stock of bitumen, he alleged. 

 Roads that require immediate attention include Strand Road, Strand Bank Road, CR Avenue, James Long Sarani, SN Roy Road, Beleghata Main Road, Narkeldanga Main Road, Belgachhia Road, Raja Subodh Mullick Road, BT Road and about a hundred peripheral roads.

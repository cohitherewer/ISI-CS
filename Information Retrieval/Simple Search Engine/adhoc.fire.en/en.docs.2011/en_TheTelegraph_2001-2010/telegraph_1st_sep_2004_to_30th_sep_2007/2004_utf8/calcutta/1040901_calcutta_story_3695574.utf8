 Rights rap for hospital neglect

 KINSUK BASU

 Scramble for admission, lack of beds, indifferent diagnosis and improper treatment. Chances are that a patient and family will fall victim to one or more of these defining features of the state healthcare system.

 Worse still is the endless wait in pain and sorrow that the patients family has to suffer. For, theres none to admit the goof-up. 

 Moved by the patients plight, the state human rights commission has shot off a letter to the director and joint director of health services, detailing two cases of neglect by hospitals. 

 In both, the neglect has resulted in permanent disability and even death. The victims families have written to numerous officials since 2000, but are yet to get a reply.

 A two-member bench, comprising Justice Shyamal Kumar Sen and Amit Sen, has sought to know why the families should not be paid compensation by the state. 

 Meet Madan Mohan Chakrabarty, of 63, Sambhu Halder Lane, in Salkia, Howrah. His 10-year-old son Surajit had been suffering from fever and a splitting headache. A fortnights treatment had failed to improve his condition, forcing Chakrabarty to take him to SSKM Hospital. 

 Doctors at the emergency ward asked Chakrabarty to fetch an injection. An hour after it was pushed into the boys left leg, Surajit felt a pain in the limb. His condition worsened to an extent that Surajit was not able to stand. Chakrabarty kicked up a row, forcing the authorities to call a neurologist, who admitted that the needle had touched a raw nerve. 

 Surajit was released from the hospital after 18 days, with the advice that he drop in at the outdoor department at regular intervals. That was in September 2000. 

 Now, Surajit moves around with a disability certificate (serial no. 15539) issued by the Howrah district hospital. His father has knocked on the rights panels door.

 Meet Suparna Das of Ranaghat. Her 16-day-old daughter was gasping for breath when the local hospital referred the case to Dr BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children. 

 There, Suparna had to fight with mice and ants, and share the small iron bed with another mother and child. 

 She could not bear the ordeal for more than a few days, and decided to shift to a nursing home. 

 But the hospital authorities would not hand over her papers. Result: the baby died. That was in April 2000. 

 The commission has sent repeated reminders, but no one even cares to reply. This is appalling, lamented rights panel chairman Shyamal Kumar Sen. 

 If Suparna and Surajit are not fit cases of human rights violation, then what is? he wondered.

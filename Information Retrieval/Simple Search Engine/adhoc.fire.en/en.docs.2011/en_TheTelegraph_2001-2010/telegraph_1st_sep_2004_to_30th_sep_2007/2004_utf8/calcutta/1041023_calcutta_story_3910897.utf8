 Decibels keep Calcutta awake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Blaring microphones have forced many Calcuttans to close their windows and shut themselves in, while some residents have taken up the issue with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB). Complaints were received from all parts of the city during the first two days of the Pujas.

 A large number of Durga puja committees in the city and the neighbouring areas were guilty of flouting the noise pollution rules on Mahasaptami, as well as Ashtami, by ignoring the decibel limit fixed by the PCB.

 The PCB and local police stations have received an unprecedented number of complaints about blaring microphones from Maniktala, Lake Town, Salt Lake, Titagarh, Tollygunge, Garia, Jadavpur and Tiljala. The culprits invariably were the local clubs and puja committees, who were playing ear-splitting music till the wee hours.

 ?We received complaints from the residents of the Maniktala and Lake Town areas, and, accordingly, instructed our mobile vans to warn the puja organisers concerned that strict action would be taken against them,? said P.K. Barui, officer-in-charge of the PCB control room, Paribesh Bhavan. 

 According to PCB officials, most of the complaints came from the fringe areas during the day. Similar complaints were received from the city at night. 

 ?Once we receive the complaints, we contact our mobile patrol teams near the affected areas and instruct local police stations to look into the matter,? he said.

 On Navami night, the PCB had received three specific complaints from Tiljala, Tollygunge and Gariahat, which the PCB officers were looking into. ?Our teams went and warned them and they stopped playing loud music,? a PCB official claimed. 

 PCB officials found during their rounds that many puja organisers had failed to instal the mandatory sound-control boxes meant to curb noise pollution. The organisers were not even aware of the rule. Police in Lake Town, Behala, Jadavpur, Tiljala, Titagarh, Rajarhat, Maniktala and Salt Lake admitted that people had called up since Tuesday, complaining about blaring microphones.

 For the two hill mynahs and the five grey-headed mynahs, it was an unusual journey to freedom. The birds, along with many others, were rescued from various city markets and kept at Deer Park, a rescue centre of the forest department, in Salt Lake?s AE block. 

 On Monday, 60 such birds were taken to Jalpaiguri by train, to be released later at Jaldapara Wild Life Sanctuary. Besides the hill and the grey-headed mynahs, two shikras and 50 munias left for north Bengal in the custody of a Deer Park official. 

 ?The birds were rescued from bird markets on Galiff Street and at Boral, Garia. These species of mynahs live in hilly terrain and cannot survive in the plains. So, they are being taken to Jaldapara,? said a spokesperson for the rescue centre. 

 ?The officer is carrying food, water and the necessary medicine for the safe journey of the birds,? he added. 

 Among the rescued birds was a cuckoo which could not be freed as it has fractured one of its wings. ?We also have a kite whose wings are permanently damaged,? the spokesperson told Metro. 

 The centre is also nursing a vulture, that was brought from a veterinary hospital run by a welfare organisation. 

 The vulture cannot fly, though experts have failed to diagnose any problem. It is set free every morning and put back in its the cage in the evening. 

 According to forest department officials, four vigilance teams, each comprising five to six officers and headed by an assistant wildlife warden, raid various markets regularly to rescue trapped birds and animals. The markets most often raided are in Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly and North and South 24-Parganas. 

 This year, the department has rescued around 1,800 birds (including some of endangered species) in Calcutta and around 2,500 in the districts. 

 ?A significant number of endangered birds are being traded, though the number has come down over the past few years,? said V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden. 

 Many of these birds are captured while they are still infant and most die either during transit or in captivity, he added.

 Apart from the birds, there are a large number of rescued animals waiting for their turn to be freed. Recently, a civet cat was rescued from the roof of a house in Khardah, North 24-Parganas. ?We are yet to decide where to release the animal,? an official said. 

 Among the animals rescued by the Salt Lake centre are 25 civet cats, 21 monkeys, nine langoors and five mongooses.

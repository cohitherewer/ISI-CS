 It seems straight out of Hollywood sci-fi movies. Scan your thumb to access safes, open doors and even encrypt data on your computer. With devices available right here in Calcutta.

 ?We are the first in India to provide biometric security solutions,? claims Debasish Sarkar of Robinson Innovation amp; Technologies (RIT), the company offering the gadgets. On display at the Industrial India Trade Fair on the Maidan, RIT?s product line seems impressive and has been pulling in crowds.

 The fingerprint safe lets you access the contents inside if it finds a suitable match for the fingerprint you provide. The process takes three seconds and in case of a mismatch, an alarm will wail. ?Some models can also access the Internet via a TCP/IP account and dial an emergency number,? says Sarkar. ?But we haven?t brought those models here, since the emergency number concept isn?t prevalent and incorporating the feature pushes up the product cost.?

 The door locks function in a similar way, running on only four pencil batteries for months. A higher-range model has password and voice-prompt options. A wireless lock controller is able to open and close locks within a range of 200 metres.

 Also on offer are biometric flash drives that can hold 128 MB to 1 GB of data. ?Besides data storage, they double as data encryption devices,? explains Sarkar. ?Attach the drive to your PC, select the documents you want to prevent others from accessing and provide your fingerprint to seal it. Only with a fingerprint match can the file be accessed later.?

 A biometric mouse, besides functioning as a pointing device, allows or denies the user to log on to the Windows operating system, based on the fingerprint match. All the devices have a 500 dpi (dots per inch) scanner at the core, imported from Taiwan and Hong Kong. The hardware-software integration is done in Calcutta.

 The safes cost Rs 16,500 to Rs 30,000, while the door locks have the same starting price and go up to Rs 25,000. The flash drives are priced Rs 5,500 upwards and the mouse around Rs 4,000.

 ?We have seen a great response for the products at this fair,? says Sarkar. Real-estate developers, small and medium-sized companies and high-end domestic users form the clientele.

 The company plans to start manufacturing the hardware from next year. ?We expect sales of Rs 5 crore by the next fiscal year,? signs off Sarkar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Tip-top tots

The Pujas are over but the festive season has a long 

way to go before a bow out. Lakshmi puja is coming up, followed by Diwali. Christmas 

is some way off yet, but there?s no stopping the little fashionistas strutting 

their stuff in trendy threads during the festival of lights.

The five days of fun and frolic are behind us, and 

all the new clothes you bought your tots have seen their fair share of wear and 

tear ? kids have an uncanny ability to make new things look old in a matter of 

minutes. So now it?s time to take your babies shopping for the next occasion. 

After all, they will outgrow the new gear well before Puja 2005?

Style guru

Nothing plain for the little ones, says Sonali Sanyal 

Chopra of Shoppers? Stop at Forum. The anchor store of the Elgin Road mall saw 

a whole lot of colours and sparkles rule the fashion waves for the infants and 

toddlers. Sequinned, frilly skirts and patchwork pants, ribbons and laces for 

the little ladies and embellishments galore for the lads on jeans and T-shirts.

Fun with fashion

Crushed cotton skirts and fitted pants with embroidery 

and sequins for the gals, track pants with double colour on the sides with matching 

jackets and tops for both boys and girls. Designer denims and dhotikurtas, 

salwar suits, pyjama kurtas and Disney collection T-shirts with cartoon 

characters ? it?s all there for the buying. Ginny amp; Johnny tops have been 

doing brisk business, too, in short, long and no sleeves.

Colourful couture

Pink, gold, orange, yellow, blue, black, checks, double 

colours? ?The retro look has been very popular for the boys, with double-colour 

T-shirts (a short-sleeved T sewn over a long-sleeved one), metallic shades, sandblasted 

denims, checked shirts and lots of embroidery and patchwork,? says Chopra. Tie-and-dye, 

camouflage and colourful corduroys, too, are in, explains Suresh Sadhwani, store 

manager, Pantaloons, 22 Camac Street. 

Festive gear 

For the girls, of course, the choice is wider, with 

gold prints on kurtis a particular festive favourite. Gaudy and bright 

is the look, which promises to continue till Diwali. Floral and butterfly prints 

are another preferred choice. ?There has been nothing casual or plain about this 

season. The trend has been towards bright colours and embroidery,? says Sadhwani. 

Even the kurtas and salwars are delicately embroidered. 

Winter?s here

The shelves are already being stocked up with winter 

goodies. And they are popular with the toddlers and their parents. Among the street 

and sportswear range is a colourful collection of jackets and trousers, with matching 

tops. Denim jackets are evergreen, and fleeces are as popular this season as the 

last. Full-sleeved T-shirts and shirts are fast flying off the shelves, as well. 

Accessorise

Headgear and belts are the most popular. Hair accessories 

like clips and bands are to dress those tresses, but the caps and hats are for 

everyone. And there is something for everything, with baseball caps to cowboy 

hats, party hats with frilly dresses and more. 

Belts are the other fad, from fabric to leather and 

denim, with designs and embroidery. Even socks and shoes are in bright shades. 

There are sandals and dainty party shoes to go with the ethnic outfits or western 

wear, and sneakers for the street smart.

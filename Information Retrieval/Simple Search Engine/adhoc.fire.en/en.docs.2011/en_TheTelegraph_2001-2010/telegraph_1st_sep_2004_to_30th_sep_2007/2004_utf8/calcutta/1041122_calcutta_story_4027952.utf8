 The pangs of fatherhood

 Most men have suffered and bemoaned the loss of a good friend when one among a group of close buddies assumes the responsibilities of family and fatherhood. The amusingly frustrating situation that men find themselves in when this happens is the stuff of Inside Fatherhood: A Tribute to the Pregnant Man, produced by the Norwegian theatre group, Innspaell. Written and directed by Orjan Hattren, the play humorously deals with the confusions and mental distress that Jens, an expectant father, is subject to; an experience no less daunting than that of the mother-to-be. Combining humor, music and scientific evidence, the actors present a lively, entertaining performance, full of slapstick comedy, warmth and laughter. The two musicians, who play important roles in the unfolding of the plot, apart from creating the right moods, also emphasize the action of the play.

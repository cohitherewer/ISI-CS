The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Return to the roots

A Bengali cannot get a better opportunity, is how 

composer Santanu Maitra (picture below) describes Parineeta, the multi-starrer 

from Vinod Chopra Productions, based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay?s novel. ?There 

is no pressure to produce item numbers or remixes; the subject is set on my homeground; 

the setting is in the 1960s and I have ample opportunity to score melody,? rattles 

off the man who still makes lips smack with his Bole Mere Lips, I love Uncle 

Chipps jingle. ?Vinod saab, who has a great ear for music himself, 

has given me complete freedom,? he adds about his producer, who is flush with 

the success of Munnabhai MBBS. 

 The unit has used the Pujas well, canning festive shots in south Calcutta and immersions at Babughat. And once Maitra reaches town in early-November, two vital recordings will take place ? a flourish of dhaak beats and a Tagorean strain hummed by a choir. ?I plan to keep as much of the Bengali flavour as possible. The dhaakis, in all probability, will be the ones acting in the film as well. As for the choir, I am not using any Tagore songs in the film. The composition for the background score will be mine, but in the Tagorean slow melodious mode.?

 If local composer Debajyoti Mishra is helping Maitra capture the Tagorean sound, his ?sounding board? is ace recording engineer Biswadeep Chatterjee, who has been in both Devdas and Raincoat. ?Even the day I conceived Ab ke Sawan (which became the Shubha Mudgal chartbuster) I consulted Biswadeep,? recalls Maitra.

The Bengali connection extends to other facets as 

well. Shreya Ghoshal will be the voice of the female lead (Vidya Balan, in picture 

above).

 Maitra?s association with Pradeep Sarkar, the director of the film, goes back to their advertising days, when the former was in client-servicing and the latter vice-president, creative, in Contract. ?Before Parineeta, we had done some music for ideation. He liked one tune and that?s how we started off on the seven songs that would be there in the film.? 

 Jingles, says Maitra, take care of his ?kitchen money?. ?My father, a sarodiya, was adamant that I do not take up music as a profession. But once I tasted blood with Uncle Chipps, I quit client servicing.? 

 Soon after that Ab ke sawan happened. ?Shubha was then in the eye of a storm, having just released Ali more angana, an Indipop album. But when I took the tune to her, we clicked.? Mudgal introduced him to lyricist Prasoon Joshi and the Mann ke manjirey team was formed.

 Maitra shifted base from Delhi with his initiation to Bollywood in the Dimple-Vinod Khanna starrer Leela, for which he scored three songs. His work in Hazaaron Khwahishen Aisi has also been appreciated. But it is Parineeta and a chance to catch up with Calcutta and his aunts here that he is looking forward to now.

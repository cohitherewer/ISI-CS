 The sins of smoking: by students

 The Graduates: They are the new faces of 

management, army style. The 2004 batch of the National Institute of Management 

Calcutta celebrates after its convocation ceremony, the sixth since the institute 

was established in 1997 by the Army Welfare Education Society, at Fort William 

on Saturday. Chief guest Aniruddha Lahiri, MD, ABP Pvt Ltd, delivered the keynote

Smoking has become a manly thing to do, according 

to the latest edition of Students Dictionary. While men mirror macho images 

of their idols, many girls take to the different forms of tobacco due to the influences 

of their peer group. To keep the burgeoning statistics of smokers under control, 

Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre has taken an initiative to spread 

awareness among young smokers.

 Participating in the Hriday Shaan programme were 20 

schools. The campaign consisted of activities like questionnaires and poetry, 

poster and debate competitions, eventually ending with the Student Health Parliament 

. The inter-school debate took place on August 26. Eight schools took part with 

two representatives from each, one for the motion and one against it. The topic 

was The Global Tobacco Agreement will strengthen the Indian efforts in Tobacco 

Control. There were various arguments for the motion, like without a beginning 

there is no end. The opposition said that the Framework Convention on Tobacco 

Framework will not be of use if people dont realise the ill-effects of tobacco 

consumption.

 On September 2, the Student Health Parliament took place at Kala Kunj. Issues ranging from health to finance were discussed, with occasional emotional outbursts from ministers adding to the flavour. The party names are worth mentioning. The ruling party was Swasti Seva Dal, the opposition, Samajdar Party. Other parties included Green-amul Party and We Can Party. During Question Hour, ministers were quizzed on issues relating to finance, health and family welfare.

 Hriday Shaan was aimed at creating awareness among youngsters, and although it cant be achieved in one day, the endeavour was a sound start.

One of the biggest national talent hunt contests, Hero Honda Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, has just wrapped up its final screening among college students in the city. From hundreds of entries for the initial selection on Friday, 13 guys and gals made it to the semi-final that was held on Saturday. 

 The GD Birla Sabhagar auditorium was full to capacity with cheerleaders from colleges, friends and family of the trembling 13, and music fans witnessed a three-and-a-half-hour event, which clubbed both the semi-final and the final among the top four. 

 A collection of Bollywood film songs from the 60s to recent releases comprised the fare offered by the hopefuls to judge Haimanti Shukla, who judged them on the basis of pronunciation, style of performance and sense of rhythm. For many, this was the first performance with a full orchestra and in front of an audience of 500. While being on centrestage robbed some of poise and calm, it acted as an energy-booster for others, who put in double the effort to win praise from judge and college mates. I am wondering which song to sing. I want to choose something that will get me more applause, said a confident Soptok Bhattacharya, who went on to win. 

 Relationship, responsibility, fear of failure, 

positive thinking, achievement orientation and more, through fun and games, were 

part of a recent three-day induction programme for students at Wigan and Leigh 

College. Picture by Pabitra Das

A tough task, admitted Haimanti Shukla, announcing 

the names of the four finalists, Soptok Bhattacharya, Soumyajit Das, Monalee Thakur 

and Ishita Chakraborty. Two rounds in the final had Soumyajit moistening a few 

eyes with his soulful rendition of Tu hi re, Soptok walking away with the 

biggest round of claps with Chappa chappa and the ladies doing their best 

with Monalee belting out the difficult composition originally sung by Reshma called 

Lambi judai and Ishita belting out Bairi piya, earlier sung by Sreya 

Ghosal, who is herself a find of Hero Honda Sa Re Ga Ma Pa.

 The final results had Soptok walking away with not just the claps but the award, too, in the guys section, and Monalee topping the girls category. The duo will represent Calcutta in the various stages of the In Campus contest that will now take place between finalists from across the country.

 Play for a cause

Hitting the streets with a cause to spread awareness on the perils of dowry, the members of the Legal Aid Society of the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) staged Jagaran, a street play, at Sealdah station and the Nandan premises, on September 3. 

 Scripted and directed by the members of the society, the 20-minute production, documenting the story of Basanti, was aimed at making people aware of how the age-old system has crippled our society. It also advocated initiating a collective drive to wipe out this practice. 

 The response from passersby and onlookers was very encouraging for the 15-member team of the society, who have been organising various programmes across the state to increase awareness on various legal issues. Enthused by the feedback, the team is gearing up to take its production to other places in the city, like Victoria Memorial, and the districts.

 War of words

 It was a chance to live the rock-n-roll dream. 

College bands from the east made the most of it in the regional finals of Campus 

Rock Idols. Funeral Fire from Darjeeling emerged on top, while Afflatus came in 

second. They now head to the national finals in Mumbai next week. One of the bands

Alma Mater sentiments flew thick and fast as distinguished men fought over whether the bureaucracy has failed the country at the ALSOC Challenge Debate 2004 on September 5. Organised by the Alumnorum Societas and Xaviers Old Boys Association, it saw the old boys from St Xaviers Collegiate School and St Michaels Patna battle it out. 

 The moderator was scientist and Xaverian Partho Ghosh, sporting the school tie. The first speaker, Prof N. Vishwanathan, verbally bashed the Michaelites before citing newspaper reports in which the vigilance commission had accused over 370 top bureaucrats of corruption. Michaelite Utpal Chatterjee countered that 370 of 40 million in India was an exception, not the rule.

 Xaverian Roopen Roy of PricewaterhouseCoopers said the bureaucracy, not bureaucrats, had failed the country. Citing sky-high corruption levels and a redundant system, he proposed a seven-point plan. 

 Michaelite B. Bhaskar Rao, top cop in Bangalore, stressed on how bureaucrats had helped in nation-building. Diplomat and bureaucrat of 40 years Xaverian Dipak Rudra pointed out the problems of corruption, sloth and increasing numbers of civil servants, admitting that the bureaucracy had failed to deliver.

 While general manager of Lafarge Cements Michaelite Neeraj Akhoury revealed that effective management in Indian bureaucracy had been proven to be among the best in the world, Xaverian Deborshi Barat, a first-year law student of NUJS and the youngest speaker, statistically proved how the typical bureaucrat worked for just one day in a year, how unapproachable they were, how ineffective the system was and how the steel frame of the country was redundant today.

 Former civil aviation minister Michaelite Rajiv Pratap Rudy said it was the polity and politics, not bureaucracy. that ought to be blamed. Proof the recent elections, which removed the apparently-progressive Andhra Pradesh government.

 Xaverian General Shankar Roy Chowdhury pointed out the strategic weaknesses which unfairly make the bureaucracy an object of accusation. Former election officer of Bihar Michaelite Ajay Narayan Jha, claimed that the delivery of the service sector had not failed. 

 The verdict, left to the audience, was declared a hung motion, with the Xaverians and the Michaelites sharing the trophy.

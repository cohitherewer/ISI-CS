The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rewind route to bring back the crowds

 It?s not often you see more Bengali and English films running at the city theatres than the number of Bollywood releases. Well, the vernacular rise in the celluloid count can surely be attributed to the Puja pot-pourri where the pandal-hoppers dropping into a hall would prefer an Aamar Maayer Aanchol to a Dhoom.

 But between the Aabar Ashbo Phires and the Shudhu Tumis, some Calcutta theatres have tried to play safe by screening Satyajit Ray classics like Sonar Kella and Pather Panchali. Screening films made five decades back goes very well with the mood of this filmi season, which has the word retro stamped all over it.

 A cursory glance at the English film releases in town rings in that turn-back-time flavour. Anthony Fuqua?s King Arthur, replete with the Excaliburs, Lancelots, Merlins, Guineveres and the Round Table, transports you instantly to the Roman-Saxon battle. 

 The costume drama (Keira Guinevere Knightley does choose to be in bare essentials) is not only about extended battle sequences and picture-perfect top-angle shots of stunning landscapes but also focuses on the more deep-rooted mini mind battles that the knights of Sarmatian origin waged against their personal freedom.

 While Fuqua re-interprets the Arthurian legend in his own way keeping the period peripherals (costumes, settings and eye for detail) in place, Gurinder Chadha is in strict masti mode with the British institution named Jane Austen.

 In her interview to Metro, Chadha had said: ?I like it that way. Being British, I have the right to play with her work.? Producer Deepak Nayar felt that the novel provided the ideal setting for a Bollywood potboiler. ?There are already four weddings in the novel and when you add Anu Malik?s songs to that backdrop, you have your masala entertainer,? he had said.

 While Bride amp; Prejudice hasn?t quite rocked the Indian box-office after the stupendous start, it has registered ?phenomenal collections? in the UK. While Aishwarya?s maiden foray into international cinema hasn?t bent the turnstiles like Beckham, it has been able to ring in the retro rage all right with the Elizabeths and Darcys storming back into daily gossip parlance.

 As for good ol? Bollywood, which is currently in slow gear despite new releases like Vaastu Shastra and Kis Kiski Kismat, it?s all rewind in the coming weeks. K. Asif?s 1950s magnum opus Mughal-e-Azam hits theatres this Diwali. With sights dyed and sounds digitised, it?s an all-new world that Dilip Kumar, Madhubala and Prithviraj Kapoor find themselves in. As for the audiences, it will need some doing from the restorers to divert them from the other Diwali release, Veer-Zaara.

PAST PERFECT

 Amidst the plethora of new Tollywood releases, old Ray favourites like 

Sonar Kella and Pather Panchali are running at the city theatres. 

 The English film releases include a new interpretation of King Arthurs 

life and a masala Chadha remix of the Jane Austen classic Pride and Prejudice.

 As for Bollywood, while a new all-colour Mughal-e-Azam will reach out 

to the young viewer, Madan Mohans three-decade-old melodies make Yash Chopras 

Diwali musical Veer-Zaara.

The return of director Yash Chopra (after a good seven years since Dil To Pagal Hai) is also past perfect, but with a twist. Essentially a romantic musical with ?no raised voices?, Chopra uses the late Madan Mohan?s unused tunes to convey Veer Pratap Singh?s (Shah Rukh Khan) ecstasy and agony of love for Zaara Umayat Khan (Preity Zinta).

 And that?s just the start-off point for the flashback beats of Bollywood. Up next will be Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s post-Devdas period drama Black starring Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee, Ketan Mehta?s long-in-the-making The Rising, Shyam Benegal?s four-hour-long epic Bose: The Forgotten Hero with Sachin Khedekar as Netaji and Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay?s Parineeta.

 So, with the Pujas gone, it?s time to groove to a different beat ? celebrating yesterday once more.

 Fringe fashion fever

 A fashion statement weaving together the stories of five of India?s top designers ? Rina Dhaka, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Nikhil amp; Shantanu and Suneet Varma ? was created in Tantra at the Blenders Pride Fashion Fringe, organised by Showhouse, on Friday night.

 The fashion fringe story was split into four parts. The first chapter told the tale of a modern woman. Be it a mid-day stop at a caf?, a power lunch or moving effortlessly from cocktails to a nightclub, Rina Dhaka captured and interpreted the life of the NOW woman ? young, trendy and hip!

 Using a delicate mix of satins, chiffons and crepes, Rina enhanced the silhouette of a woman. The charm of the persona she created lies in risks taken by this glamorous woman. The use of different styled sashes in black, purple, diamante and peach, worn with a flowing dress or skirt, played an important role in the complete look of this persona ? fur with boots, sequins and all. 

 The sheer power of entrapping a man with fabrics, class and style made Rina?s collection what it was.

 The second chapter opened up in the bohemian world of Kiran Uttam Ghosh. Using turquoise, red, lavender, white, black and a lot of silver and gold, Kiran?s Fashionista creates the chic woman who has the confidence to carry off any look or style from anywhere.

 ?I wanted to create something different, classy and yet vagrant. Taking scraps of fabrics in layers upon layers, I?ve managed to create pieces full of individuality and vibrancy,? says Kiran.

 The everlasting spirit of the 17th Century Rococo women is elegant, refined and decorative. Nikhil amp; Shantanu?s collection was ornate yet elegant, capricious yet refined. 

 With elements of extravagance and coquetry, this design duo signified freedom of speech in fashion and wearability. Sophisticated and yet chic and trendy, the clothes were an obvious choice for the club-hopper and upwardly mobile.

 ?I want to celebrate the spirit of youth and with it the essence of femininity. My clothes use sheer fabrics to provide that perfect drape for the curves of an Indian woman,? claims Nikhil, according to whom the trend is animal print in the colour haldi. Sheaths, sheers and silhouettes are the trademarks of his style.

 The epilogue fittingly came from the cutting table of Suneet Varma. He married style with affordability to create a woman who is ?sassy, sexy and spicy?!

 Pink was the colour that ruled this collection, very stylised and highly ornamental evoking strong reactions. Two things that stood out in his collection were the accessories in the form of bags as well as various embellishments for the legs.

 From hand-painted tattoos to shocking pink printed stockings, Varma showed off a bold woman, gutsy and youthful.

 Well-choreographed by Aparna and Tanya, the models sashayed down the bar-top depicting the essence and spirit of each designer?s clothes ? from stylish to vagrant and then from feminine to the bold and brazen.

 The hair styling and make-up, each different as per the look of the ensemble, was taken care of by Kapil Bhalla who created wigs, bold looks and neat, chic buns to suit the character of the attire.

 The talking points of the high-profile evening ? the presence of Jesse Randhawa, Diandra Soares, Bhavna Sharma, Tupur Chatterjee, Michelle Innes and Kiran Rao; the free Blenders Pride flowing at the bar, and some of the clothes?

Fusion fiesta

 If romping at the regular night spots of Calcutta was becoming monotonous and the music stereotypical, there is some good news for the natives of the night. Friday night saw the launch of Fusion, the bar-lounge-cum-restaurant-cum-disco at The Golden Park.

 Though the night kick-started at 8.30 in the evening, it was not before 10 pm that the select citizens started streaming in with their guests.

 Hogging the limelight and making the lensmen work overtime was Team Tollywood. The female fraternity comprised Indrani Halder and Locket Chatterjee, while the boy brigade was led by Jishu Sengupta and Abhishek Chatterjee.

 But the spotlight shifted as soon as some Mumbai men decided to drop in. The most-clicked combo of the bash turned out to be Shaan (who didn?t strain his voice box) and Sharad Kapoor (who seemed to have a real chilled-out time).

 As for the music, what began with Bryan Adams? Summer of 69 soon went fast-forward to Bollywood 2004. ?All the requests are turning out to be filmi,? exclaimed Dj Suraj Anand.

 Local lady Indrani sure had a Bolly blast on the dance floor, especially while moving to Mahi ve. The bar boys worked overtime dishing out heady cocktails like Blue Hawaiian, Hot Pants on the Rocks, Rocket Fuel and Martinis, and a good Fusion time was had by all.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Language barrier

 Film Studies lessons, Mohiner Ghoraguli numbers and a sheer love for cinema would have been enough to enjoy fully a Louis Bunuel classic at the 10th Kolkata Film Festival. Entering names a day ahead, waiting in queues for passes, an early morning taxi ride, morning tea in the Nandan compound. All in the name of cinema. Could life get any better? 

 That it couldn?t became clear once the Spanish film Los Olvidados started without subtitles in Rabindra Sadan. As Bunuel?s name flashed on the screen with the Eiffel Tower in the background, the jhola-toting Calcutta intellectual smiled inwardly and waited for the film proper to get rolling. Then screen urchins started playing street games and fighting in Spanish. No subtitles, yet. 

 The audience waited. Looked at each other. Eyebrows got busy, knitting themselves together. The movie went on, a blind man?s pocket was about to be picked. 

 Still no English subtitles. Now even Bunuel-lovers grimaced.

 Everybody hoped it was some horrible operational mistake that would be set right and Bunuel would be back with English tracks. But the next 88 minutes saw an onslaught of Spanish. Only. 

 However, the initial disgruntlement over, the babu then got determined to make his early morning trip worth it. He wrapped the scarf a little tighter around his neck, rubbed his hands together and settled down to understand the movie without any comprehension of the screenplay. The over-enthusiastic even went as far as to give grunts of disapproval at any noisy neighbour. Everybody tried to look for the ?poetry in motion? on screen and tried to fathom the storyline from the movements of the cast.

This was, however, not the first time the unsuspecting 

cinema-loving crowd had been disappointed during the film festival. Earlier, viewers 

of The Red Violin (picture of the cast ), which had won an Oscar for the 

best original score, were treated to the same fate. 

 A tale of passion, tragedy, romance and intrigue, The Red Violin centres around a contemporary auction in which a priceless violin with an infamous past is on the block. As the bidding mounts, the story flashes back to chapters in the violin?s history and the impact it had on its possessors. From its creation in 17th-century Italy, to imperial Vienna in the 1790s, to Victorian England in the late 1800s, to China in the mid-1960s, the dramatic story spans continents and sweeps centuries.

 During an elaborate introduction by Soumitra Chatterjee and the film?s producer Niv Fischerman, the audience perked its ears to catch some good music. As more than half the movie had a mix of various languages (probably), there was little else the viewer could do than catch some brilliant violin performances by Joshua Bell, scored by composer John Corigliano. However, there were a few bits in English, and Samuel L. Jackson and Greta Scacchi helped keep the attention focussed on screen, in spite of unintelligible language. And the never-say-die Calcutta crowd stayed put.

 As producer Fischerman put it: ?You invest everything in a movie and all is lost when they send a wrong print without subtitles. But Calcutta is amazing? hardly anybody left.? 

 In the name of cinema, never walk out.

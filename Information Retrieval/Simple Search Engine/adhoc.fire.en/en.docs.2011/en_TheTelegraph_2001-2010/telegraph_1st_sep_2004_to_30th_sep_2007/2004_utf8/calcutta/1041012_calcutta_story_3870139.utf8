 A killing, a murder bid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A murder and an attempted murder in two pockets of the city left the police rattled on Monday. 

 The first incident occurred at 3.30 am in the servant?s quarters on the eighth floor of Tivoli Court, on Ballygunge Circular Road. 

 A quarrel between two domestic helps turned violent, leading to the death of one. 

 Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Peeyush Pandey said the victim, Dilu Das from Giridih, was found lying on the floor with serious injuries in the neck and abdomen. 

 ?He was killed by Sanjoy Das, who fled after the incident. The killer weapon, too, is missing,? Pandey added. 

 Security guard Hridayananda Shaw heard someone cry out for help from the servant?s quarters. ?Shaw was posted on the 10th floor. As soon as he came down to the eighth floor, he found Dilu lying in the corridor,? Pandey stated.

 Dilu had been working at Partha Talukdar?s flat, on the 10th floor, for the past 16 years. 

 ?Talukdar had appointed Sanjoy a few weeks ago,? said a sleuth. ?Sanjoy would often quarrel with Dilu.? Dilu was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 

 In the other incident, an altercation among employees of a north Calcutta saloon left three injured. The assailant is absconding. 

 Police said 18-year-old Anjani Thakur, of Padmabati Lane, in Shyampukur, went berserk and attacked three persons with a razor.

 ?The incident took place early on Monday. Barber Murari Thakur woke up and saw Anjani clutching a razor and attacking Ramnath Sharma and Upendra Thakur,? deputy commissioner Pandey said. 

 ?Murari, too, came under attack when he tried to resist. All three were injured and admitted to RG Kar Hospital,? Pandey added.

 ?The attack, apparently, was a fallout of a rivalry,? said an officer of Shyampukur police station.

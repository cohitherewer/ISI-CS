The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 During the recent rains, it was noticed that some parts of Salt Lake are under 

knee-deep water. This sounds unbelievable for a township that has always been 

promoted as the tech hub of the state. It has been a long time since Kestopur 

canal was thoroughly dredged. The need of the hour is a complete revamp of Salt 

Lake?s drainage system. Given the current state of affairs, Saltlec will lose 

prominence in the eyes of potential investors from the IT industry, which is expanding 

at a brisk pace in Sector V. 

 Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town. 

 All of a sudden, prices of many essential commodities have increased, making 

it very difficult for elderly pensioners to make ends meet. The government should 

immediately curtail its unnecessary expenditure in hosting lavish parties and 

banquets on various occasions. Money, thus saved, will indirectly help improving 

the infrastructure in the state, which in turn will reduce sudden price fluctuations.

 Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park. 

 I am a marketing executive and I have to travel a lot in the city. For the 

past few weeks, I am finding it very difficult to commute via the Rashbehari crossing 

because the roads have been dug up by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for laying 

pipelines. Why don?t the traffic police divert the vehicles via Pratapaditya Road 

and Sarat Bose Road? Traffic police have to learn to take such decisions promptly. 

 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.

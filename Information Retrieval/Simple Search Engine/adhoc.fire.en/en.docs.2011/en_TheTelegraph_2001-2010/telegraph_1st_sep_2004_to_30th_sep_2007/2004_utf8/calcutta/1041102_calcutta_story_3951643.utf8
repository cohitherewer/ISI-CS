 Civic body in housing fracas

 - Buyers of unfinished premium flats want advance refunded with interest

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 

 In 1994, the Left Front-run Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had set about constructing a premium housing project on its ?prime? land on DL Khan Road. 

 Advance payments were taken from NRIs and central government institutions with a promise that the flats would be ready by 1997.

 But that is yet to be. Those who had paid in advance are demanding their money back with interest.

 The civic body had hoped to make a huge profit from the project. First, the one-and-half bigha land had come for free. Secondly, of the Rs 3.5 crore the authorities had estimated as the project cost, Rs 2.5 crore came into the civic coffer immediately after the project was announced.

 Worried over the turn of events, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has allotted Rs 1.5 crore to the project and development wing of the civic body and has ordered that the flats be completed by this month.

 Municipal commissioner Debashis Som has been asked to ensure that the deadline is met. 

 Altogether, 22 flats were booked in advance, 12 by the Victoria Memorial authorities and the office of the accountant-general (AG), Bengal. The AG?s office had paid Rs 55 lakh as advance and the Victoria Memorial, Rs 1 crore. 

 The Victoria Memorial authorities have got their money back but are claiming Rs 40 lakh more as interest. The AG?s office, too, is demanding a refund. 

 Mayor Mukherjee has decided to refund the advance amount or the full payment made by a few buyers, but without any interest. He wants to sell the flats to the corporate sector at a price of Rs 1,700 per square foot.

 The authorities fear disillusioned buyers, after getting their money back, may move court against the civic body, demanding interest on the principal amount.

 ?We want to complete the flats before the rest of the buyers start demanding refunds. In that case, the civic body can?t be dragged to court on the issue of interest payment,? explained CMC deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh.

 Mayor Mukherjee said around 30 flats will be available for sale and corporate houses will be given the first preference to buy them.

 Speaking on the civic body?s predicament, Mukherjee said: ?I have nothing to do. I am being forced to pay the price for the folly of the previous CPM-led board.?

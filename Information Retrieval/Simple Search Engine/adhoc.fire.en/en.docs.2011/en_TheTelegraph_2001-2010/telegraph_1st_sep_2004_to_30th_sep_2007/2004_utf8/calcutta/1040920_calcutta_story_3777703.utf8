 Howrah in safety scramble

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Wiser after last week?s tanker fire that claimed seven lives, the Howrah district administration has sent a slew of proposals to the state home department for approval.

 Seven persons, including a two-month-old baby, died when a tanker carrying diesel caught fire on National Highway 34, off Bally bridge, on September 11. 

 The proposals, according to officials, include construction of three fire stations in Liluah, Dhulagarh and Uluberia. Presently, Howrah city has only one fire station and it is increasingly failing to combat the rising number of mishaps. 

 Justifying the demand for more fire stations, Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said tankers loaded with petrol or diesel, from the Mourigram plant, ply the arterial roads of the district. If the three fire stations are set up, it will be easier for fire-fighters to reach the mishap spot on time. 

 The district administration has also proposed installation of 32 traffic signals at key intersections and deployment of traffic guards at eight points.

 Most traffic signals in Howrah city are now defunct because of lack of maintenance. ?The absence of traffic signals, too, often leads to accidents,? said a police officer. 

 According to him, 321 people died in road accidents last year. This year, the figure has already crossed 200. The increase in the average speed of vehicles on the highways, following their expansion, is partly responsible for the spurt in accidents, the officer added.

 The administration has also asked for increasing the number of constables. Currently, the district has only 300 constables, who are too burdened with work to man all important roads. ?To make up for the lack of adequate number of constables, we?ve proposed to involve vigilantes in manning the roads,? he said. 

 Besides, the administration has also urged the government to construct six footbridges on busy and accident-prone roads, such as Kona Expressway and Delhi Road. A functionary of the regional transport office in Howrah said construction of footbridges has been a long-standing demand of the residents.

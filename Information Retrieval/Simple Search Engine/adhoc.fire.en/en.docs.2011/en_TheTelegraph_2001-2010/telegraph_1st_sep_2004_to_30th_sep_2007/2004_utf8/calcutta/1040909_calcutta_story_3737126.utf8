The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A brush with Binodini

ZEESHAN JAWED

Husain?s 

obsession with Madhuri Dixit might be a thing of the past with Gajagamini 

pregnant for the second time, but somebody in Calcutta is sure following in his 

footsteps. 

 No it?s not Mrs Nene but the reigning queen of Bollywood, Aishwarya Rai who?s ?inspired? painter Arunabho Karmakar to do a whole series on her. 

 His paintings, part of an exhibition at Idiyas art gallery, vie for attention along with 200 canvases put up by 32 other artists.

 ?I organise an exhibition every two months, the sole purpose of which is to provide a platform for struggling artists,? said gallery owner Diya Jaiswal.

 The artists in turn lent a free hand to their imagination, painting untitled works in a riot of colours to match the theme of the exhibition called Rainbow. 

 The price tag reads at anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 50,000.

 Podi pick

 Dosa just got spicier with a more than generous sprinkling of chillis, ginger and garlic. Try Podi Dosa, the tangier version of the south Indian staple at Banana Leaf on 75 Rashbehari Avenue. 

 The exclusive eatery favoured by the thriving south Indian community in the area, has revamped its menu, giving patrons a wider choice in dishes from the Malabar coast.

 Kuzi Panayaram (fried idlis), Parotta Kurma (lachcha parathas) served with mixed vegetables cooked in coconut milk and garnished with grated coconut, are some of the variations from the idli-dosa staple one could look out for.

 Quiz culture

 Speak up for Child Rights may have been the theme for the Maruti Suzuki FACT (Free a Child Today) 2004 quiz, but the participants at the national-level quiz were required to rack their brains on subjects ranging from fashion to films, sports to politics. 

 The event, which started three years ago as a small initiative by a group of CRY (Child Relief and You)volunteers in Bangalore, has now become a national event with the best names from corporate India participating in it. The registration fees paid by the teams go into the CRY fund. 

 The regional finals of the eastern zone, sponsored by Bharat Petroleum, was held at Space Circle Club on Tuesday evening with six teams, among them BPCL, Lafarge, Eveready, Tata Steel, Tata Consultancy Services and Cognizant Technology Solutions reaching the finals. 

 It turned out to be a close fight with a quizmaster as relentless as Derek ?Brien. Fielding rapid-fire questions, Shomik Nag and Tathagat Chatterjee ? the two-member team from Lafarge ? finally emerged as the winners with Eveready and Tata Consultancy Services coming in second and third place respectively. 

 The Calcutta finalists will now lock horns with their counterparts from other zones in the country at the FACT finals to be held at the British Council auditorium in Delhi on September 26. 

 While the winners took away the trophy presented by Admiral H. Johnson, runners-up and other participants took home prizes sponsored by Colgate, Archies, Hotel Sea Coast, Linc, Tupperware and Lion India among others.

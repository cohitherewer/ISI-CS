The vibrant rusticity of the land of deserts and the ancient charm of Varanasi, woven together for an ?original Indian aesthetic? story that unfolds on the ramp tonight? The queen of couture is here to dazzle the city with a show worth remembering.

 Ritu Kumar will unveil a line which is more varied than the designer has done ?in a very long time? as part of her Winter Collection 2004 at a fashion show at Taj Bengal.

 The ?unique? show, with an audio-visual presentation, kicks off in Calcutta ? the city she hails from ? before rolling on to other destinations.

 ?I decided to flag off the show from this city because it contains certain crafts of Bengal as well. And, of course, I love coming to Calcutta,? said the designer on Thursday morning.

 The show will see the grand old lady of Indian fashion give a twist to her traditionalist take by re-inventing the classic style to suit the contemporary idiom.

 The show opens to a bridal sequence with a Mughal feel based on Maheswari weaves. The handloom story is taken forward in lehngas woven in Varanasi. ?The lehngas have been woven on naksha looms, the same kind that were used to weave the coats of the Mughal emperors. They were the highest form of couture one could think of,? said Kumar, re-affirming her revivalist take.

 It will then move on to a ?bindaas? pret collection comprising T-shirts in a riot of colours and patterns ranging from the Kutch region to the Pushkar fairs. The final collection draws inspiration from the Rajasthani gypsies and Flamenco dancers who, she feels, ?have the same blood lines and share a common thread in music, dance and clothing?.

 The colour story for the whole collection draws from Rajasthan and Varanasi and the look is that ?of exotic India?, explained The Good Life columnist.

 Varied as it seems, the common thread that binds the entire collection is the use of handloom and Indian crafts, something that the designer feels very strongly about. ?India is the only country in the world with a textile tradition so alive. There are 16 million craftspeople engaged in various crafts all over the country. So now it?s almost obligatory for a designer to make the best use of the traditional craft forms,? said Kumar. The need of the hour is to ?contemporise? the crafts to suit the needs of global fashion, she added.

 Her words have been mirrored in a range of T-shirts where she has used lots of hand blocks and traditional embroideries including kantha work.

 While the string of shows tops her priority list now, Kumar is also busy designing costumes for a Deepa Mehta film and her son Ashwin Kumar?s forthcoming movie titled Forest.

 ?I had designed the entire wardrobe for Deepa Mehta?s Bollywood Hollywood, too. The way she works suits me. I had done the clothes for all the characters so the film had an authentic look. But in most Bollywood films there are different designers for each character and so the costumes don?t look convincing,? she smiled.

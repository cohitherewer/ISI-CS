Gossip amp; games to spice up your kitty

Plan a Party

Zeeshan Jawed rustles up a rollicking 

recipe for a ladies bash

 Do 

Start the party post-lunch, but try to wrap up by early evening

If you are going to a restaurant, book the tables in advance 

Organise games like housie and cards 

 Dont 

Flaunt those heavy kanjeevarams (its supposed to be a casual affair)

Make the food too elaborate 

There is many a joke (cracked mostly by men) about 

how groups of women get their heads (or tongues) together in the afternoons to 

gossip about whos dating whose husband. But however much you ridicule the concept, 

kitty parties are a thoroughly enjoyable affair, provided you are in the right 

company. In case you are not tuned in on how to go about things, a few simple 

fundas will help you throw a rollicking kitty and win over the hearts of your 

society sisters. 

Happy hours

It is rather needless to say that kitty parties have 

to be hosted in the afternoons. After all, the whole idea is to make the best 

use of the hours when your husband is away at work and the children are in school. 

Start post-lunch; around 2 pm would be right. Dont start too late, you have to 

wrap it up by early evening to be in time to welcome the kids when they are back 

from school. 

Kitty kennel

The ideal venue would be your home, provided everyone 

else is away. If things are not that convenient, opt for the empty apartment of 

anyone in the group. The other option, and in fact the better one if you just 

want to let down your hair and relax, is a restaurant. But remember to make the 

booking in advance, especially if you are in a large group. 

Age no bar

It does not matter for how many years one has walked 

the earth, greying streaks are a sign of experience in most matters. So, while 

drawing up the guest list, include some such interesting characters to spice up 

the conversation. A word of caution for the not-so-olds: be careful of these greying 

grannies, they might not look very active physically, but their grey cells work 

overtime.

Chit chat

The agenda at a kitty party can be divided into three 

categories gossip, gossip and more gossip. That is the hook of a kitty party 

and, moreover, you get to know a lot about various things with different people 

having different stories to tell, explains Neera Khurrana, who has been a regular 

at such parties over the past 20 years. So, just let the gossip mills grind overtime. 

Game plan

To spice up the event, play housie or different card 

games. In fact, you can raise funds for the next kitty through such games. If 

you want a more elaborate affair, invite a professional make-up artiste or cook 

to join you and share some tips. That way, the time will be well-utilised while 

taking care of the fun factor. 

Noble angle

Take care that the party is not only about blabbering 

and back-biting. You can turn it into a platform for some noble deeds too. We 

often raise funds for good causes through kitty parties. If somebody in the group 

is in dire need of funds, we allow her to take the kitty with common consent. 

After all, the idea is to develop a bond with the people you are socialising with, 

feels Meena Khattar, a resident of Park Circus and a regular in the circuit.

Food note

The grub really depends on the number of people in 

the group. If its on the lower side of 15 then you can cook it yourself at home. 

But if it exceeds 15, you can either take the help of a home delivery service 

or ask each member to bring one dish. The food at a kitty party is usually snacky. 

With most women watching their waistline, stick to some non-oily but interesting 

fare like chaats, dahi vada or sandwiches. Make enough provisions 

for drinks so that every time someone goes dry in the throat gossiping, you have 

something to offer her. A welcome drink like lassi, mocktails or soft drinks 

should start the floor. Tea, coffee or a second helping of the welcome drink should 

suffice after snacks. 

Dress code

This can be a perfect opportunity to flaunt your new 

georgettes and chiffons. Keep the heavier silks for more formal dos. Since it 

is an afternoon affair, avoid dolling up too much. 

Tag along

This is a relatively new concept, but one that is 

proving to be quite popular these days. The idea here is to take your husband 

or boyfriend along with you to the party, provided you can risk the rest in the 

group feasting their eyes on your man.

Behind the bar

The most prized liquor from your bar will fail to 

impress if you don?t know what to mix it with. And a Martini would never be complete 

without a slice of olive, however well you may have blended it. Mixers and garnishes 

are as integral to a good drink as is the basic liquor. Good Life lists 

some common mixers and garnishes:

Tonic

Lemon and lime?flavo-ured quinine water. Most commonly 

used in: Gin tonic and Vodka tonic

Club Soda

Club Soda is carbonated water. Most commonly used 

in: Scotch and soda, Gin Fizz

Juices and soft drinks

Juices and soft drinks are primary mixers that are 

essential for any complete home bar.

Juices: Cranberry, grapefruit, lime, lemon 

juice, orange and pineapple. Most commonly used in: Rum ?? Coke and Screwdriver

Cream

Cream can mean heavy cream, half-and-half, whole milk 

or low-fat milk. Using heavy cream will yield a very creamy and filling cocktail, 

while low-fat milk will produce a very light, less-filling drink with a hint of 

dairy. Most commonly used in: Brandy Alexander and Mudslide

Grenadine

A sweet red syrup mixer for drinks, made from pomegranate 

juice. This strong-flavoured and coloured mixer usually requires only one or two 

dashes. Most commonly used in: Mai Tai and Tequila Sunrise

Bitters

Very effective secondary mixer used in small quantities 

to smooth out the taste of harsh and bitter liquors. Some bitters, such as Campari, 

are known to settle an upset stomach. The more popular bitters are Angostura Bitters, 

Abbot?s and Orange Bitters. Most commonly used in: Old Fashion and Rob Roy

Sour Mix

A combination of lemon, juice, lime juice and sugar. 

Most commonly used in: Gin Fizz, Margarita and Whisky Sour

Garnishes

Lemons and limes: These two popular garnishes add 

flavour to almost any cocktails

Celery Stalks: The Bloody Mary garnish of choice

Cocktail Onions: Added to the drink for appeal. A 

Martini with a Cocktail Onion is called a Gibson

Coffee: A key mixer for coffee drinks

Maraschino Cherry: Added to the drink for visual appeal

Olives: Used mainly in Martinis

Orange: Gaining popularity with the flavoured vodkas

Tobasco Sauce: Adds spice to the drink

Worcestershire: Adds a kick, used mainly for Bloody

One man with myriad roles

He was beautiful in The Lord of The Rings (with 

Liv Tyler in picture left), though we missed his dimpled chin, covered as it was, 

under Aragorn?s beard. But there is no missing it in Hidalgo, releasing 

in the city on Friday.

Viggo Mortensen stars in the film about a legendary 

horse race in Arabia, alongside Omar Sharif. The Ocean of Fire is a race that 

was held in the 19th Century. Frank Hopkins was the first American invited by 

a wealthy sheikh to participate in the prestigious event. He was believed to be 

one of the best riders in the west, and the Arab chose to challenge the cowboy 

and his mustang Hidalgo.

This film, like LOTR, allowed Viggo the chance 

to marry two of his main loves ? horses and acting. In the Rings trilogy, 

director Peter Jackman included more footage of the earthy actor on horseback 

than he intended, as Viggo is known as a fine equestrian. At the end of both films, 

he bought the horses he worked with.

But don?t confuse the half-Scandinavian Viggo for 

the rugged characters he plays on screen. The father of a teenaged boy is an artist 

in more ways than one. He is a painter, and you can see his work in A Perfect 

Murder, where he has painted his character?s studio walls caught on film. 

He is a photographer, and a good one at that. The latest issue of Premiere 

magazine has printed a spread of his behind-the-scenes shots on the sets of 

LOTR.

 Viggo Mortensen

The man who you have also spotted in Jane Campion?s 

A Portrait of a Lady, another Hitchcock remake Psycho, Crimson 

Tide and Carlito?s Way had started his career with aspirations of becoming 

a writer. So it is no surprise that when he could afford it, Viggo started his 

own publishing house, Perceval Press. Not only does this star write poetry, one 

of his volumes, Ten Last Night, was printed before he became famous. He 

is also a jazz musician with three CDs till date.

Viggo is a bit of linguist as well. The Danish citizen 

speaks his native tongue, as well as Spanish, possibly because he lived in South 

America for a number of years as a child. He put these skills to use too, working 

as a translator during the 1980 Winter Olympics.

While Viggo is currently working on Alatriste, 

slated for 2005 completion and A History of Violence, when he has needed 

to he has donned less plush hats. He has roughed it out as a truck driver while 

living in Denmark, waited tables and bartended, been a dock worker and flower 

seller.

This is a man not ashamed of wearing his heart on 

his sleeve, either. He has made many an appeal for peace, at the risk of being 

labelled fashion victim (he really did wear appaling outfits to protest the US-led 

war in Iraq). But this man, comfortable in many hats, is not likely to care one 

jot.

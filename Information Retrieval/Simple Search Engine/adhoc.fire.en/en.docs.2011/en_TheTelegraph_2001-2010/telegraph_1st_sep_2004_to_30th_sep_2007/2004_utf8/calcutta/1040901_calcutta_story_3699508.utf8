The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Campus club is placement pilot

 - Success strategies at Jokas September workshop for B-school outsiders

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 What: 

A workshop for management students to help them face recruiters better

Why: Recruiters regularly change the selection 

parameters and so students need to be clued in

Where: IIM Calcutta

For whom: Students of city B-schools, the 

one in IIT Kharagpur and the host campus

With placement fever both summer and the final setting in, the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) has decided to play big daddy to B-schools beyond Joka.

 The third week of September will find the consulting club in the countrys premier B-school hosting a two-day workshop for MBA students in the city.

 The objective of the club that organises a host of events on campus is to empower students in Joka and beyond with success strategies as they start preparing for the all-important interviews.

 We will be inviting students from other management institutions in the city and also from the Binod Gupta School of Management of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, said M. Scalem, president of the four-year-old outfit on the Joka campus.

 Interested candidates will have to send in their applications to enrol for the workshop, covering basic bio-data tips to complex career choices. The applications will be screened before drawing up a final list of around a hundred off-campus participants.

 We will have to maintain a cap on the number of participants from other B-schools to make the deliberations meaningful and effective. Since the discussions will be different for the IIMC students and other B-schools, the sessions will be held separately, quot; explained Scalem.

 For the workshop, the consulting club has tied up with PeopleOne Consulting. The full spectrum human capital services company, which focuses on providing executive search, recruitment, training and temporary staffing services to various client companies, will send a team to hold the workshop, billed as the first such initiative on the IIMC campus.

 Students have lots of questions regarding interviews and making the right career choices. The PeopleOne team will make detailed presentations on a range of issues, said Ankur Singh, a second-year student and member of the consulting club.

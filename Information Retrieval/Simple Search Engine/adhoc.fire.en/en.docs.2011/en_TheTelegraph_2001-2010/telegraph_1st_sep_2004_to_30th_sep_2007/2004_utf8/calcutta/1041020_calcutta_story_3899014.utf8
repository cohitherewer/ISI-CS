 Glamourshun in ribbon routine

 KINSUK BASU 

 The much-awaited Dimple appearance at puja inaugurations has been called off. So has Bhagyashree?s. Guess why? 

 High-spending puja organisers in the city are simply not willing to splurge on Bollywood beauties. And to cut the ribbon, they have lined up a clutch of Tollywood celebrities, mostly soap regulars.

 ?Dimple Khanna was supposed to inaugurate at least 10 pujas across the city, including Beleghata, Tangra, Lake Town and Garia. The dates had been set and the organisers informed. But some last-minute hitch led to the cancellation of her trip,? said one of her agents. 

 As a part of the package, she would have to be paid for her trip, stay and appearance. But the organisers decided to put their foot down. 

 ?We are not into showbiz. Ours is a para pujo, with a touch of creativity. Still, we end up spending from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 for rituals alone. If showbiz is to be added, we may have to curtail that amount,? said Utpal Roy of Bhowanipur Durgotsav Samity. 

 Most organisers have reportedly saved at least Rs 10,000 by opting for Tollywood stars. While a Bollywood big name charges between Rs 40,000 and Rs 50,000 for an appearance, the rate is much lower for home-grown stars.

 The craze for Bollywood is, however, still on among Kali puja organisers. 

 ?For Diwali and Kali Puja, we have booked Kapil Dev and Amisha Patel,? said an agent of the actress. The package for both will cost Rs 4 lakh. 

 Rani Mukherjee?s name, too, is being discussed.

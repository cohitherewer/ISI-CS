 Guard robbed at gunpoint

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three armed youths snatched a bag containing Rs 1.8 lakh from a 48-year-old security guard of a private firm on Tuesday. The guard was on his way to deposit the money in a bank.

 The incident took place around 10.20 am, a few yards away from the Lalbazar police headquarters. 

 Hearing Sunil Sil?s cries for help, onlookers and an on-duty traffic constable rushed to his aid, but in vain.

 Hare Street police have started a probe into the case. 

 According to police, Sil was on his way to the Mission Row branch of Allahabad Bank to deposit the money when the youths started following him. 

 They accosted him near Coal House, on RN Mukherjee Road, and tried to snatch the bag containing the money at gunpoint. 

 Sil, who regularly carries money to the bank, resisted. One of the youths slapped him and snatched the bag when the guard lost balance.

 ?When we realised that the guard, who was in uniform, was being robbed, we rushed to his rescue. The youths, however, ran down Mangoe Lane and disappeared into the crowd,? said an eyewitness.

 Sil then walked to Hare Street police station and lodged a complaint.

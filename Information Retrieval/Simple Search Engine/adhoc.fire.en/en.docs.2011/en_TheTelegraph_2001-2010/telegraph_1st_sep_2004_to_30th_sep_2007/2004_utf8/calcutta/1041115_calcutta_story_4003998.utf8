The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Temporary depots for tenders

 BAREN SEN, director of West Bengal Fire Services, met readers of The Telegraph in his office last week to answer their queries. 

Participants included Sailen Bhattacharjee, Saibal Chakrabarty, Sandip Banerjee, S.H. Khan, Anver Kamal Siddique and Arup Roy

Saibal Chakrabarty: It takes a lot of time for fire tenders to reach a mishap site because of traffic snarls. Have you thought of any way to speed up the movement of fire engines?

 In order to ensure that fire tenders aren?t delayed in reaching a spot, we are stationing them in different parts of the city. We are commissioning eight temporary fire stations, where fire tenders will be posted. The idea is that the tenders nearest to the fire can rush to the spot before reinforcements arrive from other places.

 The temporary fire stations will be located in Topsia, Tollygunge, Muchipara, Watgunge, Metiabruz, Shyampukur, Lake Town and Taltala. We are also trying to keep fire tenders beside police stations so we can utilise the police network in addition to our wireless network. We are also planning temporary fire stations in Howrah.

Sandip Banerjee: Police have recently introduced ?Dial 100? toll-free telephone service in south Bengal districts. Is the fire department?s ?Dial 101? effective in the districts?

 No, our 101 helpline facility extends from Baruipur in the south to Barrackpore in the north, and up to Konnagar in Hooghly. If a fire breaks out beyond these areas and someone calls our control room, we give the phone number of the nearest fire station. Our control room numbers are 22521165/ 6170/ 0163/ 2222.

Arup Roy: Will existing residential buildings also have to obtain licences from the fire department? How will you classify the buildings?

 For now, residential buildings are spared. But residential estates and big markets will have to obtain no-objection certificates.

 We will classify buildings on the basis of their vulnerability to fire. The owners will be instructed to take precautions before we issue no objection certificates.

Sailen Bhattacharjee: When a fire breaks out, several fire tenders, perhaps more than the number needed, are rushed to the spot. Doesn?t this hamper fire-fighting operations in other parts of the city?

 Several fire tenders are sent to one spot to ensure that there is no dearth in water supply. In case another fire breaks out at a different location, we ask the unused fire tenders from the first spot to move to the second. 

 We then send our bulk water carriers of 18-kl capacity each to the first spot so that there isn?t a water crisis. 

 It is not right to say that in case of a multiple outbreak of fire, we concentrate on one while overlooking the others. If we feel the need for more resources, we get in touch with other divisions and fire stations and arrange for additional fire engines.

Sandip Banerjee: You instruct puja organising committees to coat their pandals with fire-proof chemicals. But do you have any registered shops from where the chemicals can be obtained, especially because they are hardly available in the market?

 No, we do not have registered shops that sell fire-proof chemicals. Neither do we have a website nor an interactive system to provide information about suppliers of fire-fighting goods. 

But we do keep a record of manufacturers and suppliers 

of fire-fighting equipment and chemicals. If any individual or group wants to 

procure such equipment or chemicals, they can approach us. We will provide contacts, 

from whom the requirements can be procured. But we do not check the quality of 

goods, and hence cannot certify the products. We do, however, recommend manufacturers 

and suppliers whose products we use.

Concluded

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fire panic in school

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tension rocked Kendriya Vidyalaya in the Cossipore Gun and Shell Factory compound on Friday morning when smoke was seen billowing out of a meter-box. 

 Three fire tenders brought the blaze under control.

 Police said the smoke was noticed during the prayer session before class. ?The teachers and students panicked. The school authorities called us,? said a fire brigade official. ?We did not want to take any chances. Three fire tenders were rushed there and the fire was doused in 10 minutes.?

 In the wake of the Kumbakonam school fire disaster in Tamil Nadu, fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee, on hearing of Friday?s blaze, asked school education minister Kanti Biswas whether it was possible to introduce a lesson on fire prevention in school textbooks.

 Medicine freshers beaten up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A section of first-year medical students of R.G. Kar Medical College was beaten up and forced to go without dinner at the Maniktala hostel on Monday night after a clash with SFI members. 

 Around 100 freshers refused to pay Rs 300 each as development fees, after which the miscreants beat them up. 

 The Democratic Students Organisation (DSO) has claimed the assaulted students are its sympathisers.

 Around 10.30 pm, police from Amherst Street thana arrived following the students complaint, but were asked to leave by hostel superintendent Apurba Lal Sarkar, who claimed that things had returned to normal. 

 The violence began soon after. On Tuesday afternoon, a police picket was set up on campus. The DSO demonstrated outside Sarkars office, as the incident had occurred in his presence, it claimed.

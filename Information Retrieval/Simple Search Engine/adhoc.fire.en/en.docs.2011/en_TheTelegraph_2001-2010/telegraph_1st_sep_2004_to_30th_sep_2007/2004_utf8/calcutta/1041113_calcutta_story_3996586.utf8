The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 December date for twin flyover links

 BARUN GHOSH AND SIMI KAMBOJ 

 Calcutta is all set to record an increase in the number of flyovers with the ones at Lake Gardens and Sonarpur, both in south Calcutta and eight and four years in the making, respectively, ready for commissioning. 

 At a time when the transport department is trying to get Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to open the flyovers within the next few weeks, officials were also drawing up plans to rectify a major fault at the Lockgate flyover. Within three months of its commissioning, the flyover has proved to be accident-prone. 

 On Friday, officials said the flyover near Lake Gardens railway station, and the Sonarpur flyover near Sonarpur railway station will be ready for operation by December-end.

 Two pedestrian bridges will be built over the 1.2-km flyover at Chitpur, inaugurated three months ago. ?The idea is to ensure that people cross the road safely,? an official said. As is the case, the 600 m-long flyover over the Sonarpur level-crossing will connect Rajpur to Narayanpur across the Sealdah-Baruipur section of Eastern Railway.

 ?Construction work on the flyover is being undertaken by Ircon International on a turnkey basis. The Rs 9-crore flyover will help reduce congestion at Sonarpur railway crossing,? R.K. Chakraborty, chief engineer (traffic and transportation), Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, said.

 Though the authorities maintained that the twin overbridges on Lockgate flyover were part of the original plan, a transport department official admitted that the mounting number of casualties had forced them to accede to the local residents? demand.

 ?Vehicles gain a speed of 50-60 km an hour while descending. Besides, as motorists do not expect any cross-traffic, they are caught off guard spotting a pedestrian crossing the road,? said an official, elaborating on the spurt in mishaps.

 The two overbridges, at a distance of 300-400 m from each other, will be built at 5.5 m over the flyover. Each overbridge will be around 3 m wide. 

 ?A gap of 5.5 m, as specified by the Indian Roads Congress, will have to be maintained between the bottom road surface of an overbridge and the flyover road surface to enable lorries to pass unhindered,? explained a project engineer.

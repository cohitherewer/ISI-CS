The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 This letter is an appeal for help to people across society. At 2.30 pm on August 

31, 25 hooligans from a neighbouring para killed a two-year-old stray dog 

of our locality. They cornered the animal and battered it to death with bricks 

and bamboo sticks. Then they dragged the mangled body to the end of the lane and 

dumped it in a garbage vat. Not a single voice of protest was raised. My mother 

(Anjana Bhowmick) tried to convince them to let the stray be taken away by the 

People for Animals (PFA), but her pleas fell on deaf ears. By the time the PFA 

van arrived, it was too late. Local residents have been complaining over the past 

three months that the dog would chase people on bicycles. Perhaps it was because 

he had been run over by a cycle earlier. To save him from running into trouble, 

I got him sterilised and vaccinated. But when the dog kept intimidating people, 

I suggested sending him to an animal shelter. I had given the phone numbers of 

a few NGOs to local residents. But I am baffled why they didnt call the NGOs 

or the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to take the dog away instead of killing 

him? Who gives them the right to kill the animal? These very people are members 

of the local Puja committee that undergoes a pious change during the festive days. 

Doctors, professors and educated professionals live in our neighbourhood. Dont 

they realise that bringing up their children in an environment that supports such 

a barbaric act will only encourage criminal behaviour?

 Nelanjana Bhowmick, Sinthee. 

 A urinal constructed several years ago along Curzon Park, near Raj Bhavan, 

has become a nuisance for visitors to the park and passers-by. The urinal has 

no drainage system and the filth flows onto the nearby tram tracks, emitting a 

nauseating stench. Pedestrians dare not walk on the footpath in front of the urinal. 

The Corporation should either pull down the structure or provide it with a proper 

drainage system.

 Although the stretch between Patipukur and Nager Bazar has been widened, it 

is not yielding the desired results. The road under Patipukur rail bridge is narrow 

and in a deplorable condition. All the good work done is being frustrated. The 

stretch needs immediate repairs. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee, Nayapatty Road. 

 New letter boxes have been installed in Puddapukur, on Lower Rawdon Street 

and AJC Bose Road. But some of them are left without a lock. Nobody seems interested 

to lodge a formal complaint with the postal authorities. 

S.S. Almal, Lower Rawdon Street.

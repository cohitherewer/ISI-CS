 Meet the ants who take you to the movies

 They are the only two people working simultaneously on Subhash Ghai?s Kisna, Pooja Bhatt?s Rog, Sanjay Gupta?s Musafir, Vishal Bharadwaj?s Blue Umbrella and Mahesh Manjrekar?s Viruddh.

 ?Communication experts? Rajiv and Joy, founders of Bollywood?s numero uno image design company, Marching Ants.

 The twosome trained in mainstream advertising with Rajiv learning fine arts and Joy going to a management institute. After working together in Ambience Advertising, the two went their separate ways. Rajiv subsequently worked with MTV and contests2win.com while Joy joined hands with an event agency.

 ?Around three years ago we met at an event and decided to float this company that would cater to the design and image management of clients. Marching Ants was born and six months down the line, we realised films is the area where we can really exercise our freedom,? says Joy.

 The Esha Deol-Zayed Khan starrer Chura Liya Hai Tumne marked the first steps into filmdom for Marching Ants. ?But it was Ek Hasina Thi that got us into the reckoning,? says Rajiv. ?We were one of the first to be briefed about the film. In fact, a big part of the film idea came from our design. We realised we did have a lot to contribute in the making process of a film. For the first time, film stars were used the way they were in Ek Hasina Thi. At that time, people around us were just playing safe. We tried to experiment by creating textures for the two characters, Saif and Urmila. They were made to look like characters and not their star selves.?

 Since then, that has been the trump card for Marching Ants: playing with characters, not stars. ?If you watch the publicity for Dev, it?s evident the makers want you to come and watch Amitabh, the star. But if you check out the promotion campaign we have designed for Viruddh, it talks about Amitabh, the old man,? reveals Joy.

 Post-Ek Hasina Thi, Rajiv and Joy went on to create the publicity designs for Pooja Bhatt?s Paap, Farhan Akhtar?s Lakshya, Revathy?s Phir Milenge and Ram Gopal Varma?s Vaastu Shastra. But a giant leap was the recent Varma film Naach. ?We had a barrier to cross and that was we did not want to be connected to Rangeela,? explains Rajiv. ?RGV (Varma, of course) made that very clear. So we started with the logo itself. When you hear the word Naach, you have this feminine, curvy feel to it. But we did just the opposite and then this whole idea was translated to the rest of the creative process. We also played around a lot with the working stills from the movie. We did a whole lot of treatment to the stills and tried to synergise with the other stills. We wanted to give the impression of a dark love story.?

 Sanjay Gupta?s Musafir is another project that sounds the bugle for Marching Ants. ?Sanjay got so excited with our designs that he even adjusted the script,? says Joy. ?In fact, Anil Kapoor?s look came from our design. We just wanted to complement the working style of Sanjay and the huge star cast he had assembled. The film promotion had to be heavy on style. The brochure we created was met with a very positive response at the IIFA Awards.?

 If there is a problem, it?s the problem of plenty. ?It?s difficult to do a period film like Kisna, a comedy like Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh and an erotic thriller like Rog simultaneously. But we know how to switch on and off from project to project. And it also lets us work with the very best in the industry,? says Rajiv.

 There are still many who ask Rajiv and Joy, ?what exactly do you do in a film?? ?All we say is, ?Whatever you have seen that makes you go to the film is done by us?. Everything from on-air promos to off-air posters and outdoors,? signs off the duo.

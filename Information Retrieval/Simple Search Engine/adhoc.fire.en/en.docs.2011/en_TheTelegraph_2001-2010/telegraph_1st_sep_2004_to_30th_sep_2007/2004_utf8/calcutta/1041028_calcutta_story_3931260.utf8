 Twilight turbulence

 We live in a world where the relationships we build are private and intimate, yet inextricably intertwined with our relationships with other people. Thus, problems and complexities are bound to develop in all our relationships when any one of them is severed, particularly under distressing circumstances. This is the theme of Sayak?s latest production, Saanjhbela, a play that explores human relationships in the context of its fragility, highlighting the harsh truth that the closest of relationships is prone to vulnerability. Directed by Meghnad Bhattacharya, with Swatilekha Sengupta and the director himself in the lead, Saanjhbela deals with the stressful situation that suddenly erupts in an apparently ordinary household with the entry of Alokesh, a man with whom Shrimoyee, now mother of two teenaged children, shared a relationship with in the days of her adolescence. As the story progresses towards its inevitable denouement, what makes it poignant is the conflicting emotions, mental anguish and moral dilemma experienced by all the characters, specially the two children.

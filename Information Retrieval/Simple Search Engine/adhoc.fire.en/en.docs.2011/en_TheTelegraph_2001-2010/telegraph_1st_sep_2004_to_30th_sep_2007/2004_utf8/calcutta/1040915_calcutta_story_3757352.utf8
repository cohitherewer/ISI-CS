 Self-defeating: Sloganeering on SSKM Hospital 

premises seeking better medical facilities

Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

 Shibpur

 While hospitals should see to it that there are no lapses on their part, some amount of restriction is necessary for prevention of disruption by relatives and friends of patients, who raise hell if something goes wrong. Public relations officers should communicate the right mode of conduct to visitors while a vigilance team should work round the clock to pre-empt disruptions.

Debyani Basu, 

 Birati

 Corruption has seeped into every nook and cranny of state-run hospitals these days. From procuring a bed for a patient to getting blood from the bank, every step is infested with touts who usually reside on the hospital premises illegally. Thanks to these encroachers, hospitals have become hubs of criminal activities. So, hospitals should see to it that such trouble-mongers are not allowed into hospitals.

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 

 Barrackpore

 The administrative authorities of our hospitals pay no attention to the invasion of the premises by outsiders, touts and stray animals, which disrupts the normal working of the place. Restriction of entry to hospitals is needed to maintain a healthy working atmosphere in hospitals.

Biswanath Bhattacharyya, 

 Haridebpur

It will not be a good idea to restrict entry to hospitals. 

There is hardly any instance of forceful entry or vandalism without genuine cause 

or grievance. To pre-empt disruptions, such complaints should be redressed rather 

than restrictions imposed on entry to hospitals.

Diptimoy Ghosh, 

Salt Lake

For a peaceful atmosphere in hospitals, restriction 

of entry is essential. But in some cases this can be relaxed for relatives of 

patients in critical condition, whose presence is often required round-the-clock. 

But even then, nobody else should be inconvenienced due to this. 

Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake

 Yes, there should be restrictions on entry to hospitals. Often it is seen that after a patient?s death, his relatives, in the company of local goons, start vandalising the hospital premises, beating up doctors, nurses and other hospital staffers. To stop such unwanted activity, restrictions should be clamped on entry to hospitals.

Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 Peace and quiet should always be maintained in hospitals. Visitors should be allowed in only during visiting hours. Proper identification cards should be issued to the families of patients, so that only they can enter the hospital. Even legitimate visitors should maintain silence within the hospital building.

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata

 There should definitely be some restriction on entry to hospitals to pre-empt disruptions by relatives of patients. At the same time, there should be some method of keeping the patient?s family informed about the individual?s condition. That would ease his family?s tension. A good relation between the hospital and its patients will help stop disruptions by curbing a family?s dissatisfaction.

Sudipta Dey, 

 Sheoraphuli

 How can relatives and friends of patients be denied entry to hospitals? The authorities should, instead, ensure that patients get the best treatment possible and impose restrictions on touts, hawkers and other illegal entrants.

Sounak Chakraborty,

 Baranagar

 Absolutely. Trespassers should not be allowed on the hospital premises. Authorities should take adequate precautions so that every patient is taken care of and irate relatives do not get the chance to kick up a row, because of what they think is a case of negligence of doctors? duties.

 Prahlad Agarwala,

Majdia

Often outsiders enter hospitals at the instigation 

of the families of patients. Hospitals incur the wrath of relatives through negligence 

of duties. But relatives, friends or sometimes even local political goons create 

a lot of trouble in hospitals at the slightest provocation, jeopardising the treatment 

of other patients in the hospital. So, entry to hospitals should definitely be 

restricted to pre-empt disruption. 

Hara Lal Chakraborty, 

Arabinda Nagar

If there is negligence in duties of staff, the mob creates a ruckus. This should 

be avoided at all costs. But administrative authorities of hospitals seem to accept 

political interference.

Biman Saha, 

Lake Town

Whenever a patient is admitted to a hospital, family members should be given only 

two entry passes by the hospital authorities at a time and a particular hour should 

be set aside just for visiting purposes. The authorities should see to it that 

family members of a patient do not disturb the other patients in the ward. This 

should be strictly followed to pre-empt disruptions. 

P. Pramanik, 

 Santoshpur Avenue

 Like private nursing homes, government hospitals, too, should restrict entry of relatives of patients to pre-empt disruptions. These incidents in hospitals are caused by angry relatives and friends of patients, backed by political parties. It has now become a chronic condition, so much so that only a drastic restrictive step can solve the problem.

Sandip Banerjee, 

 Harish Mukherjee Road

 Every government hospital of West Bengal should have adequate facilities to attend to emergencies of all types. There should be medicines and specialist doctors at hospitals, for treatment of patients in critical conditions. If the families of patients are thus satisfied, there would be no fear of work getting disrupted by irate relatives of patients. 

A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

 Bandpur

 Visitors? entry to hospitals should definitely be restricted, specially in the afternoons and after 10 pm. But what about members of the Group D staff, who often create nuisance on the hospital premises? Cases of patients being molested inside government hospitals by outsiders are not new in the state. Incidents such as these call for restriction of entry.

 Sandhya Banerjee, 

Salt Lake

Entry to hospitals should be restricted to visiting 

hours only. Issuing visiting cards is a common practice in hospitals and nursing 

homes. Sometimes two visiting cards are issued at a time. During the routine visiting 

hours, friends and families of visitors should behave in a way such that other 

patients are not disturbed. 

Anirban Mondal,

Chinsurah

Hospitals are places for treatment and every measure should be undertaken to provide 

the best facilities to patients. Relatives visiting a patient should be responsible 

and not disturb others. So, restriction of entry to hospitals is necessary.

Md. Ayub, 

Bright Street

Despite a system of visitors? passes, entry to hospitals 

is rampant. At any given time, most wards in government hospitals are filled with 

family members of patients, who do not bother about the norms of hospitals, as 

well as sales representatives. Negligence of security guards is to be blamed for 

this. So restriction of entry to hospitals should be implemented to pre-empt disruptions. 

Anil Kumar Sen, 

 Ramchandra Chatterjee Lane

 Restricting entry to hospitals would be a justified move. It has been long overdue because a crowd, causing disturbances, mars the peaceful atmosphere in hospitals, with scant regard for the other patients. These trouble-makers disrupt normal work in a hospital, disturbing doctors and nurses while they go about executing their duties. Hence, to pre-empt disruptions in hospitals, some form of entry restriction is necessary.

 Court rap for Lake delay

 - Railway told to stick to ouster date with police, state help

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court has given the authorities yet another prod over eviction at the Lakes.

 A division bench of Justice Barin Ghosh and Justice Aloke Kumar Basu on Thursday directed Eastern Railways (ER) to evict the 20,000-odd squatters on rail land along Rabindra Sarobar, with assistance from the state government, Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Calcutta Police.

 The deadline is November 16 and the aim is preservation of the Dhakuria Lakes.

 ?You (ER) have to carry out the Supreme Court order and remove the squatters from the area, even if the issue of their rehabilitation is not settled by then (November 16),? the bench ordered.

 Thursday?s was the second court ruling on the eviction, which political forces have managed to stall on one pretext or the other.

 ?Who are we to pass an order that is contradictory to the order passed by the apex court of the country? The high court will be held liable if the railway does not evict settlers, as directed by the Supreme Court on April 17, 2003,? the order read.

 The bench directed the ER general manager to convene a meeting with representatives of the state government, the city police chief and the CMC commissioner three weeks from Thursday?s order.

 ?The railway will have to chalk out the plan in that meeting to evict the settlers,? the bench stated.

 Early on Thursday, police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty placed a report before the court, saying that on May 4 and 5, 2002, a large force was deployed to assist ER in the eviction of squatters along the Lakes. ?But at that time, the railway authorities refused to evict the illegal settlers,? the report added.

 The city police chief claimed that since then, the department had made several attempts at communicating with the railways, but there had been ?no reply from the other side (ER).?

 Appearing for the settlers, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy told the bench that both the Central and the state governments had assured his clients that they would be provided with shelter under the Valmiki Ambedkar Abasan Yojana. 

 Roy also prayed for time for the settlers to vacate the railway land.

 Environment activist and petitioner Subhas Dutta told the court the eviction issue had been pending for too long. 

 ?And why is the Calcutta Improvement Trust (which maintains the Dhakuria Lakes) not making an effort to develop the other environmental aspects of the Lake area?? wondered Dutta.

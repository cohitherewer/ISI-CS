 Sean Connery: The name?s...

 The name?s Bond, James Bond. And he is all over the small screen this October, to shake you up. This month, Zee Movie Zone will bring you the very best of 007 films, every Sunday at 8 pm. It all starts with From Russia With Love on October 3, where the evil SPECTRE has hatched a plan to steal a decoder that will access Russian state secrets. While fighting the scheming Red Grant (Robert Shaw), Connery also has his hands full with the ruthless Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) and the stunning Soviet defector (Daniela Bianchi).

 October 10 is Goldfinger day, where Gert Frobe plays the deadly Auric Goldfinger with the beautiful Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) and the sexy Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) making up the Bond babe quotient.

 On Sunday the 17th, the diabolical SPECTRE is back as it hijacks a Nato plane and seizes two atomic warheads in Thunderball. Bond jumps into action and comes up against Emilio Largo (Adolfo Celi), a high-ranking agent of SPECTRE. For the flesh factor, there?s the stunning Domino (Claudine Auger). It is time for The Man With The Golden Gun on October 24, with Roger Moore on the trail of the missing Solex Agitator, a device to harness the sun?s radiation and give awesome powers to the possessor. Bond does meet his match in the incredible Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee), an assassin with a distinctive golden gun. Also stealing the thunder is the exotic Andrea Anders (Maud Adams) and the sensuous Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland). 

 Finally, the last Sunday of October is For Your Eyes Only. After a ship sinks off the coast of Albania, Bond has to retrieve the powerful ATAC system. If there?s the suave Kristatos (Julian Glover) to contain, there?s the beautiful Melina Havelock (Caroline Bouquet) to cavort. So, all October, Bond with the best on Sunday evenings at 8 pm.

Julianne Moore: Forget-me-not

 Ever since Boogie Nights, Julianne Moore has been billed ?the next big thing? in Hollywood and when she took over from Jodie Foster as Clarice Sterling, there was more sound than silence. And the Hannibal beauty has just gone from strength to strength. After delivering a bravura performance in art-house hits like The End Of The Affair and The Hours, Moore has proved that she can carry a mainstream blockbuster on her own with the supernatural thriller The Forgotten grabbing top spot in North America last weekend.

 Moore plays a distraught mother who sets out to unveil a mystery regarding her son, even as she is constantly reminded that for eight years she has been imagining that she has a son. The film, which cost about $40 million, should end up raking in a neat $60 million in North America. After this, Moore has a couple of more interesting films in her kitty, including the 2005 release Freedomland co-starring Morgan Freeman, where a single mother blames an Afro-American man for the kidnapping of her son, creating a racial controversy.

 For the time being, you can have your dose of ma?m Moore on the telly with Star Movies showing The Lost World: Jurassic Park on Sunday at 9 pm. The Steven Spielberg sequel to the blockbuster has Moore playing palaeontologist Sarah Harding, opposite Jeff Goldblum.

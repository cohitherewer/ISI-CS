The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cell swipe to riches

 KINSUK BASU

 Struggling through the sea of humanity at a puja pandal, if you have been struck by the handsome face behind you, watch out. A few minutes later, your mobile set could be missing. These are the new-age pickpockets who are on the prowl across the city this year.

 Their areas of operation are from Entally to Minto Park, Taratala to Behala, Howrah station to Brabourne Road and Ultadanga bridge to Lake Town. 

 Detectives this year have stumbled upon pickpockets who?d take anyone by surprise. For instance, Amit Dey, 19, from Nandalal Bose Street, in Shyampukur, was recently arrested on the charge of lifting cell phones from handbags. 

 A Class X student of a reputed north Calcutta school, handsome Amit followed women. ?For the past few weeks, the young man with chocolate cream looks would walk close to women, confident that even if he moved up close, not many would mind. He would then open their handbags and lift their mobile phones,? claimed an officer of the detective department?s Watch section. 

 Amit was influenced by a few acquaintances from Bagbazar, who told him that that was the best way of earning a fast buck.

 They were not wrong. Police claim that most pickpockets operating across the city have their eyes on mobile sets because of the handsome returns they fetch. 

 ?Stealing does not always mean good money. There is a chance factor which doesn?t apply for mobile sets. Besides, with many people carrying these in their shirt pockets and even inside their kurta pockets, lifters were finding it easy,? said a senior officer from the crime branch. 

 The Metro is a favourite haunt of mobile lifters. Commuters are most vulnerable while getting on or off. 

 Stolen sets are sold off either to the local mobile phone-repairing shops or to the fledgling second-hand markets across parts of the city in Kidderpore or Chandni Chowk for anything between Rs 800 and Rs 1,200, depending on the make.

 The problem became so acute that on October 1, city police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty sent a telex message to all divisional deputy commissioners of police, asking them to crack down on such pickpockets operating across the city. 

 Later, at the co-ordination meetings held for each division, Chakraborty reiterated his thrust on cracking down on lifters.

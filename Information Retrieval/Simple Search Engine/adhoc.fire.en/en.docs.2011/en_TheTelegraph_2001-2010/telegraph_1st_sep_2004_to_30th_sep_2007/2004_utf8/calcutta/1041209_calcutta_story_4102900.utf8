 Post-surgery healthcare now at home 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 ?A few days after being discharged, I called up the hospital to find out the dates on which I have to go back for follow-up and to get the stitches removed. I was pleasantly surprised when I was told that a medical team would, instead, visit my house and conduct the necessary checks.?

 D.K. Sengupta is presently recuperating at his residence from a bypass surgery he underwent on November 4. Like several other patients, he has nurses from the hospital at his bedside to take care of him. 

 In a city notorious for shoddy healthcare, a novel initiative to alleviate the sufferings of the ailing has just got underway, and it promises to reach the doorstep of every Calcuttan in the near future.

 A pilot project to improve the quality of healthcare by despatching a medical team to the homes of patients who have undergone surgery has, so far, shown remarkable results. If things work out well, patients, especially those who are immobile or aged, will no longer have to rush to hospitals for every medical need.

 ?We have got wonderful feedback from patients. Two nurses and a few trainees have been travelling to the homes of patients who have been released from the hospital after surgery. A total check-up of the patients is carried out at their residences and a feedback forwarded to doctors for follow-up,? explained Amit De, administrator of BM Birla Heart Research Centre, where the project has been started. 

 ?The idea is to change the quality of healthcare in Calcutta and reach out to the people,? added administrator De, who is also secretary of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI).

 The AHEI is, in fact, keen to extend the scope of the project to the homes of sick and aged people who cannot travel to hospitals for treatment.

 ?We always discuss ways to improve the healthcare conditions in the city. What our member-hospital BM Birla has achieved has shown us the way forward,? said Sajal Dutta, president of the AHEI. 

 Among those elated by the service rendered by the hospital is Subir Sen, father of ex-Miss Universe and actress Sushmita Sen. 

 He underwent a bypass surgery on November 15. ?The nurses have been visiting me once a week and are carrying out the check-ups. My queries have been answered and I am very satisfied with the service,? said Sen.

 Pulakesh Banerjee is another patient who has benefited from the service. ?I have no complaints at all. I never thought healthcare could scale such levels in the city,? he enthused.

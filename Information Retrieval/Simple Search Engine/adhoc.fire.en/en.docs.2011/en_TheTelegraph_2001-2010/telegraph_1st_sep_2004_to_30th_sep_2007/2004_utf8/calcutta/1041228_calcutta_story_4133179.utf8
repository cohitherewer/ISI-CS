 The chill factor has just about started settling in and that gives you a genuine excuse to go on a winter shopping binge. If you want to flaunt the leather look this season, the options are many ? from jackets and tops to trousers and skirts in various shapes. While the malls will offer you the staple variety, to make a statement with leather party wear get yourself some designer labels. D?Studio, a boutique by designer Jyoti Khaitan, might be worth a check out.

 Jyoti has launched a line for the winter party season that comprises stylish leather jackets and skirts. There are snakeskin-look leather jackets and A-line slit skirts embellished with metal studs, metallic buttons, beads and stones. The jackets are fitted at the waist, giving them a slim and feminine look, and have patchwork pockets on them. The skirts have metal rings running along the slits. 

 so on offer is a range of form-hugging blazers with similar embellishments. While the jackets come in black, brown and green, the dominant colours for the line are purple and black.

 ?The focus of my New Year collection is on textiles. The fabrics for the blazers and the leather for the jackets and skirts are so rich themselves that I didn?t use any embroidery or sequins to garnish them,? says Jyoti.

 The skirts range between Rs 1,900 and Rs 2,500, while the jackets and blazers can be picked up for anything between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,500 from d? Studio at 52/2 Ballygunge Circular Road.

 Label luxury

 While on the hunt for designer tags, Ekru, the lifestyle store at 1 /4 Rowland Row, could be a worthy style stop. The four-year-old boutique owned by Ekta Jaipuria and Ruchira Kandhari is showcasing pret collections of some of Lakme India Fashion Week 2004?s biggies. 

 Party picks and cool casuals by Suneet Verma, Malini Ramani, Monisha Bajaj, Priya Awasty, Sonali Mansingka and Nikki Mahajan can be picked off the racks.

 Suneet Verma?s diffusion line, He Spice, presents lively garments ? white shirts with fluorescent trimmings, asymmetrical skirts with flowing ruffles, capris and trousers with floral prints. Malini Ramani?s collection is full of glitzy T-shirts with bohemian motifs and embroidery. Bohemia also highlights Monisha Bajaj?s range with tie-and-dye kurtas teamed with crushed skirts and linen trousers. Priya Awasty has treaded traditional territory with kantha on shirts, skirts and trousers and printed ponchos. Sonali Mansingka?s casual yet gorgeous range has kitschy T-shirts with brocade patchwork and cowl-neck silk tops with knitted trimmings. Ponchos, the latest rage, with refreshing prints and sequins dominate Nikki Mahajan?s line.

 Ekru?s in-house ensembles share rack space with the design honchos. Called Diffusion, the collection is a mix and match line. There are crushed skirts with ethnic belts and mirror work, T-shirts, kurtas and ponchos. The kurtas can be paired with skirts, trousers, patialas, harem pants or dhoti salwars. 

 Design debut

 There?s a brand new name on the boutique block and behind it is a young talent out to prove her mettle in the world of fashion. Nafeesa Salaam, a student of National Institute of Fashion Technology, opened her studio called Nafeesa?s Creations in Park Circus recently.

 The young designer has an array of outfits in her kitty ? bridal lehngas, saris, salwar suits, kurtis, skirts and evening gowns. While she does the bridal lehngas only on order, keeping in mind the ?theme of a wedding?, the rest can be picked off the racks at her boutique at 287 Darga Road. ?I would like to specialise in bridal wear. It will be exclusive, each piece tailor-made for each bride, taking into account her specific requirements,? says the young designer.

 Nafeesa?s forte is antique metallic work, which she uses to embellish the garments, combined with other forms of embroidery and prints. The palette at the moment includes bright hues of blue, pink, yellow ochre and black. The fabrics she has used are crepe, dupion, raw silk, pure silk and georgette.

 Especially for New Year, Nafeesa has designed a limited line of evening gowns in black and silver. One can also get gowns made to order here. A selection of tapered skirts, priced at around Rs 900, is her other offering for the party season.

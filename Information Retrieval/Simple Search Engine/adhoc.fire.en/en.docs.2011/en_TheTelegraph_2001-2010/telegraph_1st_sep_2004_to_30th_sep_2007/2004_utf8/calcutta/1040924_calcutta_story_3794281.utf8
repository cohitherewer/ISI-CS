The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Optimism as agents forge Agenda East 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The focus has shifted to the east after nearly a decade, and how. The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) annual convention is back in Calcutta after nine years, with the idea of promoting Bengal and the Northeast as potential hubs of tourism. A day before the inauguration on September 24, Balbir Mayal, TAAI president, elaborated on the agenda.

 The recent ruckus between travel agents and European airlines (?amicably sorted out?), improved infrastructure, attracting foreign tourists to India, marketing the product and branching out from leisure tourism will all be discussed.

 ?After several years, the number of foreign tourists to India went up from about 2.5 million to three million in 2003. Till July this year, the figure stands at 2.4 million, so we expect another 25 per cent rise. The season is just starting and we should have about 3.5 million by year-end,? said Mayal.

 Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Southeast Asia top the list on the inbound tourist list. ?We have no problem getting travellers here, but there isn?t the infrastructure to cope with them. We want a commitment from the government on a list of things, including budget hotels, road and rail connectivity and open skies,? he added.

 The 2,000-strong travel body has found a sympathetic ear in tourism minister Renuka Chowdhury, who will also be attending the convention. 

 ?We have talked to her about fiscal incentives for hotels and other issues, and she is positive. There are about 1.2 lakh hotel rooms in India today. In one city in the US, there is more than that number. Hotels have to reduce rates, too.? 

 The short-term solution: explore other areas, like pilgrim, adventure and rural tourism, which ?do no require the same amenities?. 

 Flights, or lack thereof, remains a problem, especially in Calcutta, where airlines are pulling out and there just aren?t enough. ?When the national carriers don?t make any move, other national airlines should be encouraged to spread out. Also, there are only about 40 fully-functional airports in India, and around 15 international ones. Mumbai and Delhi are saturated. We need to expand,? Mayal stressed.

 The government, however, is finally taking note of the potential of the tourism trade. 

 The Planning Commission, with Montek Singh Ahluwalia as deputy chairman, has, for the first time, formed an advisory board on travel and tourism. Mayal, representing TAAI, will attend the first meeting next month.

 Exorcist: Scary saga

Flashing back to fear

It became a cult film, sparking mass hysteria and 

scaring the nightlights out of non-believers. The Exorcist has since been 

deemed as one of the scariest movies of all time, grossing over $165 million since 

its release in 1973. What made the film even more successful, apart from all the 

Academy Awards, was author William Blatty?s claims that it was based on a true 

story. 

 What remains undisputed is that in the 1940s-50s, there was a 13-year-old boy in the Washington DC area (the exact location is murky) who went through some sort of ?experience?. Whether it was of the paranormal or psychological kind remains a mystery, but priests were involved and there was an exorcism. And so an urban legend was born.

 A prequel to the original, The Exorcist: The Beginning, is on the big screen, ready to dare and scare the public all over again. The reviews aren?t great, but the fright factor is there for anyone brave enough to venture a viewing. 

 In the film, Father Lankester Merrin is pictured in post-World War II Africa, where he first met evil in the form of Pazuzu. It stars Stellan Skarsgard, more famous as the Harvard math professor in Good Will Hunting. Skarsgard is also in theatres with King Arthur. 

 The behind-the-scenes tales during the making of the first film made headlines, with stories of strange goings-on like sets burning down and nine people dying while it was being made. This time too, there are cryptic notes, like John Frankenheimer, originally chosen to direct it, dying in 2002. 

 When the film was made by Paul Schrader, it was rejected by Morgan Creek and remade by Renny Harlin, who was knocked down by a car in Rome and hospitalised for two weeks during shooting. But the film has been released and rumours suggest that Morgan Creek plans to release Schrader?s version on DVD soon. 

If you?re a horror flick fan, then check it out. A 

word of warning though: it?s definitely not for everyone.

 Brandon Routh: Super start

A hero is born

 It?s a bird, it?s a plane, it?s Brandon Routh. Only days after the news of Christopher Reeve?s death, a little cheer for Superman fans came with Warner Brothers? announcement of finalising Routh for the lead role in the next Superman movie.

 But just who is Brandon Routh? The 6 ft 2 inch 25-year old from Iowa is a virtually unknown small-screen actor who was chosen after an exhaustive search across the US, Canada, UK and Australia. Routh has only just finished work on his first feature film, the upcoming Deadly, opposite Laura Prepon, while his television credits include One Life to Live, Gilmore Girls, Will amp; Grace, and Cold Case.

 The Superman movie remains untitled, though Superman Returns, Superman Reborn and Superman Lives are doing the rounds as the possible titles.

 McG, the director of the Charlie?s Angels series, was initially roped in for the project, but after he walked out, the director?s mantle finally fell on Bryan Singer. The screenplay honours are shared between Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. Filming begins in Australia early next year and the release date is pegged at summer 2006.

 Singer was reportedly looking for an unknown actor to cast in the role of Superman, and felt Routh not only ?matched the physical qualifications of Clark Kent/Superman?, but also ?embodied the legacy and history of the character?.

 According to initial reports, the film will take a fresh look at the Superman saga, capturing baby Kal-El?s journey from the doomed planet of Krypton to earth and his growing up to become one of its greatest superheroes.

Stars small and big ? from Brendan Fraser and Asthon 

Kutcher to Nicolas Cage ? have been linked with Superman, but it seems the red-and-gold 

cape was meant only for Routh.

 Shah Rukh: A man of word

Sweet talk

 In an industry where people make sure that they never keep their word and walk out of movies midway, Bollywood?s badshah Shah Rukh Khan keeps his old promises. 

 Five years back when film critic and television presenter Samar Khan told Shah Rukh that he would make a film some day, King Khan said he would definitely be a part of the project. So when recently, Samar did embark on his dream film, SRK didn?t shy away.

 The film is called Kuch Meetha Ho Jaaye and is shot throughout in an airport. This small little piece of information has made the entire industry believe that it is a remake of Steven Spielberg?s Tom Hanks-starrer The Terminal. 

 Samar obviously feels otherwise. He is currently shooting in Malaysia with a new set of actors and Mahima Chaudhury in a significant role.

 While Shah Rukh doesn?t obviously play the lead in the film, he does make an extended guest appearance in Kuch Meetha Ho Jaaye. 

 Isn?t that real sweet of Khan saab?

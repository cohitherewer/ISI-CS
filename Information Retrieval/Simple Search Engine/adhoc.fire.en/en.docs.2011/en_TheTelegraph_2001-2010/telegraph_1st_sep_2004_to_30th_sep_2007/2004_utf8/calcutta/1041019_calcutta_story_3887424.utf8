 Library gets job nod

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After 17 years, the Centre has allowed the National Library to recruit 11 employees in various categories to enable it to provide better services to the readers. Sources said 172 posts at the library have been lying vacant since 1987.

 For want of adequate staff, including officers, a number of key departments are lying closed or non-functional.

 The doors of the exhibition section, at the main building, have been locked for a long time, while the bibliography (special) department remains unmanned.

 Work at the Kashmiri department is being hampered as the only language expert posted there has been transferred to the stack department. The French department, too, has to do without an expert. 

 Earlier, the stock verification unit had 21 employees. Now, it?s being manned by only two.

 Library director Sudhendu Mandal said he had received a letter from the Union ministry of culture, sanctioning 11 posts. 

 ?The ministry has cleared three posts of assistant library and information officer, five posts of library information assistants, two posts of library clerks and one post of assistant security officer,? Mandal elaborated.

 ?The ministry has also given me a free hand in recruiting people to these posts. I am sure this decision of the ministry will help us provide better services to our readers and scholars,? he added.

 In 1987, the library had 781 sanctioned posts. But the Centre, as part of a cost-cut exercise, curtailed 10 per cent of the posts. 

 Currently, the library has only 530 employees. 

 When Union culture minister S. Jaipal Reddy visited the library on October 8, the National Library Staff Association had submitted a memorandum, pleading for measures to fill up the vacant posts.

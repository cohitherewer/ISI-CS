The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 One dais for bands Bangla

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Top bands from the two Banglas are banding together to rock Calcutta. 

 On October 1, Salt Lake stadium will be set for Bangladeshi bands Miles and LRB, and the city?s own Chandrabindoo and Cactus, for a one-of-its-kind soiree. 

 Sharing the stage with the neighbouring melody makers with his foot-tapping beats will be tabla player Bikram Ghosh.

 ?People have seen the bands perform in functions and fests, but never together. So, we thought of hosting a show where we can bring the two Banglas on a common platform,? said Soumen Pal, of Idea Management, the company organising the show. 

 The fusion gig kicks off with Bikram?s Rhythmscape performing a couple of tracks before Chandrabindoo takes the stage to belt out some of its popular numbers. 

 Then comes Cactus, with its share of hits, including Mon from Nil Nirjane.

 ?I will perform two tracks, Dance of Shiva and Zinc, from my old set,? said Bikram, who has been roped in to jazz up the act with his percussions.

 Once the local bands wind up, the Miles boys will take over with their chart-busting Phiriye dao track (made more famous by the Mahesh Bhatt-Murder controversy). LRB will follow up with Ghumonto shahare rupali raate and O bondhu tomay jokhoni.

 A jamming session involving the bands and Bikram is likely to be the icing on the cake for the crowd. 

 ?Music-lovers in Calcutta seldom get to see top bands together and, hence, the decision to introduce a jamming session with all the bands,? Pal added.

 Starting at 5 pm, the soiree will stretch late into the night, added the organisers. To help the audiences, Calcutta Police are drawing up adequate security arrangements.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fare hike signal to cut Metro losses

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Metro Railway, just past its 20th birthday but yet to break even, is planning a fare revision to make up for its losses, R. Velu, minister of state for railways, said on Tuesday.

 On a two-day visit to the city, Velu ordered a survey of the passenger volume, peak hour and off-peak movement of trains and revenues. The findings, he said, would decide the fare hike.

 ?Calcutta Metro Railway is running at a loss and I have asked the authorities to conduct a survey. We must know how much of the present loses can be covered if there is a fare hike of 50 p to Re 1,? said Velu.

 The minister also announced plans to increase the number of trains and reduce the 10-minute gap.

 ?We will send all the findings to the railway board which would then fix the fare revision,? said Vinod Kumar Sharma, general manager, Metro Railway.

 The present fare structure is Rs 4 for the first stage, Rs 6 for second and Rs 8 for the third stage. From its commissioning on October 24, 1984, the Metro fares have been revised twice, with the last hike (of Re 1) dating back to October 2001.

 Metro Rail officials pegged earnings from ticket sales, excluding surcharges, at Rs 38.54 crore for 2003-04. In this financial year, the earnings till September have been Rs 19.79 crore. More than 2.75 lakh passengers use the Metro every day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Norms stricter for Kali puja

BAREN SEN, director of West Bengal Fire Services, met readers 

of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries Participants included Sandip 

Banerjee, S.H. Khan, Saibal Chakrabarty, Sailen Bhattacharjee, Arup Roy and Anver 

Kamal Siddique

S.H. Khan: How can one lodge a complaint against puja organisers 

for violating fire protection norms? Is the procedure for lodging complaints the 

same for residential buildings?

 In case of puja pandals, after issuing the necessary clearances, we generally start an inspection drive to check if the puja organisers are following the fire safety instructions. Mobile inspectors visit each pandal and check out their fire safety measures. Generally, we are more stringent in enforcing fire safety measures during Kali puja than during Durga puja.

 Last year, nearly 15 pandals across the state were gutted during Durga puja and Kali puja, while several others were partially damaged by fire. If you feel that a puja organiser is violating the fire safety norms and thus endangering the neighbourhood, you may inform us about it in writing. We will definitely inspect the site. If we find it unsafe, we will either, with the help of police, stop the puja or force the organisers to make the necessary fire safety arrangements. But a written complaint is essential.

In case of buildings other than residential ones, 

it is mandatory to obtain a clearance from the local fire office before carrying 

out construction. In case of residential buildings, if they are above 14.5 m in 

height, one has to apply to us for a clearance certificate. We inspect the building 

before issuing a clearance. During construction of a housing complex, it is obligatory 

for the developers to obtain a clearance from the fire department, irrespective 

of the height of the buildings.

Anver Kamal Siddique: You always speak of enforcing 

fire safety measures in high-rises. But arent fire safety rules applicable 

in slums as well?

It has to be kept in mind that we are basically a 

fire-fighting force and not an agency to prevent fires. But the situation is changing 

fast, and thus, we have to look at that aspect also. If the slums come up illegally, 

we cannot approach them to ensure fire safety measures. If a fire breaks out in 

a slum and the slum-dwellers are found guilty after investigation, we will initiate 

legal action against them. On the other hand, since the high-rises are expected 

to have legal sanction from the civic bodies, it is our duty to ensure that they 

do not violate fire safety rules.

Sandip Banerjee: If you find that some buildings 

are encroaching on road space, thus preventing fire tenders from entering the 

lanes, can you take action against the owners?

We can definitely take action if we find that a building 

is encroaching on the road and may obstruct the path of fire tenders. In fact, 

this comes under the purview of the fire safety laws which are in tune with the 

building and city-planing laws. But as I said earlier, we can take stringent action 

in such a situation only after we get a written complaint from a person residing 

in the area. 

Arup Roy: Recently, the fire department had issued 

an instruction to fire-proof puja pandals by using certain chemicals. Have you 

ever looked into the quality of materials used in the pandals?

 The main objective behind issuing the instruction was to create awareness among the puja organisers. During last year?s pujas, we sent teams to several pandals and penalised organisers for violating our instructions. The campaign helped a great deal in bringing down incidences of fire in pandals. The organisers had even started keeping extinguishers in the pandals.

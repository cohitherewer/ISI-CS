No-frills flavour

Himika Chaudhuri explores the minimalism 

mantra thats now a dominant theme in home interiors

Glimpses

From top:

 Entrepreneurs Komal and Ratul Sood?s residence 

near Ballygunge Phari epitomises the minimalist look. The living room has a wall-mounted 

plasma TV and little furniture

 The spacious dining area has a glass-topped table with chairs that boast 

a straight-line feel

 The house is mostly done up in metal, glass and light wood, as is seen 

in the staircase leading to the first floor

Less is more isn?t a mantra confined to the costume 

cupboards of Bollywood?s steamy sirens. It has been the buzzword in the world 

of interior design for some time now. The minimalist look has been quietly taking 

control of home design everywhere.

?In other words, this is a no-fuss kind of look,? 

explains Gopa Ray, an interior designer with the Taj Group of Hotels. In practical 

terms, this implies an understated chic, with just enough furniture to sit, eat 

and sleep on.

It is not just about limiting furniture either. The 

principle of minimalism in interiors extends to the bigger picture of design and 

d?cor.

?The minimalist look is meant to give a sense of space 

to the room,? adds Ray. ?In a minimalist drawing room, there wouldn?t be a huge 

wooden cabinet for an ungainly home-theatre system. A wall-mounted plasma screen 

or a TV set on a see-through glass-top table would be more like it.?

There is, however, some confusion about what the term 

means. ?Most people use the word minimalist without understanding what it means. 

It is relative, and can be achieved with the right arrangement of furniture,? 

feels Sheena Rawla, owner of Cocoon, a furniture shop.

Linear look

Neat, clean, no nonsense. ?Minimalist furniture has 

to be built in straight lines. Elaborate curves and carvings are a no-no,? explains 

Jayjit Sen, an exporter of Indian furniture. While white wood, metal and glass 

are the favoured materials, furniture in brown wood, with clean lines, is also 

not a bad idea.

?Metal, glass and white wood give the furniture a 

light-weight look which dark wood usually does not offer. But it doesn?t mean 

that a few dark pieces can?t be thrown in,? feels Sen.

Colour comfort

Since the furniture is scant and utilitarian, one 

should feel free to play with colours to jazz things up. Bright hues on the walls 

and in the choice of linen and wall hangings can add warmth to the environment.

?One can choose from pastels or bright colours, depending 

on personal tastes. There are no strictures with regard to the fabric that can 

be used for upholstery. Plain cottons, jute, linen? Just about anything can be 

used,? adds Ray.

When it comes to the curtains, experts feel more caution 

is required. They suggest avoiding printed fabrics. Bold single-coloured or striped 

fabrics are more like it, fitting in with the geometric look of the room. But 

if the occupant wants to show off one dramatic piece, maybe a carpet or cushions, 

it can be done without upsetting the theme.

The walls are important tools to give the room a happy 

feel. ?Texturising the walls, instead of a straight coat of paint, is one option,? 

recommends Rawla. Or, in keeping with the current trend, try contrasting shades 

on the walls instead of one uniform colour.

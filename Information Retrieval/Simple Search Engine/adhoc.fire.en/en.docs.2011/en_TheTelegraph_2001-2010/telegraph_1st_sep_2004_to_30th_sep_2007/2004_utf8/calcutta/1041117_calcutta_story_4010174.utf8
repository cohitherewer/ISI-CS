 Empowering the oppressed

 Forum Theatre as a dramatic genre has treaded a long and arduous journey since its inception in Brazil three decades ago. Celebrating the empowerment and emancipation of the oppressed classes that finds expression in this form of theatre, Jana Sanskriti hosts Muktadhara: A Forum Theatre Festival, a five-day event featuring discussions, workshops by theatre personalities from India and abroad and plays performed by its theatre teams from all over the country. The inaugural performance, Gnayer Panchali, is a collage of the everyday experiences of the poor people of rural Bengal. Based on facts, it comprises episodes that depict different forms of oppression of the rural masses, with political leaders, government doctors and landowners being the oppressors. Folk tunes and the use of lathi as a stage device provide dramatic intensity to this play which highlights real, social problems. Performed by the residents of a Delhi slum, Laadli Hamari, the evening?s second play, is concerned with bringing to light the oppression of women in different stages of their lives.

 Event: Gnayer Panchali (Bengali) and Laadli Hamari (Hindi); plays by Jana Sanskriti

 When: Today; 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Laalan Mancha (near Esplanade tram depot)

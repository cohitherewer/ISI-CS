The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without

Getting started with Puja shopping

The pre-Puja shopping spree never quite loses its charm. The time when the four 

days of Durga Puja (and Diwali of course) was the best excuse for a wardrobe overhaul 

may be as out of style as tapered jeans, with shopping going on through the year, 

but a few presents for yourself and others are a must. City retail outlets 

are also getting ready for the major mayhem. Girls can have a blast at Pantaloons, 

where a promotion just for the ladies is underway.

Catching the Ritu show

Bridal Asia may not be coming to the city, but there is some good news for all 

those getting ready to tie the knot. September 10 will see design diva Ritu Kumars 

winter collection unveiled at Taj Bengal. This is the perfect excuse to pamper 

yourself with one of the trademark lehngas from the queen of bridal wear, 

which will form a part of her couture collection. The more trendy types can turn 

their attention to her chic pret line called Label.

Purring about Puss In Boots

Never was there a cuter cat than Puss in Shrek 2. Antonio Banderas is brilliant 

as the voice of the killer cat with a Latin twang, the best thing in the film 

(besides Pinocchio in ladies underwear, of course). Let not the Zorro 

parody element escape you, either.

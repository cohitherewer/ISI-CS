Classics revisited

LIFESTYLE LINES

While there are scores of decent movie guides available 

in the market, finding one that categorises films according to quality is more 

complicated. Who is choosing the films, and how are you to know whether the critic?s 

taste is reliable or likely to coincide with your own way of looking at things?

The Great Movies (Broadway Books, 2002, Rs 

1,175) is a comparatively risk-free choice. First of all, its author is the Pulitzer 

Prize-winning critic Roger Ebert, a veteran with years of experience behind him. 

And secondly, in The Great Movies, Ebert has assembled 100 classics that 

are on everyone?s must-watch list.

It cuts across genres to include only the best through 

the ages. There are few films from the last two decades and Ebert makes no secret 

his preference for the old masters. Sixty of the films are in black and white. 

?Today, even the most popular subtitled films are ignored by the national distribution 

oligarchy, mainstream movies are pitched at the teenage male demographic group, 

and the lines outside theatres are for Hollywood?s new specialty, B movies with 

A budgets,? he writes in his introduction.

The list isn?t likely to disappoint anyone. 2001: 

A Space Odyssey, The 400 Blows, All About Eve, Apocalypse 

Now, the Apu Trilogy, Battleship Potempkin, The Bicycle Thief, 

Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Fargo, The Godfather, Gone 

with the Wind (still from the film below), Lawrence of Arabia, Psycho, 

Pulp Fiction, Un Chien Andalou, The Wizard of Oz? The hits 

just keep on coming.

?We live in a box of space and time. Movies are windows 

in its walls.? Ebert makes for not only entertaining reading, his passion and 

dedication to the craft shines through with every word, urging you to revisit 

classics in an age where even film students are losing touch.

The collection comprises revised reviews written for 

a weekly column in the Chicago Sun Times concentrating on the classics. 

Ebert applauds his editor for giving him the freedom not to indulge in journalism?s 

?bottom-feeding? obsession with box-office results and celebrity news.

The accompanying stills have been chosen by Mary Corliss, 

assistant curator, Museum of Modern Art.

In case you don?t want to pay up for the book, you 

can log into Roger Ebert?s writing. Just key in www.rogerebert.com on your 

browser. It will take you to the Chicago Sun Times site that gives you 

all his reviews, including recent additions to the great movies list. Enjoy, and 

then kick yourself for not having a job as fun as his.

 Trader shot dead on Setu, Rs 4 lakh snatched

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A gang of five shot dead a businessman after snatching Rs 4 lakh from him and one of his employees on the Vidyasagar Setu approach on Tuesday morning.

 The shock attack took place at 10 am at Mandirtala, in the Shibpur police station area.

 Sekhar Roy, 45, died on the spot after being shot from point-blank range. Narayan Khatua, who was carrying the money in a bag, was critically injured.

 According to police, Roy was killed for the money that he was to deposit in a nationalised bank in Burrabazar.

 ?No one has been arrested. We are trying to identify the assailants,? said Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, superintendent of Howrah police.

 Inquiries revealed that Roy ? a dealer in Hutch, Pepsi and Hindustan Lever products ? collected the cash from his mobile distribution centre near Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur.

 Roy and Khatua, who works at the distribution centre, were proceeding towards the toll plaza of Vidyasagar Setu on a motorcycle.

 As they went past the Mandirtala crossing on Howrah-Andul Road, the assailants, on three motorcycles, attacked them.

 They first rammed their vehicles into Roy?s, throwing off the trader and his employee. As the two lay writhing in pain, the gang snatched the cash bag from Khatua. Roy hauled himself up and tried to strike back at the assailants. Taken aback by his attack, they shot him.

 Two Railway Protection Force personnel spotted Roy lying on the road bleeding while Khatua cried for help. They took the two to a nursing home, where Roy was declared dead.

 Khatua was admitted, but later released after treatment. Police interrogated him throughout the day.

 During the grilling, he told police that the road was deserted when the attack took place.

 ?Roy usually took his car while going to office in Rajakatra, Burrabazar. But for the past two days, he had been riding his motorcycle,? said superintendent of police Bhattacharya. 

 ?The timing of the attack proves that the criminals were keeping a close watch on Roy?s movements,? he added.

 The sleuths are also trying to find out whether Roy?s business associates or friends were involved in the Tuesday attack.

 ?Although it seems the murder was for money, we are not ruling out other options. We are trying to find out whether any business rivalry was behind the killing, or whether Roy had any enemies,? said a senior police official. 

 Police has launched a combing operation in the area. An alert has been sounded at various police stations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Music maker sings umpire?s testing tune

Super-singer status doesnt come easy, 

found Pratim D. Gupta, having witnessed a stressful competition in town

 Facing the third umpire is always the toughest task on the cricket field. With every pair of eyes transfixed on the red-green lights, seconds become hours as the verdict closes in. At the Samsung [V] Super Singer auditions, one-man jury Adnan Sami doesn?t refer to third umpires ? he chooses the colour himself and that too in seconds. If it?s green, you stay on to face more music and if it?s red, it?s time to wait for another talent hunt show. The Calcutta auditions at the Hyatt Regency through Tuesday had all the ingredients of a typical Bollywood potboiler ? ups, downs and everything in between.

You are in queue

 From five in the morning, guys and gals came in droves to try their luck. To the innocuous onlooker, it may have seemed like the Hyatt staff had gone on strike. As the day wore on, the queues got longer and the faces a tad anxious. They all had one question to ask ? will we get to sing in front of Adnan at all? There were some grumbles thrown in as well. ?They said first-come-first-sing, but we are here from dawn and still standing,? one of the contenders complained. 

The Calcutta turnout was still way short of the Delhi 

juggernaut, which saw a record participation at the very start of the talent hunt 

contest. But for those who made it here, it is on to stage two ? the zonal round. 

Like G. Rahul, one of the contestants who has been captured below through stages 

of the nail-biting competition ? from wait to audition to win (pictures by Pradip 

Sanyal).

Song stress

 Once through the Hyatt gates, it was all about filling up a registration form and accepting the rules and regulations laid down to become a ?super singer?. With the paperwork taken care of and the unique identity card around the neck it was time to get into the crooning mould.

 But all those late-night practices on the eve of the contest were thrown out of the window straightaway. You could not exactly march in and sing your favourite number. One had to choose from a handful of songs personally picked by Adnan (seen in picture above with VJ Gaurav). To make matters less messy, the lyrics were provided at the registration counter. 

One-upmanship

 As the guys went Kal ho naa ho? and the girls replied Kuch to hua hai? the waiting lounge at the Hyatt was quickly transformed into a rehearsal room by the contestants.

 With Adnan?s own hits Kabhi to nazar milao, Kabhi nahin and Nain se nain on the list, the music maker wannabes weren?t really spoilt for choice. The ambitious ones went for Tu hi re and Rainaa beeti jaaye but the most popular choice was Ankhiyaan milaoon.

Sober as a judge

 A special couch, a cup of hot coffee (refilled every other minute) and a whole lot of patience ? Adnan Sami confessed he has become ?mature? as a judge.

 ?I am just looking for a singer who can melt everyone?s hearts,? said the man who has done just that himself for the past few years. Dismissing the ?look factor?, which the other talent hunts are stressing on, as ?cosmetic beauty?, Adnan confessed that he has a lot of expectations from the Calcutta crooners because of ?the tremendous culture and tradition? that the city is known for.

 The best part about the man was the way he guided every contestant before pressing the judgement button ? from the worst bathroom singer to the best talent on offer.

l or nothing

 It was a day filled with heartbreak (as usual, mainly taking the form of teary-eyed consoling parents) and punctuated by surprise success stories. Some dreams remained dreams while others grew bigger. ?It wasn?t my day,? said one. ?I didn?t get a fair deal,? said another, choosing to play the blame game. Anguish and agony, excitement and ecstasy, the talent hunt was a display of the myriad moods of creative souls.

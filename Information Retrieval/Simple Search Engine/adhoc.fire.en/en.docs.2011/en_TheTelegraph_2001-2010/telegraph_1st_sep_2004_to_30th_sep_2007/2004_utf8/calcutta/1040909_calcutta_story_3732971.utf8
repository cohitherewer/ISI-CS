 An ailing mate has visitors

 - Pack of six drops by every afternoon on langur in hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Six mates of a stray langur, caught for treatment, have been regular visitors at an animal hospital in Behala for the past 10 days. The langur is undergoing cosmetic surgery for a wound in his neck.

 The six females have been dropping by every afternoon, between 2 pm and 5 pm. They perch themselves on the roof of the hospital, in which their mate is confined in a ?cabin?.

 However, instead of a ransack spree or an attempt to break open the cabin grille, the six go to the window, extend their paws through the grille and caress their mate. 

 The visit lasts for about 15 minutes, and then they disperse peacefully.

 The surgery was conducted on the langur?s neck by veterinary surgeon Shyamal Guha on Saturday in the hospital for strays, run by Love-N-Care for Animals.

 As the wound has started healing, the doctors plan to release the langur this weekend.

 Recounting how the langur was caught, Love-N-Care for Animals secretary Sushmita Roy said: ?Two langurs, Raja and Badshah, were rescued from Hooghly more than two years ago. They live in the hospital as permanent inmates in a room on the roof.?

 About 10 days ago, a pack of seven langurs, led by the ailing male, stormed the hospital. They tried to break open the window of the room where the two langurs are lodged. 

 ?While they were ransacking the roof, we noticed a scar on the neck of the male leader. We lassoed him and administered a tranquiliser,? said Roy. 

 Hospital vet Abhijit Saha elaborated: ?We found that the scar had been caused by a nylon rope tied tightly around his neck. The tissues in the area had started decomposing and emitting a foul smell.? 

 The hospital authorities then called in veterinary surgeon Guha to conduct the operation.

 However, this short stay in hospital has brought about an important change in the langur?s food habits, pointed out secretary Roy. 

 For the first few days, he had refused to eat anything other than green vegetables, potatoes and bananas. Now, the langur loves his daily meal of boiled rice.

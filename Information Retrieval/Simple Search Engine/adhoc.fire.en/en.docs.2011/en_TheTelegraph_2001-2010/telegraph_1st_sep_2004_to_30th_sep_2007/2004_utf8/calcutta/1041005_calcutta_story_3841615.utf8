The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bravehearts booked for success

 We shall overcome: Theyre smart, intelligent 

and courageous as hell, going through life with more than their fair share of 

troubles. The ups and downs dont deter these young students, as they beat 

the odds to make their dreams come true. On Monday, The Telegraph Education Foundation 

gave them a reason to smile. Pictures by Rashbehari Das

They are all students, with school and homework dominating 

their young lives, just like any other. But where the problems differ is that 

dilemmas like cramming for an exam versus going out with friends is not on the 

worry list. 

 How to finish studying before daylight runs out, after finishing the daily chores, and getting enough to eat, are the main concerns. The Telegraph Education Foundation?s (TTEF) annual School Awards for Excellence is here again, and in a prelude to the actual event next month, 18 scholarships were given to deserving candidates on Monday morning.

 The event was held at Hariyana Vidya Mandir school, in Salt Lake. In fact, 11 of the 18 scholarships were instituted by the faculty members of the school itself, with teachers pooling their funds to come up with Rs 65,000.

 As the heroic tales of courage and determination spilled out, the applause got louder and the modest awardees humbly walked on to the stage to collect their cheques with a simple ?dhonyobad?. Young Metro salutes the young achievers, as they struggle against all odds to make better lives for themselves and their families.

 Ladies first

 There were only four, but each was worth her weight in platinum. 

Karunamoyee Paul (picture left) is now a first-year 

accounts honours student. The ex-Tiljala Balika Vidyalaya student got 664 in Madhyamik 

and 724 in Higher Secondary (HS) exams. She has three sisters and one brother, 

who live in a mud hut with no electricity in a slum in Picnic Garden. ?My father 

is a graduate. He got into law school, but had to drop out because of financial 

constraints,? she says. On a Rs-1,000 per month salary as a cycle repair mechanic, 

he is determined to educate all his children. 

 nAnother former Tiljala Balika Vidyalaya student who made it to the list was Priti Halder, whose father is a rickshaw-puller and mother a domestic help. Apart from tutoring her two younger sisters (in classes VIII and XI), the BA political science student gives private tuitions to make some pocket money. She hopes to be a journalist soon, although she only has a kerosene lamp to study by.

Sneha Shaw (picture right), a student of Julien Day 

(Ganganagar), scored 524 in her ICSE exam this year. But here?s the real revelation 

? her mother is suffering from breast cancer and her father is unwell, too. 

Last but certainly not the least is Bipasa Basu (picture 

left), a B.Tech student of electronics and communication at Netaji Subhash Engineering 

College. After scoring 81 per cent in HS, with some help from TTEF, she has managed 

to come thus far (?I want to be a researcher some day. But I have to get a job 

and help my family financially, first?). And she?s on the right track, with 78 

and 75 per cent in her first-year exams. Her father has a minimal income from 

a small construction job.

 Boy wonders

They walk through brick walls and hop over obstacles 

that would floor the best of us. And they make it look like it?s just a cakewalk.

Uma Sankar Chakraborty is a Class X student of Mugberia 

Gangadhar High School in East Midnapore school. He scored 92 per cent in his last 

exams. He cycles to school everyday on a bicycle that his uncle gifted him. His 

father is a part-time priest in the village and his mother suffers from chronic 

kidney trouble. His brother, in Class VIII, is as good a student. His sister wasn?t 

able to make the Madhyamik due to appendix trouble just before the exams, but 

Uma Sankar is determined to be on the merit list.

The son of a cleaner and a domestic help, he passed 

this year?s Madhyamik exams with 69.8 per cent. Abhijit Kundu, however, claims 

his brother, in Class VIII, is ?even better? than him, having come first almost 

every year. The boy from Behala is now studying commerce. His father cleans roads, 

toilets, gardens and tanks to come up with about Rs 350 per month. Mother Kalpana, 

whose right eye was ruined due to an illness, says no matter what happens, ?I 

want my children to realise the value of education?.

His father is a muri seller in Champahati bazaar, 

while his mother makes batasha and sandesh at home. During the busy 

season like the Pujas, Gopal Das (picture right) sits in the tiny makeshift shop 

to help out. The total income is about Rs 800 per month. Gopal has to walk about 

35 minutes to school everyday. While his brother, he claims, is ?ektu phankibaaj?, 

his passion for studies is matched only by one other activity ? playing cricket. 

He got 74.5 per cent in Madhyamik 2004.

Munna Shaw lives with his father, a durwan, in a tiny 

hut in Maniktala. He lost his mother, and his brother is back home in Uttar Pradesh. 

He is physically handicapped, with a limp in one leg. It?s a little difficult 

getting to school every day by bus, but if a 78 per cent in Class X is any indication, 

he?s destined to be a topper in Madhyamik 2005 and in life ? with a grin on his 

face.

 Topper talents

There?s very little that can get these fighters 

to back down. They?ve got ambition and now the means to fulfil them.

Subhankar Modak loves math. Numbers are his speciality, 

something that got him a 79.6 per cent in Madhyamik. His father is a daily labourer 

in Ranihati, so there?s not always two square meals a day on the table. But he 

also takes time out to help his two younger brothers, in classes II and IV, to 

study. 

Chiranjit Karmakar?s (picture left) 71 per cent in 

Madhyamik is far more commendable when you consider that his mother works as a 

daily wage-earner in local nursing homes in Baruipur, and that the family of five 

lives in a tiny house. With some financial help from benefactors, he wants to 

be a computer engineer.

Pranab Kumar Bala?s father is a carpenter, and his 

mother is a domestic help. His dream is to be a doctor. But he?s more worried 

about getting a job, with his dada not able to get one despite a BA graduation 

degree. The family of five lives in a one-room home. 

?I can?t even make my son any tiffin when he leaves 

for school, so I just give him about one or two rupees to eat what he can,? says 

mother Sanjita. But Biltu Sardar managed a 61 per cent in Madhyamik. The Class 

XI arts student wants to be a cartographer when he grows up ? maps are his passion. 

He goes to school on a used cycle that his mother bought him. Biltu?s sister, 

too, is a good student, but with Sanjita leaving the house every day at 5 am and 

returning at 6 pm, she can only hope for the best. She is the only wage-earner, 

with an ailing husband.

Narayan Chandra Roy?s mother Kajal makes thongas, 

which she then sells for daily income. His father has high blood pressure and 

is unemployed. But Kajal?s beaming face is evidence of her pride in her only son, 

who scored 65 per cent in Madhyamik 2004. 

 Special mention

No matter what the hardship, it?s never too much 

to handle. These youngsters always give nothing less than their best to get the 

job done.

Dipak Naskar from Uluberia wants to be a teacher one 

day. The fact that his father is a rickshaw-puller and mother is a domestic help 

only spurs him on to spread education and give others a better chance at life.

Debjyoti Chakraborty?s father sells herbal medicines 

on the pavements. The boy from Baruipur wants to be a cardiologist. He?s on the 

right track, with 89.2 per cent in Madhyamik 2004. In fact, his sister, in Class 

II, is also learning from the Class XI science student ?she came first this year.

Subhajit Pramanik (picture right) lives in a little 

village near Sonarpur, with a father who works as a factory hand for a living, 

although most of the money goes for his mother?s kidney treatment. He hopes to 

be a chartered accountant one day. 

 nShaheryar Hossain?s father suffers from diabetes and his mother is a hypo-thyroid patient. So, a lot of the family?s meagre income goes towards their treatment. But that hasn?t distracted the Saifee Hall student from his goal of being either an accountant or a journalist. With 64 per cent in Madhyamik, he?s on his way.

 nMohammad Eliash?s mother is a day labourer and the family has no proper home. He got the TTEF scholarship last year, and is now pursuing a B.Pharm degree from Jalpaiguri Engineering College.

NISHA LAHIRI

project report 

Back to the border to bond

On September 3, a 69-member delegation of peace activists, 

social workers, artistes and students crossed the border at Wagah to participate 

in the 10th anniversary celebrations of Pakistan-India Peoples Forum for 

Peace and Democracy. Participating in the three-day festivities, Peace and 

Democracy! Now, were four Calcutta students who were part of the TTIS delegation 

to Karachi in January this year. Vibhu Sharma from Army Public School, Fatema 

Wahab from Birla High School, Ishan Bajpai from Assembly of God Church Park Street 

and Ankit Doshi from St Josephs College were garlanded and welcomed by about 

200 of their Pakistani counterparts, along with the rest of the Indian delegation, 

upon their arrival. Pigeons were set free as a symbol of peace and banners with 

the words Long live Indo-Pak friendship and War is no solution 

fluttered in the breeze. The convention included dramas and cultural shows. The 

four, however, enjoyed meeting up with their friends across the border the most. 

The reunions were usually tearful, and the hospitality made them feel at home. 

Although the team was much smaller, there was no lack of enthusiasm and energy.

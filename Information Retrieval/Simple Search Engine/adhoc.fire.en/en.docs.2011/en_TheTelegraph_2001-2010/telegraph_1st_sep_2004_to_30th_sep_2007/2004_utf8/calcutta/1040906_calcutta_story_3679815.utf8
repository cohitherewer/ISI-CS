Survive with stress

COMPANIES DO HELP EMPLOYEES COPE WITH INCREASING 

PRESSURES AT WORK, FINDS NISHA LAHIRI

Yoga, meditation, breathing techniques, theatre workshops, 

meals and night outs with families Not a busy schedule of a social butterfly, 

but mandatory workshops and de-stress methods for overworked employees. Multinational 

companies or national corporate houses, the big bosses are wising up to the fact 

that everyone is under pressure, and letting off steam is a necessity, not a luxury.

Pressure breeds stress, and while the anxiety levels 

are sure to only increase, the need of the hour is learning how to manage the 

load, with decreasing the burden not a feasible option for most.

Enter employee-friendly human resource policies, consultants, 

trainers, workshops, seminars and fun events. They are all geared to make you 

feel better at work and lighten the load a little at least in the mind.

Take Airtel for instance, which has monthly workshops 

in unconventional theatre for lower, middle and higher level management, in mixed 

bunches. Held in Tollygunge Club in the afternoons, a trainer from the Academy 

of Transformational Learning guides the group through the steps.

Breathe easy

It is mandatory for cell phones to be switched off 

and no chairs are allowed, only cushions. In a recent session, the theme was a 

hijacked plane, with the cockpit fashioned out of mobile phones could any situation 

be more stressful than a crisis in mid-air and at gunpoint? Office work is a piece 

of cake. The workshops, however, are all about having fun with colleagues, and 

sometimes even bosses.

At Exide, Art of Living is the name of the corporate 

game, from factory labourers to the CEO. Pranayam and the breathing technique 

of Sudarshan Kriya are the methods of minimising stress. The anger and the attitude 

of militancy among the workers have really disappeared, says CEO S.B. Ganguly.

The benefits of breathing is something we ignore, 

because air is free. But when you feel stressed, just breathe deeply for a few 

minutes and feel the difference. Pain is caused when oxygen doesnt reach that 

part of the body. Stress is nothing but a constant pain in the mind. Breathing 

increases oxygen intake, improves blood circulation and removes the toxins in 

the body, he adds.

Another practice at Exide is team-building exercises, 

to establish bonds between employees. Multidisciplinary training programmes are 

held on a regular basis to help the different departments understand each others 

ways of working. Understanding the flip side of the coin creates respect and 

prevents passing the buck. A sense of belonging is important, clarifies Ganguly.

Art of Living has held numerous workshops in Calcutta 

branches of companies of IT, software and IT-enabled service companies, as well 

as FMCGs like Cadburys. We teach people how to handle emotions in turbulent situations 

by calming the mind, explains Delhi-based trainer Tripta Dhawan.

S.M. Devadason is, amongst other things, an HR consultant, 

who conducts workshops and seminars in companies on stress management and team 

building. His ongoing project is with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and his 

client list includes the Oberoi chain of hotels, Pepsi, CMRI and more.

Managing emotions

The stress management workshops are all about handling 

emotions and time. The team-building agenda has a series of activities like seminars 

and games, to explore the concept of inter-dependency. Its based on colleagues 

making assumptions about themselves. The level of accuracy dictates how well they 

know each other, says Devadason.

The workshops are all in-company, with the organisation 

approaching Devadason wanting to address specific needs of the employees. I submit 

a design, and if its approved, I implement it and then go back for follow-ups, 

he adds.

IT companies, perhaps, are best known for their high-stress 

work atmosphere. At Cognizant Technology Services (CTS) in Sector V, the employees 

are encouraged to take part in corporate quizzes and the Merchants Cup sports 

events . Plus, inter-project group tournaments in fields like football are a regular 

affair. Instructors are also brought in for stress management and team-building 

workshops and seminars.

We conduct a survey every year, asking our employees 

for suggestions and comments. Stress is something that comes up every time. So 

we organise things that help them unwind, whether they take part or just cheer, 

especially after office hours, observes Siddhartha Mukherjee, vice president, 

CTS.

While the stress levels and work loads are not likely 

to get any lighter, the only way forward is learning how to do it all at once 

and manage everything emotions to time with a calm head and a cool attitude.

Breathing techniques or inter-office sports tournaments, 

companies are realising that they only way to make talent stay is to keep them 

happy and healthy.

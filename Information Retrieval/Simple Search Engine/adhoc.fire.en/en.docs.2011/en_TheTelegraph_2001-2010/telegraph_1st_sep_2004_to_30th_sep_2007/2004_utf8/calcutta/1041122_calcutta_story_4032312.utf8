The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Channel block to recover arrears

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government?s no switch-off diktat be damned and sport lovers? plea for play be put aside ? dues dispute has caught the consumer out, yet again.

 ESPN STAR Sports (ESS) ? the sports bouquet currently beaming crucial English Premier League football matches, New Zealand?s cricket tour of Australia and the tennis showpiece ATP Masters Cup ? switched off the two channels on the network of multi-system operator (MSO) Indian Cable Net (formerly RPG Netcom) early on Sunday.

 The beam block took its toll on nearly 6.5 lakh (around 45 per cent) of the city cable homes under the MSO. 

 The reason cited by the broadcaster was dues amounting to Rs 3.5 crore.

 ?We have not received payments since August from the MSO,? claimed an ESS spokesperson from Delhi. ?A senior official from ESS also met Indian Cable Net officials last week but no solution could be reached,? he added.

 Indian Cable Net pushed the ball to the cableman?s court. ?We have formed a steering committee which will take all decisions in this regard,? stressed a spokesperson.

 ?But ESS has been arbitrarily hiking its price despite having no worthwhile content (read, no Team India cricket). They have also not acted according to the government directives,? he added.

 Indian Cable Net is in the process of discontinuing service to a section of operators that has repeatedly failed to pay up.

 In September, the state government had sought time till end-January 2005 from broadcasters, MSOs and operators to sort out the cable chaos and had asked for a ?no switch-off? commitment till then from broadcasters.

 ?The common allegation is that we switch off during crucial matches to create pressure,? the ESS spokesperson said. ?But we did not do so during the Asia Cup or IFA Shield matches.?

 In a solidarity gesture with Indian Cable Net and a move against ?ESS? high-handedness?, another city MSO, Manthan, was planning to block the sports channels on its network. ?We are talking to our operators and will decide accordingly,? said an official, on Sunday evening.

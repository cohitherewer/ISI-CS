 Linux link for green 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Extending the scope of e-governance, the Pollution Control Board (PCB) is rolling out a Linux-based management information system to expedite allotment of no-objection certificates (NOCs) to industrial units and facilitate faster citizen-government interaction. 

 ?The online system will speed up the process of granting certificates to units under the green category. Besides, it will also give citizens a chance to file online complaints on violation of environmental norms,? explained state environment minister Manab Mukherjee.

 According to estimates, the nodal environment body receives 150 to 200 NOC applications daily. Not just bringing an end to physical filing of applications and faster turnaround time, the new system would also ensure transparency in allotment of the certificates, claimed PCB officials.

 Part of a larger information technology (IT) project ? to be implemented by CMC ? in the PCB, the facility will be formally flagged off on Sunday in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 ?We are happy that the state is taking the lead in widening the scope and scale of e-governance in the field of environment. This is a unique initiative and there are no such examples around,? added Mukherjee, who also holds the IT portfolio in the state Cabinet.

 Promoters of green units ? non-polluting in layman?s parlance ? can file their applications electronically by accessing the form in the agency?s website.

 The interactive system will guide the applicant in terms of furnishing relevant documents besides generating unique registration number on submission of the form.

 Senior PCB officials claimed that on submission of correct information, the certificates ? in electronic format ? will be given in ?real time?, without any delay.

 ?The system will also help people in filing complaints and make grievance redress easier for us,? said a PCB official.

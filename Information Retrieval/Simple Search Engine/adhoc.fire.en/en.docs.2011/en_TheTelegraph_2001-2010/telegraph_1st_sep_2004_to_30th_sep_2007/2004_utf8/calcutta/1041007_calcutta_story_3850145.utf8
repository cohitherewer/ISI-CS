There is more to the Susil Pal murder than what seems to have met the eye of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

 This was the contention of Kanika Pal, the doctor?s widow, who pleaded on Wednesday for the case not to be closed.

 ?I am thankful to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CID officials who worked hard to solve the case. But I think this is not the end of the case,? said Kanika.

 ?The arrests were only the first blocks in a jigsaw puzzle falling into place. I believe the masterminds, who had called my husband to Bally on the day of his murder, are still at large,? she claimed.

 The mud-caked body of Pal, a gynaecologist with Serampore Walsh Hospital, was found on a canal bank in Howrah?s Sankrail on July 3, the morning after he had left his Bright Street residence, in Karaya, and gone missing.

 His widow on Wednesday punched holes in the murder motive held up by the CID. 

 ?Refusing to perform an abortion can?t be the reason for killing a doctor. The manner in which he was murdered, as borne out by the injury marks, suggested a premeditated act. There must be other bigger names who had chalked out the plan to kill him,? alleged Kanika.

 Sleuths on Wednesday rounded up three more persons ? including Ramesh Mahato, who had allegedly taken Pal from Konnagar to Uttarpara ? in connection with the murder. All 11 accused were produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate in Howrah and remanded in police custody for 10 days.

 Some questions that remain unanswered are: 

 *If Pal had refused to carry out the abortion procedure, why wasn?t just another doctor called in? What could have prompted such an attack on Pal?

 *According to the CID, the pregnant woman had herself referred Susil Pal?s name, since he was a ?reputed? doctor. Kanika Pal claims her husband had come to Serampore from Jalpaiguri only two months ago and it wasn?t possible for him to earn such a ?reputation?.

*According to Kanika Pal, her husband would attend 

to an unscheduled case only if he personally knew either the patient or the nursing 

home authorities well. She believes ?someone else whom he knew very well? must 

have lured him to Bally.

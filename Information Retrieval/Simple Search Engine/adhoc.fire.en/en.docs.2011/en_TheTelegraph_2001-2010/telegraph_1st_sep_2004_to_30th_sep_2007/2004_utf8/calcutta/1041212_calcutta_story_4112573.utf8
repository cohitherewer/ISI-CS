The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Abandoned and adopted

Nilanjanaa

In the past 10 days, I have had several people calling 

and emailing me about pedigreed dogs roaming the streets of Calcutta. These are 

abandoned pets, braving the cold, struggling to survive, while their insensitive 

owners choose to look away. Some of these pets are fortunate enough to be rescued. 

Others meet a pitiful end.

An abandoned Spitz in Bansdroni was rescued by Ayan, 

a professional drummer and a staunch animal lover. After housing the Spitz in 

his garage for a week, it was put up for adoption at Ashari. Should you decide 

on a pedigreed dog as a pet, please check with Ashari (phone: 24647030). They 

have Dobermans, German Shepherds, Lhasas and Spitzs for adoption. At Ashari, before 

adopting an animal you can spend time with the dog, take him for a walk and then 

decide if you can share your home with him.

Mahua rescued a four-year-old Lhasa from its careless 

owners in Sodepur. The dog was in the last stage of distemper and passed away.

A word of advice: If you can?t look after your pet, 

please contact Ashari and put it up for adoption. Alternatively, pay for your 

pet?s upkeep at the shelter and visit it when convenient.

A word of caution for owners who abandon their pets, 

keep them chained all day or neglect them ? under the Prevention Of Cruelty To 

Animals Act, such cases can be reported to the police and the owners are liable 

for prosecution.

PS: Three kittens, two months old, need a home.

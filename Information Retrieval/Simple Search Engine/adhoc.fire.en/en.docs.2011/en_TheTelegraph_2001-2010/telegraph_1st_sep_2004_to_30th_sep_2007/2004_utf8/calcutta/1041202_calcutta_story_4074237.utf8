The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Goliath goes down in 30 minutes 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Wednesday afternoon traffic in red-light mode for half-an-hour and more told the tale of a rank failure. A failure on the part of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to follow a court order and block the 30-minute Citu chakka jam.

 Though police were deployed in large numbers at key crossings, the labour arm of the ruling CPM ruled the roads, while the men in uniform remained silent spectators.

 Calcutta High Court had directed the government on Tuesday to ensure that no vehicle was stopped by the chakka jam.

 But a handful of Citu supporters managed to block major intersections, even as hordes of policemen either looked the other way or at their watches.

 Senior police officials, however, claimed later in the day that the force had tried its best to ensure normal flow of traffic by arresting Citu workers.

 ?Who said that we did not take steps to ensure free flow of vehicular traffic during Citu?s programme? We arrested 43 Citu supporters, including CPM legislator Anadi Shaw, for picketing on the roads and initiated cases against 340 vehicles on charges of blocking roads,? said deputy commissioner (traffic) Arun Sharma.

 ?Besides, at least 10 buses were towed away to different police stations with the help of cranes. Action will be taken against the violators as per provisions of the Motor Vehicles rules (cash penalty of Rs 2,000),?? added Sharma.

 Policemen on duty at the Esplanade, Maniktala and Gariahat intersections had to face commuters? wrath for the failure to prevent Citu workers from obstructing traffic.

 At some places, the chakka jam led to altercations among passengers, transport operators and policemen on duty.

 Anasuya Dhar, on a bus on route 3B, had to get off near Chowringhee. ?I was in a hurry to visit my ailing father at Medical College and Hospital. I had to walk all the way there,? she complained.

 Chartered accountant Jyotikrishna Pal, on his way to office in BBD Bag, was caught in a jam on SN Banerjee Road. ?The cops on duty only expressed their helplessness,? he said.

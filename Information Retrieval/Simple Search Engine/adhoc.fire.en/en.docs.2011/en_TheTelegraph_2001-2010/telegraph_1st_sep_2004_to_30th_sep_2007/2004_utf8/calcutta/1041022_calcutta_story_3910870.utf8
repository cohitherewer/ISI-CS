The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Adda, masti amp; piety

The dream of all-night adda, the sights and sounds of 

a city in the grip of festive fever, the flavours of a thousand savoury and sweet 

delights... Hanging out with new friends and catching up with old ones, spending 

time with family and relaxing with relatives... A bit of pandal-hopping, some 

worshipping of the goddess and lots of community activity in the para. All this 

and more is what Durga puja means to the young and the restless. Not a lot has 

changed when it comes to what youngsters like about the season and what it means 

to them. Young Metro catches a group of them doing what they love most 

having an old-fashioned chat session on the Maddox Square greens.

Community feeling and spending time together, with 

family, friends and neighbours, is not just something the adults love doing during 

the Pujas, as we found out on Sashti evening at Maddox Square, during an impromptu 

adda session with an ad hoc bunch of school and college students. The Christmas 

spirit of sharing and caring begins right here and now. 

Followed by large dollops of fun and games, of course. 

Crossing the threshold from childhood to young adulthood is not easy, but it does 

have its advantages ? closer friendships, romance and the first taste of freedom. 

Durga puja in Calcutta is a hotbed of discovery, with 

more allowances for tentative exploration than other times of the year. But while 

the young love a bit of adventure, convention and tradition are not all bad. When 

it came to a question of the dream Puja do, it boiled down to the good old-fashioned 

adda.

?I would love to just sit with all my friends and 

talk all night. What could be a better way to spend the Pujas?? smiled Kasturi 

Chatterjee, a second-year student of Asutosh College. Dressed in a soft blue-and-green 

sari, she?s content to just walk around the square, catching up with people she 

knows.

And that?s pretty much the case with the rest of the 

motley crew. Sitting for 15 minutes in Maddox Square, every few minutes, groups 

of twos and threes dropped by to smile and hug, say ?Hi? and give their inputs 

for the ongoing discussion. In fact, practically every inch of the ground was 

taken up by youngsters sprawled or seated, away from parental control, laughing 

and talking. ?Some stay here all night,? put in Subhajoy Roy, a fresher in Asutosh 

College, a little awe-struck by all the activity. ?No Puja is complete without 

dropping in here,? said the first-timer.

While 18-year-old Sangeet Shirodkar is a veteran at 

the game ? ?have to come to Maddox at least once every year? ? Jadavpur University 

first-year student Madhumita Das is a little more used to parental control. ?They 

generally let me go, but there are curfews. And they have to know where I am going, 

what I am doing, with who I am going, what time I will be back...?

But the youngsters seem more indulgent than bothered 

about the lack of freedom. ?My father never lets me go out all night with my friends 

during the Pujas. But it doesn?t matter, because I spend it with them anyway. 

Maybe this year I will persuade him to let me go for a little while,? grinned 

Subhajoy. 

?I don?t mind. My parents appear more strict than 

they actually are,? added Madhumita.

It?s all about togetherness. Sangeet is not a Bengali, 

but he gives anjali every year at his para puja in Jodhpur Park. 

Asif Salam, a second-year college student, is dressed up to the hilt in pyjama-kurta, 

paying homage to the goddess and hanging out with his friends at the pandals. 

?I love giving anjali, and I do it every year,? asserted Sangeet.

The piety of the Pujas, the wealth of culture, tradition 

and heritage are not lost on GenX. Madhumita and Amrita Chauhan love the Dashami 

Puja the best, which starts from early morning on the final day of the festivities. 

The girls are also very much a part of sindoor khela, even if it is just 

for married women (?we don?t want to be left out?). 

And there?s no anjali like that on Ashtami 

morning at the pandal, and the bhog tastes that much sweeter after a long 

wait in queue and eaten under a hot sun with friends.

For Amrita, there is also plenty to watch out for 

on the streets. ?Every pandal is different and the creativity is really something 

to learn from. Every where you look, it?s something unique. Where else will you 

find this? It?s amazing,? she enthused.

But the winners, hands down, are para puja programmes 

and junk food. Eating whatever, whenever, with no restrictions on time and place, 

is always a delight. 

?I love to stay in my locality because there is so 

much happening and everyone takes part,? smiled Debashmita Kanjilal, a Class XII 

student of National High School.

For Kasturi, childhood memories of taking part in 

dance and music shows at the functions are still very much alive. ?We used to 

take so much time to prepare and practise...?

No nightclubs please, just some good, clean fun. ?On 

dandiya night, of course, we have music and dancing. But we don?t need 

big parties,? said Sangeet.

The Puja plan of action is never complete without 

spending time with parents, siblings and relatives, especially the elders. ?I 

keep one day aside to just spend with my family,? said Subhajoy. 

The rest of the time is for friends anyway. Because 

while Ma and Baba might want to know the who-what-when-where-why, more often than 

not, they are happy to let the kids be with their peers, ?because they pretend 

they don?t, but they do understand?.

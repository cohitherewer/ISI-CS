 Shut the door on visitor din

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should entry to hospitals be restricted to pre-empt disruptions?

Sukanya Saha,

Irresponsible authorities of many hospitals readily allow random entry of people 

on the premises. A minimum code of discipline should be followed in hospitals 

to bar such entries. However, it should not be so rigid that the family of the 

patient will have to be harassed for being granted the permission to meet the 

admitted. 

Govind Das Dujari,

Diamond Harbour Road

Entry to hospitals should be restricted not only for 

the normal functioning but also for the sake of maintaining a suitable atmosphere 

for treatment and recovery of patients. Troublemakers at hospitals are so insensitive 

that they would realise the discomfort that a ruckus creates only when they get 

in the same situation as the patients. The government should strictly deal with 

any kind of disruption by public or staff in hospitals. 

Ahasan Jahir Molla, 

Maheshtala 

Entry of unwanted people should be restricted in hospitals as this pollutes the 

environment. This practice points at the deplorable condition of the healthcare 

system in India. We could take a leaf out of the medicare system in advanced countries.

Piyal Mukherjee, 

Lake Town 

Cases have been reported of disruption in hospitals which affect the treatment 

of patients. Unrestricted entry gives access to undesirable elements who disrupt 

the functioning of hospitals. As such, restriction of entry into sensitive areas 

like hospitals should be restricted in order to ensure smooth functioning by the 

staff and better treatment of patients. 

Atif Ayaz,

Serampore 

In a critical condition, a patient needs complete rest and a peaceful environment. 

So authorities should see to it that unwanted people are not allowed entry to 

hospitals. A certain time should be fixed for meeting patients. Usually a large 

number of visitors in a ward tend to create disturbance which is harmful for other 

patients. The management should consider this matter seriously.

Rohinimohan P. mazumdar,

Entry? Of whom? Of politics? Of evil-mongers? Who will restrict mal-administration 

in the hospital? I think a highly disciplined military force should be deployed 

in each hospital to keep a tab on entry into hospitals. This might be done for 

a short-term period, after which a co-operative of patients may be formed with 

the help of the military force to look after administration in the hospital. 

Ajit Kumar Das, 

Ghusuri 

Certainly, some restrictions should be imposed regarding entry to hospitals. In 

my opinion, four visiting cards should be issued per patients but at a time only 

two visitors should be allowed in the first hour and another two in the next. 

Time of entry should be printed on the cards to stop nuisance on the part of the 

family of the patient. 

Sunil Kr. Bose, 

Baruipur

Some patients die in hospitals mainly due to doctors? fault which they never admit. 

Minimisation of maltreatment of patients can lead to reduced disruption in hospitals. 

To maintain peace and discipline in a hospital, entry may be restricted but it 

is no less important that a suitable method be evolved to plug the communication 

gap among doctors, nurses and patients? families. 

Kanai Saha,

 Gauri Bari Lane 

Hospitals are meant for treatment of patients, hence a peaceful atmosphere is 

a must. To prevent vandalism by angry families of patients or disruption of any 

kind at hospitals authorities should appoint security guards at every entry point 

and issue visiting cards, allowing only one person at a time to call on the patient 

during visiting hours. Awareness of the visitors to maintain peace and tranquillity 

in hospitals is the primary need. 

Pijus Kanti Sarkar, 

Narendrapur 

To prevent disruptions at hospitals, entry of people should be restricted at the 

main gate, otherwise troublemakers cannot be controlled. Smoking and urinating 

at will inside hospital premises should be stopped, while jhopris of hospital 

staff that add to the area?s pollution should be cleared immediately. On the whole, 

care should be taken to maintain peace and cleanliness at hospitals. 

Chandan Ray, 

Sarsuna 

Hospitals are increasingly becoming sites for exacting revenge by wrathful families 

of patients. Doctors are harassed and expensive medical instruments destroyed. 

This should not be tolerated and strict vigilance should be a must for restriction 

of undesirable elements into hospitals. This will end sufferings of critically-ill 

patients. Deployment of security force from dusk to dawn is necessary at all hospitals. 

Gobinda Ghosh,

Address not given

To a certain extent, there should definitely be restrictions in entry to hospitals 

to pre-empt disruptions. But it will be quite difficult for the gate-keeper to 

keep his palms from being greased; the nurses and the staff need to be made aware 

of the regulations of entry. This is needed for the quick recovery of patients. 

Tanmoy Das Lala,

 Salt Lake 

Entry to hospitals should definitely be restricted. Care needs to be taken to 

ensure that the flow of people within the hospital is restricted. A decrease in 

the number of hospital visitors would decrease the incidence of infection. No 

mob should be allowed in, as they cause destruction of hospital property. 

Ronita Dutta, 

Jadavpur

Regulating entry of people into hospitals is a vital issue these days. While disgruntled 

families of patients go about disrupting normal work at hospitals and vandalising 

equipment, it becomes the prerogative of the authorities to ensure that their 

entry is checked for speedy recovery of other patients. 

Yechen Lama,

 Rajarhat

Families of patients take it upon themselves to give vent to their anger by disrupting 

the working at hospitals at the slightest provocation. They do not understand 

that their irresponsible behaviour lands other patients admitted in the hospital 

in trouble and delays their recovery. So the authorities of the hospitals should 

ensure that families do not take to disruption of activities. 

Shrijit Venkatesh, 

Salt Lake

It is the hospital authorities? duty to ensure that patients are treated well 

and all amenities are made available to them. This includes a peaceful atmosphere 

at the place of recovery. If that entails restriction of entry to hospitals, then 

the management should take care to ensure adequate vigil to maintain that. 

Ranadip Ganguly,

 Diamond Park

Hospitals are places for patients suffering from grave illnesses or in critical 

conditions. They are accordingly taken care of by doctors and nurses who try to 

provide relief to them and help them on their way to recovery. So it is necessary 

to impose restrictions on entry of outsiders to hospitals to avoid a ruckus in 

the wards.

Bratin Sen, 

Kamarpukur

This is a matter of utmost importance. And hospital 

authorities should deal with such problems of disruption of hospital schedule 

by outsiders with an iron hand of discipline. Restricting entry to hospitals is 

the first step to ensure peace at hospitals.

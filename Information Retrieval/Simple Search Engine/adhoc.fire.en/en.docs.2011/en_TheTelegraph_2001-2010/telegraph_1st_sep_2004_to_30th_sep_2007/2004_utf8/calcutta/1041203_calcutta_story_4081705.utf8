 Brooke Shields: Smooth sail

 A spunky, sharp-tongued woman who never gets her man. That?s Blue Lagoon star Brooke Shields on the Broadway stage this season. The 39-year-old actress is mesmerising audiences as journalist Ruth Sutherford in the revival of Wonderful Town.

 In this much-acclaimed Broadway musical, Shields replaces the beautiful stage actress Donna Murphy who received a Tony Award nomination for the role.

 To look the part of a tough-talking girl who leaves Ohio in 1935 with her more beautiful younger sister, Shields has reportedly toned down her stunning looks. 

 With Leonard Bernstein?s tunes set to lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Wonderful Town premiered on September 18 after a two-week rehearsal with Shields.

 The production won the 2004 Outer Critics Circle Award for best musical revival and the 2004 Tony Award for Best Choreography. It has been directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall.

 Wonderful Town is not Shields? first brush with Broadway. Shields had also starred in the revival of Grease! and Cabaret, and as replacements in both. Off Broadway, she has featured in The Exonerated and Eve Ensler?s The Vagina Monologues. 

 After shooting to fame with the controversial Pretty Baby, Shields navigated through a Hollywood career with films like Blue Lagoon and Endless Love. Only later in her career did she take to comedy with the TV sitcom Friends.

 When the stint fetched her an American Comedy Award, the Princeton University graduate ? she wrote her thesis on Pretty Baby and other Louis Malle films ? piloted her own sitcom Suddenly Susan which ran several seasons and went on to bring her the Golden Globe nomination for best actress. 

 Now, her 18-month-old daughter Rowan tags along with Shields to watch her mother in Wonderful Town. Meanwhile, Shields is busy writing a book titled Down Came the Rain: My Journey through Postpartum Depression. Her tome on childbirth complications is due for launch in May 2005. 

Spacey: Out of tune?

While Brooke Shields has got off to a thumping start, 

the season has not been so pleasant for another Hollywood biggie helming a London 

theatre company. 

 Kevin Spacey?s debut directorial project, Cloaca, opened at the Old Vic, one of London?s oldest theatre establishments, to a mixed response this autumn.

 Though the Oscar-winning actor was confident of a good beginning when he took over as artistic director of the newly-formed Old Vic Theatre Company early this year, British critics have labelled his two-and-half-hour production an ?embarrassing aberration?. 

 Cloaca stars Hugh Bonneville, Neil Pearson, Stephen Tompkinson and Ingeborga Dapkunaite. Scripted by Dutch writer Maria Goos, the play revolves around four friends reunited in middle age and the fissures that surface in their relationships.

 Spacey has three more productions lined up to prove his mettle, off screen. Once Cloaca winds up in mid-December, Old Vic will be ready to roll out its brand new Christmas production Aladdin. 

 The classic pantomime will feature Sir Ian McKellen as Widow Twankee. 

 The company?s third production, Dennis McIntyre?s National Anthems, will be a role revisit for Spacey the actor. In 1988, Spacey had played fire-fighter Ben Cook in the drama set in the US. A critique of suburban values, National Anthems will be directed by David Grindley and will run from February 2005.

 The final production at Old Vic is The Philadelphia Story, Philip Barry?s classic Broadway comedy to be seen for the first time in the West End. 

 The stage version of the film starring Cary Grant, James Stewart and Katharine Hepburn will run from May to July 2005. Spacey plays the role made famous by Grant.

 The American Beauty star first appeared on the American stage as a messenger in Henry VI, Part I at a Shakespeare festival in 1981. 

 Henrik Ibsen?s Ghosts marked his Broadway debut a year later. 

 Though Spacey veered towards Hollywood, he did go on to pick up a Tony Award for playing Uncle Louie in Neil Simon?s Broadway hit Lost in Yonkers in 1991. 

 At Old Vic Theatre Company, Spacey has committed to feature in at least two productions every season.

 After Dhananjoy Chatterjee?s widow, it?s now the turn of his executioner to plead for a ban on stage adaptations of the life and death (on the gallows) of the rapist-killer.

 While Purnima fears the scripts will portray her husband as a villain, Nata Mullick is apprehensive the productions will expose him to public ridicule and hostility. 

 The hangman on Friday appealed to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to ban jatras based on the Independence Day-eve hanging of Dhananjoy and publicity of the productions on billboards.

 The man who had happily hogged the headlines before the execution, even shared a dais once with the chief minister?s wife to campaign for Dhananjoy?s death sentence, told Metro on Friday: ?Please try to imagine my plight. The plays are going to recreate everything, especially the hanging, and expose me to ridicule, scorn and public hostility.? 

 He added: ?I am unwell, advanced in years and cannot bear the ordeal any more.? 

 Nata?s lawyer Dipit Bose wrote to the chief minister, pointing out that the post-hanging outpourings in the media and other fora had already affected his client. 

 Bose also urged half-a-dozen jatra groups ? Natya Niketan, Muktangan Opera, Dikjoyee Opera, Bharati Opera, Manjushree Opera and Jatra Mancha ? to change their plans of staging plays based on Dhananjoy?s life.

 Nata said the memory of the hanging still haunts him, though a month and a half had passed since he pulled the lever, hurling Dhananjoy into the dark pit of death. 

 ?I try hard to live it down, but the scene keeps coming back to my mind. It causes a lot of pain,? Nata said.

 Thanks to the wide publicity of the execution, several kids across the state have felt encouraged to act out the episode, resulting in at least half-a-dozen deaths.

 ?Because of all this, I?m being painted as a villain. No one seems to realise that I had acted only as an agent. I performed role on the orders of the Supreme Court and the government,? said Nata. 

 A few weeks ago, Dhananjoy?s widow had written to the government, seeking a ban on jatras based on her?s husband life. ?How can I accept that he will be treated as shabbily and wrongly on stage as he was in life?? Purnima asked.

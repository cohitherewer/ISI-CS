The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A dark shade is she

If there?s one word to describe Jaya Bhattacharya 

it has to be bindaas. The actress who has become a familiar face in every 

drawing room after the airwave onslaught by Balaji?s Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi 

Bahu Thi believes in taking things as they come. And returning to the stage 

every now and then is something that comes to her naturally.

 So she was one of the forces behind as many as eight of the Kyunki team to take time out and do Sabse Bada Rupaiya. 

 The play, which premiered in Mumbai this May, is a family entertainer and is about this retired patriarch Shantilal (played by Sudhir Dalvi) and his family. Jaya plays one of the bahus (for a change), Alka.

 ?I?ve been on stage before and it?s good to face a live audience. The problem that we faced was taking time out for rehearsals, with Kyunki being a daily soap. But we did get to rehearse for one-and-a-half months before taking the stage and the response in Mumbai was really good. We are planning to come to Calcutta with the play on December 24 and 25.?

 Written and directed by Ahmedabad-based Gujarati theatre personality Harin Thakar, Sabse Bada Rupaiya also marks the stage debut for a lot of the Kyunki cast including Rakesh Paul, Ritu Chaudhary, Jiten Lalvani, Khyati Keshwani and Jitendra Trehan.

 For Jaya, theatre is not that different from cinema but she believes in making those subtle adjustments. ?To me, it is just a magnification of the acting style. The emotions do remain the same but on stage you have to be a lot louder, while in cinema it?s all about being mellow. That?s the difference, a millimetre-centimetre here and there.?

And if you are wondering about the shade of her character in Sabse Bada Rupaiya, well, it?s black, again. ?I didn?t want to play the negative character. I wanted something positive. But all of them felt there was no one in the team who could play the negative role better. So here I am playing the baddie on stage too.?

 Whether it?s Payal or Alka, you know what to expect from Jaya, but does Sabse Bada Rupaiya suffer from or bank on the Kyunki hangover? ?Not at all,? protests the actress. 

 ?It borrows very little from the telly serial and stands tall on its own merit,? she asserts.

 So if you want to spend time with Jaya and the rest of the Kyunki team this Christmas, catch Sabse Bada Rupaiya in your city.

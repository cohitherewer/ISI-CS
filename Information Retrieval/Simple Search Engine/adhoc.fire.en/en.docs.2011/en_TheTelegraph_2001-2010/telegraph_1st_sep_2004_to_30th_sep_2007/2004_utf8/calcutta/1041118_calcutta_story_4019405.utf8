The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Malaika Arora: Oomph factor

 Has motherhood dented her sex appeal even a wee bit? Not really, for Malaika Arora Khan is laughing all her way to yet another plum project on the telly. The MTV Style Check anchor has been roped in by Sahara One to host Style Mantra, a fashion-pegged chat show on celebrity lifestyle. So, every Sunday at 2 pm, starting November 21, Malaika will take her audience through a weekly trip into the costly wardrobes of the rich and famous, either dropping into their homes (sometimes even invading their bedrooms) or their make-up vans and on the sets.

 But hosting Style Mantra is no big deal for the model-turned-actress who is used to rubbing shoulders with the people who matter. ?It?s good fun and very enjoyable. And as I know most of them personally, anchoring the show is not intimidating at all,? Malaika told Metro, having shot the first 15 episodes.

 ?For instance, Tusshar was very nice, Kareena very frank, and Yuvraj very sweet,? revealed the Chhaiya Chhaiya girl.

 From film stars to models, sportsmen to politicians, media barons to business tycoons, the leggy beauty will peep into designer dreams, beauty tips, fashion trends, shop stops and the glam dos attended by the high-fliers.

 For Malaika, a film could be happening sometime next year, but as of now it?s her own clothesline that is keeping her busy, apart from baby-sitting, of course.

Eric Cantona: Man in the middle

 Tony is a 14-year-old Manchester United fan and although an altar boy at the local parish, is no angel. His allegiance to football lands him in big trouble and through a series of scrapes, his beloved FA Cup final ticket is confiscated. He plans his revenge on the congregation and tampers with the altar wine but his plans go awry as the parishioners start to hallucinate.

 When The Reds Come Marching In ? a film ?about God and Cantona?, the mass and the match, tackling the establishment and paying the penalty ? is part of Moving the Goalposts, a film package on football presented by the British Council. Comprising 11 shorts in 16 mm, each with a football-related theme, it will all be screened on November 23 and 24 (4 pm to 6.30 pm) at Nandan II.

 The Sunny Side of The Street, Livertonian, The Worst Jewish Football Team In The World, Balls, See You At Wembley, Frankie Walsh, Eight, Awayday, The Heart of Football, The Do-It-Yourself Football Club Kit and This Boy?s Story are the other attractions. The two longest films, See You At Wembley, Frankie Walsh and This Boy?s Story, both graduation films from the National Film amp; Television, each won the Oscar for best student film.

 This motley and entertaining set of football shorts focuses largely on the fans, their rivalries and loyalties, family tensions and the darker side represented by the football hooligan. Many of the films highlight the influence the game has on younger fans, who dream of Cup final glory or of meeting their idol in person.

 Despite the mind-boggling commerce that goes with it, football remains the people?s game. From the small boys (and girls) who emulate their heroes in parks and backyards to the grizzled veteran who can remember the days when his team was expected to beat the world ? fascinating strands of the beautiful game are explored.

 Be there from the kick-off to the final whistle.

 It?s time to punch in the messages and make your choice. Sony Entertainment Television?s latest offering, Indian Idol, has already gripped audiences across the nation. With soaring TRPs, the show is now on to its most crucial stage where not just the three judges (Anu Malik, Sonu Nigam and Farah Khan) but you too have a voice. 

 On November 11, the show had viewers on the edge of their seats as they watched the judges whittle down 129 contestants to the final 30. In the last few months, Farah, Anu and Sonu have shortlisted the best talent from hundreds and thousands of aspirants that poured in from every corner of the country. 

 Says Tarun Katial, executive vice-president, Sony Entertainment Television: ?Truly ?of the people, by the people and for the people?, Indian Idol is a democratic show wherein the nation gets to choose the voice they want to hear.?

Stephen Fry: In the act

 He?s been in Le Divorce and Gosford Park, he?s played P.G. Woodehouse?s Jeeves and author Oscar Wilde. Stephen Fry has entertained and amused audiences on the stage, on the small and big screens for over two-and-a-half decades. The British actor can amuse as easily as bring a tear to the eye. He even went behind the camera for the award-winning Bright Young Things. 

 But the latest offering that Star World has lined up is definitely of the funny kind, albeit with several shades of darkness. The BBC series Absolute Power centres around the public relations company Prentiss McCabe. The formula for success here is lying for a living. 

 While the employees lower down the order muddle through the mundane, those in power, like Charles Prentiss (Fry), make scummy sportsmen, politicians and celebrities shine like gold. Old-timer Martin McCabe is a little out of depth in this classic British comedy. 

 There are no morals, values or ethics, and none of the characters are likeable in the least. But it does make for some fun watching, although not for the faint-hearted. Seeing wife-beaters made into heroes is not everyone?s cup of tea. Wit and sarcasm, though, are the cornerstones of this show, at a time when spin doctors are necessary accessories for anyone famous.

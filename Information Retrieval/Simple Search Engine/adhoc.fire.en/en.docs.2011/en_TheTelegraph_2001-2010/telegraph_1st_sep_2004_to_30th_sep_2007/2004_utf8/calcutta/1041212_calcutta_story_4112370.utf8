The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Gladiators in grab game

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

A 

friend emailed this ad to me. I must confess that I had not seen it earlier. I 

thus cannot tell you whether it was released in the media at all or for that matter 

whether such an ad was ever created by Durex, a brand of condoms. Yet, the ad 

has been designed professionally enough for me to believe that this is a genuine 

one. It has no visuals, a lot of empty space and very little but very incisive 

copy. The blank space draws your attention and then the words take over. The copy 

simply says ? To all those who use our competitors? products ? Happy Father?s 

Day.

The copy is remarkably vicious and brilliantly civil. 

And quite intelligently makes the point about safety and reliability of Durex. 

For competing brands of condom, this is a very powerful hit.

This reminded me of an equally striking competitive 

communication that I had come across in a shop in Darjeeling. This was a shop 

that sold expensive Tibetan artefacts. It displayed a message prominently on the 

glass shelf: ?If you find prices in our competitors shop lower, do not be surprised. 

They know what their goods are worth.?

In comparison, the fight between Pepsi and Coca-Cola 

through advertising was often in bad taste. Remember the wonderfully crafted Coke 

ad with Hrithik Roshan. The then heartthrob of the nation gets asked by the villagers 

to join them for a dance. The tune being played was naturally from Kaho Na? 

After seeing him dance so well, the sarpanch suggests that Hrithik should 

try to get into films. Pepsi countered rather viciously. There was that infamous 

Shah Rukh Khan ad which featured the boy with the braces on his teeth. Arguably, 

Coke won the game, set and the match.

The last breed of competitive battle is possibly the 

most subtle. Hutch managed to increase the price of Pugs in the country, thanks 

to its hugely successful campaign featuring a member of that loving breed. Not 

only is the campaign pleasing to watch, perhaps far more critically, it also makes 

the point very subtly but very strongly that Hutch has a wide network.

AirTel did respond with the glider ad, making the 

same point. The couple crashlands in a jungle. Her AirTel works; she calls her 

Dad to say that she will be home late. This has now been replaced by the ad featuring 

a young girl in a boarding school. The message that both have chosen to communicate 

is the same: width of network. The fight is on creative terms. And thankfully 

there is no ugly attempt of one-upmanship involved.

The million-dollar question is, is there any real 

marketing benefit? The answer would obviously depend on how the consumers respond 

to the squabbles. It is possibly beyond debate that consumers prefer it to inane 

canvassing. It is perhaps like watching a cockfight. You could not care less who 

won.

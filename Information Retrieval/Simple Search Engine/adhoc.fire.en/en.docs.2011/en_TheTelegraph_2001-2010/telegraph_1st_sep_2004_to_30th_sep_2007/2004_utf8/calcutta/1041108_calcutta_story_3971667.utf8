The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The authorities have fixed November 12, 13 and 14 for immersion of Kali idols. 

However, during those days Garden Reach and Metiabruz will be crowded due to the 

approaching festival of Id. People flock from far-flung areas to the markets here 

as there are many garment manufacturing units in Metiabruz and prices of readymades 

are low. Roadside hawkers also crowd the areas in the hope of increased sales. 

Thus, it will be difficult to carry the idols on Matadors and trucks via Mudiali 

market to Bichalighat where they are immersed. We, the residents of the area, 

request the police and the administration to consider the case as an exception 

and allow idols in these areas to be taken out for immersion between November 

15 and 17.

 Tank no. 3 in Lake Town?s block B needs immediate cleaning. Many people residing 

in the area are throwing garbage into it. Some even wash their vehicles at the 

edge of the tank. Perhaps, the tank bed needs to be dredged. Otherwise, during 

the next monsoon the tank will surely overflow.

 I was to take a test on October 31 as part of the screening process to fill 

a job vacancy in a reputed private company. Thanks to our postal department I 

received the admit card on November 1. I missed a fabulous chance of getting a 

good job. I may not be the only one who is missing such precious opportunities 

because of the malfunctioning of one of the world?s largest postal networks.

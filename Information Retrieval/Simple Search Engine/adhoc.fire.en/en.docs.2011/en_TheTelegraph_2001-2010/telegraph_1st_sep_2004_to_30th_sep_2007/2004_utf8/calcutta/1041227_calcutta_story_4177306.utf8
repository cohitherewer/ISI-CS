The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Declarations that are must

 ASHOKE BHATTACHARJEE, controller of legal metrology, met readers of The Telegraph at his office on December 10 to answer their queries. 

Participants included Sandip Banerjee, Atanu Ghosh, Sakya Basu, Basudeb Chowdhury and Subhasish Chakraborty 

Basudeb Chowdhury: Which declarations are must 

for selling packaged commodities?

For selling packaged items, manufacturers have to 

make six declarations. These are: 

 The name and complete postal address of the manufacturer. Along with the common name, the generic name of an item, too, should be mentioned. For example, if any company is selling common salt under brand name XYZ, it also has to mention the generic chemical name of the product ? Sodium Chloride ? on the packet. 

The other compulsory declarations are the net weight 

of the product, the maximum retail price and the month and year of the packaging.

Basudeb Chowdhury: Is the law same for imported 

products, too?

 Even for an imported product, the package has to bear the six compulsory declarations. All measurements should be in SI (System International) units. It is also mandatory to put the importer?s licence number on the packet. 

 In case of home-grown products, too, the packets have to bear some definite specifications as laid down by law for packaged commodities. According to law, there are two schedules under which products are classified. Products belonging to Schedule A should be stamped with a code number of the transferee state along with the code number of the state where it is marketed.

Schedule B products only need our clearance. We allow 

the sale against a payment by the distributor of the manufacturer. 

Subhasish Chakraborty: Like trade licence, does 

one have to take any licence from your department?

 Yes, one would have to obtain a licence or permission from us for carrying on a business. Unfortunately, only s few traders or manufacturers do this. It costs only Rs 20 to get a licence. 

But if any trader functions without a licence, he 

can be prosecuted and sent to jail for six months and also fined.

Atanu Ghosh: How can one lodge a complaint with 

you by keeping his identity secret?

A cheated customer can send us a faxed message giving 

details of the errant trader. Our fax number is 22364258. To book an errant trader, 

we need a faxed or written complaint. Recently, a resident of south Calcutta had 

faxed us a complaint against a trader dealing in marble and other flooring items. 

We raided the shop and found the trader charging more than the actual price. The 

trader was slapped a hefty fine. 

Atanu Ghosh: Can you please inform what one needs 

to do to market a machinery in the state?

 While many new enterprises are coming up in the state, it becomes very important for the first generation-entrepreneurs to have an idea of marketing products. 

As for machines, we have two categories. For products 

under the first category, one has to obtain an approval for the model from the 

consumer department in New Delhi and then seek our approval. For machines or gadgets 

in the second category, we are the sole authorities for granting approval. Any 

interested person can contact us for details.

Sakya Basu: Is it possible to stop all unfair 

trade practices?

 Going by our experience, it is not possible to stop all unfair trade practices, but a constant vigil and sustained awareness drive can improve the situation a lot. 

 According to our feedback, quite a few of the traders booked by us now hardly dare to adopt unfair means. We are strengthening our network to track down errant traders and will soon introduce e-governance.

 And the spirit shines through

Day II of the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 

trail hit pujas that covered extremes of social and ecological effort and lack 

of awareness and initiative. If some scored high and stayed in the running for 

the grand recognition (to be announced on Ashtami after another round of inspection 

by a celebrity team of six), others were encouraged to learn and improve on their 

shortfalls.

After all, the accent in this award with a difference 

is not on winning, but on making Durga puja the perfect occasion to share and 

care, to have fun the safe and sincere way.

Here?s what it looked like on three festive trails 

on Saptami:

Route One: Through the heart of south Calcutta, 

covering Chakraberia Sarbojanin, Padmapukur Baroari, Bhabanipur Durgotsav, Kalighat 

Vivekananda Sporting, Mudiali Club, Lake Youth Corner and Forward Club.

One of the pujas scored for excellent fire-fighting arrangements. Even a ladder 

was in place to reach the top of the pandal in case of a fire. A nurse was on 

duty at a first-aid counter with even an inhaler for asthma attacks. Fire-fighting 

gear was everywhere and most organisers knew how to handle them.

At many pandals, even if the first-aid counter was there, the nurse was ?just 

away for a change of shift?. At one site, the search for a toilet led to an alley 

leading to the back of a house with the gate locked. A question was raised about 

the efficacy of the government?s fire-proof certificate when a puja committee 

produced documents proving use of fire resistant chemicals, but on inspection, 

a ?chemically-treated? jute fibre burst into flames.

 Impression: South Calcutta treads the traditional path when it comes to puja themes. The idols (with one exception) were all classical countenances. If Bhabanipur Durgotsav impressed with its jute artistry, it was even more touching to have inmates of Nabanir, an old-age home, drop in at the pandal just when the judges were leaving. 

 ?Such efforts by organisers make the Puja an event to look forward to for all of us,? beamed 74-year-old Sulata Roy, speaking for 39 of her mates in the bus.

Route two: 25 Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsab, 74 

Palli, 78 Palli Sarbojanin, Jodhpur Park Saradiya Utsab Committee, Babubagan Sarbojanin.

Trees not cut for any of the pandals. Except for one, all organisers had taken 

the initiative to provide good electrical wiring or fire-safety devices, or both. 

Poor waste management. Use of environment-friendly material for pandals lacking.

 Impression: The pulsating beat of a faraway tribal land is a sure-shot crowd-puller at Kidderpore?s 25 Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsab. 

 Interestingly, one has to go right around the pandal to find out where the music is coming from ? a group of Adivasis brought all the way from Jhargram.

 The bronze-look idol, in a bamboo shrine embellished with voodoo masks, transports one to Gondwana land 5,000 years ago. The 74 Palli pandal, a few yards from there, is a jolt back to reality. The worn-out pandal can be mistaken for just another old-Calcutta theatre, showing ?Durgatinashini?, a play. With fire safety, crowd and crisis management plans in place, the two neighbouring pandals seem to be taking the competition in the true spirit.

 With volunteers aplenty, Jodhpur Park Saradiya Utsab Committee was all set to handle the evening rush. Babubagan Sarbojanin, with tiles, cut into varied designs, had placed the idol on a pedestal in a brick-and-mortar temple. Spacious entry and exit gates would surely earn vital points for this puja.

 Route three: The designated pujas were mainly in the southern part of the city ? the Haridevpur and Sarsuna belt. In and around Haridevpur, the team stopped over at Palli Unnayan Samiti, Putiari Sarbojanin, 41 Palli Club, Ajeya Sanghati, Vivekananda Park and Vivekananda Sporting Club. 

 That done, the team went further south in Sarsuna to visit a couple of more pujas ? Sarsuna Uponagari Sarbojanin and Paschim Barisha Sarbojanin.

Fire fighting and electrical arrangements were more or less okay, with a few at 

a positional advantage over others due to the proximity to lakes or ponds.

Narrow approach roads that cause congestion in Haridevpur, no awareness about 

obligatory use of sound limiter, poor toilet facilities in some.

 Impression: A hotbed of themes ? from Naga traditions to cocoon collections, Hindu mythology to marble make-up ? has catapulted this zone into the must-visit bracket for Puja ?04. 

 If you think people don?t pandal-hop in the morning, just drop in here and find out how wrong you are. 

 Queues from morning to night mark this area. The spirit of social commitment shines through.

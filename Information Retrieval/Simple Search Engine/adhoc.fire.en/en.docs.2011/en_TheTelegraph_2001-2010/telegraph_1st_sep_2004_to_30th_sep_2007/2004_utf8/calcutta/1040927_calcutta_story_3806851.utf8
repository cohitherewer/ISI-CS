The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Over the past few years, air pollution has been on the rise in north Calcutta. 

While we keep celebrating World Environment Day with much fanfare every year, 

talks and seminars do not help much in curbing pollution. Besides being congested, 

the Maniktala, Moulali, Shyambazar and Hatibagan areas are the city?s most polluted 

spots. Anyone exposed to such pollution is sure to be afflicted with various diseases. 

It?s time the control board did its bit to keep the air clean.

 While entering the city from Howrah bridge, it is noticed that the railing 

along the road is used as a clothesline by the footpath-dwellers. It makes for 

an unpleasant sight and the heart of the commercial district looks shabby and 

appalling. People are found jostling for space on the roads, instead of footpaths, 

which are occupied by illegal eateries. The authorities are requested to take 

corrective steps and beautify the area.

 Many private companies are using roadside railings for putting up advertisement 

billboards and display boards. Has the transport department now leased out the 

railings to earn revenue? If not, what action is being taken against the advertisers?

 Subhamoy Ghosh, Salt Lake.

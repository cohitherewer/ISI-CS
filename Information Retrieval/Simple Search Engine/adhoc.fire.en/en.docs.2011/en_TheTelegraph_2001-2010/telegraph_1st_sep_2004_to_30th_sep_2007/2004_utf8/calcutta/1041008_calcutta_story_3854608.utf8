The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wet blanket on road repairs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the two days of rain that battered the city, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government and the civic authorities threw up their hands in exasperation on Thursday. 

 For, they realised that the road reconstruction they had planned in anticipation of an invasion of over a crore of Puja revellers would now have to be put on the backburner. 

 There are only 12 days left for the Pujas, and 25 dry days are necessary for a makeover.

 ?We cannot hastily put the programme into operation,? explained finance minister Asim Dasgupta. ?The roads cannot be touched till the water has fully receded and the surfaces are dry.? 

 Alarmed at the large-scale damage, the government will initiate measures to enable the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and different government agencies to carry out quick, skin-deep repairs before the Pujas, Dasgupta said. 

 ?The issue concerns a festival. About a crore of people come to Calcutta for Durga puja. We owe it to them,? Dasgupta said.

 Asked whether it was actually possible to complete road repairs before the Pujas, Dasgupta said it could be done if the CMC and the state government worked in tandem. 

 ?Let me see the weather forecast for the next 24 hours. We cannot start repairs on wet roads. It would mean a waste of resources. After allowing the roads about 48 hours to dry, we will get down to the job,? he stressed.

 A similar exercise was undertaken in 1999, when the government and the CMC had taken up repair work on a war footing before the festive season. The CMC roads department had then supplied hot mix from its plant to the public works department (PWD), which had used it to iron out the potholes. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee ruled out any exhaustive reconstruction of roads before the Pujas because the event was at hand. ?Our original plans had been to finish the work by this time, but the unexpected rain and the accumulation of water have robbed us of valuable time.?

 Some of the roads in a really pathetic state are Bidhan Sarani, MG Road, Rabindra Sarani, APC Road, Amherst Street, BB Ganguly Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Hazra Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Raja Subodh Mullick Road, Ganesh Chandra Avenue and Bagbazar Street.

 There are 1,500 km of roads in the city, of which 900 km are potholed. Even before the deluge, the streets were scarred with potholes that covered over 3.5 lakh sq m.

 This monsoon, the finance department has already released Rs 72 crore for road repairs in the city and the rural areas.

 On September 22, mayor Mukherjee had sanctioned Rs 25 crore for a pre-Puja mastic asphalt road repair scheme. 

 The CMC had released Rs 11 crore to initiate repair work in the first phase, but the rains have played spoilsport.

 Incidentally, the mayor?s announcement had come two days after Calcutta High Court pulled up the CMC, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and the PWD for the abysmal condition of roads. 

 The court had asked the three agencies to table details of repairs initiated within a fortnight.

 While the PWD did table a two-page report which the court found unsatisfactory, neither the CMC nor the CMDA have bothered to reply. 

 The court has summoned the PWD principal secretary, CMDA chairman and the municipal commissioner and the mayor-in-council of the CMC roads department to appear before it on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High road to hi-tech hub

 - Rs 6-crore plan to upgrade Saltlec infrastructure

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rattled by the roller-coaster ride down potholed roads in Saltlec, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on Monday unveiled plans to upgrade infrastructure at Bengal?s information technology hub.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, also chairman of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), said CMDA has been tasked with the maintenance and development of Salt Lake Bypass, connecting EM Bypass with Rajarhat New Town and the roads in Salt Lake Sector V, the electronic complex.

 The roads, till now maintained by the state urban development department, will be repaired soon, Bhattacharya said while commissioning the right-turn flyover at Chingrihata crossing on EM Bypass and Salt Lake Bypass.

 ?It (CMDA) has been asked to develop and beautify the roads in Sector V,? said Bhattacharya, voicing the government?s concern at the poor condition of infrastructure in the IT showcase. The government will spend Rs 6 crore on ensuring a smooth ride in the complex.

 ?We will hand over the project to some private company for a period of five years. They can later earn revenue by imposing charges,? the minister said.

 ?The roads in Sector V need major upgradation. We will be working out the details now,? said Alapan Bandyopadhyay, chief executive officer, CMDA.

 ?A host of multinational and Indian IT companies are coming here. We need improved infrastructure and roads to draw capital investment,? the chief minister said in his speech with heads of Indonesian multi-nationals Saleem and Ciputra groups by his side at the inaugural programme.

 Wipro?s new unit will be commissioned in Sector V on November 19. Companies like GE Capital, Oracle, Satyam and ITC Infotech are approaching the state government for land to start projects, Bhattacharjee said. He stressed the need for developing the Salt Lake Bypass. ?Once the link to Rajarhat New Town is complete, it will be a 20-minute drive from the airport to down town Calcutta,? he said.

 The ?S?-shaped, 570-metre flyover was completed in one-and-a-half years at a cost of Rs 9 crore by Tantia Construction. ?The flyover will solve the problem of traffic congestion at the Chingrihata-EM Bypass as well as Ultadanga crossings,? a CMDA official said. All airport-bound traffic will now use the flyover to enter Salt Lake Bypass.

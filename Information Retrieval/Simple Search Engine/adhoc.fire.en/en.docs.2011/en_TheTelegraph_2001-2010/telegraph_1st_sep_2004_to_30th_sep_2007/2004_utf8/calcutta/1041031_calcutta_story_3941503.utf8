The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Facelift focus on food, fitness

 ClubSandwich

 Lounge bar and pub nites, a grand 

 makeover for the relocated health club with sauna and jacuzzi, 

 aerobics and meditation, solar heating for the swimming 

 pool, a new-look beauty parlour, online billing?

 The Saturday Club, founded by 

 officers of the Calcutta Light Horse Regiment, is in refurbish 

 mode under the stewardship of new president Vijay Burman 

 and his team. And the focus is firmly on the youth.

 ?It?s extremely important to increase 

 footfall of youngsters at the club, since they have the 

 spending power and would help optimise the facilities. We 

 want our members? children to have a plethora of options 

 under one roof so that all their needs are addressed adequately,? 

 stresses Burman.

 To make GenX feel ?at home? on 

 the premises of 7 Wood Street ? assigned to the club for 

 a ?princely sum? of Rs 5 by John Carapiet Galstaun of 234/4, 

 Lower Circular Road in 1900 ? no effort is being spared. 

 Health and fitness, which drives business in new-age clubs 

 all over the world, is a thrust area, along with cuisine.

 To start with, the health club 

 is being shifted from the ground to the first floor (the 

 existing one will be converted into a beauty parlour), where 

 it will overlook the swimming pool on the one side and the 

 car park on the other.

 Latest gadgets, a yoga and meditation 

 centre, a juice bar and massage room would make the unisex 

 fitness pad among the best in town, the management promises. 

 ?We will also go in for solar heating of the pool next year, 

 which is perfect for Calcutta?s mild winter,? the president 

 says.

 Sports, a traditional strength 

 of Saturday Club, will gain fresh momentum as well. ?We 

 will upgrade our grassroots coaching programmes in badminton, 

 tennis and swimming and we intend to introduce bridge lessons,? 

 declares sports convenor Rajendra Kumar Sood. The club will 

 host the Saarc bridge tourney this winter besides an inter-city, 

 inter-club, multi-discipline sports meet.

 ?We want to increase member participation 

 in every sphere,? says the president. So, while the Antiquity 

 Bar is being converted into a lounge bar, eight new guest 

 rooms with built-in star comforts are being launched, complete 

 with an ornate lobby. For senior members, a special entertainment 

 evening is being planned, and the library ? said to be one 

 of the best in the club circuit ? is being computerised.

 Food is another core competence 

 the new management is keen to leverage. The emerald lawns 

 already house the Camelia tea bar and the popular vegetarian 

 food counter run by Gupta Brothers. Amber has also set up 

 shop with its signature kebabs and other Indian delicacies. 

 Now, the new committee is toying with the idea of introducing 

 a pizza counter as well.

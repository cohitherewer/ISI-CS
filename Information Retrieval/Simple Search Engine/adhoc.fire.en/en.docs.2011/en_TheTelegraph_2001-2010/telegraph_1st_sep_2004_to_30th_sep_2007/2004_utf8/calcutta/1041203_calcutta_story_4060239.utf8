 Car fume check takes a beating

 JAYANTA BASU

 With the state government busy finding excuses to defer the implementation of the new tailpipe emission norms, that came into effect nationwide from October 1, checking of vehicle fumes in the city has seen a drastic fall.

 The number of auto emission testing centres is on the decline ? those running them are increasingly turning to safer options such as shops or ATMs. The handful of centres left are getting far fewer cars for pollution check than they would six months ago. 

 The authorities have no clue to the cause. ?I don?t know the reason for the decline in the number of checked vehicles. Festive season and the yet-to-be-implemented norms are some of our guesses,? was what a public vehicle directorate official would say.

 With the city police?s anti-pollution wing ? yet to acquire the machines required by the new norms ? having all but stopped checking tailpipe emission, errant vehicles are having a free run at the expense of the Calcuttan?s lungs, and also lives.

 ?In the name of implementation of Euro II and other new norms, the existing norms are not being enforced,? alleged Subhas Dutta, amicus curie in an ongoing air pollution case in the high court. ?I have informed the court that whatever we have achieved in the field of vehicular pollution is being sacrificed,? he added.

 A random check of the test turnout shows: 

 ?AS Service Station, Bhowanipore, gets 10 cars daily, against 15 cars a few months ago 

 ?Carfill, near Deshapriya Park, gets 30 cars daily, against 45 to50 cars four months ago 

 ?Landsdown Service Station, off Elgin Road, has wound up its testing centre because of ?lack of viability?.

 ?Viability is, indeed, a problem for some of the testing centres,? admitted Asim Banerjee, secretary of the Association of Auto Emission Testing Centres. The number of functional centres in the city has come down from 94 to 70 over the past few months.

 ?There are around 10,000 testing centres in the country, with 400 in Delhi alone. It?s a concern that while at least 400,000 new cars have rolled on to Calcutta streets in the past five years, the number of testing centres has diminished,? said automobile and environment expert S.M. Ghosh.

 In Calcutta, hardly 18 per cent of the cars turn up for the customary pollution check. The corresponding figure in Delhi and other big cities is around 40. This low turnout, in turn, is making the fume-check business costlier and, hence, less attractive.

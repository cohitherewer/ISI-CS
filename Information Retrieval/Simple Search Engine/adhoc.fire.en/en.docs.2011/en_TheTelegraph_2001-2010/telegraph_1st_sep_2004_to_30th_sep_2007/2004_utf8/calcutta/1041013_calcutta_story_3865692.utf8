 Blacklist cloud on Alipore zoo

 - Watchdog 

may turn off funds tap 

 SWATI SENGUPTA 

ALONE AGAIN, NATURALLY: A lion-tailed macaque 

(top) and a black buck at Alipore zoo. The zoo authorities were advised to get 

them mates. The zoo says the macaque is too old to mate and a hunt is on for a 

suitable black buck 

 Press the panic button or prepare for the impending peril ?one of the oldest zoos in the country has to choose between the two.

 The Zoological Gardens of Calcutta, at Alipore, may be showcaused by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) if it fails to conform to a set of guidelines by the year-end. 

 This could be followed by the CZA putting up a notice at the entrance, ?Visit at your own risk?, and de-recognising the Alipore zoo. 

 Bipul Chakrabarty, CZA scientific officer, explained from Delhi: ?The recognition helps the zoo get funds from us for various projects. It also facilitates exchange of animals with other zoos in the country or abroad. If the zoo fails to comply with our stipulations by the year-end, we will be compelled to de-recognise it.? 

 While renewing the recognition in February 2003, the CZA had placed a series of conditions for the next renewal. The status report on compliance reads:

 4A curator should be appointed within six months for the upkeep of animals and maintenance of enclosures. Zoo director Subir Chaudhuri said the state government has been asked to create the post. The response is awaited.

 4The zoo was asked to procure mates for single and unpaired animals like the lion-tailed macaque, pig-tailed macaque and the black buck. 

 The deadline was six months, but the animals continue to remain single. 

 Chaudhuri said his officials are trying to get a mate for the black buck. The other two animals, he claimed, are past their prime and can no longer breed. 

 4The authorities were given six months to submit reports on their activities in 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02. The reports are still being compiled. 

 4The zoo was asked to set up natural enclosures for the primates, which are now kept in caged enclosures. Deadline: one year. 

 Chaudhuri said two open-air enclosures have been set up, but they are not spacious enough to house all primates at a time. So they are kept in open enclosures and cages by turn. ?We will explain the ground reality to the CZA,? the director added. 

 The zoo authorities were also directed to: 

 8Reduce the number of bonnet macaques from 18 and spotted deer from 63. Chaudhuri, too, admitted the number was far too many, ?but we have to arrange for alternatives before we can shift them?. 

 8Reduce the number of eateries on the premises. ?The process has been initiated. We have stopped renewing their licences,? was the director?s response. 

 A CZA team will visit the zoo this year-end to verify whether the conditions have been met. 

 ?Following the adoption of the National Zoo Policy in 1998, all major zoos are becoming professional. Compare Arignar Anna Zoological Park (Chennai) or Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Park (Mysore) with the Alipore zoo, and you will notice the difference,? said CZA scientific officer Chakrabarty. 

 ?The Alipore zoo also does not conduct educational activities for students,? he added. 

 Chaudhuri admitted this, but said steps are being taken to remove the drawbacks.

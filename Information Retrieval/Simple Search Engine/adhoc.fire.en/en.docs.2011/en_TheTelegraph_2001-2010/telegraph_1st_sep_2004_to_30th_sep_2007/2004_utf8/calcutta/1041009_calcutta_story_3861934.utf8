 Arjun: Muse and the music

 The last time Arjun Chakraborty showed a flash of his singing prowess was at a soiree hosted by Prosenjit at Nazrul Mancha, where he captivated the crowd with a soulful Kishore Kumar track. 

 Now, the actor is heart and soul into an album of Bengali songs, penned and composed by Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta. The six tracks to be sung by Arjun are punctuated by narrative, which is essentially a conversation between him and his muse called Mon Chai.

 ?It?s a very romantic album and we are trying to bring back the lost melody of the 70s and 80s. We will soon come up with a video album of this, too,? says Arjun, trained in Hindustani classical music, ghazal, geet and folk music.

Aparna Sen: Name game

 ?I had taken lessons from Pandit Jasraj when I was in Mumbai assisting Gulzar, but I couldn?t handle acting, direction and singing at the same time then,? he adds. In the pipeline is another audio album with lyrics by Gulzar.

 The most talked-about secret in Tollywood today is Aparna Sen?s next venture. A lot has been whispered about name game, producer problems and casting trouble, but now, finally, the word from the lady herself is that her next film is not called Goynar Baksho. 

 ?I will be starting a yet-untitled film, which would feature (daughter) Konkona, next January,? Sen told Metro. Watch this space for much more on the film.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A treasure trove of art

 Being involved with and influenced by various styles of Indian art has enabled Anju Chirimar evolve a style of painting that harmoniously amalgamates all she has learnt, while giving each work of art a character that is distinctively her own. The ongoing exhibition of Tanjore and Vrindavan paintings by Chirimar showcases exquisite works embellished with gold foil and semi-precious stones. Inspired by miniatures in Kangra and Tanjore styles, each one has been crafted to enhance the beauty of the painting, taking care to be true to the minute detailing of traditional methods. Intricately designed, ornamental Radha-Krishna paintings are on show to specially cater to the forthcoming wedding season. Also on display are Chinese paintings.

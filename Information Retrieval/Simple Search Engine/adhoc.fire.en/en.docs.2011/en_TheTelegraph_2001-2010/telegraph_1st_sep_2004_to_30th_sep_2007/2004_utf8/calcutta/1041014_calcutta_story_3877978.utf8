 Library scurry to go digital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The National Library has initiated a process to speed up the ongoing digitisation of the rare documents in its possession.

 Two senior officials of the library will visit Malaysia for training in the latest techniques of digitisation and preservation of documents. Library director Sudhendu Mandal said on Wednesday the officials will visit Malaysia in December and attend a weeklong workshop.

 The authorities have decided to preserve old manuscripts, many of which are disintegrating, through microfilming. The process had started about three years ago, but could not gain pace because of a lack of experts in the library.

 ?So, we have decided to send two of our senior officials to Malaysia, where they will glean the latest knowhow about microfilming,? Mandal said.

 The authorities were initially facing difficulty in sending the officials abroad, courtesy the Centre?s curbs on foreign tours. 

 ?I had assured the government that we would not have to bear the cost of the officials? stay there. The National Library of Malaysia had agreed to bear the cost. After this, the Centre cleared our proposal,? Mandal added.

 The officials ? M. Islam and Ashesh Ghatak ? will leave for Malaysia on December 6.

 Apart from attending the workshop on digitisation, the officials will also learn about maintenance and shifting of books and documents. ?We have instructed our officials to learn the art of shifting books and documents within a very short time. This is very important for us, because we have started shifting books from our old buildings to the newly-built Bhasha Bhavan,? the director informed.

 Around 10,000 reference books have been shifted to the new building. The reading room at Bhasha Bhavan has been thrown open to the public. 

 Cataloguing of all books at Bhasha Bhavan will be over by mid-2005, library director Mandal asserted.

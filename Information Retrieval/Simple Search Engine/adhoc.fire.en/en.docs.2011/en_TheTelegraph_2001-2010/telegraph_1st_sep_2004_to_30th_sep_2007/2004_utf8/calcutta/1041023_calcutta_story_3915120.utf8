 The festive fervour mellowed across town as Mahanavami wore off, bidding adieu to Devi Durga. 

 At the 60 housing complexes enlisted with The Telegraph Hand in Hand puja programme, families trooped into the pandals for the last line-up of events, some more adda and a final glimpse of the goddess on Friday. 

 Over the four days of fun-filled festivity ? Sashti to Navami ? The Telegraph programme saw the residents of the complexes flocking under one roof to interact, share and bond with each other. 

 At the 19-year-old puja at Auroville Apartment, in Mandeville Garden, residents of the 70 flats camped at the pandal for a string of contests.

 ?There were more participants than we could accommodate for most of the events. The fashion show was our biggest draw,? gushed Pratima Chakraborty, of Auroville.

 While the men of the housing estate showed great gusto in walking the ramp in dhotis and kurtas, the women rustled their chiffons and silks in great style. 

 But the show-stealers were definitely the bunch of 10 toddlers, who rocked the ramp to some foot-tapping music. 

 ?Even antakshari and spot quiz had the majority of our residents queuing up for a try,? added Chakraborty, who bagged the crown for best Dhunuchi Naach, beating five men. The fashion show pulled in the toddlers, teens and their parents at Hiland Park as well. 

 ?Even the conch-blowing contest had around 25 participants vying for the first prize. But the prettiest sight was men and women dancing with dhunuchis to the beat of the dhaak. There was something for everyone and no one felt left out,? added Joy Bhattacharya, of Hiland Park. 

 Next stop, Happy Nook, near Ruby General Hospital, where a similar scene prevailed, with entries flooding the organisers. ?You can imagine the rush when 15 families signed up for the Family of the Puja contest, which was a mixed bag of tough posers, extempore and singing sessions,? exclaimed Kushal Roy, one of the organisers. 

 The TTIS spot quiz and antakshari had a horde of high school students lining up to hold forth.

 Up north, group dance held centrestage at Koyla Vihar, on VIP Road. From Rabindrasangeet to Bollywood tracks, the young contestants impressed the audience with their creative flair.

 The problem of plenty plagued CMDA Housing in Barrackpore, too, where 38 teams, no less, registered for antakshari. 

 As several housing complexes wrapped up the contests on Navami, a hankering for more lingered in the air. But for now, it?s time for the curtains to come down.

 Light of hope for young inmates

 Sabina Khatun loves the colour red. The 10-year-old hums Jhilmiljhilmili jhilimili ? a tribal song she doesn?t know the meaning of ? while she paints. And this Diwali, she will be making a lot of lives brighter with her hand-painted wax-lamps. While she herself will merely crawl out of her room to the courtyard and look at the lights beyond.

 Sabina cannot walk. Born with lower limb problems, she is awaiting operations at the Rehabilitation Centre For Children (RCFC), Barisha, where she, along with fellow inmates, have been on a high this season, painting clay lamps. 

 In a project set rolling about three weeks ago, over a dozen physically handicapped and underprivileged children from Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal have been painting terracotta diyas, filling them with molten wax, adding glitter and making chodyopradip (14-lamp) platters for sale.

 Madhumita Halder, child development officer, RCFC, said: ?The children here have some kind of orthopaedic problem or the other. None of their families can afford proper surgery or therapy required for their treatment.? Arpita Chatterjee, programme coordinator, added: ?The children have been living here for months, in some cases years, and the lamp-making workshop is one of the many activities like pottery and tailoring which will prop them up economically, outside RCFC.? 

 But money was the last thing on the minds of the giggly group, aged between 10 and 14 , getting into the Diwali groove, with colours, brushes and wills to beat the odds. 

 Gabriel Tudu from Jharkhand and Gautam Mondal from the Sunderbans sat on a mat, dabbing golden paint on diyas, to be packed off for sale. ?I love painting, more than pouring wax. But I like to watch Shaktiman on TV best,? said Gabriel, a polio patient. For Gautam, born with a club foot, lamp-making is a bit of fun in his schedule of ?studying, singing, catching Bobby Deol on TV and physiotherapy?.

 ?The lamps, priced between Rs 2 and Rs 40, got terrific response from buyers,? said social worker Bandita Ray. 

 For Mary Hembrum and Mamata Mondol, and little Rajaram Das ? all with legs in braces, Diwali this time will be a little more than their favourite ?phooljhuri, chorki and tubri?. As for Sabina, nodding her pony-tailed head, and swaying to the beat of her own song, she knows the lights will shine a wee bit brighter this year.

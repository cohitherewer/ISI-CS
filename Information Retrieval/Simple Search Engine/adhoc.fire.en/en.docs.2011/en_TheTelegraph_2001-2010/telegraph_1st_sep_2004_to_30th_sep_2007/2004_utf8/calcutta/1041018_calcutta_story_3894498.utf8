 Jaharul Islam: Missing

 For exactly one long month, octogenarian Sheikh Karim Abdul has been waiting in his Prince Rahimuddin Lane home, in Tollygunge, for his 14-year-old grandson Sheikh Jaharul Islam to return. 

 The last time he met the bright young boy was when Jaharul had greeted him before going to school. He is yet to return. 

 His family members only hope that the boy is safe.

 The periods of worry are punctuated with moments of frantic urgency, when they receive the occasional anonymous calls. 

 The caller leaves instructions about where and how to pick up the boy, but on every occasion, Jaharul?s relatives have returned empty-handed. Even the administration could not help the grieving family. Police say they are helpless as there are no leads. 

 Jaharul?s father Sheikh Riazul Islam lives in Santoshpur with his wife, Rupsana Bibi, and their daughter, Buni. Jaharul was staying with his grandfather to continue with his studies. The self-employed Riazul used to lead a happy life with his small family, but his son?s disappearance has affected his mind and he has stopped working. 

 His nine-year-old daughter moves around aimlessly in search of her ?Laltu? bhaiya in the neighbourhood. 

 A Class VI pupil of Tollygunge Adarsha Vidyapith, Jaharul went missing on September 18. Since then, his family members have made inquiries with many relatives but none of them could furnish any information about the boy?s whereabouts. 

 Initially, Sheikh Karim refused to believe that Jaharul had been kidnapped. ?He was a meritorious boy and everybody loved him. He had no enemies. I cannot understand why anyone would kidnap him,? he mused.

 A week after Jaharul disappeared, his family received an anonymous phone call telling them to keep mum if they wanted their child back. 

 The next week, they received a similar call, but this time they went to Charu Market police station and lodged a missing diary. ?We went to Bhabani Bhavan but were told to contact Lalbazar. We did that on October 5, but there is still no sign of my nephew,? said Shiekh Umar, Jaharul?s uncle.

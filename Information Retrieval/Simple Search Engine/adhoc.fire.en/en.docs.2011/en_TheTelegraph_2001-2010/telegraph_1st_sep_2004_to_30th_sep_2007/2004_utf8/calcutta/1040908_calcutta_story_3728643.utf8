 Magician help for malaria control

 - Awareness programme on disease ahead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Alarmed at reports of a growing incidence of malaria, the civic authorities have decided to rope in magician P.C. Sorcar (Junior) for the awareness programme, slated for flag-off on September 14.

 We are disturbed at the reports. We have to do something very fast, said Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) officer on special duty (health) Atanu Mukherjee on Tuesday. People must be made aware of how the disease is spread. 

 The CMC has planned a month-long awareness campaign, to be flagged off jointly by the magician and mayor Subrata Mukherjee. A colourful tableau, depicting how the disease could be tackled, complete with cut-outs of the magician and his recorded appeals will move around the city for a month.

 Following the Centres intimation a few weeks ago that the assistance for malaria-control programmes in the city would be curtailed, the mayor has decided to approach corporate bodies for funds. The tableau will cost Rs 2 lakh. We have received generous assistance from certain pharmaceutical companies, special officer Mukherjee said. 

 This is the first time that the civic body is not getting central funds for the anti-malaria campaign. Last year, it had received Rs 22 lakh.

 The tableau will play this message of Sorcar Junior: I can make the Taj vanish and also a mail train, but I cant make mosquito or malaria disappear. Hence, to prevent malaria, change water in your house every six days, destroy breeding grounds of mosquitoes and use a mosquito net at night.

 Mukherjee said 100,000 leaflets will be distributed during the campaign. Civic health officials will address the public over the dos and donts in the fight against malaria. Health assistants will also collect blood samples from the public.

 The malaria cycle in the city peaks in September and continues till November. Last year, the disease had claimed 13 lives. This year, till August, two persons had died in malaria. 

 In August, more over 7,000 blood samples have been examined in 60 clinics run by the civic body. Malarial parasites were found in over 2,500 samples. Plasmodium falciparum, the variant that causes malignant malaria, was found in 76 samples.

 Responding to the CPMs allegation that the civic body is fudging figures on the spread of malaria and casualties, special officer Mukherjee said the number of malignant malaria cases has come down to a great extent because of peoples awareness. 

 He said that over the past three years, the CMC had carried out exhaustive awareness campaigns on malaria and breeding of mosquitoes. 

 Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said the government was stepping up its surveillance on malaria and had been insisting that people with fever go for quick blood tests. Early detection means early cure, and so this is a must, he said.

Behind the Bar

The brewing of beer is not new. Around 6,000 years 

ago, historians believe it first occurred, probably when a piece of bread or some 

wheat got wet and started to ferment. There?s been poems written about it, songs 

sang, festivals made for it and marriages broken? 

Octoberfest, the beer festival that may have started 

in Germany but now celebrated all over the world, was first held in 1810. It was 

a royal wedding celebration that carried on for five days. It was subsequently 

repeated by royal decree. 

During those times no beer was drunk. This only started 

in 1918 when a licence was given to sell beer. Soon after, every brewery in Munich 

got permission to sell beer during the festival and hence, this is what it?s known 

for today. 

Beer may come with all sorts of different names but 

it?s all just the same variation of fermentation of hops, wheat or other grains. 

These are the most common varieties:

ALE

Ales are often darker in colour than lagers, ranging 

from rich gold to reddish amber. Serve with stronger-flavoured foods. They are 

brewed with top-fermenting yeast at cellar temperature, and are fuller-bodied, 

with a tinge of fruit and spicy flavours, and a finish of hops. 

DRY BEER

These medium-golden beer taste less bitter, with little 

aftertaste, perfect with pasta or a light meal. They finish with a crisp and clean 

taste. 

LIGHT BEER

Light beers have less calories and alcohol content, 

the perfect accompaniment for spicy food, or appetisers. They are light in colour 

and body, with a mild flavour.

DRAUGHT BEER

Draught is any beer served from a keg or cask. They 

are characterised by freshness and are easy to drink. They come with lower carbonation 

levels and so are less filling than standard bottles or cans. 

MALT BEER

Higher in alcohol content, malt beers boast rich, 

full flavour and are heavier and sweeter than other beers. They can be any shade 

between deep gold to amber to firelight red. It goes with any cuisine.

ICE BEER

Ice beers pack in concentrated flavour with a smooth 

finish. During the brewing process, it is cooled until ice crystals form, then 

is filtered resulting in a higher alcohol content. Serve chilled, with seafood 

or poultry.

STOUT BEER

These are deep, dark brews, using highly roasted malts. 

Malt and caramel flavours dominate, from sweet to dry and distinctively bitter. 

Goes best with shellfish and stew.

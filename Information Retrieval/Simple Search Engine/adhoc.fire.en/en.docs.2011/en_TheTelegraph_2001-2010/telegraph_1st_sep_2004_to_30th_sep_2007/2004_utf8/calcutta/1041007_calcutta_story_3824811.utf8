 Rhythm divine as food fiesta hits pre-Puja celebrations

PRATIM D. GUPTA, HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 Newly weds Bikram Ghosh and Jaya Seal at 

the inauguration of Wok Inn

 This Puja, from the creators of 6, Ballygunge Place comes another restaurant that?s sure to tickle your tastebuds and leave you wanting more.

 If you thought that was cinematic, there was more filmi funda at the launch of Wok Inn, the new Chinese restaurant at Ganesh Chandra Avenue, on Tuesday evening. Having been the face of many a food festival, musician-turned-actor Bikram Ghosh strode into the eatery, for the first time with his wife Jaya Seal.

 A self-confessed ?foodie?, Bikram was happy with the variety the restaurant offered, even though he munched a couple of green chillies taking them for some exotic Oriental greens. After the flashbulbs rested, the Hothat Neera duo settled for a three-course a la carte dinner that included thick soups, lip-smacking starters and some spicy chicken and prawn items.

 You too can follow suit. Among the soups you can play safe with the Chicken or Vegetable Wanton Soup or be slightly more ambitious with the Saiwoo Har Thong ? a thick prawn and coriander soup with fried vermicelli. 

 For the starters, you are spoilt for choice. If you are a flesheterian, go for delicate Fried Chicken Wantons or the exotic Prawn Balls in Phoenix Nest (and be reminded of Valderamma?s mane). Spicy Crab Claws are a good option with its accompanying sticky chilli garlic sauce. Veggies need not despair with the presence of the Batter Fried Babycorn and Corn Pepper Salt on the menu card.

 The main course items at Wok Inn are equally fascinating. If you are feeling fishy, you can try the Steam Lemon Fish with the unmistakable flavour of oyster sauce. The Kung Pao Har (prawns cooked in rich soya and flavoured with Szechwan pepper) is highly recommended and so is the ?spicy and crunchy? Chicken Taipie, with its typically Bengali-sounding name.

 If you do not want to delve into the meat of the matter, the Conjee Crispy Vegetable is a must-have. You can also go for the Fried Vegetables with Almonds, stirred in sesame oil.

 For a sweet finish to your Chinese culinary conquest, order the Darsaan or experiment with the Toffee Banana, served with Ice Cream. A dinner for two at Wok Inn will set you back by around Rs 600.

 Tandoor try

 Sample some delectable Indian delicacies at Taaja?s, which is hosting a tandoor festival to mark the beginning of the festive season. The fiesta kicked off on Tuesday, inaugurated by actress Churni Ganguly, and has an exciting bill of fare including vegetarian and non-vegetarian grills.

 While options for the meat-eaters are mutton, chicken and fish, the green crowd can dote on their share of corn and paneer grills and stuffed goodies.

 Besides the usual Kakori Kebab and Murg Malai Kebab, interesting names have also found their way onto the menu. Sample the Dhania Nariyal Murg Seekh Kebab or order the Buffalo Chilli Chicken, which surely did not come from any Mughal platter but is superb nonetheless.

 The two options in fish include Apna Machchi Kebab and Khatti Meethi Machchi Kebab. The bharwan or stuffed kebabs in the vegetarian section are a must try even for the non-veg lot.

 Moon magic

 If the Trojans used a wily wooden horse to take Troy, the Oriental strategy for deceit was somewhat sweeter. The Chinese festival of Autumn Moon is a nod back to the Mongolian reign, when moon cakes were apparently used to pass on secret attack plans.

 The festival commemorates the day the Chinese regained power and the memory of a war well won, besides the usual cause of the harvest season. It also brings with it the moon cake and an elaborate feast.

 Mainland China has joined the celebrations with a modified menu to treat the Chinese-junkie Calcuttan to some new flavours. A long research process and some extensive travelling by executive chef Dubey has resulted in a spread that is sure to impress even the harshest food critic.

 Sample the One Hundred Corner Crab Cakes with Pineapple Sauce for starters and dig into a treasure trove of lamb, squid, prawn, chicken, duck and bekti. 

 The cumin flavoured Grilled Bekti is already the most popular starter with regulars, according to the management.

 Some of the dishes provide as much of a feast for the eyes as for the tummy, like the double-coloured fried rice.

 There is enough for the vegetarian diner as well, with options like Crispy Shredded Eggplant with Dry Red Chilli and Assorted Vegetables in Black Pepper Sauce, among others. Cap it all off with ? what else ? some delightful cake.

 The festival is not to be missed, and is on for both lunch and dinner till October 10.

 Festive feast

 Trinca?s has beaten everyone to menu planning for the four days of the Durga Puja. It has unveiled its take on Pujor Khabar, which it will start laying out for the Calcutta foodie right from Mahalaya on Wednesday till Lakshmi Puja, when the festive mood finally begins to dip.

 ?The menu we have planned for the festive season explores favourites from Bengali, Chinese and tandoori cuisine,? said a Trinca?s spokesperson. 

 The accent is on those dishes that the city loves to eat when celebrating, like the ever-popular Chingri Cutlet. While you have the regular noodles and fried rice on the menu, you can also dig into some subtle innovations, like Chingri Manchurian for instance.

 Delicacies from the tandoor have forever been a hit at this eatery and have been retained on the festive menu to keep regulars happy.

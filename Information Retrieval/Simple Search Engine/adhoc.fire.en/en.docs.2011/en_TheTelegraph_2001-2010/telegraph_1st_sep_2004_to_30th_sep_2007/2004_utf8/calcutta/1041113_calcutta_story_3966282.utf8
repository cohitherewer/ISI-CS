Desi design?s distant dream

Ritu Rules 

Indian fashion should further its distinctive handwriting, not strive to be on 

a par with world style, feels Ritu Kumar

I have been often asked the question ?When will India 

make a dent in the international fashion world ?? My usual answer is: ?This is 

an unreal dream.The present nascent Indian fashion industry cannot even remotely 

? not with its present infrastructure ? become a Dior or Chanel.? This answer, 

I know, is not a popular one. 

Our media would love to compare an Indian designer 

to a Louis Vuitton or Armani. This is unfortunately simply wishful thinking. Financially, 

Indian fashion does not have what it takes to go international. It is not a matter 

of talent, it is one of logistics. International fashion is today largely owned 

by big multinationals with very deep pockets. The labels, and subsequently the 

brands like Cartier or Dior, were at one time started as designer studios. Very 

much like Indian enterprises today, these were led by a small team, usually family 

owned. 

Retail was more in the nature of mom-and-pop stores. 

Today that has changed substantially. Many established erstwhile designers like 

Dior, YSL and Gucci are no longer family held enterprises. Over the last few decades 

they have been bought out and are owned by multinationals. These companies sometimes 

buy out a number of labels. Their large turnovers come from branding and retailing 

ready-to-wear, accessories and cosmetics. These fashions and luxury goods are 

marketed around the world from Japan to Mexico and have become the world?s recognised 

luxury brands irrespective of the climate and societies where they are sold. 

I would like to explain the difference between our 

indigenous fashion and that perpetuated by these large conglomerates which rule 

world fashion. There is an unreal uniformity with which the world outside India 

dresses. In a very professional way this is brought about by using the publicity 

machinery to influence and dictate styles. The season?s colours are predicted, 

the looks of the fabrics and accessories are defined. The basic premise is that 

wardrobes should become dated with every season. The media feeds the consumer 

with the concept of obsolescence and aspiration dressing ? a completely different 

world to the one that exists in India. 

In India, with few exceptions, couture means one of 

a kind garments, catering mainly for the festive season and the wedding markets. 

This bears little resemblance to international couture. Unlike India, most international 

fashion houses design couture garments purely to make a splash in the media. With 

the shrinking of a couture clientele, these departments are the R amp;D centres 

of the brand. The publicity generated around the fashion shows and the show stoppers 

produced by these departments are theatrical and wildly expensive. This bi-annual 

exercise normally ensures that the department is always in the red. This expenditure 

is justified as it is used to enhance the brand and increase the hype generated. 

The Indian fashion industry has created a myth around 

itself, which needs to be demystified. The achievements of the industry are not 

substantial in a financial way. But in India we have successfully bridged the 

gap between traditionalism and modernity. We have also gone a long way in redefining 

the term ?fashion? in the Indian context. 

Most importantly, the fashion community has demonstrated 

that hand-crafted work can be as profitable, and perhaps even more glamorous, 

than that of machine. Indian fashion is more than capable of holding its 

own in the international arena of haute couture. 

Having said that, Indian fashion cannot match the 

pret market of international designers, at least not yet. Manufacturing and designing 

sportswear, leisurewear, or corporate wear require a large infrastructure and 

financing. With few exceptions, most designers in India do not work on a pret 

collection. The garments are based on the skills of India?s textile craftspeople. 

They are more in the nature of handicraft items. 

When the media talks about fashion it is referring 

to designers who operate from small studios and farm out work to various craftsmen. 

I am speaking of a sector which is more of a cottage industry than a corporate 

retail and manufacturing giant. The fact that this sector is not very organised 

and has a modest turnover makes it all the more interesting. 

It is surprising to see the inordinate column space 

and electronic media hype that is associated with Indian fashion. This huge media 

hype does not really match up with the turnovers that most of the designers manage 

to achieve. 

Outside India, the NRI market is really the only one 

for Indian clothes. Unlike what is perceived, there is no real frenzy for Indian 

fashion in the western world. Cyclically India comes into fashion every few years. 

This is a fashion inspiration and does not mean that the sari is in fashion. It 

usually translates into Indian paisleys prints, mirror work embroidery etc being 

hot fashion news for a while. These products are made in the European studios 

and are not all fabricated in India, but can be done anywhere from Italy to China. 

The most positive aspect of Indian design today is 

that it has maintained its identity. We are perhaps the only country in the world 

which retains a handwriting which is indigenous. With the advent of expanding 

malls and retail spaces, the multinational brands will provide competition to 

India?s designers. The designer fraternity in India must understand its strengths 

and capabilities. Comparison with international names like Versace and Armani 

is like talking of two very different things. One is a multinational size of operation, 

the other one has not even begun. 

I hope the talent and versatility of Indian design, 

helped largely by the crafts of the country, will help it survive. To exist Indian 

fashion needs to further explore the needs of India and its retail climate. We 

have to further develop that famous indigenous handwriting and not strive to become 

what we are not.

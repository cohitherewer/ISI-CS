The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 On Monday, Mumbai traffic came to a standstill when Akshay Khiladi Kumar was seen talking a walk along the ledge of a 24-storey building! And he wasn?t doing another of his He-Man stunts for a forthcoming film. It was the action hero?s way of highlighting the health hazard India is facing. As the Good Heart ambassador for The Institute of Preventive Cardiology Foundation (first of its kind in India founded by Dr Pratiksha Namjoshi), Akki has tied up with STAR to promote awareness about prevention of heart attacks through STAR 7827.

 According to Akshay: ?The statistics are truly frightening ? every 30 seconds, one person in India dies of a heart disease. Today, around 6 crore people in India are affected with heart ailments. According to the World Health Organisation, in just 10 years from now, 60 per cent of all heart patients worldwide would be from India. If today?s youth are not careful about their health, they are going to be the worst affected.?

 To support this cause, all you have to do is SMS ?heart? to 7827. Out of every one rupee (the SMS cost), STAR will donate 25 paise to this cause. Every time you send an SMS, an automatic reply message will give you a tip to take care of your heart. Also, a 30-second commercial, specially shot with Akshay, will go on air from October 1 and kick-off a nation-wide SMS signature campaign to support the cardiac cause.

Natalie Portman: Rising star

 Natalie Portman?s soft brown eyes and gentle smile endeared her to millions when as a 13-year-old she played a troubled and orphaned teenager being looked after by an assassin who took pity on her. Her debut in Leon (also called The Professional) set the stage for a career in Hollywood and catapulted her into the Star Wars spotlight.

 Born Natalie Hershlag (Portman was grandmother?s maiden name) in Jerusalem on June 9, 1981, the only child of a doctor father and an artist mother moved to the US at three. The roles she has played are as diverse and contradictory as her name ? she?s a Jew with a name that derives from the Latin version of Christmas Day, Natale Domini.

 This beauty has brains in abundance, having been an A-grade student all through school and completed four years in Harvard. Acting was an act of fate triggered by a chance encounter with an agent in a pizza parlour. Although pushed towards modelling at first, she chose acting and hasn?t looked back since Leon, in 1994.

 It was Star Wars Episode I ? The Phantom Menace, however, that made her a household name in 1999. Queen Amidala, now married to Anakin Skywalker, is busy filming the third episode (Revenge of the Sith), due for release next year. But you can catch her in Star Wars Episode II ? Attack of the Clones on Star Movies, on Wednesday, at 9 pm.

 That?s before The Garden State (co-starring Zach Braff, it released this July in the US) invades a DVD store near you ? and perhaps the big screen.

 The lovely Natalie, meanwhile, has several other offbeat projects up her sleeve. This includes Closer, revolving around the relationship between two couples and The Smoker, about a student who wants to marry her English teacher because they?re the perfect pair, not because she?s in love.

 She also makes an appearance in Paris, j?taime (Paris, I Love You), in which five-minute sequences by 20 film-makers will be woven together in an ode to the city of love and to cinema. In True, the short by German director and composer Tom Tykwer, Natalie plays the girlfriend of a blind man. Her fans sure have a lot to talk about.

Jay Leno: Take talk

 The Americans may be known for their money-making prowess, technology and patriotism, but sensitivity and knowledge about the rest of the world aren?t qualities even their greatest admirers would attribute to them. And it?s not just the common man, but even the media hardly seem to be any different.

 Take last Sunday?s The Tonight Show hosted by Jay ?big chin? Leno, on CNBC. The well-built Italian-American, in his monologue, touched on the Cat Stevens incident in which the singer, who became a Muslim and changed his name to Yusuf Islam, was denied entry into the US because his name matched a suspected terrorist?s and his flight was re-routed to Maine.

 But did Leno ridicule the American paranoia? Not a chance. He cracked a stupid joke on losing to Maine in some game and followed that up with a take on Stevens? converted surname: ?With a last name like Islam??

 More intelligent humour: ?The authorities should have checked before allowing him to board and not while deplaning.?

 The live audience, as usual, was in splits. It wasn?t, of course, the first time Leno let the Cat out of the compassion bag. Tuning into the show in times of American belligerence can often make Delhi belly seem a mild affliction.

 In case of Stevens, Time has now revealed that his deportation was the result of a ?spelling error?. If you think that?s an administrative guffaw, the joke is surely lost on Leno.

 It?s in times like these that you thank the stars for talk-show hosts like Shekhar Suman. You might have to bend to pick up the jokes (they?re so low), but at least taking pot-shots at the powers that be is a constant.

 It?s about a horror fiction writer poised on the knife-edge of insanity and a young book editor who is going bonkers trying to keep himself on this side of sanity. Little surprise then that the show is aptly titled Stark Raving Mad. This is not the film, but the television show, aired on Star World on Sundays at 7 pm.

 Tony Shalhoub (remember him in his Emmy Award-winning role as the obsessive compulsive detective Monk?) is manic author Ian Stark and Neil Patrick Harris (the genius 16-year-old doctor in the 90s series Doogie Howser, M.D.) is the young book editor Henry McNeely, new on the job and way out of his depth in the chaos.

 True to American sitcom tradition, there?s a pretty waitress and a dog, Edgar, to add some spice. Creator Steven Levitan, of Just Shoot Me (weeknights on Star World) and Fraser fame came up with the concept after Stephen King admitted to hearing voices in his head telling him to write.

 The show premiered on NBC in the US in September 1999, and has since been described as crazy, batty, loony, neurotic and many others of the like. It you?re in the mood for some frenetic fun, don?t miss it. Stark Raving Mad came to India this month, so you haven?t lost too much.

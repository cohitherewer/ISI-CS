The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

Pop patriotism set on a different pitch

Bhuvan?s battle has long been won. Now it is the turn 

of Mohan Bhargava to take strike at the box-office. Ashutosh Gowariker?s new film 

has opened to 98 per cent at INOX and 83 per cent collection at 89 Cinemas in 

the first weekend.

Monitoring matters in office till late evening over 

the post-release weekend, Gowariker sounds composed. ?The feedback has so far 

been positive. People have not yet got over Lagaan. The expectation is 

so high that they are going in expecting another Lagaan, with all its excitement, 

and are getting pleasantly surprised. But they are liking what they are seeing. 

The word of mouth should be positive.?

A phenomenal number of viewers seem to have been given 

the chance to catch the first day first show. Overseas, for instance, a record 

275 prints were sent, overtaking even Yash Raj Films? Veer-Zaara which 

created history by exhibiting 250 prints. Gowariker, though, refuses to accept 

this as a strategy to cash in on the excitement of the premiere.

?We send out the prints as per the requirements of 

each centre,? says Gowariker, quick to link the overseas demand to Shah Rukh Khan?s 

popularity. In fact, he has no qualms to admit that ?though theoretically the 

director is the captain of the ship?, to the man on the streets (be it Madison 

Avenue or Maniktala) it is SRK?s star value that appeals much more than Gowariker?s 

Oscar tag. 

After the run-a-ball excitement of Lagaan, 

speculation has been rife on whether Gowariker has chosen an issue too serious 

for comfort. Though the popular verdict is awaited, Gowariker is confident. ?The 

film is about realising one?s immediate responsibilities vis-a-vis one?s surroundings 

? be it a big city, a town or a village? and the steps we need to take to rectify 

the situation.?

In this context, Mohan Bhargava, Shah Rukh?s character 

who returns home leaving his NASA job in the US ?to light a bulb? in his village, 

does bring home a message to non-resident Indians ? ?Stop, pause, look back, see 

how you can contribute and use your experience for your homeland?. 

Gowariker admits that he would be thrilled if his 

film was to inspire even one person in his overseas audience do a Mohan Bhargava. 

?But braindrain is not the only issue here. Swades deals with labour drain. 

The migration from village to city too has the same impact. I would be happy if 

even one per cent of the villagers were to stay back and find avenues of employment.?

Though Aamir Khan gave him a lease of life by agreeing 

to produce Lagaan and Bhuvan gave him the ticket to fame, Gowariker says 

he was not his first choice for Swades. ?After Bhuvan, his screen image 

was too large. Before the transformation, Mohan Bhargava is absolutely wayward. 

Aamir?s screen image is of a resolved, thinking person. That is not what Mohan 

started off as. Rather, Shah Rukh has a flippant, carefree irresponsible persona, 

which fits the character.?

Whatever be his screen image, Shah Rukh draws a pat 

on the back from his director for being ?obedient? (?he believes in the script 

and the director?). So once he took over the megaphone, there was no problem in 

dealing with his co-actor in Chamatkar and Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa.

Having done two consecutive films with the two big 

Khans, the comparison is inevitable. For Gowariker, Shah Rukh is the spontaneous 

one. ?He adds layers to a role while shooting. Aamir would listen to the script, 

get all his doubts cleared and questions answered before setting foot on the set.? 

Both, though, are equally great actors who are capable of translating depths of 

emotions to the screen. ?So, for the viewer, the end product is the same.?

If the rest of the cast in his film comprises newcomers 

(including heroine Gayatri Joshi), the move is deliberate. ?Shah Rukh as Mohan 

is entering a new world to meet new people. I want my audience to do the same.?

Though the Hindi film industry is experiencing a new 

wave since the turn of the millennium, Gowariker thinks Lagaan would have 

succeeded even at the time he burnt fingers in direction with Pehla Nasha (1993) 

and Baazi (1995). ?If everything is there in the right proportions, the 

audience will always be ready for a film. Great movies come before their time. 

Can you set a date for Mother India or Mughal-e-Azam to work?? he 

counters.

A huge poster of Satyajit Ray greets visitors at Gowariker?s 

office. ?I am a director of observation. I draw inspiration from many directors. 

Charulata, Goopi Gyne..., Nayak, the Apu trilogy? I love 

the way Ray captures realism and I hope to convey the same accuracy and poignancy 

of feeling.? ?It is very difficult,? he adds after a pause.

If there is one quirky area where Gowariker has touched 

his inspiration, it is in lending his voice to the soundtrack. If Ray was the 

voice of the Bhooter Raja in Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne, Gowariker is the Ravana 

in the Ramleela song. ?It was being recorded on the sets in Panchgani. 

Javed saab (Akhtar) and A.R. Rahman were there and we had asked the singers 

Vijay and Madhushree over. I was the only available voice for the rap lines. Now, 

it?s fun to hear my voice in cabs.?

Just as Gowariker the rapper was born by chance, the 

permission to shoot at NASA came ?purely by luck?. ?I had sent the script to them 

along with the request. The communication officer loved it and invited me over 

to choose the location. They rarely allow even Hollywood crew in. I think Swades 

is the first film to be shot at Goddard Space Center and the third at Kennedy 

Space Center. We shot while work was in progress and the scientists and office 

staff on duty worked as our extras.?

The Gowariker-SRK association dates back to 1990 when 

they worked together on TV scripts and submitted separate projects at Mandi House. 

Both were rejected. Time will tell if the combination works on the big screen.

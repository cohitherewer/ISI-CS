 Diwali threads, designer style

Purple, a garments and accessories boutique, opened 

recently, in time for the Diwali shopping season. 

 Started by sisters Mona and Pooja Nihalani, the Ballygunge outlet has a range of western, Indo-western and ethnic clothes, as well as footwear, bags and jewellery.

 The sisters? ?dream of 20 years? became a reality in just a fortnight, when the retail space opposite Ice Skating Rink suddenly fell into their lap. ?For two weeks, we have been working day and night to get things done as fast as possible,? explain the duo.

 With an eye on the women?s wear market, between the ages of 15 and 35 years, the clothes are young and vibrant. An in-house line shares rack space with sourced garments, mainly from Mumbai. 

The Purple label is in bright shades, embellished 

with beadwork, stones and embroidery on silks, georgettes and crepes. Kurtas, 

skirts with bold prints, denims, trousers and tops (picture above by Pabitra Das) 

comprise most of the collection.

 The store has been designed as a one-stop shop. ?Buyers like to mix and match and accessorise before they make their final purchase, which is why we decided to stock everything they might want,? they add. Particularly attractive is a Thai-inspired line of mother of pearl jewellery set in silver. The footwear range includes beaded mojris in a number of colours.

Menu mix

 Golden Harvest on Lansdowne Road has undergone a revamp. The makeover includes everything from crockery and glassware to chefs.

 The restaurant, under the wing of Talat Ahmed and P.C. Rao, has started an economical lunch buffet of Chinese and Indian food.

 Apart from the main dishes and a variety of soups that change each day, there is a live salad and chaat counter. While Mondays feature Chilli Chicken and Singapore Noodles, Wednesdays have Murgh Moti Tikka and Szechwan Chicken, weekends are rounded off with Prawns in Chilli Oyster Sauce and Tandoori Chicken. 

 All this comes priced at Rs 175 through the week, with a complementary lager or canned beer thrown in.

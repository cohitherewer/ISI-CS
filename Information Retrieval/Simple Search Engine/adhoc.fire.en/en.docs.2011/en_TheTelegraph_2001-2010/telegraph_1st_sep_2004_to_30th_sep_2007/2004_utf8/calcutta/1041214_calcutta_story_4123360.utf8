 Third college suicide in a year 

 - BE campus in turmoil, scurry for stress-buster

 A STAFF REPORTER

 BE college has been shaken by the third suicide of a student this year.

 Shiladitya Sengupta, 22, a third-year student of electrical engineering at Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur campus, popularly known as BE college, was found hanging in his room early on Monday.

 ?Shiladitya was found hanging in his single-occupancy room in Wolfenden hostel,? said Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee, vice-chancellor of the university. A post-mortem is being conducted by the police.

 With examinations on, hostel residents were up late on Sunday. At about 12.30 am, one of Shiladitya?s batch-mates went looking for him to exchange notes. 

 Finding the room locked from inside, he peered in and raised an alarm. The college authorities were informed and the door was broken down. The boy had hanged himself from a metal window frame. No suicide note was found. 

 According to Goutam Banerjee, head of the department of electrical engineering, Shiladitya was a good student, but ?prone to depression?.

 On January 26, Bisweswar Hazari, a 21-year old telecommunication engineering student and a resident of Ghatal, in West Midnapore, committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan in his hostel room. The college authorities said he had been suffering from depression.

 On February 12, Anthony Sugaijam, 21, a student of architectural engineering from Imphal, Manipur, was found hanging in his hostel room from the ceiling fan. A suicide note revealed that Anthony was upset after his proposal for marriage was thwarted.

 The latest death sent ripples of alarm through the college. While the authorities blamed the ?weak psychology? of the students concerned, students blamed faulty administration.

 The authorities had decided to create a ?personality development? programme for students. 

 Counselling facilities to face interview boards, stress management, depression and other emotional problems was to be started.

 ?The counselling centre is yet to be set up,? one of the students complained. Medical facilities on campus are also allegedly inadequate.

 According to the vice-chancellor, a part-time counsellor had been appointed, but was not available at the present time because of exams.

 ?We are exploring alternative methods of increasing interaction with students so they feel comfortable. We will also promote sports and other extra-curricular activities to ease tension,? said Banerjee.

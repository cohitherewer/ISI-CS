 Pearls for charity, diamonds to prize

 Silks rustled and pearls gleamed at an evening dedicated to education for the underprivileged. The terrace garden at Taj Bengal was tastefully lit up on Thursday evening for a charity dinner hosted by Tata Council for Community Initiatives (TCCI). The city?s industrialists and social butterflies got an eyeful of a glittery fashion show, soft music from Carlton Pereira and New Identity and wine glasses topped up with regularity.

 The proceeds will go to the Nabadisha programme, an undertaking involving a number of agencies to provide basic education to underprivileged children and bring them under the umbrella of mainstream schools.

 ?Our aim is to improve life in certain parts of society, provide kids with a kind of sanctuary. It does not matter how much money is donated by each person. After all, any amount is bound to have a multiplier effect,? said Percy Siganporia of TCCI.

 Police have played a key role in the project, providing space and infrastructure on thana grounds in a number of locations across the city.

 Anchor Cyrus Madan warmed up the evening with a dash of humour. He introduced each of the three sequences of the fashion show with anecdotes about the lasting connection between women and jewellery ? more specifically, fashionable ladies and pearls.

 A. Sirkar?s South Sea Pearls collection was being offered at an impromptu 10 per cent discount on the occasion, and a percentage was also being given to the Nabadisha cause.

 South Sea Pearls are also known as Rolls Royce Pearls, considered to be amongst the world?s most valuable. Derived from the species of giant molluscs known as pinetada, maxima or silver lip oyster, they are found anywhere between Australia and Japan and can weigh up to five kg. Though found in a variety of colours, the most prized are the silver, black and gold. Some fashionable drops and necklaces flaunting these were displayed before an impressed audience.

 The show itself was tastefully organised, despite having no professional choreographer. The first sequence featured four models adorned in all-black outfits (skirt, dress, trousers and sari), weaving through the tables to show how the precious pearls can be worn with both traditional and trendy styles. The second sequence saw white as its theme. The final round was a combination of black and white.

 Show over, the night was still young, and the crowd lingered to mingle, wine and dine as the music played on. 

 Stone stun

 B.C. Sen Jewellers? Festival Bonanza 2004 will come to an end with a bang at the Pala in ITC Sonar Bangla on Saturday. For the shoppers of the season, one of the key incentives will be the grand lucky draw, wherein the winner will walk off with a specially crafted diamond necklace. The second prize is going to be a gold necklace, while the third is a pair of gold kangans. For those who don?t get a chance to win these coveted prizes, there are consolation prizes comprising 10 diamond rings and pendants each.

 This apart, the jewellery house will showcase its winter collection. ?The theme this time is a combination of semi-precious stones with citrines, tourmalines, peridot and hessonites that have been designed to fuse avant garde creativity with style and panache,? says S. Laha, a spokesperson.

 Walking down the ramp in these colourful jewels will be Mumbai models Alicia Raut and Cheryl Vaz, among other top Calcutta models.

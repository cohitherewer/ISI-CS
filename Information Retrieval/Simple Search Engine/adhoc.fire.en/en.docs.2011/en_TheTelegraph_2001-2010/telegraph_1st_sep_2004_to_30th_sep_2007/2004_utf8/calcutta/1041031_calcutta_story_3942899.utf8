Malls are registering massive footfall and cash registers are ringing loud, what with everyone scurrying to give themselves and their homes a revamped look in the run-up to the festival of lights.

 Gone are the days when the carpenters? market on BB Ganguly Street was the ultimate home-art shopping destination. The spotlight has now shifted to designer furniture stores like Dzone and Furniturewalla. 

 Dzone, the Italian lifestyle furniture store on AJC Bose Road, has come up with a mega shopping bonanza this festive season. ?Most people come out to shop during this time of the year.

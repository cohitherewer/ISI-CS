 Sarah: Till we meet again

 Calcutta bid goodbye to Buffy the Vampire Slayer 

on Thursday night with an action-packed two-hour series finale. The Star World 

show has seen seven seasons of Sarah Michelle Gellar and gang battling the evil 

forces in Sunnydale. From teenaged high-school students in an institution that 

just happened to be on the Hellmouth, the players had grown into powerful warriors 

(including vampires, witches, demons and the Slayer, of course) who destroyed 

the town to keep the dark forces at bay. And, of course, save the world.

 But this might not be the end of Buffy Summers. There has been some talk of reviving her for another film (the TV series, in fact, was inspired by a movie), though Sarah has expressed reservations about such a project for fear of ?disappointing fans?. There are also some plans of recreating her in an animated series.

 For fans of the petite actress, who was voted the sexiest woman in the world way back in 1999, there is much to look forward to. Scooby Doo has a sequel out, horror flick The Grudge has just been released and she is working on two new projects ? Southend Tales and Happily N?Ever After, an animated film where she voices the role of Cinderella.

Shah Rukh: Just incredible

 Well, you won?t see him in his first Hollywood flick, you will just hear him. Shah Rukh Khan will be lending his vocal talent to the Hindi version of Disney/Pixar?s animation action adventure The Incredibles. What?s more, Hum Hain Lajawab (as it is called) will find SRK son Aryan as the voice of Tez, who plays the son of Mr Lajawab, King Khan?s character in the film. 

 Shah Rukh is all excited about the new challenge: ?My son saw the stills and commented that only a real hero would do this film. When SPE Films India approached me I just had to take it up. This is also the first time my son Aryan and I will be working together and he is thrilled to be a part of this project.?

 Partnering SRK is Javed Jaffery who not only lends his voice to the character of Sankiman but has also written the dialogues for the Hindi version.

 If you are wondering who are the Hollywood counterparts of Khan and company, well, they are some of the best around ? everyone from Holly Hunter to Samuel L. Jackson. The film, produced by John Walker and directed by Brad Bird, releases across India on December 17.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Price brake on revelry 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Still heady with the post-Puja hangover, Calcuttans were in for a shock on Tuesday, a day before Lakshmi puja ? the market prices were on fire.

 ?After all the shopping and revelry, family finances are at a low. So, I was really taken aback when I went to the market and found that the prices of the vegetables had shot through the roof,? said Paresh Basu, a resident of central Calcutta. 

 ?With a single coconut costing Rs 23, it?ll be difficult to arrange for a vegetarian bhog that is required during Lakshmi puja,? he lamented.

 According to wholesalers, the markets are still reeling under the effects of the rains that lashed the state from October 8. 

 ?Vegetables were destroyed because of the deluge, and our stocks have been dwindling fast for the past fortnight,? said Jaffer Ali, a wholesaler in Koley market. 

 The demand for vegetables and fruits has more than doubled as the holy month of Ramazan has coincided with the Pujas, Ali added. 

 Besides, the rain has also affected the quality of the vegetables in stock. 

 ?Post-Dashami, the markets saw a lull on Monday but sales picked up phenomenally on Tuesday. Fresh vegetables, however, will not hit the city before Kali puja,? Ali said.

 So, city dwellers are forced to buy vegetables at a premium. A small cauliflower, which generally costs Rs 4-5, is now priced at Rs 12-15.

 The price of potato has gone up a couple of rupees per kg from the usual Rs 8 per kg.

 Other vegetables affected include:

Parwal: Rs 30 kg (normal price Rs 12-15)

Brinjal: Rs 25-30/kg (normal price Rs 15)

Ladies? Fingers: Rs 20-25/kg (normal price Rs 10)

Radish: Rs 20/kg (normal price Rs 10)

Spinach: Rs 25/kg (normal price Rs 10)

Green peas: Rs 60/kg (normal price Rs 30)

Sim: Rs 50/kg (normal price Rs 20)

Tomato: Rs 25/kg (normal price Rs 15)

Green pepper: Rs 40/kg (normally available for Rs 20)

Coconut: Rs 20-25 per piece (normal price Rs 8-10)

Cucumber: Rs 30/kg (normally available for Rs 10)

 Sandip Banerjee: How does the foreign standard certification mark comply with the global standards? Does the belief that foreign products are more durable have any basis?

 Every country has its own certification standards. But sometimes we use the IS (International Standard) symbol which is accepted internationally since several countries, like the Netherlands, Germany and China, have joined hands to set up a common standardisation norm. 

 The advantage of the IS method of certification is that two parties from different countries can be satisfied with the quality of the product on its basis when they enter into a contract. For example, the BIS follows Quality System Certification under the IS/ISO 9000 series of standards accredited by Raad voor Accreditatie (RvA) of the Netherlands, which is widely accepted across the world. Now, if an Indian IS/ISO 9000 company gets an opportunity to provide services to another country, it can easily do so without going through the certification tests of that country.

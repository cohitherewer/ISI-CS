 Flotsam and jetsam of the West

 Several artists from different regions of India have, over a period of time, visited institutions in the UK on the Charles Wallace and Commonwealth Scholarships. 

 They wished to resuscitate their practice with fresh ideas in currency in the West and absorb these varied influences without aping them. 

 But the current exhibition, The Art Connection, jointly organised by the Birla Academy of Art and Culture and the British Council, proves that the effect of such short-term exposure may not always be very happy or desirable. For, the problem that Indian artists may face in an alien and advanced country is an embarrassment of riches.

 Spoilt for choice and swamped with unfamiliar images and forms, they may find the situation quite confusing. 

 As a result, they may opt for the easiest way out. They fall for cliches without really exploring the issues that led British artists to make decisions on what they want to project and, more importantly, how. This seems to have been the case with most participants in this exhibition.

 What most of them have done is borrow the external forms of expression of avant garde British artists, and try to graft indigenous and personal elements on to them, aimed at giving their own work a distinctly Indian-international flavour. This is what artists in Mumbai do all the time because that is what sells. 

 However, many of the participants have not even made that effort, their work remaining unchanged even after the UK visit. Or so it seems, even if that was not their intention.

 M. Shantamani, for example, has produced out of paper life-size figures in profile of a nude man and woman that have several flaps showing their innards, variegated patterns and a circuit board. Between them stands Botticellis Venus with her viscera exposed. Such works have lost their novelty even in our country, where we blindly pick up and follow trends that were established in the West 20 years ago. It is a pity that in spite of their talent, Indian artists lack the courage and integrity to do their own thing.

 Tandra Chandra was trained in stained glass and she has produced sailboats for one exhibit and a school of fish for another. Both, with their mirrors and lighting, look cluttered and clumsy. 

 Sanchayan Ghoshs research-based art activity with three generations of the Asian community in Bristol is a large log cottage with a single window and field glasses through which one can peer inside to see the faces of individuals, perhaps members of the community he worked with. If one looks carefully enough, one can find a photograph of a showcase with a photo of a Durga image and another of Raja Rammohuns tomb in that town. In spite of the care with which he must have put this together, it adds up to little. 

 The same can be said of Samit Deys Homage to Bristol Dockyards half-baked ideas with slapdash execution.

 Perhaps the only one who seemed to possess a certain degree of economy and sensitivity was A. Balasubramaniam who has painted a spinal cord a shadowy form like the ones seen on X-ray plates against a background of white.

 Unlike the others, it is a work without superfluity. Maybe this, too, is a borrowed idea, but at least it is without flotsam and jetsam thoughtlessly garnered from the West.

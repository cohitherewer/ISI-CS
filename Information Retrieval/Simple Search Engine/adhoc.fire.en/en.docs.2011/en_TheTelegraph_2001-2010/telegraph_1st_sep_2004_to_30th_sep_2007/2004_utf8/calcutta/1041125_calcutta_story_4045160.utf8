 Microsoft agenda to train teachers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Stretching the scope of association with the Bengal government, Microsoft on Wednesday announced its plan to roll out its teachers? training programme.

 With this initiative ? part of Microsoft?s $20 million Project Shiksha, which Bill Gates had announced during his India visit ? the company is aiming to reach over a million students and 12,000 teachers in government-run schools over the next five years. 

 ?We want to take the power of information technology (IT) to the grassroots. The aim is to train teachers and help them in educating students and making GeneratioNext IT-proficient,? said Rajiv Kaul, managing director, Microsoft Corporation India Ltd.

 According to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the government, the company will set up and run an IT academy in Calcutta to impart training to teachers of government-run schools across the state.

 The company is also committed to making its licensed products available to schools at cheaper rates.

 ?Once we get an ideal location in the city, it is just a matter of a few months before we kickstart the programme,? added Kaul.

 The Redmond-headquartered global IT major has plans to implement its partners-in-learning programme in 10 states and has already launched it in Dehra Dun, in Uttaranchal, and in Hyderabad, in Andhra Pradesh.

 ?With the signing of this MoU, our endeavour is to give the best and the latest in computer training to the future workforce and teachers of our state,? said a bullish state IT minister Manab Mukherjee.

 The school education department will implement the programme and identify teachers for the two-week, intensive training programme.

 Mukherjee said the government was persuading Microsoft and some other companies to set up similar centres in the districts.

 According to the minister, the initiative would mark the beginning of a ?new phase? in the government?s relationship with Microsoft.

 The company is also helping the government in its e-governance initiatives by developing application software and training employees.

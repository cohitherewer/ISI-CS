The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Darling to director

Remember Suman in Maine Pyar Kiya? Yes, Bhagyashree 

the debutante who charmed everyone with her million-dollar smile in one of Bollywood?s 

biggest blockbusters of all time has now reversed roles and gone behind the camera. 

Yes, the actress is all set to don the director?s cap for the Star One telefilm 

this Friday titled Uff Yum Ma.

 ?The grains of direction were always inside me. I was interested in the other side of the camera. In fact I was never keen on acting. But then Maine Pyar Kiya happened. Nothing in my career has been planned. I have taken things as they come,? Bhagyashree told Metro.

 A light romantic comedy, Uff Yum Ma revolves around the lives of Amar (Suraj Thapar), his wife Geeta (Anjali Mukhi) and his girlfriend Sapna (Beejal Batavia). With Amar alone for two weeks, he falls for the sexy girl next door, Sapna, only to get in trouble. 

 ?My husband (Himalaya) and I at Shrishti Entertainment were working on a couple of scripts and once we came to know that Star One is giving a chance to new film-makers in their Studio One slot, we pitched in with our ideas. We are also slated to do another telefilm for them,? said Bhagyashree.

 The actress, who fizzled out after the phenomenal success of the Sooraj Barjatya film, ultimately wants to get into film direction. ?We are writing the script. This telefilm gave me a lot of practical experience, which I can utilise in my future projects. Uff Yum Ma could have been made in film format but it would have ended up being a very small-budget venture. I wanted to do it for television with a comparatively larger budget and a freer hand.?

 Getting behind the camera doesn?t mean curtains for Bhagyashree the actress. ?If there is an interesting project, I will definitely do it. But I wouldn?t direct myself in any film or telefilm. Simply because that would be too much to handle at the same time.?

 So check out whether Bhagyashree is able to churn out the same magic with her directorial debut as she did with her maiden acting venture. Now wait till Friday, 11 pm on Star One.

The happening hair fad this year is the straight look. 

People with waves, gentle curls or even frizzy hair are all gearing up for a more 

chic image. Stars ? big and small screen ? are all flirting with the curl-less 

look, and the crowds are happily following in their footsteps. While an excessive 

use of flat-irons and straightening chemicals could do serious damage, rebonding 

is less harsh and the results last far longer.

June Tomkyns, the salon on Ballygunge Circular Road, 

recently demonstrated just how professional rebonding works, with the help of 

products by Wella.

The after-effects were clear: rebonding is gentle, 

lending a natural sheen to make the hair shine. It helps keep the hair manageable, 

produces a modern hair profile and less volume and allows a versatility that curly 

hair usually lacks.

So how is it done? Simple.

Silky soft

The first step is to do a hair analysis. For optimum 

results, straighten the hair in even strokes with the latest Proheat Ceramic Iron.

The next step involves applying the straightening 

cream, the efficiency of which differs depending on hair type. For example, normal 

or chemically-treated hair calls for Biotouch Straight Control Intensive Mask, 

while resistant hair can do without it.

Part the hair and apply the Straight Control Starting 

Cream on dry hair, strand by strand, with the help of a comb. Immediately after 

this, apply the straightening cream. The avocado extract this cream contains enriches 

the hair texture.

Tress trial

Then, run a wide-toothed comb through the hair and 

plaster the hair on boards for support. Check the effect on a strand by flicking 

it gently to see if it falls straight. If needed, leave in the cream for some 

more time. Rinse the hair.

Secure strands

Next, the hair is blow-dried. Apply Straight Control 

Immediate Treatment strand by strand. This provides intensive protection to the 

hair by moisturising it. Do not rinse the hair at all at this point of time. Straighten 

the hair in equal strokes, section by section, with a ceramic iron.

End effect

Next, part the hair and apply Neutraliser Cream, strand 

by strand, and plaster the hair once more onto boards. Allow this to work its 

effects for 20 minutes, after which rinse the hair thoroughly and shampoo with 

straight control shampoo.

The company also has a Straight Control Finisher which 

is applied and left on for about 10 minutes. The active ingredients in this apparently 

penetrate the hair follicles restoring the pH balance and removing peroxide residues. 

This prevents unwanted oxidation and leaves the hair 

with a glowing sheen. 

Finally, rinse the hair thoroughly and leave it to 

dry for straight, gleaming tresses.

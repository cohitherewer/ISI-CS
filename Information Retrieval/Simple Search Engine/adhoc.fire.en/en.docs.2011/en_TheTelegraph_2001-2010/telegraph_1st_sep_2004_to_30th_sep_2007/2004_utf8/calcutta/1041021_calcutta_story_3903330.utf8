The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Best enjoyed with those dearest

 I love Durga puja. The lights, hordes of happy faces and the fervour. And yet, I can?t remember the last time I spent a considerable amount of time in Calcutta during the Pujas. Travel has always kept me away from the city during this time. Even this year, I was in Delhi on work but I have come back for a day on Saptami to be part of the festivities.

 My fondest memories of this festival of joy are those of the time when I was still very fresh in Calcutta. A new import from faraway Sikkim as I was, I had hardly seen anything as awe-inspiring as Durga puja in all its grandeur. I used to be out with Bengali families I was friendly with and we had a great time together.

 Pretty faces in new clothes, quiet smiles on shy lips have lived as images of the festival in my mind. I?ve enjoyed myself in true Bengali style, with bhog for lunch and junk food in the evenings, spiced up with long chat sessions with friends.

 In fact, even now, when I get the time to be in Calcutta during the Pujas, I always like to go out with Bengali friends and families. That way I get to witness the true spirit of the festival.

 What I hate most about the Pujas is that people never let me be on my own. Pandal inaugurations and guest visits are things that mar the festive days for me, but one has to do all that, too. Like I flew down on Sashti night just to judge a contest on Saptami.

 I personally believe that occasions like these are best celebrated with those who are close. I at least had the Saptami morning to myself, but given the time constraint, decided to just do my workout at the gym and have a quiet lunch at home before leaving for the judging session.

 I think a lot of people hate the traffic jams that clog the city during this time. I think it?s quite irritating, but I don?t mind it so much, given that one has to sacrifice something in return for a greater gift. When you are witness to so much of fun and frolic for five days at a stretch, there is no reason why you shouldn?t be a little patient with these small things.

 My biggest regret about Durga puja is that I?ve never had the chance to spend it with my girlfriend Madhuri. We have either been in different cities, or too busy with our respective lives. Sadly, her job and my schedule have not left much time for us to actually spend the Pujas the way I used to, long ago.

 This Navami you can be at... Bandel

SANKAR SRIDHAR

 At a time when the Bansberia of today was known as Bangshabati and the Ganga hugged its eastern end, there lived a king, Nrisingha Deb. Pious and an art lover, he decided sometime in 1729 to build a grand temple for Goddess Hangsheshwari, a form of Shakti.

 Craftsmen were called in from Jaipur, stones were imported from Chunar (in Varanasi) and the construction begun. The raja, however, passed away soon after and his queen, Shankari, completed the work in 1814.

 A lot has changed since then ? the Ganga has moved further away and the roads and flyovers have eaten into much of the open space ? but not the temple.

 The four-km ride to Hangsheshwari temple is rough, but the sight of the 21-metre high, five-storeyed structure, which looks like a mish-mash of a fairytale castle, fort and a minar and the history attached to it more than make up for it.

 The imposing, albeit odd-looking, fa?ade stands Gulliver-like at the far end of a field, towering over trees and the much smaller modern houses surrounding it.

 The temple, it is said, adopts the six cycles of tantric sadhana and each tier symbolises a nerve-centre of the human body. The uppermost stories taper and end in minarets. Thirteen such steeples crown the temple.

 To the left of the structure, cordoned off by a wall vandalised by time and local residents, stands another temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The Vasudev temple dates back to 1678 and stands in stark contrast to the larger and relatively recent Hangsheshwari temple. The outer structure of the temple, with intricate terracotta work that depict scenes hailing the accomplishments of the god in his 10 avatars, is a treat to behold. In the main inner sanctum of the temple stands an idol of Vishnu, while numerous smaller cubicles surrounding it house Shiva lingas.

 On the approach road to the temple stands a set of mildewed ruins which, residents say, is what remains of the palatial houses of the rulers of a bygone era. A stroll through whatever remains of the dynastic structure will almost definitely take you back several centuries, especially if the priest of Hangsheshwari temple is coaxed into guiding you through the time travel. Of course, in return, he expects the visitor to offer puja and some pranami for the goddess.

 It would be a good idea to carry a packed lunch as there are no shops in the vicinity of the temple. Of course there are several ponds, considered to be vestiges of the Ganga, which make for the perfect picnic spots.

How to get there:

 Board the Bandel local or Burdwan local (on the main line) to Bandel, around 40 minutes from Howrah. Take a rickshaw or book an auto from Bandel station to Hangsheshwari temple

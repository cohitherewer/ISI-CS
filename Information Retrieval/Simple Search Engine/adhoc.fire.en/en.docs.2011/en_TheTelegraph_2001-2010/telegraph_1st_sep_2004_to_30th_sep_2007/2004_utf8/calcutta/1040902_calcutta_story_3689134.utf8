 Ramp shares rack space, jewels in flexi-fix

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI, SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

The face of fashion found a logical ramp amid the racks of a Shoppers Stop outlet at Forum on Tuesday. The strobe lights on the polished white floor of the store reflected a volley of colours, while a 200-strong crowd took in the eye candy provided by a bevy of models strutting the stores new festive collection. 

 A mix of casual, semi-formal and formal outfits, the new range seems to have something for every mood and occasion. Striped cotton uppers, evening jackets teamed with short skirts, shirts and tees for men in solids are a few of the interesting options.

The late afternoon fiesta provided more cheer in the 

announcement of a privilege card not many shopaholics would be able to resist. 

The card, available with the August 28 issue of Sananda, will catapult 

the holder in the special discount league at the lifestyle store. 

Titled Sananda Shoppers Stop Pujor Bajar in association 

with Rio Tunto Presents Sparkle Diamonds, the shopping spree will continue till 

October 10. 

Bollywood starlets will add to the fun till the period, 

with customers standing a chance to do an up-close-and-personal with their favourite 

stars June, Koneenica, Chandreyee and Debolina to name a few.

Yet more value addition will be provided by live Bhoomi 

performances at the venue. 

 You can spot the new stock showcased today as soon as our ongoing annual sale is over, said Naveen Misra, unit manager, Shoppers Stop, Forum. He also promised a fresh ethnic range for the Pujas and Diwali.

 Stud smart

 You cant miss that corner shop as you walk towards Winning Streak, the sports bar at The HHI. And if the show window of Jewel Co hasnt lured you in yet, peep in for a dekho next time around for a lavish display of new additions to their trendy light-weight diamond jewellery collection. 

 Launched for the festive season, the jewels have been given a versatile look to suit myriad occasions. A gold jhumka with topaz danglers hanging from a diamond studded top for example, can be detached into two separate pieces of a stud and a dangler.

 quot;We lay special emphasis on innovation and sleekness 

to suit the taste of the modern woman, stressed Pratap Lodha, owner.

 International styles feature in their repertoire as well. Antique-look diamond sets, all the rage in Europe, find pride of place on the store racks. And they dont necessarily cost a fortune. A large diamond pendant with a matching necklace and earrings can be claimed for all of Rs 40,000.

 The price benefit is available as we use largely uncut diamonds in our creations. These lack the shine of a well-cut diamond but can definitely bring a sparkle to your eye, smiled Lodha. Set in silver, the discounted shimmer is offset to some extent.

 Other jewels are priced at Rs 3,000 onwards with some going well over the half-a-lakh mark. 

 Thai try

 Star hotels in the city are vying with each other to dish out a slice of exotica. The flavours of Thai fruits Mangosteen and Rambutan now find pride of place in the menu of The Park after being lapped up by Hyatt Regency and Oberoi Grand last week as part of the Thai Consulates attempt to popularise the fruits in India. 

 Desserts using the juicy bites by Chef Kunlert of Zen at The Park smack of authenticity (or we take the chefs word for it; he does come from Thailand, after all). Rambutan with Green Tea Granita and Mangosteen in Lemon Grass and Guava Nectar are the pop picks from his kitchen.

 The pulpy fruits, sweet-and-sour to taste, also lend themselves to shakes, mocktails and ice creams.

 Out to lunch

 Amber, one of Calcuttas most enduring names in Indian cuisine, is trying hard to match steps with the newer crop of eateries that have mushroomed all over the city. In a bid to shake off its expensive tag, the restaurant has introduced a weekend lunch buffet for the first time in its 44-year history. 

 A buffet spread offered for lunch on weekends at the first floor of the restaurant between 12 noon and 3 pm packs in an array of Indian dishes in vegetarian and non-vegetarian categories, priced at Rs 200 and Rs 225 respectively. Other areas at the eatery continue to serve the a la carte regulars.

 The fixed fare includes soup, rice, assorted breads and two kinds of salads, while the main course dishes differ in the veg and non-veg sections. The veg section boasts dishes like Shahi Paneer (paneer cooked in a rich white gravy); Mushroom Shabnam (a dry blend of mushroom, capsicum, onion and green peas garnished with curry leaves); Malai Kofta or Mixed Vegetable Kofta or Hariyali Kofta; Vegetable Jaipuri (mixed vegetables comprising carrots, peas and beans with gravy); Rajasthani Aloo Dum (potatoes cooked in dahi) and the Amber favourites like Dal Makhani and Pindi Chana.

 The non-veg buffet is an elaborate affair with preparations like Dhania Chicken (chicken cooked in coriander gravy); Mutton Nukti Korma (a boneless mutton dahi-based korma); Fish Butter Masala; Chicken Do Pyaza (semi-dry chicken cooked in onion gravy and garnished with fried onions); and the popular Mutton Biryani among others. 

 The meal can be capped with Chocolate Mousse, Malai Kulfi and Gulab Jamun. 

 The menu will change every week to offer some variety for regulars.

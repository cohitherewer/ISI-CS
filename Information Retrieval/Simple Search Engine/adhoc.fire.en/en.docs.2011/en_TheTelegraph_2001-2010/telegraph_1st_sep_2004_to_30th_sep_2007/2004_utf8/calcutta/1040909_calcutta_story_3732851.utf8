 Critical care stress in nursing degree revamp

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New hospitals coming up in the city need not worry about finding competent nursing staff any more.

 To cope with the growing demand for efficient nurses, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has decided to revamp the syllabus for its B.Sc course in nursing.

 ?The concept of nursing services has undergone an enormous change in recent times,? says Mahasweta Bose, principal of the College of Nursing at SSKM Hospital, the only government-run college in the state offering a B.Sc course in the field. 

 ?We have revised the syllabus with a view to equipping the students with the latest skills in the field. The nurses must be at ease with the technology and business approaches in use in the new hospitals.?

 The main feature of the revised syllabus is that it will be based on practical and specialised training, with extra emphasis on critical care and emergency management, Bose said.

 ?Special training will be offered in specific areas in which there is a great demand for well-trained nurses. Many private hospitals are now approaching us with requests to provide them with nurses having expertise in handling cardiology and neurology cases. Operating theatre nurses are also in demand,? the principal said.

 The government, for the first time, has also introduced a compulsory six-month internship for all nursing graduates from this year. Students who have taken admission to B.Sc (nursing) this month will be the first batch to be covered under the internship programme. 

 Till now, only graduate doctors were required to complete a six-month internship, after completing the MBBS. 

 ?The internship will help the young nurses to learn how to take independent decisions while handling critical cases. We have also incorporated certain new courses to enable them to perform efficiently in extreme situations,? Abha Roy, a senior teacher said.

 The revised syllabus also requires every student to be sent to a hospital nearest to an accident site. ?For instance, a major rail accident takes place and many victims are admitted to a hospital near the site. We will send our students to that hospital, so that they learn how to handle a large number of critical patients simultaneously,? said an official. 

 Health department sources, however, said, an analysis of the 20-year-old syllabus revealed that over-emphasis on theory and inadequate exposure to field - work is one of the reasons why nurses posted at major state-run hospitals fall short of expectations. 

 The last time a revision was made to the syllabus was in the early 1990s.

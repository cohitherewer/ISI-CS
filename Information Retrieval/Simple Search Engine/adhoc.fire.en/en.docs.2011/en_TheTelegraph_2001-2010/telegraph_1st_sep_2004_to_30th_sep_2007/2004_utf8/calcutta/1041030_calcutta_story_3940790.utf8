The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Star poll pull

Global eye

 John Kerry with Barbra Streisand and (below) 

Leonardo DiCaprio 

Democrats: Meg Ryan, Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand, Susan Sarandon, 

Tim Robbins, Michael Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Whoopi Goldberg, Chevy Chase, Michael 

Stipe, Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Short, Rob Reiner, Michelle Pfeiffer, 

Tobey Maguire, Ray Romano...

Republicans: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, Charlton Heston, Tom Selleck, 

Bruce Willis, Shannen Doherty, Chuck Norris, Kelsey Grammer...

Clearly, if the stars were truly to sway the US Presidential election, John Kerry 

would already have one foot in the White House. And Arnie hardly counts in the 

filmi category anymore, leaving a rather paltry list of supporters for the Republican 

right from the pretty people.

The Hollywood liberals have come out in full force 

to back the Democratic candidate ? or rather, anyone who is not George W. Bush.

But don?t make the mistake of assuming that it is 

all about eye candy. Hollywood and its stars have always been significant fundraisers 

for the Democratic cause. And the Republican oil pockets may be deeper, but CEOs 

can hardly compete with celebrity in terms of pop pull.

From Bruce Springsteen?s Vote for Change concerts 

to Meg Ryan?s words at a recent campaign stop in Tampa, the cry has been loud 

and clear. The Republican response has been to dismiss this is as support from 

an ?elitist? group removed from reality. Kerry ? who counted amongst his main 

supporters the recently deceased Christopher Reeve ? has instead called them ?the 

heart and soul of the country?.

Whether the screen biggies pull their weight in the 

polls or not remains to be seen. Some believe that in an America unified by the 

September 11 attacks, where the youth have been touched by politics like never 

before, it may be worth more than it would seem.

As Titanic star Leonardo DiCaprio said: ?I?m 

coming here today not as a politician, not as an actor, but a concerned citizen 

like all of you out there... You cannot afford to be uninterested. You cannot 

afford to be detached from this election. You cannot afford to turn your back 

on the future of our country.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Foreign varsities all for city students

 JULIUS GOMES

 Universities in the UK, Australia and New Zealand are increasingly preferring students from Calcutta over those from other parts of the country. And for a good reason: they feel students from the city are more focussed and committed than other Indian students.

 According to officials of Global Reach, an organisation that represents a number of institutions in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, South Africa, the UK and US, students from the eastern region account for only four per cent of those going abroad for higher studies, but their track record is generally excellent. 

 According to the officials, students from the east misuse or abuse their student visas less than those from other parts of the country. And they concentrate on completing their courses before thinking of settling down abroad. 

 Students from the rest of the country, on the other hand, tend to get more involved in working and trying to get citizenship at the earliest, pointed out the officials.

 For governments that encourage inflow of international students but are more tight-fisted with work permits, students from eastern India pose the least amount of problems.

 ?Historically, students from the east have been keen on academics. They are generally more interested in continuing studies than becoming taxi drivers abroad,? said Pratik Tarafdar, assistant manager (business development) of Global Reach.

 ?The student outflow to destinations like Australia and the UK have gone up considerably, to 130 per cent and 185 per cent, respectively. This is partly because the universities there have changed their strategy regarding Calcutta students,? he added.

 Other factors have also contributed to students from eastern India setting their sights on foreign shores. ?The communist government has not focused on increasing the numbers of educational institutions in the state. Hence, a lot of students are looking at other options,? said Ravi Lochan Singh, managing director and principal counsellor of Global Reach.

 Kartik Roy, professor of economics at the University of Queensland, who has been teaching in Australia for over 30 years, said more students from Calcutta are gaining admission to Australian universities than ever before.

 Among scholarship students from the east, 80 per cent prefer the US. The rest mainly opt for the UK. Of the fee-paying students, 40 per cent go to the UK, 35-38 per cent to Australia and 18-20 per cent to the US.

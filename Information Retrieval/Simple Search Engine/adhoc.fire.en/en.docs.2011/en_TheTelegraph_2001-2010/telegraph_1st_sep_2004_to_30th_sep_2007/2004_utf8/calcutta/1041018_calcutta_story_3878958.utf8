The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Autumn ode: our devi, their devi

 - Durga worship sweeps the world, from Europe to Australia

 NISHA LAHIRI

 Durga puja being observed in Cologne

 We get about 800 visitors a day at our puja, declares Narayan Chandra Das. When you?re in Cologne, not College Square, a daily festive footfall of 800 is a badge of honour. And the vice-president of the Cologne puja association ? with claims to being the largest in Europe ? wears it well.

 ?Our puja is held inside a hall in Cologne,? Das told Metro. ?We give bhog in the afternoon and at night, because visitors come from very far, after work, and are tired. We (the organisers) try and take off from office during the Puja days.?

 The purutmoshai is a resident of Cologne, but the pratima comes from Kumartuli, once every three years. The bhog is stirred up by the women, but everyone lends a helping hand to make the event a success. 

 After all, it draws quite a crowd, Bengali and non-Bengali, from in and around the city.

 Our Puja is as much theirs, these autumnal days. Borders are no boundaries as dozens of Pujas are organised all across the US. The unstoppable Durga puja brigade ? saris , Rabindrasangeet, Bollywood film fest and all ? has rolled into Europe and other pockets of Asia, as well. 

 There are at least six pujas in the suburbs of Sydney itself, and in other Australian cities. Even New Zealand has a ?Bengalee? association.

 The puja in Plumpton, a north-western suburb of Sydney, is organised by a Das family. The three brothers, their families and even some extended family members are settled in the area, and they decided to have their very own Durga puja in 1998. The pratima is by Partho Das, whose father was a commercial artist and had started one of the earliest Pujas in Mumbai.

 ?I make the idol out of plywood, and dismantle it at the end of the celebration,? Partho Das told Metro. Though this is a weekend-only festival, with holidays hard to come by, the success of this family puja can be judged by the fact that the pratima has been getting bigger every year. ?More and more people pour in every year ? Bengalis, Maharashtrians, Australians and even Southeast Asians ? because they want to know all about Durga puja,? added Das.

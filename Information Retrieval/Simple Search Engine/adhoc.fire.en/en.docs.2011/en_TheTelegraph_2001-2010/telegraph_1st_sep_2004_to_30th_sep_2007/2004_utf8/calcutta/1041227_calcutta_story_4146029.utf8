 Mobile makeover 

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 Now that the cell phone has become an integral part 

of your life, it is time to stop taking it for granted. It serves as a phone book, 

reminder, alarm clock, radio, camera, and deserves at least a part of your attention 

and affection.

 Boring plastic covers are out. It?s about time you dressed up your cell phone in more vibrant robes than that, if you haven?t already. 

 Make sure your phone looks as trendy as that filmi ringtone sounds. Colourful danglers with glass and metal knick-knacks do the trick here.

 Once you start shopping for your ear appendage, you will find yourself spoilt for choice.

 Useful add-ons like car chargers and hands-free sets aside, you can blow up some cash on more ornamental embellishments.

 Protection by way of transparent plastic and leather cases is fine, but if you really want to turn heads, there are dainty crochet sachets with matching slings up for grabs at almost every mall in town. 

 They cost one-tenth of your phone bill and you can even keep half-a-dozen or so handy to match your moods and outfits. Pinks, greens, blues or multi-coloured, these also help camouflage that outdated model apart from ensuring that your phone is always firmly an arm?s length away. 

 Perfect for partying are little hand-bag shaped cell cases for girls, either in leather or cloth with funky ethnic prints and sequins.

 And if you revel in being really different, go ahead and make yourself a snazzy silk or brocade case to go with ethnic wear this wedding season.

 Staid zippered covers might serve the purpose but there is a quaint charm to cases that often come with funky wooden buttons or even pearl fitted flaps.

And these days, battery powered in-built lights can glow all the while you are talking away to glory. 

 For more shimmer, there are some phone stickers that come in sci-fi, bird, animal and cartoon motifs. 

 To be stuck on the back of your phone, these glow whenever your phone vibrates. In fact, they start signalling a couple of seconds before your phone actually rings.

 Some of the danglers and stickers also come with New Year and Christmas motifs to fit the mood of countless festive greetings you will be receiving and sending.

 And after you are done with your talkathon, you can set your weary phone down on a table-top holder in pretty, colourful cartoon or zodiac sign holders.

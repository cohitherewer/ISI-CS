The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cover drive for Buddha 

 - Security beefed up, local police to monitor realty

 KINSUK BASU

LOOPHOLES 

Lapses as perceived during preliminary 

observation: 

 Certain 

points on the chief ministers route are soft they remain inadequately 

covered

*Not all men posted at the chief ministers residence are armed

 There 

are occasional lapses in coordination between the special security unit (SSU) 

and the Special Branch officials covering a particular event/ meeting being attended 

by the chief minister

 The SSU 

members require more training in handling emergency situations arising out of 

sudden changes in threat quotient while on chief ministers duty

The reverberations of the gunshots, fired barely 500 ft from the chief minister?s Palm Avenue residence on Saturday, continue to rock Lalbazar.

 With chinks in the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee protective armour exposed, a security scurry has prompted both chop and change. Under instructions from the state director-general of police and the city police commissioner, the chief minister?s security ring is being revamped.

 For starters, minutes after taking charge, M.A. Saleh, incoming officer-in-charge of Karaya police station, which covers the chief minister?s residence, led a team of senior officers to the spot, took note of the existing set-up and listed the loopholes.

 This was at 3.45 pm on Tuesday. Two hours later, a closed-door meeting at Karaya thana turned the spotlight firmly on the crime rate and criminals operating in the area.

 Target No. I is the local real-estate business, as a dispute over the supply of building material had triggered the shootout close to the chief minister?s residence.

 It has been decided that the movement of all suppliers of building material, with or without a criminal background, would be monitored. 

 Besides, all those engaged in supplying building materials to highrises under construction would be watched.

 If frenetic activity marked the day at the police station entrusted with the task of protecting the chief minister?s residence, another vital security session was on in the closed confines of classrooms at the Alipore Police Lines.

 Instructors there were thrashing out security models meant to cover VVIPs, with members of the special security unit (SSU).

 Following orders from the intelligence brass, it has now been decided that a closed ring will cover chief minister Bhattacharjee at all functions, much along the lines of Z-plus security cover.

 A fresh look will also be taken of the threat perception along the routes that Bhattacharjee usually takes during the course of the day, as also the places he frequents, like Nandan and the Alimuddin Street CPM headquarters.

 Members of the SSU will also be equipped to calculate the threat quotient of a place and, in case of shortage of security staff, taught how to evacuate a VIP under threat. 

 These measures will be finalised once special inspector-general (security) A.K. Maliwal returns from a trip to Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh.

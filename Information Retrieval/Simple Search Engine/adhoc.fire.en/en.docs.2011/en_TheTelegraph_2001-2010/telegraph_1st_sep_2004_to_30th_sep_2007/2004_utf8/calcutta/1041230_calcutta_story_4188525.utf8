 A compassionate canvas

 Philosophical and introspective in tone and temperament, the paintings of Chandra Bhattacharjee impress because they represent realistically, though not without a touch of romance, the dreams and aspirations of common humanity. Darkness and After, his current series of paintings on display at the ongoing exhibition, shows the artist examining this recurring theme in various forms. The presence of male figures on his canvases, more often than women, offers a clue to his intended metaphor, which emphasises the struggles of the toiling masses. The delicate brown predominating his palette echoes his sympathetic treatment of his subjects. Bhattacharjee?s canvases collectively portray his own view of life, with a mature handling of medium coupled with his skill of inventing imagery to clothe his artistic vision. Characterised by a heightened degree of passion and intensity, the intimately personal paintings show his figures in states of serendipity, confinement and contemplation, but possessing a latent power and energy that urge them to break free.

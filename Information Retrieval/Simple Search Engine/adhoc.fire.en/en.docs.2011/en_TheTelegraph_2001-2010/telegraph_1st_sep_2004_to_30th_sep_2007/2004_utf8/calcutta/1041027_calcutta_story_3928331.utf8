 Murder not mishap, cries family

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A fall down jail bathroom stairs could not be the reason for Babulal Sharma?s death, alleged relatives of the undertrial, who died in Dum Dum Central Jail on Monday night.

 ?My son was murdered inside the jail. This was not a natural death. I suspect he was murdered,? said mother Santosh Sharma on Tuesday afternoon.

 Officials claim that Babulal, lodged in jail since September 2001 in connection with the murder of Dum Dum municipality chairman Sailen Das, suffered a fatal fall in the jail bathroom around midnight on Monday. 

 Senior prison officials claimed on Tuesday that the 27-year-old severely injured himself in the fall. 

 Jail doctor A.K. Roy attended to a profusely-bleeding Babulal and recommended that he be shifted to hospital. He was declared dead at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The body was sent for post-mortem to the NRS Hospital morgue.

 But family members suspect foul play. ?Why were we told about Babulal?s death only around 8 this morning, after seven-and-a-half hours of his fall? Why did the jail authorities not inform us before he was taken to the hospital?? asked Varsha, Babulal?s widow.

 She believes her husband was ?beaten to death inside jail?, which the authorities are now hushing up.

 Babulal?s father Sriram is also sceptical about the official version of his son?s death. ?My son was an athletic man who has suffered several falls while playing football and cricket. Why would a man of robust health, who has never complained about injuries, die because of just a fall?? he asked.

 Babulal was to have appeared in court on November 17 as the last witness in the Sailen Das murder case.

 ?I believe this is a premeditated murder to silence my son, to stop him from appearing in court,? Sriram alleged.

 Another version blames the death on a jail fight. According to prison sources, Babulal was beaten up by fellow inmates on Monday night.

 ?Babulal was sharing ward 12 with other inmates, most of whom had been recently lodged in prison. After dinner, a heated argument started, after which Babulal was beaten up,? they claimed. The fight, not the fall, led to the fatal injury, sources said.

 Coming close on the heels of a similar death in Presidency jail, the incident is sure to draw the attention of the state human rights commission and other rights bodies. Deputy inspector-general, prisons, Ramapada Bhattacharya has been asked to initiate a probe into the accident and submit a report by Wednesday.

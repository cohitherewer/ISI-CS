The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The new shopping malls in the city have a common problem. The floors are of 

marble, granite or glazed tiles and are extremely slippery. I noticed this in 

City Centre, too. Children and the elderly might fall and injure themselves. The 

staircase inside Westside is quite bizzarely constructed. Something should immediately 

be done to address this problem. The buildings can be made stylish yet functionally 

sound.

 I purchased a Samsung fridge from Khosla Electronics, Beckbagan, on October 

20 and was told that I had won an electric iron as a gift. They took the entire 

payment and then said the fridge could not be delivered till 25th as that was 

when their ?puja break? ended. I had to collect a ?pin card? to avail of the gift. 

They didnt have the card either so I returned after a few days but in vain. 

After that, I have visited the shop several times but have not received the gift 

yet. I hope this account will warn others not to fall for such marketing gimmicks.

 A few days ago, a group of people came to my residence claiming they were conducting 

a survey for Samavayika. We cooperated with them and patiently gave away details 

about our family members, income, product and preferences for about 45 minutes. 

After that, they revealed they were not from Samavayika but were representing 

a multinational company. However, they could not produce any proof of their identity. 

This is an alarming trend. Can such dubious salespersons be penalised?

 Snap sequel for Trinamul

 - Superficial civic report on road repairs draws court frown

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly?s run-ins with match referees can only be matched by Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamul Congress? brushes with the high court.

 Even before the crack of the whip over the December 3 bandh could die down, the high court has again struck Trinamul, this time for the failure of its civic board to improve the road conditions.

 ?They (Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the government) appear to be unconcerned over the people?s suffering because of bad roads,? a division bench of Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Asit Kumar Bishi observed on Thursday.

 ?Most amazing is the civic body?s callous attitude to an issue that touches millions. Despite a court order, they have made no efforts to repair the roads,? the judges said, while hearing a petition filed by lawyers Idris Ali and Sreemoyee Mitra. 

 The civic fathers were ticked off for avoiding furnishing a report on their performance in conformity with an October court directive on maintenance of roads. 

 The authorities, said the bench, have been shirking responsibility. ?What?s going on? You come to the court every day to seek more time. We want a comprehensive report on the progress of maintenance work without any further delay. Ask your client to take the matter seriously,? the court told CMC counsel. 

 The judges also made it clear that if the civic authorities did not mend their ways, the court would be forced to order the mayoral council member (roads) to be present before the bench every day with a progress report.

 As for the state government, the bench held the public works department (PWD) guilty of not complying with court directives on roads.

 ?It?s very unfortunate that the department is not paying enough attention to roads. It does not even bother to comply with a court order,? the judges observed. 

 The department, however, was not represented during the hearing. Neither was the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC), also entrusted with maintaining some roads. 

 ?Their absence shows that they are unconcerned over the rising number of deaths in road accidents,? counsel Ali and Mitra said.

 The CMC progress report filed on Thursday, as directed by the court on November 24, came in for criticism, as it was superficial. The Calcutta Port Trust?s report was similar, too. 

 The court passed a fresh order asking the PWD, CMC and the CTC to file progress reports within December 13.

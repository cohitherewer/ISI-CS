The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Feed your fragrance fetish 

From affordable Adidas to high-end Issey 

Miyake, men are pampered when it comes to perfumes, says Himika Chaudhuri

There could be some debate about just how much cologne 

a man should wear ? just a splash of aftershave, just enough to leave a trail 

behind you, or a cloud strong enough to envelop a room.

 But about one thing there can be no doubt ? if a man smells good, he could be in rags and no one would notice.

 Getting the scent right is the beginning of good dressing. ?Perfume defines a person,? feels ace footballer Bhaichung Bhutia, who never steps in to a party without his Davidoff Cool Water on.

 ?Cologne also defines your mood. I wear a subtle smell to work, but while partying I choose a more flamboyant aroma,? adds Karan Paul, Apeejay Surrendra group chairman.

 With the departmental and standalone cosmetics stores in the city selling everything from affordable Adidas to high-end Issey Miyake, the options available to the perfume buyer are plenty. There can be no excuse to smell bad anymore.

For beginners

 If you are a first-time buyer, the safest thing might be to check out the perfume section of a large departmental store. Shoppers? Stop at City Centre has one of the best collections of perfumes in the city at the moment. Other chains like Pantaloons and Westside are also worth a look, as is a standalone outlet such as Exclusive Lines.

 The customer-care executives are usually very helpful and will guide you towards a bottle that suits your style and budget.

 However, if you are confused by the enormous array at your fingertips, you may prefer to choose from some of the better-known names.

 Davidoff Cool Water, priced at Rs 2,600 for 100 ml, is always a good bet. And unfortunately, with Armani?s Aqua di Gio not available on city shelves, its main competition in the aqua aroma section is missing. Fahrenheit from Christian Dior is another enduring name. The classic Eternity from Calvin Klein is priced at Rs 2,725 for a 100 ml pack. Deep, also from Davidoff, is an extension of the Cool Water brand. At Rs 3,300 for 100 ml, the new entrant is doing well.

Bargain bet

 If you are not keen to spend thousands of rupees on a new-found passion you aren?t sure will linger as long as the fragrance, go for a range of deodorants that these big brands offer.

 While it might not pack in as much bang for your buck, at between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, they are less of a dent while providing a whiff of what may come.

 Calvin Klein also has a range of sub-brands called Boucheron and Diego that have perfumes priced between Rs 450 and Rs 700. These can make good gifts and might mark the start of an enduring passion for cologne.

The favourites

 Calvin Klein, Dolce amp; Gabbana, Yves Saint Laurent, Davidoff and Christian Dior remain the favourite brands for men?s fragrance aficionados. Each has its best-sellers. Higher Energy, at Rs 2,985 for 100 ml from the house of Christian Dior, is a must pick for most regulars at the perfume counter. 

 Azzaro, which has a whole range of products for men (including bath foam, aftershave and cologne) is doing brisk business with its product Visit. This is priced at Rs 2,650. Escada Pour Homme, with it?s woody and spicy smell, is priced at Rs 2,100. Jil Sander for Men and Lalique for Men are also doing well.

New entrants

 Four new international brands have entered the Calcutta market in the past six months and are doing well with foreign tourists and Calcuttans alike.

 French finesse comes in the form of Thierry Mugler and Jean Paul Gaultier, while a bit of Japanese jazz has flooded the market, with Shiseido and Issey Miyake quickly gaining ground.

 A-Men from Thierry Mugler is priced at Rs 3,950 while Gaultier Pour Homme is priced at Rs 3,250 for a 125 ml bottle. Pour Homme from Issey Miyake is priced at Rs 3,250. Basala from Shiseido is the most affordable of the four, priced at Rs 2,850.

 Colognes and women?s perfumes in this segment are aspirational products which all come at a price. But on the flip side, the beautiful bottles last a long time, with just a little bit of these heady concoctions strong enough to last hours and hours. And having women swoon at your feet? Priceless.

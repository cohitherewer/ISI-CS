 Light up your life

 With Diwali, the festival of lights, just around the corner, Gallery Kanishkas hosts an exhibition of exquisitely-crafted lampshades made from biodegradable materials. Designed and manufactured by Green Passions, a city-based organisation, the stunningly beautiful range of handcrafted and handpainted lampshades on show have all been made using hand-made, eco-friendly paper, cane, jute and pulp paper made from water hyacinth. With a mission to help conserve our rapidly degenerating eco-system, each lampshade has been created taking special care to avoid any material whose use may destroy an already fragile ecological balance or pose threat to our environment. The ongoing exhibition, while helping to preserve our natural habitat, also promotes the cause of social welfare, with part of its sale proceeds being earmarked for the special children of Uttarayan.

 Event: Exhibition of handcrafted and handpainted lampshades

 When: Till November 10, 11 am - 8 pm

 Where: Gallery Kanishka?s, 2/1 Hindustan Road, Calcutta- 700029

 Mutiny monitor mobike guard

 PRONAB MONDAL 

 A hundred years ago, during the Raj, a wing of Calcutta Police used to keep a watch on freedom-fighters in the city. Men of the same wing today keep an eye on the 150 motorcycles of their colleagues.

 Watchers, the only unit that has been a part of the force from the British era, has been entrusted with the new responsibility a week ago.

 Members of the wing, in their traditional dhoti-kurta uniform, can be seen guarding the sea of two-wheelers parked along Rabindra Sarani, behind Lalbazar police headquarters, every day. 

 They have been deployed there in view of the growing incidents of two-wheeler theft.

 The watchers, nicknamed khochors in police circles, were asked to keep an eye on the two-wheelers after the new commissioner of police, Prasun Mukherjee, ordered his men to not allow anyone, including traffic sergeants, to park motorcycles and scooters on the Lalbazar premises.

 Earlier, at least 150 two-wheelers used to be parked in front of the buildings which house the OC Control Room and the Traffic Control Room.

 ?Sometimes, the main entrance of the buildings would be blocked by the parked two-wheelers. The commissioner must have noticed it,? said a senior officer at Lalbazar.

 ?The commissioner did not suggest an alternative location to park our two-wheelers. His instruction was to clear the space,? said an inspector of the detective department, of which the watchers are a part. 

 ?We found the Rabindra Sarani location perfect for the parking lot because it is close to the police headquarters,? the inspector added.

 The only hitch was the danger of the two-wheelers getting stolen. 

 ?It?s such a big problem that we even discussed it during the three-day seminar on organised crime in Mumbai last week,? said another detective department officer.

 The watchers, however, are ensuring that the cops are not divested of their wheels.

 An artist?s vision of Tagore

 Rabindranath Tagore is perhaps the most prominent figure on the Bengali cultural horizon who enjoys an all-pervasive presence upon our psyche, even to this day. Tagore continues to inspire and motivate us not only as a literary personality of great eminence, but as someone who, by his profound influence on Bengali life and culture as a whole, broadened our perspectives on life. Titled Kabi Pranam, the on-going exhibition of black-and-white sketches and illustrations on Tagore by Charbak Sen, is a sincere and creative effort to capture the poet?s mood at various stages of his life, and to offer an insight into the working of his mind during the time when he composed his immortal tunes and lyrics. A must-see for Tagore scholars and art-lovers alike, the exhibition will conclude with a Rabindrasangeet mela.

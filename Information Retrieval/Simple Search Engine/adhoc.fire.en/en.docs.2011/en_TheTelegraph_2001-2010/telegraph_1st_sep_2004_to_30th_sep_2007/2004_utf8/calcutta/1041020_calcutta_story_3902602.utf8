The first day of CESC The Telegraph 

True Spirit was an eye-opener from at least one aspect ? awareness.

Most judges were pleasantly surprised to see the 

level of commitment among organisers ? be it fire safety, need for toilets or 

electricity management. While some trudged the extra mile to have 24-hour ambulance 

and doctor facilities, or build the pandal adjacent to a waterbody, others, given 

space and resource constraints, didn?t fare poorly either.

In the end, what mattered was the right spirit.

Here?s what it looked like for three of the eight 

teams that did the rounds of 70-odd of the 115 True Spirit Pujas on Sashti morning.

 Route One: Rajdanga East Recreation Club, Bosepukur Sitala Mandir, Bosepukur Talbagan Sarbojanin, Ramlal Bazar Sarbojanin, Dakshin Purbo Dhakuria Sarbojanin, Sahid Nagar Sarbojanin, Jagaran Club.

Not a single tree cut for any of the pandals, toilet facilities everywhere, attention 

towards fire and electricity safety.

Almost no wastebins in sight.

 IMPRESSION: The Pujas on this route took the traditional trail. If Rajdanga had Purulia?s villages as the theme, Bosepukur Sitala Mandir had tribal art from Chhattisgarh and Ramlal Bazar had glimpses from the districts from Bengal. At Ramlal Bazar, the theme was dolls. The other predominant theme was Jamini Roy, with Bosepukur Talbagan and Jagaran Club emulating the master artist. The other standout was Shahid Nagar, with its pandal modelled on Nabakrishna?s dalanbari, complete with a naach ghar that had the babus enthralled by a baiji.

 Route TWO: Gopal Nagar Sarbojanin, Buro Sibtala Sarbojanin, Sabuj Sathi Sarbojanin, Prasanta Disa Sarbojanin, Adarsha Palli Sarbojanin, Sammilita Jayrampur Sarbojanin, Devdaru Phatak Sarbojanin, Behala Club, Nandana Yuba Sangha

 Fire-safety awareness and security measures.

Toilets in a ?kaku?s flat?, first-aid box in a ?kakima?s bari?, 

and dustbin in ?pasher goli?.

 IMPRESSION: An innocuous lane near the New Alipore petrol pump leads to a treasure trove tucked away in the recesses of Behala. Bringing up the front is Buro Sibtala Sarbojanin, in all leafy splendour. 

 Space constraint being a damper, the Puja organisers have done their best with fire fighting paraphernalia, right down to an alarm bell that goes clanging in case of a short-circuit. Pujas like Nandana Yuba Sangha and Behala Club are worth navigating lanes and bylanes for the d?cor and ambience of graam banglar pujo. These pandals along with Devdaru Phatak Sarbojanin should score high on the must-visit list. The swimming pool next to a pagoda-pandal at Adarsha Palli, Bastar art form at Prasanta Disha Sarbojanin, Haimanti Shukla and Rajeev Chakravarty?s music at Sabuj Sathi Sarbojanin, plumed dhaakis at Sammilita Jayrampur Sarbojanin are worth checking out, too.

 Route THREE: Sabeda Bagan, Barisha Netaji Sangha, Barisha Tapan Sangha, Barisha Srishti, Barisha Sahajatri, Barisha Shakti Sangha, Barisha Yubak Brinda Sarbojanin, Barisha Udayan Palli Sarbojanin and Bose Para Sarbojanin.

 Ready to combat potential fire hazard, goodbye gimmicks, return to roots? 

The gap between idea and implementation ? fake fire extinguishers, empty first-aid 

box and loud shouts about commitment to the true spirit.

 IMPRESSION: An overwhelming presence of folk art and culture mark these pujas on the southern fringes of the city. Despite their small scale and size, some of the pujas in Barisha can easily compete with the better-known extravagant ones.

The theme for the dream pujas here was rural and artistic. 

From north Bengal?s folk art in Tapaban to the setting of a village mela in 

Shakti Sangha, each had a story to tell, through the pandal or the pratima.

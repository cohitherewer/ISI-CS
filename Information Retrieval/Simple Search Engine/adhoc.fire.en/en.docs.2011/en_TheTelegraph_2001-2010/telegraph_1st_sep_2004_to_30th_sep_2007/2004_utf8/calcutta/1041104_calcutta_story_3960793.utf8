In the way: All steps lead to the pandal ahead

Apropos the report ?Court flies into road rage?, October 6, the roads of Calcutta seem to be nobody?s responsibility. Nobody bothers about the pitiable and dangerous condition of most roads, on which accidents have become a regular occurrence. 

 Responding to a PIL, Calcutta High Court had called for a detailed report on the city roads from the government and other civic bodies. But this did not elicit any serious response from the Public Works Department (PWD), Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) or Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). 

 The callous and carefree attitude of the PWD is reflected in its submission of a two-page report, which prompted the division bench to express strong dissatisfaction. The PWD lawyer admitted that his client ?had not paid enough attention to the court order?, although he had told this client that the court had taken the issue very seriously. 

 The CMC lawyer, on the other hand, did not attend court when the matter came up for hearing. He later said that ?he had been busy with another serious matter?. He had the gall to try to placate the court later during the day with the CMC?s report. This proves that not only did he give priority to his ?another serious matter? over the PIL, he had also taken it for granted that the judges would hear him whenever he pleased! 

 Result: The judges have asked the principal secretary of the PWD, the commissioner of the CMC and the chairman of the CMDA to appear in person before the division bench. 

 We get a clear and dismal view of the working of the government and civic agencies, which could not care less for the welfare of citizens who pay taxes to keep these agencies running. Not much can be said about other agencies such as the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and the Calcutta Tramways which also have their responsibilities. Let us hope good sense prevails on all of them soon. 

Ranesh Chandra Dey,

Parnashree. 

Apropos the report ?Road blocks in pandal raj?, October 4, blocking of roads by erecting pandals happens only for a few days during the festive season. Contrary to the report, this is not a regular feature. 

 The acting chief justice?s appeal to citizens to file a PIL against such road blocks so that an order can be passed for next year?s puja might bring relief to some. But does it really matter if we suffer for four-five days of merriment? 

 Most Bengalis are tolerant and I suppose they do not have much of a problem with the pujas being performed in the prevailing manner. 

 Instead, will Justice Roy pass a suo motu order against the permanent mess on APC Road (between Maniktala and Sahitya Parishad Street), Amherst Street and the Wellington Street crossing where encroachments inconvenience pedestrians and motorists? 

Diptimoy Ghosh, 

Salt Lake.

 Apropos the article ?Library launches title hunt in east?, October 5, it is true that small and medium publishers are unaware of the Mandatory Delivery of Books Act, 1954. Awareness should be generated so that National Library is not deprived of its legitimate gift from them and its stock does not suffer. 

Govinda Bakshi, 

Budge Budge.

The report ?Girl freed from employers?, October 4, is even more shameful as the incident occurred in the house of an officer of the World Health Organisation, whose wife is also the principal of a local kindergarten. Did the guilty know that the UNO, of which WHO is a nodal agency, is working against child labour? Locals should ostracise the tainted family unless the two apologise in public for their wrongdoing. 

Debyani Basu,

Birati .

The Left parties and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are engaged in a war of words while the malaria situation in the city steadily worsens (Malaria toll war hots up, October 6). The CMC and the state health department should work together. Their lackadaisical attitude is responsible for the situation. How long will we have to wait for a malaria-free city? 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

Apropos ?Grief amp; grit, hardship amp; heroism? (October 5), I was overwhelmed to read about the gesture of the teachers of Hariyana Vidya Mandir, Salt Lake, who contributed Rs 65,000 towards scholarships to poor and deserving children through The Telegraph Education Foundation (TTEF). I hope more schools follow the example. 

Kajol Mukherjee,

Delhi. 

My grandchildren are students of Hariyana Vidya Mandir. 

I was moved to read the report, from which I came to know of the great service 

that has been rendered by the teachers of my grandchildren. May the tribe of such 

spirited teachers grow in Calcutta. 

Jai Ram Aggarwala,

Black Burn Lane. 

Apropos the article ?Special normal in unison?, September 27, the school principal who made such harsh comments to the mother of a special child should be removed from her post. Teachers, especially those who interact with kids, should be polite and caring. What values will they impart to children otherwise? As the mother of a daughter with special needs (who goes to a Montessori) am I asking for too much? 

Hina Murtaza, 

Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road.

Apropos the report ?Punished, locked in class?, I had a similar experience in a public sector office 10 years ago. I was working late when a security guard, by mistake, locked me up and left. Before long, I was rescued by an administrative officer. But even at a mature age, I was shaken by the incident. So I can feel for the two hapless nine-years-olds. Their parents should consult psychiatrists. I demand exemplary punishment for those responsible for the incident. 

Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

Shibpur.

The dhakis are an indispensable part of the Pujas. Unfortunately, till this year, the dhakis were never given their due credit. Kudos to the contest organisers for offering awards to the best dhakis (?All sticks on the dhaak for puja talent hunts?, October 7). 

Sourish Misra, 

Salt Lake.

 A good voice and lots of sports stats at your fingertips? Not enough. Landing a job as a sports presenter with a premiere sports channel bouquet demands more. That was the message sent out by Ravi Shastri, Perizaad Zorabian and Darain Shahidi to scores of young aspirants gathered for the ?dream job? of a presenter with ESPN STAR Sports.

 After Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, the audition for Harsha Ki Khoj was held in Calcutta on Tuesday. And, it was ?by far the best city?, agreed the star judges panel of a cricketer, an actress and a commentator.

 Calcutta received the highest number of ?callbacks? among all the cities. Of the 60-odd shortlisted, 22 made it to round two and the judges were bowled over by the knowledge of sports, the participation from women and the vibes. 

 Based on one-minute voice-recordings, around 300 aspirants from Calcutta were called for screenings on Tuesday morning. Of these, 60-odd were selected for round one in front of the judges.

 At the audition, held in Hyatt Regency, participants were shown footage from an India-England ODI and asked to provide commentary in English or Hindi. There was a football option for soccer fans. 

 Participants ranged from bank employees to call centre executives, students to radio jockeys, but the common factor was a passion for sports. Some were nervous, some overexcited but all got great encouragement from the judges. ?More energy,? egged on Perizaad constantly. Shastri often took the more direct route. When a participant performed poorly in English and did better in Hindi, Shastri boomed: ?Abey, agey Hindi mein kyon nahin bola (Why didn?t you try in Hindi first)??

 The highlight of the audition was a surprise visit from Perizaad?s Jogger?s Park co-star Victor Banerjee, who was promoting a film at the hotel. ?Is he really here?? Perizaad kept asking till he finally barged in and a fond reunion was witnessed. 

 Victor?s advice to the aspirants: ?Be yourself. Don?t try to be an expert, talk for the audience.? Participant?s response to the hunt: ?I took the day off from work thinking it better be worth it. It was,? says IT professional Shomik Mukherjee.

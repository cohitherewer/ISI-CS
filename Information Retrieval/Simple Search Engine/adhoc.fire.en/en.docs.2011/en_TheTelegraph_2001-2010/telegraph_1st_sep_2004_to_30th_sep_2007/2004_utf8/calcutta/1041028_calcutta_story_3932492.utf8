 Flowers sell for a song

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Flowers sold for a song on Wednesday at Mullickghat market, but it cost the sellers dear. 

 Marigolds, tube roses, dopatis, bael, mango leaves and banana trunks ? essential items for Lakshmi puja on Wednesday ? had to be sold at throwaway prices because of excess supply from the morning, after a gap of two days. Sellers at the largest flower market in the state had no idea what to do with the excess stock. 

 ?Most of us have suffered tremendous losses. Flowers had become very expensive after the rains. But Wednesday?s rockbottom prices took us by surprise,? said Jagannath Mondol, a wholesaler at Mullickghat. 

 At least 10,000 to 12,000 quintals of flowers are brought to the market everyday. Supplies come from Kolaghat, Panskura, Ranaghat, Thakurnagar, Bhangar, Bagnan and Deulti, and are sold in the city and some surrounding districts like North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas and Howrah. 

 ?Growers tried to capitalise on the high prices prevailing during the Pujas. Prices had hit the roof then on account of the crops destroyed by floods. Today, growers sent excess stock leading to oversupply. Consequently, prices crashed,? said Sadhan Das, secretary, Mullickghat Phool Chashi Bikreta Union. 

 ?Anticipating good prices, many growers had harvested flowers while in the bud. Now they are trying to preserve the unsold stock in cold storage for Kali puja,? he added. 

 ?The demand for flowers is higher on the two days preceding Lakshmi puja,? said Tanuja Garai, another seller at the market. But the supply was meagre in the last two days, and many buyers at Mullickghat had to be turned down. Sales touched 5,000 quintals by Wednesday evening, against 9,500 quintals last year.

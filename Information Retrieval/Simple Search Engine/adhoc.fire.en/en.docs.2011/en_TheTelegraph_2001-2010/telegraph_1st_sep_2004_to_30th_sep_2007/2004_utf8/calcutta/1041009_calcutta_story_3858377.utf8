 Cop hunt for mystery dad

 OUR BUREAU

 Sleuths working on Susil Pal?s murder are now trying to identify the man who fathered the foetus that the gynaecologist was called to abort at a Bally nursing home on July 2.

 Police say Pal was killed at the nursing home after he refused to carry out the abortion on the grounds that the woman was in an advanced stage of pregnancy.

 Criminal Investigation Department (CID) sources said establishing the man?s identity is crucial. He is suspected to have played a pivotal role in getting Pal eliminated. 

 ?We have already traced the woman, who is a doctor. Having failed to get the foetus aborted, she gave birth to a deformed boy. She is now in Calcutta with her parents and we have approached her for help. We want to conduct a DNA test on the baby to establish his father?s identity,? said a senior CID officer. 

 The woman?s flat in Bally Bazaar has been sealed. ?We can?t disclose her name. She is now at her father?s home in Entally. We will talk to her to find out what exactly happened on the day of the murder,? said an investigator.

 Pal?s mud-caked body was found on the banks of a canal in Howrah?s Sankrail on July 3, a day after he left his Bright Street residence, in Karaya, and went missing.

 According to investigators, the woman was married to another doctor and had settled in Barisha, Behala. ?But they separated a few years ago. She has since been living alone,? said a sleuth.

 It?s believed that Biswajyoti Bose, member of the CPM?s Bally zonal committee and owner of the nursing home where Pal was killed, had helped her establish herself in Bally. Bose is now in custody.

 In course of the probe, police have come across two more names ? Benarashi Bapi and Shyamal Das, alias Hubba. ?Either Babi or Ramesh Mahato, arrested on Wednesday, was waiting in a Maruti van to receive Pal in Konnagar,? an officer informed.

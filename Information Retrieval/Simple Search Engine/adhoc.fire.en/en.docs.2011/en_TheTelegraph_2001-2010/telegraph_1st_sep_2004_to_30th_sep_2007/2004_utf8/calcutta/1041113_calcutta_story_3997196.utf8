Toon treat for tiny tots

SUDESHNA BANERJEE AND NISHA LAHIRI

Theatre 

and film, school and park, club and telly ? they?re all gearing up to help the 

kids have a blast this Children?s Day. There?s plenty planned around town. The 

attempt this year is to spread a little happiness by sharing the experience with 

the not-so-privileged youngsters. Here?s a taste of what?s to come. 

Montessori mania

The Montessories, of course, have a host of programmes 

lined up. This being the 25th anniversary of Joyland Play, Nursery and Kindergarten, 

the aim is to do something meaningful by involving the children of the NGO school 

Anandan. The toddlers of the two schools will be taking part in the Indian Chamber 

of Commerce?s Better Kolkata Contest. Members from the Chamber will be at the 

school celebrations on November 20.

Greenage Montessori House, too, will be spreading 

a little joy and festivity at a Children?s Day party on Saturday, November 13, 

at the school. The invitees include children of the Cathedral Relief Service. 

The tiny tots from the school will perform for the underprivileged children and 

serve them food. 

Hospitality high

Oberoi Grand has a rather special occasion in store 

for the children from the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy and underprivileged 

kids from Society for Indian Child Welfare. On November 13, they will all be treated 

to lunch at Gharana. The master chef has promised to prepare a mouth-watering 

Children?s Day Feast. The entertainment menu includes magic shows. 

DI is going the stylish way, with its first Children?s 

Day Fashion Extravaganza on Sunday. The children of the club will conduct the 

programme themselves, from DJing to choreography, compering to walking the ramp. 

Party in the park

Nicco Park has a couple of happenings. Akash Bangla 

has organised Aaj Amader Din on Sunday, with gameshows for the kids, a 

celebrity anchor, a panel of judges and a performance by a Bangla band. On November 

21, the Rotary Club of Calcutta will hold the 79th Annual Children?s Treat for 

nearly 2,000 orphans, underprivileged, mentally and physically-challenged youngsters 

from 35 institutions in the city. 

The daylong treats will include breakfast, snacks, 

lunch, soft drinks, ice creams and more, as well as joy rides, a magic show and 

other delights. Every child will receive gifts, while participating schools and 

institutions will be given sports goods.

Stage amp; screen

Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre in Salt Lake has a performance 

of Hirak Rajar Darbare planned, by Salt Lake Theatre at Bharatiyam on Sunday 

evening. This, even the parents are sure to enjoy.

Children?s Day holds out a big bonus on the small 

screen too. Jadoo (picture left), the loveable alien in Koi... Mil Gaya, 

is making a comeback. He is the star of J Bole Toh Jadoo, India?s first 

animation-cum-live action series to premiere on Children?s Day at 12 noon on Nick. 

And with Jadoo will be a huge cast ? Tona, Half Time, Ki2 and the like ? from 

his home planet Tarkopar. 

The series will be telecast in Hinglish. Shaan has 

hummed the title song and the promos feature Jadoo?s original buddy Hrithik Roshan 

himself. Tots in town can get to meet Jadoo in person at Forum and Nicco Park 

later.

The magic continues on the other channels. Cartoon 

Network has lined up a special recipe ? 100% Desi Toons. The 12-hour programming 

block, starting at 8 am, will feature a back-to-back hit parade of The Adventures 

of Tenali Raman, Jungle Tales and The Adventures of Chhota Birbal. 

Pogo has declared Sunday Tiny TV Day. Kids can spend 

7.30 am to midnight with their favourite characters Bob the Builder, Barney, Oswald, 

Teletubbies and the rest of the gang. A special treat is the Bugs Bunny Road 

Runner Movie at 7.30 pm.

For those on the look-out for action, tune in to Zee 

Cinema to go vrooming with the wonder car Taarzan at 12.30 pm.

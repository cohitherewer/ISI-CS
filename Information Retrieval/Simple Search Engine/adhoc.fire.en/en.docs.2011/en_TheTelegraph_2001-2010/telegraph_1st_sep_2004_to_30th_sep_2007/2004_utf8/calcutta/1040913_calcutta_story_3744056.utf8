Office Space

ZEESHAN JAWED SPENDS TIME AT A WORK 

STATION MADE MEMORABLE BY MEMORABILIA

There are offices and there are offices. Gone are 

the days of decrepit depression or forbidding facades. Now it?s all about cool 

comfort and the feel-good factor. Some do with clout, others with class. For some 

size matters, for others it?s the style that counts.

One such cool place is Trisys at 16A Sarat Chatterjee 

Avenue (close to Menoka cinema) that is a talking point for neither the size nor 

the spending. It is, simply put, made memorable by the memorabilia. This consultancy 

firm, which churns out annual reports for various corporate houses, does not believe 

in playing by the book when it comes to doing up its walls to inspire workforce 

and visitors alike. 

First love

Mudar Patherya started his career as a sports journalist 

with Sportsworld. And as he spent more time with cricketers past and present, 

Mudar started collecting things linked to the game. Some of these prized possessions 

find pride of place in his office space.

?I would receive a lot of letters from the likes of 

Sir Donald Bradman and Sir Gary Sobers. I was clever enough to preserve those 

pieces and now they adorn the walls of my conference room,? explains Mudar pointing 

at the letters and pictures of Don Bradman.

Though he never met the greatest batsman in the history 

of cricket, he did shake the hand that signed the personalised autograph adorning 

his office ? that of Steve Waugh, on one of his numerous trips to Calcutta.

Enamel boards

One collection that catches the eye immediately is 

that of enamel boards (signboards in the olden days were made on heavy iron sheets). 

Companies like Horse Head safety matches and Perfect hair oil might have shut 

down ages ago but their boards ? and many more ? have been preserved at Trisys. 

According to Mudar, some of them might be as old as 80 years and ?cost a fortune?.

The sole criterion for pricing the enamel boards, 

explains Mudar, is the age factor. ?On the face of it these might look like ordinary 

pieces of iron, but they really command a good price in the collectors? market,? 

he adds, casting an adoring eye on his latest possession, a Sanderman board, which 

cost him ?five grand?. 

Poetic license

Overlooking the lush green Dhakuria lakes, Trisys 

has a romantic feel to it. With floor to ceiling glass panels on two sides, the 

rainy afternoon and wet greenery, can poetry be far behind? But if you don?t have 

it in you to give form to your fantasy, just sit back and admire some of Sahir 

Ludhyanvi?s best works scripted ? in calligraphy ? on a wall.

?I am a great fan of this legendary poet and his verses 

motivate me,? says Mudar. The gramophone records from Sahir Ludhyanvi movies adorn 

another part of the wall.

Picture perfect

Take a turn off love lane and you bump into some of 

the greatest personalities of our times. ? I got this photograph of Mother Teresa 

autographed by her a few days before she passed away,? says Mudar, pointing at 

the solemn figure. One might have a tough time recognising the legendary Charlie 

Chaplin at the age of 65 or Carl Lewis racing with the wind in his birthday suit. 

Cricket makes a comeback in the photo gallery with a signed portrait of Sachin 

Tendulkar. ?I will always be thankful to Harsha (Bhogle) for this favour,? says 

the cricket crazy proprietor of the consulting firm.

Oh Calcutta!

These flights of fantasy, however, are all rooted 

in real-time Calcutta. If a vintage picture of Uttam and Suchitra greets you on 

arrival, it shares mind space with Rabindranath Tagore and Pather Panchali. 

If that?s not Calcutta enough for you, there?s a hand-pulled rickshaw (minus the 

wheels) leaning against one of the walls. ?The hand-pulled rickshaw is so much 

a part of the culture of our city. I got this one from Bhowanipore where they 

manufacture rickshaw parts. It?s a pity I cannot display it with its two wheels 

due to space constraints,? grumbles Mudar.

The Calcutta section also boasts handprints ? in a 

mix of plaster of Paris and Fevicol ? of heroes like Manna De, Sunil Gangopadhyay 

and Sourav Ganguly.

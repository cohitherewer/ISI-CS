 Radio collar to stem civic fuel fraud

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A collar to check fuel fudgers.

 The civic body plans to bring all its conservancy trucks, bulldozers and pay-loaders under a radio-collar scanner to stop the theft of fuel. The annual loss to the civic exchequer on this count has been estimated to be Rs 5 crore or more.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s fleet for garbage disposal comprises 150 trucks, seven pay-loaders and four bulldozers. Initially, the electronic device will be fitted to the pay-loaders and mechanical sweepers only. 

 The total project will cost Rs 50 lakh. Once all the trucks, pay-loaders and bulldozers are fitted with the device, their whereabouts will be tracked around the clock at the civic headquarters. 

 After the entire fleet is brought under the scanner, the contractors, who operate 150 trucks for conservancy services, will be persuaded to instal a similar device on their vehicles at their cost, said Rajib Deb, mayor-in-council member (conservancy). 

 Justifying the move to instal the scanner, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said: ?Theft has become a tradition in the civic body. No one knows for sure the exact loss to our exchequer because of theft. The cost of the fuel siphoned off by conservancy drivers against fake bills is no less than Rs 3 crore a year.?

 Since the radio-collar will enable civic officials to record the movement of every vehicle, it will be impossible for a driver to fudge the number of trips, the mayor added. 

 Shaktibrata Ghosh, officer on special duty to the mayor, recalled that during the tenure of the former Left Front board, then mayor-in-council member (conservancy) Kanti Ganguly had made an attempt to check theft of fuel. But he had to back out following pressure from trade union leaders of his own party. 

 According to the civic body?s estimate, more than 4,000 litres of fuel are siphoned off daily by producing fake bills. Contractors, too, in collusion with a section of employees in the conservancy department, follow the practice. 

 Last week, a company had demonstrated the working of the radio-collar scanner before municipal commissioner Debasish Som, mayor-in-council member Rajib Deb and chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Calcutta kaleidoscope 

Calcuttans going beyond the borders of Bengal and winning 

laurels, fame and fortune is not a new story. But seven leaders in one team, running 

the show? Yes, it?s possible, and happening in a Mumbai college, where a bunch 

of girls is creating waves with exceptional organisational skills. Young Metro 

catches the magnificent seven in action.

 Girl Power: The seven city girls on the 

organising committee take a break amidst the festive fever

Festival season is on in Mumbai, and Sophia College 

is in the throes of its annual affair, Kaleidoscope, which began on September 

7 and will be on till the 11. The organising team has been working day and night 

to make the festival a success. All the action happens in the office on campus, 

called the Den. But this year, there?s something special going on in there, with 

a distinct Calcutta connection.

Enter the Den and your ears prick up at the familiar 

words: ?Janish to, o ki bollo??, ?Eto chinta keno? Chill kor!?And 

the smiles are back on the faces. Yes it?s the Calcutta brigade, a part of Kaleidoscope 

2004. Even the Mumbaikars are catching on with the lingo fever imported from back 

home, with phrases like ?Bol to, ki holo?? flying thick and fast. 

Far away from home, yet at home, the Cal brigade works 

in tandem. Here are the dedicated members: 

Meghna Majumdar, ex-student of La Martiniere for Girls, 

is one of the five members of the organising committee. She?s the top boss and 

the rest work under her guidance. 

Priyanjoli Basu, ex-student of Modern High School, 

is the senior co-ordinator of the Fine Arts team. She gives an artistic touch 

to the entire festival by coming up with events like Chocolat (chocolate carving) 

and Sole to Soul (footwear-making). 

Megha Burman, ex-student of Loreto House, as the coordinator 

of the Informals team, makes everyone dance to the tunes played by the DJs and 

bands. As the name suggests, this team deals with the informal part of Kaleidoscope. 

Sunayana Sen, ex-student of La Martiniere for Girls, 

is the coordinator of SO!?, the Kaleidoscope magazine. What?s in, what?s 

out and what Kaleidoscope is all about ? the magazine covers this and more. 

Nayantara Dhir, ex-student of La Martiniere for Girls, 

and Ketki Bhojnagarwala, ex-student of Pratt Memorial, are the coordinators of 

the Literary Arts team. With their Shakespearean touch and intellectual talents, 

they come up with ordinary events like quiz, JAM, story writing, but with a twist, 

a mystery and lots of excitement. 

Preetika Bose, last but not the least, is an ex-student 

of La Martiniere for Girls and the one who does all the talking. She is the resident 

paparazzi at Kaleidoscope. Being the public relations coordinator, her job is 

to publicise the festival. 

The Cal team is busy kicking up quite a storm on campus. 

Its feet are planted firmly on Mumbai ground, but the roots are back in Calcutta.

What?s on your mind this week

Proud 

Indian

Independence Day is a special day, when we salute 

our heroes who have done so much for our motherland. It is only due to their efforts 

that we have enjoyed 57 years of independence. It is not just a celebration of 

victory, but a reinforcement of our friendship with our neighbours. Our politicians 

should look upon us youngsters as examples, since they have forgotten the art 

of co-existence. A big heart is a quality most Indians possess, and something 

we?re all proud of.

Counterpoint

According to Raffhat Mir?s letter on September 3, 

the results of a recent survey showed that a rape is committed every four minutes 

in India, which takes the tally to 360 rapes a day, 10,800 in a month and 1,31,400 

in a year. Yet, in the past one year, no one but Dhananjoy has been hanged for 

rape. The question is, are all the other 1,31,399 rapists relatives of politicians, 

since India is famous for the nexus between politicians and criminals? If Dhananjoy?s 

crime was heinous, aren?t all rapes so? There should not be different yardsticks 

to measure the same crime committed by different people of a similar nature. It?s 

also easier said than done when Raffhat criticised the support of Purnima for 

her husband.

Gaming goals

Another Olympics without a gold. Only Major Rathore?s 

silver medal came home. But all eyes were on Paes-Bhupati, Anju Bobby George and 

the weight-lifters.The government should recruit athletes from a very young age 

and train them. Fitness should be the main concern,without which we cannot excel 

in contact games like hockey and soccer, or even in power games like weight-lifting, 

boxing and sprinting, where skill is not all. India was a force to reckon with 

in hockey, but drifted down. The same might happen with cricket, if the game is 

globalised with Europeans and Americans taking part. Indians are mainly skill-oriented, 

thus games like shooting and archery should be encouraged, where we have a better 

chance.

Bias virus

Today?s society shouting for women?s rights is incapable 

of killing the virus that is bias. It has made life hell for so many young girls, 

suffering from depression because of the prejudice. In Main Hoon Na, the 

heroine is a tomboy because her father wanted a boy. This is the status of many 

others. Student counsellors say families encourage this practice. If it continues, 

what will be the outcome...?

Old age malady

It may not be befitting for the ailments of old age 

to find a place in a column for the youth, and yet, it is justifiable, for the 

problems of old age are intricately embroidered into the fabric of youthful extravagance. 

If humanity is to prevail, we must stand by those today who stood by us yesterday, 

physically and mentally. The reality is that most of us will perish through old 

age and this inevitable truth should keep the embers of our grandfathers, grandmothers, 

fathers and mothers glowing in our hearts.

Ode 

to Teachers

Oh, teacher, you inspire me to believe that life is 

worthwhile, 

You encourage me to face everything with a smile,

You scold us but your scoldings inspire us, 

You have always been a friend, philosopher and guide to us, 

Your concern for us as a friend never made us realise that you were our teachers,

If your happiness is measured by the love that we bring to you, 

Then you?ll have happiness enough to last, 

The whole life through. 

Soumya Verghese

The Invisible Hand

Plentiful ?manna? 

For a handful of people. 

The sacrifice for the land of milk and honey; 

The Red Sea parted, 

When Moses commanded.

Faith in God 

Being true, although limited, 

Gives power unlimited. 

Like a river with tributaries, 

Each a different name of God, has 

Different ways of reaching the sea. 

The sea is heaven 

And we humans, 

Insignificant marine creepy-crawlies.

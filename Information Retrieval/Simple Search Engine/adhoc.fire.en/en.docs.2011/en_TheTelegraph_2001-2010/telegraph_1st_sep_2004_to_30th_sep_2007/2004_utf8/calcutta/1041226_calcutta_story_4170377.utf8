The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Of broken wings

... But now we have a reason to live ? to learn, to 

discover, to be free!? These are lines from Jonathan Livingston Seagull, 

a book by Richard Bach, and my most prized possession.

Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a unique bird who teaches 

us to follow our dreams and reach our goals, no matter what anyone else might 

think. Jonathan is a seagull who wants to master the art of flying, even though 

his flock has told him many times that all seagulls should concentrate on is getting 

food. Flight is indeed the metaphor that makes the story soar.

In the present times, what a contrast confronts us! 

For birds, flying is an integral part of their very life, but they are kept in 

cages for entertainment (read: bird shows and personal pets). Is this what 

mankind has been reduced to? I wonder if you are aware of the cruelty involved 

in caging an animal meant to fly high and free. Pause and ponder.

Enslaved and Stressed

There is no such thing as a ?cage bird?. All caged 

birds are either captured or captive-bred. No bird was born to be in a tiny prison. 

In the wild, these beautiful beings are never alone, and if separated even for 

just a moment, they call wildly to their flock. Flock-oriented, they fly together, 

play, and share egg incubation duties. Many species of birds mate for life and 

share parenting tasks. Most birds will not take a second mate in the wild if the 

first is lost.

Hand-raised as well as wild-caught birds often become 

neurotic, pulling out feathers and mutilating themselves, sometimes to the point 

of death.

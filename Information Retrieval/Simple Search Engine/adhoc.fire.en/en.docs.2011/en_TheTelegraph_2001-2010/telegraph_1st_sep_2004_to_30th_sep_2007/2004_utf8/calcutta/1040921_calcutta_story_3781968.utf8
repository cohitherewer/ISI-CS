 Hooch binge leaves 8 dead, count rising

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A night-long binge on country liquor on Vishwakarma puja has left eight persons dead and many battling for life in and around Dum Dum. 

 The Saturday night bash, at a taxi stand near the Old Airport post office, started taking its toll late on Sunday, when the revellers complained of severe breathing problems. Since Monday morning, the death count kept rising at a local nursing home and RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

 Curiously, while local residents and civic officials are convinced that the deaths were caused by the spiked hooch, the government and the police are refusing to accept this. 

 ?The needle of suspicion points to the biryani the revellers had consumed with the liquor,? said Chayan Mukherjee, inspector-general of police (law and order). 

 Excise minister Probodh Sinha asserted that his department had received no reports of hooch deaths.

 Desperate to keep the incident under wraps, the police first claimed that only three persons had died. Persistent queries forced them to revise the figure to eight. Unconfirmed sources, however, pegged the toll at 11. A few, the sources said, were not present at the taxi stand, but had consumed the liquor at home. 

 The dead have been identified as Laxman Roy (38), Asraf Ali (35), Purnajyoti Deb Burman (32), Sunil Ray (30), Subir Das, Dhana Dutta, Hemanta Naik and Shyamal Mondal. All were residents of Kalidhan Colony, near airport gate No. 2.

 Late on Monday, doctors at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital?s emergency ward said quite a few patients from the Dum Dum locality were admitted with acute breathing problems. 

 ?A few have been admitted to the municipality hospital as well. We believe the number will rise,? said Deepak Bhattacharjee, chairman of the Dum Dum municipality.

 The family members of the victims were reluctant to admit that the tragedy was caused by the hooch. ?He was suffering from chronic asthma and died this morning,? said Dhana Dutta?s brother. 

 ?The hunt is on to trace the shop/shops that had sold the liquor,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 British industry beckons India

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Recognising the potential of India Inc, the UK Trade amp; Investment ? the government body responsible for providing support and services to foreign businesses choosing the UK for setting up business ? is now focusing on Indian companies. 

 As part of the exercise, aimed at helping Indian corporations to expand into the UK, the department launched a publication, Infinite Possibilities:A Guide to Establishing a Presence in the UK, in Calcutta on Thursday. 

 Andrew Hall, the British deputy high commissioner to eastern India, launched the publication at a function attended by city-based industrialists and government officials.

 ?We are aware of the global realities and we do consider India as an important source of investments into the UK,? said Stephen Lillie, director, UK Trade amp; Investment during the function. 

 He also added that the booklet was not just ?propaganda? tool, as it was brought out jointly with Nasscom. 

 At present, 480 Indian companies have operations in the UK. Official statistics suggest 28 new investments from India were established in the UK in 2003-04, which created 646 jobs. The trend is positive this year as well, said Lillie. 

 While the UK government wing is looking at India as a whole as an important source for investment, east ? especially Calcutta ? is important, mentioned Mark Dolan, deputy director, inward investment. 

 According to him, since the focus is knowledge-based companies, the region is very much on the UK agenda. 

 The team met various state government representatives during its stay in Calcutta and met some potential investors. 

 ?Though the focus is knowledge economy companies, that does not mean we are looking only at the IT companies, we are looking at the whole spectrum ranging from biotechnology to high-end engineering,? said Dolan.

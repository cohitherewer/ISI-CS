The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bicker on, bouquets off

 - Zee-Turner switch-off greeted with STAR, Sony blackout

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The STAR and Sony channel bouquets disappeared from TV screens in around 1.5 lakh homes across the city on Tuesday evening, as the stand-off between broadcaster Zee-Turner and multi-system operator (MSO) RPG Netcom prevailed.

 RPG Netcom, which doubles as the distributor of the bouquets, switched off the channels on the network of Calcutta Communications (CalCom), a unit of the Zee Group-owned MSO SitiCable, on grounds of huge outstanding dues and lack of correct subscriber base information.

 Areas affected by the blackout include Ballygunge, Park Circus, Entally, College Street and VIP Road. The channels include STAR Plus, STAR Movies, National Geographic, SET Max, HBO, AXN and Discovery. News and free-to-air channels like STAR News and Channel V, however, have not been affected.

 The number of affected homes was higher on Tuesday as Purvi Communications, another unit of SitiCable, recently merged with CalCom.

 According to RPG Netcom, a large number of cable operators migrated to CalCom in July and August this year, but CalCom has not been paying STAR and Sony for services provided by them. RPG Netcom claims dues of around Rs 80 lakh from CalCom for the STAR and Sony packages.

 On Monday, Zee-Turner had served a legal notice on RPG Netcom, claiming payment for bounced cheques worth Rs 1.7 crore. Zee-Turner had earlier switched off its channels on RPG Netcom.

 CalCom had been providing assurances since June, but none were fulfilled, said a spokesperson for RPG Netcom, who denied that the move was retaliatory. We sent several reminders, the last one on August 26, but to no avail. So, we had to take this step.

 A similar blackout had taken place on CalCom in May and June. We came across anomalies during reconciliation and have not been able to enter into a business agreement since correct subscriber base information has not been provided, the RPG Netcom spokesperson alleged.

 SitiCable officials rubbished the claims. Its nothing but an act of revenge from RPG Netcom, said a CalCom spokesperson. We have no dues and the subscriber report issue has been settled. The anomalies are to be rectified by them and not us, he explained. Unfortunately, for RPG Netcoms highhandedness, viewers will have to suffer, he added.

 Tale of tradition, talent

 Born in Paris of French parents and brought up amid Indian culture at home, what could Isabelle Anna grow up to be? ?I tried to do many other things when I was 18 ? computers, office work? I was good in dance, drama, music? I played the piano well. But something was missing,? mused the 28-year-old, playful fingers on the piano keys in Calcutta School of Music.

 Isabelle found that ?something? in kathak. After seven years of training, four of them spent in Delhi, she is on her first tour of India, organised by Alliance Francaise. When she took the stage at Sandre Hall on Saturday evening, there must have been quite a few fond faces watching over the daughter of Milena Salvini and Roger Filipuzzi.

 ?Many people in the cultural circuit here know my parents,? admitted Isabelle, during a break in her rehearsals. After all, Mandapa, ?a small and humble place? that they started in Paris in 1975, has been actively promoting Indian culture. ?Many great Indian artistes have performed there ? Pandit Kelucharan Mahapatra, Pandit Birju Maharaj, Ustad Sultan Khan, Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma??

 Mandapa practically introduced kathakali to France. Isabelle?s mother was a researcher in dance forms and had come down to Kerala and Santiniketan ?some 40 years ago?. She stopped dancing once Isabelle was born. ?As a five-year-old, I was looking at others dance at the Mandapa school and? I just joined them,? says the daughter who did what came naturally to her. That was Bharatanatyam though, which she continued for 15 years. She also started ballet lessons at the age of seven, but it was when the school included kathak that the option opened to her.

 ?It has everything I like ? music, through the way we count the parant (beat; she writes the term in Hindi apologising for her pronunciation), and drama, through the expressions. And the style of the dance, which is so graceful with so much virtuosity of footwork. I think it matches my personality,? she smiles.

 After training with Sharmila Sharma, her ?first guru?, Isabelle applied for a scholarship from Indian Council for Cultural Relations and enrolled at Kathak Kendra in Delhi. ?It is a must for a student from a different culture to go to the source country,? she insists. Isabelle completed her diploma in 2003 but she ?just could not go away? and is now doing her post-diploma under Pandit Jay Kishan Maharaj.

 Isabelle?s performance is broken into the traditional and non-traditional. Kathak, she says, is a mix of ?so many cultures? that jugalbandi is what her choreographies attempt. ?My steps are kathak while the music is western ? some tango, some Hispanic, some Persian and some medieval Italian.?

 Once her course ends in 2006, Isabelle will be back to her homeland with a mission ? spreading kathak in Europe.

 And Isabelle?s interest in India does not stop on the stage. After seeing her write in Hindi, getting to hear of her love for Hindi films does not come as a surprise. ?Not the new kind,? she protests. 

 ?I love films on dance ? Jhanak Jhanak Payal Bajey, Mughal-e-Azam, Taj Mahal, Anar-kali? My favourite is Pakeezah.?

 A taste of Tollywood

 Tollywood is something you need to chew on, at least if you are on VIP Road. A first-time restaurateur team of two brothers has come up with a caf? on the Big Bazaar premises called Tollywood.

 ?Hollywood and Bollywood have lots of things named after them so we thought being a Calcutta outlet we needed to do something for Tollywood, too,? said Rajdeep Shaw, who owns the outlet.

 So, if a blood-stained Prosenjit fighting a baddie greets you over the food counter, a smiling Rituparna Sengupta ups the glamour quotient.

 But if Prosenjit and Rituparna are not your gig, there is an overdose of Bangla band music as the official background score to make you feel at home.

 An innovative clap-stick menu card lists the large variety of sandwiches, milkshakes, pizzas, burgers and other fast food items on offer.

 On this first-floor address off VIP Road, you also stand the chance of running into family friends dining at the adjacent multi-cuisine restaurant called City of Joy. Another addition to the food platter in the zone, the interiors of this 50-cover family eatery are warm and cosy with steel grey sofas and colourful orange table linen conjuring up a homely feel.

 The food can easily be graded above average, especially keeping in mind the price list that goes with the range of Italian, Chinese and Indian delicacies. The Indian section scores well above the other two sections. Try the kebabs for sure and nibble at the masala naan with some tomato paneer.

 Speciality dishes include Pahari 

 Aloo (baby potatoes cooked in a paste of green coriander, 

 mint and green chillies with yoghurt gravy), Chatpata Murg 

 (batter fried chicken tempered with curry leaves, mustard 

 seeds and red peppers) and Achari Gosht (pickled lamb cooked 

 in Nawabi style).

 ?We have tried to bring some innovative 

 dishes to go with the innovative nature of the place,? said 

 Zakee Khan, consultant chef of the outfit.

 Red rebel: Dolled-up 

 Debasree comes of age

 Let the Rituparnas and Rachanas 

 prance around the trees, the mature-woman roles are all 

 rolling Debasree Roy?s way. She?s a schoolteacher who falls 

 in love with a much younger man in Bratya Basu?s Teesta, 

 and a rich rebellious wife who dumps her gawky husband for 

 a Casanova in Sushanta Mukherjee?s Je Jon Thake Majhkhane. 

 ?Both the roles are quite challenging and I am happy doing 

 them,? says she, shooting for the last leg of Je Jon...

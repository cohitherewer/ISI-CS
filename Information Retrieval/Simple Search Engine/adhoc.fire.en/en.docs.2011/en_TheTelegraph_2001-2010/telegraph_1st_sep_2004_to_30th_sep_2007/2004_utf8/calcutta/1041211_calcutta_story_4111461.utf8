 A golden career in dance

 Shanti Bose, the renowned dancer and Ballet Master of Uday Shankar, shared the stage with him on his tours worldwide for more than a decade. He is now on the threshold of completing an illustrious, successful and immensely rewarding career, spanning 50 years. To mark this glorious occasion, an exhibition of rare photographs taken at different periods of Boses long artistic career is being showcased. Featuring over 130 richly vivid images that capture the very essence of Uday Shankar?s unique style of dancing, the photographs fascinate and inspire awe through their sheer power, passion and energy, evoked by Bose?s facial expressions and body language. A remarkable quality about the photographs is that the technical excellence of the images serves to heighten and accentuate the aesthetic beauty of the compositions.

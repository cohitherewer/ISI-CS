The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Nostalgia nest, new notes

 Come Sunday and it would be back to the swinging Seventies at Trincas.

 Trincas Rocks, the six-day music fiesta, would have a mix of new and old bands belting out a music medley every evening, post 9 pm, from November 21.

 Park Street was once synonymous with live bands playing at every other restaurant on the stretch. Greats like Louiz Banks, Gary Lawyer and Usha Uthup are known to have made it big after a humble beginning at Park Street.

 The Sixties and the Seventies saw the rise of these stars and a distinct culture revolving around rock music at small places. But the Eighties heralded a huge slump when Bappida reigned supreme and the entire nation grooved to the beat of Disco Dancer.

 ?Good music took a backseat everywhere and the fallout was felt in Calcutta also. But things are looking up,? says Deepak Puri, owner of Trincas. And he speaks not just for ageing patrons looking for a taste of nostalgia but for the yuppy brigade fed on peppy remixes, as well.

 ?We are witnessing a decent turnout of youngsters here and things are only looking to improve with time,? adds Puri.

 Skinny Alley that has a long legacy of live performances in town would be jamming at Trincas for the first time, ever. ?This is our debut at Trincas and we hope we get as good a response as we get at the neighbouring Someplace Else,? says Jayshree Singh, a sentiment all her band members share.

 But will this effort revive the old era and get people at dinner tables hooked to live music? ?It will require some perseverance and patience to get things rolling,? warns Jayshree.

 That should come easy to an address that has so often given live music its due. The winds of change seem to be blowing hard at the Park Street address, too. Bangla rock bands, something of a rage with the young and not so young, are all set to make their debut at Trincas.

 ?Ignoring Bengali bands would be a blunder because they command a big market share now. A lot of ideation has taken place in Bengali music in the past decade. So it is time they get their due,? says Puri.

 If the sponsorship details are worked out the bands will start singing from the 12th of next month. For starters, the owner can think of the big three of the Bangla band circuit rocking the scene at Park Street.

 ?It would be a pleasure to have Bhoomi, Chandrabindoo and Cactus playing at Trincas,? feels Puri.

 Coming back to the music medley, sample the fun first hand when Skinny Alley, New Identity, Shiva, Wired, Barefoot and, of course, Usha Uthup rule the autumn nights, starting Sunday.

 While the song list will depend on the mood and the genre of listeners, most bands are sure to belt out a lot of their own tracks.

Short take on strife 

 Poetry on celluloid is how Sharmy Pandey likes to describe her short film that had a world premiere at the Alternative Film Festival in Picciano, Italy, but was refused a screening at the 10th Kolkata Film Festival for its bold theme. Ebang Falguni, the 21-minute non-biographical short on Hungry Generation poet Falguni Roy, will now travel to the River Florence Indian Film Festival next month.

 Men in masks smoking grass or guzzling hooch, rainbow lights streaming out of vehicles in the dark, a man being chased through a brothel, snatches of the city ? the visual collage brings home a sense of the inner turbulence and strife that differentiated the writers of the Alternative literary movement in Bengal of the Sixties.

 ?Roy was rebellious in spirit and so his writings speak of sexual politics. The scenes of male nudity were essential to portray his perspective. But I had to face a lot of problems finding the cast who could do the masturbation scene,? says the 30-year-old first-time film-maker, who was later bailed out by a Rabindra Bharati University student.

 Sharmy, a writer herself with six books to her credit, feels the little-known poet who was discovered two decades after his death still connects with the modern mind with the sense of claustrophobia and insecurity. For the script of Ebang Falguni, Sharmy chose bits and pieces of prose and poetry from Roy?s works and stitched them to form a narrative that could capture the essence of his ideology. Roy lived for 36 years and died of a drug overdose in the early 80s.

The crush: What happens when Sanjay meets 

Raima

He loves our phuchkas, is all smiles when cornered 

by autograph-hunters and wants to visit the Kalighat temple. But a tight shoot 

schedule has kept Sanjay Dutt tied to the sets of Pradeep Sarkar?s Parineeta 

. ?He is very patient, quiet and cooperative. I have a huge crush on him in 

the film,? says Raima Sen whose character, Koel, goes on to marry Girish (Sanjay). 

?He?s a man whose life story will make the greatest biography of any Indian actor, 

ever,? says co-star Saif Ali Khan.

 Air-borne missives of change

 Sansriti presents its latest production, Phataru, a play with a clear political message ? drive out the self-righteous establishment with its market-driven initiatives and usher in an age of social and economic equality. Based on a story by Nabarun Bhattacharya, the play deals with the revolutionary struggles of the subaltern class in trying to destroy the foundations of capitalism. Supported by an apparently absurd and loose plot, the play introduces us to its three eccentric characters, Madan, Purandhar Bhatt and DS. In its use of unrealistic dramatic devices, such as its flying militants who can take flight on chanting their magical mantra Phat Phat Sai Sai and a richly metaphoric but imaginary language, lay hidden the radical thoughts and ideas of the three protagonists. Directed by Debesh Chattopadhyay, Phataru takes a bold step towards building a classless society.

 With the city retaining its pole position in terms of viewership of sporting events ? from soccer to wrestling and cricket to athletics ? and the local markets showing signs of growth, sports marketers are eyeing Calcutta with renewed interest.

 ?The city?s attachment to sports was always beyond doubt, but the small size of the market kept the sponsors away. Recent trends, however, suggest a different story and we are focusing on Calcutta,? Navneet Sharma, managing director, Total Sports Entertainment India (TSEI), told Metro on Saturday.

 From organising Futsal (five-a-side soccer) to hosting an international half-marathon, the integrated sports management company ? a wholly-owned subsidiary of Total Sports Asia with offices in China, Japan and Indonesia ? is drawing up a busy events calendar for Calcutta.

 ?We have decided to use soccer and running events to drive our initiatives in this part of the country,? mentioned Sharma, in the town for talks with some partners of the company that commenced India operations in July.

 The schedule for the five-a-side football is tentatively fixed for March 2005, in which members of winning teams from six districts will get a chance to tackle the Bhaichung Bhutias. The half-marathon would hit the road ?in a year?s time?, felt Sharma.

 The first round of Futsal talks with officials of East Bengal and Mohun Bagan has already taken place. Discussions have even veered towards helping the two clubs with their product merchandise.

 ?Sports marketing is a new industry, but it is growing very fast. The size of the industry today is around Rs 600 crore, excluding television rights, and we think it will grow exponentially,? said Sharma, adding that TSEI was ready to roll out a host of regional initiatives to tap unexplored territories.

 Offering ?360 degree solutions?, the company?s recent initiatives include distribution of the Copa America football tournament, the event management of Hyundai 2004 Football World Championship and the World Wrestling Enterprise (WWE) live events.

 ?The response was satisfactory, but WWE is one of the strongest brands. Given its popularity, we are planning a live show somewhere in Asia,? he said, adding that WWE has given a phenomenal boost to Perfetti Van Melle, one of its customers. Others on the list include Cadbury, Kwality Walls and Ten Sports.

 TSEI is also scouting for young talent in the age group of 15 years and above and helping them get sponsors. ?Not just cricketers, stars can be made from other sports, too. And we will soon make our foray into the world of entertainment where we will be focusing on fashion, which is fast catching on among the young generation here,? summed up Sharma.

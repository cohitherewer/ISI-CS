 Screen snag holds up Ray fest

 - Local halls ill-equipped to project prints restored by US academy

 Satyajit Ray: Festival under cloud

 Calcutta, cradle of Satyajit Ray?s creativity, is not equipped to screen his masterpieces, restored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Not till well into 2005, at least.

 With 15 restored films and the controversial documentary Sikkim, the Satyajit Ray Film Festival was scheduled to take off on December 10 at Priya and at Nandan or Mitra. But a technical hitch has cast a cloud over the weeklong festivity co-ordinated by Ray Society in Calcutta and the Ray Film And Study Collection (Ray FASC), University of California.

 ?The festival had to be postponed because the platter projection used in the halls, except Nandan, cannot be used under the Academy?s norms. It hurts the negative by leaving scratches, which the Academy cannot permit,? Prof Dilip Basu, founder-member of Ray FASC, said on Friday.

 ?Also, the illumination level at Nandan is 50 per cent and the Academy is not ready to show the Ray films in half-light. The halls will take some time to upgrade and the festival will happen some time next year,? he added.

 The 15 restored films are the Apu trilogy, Postmaster, Samapti, Abhijaan, Jalsaghar, Devi, Nayak, Mahanagar, Charulata, Simabaddha, Goopi Gayen Bagha Bayen, Jana Aranya and Two (a 16-minute television film made in 1964). The decision to put the festival on hold was taken on the basis of a report submitted by Soumendu Ray, who checked out the projection quality at Priya, Mitra and Nandan.

 ?We have been holding international film festivals for a long time and no one has ever said our illumination quality is bad,? argued Nandan director Ansu Sur.

 There is a question mark over whether the festival will happen at all, with money matters (to invest or not to invest) and power play (this hall is better than that) adding to the technology tussle. ?The difference in the cinema carbon quality has posed a problem. It doesn?t make sense to spend Rs 1 lakh on the carbon just for a week. And even if we buy the required carbon, the rectifier attached to it won?t stand the load,? said Arijit Dutta, owner of Priya, who claims to have suffered ?a huge loss? over the postponement.

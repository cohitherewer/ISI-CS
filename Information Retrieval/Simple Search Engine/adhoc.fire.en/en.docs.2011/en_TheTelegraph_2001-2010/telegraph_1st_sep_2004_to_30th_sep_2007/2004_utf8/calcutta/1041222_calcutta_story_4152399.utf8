The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Taint tag sparks water test scurry

 A STAFF REPORTER 

FLUID FEARS

 Areas: Beleghata, Kasba, Tiljala and other 

areas in the city and beyond

Contamination: Faecal

Risks: Jaundice, typhoid, hepatitis 

(both A and E)

 63.66 per cent of CMC water samples collected 

from 660 public points in the city were found faecally contaminated

 87.5 per cent of underground and overhead 

water tanks of city households were contaminated

After air, it?s the quality of water in city hospitals 

that has been put under the scanner. 

 If health department insiders are to be believed, the water in use in all the major government hospitals in the city is impure. While the mandarins are not willing to spill the beans ? evidently to avoid a panic reaction ? the quality of water used by thousands every day at these institutions have been quietly put to test. 

 Last week, the director of medical education and his counterpart in the health services department called upon the superintendents of all the major government hospitals and asked them to set up a dedicated unit for monitoring the quality of water.

 Officers from the public health engineering department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation were also roped in to thrash out the issue of water safety on an emergency basis. 

 ?Reports pouring in from a few of the institutes have jolted us. The hospitals have been asked to carry out the necessary tests at the labs. Besides, the hospitals have been directed to set up a dedicated unit for monitoring the water quality,? said Prabhakar Chatterjee, director of health services.

 The knee-jerk reaction comes in the wake of the recent findings of the public health wing of the health department, claiming outbreak of jaundice and typhoid due to contamination of water at a few places in the city ? including Beleghata, Kasba and Tiljala ? and its adjoining areas. 

 The report added that water supply to a few of the medical institutions, including Calcutta Medical College, should immediately be checked for quality owing to contamination reports.

 Besides checking the water samples in its own lab, the wing had sent samples to the central combined lab.

 ?Most of the medical institutions have different supplies of water, including the ones provided by the civic authorities and public health engineering department. Besides, water is also drawn from underground reservoirs,? said a senior officer of the wing.

 ?We suggested that all these sources be thoroughly checked to cut down on chances of viral hepatitis, both A and E types,? he added.

 This, in fact, is not the first observation of its kind. 

 According to a survey carried out by the Union ministry for food and consumer affairs ? covering samples from the CMC?s consumer points, handpumps and overhead and underground tanks of city residents ? 63.66 per cent of CMC water samples collected from 660 public points in the city were found to be ?faecally contaminated.?

 The survey also revealed that 87.5 per cent of underground and overhead water tanks were also contaminated.

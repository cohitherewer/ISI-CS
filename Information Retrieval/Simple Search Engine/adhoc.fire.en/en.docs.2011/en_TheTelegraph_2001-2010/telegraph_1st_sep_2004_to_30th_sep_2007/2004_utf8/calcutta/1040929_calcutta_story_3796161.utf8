The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Any mass transport system is bound to have diverse kinds of commuters. And 

our local trains are no exceptions. While some smoke inside the compartment, others 

play cards, yet others make a lot of noise and block extra seats for their friends. 

Add to that hawkers, pickpockets and beggars. The atmosphere is definitely not 

suitable for commuting. As a consequence, people are shifting to chartered buses, 

pool cars, taxis and other modes of transport. If only the authorities can maintain 

a pleasant environment in the local trains through routine checks, the number 

of commuters can be increased. This will reduce traffic congestion and vehicular 

pollution on the roads and also increase the revenue of the railways.

 I have noticed that of late, most of the LPG cylinders supplied by Indane are 

battered and twisted out of shape. Besides, most have rust-coated bodies from 

which the red paint had peeled off long ago. This happens because the cylinders 

are thrown around by the people responsible for delivering them to the suppliers, 

and thereafter by the men who carry the refills from home to home. Refills meet 

with the same fate during home delivery when they are dragged up staircases, breaking 

the stairs and battering the cylinders as well. If we ever refuse to accept battered 

cylinders, the delivery men demand a hefty tip. Their logic is that since we can 

afford to pay for refills at enhanced rates, we should not be so tightfisted when 

it comes to them. I shudder to think of the consequences in case the cylinders 

spring leaks. The refills of private suppliers, however, never look this bad.

 Urmila Nayak, Bentinck Street. 

 The concept of harvesting rainwater should be put into practice in the city, 

as the area received good rainfall. Multi-storeyed buildings should construct 

rainwater reservoirs to help them tide over shortage of water. Other Asian countries 

like Japan and Thailand are already reaping the benefits of rainwater harvesting. 

With the water table receding at an alarming level and in view of the increasing 

cost of supplying water to domestic households, municipal authorities should seriously 

consider this option.

 Most parts of Bangur and Dum Dum Park are inundated with water overflowing 

from the Bagjola canal after every heavy downpour. Although assurances are given 

before the elections for dredging of the canal, these promises do not yield fruit. 

It is understood that dredging is not possible until the unauthorised occupants 

along the canal are evicted. But why should genuine tax-payers like us suffer 

because of the unauthorised occupants? Those at the helm of affairs are evading 

the issue by declaring that pumps are operated at Bangur to drain the accumulated 

water back into the canal. That is not a permanent solution. 

 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane.

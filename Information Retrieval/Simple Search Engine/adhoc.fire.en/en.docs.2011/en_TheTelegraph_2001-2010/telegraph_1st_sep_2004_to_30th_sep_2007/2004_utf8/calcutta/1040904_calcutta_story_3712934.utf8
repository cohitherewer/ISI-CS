The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Learning through dance

 In an effort to re-establish the idyllic childhood that has been ruthlessly erased from the lives of todays children, Shinjan Nrityalaya presents Kautuk, a childrens soiree based on the stories of the Panchatantra, and Circus, a purely fun-based program. Children from various institutions in the city, including Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, come together to present the show that is for children, by children and is very simply aimed at making our little citizens happy. The children perform five stories from the Panchatantra, which teach them the art of living in which security, prosperity, resolute action, friendship and good learning are combined to produce happiness. A fun program with a subtle dash of morals thrown in for good measure. Concept, choreography and direction by Aloka Kanungo.

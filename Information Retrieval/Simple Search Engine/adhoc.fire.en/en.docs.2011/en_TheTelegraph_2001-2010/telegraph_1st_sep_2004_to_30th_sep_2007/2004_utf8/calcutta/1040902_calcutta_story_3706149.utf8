 2 women found dead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two housewives lost their lives in Howrah on Wednesday. One of them, who lived in Nazirgunge police outpost, was allegedly killed by her husband. The other woman, who lived in Naskarpara Road, hanged herself. 

 Ratna Sahas body was recovered from her garden. According to the complaint lodged with the police by her brother, Arabindo Dhara, she was tortured and killed by her husband Bablu Saha, a garment shop-owner. 

 Police said Ratna and Bablu were married 12 years ago, and since then she had been tortured for money, as Sahas business was in the red. 

 Ratna, a Calcutta Telephones employee, would meet her husbands demands because he threatened her with divorce. This she wanted to avoid for the sake of their son, 11. Howrah superintendent of police, Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, said Bablu was arrested on the basis of the FIR and a probe is underway. Neighbours first saw the body and called in the police. 

 In the second incident, police found the body of a 25-year-old housewife, identified as Sanjita Verma, from her Naskarpara Road residence, in the Malipanchghara police station area, on Wednesday afternoon. She was found hanging from the ceiling fan in her bedroom. 

 Police suspected it to be a case of suicide, though she left behind no note to that effect. After receiving complaints from her father, police held her in-laws for interrogation. Her husband Surjit, a taxi driver, is absconding.

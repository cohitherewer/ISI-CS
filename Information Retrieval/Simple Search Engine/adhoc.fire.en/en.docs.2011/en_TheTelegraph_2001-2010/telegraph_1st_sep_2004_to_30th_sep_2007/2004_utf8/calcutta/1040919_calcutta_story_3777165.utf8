The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Recommends

THE VCD 

 (Landmark, Rs 299) This 1959 classic on a Jewish prince who seeks revenge after 

being betrayed and sent to slavery by a Roman friend smashed all box-office records. 

Starring Charlton Heston and Jack Hawkins, the film won a record 11 Oscars.

 THE SHOW

 (CIMA Gallery, 11 am to 8 pm, from September 21) An impressive collection of 

brassware, clothes, table and bed linen, folk and tribal art, jewellery, carpets, 

wall-hangings, stationery and other artefacts gathered from across India. For 

all the exotic items you always wanted but never found. 

THE EVENT

 (Forum 

and City Centre, weeklong) Making the countdown to the festival even more exciting 

is this shopping-is-fun extravaganza with special discounts and special shows. 

If the high point of September 21 is a fashion show for kids, actress Sreelekha 

Mitra (picture below) will do the star turn on September 22.

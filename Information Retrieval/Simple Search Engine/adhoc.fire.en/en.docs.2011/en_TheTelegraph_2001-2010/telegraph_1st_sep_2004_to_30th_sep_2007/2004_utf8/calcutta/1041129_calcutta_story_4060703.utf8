 Mystery body in Sarobar at dawn

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Morning-walkers at Rabindra Sarobar were in for a shock on Sunday, when they came across the floating body of a woman near Calcutta Rowing Club.

 Asit Banerjee, officer-in-charge of Lake police station, said a walker informed his men about the body, which was fished out around 8.30 am.

 ?We have not yet established the identity of the woman, who was in her mid-fifties. She was in a sari and blouse and had on a few ornaments,? Banerjee added. ?It is difficult to ascertain the cause of her death ? whether it was suicide, murder or accident ? till we receive a copy of the post-mortem report,? he added.

 The sleuths are faced with a difficult task, as there is neither any clue to the woman?s identity nor any indication as to how the end came.

 An officer on the case said the body bore no identification marks. ?We cannot even say whether she was Bengali or Hindi-speaking. All we have to go by are her ornaments ? one gold bala and a pair of gold earrings,? he explained. 

 The administration said all police stations across the city have been alerted and asked to provide clues, if any, to the investigating team. 

 ?We are not even sure whether a missing person report regarding this woman has been filed with any police station in the recent past,? said the officer.

 With no evidence in hand to buttress any theory, the sleuths are working on both options ? that the woman had come to the lake on her own or that she had been brought there from somewhere in the city or from the districts (in which case the mystery will be more difficult to solve).

 If the woman had committed suicide, the police thinking goes, she must have jumped into the water before the morning-walkers started arriving, or else she would have been spotted.

 Which means the woman jumped to death before or around 4.30 am, by which time, as a Calcutta Rowing Club functionary said, the first batch of walkers turn up.

 But as the body was discovered a good four hours later, it is possible that someone else had dumped it and fled without being noticed.

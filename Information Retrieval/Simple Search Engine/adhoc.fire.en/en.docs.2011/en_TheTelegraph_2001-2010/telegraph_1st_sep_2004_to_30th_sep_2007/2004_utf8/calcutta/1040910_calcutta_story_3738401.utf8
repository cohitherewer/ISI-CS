 Batons at bail court

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The police on Thursday fought a pitched battle with Trinamul Congress workers outside Barasat court, where they had gathered to protest ?the CPM?s attempts to shield Avtar Singh? and demand rejection of his bail petition.

 Avtar was produced in court later in the day and his bail plea rejected.

 Police lathicharged the mob twice ? first to disperse the Trinamul protestors and subsequently to separate warring groups of Trinamul and CPM activists. Supporters of the ruling party were raising slogans against ?police excesses? and the role of the media in connection with the case.

 Work at Barasat court was hampered on Thursday as a 200-strong police contingent, including the RAF, prevented lawyers and witnesses from entering the compound while Avtar?s bail plea was being heard for the third time. 

 The North 24-Parganas district bar council later issued a statement denouncing the police action. ?Police did not allow our members and witnesses to reach the respective judges. A particular political party is creating problems for us, along with police. This is a clear interference with the work of the judiciary,? said Ananta Roy, general secretary of the proLeft district bar council. 

 The council also submitted a memorandum to sub-divisional judicial magistrate Dibyendu Sinha, pointing to ?police high-handedness?.

 Barasat sub-divisional officer Swarup Pal defended the police action, saying they were trying to enforce prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC to prevent ?breach of peace?.

 The prohibitory orders, however, did not prevent DYFI (the CPM?s youth wing) workers from bringing out a procession near the court. The processionists went round the compound, shouting slogans.

 North 24-Parganas district magistrate Manoj Panth explained that the prohibitory orders were ?invoked only to prevent a possible disruption of peace in the area?. 

 Superintendent of police Parveen Kumar conceded that no order had been issued to obstruct the entry of mediapersons. ?The policemen had been asked to ensure that there was no disruption of law and order. They were not there to interfere with the work of lawyers and journalists.?

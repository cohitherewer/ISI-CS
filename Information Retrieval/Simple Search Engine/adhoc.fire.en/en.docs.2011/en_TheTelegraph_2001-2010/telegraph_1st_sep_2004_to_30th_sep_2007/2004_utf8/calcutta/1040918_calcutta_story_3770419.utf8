The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Shabana Azmi You perform best under pressure 

You have tremendous will-power, resistance and courage. Heed advice. Start paying 

attention to details. Self-admiration could cause conflict later. A new love interest 

may appear on the horizon. ? Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 In several areas in Calcutta and its suburbs country liquor is distilled and 

sold along railway tracks, from abandoned old houses and in slum areas. Unemployed 

youth take to the addiction, expecting that it will help them forget their frustrations. 

Most of these illicit liquor joints are also a haven for gamblers and satta 

operators. Surely, drowning themselves further in this habit wouldn?t make 

life any easier for the tipplers. Why don?t the authorities conduct frequent raids 

at these illegal theks? Doctor, health workers, teachers, political leaders 

and elders in the locality must take stern action against those running these 

joints.

 A long queue is omnipresent in front of the reservation counters at most of 

the railway stations in Calcutta. For elderly people, standing in these queues 

and waiting for their turn is physically very demanding. By the time they manage 

to buy the ticket they are exhausted. However, since it is not feasible to open 

a separate counter for the senior citizens, the railway authorities should think 

of some arrangement to help these elderly people avoid the strain. For example, 

there can be a separate queue for elderly citizens parallel to the general one 

and after every four from the general queue one from the senior citizens? queue 

may be allowed to buy the ticket. This will give the aged people much relief and 

also not inconvenience others. The number of aged people who arrange for their 

travel themselves is steadily increasing. Hence, it is time the railways considered 

some way to help them at the booking counters.

 On September 25, I happened to watch eight plays at Presidency College organised 

by The British Council and the college. Though the themes of all plays were well-chosen 

but to some extent all the hard work went in vain as the acoustics at Derozio 

Hall was not up to the mark. The audience failed to catch the dialogue most of 

the time. Hope the college authorities take corrective measures and improve the 

audio system in the hall.

 The unlawful parking of taxis at the crossing of Central Avenue and Grey Street 

is a nuisance. The taxis are parked at the bus stop itself and schoolchildren 

and aged persons have a tough time boarding a bus, particularly during office 

hours. Every day, the situation at the site is chaotic. Passengers are left with 

no option but to wait for buses on the carriageway itself, in front of rows of 

taxis. The traffic authorities should take action against the taxi drivers putting 

the lives of passengers at risk.

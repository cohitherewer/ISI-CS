 Neighbours back murder accused, condemn ransack

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Residents of Selimpur, in Kasba, including 100 women, have expressed solidarity with Sipra Das, who was arrested and imprisoned in the wake of vandalism by some slum-dwellers following the unnatural death of her domestic help Bhagabati Haldar. 

 The residents have also protested the rowdiness of the slum-dwellers, who had ransacked the Das household and assaulted Sipra and her daughter Shreyoshi and a neighbour, Soumen Sarkar, who came to their rescue. 

 We have prepared a memorandum and will hand it over to South 24 Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta. In the letter, we have condemned the incident and have asked the authorities to take necessary steps, said S.K. Ghosh Roy on Monday. 

 Bhagabati, 12, was found hanging from the balcony grille of the Das residence on September 1. Sipra, a former schoolteacher, and daughter Shreyoshi noticed the body in the afternoon and raised an alarm. Soon afterwards, the mother and daughter and Sarkar, who tried to protect them, were beaten up severely by nearly a thousand residents of Netaji bustee, where the maid used to live. All the three were admitted to hospital. 

 According to some police officers, the unexpected rowdiness of slum-dwellers may be alarming and could affect peace in the city. We are trying to find out whether this was politically motivated or not, as this is an unusual occurrence. We plan to meet residents of different areas to figure out if existing differences between the two sections of society can reach a flashpoint, they said.

 On that day, Bhagabatis maternal uncle, Tapan Sardar, and his wife Aloka lodged an FIR with the local police, alleging that her employer had murdered the girl. Sipra was arrested after she was released from hospital on Wednesday. 

 According to deputy superintendent of police Soma Das, the police have not received the post-mortem report yet and nothing could be said at the moment. Though preliminary investigations suggested that it was a case of suicide, we are yet to ascertain it. So far, we have arrested nine persons. Apart from Sipra, we have picked up eight others on charges of ransacking the Das household, Soma Das said.

 We have taken adequate measures to maintain peace in the neighbourhood. Police have been deployed round-the-clock in front of the Das household and the house has been sealed. Forensic experts have been called in to inspect the place of occurrence, Das added. 

 Sipra will be produced in Alipore court on Tuesday. She was at Presidency jail after judge Manjit Singh remanded her in judicial custody. She has filed a bail petition and it will be heard on Tuesday, Das explained.

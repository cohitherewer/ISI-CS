 Celebrating the dramatic arts

 In commemoration of the golden anniversary of the performance of Tagore?s Rakta Karabi, Nandikar celebrates its 21st National Theatre Festival featuring an assortment of popular plays by theatre troupes from all over India. To be inaugurated this evening, the festival will continue till December 25. Tongue-Tied, one of the plays to be staged after the inaugural ceremony, is a bilingual production in Swedish and English. Presented by Teater Pero of Sweden, the only foreign participant in this festival, it is a philosophic reflection on life and friendship. Directed by Peter Engkvist, it is a dramatically powerful performance, which works on multiple levels to generate an imaginary, dream-like atmosphere where music and body language play a more important part than the spoken language. Mahamayi (a scene from the play appears above), the evening?s other performance, is an ironic but sensitive tale inspired by myth and folk literature, dealing with the issues surrounding freedom and death. Written by the celebrated Kannada playwright Chandrasekhar Kambar, it depicts the clash of pure, immaculate love with the dark power of death. Produced by Aaj of Udaipur and directed by Bhanu Bharti.

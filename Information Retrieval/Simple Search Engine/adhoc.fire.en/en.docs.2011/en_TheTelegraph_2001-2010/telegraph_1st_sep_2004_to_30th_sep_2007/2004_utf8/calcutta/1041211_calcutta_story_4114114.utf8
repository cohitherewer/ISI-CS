 Schools look to toe Loreto line

 OUR SPECIAL CORESPONDENT

 Loreto House has bolted, but the stable door is anything but locked.

 The state Higher Secondary (HS) council has lost a prominent member, with Loreto House converting its affiliation to the Delhi-based Council for the Indian School Certificate (ISC) Examinations.

 More defections may be in store for the HS council and West Bengal Board of Secondary Education ? which conducts Madhyamik ? as more private English-medium schools under the two state boards are expected to follow the Loreto House line.

 One of the most significant national-level education meets opens here next month, when the heads of Anglo-Indian schools from different parts of the country will discuss in detail ways of restructuring their existing system of education, in keeping with the new millennium?s requirements. 

 Sources said the discussions will focus on how to bring more private English-medium schools, particularly those in Calcutta, under the Anglo-Indian education system. 

 Most Anglo-Indian schools are affiliated to the Delhi board that offers the Indian Council for Secondary Education (ICSE) examination at Class X level and the ISC examination at Class XII level. 

 ?A concrete policy on how to cover more schools, particularly the upcoming ones, is expected to emerge at the meeting,? an official said. 

 ?Anglo-Indian schools have always been sought-after educational institutions, not only for Calcutta?s parents and students but also for all parts of the country for decades,? said J.K. Sen, general secretary of the Calcutta branch of the association and principal, Julien Day Ganganagar.

 ?What we are going to discuss in the coming meet, scheduled to be held from January 5 to 8, is the role of Anglo-Indian schools in the modern scenario, when more and more guardians want their wards to be educated in these institutions,? he added.

 Loreto House, the new entrant to the ISC system, will be the venue for the meet. Heads of nearly 263 Anglo-Indian schools, 67 from Calcutta, are expected to participate.

 ?The schools want to convert to the ICSE and ISC system because there is a demand among students for studying these courses,? explained Gillian Rosemary Hart, principal, Welland Gouldsmith School.

 She is also a member of the ISC board and MLA from the state representing the Anglo-Indian community. 

 ?The growing popularity of the courses has increased the responsibility of the Anglo-Indian schools and also of the Delhi board. The heads? meet will help frame a clear policy on the functioning of the schools according to the requirements of modern students,? added Hart, who will present a paper on the future role of Anglo-Indian schools.

 Head of the ISC board Francis Fanthome is expected to discuss in detail the council?s new policies.

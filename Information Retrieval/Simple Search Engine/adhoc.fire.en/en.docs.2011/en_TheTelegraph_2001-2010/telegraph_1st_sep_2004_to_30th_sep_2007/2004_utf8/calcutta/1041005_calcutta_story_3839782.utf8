Old flame, new spark

Australian singer-songwriter Darren Hayes 

belts out passages from then and now

Old flame, new spark

You fell Truly Madly Deeply in love with this 

Australian singer-songwriter as the cute frontman of Savage Garden, who went on 

to reinvent himself with a solo album titled Spin in 2003. His dalliance 

with the sound waves continued and now he?s made another splash with his new album 

The Tension and the Spark, which has seen the international superstar 

setting off in a totally new sonic direction.

Here, Darren Hayes replies to a host of questions 

fired by Sangita S. Guha Roy over email.

 From Savage Garden to second solo album, how has 

the journey been?

It?s been four years since the last Savage Garden 

concert in South Africa in 2000. I wouldn?t want to re-live those years again! 

It was a lot of hard work, pressure and expectation that I felt going from a successful 

band to a solo career. 

In some ways I think I was on automatic pilot for 

my first solo album. I knew there was a lot to prove so I just worked hard and 

didn?t look down! Looking back, it was a very stressful time for me in my life. 

 To take you back in time for a bit, what were 

you aiming for musically with your work in Savage Garden?

It was crazy. I was a boy from Brisbane, Australia, 

poor as poor could be and never even left my own city. All of a sudden, 20 million 

record sales, number one in America, people screaming out for you. It?s an incredible 

high and very surreal experience. When I was with Savage Garden, the number of 

CDs sold, how famous I was and whether I would make it to the top, The Tension 

and the Spark speaks about all that. 

I became a popstar because I wanted the whole world 

to love me, but I?ve realised that self love will fill any void or need.

 Your new effort, The Tension and the Spark, 

follows the hugely successful Spin. Did having such a strong debut create 

pressure?

Truth is, I just didn?t want to make a record. I finished 

touring, with Japan being the last show, and I was bored. I was done with music 

and I became very cynical about the industry and Top 40 radio. I didn?t even want 

to look at music for a while, and did a course in screen-writing. 

I was living in San Francisco so I got back to yoga, 

bought myself a mountain bike and a puppy, and started living my life. And incidentally, 

I started making a record without realising it. 

 It would be really difficult to cross the benchmarks 

set by Spin, especially in terms of vocals. Did you have to take a fresh 

look at your style because of this?

No. I think I have just evolved and grown, as anyone 

should. Once again, what would be the point in doing exactly what I?ve done before? 

I think this record just shows growth.

 Who are some of the artistes who have influenced 

your work in the new album?

I have a true love of the music these people had been 

associated with ? Bjork, Madonna, Massive Attack ? to name a few. So I really 

wanted to explore the influence they could bring to my songwriting and performing. 

And of course, I loved working with the producers 

of this album ? Mark Stent, Marius De Veries and Robert Conley.

 Has your approach to songwriting changed since 

the Savage Garden days? Do you co-write with a lot of others? 

It was a lot more freeing. In the past, I tried not 

to offend anyone with my music, but this time around, I don?t mind so much if 

someone doesn?t like the songs. When I recorded Unlovable, I had a lump 

in my throat. It was moving, but I wasn?t sure if people wanted me to write those 

type of songs.

 Relationships and changing emotional landscapes 

were at the core of your writing in Spin. Does The Tension and the Spark 

further expand on these themes?

When I say that this album is autobiographical, I 

cannot stress on this enough. It?s almost uncomfortably personal at times. I definitely 

wanted to reinvent myself, in as many ways as possible. 

I think I had lost my passion for music and I wanted 

to be inspired and reinvigorated by working with people who would challenge me. 

I pushed myself very hard and didn?t allow myself to feel ?safe?. The fact that 

the record is electronic is almost incidental to me. I think it?s a record that 

is deeply personal and sparse ? and electronic second.

 Insatiable was the obvious single from 

Spin. Any song in the new album that you think will make that kind of impact?

Popular... it?s my favourite track in the album. 

 Is The Tension and the Spark your take 

on the creative process?

The record is about my childhood and my psyche. Why 

now? Because I can?t lie anymore. There?s been a hefty element of honesty in my 

music, but with this, it was overwhelming. All these feelings and thoughts I tried 

to hide away manifested themselves as songs. 

 What do you think the future of popular music 

is going to be like? 

Music is growing everyday. The styles keep changing... 

and this is a good thing.

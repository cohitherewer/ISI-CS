IPSITA DEB

Artist Emcy shows off some popular male 

motifs for body painting at Mapuii salon

Body painting may not prove machismo like a real tattoo, 

but it has gained sexy status ever since Demi Moore graced the cover of Vanity 

Fair in 1992 dressed in naught but paint. But what if you are a man?

Though men may feel that a true-blue tattoo is the 

only manly way to decorate themselves, the effects are rather permanent, not to 

mention painful and difficult to remove.

Body painting is the temporary substitute. Many designs 

tend to be specific to a certain festival, or are used to mark a particular occasion. 

With the season of fun ? Christmas and New Year ? just round the corner, here 

are some of the more popular kinds of artwork that can be executed with precision 

for men. Artist Emcy at Mapuii salon on Chakraberia Road demonstrates.

Chest symmetry

Tribal designs rule the roost here. Symmetrical and 

asymmetrical designs, denoting something ancient, are popular in the chest zone. 

The designs can be original or chosen from a book of ancient patterns. 

?Young people surprisingly have an affinity for such 

old designs, but they wear them in an untraditional manner,? says manager Darshini 

Sanghvi. 

Arm symbols

Chinese letters and symbols ? particularly dragons 

? are very in right now on the arms as are sketches of women, on the forearm. 

Spider?s webs work well on the upper arm . Symbols of water and fire hold significance. 

Being temporary, these are usually co-ordinated with the outfit of the evening.

Bright orange and yellow flames are also prominent 

in this area. Colourful Native American faces and ciphers are also popular. (The 

model in the is sporting a rather ominous snake-like creature).

Wild necks

The the neck zone is an extremely popular hotspot 

for animal motifs. The deadly scorpion, poisonous snake or ferocious tiger provides 

that dash of machismo. For the nape of the neck, unusual patterns like asymmetrical 

designs, a bull?s head, dragon or most commonly, a unicorn, are popular choices.

Back basics 

This is the widest canvas on a human body and the-bigger-the-better 

mantra holds true here. A dragon is the reigning craze, as are tigers and monsters 

(a combination of a ferocious dragon with flames as sported by the model in the 

picture), though Chinese letters are popularly chosen here, too. 

Many party people even opt for religious symbols like 

the cross, or Hindu motifs from mythology. ?On the back region, anything goes. 

Once a guy got himself a nice brassiere painted on!? smiles Darshini. 

Leg labels 

?The thighs are usually painted in summer, when there 

is some scope to show them off in public,? informs Darshini. Coloured wings with 

the emblem of a conjoined sun and moon is a popular piece of artwork on this canvas. 

Symbols of life and death and the bull are common, too. On the ankle, however, 

due to space restriction, small, simple, asymmetrical designs are brushed on.

Tot tops

?The little ones, however, prefer to go the way of 

their favourite superheroes and cartoon characters with Popeye, Spiderman, Scooby 

Do and Superman. For birthday parties and functions they get these designs in 

paint applied and show them off to their friends,? says Darshini.

The prices start at Rs 150 and can go up to Rs 450, 

depending on size, colour, intricacy of design and glitter.

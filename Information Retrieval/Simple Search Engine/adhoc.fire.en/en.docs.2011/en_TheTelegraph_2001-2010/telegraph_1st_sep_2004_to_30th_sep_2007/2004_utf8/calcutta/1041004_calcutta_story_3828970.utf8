 Gender, violence amp; impact

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 More girls than boys are open to discussing 

homosexuality 

 Almost every young adult thinks 

the death penalty should be used merely as a backup till a law on life imprisonment 

ending in natural death is brought about 

 These and much more insights evolved at the end of a two-day interactive workshop on ?Gender (including gender-based violence) and Human Rights?, organised recently by Thoughtshop Foundation as part of its youth initiatives, in collaboration with Amnesty International. 

 From the very first session, the programme at Jadavpur University struck the right chord of spreading rights awareness among the 20-odd youngsters from Bhawanipur College, Jadavpur University, Jogesh Chandra Law College and St Xavier?s. While the first day had two Thoughtshop volunteers organising games, debates and discussions on gender and violence against women, the rest of the weekend saw screening of documentaries, presentations and heated arguments on case studies conducted by Amnesty representatives.

 For Srirupa Sengupta, M. Phil student of women?s studies and a regular Thoughtshop workshop participant, the sessions were thought-provoking. ?Earlier workshops did not give us a chance to look really closely at the matter of gender-based violence or discuss our own concepts of gender. It brought out quite a few starling revelations.?

 Sohini Bhattacharya, third-year student of English literature, was as bowled over as Srirupa. ?I want to take up social work after college and I think this workshop helped a lot in my orientation,? she said. ?I was surprised to find that there were people my age who actually thought homosexuality is a disease that can be cured by counselling.?

 Himalini Varma, project coordinator, Thoughtshop Foundation, told Metro: ?The aim of the workshop was to churn out active human rights defenders, to protest rights violations as individuals and as groups.? 

 The feedback, she added, was ?overwhelming?.

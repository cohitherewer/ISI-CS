 Talk tips for marriage blues 

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 Nikhil and Usha (names changed) have had an apparently happy married life for 27 years. Their children are settled, but Usha has been suffering in silence for long because of her husband?s chronic infidelity. A corporate honcho, Nikhil would always use the power of his position to woo women in his office and he would invariably tell his wife about them all.

 While holidays together, all kinds of professional help and Buddhist therapy lessons have failed, a recent first-of-its-kind workshop gave the couple a glimmer of hope.

 As it did for many others who had gathered at Saturday Club recently to attend a workshop on Why Marriages Fail, organised by doctors Govind Gupta and Paromita Mitra Bhowmick.

 ?Even if marriages don?t break up, there are thousands of couples in Calcutta, young and old, between whom communication has stopped and their marriage is on the verge of collapse,? said Gupta. 

 ?But in most cases, couples need only to talk it out and solve their problems. We stressed this importance of communication at the workshop,? he added.

 There were talks on the physical and psychological aspects of marriage along with group activities such as games and painting sessions. 

 Such workshops, probing reasons behind marriage failures, are very popular abroad, but Calcutta has never seen such an event. ?We realised that maybe because of the city?s social structure, it is difficult for people to come out in the open. But for starters, we advertised about our workshop through Rotary Club and among our own patients at the clinic. The response was rather good,? said Gupta.

 Many had called showing interest, but finally about 25 people turned up on D-Day. Participants included long-married couples, those waiting to tie the knot soon and divorcees, along with medical students, psychiatrists and doctors.

 One of them was Anita (name changed). Having walked out of an abusive marriage earlier this year, she said she was particularly helped by the workshop, because she could now learn from her mistakes in her first marriage and start to believe in having a ?better and more fruitful relationship in future?. She confessed to her counsellor that the workshop had helped her overcome fears and inhibitions about blaming herself for all that went wrong.

 Her counsellor, as well as Nikhil and Usha?s, Dr Kumar of Prem-E-Asha, said: ?All of them got back to me later and told me how they had enjoyed the workshop.?

 Trina (name changed) was no exception. She has had no communication with her husband for months. ?The fact that she actually took a step ahead and attended the workshop shows she is eager to salvage the relationship. That is a good beginning,? explained Kumar.

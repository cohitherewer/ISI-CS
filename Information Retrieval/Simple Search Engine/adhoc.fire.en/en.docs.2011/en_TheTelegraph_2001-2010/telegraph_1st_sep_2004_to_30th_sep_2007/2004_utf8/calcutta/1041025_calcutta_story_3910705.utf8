 Embrace technology, or be left out. Realising the potential of electronic commerce, the artisans and idol-makers in Kumartuli have decided to tap the worldwide web to reach out to the Bengali diaspora in North America and Europe. 

 By the plan, the apex body of artisans in Kumartuli ? the seat of the idol-making art in north Calcutta ? will host a website to sell idols to overseas clients. 

 ?This will reduce our dependence on middlemen, who take away the cream, as they have all the information regarding the buyers. Since we can?t contact them directly, we don?t get a fair price for our idols,? said artisan Mintu Pal. 

 Though the association wanted to go on-line during the Pujas 2004, the website could not be developed. At its next meeting, scheduled after Kali puja, the decision will be approved by the members.

 According to treasurer Biswajit Dey, some groundwork has already been done, with some members gathering information on the business potential of such an endeavour. The information collated suggests that around 70 Bengali associations in North America and Europe organise pujas and of them, 40 have a presence on the Net. 

 ?If we can establish contact with them, the chances of higher realisation for our work will go up and that, surely, will improve our condition,? said Pal, adding that around 35 idols travelled overseas this year. 

 Estimates suggest that the idols fetch anything between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 3 lakh, depending on size and other specifications. But the Kumartuli artisans complain that they don?t get more than one-third of the actual sale price. 

 So, the association is all set to take the leap forward and instal a computer, create its website and get dial-up connectivity at its office. Though the finances are yet to be worked out, the artisans are willing to share the cost, in anticipation of the benefits that will stream in once the system is in place and running. 

 ?Creating a website is only half the job. We are aware that we need to sort out a host of other issues before we embark on a direct relationship with overseas customers. We are working on those fronts as well,? summed up Pal.

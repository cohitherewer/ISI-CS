The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dandiya spills over into colourful disco drill

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY 

Revellers at popular discos in the city, boogeying 

the Puja nights away

Don?t be surprised if you encounter fresh faces when you go partying at your favourite hangout this weekend. A whole new bunch dared disc-hopping this Puja, changing the city nightscape, if only for a while. But with festive feel in the October air, many of the first-timers could soon be back for more. Here?s checking out the different beat the greenhorns grooved to.

 Mashi-pishi mix

The curfew is bound to be relaxed when the entire 

family is suffering from Saturday night fever after dancing Saptami, Ashtami and 

Navami nights away. Mommy, daddy, aunty and uncle tagged along with Sunny and 

Tina to pack in some disco-dandiya once through with pandal-hopping. The 

kids complained, but not too loudly, for it?s not too often that papa pays your 

fun bills!

 Fleet feet

Regulars struggled to do their usual jig as the new 

kids (and their parents) on the dance floor tried to match the footwork, indulging 

in a lot of toe-stepping in the process. And the culprits got away scot-free considering 

you couldn?t even see your own self, waist down! Most of the nightspots registered 

500-plus footfall each day beginning Saptami and the fever carried on till Navami 

night. ?We got a rotating crowd of about 1,000 at Tantra on most of the Puja days,? 

claims Anirban Simlai, director, food and beverages, The Park. ?The crowd was 

a unique mix of Puja revellers, tourists and NRIs as well,? he adds.

 Entry barrier

If you are congratulating yourself for staying home 

thinking it was more mayhem than masti, lie low with the knowledge that 

bouncers were at their active best. Scores of stags were shut out as the screening 

at the entrance was made stricter than ever to make room for some ?neat and clean? 

fun for the family crowd.

 Choli charm

The dress code couldn?t have been more colourful as 

the late dandiya crowd trooped in for a little more fun in lehnga-choli 

or churidar-kurta. ?Usually Dublin does not allow guests with open footwear 

and all, unless in full traditional Indian wear. But for the Pujas, special concessions 

were made,? reveals DJ Harish. The denim-clad crowd found little consolation in 

the pandal-hoppers bringing up a glitzy rear in brand new Bomkais and Benarasis.

Bolly beats

The mood was retro and the melody desi at most 

places. Indi-pop and Bollywood ruled with most of the international stuff reserved 

for the wee hours. ?We gave club music a break and played a lot of known numbers,? 

says DJ Girish of Shisha. While the Dhooms and Mujhse Shaadi Karoges 

proved the Puja rage, ancient stuff like Macarena and Mysterious Girl 

went down well too. ?I got requests to play stuff I had stopped playing two 

years ago,? says DJ Saranjit of Incognito who struggled to keep up with the Kanta 

Lagaas and Mohabbat Hai Mirchis.

 Aschhe bochhor?

Obviously, abar hobe, going by the industry 

figures. Most of the night haunts registered a phenomenal spurt in sales vaulting 

the 50 per cent mark. Ringing cash registers sent an industry insider?s imagination 

on an overdrive. ?Durga puja in Calcutta could be likened to Oktoberfest in Germany 

in a few years from now,? he piped. Looks like we?ve already got started, what 

with the no-dry-day bonanza and families out to have more than just Puja parikrama 

fun all night long!

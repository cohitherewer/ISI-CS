 Sparkle amp; smile

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

Her 

90-minute delay in arriving at the sixth anniversary celebrations of Diwansons 

Jewellers on Park Street was just beginning to make the guests feel jittery when 

actress Indrani Halder walked in flashing her trademark smile and setting all 

complaints to rest. 

 ?Jewellery is my passion. That?s why when they invited me to be part of the celebration, I could not say no,? she said, the three diamond rings on her fingers adding to the sparkle of her smile. 

 ?I like the ambience of the shop and its collection of ethnic jewellery,? Indrani observed. In fact, much before she started posing for the lensmen, she was inquiring about the prices of some exquisite pieces of jewellery. ?I will certainly borrow these pieces for film shoots,? she grinned. 

Though, Diwansons is synonymous with kundan 

and jadao sets, some trendy diamond and gold jewellery sets were showcased 

as well. 

 ?We are into the league of heavy sets that are basically investments for families,? said Vijay Diwan.

 While the prices of the very heavy stone-embellished sets may go up to a few lakh, it does not deter people from buying these well-crafted pieces. 

 The celebrations will continue till November 1 and customers will be entitled to free gifts and privileges during this period. 

 ?Customers can play games on purchase of jewellery above a certain amount of money and win gold and diamond sets,? said Bimal Diwan.

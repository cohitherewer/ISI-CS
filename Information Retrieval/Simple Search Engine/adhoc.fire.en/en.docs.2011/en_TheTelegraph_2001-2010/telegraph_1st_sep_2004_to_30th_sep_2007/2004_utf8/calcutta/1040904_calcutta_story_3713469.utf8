 Ever wondered what it feels like to track the paths of hundreds of aircraft, knowing that a single mistake could bring not just one plane crashing down, but probably more? Or having the lives of thousands in your hands, while you fly high, literally? 

 Wonder no more, for you could get the answers to these questions, and more, at the first aviation exhibition in Calcutta.

 On at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM), Aviation in India is unique in that no less than 10 professional organisations and academic institutions have pooled their resources to give the city a rare glimpse into the past and present of the industry. 

 Organised by the Aeronautical Society of India (ASI), Calcutta branch, and BITM, the exhibition began on Friday and is on till September 5.

 The participants are Airports Authority of India (AAI), IIT-Kharagpur, Indian Air Force, Indian Airlines (IA), Indian Coast Guard, Indian Institute of Aeronautical Science (IIAS), Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Jet Airways and NCC No 1 Bengal Air Squadron. 

 Each one has several exhibits on display. AAI has a live-model of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport and a scaled-down version, as well as a radar computer mimicking the tracking of flights. There are black boxes (which are really red), courtesy IA, engine models by IIAS and Jet and posters by IIT-K. 

 Missiles, altimeter and G-suit are some air force items, and a real rubber lifeboat has been provided by the coast guard, which is a self-sufficient unit for survival, as well as a gun pod and survival kit to name a few. 

 A weather balloon by IMD, bronze models of rockets and satellites by ISRO and aircraft models by NCC are some other fascinating exhibits.

 The added advantage is that there are representatives from every organisation explaining the inner and outer workings and answering curious questions. 

 And, theres a live, remote-controlled helicopter take-off and landing demonstration in the garden by ASI, weather permitting.

 The exhibition is part of the ASI awareness campaign, following on the heels of a school quiz recently, says Manish Gupta, chairman, ASI. 

 Next, we have a series of audio-visual presentations planned in schools. But the response for the exhibition has been phenomenal. 

 Loreto Sealdah wanted to sent 1,000 students, but we cant accommodate that number, he adds. 

 Batches of youngsters trooped in all day, with teachers in tow. The expectations are for at least 3,000 by Sunday, and Gupta feels that it will be extended till Tuesday on public demand. The surprise element, however, was the overwhelming response from girls schools. In fact, I think we will start the contact campaign with them, he smiles.

 Our students dont really like exhibitions, so this time we kept it a surprise before we sent the girls, explains Rashi Narula, principal of Mahadevi Birla, which had sent a group of 300 Class IX and XI students. But they absolutely loved it. They were interested in how things work. They are very eager about the audio-visual presentations. We will definitely organise that.

 Director of BITM Jayanta Sthanapati feels that depending on the success of the exhibition, the museum might start a permanent aviation gallery. 

 We (National Council of Science Museums) have one in Bangalore and in Mumbai, but here, we have a few exhibits as part of the locomotive gallery. Maybe we will have one now he signs off.

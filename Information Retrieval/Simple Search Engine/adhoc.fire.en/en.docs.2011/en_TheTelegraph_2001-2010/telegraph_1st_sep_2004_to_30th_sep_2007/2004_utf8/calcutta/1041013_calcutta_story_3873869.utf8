 Salt Lake plea for road aid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Salt Lake civic body has approached the state government for funds for major road repairs after the Pujas.

 ?The proposal is being processed by the urban development department. We hope the funds will be released soon,? said an official of Bidhannagar Municipality.

 The chairmen-in-council met on Tuesday and decided that partial repairs will be taken up before the Pujas. ?The civic body will spend Rs 25-30 lakh for the patchwork,? said Ramesh Bar, a chairmen-in-council member. 

 Trinamul Congress councillor Sabyasachi Dutta alleged that the condition of the roads had started deteriorating since the inception of the civic body. ?All the money spent by the municipality for road repairs has gone to waste,? he said. ?Even the road in front of Poura Bhavan, the office of Bidhannagar Municipality, is unnavigable.?

 Officials said last week?s torrential rains had further worsened the situation.

 Of the township?s 250-km roads, the urban development department maintains Broadway (from FD block to the EM Bypass). Third Avenue (DD Block to Narkeldanga) and First Crossroad are maintained by the CMDA. 

 The civic council also decided to adopt a number of schemes to increase revenue collection. ?There are plans to tap unassessed areas like wards 14 and 22,? said an official. 

 The past six months, he said, had registered an increase of nearly Rs 60 lakh in tax collection. In the last fiscal, the municipality had earned Rs 6.16 crore from taxes. The target this year is Rs 9 crore.

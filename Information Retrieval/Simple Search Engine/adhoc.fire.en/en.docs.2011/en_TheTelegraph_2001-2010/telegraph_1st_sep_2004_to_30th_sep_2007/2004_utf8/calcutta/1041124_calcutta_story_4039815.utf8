 Calcutta not alone in litter law flout

 JAYANTA BASU

 Despite being first off the blocks to introduce door-to-door garbage collection, Calcutta is struggling to meet the Supreme Court norms on solid waste disposal.

 And the city is not alone in missing the apex court deadline, which passed a year ago. Every city and town figures on the list of defaulters.

 All of them ? with a few exceptions like Bangalore and Hyderabad ? are more or less in a similar situation, said a Supreme Court-appointed expert on waste management.

 ?The overall status regarding compliance of the court directive is still poor, with hardly any city building a proper landfill for the disposal of solid waste,? said P.U. Asnani, member of the court-appointed solid waste management committee. He was speaking at a workshop, organised by the United States?Asia Environmental Partnership, on Tuesday. 

 ?You may get some more time after the Centre?s intervention. But the apex court will gradually tighten the noose,? the expert warned representatives of civic bodies.

 The court directive covers the entire gamut of solid waste management, ranging from a ban on littering the streets to disposal of garbage in ?engineered landfills?. 

 Conceding the urgency of the issue, municipal affairs secretary Dipankar Mukherjee said: ?We have to act fast. We?ll decide on the action after examining all options.?

 While environment secretary Asim Barman emphasised on ?having a shared disposal system, instead of separate municipality-specific facilities?, state pollution control board chairman Sudip Banerjee sought ?a time-barred road map and public participation?. 

 The workshop also discussed some successful case studies, like North Dum Dum-New Barrackpore and Kanchrapara. The North Dum Dum-New Barrackpore project is seen as a model facility. 

 The estimated cost of the two-phase project, around Rs 11 crore, will be borne by the central and state pollution control boards and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.

 The Kanchrapara facility, on the other hand, has been set up at Rs 25 lakh and it covers 15 of the 19 wards.

 ?Each ward has its own waste management panel, which employs local needy people with the money (Rs 5 to Rs 20) collected from residents. The extremely poor don?t pay anything. The civic body has to only carry the waste to the dump site,? said Kanchrapara?s vice-chairman.

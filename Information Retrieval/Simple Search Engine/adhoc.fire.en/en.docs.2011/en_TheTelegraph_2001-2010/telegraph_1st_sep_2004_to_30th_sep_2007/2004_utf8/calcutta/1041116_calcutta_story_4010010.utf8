 Akshay and Amitabh: All in the family

Berry berry fishy

It?s not often that an actress with an Oscar plays 

a temptress, and goes topless, too. Fresh from being the Bond Girl in Die Another 

Day, where Halle Berry was a bikini babe with attitude, Swordfish seemed 

like a follow-up. And it was released well before Berry made her Academy Award-winning 

appearance in Monster?s Ball. 

 The action-packed Swordfish will be screened on HBO this month and the next. But before you flash that gleeful grin, the scissor-happy censors have cut that bit out. 

 Nevertheless, a hyper John Travolta as a maverick spy and Hugh ?Wolverine? Jackman as the cyber hacker in director Dominic Sena?s ? Gone In 60 seconds fame ? film are worth the nail-biting watch. The cast includes Don Cheadle (Traffic, Ocean?s Eleven, Ocean?s Twelve) and former British footballer-turned-actor Vinnie Jones, who made his debut as a gangster in Guy Ritchie?s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

 Ex- spy Gabriel Shear (Travolta) wants to steal over nine billion dollars of government money to finance a war on international terrorists. He hires hacker Stanley Jobson (Jackman) ? with some helpful persuasive tactics from the sexy Ginger Knowles (Berry) ? to break the complex code that hides the money.

 If Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Ltd had a tough time staying afloat, its new avatar AB Corp is also passing through rough weather. Having launched its first film Ranveer at a grand function in Mumbai some time back, the Raj Kumar Santoshi directorial project bringing together Bachchans senior and junior never took off. While the Big B maintained that the script was not up to the mark and that it would get made with a different cast, it was evident he wanted other projects to roll before Ranveer.

 So on Sunday, AB Corp launched its new film Family, to be directed by Santoshi. It does star Amitabh himself, but not his son, rather his Ek Rishta and Aankhen co-star Akshay Kumar. The film will also mark the debut of actor Aryeman and is being co-produced by Keshu Ramsay. 

 The theme of the mahurat was black-and-white, with Akshay representing the positive and Bachchan the dark force. While the female casting is yet to be finalised, Hema Malini and Sharmila Tagore are under consideration. Sharmila is, of course, very much a part of the other AB Corp project Viruddh, being directed by Mahesh Manjrekar.

 Family also brings back the Khakee team of scriptwriter Sridhar Raghavan and music director Ram Sampat.

 Within days of its launch, Star One has already been able to create a dent in the soap-watching market. And although most of the faces on the channel are new, they have found favour with the viewers. One of the new weekly serials to create a stir is the comedy Instant Khichdi.

 In its third episode this Tuesday at 9 pm, Babuji decides to throw Raju out of the house, as he had criticised his suit, which he had purchased for Rs 40,000. Then Hansa, too, disapproves of Babujis new suit and gets his goat. Babuji decides to sell off the house and build separate bungalows for everybody. Jayshree, Hansa and Mellisa are very happy. Jayshree decides that Babuji should continue staying in the bungalow and others will shift to new ones. What happens next? Watch Instant Khichdi, Tuesday, 9 pm.

 It?s time again for the Hero Honda BFJ Awards. After the Bachchan blitzkrieg last year, this year, too, promises to be another cracker of an event. The theme for this year?s awards, to be held at Salt Lake stadium on November 27, is the contribution of technology to cinema. ?After films like Koi? Mil Gaya and Lakshya last year, it?s time that we recognise the effect of technology on Indian movies,? said Gautam Jain, director of Real Reel Pvt Ltd, producers of the show.

 So the evening will kick off with a 3D animation presentation which will feature a space shuttle hovering above Victoria Memorial and ?attacking Tollywood?. And the comperes will appear in typical MiB style as Bengalis in black. 

 The stage is also set for a new stage with a German company working on a first-of-a-kind outdoor water screen. ?We have used indoor water screens for many events but the outdoor one for a live event will be the first time,? said Jain.

 Among the awardees this year, the spotlight will be on Gulzar who will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award. He will be given a special musical tribute by the duo of Srikanta Acharya and Pratik Choudhury singing together for the first time. The script for the show is being penned by popular telly actor Kharaj Mukherjee.

 There will be other big names from Bollywood who will grace the occasion, but the star attraction is a biggie from Hollywood, who is yet to be confirmed. Keep guessing and watching this space for more?

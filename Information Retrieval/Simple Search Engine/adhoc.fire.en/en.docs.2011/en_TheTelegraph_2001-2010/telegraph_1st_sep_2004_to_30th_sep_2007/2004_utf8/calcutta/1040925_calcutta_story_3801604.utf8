TUBE TALK - Sunny side up

 Ghayal: Revenge roar

 Ghayal

 The budding boxer?s dreams come crashing down when his personal life goes for a toss. Sunny leaves the ring to track down the goons who have kidnapped his brother. 

Catch it on Zee Cinema at 8.30 pm today

Why bother? Ghayal gave the much needed shot 

to Sunny Deol?s sagging career. In between kickboxing the bad guys, Bollywood?s 

He-Man also found time to prance around the trees with leading lady Meenakshi 

Sheshadri. 

Farz: Duty bound 

 Farz

 Sunny Deol plays a fearless cop whose only concern is to wipe out all evil from the face of the earth. Om Puri is his partner and quite the opposite. He opposes Sunny but his daughter is in love with the honest cop.

 Catch it on Star Plus at 8 pm on Sunday

 Why bother? This Raj Kanwar action flick stars the beauty (Preity Zinta) and the beefcake (Sunny, of course). In a typical Sunny saga, he does what he does best: shout as loud as he can and punch as hard as he can. If action isn?t your thing, catch KBC, Johnny Lever style.

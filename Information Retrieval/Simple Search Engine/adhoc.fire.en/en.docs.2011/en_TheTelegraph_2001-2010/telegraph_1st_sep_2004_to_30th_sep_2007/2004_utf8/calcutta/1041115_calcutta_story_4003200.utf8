 Amader Munnabhaike dekhbo?? From Byculla to Bally, Versova to Victoria, there is no stopping the fan following of the deadly Dutt. After the Saifs and Dias got the Parineeta party rocking, first in Siliguri and then by the Strand, it was time for Sanju Baba (there?s no escaping the ?Baba? bit, plastered on the door of the make-up van or a permanent fixture on the lips of all those surrounding him) to set off the Diwali crackers.

 Having arrived in the city on Friday night, Sanjay was slated to face the arclights for the first time on Saturday afternoon at the Rajbari in Bally on the banks of the Ganga. That was after Saif shot in the morning for a small but important sequence.

 ?In the novel, this particular episode comes in the opening pages when Shekhar (Saif) talks to his mother about meeting a prospective bride and how the discussion switches to Lalita (Vidya Balan),? explains one of the production assistants in director Pradeep Sarkar?s team.

 The shot, taken in the extended garden, is okayed after a couple of takes and Saif returns to the comforts of the AC make-up van.

 Knock, knock?

 ?Who?s that?? 

 ?Baba.?

 Sanjay and Saif are locked in a warm hug as the two meet for the first time on the sets of the Vinod Chopra production. Then, they beat a quick retreat into the van. 

 The camera and the props are shifted to the front half of the palatial white building, as two vintage cars are put in place.

 Sarkar looks relaxed as he discusses the exact placement of the camera for the particular shot. ?Working with Sanjay is really a dream come true. I had directed the Chhan chhan song in Munnabhai but didn?t really get to work with him. He has really matured so much. Sanjay is the only actor who can make you cry even in a song sequence. He is just too good.?

 Unlike the leading ladies of the film who spend hours inside the vanity van, Sanjay takes less than 15 minutes to slip into the green kurta, get into the gold and look more of his Vaastav self. Saif also makes a quick costume change ? from a white kurta to a pastel shade shirt.

 The shot is ready to be canned. Scene 60 ? Gurcharan (Achyut Poddar) is lying ill inside the building. The house doctor comes out after checking him. He is accompanied by Girish (Sanjay) who pays the doc his fees and discusses the situation. Shekhar walks in and gets inside the house to check on Gurcharan.

 Familiar face on Tolly telly, Tapas Chakraborty, plays the doctor and is expectedly excited about the shoot. ?Can you please click me with Sanjay?? he asks one of the lightmen.

 After a couple of rehearsals, the cameras roll. The first take goes wrong with Saif rushing in a touch too early. The second take is not even completed with Sanjay reacting to Saif?s cue and turning his head. The third take is ?NG (not good)? with Chakraborty?s frame blocking that of Sanjay.

 In a mini-break that follows, Sanjay lights a Marlboro, Saif his Camel and the two share a joke before they get back in front of the camera. ?Working with Saif is a whole lot of fun,? says Sanjay, with the two having shared the frame before in Nehle Pe Dehle.

 Saif wants to go for the Indo-Pak cricket match and has even got himself tickets. But football is his first love as he still nurses a sprained ankle that he helped himself to during the friendly IIFA soccer match in Singapore.

 Another take with a slight change in dialogue and character position follows and this time Sarkar is happy. The Sanjay shooting sojourn in Calcutta is off the mark and the Parineeta juggernaut rolls on despite problems like the missing truck, union strike and the mob mania?

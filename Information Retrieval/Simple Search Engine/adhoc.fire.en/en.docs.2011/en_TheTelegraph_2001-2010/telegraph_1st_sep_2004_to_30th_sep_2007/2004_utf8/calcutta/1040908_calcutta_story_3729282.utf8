The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clinic bid to hush up links

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The owner and the manager of a Bandel-based nursing home, which gynaecologist Susil Pal had visited on July 2, had tried to hoodwink the police, refusing to admit that the dead doctor would turn up there occasionally on call.

 As the CID probe indicates, on the day of the doctors murder, the owner of the nursing home sent an SOS to Pal to handle a complicated delivery case. The doctor earlier in charge was unfit to handle it. 

 When the CID had initially interrogated Kanak nursing home owner Surendra Kumar Agarwal and manager Mumtaz Ahmed, they had denied Pals links with the nursing home, even during emergencies. 

 Later, when it was proved beyond doubt that the two were trying to conceal facts, the CID arrested the duo at Bandel late on Monday.

 They were charged with murder (Section 302) and tampering with evidence (Section 201) under the Indian Penal Code. On Tuesday, when produced in court, both were remanded in police custody for seven days. 

 We will not comment, since the matter is sub judice. Besides, it is not right to speak, since that would affect investigations, said R.K. Mahanty, additional director-general of police (CID).

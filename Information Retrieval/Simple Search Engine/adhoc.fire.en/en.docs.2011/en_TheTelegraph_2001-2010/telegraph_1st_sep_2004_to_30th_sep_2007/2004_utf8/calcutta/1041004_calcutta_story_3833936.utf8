The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tail-pipe rap ahead

 OUR BUREAU

 Having failed to meet the October 1 deadline set by Calcutta High Court to get its new auto-emission checking system in order, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government is likely to draw flak on October 7, when the court convenes to review the progress made by the state transport department in curbing auto-emission levels. 

 The case was last heard on March 31, when then Chief Justice A.K. Mathur had directed that all vehicles plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area conform to the emission norms notified by the Centre.

 Transport department officials said that to conform to the new standards, the tail-pipe emission levels would have to be checked by multi-gas analyser machines. But the state government had failed to acquire these, and it would take a few more months to have them in place. 

 ?About 200 of these machines are required. The testing centres have been informed about the approved model and the orders placed,? transport secretary Sumantra Choudhury said. ?But it will take some time to get them.?

 On Thursday, the case will come up before a division bench comprising Justice Barin Ghosh and Justice A.K. Basu. 

 The verdict of March 31 was made on the basis of a public interest litigation filed by automobile expert S.M. Ghosh in 2000, alleging inaction on the government?s part to curb auto emission. 

 However, even after expiry of the deadline to instal new emission-testing machines, not a single unit has been set up in the city. 

 According to transport department officials, the court, while reviewing the progress of work in curbing auto emission, will certainly ask whether the new emission-testing machines have been installed and what other steps have been taken in this respect. 

 ?We could have installed the new machines earlier, had we got the approval of the Automotive Research Association of India in time. We received it only on September 23,?? explained Chowdhury.

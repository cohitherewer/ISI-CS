The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Myth amp; magic of Milano deconstructed

Five days in Milan brought with them unfamiliar sights 

and unusual sounds aplenty. The explosion of Bengal during Asia Week aside, the 

north Italian city was a hub of activity with fashion week, football and the usual 

business of life. Madhumita Bhattacharyya took the plunge into culture shock, 

awe and confusion?

All in the game

 Hundreds chanting in unison in front of the third largest church in the world. But it wasn?t a song of devotion, it was the war cry of the Celtics, who took over the Piazza del Duomo on September 28, the day before their match against AC Milan at the San Siro stadium. The men ? from teen to octogenarian ? sported the team?s green and white striped jersey, flocking the open-air caf?s that line the square.

 Having started early evening, drinking beer and bonding with brethren in the best of spirits, around dinnertime four hours later, the scene was a little less amiable, a little more aggressive. Above their din, the rightful live music act of the evening hung up its mike in dismay. The men did their best to provide some tunes, but mugs of ale, they were far less in tune than they had been when they started out. All was not safe for amused bystanders, as a small silver ball, with which a group of energetic oldies had started an impromptu match, was bobbing around, occasionally hitting some of the diners on the head!

 On our Maidan ? with such a potent mix ? things may have got out of hand far sooner. But here too, trouble was unavoidable. Cops were keeping watch on the mayhem, intervening when required to break up brawls. Soon, sirens started, and the rowdy revellers were forced to call it a night.

 In retrospect, it is a good thing they decided to celebrate in advance. The following day?s 1-3 defeat to AC Milan could not have left them in such good cheer.

Lassie over lasses

 The most noticeable thing about Milan during fashion week is the beautiful people, right? Wrong.

 The two-legged pretties (and there are many, for sure, but not nearly as many arresting men as you would expect in Al Pacino?s country) were unceremoniously upstaged by a species that hasn?t quite learned the trick of standing upright (yet).

 Leggy lasses had to admit defeat to the shorter (four) legged cousins of Lassie. The parade of gorgeous pooches doesn?t run riot on the streets; it is leashed and groomed and allowed entry to just about anywhere. It is common to see a spaniel being carried into a store, or a German Shepherd sitting patiently as master and mistress grab a cappuccino.

 The bigger ones might be muzzled, the smaller ones given a little more freedom. But you are not likely to hear a bark, or yelp, from these well-behaved canines in classy Milan.

Small is big

 From four paws to four wheels, yet another surprise greets you on the streets.

 The land of the power vehicle has turned minimalist. The streets are dominated not by Ferrari, but by the smallest production vehicle in the world. Called the Smart car, this little buggy boasts Mercedes pedigree, so is not to be taken lightly. The fuel-efficient car built for urban living is just eight feet long and seats two. It is so narrow you can spot smarty parked at a right angle to the curb between two parallel-parked cars!

 The Mini Cooper, BMW?s classier, more established, vehicle, can also be seen zipping by quite regularly, and it isn?t a whole lot bigger. Sometimes, common sense wins over muscle power even in style-obsessed Italy.

Kneel-down computer 

 While on the subject of machismo, it might be worth mentioning that when it comes to nurture, north Italy leaves something to be desired.

 That a three-star hotel should provide half-decent service is not a wholly unnatural expectation. But at one heritage destination at Corso Magenta, where the Indo-Italian Chamber had booked some of the Indian contingent into, smiles were emphatically replaced by smugness.

 There is one solitary computer in the lobby of this particular hotel. A request to use the Internet was obliged. But one rather vital accessory was missing. ?Can I have a chair, please?? was the humble request. ?No, it is a new machine and we don?t have a chair,? came the reply. A few minutes kneeling on the floor later, it was time to search for a cyber caf?.

 This, however, was not as easy as it may seem. There are a few ?Internet points?, as they are called, in Italy?s commercial capital. Be prepared to hunt for them without much assistance.

 When you find one, at long last, you will be thanking Steve Jobs for thinking up desktop icons, because everything is in Italian ( for instance, an absent-minded CTRL S ? the keyboard shortcut for save ? will underline everything). And don?t forget Bill Gates, as the familiarity of Windows can turn out to be quite a life saver.

Window whisper

 But let?s not look down on the unconnected. Calcutta satisfies itself with the Junctions at every corner, while Milan makes do with Prada, Armani, Gucci, MaxMara, Zara? High fashion here is taken for granted. Next to the architecture, which is truly stunning in its Renaissance grandeur, the most striking visual feature of the small city is the shop-window display. These people are not just retailers, they are masters of visual merchandising.

 Let alone the big labels, a hopelessly mass-market Levis has used white light and faceless mannequins with enviable elan. Even the smallest store, caf? or boutique, is an explosion of colour, aided by lighting that entices, woos and whispers into every window-shoppers? ear. If you aren?t exactly rolling in euros, grab hold of your wallet and beat a hasty retreat.

Wheel steal

 If you are looking for a quick getaway, you might want to jump into a cab. Can?t really hail one, so head for the nearest taxi rank or call one of the radio hotlines. During fashion week, the city is a hub of activity, and otherwise empty streets could be packed with commuters trying to get from one show to another. It?s bad for business, crib the drivers.

 But street etiquette is surprising (as is our lack of it). While desis more used to jaywalking wait patiently at zebra crossings, the drivers ? waiting for the pedestrians to get on with it ? were losing their cool.

 Taxis are less expensive than expected, and are worth the few extra euros. Drivers ? even the ones who don?t know English ? are the warmest people around town with a buona sera (good evening) and arrivederci (goodbye) for everyone. They drive their own vehicles, and here too, style is key. Like a Richard Gere look-alike (the hair did the trick), who drives a Merc, wears a black blazer, designer shades perched on his head. Bellissimo (beautiful)!

The real thing

 This is for all those holier-than-thou espresso drinkers. Ever since the coffee bar concept hit the country, the true sign of a java snob was a shot of bitter, virgin brew. We have one word for you all.

 Ha!

 The authoritative Italians (come on, they did invent the stuff) serve an espresso far more mild than the potent pop available around India?s ?Italian style? outlets. You are most likely to see the Italians dumping a diabetic amount of sugar into the decoction, which hardly lasts longer than the first sip.

 So don?t grit your teeth and gulp it down. Sweeten and savour.

Customs made

 Surface differences aside, Italians are remarkably like us Indians. So, clearing customs could only be an unfortunate affair to remember.

 Especially if you are travelling with a designer headed for the Milan ramp. Sabyasachi Mukherjee?s bulging suitcases were carrying precious cargo, all of it carefully inventoried and cleared in Delhi. But at Malpensa, the swank revamped international airport about an hour from the city, the bags had to be scrutinised once again. Officers went through them armed with a fine tooth comb and little logic. One lady picked up a shirt and examined it, puzzled. The designer?s list said it was ?a top?. Finally she voiced her concern. ?But in our country, tops don?t have sleeves.?

 That?s the first stop of style for you.

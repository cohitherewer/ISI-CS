 Tumour or ulcer in cell death

 OUR BUREAU

 A day after Sampad Mukherjee, prime accused in the Kuntal Sain murder case, died under ?mysterious circumstances? in Presidency jail, prison officials heaved a sigh of relief on Monday when they learnt that the death was either due to a tumour in the 21-year-old?s lungs or gastric ulcer.

 ?We were worried about the cause of death. Though we are yet to receive the post-mortem report, it?s a great relief to know that there has been no foul play,? said deputy inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya.

 He admitted that Sampad was in possession of several medicines in his cell, which he used to take for various ailments, including skin rashes. ?It seems Sampad had also taken an overdose of medicines,? Bhattacharya added.

 Jail sources said chief medical officer A.K.Roy has been asked to explain how Sampad could stock such a lot of medicines in his cell. According to the jail manual, no inmate can have with him more medicines than the daily dose. ?We are also probing if any warder supplied Sampad the medicines after stealing them from the jail hospital,? they said.

 Sampad?s lawyer Sujit Chatterjee has decided to move the Howrah district court, seeking bail for Sampad?s mother Manjusha and brother Jyotirmoy, so that they can take his body from the police morgue and perform the last rites. Sampad?s grandfather Biswanath Mukherjee has refused to receive the body.

 Seven twirls and a loud splash

 It started with a scowl and the drop of tear. And then six-year-old Dona Dutta just couldn?t stop wailing. ?Thakur keno choley jachchhey? O Maa Dugga, tumi jeona (Why is the goddess leaving? Please, Ma Durga, don?t go),? the child howled, brushing her tear-streaked face with her frock sleeve. 

 While her parents comforted Dona at Babughat, 20-odd men were already taking her thakur out to the river. A little later, Dona?s uncontrollable hiccups lost out to a huge splash, as her Maa Dugga hit the water.

 As idols trickled into Babughat, two days after Dashami, Calcutta showed once more that it doesn?t let go easily. The apparently teeming mass of policemen earlier in the evening got lost in a surging crowd, as the sun dipped lower in the west on Monday. 

 The stage had been set pretty for the last leg of bhashan 2004. Bamboo barricades and nylon ropes in place, metal detectors and assorted paraphernalia clearly visible, revolver-blazing and walkie-talkie-toting policemen looking totally in control, cop boats replete with divers ready to jump, lensmen adjusting their cameras? there couldn?t possibly be anything amiss for the immersion razzmatazz. Except the idols.

 It was disappointment at first for a khaki-clad cop, who scanned the parking lot for idol-bearing trucks. With not a single vehicle in sight, he had just remarked: ?Arre bhai, taratari thakur eney bhashan dao, bari jabo (Why don?t they get over with the immersion fast)!? 

 Divine intervention was already on the way. For soon, the idols arrived from a north Calcutta para, amid the cacophony of plastic and paper toys and balloons, dhaak and kanshor, interspersed with panic-stricken ?sambhal ke, sambhal ke? cries.

 A truckload of men, women and children descended on the sandy banks of the ghat. After vermillion and abir had done the rounds on their faces, the bhashan-jatris got merry, wielding pink cans spraying white powder on each other. ?Eta amader pujor reeti?(This is our tradition),? explained a parar dada, as he sprinkled scented talcum powder on an already aalta-smeared boudi.

By this time, contract labourers had swarmed to the truck and were handing out the idols. ?Maa er matha ta dekhey dada? ashurer khorgo ta kothaye gelo?hai hai shingher lej ta mariye dilen? (Mind the Mother?s head, where is asura?s scimitar? Did you just step on the lion?s tail?)? Advice poured in from every quarter for an honourable farewell to the goddess and her troupe.

 As the didima and mashima sniffled a wee bit, and touched their foreheads, idols were hoisted on to shoulders and taken round in the auspicious seven circles ? with a concessional three in case of Ganesh for being the heavyweight deity. The dhaakis went into a frenzy, the kanshor couldn?t have clanged louder and even the spectators watching from behind the barricades lent their voice to ?Dugga Maai ki joy?.

 Everybody wanted to touch the idol, pray to her one last time, before she went down for a year. And then abruptly, it was over, with much splashing of muddy water. Only a pair of fluorescent jackets glowed from the cop boat, where alert divers kept watch.

 And suddenly, it seemed the sun had done a disappearing act, Howrah had started twinkling on the other bank and the bridges had come to life in the night sky. While policemen stayed put for more idols to come their way, little Rakesh took a break from collecting idol frames from the water and prodded the photographer to click his picture. And on the way back home, amid shouts of ?ashchhey bochhor abar hobey?, every heart began to wait ?. And little Dona still wondered why the Pujas had to end and school had to reopen.

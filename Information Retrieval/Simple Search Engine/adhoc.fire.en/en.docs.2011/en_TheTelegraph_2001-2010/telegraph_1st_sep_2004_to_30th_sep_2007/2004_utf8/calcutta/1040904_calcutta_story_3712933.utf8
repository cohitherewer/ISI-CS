Political spice to online fun

Global Eye

 George W. Bush and John Kerry 

Some of them are pure fun, but others have a rather 

serious agenda. In the run up to the US elections in November, online games are 

taking a political turn, with George W. Bush and John Kerry at the centre of the 

action.

The fun ones are non-partisan. You can try out Bush 

vs Kerry Joust. Or Bush vs Kerry Boxing, which was inspired by a Time magazine 

article that used pugilistic lingo to describe the battle between the two presidential 

candidates.

Some games have tried to introduce a serious element 

into the virtual competition. The Political Machine is a complex strategy game 

where the players become campaign manager for a candidate not necessarily one 

of the real contenders. Tasks include designing a media campaign, choosing election 

issues, making speeches, creating ads, appearing on TV shows and dealing with 

gossip.

Others are plain ridiculous. Like the Bush and Britney 

Get Jiggy With It game, where the player can control Bushs and Spears actions 

on the dance floor. The Bush Shoot Out has Bush and Condoleeza Rice in the lead. 

Apparently, Arnold Schwarzenegger against Hillary Clinton is a popular match up.

The Republican Party has come out with games that 

extol the virtues of the Bush administration, like Tax Invaders, where he is presented 

as the only defence against high taxes.

Foot notes

Besides humming his songs, you can have John Lennon 

at your feet now. Soon, fans will be able to buy sneakers featuring the icon and 

modelled on the ones he is seen wearing on the cover of Abbey Road, The 

Beatles last studio album.

Yoko Ono, widow of the music legend, has signed a 

deal with Converse a Nike-owned brand to produce the footwear featuring a 

picture of Lennon and words from his classic song Imagine.

The sneakers would have the line Imagine all the 

people living life in peace written on the toe, a Lennon self-portrait on the 

side in place of the Nike logo and his autograph on the heel. Called the John 

Lennon Peace Chuck, the sneaker was part-designed by Ono. It is the first in a 

series of annual, artiste-designed Peace Chucks and a part of a range called 

the Chuck Taylor All Star Peace Collection.

Proceeds from sales will go to Empower Peace, a US-based 

charity founded to encourage better relations between students from nations in 

conflict.

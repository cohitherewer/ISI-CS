 Love amp; debt in suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Thirty seven-year-old Abhijit Ghosh, a stockbroker and agent of insurance policies, hanged himself from the ceiling fan of his bedroom in Banerjee Para, Thakurpukur, on Monday night. He lived in the house with wife Kabita and their 10-year-old daughter.

 After preliminary investigation, sleuths suspect Ghosh had fallen into a debt trap and was suffering from depression. They are verifying reports that he had an extra-marital affair, which had soured his relationship with his wife. 

 On August 30, an employee of the Eastern Railway Employees? Cooperative Society had committed suicide at his Behala residence after poisoning his wife and daughter. He, too, had fallen into a debt trap and had failed to repay the huge amount of money he had borrowed from his colleagues.

 Kabita said she saw nothing unusual in her husband?s behaviour when he retired after dinner on Monday. 

 Ghosh had a separate bedroom; an adjacent one was used by Kabita and their daughter. 

 ?Around 6.30 on Tuesday morning, I prepared tea for him and knocked on the door a few times. But there was no response. I panicked and called my neighbours, who broke open the door. Entering the room, we found him hanging from the fan,? Kabita recalled. 

 The neighbours called in the police, who brought down the body and sent it for post-mortem. Local residents said Ghosh had an affair with a neighbourhood girl who helped him in his work. The girl would frequent his house, causing turmoil in the family. 

 Kabita said she had repeatedly told her husband to ask the girl not to visit their house.

 Additional superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) Rajesh Subarno said Kabita would be interrogated after a few days. 

 ?We want to know how much money Ghosh had borrowed and whether he had an extra-marital affair,? he added.

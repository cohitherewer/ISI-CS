 ?It?s better to sit at home than do bad films?

 Punjab da puttar Bobby Deol returns after the disastrous Bardaasht with the Anil Sharma multi-starrer Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Sathiyo. On a promotion trip to town on Wednesday, the actor spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about his rights and wrongs.

 You are back with another patriotic film after 

Shaheed Bhagat Singh...

 It?s a patriotic film all right but it?s quite different from the likes of Bhagat Singh or even Gadar for that matter. It traces the Indo-Pak relationship from the 1971 war to today?s times. How things changed and why and how the relationship is improving every day.

 But it?s again about nationalism?

 No, it?s more about love. The love between the two nations. The love between a grandfather and a grandson. The love triangle between two men and a woman.

 There?s no Pakistan bashing in the film?

 Not really. It?s more like showing history as it happened. In fact, what is projected in the film is that the third parties have always tried to ruin the relationship between the neighbouring countries.

 You play a double role for the first time?

 That?s what everyone has been writing and talking about. That isn?t the case really. I play both father and son in the film. When one goes out of the scene, the other arrives. So, there are no two Bobbys in the same frame really.

 What is your character all about?

 I play this happy-go-lucky guy who wants to stay away from the army. He believes he can serve the country by doing good business. That leads to the conflict between him and his grandfather, played by Amitabh Bachchan.

 This is the first time you are appearing alongside 

the Big B?

 Yes. He has been like an uncle. I have been lucky enough to be on the sets of some of his films like Sholay and Ram Balram. So it is respect which comes first as an uncle and also as the best actor in the country. On the sets, he is really fun to work with, really chilled out.

 You are doing another Barsaat?

 Yes, isn?t that funny? My film career is now from one Barsaat to another. It?s being directed by Suneel Darshan and co-stars Priyanka Chopra and Bipasha Basu. It is about the growing trend of divorces in our country. It?s more of a social love story.

 You haven?t had a hit for a long time?

 I have always tried to be selective about my films but I must confess they haven?t been the best selections. I have done films for emotional reasons. I have done films because I had nothing else to do at home. But now I have become more mature and I have realised that it?s better to sit at home and not work than do bad films.

 Which other films are you looking forward to?

 I have Jurm, which is produced by my childhood friend Ashish Singh and directed by another friend, Vikram Bhatt. When we were all young, we made a video film and now our dreams are about to come true. Then there?s Mani Shankar?s Tango Charlie, which is about the memoirs of a BSF jawan. It highlights the fact that all soldiers from all countries have the same sense and sensibilities.

 What?s happening on the home production front?

 We are introducing my cousin brother Abhay Deol in Socha Na Tha, directed by Imtiaz Ali. It?s about confusion in love. Abhay is more like my own brother with all of us staying together. Despite the Deol tag, he?s not being projected as an action star because he comes across more as a loveable boy next door. We are also doing Deodhar Gandhi, an action film starring my elder brother Sunny.

 With Dharamji doing films again, when 

would we get to see all the Deols together?

 We are looking for a story idea that can have all three of us (Dharmendra, Sunny, Bobby) or even four, with Abhay. Let?s see if something can be churned out.

 Your locks have disappeared. Any plans of returning 

to your old look?

 Yes, I am growing my hair again. You know what, had I not been an actor I would have had a ponytail. Wouldn?t I have looked different?

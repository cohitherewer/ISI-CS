 Marriage mart for one-stop trousseau shop

 Marriages may ? or may not ? be made in heaven, but the run-up to D-Day is often a trip to hell and back as you go on a cross-country shopping spree.

 Holding out promise of the hop, skip and hunt being history is a four-floor marriage mart with ?all you need for the nuptial knot, under one roof?. Shagun Wedding Mall, the one-stop pre-marriage destination coming up at 10A Shakespeare Sarani this winter, ?will offer both comfort and an array of choices?, says promoter Jaydeep K. Khaitan.

 Being touted as the ?first in the country?, the marital mall would sprawl over 20,000 sq ft and four floors. Work is on and a December date would be set for the launch.

 As the lay of the dreamland goes, the ground and first floors would be brimful with sari, salwar suit, cosmetics, bindi and bangles. The second floor will house handbags, footwear, perfumes and designer jewellery. Blending ethnic with chic, the third floor will store western wear. The top floor will be dedicated to ?heavy items? ranging from diamond and gold to ghagra and sherwani.

 The bias towards the bride is a matter of practice, not prejudice. ?We have conceived the mall as a paradise for women, who do most of the shopping before marriage. In the entire building, out of 20,000 sq ft, we have kept just 600 sq ft of space for men?s wedding clothes,? says Khaitan.

 ?It?s nice to find everything under one roof and that will be a winning proposition. I would like to check it out myself as some of my younger brothers are likely to get married soon,? says percussionist Bikram Ghosh, who tied the knot only a few months ago with actress Jaya Seal Ghosh. 

 To facilitate ?serious buying?, Amber Buildwell, architect and interior designer for the mall, is busy creating ?the perfect ambience? for each of the four floors with different music and lighting arrangements.

 ?We will have both affordable and premium range of products in the mall. We would be sourcing both branded and non-branded items from various parts of the country,? adds Khaitan, who is expecting an average daily footfall of around 1,500.

 ?While there are specific marriage seasons, we are not expecting any seasonality in demand as people these days buy for weddings through the year,? feels Khaitan, adding that the e-commerce facility to be offered by the mall should also click with the customer.

 The annual volume of shopping surrounding marriages runs into thousands of crores. ?This city is an important market as a lot of traders source items from here and customers come in to Calcutta for marriage shopping,? adds Khaitan, explaining the viability of the venture. 

 Initial investment is pegged at Rs 15 crore and the promoters are looking at a five-year payback period.

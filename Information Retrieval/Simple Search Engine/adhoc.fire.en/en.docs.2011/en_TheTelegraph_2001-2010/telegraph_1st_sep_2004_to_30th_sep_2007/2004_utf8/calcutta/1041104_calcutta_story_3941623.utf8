The range of semi-formal and casual outfits for both men and women is available in various fabrics including silk, cotton, linen as well as georgette and crepe. The cuts and styles are essentially contemporary, for both ethnic as well as casual wear. From subdued earthy tones to vibrant electric colours, you?re sure to find a hue to match your mood.

Bolly shine

 Jewellery borrows Bollywood sheen in designer Shehzad Zaveri?s latest collection ? Bollywood By Design. It remains to be seen, however, if they shine brighter than they already do in stores across London, New York and Dubai under the brand name Minawala. 

 ?The collection borrows from the element of drama in Bollywood,? says Zaveri, showcasing huge, chunky pieces at the three-day jewellery exhibition at Taj Bengal starting November 4. These include octopuses carved on white gold bracelets and ruby tulips set in bangles. Earrings with intricately carved flowers from Australia, diamond-studded Swiss watches and jumbo-sized floral earrings wow as well. 

 The jewels in gold (yellow, white, pink) and studded with precious stones are priced at Rs 25,000 onwards.

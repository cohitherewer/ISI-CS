 Justice cry begets justice prod

 - Early listing ordered of 14-year case against rape-killing accused

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The matter, pending for 14 long years, was cleared in less then four minutes.

 Justice A.N. Roy, acting Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, took note of the news item published on Wednesday narrating the tale of how 10-year-old Moumita was allegedly killed by her 20-year-old neighbour Indrajit Sinha 17 years ago. 

 And how Moumita?s father, Kamal Krishna Mukhopadhyay, had renewed his plea for justice.

 Acting Chief Justice Roy expressed surprise over how the accused in the case was roaming free, having obtained bail from Calcutta High Court 14 years ago, and how the case was still pending in court.

 On Wednesday morning, the acting chief justice reached court before 10.30 am and summoned his secretary M. Kanoongo and asked him to produce the letter written by Kamal Krishna Mukhopadhyay, praying for early disposal of the case and seeking penal action against the accused.

 The acting chief justice read the letter and immediately asked his secretary to ensure that the proceedings of the appeal could be heard as soon as possible.

 ?He (the acting chief justice) was very surprised to go through the facts of the case, with an appeal pending for so many years,? said an official of the chief justice?s secretariat.

 ?Now, the case will be listed in the daily cause list and the appeal filed by the accused, challenging the validity of the trial court?s order, will be heard within a few days,? confirmed high court officials.

 Kallol Guha Thakurta, Mukhopadhyay?s lawyer, said: ?A few months ago, I myself had requested the then chief justice of Calcutta High Court to take steps so that the matter could be heard with immediate effect? The acting chief justice has promptly taken up the matter.?

 Guha Thakurta said the appeal pending with the court had been filed by accused Indrajit Sinha against the state government. ?So, my client, Mukhopadhyay, is de facto complainant here. I have to file a fresh petition before the court, seeking permission to allow my client to be added as a party. I will also move a petition for cancellation of the bail of the accused,? he elaborated.

 The grieving father had been prompted to write to the acting chief justice following the execution of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, the rapist-killer of Hetal Parekh, 14 years after the crime. Mukhopadhyay had lost his daughter, a student of Class III, in 1987, after she was allegedly pushed off a terrace by the accused for resisting his advances.

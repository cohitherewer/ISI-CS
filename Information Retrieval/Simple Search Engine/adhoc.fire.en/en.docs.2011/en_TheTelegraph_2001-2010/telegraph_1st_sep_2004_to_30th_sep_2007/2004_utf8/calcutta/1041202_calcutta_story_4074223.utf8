The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Red lights in sync, traffic SCOT free

 KINSUK BASU

 Traffic snarls, endless waits at signals and desperate honking of horns? 

 These defining features of Calcutta?s central business district may soon be a thing of the past, if a traffic management model, lifted straight out of Scotland Yard, works out as planned.

 The Split Cycle Optimistic Technique (SCOT), earlier tried out successfully in Delhi, will be put to use by the city traffic police to ease the rigours of a ride down Calcutta?s most congested area.

 SCOT aims at reducing significantly the ?delay time? at traffic signals. All signals in the central business district will be inter-linked through optical fibres and connected to a central computer, which will regulate vehicles along a particular stretch of road according to the traffic volume at a given point of time. 

 If the system works out in the central business district, it will be implemented in other zones of the city in phases.

 ?It often happens that irrespective of the time or the volume of traffic, one has to wait at a signal for a specific period. This is because the signals have been set to particular clock timings. After the new system is installed, separate sensors will regulate each signal according to the volume of traffic on the road,? explained Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic).

 Initially, the system will be pressed into action in the zone stretching from Strand Road in the west to CR Avenue in the east, and from Mahatma Gandhi Road in the north to Rani Rashmoni Road in the south. There are already 30-odd signals in the area and 13 more will be added for effective traffic control. 

 ?With the sensors in place, we will be able to bring down the delay during peak hours, when the volume of traffic is maximum,? a senior officer of the traffic department said, sounding confident about the efficacy of the new model. ?An Indian company has done this in the Capital and there is no reason why we can?t,? he added. 

 Encouraged by the module operative at Connaught Circus, police are also planning to ensure that the signals are on round-the-clock. 

 And while being effusive about the new module, the authorities have kept in mind the reasons behind the failure of the much-hyped green channel along CR Avenue. 

 ?All signals on the road are set to independent clock timings and, as a result, there is no sync,? explained an officer.

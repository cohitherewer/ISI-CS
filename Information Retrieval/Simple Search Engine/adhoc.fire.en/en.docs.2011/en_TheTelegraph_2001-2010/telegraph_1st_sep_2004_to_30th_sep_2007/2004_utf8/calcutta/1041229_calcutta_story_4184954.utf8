Greeting guidelines for ?05

Feng Shui

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, ringing a Buddhist bell 

or blowing a conch shell all around the house on New Years day fills the 

home with positive vibrations. This also helps dispel the stagnant energy in the 

house.

New beginnings with meaningful resolutions and the 

determination to accomplish them in the New Year is what we all look forward to. 

It?s worth a try to follow some of Feng Shui?s time-tested tips to make this happen.

Clutter free

 The New Year should be welcomed with a clutter-free environment in our homes and offices. This is the best time to bid goodbye to unused items like old clothes, shoes, broken crockery, old magazines, newspapers, bottles, cans, clocks, watches and electronic goods.

 Make space for the nourishing energy that brings prosperity into our homes. This is best done by clearing the house of stagnant energy.

 Blow conch shells and ring a Buddhist bell all around the house. This creates a high level of energy and fills the house with positive vibrations.

Lighting incense sticks and arranging fresh flowers 

make the atmosphere pleasing and inviting.

Forgive, forget

 Try to finish all your pending work during the present year so it is not carried forward. Forgive all those who have displeased you in the past. Your mind should be absolutely clear with no tension, anger, hatred or envy. 

Whatever you do on the first day of the New Year sets 

the trend for the days to follow. So it is essential that you avoid arguments, 

quarrels and negative thoughts and spread cheer among friends and relatives by 

sincerely wishing them a very happy New Year. Starting the year with charitable 

acts towards strangers will further add to the kitty of your good deeds. 

Fortune favours

No amount of money is ever enough, no matter how rich 

you are. So, you must follow two of the finest Feng Shui tips to bring good fortune 

into your home. 

 South-east is associated with wealth and hence must always be well energised. It would be unwise to keep this area messy, as that?s bound to have repercussions on your finances.

 On the other hand, water, which is akin to wealth in Feng Shui, should be kept here in the form of fountains to invite the easy flow of money to your home. It is important that you keep money in this area in a wealth bowl. 

It is a blunder to keep your money and valuables in 

the north-west area. Anything valuable kept here will not stay with you for long. 

Instead, you should write all your problems down on an auspicious day and time, 

and keep it in the north-west. This will help solve them over time.

On target

 The atmosphere of the first day of the year is usually electrifying and gives us confidence about achieving objectives that have eluded us in the past. Make resolutions, though you may not know how they will come true. It is believed in Feng Shui that along with your faith, determination and powerful thoughts, resolutions materialise when they are put down in writing, kept in a red envelope and placed in your worship area in the north-east. 

It is also considered auspicious to give children 

of the house some gifts or money in red envelopes. To make the year bountiful 

for everyone, it is a good idea to plant fruit trees in the garden so you prosper 

with the growth of the fruit-bearing trees.

Tip of the year

 Compliments received during a lifetime are more precious than material gifts. These rare possessions are filled with invaluable positive energy and you should start writing them from the very first day of the New Year. At the end of the year they will form a wonderful string of compliments which will serve as energy boosters during your depressed times. When you read them they will uplift your personal chi . Be lavish with your smiles and compliments for others as they cost you nothing but bring immense happiness to the person you are showering them on.

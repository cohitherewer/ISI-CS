 Why I?ve gone green

 NELANJANA BHOWMICK

 Each vegetarian saves about 80 

 animals each year from a lifetime of misery and death. A 

 vegetarian diet requires 300 gallons of water a day whilst 

 a meat-eating diet requires more than 4,000 gallons of water 

 a day.

 With statistics as disturbing 

 as these I opted for a healthier and humane way of life 

 ? I turned vegetarian.

 Last week, a shoot for PETA (People 

 For The Ethical Treatment Of Animals) India put things into 

 perspective. PETA, with more than 800,000 members, is the 

 largest animal rights organisation in the world. It operates 

 on the simple principle that animals are not ours to eat, 

 wear, experiment with or use for entertainment.

 Vegetarianism is one of PETA?s 

 largest campaigns. Animals in India are raised on cruel 

 factory farms and are then crammed into overcrowded lorries 

 for a nightmarish ride to the abattoir.

 Another concern is the use of 

 leather in the clothing industry. The Indian Council for 

 Leather Exports (CLE) has now pledged to work with PETA 

 and bring about reforms that would alleviate some suffering 

 of cattle and other animals used for leather.

 Animals suffer horribly for the 

 sake of human entertainment. An estimated 60-70 million 

 animals are used in experiments every year. You can be a 

 volunteer with PETA by reporting cruelty towards animals 

 and being a part of any PETA campaign you best identify 

 with.

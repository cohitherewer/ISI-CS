The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

An angel of animals 

NILANJANAA

Armyti Ravi Thakur never ceases to amaze me. At age 

60, she?s a sprightly, young girl whizzing on her Kinetic attending to wounded 

animals and looking after the assortment of pets at home. 

I attribute my knowledge of animal rescue and first 

aid to Armyti. As a six-year-old, she remembers her father (owner of Irani Caf?) 

feeding stray cats, dogs and the beggars who looked after these animals. At the 

caf?, you could spot a dog lolling around or a cat snoozing atop a table. 

Ten years ago, at age 50, Armyti decided to work for 

the stray animals of Mumbai. She joined the Welfare for Stray Dogs (WSD) as a 

volunteer, learning first-aid with 20-year-olds. Today, Armyti is one of the most 

sought-after and reliable animal volunteers in Mumbai. I have seen the most ferocious 

dogs cower in her presence, allowing her to nurse their wounds. She exudes compassion. 

Now, at age 60, Armyti?s house is a mini animal kingdom. 

All its inhabitants have been rescued. The two grey parrots, Sweetie Pies, were 

given up by their owners because they couldn?t speak. Stray cats Fatso and Gypsy 

were shot with an air gun by insensitive neighbours. And Raja, the blind crow, 

was rescued from the streets.

This, besides the battalion of stray cats and dogs 

that comes to her doorstep everyday for feed.

Armyti?s selfless dedication for animals makes me 

believe she?s the ?angel of animals?. In her words: ?My emotional bond with animals 

makes life worth living.?

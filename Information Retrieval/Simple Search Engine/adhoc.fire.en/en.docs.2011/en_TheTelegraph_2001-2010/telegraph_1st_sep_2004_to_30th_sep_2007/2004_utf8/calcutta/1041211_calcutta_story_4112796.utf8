Flight of fancy on Bard wings

With three plays, some magic and music, the city hit 

a Shakespeare high this week, says Sudeshna Banerjee

The city seems gripped with Shakespeare fever. As 

the winter chill creeps in after sunset, the evenings wake up to one production 

or the other, celebrating a tradition that has stayed alive ever since the Bard 

started being staged here in the 18th century.

Three plays, with encores for two, crowded the second 

week of December. While two were part of the just-concluded World Shakespeare 

Conference, the third was a product of Jadavpur University?s English department.

Let?s start with A Midsummer Night?s Dream. 

Brian Russo, a Fulbright scholar from the US, has been at work with a bunch of 

students from Loreto College and Rabindra Bharati University since October, trying 

to bring alive a corner of Mathura on the lawns of Loreto College.

Apart from speeches slightly abridged to keep with 

people?s diminishing attention span, the production was faithful to the text. 

If there was an attempt to equate the mischievous fairy king with the antic-happy 

Krishna, it remained restricted to Oberon?s headgear, carrying a peacock feather, 

and the strains of the flute in the background.

On Monday evening, the Shakespeare feast was spread 

out on the lush lawns. Three stages were constructed ? one represented the court, 

another the forest while the third was for the rehearsal of the mechanics, Bottom 

and company to be precise. On the second night, though, the scene shifted to Lincoln 

Room at the American Center where a sketch in the background served as a reminder 

of the leafy environs.

The play had its moments. Thanks especially to a power-packed 

performance from Helena (Zeba Nasim Sheikh), who was making the best of an author-backed 

setting, the encounter of the two pairs of lovers after Puck and his potion, was 

situational comedy on a hilarious high. It also helped that Helen was a clear 

foot-and-a-half taller than Hermia (Sravasti Datta), adding a physical dimension 

to the metaphoric references. The maids of Mathura in saris certainly fight no 

less spiritedly than Elizabethan belles over their men.

The play within the play in the courtroom in Act V 

comes second on the recall list. Here Nick Bottom (Diya Katyal) held forth even 

without his donkey?s mask as Pyramus. The success of the scene lay in every character 

bringing his or her bit to the table ? the Wall (Priyanka Roy) stood its ground, 

unshaken by the peering, pecking lovers while Thisbe (Shubhendu Sarkar) looked 

and sounded as funnily awkward in sari and squealing voice, as an unwilling cross-dresser. 

Puck (Natasha Dennis) looked and sounded perfectly 

mischievous in his brilliant costume and make-up. Some unwanted moments of mirth 

in the play, though, were caused by Oberon (Utpal Mukherjee)?s pronunciation mix-ups.

If laughter was the toast at Loreto College, the mood 

was sombre at Gyan Manch. Jadavpur University?s English department had chosen 

Measure for Measure, one of Shakespeare?s darker plays, in what is the 

quarter-centenary of the work. Director Ananda Lal had gambled with cross-dressing 

to tide over ?the usual difficulties in casting a Shakespeare play (too many male 

roles, too few female)?. In a play of such serious tone, there was every probability 

that the experiment would backfire if Angelo and Isabella, the central characters, 

were to sound and look funny during their crucial encounters.

But Lal was blessed in this regard. Angelo (Sreejita 

Deb), the ?outward-sainted deputy? of the Duke of Vienna, looked quite a young 

handsome Christ with his dense moustache, beard and curly locks, in the black 

robes of the law. And Simon Jennings, though not of maidenly features, brought 

Isabella alive in the nun?s habit. The falsetto, which was likely to have been 

his greatest weakness, was soon throbbing with a range of emotions ? indignation, 

shock, grief, relief? The director had requested for a willing suspension of disbelief. 

But the performances did not need viewers to strive too hard.

Every character played his or her part in keeping 

the audience riveted through the two-and-half hours (curtailed from its usual 

runtime of three hours). Appearances of Barnardine (Poushali Bhadury) and Mistress 

Overdone (Karma Yonzone) brought the house down in the rare moments of merriment.

The director had also added some ingenuous touches. 

To break the monotony of the Duke?s (Shuktara Lal) god-like monologues, some of 

his lines were turned into rap, complete with guitar-strumming and foot-tapping 

company. In the climactic final scene, a poster announced his return, ?The Dude 

is back?, flaunted appropriately by the churlish Lucio (Anoorupa Bose). The pi?ce 

de resistance though was the comic wooing of Angelo by Mariana (Bodhisatwa Dasgupta), 

looking every bit a comely eunuch on the side, while the Duke pronounced his sentences. 

The costumes (by Rimi B. Chatterjee) were also appropriate.

If A Midsummer Night?s Dream and Measure 

for Measure were campus products, Macbeth (or rather the most critical 

moments from the tragedy) was the work of veterans.

Suchanda, a guild, put together a dance drama of the 

play, using Odissi, kathakali, Manipuri and Bharatanatyam. Macbeth (Surangama 

Dasgupta) was the pivot around whom the production played itself out. Though the 

chosen section contained all of Lady Macbeth?s crucial lines, Macbeth, with his 

expressive and gleaming eyes and charismatic stage presence, overshadowed the 

rest of the cast. His clipped diction, too, did justice to the Bard?s feather 

(a live reading done backstage by Subhoranjan Dasgupta). But since the dialogue-delivery 

was slowed down to follow the dance movements, the lines lost the natural flow 

of speech. The appearance of the dagger, beckoning Macbeth towards his crime, 

in serpentine slithery moves, added to the sinister feel.

There was more than drama on offer at the World Shakespeare 

Conference. The Shakespeare choir presented its repertoire of songs while Aparna 

Sen, Amitava Roy and Rukmini Roy Basu read excerpts from Kalyan Ray?s novel Eastwords, 

based on Shakespeare. 

A bonus was the practical demonstration by Subir Dhar 

in course of his lecture on Elizabethan magic. Using paintings, woodcast, illustration 

in books and the plays themselves as sources, Dhar described the sort of magic 

that would be performed some 430 years ago on the streets of London. An audience 

member chose a page from a book and passed it onto a friend. Within seconds, the 

page was found to have been torn from the book. It was discovered at the back 

of Dhar?s black mirror, an Elizabethan apparatus.

The magic that the Bard wrought upon his audience 

at the Globe Theatre still casts a spell on us. And the good news is the season?s 

revels are not yet ended. Measure for Measure returns to the same venue 

on Monday.

 Rats bite patient finger

 - SSKM not alone in peril as rodents ravage the wards

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A patient in the chest department of SSKM Hospital woke up late on Tuesday with a cry of anguish ? a portion of his index finger had been bitten off by rats.

 Close to two months after the health department ordered that all cats roaming the corridors and wards of SSKM Hospital be trapped, the rats are running wild.

 Mahabir Bhagat, a middle-aged resident of Ranigunge admitted to the chest department for treatment of an infection three days ago, found that out with grotesque consequences.

 Like every other night, Bhagat went off to sleep around 10 pm on Tuesday, unaware of the danger lurking at his bedside. A while after the lights were turned off and the patients had dozed off, nurses on duty heard a loud shriek and rushed to Bhagat?s bedside.

 ?He was in agony, clutching on to his left hand, with blood all over the place. We spotted some rats scurrying away and realised, to our horror, what had happened,? recounted a nurse.

 The on-call emergency doctors and nurses later found that the rats had bitten Bhagat?s index finger.

 ?We had warned him about the sudden influx of rats and asked him to use the mosquito net, which he refused,? alleged one of the nurses.

 Hospital superintendent Santanu Tripathi was less defensive. ?We have asked the department to set up traps so that the rats can be caught and killed to protect the patients,? he said.

 Trouble broke out on Wednesday morning after Congress MLA Somen Mitra went to visit party worker Phatik Mondol, admitted in the same ward as Bhagat. ?I was stunned to see Bhagat in such pain. He was in tears and I immediately took up the matter with the hospital authorities. If the premier hospital of the city is in such a state, one can well imagine what the condition is in other hospitals,? said Mitra.

 The situation is close to alarming in the other state-run hospitals. Rats are causing havoc at NRS Medical College and Hospital, with most departments reeling under the threat. Rodents are also ravaging Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, with the medicine, surgery and gynaecology departments the worst hit.

 At RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, 58 cats have been caught but the rats are ruling almost every department.

 Authorities at Medical College and Hospital are ?worried? with the rat invasion at Eden Hospital. ?In view of the rat menace, we have kept two-three cats each in every department,? said A. Biswas, deputy superintendent.

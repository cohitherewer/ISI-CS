The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

With head held high

Very often we hear pet owners complaining about a 

vet?s negligence or animal lovers maligning NGOs working for animals. My point: 

instead of fretting and adding to the problems, please do your bit.

I came across ARC (Animal Relief and Care Society), 

a bunch of passionate, animal-loving people wanting to give strays their ?daily 

dose of love and care?. Here?s taking a closer look at ARC.

First aid: Its volunteers (school kids, college students, 

animal enthusiasts) attend to injured animals on the streets and go on vaccination 

drives.

Compassion is key: It treats animals free when the 

owners cannot afford to pay.

Awareness is all: It believes all efforts will be 

futile if a sense of compassion for stray animals is not instilled. It has conducted 

animal awareness programmes in schools and last year saw kids from various schools 

staging The Jungle Book (directed by Prof Aniket Deb Roy of St James) to 

raise funds for ARC and spread awareness. 

Flip side: It has a place that?s not functional yet. 

Add to that the lack of funds.

Big picture: Vaccination-sterilisation units, separate 

enclosures for injured/diseased animals and a shelter for abandoned pets.

The dream: A society that treats animals with dignity 

and compassion.

The leaders: Radhika (9831357028) and Romita (9830030182)

 Water gain four years on

 Over five years ago, Pankaj Banerjee, a close aide of Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, held up construction of the Ranikuthi booster pumping station by slapping on it a public interest litigation, describing the project as a threat to a local waterbody.

 On Sunday, Mamata, flanked by mayor Subrata Mukherjee and Banerjee himself, commissioned the booster station, which will directly benefit nearly 400,000 people by augmenting the supply of soft water, to be drawn in from the Garden Reach waterworks. 

 An estimated Rs 20 crore was spent on the booster station, complete with pipelines, laid over the past several weeks after digging up major arteries across south Calcutta. 

 Neither Mamata nor aide Banerjee offered any explanation for the four-year delay caused by the Trinamul-sponsored suit. Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya laid the foundation stone for the project in October 1998.

 The system will supply filtered, soft water to a 15-sq-km area, covering Azadgarh, Tilaknagar, Bijoygarh, Chanditala, Bapujinagar, Netajinagar, Ramgarh, Ashok Trust Road, Central Park, Kanungo Park and Vidyasagar. 

 Residents of these areas will receive water for an extra 45-minute slot at noon, at medium pressure, in addition to the existing morning and afternoon slots. 

 The commissioning of the booster station was preceded by the sinking of 95 deep tubewells. Thirty of them will be capped from Monday in the first phase. The remaining 65 will be closed once the target supply of 10 million gallons is attained. Only 6.5 million gallons are being drawn a day.

 The mayor announced that two more booster stations at Kasba and Kalighat will be commissioned by December.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

A fest mart for movies

Queuing up for that Iranian film, jostling at ticket 

counters from daybreak, arguing over Godard, or just pottering around till the 

next show. It?s the time when Nandan comes alive, serving up a heady brew of world 

cinema for all those movie buffs in town and beyond. The 10th Kolkata Film Festival 

takes off on November 10 for a week-long spread that the authorities assure would 

be ?high on quality?.

 Apart from the ?surprise package? (that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will announce on Tuesday), the festival promises to take on a different flavour with the government chanting the marketing mantra. Which means the gala might witness a director-distributor meet and some serious buying-selling. For this, the Confederation of Indian Industry is pitching in with a makeshift tent near the Tagore statue on the Rabindra Sadan grounds.

 ?This will be a platform for film-makers to show their films to distributors. This is essential as it?s very difficult to secure quality films from across the world if no buying-selling operation takes place during a film festival, be it Cannes, Berlin, Venice or Toronto,? says Nandan director Ansu Sur. 

 Hence the thrust on marketing. ?Over the past nine years, we have tried to create this despite several experiments even last year. But next time, we will certainly have a separate auditorium for market screening,? adds Sur.

 Perizaad: Beam time

Four films with the flavours of India, set in north 

Bengal and New York, Mumbai and London, are set to hit the small screen this month. 

As part of the Colours of India season, the 9 pm slot on Thursday nights on Star 

Movies is for films about Indian life and the lives of Indians abroad.

 First up on November 4 is the Rahul Bose-Perizaad Zorabian-starrer Mumbai Matinee (2003). Yes, it?s in Hindi, but with an off-beat theme it?s suitable for the Star Movies crowd. The adult content means it is definitely not for the whole family.

 The theme of a 32-year-old adman (Bose) desperately trying to lose his virginity, with the help of his friends and a little bit of love, is worth a watch, if only because it?s not the usual Bollywood storyline.

 Next, on November 11, is Bollywood Queen, starring the leading lady of the stage musical Bollywood Dreams, Preeya Kalidas. The East Ender?s Indian parents are trying to arrange her marriage. But she has secrets ? an R amp;B band and a white boyfriend.

 Jimi Mistry?s The Guru is showing on November 18, co-starring Heather Graham and Marisa Tomei. You?ve probably seen the tale of a taxi-driver-turned-sex-guru before, but catch it again for a good laugh.

 Finally, it?s Aparna Sen?s Mr amp; Mrs Iyer on November 25, with lead pair Konkona Sen Sharma and Rahul Bose. The National Award-winning English film is an unusual love story set against communal tensions and a departure from the regular Tollywood-Bollywood-Hollywood offering.

Healthy vibes: Koel and Ranjit Mullick with Jeet at the mahurat 

of the film Manik. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 The festive season over, a tight shoot schedule is knocking on the doors of Jeet and Koel Mullick. The two got together for the mahurat of Probhat Roy?s Manik at Indrapuri Studios on Monday. 

 The seasoned film-maker stages a comeback after three-and-a-half years of hibernation after Shesh Thikana.

 ?Manik is about a village boy who comes to the city to work for a promoter, puts the touts in place and falls in love with his daughter. But there?s a twist after the interval which I am not going to disclose,? says Roy, having busied himself all this while with a string of telefilms for ETV.

 The man who saw huge box-office successes with Shwet Patharer Thala and Lathi has drawn up a month-long schedule at Tollygunge, Aquatica, Taj Bengal and Hosseinpur before hitting snow-capped Shimla to can a couple of song sequences.

 Who plays what is quite obvious, but Roy has packed in a punch by casting the real-life father-daughter duo, Koel and Ranjit Mullick as (you guessed it right) father and daughter.

 ?I am a bit tense with him around though we will be working for the second time together after Nater Guru,? says Koel, playing a spoilt brat, of her reel-life father.

 ?And it?s my third film with Jeet, who is a very helpful co-actor,? she adds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 In black and white

What do you get when all elements of sound come together, 

all colours of light merge and the disturbances of life are equalised? White 

Noise ? the ?mother of soap operas? Vinta Nanda?s (picture below) directorial 

debut on celluloid.

 What prompted Vinta to switch to 35 mm and make the first film on the Indian television industry? ?To put it simply, when the television market changed with the new-found soap formula, I became a misfit in the industry and was out of work,? says the woman behind cable television?s first mega success serial, Tara.

 ?Balaji was obviously the pioneer of this new kind of television but everybody else succumbed to the era. Having done Umeed, Shatranj and Raahat, I refused to regress in my creative process and so became an outsider overnight,? she recounts.

White Noise was born after Mahesh Bhatt got 

together the seed money for the film. ?Both my protagonists (Rahul Bose and Koel 

Purie, in a film still above) work for a saas-bahu type of serial, which 

they do not subscribe to. Through their journey, I have tried to bring out the 

demons of the TV industry, the hypocrisies that exist,? reveals Vinta.

 Then again, the dissimulation of the film industry caught Vinta off-guard. ?While I always wanted Rahul to play the male lead after watching him in Mr amp; Mrs Iyer, I had cast Tabu for the main female role. A week before the first shooting schedule, she thought she was not getting enough money for the film and decided to back out. My whole plan collapsed. Friend Soni Razdan, who had worked with Koel for a play in London, suggested her name and Rahul got us together. It has been a blessing in disguise ? I got someone more fresh, more young.?

 Like Rahul?s character ? an editor who wants to make films like Ray but ends up doing sub-standard telly soaps ? Vinta too always wanted to be a film-maker. ?In that regard, White Noise is autobiographical to an extent. I ventured into this medium with self-proclaimed mentors like Ray, Fellini, Mrinal Sen, Oliver Stone, Shyam Benegal but when I landed up in Mumbai I had to do theatre first and then television, just to survive.?

 Despite having now worked in the medium she always wanted, Vinta is still very much tied to the telly. ?The world of television has become so common now, it?s impossible to quit. I am still producing TV software and come December and I?ll be making a big soap for STAR named Mili. Like Vijay Mallya produces alcohol even while he finances films, I?ll produce TV even as I direct movies!?

 So once White Noise releases this December, Vinta will be on to her next film, Kali, about a child widow in Uttar Pradesh.

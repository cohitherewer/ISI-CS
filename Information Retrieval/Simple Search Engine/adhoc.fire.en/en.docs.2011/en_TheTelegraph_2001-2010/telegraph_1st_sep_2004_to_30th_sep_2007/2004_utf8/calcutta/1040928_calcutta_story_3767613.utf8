The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Behind the bar

Tasteless going down, but 

memorable coming up. That?s vodka for you ? detached, unscented, flavourless, 

yet simply nonpareil and absolutely versatile. A joy juice that stirs a feeling 

that is, if not exactly a flavour, an unambiguous impression. 

Never mind the spiffy umbrella-dressed 

cocktails and the sassy packaging, if you?re a true connoisseur who agrees that 

no other tipple can match the interesting intricacy of a fine vodka?s versatile 

sensory profile, read on!

There?s just no end to what 

you can do with this invigorating miracle. It?s easy to appreciate and wild to 

drink. Formerly coupled with elegant hors doeuvres, it?s now the main ingredient 

in mouth-watering adaptations of Indian munchies and legendary mixes. 

All right, we?re ranting because 

we?ve probably just nibbled at a Vodka Gola, and are now heading for some more 

Vodka eats. 

We tried the recipes with 

Smirnoff vodka and we can tell you the results were simply great. But you can 

experiment with other brands too.

 Vodka Gol Gappas

Ingredients: 

Vodka, phuchkas

Method: Make phuchkas 

the usual way. Add vodka to the sizzling paani. Let the boiled potatoes 

rest for a bit in the vodka. Watch how the simple chaat triggers eye-popping 

fun!

Vodka Golas

Ingredients: 

Vodka, pineapple juice, sugar syrup

Method: Form golas 

with crushed ice. Squeeze lime on the golas. Pour a spoonful of sugar syrup 

on each of them. 

Prepare a mixture of vodka 

and pineapple juice (preferably syrup). The mixture should be a little thick. 

Pour the mixture over the golas. Slurp! Vodka with a difference.

Iced Vodka

Ingredient: One bottle 

of vodka

Method: Put a bottle 

of vodka in the freezer. Its high alcohol content keeps it from freezing, while 

the liquid turns temptingly viscous. 

Besides being drunk very cold, 

the vodka must be gulped down in a single swallow, tossing the liquid far back 

into the mouth. 

The reason is a practical 

one: if the vodka is sipped, one inhales the fumes, and the fumes cause drunkenness 

faster than the drink itself. 

The sensation of thick, ice-cold 

vodka surging down one?s throat is not forgotten in a hurry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sound amp; fury, then curtains on jatra dais

 TAMAL SENGUPTA 

 A scene from a jatra, a form of entertainment extremely popular in the districts. The government disregarded artistes reservations to go ahead and construct a permanent stage in Calcutta for the usually open-air fare. Four years on, it concedes that the project has its faults

 The beneficiaries were opposing it, but the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government was bent on implementing the project. After much ado over the construction of the states first dedicated jatra auditorium, Phanibhusan Bidyabinod Mancha in Bagbazar, the government is now on the backfoot.

 But while the stand-off between the government and those involved with jatra continued for around four years, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority had spent over Rs 1 crore on the project. 

 Actor Anup Kumar had conceived the project and put it across to then minister for information and cultural affairs Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in 1996. Construction began in mid-2000. But work on the site in north Calcutta stopped after some prominent jatra artistes objected to the project on the grounds of faulty planning and structural defects.

 Tapas Sen, stage personality and executive member of the Natya Akademi, said: I think the building should be pulled down immediately. The structure is not suitable for holding shows. He has also written to chief minister Bhattacharjee, requesting him to initiate measures to overhaul the existing structure. 

 Ruma Dasgupta, jatra personality and secretary of Jatra Prahari artistes forum, said she had found the auditorium unfit for shows. The artistes reservations about the auditorium became apparent in 2002, when the government tried to hold the Jatra Utsav at the incomplete mancha. But the owners of jatra companies refused to take to the stage and the festival had to be shifted to Mahajati Sadan, on CR Avenue. 

 The auditorium does not conform to jatra logistics. For instance, the green room is located next to the stage. Normally, the green rooms are behind and at a distance from where the artistes walk up to the stage using a ramp, Dasgupta explained. 

 Now, with the artistes taking a stand, the government has woken up. Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said he would inspect the site soon. Our objective is to use it as a permanent stage for jatra shows, said the minister. He, however, did not specify a deadline for completing the project. 

 Though artistes are happy, they point out that had their suggestions been sought at the planning stage, the defects could have been avoided. 

 When construction started, several artistes had questioned the necessity for a permanent stage for jatra in Calcutta.This medium of entertainment has always been popular in the rural areas. So, we wanted the permanent dais in some district, said an artiste. 

 Anup Kumar had, however, insisted that the structure be set up in the city. The government chose to go by his suggestion. Some leaders had chipped in with generous support for the project. CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta, who was then a Rajya Sabha member, gave Rs 67 lakh from his local area development fund. 

 But following the controversy, the Left leaders have changed their stand. Local CPM parliamentarian Sudhansu Sil and councillor Salil Chatterjee are now speaking in favour of minor additions and alterations to the structure. 

 The artistes are in wait-and-watch mode. Lets see what they deliver, said one of them.

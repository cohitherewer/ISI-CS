The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Star-struck night on stage and floor

Emami Beauty Secrets by Madhuri Anandalok Puraskar 

2004 was the talk of the town on Saturday. Preity Zinta?s absence took some sheen 

off the annual awards, but there was enough glitz and glitter to keep the star-gazers 

happy. Here?s the glam show at a glance... 

the awards

Catcalls and more catcalls. What else can happen when Ishaa 

Koppikar moves to Company and Kaante. The Khallas girl kicked 

up the oomph factor with a string of raunchy item numbers and all that razzle-dazzle

Rising star Koel Mullick took the stage for the first song-and-dance 

number of the evening with co-star Jeet 

Ranjit Mullick, who received a special award for his contribution 

to Bengali cinema, gave away the Best Actor award to Sabyasachi Chakraborty. The 

deafening applause showed just what Feluda means to the masses

Miss Mallika may have stolen the thunder in Murder, but 

screen-hubby Ashmit Patel didn?t go wholly unnoticed. Little wonder then that 

the Best Debutant had one of the best seats in the house, beside Moon Moon Sen 

Congrats! Said Saif Ali Khan to producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, 

after he bagged the Best Bollywood Film award for Munnabhai MBBS, as Vidya 

Balan smiled on. Soon, it was the Hum Tum lad?s turn to pick his Best Actor?s 

prize. ?I never knew I was so sentimental until a man in Siliguri called me Didi 

ka ladka. If it were not for my mother, I would have never been in this industry. 

So, I dedicate this to her,? said the son of Sharmila Tagore

His witty asides often had the crowds in splits, while she perked 

up the glam quotient. MCs Derek O?Brien and June kept the show going smooth 

The aftermath

The prizes won and lost, the party crowd headed straight for 

ITC Sonar Bangla where a lavish spread of food and cocktails awaited all. Sreela 

Majumdar, June and Sudipa (from left to right) seemed more footloose and fancy-free 

than famished

The dance floor is too cramped, the sip-and-bite table is more 

cosy. Chaiti Ghoshal, Deboleena Dutta and Arunima Ghosh settled down for a chat 

and to catch others in action 

He was one of the first to hit the floor and the last to leave. 

Parambrata Chatterjee, in red, was a great hit among the girls

It was Babul Supriyo who coaxed Jeet into an impromptu jig on 

stage to a Kishore Kumar track, but the macho man stumped the Bollywood singer 

by snatching the mike and rounding off the song. The two got into the groove yet 

again, this time at the Pala party 

Arjun Chakraborty and wife Nilanjana didn?t need much coaxing 

either to join the fun club.

 Puja getaway

 SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

 This Dashami you can be at... 

 Deulty 

 Challenge the explorer in you 

 to veer a little off the beaten track on Bombay Road towards 

 little-known Deulty to unearth a piece of literary history 

 while on the last leg of your festive holiday. 

 Tucked away on one side of the dirt road leading up to the banks of the Roopnarayan river is a rather nondescript two-storeyed bungalow shaded by a bamboo grove and a host of other flora you ought to look out for. An old caretaker will welcome you to Samtaber. It?s a good idea to befriend him for a guided tour around the house that was Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay?s residence during the last 12 years of his life. 

 As you follow him around, leading from the novelist?s drawing room to his writing room and through the cool confines of the first floor made entirely of mud that houses the bedrooms, it?s not too difficult to feel the creative pulse in the calm that surrounds the residence. 

 Dulal, the caretaker, proudly shows off the writer?s bed, armchairs, writing table, shoes, walking stick and even deities, which he has painstakingly preserved for the past 30 years.

 A lazy afternoon on any weekend 

 and public holiday will see groups of visitors trickle in 

 to hear Dulal?s tales, as they follow him around the Burmese-style 

 villa, spread over an area of three bighas, surrounded 

 by wide verandahs. 

 The writer who penned evergreen works like Devdas and Srikanto had gone to stay with his uncle in Yangon for a while during an outbreak of the plague in India, and the influence shows in this airy abode. 

 According to the elderly guide, it was the gurgle of the Roopnarayan river that attracted Sarat Chandra to the site. The river now flows about one km from the house. A small pond directly opposite the main entrance and a rice field in the back are about all the natural ambience left to flank it now. 

 The green of the farm may also soon disappear, with murmurs being heard of a park to be constructed on the spot, to include a museum dedicated to the life of Sarat Chandra.

 Winter is the best time to visit the area, when the banks of Roopnarayan are dotted with picnickers. The week-long annual Sharad Mela from January 21 to 27 is another attraction. The place is also known for its literary meets that draw in a host of like-minded people.

 But before the pace of progress catches up with the peace that emanates from the red-tiled flooring of Samtaber adorned with ornate alpana and its still porches, there?s time to soak in the ambience that nurtured literary masterpieces like Abhagir Swargo, Mahesh, Palli Samaj and the fourth and final part of Srikanto before the writer?s demise in 1938.

 Getting there:

 It takes roughly one-and-a-half 

 hours to reach Deulty by car. Turn right off Bombay Road 

 after Bagnan, that is just before you hit Kolaghat. Alternatively, 

 you can take Mecheda, Panshkura, Midnapore or Kharagpur 

 local from Howrah and alight at Deulty station from where 

 Samtaber is roughly two to three km away

 Where to stop:

 Nirala is one of the few resorts 

 dotting the place. With plush air-conditioned rooms, swimming 

 pool, children?s park, boating and indoor and outdoor games, 

 it also arranges tours to neighbouring Gadiara and Gayonkhali.

 But young couples, beware. The 

 establishment is strictly ?families only?, and if you don?t 

 have a young kid in tow, you are likely to be treated with 

 a degree of suspicion.

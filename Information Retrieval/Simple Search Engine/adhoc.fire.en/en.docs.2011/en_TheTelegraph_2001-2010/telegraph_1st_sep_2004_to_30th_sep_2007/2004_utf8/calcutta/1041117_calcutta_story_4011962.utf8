 After Paris and Versailles, it?s time for the Mittal marriage caravan to roll into Calcutta. But unlike the fairytale ? or filmi ? French fiesta, this weekend?s party ? at the Mittal address of 24 Alipore Road ? promises to be a low-key affair.

 ?It is with great pleasure that I invite you on 20th November, 2004, to meet my grand-daughter Vanisha and her husband Amit Bhatia. I look forward to seeing you at 24 Alipore Road at 8 o?clock in the evening. Please join us in the celebration and bless the couple.?

 Thus reads the pre-invitation card invite sent out by Mohan Lal Mittal, hosting a closed-door reception for steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal?s daughter.

 ?The invitation card will follow shortly, but we request that you mark the date in your diary. Without the presence and good wishes of close friends and family, no celebration is complete,? adds the father of the richest Indian.

 After the hype and hoopla that came before and after the June wedding in the historic chateau in Versailles, about two hours from Paris, the Calcutta reception has been kept under wraps.

 A spokesperson for Lakshmi Mittal confirmed over phone from Mayfair, London, that ?the family will be going to Calcutta on November 20 for a party hosted by Mohan Lal Mittal on that day?. He added that ?it?s a personal matter and I don?t have any more details?.

 As Mohan Lal Mittal was travelling, he could not be contacted. Sources in the Mittal household revealed special arrangements were on in full swing, but behind firmly-shut doors.

 The six-day French extravaganza this summer had a sprinkling of CEOs and cine celebs, from Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai to Akshay Kumar and Kylie Minogue. There was a mandap made of roses in the middle of the pool and palaces with elephant-shaped pillars. The wedding bill: a cool ?30 million.

 The guest list for the city do, however, promises to be small and special. Speculation is already rife in the business community about who?s ?in? and who?s ?out? of the Mittal fold.

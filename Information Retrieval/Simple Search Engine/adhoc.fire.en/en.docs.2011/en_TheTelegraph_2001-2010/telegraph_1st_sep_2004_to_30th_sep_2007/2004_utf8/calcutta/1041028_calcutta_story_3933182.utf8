The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dark after power cuts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Large swathes of South Calcutta, Salt Lake and the city?s northern and southern suburbs were plunged into darkness on Wednesday evening following a major fault at the State Electricity Board?s (SEB) 400-KV sub station in Zeerut, 20 km north of Barasat. 

 The large-scale power disruption comes four days after the Pujas and at a time when the state-run and the CESC?s power plants are generating full steam. 

 The fault that occurred around 5.15 pm led to a termination of supply from the SEB grid to the CESC?s receiving station at Kasba. This led to a shortfall of about 70 MW in the CESC-served areas. 

 Consequently, large areas of south Calcutta, including Kasba, New Ballygunge, Jadavpur, Behala and their adjoining areas experienced hour-long to one-and-a-half-hour-long power cuts. The northern suburbs of Dum Dum, Baguiati, Barasat, Salt Lake and their neighbourhoods suffered prolonged power cuts. In the southern suburbs, vast areas stretching from Sonarpur to Lakshmikantapur went without power for several hours.

 A power department official said the disruption took the authorities by surprise as generation was good during the Pujas. Senior SEB engineers have gone to the Zeerut sub-station to repair the ?bus fault.?

 Power supply was partially restored to the southern suburbs and Salt Lake by diverting electricity from Bakreswar through an alternate 220-KV supply-line, via Sathgachia. 

 ?Our engineers are working on a war footing and we expect the situation to be normal by late tonight,? said a power department officer.

 Wednesday being Lakshmi puja, the large-scale power cuts came as a dampener as the goddess is worshipped in many homes. Residents had a harrowing time in Jodhpur Park, New Ballygunge, Jadavpur and Salt Lake.

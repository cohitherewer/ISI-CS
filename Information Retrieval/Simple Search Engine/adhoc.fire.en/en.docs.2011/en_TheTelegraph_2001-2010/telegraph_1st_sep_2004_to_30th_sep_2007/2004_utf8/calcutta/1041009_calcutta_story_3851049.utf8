The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 West Bengal was perhaps one of the few states where theatre was an integral 

part of the culture and dramas were staged religiously on Thursdays and during 

weekends. Great theatre personalities like Girish Ghosh, Sisir Bhaduri, Ahindra 

Chowdhury, Sambhu Mitra and Utpal Dutta contributed a lot to Bengali theatre. 

It is disheartening that several theatres like Rangmahal, Minerva, Biswarupa in 

north Calcutta and Tapan in south Calcutta have stopped staging Bengali plays. 

It is in Tapan Theatre that the hit show Nahabat ran for four years. These 

days cable television offers a wide range of entertainment programmes. But I feel 

Bengali theatre still has a lot of potential. Efforts should be made to revive 

Bengali theatre. Perhaps, the renovation of Star Theatre is the first step in 

that direction. 

Bhupen Bose,

 The government seems least bothered about the problems faced by us students 

during monsoon. The road in front of Modern High School for Girls in Ballygunge 

is in miserable condition and it has become extremely dangerous for us to cross 

it due to the ongoing construction work. The footpath is almost non-existent and 

we are compelled to walk on the potholed road.

 The condition of the stretch near the Taratala crossing has become so bad that 

travelling in any vehicle is almost like a roller-coaster ride. Pujas are approaching 

and I shudder to think of the plight of those who plan to pandal hop on foot. 

The pace of work at the flyover construction site is also dismal. The number of 

workers employed seems less than required for construction of a four-storeyed 

building. The chief minister?s orders to complete all flyovers at the earliest 

doesn?t seem to have hastened the pace of work here. Ironically, the government 

wants vehicles to conform to Euro II standards. Why doesn?t it also emulate the 

standards of maintenance of roads in Europe?

Diamond Harbour Road. 

 Why are the officers in the State Bank of India in the dark about rules and 

laws that regulate accounts of any description? After the death of my sister and 

brother-in-law about two years ago, my nephew went to get their term deposit accounts 

transferred in his name as they were joint accounts with him as the second account-holder 

and as the beneficiary, too. But the officer at the Dalhousie Square branch told 

him that he would need a succession certificate. Now, the bank has a new officer 

and he says my nephew doesn?t need the certificate at all since it was a joint 

account and either/survivor was to be the beneficiary. So his money lay idle because 

of the ignorance of an officer who must be drawing a fat salary for his ineptitude. 

Lina Biswas, 

Bentinck Street.

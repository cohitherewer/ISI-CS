diktat on CMC

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 

 The city civic authorities will have to undertake a tree plantation programme over a large part of Calcutta in order to fell trees for widening Darga Road and Mahanirvan Road, and construct a booster pumping station at Jorabagan.

 On Monday, officials said the West Bengal Pollution Control Board had directed Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to submit the programme plan before it starts to widen the roads and construct the pumping station.

 ?Trees need to be felled to execute development projects. We must compensate for the felling by planting saplings,? said Shyamal Sarkar, member-secretary of the board. ?We would like to believe that the civic body will fulfil the conditions for new plantations and transplantations. We will take stern action against the CMC if any condition is violated.??

 The board insisted on the tree plantation programme in the light of the random felling of trees in north and central Calcutta by contractors engaged by the CMC for road widening. Prompted by the popular outcry, the board had withdrawn the permission given to the CMC for felling trees.

 ?We will conform to the dictates of the pollution control board,? said mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

 The civic body will now be allowed to fell 36 trees for construction of the Jorabagan booster pumping station only if it plants 200 saplings on Rabindra Sarani, Nimtala Street and CR Avenue. Several small trees will also have to be transplanted in the Jorabagan area.

 Permission has been granted to fell 24 trees for widening Darga Road. The civic body will have to compensate by planting 125 saplings of fast-growing varieties on CIT Road, Suhrawardy Avenue, Orient Row, Tiljala Road, Biresh Guha Road and Dehi Serampore Road. Besides, small trees have to be transplanted around the Park Circus maidan.

 For widening Mahanirvan Road, the CMC has been allowed to fell 37 trees, on the condition that it plants 200 saplings on Panditiya Road, Manoharpukur Road, Tilak Road, Motilal Nehru Road, Aswini Dutta Road and Sarat Bose Road. Transplantation of small trees will have to be carried out at Deshapriya Park and Rabindra Sarobar.

 If the CMC fails to plant new trees, it has to provide funds to the forest department to do the work. It will also have to submit a compliance report to the board, along with a certificate from the department.

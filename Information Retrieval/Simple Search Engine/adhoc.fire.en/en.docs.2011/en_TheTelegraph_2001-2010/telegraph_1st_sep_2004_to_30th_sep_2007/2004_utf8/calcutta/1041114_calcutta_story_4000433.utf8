 Diwali proved to be extra special 

 for the disco-hopping crowd of Calcutta as a mini army of 

 film stars invaded Shisha and Tantra, the two happening 

 nightclubs, post-midnight.

 Saif Ali Khan, Raima and Ria Sen, 

 Ashmit Patel, Rahul Bose? If you think this star parade 

 hogged the limelight, you?re mistaken.

 For it was an outsider ? a fair 

 and lovely lady in sari ? who stole the whole show.

 Who?s that girl, was the buzz 

 on every partygoer?s lip as she shimmered in a pale pink 

 embroidered georgette sari with an ornate choli and 

 heavy jewellery to match.

 The answer that came blowing in 

 the wind ? or rather smoke ? was, ?She?s Italian? Her name?s 

 Rosa? She?s Saif?s??

 While Saif dressed in plain red 

 T-shirt and denims decided to give the dance floor a miss 

 at the hookah bar on Camac Street, once in Tantra, the couple 

 steamed up the dance floor in between chill-out sessions 

 at the Bodhi Bar.

 Back at Shisha, Saif and gang 

 seemed quite chilled out, mingling with all and sundry (the 

 star son of Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Sharmila Tagore 

 in town for Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s Parineeta even offered 

 his drink to a fellow party person).

 As phone calls and SMSs shot out 

 to party people missing out on the action ? ?Saif here, 

 come fast?, ?Guess who?s here? Saif and his girl? ? the 

 hookah bar was brimful in 15 minutes flat.

 Another Bollywood star, Rahul 

 Bose, busy shooting for Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s Kalpurush 

 in the Tollygunge studios these days, preferred to keep 

 a lower profile, nursing his drink at the bar and politely 

 answering questions from a curious guest or two.

 Leading the brigade of city celebs 

 at both the night addresses, with the Bollywood big guns, 

 were Sen sisters Ria and Raima. Keeping them company was 

 Murder man Ashmit Patel, drawing glances and gapes 

 of his own.

 ashing that priceless Suchitra 

 Sen smile and dressed in a red A-line dress, Raima was a 

 huge hit. She stuck to little sis Ria, in white top and 

 black stretch trousers, in town ever since Raima?s birthday 

 bash last Saturday.

 At the other end of town Incognito, 

 the disco at Taj Bengal, was ready to host its in-house 

 stars ? Team India and Team Pakistan. But former West Indian 

 great ? and match referee for the India-Pakistan tie at 

 Eden Gardens ? Clive Lloyd was the sole star attraction 

 on Friday night. 

 But for those on a cricket nostalgia 

 trip, in tune with the BCCI?s platinum jubilee celebrations, 

 sharing floor space with the Big Cat was quite a story to 

 tell.

 Console call

 What happens when an office full 

 of people decides to just have fun one day?

 It descends on Tantra by day, 

 not night.

 Friday the 12th found computers 

 being dumped to answer the call of the console as the Vishnu 

 Solutions Private Limited team trooped into Tantra.

 The crowd proved that partying 

 at 1 pm can be bigger fun than partying at 1 am, especially 

 when you?re doing it with a family of 300.

 The afternoon could best be described 

 as a Bollywood extravaganza with Hindi tracks being a real 

 hit with the office-party crowd.

 To take full advantage of an officially-sanctioned 

 fun day, most seemed determined to prove their prowess on 

 the dance floor. 

 Remixes reigned supreme in the 

 first half with tracks like Kabhi aar kabhi paar and 

 Kaanta laga being the rage. Blast from the past done, 

 it was fast forward to the title track of Dhoom that 

 caused all the dhamaka.

 Curfew time for this party with 

 a difference was 6 pm, but for many the Diwali fun had just 

 begun. ?The evening is still young and the night is yet 

 to descend. Catch us at the same venue post 10.30 at night,? 

 was a cry from the crowd.

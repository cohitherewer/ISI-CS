The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Ishaa Koppikar: Live wire

 Lead roles changing fortunes is fine. A cameo doing the trick is understandable. But one song turning around an entire career is something else altogether. That?s exactly what Khallas has done for Ishaa Koppikar.

 And now, she?s back in prized company. Ishaa is all set to play a dancing girl in D, Ram Gopal Varma?s prequel to Company. 

 ?I signed the film a few days ago and haven?t started shooting yet. Yes, it would be great to create a splash again. All I can say at this stage is that I dance in a bar and to know or see more, you have to check out the film,? she told Metro.

 While D will take some time to hit the theatres, Ishaa?s Sharon Stone act in the Basic Instinct remake Inteqam is playing in the halls at the moment. ?Whoever has seen it has liked my performance. But the promotion has been so low key that very few people have actually gone to watch the movie. And there?s very little I can do about that. I have done my best in the film. In fact, I don?t care about the rest. I have learnt to move on from one project to another. It?s true that it is quite difficult to switch off from a particular project but you have to learn to do it.?

 Ishaa spends a lot of time through the year performing live in stage shows all across the globe and finds it more challenging than facing the camera.

 ?The entire vibe is so different. It?s like a one-take shot. The energy level has to be totally different. There are no repeat takes. So that one take better be good.?

 In the city for the Anandalok film awards, Ishaa expressed a keen interest in Bengali films. ?I would absolutely love to do a Bengali film. I know the role of the woman here and there are so many women-oriented films happening. And you have such great directors working like Rituparno Ghosh and Goutam Ghose. After all, this place produced masters like Satyajit Ray and Hrishikesh Mukherjee.?

 Ishaa also has two other films in her kitty. There?s David Dhawan?s untitled comedy co-starring Salman Khan, Sushmita Sen and Katrina Kaif, and Ektaa Kapoor?s Kya Kool Hain Hum alongside Ritesh Deshmukh and Tusshar Kapoor.

 But it?s clear what she?s really looking forward to ? some more khallas.

Colin Farrell: In Alexander?s shoes

 Oliver Stone?s new magnum opus Alexander will be the ?first Hollywood movie to be introduced in India?. E-City Entertainment, promoters of the popular multiplex chain Fun Republic, recently announced its foray into the distribution of international films in India through an extended arm, Xenon Films, to be officially launched in December 2004.

E-City Entertainment will be in sole charge of distribution 

and circulation of all films in the Mumbai circuit, while the rest of the country 

will be targeted through its allied partners. All the movies in the deal have 

been acquired directly through independent producers or sales agents in the UK 

and USA.

 While the first movie to be brought to India during Christmas will be the $160 million dollar Angelina Jolie-Colin Farrell-starrer Alexander, other films lined up for 2005 include John Woo?s The Truth About Love, John Stephenson?s Anything Can Happen, If You Believe In It, Frankie Dunn?s Million Dollar Baby and Vijay Singh?s One Dollar Curry.

About the acquisition, Atul Goel, CEO, E-City Entertainment, 

said: ?We at E-city have noticed that the Indian consumer?s preference for a good 

English production is on a high. The entertainment business has been growing steadily 

and since we have always been in the forefront when it comes to giving our business 

a logical extension to film distribution, we have decided to bring in eight to 

12 quality English films every year to India.?

 Cine Channel is celebrating its sixth anniversary. Launched in 1998, the channel is beamed across 52 cities in India and reaches over 6.13 million households. The exclusive movie-based entertainment channel is broadcast through Hathway Cable network.

 The channel?s 17 hours of daily programming time include Hindi movies from a collection of more than 1,000 films in its library. There are a host of other film-based programmes focusing on Hollywood movies and the latest Hindi film songs.

 On the occasion of completing six years, Jayaraman, CEO and managing director, Hathway Cable amp; Datacom, said: ?This is a manifestation of the success of our strategic focus on providing end-to-end customer satisfaction. With more exciting times to come in the coming years, we affirm that we will continue to bring the latest quality programming and production for our viewers?.

 The channel is also coming up with a bouquet of scary films for the whole of November along with some oldies and other movies from the 80s.

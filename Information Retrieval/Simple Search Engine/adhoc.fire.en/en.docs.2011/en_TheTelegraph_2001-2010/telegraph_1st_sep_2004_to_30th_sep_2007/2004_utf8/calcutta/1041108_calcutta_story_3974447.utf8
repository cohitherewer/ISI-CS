 Safety checks for sweets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Those with a sweet tooth will finally feel secure about the quality of their purchase in the days ahead. And they will also feel safe while purchasing butter, ghee, paneer and other milk products.

 In the absence of proper planning and infrastructure, milk and milk products in the city and its adjoining areas remain largely unchecked by the government.

 But with complaints of adulteration pouring in and the Centre prodding the state government to step up vigil against the devious ways being adopted by manufacturers, especially those involved in the sweetmeat trade, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is finally setting things in place.

 ?We were wondering for some time how to empower officials of the animal resources development department to hold regular checks in shops and manufacturing units for maintaining the quality of milk and milk products,? said a Writers? Buildings official. 

 Currently, health department officials conduct checks on all food items, but there is no special emphasis on milk and milk products. 

 As a number of officials in the animal resources development department are qualified for the job, it would help the government if they are entrusted with conducting checks on milk and milk products.

 With this end in view, the department has decided to write to the health department to empower the officials to conduct checks and to keep a close watch on the products to prevent adulteration.

 ?Officials are looking into the provisions of the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act to finalise how the system can be introduced,? said animal resources development minister Anisur Rahman. 

 The government checks the quality of milk while procuring it from farmers or milk unions as well as the milk products sold through its outlets. ?However, as a number of private players, too, are in the business, regular checks are a must to maintain the standard,? an official said. 

 The main focus of the vigil will be on milk products. ?Plenty of milk products are available in the market. Unfortunately, not all are produced hygienically. That is why we are planning to introduce regular checks,? the official added. 

 According to the PFA Act, food (health) authority means the director of medical and health services or the chief officer in charge of the health administration in a state. Any official empowered by the Centre or the state government (through a notification in the official gazette) can discharge the duties of the food (health) authority.

 ?We feel our officials are qualified to do the job and we will discuss the issue with the health department to finalise the process,? informed an official of the animal resources development department.

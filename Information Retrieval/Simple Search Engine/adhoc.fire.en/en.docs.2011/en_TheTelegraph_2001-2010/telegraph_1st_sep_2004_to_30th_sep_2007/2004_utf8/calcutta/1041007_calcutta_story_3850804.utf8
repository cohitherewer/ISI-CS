 Tanners get to maintain complex

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government said on Wednesday it would relieve M.L. Dalmiya amp; Co, builder and operator of the Calcutta Leather Complex (CLC), of the responsibility of maintaining the common infrastructural facilities at the CLC and offer the job to tannery-owners.

 State commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said neither the government nor M.L. Dalmiya amp; Co had any objection to the arrangement. ?One part of the work at CLC is to build the infrastructure, which includes roads, providing water and power connections, other construction work and so on. That part is ready. The other is to maintain all this. Tannery-owners have said they want to take the responsibility of maintenance, and the government has agreed to their proposal. Dalmiya, too, has no objection,? secretary Sen said, with minister Nirupam Sen by his side.

 ?Tannery-owners have said they will best understand their own facilities. We don?t have any problem with that,? the secretary added. 

 Unlike Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s attack last week, minister Sen on Wednesday was less harsh on Dalmiya amp; Co, tasked to build, operate and transfer the CLC over a 30-year period. 

 ?The blame for delay cannot be laid on any particular person. There was a court case involved and the Supreme Court orders were followed? The matter cannot be explained in just a few words. All I can say is that we are working on this and the matter will be sorted out soon,? minister Sen said on Wednesday.

 Dalmiya amp; Co was ticked off by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Friday for things ?moving too slowly?. The chief minister had said publicly that he was not happy with the progress of the leather complex. 

 He had also spoken of a shift of power from the builder-operator, saying: ?I think the management control (of the complex) should go to the industry.? 

 Minister Sen, however, said today: ?I don?t want to make anyone hostile, as it will send out a wrong signal to the investor community. We want investors to come, and sending out a wrong signal is to be avoided. Everything in a project cannot happen smoothly. We are going to sort out everything amicably,? he added. 

 Tannery-owners have already been asked to form a registered company by October 10 and assume responsibility of running the plant. ?Tannery-owners wanted to take control of things that directly affect the quality of their product ? like maintenance of the common effluent treatment plant, water supply and so on. The government has no problem with that,? Sabyasachi Sen said.

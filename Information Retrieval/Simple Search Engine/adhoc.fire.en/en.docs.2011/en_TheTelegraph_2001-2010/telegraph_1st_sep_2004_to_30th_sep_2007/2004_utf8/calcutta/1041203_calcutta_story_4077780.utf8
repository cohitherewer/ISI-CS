The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Words and verses to soothe the soul

Happy or sad, long or short ? verses are a way of expressing 

emotions like no other. Angst and anger, mirth and madness are a part of life, 

especially during the wonder years. Growing up is an everyday pain and nothing 

seems the same from one moment to another. Young Metro is overwhelmed with 

poems flooding in from students. This page is dedicated to the budding poets, 

and those simply finding a way out from the confusion.

Transparency in my feelings does not show,

It?s an open secret, it?s earth shattering, 

Kleptomania seems a way of life for you ? 

Taking each heart away with you? 

The traces of feet in the sand vanish, 

My presence in your life is such ? simply transient. 

The loud silence ? it deafens me ? 

You are unaware of the claustrophobia 

I see, in your retina, 

My image lasts only a split second? 

Seasons come and seasons go, 

Never do they last. 

I walk bare feet, each post I pass. 

Leaves flutter and winds go by. 

Yesterday the sun shone bright, 

The dry earth cracked so. 

Today God showers His love on me, 

Pours oceans of transparency? 

I am soaked till inside, from deep within, 

I feel hot tears roll down my cheeks. 

Winds whistle past me, they shake me, 

From sanity to insanity. 

Try as I may, they never cease, 

The waves, wild, they howl and shriek, 

As if in pain, in anger, agony? 

In hope that paradise shall return? 

Barkha Sharda 

Class XI, Ashok Hall (both poems)

The weirdest feeling that I know 

I don?t know very well 

You burp the same time there is thunder

I think I am going to hell 

I can do anything you say 

Anything you say at all 

I won?t need a warning or a sign 

I am not afraid to fall 

I can close my eyes and turn around 

I am not that scared 

I like my chocolate all the time 

I am always being dared 

I laugh at my friends, they laugh at me 

I always have so much fun 

I think I have changed for the better 

I am in love with everyone 

I cruise in the car, whenever I can 

I love the wind in my hair 

I stick out my tongue and wave it about 

I never have any care 

I love the smell of looming rain 

I think I think too much 

I love the trees, skies and moon 

I would love to be able to touch 

The stars that are in the sky 

The pulse of thoughts in my mind 

The rain that keeps falling down 

I am so happy I am alive. 

Subhankar Chakraborty,

Class XI, Ushumpur Adarsha Uchcha Vidyaylaya 

In the dark alleys / Of the worn-out light, / The 

shrouded night stands / Lamenting the loss / Of the finished yesterday; / With 

a blinding flash, / A shooting star ends / Its own life, / Mingling into the / 

Bright new morning. / Blinded still, / There is no light ? / The alleys are darker 

still..... 

Toral Dasgupta Saha, 

2nd year, St Xavier?s College

The white bed is lowly made 

From where the scenes change, 

The day?s diffusion 

Into the night?s starry maze.

What a wonderful sight to gaze! 

While the soul sits and plays 

The chords of the guitar 

F, G, A minor ? 

He plucks to speak the truth of woe, 

He strikes to sing of life as a foe, 

He strums to accuse the sky, 

A shadow play of greys and blues 

That meets the naked eye. Then the soul dies...............

.....................I arise, 

And reach for the coil, 

To drive away the flies. 

Anwesha Chakraborty, 

English (hons), Bethune College

Zillions of electron fly 

Through my body 

Carrying 

The last music of a July night. 

The radiated music remembers 

The crowded hearts 

Boozed in kisses. 

After that, 

The venoms of two heavens and two beliefs 

Butchering the lens of love. 

Pack emptiness. Kindled ashes 

Freezing the nude sky of the blue island. 

Blue kisses fly in flashback, 

Of a melodious death. 

My blue period. 

July night and the mad kiss are 

Filling a paragraph here, 

The long died blue period. 

My blue period ? 

Can you give me back ?

From the crossroads? 

Altaf Hossain,

Sociology, St Xavier?s College

Roads turned to cemetery, 

Dwellings to smoking cinders. 

Countless lie without the life in them, 

The liquid of life flows asunder. 

Blossoming flowers plucked early, 

From their wailing mothers. 

The once cerulean sky, now black with smoke, 

Which the churlish youths don?t bother. 

The harsh realities of life brought closer 

Which the tender don?t grasp. 

They stand bleating oer their dead parents, 

Their lives under terror clasps. 

What do we mean by this? Civility? 

Nothing, but utter human atrocity. 

Shubharthi Pandey, 

1st year, English, JU

Poetry would be born tonight 

Of a bloody throbbing womb. 

And then on, could never sever this chord. 

A lotus stem issues forth from the navel 

Bends and touches the olive-oil skin. 

In every whisper there is the promise 

Of a coming back. 

Hopes bloom in deep darkness; 

Can words bear this silence? This stillness? 

Pulsating between the valleys; 

Engulfing the being and the body ? 

Worse than birth pangs: pleasant pain, 

And drawing circles with a hollow green stem. 

Sulogna Mehta

What is this joy, ringing in the air? 

How does the night sky seem so fair? 

What is this music, singing in my ear? 

Why don?t I find anything to fear? 

The worlds of colours unfurling before me hold 

My dreams, my aspirations shimmering like gold.

The ceaseless cycle of nature, before me, dances ? 

Summer with its fiery heat glances 

Rain tiptoes in its turbulent gush 

Opulent autumn makes the world lush 

Winter creeps and makes desolation rife 

Finally spring comes and renews life. 

But each one lost in themselves dance in glee 

And what is this that I see? 

What is the music that in my ear sings? 

What is the joy that in the air rings? 

The canvas of life is filled with colour, 

Life celebrates its bravery and valour 

My heart cries out now?s today 

?Finally, I?ve discovered life, hurray!? 

Sohini Bhattacharyya,

Class VIII, South Point High School

The World?s End ?

Where the Universe drops ?

Take me there,

And I shall stand on the edge of Creation and Matter

And breathe into 

nothingness,

Feel the strongest of winds

Behind me writhing 

and wrestling

To push my tottering body

Into the vacuum.

To remember nothing.

To think nothing.

To speak to myself

And to the Power;

With storms singing in 

my ears,

And rain splashing in 

my eyes.

A few split moments

To feel no fear? 

All day the mask animates.

Night comes ?

Fatigue and fear and 

apprehension

Kisses it off.

Night comes

With clarity of pain.

I hear my breath whistling around me

As I sit at the centre of 

Nothing,

I hear the breath 

Inside my throat

Strangling me with 

slimy claws.

Pain!

More pain!

The kind that rips the entrails,

Wrenches limbs apart,

Splits the spine,

Digs claws into the mind

Wishing it to explode

So that it would all go away.

Give me that pain

Again

And again.

Adwaita Das,

English, JU (both poems)

Intoxication rules my heart 

when I think of you. 

I meet with myself 

when I look into your eyes. 

You rule my heart, my body, my soul,

The warmth of your breath 

makes me lose my identity. 

Your touch 

transfigures me into a being 

obsessed with love, 

ready to jump into the wide cosmic infinity. 

Joyee Barik, 

Techno India

Trying to masquerade in his vest, 

In the inconceivable sombre night, 

I sometimes wonder how could he so ponder, 

Sometime I wish I could mollify the pain, 

But boy he is so vagrant, 

Made a tiny tenement of his own, 

And proscribe the whole world. 

But I can feel the sorrow of his soul, 

I?ve seen the hollowness and the affliction in his dark wet eyes.

Shubhajit Chakraborty, 

B.Sc Zoology, Indira Gandhi National Open University 

At a frenzied pace;

Trapped images 

Not all the fumes 

Of restless fury can 

efface. 

To dwell 

In a moment?s 

uncertainty, 

Where riotous motions 

Clash and blend, 

And sets the rhythm 

And the rhythm, 

Sets the trend.

Prosen Sinha

Is it a chain of events 

Which when one day ends 

Never comes back again? 

Is life only a dream? 

Does it only seem 

To be what is only an illusion? 

Is life a bed of roses 

Which sometimes causes 

Pain, due to the presence of thorns? 

Is life a game 

Of losing and regaining fame, 

Of bearing with the time, not tame? 

What is life? 

Is it only a question 

That can never be answered; 

Cannot be inferred 

From the clues, we have? 

And is it right 

That life is sometimes bright 

But sometimes as dark 

And scary as an endless night? 

All I know is that 

I have failed 

To solve the puzzle of life. 

Perhaps that is what life is; 

A puzzle, too difficult for me. 

So, I ask for the solution ? 

What is life??

 Mission to mould a million minds 

 Little Detectives: They?re young, but old 

enough to know the difference between right and wrong. These children are the 

next generation of forensic detectives, solving crimes through science. Watch 

them catch the bad guys in the mega serial Four+, on a private Bengali 

television channel. Picture by Aranya Sen

It wasn?t just about having fun for a day. It was 

a week of celebrating the rights of children and making young people understand 

that although they can?t vote, they do have rights. Child Rights Week from November 

14 to 20 was aptly utilised by Saatrangee, a programme jointly organised by UNICEF 

and Prayasam, to make children aware of their rights, identify their priorities 

and learn to take decisions. 

 Marginalised and mainstream children participated in the event, making it a platform for interaction between children of different backgrounds. Conducted by TTIS coordinators Anish Chowdhary, Inam Hussain Mullick, Stuti Agarwal, Anwesha Ghosh, Samaita Ghosh, Sourendra Das and Enakshi at Bharatiyam, it was about improving the quality of life for children. 

 Here are extracts from the diaries of two sisters who witnessed the action: 

 Tuesday, November 16: The day started 

with a quiz on Calcutta, titled Chhoti Si Baat, conducted by Anish and Inam. The 

open-air contest consisted of innovative rounds like Betting, Razor?s Edge, and 

Take Your Pick. The Betting round saw a big fight as a bunch of juniors from Bhavan?s 

challenged their seniors. 

 Thursday, November 18: The previous 

day?s bandh meant all events were postponed by a day. So, Thursday was buzzing 

with activities like the band competition, based on themes chosen keeping the 

global movement for children in mind. 

 This was followed by an interactive session on ?Media Moulds Millions of Minds?. Parallely, the poster and slogan competitions also progressed. The impressive list of judges comprised eminent personalities like Tanmoy Bose, Utpalendu Chowdhury, Subodh Sarkar and Srijato. 

 Friday, November 19: The day 

started early with a rally named Chale Chalo. The walk for child rights started 

from City Centre and ended at Bharatiyam. Posters gleaned from the poster-writing 

contest were utilised in spreading the message and the awareness. The presence 

of Mira Bhattacharjee, wife of the chief minister, also piqued people?s curiosity.

 After the conclusion of the rally, Chhotii Chhotii Sapney, a dance competition, was staged. The event was judged by danseuses Rani Karna and Madhubani Chatterjee. The preliminaries were dominated by Evolution, the choreography performance of the Bhavanites. In the finals, Ahlladi, the dance theatre group of Prayasam, stole the show. 

 Saturday, November 20: On this 

day, ? Child Rights Day ? the first Students Council was formally launched. This 

was followed by an event where we coordinators shared our experiences with TTIS 

on working with Saatrangee. 

 Then, the winners of the dance and band competitions performed their winning sequences. This was followed by distribution of sun shields and certificates. 

 Our tryst with this noble venture concluded with a UNICEF presentation, Bhoomisuta, a dance production on child rights performed by Ahlladi.

Shakespeare special

 The AV room in the department of English at JU is strictly off limits to other students from 3.45 pm everyday, as it harbours what we would like to believe a closely-guarded secret ? rehearsals are in progress for the annual departmental play, our very own version of Shakespeare?s Measure for Measure. 

 The first thing that set us thinking this year was Prof Ananda Lal?s announcement on the first day of practice. There are usually two announcements every year. The customary call is for people wanting to sign up for the play, who are then told about the rigorous rehearsals and the fact that it will mean no holidays, no coming late for practice and a long list of dos and don?ts.

 The rehearsals are held from August, every evening from 3.45 pm and stretching to longer as the show date comes closer, topped off with glasses of steaming lebu cha and long walks back home in the winter evening, sleepy and tired. All are part of college life as usual for most of us in the cast and the crew. 

 However, what made us sit up and take notice was the theme for the audition this year. We were asked to do either a parody or a melodrama. The closer it came to anything resembling Bollywood histrionics, the better. 

 ?Keep the average Hindi movie star in mind when you?re selecting a part,? was the advice . There were rumours and speculations aplenty about what play we were going to do, one of the more adventurous being that it was a musical, a la Bombay Dreams. 

 After auditions ? the highlight of which, by popular consensus, was Debojoy?s parody of Eve and the Fall ? we were told it would be Shakespeare this time. At first, after all our elaborate and rather ambitious speculations, that seemed like a bit of a letdown, not to mention daunting, when we thought of the problems we would have learning and speaking Shakespearean language.

 What seemed even more daunting was the way we were going to be approaching the performance. It seemed plausible when we thought of how the equations of gender during performances in Shakespeare?s time had been so completely reversed. 

 Moreover, the parallels between the text and contemporary society struck us with more immediacy once we began to perform after initial readings. The themes running through the story are very much a part of contemporary society, too, though it has been 400 years since the first performance of the play in 1604.

 Misuse and abuse of power, the nature of power relations (as Angelo, the Duke?s deputy, takes advantage of his authority to seduce Isabella, a young nun, pleading with him for her brother?s life) questions of morality, inefficiency of rulers leading to chaos and anarchy and the question of whether it is better living in anarchy under an inefficient ruler or living in terror under a despot. 

 The last few days of rehearsals are fraught with frayed tempers and strained nerves, as you wonder, among other things, why you still can?t remember lines you?ve been learning since September. It becomes more serious when you realise that for most of the cast and crew, other than the few lucky ones in third-year and MA final year, this is a course for which they?re being evaluated. 

 A normal day at rehearsal would thus consist of our very well-meaning prompter doing her job and chipping in or stopping us in the middle of practically every scene, and actors reacting with at first mild and then increasing annoyance. 

 However, moments of camaraderie abound, especially during costume rehearsals and try-outs, which give us some much-needed comic relief, as do some people?s antics and rather peculiar accents on stage. The first shows, presented by Theatrecian, are on December 9 and 13, at Gyan Manch. Come along for a rather different take on Measure for Measure.

Community service

 The exchange programme between the Belvedere students in Ireland and the Xaverians in Calcutta is aimed at better serving the community. The group of 15 Irish boys, who were recently in town, went to their specified work centres and other charitable institutions to help the under-privileged in any way they could. 

 The Irish teachers also play an integral role in contributing to the success of the programme. Community service is not done simply by giving gifts, but through dedicated service and love, to help bring a smile on the faces of the downtrodden. 

 While the Irish students do their service in Calcutta, a Xaverian group goes to Ireland do the same there. To the under-privileged, a welcoming heart, a receptive ear and a caring mind is all that is needed for a little bit of happiness.

 Fun with a purpose

 In their bid to contribute to a good cause, Loreto College held two events over the past week. The Social Service Society of the college, with the help of Lions Club, organised a blood donation camp in college on November 24. The response and participation of students and others was what made the event a grand success.

 The end of the week brought with it an opportunity for everyone to have some fun, for a good cause, as the college organised its annual open day on November 27. A carnival-like atmosphere prevailed, with the smell of delicious food and the strains of foot-tapping numbers pervading the campus. 

 The first and second years organised the food stalls, with a variety ranging from chowmein and chilli chicken to dhokla, cakes and jhaal muri. 

 The third years, for their part, took charge of the games and music stalls. They also sold second-hand books, which was a very popular move as the prospect of buying books at very reasonable prices attracted everyone. 

 The alumnae, too, had organised games at the Re 1 Stall, which was quite a hit. The Arts and Crafts Society sold handmade products showcasing the talents of the girls in college. 

 Various NGOs were invited to set up stalls for the day to display and sell their goods. These items ranged from greeting cards to stuffed toys and handmade items. This furthered the main cause of the fete, which was to collect funds for the under-privileged.

 French fiesta

 Portuguese Bandel, French Chandernagore, Danish Serampore, Flemish Nawabganj, British Barrackpore and Calcutta. Quite a list of colonial acquisitions on the banks of the Ganges. 

 To raise a toast to the city and its historical European environs, a heritage quiz was organised by Alliance Francaise de Calcutta at Oxford Bookstore on Wednesday. 

 Conducted by Barun Das, it was an open affair, drawing participation from everyone present. A 30-question tester saw a not-so-young Iti Mishra scoring over the rest (she pointed to her silver locks and beamed: ?Heritage?), with young Viraj Prasad as runner-up. 

 Earlier, the curtains went up with Alliance director Nicolas Blasquez and deputy director, cultural affairs, Emmanuelle De Decker, reading extracts from Francoise Sagan. 

 After the literary voyage, came a musical medley. Abhijit Kundu played the synthesiser and Mandira Halder crooned late 19th century composer Gabriel Faure?s song En priere.

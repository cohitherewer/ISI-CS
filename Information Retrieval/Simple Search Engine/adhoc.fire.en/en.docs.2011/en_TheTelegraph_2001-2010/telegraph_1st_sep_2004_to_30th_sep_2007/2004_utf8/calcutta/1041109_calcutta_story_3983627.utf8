The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crossroads of time

 Dada, amar pant-ta hoyechhe to?? Rahul Bose pauses to ask his next-door tailor, before sauntering across the road to reach his children to school. Tagging along is pet dog Jill (a trained black Labrador) while through an upstairs window, Sameera Reddy watches her family melt into the distant.

 Just as the camera starts rolling on the north Calcutta street bustling with rush hour office-goers, the director yells out from behind the monitor: ?Wait! There?s a lot of clutter here.? The next moment, he rushes into the tailor?s shop and adjusts some of the props. The camera rolls once again?

 Five takes stretching over an hour-and-a-half later, Buddhadeb Dasgupta cans the first shot for Kalpurush ? his second venture with Bollywood producer Jhamu Sughand after Swapner Din ? at Bharat Laxmi Studio on Anwar Shah Road on Monday afternoon.

 ?Isn?t Sameera looking just like a Bengali girl. Can you make out any difference? My daughter is helping her pick up Bengali,? says Dasgupta, satisfied with the ?typical middle-class Bangali bou? image his leading lady is sporting. The Bollywood beauty, looking quite at ease in a pink cotton sari and hardly any make-up, has nudged out Bipasha Basu to debut in a parallel film.

 ?I have a very strong role in Musafir which will release soon. From there to an art film is a complete transformation and I want to show what I am capable of. It?s also very encouraging when the director has so much confidence in you,? smiles Sameera.

Her screen-hubby Rahul is no less upbeat about his bit in Kalpurush. ?I am playing the invisible man, an everywhere man, one who doesn?t have any ambition or desires. He is not romantic but has a sense of romanticism. And there?s this unresolved relationship with his father? It?s one of my most favourite characters,? declares Rahul in olive green kurta. His screen father Mithun Chakraborty will join the unit in a couple of days.

 Based on the novel America America that Dasgupta had penned several years ago, Kalpurush focuses on a father-son relationship at the crossroads. ?I needed an intense face like Rahul?s for this character who is a loser. His wife is very ambitious and wants to rise above her modest moorings,? is how Dasgupta describes his leading characters.

 For the next three weeks, the makeshift north Calcutta para is where he will camp with his cast and crew. With the weathered brick-red buildings, rows of sweet shops, watch-repair outlet and tea stalls, the south Calcutta set, created by Mumbai-based designer Samir Chanda, could be anywhere from Bagbazar to Belgachhia.

 ?It?s nice to be back here? I?m very happy with Swapner Din that has received a lot of international acclaim,? sums up Sughand, the man behind Lagaan.

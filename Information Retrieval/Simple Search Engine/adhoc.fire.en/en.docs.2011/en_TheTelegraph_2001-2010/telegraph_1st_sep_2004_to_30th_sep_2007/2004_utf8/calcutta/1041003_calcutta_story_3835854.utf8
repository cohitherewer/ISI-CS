The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 UPS woe and installation ire

 Tapas Chakraborty: I have a Pentium IV HCL Beanstalk 

 machine. I want to take home-based Medical Transcription 

 (MT) assignments after taking Computer Based Test on MT. 

 Is it feasible? What are the options of Internet connection 

 like DIAS (BSNL) and who do I contact? Please give me the 

 details of other types of Internet connections available 

 in Calcutta that are suitable for home based MT job. 

 TechTalk: There are many 

 options available for connecting to the Internet. DIAS from 

 BSNL, as mentioned by you, is one of them. For getting DIAS 

 connection you have to contact Commercial Officer, BSNL 

 of your area. DIAS can be installed using your existing 

 telephone. Internet service providers like VSNL and Sify 

 also offer dial up connection packages for fixed number 

 of hours like 50, 100, 500 and so on. These connections 

 are widely available in a number of outlets in the city. 

 You can choose according to your requirement.

 Pradip Mukherjee: I have a 15-inch LG Monitor, 

 1.7 GHz Intel Processor, Intel Motherboard, 40 GB Hard Disk, 

 128 MB DDR RAM and 500 Volt UPS from Everlite. My UPS makes 

 the backup sound and after sometime it shuts down the whole 

 system although the main power supply is on. It also does 

 not provide backup power when the mains are off.

 TechTalk: You need to check 

 a few things before you can isolate the problem. Is the 

 power cord properly inserted into your UPS? Is there any 

 loose connection in the mains outlet plug point? Is the 

 main voltage supply stable and within the proper range? 

 Extreme low voltage may cause a problem similar to the one 

 you have stated. Does your UPS have the ?Cold Start? feature? 

 This feature enables the UPS to start even when the main 

 power is off. If these points are okay, then there is some 

 problem with the UPS and you need to get it repaired.

 Rakesh Shaw: My PC has the following configuration: 

 40 GB Hard disk, 128 MB RAM, 2.4 GHz Pentium IV processor, 

 original Intel motherboard GVSR 845. Does the processor 

 being Celeron 2.0 GHz or Pentium 2.4 GHz make any difference 

 in the speed of Internet surfing? Also, when I am connected 

 to the Net, sometimes I see that the rate of bytes sent 

 and received is slower compared to other times. Is this 

 a modem problem or something else? 

 TechTalk: Here is a brief 

 comparative study of PIV and Celeron processors: The Celeron 

 and PIV chips have the same core. Celeron chips have less 

 cache memory than Pentium IV chips. It does not have any 

 L1 cache. Cache memory can have a big effect on performance. 

 The PIV chips run at a higher clock speed than Celeron chips. 

 The fastest PIV can be up to 50 per cent faster than the 

 fastest Celeron. There are significant differences in the 

 maximum bus speeds that the processors allow. Pentium IV 

 processors tend to be about 30 percent faster than Celerons. 

 From the comparison it is clear that a PIV and a Celeron 

 chip having same clock speed will have a big difference 

 in performance. This can be felt if you do a complicated 

 mathematical calculation work like graphics rendering.

 However, Internet surfing speed 

 does not depend on whether you have a Celeron or PIV processor 

 because browsing and mailing does not put extra load on 

 the processor.

 Your second problem can occur 

 due to various reasons. These include the condition of your 

 telephone line, ?handshaking? or communicating with the 

 interface of the Internet Service Provider, error correction 

 technology in your modem and so on. 

 Salil Kumar Kundu: My PC is an assembled one 

 with Celeron 2 GHz processor and 256 MB RAM with Windows 

 XP Professional. I have been using Office XP for a long 

 time. Recently, I got Office 2003 installed by a friend. 

 Later, I noticed that I still had Office XP and so uninstalled 

 Office 2003 from Add/Remove Programs. However, after a few 

 days when I tried to re-instal Office 2003, I failed. After 

 keying in the serial number I received the following message: 

 ?Microsoft Office Setup cannot continue because the installation 

 source has been corrupted?. I have even tried uninstalling 

 Office XP but the problem remains.

 TechTalk: It seems that 

 the cause may due to any of the following factors. The CD-ROM 

 drive is not functioning properly or the office 2003 CD 

 is damaged. If the installation CD for Office 2003 you are 

 using is an upgrade version it may cause a problem if you 

 have uninstalled the source software. Another program running 

 on your computer may be interfering with the Office installation.

 To resolve the last one, try to 

 clean boot your machine with the following steps. Click 

 ?Start?, and then ?Run?. 

 Type msconfig in the ?Open? box, 

 and click OK. Click the ?General? tab, and then ?Selective 

 Startup?. Clear the check boxes: Process System.ini file, 

 Process Win.ini file and Load Startup Items.

 Click the ?Services? tab, click 

 to select the ?Hide All Microsoft Services? check box, and 

 then click ?Disable All?. Click OK, and then click Restart. 

 You may try installing Office 2003 now. To restore the computer 

 for a normal startup, run msconfig once again and select 

 Normal Startup from the General tab.

 Md Asique: I recently purchased a PC with PIV-2.6 

 GHz processor, 128 MB DDR RAM, Intel 845GVSR Motherboard, 

 40 GB HDD and 52X CDROM. I want to instal Windows 95 because 

 I have a software that runs only on Win 95. I started installation 

 with a Win 95 bootable floppy. I confi gured Himem.sys in 

 Config.sys, restarted and then ran the Win 95 setup. After 

 copying the files, the computer restarts and shows a message 

 that it?s the first time Windows is running. After only 

 a few seconds, there is a black screen with the message 

 ?While initialising ios, Windows Protection Error, Press 

 Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart your computer?. How can I instal 

 Win 95?

 TechTalk: Windows Protection 

 Error can occur due to different reasons, including virtual 

 driver (VxD) problems, conflicts between real-mode and hardware 

 problems can also be the cause.

 This patch for the AMD K6-2 processor 

 also works for the Intel PIII (1-GHz or faster) and PIV 

 processors. Go to http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads 

 and download ?Windows 95 Update for AMD-K6-2/350? (file 

 name: AMDK6upd.exe).

 When the error occurs (usually 

 on the first boot into Windows 95), or the computer fails 

 to start Windows 95, boot the PC using the bootable 95 floppy. 

 In another PC, extract the files 

 from AMDK6upd.exe to a make a bootable floppy disk. To do 

 this, at the DOS prompt, execute ?AMDK6upd.exe /T:a:\ /C?.

 Manually copy the updated driver 

 files on the diskette to their proper locations as indicated 

 below:

 scsiport.pdr to C:\Windows\ System\IOSubsys 

 disktsd.vxd to C:\Windows\ System\IOSubsys 

 esdi_506.pdr to C:\Windows\ System\IOSubsys 

 hsflop.pdr to C:\Windows\ System\IOSubsys 

 cdfs.vxd to C:\Windows\System\IOSubsys 

 vfbackup.vxd to C:\Windows\System\VMM32 

 ios.vxd to C:\Windows\System\VMM32 

 int13.vxd to C:\Windows\System\VMM32 

 ntkern.vxd to C:\Windows\ System\VMM32 

 Remove the floppy disk and restart 

 the system. If prompted, select Normal Startup. Complete 

 Windows 95 installation. Execute AMDK6upd.exe without any 

 command switches to register the update. The problem should 

 be solved.

 ... and elsewhere in the 

 world

 Apple has reinvented the wheel, 

 again! Looking at the new iMac G5 (picture right shows front 

 and side view), you?ll wonder where the computer is. Everything 

 is neatly tucked away ? unparalleled processor power, massive 

 storage space and every imaginable bell and whistle ? behind 

 the display. Despite that, the rig is incredibly only two-inch 

 thick!

 Tech-specs: Choose either the 

 1.6 GHz or 1.8 GHz processor, both ready to run 64-bit applications. 

 NVIDIA graphics muscle boosts performance of games by even 

 200 per cent compared to the G4. The bundled superdrive 

 packs in a DVD burner that slides gracefully into the display, 

 while wireless-ready does away with cable clutter. Not to 

 forget looks. Even when switched off, you might be tempted 

 to spend hours simply gazing at the G5. Own it for $1299.

 Along with questions, comments and suggestions, write in with 

 your computer-related problems to TechTalk. Be sure to include 

 the configuration of your PC and be specific about the problem.

 Taxi trouble at Howrah station could finally be easing, with the pre-paid counter at the old complex going fully computerised from December 15.

 The move to upgrade the taxi stand ? aimed at boosting passenger comfort and minimising the fleece factor ? was initiated by the 11-member committee, comprising Howrah district magistrate S. Kishore, superintendent of railway police Sunil Mallik and CMDA officials.

 ?It will not only provide a hassle-free taxi-booking process but also save time. For this, we have directed the railway authorities to take all necessary measures,? said Kishore.

 With complaints against the service at Howrah station flooding his department, state tourism minister Dinesh Dakua had formed the committee last month to free cab counters from the clutches of touts and to clean up the delivery mechanism.

 ?We found touts operating freely because of the location of the taxi stand. Initially, we had suggested increasing the width of the stand. But it didn?t work, as there was no extra space,? said one of the committee members. 

 ?We then recommended shifting the pre-paid counter to an abandoned shed owned by the railway authorities close to the new complex,? he added.

 The proposed location, however, was not suitable. ?Had we shifted the pre-paid counter to the shed, passengers would have had to walk quite a distance from railway platforms of the old complex,? said a railway police official.

 The committee has now shelved the shift plans and moved to the computerisation agenda. 

 ?There are four stands in front of both the new and old station complexes. Shifting them is not feasible. So, for now, we are focusing on providing passengers with tout-free, hassle-free services,? said a committee member.

 Railway sources said ?at least 40,000 passengers? hire taxis from Howrah station every day. ?There are 7,000 taxis that roll out of four stands. Computerisation of the pre-paid counter and stricter vigil at the other stand would benefit passengers,? stressed a railway official.

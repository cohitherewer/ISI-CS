 Time to root out tout raj

Basudeb Chowdhury: The system of issuing traffic licence will be upgraded in the district. What will be the benefits? 

 For the first time, we are issuing computerised licences. The licence, commonly known as smart card, will contain all information about the licence holder ? including past offences, if any ? in a chip that will be embedded in the card. 

 In fact, the system will help reduce the tout raj that prevails in almost all regional transport offices. This is a pilot project with aid from the Central government and will set an example in the service standard by providing public utility services. Once our officials get accustomed to the mode of work, we will put up a notice, indicating a timeframe within which applicants will get their licences. 

 Our target is to issue licences to applicants within 48 hours of their submitting the applications. The renewal will also take much lesser time. The migration certificate will be issued instantly as we have already computerised the data regarding all vehicles registered with transport offices. We can know the details of a vehicle only by the click of a mouse and thus save time for issuing licence. Once the service comes into operation, common people cannot be taken for a ride by touts, against whom we get maximum complaints.

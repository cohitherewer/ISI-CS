The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Field day for tiny feet

NISHA LAHIRI

There?s 

no escaping it ? we are on the verge of winter. The air is a little bit chillier, 

it gets dark sooner, the early morning smog is like a musty blanket. But it?s 

nicer to spend time outdoors, go for a walk in the park or a Sunday picnic. What 

better place to bask in the winter weather in Calcutta than on the Maidan? Take 

your toddler for a day out on the greens this weekend. Here are some activities 

that could keep them busy and teach them a few things, too.

Tea party

 It?s the ideal time and place. Take some blankets and a basketful of food and park yourself on the Maidan. To make things a little more interesting, take some bread, cheese and other dry fillings along. Let your child make the sandwiches when he or she is hungry and even pour the drinks in a glass from a bottle or a flask. It?s more fun the do-it-yourself way.

 Another activity that you could try is a doll?s tea party, with little plastic cups and saucers and a doll or two. This one?s for the girls, of course, and they are sure to enjoy playing grown-up. 

Playing ball

 Soft, round, bouncy balls are some of the best toys for kiddies. When it comes to the outdoors, there are no limits to how high, fast or far the ball can be flung. It?s great fun for the little ones. Play catch by throwing it around or just sit and roll it towards each other. It?s a good way to build arm muscles and improve hand-eye co-ordination.

 Or try blowing up balloons. They love watching them being filled up with air. Let the balloons float up and down, so the kids can chase and catch them. Both games involve a good amount of physical exercise.

Game, set?

Play hide-and-seek, using the trees. It?s a sure-fire 

winner, every time. Besides, it will teach them to count. When you go looking 

for them, spend a little time searching before you spot the tot.

 Little ones absolutely love being chased, especially when there are big hugs and kisses at the end. Run around, trying to catch each other, taking turns at letting them be caught and do the chasing. It?s a great way to build stamina. If you spice things up with a bit of variety by pretending to be different animals ? they love loud roaring and shrill sounds ? they learn a lot, too. 

Nature nurture

 Talk a walk ? with a bucket in hand. Collect little things that interest children, be it a stone, leaf, twig or blade of grass. Let them scrutinise the insects, flowers, butterflies and other things, and explain to them what it?s all about. When you return to your picnic spot, let the kids upturn the pail and see what they?ve collected. They?ll enjoy putting each one back in the bucket.

 A more relaxing activity is to spread a blanket and lie down on it. See shapes in the clouds, count the leaves or flowers on a tree or spot the birds. Ask them to close their eyes, keep silent, listen carefully and identify the various sounds, be it a car, a birdcall or the buzz of a bee.

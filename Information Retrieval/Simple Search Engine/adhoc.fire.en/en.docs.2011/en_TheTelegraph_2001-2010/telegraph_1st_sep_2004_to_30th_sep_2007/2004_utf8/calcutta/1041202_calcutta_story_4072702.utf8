Sandip Banerjee, a student of information technology at a private engineering college in south Calcutta, left the institution last month, a year after he joined. He felt the course was too tough.

 Two students of Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) committed suicide in their hostels in a span of two months in the middle of the year. Both of them were suffering from depression.

 Kunal Chatterjee, a hotel management student from Lake Town at a private institution in south Calcutta, hardly attends his practical classes, as he find the exercises ? cooking and learning new recipes ? uninteresting. 

 After city-based English-medium schools started engaging child psychologists to tackle the stress-related problems of students, engineering institutions across Calcutta ? government as well as government-run ones ? are now busy searching for psychologists who can identify the ?mental aberrations? in their students and suggest remedies.

 The move by the engineering institutions comes in the wake of a recent directive from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which makes it compulsory for engineering and management institutions to have facilities for monitoring behavioural problems of students.

 ?Psychological counselling has become an important part of engineering education, particularly in the light of the kind of efficiency that companies are expecting from engineering graduates,? said BESU vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjee. ?The AICTE has taken the right decision. A psychologist is expected to start attending to students from next month,? he added.

 Manoj Mitra, dean of the technology faculty of Jadavpur University, said: ?Once students pass out of engineering courses, most of them are placed in responsible positions in big companies, where they are expected to take a lot of workload and tackle complex situations. We are trying to help the students overcome their weaknesses and build a strong personality.?

 According to AICTE officials, stray cases of student suicide, drop-out and tendency to neglect studies were noticed even in the past. ?We need to ensure that such cases are minimised as much as possible,? an official said.

 According to the officials, this has to be done because at present, big companies don?t like to employ students who have repeated years. 

 Companies may also not like to employ students from institutions where too many incidents of suicide and ragging take place.

 Silajit Ghosh, director, Future Institute of Engineering and Management, a private college in south Calcutta, said: ?We have already engaged a psychologist to attend to our students and we are planning to make counselling a regular affair in our institution.?

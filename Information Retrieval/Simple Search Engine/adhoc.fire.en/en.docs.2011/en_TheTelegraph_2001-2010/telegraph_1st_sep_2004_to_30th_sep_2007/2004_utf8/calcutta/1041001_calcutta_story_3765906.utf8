Model Joy gets a scrunchy makeover for 

her hair from make-up artiste Prabir De

AFRO APPEAL: Joy sports her natural straight 

hair; her hair being tied around the U-pin curlers; the curlers have been taken 

off from one side of the head and the final permed look Pictures by Pabitra Das

Aishwarya Rai made a statement with it in Kyun! 

Ho Gaya Naa? and Preity Zinta flaunted it with elan in Lakshya?

If you want to turn a few heads as you go partying 

this weekend, the scrunched hair is the most fashionable thing to sport.

Whatever be the length of your tresses, a crinkled, 

almost Afro look will help you stand out in the crowd. ?Straight hair is almost 

out, curly hair has been the in thing for quite some time now,? says make-up artiste 

Prabir Kr De.

If you have always gone green staring at model Nayanika 

Chatterjee?s frizzy locks, take heart. Neither do you have to cough up a fortune 

for a perm job, nor do you have to torture your hair with the chemical chaos involved 

in the treatment.

Armed with a U-pin curler, you can achieve the look 

at home with complete ease. You would at best need someone to assist you while 

tying the hair around the pins.

What?s more, with this you don?t have to risk carrying 

off the permed look for months even if you think it?s not suiting you. You can 

wear the curls to a party at night and go to office the next day with perfectly 

straight hair. While the effect lasts for a minimum of 12 hours, if you want to 

undo it before that, you just have to wash it once to get back your normal hair.

De demonstrates the curler effect on model Joy for 

Good Life. ?Joy has medium-length straight hair. It took me 45 minutes 

to give her hair the frizzy look. Usually, it takes around 45 minutes to an hour, 

depending on the volume of the hair,? says De.

Pin-up job

The first step to the scrunch job is applying a hard 

mousse (of any reputed cosmetic brand) evenly on the entire hair. 

Then divide the hair in layers ? the more the number 

of layers the more voluminous the final effect will look. Then take one strand 

of hair at a time and tie it around the U-pin and apply heat for two minutes with 

the heat clips. Do this with the entire hair, starting from the lowest layer and 

working your way up. After that is done, remove the clips and gently open the 

curls with your fingertips.

Sport the look

The Afro-look goes particularly well with Westerns. 

So, do it on a day when you are sure to stay away from ethnic gear. Your make-up 

has to complement the look, too. De recommends a combination of silver and gold 

shadow, with a line of kajal under the eyes. Since this look would be essentially 

for a night party, the lips have to be dark. So, go for one of the midnight hues 

of red, brown or shocking pink. A dab of pink blush-on with some bronzer to top 

it off would complete the effect.

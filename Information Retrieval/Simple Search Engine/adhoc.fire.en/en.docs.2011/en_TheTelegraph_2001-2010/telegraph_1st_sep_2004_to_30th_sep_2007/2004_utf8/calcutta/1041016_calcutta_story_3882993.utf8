The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Now, insurance cover for glasses, lenses

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Itching to splurge on a new pair of glasses for the Pujas? Hesitant because specs are the easiest things to lose? A solution is at hand.

 The Oriental Insurance Company has launched India?s first eyecare insurance scheme in the city. The scheme covers expenditure on all lenses and spectacles, provided they are not cosmetic. 

 Depending upon the quality and the price of the product insured, the scheme ranges between Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000. 

 Oriental Insurance has tied up with leading optical manufacturer and retail outlet group Himalaya Optical for providing the insurance cover to Calcuttans. Plans are afoot to expand it across the country.

 ?We have worked very hard to bring this offer to Calcutta and with the Pujas round the corner, this is, perhaps, our greatest gift for our customers. The insurance company, too, was eager to launch such a unique scheme,? said Shyam Binani, a director of the Himalaya chain.

 The insurance policy will commence with the purchase of spectacles, frames, lens and daily-wear contact lenses. ?Unlike other policies, customers will not have to pay premium. They will only have to pay a first-time processing fee, which will be nominal,? Binani added.

 Oriental Insurance has made it clear that claims will not be entertained in respect of the following:

 Manufacturing 

defects, scratches or damage to plastic frames or daily wear lenses

 Sunglasses 

or other glasses and contact lenses used for cosmetic purposes

 Wear 

and tear damage

 Disposable 

contact lenses.

 To claim the money, all a customer has to do is lodge a complaint with the police if the product is lost or stolen. 

 In case of accidental damage to lenses, a person has to provide details of the circumstances under which the product was damaged. 

 ?Our team of inspectors will verify the claims worth more than Rs 1,500. We will make sure that there is no misuse of the policy,? said a spokesman for Oriental Insurance.

 To ensure that the claim is acknowledged by the insurance company, the claimants will have to provide a photocopy of the cash memo, certificate of insurance and FIR (if required). 

 They have also been advised to submit copies of any other relevant documents that will help the company settle the claim early.

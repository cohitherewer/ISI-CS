The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lesson from the heart of Sunderbans

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 Fear and superstition lurk at every corner in the Sunderbans. A Telegraph picture 

 For years, they had been used to clones of Kumar Sanu and Lata Mangeshkar at night-long para functions. So for the masses at Mograhat near Sunderbans, the recent performance of Bonbibir Pala came as a welcome change. 

 A first-of-its kind production that both entertained and educated them, the theatre included in its cast many amateur performers from neighbouring areas for whom going up on stage had meant shedding years of conservatism. 

 A joint effort of Surbahar, a Calcutta-based organisation and Mohana, a Mograhat initiative, the production based on the characters of Bonbibi, a Sunderban goddess, and Dakshin Ray, the legendary tiger-god, sought to merge age-old folklore of the Sunderbans with the present social scenario.

 Sunil Saha, the director of Bonbibir Pala, told Metro: ?We had been trying for years to revive, restore and rejuvenate lost folklore and artistic traditions of rural areas and also help the backward people there to come to terms with ways of life today. Through our production last week, we were able to showcase the latent creativity in people from remote corners of South 24-Parganas as well as spread messages of peace, tolerance, importance of education and the futility of superstitions.?

 For example, Dakshin Ray, whose present-day avatar shows him with bow and arrows and a gun, wearing a sacred thread, has been cast in the mould of a Hindu fanatic while the historical character of Bonbibi?s brother from Mecca, Shahjanguli, has been portrayed as an Islamic fundamentalist. Bonbibi, who is worshipped by both Hindus and Muslims in the Sunderbans, is the sobering influence on the two extremists. 

 ?Apart from the message of religious tolerance, we wove elements of education into Bonbibir Pala as well. We showed a sequence where a mother brings her ailing child to be blessed by Bonbibi, who tells the mother to take him to a doctor and not rely on her for cure,? explains Saha. In a pitch against polygamy, Dakshin Ray says he cannot marry another woman while retaining his wife. His confession that he, as the local kabiraj, was a quack with no proper training, is also loaded with significance for the rural audience.

 The group had to fight conservatism every step of the way. ?Take Baishakhi Sarkar, who plays Bonbibi. Though she is an MA student of Rabindra Bharati University, it took a lot of convincing before her father let her participate. There were many who had never been on stage before and some who succumbed to stage fright during the rehearsals and left,? said Saha. 

 Pankaj Ghosh, a small-time businessman in Mograhat who plays Dakshin Ray, said: ?It was an amazing experience. We learnt the techniques of theatre. It also opened our minds because the topic was at once close to our hearts and relevant to what is happening beyond the narrow confines of our homes.? 

 Plans are afoot to take the production to other places with the help of the Sunderbans Development Corporation.

They came from far and wide ? Barasat to Barisha to Bandel, Liluah to Sodepur to Chandernagore. And, of course, from all over Calcutta.

 Dressed to the hilt, these guys and girls had one thing in mind: we just wanna have fun. Party hard the TTIS (The Telegraph in Schools) tigers did, and how. The place was a bowling alley, with 400 party animals rocking to the rhythm.

 But first, the solemn reason for the celebration ? to pat the best TTIS reporters on the back and to induct, for the first time, TTIS student executives who would be brand ambassadors and the management behind the editorial scenes.

 Stuti Agarwal from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and the inseparable duo of Jayeeta Sil and Anushree Gupta of Hariyana Vidya Mandir received Reporter of the Year awards. Anwesha Ghosh from Our Lady Queen of the Missions School and Samantak Bhadra from Don Bosco got Tiger of the Year certificates. Then, the student executive badges were handed out and the party officially kicked off.

 The venue was Sparkz, the entertainment centre on Diamond Harbour Road. The drinks were sponsored by Coca Cola and the food by Don Giovanni?s. But most of the energy was concentrated on the bumper car area-turned-dance floor, which took all of five minutes to fill up once the DJ started spinning out the tracks.

 The sporty kind seemed perfectly at home in the bowling alleys, especially once the flashing lights and neon signs came on with glow-in-the-dark designs all around.

 But most were not willing to give the music a miss. Dhoom to Coco Jumbo, they danced like there was no tomorrow.

With Barry ?sir? (Barry O?Brien) judging the dancers, 

there were quite a few prizes being handed out. Jayeeta Sil impressed with her 

moves, and Swagoto Mullick bagged another free Dandiya ticket, although he seemed 

to have lost his partner.

 Priyanka Gupta from Chowringhee High School also caught the judge?s eye with some smart moves.

 And the stage seemed just right for glimpses of puppy love ? or maybe cub romance. While one young couple stood quietly in a corner romancing a staircase, Anupam Gupta from Nopany Vidyalaya and Udita Nag from St Joseph?s Chandernagore hogged the spotlight on the dance floor.

 There was some fancy gymnastics from the boys, but the girls, especially those from Chandernagore, were the stars, mini skirts, sparkling jeans and all.

 though it was strictly no parents, the few who made it inside seemed to be in a state of shock and awe.

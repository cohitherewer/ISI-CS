The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Breather for fair venue

 - Court modifies stay on Bypass plot as proposed mela spot

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The state government heaved a sigh of relief on Friday after Calcutta High Court modified its order of last month, staying the development of land along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass into a fairground. 

 The government pleaded with the court that it be allowed to proceed with the fairground barring a small plot, which was still disputed. 

 The stay on developing the proposed fairground had followed a petition by Niyoti Neogi and two others, who alleged that the government was developing a vast tract at Hatgachhia, on Dhapa Road, for the proposed fairground, in which two cottahs were owned by them. 

 ?We bought the plot in 1985 and have valid documents,? they claimed.

 Justice G.C. Gupta had in August passed an interim order restraining the government from proceeding with the development of the ground.

 On Friday, however, advocate-general Balai Ray, along with additional government pleader Debasish Kar Gupta, moved the court of Justice Gupta and said: ?The interim order is putting the government in a fix. The state will suffer a massive loss if it is not allowed to hold the proposed commerce fair on the ground in November this year.?

 Ray pointed out that a division bench of the same court had in 1973 awarded the land to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and accordingly, the CMC holds possession of the tract. ?So, the petitioners? claim is not true,? he added.

 ?This court had directed the government not to allow anyone to organise fairs on the grounds adjacent to Victoria Memorial Hall. So, the government had to undertake a scheme for developing the land to shift the venue of the fairs,? Ray reminded the court.

 Justice Gupta modified the interim order and asked the government, the CMC and the petitioners to sit together on Monday and identify the plot in question. ?If the land of the petitioners is identified, the government will have the liberty to progress with the work,? the judge said.

 A division bench had ordered the government not to allow any organisation to hold fairs on the grounds adjacent to Victoria Memorial from April 14, 2004. The government, accordingly, selected a plot on the Bypass as an alternative fair venue and proceeded to develop it. 

 But, a month ago, when the state public works department went to take possession of the plot, a group of settlers demanded substitute shelter.

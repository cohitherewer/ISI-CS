 The old order has struck back, this Christmas, on Park Street. If live music has been rocking Trincas almost like it used to in the Sixties, the breakfast table is back where it belongs ?18 Park Street.

 After a never-ending three-and-a-half-month interim, Flurys made a comeback on Wednesday with a new look, a new (and bigger) menu but at least some of its old charm in place.

 What strikes you first about Flurys of the future are the bright lights and vibrant colours. The musty smell and the grey look have given way to a European caf? of the 90s, dominated by browns and pinks.

 ?It?s not that Flurys has never been renovated in the past,? says Vijay Dewan, managing director of the Park Hotels.

 ?When we took over the shop in 1965, we gave it a facelift straightaway. Then again, in the early 1990s, we gave Flurys another facelift. But yes, this has been the most major renovation of the confectionery. We spent around Rs 3 crore to rebuild the shop and also the factory,? adds Dewan.

 Then there?s the new menu, whipped up by Shaun Kenworthy. ?Ever since I joined The Park, this was always meant to be my baby,? smiles the chef, who recently married model Pinky. ?For the first eight years of my career, these fingers just played around with chocolate and breads. And now I can try them out here.?

 A lot of old products with some new ones, is how Shaun describes the present product mix. So, alongside old favourite Cheese Quiche, you have the Chicken Chettinad Patty. 

 The marriage of old and new is also the mantra when it comes to service. Says Dewan: ?We want to retain the old-world charm Flurys is known for and yet keep pace with the times. So, while we have got a lot of fresh blood, we have kept our old staff and put them through fresh training. They know the old customers and they know Flurys better than many of us.?

 Hemmed in by Barista and Caf? Coffee Day, the timing has been stretched from 7 in the morning to 10 in the night. 

 ?While the highlight is still on the breakfast menu, we have introduced a few main course dishes, like Fried Fish and Curry with Rice,? says Shaun.

 And, Flurys will finally have a refrigerator! With a host of desserts on the menu, this landmark teashop will, for the first time, serve fresh cream variety, unlike before when there was ?only butter cream stuff with no refrigeration?, reveals the star chef.

 Add to that a swank counter for cakes, plans to use imported chocolate for the sweet bakes and a range of innovative breads, and you?ll find Flurys stepping into the competitive cake-shop fray.

 Beyond the munch menu, a lot of theme-based events are being lined up to make the Park Street address a happy hangout. ?We want to re-establish the Flurys brand name and bring a new energy to the zone,? says Dewan.

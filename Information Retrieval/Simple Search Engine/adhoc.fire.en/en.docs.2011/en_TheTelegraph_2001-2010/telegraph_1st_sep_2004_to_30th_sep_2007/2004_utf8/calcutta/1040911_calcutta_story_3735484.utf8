The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Raving about the radio

Zeeshan Jawed finds out what it 

takes to be an RJ, from the breakfast show to the late night wrap up

If you were often punished in class for talking non-stop 

with your friends and chatterbox was your second name, take heart. With 24-hour 

private FM channels hitting the airwaves, a lucrative career may be beckoning 

you. 

Radio jockeying (or radio announcing) is fast becoming 

one of the most sought after careers, with the bait of seemingly easy money and 

the glamour it is associated with.

Make the grade

The essentials in this profession are totally different 

from run-of-the-mill corporate jobs. A radio jockey need not be academically or 

professionally qualified to take control of the console.

?Given a choice between a professionally-trained candidate 

and a novice with good skills, I will go for the amateur whom I can mould according 

to the style of my station,? says Jimmy Tangree, station head, 93.5 Red FM. 

The basic prerequisite is good language skills ? preferably 

knowledge of the regional tongue and English at least. A grasp of the city you 

are in is also a plus point.

Cool confidence

It?s very common to make mistakes on live radio but 

the trick is to cover them up on the spot, preferably before too many people figure 

it out. But doing so requires a huge amount of presence of mind and loads of confidence. 

Do not get panicky if you make a faux pas or it will only make things worse, causing 

further slips.

Are you wit it?

Rib-tickling repartee and spicy anecdotes are essential 

for an engaging, good script. While bringing a smile to somebody?s face may seem 

like a laugh, it can prove to be the most difficult thing. But watch out: your 

jokes should be in good taste and good humour, to avoid unnecessarily antagonising 

anybody.

Script your fortunes

The flow of fresh ideas is essential. You might have 

an absorbing voice but if people can?t make head or tail of what you are saying, 

chances are you won?t be able to hold the interest of the audience for long. 

According to the experts, listening to a lot of radio 

helps to determine the pulse of listeners and will show the direction in which 

your script should be heading.

Nights out

The job of a radio jockey is hardly a bed of roses. 

It comes with its own share of strain and anxiety. ?If you are doing a breakfast 

show, you have to be up at the crack of dawn and in the studio well before the 

programme starts. You have to hang around after the show is over to prepare for 

the next day?s line-up. It leaves you with no time to yourself at all,? laments 

Rai Sengupta, host of a breakfast show on 107.8 FM. 

She would previously host a live programme that started 

at midnight and continued till 6 in the morning. So if you had plans of wrapping 

up a show in four hours after college, give it a second thought.

Info appeal

Having an ear for current affairs ? and incorporating 

the same in your scripts ? saves your show from the standard Bollywood kind of 

feel. Radio has a wide reach, and you are never sure who is tuning in on the other 

side. It could be a young executive on the way to work, a student at home after 

school, a housewife or a taxi driver. So, best to keep your content as varied 

and universally appealing as possible.

Physical strain

While you are busy chattering into the microphone, 

keep a check on your health too. Sitting in one place for too long can cause a 

number of posture problems. It can be quite stressful as well. A regular visit 

to the family physician may not be a bad defence mechanism against more serious 

concerns.

Talk your way to the bank

The money is good if you are worth your salt. A beginner 

can start from anywhere between Rs 7,000 and Rs 10,000, with the maximum hovering 

around Rs 1 lakh for a seasoned jockey. The price tag not only depends on how 

good the jockey is but also on his or her market value. If advertisers want their 

messages aired during your show, the station will not mind giving you your due.

Side kick

If you are lucky, you could balance the job and still 

do what you love. ?I joined radio primarily for the money it brings. But as time 

passed, I realised I had what it takes to make a good radio jockey. I started 

coming up with ideas and cracking jokes with ease on air. And now I do not regret 

my decision,? explains Moushumi Saha, a radio jockey with Red FM. It also allowed 

her to spend time with her first love: music. ?I trained as a classic singer and 

I have not given up on singing. And I also get the chance to anchor musical shows.?

In the public eye

The guy with the most strenuous job could well be 

the outdoor broadcaster. Most radio stations have a live traffic update segment. 

Reporters have to give real-time feedback from the busiest crossings of the city. 

They usually commute on two-wheelers and communicate over mobile phones. 

?Our worst enemy is the weather. Sometimes parking 

becomes a huge problem, too,? feels Khalid Ashraf, outdoor broadcaster with Red 

FM. But on the bright side, they are the real public faces of the station. If 

they strike the right chord, people often dedicate songs to them as well!

Fan following

Jockeys have become household names thanks to the 

airtime they get and the intimate nature of the shows. ?One fan of mine calls 

me up whenever anything important happens in her life. I have never met her, yet 

she feels I am her confidante,? smiles Rai of 107.8 FM.

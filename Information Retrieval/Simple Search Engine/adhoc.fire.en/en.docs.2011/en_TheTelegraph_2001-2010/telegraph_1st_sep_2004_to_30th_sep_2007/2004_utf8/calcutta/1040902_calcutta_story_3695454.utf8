When 13-year-old Animesh was detected to be a diabetic, the teenager and his family plunged into depression. Following a bout of treatment, the blood sugar level was brought under control. But the doctor ignored the mental illness, which plagued Animesh for 10 more years. 

 Cases such as this have prompted health experts to take a fresh look at the way the psychological effect of any disease is ignored by doctors, giving rise to the number of mentally ill patients in almost every homes in Calcutta.

 The Disability Census report has nailed West Bengal as having the maximum people with mental illnesses in the country (14.66 per cent, against the national average of 10.33.) 

 Now, the Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) has set about finding out the exact number of such patients in the city and the districts.

 The survey will classify the patients based on their gender and age, and will analyse the illness they are suffering from.

 Starting October, the IPS will also organise orientation programmes for general physicians, to make them realise the necessity of taking into account co-morbid factors such as mental illness whenever they treat any patient.

 Its a fact that certain diseases bring about an underlying mental illness. Both the disease and the mental illness have to be tackled simultaneously. For, the goal of any treatment is to cure the patients body as well as mind, said Subhankar Choudhury, endocrinologist and vice-president of the Bengal chapter of the Diabetic Association of India.

 Choudhury has come across several diabetics who had to be given extensive counselling. 

 Apart from diabetes, ailments such as respiratory diseases and medicines like steroids and other anti-psychotic drugs induce mental illness in patients. 

 The illness refuses to go long after the original malady has been cured. Theres no way to tell how many such cases are out there, completely ignored by doctors. Thats why we are undertaking the twin programme of a study as well as orientation programmes for doctors, said R. Ghosh Roy, IPS president in Calcutta.

 Experienced medical practitioners are unanimous that most patients are in need of counselling. Even a chronic back pain can cause depression, which, if untreated, can give rise to severe problems, said Susovan Halder, an expert in respiratory diseases.

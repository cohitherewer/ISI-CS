Lzone: Cocoon

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

The riot of orange on the second floor of Centre Point 

building on Shakespeare Sarani is sure to have caught your eye. Shop windows with 

curious pieces of home d?cor bedeck the otherwise pedestrian building.

In case you hadn?t noticed, this is Cocoon, a store 

housing the latest in stylish furniture and home accessories (pictures by Pabitra 

Das). 

Started by husband-wife duo Sheena and Ajay Rawla 

and their furniture exporter partner Jayjit Sen, this spacious 3,000-sq-ft store 

houses furniture claiming to be ?heirloom pieces with a contemporary touch?.

?A cocoon is the transitional phase where a caterpillar 

transforms into a beautiful butterfly. That?s the role we want to play in the 

city?s furniture business,? smiles Ajay, who has conceptualised the new offering.

Creating a cosy ambience in such a sprawling space 

was a challenge. ?I wanted to give the place a homely touch, so we have these 

small corners where people can sit and take their time to decide. That?s also 

why we decided to do away with customer assistants who would breathe down your 

neck pushing you to buy a piece,? says Sheena, who has designed the store in the 

theme colours of the rainbow. 

Furniture

The furniture is not period and neither is it overtly 

modern. All the pieces you find here, from a small side-table and mirror to a 

king-size bed, are made from solid brown wood. The craftsmanship essentially draws 

on traditional India, inspired by designs from all over the country. 

A wooden chest in old Rajasthani style and another 

chest of wooden drawers with iron trellises are some of the interesting pieces 

one can find here.

?A lot of the furniture has been restored and re-done. 

Some are in fact heirloom pieces,? says Sen. While most of the furniture is heavy 

and ornate, one can also find a few light pieces. Intricate carvings mark most 

of the stock but there are others that stand out due to their stark minimalist 

look.

?We don?t want to brand ourselves as selling any one 

type of furniture. We would like to cater to different tastes so everyone can 

find something to add value to their home,? stresses Sheena.

Accessories

Rugs, cushions, lampshades, drapes, clocks, baskets, 

coasters, water fountains and a lot more add-ons can be found here to enhance 

any home. ?The idea is to help people pick up small things that can change the 

way their rooms look without having to spend a fortune on a makeover,? said Sheena.

From bamboo to linen, coloured glass to ceramic, the 

lampshades come in various forms and colours. A range of wooden-look metal marine 

clocks catch the eye and can make good gifts.

Add-on

The lifestyle store also hopes to break out of its 

furniture cocoon. ?This is a platform where we want people with expertise in the 

fusion forms of art and music to converge,? says Ajay, who wants to turn the shop 

into a hub of cultural activity, along with a coffee corner and, of course, great 

buys.

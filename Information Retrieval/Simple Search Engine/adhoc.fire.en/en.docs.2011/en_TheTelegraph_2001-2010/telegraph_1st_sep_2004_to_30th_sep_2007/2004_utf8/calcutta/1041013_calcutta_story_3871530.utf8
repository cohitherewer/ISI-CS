 A bouquet of the many Englishes

 When English became a part of the curriculum of Bengali schools in the 19th Century, children were expected to cram couplets that were a delightful though, in retrospect, outlandish cocktail of Bengali and English ? almost like some publicity material we see in newspapers and signage. Though we may snigger at such wrong-headed experimentation, linguist David Crystal, who gave a lecture on the many Englishes organised by the British Council on Monday evening, would welcome such diversity as it helps languages grow and, thereby, nurtures respect for diverse ethnicities.

 One of the world?s foremost authorities on reference publishing and language, Crystal is on his first visit to India.

 As was evident at the lecture, he is as consummate a performer as his Hollywood namesake. Crystal is anything but a purist. Not for him a cut-glass accent or Queen?s English. He is all for bricolage of Englishes, flavoured with local tongues. He stressed that only two per cent of the world speaks standard English, and only those who cannot forget the Empire will spare a thought for niceties such as received pronunciation.

 India has a special relationship with English because of its ?recent historical connections? with the UK. It is being taught in Chinese schools as it gets ready for the Olympics. A new factor is the arrival of Australian English, with its high rising intonation. However, he admitted that English is the ?great marginaliser?. To allow local tongues to survive, people themselves must want the language to grow. The government should pass sympathetic laws.

 Though it is expensive to protect minority languages, he maintained that it is a ?short-term? expense. Or else, violent language movements as in Bangladesh, Brussels or Quebec happen.

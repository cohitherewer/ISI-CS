The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Disbelief, a dose of Left-bash

 OUR BUREAU

 Disbelief to surprise to muted criticism of the government the range of reactions to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) report terming Calcutta a plum spot for human traffickers.

 We havent seen the report, but it seems an issue that needs to be addressed by the government, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said on Tuesday.

 At this point, remedial measures depend on the administration. We have no comment to offer on whether we should pit the party network against the traffickers, but, theoretically speaking, we will not hesitate to look at the option if the situation warrants it, he added.

 The Trinamul Congress seized the statistics as a stick to beat the ruling coalition with. MLA Partha Chatterjee, who has often raised the issue of human trafficking from Bengal through Calcutta in the Assembly, said: Given the stranglehold of the Left, the traffickers could not have flourished without support from sections of local politicians or police.

 According to a report before the state home department, nearly 10,000 minor boys and girls (in the 7-18 age group), gathered from different districts, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal are taken through Calcutta to various parts of India and abroad. Approximately 3,000 are girls, who almost always end up in red-light districts, whereas the boys are forced into labour or get sucked into the underworld.

 The incidence of trafficking is alarmingly high in districts like Murshidabad, South and North 24-Parganas. We are trying to spread awareness among the poor and uneducated, said P.K. Agarwal, principal secretary, social welfare department.

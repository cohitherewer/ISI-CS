The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta on canvas

 The very mention of the city of Calcutta conjures up an abundance of kaleidoscopic images in our minds: from the chaste waters of the Ganga to the ramshackle pavement slums, the vast expanse of the Maidan to the perennial traffic jams, the spanking new flyovers to the interminable power-cuts, and the spectacular highrises to the humble ragpickers and rickshaw pullers. As a tribute to this city, which ushers the modern while conserving its heritage, nourishing as well as demolishing our joys and sorrows, hopes and fears, Mukta Shilpa hosts Contemporary Kolkata through Contemporary Art, an exhibition of paintings by eminent artists in whose minds the city has left an indelible impression. Featuring the many-hued splendour and grandeur of Calcutta in the works of Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Prakash Karmakar, Dwijen Gupta and Sanatan Dinda, among others, alongside its poverty and squalor in the works of Wasim Kapoor, Jogen Chowdhury, Pradip Maitra and Ashit Paul (whose Phuchkawala appears above), among others, the paintings effectively capture the myriad moods of a bustling metropolis. Curator: Ratnottama Sengupta.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings on contemporary Calcutta

 When: Till December 18, 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Academy of Fine Arts

Heal, hands and heels 

SHIP SHAPE

With the winter chill setting in, your 

fingers and feet need to be cared for much more than usual. Ipsita Deb 

draws up a regimen

Nothing can mar a pair of long, shapely legs like 

a couple of dry, cracked feet at the end of them. But while women spend much time 

making the rest of their bodies look as pretty as possible, these most overburdened 

extremities are usually the worst neglected. Hands too, are usually not given 

more than a cursory file and polish.

But with the chill coming into the Calcutta air rather 

early this year, and the moisture being driven out, this is the harshest time 

on hands and feet. Before you venture out in your latest pair of strappy, toe-revealing 

heels, make sure you give these long-suffering feet their due.

Your hands and feet deserve to be far more valued 

than they are at present. Not only are they invaluable to our daily functioning 

? as even the most innocuous shoe bite will remind us, rather rudely ? but they 

remain faithful through thick and thin. Even when we put on weight, other parts 

of the body laugh at us mercilessly with tyres of flab, but these remain largely 

unchanged.

Manicure must

?Women look after their face and hair so much but 

tend to neglect their hands and feet. For me, hands are the ideal expressive tools 

for any woman. Without proper care for these, your beauty will always be incomplete,? 

rues therapist Darshini Sanghvi.

Even those without the time for spa or salon treatments 

can take out about five minutes from their busy schedule to pay some attention 

to those poor, neglected hands. To make them look pretty as well as well-kept, 

start with a basic manicure.

It takes about 15 minutes if done at home, and once 

a week is quite enough. You will need a manicure set, available at most major 

cosmetics stores. Start by soaking your hands in warm water. Trim the cuticles 

with the cuticle cutter. Cut, file and polish the nails. After that, all you need 

to do is gently massage in a little natural oil to keep them moisturised. If you 

don?t trust yourself with pointy, sharp instruments, a salon can do the deed and 

it really does not cost the earth. The frequency for salon manicures can be much 

less than the home treatment.

If you go the professional way, you can get far more 

elaborate than a simple manicure. Like at Ma Pui salon, where nail art, nail extensions, 

normal and special platinum manicures, and even an exclusive bridal manicure, 

are available. Priced between Rs 130 and Rs 350, these use reflexology massage 

techniques, virgin aroma magic bath salts, tan-removing solutions to soothe, nourish 

and beautify the hands and the arms.

The Taj Bengal salon has a spa treatment that comes 

for Rs 400, using Mineral Line dead sea salts and olive oil, followed by a mud 

pack that is applied to the whole arm to soften and remove the tan and a soothing 

massage to complete the process.

?Mud and salts have great value and no side effects. 

They are both rich in minerals and devoid of chemicals, lending that perfect nourishment 

to the skin,? says salon manager Saira Ali.

Crack care

Two of the most common problems faced by hands are 

chapping and cracking, striking mainly in winter, and those who do a lot of heavy 

work outdoors or household chores. Petroleum jelly can do the trick to revitalise 

them, while non-soap cleansers or mashed potatoes (yes!) work wonders for cracked 

surfaces.

White spots on the nail are another common dilemma 

caused by applying too much pressure on the nail matrix. Unfortunately, the best 

? and perhaps the only ? solution is letting these spots grow out.

Foot fetish

According to Chinese folklore, Sung dynasty prince 

Li Yu had a fetish for tiny feet and made his concubine dance the toe dance with 

bound feet. While the practice of foot binding, which has continued for hundreds 

of years thereafter, may seem cruel and inhuman, high-heels are not much better 

for the punishing effects they have.

Forget cosmetic trouble, you could end up with some 

serious medical problems by constantly wearing very high heels. But to take care 

of the surface issues, a pedicure is the most common and relaxing process to keep 

them pretty.

June Tomkyns has three specific foot treatments. A 

simple pedicure to remove the dead skin followed by accupressure to relieve stress 

and other medical problems, a Mineral Line pedicure that involves dead sea salts 

and exfoliation and an in-house aroma oil foot bath that softens skin and gives 

moisture and shine. All these are priced between Rs 280 and Rs 350.

The Sunny Park spa Solace uses massage as an important 

tool during a pedicure. ?Foot care is very important as our feet take a great 

amount of our body weight. Without proper relaxation, the body will always remain 

in a state of fatigue,? stresses manager Rutu Tawade.

Toe woe

Feet can develop a number of problems if not taken 

care of. Foot calluses or thickening of the outer layer of the skin is common 

and can develop from prolonged rubbing and pressure. The ideal solution is to 

rub them with a pumice stone and to avoid wearing high-heel or restrictive shoes 

(unless you are pulling out all the stops).

Ingrown nails are common, and painful, to the toes. 

Improper nail trimming, tight shoes, or poor posture often cause a corner of the 

nail to curve downward into the skin. These are both painful and sometimes even 

infectious. For this, seek professional help.

 Neglect cloud on jail warder

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Three days after Babulal Sharma, one of a dozen prime accused in the murder of former Dum Dum municipality chairman Sailen Das, died in Dum Dum Central Jail following a fall in the bathroom, warder Debashish Ghosh was showcaused on Friday for dereliction of duty.

 Sharma, while walking down a steep flight of stairs from the bathroom attached to his ward No. 12 around 11.20 pm on Tuesday, fell and wounded his head. Profusely bleeding, he was shifted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

 Though the post-mortem report revealed that there was no foul play, senior jail officials found warder Ghosh guilty of negligence. ?Ghosh was on duty in the ward where Sharma was lodged and he should have informed the jail authorities when the accused slipped and was injured while walking down the stairs of the bathroom,? said deputy inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya.

 Bhattacharya, who has been asked to probe the death and submit a report to inspector-general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty, said he had found ?gross negligence on the part of the warder concerned?. 

 He added that Ghosh did not inform the jail authorities when Sharma slipped and fell down the bathroom stairs. 

 ?If the jail authorities had come to know of Sharma?s fall immediately after it happened, we could have rushed him to hospital. There was some delay in getting the information from the warder on duty,? said a jail official. He said some more warders are being questioned.

 Jail sources confirmed that a few days before his death, Sharma was injured in a brawl with some other inmates of the ward. 

 Officials complained that the public works department (PWD), which is supposed to repair the jail bathroom on a regular basis, did not carry out any maintenance work for several months. 

 ?Leave alone bathrooms, most of the wards and cells in the jail are in a dilapidated condition. The PWD turns a blind eye to this problem despite several reminders,? an official informed. 

 In a related development, retired justice Shyamal Sen, chairman of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission, said during the day that he had written to North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar, asking for all documents relating to the post-mortem and magisterial inquest of the deceased. 

 ?We have taken strong exception to the spurt in deaths in jails and police station lock-ups. This has to be stopped,? he said. 

 The rights panel, he added, will conduct an independent probe by sending its team to the jail ?if we are not satisfied with the investigation by jail officials?.

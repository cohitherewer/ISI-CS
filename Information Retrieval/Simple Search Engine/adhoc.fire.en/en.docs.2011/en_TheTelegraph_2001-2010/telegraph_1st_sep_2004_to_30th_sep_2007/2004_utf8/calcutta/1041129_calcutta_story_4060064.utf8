To ensure better service to satellite townships and reduce congestion on city roads, the state government is prodding taxis to spread out of Calcutta and ply even in the metropolitan area. 

 In a recent directive, the transport department has made it mandatory for all taxis to seek permits for Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA). 

 The permit will enable them to ply in North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and parts of Nadia, in addition to the city. 

 ?We?re issuing CMA permits to the new taxis. We are also ensuring that old taxis are only offered CMA permits at the time of renewal,? said a transport department official. 

 Till very recently, taxis painted black and yellow could ply only within the city, while yellow cabs were authorised to ply in the wider CMA area. 

 ?The wider area of operation will be more convenient for passengers, who can now take taxis to more destinations. Taxis of different colour schemes and plying on two routes were proving inconvenient and confusing for both tourists as well as Calcuttans,? said joint secretary (transport) and PVD director H. Mohan. 

 ?This will also help us prosecute taxi refusal cases, which we couldn?t do earlier, since many cabbies didn?t have permits to ply in CMA,? he added.

 This will effectively mean that passengers wanting to go to far-off places, like Baruipur, Diamond Harbour, Narendrapur, Rajarhat, Sonarpur or even Salt Lake, are more likely to find a cab willing to take them there. 

 About 31,000 taxis ply every day in West Bengal, of which about 23,000 have CMA permits; the rest ply within city limits. However, after the government directive, most of the taxis ? between 26,000 to 28,000 ? will be issued CMA permits in a few months. 

 ?Since taxis have to be in good condition to ply to far-off places like Kalyani, the vehicles will have to be maintained well. Old and unfit vehicles will, thus, go off the road, improving the quality of transport services,? an official said.

 The state has added about 10,000 to 12,000 new taxis to the fleet in the past five years, while most of the yellow-and-black cabs plying in Calcutta are unfit for the road. 

 Taxi associations, however, are not happy with the development.

 ?Plying taxis outside Calcutta is not feasible, since people outside the city tend to opt for cheaper means of transport, like Trekkers. This is why most taxis having CMA permits ply within the city, ? said Madan Mitra of the Progressive Taximen?s Union. He added: ?This is just the government?s way of earning more revenue.?

 According to Bimal Guha of Bengal Taxi Association, even if they are given a permit, most cabbies will not leave Calcutta after dark because of safety concerns.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Star shower for newly weds

Nilanjanaa and Jisshu Sengupta hosted their 

wedding reception at the open-air Queens Court in Swabhumi on Monday. Almost 

the whole of Tollywood dropped in to congratulate the star couple. The Goodlife 

captured some moments from the special evening. Pictures by Rashbehari Das

The three-tier chocolate cake (baked by the owners of Coffee 

Pai, who also did the catering for the evening) had white icing and pink sugar 

roses on it. The cake-cutting ceremony at around 9 pm added a western touch to 

the ethnic ambience. The fusion was much like bride Nilanjanaa?s outfit, a heavily 

embroidered choli with a straight skirt-like ghagra made of a blue 

mekhla. The couple is flanked by Nilanjanaa?s parents, sister Chandana 

and Jisshu?s mother

June was undoubtedly one of the brightest stars of the evening. 

Wearing a white kurta and Patialia-style salwar in bright pink, 

she completed her look with a colourful patchwork jhola and a shawl 

Koel came with her parents and decided to stick to them for 

the rest of the evening. Dressed in electric blue-and-yellow sequinned sari, she 

greeted the couple with a smile, papa Ranjit Mullick by her side

Dressed in a black tweed coat, black stretch trousers and printed 

red tie, actor Jeet dropped his star demeanour mixing freely with the non-filmi 

guests. Prosenjit took time off from playing host for the evening to pose with 

the young hero

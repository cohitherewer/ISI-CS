 Junior doctors lock up nurse on duty 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A nurse was gheraoed by some junior doctors for several hours on Wednesday for protesting their messing up a ward at NRS Medical College and Hospital. 

 The junior doctors allegedly misbehaved with the nurse in-charge and kept her confined in her room all day.

 Tuhinika Sengupta, nurse in-charge of block C of the medical (female) ward, had been asking the junior doctors on duty in the ward not to throw used gloves and syringes on the floor. 

 On Wednesday, when they did that again, Sengupta decided to call in the authorities and show them how the junior doctors had littered the ward. 

 ?As the sister-in-charge of the ward, it is my duty to keep the ward clean and also to tell the doctors not to throw gloves and syringes on the floor, specially when we are talking so much about the spread of AIDS and infection these days,? Sengupta said. 

 Around 10.30 am, Sengupta asked senior hospital officers to visit the ward and see for themselves how gloves and syringes were strewn all over the ward floor.

 ?Outraged at this, the junior doctors started abusing me and promised to teach me a lesson. They left the ward and came back soon with several others. They started shouting at me and my other colleagues,? recounted Sengupta. 

 The junior doctors forced Sengupta into her small cubicle and locked the door. 

 ?They pushed me into a corner of the room and locked the door. I could hardly breathe. I had to stay in there without food or water till 2.30 pm. The hospital authorities were helpless and could only watch from a distance,? Sengupta added.

 Around 2.30 pm, she could finally get her hands on a mobile phone, with which she managed to establish contact with her husband, Arun, who arrived on the scene with a police force. 

 ?I was eventually rescued by the police, but the junior doctors continued to abuse me,? Sengupta said. 

 None of the senior hospital officials was willing to comment on the issue, saying that it was an internal matter. 

Death, disorder

 There was trouble, too, at Medical College and Hospital, late on Tuesday. The anger spilled over on to Wednesday.

 A 10-year-old patient?s death triggered the violence, with the boy?s relatives accusing a medical officer of charging Rs 100 for taking extra care. 

 Medical superintendent Rabindranath Chatterjee reached the spot on time on Tuesday evening and rescued the medical officer. 

 ?The doctor has denied the incident. The patient?s relatives told me that the doctor did take the money but returned it after the boy?s death. We have decided to take action against the doctor by shifting him to another ward,? said Chatterjee.

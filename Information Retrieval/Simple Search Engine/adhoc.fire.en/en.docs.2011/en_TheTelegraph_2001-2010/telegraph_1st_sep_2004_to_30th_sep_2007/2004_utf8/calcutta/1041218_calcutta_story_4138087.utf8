Pop prerogative

Music zone

Britney Spears talks about her musical 

journey over the years

It?s been five long years for pop diva Britney Spears 

from Baby One More Time to the recently-released hit album My Prerogative. 

In the interim she?s done it all from steamy videos to controversial stage acts. 

Sangita Sultania G. Roy caught up with the star over email.

Was the hush-hush stopover to Rajasthan, en 

route to your honeymoon to Fiji islands, your first trip to India? What was 

the experience like? 

It was a really quick trip. Yes, it was my first trip 

to India and I?d love to come back someday. It was a great experience and I really 

loved the food. 

Disappointed suitors may like to know, what attracted 

you to Kevin in the first place? 

Lots of things, but it?s his genuine nature that I 

really dig. 

Are reports of your stepping away from showbiz 

in the near future to start a family true? 

I just want to take a break from work and relax for 

a while. It?s been five long years from Baby One More Time to My Prerogative... 

What has the journey been like? 

It?s been a series of ups and downs. Surprises ? both 

pleasant and unpleasant. But I?m happy to be where I am. 

Your new single My Prerogative, also the 

title of your new greatest hits album, sounds more like the bitter rant of a media-hounded 

pop star. What?s the idea? 

Whatever you say, I love the lyrics of the cover single, 

the song, which was originally sung by Bobby Brown. They are so in-your-face and 

very me! And for the interest of my Indian audience, there are some unmistakable 

tabla beats in the song.

The knee knock-out earlier this year forced you 

to take a break. What does the incident portend for a young pop artiste like you? 

That you can?t push yourself too far no matter how 

high you may be flying! 

You are reported to be playing an ambitious teenager 

trying to make it in Hollywood in Tobi Tobin?s forthcoming film Door to Door. 

Does it speak about your own life in a way? 

I can?t comment about the film yet. 

Was it J.Lo who inspired you to spray Curious Britney 

Spears perfume? 

Not really! It?s something I?ve wanted to do for a 

long time. 

Was the now-notorious kiss with Madonna while performing 

Me Against The Music at MTV Music Video Awards intentional or spontaneous? 

It was just something we talked about during rehearsals 

and went with the flow of the performance. 

What can Britney Spears fans expect next? 

Nothing for a little while now, but I?ll be back soon. 

I would like to thank all my Indian fans for their support though!

SOUND SCAN

Screen action

 She?s got a solo career, is still a member of the 

band that started it all and now, Gwen Stefani is also on the silver screen. 

The blond bombshell received a Grammy nomination for 

her debut single What you waiting for? And No Doubt was nominated for It?s 

My Life. 

In her solo album Love Angel Music Baby (a 

salute to her fashion label LAMB), Stefani has teamed up with some of the best 

names in the business, to produce, co-write and sing, from Dr Dre to Andre 3000. 

It?s shamelessly retro, very much establishing her as a pop diva. 

Stefani, married to Gavin Rossdale of the band Bush, 

landed a movie role in Martin Scorsese?s The Aviator, starring Leonardo 

DiCaprio. She plays a small role in the Howard Hughes biopic. But Stefani got 

the part of Jean Harlow, the star of Hughes 1930 aviation drama Hell?s Angels, 

after a series of auditions. Now, she?s all set for more screen action.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dilapidation ails police stations

 SANJAY MANDAL AMP; DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY

 Overflowing sewer lines, crumbling buildings that can well be tagged condemned, piles of concrete that have fallen off the walls and roofs, and lack of drinking water life is a hellhole for law-enforcers in the fringe areas.

 Bidhannagar (North) police station, the oldest in Salt Lake and a stones throw from Indira Bhavan, residence of former chief minister Jyoti Basu, is in a shambles. The sewer lines have been overflowing for the past few days.

 The lines have been jammed for years and overflow every monsoon, making it impossible to work in the thana or live in the quarters.

 There is also a severe scarcity of drinking water. We have to buy water to quench our thirst, said an officer of Bidhannagar (North) thana.

 On Sunday, a team of Bidhannagar Municipality officials visited the police station. The condition on the campus is inhuman. Sewer lines are overflowing and almost all the buildings are dilapidated, said Sabyasachi Dutta, local Trinamul Congress councillor. Chunks of concrete are falling off the building. We are absolutely unsafe here, an official of the police station said. The PWD has not conducted any repairs in five years.

 Around 80 families live in the staff quarters, while nearly 200 personnel, including staff of the Community Centre Control Room, work at the police station. 

 Officials said they had lodged complaints with the PWD several times. I shall write to the PWD engineer here, requesting him to undertake repair work immediately, said Humayun Kabir, sub-divisional police officer of Bidhannagar.

 According to officers of North 24-Parganas police, several other police stations are in a bad shape.

 PWD minister Amar Choudhury told Metro on Sunday that he would look into the matter on priority. However, a nod for the repairs must come from the district police officers, he added.

 The condition of East Jadavpur police station, on the other side of town, is worse. The thana, guarding a key segment of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees constituency, does not have a proper building. The makeshift barracks are erected of tin. 

 At Falta, police said tackling criminals is not a priority. We pass sleepless nights as venomous snakes share our rooms, said an official of the police station. The old and crumbling building needs immediate repair, but applications have yielded no result. 

 We had informed the higher authorities and the home department about the conditions of police stations, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas. He felt the sheer volume of applications for repairs that pour in from across the state is what is delaying the repairs. It becomes difficult to prioritise things, Gupta maintained. 

 PWD officials said a funds crunch was a handicap. We are short of funds but we are trying to carry out the repairs on a war footing, they added.

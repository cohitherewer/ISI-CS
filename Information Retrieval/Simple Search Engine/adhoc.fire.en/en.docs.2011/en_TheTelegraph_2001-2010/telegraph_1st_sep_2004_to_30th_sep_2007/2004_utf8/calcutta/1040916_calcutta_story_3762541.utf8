 Chaos after road cave-in 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Traffic movement on BB Ganguly Street and College Street was sluggish on Wednesday, following a subsidence between the tram tracks at the intersection of the two roads on Tuesday evening.

 ?A four-foot-wide arch of a brick sewer subsided 10 feet under the road. We are not sure what caused the cave-in. The vibration caused by moving trams or the current spell of incessant rain may have been responsible for it,? said mayor-in-council member (drainage) Mala Roy.

 A seven-foot stretch around the tracks has been cordoned off for repairs, which may take around 45 days. ?As it is one of the busiest intersections in the city, repair work will take time,? Roy explained. 

 Tram services may remain suspended during this period. 

 On Wednesday, traffic at the College Street-BB Ganguly Street intersection moved in double file. As a spillover effect, there were congestions on Chittaranjan Avenue and Mahatma Gandhi Road. 

 Civic engineers will start digging the caved-in site on Thursday. 

 Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) managing director Shankar Pal said he was yet to get a detailed report of the incident. 

 ?I am expecting a report from the civic authorities. They usually seek our consent before undertaking repairs along the tram tracks,? he added.

 Mayor-in-council member (roads) Anup Chatterjee said his department had repaved the stretch with a bituminous layer before the Pujas last year. But the bitumin layer wears off fast because of the vibration caused by trams, he pointed out.

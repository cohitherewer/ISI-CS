Water wealth for fund flow

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 One should hang pictures of rivers flowing 

softly through mountains to ensure good flow of income. The direction of the flow 

of water should always be inside the house and its movement should never be directed 

towards the door. This is because water represents wealth in Feng Shui 

Q: I am a successful interior designer, 

but my clients don?t seem to pay me on time. My repeated reminders often fall 

on deaf ears. Please suggest some Feng Shui remedies that will help me get my 

payments on time.

Shivani

The Solution: This is a general problem faced 

by many, irrespective of the profession they are in. It is the south-east area 

of your house and office that needs a closer look. This area must be absolutely 

uncluttered and care should be taken that there is no picture, painting or photograph 

that depicts a dry forest, deserted land or anything unproductive. This is our 

wealth area. To encourage a good flow of income, we should have pictures of rivers 

flowing softly through the mountains. The direction of the flow of water should 

always be inside the house and its movement should not be directed towards the 

door. This is because water in Feng Shui represents wealth. The south-east area 

is ruled by wood energy and is directly connected with the growing of wealth. 

Place a lemon plant in this area of the garden or balcony with strong thoughts 

of retrieving your stuck funds. You will soon see recovery of your dues.

Q: I have an extremely small house and I 

feel cramped in it. We have been living for years together like this and have 

not progressed much. Over time, it has become even more cluttered with accumulated 

possessions. There is not enough storage space and wardrobes are overflowing. 

Recently we introduced a few mirrors and plants in the house to bring some positive 

energy, but things have worsened rather than improving. Please suggest ways to 

make our lives more comfortable and happy.

Aditi Agarwal

The Solution: In small houses it is very important 

to be well organised. The house must always remain clean and tidy, because a messy 

and cluttered environment upsets the flow of cosmic energy and disturbs the family?s 

ability to think clearly. It is best to clear the space by removing unnecessary 

furniture or possessions and lightening the load of wardrobes by giving away old 

clothes that you rarely wear. Also avoid storing heavy things above cupboards, 

as this tends to overburden your mind. Refresh the house occasionally by painting 

it in light shades, and then mirrors will enhance valuable space. But if you magnify 

the clutter in your house with these mirrors, the effect will only be negative. 

Invite fresh energy by placing fresh plants in the east and south-eastern parts 

of the house and pictures of sunrise, seascapes and horizons will bring in new 

opportunities.

Q: My friend and I are planning to 

venture into the advertising business soon. I would like to know if we are compatible. 

We are both born in the year 1979 and share the same Chinese zodiac animal sign, 

which is ram.

Niket Goyal

The Solution: The advertising profession suits 

your natures best as you are wanderers who are happy if you can interact with 

clients personally. Both of you will be extremely creative and have a natural 

flair for art and design. You admire beautifully created work and are entranced 

by inspirational work. Both of you are gentle and trustworthy. You will be considerate 

towards each other and your clients. Your flexible and warm manners will put your 

clients at ease. Chances are that there won?t be any personality or ego clashes 

but if they do occur, both of you will step forward to remedy the situation and 

re-establish the troubled partnership. The only disadvantage of this partnership 

is that both of you have a relaxed approach to life. You may not have the sense 

of responsibility needed to run the business and giving orders to subordinates 

will not be your strong point. Your absent-mindedness and unconventional nature 

could irritate your clients but both of you will be forgiven because of your kind 

hearts.

Q: I have a large bedroom and will 

get married very soon. I would like to create a corner where I could entertain 

my friends and also have a small study for reading and writing. From the Feng 

Shui point of view, which is the best place for such an arrangement?

Anshuman

The Solution: Your bed should be in the marriage 

corner, which is the south-west part of your bedroom. A den for entertaining your 

friends can be created in the north-west of the room as this is popularly known 

as friend?s area in Feng Shui. The study table can be arranged in the east or 

north-east of the room. With such an arrangement in the bedroom it is important 

that you create distinct boundaries between the rest of the room and the entertainment 

areas. One needs a secure feeling while sleeping and screening off the bed with 

a low-height cabinet will work as a divider between the bed and the seating arrangement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CellOne in tower hitch 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 CellOne has just touched the two-lakh mark, leaving private competitors far behind in terms of growth, but Calcutta Telephones (CalTel) is a bit worried about the figures.

 Over the past three months, CalTel?s mobile service has attracted more than 92,000 subscribers, far more than the combined growth of the city?s private operators. ?The growth is satisfactory, but the rate indicates that we need to pull up our socks,? said a CalTel official. 

 The main concern seems to be the delay in selecting rooftops for setting up base transmission stations. ?Seventy such stations are waiting to be set up. The delay and the corresponding rise in the number of connections are causing network congestion,? the official added.

 Another area CalTel needs to focus on is finetuning of the transmission stations. ?In the absence of finetuning, a particular CellOne connection is intercepting signals from various transmission stations, resulting in poor quality of speech,? an official informed.

 According to CalTel officials, there are 135 transmission stations at present and 200 more towers are scheduled to be set up by December. The present switching capacity is 2.75 lakh. Once the new transmission stations come up, it will rise to 6 lakh. 

 After the August 15 merger of West Bengal Telecom and CalTel, the number of roaming subscribers in the city has recorded a steep jump. ?On an average, 20,000 roaming subscribers frequent the BBD area every day. There is a threat of network jamming here,? an official warned. 

 The authorities have applied the brakes on new connections and CellOne?s prepaid connections are being given only once a week.

 Jailbirds in pre-Puja shift

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Aftab Ansari, accused of masterminding the attack on the American Center, and six of his associates were shifted from Presidency jail to Alipore Central jail on Monday, following intelligence inputs that they had been plotting a jailbreak in collusion with terror outfit Hijbul Mujahideen.

 Announcing the shift on Tuesday, deputy inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya said: ?We have also shifted six criminals, including Gabbar and Happy Singh, from Alipore Central to Presidency Jail.? Gabbar was involved in several extortion cases and Happy is an accused in the Bunty murder case. 

 ?The transfer was the need of the hour to avert any untoward incident during the Pujas,? Bhattacharya added. 

 Security in all central and sub-divisional jails in the state has been tightened, Bhattacharya asserted. ?We don?t want to take any risk, as both securitymen and prisoners get involved in festivities on the jail premises.? 

 The fact that Ansari had been in touch with his contacts outside for a long time came to light two months ago, when a mobile phone was found in a courtyard adjacent to his cell. 

 ?Ansari may have also roped in a few warders to get information from criminals still at large,? a senior officer said. 

 The sleuths have also come to know that Ansari had established contact with Gabbar and Happy through some warders. ?We are trying to identify them. We had to work out the transfer overnight to break the nexus between the criminals at the two key jails in Alipore,? he admitted.

 In a related development, the jail authorities have asked superintendents in three central jails ? Dum Dum, Alipore and Presidency ? to ensure that the Pujas on their premises are on low key this year. 

 ?No prisoners will be allowed to spend time outside their cells beyond a certain period,? an officer said.

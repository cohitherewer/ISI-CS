The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Twin fund-raiser projects on 60 surplus acres

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two housing and commercial estates, on nearly 60 acres, are set to make a debut.

 If things move as planned, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will shortly implement the twin projects on land adjacent to the Garden Reach water treatment plant and the Mahestala sewer treatment plant. 

 ?Preliminary discussions have been held,? according to CMDA?s chief executive officer Alapan Bandyopadhyay. ?This is part of our plan to make optimal reuse of surplus land,? he told Metro.

 The cash-strapped CMDA will reuse optimally all its surplus land for implementing public welfare projects. Once the estates at Garden Reach and Mahestala come up, the agency will spend the revenue earned from them on maintaining the water treatment and sewage treatment plants, Bandyopadhyay added. 

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority, which functions under the CMDA, operates and maintains the Garden Reach plant.

 CMDA officials said they were planning to set up a string of housing and commercial estates. ?At our next board meeting, we will discuss in detail how to raise resources for the projects. We may also go in for joint ventures,? an official declared.

 The agency is also planning to set up an industrial estate, where plots can be sold off to various commercial organisations for constructing offices. ?This will be in tune with the Kasba industrial estate,? a functionary said.

 ?We had submitted a proposal to the authorities for utilising our prime land for earning revenue. We are happy they have decided to implement it finally,? said P.B. Nag, CMDA staff union general secretary. 

 The agency had acquired land for the two phases of the Garden Reach water treatment plant, in 1974 and 1982. For the sewage treatment plant, land was acquired in 1978. 

 However, parts of the land have been encroached upon and the CMDA will soon launch an eviction operation. 

 A few years ago, the agency had set up a committee to identify surplus plots that were either encroached upon or lying unutilised. Sources said the committee had listed around 400 acres at various places. 

 While submitting a status report, the committee had recommended that the surplus acres be used for remunerative projects.

 Ventures, such as the ones in Garden Reach and Mahestala, are being planned in Salt Lake, too. In DJ block of the township, the CMDA will set up a 10-storeyed commercial complex. Work on the joint-venture project is likely to start soon. 

 Another housing complex in Garia, off Garia Station Road, is already underway. ?We are also planning to set up 4,000 dwelling units in the coming few years in and around the city,? a senior official said.

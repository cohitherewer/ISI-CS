The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Question time 

The talking point for the next one week will be a 

countdown to the September 18 date with the biggest open quiz that this city has 

seen. TOPS (The Telegraph Open-quiz Show) has shut shop with a whopping 650 entries. 

With three people per team, that?s a staggering 1,950 quiz-crazy Calcuttans signing 

up for a battle of knowledge. The cut-off was anyone 14 years (Class IX) or above, 

so the teams are an eclectic mix of all ages and types. Students, professionals, 

families... This one is literally open to all. There, will, however, be a surprise 

entry by invitation, called Team Calcutta. The event, co-organised by Derek O?Brien 

and Associates, has already been held in Guwahati and is scheduled for September 

11 in Ranchi. The two winning teams will compete with the five finalists selected 

from here, as well as Team Calcutta. The eight teams will then fight for the trophy. 

The September 18 event at Science City auditorium will begin at 3.30 pm, with 

36 questions to be answered on paper. Then, the prelims, and finally the main 

show at 5.30 pm, with Derek O?Brien as quizmaster. The highlight of the evening 

is not just a performance by Bangla band Bhoomi, but also a live round, with music, 

dance and a fashion show and questions centred around them. Don?t miss the action 

next week. If you?ve already signed up, then aim for the prizes on offer.

But that hasn?t stopped Sayomdeb Mukherjee, 22, from travelling around the world 

to educate and spread awareness. After Washington and Denmark, the trainee at 

Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy is off to Natal, Brazil, this year, to the 

International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication conference 

on October 7. He will present a paper on ?When god wants to see you?, selected 

as the Outstanding Consumer Lecture.

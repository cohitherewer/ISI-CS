The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Prestige pass to party zone

 The nightclub circuit in the city 

 may have turned on its head over the past few months, but 

 some of the rules of the disco-hopping game remain unchanged. 

 While everyone wants to try out all the new places in town, 

 the thrill of being in the comfort zone of a regular haunt 

 is still coveted.

 That is where member schemes to 

 night-time destinations come into play. For example, at 

 Big Ben, the nightclub at The Kenilworth, membership is 

 reserved for an exclusive few. Membership is usually by 

 invitation, but those interested can submit their personal 

 and company profile, and get an application form in return. 

 Only if this is accepted is the annual member card handed 

 over, for a fee.

 ?At present, we have around 700 

 members,? says manager Subir Das.

 Benefits include a 15 per cent 

 discount on food and beverages at Big Ben and all other 

 outlets at the Little Russell Street hotel. A 20 per cent 

 discount on rooms is also given, as are special rates for 

 banquet bookings, depending on the menu. Invites to special 

 events are sent to members, so they can bring in guests 

 free of charge. With all this, special packages at the Goa 

 Kenilworth property are thrown in.

 But Big Ben is also evidence of 

 the fact that the members-only policy does not really work. 

 They have relaxed their previously strict bars on entry, 

 allowing non-members on a discretionary basis.

 ?We thought we would give it a 

 try. Even our members requested us to let others in,? explains 

 Das.

 Tantra, the nightclub at The Park, 

 has, in fact, extended the concept of exclusive membership.

 Apart from regular members of 

 Tantra, the Bodhi Bar is a zone reserved for those who choose 

 to cough up a little extra. While Bodhi Bar has around 100 

 members, there are 400 Tantra members. Here, too, the list 

 is handpicked. 

 Of course, with the high costs, 

 it only makes sense for the regular party people. Tantra 

 membership comes for Rs 15,000 and entry to the first-floor 

 Bodhi Bar is double that amount. Against this annual fee, 

 free entry is guaranteed for all.

 Bodhi Bar members can buy and 

 keep a bottle just for their own use over time. Invites 

 go out for all fashion shows, food festivals and other special 

 events at the hotel.

 Free entry for a member and a 

 partner for the numerous special events, like theme and 

 DJ nights, is a big draw. The spate of new clubs around 

 town has not really dented the demand for expanding this 

 exclusive club of party-goers. ?Demand for the Bodhi Bar, 

 with its exclusive comforts and personalised service, is 

 still huge,? confirms a spokesperson for The Park.

 All sticks on the dhak for puja talent hunts

 If there is one thing integral to the puja after the chanting of the mantras, it has to be the beat of the dhak. Particular bols are prescribed in the scriptures for each stage of the puja. But faced with electronic competition from the loudspeaker, playing a soothing shehnai strain or an ear-splitting film hit, the dhak has well and truly taken a beating. 

 This year, however, the spotlight is on the neglected art and the artistes. Dhak has been taken on the awards bandwagon, which has so far carried the idol, the pandal, the illuminations and even the Devi?s lion on the annual search for the best and brightest. Two major awards are happening around the dhakis. 

 Already off the preparation block is Rhythm Dhaker Lorai 2004, a contest for groups of dhakis representing respective puja committees, sponsored by the south India-based makers of Cycle brand incense sticks. Invitations have been sent out to about 100 committees. ?The grandeur of a dhak recital comes out best when they play in groups. We want them to be at least three in number,? says Sabyasachi Chatterjee of Offbit Marketing Services, the event managers for the contest, which has a booty of Rs 51,000 going directly to the dhakis. 

 The preliminary round happens on Sashthi when the dhakis drum up a beat in front of the visiting judges. Fifteen will be short-listed to play on Saptami. The big day is Ashtami when percussionist Bikram Ghosh and his wife, actress Jaya Seal, pick the best pair of hands.

 Cellphone operator Hutch has also included a Dhaki Samrat contest among its Puja-related initiatives. If Dhaker Lorai involves a group effort, this will search for individual excellence.

 ?We have divided the city into four zones. On Panchami and Sashthi, the participants will play at the zonal venue,? informs a Hutch spokesperson. If Ahiritola Sarbojanin and Labony Estate Durgotsab play host for the north and the east, the addresses for the south and the west are Ballygunge Cultural Sarbojanin and Behala Sahajatri respectively. The finals take place on Saptami at Bosepukur Sitala Mandir in Kasba, with percussionists Tanmoy Bose and Ratul Shankar, and singer Rupankar doing the selection.

 Lauding the initiatives, Ghosh points out how the art of dhak-playing is on the decline. ?In our childhood, there would be so many expert dhakis playing at pujas like Maddox Square. These days sub-standard performance is accepted as the organisers themselves have lost the ear for rhythm. The dhakis are in other professions the rest of the year. Perhaps this will provide them the incentive to practise more,? the ace percussionist opines.

 Organisers are also happy. ?The dhakis are poor people who come from the villages. So many of them are leaving the profession. If they get such cash prizes, perhaps they would want to carry on,? feels Sumanta Roy, president of Jodhpur Park puja committee.

 The Puja awards have brought back sanity and sobriety to Durga puja. Perhaps the fortunes of the dhak will be revived as well through the same route.

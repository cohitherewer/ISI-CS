The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Durga puja without drum beats is unthinkable. But, the 

 dhaakis who congregate every year for a couple of 

 days at the Hazra-Kalighat Road crossing, create a stupendous 

 din. It makes life miserable for the residents and shop-keepers 

 in the area. Apart from the noise, they also contribute 

 to the traffic snarls by blocking a part of the road. The 

 Pollution Control Board and the Calcutta Police should seriously 

 look into the matter. Perhaps, a secluded, non-residential 

 area, could be earmarked for this yearly stopover of the 

 dhaakis.

 A long public holiday like the puja vacation is the opportune 

 period for unauthorised constructions to come up. Some unscrupulous 

 people wait for such days so that they can start building 

 illegal houses and shops much to the inconvenience of the 

 residents of the area. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation 

 inspectors are also on leave during pujas. I appeal to the 

 Corporation to draw up a plan to watch out for such discrepancies 

 during public holidays and take necessary action.

 Sweets are indispensable in pujas which is why their sales 

 pick up during the festive period. However, many small-scale 

 sweet manufacturers use harmful colours and flavours in 

 them to lower the production cost and make more profit. 

 The Corporations health officers should carry out 

 surprise inspections at the sweet-making workshops during 

 pujas.

 I watched the shows at the Indo-British Digital Film Festival, 

 held at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, on three 

 days between October 4 and 9. I observed that the distance 

 between the screen and where the audience was seated is 

 very less. Many had to leave the three-hour show midway 

 because they found it taxing on their eyes. Perhaps, it 

 would not have mattered as much if the duration of the show 

 was half of what it was. Can the authorities modify the 

 seating arrangement a little to make the viewing more comfortable? 

 Prantik Sanyal,

 S.P. Mukherjee Road. 

 Residents of Manasbhumi, near the airport, have to trek 

 a long distance to Italgacha sub post office to post letters 

 as there is not a single letterbox in their area. It would 

 be appreciated if the postal authorities put up a letterbox 

 in the area. The premises of Sarnamayee School would be 

 the ideal location as it can be accessed by most residents 

 of Manasbhumi area.

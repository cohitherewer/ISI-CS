 Flavours of season: Durga amp; wedlock

 MITA MUKHERJEE 

Priests and decorators must be thanking their stars this Durga puja. 

 After nearly 12 years, an unusual celestial configuration has marriage-ready families scurrying for dates during the Puja season. 

 And almanac-approved dates are aplenty in October: 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 13th, 15th, 20th (Saptami) and 27th. 

 The reason behind the Puja rush for marriage is that the Bengali month of Shravan (July-August), that yields the maximum number of auspicious dates, was a ?molomaas? this year. Hence, no marriage could be held.

 ?Molomaas recurs roughly after every two-and-a-half years. The stellar positions guiding the month are considered inauspicious for marriages, or any other sacred ritual,? explained Himangshu Smriti Tirtha, head pundit of Bishuddha Panjika.

 ?As Shravan was a molomaas for Hindus this year, a large number of people are preferring to fix nuptial dates in October,? added Debabrata Mukhopdhay, joint secretary of the Howrah Sanskrit Sahitya Samaj.

 Though there are no strictures in the scriptures, people generally prefer to avoid marriages during the Pujas. ?This year, however, the situation is different,? said Mukhopdhay.

 ?I would have organised my son?s marriage in Shravan, but I couldn?t find a single auspicious date in the month. So, I had to set a date in October. I could not wait till December, as my son is in a hurry. He has a new job and has to settle down in another city,? said Suhas Dey of Tagore Park, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. His son is to marry on October 10.

 The Bhattacharjees of Salt Lake are getting their daughter married this month. They, too, would have preferred Shravan and cannot wait till December as the would-be son-in-law will shift by year-end to take up a new job.

 The overlapping of the Puja and marriage dates means a bonanza for decorators, florists, priests, garment shops and caterers, involved in supplying material for both rituals. 

 ?The marriage dates in October have boosted our business. Apart from the regular festive shoppers, we are getting 20 per cent more customers, most of whom are coming to purchase wedding saris,? admitted Dilip Kumar of Indian Silk House, on College Street. 

 Matching the demand for items required for Puja rituals, trousseaus are the rage of the season. According to an employee of Benarasi Kuthi, in Gariahat, traditional Benarasis, jors and gorod silk kurtas are bringing in as much business as the Puja buys.

 Cash tills are ringing in decorator firms, too. Pradip Banik, a proprietor of a firm in Salt Lake, said: ?The Puja season is hectic every year for us. Coupled with the marriage season, our workload has increased manifold. We are happy with the turnover.?

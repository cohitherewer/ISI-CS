The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 China boost for business in Bengal

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 China?s return to the Industrial India Trade Fair after four long years has further brightened the prospects of boosting business in Bengal.

 A memorandum of understanding (MoU), signed between the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the China Chamber of International Commerce (CCIC) on December 23 on the fair grounds, will pave the way for a string of Chinese investments in a variety of sectors early next year. 

 To start with, the CCIC has decided to set up a shoe factory in collaboration with a Calcutta-based company. ?For decades, Chinese immigrants in the city have been involved in manufacturing high-quality footwear. But sadly, the trade has taken a beating as many units have shut down,? said Samir Kumar Ghosh, chairman of the Industrial India Trade Fair committee. 

 ?The decline has been disconcerting, especially for the Chinese delegation. It has, therefore, decided to invest in this sector and hopes to bring about a turnaround in the business,? he added. 

 After the fair ends on December 31, the CCIC and the Indian partner, which runs a chain of footwear outlets in the city, will focus on giving shape to the factory dream.

 That apart, Chinese companies will also set up units for producing consumer and agricultural equipment, and chemicals. ?Besides consumer electronic products, electronic meters that will ensure precise readings will be manufactured right here,? Ghosh told Metro.

 Construction firms and furniture-manufacturing units, too, will be set up.

 The MoU with the 63-member Chinese delegation, led by CCIC president Jing Fuli, also addresses the issue of exchange of information between China and India ?to establish and strengthen? business. ?Frequent exchange of study groups, improving trade ties and boosting economic and trade ties? are part of the deal.

 Business experts are optimistic about the deal on the shoe factory. The fact that a city-based manufacturer will usher in a blend of Indo-China style in footwear is being seen as a significant gain. 

 The CCIC president has also invited Calcutta-based companies to invest in China?s ?special economic zones?. 

 ?With Nathu La opening, we will send a team to China for setting up units that the Chinese are interested in,? Ghosh announced. 

 Apart from Chinese companies, Bangladesh-based units dealing in ceramic, tiles and melamine products will also set up units in Calcutta.

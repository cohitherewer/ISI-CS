The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

L-zone: 1 Allenby

IPSITA DEB

 1 Allenby, with the tagline The Fashion Destination, is the newest fashion studio on the design block. The store boasts of stylish pret and couture collections of over 20 Indian designers, under one roof. The collection is rich in colour and the clothes are embellished with stones, beads, antique work, brocade and sequins. With every designer having their own distinct style mantra, the diversity in choice is huge.

 Usha Bagri, a designer herself, is the owner and creative brain behind 1 Allenby. Her expertise lies in the use of delicate motifs on soft fabrics. Apart from women?s wear, she has also launched a men?s collection comprising designer shirts and kurtas. ?We don?t believe in telling our clients what style of clothes or accessories they should wear. Rather, we try to judge their tastes and provide them with the look they want,? says Bagri.

Cosy feel

 Spread over 2,000 sq ft, the d?cor is very contemporary, providing ample space for a relaxed shopping experience. The lounge ambience, with frequent servings of tea and coffee, lends a cosy feel and each item is displayed individually, without being piled or cramped together. The well-appointed store boasts chic interiors in wood and glass.

 Western lines

 Stocking Suneet Verma, Aki Narula, Priya Awasty and Taika, Calcutta?s label hungry will no longer need to go far in search of diverse, unique western attire. Here, Narula?s whispering white cotton collection is showcased beside Awasty?s Indo-western multi-coloured crushed shirts and skirts and waist girdles in georgette and silk with intricate gota, mirrorwork and kantha. Nandini Barua?s Ozone tag brings a range of party wear to the store as the latest addition.

Ethnic elegance

 Poonam Bhagat?s hand-painted georgette salwar suits provide that perfect party punch, in soothing colours ranging from aquamarine to fuchsia. The store also houses a floral khadi collection from designers Kavita and Vanita with interesting embroidery and thread work. Bagri?s own Gems Collection can be found here, too. Saris and salwar suits inspired by antique jewellery motifs and embellished with jamevar and zari work set the tone of the collection.

 Essential add-ons

The embroidered bags and sequin-embellished mojris 

on display are dressy and very hip (pictures by Rashbehari Das). In a large 

variety of colours to match any outfit in the store, both the shoes and bags boast 

fine finishing and are going at an affordable price.

 Another section worth a look at the store is the jewellery collection. The colourful earrings, bracelets and necklaces displayed on separate glass shelves are wearable with both Indian and western apparel, and have been sourced from Mumbai and Delhi. Open to business for barely a month now, the store is sure to grow with time, especially with the constant new additions from designers across India. 

 The style stop, at (obviously) 1, Allenby Road in the lane opposite Forum, hope Usha and husband Sudarshan Bagri, will soon emerge as couture destination.

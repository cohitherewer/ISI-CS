The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bookworm bites in city centre 

ZEESHAN JAWED

Another lost customer? runs a promo line for Crossword. 

At the Elgin Road store, there is much more than just books to get lost in.

A snatch of music, the smell of cappuccino and some 

leisurely browsing makes book buying so much more fulfilling.

?Both books and music have become lifestyle components. 

So when you go out to shop for them, you need an atmosphere that complements them. 

Besides the book racks, other facilities like a cafeteria and a music zone are 

also essential factors,? says Sidharth Pansari, managing director, Crossword.

A look...

Hot spot

Crossword, the 18,000 sq ft bookstore with a coffee 

shop that?s located at 8, Elgin Road. The first floor is for the book browsers 

and the beat brigade. 

The second floor is both kids? corner and lovers? 

lair, thanks to the children?s books-and-toys section and the relaxed air of the 

cafeteria.

Reading time

The book haunt stays open from 10.30 in the morning 

to 8.30 at night, seven days a week.

Browse buy

A reader is likely to find a collection of 65,000 

to 80,000 books at any given point of time. With a varied range including fiction, 

humour, autobiographies, art and culture, the idea is to cater to all tastes. 

For lovers of Rabindranath Tagore, there is an entire rack dedicated to the bard 

of Bengal. 

There are comfortable seating arrangements and 40 

trained staff members around to help out.

For music lovers, there is always a stock of 15,000 

to 25,000 CDs and plenty of elbow room to pick and choose. 

Kid corner 

More than half the second floor is dedicated to kids. 

The area is carpeted so that no child hurts himself in a fall. The range of books 

includes comics, reference and quiz books. But come Sunday and the kids are treated 

to some book-reading and handicraft sessions. ?The idea is to impart knowledge 

while having fun,? says Pansari.

Grub club

While the kids are busy with their toys, mom and dad 

can have a light bite and adda at the 32-seater cafeteria, maintained by 

Coffee Pai. ?Internationally, all book stores have an adjoining cafeteria. The 

smell of coffee gives off a chilled out feel to the surroundings,? says Pansari. 

The Bombay Batata Sandwich and the Club Trio Sandwich are major sellouts, reveals 

Naveen Pai of Coffee Pai. Hot and cold tea, Darjeeling and Assam, also find favour. 

Bookworms are allowed to read over a steaming cuppa (as seen in picture above 

by Aranya Sen).

Crowd call

Crossword often plays host to a variety of cultural 

events, like play-reading sessions or caf? theatres.

?I prefer calling Crossword a community centre, rather 

than a bookstore. It?s a place where you can connect and communicate with a variety 

of people through such activities. The cross-cultural exchange is what we promote,? 

says Pansari.

so, the trend of caf? theatre is catching up in Calcutta, 

with Crossword emerging as key role-player. Being seen at such dos is a lifestyle 

statement now, feels Pansari.

Not long ago Crossword, played host to poet Gulzar. 

The turnout then and at most events before that clearly indicate that the bookstore 

born this April has emerged as a hot hangout, for those browsing, buying, reading 

between the lines or just chilling out.

 Turn, turn, turn Why a Mercedes 

 Benz and a cycle are not separated by much

 Altamont road is one of the most 

 expensive addresses in Mumbai. If you are walking downhill 

 on this road, you will reach Kemps Corner. This busy junction 

 will tempt you to cross over to the glamorous Pedder Road. 

 If instead you take the more logical left turn, it will 

 take you to Nana Chowk. By doing so you would have walked 

 almost the complete affluence spectrum of Mumbai. The richest 

 of rich live on the hilltop on this road. As you climb down 

 the hill, you also climb down the income scale. Finally, 

 Nana Chowk brings you down to earth with a thud.

 A.S. Billimoria is a noted solicitor. 

 He has this 7,000-sq-ft ancestral bungalow on the upper 

 reaches of Altamont Road. A week before Diwali, he was having 

 breakfast with his wife. She raised the issue again. Perhaps 

 the wedding reception they attended the previous evening 

 had stoked the fire. Her Honda Accord is letting her down. 

 No, not in terms of performance; it?s the other thing. Most 

 of her friends are now using Mercedes Benz E class. Mr Billimoria 

 himself prefers to use an impeccably maintained Fiat (not 

 Premiere Padmini, please) that he bought in 1968. But for 

 his young second wife, he would buy anything, well almost. 

 So Pistonji, the trusted auto dealer, was spoken to. The 

 Honda Accord was driven away and a gleaming silver Mercedes 

 E class entered the Altamont Road bungalow.

 Few houses down the road lives 

 Dr Utpal Sen. His 21st-floor 2,500-sq-ft apartment is truly 

 a ?Saali?s envy, Biwi?s pride? item. From the sitting room, 

 you can see the Arabian Sea in its pristine aquamarine glory. 

 Utpal and Mita, his wife, were enjoying their Saturday afternoon 

 tea on the balcony when the phone rang. Pistonji was on 

 the line, with a well-kept Honda Accord, for only Rs 12 

 lakh! Two days later, Utpal gave Mita a Diwali surprise. 

 When she went down to the car park to go to the club for 

 a swim, she found her Opel Astra missing. Sukhvinder the 

 driver was standing next to a Black Honda Accord. Just what 

 the doctor had ordered.

 On Gamadia Road, Bhuleskars decided 

 not to change their second-floor one-bedroom flat. Instead, 

 they sold their Maruti 800 and bought a used Opel Astra. 

 Birth of the second child had made those weekend trips to 

 Pune in the small car less than comfortable. They needed 

 a bigger car.

 This is Srinivasan?s seventh year 

 in Mumbai. As a computer guy he should have been in LA. 

 He chose Mumbai instead and runs a small computer maintenance 

 shop on Nana Chowk. He is available on call. Sometimes he 

 brings the computers to his workstation. His TVS Victor 

 then becomes inadequate. He has to take a cab. The Bhuleskars? 

 Maruti 800 was well worth the price.

 Especially because the dabbawala 

 who served dinner to Srini everyday has been eyeing his 

 motorcycle for quite some time. His cash payment came in 

 handy. Pistonji wanted down payment for the Maruti. Dabbawala 

 reached his home in Ambarnath in his bike. Neighbours noticed 

 the promotion. Lalu the domestic help mustered courage the 

 next morning to offer a decent price for dabbawala?s 

 bicycle. The deal was struck. The next day, Lalu bicycled 

 to work.

 Stop press: The managing 

 directors of Atlas cycle and Mercedes Benz in India are 

 meeting to explore the possibility of a joint marketing 

 strategy.

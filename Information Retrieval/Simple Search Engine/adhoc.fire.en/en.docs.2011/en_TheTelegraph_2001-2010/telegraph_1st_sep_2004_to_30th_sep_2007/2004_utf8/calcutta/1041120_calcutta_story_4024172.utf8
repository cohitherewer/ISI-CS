 Teachers frown on contract services

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Contractual appointment can only be a short-term answer to the present shortage of teachers in private schools.

 This unanimous view emerged at a discussion on ?Fallout of Contract Services in Private Schools? on Friday. 

 Organised by the Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools, the session was attended by principals, headmasters and teachers of reputed English-medium schools in the city. 

 Speakers at the meet stressed the need to conduct an ?in-depth study? to find out the effects of contractual appointment on the education system. 

 ?As of now, the situation involving contractual appointment of teachers in private schools is not very alarming,? observed C.R. Gasper, principal, St Augustine?s Day School, and member of the state board for Anglo-Indian education. 

 But he added a rider: ?The system can be adopted, provided the spirit of the agreement is acceptable to both parties ? the management and the teachers.?

 Teachers of private schools are rattled by the issue, as a growing number of schools in the city as well as in the districts are opting for contractual appointment to cope with the demands of the modern education system.

 Teachers appointed on contract often complain to the association that their jobs have been terminated on ?flimsy grounds?, or that they are being paid unexpectedly ?low salaries?. 

 Keeping in mind that imparting education is a continuous process and that the commitment expected of teachers is totally different from that of other professionals, the participants raised a string of questions on the desirability of contract services. 

 The questions were: 

 2Will contract service help schools achieve their targets?

 2How will students react if teachers keep changing?

 2What happens to a school?s reputation if good teachers quit, getting better jobs?

 2Can contracts force teachers to upgrade their knowledge, a not-so-common practice now?

 2Will teachers be able to put in their best if they feel insecure?

 Samaresh Banerjee, former justice of Calcutta High Court and moderator of the meet, felt the answers couldn?t be reached in one sitting. 

 He urged teachers to take the issue forward and organise many more such interactive sessions. 

 Suman Mukherjee, director of education, JD Birla Institute, pointed out that one of the biggest problems plaguing the system is teachers? apathy in upgrading their knowledge. 

 And this, despite the fact that teachers enjoy the maximum number of holidays, compared with other professionals. 

 ?But one should not cite this as the only reason to introduce the system of contract service. We can find out a different way to overcome the problem,? Mukherjee added. 

 Anomitra Das, deputy secretary, West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, admitted that the government had appointed teachers on contract for the implementation of the Sarba Shiksha Abhijan, which aims at educating all children below 14 years.

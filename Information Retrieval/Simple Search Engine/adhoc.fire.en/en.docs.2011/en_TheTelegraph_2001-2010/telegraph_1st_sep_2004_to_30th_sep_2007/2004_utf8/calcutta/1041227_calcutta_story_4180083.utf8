The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Haunting music, like a slow train

 Marakatha Mani Keeravani has turned down offers from Ram Gopal Varma, Ketan Mehta and Raj Kumar Santoshi. Sounds Aramaic? Well, read on. We are talking of music director M. M. Kreem, who has rejected the best of Bollywood ? sometimes for budget constraints, sometimes for lack of time. As a result, the Hindi film industry has only tasted a teaser of the man?s incredible repertoire of musical talent ? Criminal, Iss Raat Ki Subaah Nahin, Zakhm, Sur, Jism and now Rog.

 ?I have been learning violin since the age of four,? says the man from Hyderabad, even as he finalises a song with director Tanuja Chandra. ?I have always been in touch with film music, Hindi and regional. I was an avid listener of the Binaca Geetmala and loved the works of Madan Mohan, S.D. Burman and R.D. Burman. They put music in my blood. And then when it came to a question of livelihood, I started assisting the late Chakravarthi who scored music for more than 1,000 films down south.?

 It was Ramoji Rao who gave Kreem his big break in December 1989 and the film in question was Manasu Mamata. ?The music was a hit and the film ran for 99 days. I went on to get loads of assignments there but it was only in 1993 when I got to do my first Hindi film Criminal with Mahesh Bhatt saab. Till date, I have done more than 160 films in the south but only six films in Bollywood and that too all with the Bhatts.?

 It could have been all so different had music baron Gulshan Kumar lived on, recalls Kreem. ?He gave me 10 to 12 movies in a single shot. I was supposed to work with everyone from Raj Kanwar to Rajeev Menon. But what happened was really unfortunate. I sometimes think now what it would be like had that incident not happened.?

 However, Kreem did reject the 20 offers he got after the success of Jism. ?Some had very low budgets. Some were too hackneyed to take up. Some came at the wrong time. I don?t regret not doing them. I am doing some Hindi projects now. There?s Tanuja Chandra?s next. I am also doing Amol Palekar?s new film (with Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee). I recently recorded one of the six songs with Hariharan. Then there is Rajiv Babbar?s Kasak, which stars Lucky Ali and Pakistani actress Meera.?

 Talking about his music, Kreem delves deep. ?You know why my music sounds haunting? Because it is slow. When you board a train and take a window seat, you want the train to go slow so that you can see what?s outside and come back and recollect the images. Likewise, you can go back to my songs. All I need to produce my tunes is a good breakfast, a good lunch, a good nap and an appreciative film-maker. Appreciation triggers the creator inside me.?

 Kreem has his share of respect for Bollywood music directors. ?They have their own style and fan following. I like Rahman?s work too ? he is versatile, creates hummable tunes and is very good with orchestration and percussion. My problem is that I cannot work with a lot of people. I am a bit sensitive and cannot create melodies in public. I can only collaborate with one person and that is the director. Then I work with my singers. If they are technical, they can read the notations and I need to sit with them for just half-an-hour. But if they are non-technical, I may have to go for a three-four hour sitting.?

 The reason why Kreem identifies with the Bhatt camp is the Osho connection. ?I believe a lot in Osho like Bhatt saab. His preachings are so different from other jagat gurus. So like-minded people like the Bhatts and me get associated quite naturally and also, the association lasts longer.?

 Right now, it is the disease named Rog that Kreem is high on. ?The film is a murder mystery and belongs to the Jism genre. Since Jism did so well, they (the Bhatts) wanted to do one more film like it. Of course, with a different story. There was a lot of scope for music and I hope everyone likes what I have done.?

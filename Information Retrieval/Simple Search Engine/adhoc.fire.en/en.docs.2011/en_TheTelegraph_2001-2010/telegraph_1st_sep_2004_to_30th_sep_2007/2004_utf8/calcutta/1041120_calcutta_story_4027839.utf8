The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Age no bar for star

 As he walks out of the make-up room and stoops to touch Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s feet, you realise this non-resident Bengali has not severed his roots altogether. On the sets of Dasgupta?s Kalpurush, old friends from the Tollygunge studios keep dropping by to catch up with him. There?s some backslapping, a good laugh over an old joke or just that smile. The one that hurtles you back to the black-and-white days of Mrinal Sen?s Mrigaya, from where a dark, lanky youth with a piercing gaze and a smile to die for set out on his silver screen journey.

 ?Calcutta grips me with nostalgia. So at the smallest pretext, I try to sneak into the city and catch up with friends,? says Mithun Chakraborty, who has long made Ooty his home. Faced with the ?most challenging role? of his career now, the star says he?s a tad worried about how good he will be able to deliver the role of a ?timeless man?.

 ?Often there?s so much left unsaid even till the last breath of our lives? This man I play exists somewhere between the past and the present and has many things untold,? he smiles.

 The role of a freedom fighter in Tahader Katha, the Dasgupta film that fetched him a National Award as best actor, could be handled with a lot more ease, he believes. ?That at least had a definite character. Here, if I tilt the balance even a little, the character is not going to remain the same. Rahul (Bose) plays my son and he is very cooperative. We rehearse our lines together,? adds the star.

 The maturity, they say, has come with the years and with looking at life up close and very personal. It?s also why Mithun manages to hold on to the couple of art films that occasionally comes his way and also the dozens of commercial releases that bear his trademark style.

 For there has been a Gudiya (director Goutam Ghose) and a Titli (director Rituparno Ghosh) in between those low-cost second-grade masala mixes churned out with alarming regularity. And even as Mithun plays an ageing father to Rahul Bose, his fan brigade ensures Coolie and Devdoot run the course at local cinemas.

 Once the Kalpurush shoot is through, there?s Kalpana Lajmi?s forthcoming film awaiting him. ?I have a terrific role in Lajmi?s film, co-starring Sushmita Sen. But I can?t disclose details now,? is all he will say. The film, reportedly titled Chingari, goes on the floors in February.

 And yet at 50-plus, Mithun still packs in enough energy to go through the motions of song-and-dance routine for every commercial film that he signs. There are around 20 of them either on or in the offing. 

 Doesn?t that take a toll? ?Not at all. I am fit as ever as I maintain a strict diet and workout for 10 minutes everyday. And my film and no dance number? Is that ever possible? But right now, I am surviving on the dividends of being a superstar,? chuckles the evergreen disco dancer.

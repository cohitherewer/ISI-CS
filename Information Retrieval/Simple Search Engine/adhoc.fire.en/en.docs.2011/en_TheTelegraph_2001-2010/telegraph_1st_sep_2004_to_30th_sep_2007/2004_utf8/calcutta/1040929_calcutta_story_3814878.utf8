The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sumantra Choudhury

 Principal secretary, department of transport, government of West Bengal

 We cannot perhaps force people to avail of car pools in a democratic set-up. This is impossible. But there are other ways to deal with congestion. There are 25 lakh private vehicles in Bengal, of which 15 lakh are two-wheelers. Here one out of 20 people owns a car. The per-capita figure in the UK is two. When I was in London this June, I saw how they have a traffic tax of ?5 to enter the central business district of the city. We have stopped giving permits for new bus routes at Esplanade, Howrah bridge, Howrah station, BBD Bag and Bandstand areas. We can identify some areas where we can bar small vehicles from entering. Or, there can be a tax of say, Rs 50, to enter Dalhousie Square. If we ask people not to bring out their cars or forbid their entry in some areas, we have to ensure an improved public transport system. We are starting a light rail transit and the east-west Metro corridor. Perhaps this will induce more people to use public transport.

 Notes on a special evening

Thursday night saw a lot of firsts at Someplace Else 

(SPE), with Anjan Dutt and His Music Folk celebrating the songwriters? evening, 

aptly titled Poet And The Band. Of the 250-odd guests who squeezed in to celebrate 

the magic of the urban folk legends, there were some very known faces and their 

unknown voices.

 If Aparna Sen taking the stage was the high point, those on the sidelines cheering the Dutts (Anjan and son Neel) included a range as varied as actress June and industrialist Russi Mody. Late, but there all right was Rupa Ganguly, clapping and tapping to the Seegers and Dylans.

 Amidst the Tolly brigade that flooded the Park pub, there was a Bolly beat too. Jackie Shroff, in town for the shooting of Rituparno Ghosh?s Antarmahal, turned up quite early to hear Anjan sing. The first few moments were spent signing autographs (?Bangali jibone shikhbe na?, was one mumble overheard) while the rest were spent soaking in the SPE experience. ?I have been to Tantra before but this is more like the place I would like to spend time in,? confessed Jaggu dada.

 The most thanked man of the evening was Nondon Bagchi, with papa Dutt making it a point to thank the veteran drummer repeatedly for making SPE what it is. Nondon, on his part, was happy with this new development (Anjan?s debut and the accompanying excitement) at the 10-year-old pub at The Park.

 SPE favourites Neel Adhikary and Chirodeep Lahiri were there too, but on the other side of the music line.

 Anjan punctuated the musical soiree with some hard talk that covered everything from the Godhra riots to the Russian massacre. Very much like Buffy St Mary, one of the singers on song on Thursday night, they were ?songs of the soul from the belly?. In between his tributes to the Robsons and Baezs, he slipped in a couple of his own originals, the ever-popular Mizo Boy and Calcutta.

 But if there was one surprise package, it was son Neel, who impressed with his take on Paul Simon.

One gone and many more to come, the last Thursdays 

of every month should just be pencilled for the Poet and the Band.

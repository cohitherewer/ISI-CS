 - FIVE-DAY WORKSHOP, 25 DESTITUTE KIDS, A DRAMA OF COMMUNAL HARMONY

 The area: Dark rows of apparently deserted houses in a brick-mud lane off Thakurpukur. 

The arena: At the end of the same lane, a group 

of children singing and dancing in a pretty building complex, including patches 

of green, a park and a little pond. 

The aim: A play on the impact of communal violence 

on women and girls through a five-day residential workshop, with over 25 youngsters 

from under-privileged backgrounds. 

 The Action Aid project, held recently at the Indian Institute of Training and Development as part of the International Campaign to Stop Violence against Women and Girls, intended to bring together destitute children, between 11 and 16 years of age, and motivate them to respond to communal violence.

 Sourini Mridha of Action Aid said: ?Many girls at the workshop live on the streets. Continuously exposed to violence, their sensitivities have been numbed. For the first two days of the workshop, we had to first integrate these loners, through singing, dancing, sharing??

 Ayesha, 14, might have gone through an ordeal early in life at her modest home near Park Circus. But at the workshop, she looked totally in control, acting the role of a haughty girlfriend spurning her lover?s advances. Nodding her head, waving her hands and fidgeting with her hair, she played the part to perfection. ?I have never gone through such a programme before. Learning about body language, movements, voice-throwing, posture... It was interesting.?

 Being away from home for the first time, a few kids missed ?ma?, but most were elated with their new friends and all of them chorused that they were ?having a great time?. Ahead of their street performance on December 6, Mini and Bunni Das of Tangra were excited about doing everything together with kids their age, while 11-year-olds Jayanta, Debashish and Soumen said they have been having a ball, chatting till the wee hours.

 As older kids like Shubho, Arshad and Sunny fought over their favourites Shah Rukh and Salman, Dipak Barua, their trainer said: ?The children told me that at school, Hindus and Muslims might be friends, but they never eat together. However, here, we are like one big family, doing everything together. This, in itself, could be a sensitisation process.?

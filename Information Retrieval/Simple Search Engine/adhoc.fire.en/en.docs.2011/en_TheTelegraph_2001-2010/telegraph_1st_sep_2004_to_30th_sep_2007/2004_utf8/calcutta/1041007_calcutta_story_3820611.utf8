The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crusader for fading melody

 Nupurchhanda Ghosh

Her sons swear by Pink Floyd and Aerosmith. Bangla-band 

followers and music-lovers to the core, even they had reservations for her brand 

of music. But that did not deter singer Nupurchhanda Ghosh from trying to revive 

kirtans and almost-forgotten songs of Atul Prasad Sen, Rajanikanta Sen 

and Dwijendralal Roy.

 That she is on the right track was proved when a canteen-full of American students at a university in New York state swayed and thumped to the beat of Atul Prasad?s rhythmic number Jabo na, jabo na, jabo na ghorey.

 ?With the onslaught of jibonmukhi songs, Bangla band music and the ever-present Rabindrasangeet, it seems that the songs of Atul Prasad, Rajanikanta or DL Roy are fading out,? says Ghosh. ?But till our growing-up years this brand of music was so popular. It would be a terrible loss for Bengali music if the generations to come are unaware of this treasure trove,? adds Ghosh.

 And so began her journey to spread among the masses the magic of Atul Prasad, D.L. Roy and Rajanikanta and the magnetic rhythms of kirtans. 

 ?I grew up in our home in Southern Avenue which had a contagious musical atmosphere. Many well-known people would drop in for adda punctuated by songs,? says Ghosh. And it was the rich collection of her music-loving father which is now Ghosh?s mainstay in cultivating and researching music from the past.

 Apart from learning, practising and performing for years, Ghosh has taken her music overseas as well, through workshops and performances. 

 ?The most memorable trip was the one to Guadeloupe, a French island in the West Indies. We visited about 20 schools and interacted with more than 2,000 children,? recalls Ghosh. ?Our repertoire included songs of Atul Prasad, Rajanikanta and D.L. Roy which I performed while artists Babita and Tinku Das painted the themes on the canvas.? And even though the children knew only French, the experience was exhilarating.

 Ghosh realised that for people to remember this genre, it needed to be marketed properly. So, even in Calcutta she holds programmes where she sings the original songs, while an elocutionist reads out the Hindi and English transcreation of the Bengali lyrics and painters paint in the backdrop, who is experimenting with ancient kirtans by Dwijo Chandidas and others as well. ?The audience appreciate the new style of presentation.?

 With a book on the life of Atul Prasad already in her booty, she is now midway through writing another on Rajanikanta. Ghosh knows it will take time, but she is ready to give it her all.

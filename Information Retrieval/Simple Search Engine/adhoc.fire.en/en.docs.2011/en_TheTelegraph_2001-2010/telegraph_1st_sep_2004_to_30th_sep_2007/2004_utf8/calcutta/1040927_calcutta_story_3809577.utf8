The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sold on the scent of a woman

ZEESHAN JAWED

What 

happens when a show titled Long and Short Story turns out to be a tale of long 

legs and short dresses? Summer stages a comeback in autumn and winter seems three 

seasons away.

 The heat was well and truly on at Tantra this Saturday night as the Seagram?s fashion show dished out dressing down with a difference.

 The Park Street nightclub was packed to capacity well before the midnight hour, when the mayhem was scheduled to start. The DJs were busy at the turntables keeping the party animals in the groove and the bartenders were working overtime to keep pace with the countdown.

 Just as things seemed to settle a bit ? the exhaustion of anticipation, one guessed ? the madness was uncorked. Leggy lasses took to the bar-top in minute minis as if they belonged there and every eye at ground level remained on the makeshift ramp and upwards.

 As city models strutted the stuff of upcoming designer Pritam Panda, the shutterbugs zoomed in on an anatomy class and cell phones worked overtime to capture the curves.

 While some had the time of their lives, a few looked as if they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The best was saved for last ? well past the witching 

hour ? when two performers from Bombay, Niloufer Khan and Sharda, took up pole 

position and used the title track of Dhoom to create a lot of dhoom-dhadaka 

and give the Tata Youngs a run for their sound and sight.

 Percussionist Sivamani, in town for the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) conference, missed the action as he dropped in after the fashion fun was all done.

 Fragrant fun

 In today?s day and craze, shopping for perfumes is primary on the priority list. So, several premier brands are dropping anchor in our metropolis that finds itself in the grip of a mall mania.

 Incognito at Taj Bengal was the venue for the launch of Davidoff Cool Water Deep. 

 Actresses Koneenica and Chandreyee did the star turn by striking a pretty pose with bottles of Cool Water in hand before playfully playing the spraying game.

 The point of this new perfume, they say, is that the cool water runs deep. With this Davidoff in your bag, you can explore a whole new world of waves beneath the surface of cool water.

 The cost of this cool water at Shoppers? Stop (Forum) is: Rs 2,400 for 50 ml and Rs 3,300 for 100 ml. For men, the after shave comes for Rs 2,150 and the hair and body wash for Rs 1,130.

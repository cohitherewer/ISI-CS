 The case of the old seamen?s church, later a clinic, in Hastings, which was auctioned in the ?50s for a ridiculous sum of Rs 7,000, and that went to rack and ruin after the clinic was told to vacate the building in 1996, is coming up for hearing for the umpteenth time in Calcutta High Court on Thursday. 

 The derelict building at 6, Clyde Row, in Hastings, which was an old seafarers? chapel and later a seamen?s clinic under the Seamen?s Welfare Association (SWA), has turned into a haven of criminals and squatters.

 There are gaping holes above the ground floor of this two-storeyed building with three arching entrances. A plaque at the entrance reads: Indian Seamen?s Clinic, Seamen?s Welfare Association, Free Treatment Centre.

 The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which had taken over charge of the building in 1954, is squarely to blame for its present state. 

 In 1939, the building was acquired by the SWA from the Calcutta Diocesan Trust Association.

 The management and control of the premises were handed over to the port health officer (PHO) in 1948 for a nominal rent of Re 1 per month payable to the SWA, and payment of ground rent, municipal taxes and carrying out repairs was the liability of the PHO, terms approved by the director-general of health services (DGHS) under the Central ministry of health. 

 Though the CPWD had taken over control of the premises (maintenance and paying taxes) from the DGHS under the Central ministry of health in 1954, the PHO continued to run the Seamen?s clinic on the same premises. But the CPWD had neglected to pay ground rent totalling Rs 271 and 5 annas from April 1, 1954 to September 30, 1957, to the state government through the Khasmahal collector, 24-Parganas. And for this offence, the Khasmahal certificate officer sold the building by auction on May 22, 1957 for Rs 7,000 to R.K. Burman.

 Perhaps smelling a rat, on August 28, 1957, the Government of India, through the executive engineer, CPWD, filed a petition along with the SWA to set aside the sale on November 13. The appeals were dismissed and at a higher level, too, by the assistant district collector, 24-Parganas, as well as the commissioner, Presidency Range.

 However, the Additional Member, Board of Revenue, allowed the petition in February 2, 1960 and sent the case back to the Khasmahal officer for hearing the petition. But Burman filed an appeal before Calcutta High Court against this order.

 The Union of India (UOI) through the executive engineer, CPWD filed a petition to be party in the civil suit which was granted. On June 12, 1962, the rule was made absolute by Calcutta High Court, quashing the order of the Additional Member, Board of Revenue.

 In the next seven years, the SWA took no steps against the order dated June 18, 1962. The UOI?s appeal through the executive engineer, CPWD, was dismissed on June 21, 1963. Despite the legal wrangle the PHO ran the clinic there all the while.

 On July 16, 1969, Burman?s lawyer served a notice to the UOI to vacate the premises within two months. In September 1969, the civil suit was filed. Thereafter, various proceedings have taken place over the past 25 years to set aside the auction by both the UOI and the executive engineer of the CPWD. An ex-parte decree in favour of R.K. Burman was passed on April 28, 1994, which was subsequently set aside.

 Obtaining the certified copy of the order, another legal notice was served on the secretary, ministry of works, housing and supply, executive engineer, CPWD on September 3, 1999. A copy of the notice was sent to the PHO by the CPWD.

 Till then, the PHO was not party to the case. In June 1996, the executive engineer of the CPWD advised the PHO to shift the clinic as the building was dilapidated. 

 It moved to Marine House for repairs of the chapel, which never happened. In the meantime, the PHO came to know that Burman had filed a suit for possession of the building. 

 Thereafter, on July 13, 2001, the PHO filed a petition to be an added defendant, which was allowed by the high court on October 12.

 As third defendant, the PHO filed an affidavit on March 14, 2002 and an amended petition was filed by R.K. Burman on March 26, 2002. 

 The SWA has washed its hands of the case as it cannot afford to go to court. Whatever the outcome may be, the PHO was in possession of the building from 1948 to 1996, and is symbolically in possession of it even today.

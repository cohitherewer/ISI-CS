 Firsts galore from the Factory floor

 Abhishek and Antara in stills from Naach 

 His dream is to release one film every Friday. While that might not happen just yet, Ram Gopal Varma and his Factory are ready with a handful of films that should automatically stand out from what is being dished out in Bollywood. Here are some of his forthcoming products yes, thats what the maker of Satya and Bhoot calls his films

 Naach

 Directors: Kiran Reddy and Ram Gopal Varma

 Cast: Abhishek Bachchan, Antara Mali

 Plot peek: Expect the unexpected, proclaims the tagline. Revolves around Abhi, a wannabe film actor, and Rewa, a struggling choreographer. Abhi does not mind selling his soul to make it big, Rewa wants to stick to her principles.

 Selling points: A bravura performance from Chhota B and Antaras in-your-face sex appeal, the Abhishek-Antara liplock, music by Amar Mohile. If Rangeela was light as a feather, Naach is tough as nails, claims Varma.

Status report: To release in November (could 

be Diwali).

 Sarkaar

 Director: Ram Gopal Varma

 Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan

 Plot peek: Touted as Ramus faithful version of The Godfather, it highlights the story of a patriarch and his family honour rather than glorify the mafia. To be produced by financier Bharat Shah, the budget is close to the Rs 20-crore mark.

 Selling points: Two firsts Bachchans playing father-son on screen and Varma directing the Big B.

Status report: Shooting on.

 Vaastu Shastra

 Director: Sourabh Narang

 Cast: Sushmita Sen, Chakravarthy

 Plot peek: To seek solitude, writer Virag goes to a farmhouse called Shanti Kutir in Saswade, a village 30 km from Pune. When his wifes sister and her boyfriend get killed, its time to wake up... 

 Selling points: Chakravarthy (Satya) returns to the Varma camp and the scare quotient rises. I want to scare the hell out of the audience, says Ramu. Try the tagline: If Bhoot scared you, this will kill you!

Status report: October release.

 Darna Zaroori Hai

 Directors: Nana Patekar, E. Niwas, Sajid Khan, Chandan Arora, Sriram Raghavan and Prawaal Raman

 Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Arjun Rampal, Bipasha Basu, Antara Mali

 Plot peek: A sequel to Prawaal Gayab Ramans directorial debut Darna Mana Hai, it has six separate stories. But this time, each of the stories is being filmed by a different director. The extended star cast promises to outshine the previous movie.

 Selling points: More than the stars, the directors hold the key here. Apart from Sajid Khan, who makes his debut with his 16-minute episode, the others are mostly second timers. Nana returns after Prahaar, Arora after Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon and Raghavan post Ek Hasina Thi. 

Status report: Stuck at post-production.

 Murder At Shri Krishna Building: Galti Se and Jaan Boojh Ke

 Director: J.J. Philips

 Cast: Anil Kapoor, Suchitra Krishnamurthy

 Plot peek: The only joy in the life of Ravi Patwardhan is his job, where he works along with his faithful assistant Reena. Constantly pestered at home by a mistrusting wife, one day, he gets pushed too far.

 Selling points: The first of a kind, the film is being split into two for two distinct endings. To be released as two separate films, Galti Se and Jaan Boojh Ke, one has Ravi killing his wife intentionally and by accident in the other. 

 Varma claims that as much as 30 per cent of the two films will be different from each other and will be screened alongside each other, in the same multiplex.

 Status report: At the post-production stages.

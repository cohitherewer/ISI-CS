Behind the bar

 DJ / Assistant F amp; B manager, Hilton Towers, 

Mumbai

I don?t believe in playing around with classical cocktails. 

You should not try to improvise on them, just as it is not advisable to experiment 

with classical music. As you would not innovate on a Bach fugue, similarly don?t 

try to create new cocktails from existing ones. If you want to test your creativity, 

try inventing new concoctions. And for this you have to be prepared to spend crazy 

hours behind the bar and acquire in-depth knowledge of flavours, textures, colours 

and properties of various drinks.

My passion for cocktails really started after I won 

the first prize at a cocktail competition in Delhi for two consecutive years in 

1995 and 1996. Then I went on to train under a Spanish expert in London where 

I learnt how cocktail mixing can be turned into an art form. Now, I am working 

with the Hilton Towers in Mumbai and using all the techniques I learnt there.

All my drinks have teasing, exotic names. While some 

appeal only to women, others are a great hit with hardcore drinkers as well. When 

I make a drink I ensure that there is a lot of crushed ice so it can swing and 

keep you high. 

The recipes that I am sharing here are from the new 

menu that I have introduced at The Oberoi Grand. The Caipi Roschaa is known as 

a Brazilian?s favourite drink. It is for those who want to have something on the 

rocks. It is tasty, yet gives a fast high. This is the first drink I had learnt 

from my Spanish master. The other one, Swimming Pool, is visually quite appealing 

and is literally the colour of a pool.

Caipi Roschaa

Ingredients: 

Vodka, lime, white and brown sugar

Method: Take chunks 

of lime, the vodka and white and brown sugar in a cocktail shaker and shake it 

well with crushed ice. Serve in an old-fashioned rock glass.

Swimming pool

Ingredients: 

Vodka, Blue Curacao, lime juice (freshly squeezed), coconut milk

Method: Pour the vodka 

into the shaker, add the Blue Curacao and pineapple juice. Squeeze in fresh lime. 

Add a dash of coconut milk only to get the right colour. Serve in a tall glass.

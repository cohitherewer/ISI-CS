The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 You have seen him doing mushy stuff. You have seen him doing the karaoke. You have seen him playing Bond. Now you?ll get to see Hussain (picture left) get into the Alibaba act.

 Yes, the Mumbai bloke is the new host of Khulja Sim Sim, the Star Plus game show that went off air last October. ?I am really excited to say those magic words on the small screen,? said Hussain, who came to Calcutta with the K. Street Pali Hill team on Wednesday.

 A couple of weeks ago, there was this controversy brewing about Aman Verma, former host of the show, waiting for it to be re-launched and refusing other assignments. ?I am really in no position to comment,? smiled Hussain.

 So will he be just stepping into the shoes of Verma or will the show (based on the popular game show Let?s Make A Deal, with prizes like cars and household appliances) go for a complete revamp on return? ?The basic format of the show will be the same. I will be saying ?khulja sim sim?, there will be doors opening up and there will also be prizes galore. But, yes, the treatment and stylisation will be quite different.? 

 The model who ventured into the world of showbiz only at the insistence of his friends also sees a future in films. ?I do not mind taking up films but they have to be big. After Khulja Sim Sim, I can only do something which is bigger and better.? 

Brande: Babe watch

 If there?s one Bollywood film that has edged past its original inspiration it must be Raj Kumar Hirani?s Munnabhai MBBS. The Vidhu Vinod Chopra production was not only more popular than the Robbin Williams-starrer Patch Adams, but it went on to be made in Tamil and Telugu. And now the rights of the script have even been sold to Hollywood.

 While you need not bother about who will reprise Sanjay Dutt?s role in the English version, you can definitely catch the world television premiere of Munnabhai MBBS on Zee TV this Sunday at 8 pm. 

 You can also catch the making of the film prior to the screening, where the cast and crew talk about their experiences and spill some interesting beans.

 The film does boast of a lot of firsts ? Vidhu Vinod Chopra produces a film but does not direct it, Sunil Dutt returns to the silver screen after a prolonged hiatus for a special jadoo ki jhappi with his son for the first time on 35 mm.

So, M bole to...

 Bollywood will never learn. When Vashu Bhagnani roped 

in Brande Roderick for one of his two female leads in Out of Control, he 

must have known her for the Playboy playmate she is. After all, there was 

so much of her to see in Baywatch. Then, why make her dress up like a gaon 

ki gori and force her to mouth words that didn?t sound even remotely like 

Hindi?

 Well, Out of Control spun miserably out of control and Bhagnani stopped producing films in the assembly-line fashion he would sell saris some years ago. But poor Brande ? she couldn?t make her dream Bollywood debut. 

 Leaving the likes of David Hasselhoff and running around trees with Ritesh Deshmukh was surely too big a price to pay. To be fair, though, Brande was the best thing about the film (even if she was wearing so much extraaa).

 The Baywatch babe is more at home, though, making a cameo appearance as a cheerleader in the latest comedy in town Starsky and Hutch. 

 Playing Heather, the dead man?s girlfriend, she is on screen for less than a couple of minutes but, boy, does she make her presence felt! How? Simple, by refusing to be camouflaged in clothes. 

 The locker room goes all silent as our babe Brande struts out in nothing but her birthday suit while Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson can do nothing but gape. Talk about Starky, Starsky and Hutch.

 Having smashed the national box-office record thrice and screened over 150 films, the city?s first four-screen multiplex on Elgin Road is gearing up for its first anniversary on September 26.

 But before that, INOX Forum uncorks a surprise package for the buyer of its one millionth ticket. The lucky cine-goer gets a two-night-three-day free stay at Taj Bengal, unlimited Refuel food, tickets to a special screening of The Terminal on Tuesday and the privilege of cutting the anniversary cake. The three-week-long festivity features DJ gigs and contests.

Charlie?s Angels 2: Full Throttle will not 

be telecast on HBO in India on September 26, as mentioned earlier. The film is 

on the channel?s Asia beam, but does not form part of its India feed. Wait a while, 

boys.

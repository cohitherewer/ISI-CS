 Box-office booms for love

 Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in Veer-Zaara: Family fare and hot faveMadhubala in a poster of Mughal-e-Azam: Surprise second in Diwali release quartet

 The first weekend is over. The initial results are out. The four-in-one Diwali dhamaka has thrown up one clear winner at the Bollywood box-office after three days: Veer-Zaara.

 Proof of the popularity pull: the only thing that kept Calcuttans away from Eden Gardens or the small screen was Yash Chopra?s ?New Love Legend?, which recorded 100 per cent bookings at the multiplexes on Saturday. 

 The Shah Rukh Khan-Preity Zinta cross-border affair to remember (he is Veer, she Zaara) has made close to twice the business of the other three Diwali Friday releases: Subhash Ghai?s Aitraaz, Ram Gopal Varma?s Naach and the all-colour Mughal-e-Azam.

 If Veer-Zaara ? with a record number of 25 prints ? went house-full in most single-screen theatres across the city, at the multiplexes it scored around 95 per cent collections. ?The buzz is very strong and it caters to that all-important family crowd. We are looking at at least 10 to 12 weeks,? says 89 Cinemas general manager Prashant Srivastava.

 The missive from Mumbai is on the same lines. Says trade expert Taran Adarsh: ?Veer-Zaara is way ahead in the race and with no new releases in the next week, it should easily be able to sustain the success.?

 From khushi to gham. Varma?s ?mature love story? Naach starring Abhishek Bachchan and Antara Mali (lots of her at that) has missed more than a step with collections plummeting to as low as 22 per cent at INOX (City Centre).

 Mukta Arts? Aitraaz, directed by Abbas-Mastan, has taken a decent start (62 per cent in all the multiplexes till Sunday), but the decision to take Veer-Zaara head-on has backfired. 

 ?It?s still the dark horse, but had it released on another Friday, it would have been a bigger hit,? says Adarsh, of Akshay Kumar being framed by ex-flame Priyanka Chopra.

 The only challenge to Chopra comes in the surprise form of 44-year-old Mughal-e-Azam. With a healthy 68 per cent (second only to Veer-Zaara) in the first three days at 89 Cinemas, it?s a big draw in Mumbai, too. 

 ?The signs are very good. If it has been at number two in the Ramazan period, we expect it to give Veer-Zaara tougher competition post-Id,? says Deepesh Salgia, director of the project that sheds new light on the Dilip Kumar-Madhubala epic.

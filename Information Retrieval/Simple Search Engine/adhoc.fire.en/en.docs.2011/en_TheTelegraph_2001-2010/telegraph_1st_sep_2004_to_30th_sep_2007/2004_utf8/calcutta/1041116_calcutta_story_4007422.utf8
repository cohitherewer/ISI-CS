 Threads of tradition

Smita Roy Chowdhury 

 Model Shonal Rawat is adorned in saris from the traditional stable of Tantuvi. The magenta and yellow saris draped on either shoulder have intricate work on the borders in the form of leaves, using beaten silver ribbons, while the purple and red sari uses contrasting colours for effect. Each of the drapes has been influenced by the durbar traditions of the Mughal rulers 

 It?s a simple thread coated in silver and gilded in gold. And it can work wonders when intermingled with just about any kind of fabric. The lustre of real zari is truly unparalleled and it?s this splendour that will unfurl itself at Finesse studio in Alipore on Tuesday. 

 The studio on New Road is hosting Tantuvi, a one-day exhibition of hand-woven heritage saris by Mumbai-based designer Smriti Morarka between 10 am and 7 pm. The exhibition will be inaugurated by first lady Anjana Shah. 

 ?This is my third showing in Calcutta. I have been hosting exhibitions here every alternate year since 2000,? informs Smriti, whose association with the city goes much beyond her exhibitions. Sister of industrialist Harsh Neotia, Smriti was brought up in Calcutta and moved to Mumbai in 1984 after marriage.

 The student of history always had the passion to do something with a ?social overtone?. ?I belong to a family of art collectors and oil painting was a hobby since childhood. I wanted to do something using my creativity as well as give back a little to the society. But I didn?t see myself actively involved in social service. So, I somehow landed up reviving the traditional weaves of Varanasi and supporting the weavers? community there,? she says.

 Smriti?s label, also called Tantuvi, primarily produces saris and some lehngas by order. All the saris are woven in handlooms by weavers in Varanasi, using traditional elements like brocade, meenakari and jamdani, all with real zari. Brocade is a weave that intermingles gold and silver zari, while meenakari uses coloured thread along with zari and jamdani is a zari version of the traditional weave used in Dhakai saris.

 The fabrics Smriti uses are silks and various derivatives of silks like organza, georgette, chinon and Chinia (a particular kind of Chinese silk with a matte texture) and some cottons too. ?I myself wear saris 365 days and I think the fall of a sari is most important from the wearer?s point of view. So, I experiment with threads till I get the perfect fall for a sari,? she adds.

 For this exhibition, Smriti has worked with a lot of vibrant colours since she feels ?Calcuttans like a lot of bright hues?. So, the palette includes everything from reds, pinks and yellows to purples, greens and blacks. She also has a lot of thick silks in her kitty, ideal for winter. 

 so on display is a range of accessories that Smriti has put together for the first time on an ?experimental basis?. There are exquisite shoes, purses and cell phone holders, created from the same weaves as the saris. ?I am not into designing accessories seriously. But I just wanted people to look at handlooms in a more comprehensive manner and understand its scope. My purpose will be served if people make use of handlooms in more ways,? she smiles.

 Business has been difficult for the shrinking weavers? community of Varanasi. ?While the government protects certain families who are pioneers in certain kinds of weaves, there are hundreds of others who are extremely skilled, but don?t get proper support. Many of the younger ones are moving on to other professions because they think weaving is no longer profitable. I am trying to expand my unit whenever possible to accommodate as many as I can,? she sighs.

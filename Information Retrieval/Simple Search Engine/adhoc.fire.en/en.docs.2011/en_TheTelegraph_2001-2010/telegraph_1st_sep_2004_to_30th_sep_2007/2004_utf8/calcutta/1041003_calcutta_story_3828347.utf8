 Good life of good doctor

 AdLib

 SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

 He was young and handsome. His 

 bright and intelligent eyes touched you every time they 

 spoke. And to top it all, he was rare species: a doctor 

 on a holiday. I met him at a friend?s place in a posh Worli 

 highrise. He is an Indian doctor who had just come in from 

 London. I am sure the generous servings of Glen Morangie 

 by our host helped, but the discussion really flowed on 

 its own. I thought I would check with him the state of the 

 well-being industry in UK.

 The American worker who flew into 

 Delhi to get his valve transplant done was certainly on 

 my mind. He spent $ 20,000 in Delhi instead of $ 200,000 

 in the US. I was checking with my young friend whether things 

 were as bad as this in the UK also. His explanation was 

 simple, patent laws being what they are in the West prices 

 are bound to be higher.

 I thought I would check with him 

 how he feels about his fraternity in India. The horror stories 

 are plenty ? unnecessary pathological tests, wrong diagnosis, 

 making patients stay for a longer period than necessary 

 in the nursing home... He knew about all these, having left 

 this country not too long back.

 His defence began with a cricketing 

 analogy. A wicket-keeper in a One-Day match conceding 18 

 byes often makes the headlines. No one remembers that he 

 made no mistake with the balance 282 balls. Nor is the wicket-keeper?s 

 exact contribution to those byes ever discussed. Doctors 

 possibly suffer from the same fate. Horror stories make 

 the rounds and the 282 balls that are neatly collected, 

 some of them difficult catches down the legside, rarely 

 applauded.

 Anonymous surgeries 

 or star clients, a doctor?s job is like a wicket-keeper?s 

 Today, a doctor is very much a 

 part of a business system, he therefore has to belong to 

 it as well. More importantly, the system has given incentives 

 to the doctor as well, in terms of a share of the revenue 

 that the doctor generates.

 The popular criticism is why should 

 the doctors fall prey to such financial lures? Our young 

 friend became very animated at this stage. He said the doctor 

 is tired of carrying this torch of selflessness on the shoulder. 

 The whole concept of becoming a doctor to serve the people 

 has always been a myth. If not in cash or kind, at least 

 in terms of social importance doctors have always extracted 

 their pound of flesh.

 More than ever before, today it 

 is a career option and it is expected to yield a good life 

 for the doctor. And the definition of good life does not 

 change for the doctors. Like their patients, doctors too 

 see the ads for Honda or Hyundai, Sony or Samsung, Hitachi 

 or Haier. And these stimuli that provoke the patient, titillates 

 his doctor as well. Doctors are consumers too ? we have 

 no right to refuse them that right.

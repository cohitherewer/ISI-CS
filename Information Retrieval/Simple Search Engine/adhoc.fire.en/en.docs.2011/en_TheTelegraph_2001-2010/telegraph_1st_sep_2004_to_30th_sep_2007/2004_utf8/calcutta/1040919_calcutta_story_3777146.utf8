The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Friends, eclectic in deed

 You may like their slick, succinct style. Or slam them as abrupt and disjoint. But the five men who make these experimental video films just to satisfy their creative cravings have succeeded in generating a surge of awareness about this unconventional art form in Calcutta.

 For Abhijit Gupta, Aditya Basak, Prabhat Basu, Aveek Mukhopadhyay and Sanjeet Chowdhury ? who call themselves The Eclectic Crew ? video art provides the scope to play around with images, sounds and animation in their own styles, at their own pace.

 For the past four years, the five have been shooting their subjects with handycams and churning out short films that defy the conventional idioms of form and narrative. Three of their films ? Sanjeet?s Interpersonality, Aveek?s Glich and Abhijit?s The Third Schedule ? will be screened at the IInd Indo-British Digital Film Festival at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, starting October 4.

 Pioneered in the West and particularly in Germany, video art is widely practised by artists abroad and is supported by museums and art galleries.

 ?The form is thriving in Mumbai and Delhi as well, but in Calcutta it lacks a platform. Of late, institutions like the British Council and Chitrabani, plus film studies students, have started responding to this genre of film-making,? says Aditya, a freelance visual artist.

 ?There were few who wanted to showcase our works when we started off in 2001. The exception was Max Muller Bhavan which hosted our first exhibition,? says ad film-maker Sanjeet, for whom video art became an escape route from the drudgery of everyday work (?and also because I am not answerable to anyone for making these films?).

 It all began over an adda in 2001, when the friends decided to pool in funds and explore this medium. ?For Abhijit and myself, video art was a logical extension of our work. But we were complete greenhorns then, and we would have Sanjeet and Aveek guiding us on how to write scripts,? reveals Abhijit. The spacious and aesthetically done up Lansdowne Road apartment of this visual artist is where the five try to catch up at least once a week.

 The Eclectic Crew shares ideas at the addas and discards those that don?t suit its pocket. But the aim is to make at least two films each a year. 

 Of the bunch, cinematographer Aveek is at present busy behind the camera for Rituparno Ghosh?s Antarmahal, while visual artist Prabhat has shifted base to the UK.

 Among themselves, the group has churned out nine films in the past few years and hopes to stitch together an hour-long collaborative film soon. 

 For these sticklers of the ?art for art?s sake? camp, the creative freedom of video art is all they cherish and thrive on.

Sold for a song

 A $14 Paul McCartney Encyclopaedia for Rs 95, Formula One: The Autobiography worth Rs 1,868 for Rs 295, Britannica Encyclopaedia Concise priced at Rs 3,000 for Rs 495? The list of titles is astonishing, and the prices unbelievable.

 The occasion: a week and more of amazing discounts at Emami Landmark that began on September 11. The reason: a stock-clearance sale. No ads or public announcements, only word of mouth. But the number of titles being snapped off the shelves daily proved that was more than enough.

 ?From time to time, a lot of older stock accumulates with West End, our sister concern which imports most of these books,? explains Gautam Jatia, CEO of Landmark, ?and in this way, we can clear that stock?. 

 The emphasis, unlike other sales, isn?t on pushing products that have little chance of getting sold. Instead, at the Landmark sale, many couldn?t believe their eyes at the books on offer ? some at 80 per cent discount.

 ?I bought a hardcover edition of The Beatles Anthology for Rs 395 which costs around Rs 1,800 otherwise,? says a young executive. ?I had been looking for the title for a long time??

 Precisely the point Jatia would like to make: ?The customer should really feel that it?s a good deal. This will help us earn his trust and make him return to us.?

 On offer at the sale ? till September 20 ? are books on interior design, fiction, sports, music, business, encyclopaedias, self-help and coffee-table books. Thus, the Grishams and Archers find their place beside Bill Gates The Speed of Thought or Legends of Cricket.

The sale spirit has spread to other sections, too. In progress is a sale on audio CDs and computer games. Here, too, music from the likes of Aerosmith, George Michael, Elton John and even an odd Jack Bruce or two is priced between Rs 95 and Rs 295.

PC-games include the very popular though slightly 

older games like Quake II or Serious Sam and multiple game packs at Rs 95 onwards.

 Under cover: Meghna Naidu buttons up to woo 

Bengal

See-through short top, hyper-kinetic hips and a camera 

feasting on her curves is all she reminds you of, but the Kaliyon ka chaman 

 girl has other plans to woo the Calcutta crowd. Dolled up in sankha, sindoor 

and sari, Meghna Naidu plays pativrata to Mithun Chakraborty in Coolie. 

To catch the rich bitch falling in love with a coolie, head for Radha, Purna, 

Aruna or Ajanta.

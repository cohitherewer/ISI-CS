 Make-up man Prabir De captures the essence of Ashtami

 Being in the thick of the Pujas, going for anjali to the para pandal in the morning, getting set to glam up in the evening is what makes Ashtami special. This is the time to take out the best of your shopping, whether Indian or western (with an ethnic touch of course), and to pull out your fancy precious finery from the lockers.

 To capitalise on the mood, one must get the make-up basics right, so that when you hit town your face, along with your clothes, stands out in a crowd. Make-up artiste Prabir De ? with the help of model Sanjukta ? demonstrates just how you could do this at home.

Step 1

Clean your face as usual and apply a light layer of 

foundation, ensuring the base is around the same tone as your skin. Dab a light 

powder all over your face and neck.

Step 2

 When it comes to the eyes, be extra careful to bring out the best. The season?s look is striking pastel shades that have a faint glimmer or shine. Apply an adequate amount of dark mauve and silver eye shadow over the upper eyelids. Outline the eyes with a kohl pencil to provide increased depth. Use gold eye-shadow around the corners and give a final flourish with silver highlighter. Mascara is a must and be sure to use ample amounts of it.

Step 3

 Use a light mauve lipstick or a shade of purple that suits your complexion. Finish it off with some nude gloss to give that sensuous touch.

Step 4

 The final make-up is the cheek embellishment. Apply a generous amount of fuschia or mauve (once more, ensure it suits your skin type and complexion) blush-on around those dimpled areas. 

Lock lustre

 Keep your hair tied rather than open on this traditional day. Those with long tresses can brush it back and make a high ponytail. It will look trendy and cute.

 If a low ponytail is more your style, go with a middle parting. Those with short hair will have to leave it open, but you might want to style it differently. To bring in that extra bit of colour these Pujas, light streaks would look rather chic.

Middle path

 Now that the war paint has been generously applied, it is time to take care of the clothes and accessories. The Indo-western look is suitable for this day, a kind of transition between casual Saptami and the ultra-ethnic days to come. And you could always add some pizzazz in the form of artificial oxidised or real silver jewellery.

 You are now ready to make heads turn on Ashtami.

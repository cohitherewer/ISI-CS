Feng Shui

 Pinky Kapoor

Q: My husband (DOB 15.04.1970) and I (DOB 

24.09.1974) are going to buy a new flat. How should we arrange the furniture and 

the kitchen? What colour scheme should we use for the interiors? Also, what are 

the best directions for placing goldfish, plants and the shoe rack? 

Nandini Ghose

The Solution: A heavy sofa in the living room 

should always be placed against a wall and never have its back facing the entrance. 

Heavy pieces of furniture in line with the door act as obstructions to the energy 

flow. Beds should never be in line with the bedroom door. Avoid placing the bed 

in the passageway of the energy or between two doors or windows. It is best to 

have the flat painted in neutral shades and then add colour in the form of accessories. 

The fire in the kitchen should always be in the east. The goldfish should be in 

the north to enhance career, east for good health and south-east for good cash 

flow. Green plants are perfect in the east and south-east. A shoe rack near the 

entrance is fine as long as no shoes are scattered around it.

Q: My date of birth is 03.02.1970 and my 

husbands is 07.04.1969. We would like to know how our zodiac animal figurines 

or pictures would help bring wealth and prosperity and in which direction should 

we place them so that they bring wealth and prosperity.

S. Ramakrishnan

The Solution: Both of you were born in the 

year of the Rooster. These Oriental zodiac animal signs express the nature, attributes 

and behaviour of those born during that period. Rooster is the symbol of capability, 

growth, attainment and accomplishment. People belonging to this sign appear to 

be self-confident, brave and have high aspirations. Their placement will not enhance 

your wealth and prosperity, but they will surely strengthen your self-confidence 

when placed in the north-east of the room or office desk.

 Goldfish should be placed in the north of a house 

to enhance career, east for good health and south-east for better cash flow

Q: I want to shift to a new, airy and warm 

house so my ailing fathers health improves. He is suffering from lung problems 

(DOB 29.06.1938). What should be the ideal directions and height of the flat? 

In which direction should his bedroom be? I also want to know the ideal directions 

of the entrance and kitchen.

Sumona Sarkar

The Solution: According to the pillars of destiny, 

your father is an extremely weak water person with no metal as support, which 

might be causing the problem. Occupying a room in the west would be beneficial. 

The ruling metal energy of this direction will help strengthen him. Surround him 

with blue. Make him sleep on blue sheets and preferably on a metal bed. Make sure 

the ceiling is not very low. The flat could face his favourable direction, which 

is the north-east. Facing north-west while eating will help him regain his health 

fast. The Chinese believe a doctor comes from heaven to heal a person if he faces 

his health direction while eating. Kitchens should ideally be in the eastern part 

of the house.

Q: We are constructing a new house and would 

like to know where the bathrooms should be located.

Madhu Jaiswal

The Solution: The bathrooms should certainly 

not be the first thing that meets the eye on entering the house. Avoid having 

them in the north-east, south-east and south-west. Never have them in the centre 

of the house as the negative energy from the heart of the house radiates in all 

directions. They should never be built above a bedroom and avoid having them over 

a cooking stove or the main door. They should not face a bedroom, kitchen or a 

temple door. The ventilation of the bathrooms is as important as the directions. 

With adequate ventilation, negative energy in this area keeps moving out, whereas 

windowless bathrooms are a storehouse of negative energy. Ensure the doors and 

windows of the bathroom do not open into bedrooms.

Basudeb Pal: It has been quite sometime since the roof of the Town Hall collapsed. What steps have been taken towards reconstruction of the roof and by when would work end?

 The Town Hall is among the nine heritage buildings in Howrah. The extent of rust and moisture that had gripped the building could not be ascertained from outside. It was only after the collapse that we could do so. Howrah Sansad has promised a sum of Rs 24 lakh for restoration. The heritage committee of the Howrah Municipal Corporation has made a detailed study and will submit a restoration plan soon, according to which we will go ahead.

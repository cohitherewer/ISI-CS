 Greek drama to chhou steps

 It?s a union of the best of classic West and folk East. Greek drama will match steps with chhou dance in a production that has brought one of the finest scholars of the language to the city.

 Robert Meagher, of Hampshire College, Massachusetts, is in town with a dream. He wants to see Aeschylus? Seven Against Thebes performed by dancers of a village in Purulia.

 It all started with Irene Papas, one of the greatest actresses that Greece has produced, commissioning Meagher to translate the play. ?The project never materialised but the fact that she had wanted it for a dance production left an impression on me,? says the 61-year-old teacher. 

 Meagher, camping in town since mid-October as a guest of the Shakespeare Society of Eastern India, was taken on a tour of Purulia. ?In remote Bagmundi, I witnessed a dazzling chhou recital by the local tribals. When my host Professor Amitava Roy told me about the martial myth of Mahishasuramardini that the dancers portrayed, I realised this would be the perfect dance form for the play on war and its horrors.?

 In Meagher?s mind, if the chorus expressing the male point of view is formed of chhou dancers, tusu and bhadu, a preserve of women, would portray the frenzy and terror of the Theban women when their city is under attack. ?Aeschylus being the oldest of the Greek dramatists, his works, with their focus on the chorus and choric movements, are truly dance dramas,? he reasons.

 The theologist offers another point of intersection between the two cultures ? Dionysius, the Greek god of wine, he contends, originates from Shiva.?Dionysius is called the most endearing and dangerous of the gods in Aeschylus? Bacchi. This image is appropriate for Shiva, the Supreme Destroyer, too. There are iconic parallels. Dionysius is known to transform into a bull that is Shiva?s chosen animal as well. Every drama festival in ancient Greece was preceded by the sacrifice of a goat, which was castrated first. There is a tradition of goat castration linked to Shiva as well,? he explains.

 Shiva?s consort, Durga, has given the Meaghers moments to treasure on their first visit to India. ?We offered flowers (anjali) to the goddess. My wife Elizabeth took part in the vermillion festival at the local puja. We joined an immersion procession. God is so dead in everyday life in the West. But here, amid the dancing and celebrations, I experienced the true choral experience that lies at the root of Greek drama.?

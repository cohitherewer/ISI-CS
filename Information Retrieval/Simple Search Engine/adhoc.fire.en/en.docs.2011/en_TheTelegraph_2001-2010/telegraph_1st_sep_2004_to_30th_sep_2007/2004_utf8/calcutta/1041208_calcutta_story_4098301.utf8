The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Even if a person is against a bandh in principle, he would be forced to stay away from work if there is no conveyance. Why should his salary be deducted? I remember if a train arrived late at Howrah, an office-going passenger could ask for the time of arrival in writing, which he would produce in office to avoid being marked late. My political career started in pre-Independence times. Even then there was no such system of deduction of salary in offices or strictures against strikes from the court. If one is injured on the way to work, would the court pay a compensation? In July 1946, the post amp; telegraph department struck work. In support of their demands, on July 29, a bandh was called. This was the biggest strike during our freedom struggle. The British did issue warnings but they never touched employees? wages. Today?s trend is a result of changes in world economy which are influencing even the judiciary.

 ?Abduction? foxes police 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The mysterious disappearance of Tumpa Adhikari, 17, a Class X student of Majhorpara Mullickbill High School, from Ichhapur, on the northern peripheries of the city, has left both the parents and the police in the dark. 

 Tumpa has been missing since Saturday evening, when she went for private tuition at Garulia. She is to take her Madhyamik examination next March. The Adhikaris have received two calls, demanding a ransom of Rs 5 lakh.

 The girl?s parents claim this is an abduction case and Tumpa?s father Swapan and her two uncles have lodged a complaint to the effect with Noapara police station. But the police believe there is more to it than meets the eye. 

 Eyewitnesses claim they last saw her walking down along the Ichhapur-Mohanpur police outpost around 5.30 pm on Saturday. Reconstruction of the case reveals that Tumpa was picked up in a vehicle, but police are yet to identify what kind of vehicle was used. 

 Soon after the disappearance, the Adhikaris received a call. Even before Tumpa?s uncle Nemai Adhikari, who reportedly took the call, could make out anything, the line was disconnected. 

 After waiting all night, Tumpa?s father and her two uncles reported the incident to Noapara police station on Sunday morning and a case was started accordingly.

 ?It?s still too early to comment. But we are working on a few leads. We are trying to talk to some of Tumpa?s friends for specific clues,? said Praveen Kumar, police superintendent of North 24-Parganas. 

 Police, however, are at a loss to identify the callers. The first call came on Saturday evening after Tumpa was abducted. The last one came on Sunday evening, when the caller warned them against installing a caller line identification machine and seeking police help. 

 Tumpa?s uncles claimed the callers had named different places in Nadia district where the cash should be handed over. They added that the exact location for handing over the money will be disclosed in due course. Police believe it is not a straightforward case because of the ?strange manner? in which the alleged kidnappers are behaving.

 Carnival call with trinket treasure 

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

It?s carnival time at Netaji Indoor Stadium, not just 

inside the Russian arena but spilling on to makeshift stalls selling colourful 

souvenirs outside. Battery-operated glow lockets and pens, clown noses, jester 

hats, hand puppets? There?s enough of the circus slice to take home for everybody 

(pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya).

 While kids freak out on sponge clown noses in bright colours, which can be easily slipped on and off thanks to elastic bands that hold them in place, the shiny lockets capture the imagination of just about everybody.

 Available in a variety of shapes like hearts, cartoon characters, cylinders and geometric designs, the trinkets come with an in-built bulb powered by a tablet battery. The transparent glass body of the locket is filled with gel and interesting eye-catchers swimming inside, like tiny slivers of paper, flowers or even seashells. You can turn the light on and off simply by turning the head of the locket as and when you wish to turn the heads around you.

 Where

Netaji Indoor Stadium

 How much

Rs 50 to Rs 200

If you want to carry the fun to work, there are glow gel pens that operate with the same mechanism. The switch on the cap of the tubular pen allows you to determine when you want to attract the attention of a dashing new face or lie low after a late lunch.

 The Russians hawking the wares know little English, but jester hats, shiny, colourful paper headgear and squeaky hand puppets beckon the curious Calcutta crowd. It?s all up for grabs, if you can make your way through the sea of tiny heads that is.

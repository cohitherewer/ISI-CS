 A positive appraisal of art

 Nothing can be more heartening to budding young artists than their efforts being encouraged and appreciated by those who have already earned respect and recognition in the same field. Avantika?s initiative to award artists of the new generation exemplifies a disposition which, apart from scouting and promoting fresh talent, generates a healthy competitive environment that induces participants to excel in their creativity. The ongoing 3rd Regional Art Exhibition 2004, hosted by Avantika, provides an opportunity to bring these young talents to the spotlight. Prominent personalities of the present art milieu, including Subhash Roy, Sovon Som, B.R. Paneswar, Ramananda Bandopadhyaya and Dipankar Dutta (whose sculpture, Mother VII, in bronze appears along), also exhibit their works in this show to inspire and motivate these promising artists.

 Event: Art exhibition by Avantika

 When: Till December 2, 12 noon - 8 pm

 Where: Indian Museum, Ashutosh Birth Centenary Hall

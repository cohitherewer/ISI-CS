 Airlock lifts, winter breezes in

 - Post-Christmas chill to hold, weatherman says mercury will dip further

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The first chapter of this year?s winter?s tale has been scripted, with the mercury finally deciding to drop.

 Enjoying a free passage after weeks, the North Wind started blowing across Calcutta and its adjoining areas from Sunday, dragging down the minimum temperature by four degrees on Monday. This post-Christmas chill is here to stay for the next few days, said the weatherman.

 The Met office on Monday recorded a minimum temperature of 13.3 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, a swift slide from Sunday, when the minimum temperature was 17.1 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal.

 Officials said sub-zero conditions were prevailing in Kashmir and a cold wave condition was persisting in Bihar and Jharkhand. ?Now, with the sky clear, the North Wind is rushing in and the minimum temperature is dropping sharply,? he said.

 Officials said the anti-cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal blocking the North Wind had dissipated, allowing it to blow unhindered into Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal from Sunday.

 ?There is no more warm air and moisture from the sea flowing in and the North Wind is now blowing freely from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir. That is why Calcutta is feeling the cold,? said A.K. Das, director, regional meteorological centre in Alipore.

 The minimum temperature is expected to hover around the 12 degrees Celsius mark on Tuesday. ?The mercury is likely to dip further thereafter,? said an official.

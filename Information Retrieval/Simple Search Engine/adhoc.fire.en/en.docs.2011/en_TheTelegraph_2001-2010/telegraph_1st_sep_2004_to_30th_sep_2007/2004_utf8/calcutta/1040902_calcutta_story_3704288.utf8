In and out: Stink and stain outside Chandni Chowk station.

 Apropos the report Red stains rip apart Metro repute, August 4, hats off to Metro Railway authorities for initiating a cleanliness drive and slapping a spot fine for making the premises dirty by spitting and throwing bidi and cigarette butts. 

 Such a step had been long due, as we had been witnessing the increasingly deplorable state of one of the best faces of the Calcutta transport system. 

 It is not always people of the economically weaker sections who are responsible. Surprisingly, often well-dressed professionals, or members of the so-called affluent class, who commute by Metro, tend to commit such nuisance inside the station complex. There are some others who do not travel by Metro but destroy the charm of the station by using the building or adjacent pavements as toilets or urinals. 

 It is indeed a matter of shame when travellers and tourists from other states and countries have to pass the station, suffering the malodorous surroundings. The impression of the city, particularly of the Metro, that they carry back with them, is indeed one to be ashamed of. 

 It is cleanliness both inside and outside that matters. It is therefore, strange that while Metro authorities have decided to spruce up the cleanliness inside the station premises, they have ignored the maintenance of a hygienic atmosphere surrounding the station complexes. So, as a whole, they cannot deserve cent per cent compliment for their cleanliness drive. 

 The worst-maintained stations are Chandni Chowk, MG Road, Sovabazar and Jagu Bazar (Bhowanipore). Cant a mobile team keep track of such nuisances? The Metro authorities cannot expect praise by doing half of the job and totally ignoring the rest.

Apropos the report Jail term threat for tormentor son, August 6, it is tragic that torture by the son and daughter-in-law for the sake of property is compelling the parents to move the high court for protection. The relationship between parents and their children is based on affection. Parents never want their children to suffer. With the passage of time, the basic tenets of such a relationship have deteriorated to such an extent that sons are now torturing their parents for selfish monetary interests. It is high time that youngsters came to their senses and grew to respect and love their parents as their greatest well-wishers.

Apropos the report Soccer showpiece needs kick of life, August 4, it is sad to learn that the over-all condition of Calcuttas historic Yuba Bharati Krirangan is in such an abysmal condition. 

Prahlad Agarwala, 

Majdia.

The old man mentioned in the report Donkey lifeline for a Howrah hamlet, August 3, seemed to be living in the Middle Ages. But in reality, he is not. Apart from being easily reared, a donkey does not need to be fed fancy food and can cover rough terrain. If donkeys can be of help, why should that make the concept back-dated or foolish? 

A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

Bandpur.

The report Cramped, but school nurtures success, August 4, brought back memories of my student life in Hartleys School from 1948 to 1952. It was an obscure school then; each class did not have more than six to eight students. But Phyllis Hartley, the owner and head of the institution, was an excellent teacher and an amazing human being. 

Prafull Goradia,

New Delhi. 

The plan of the state forest department to give a new look to the Eden Gardens park to attract visitors is most welcome (Footfall face lift for Eden, August 2). If proper steps are taken to develop the park, it will surely become an attractive tourist spot. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

Behala. 

Apropos the report Rs 10 for jaywalk, 900 pay, August 4, the argument of the DC (traffic) in its support is outrageous. I was fined on one such occasion when the constable allowed the traffic to pass even when pedestrians were crossing the road. This compelled us to run helter-skelter to save our lives. Then we were accused of jaywalking! 

S.K. Limaye, 

Bakery Road. 

Apropos the report State bus eyes private push, August 3, it is interesting to note that the state government is contemplating private participation in running CSTC buses. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee, 

Nayapatty Road.

Apropos the report HS opens review window, August 4, it is interesting to note that the council is allowing reassessment of answer scripts. In the face of allegations that scripts are not properly assessed, this is a welcome move. 

Piyal Mukherjee,

Lake Town. 

Apropos the report Shah vs Govt and history, August 7, it is everyones duty to preserve the citys heritage. Naturally, it is desirable that the governor, government and civic officials and members of the heritage commission sort out problems amicably and explore the best avenues to preserve Victoria Memorial. 

Govinda Bakshi, 

Budge Budge. 

With the tussle between the govenor and the chief 

minister intensifying over Project Maidan, it remains to be seen whether the matter 

is finally settled without hard feelings on either side.

T.R. Anand,

Budge Budge. 

Ek Akasher Niche, the megaserial directed and produced by Ravi Ojha, is aired on Alpha Bangla, and not Akash Bangla, as was mentioned in the August 26 edition of Metro. 

 Model Tupur Chatterjee is the grand-daughter of film-maker Hrishikesh Mukherjee, and not Basu Chatterjee as mentioned on August 29. 

 The errors are regretted.

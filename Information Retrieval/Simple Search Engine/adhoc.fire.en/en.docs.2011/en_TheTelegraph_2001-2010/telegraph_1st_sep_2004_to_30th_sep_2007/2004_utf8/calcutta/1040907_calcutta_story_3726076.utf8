After an enthusiastic start last year, CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja is back for its second edition. 

 The initiative which is not a competition, stress organisers is a recognition of the efforts of Durga Puja committees around the city to make the annual festival safe, environmentally-friendly and inclusive for all.

 Around 110 puja committees attended a meeting at Rotary Sadan on Monday evening to register for the event and learn more about the rules and regulations of a festival which celebrates the spirit of caring for Calcutta.

 Supported by People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC), an NGO, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), the state fire department, Pollution Control Board (PCB) and Calcutta Police are also actively involved with assessing the participants.

 The rules to be followed are what sets the True Spirit movement apart from other awards given during the Pujas. This is one platform where the grandeur of the pandal and idol are not important, where gimmicky themes and lights are disregarded. Here, smaller organisers are on an equal footing with their more famous counterparts.

 Each registered pandal would be visited over the first three days by a panel including representatives from CESC, PUBLIC, the police, the Corporation, PCB and eminent Calcuttans. The judges would be on the look out for compliance in a number of categories namely safety, civic consciousness and social commitment.

 A panel of officials from all organisations involved with the event, comprising U. Mukherjee of CMC, S.C. Ghosh and A. Shome from CESC and B.M. Sen from the fire services, explained the procedures with the help of Barry Brien and Bishwanath Dasgupta.

 To ensure every puja is as safe and secure as possible, the parameters of assessment include traffic control, crowd management, first-aid and fire precautions. Special attention will also be paid to whether committees are using the amount of electricity they applied for, with the proper wiring. A crisis management plan should also be in place.

 From the civic perspective, sound pollution, the nature of announcements at the venue being made and the kind of music played will be taken into account, as will the cutting of trees, use of plastic and placement of dustbins on the eco-friendly front. Restoration plans for damage done to property will also have to be submitted. Height of the idol and compliance with other immersion norms will be noted.

 The social commitment section will examine everything from small considerations to larger efforts. Whether pandals have a help desk, lost-and-found provisions, special facilities for the physically challenged, senior citizens and children, bathrooms and drinking water will carry weight, as will year-round social service initiatives taken in the para by the committee.

 In fact, it is the larger social projects that will decide the prizes. The final awardees will be named Two, Three, Four and Five Star Pujas, with the exemplary one being singled out as the Model Puja for the year. They will be given anything between Rs 2,500 (for Two Star committees) and Rs 50,000 (for the best effort), to go towards a community development project.

 In 2003, Shibmandir Sarbojanin Durgotsav Committee, on Lake Temple Road, was named Model Puja.

Encouraged by the success of Wednesday?s bandh bandobast, the city police plan to repeat the performance on November 22, the next bandh day. 

 If necessary, they are all set to make even more elaborate arrangements to ensure that the bandh called by the Naxalites flops.

 ?A number of people reached their destinations by availing of either police vehicles or private vehicles hired by police. The arrangement was successful, and that will be our blueprint for helping people during subsequent bandhs,? said a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.

 On Wednesday, police had made elaborate arrangements to tackle the bandh. 

 ?Apart from 8,000 policemen on the roads, at least 60 vehicles of the Radio Flying Squad and High Radio Flying Squad were pressed into service, not only to patrol the areas but also to help people reach their offices and institutions. Besides, we had hired private vehicles to provide transport,? said the officer.

 The counterparts of the city police in Tiljala and Salt Lake, too, were on the ready. 

 Ten autorickshaws each were deployed at three points ? in front of Science City, the Beleghata Main Road and EM Bypass crossing and Karunamoyee ? to help people, specially those attached with the IT sector, to reach their offices.

 Debashish Sen, an employee of the education department, was helped by the arrangement. Sen, who lives near Ballygunge Phari, usually takes a bus from Gariahat to his office. Occasionally, he gets off at the Ultadanga crossing and takes an auto. ?On Wednesday I noticed policemen ensuring that commuters get an auto. That helped me,? he added.

 An employee of Yogayog Bhavan, Tapas Halder, somehow managed to reach the intersection of SN Banerjee Road and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. ?I got stuck there because of an SUCI rally. So I approached some policemen. One of them escorted me to my office 10 minutes ahead of time,? he said.

 Keeping in mind the CPI-ML (Liberation)?s threat to make next Monday?s bandh a success at any cost, police are going in for even more elaborate arrangements. 

 ?We may deploy about 9,000 men during the strike. More vehicles will be deployed,? said Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

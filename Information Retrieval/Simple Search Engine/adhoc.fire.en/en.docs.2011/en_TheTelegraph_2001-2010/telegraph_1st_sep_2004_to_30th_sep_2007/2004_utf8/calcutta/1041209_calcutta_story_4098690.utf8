 Burden of knowledge: Children on the way 

back from school 

The article ?Twilight years of torment? on November 

10 was heart-wrenching. The report reminded me of my maternal grandmother who 

had to suffer at the hands of her son and daughter-in-law. 

 My uncle and his wife tormented her physically and mentally, and even denied her a shelter. This, after my uncle signed an undertaking that he would be bound to look after his mother till her death, to procure a central government job on compassionate grounds, following my grandfather?s demise. My grandmother, who was at an advanced age at the time, had no option but to suffer the torture in silence. 

 Cruelty on aged people is increasing gradually and in most cases, they are harassed by their own children. Most newly-married couples are not interested in being part of joint families and prefer to live separately. In such a scenario, they consider the elders of the family to be a burden. 

 Children of earlier generations used to grow up with their grandparents who would tell them bedtime stories from the epics and give a patient ear to their little problems. The love and care helped in their mental development. 

 But times have changed. Children these days hardly spend time with their grandparents. They are alone for the better part of the day and grow up wayward, selfish and stubborn. Fed on the fare on TV, they are also ignorant of their own culture. This can be judged from the way children prefer Harry Potter novels to Thakumar Jhuli. 

 I am certain that children accomplish more in later life if they are not deprived of the company of their grandparents. For their sake, at least, we should not ostracise our parents. If we respect our parents today, our children will do so in future. 

 It is our duty to ensure that the aged do not feel small by our behaviour. The increase in the number of old age homes is an index of our decadence.

Apropos the article ?Carry a single book to school?, November 4, heavy school bags are indeed weighing down students of even primary schools. I want to congratulate the publisher for introducing a single book for a term under the Sangam National Term Book Scheme. The idea of bringing out a single book for four subjects ? English, mathematics, social studies and science ? is brilliant and one for which the time is ripe. The initiative promises to improve things immensely for students of primary schools. 

Dalim Kumar Dutta,

It is extremely unfortunate that children are being 

forced to carry 5-kg bags to school every day. As a result, they suffer in the 

long run, mentally and physically. Thankfully, a publishing house has come up 

with a timely solution. It deserves kudos from people from all walks of life. 

Mahesh Prasad, 

Baidyabati. 

It is a step in the right direction to introduce a 

single book for a term in school. The publisher deserves our praise. Children, 

no doubt, would breathe a sigh of relief after the books are introduced. Knowledge, 

after all, should not weigh so heavy.

Apropos the report ?Pothole peril, blood on street?, November 5, it is really astonishing that a minibus overturned near Shyambazar due to bad condition of the road. The Calcutta Tramways Company and Calcutta Municipal Corporation do not care enough for the people to sort our their differences and repair the portions of roads adjacent to tram tracks. Unfortunately, ordinary people have to suffer the consequences of their bickering. 

Rabindra Nath Kar,

The pictures depicting the terrible state of Calcutta on November 4 (Por-trait of Calcutta as a crater: north, central amp; south) were telling. They speak volumes about the negligence and inaction of the agencies concerned. 

 Like many others, I travel along these roads every day. And commuting seems to get more and more hazardous with every passing day. I have come across stretches in the city where you see only potholes, and no road. The state government, at best, does cosmetic repairs, which are quite useless. 

Ramesh Maheswari,

Apropos the article ?Teacher panic over problem child?, November 4, thanks to the media, most students of English-medium schools are continually exposed to violence and vulgarity. They are also quite aware of the prevailing corruption, indiscipline and lawlessness in society. Given the scenario, isn?t it a little too much to expect students to be obedient and well-behaved most of the time? 

B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum. 

The unruly behaviour of today?s children, especially 

those studying in English-medium schools, is, undoubtedly, the biggest stumbling 

block in the way of their forming healthy relationships with their parents and 

teachers. But the kids alone should not be blamed for the situation. Constant 

pressure from all quarters to excel in studies has played its part in making them 

obstinate. Teachers and parents should both spare some time to understand them 

and solve their problems. 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road. 

Unruly behaviour on the part of school-going children 

is a form of mental illness caused by relentless pressure from parents and teachers 

to excel in studies. In order to escape this pressure, children often get addicted 

to television, which in turn hampers their academic performance. 

 More stress on sports in schools will help reduce the stress on children. I think moral education should also be made compulsory. If we do not act immediately, chances are, a generation will well and truly be destroyed. 

A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

Bandpur, Hooghly. 

We must welcome the verdict of the apex court on the issue of admission of students in the MBBS course under the NRI quota (NRI seats fixed at 15 per cent, November 6). So long as the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is there, admission to the course must be strictly made on the basis of performance in the exam. Reservation to the extent of 15 per cent is quite justified though. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala.

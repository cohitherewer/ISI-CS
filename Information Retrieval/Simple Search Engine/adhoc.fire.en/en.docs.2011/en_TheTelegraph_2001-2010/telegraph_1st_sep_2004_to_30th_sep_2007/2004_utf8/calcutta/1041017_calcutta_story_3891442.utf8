The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Animal farm, up close

 CHANDANA

 One of the reasons I took up hosting 

 a TV travel show was for the opportunity to interact with 

 animals, in different countries, in the wild or domesticated. 

 My recent trip to Sri Lanka was 

 memorable, indeed. I spent an entire day at the Pinnawala 

 Elephant Orphanage, which comprises handicapped and homeless 

 elephants. 

 Of these, some were blind, some 

 had one limb, and then there were some baby elephants separated 

 at birth.

 I was amazed to see how systematically 

 these elephants follow a regimen. They have specific feeding 

 and bathing hours during which they travel together in herds, 

 whether it?s going down to the lake for a much-needed cold 

 bath to ward off the heat or the spread of food (mainly 

 fruits and vegetables) to gorge on.

 I fed the baby elephants milk 

 from a feeding bottle, while the adults gorged on bananas. 

 I was a little disturbed to see the huge but docile animals 

 held in captivity. But later I was told that after 5 pm, 

 the animals were left to wander about in the orphanage. 

 If Sri Lanka seems far off, one 

 can visit the Corbett National Park in Delhi for a closer 

 glimpse of elephants.

 Tip: If you inform the 

 Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage before hand, you can drop in 

 as volunteers and help the elephants bathe and feed. But 

 you need to be very careful about isolated tuskers.

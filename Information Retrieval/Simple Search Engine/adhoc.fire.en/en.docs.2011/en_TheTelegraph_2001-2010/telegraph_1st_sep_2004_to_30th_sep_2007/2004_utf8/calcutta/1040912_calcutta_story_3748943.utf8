The problem in selecting MP3 players is that there 

isn?t much to choose from in the city. Some of the better-known brands aren?t 

readily available, including Samsung?s Yepp series. Praising the iPod yet again 

wasn?t an option either (see TechTalk May 23).

But as opposed to hard disk-based players like the 

iPod, those featured this time are Flash memory-based. Most players double as 

data storage drives that can be carried around. The music/data is stored on a 

special kind of memory stick called Flash. Great looks ensure that along with 

providing sweet music to the ears, they add a dash of style, too. Happy flaunting!

BenqQ Joybee 150

Resembles a slightly big cigarette lighter. Eight 

equaliser pre-sets help better music customisation. The Qmusic editing software 

(provided with the player) lets you be your own DJ. Plays MP3 and Windows Media 

Audio (WMA) formats and doubles as a portable data drive. FM radio with 30 pre-set 

channels and voice record options too. Lyrics can be displayed on the large LCD 

screen, which lets you read e-books too. The lithium-ion battery provides 10 hours 

playback time

Creative MX 200

Better known for its range of computer soundcards, 

Creative?s foray into standalone MP3 players has also been successful. The MX 

200 offers multi-format audio playback, almost 16 hours of voice recording, FM 

radio, and is a small and lightweight player that you can slip into your pocket. 

The device can even be formatted like a hard disk in either Windows or Mac operating 

systems. Has a capacity of 256 MB

iRiver iFP 790

Looks, in this case, is really important. That apart, 

256 MB of internal memory stores eight hours of music, while an extended battery 

life allows 40 hours running time on a single AA battery. FM tuner and voice recorder 

are the usuals while the skip-free feature is a plus. Along with the usual MP3 

and WMA formats, this player supports the OGG music format that?s slowly winning 

the hearts of music lovers as well. A sport arm-band and a sleek carrying case 

add even more style

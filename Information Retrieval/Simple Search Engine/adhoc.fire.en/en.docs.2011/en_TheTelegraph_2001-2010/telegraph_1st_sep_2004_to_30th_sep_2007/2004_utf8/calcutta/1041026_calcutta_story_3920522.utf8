 Tolly travelogue: Our films, their sensibilities

 When Indians migrated to the UK in the 1950s and 60s they formed part of a global population movement set in motion by colonialism. There were different classes of people who left their newly independent mother country to start life in distant England.

 The diaspora experiences alienation in their host country and the concept of home in India remains outside the realms of reality. That ?home? is constructed in the imagination through cultural props like music, literature and entertainment. The Bengali bhadralok was happy listening to his Rabindrasangeet records and celebrating Durga puja. Waves of nostalgia hit the Bengali psyche every time there was a reference to a Hemanta Mukherjee song or an Uttam-Suchitra film. In fact, for most Bengalis who left India in the 60s, time seems to have frozen as far as aesthetic tastes go. Old videos from the golden era of Uttam-Suchitra, Uttam-Supriya and Satyajit Ray have been replaced by VCDs and now DVDs. The electronic media might have got upgraded but tastes are firmly 60s-70s retro romance. There are several Bengali families in England where a Sunday lunch of fish and rice will be followed by a Bengali film viewing in the living room with friends. When artistes from India perform in London they are inundated with requests to sing classic Hemanta and Shyamal Mitra numbers. Every few years, the big stars of Calcutta, like Soumitra Chatterjee, Dipankar De, Supriya Devi tour the UK with theatre productions, all of which run to packed houses. 

 The 80s and 90s probably saw the Bengal film industry at its nadir marked by a series of poor Bollywood imitations and farces. Middle class cinema was seriously threatened and starved. While Mrinal Sen, Goutam Ghose and Aparna Sen continued to work in parallel cinema, mainstream Bengali films had moved away sharply from its educated discerning patrons.

 Consequently, even as recently as the late 90s, non-resident Bengalis would go back after their annual December holidays with VCDs of classics. In the UK opportunities to view new work were seldom and scattered. On an average one or two Bengali films were shown at the London Film Festival and later toured the arthouse cinemas.

 Over the past few years, the almost choked wheel of life suddenly started to turn again at Tollygunge studios, having survived largely on television megaserials. There is a renewed energy with young talent and the interest of film-makers outside Bengal (Mani Ratnam and now, Mira Nair). Some clever marketing ploys like releasing new films in December targeting the NRI crowd and creative ideas like casting popular older heroines against the grain gave us Ghosh?s Titli and Shubho Mahurat.

 The best of Bengali films, though small in number, holds much interest for a world cinema audience. The National Film Theatre in London has always offered great opportunities to view the best in Indian arthouse films in which Bengali films feature prominently. For the discerning cineaste, periodic screenings of Satyajit Ray?s films are boosted with complete retrospectives of the film-maker. Every year the London Film Festival (LFF) showcases the best in Bengali films and last year was a coup with three films featured from Calcutta ? Chokher Bali, Abar Aranye and Patalghar. Films like these get toured around the country and feature in other festivals in Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh. 

 For the past five years, I have been running a film society called In Focus in London through which a number of films have been screened there ? Aparna Sen?s Paromitar Ekdin, Rituparno Ghosh?s Utsab, Urmi Chakraborty?s Hemanter Pakhi and Anjan Das? Saanjhbatir Rupkathara.

 Screenings in London and greater London triggered off requests from other cities up north. Meanwhile Ghosh?s reputation had been growing not just by his prolific work but by its good standards. By 2002, both Bariwali and Ashukh had toured the LFF. Sen?s Paromitar Ekdin and Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s Uttara toured widely in European festivals and the latter even got co-opted into the London Gay and Lesbian Festival. But here were world class films, technically sound and cinematically compelling.

 Viewers have turned up in full strength and there is a ready audience for good regional films. At present efforts are being made to set up limited distribution of Bengali films in the UK. A few Calcutta-based producers are considering small-scale tour of their films in London, Luton, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Edinburgh. There is a large and ready audience waiting eagerly for Bengali films but there has been no organised marketing.

 Second-generation kids in Bengali families abroad have always been derisive about sloppy melodramas that their parents watched. While mothers shed tears over Deep Jeley Jai or Uttar Phalguni, kids would shrug their shoulders and leave the room. Of late, however, there has been a huge curiosity amongst the youth about films like Devdas and Chokher Bali. I have had discussions with youth groups and students of film studies who have been motivated to read the novels by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Tagore and view Ray?s Charulata and Gharey Bairey. This only proves that a good story and technological excellence will draw the younger audience as well. Stars like Aishwarya and Shah Rukh may be the initial drawing factors but eventually the films offer the second-generation Indians some definition about Bengali history and culture. The red-bordered white Puja saree (ref. Devdas) became a popular ethnic dress code during the Durga puja festival in London and there was much curiosity about Raima Sen?s jewellery in Chokher Bali! Goutam Ghose?s Abar Aranye struck a chord with young viewers because of the 9/11 reference and its intertextuality led them to view Ray?s Aranyer Din Ratri.

 There is good work generated in this city and there is an audience abroad ? what is needed is some thinking outside the box, strategic marketing, sustained energy and some risks.

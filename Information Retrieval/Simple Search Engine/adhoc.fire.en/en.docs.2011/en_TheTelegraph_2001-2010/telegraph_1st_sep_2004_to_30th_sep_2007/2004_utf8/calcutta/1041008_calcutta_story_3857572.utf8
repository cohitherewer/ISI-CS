The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Courageous crusader

She has one mission in life to eradicate child 

sexual abuse. While that may be a Utopian dream, 19-year-old Pranaadhika Sinha 

is single-minded in her pursuit of creating awareness, and with a vengeance. Having 

been a victim of sexual abuse herself as a child, Pranaadhikas campaign 

is very personal. Research done, its time for action.

 The former La Martiniere for Girls and Calcutta International School student took two years out from studies after her O-levels last year, to work on the issue of child sexual abuse (CSA), with the aim of doing something to change the situation. So, on June 8, she started Right Now Kolkata, which, although some distance from being an NGO (the paperwork is in progress), is a youth organisation and support group for victims of CSA and incest.

 ?I had a very difficult time dealing with my experience. I tried to commit suicide lots of times. There is no support system here, and I got through it mainly with help from my parents and friends. I want to help others deal with it. Apart from a flood of emails and people dropping in at home just to talk, I get phone calls literally in the middle of the night,? she says. ?I have no real formal training, but the been-there-done-that approach works, because they know I understand.?

 In four months, from three friends reaching out (Pranaadhika, Trina Dasgupta and Anusya Ray are the core group), there are now 20 volunteers pitching in, and the number is growing every day, adds Pranaadhika. They meet every week to talk. Their aim is to break the silence surrounding the issue. 

 Just how rampant is CSA? 

 Of the 20 volunteers between 16 and 30 years of age, 16 were once victims.

 The young lady from Hungerford Street is following in the footsteps of her friend, philosopher and guide Anuja Gupta. The Calcutta girl started Recovering and Healing from Incest (RAHI) in Delhi in 1997 to help adults who were abused as children. 

 ?The problem with CSA is that firstly, there is no law defining the wide-ranging purview of the crime, which is clubbed together under various crimes like rape. Secondly, most of it goes unrecorded, so while different agencies like NGOs or police stations might have some data, for every one reported, 100 go unrecorded,? explains Gupta.

 ?Pranaadhika is doing great,? adds Gupta, about the girl who had worked with RAHI and has now struck out on her own, armed with an arsenal of information. Pranaadhika?s top priority is changing the law to include CSA, for which she has already written a petition.

 In a few weeks, the group has managed to get over one lakh signatures, from around the country and abroad. Some arrived in couriered packages, others were collected from friends and family.

 The team has the law on CSA, or the lack thereof, at its fingertips. The courageous crusader is also working on a website, the group?s public forum, writing a play, Aaina, which was a catharsis of sorts for her, and developing an idea for a film.

 ?Somebody has to do something, because the support structure now is, quite frankly, rubbish,? she signs off.

Whats on your mind this week 

 TV trouble

Television 

seems to have become a constant source of tension of late. Either there are the 

ever-so-unhappy cable operators who are forever demanding an increase in the amount 

the consumer should pay, or there are the TV channels themselves. The common man 

is left in the lurch. The battle between Zee Telefilms and ESPN STAR Sports over 

the right to telecast Australia?s tour of India was one in a series of problems 

the Indian, especially Calcuttan, audience is enduring. Tomorrow, they will be 

deprived of watching their favourite soap and the saga continues? Isn?t entertainment 

the chief concern of those in the television business? Why don?t they just do 

their job?

 Nightingale

Civilisations will rise and collapse, mankind will 

live and die, but the magic of Lata Mangeshkar?s voice is timeless. On September 

28, India?s nightingale turned 75 and what a lucky generation we are to have witnessed 

this day of immeasurable significance. Lataji?s voice acts as an ointment 

for our wretched souls. She lights up our spirits and transports us to a different 

level. Even at this age, she rules the roost when it comes to singing and with 

fans clamouring for more, we wish the diva many more years of health and music.

 India shining?

Indian reforms are a decade old and we have seen at 

the beginning of the new millennium the emergence of two Indias sundered by a 

digital, technological and demographic divide. Parts of India are caught in a 

digital revolution while the rest remain static. Despite spectacular advances 

in technology, there are areas of blight which speak of the rot in the system. 

A house divided cannot stand for long. We can ill-afford two Indias ,with one 

part technologically, economically and socially backward. A structure built on 

shifting sands will collapse. We have the best of manpower. But we also have corrupt 

politicians and bureaucrats, accountable to none, who treat government funds as 

their own, and poverty-alleviation schemes that increase the number of poor.

 Inner beauty

Nowadays, ?presentation? is the buzzword. But what 

does it mean? Our appearance is a mere reflection of our inner self. It is the 

beautywithin that matters more than outward appearance. A combination is needed. 

Presentation is the correct display of a person, a mixture of attitude, looks, 

behaviour and personality.

 Retort

Zaki Mubarki?s ?enlightenment? and his fervent well-wisher 

Md Tarique Nisar?s views, expressed in their letters in this column last week, 

need to be re-defined. Their minds are inundated with so many emotions for an 

?uncouth butcher? like Dhananjoy that they are swayed into believing something 

wrong. Hetal?s family has finally received justice with Dhananjoy?s hanging and 

likewise, this matter should die a natural death. Regarding the other cases mentioned 

by Zaki in his letter, like Bapi Sen, Best Bakery, and Graham Staines, a very 

apt saying comes to mind: ?The wheels of justice turn slowly but surely.?

 Blood 

Rose

White roses of peace become red

With blood that soldiers shed,

With hope and love in heart so deep 

In pools of blood now they sleep.

Rose of peace dipped in blood

Caused this thick red flood,

Sky lit red by the setting sphere,

Earth is red with blood stained layer.

Whom they killed they didn?t know,

But that?s the only way they could go.

Now their bodies lie devoid of breath,

Air is heavy with stench of death.

Sharp sword of war, through white rose of peace,

War is over, but did they find peace?

Santanu Bhowmick

 Someone...

Someone wants to let you know, 

what you mean to the one unknown. 

Thinking of you all the time, 

dreaming about you every moment passing by

Lies my only wish of making you mine. 

Someone cares..., 

Someone remembers, 

your name is whispered in someone?s prayers. 

Gone?s the loneliness from my view, 

Since the day, dear, I saw you!!

Bearer of the bride

 - Yen for ethnic chic brings palanquin back to weddings

 SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

 A Bengali bride and German bridegroom arrive at the girl?s house from the wedding venue, not in a plush four-wheeler but in an ornate palanquin straight out of Devdas.

 Adding yet another traditional chapter to the great Indian wedding saga are palkis doing double duty as carriers and couture add-ons at high-profile dos. And it?s the penchant for ethnic chic that is drawing the jet-set crowd to the snail?s pace of the palanquin.

 Having started as a humble beginning to ?revive the historic vehicle? by 28-year-old Subrata Biswas from the suburbs of Agarpara, the palki seems to be capturing the imagination of the 21st Century bride.

 ?I had fancied seeing my daughter off in a palki right from the moment she was born. The idea materialised after much investigation when I chanced upon Subrata. Nobody in my neighbourhood had seen such a sight and I quite enjoyed the idea of surprising everybody,? says Pradip Kr Guha, high court advocate and father of the German groom?s Salt Lake bride. 

 Wedding seasons are the busiest for Biswas, who stumbled upon the idea of making palkis in a bid to do ?something different?.

 The opulent Shagun wood structures had him foxed when he set about designing one five-six years ago. ?I had never seen one in real life and had no idea about its size and proportions,? he confesses. Then began endless trips to the National Library to study the structure of the vehicle for a royal ride.

 Research over, Biswas brainstormed with 18-20 different kinds of carpenters and craftsmen to improvise and implement. The end product was a sturdy structure, with comfortable space for two to three passengers.

 ?Earlier, people would travel great distances in palkis, so they were quite huge,? says Biswas. His vehicle is tailored to travel three kilometres, with the emphasis being on the decoration and detailing.

 ?Today, the fancier the look, the better,? says the proud owner of five ornate palkis operating under the name of Chaturdola Agency. 

 Biswas rents them out 30 to 40 times a year on an average, not only for weddings, but also for annaprashan, poitey and even Durga puja bhashan. 

 The price tag on the palki is anything between Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 (www.palkee.com for details).

 While the four to eight bearers and two lathels (lathi-bearing men who put up a mock fight on demand) are standard with every palki order, one can go the whole hog and order a ghora gari, decorative kerosene lamps, shehnai players and all. 

 Finding authentic bearers to carry the bride burden was a big bother for Biswas. Local lads lacked the rhythm and so after months of scouting through the districts of Murshidabad and Burdwan, home to traditional palki bearers, descendants of professional bearers were lured to town.

 ?It took a lot of coaxing on my part to get them interested in what they considered an extinct profession,? recounts Biswas. Though they had never borne a palki, they seemed to have an instinctive rhythm from the start.

 Dressed in the traditional gear of dhoti, mejrai (full-sleeved double-breasted kurta), kamarbandh, turban and lathi, they look and play their part to perfection, backed by in-built sound systems blaring Hemanta Mukhopadhyay?s immortal song of the road: ?Hun huna re, hun huna... ?

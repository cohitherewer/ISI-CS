The city designers are going places, making a splash at the national and the odd international event as well. 

 While the likes of Lakm India Fashion Week and the Bridal Asia show are firm fixtures in the annual itinerary of the big daddies of fashion, the smaller names in the fraternity remain busy with numerous weddings and fashion fairs held throughout the country round the year. 

 The newest kid on the block is Seema Agarwal, showcasing her collection at the Mega Wedding Show being held in Mumbai between September 3 and 5. 

 A new line of lehngas are the latest addition to the repertoire of the designer who specialised in saris and salwar suits until recently.

 Vibrancy is the name of the game in the new line meant for brides-to-be and young girls who would wear them to special occasions. The range presents a riot of colours with every bright tone from orange, fuschia, red, turquoise, yellow and green finding their way on to lehngas and bustiers. 

 The fabrics are as rich as they can get with silks, raw silks, dupions, brocades and sometimes cottons about to rustle up ramp rage. 

 The ensembles are embellished with dabka work, stones, patch work, gold khari print, clusters of sequins used as tiny butas and mirror work. 

 While I will also be displaying my bridal saris and suits at the show, the main focus will be the lehnga line. There are formal bridal lehngas as well as semi-formal ones for all the side shows involved in the great Indian wedding, said the designer, who retails from her boutique Rangaj Aesthetics at Camac Street. The lehngas start at Rs 2,500 for the cotton ones and shoot up to Rs 35,000 for the heavy bridal pieces.

 Sketch style

 Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci and Raphael go hi-tech with a Linux software in a sketch machine named after them. 

 The grand names dont disappoint with the machine sketching a snazzy portrait in three minutes flat at the press of a button.

 Brothers Tejash and Sandip Shah came across this wonder wizard on their trip to the US recently and were impressed enough to bring one along.

 Looks like it made good business sense, for the Sketch Kiosk, housed on the fourth floor at Forum, Elgin Road, is drawing a mixed crowd of all age groups. The response has been tremendous. Kids as well as adults freak out on the novelty factor. We are getting a business of around 20 portraits everyday, said Tejash. 

 And if you think the mirror is not too flattering, you can even get caricatures of yourself with a wide variety of moods and emotions to choose from. All you have to do is sit still in front of an in-built camera to take a snap shot and leave the rest to the virtual artists.

 Silk swirl

 It might still be blazing hot and humid in between the showers, but it might not be a bad idea to start stocking up for the winter, more so if there is a good bargain on offer.

 Its time to think silk what with the 80-year-old Indian Silk House store at College Street coming up with a week-long exhibition-cum-sale at the Ice Skating Rink on till September 7. 

 Looks like theyve roped in the Puja shoppers already for footfalls are crossing the 3,000 mark claim the organisers. 

 Women of all ages can be seen rummaging through a wide collection of drapes that pack in everything from Benarasis, Balucharis, tussars, crepes to other varieties adorned with zardosi and resham work. Prices start at Rs 300 and go up to Rs 7,000.

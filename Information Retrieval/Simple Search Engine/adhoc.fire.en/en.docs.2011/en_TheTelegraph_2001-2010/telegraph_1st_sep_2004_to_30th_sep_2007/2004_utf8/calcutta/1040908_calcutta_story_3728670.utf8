The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bigger, wider, louder, clearer

 - Worlds 

most immersive movie experience 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 A still from Matrix Revolutions, the first DMR film and also the first Hollywood movie to be released simultaneously in 35-mm and IMAX formats, in Hyderabad and Mumbai

 Get propelled back in time, transported into the future or simply stay glued to the present with the worlds most immersive movie experience, on a screen thats eight storeys high and 120 feet wide (10 times the size of a normal screen), with 12,000 watts of pulsating, digital surround sound. 

 You can even look forward to enjoying a Ritwik or Ray classic or a Rituparno film on the same larger-than-life format soon in your backyard.

 Darling Harbour Sydney, Grand Canyon Arizona, Science Centre Shanghai, Smithsonian Institute Washington DC, Hussain Sagar Lake Hyderabad IMAX Corporation of Canada is now all set to bring its largest, clearest and steadiest pictures to Calcutta, along with its revolutionary, proprietary IMAX DMR (digital re-mastering) technology, which can transform virtually any 35-mm live-action film into the 15/70 IMAX frames.

 We are looking at an 18 to 24-month timeframe to set up an IMAX in one of the new-age malls coming up in Calcutta, offering upwards of 250,000 sq ft of space. Location, size, height and credibility of the developer would be key factors, Rajesh J. Aeren, vice-chairman corporate affairs, Adel-Aerens, said on Monday.

 The Aerens Group is the Indian partner of IMAX, through Samurai Entertainment Pvt Ltd.

 The companys professionals did a presentation before members of CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India) on Monday evening. While Mumbai and Ahmedabad have dome IMAX theatres, Calcutta will be the second after Hyderabad to have a flat-screen IMAX, which can beam 3D movies as well.

 Calcutta is hugely important to us, with its inherent intellectual capacity to absorb new ideas and formats and its chequered movie-making history, added Aeren. He said once IMAX reached the critical mass of 12 to 13 theatres in the country, the DMR initiative would surely roll out. 

 Even though our primary focus will be on converting event movies from Bollywood, we will surely look at the option of transforming 35-mm Bengali films, both classics and contemporary, into the IMAX format, Aeren added.

 IMAX DMR starts by scanning, at the highest resolution possible, each individual frame of the 35-mm film and converting it into a digital image. Next, proprietary image enhancement tools optimise each image for printing on to 70-mm film. The useful information contained within the small area of the 35-mm format is analysed. Digital images are enhanced by sharpening, colour correction and grain removal and by eliminating unsteadiness.

 The enhanced digital signal is then recorded on to 15/70 film, resulting in a visual presentation which, when projected on IMAXs rolling-loop projection system, is bright, crisp, steady and absolutely stunning, maintained a representative of IMAX. The images are reflected on giant screens that extend beyond peripheral vision. So, you dont see the edge of the screen and there are no bad seats, he explained.

 In India, The Matrix Revolutions, the third chapter in the Wachowski Brothers trilogy, was the first DMR movie and the first Hollywood film to be simultaneously released on both 35-mm and IMAX formats, in Hyderabad and Mumbai. There are more than 235 IMAX theatres operating in 34 countries, with the Hyderabad property leading the footfall count at 600,000.

 The roots of IMAX were in educational films and its path-breaking docu-film Everest has grossed $ 120 million-plus at IMAX theatres alone. In Calcutta, Everest should do well, as also the new James Cameron 3-D film Robot. Star Wars and Peter Jacksons 3-D version of King Kong will be the other forthcoming attractions, said Sudesh Malhotra, director in-charge, Samurai Entertainment.

 The partners of the North American entertainment giant promise to bring in Hollywood artistes to the Calcutta property on promotional visits. Once we are up and running, the possibilities are immense. IMAX might do to Calcutta what Sholay did to Indian cinema, being the first 70-mm movie, observed Aeren.

 The group had daylong talks with interested city developers coming up with modern malls on Tuesday and hoped to take a decision on identifying the Calcutta partner by this month-end.

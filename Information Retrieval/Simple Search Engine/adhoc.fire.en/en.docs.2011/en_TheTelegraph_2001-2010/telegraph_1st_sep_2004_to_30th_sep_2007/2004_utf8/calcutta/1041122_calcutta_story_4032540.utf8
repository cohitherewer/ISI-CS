 Countdown to quota seat chagrin

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 If the Supreme Court plot allotment ruling has kicked up an embarrassing storm, the countdown to another thorny court call for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has begun.

 A contempt petition filed by aggrieved medical students will come up for final hearing and judgment on Tuesday in courtroom no. 22 of Justice Indira Banerjee. Her earlier ruling cancelling MBBS admissions for all students admitted under the NRI scheme had caught the government on the wrong foot.

 Now, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the largest lobby of doctors in Bengal, has started pressuring the government to comply with the court?s order.

 ?From the outset, all factions of the IMA had advised the government against the idea of introducing an NRI quota in medical education. I hope they have learnt a lesson now. They should immediately conform to the guidelines without causing further embarrassment,? said R.D. Dubey, joint secretary (headquarters), IMA.

 The All Bengal Medical Education Action Forum has also threatened a large-scale agitation on the matter.

 On September 29, a day before the official closing date for this year?s admission to MBBS courses, Justice Banerjee cancelled the entire admission process involving students who were admitted under the NRI quota.

 The court directed the government to take in students from the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) 2003 to fill the slots being vacated by those who had paid a premium to book their berths.

 The government then announced it would take the fight to the apex court and refused to admit new students or cancel the admissions of the existing lot. Altogether, 105 students under the NRI quota were admitted to SSKM and Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, while the remaining 95 seats were filled by students from JEE 2004.

 The Supreme Court later modified the high court order by fixing NRI quota seats at 15 per cent of the total batch strength. As the students moved Supreme Court and went on a hunger strike, chief minister Bhattacharjee intervened and pledged his support.

 Kartik Roy, counsel for the JEE students awaiting admission, who moved the contempt plea, sounded upbeat: ?The court might ask senior state government officials to appear in person in court when the case comes up for final hearing and order on Tuesday. There is virtually no way out (for the government) now.?

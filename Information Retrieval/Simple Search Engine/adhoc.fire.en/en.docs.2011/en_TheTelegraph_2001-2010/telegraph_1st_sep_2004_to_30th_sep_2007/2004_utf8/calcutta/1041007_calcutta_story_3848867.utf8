The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New kid on goon block

 A STAFF REPORTER

 He?s only 19 and looks like a schoolboy. Yet, he is a self-confessed sharpshooter, and although his record is apparently quite clean, the police are looking into his past.

 That?s Jackie, the new entry to the city?s underworld and a surprise catch for police. 

 Jackie was arrested on Gobindo Khatik Road, in the Tangra police station area, with a loaded firearm.

 ?We have no crime-record pending against him. We had no information about him, either. Acting on a tip-off, we waited on the road and intercepted him,? said an officer of Tangra police station.

 Officers were baffled by Jackie?s style of operation. ?He looks like any other student going to school. No one can suspect that he is actually going to carry out an ?operation?,? said one of them.

 Jackie is always dressed in school uniform. Even the bag in which he carries firearms resembles a satchel. 

 During interrogation, Jackie reportedly told officers of Tangra police station that ?during firing practice, I rarely miss my target, though I have not fired at anyone?.

 Police said they would have to work thoroughly on Jackie. ?He has been arrested for the first time. We came to know about him only on Tuesday afternoon. Now, we are cross-checking the statements he has made,? said another officer of Tangra police station.

 Elaborating on Jackie?s arrest, police said Tangra and its adjoining areas had witnessed a number of cases of bombings and firing. ?Initially, we thought other local criminals were involved. But a detailed investigation revealed that someone else was active behind the scenes,? he said.

 Though there was no specific information, the first tip-off on Jackie reached Tangra police station a few days ago. 

 ?Fortune favoured us around 12.30 pm on Tuesday. Jackie was walking down the road. Initially, we didn?t find anything wrong. He was either going to school or returning home. But after a careful look at his bag, we noticed the nozzle of a firearm. So, we intercepted and arrested him,? said the officer. 

 Elaborating on this new entrant to the city?s underworld, an officer of the detective department?s anti-rowdy squad said: ?We are trying to find out what operations he has carried out so far.?

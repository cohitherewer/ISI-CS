 Social calls and peeves of Mamata 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee is in a tizzy, as an organiser of a south Calcutta Durga puja intends to flag off Gandhi Jayanti celebrations on Saturday with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s wife Meera and mayor Subrata Mukherjee sharing the dais. 

 Social worker Meera Bhattacharjee, mayor Mukherjee and Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya, another of Mamata?s pet peeves, will join hands at a function organised by the 21 Pally Durga puja committee at the crossing of Ballygunge Place and Bondel Road. All three are prominent residents of the Palm Avenue-Gariahat belt. 

 The puja committee will hand over cheques for Rs 10,000 each to the relief funds of the mayor and Bharat Sevashram Sangha. Pradip Bhattacharya will distribute garments among the slum children of Palm Avenue. Several functionaries of both the Congress and the Trinamul are expected to be present. 

 A Calcutta South vs Calcutta North rivalry appears to be hotting up in the Trinamul over the October 13 inauguration of the renovated Star Theatre, in north Calcutta. 

 Mayor Mukherjee is spending a lot of time and energy on Star, in view of next year?s polls to the civic body. 

 Mamata, too, is an invitee to the Star inauguration on Mahalaya, but has chosen to stay away because Mukherjee has invited chief minister Bhattacharjee as well. 

 The CMC has invested Rs 15 crore to rebuild Star, gutted in 1991.

 To show who is the boss in the Trinamul, Mamata has decided to launch party mouthpiece Jago Bangla ? expected to be an answer to the CPM?s Ganashakti ? at the same time on the same day at Uttam Mancha, in south Calcutta. 

 She has ordered all Trinamul functionaries, including councillors and legislators invited to the Star event, to be present at Uttam Mancha. 

 The mayor is believed to have requested Mamata to allow him to attend the Star inauguration.

 ?I will have to attend the Star theatre programme, as it is a big moment for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation,? he is reported to have told his leader. Sources close to Mukherjee said it would be difficult for him to absent himself from the Star inauguration and attend his party chief?s programme, as a host of dignitaries will be present at the Star function. 

 The invitees include general secretary of Ramakrishna Mission, Swami Smaranananda, Governor Viren J. Shah, the chief minister, actress Jaya Bachchan, and Samajwadi Party MP Amar Singh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 These days some two-wheeler riders take to the footpaths whenever there is 

a traffic jam or procession on the road. They avoid getting held up in the snarls 

but, in the process, pedestrians are much inconvenienced. The riders do not realise 

that they might drag innocent people into an accident by breaking the road rules. 

As the matter is assuming serious proportions, the law-enforcing authorities should 

penalise such law-breakers to discipline them.

Nayapatty Road. 

 Nangi railway station, on the Budge Budge section, Sealdah (South), of Eastern 

Railway, is an archetypal example of what a station should not be. Makeshift wooden 

stalls are coming up on the platforms. The adjacent level-crossing is a haven 

for newspaper and vegetable vendors. At the northern end, a tubewell has been 

installed between the Up and Down rail tracks. The southern end of the platform 

is occupied by homeless people. Bicycles, rickshaws and even two-wheelers ply 

merrily on the platform, and some are even parked on it. It is the genuine commuters 

who are at the receiving end. The railways should maintain the station. 

 Chameli Pal, 

Batanagar. 

 Being a regular Metro user, I have noticed that many commuters, especially 

children, stand at the edge of the platform when the train is just about to enter 

the station. This, apart from being dangerous, is illegal and calls for a fine 

of Rs 250. I suggest the authorities put up big display boards on the platforms 

so that people are mindful of the rule at all times. 

 Farooque Ahmed, 

Dum Dum Road.

 Metro Recommends

 THE DVD 

 (Landmark, Rs 799) Recorded at the Aquarius Theater in 

 Los Angeles, this 1988 concert captures Neil and his band 

 at their peak. The hour-long show features 18 tracks, including 

 some of his best-known songs like Cherry Cherry, 

 Sweet Caroline, I Am I Said, America 

 and the classic Beatles medley Golden Slumbers/Carry 

 That Weight/The End. 

 THE SHOW

 (October 3, 5 pm, Nazrul Mancha) Bangla band Chandrabindoo 

 takes the stage to belt out some of its popular tracks, 

 to be followed by Rupankar?s solos. The soiree is being 

 hosted by CINI to raise awareness about health and nutrition 

 among women and children. 

 THE TEST

 (October 

 6, Bangalore) Will he? Won?t he? Will they? Where will they? 

 Questions galore in the run-up to the series that matters. 

 Sachin Tendulkar has been included in the squad, but between 

 the cricket bat and the runs lies the tennis elbow. Then there?s 

 the telecast battle with a twist on the hour, every hour. 

 Last heard, you will certainly see it on good ol? DD.

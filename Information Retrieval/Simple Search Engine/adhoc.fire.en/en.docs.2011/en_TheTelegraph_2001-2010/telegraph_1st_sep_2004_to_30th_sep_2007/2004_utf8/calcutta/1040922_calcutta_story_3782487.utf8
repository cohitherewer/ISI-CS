 The colourful woollen carpets produced by tribes in the regions along the border with Pakistan, close to Jaipur, show a strong influence of Iran. 

 Known as Gabe, these carpets come in chromes and brick reds, with folk motifs of peacocks and human beings. 

 An attempt has been made in the recent past to revive this craft, and the efforts are already bearing fruit. These carpets are being highlighted in the Art in Life show that the CIMA Gallery has organised once again before the Pujas. 

 Their designs being delightfully uncluttered, Gabes form perfect complements to modern furniture, even in small apartments.

 In this year?s exhibition, the focus is on the border regions of Rajasthan, Gujarat and the Kutch. 

 There are other exquisite products fashioned and designed by master craftsmen from the South and Bengal as well ? stuff than can be worn, draped on furniture and floors, and displayed wherever they can be shown off to advantage. 

 Being quite affordable, this is what CIMA calls its ?pret line of craft.? At the same time, most of these are custom-made products, so they are quite exclusive.

 For example, there is the Senoli for CIMA line of bags made from the borders of cotton saris and embroidered. 

 There is some very smart lacquer ware from south India. Made of wood and handpainted, these small boxes can be used for various purposes. There are fans and mirror frames made of leather that look like they were fashioned out of dry grass.

 The dhurries from the same region, some with kalamkari designs, are surprisingly low priced. Noteworthy among the brass artefacts and figures from here are the Hindu versions of the zodiac signs, complete with a decapitated Ketu, a rare figurine. Himroo fabrics from Aurangabad, made of cotton and silk, have made a comeback.

 The Bastar region presents some striking metal pieces but even more interesting are the wooden mirror frames with their robust carvings.

 Floral motifs and geometric designs of Islamic origin appear on some beautiful carpets from the Rajasthan area. The unique feature of the colourful blockprinted Ajrakh bedspreads from Kutch is double printing ? the motifs are impressed on the reverse side of the fabric as well. 

 Given the beauty of the final product, the laborious traditional technique is definitely well worth the trouble.

 From the same region come the dazzling skullcaps with mirror work and the bags with painstakingly done embroidery as fine as net, yet so tough it outlasts the fabric on which it is done. 

 Women have embroidered flowering trees on textiles and these can be used as colourful wall hangings. Non-governmental organisations are helping local artisans ensure that their products are well-finished and do not have the standard mass-produced look of artefacts available in most state emporiums.

 An aviary comes alive in the miniatures depicting a series of bird paintings. 

 While these hark back to the classical period, equally interesting but less well known is Rogan painting, executed by desert Muslims. 

 The colours are made from resin, cod liver oil and vegetable dyes that together produce a viscous substance that is used to create images of flora and fauna on textiles. 

 It is only of late that these Rogan paintings are being presented as works of art meant to be displayed.

 The show is on till October 19.

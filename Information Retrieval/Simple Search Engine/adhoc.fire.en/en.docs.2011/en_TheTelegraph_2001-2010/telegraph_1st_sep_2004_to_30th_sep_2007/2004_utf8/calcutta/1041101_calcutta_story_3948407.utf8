The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Couture bats on charity pitch

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI, ZEESHAN JAWED

Shopping 

for pleasure and social welfare seem to be going hand in hand. The two-day exhibition, 

Parampara Pret, organised by the Rotary Club of Calcutta, Chowringhee, that took 

off at The Park, Banquets on Sunday morning, combines the best of both. 

 Part of the proceeds of the exhibition, displaying garments, jewellery and other accessories by designers and brands, new and old, will go towards building a hospital for the ailing elderly women of the state.

Designer Sabyasachi (Pepsi) Mukherjee played judge 

and jury on Sunday morning, shortlisting five best stalls from the participating 

32. Local designer brand Malavika and Sucheta Mehr of Earthy Myths bagged the 

second and third prizes respectively. But it was young designer Medhavini Khaitan?s 

line of simple men?s shirts that actually floored the style icon. ?She is going 

to be someone to watch out for in the near future. Her work is simple and very 

mature, I love her creations,? was the certificate given by the 28-year-old fashion 

guru to Medhavini. The first prize, however, was claimed by Rosentique from Mumbai 

and Trendsmith, the two jewellery stores to be judged best by Pepsi. 

 Fear factor

 Blame it on the time zone difference or on the early bird syndrome, but the spooky Halloween night visited Calcutta two days early.

 Though celebrated the world over on October 31, the scare scream sounded at Cloud 9 on Friday. A sporting crowd trooped in to the only haunt in town celebrating the festival, under cover of darkness. 

 For once, the party people abandoned their glad rags and put on their scariest best. Though limited to Dracula and vampire masks, headgears with horns and false teeth, it was a welcome departure from the usual sheen and shimmer. 

 Jack-?-Lanterns in a variety of sizes dotted the place as did a lot of bat cutouts sticking to every conceivable nook and corner. Dim lights were meant to further enhance the fear factor. 

 Though the floor was less than full this particular evening, a couple of enthusiasts made up for the rest. ?Trust Cloud 9 to offer us a different groove. I just love Halloweeeeeeeeeen!? squealed Samantha Gujral, jigging around in gleeful abandon all the while.

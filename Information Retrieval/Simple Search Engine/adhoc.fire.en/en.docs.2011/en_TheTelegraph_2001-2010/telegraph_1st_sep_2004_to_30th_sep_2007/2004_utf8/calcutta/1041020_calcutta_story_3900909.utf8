The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The journey back from Delhi on the Rajdhani Express last Saturday was an ordeal 

for the passengers. The train arrived in Calcutta seven hours late on October 

16 . The train was held up for a long time at Allahabad because of an ?overhead 

wire fault?. Since the authorities already knew the train would reach its destination 

not before evening they drew up a plan to save money on the lunch for the train-full 

of passengers. Instead of the usual 6.30 am, tea was served at 8 am and the breakfast 

around 9.30 am. After that the authorities waited till a sizeable chunk of passengers 

got off at Dhanbad, Asansol and Durgapur. The lunch was served at 3 pm. Many elders 

and children were already unwell after staying on an empty stomach for so long. 

Chivalrous that Indian men are, some started smoking inside the air-conditioned 

compartment to make up for the lunch. The authorities seemed intent on caring 

more about saving the railways? money than taking care of passengers. Though this 

account may not succeed in putting to shame the railway authorities, it will at 

least warn people before they spend all that money on Rajdhani tickets.

 It is a pity that retired teachers are not paid their PF, gratuity and pension 

dues in time. They are much harassed and have to wait for eight to 10 months, 

sometimes even upto three years. Is the government?s actions consistent with its 

promises? Its high time that the government address their problems. This 

would be a better tribute to the teaching community than any other on Teachers? 

Day.

 The condition of south Calcutta?s prestigious bridge at Dhakuria is really 

astonishing. Its railings are broken at several places. Nothing has been done 

to repair the bridge for the last six months. During Pujas the footpaths on the 

bridge are so crowded that accidents are always a possibility. A fall from the 

bridge on to the rail tracks below would mean sure death. The same could be said 

for Kalighat bridge, which connects Hazra and Alipore.

 I request the police commissioner to arrange for publishing a booklet showing 

jurisdictions of all police stations in and around the city and their locations 

and contact numbers. The general public would be greatly benefitted by it during 

the festive season like Durga puja. With a deluge of pandal hoppers descending 

on the city, petty crimes like snatching and people going missing are common complaints. 

During such an emergency people can refer to the booklet and approach the right 

thana for help. 

Md. Moinuddin, Ballygunge.

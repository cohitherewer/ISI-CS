The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Life, death and terms of law

 NABA KUMAR DUTTA, public prosecutor and guest lecturer of law at Calcutta University, met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Sandip Chakrabarty, Arun Mondal, Bandana Banerjee, Sandip Banerjee, Sujoy Guha Roy, Ashish Kumar Chatterjee, Kaushik Chowdhury, Bonakrishna Roychowdhury and Arunabha Guha

Bandana Banerjee: What kind of offence gets the death sentence?

 There is a false notion that the death penalty is awarded only if a person has committed a murder or is associated with a killing. According to the Indian Penal Code, there are many other situations where the guilty can be awarded the death penalty. As our judiciary is relatively sympathetic, such cases are rare. 

 The death penalty can be slapped on the guilty if he wages war against the state, holds any other person for ransom or gives false witness or provides false information that misleads the court to award a death sentence to any other person.

Ashish Kumar Chatterjee: Please clarify the life sentence award.

 There is a misconception that the life sentence lasts only 14 or 15 years. Life imprisonment means the convict will have to remain in prison for the entire period of his life. The confusion actually arises when some convicts awarded such a term come out of prison after 14 or 15 years. This can happen if any convict has spent more than a decade in prison and maintained a good record. He can appeal for mercy and if the government grants it, he comes out of prison. Prisoners are generally pardoned on Republic Day. 

Arun Mondal: Is prostitution illegal? What legal steps can be taken to reduce child prostitution?

 There is no law that can be interpreted to prove the legality of prostitution. In fact, according to a section of law, prostitution is banned within a fixed periphery of schools and religious institutions. This hints that beyond the set limit, prostitution can be carried out. However, there is a restriction for plying such a trade under the Immoral Trafficking Act, which is applicable only when there is proof that the accused is doing it for material gain. 

 Regarding child prostitution, the Supreme Court had given a classic verdict in 1997. By the verdict, all minor girls being forced to work as commercial sex workers are described as child sex workers. The directive has instructed all state governments to carry out continuous vigil in red-light areas and brothels and to rescue minor girls entering the profession. 

 After their rescue, the girls should be sent to government homes or to homes maintained by reputed NGOs, where they will be trained in different crafts so that they can earn their living when they attain maturity.

Bonakrishna Roychowdhury: A person can evade arrest on a serious charge by seeking bail. What are the conditions that are considered while granting bail?

 Bail is actually a condition when a person is allowed by court to remain in public and face trial in the court of law. Generally, bail is granted when the judge observes that it is not necessary for the investigating authority to keep the person secluded or in confinement, so that he cannot the influence the witnesses or the investigation process. But, in any case, it is the absolute discretion of the judge to grant bail after weighing the gravity of the case. 

 Apart from this, there are some other conditions. First, a judge grants bail when he finds that the accused will not abscond during the trial. Second, he will not try to sway the witnesses. Third, the accused must not be a multiple-time offender. 

 A person also gets bail as part of a basic procedural right if the chargesheet is not filed within 90 days of the first court hearing date. In some cases, the time-frame may be only 60 days.

Kaushik Chowdhury: If police refuse to lodge a complaint, how can one approach the court for help?

 If a person is harassed by goons and local police refuse to register a case, the person may approach the court and file a petition before a first class judicial magistrate. If it is found that the petition contains a cognisable offence committed against the petitioner, the magistrate may instruct the local police station to start an investigation. In that case, the petition may be treated as an FIR. The officer-in-charge of the police station is bound to start a case if he is so instructed by the magistrate. If police still refuse to start a case, the plaintiff may file a contempt petition against the officer or may move a higher court.

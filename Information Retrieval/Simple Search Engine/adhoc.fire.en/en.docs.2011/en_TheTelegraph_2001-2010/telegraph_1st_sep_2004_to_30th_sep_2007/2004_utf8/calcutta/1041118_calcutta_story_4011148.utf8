Detox diary 

Ship Shape

With the feast of the festive season just 

over, its time to give your insides a thorough cleansing. Smita Roy Chowdhury 

finds out how

The festive fervour is finally over ? the eating-out 

spree during the Pujas, the mithai mania of Diwali and the biryani binge 

of Id. It has sadly, but inevitably, come to an end. While you most rightfully 

threw calorie caution to the wind in favour of the good life for the past month, 

it?s time again to spare a thought for your insides.

?Not only does one lose count of calories, the body 

suffers from the indiscriminate intake of food and loses count of toxins too,? 

explains Divya Saraf, nutritionist at AddLife Fitness and Spa. ?It is then that 

symptoms of acidity, indigestion, flatulence, and diarrhoea are accompanied with 

a deep sense of guilt and heaviness.?

Optimal health is a function of the body to assimilate 

nutrients and limit accumulation of harmful toxins. Everyday, the body detoxifies 

ingested toxic substances (primarily by the liver) in two phases. First toxins 

are broken down and then they are converted into a form that can be expelled by 

the body. Anti-oxidants in food are used to contradict the harmful effects of 

toxins.

These two phases work hand in hand as a defence mechanism, 

however, only until we go on a food binge. ?So, a heavy eating spree should be 

followed by a judicious balanced diet plan high on nutrients and low on calories,? 

advises Divya.

You can go for a total detoxification programme by 

following a few dos and don?ts, rather than starving or going on a fad diet, which 

leaves the system unbalanced and under-nourished. There are quite a few detox 

plans, some weekly and others over a longer period, to choose from. Pick one that 

suits your system after consulting a dietician or nutritionist.

Perfect plan

In a detox programme, the idea is not to deprive your 

body of any particular nutrient, which most crash diets advocate. You have to 

follow a healthy regimen. Start the day with milk or yoghurt along with fresh 

fruit and any one cereal such as oats. Have five almonds for extra benefit. Your 

lunch can comprise chapatis and boiled or sauteed vegetables with salad. 

Dinner should be lighter with a bowl of soup and another vegetable with either 

a slice of toast or a chapati. Use a non-stick pan for cooking so you use 

minimum oil. And every time you feel hungry, just munch on fruit instead of snacking. 

Also, drink lots of water. You can continue this for as long as you want.

Milk amp; fruit mantra

This is another tried and tested formula for detoxification 

and should be done once a week on a regular basis. You can have as much of whichever 

fruit you choose along with milk or milk products the whole day. You just have 

to make sure the milk is low-fat and pasteurised. This is a good way of nourishing 

and detoxifying the body.

Water therapy

Apart from these regimens, the most essential part 

of detox is water therapy. Consuming four to five litres of warm water every day 

clears most of the toxins from the body, eliminating them through urine. It also 

aids digestion as long as it is consumed between meals and not with it or immediately 

after it.

Things to remember

Whatever plan you are adopting, keep in mind certain 

basic dos and don?ts:

Eat lots of whole fruits and vegetables.

Increase anti-oxidant intake by adding citrus fruits, tomatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, 

carrots and nuts to your diet.

Key nutrients are vitamin C, vitamin E, calcium, vitamin A, selenium, chromium, 

zinc, copper, folic acid and iron.

Avoid tea, coffee, and carbonated beverages. Switch to green tea. Avoid alcohol 

consumption and smoking.

Avoid red meat and fatty foods. Instead, have lots of low-fat milk in the form 

of milk or curd.

Restrict pickle, papad, lentils and beans as they have a tendency to cause flatulence 

and also sugary and fried foods.

Avoid spicy and rich-gravy foods.

Don?t go off carbohydrates completely. Have home-made whole-wheat chapati 

or oats, wheat porridge or even steamed rice.

Skin clean

Once you take care to detoxify your internal system, 

the results will most definitely show on the glow of your skin. However, skin 

detox might be helpful also, particularly in winter. At Vandana Luthra?s Curls 

and Curves, detox is a head to toe treatment aimed at increasing blood circulation 

and lymphatic flow of blood. 

?The skin detox treatment is most necessary in winter 

when the skin becomes dehydrated and dead cells accumulate on the surface. It 

cleanses the skin thoroughly and also relieves stress,? explains Sukanya De, slimming 

in-charge, VLCC, Calcutta.

In this two-hour treatment, the skin is cleaned thoroughly 

with a hot towel, then massaged with various aroma oils. This is followed by an 

exfoliation treatment and another massage with anti-cellulite oil. After this, 

the whole body is covered with a special detox mud and wrapped with a blanket 

for 30 minutes. 

?While this treatment detoxifies the skin externally, 

one should have plenty of fruits, vegetables and fluids to help cleanse the system 

from within,? adds De.

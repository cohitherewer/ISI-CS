 ?Insiders? in Salt Lake land scam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Over a dozen professionals, including doctors, lawyers, corporate executives and businessmen, appear to have been taken for a ride in a land scam.

 D.P. Tarenia, deputy inspector-general, Criminal Investigation Department (CID), said on Sunday that the victims did not suspect anything wrong when they were handed over fake ?letters of allotment? of plots in Salt Lake. 

 The premium was hefty, running into several crores.

 ?We are in the middle of an investigation. We cannot rule out the involvement of a section of urban development department employees in the fraud,? said Tarenia.

 Apparently, the scam had got underway in 1998, when the Jyoti Basu government was still in office. 

 While officers of the urban development department are not willing to speak, investigations suggest that quite a few crores could be involved in the scam.

 Part of the money found its way back to the beneficiaries, that included some ?insiders? in the department itself.

 Probing the ?fraud? ? that came to light after some victims shot off letters to the urban development department in October ? the CID sees an ?insider?s hand? in the scam, with a Salt Lake resident as its key operator. 

 Investigations suggest that the racketeers handed over a few genuine plots initially as a part of the confidence-building measure. But subsequently, all others were cheated. 

 ?The letters were sent through peon books, as in any government deal, to leave no doubt among the victims. But the book and even the person carrying it were all fake. The bulk of these letters was photocopied skilfully and passed off as originals,? said a senior officer of the CID. 

 Happy with their allotment, no one bothered to check with the urban development department, even though some were allotted plots, including a few in BD block, where houses already existed.

 ?It was only when the complainants came forward and we checked our records that they stumbled upon the fraud. The letters had almost everything, including the masthead of the Government of West Bengal, leaving no scope for any suspicion,? claims K.S. Rajendra Kumar, principal secretary of the department. 

 While Kumar feels ?insider involvement? is only a conjecture, the investigating agency holds that there are reasons enough to believe so.

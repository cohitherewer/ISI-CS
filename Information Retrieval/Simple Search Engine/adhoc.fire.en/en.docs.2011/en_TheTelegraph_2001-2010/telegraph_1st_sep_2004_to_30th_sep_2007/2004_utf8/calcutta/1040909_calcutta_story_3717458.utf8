Rowdy rules for bachelor bash

Plan a Party

Zeeshan Jawed rolls out a game plan 

to celebrate the singleton spirit

 Do 

 Find a venue for the bachelor party. It can be a bar, a nightclub or a 

friends house 

 Keep the dress code casual denims and T-shirts would be perfect 

 Dont 

 If you decide on a weekend getaway for the party, dont stray too 

far 

Now that you have decided to bid your bachelor-hood 

a fond farewell, part ways in style, with a party celebrating your true singleton 

spirit. Seize the moment and call over your male posse and paint the town red. 

(A word of warning: you may want to stay away from married men for a few days, 

in case a few pessimistic words bring on a bout of cold feet.)

Face your fear

High blood pressure, frayed nerves and lack of appetite 

are some of the common symptoms that men reportedly go through before marriage. 

Still, if you are romantically inclined, your idea of a pre-plunge party might 

be a night by the side of your fianc?e. A quiet candle-lit dinner is never a bad 

idea.

Gang up

If a loud bachelor bash is more your style, the choice 

of venue is vital. Partying at home may appear too tame. So, head instead for 

a bar or nightclub. It might be a bit expensive, but you save on the hassle. If 

you finally zero-in on your own bachelor pad (not for too much longer) or a friend?s 

house, spare a thought for family and neighbours. ?The alcohol content, excitement 

and ambience might be overwhelming. Guys generally end up creating a lot of bedlam,? 

says Amit Sengupta, who has attended his fair share of bachelors-only nights.

Fun on the run

A weekend getaway for tension-free fun might be the 

best way to get ready for the big step. Make sure you don?t stray too far away 

? after all you want to be back for M-Day, don?t you? Check out a beach or a forest 

destination, for some private moments of pleasure and debauchery.

Casual code

Casual goes both with mood and occasion. Pull on a 

pair of jeans and a snazzy T-shirt. If the bash is at home, take the liberty to 

settle into a pair of shorts and singlets.

Rustle bustle

If you are cooking at home, an elaborate meal may 

give you the chance to unwind and forget some of the stress. But if you have two 

left wrists in the kitchen, better to order some pizzas. Beer and pizza is the 

classic combination for men vegging out, after all.

Mingle while still single

If your female pals want in on the action, throw a 

co-ed event, a trend fast catching on. ?Mine was a love marriage, so when I organised 

a get-together, I invited all my friends along with my fianc?e and her friends,? 

explains Debarun Choudhury, who recently tied the knot. However, keep all eyes 

on your spouse, or things could take an ugly turn.

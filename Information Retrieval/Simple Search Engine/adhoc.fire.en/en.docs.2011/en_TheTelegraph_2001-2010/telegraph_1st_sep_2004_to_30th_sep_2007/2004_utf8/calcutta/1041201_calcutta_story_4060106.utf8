 The biography of Prof Amartya Sen, being penned by Sylvia Nasar, will have a special mention of one of the oldest bookshops in town, Dasgupta amp; Co, and how it was ravaged by a fire on May 30.

 Nasar had come to the city with Sen a few months ago and visited the College Street store, established in 1886. An economics correspondent with The New York Times, she had earlier written a biography of John Forbes Nash Jr, winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics.

 ?Nasar told us that there will be a mention about our shop and the fire in the book,? said Arabinda Das Gupta, a partner of the store.

 Sen?s link with the bookstore dates back to his Presidency College days. ?Amartyababu has been buying books from us since 1953,? Das Gupta recalled. After the fire, in which books worth more than Rs 40 lakh were destroyed, Sen had ?sought all news clippings and expressed his deep sorrow?. 

 The fire had gutted the first and the second floors of the three-storeyed store. Among the rare items lost forever were Kautilya?s Arthashastra, books on religion and maps of Bengal dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. 

 ?These titles cannot be replaced, as they are out of print,? Das Gupta lamented.

 The fire having taken its toll, it was the turn of the fire-fighting operation: books worth more than Rs 6 lakh, including some rare and costly foreign titles, were drenched by water and stained by smoke. ?We cannot sell these books. They will be distributed free to poor but meritorious students,? Das Gupta informed Metro. 

 Although the six rooms damaged by the fire have been renovated, scar marks are still evident on the floors. The stained books are piled in one corner. Most of them are still moist, though six months have passed since the tragedy.

 It took three-and-a-half months to reconstruct the shop. New furniture has been installed and new computer and fax machines have replaced the gutted ones. ?We are yet to start rebuilding our collection in a full-fledged way because of a funds problem,? Das Gupta said. 

 The owners were, however, overwhelmed by the emotional support they received after the blaze. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had personally inquired about the situation and fire minister Pratim Chatterjee had provided a discount on the fire bill. 

 Education consultant Mary Ann Dasgupta had written to the owners: ?The shop does not just sell books but actually breathes books and academia.? 

 The Das Guptas were most surprised by calls from Jessore, in Bangladesh, where they have their ancestral home.

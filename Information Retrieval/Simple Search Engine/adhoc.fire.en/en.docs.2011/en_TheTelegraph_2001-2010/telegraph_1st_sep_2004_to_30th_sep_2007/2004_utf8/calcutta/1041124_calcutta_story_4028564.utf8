 The annual alcohol major?s event ? Smirnoff Experience ? that usually rocks the open lawns of some club in Calcutta was holed up at nightclub Tantra this year. 

 If the floor space was reduced, the organisers made up for it by extending the hours of partying. Thus, from a one-evening affair, the event stretched to a three-day fun fiesta with DJs and VJs from across the country and even abroad pumping up the action from last Friday night onwards. 

 The first evening saw the bubbly VJ Kim lending vocal support to resident DJ Whosane? (yes he spells it like that!). As the crowd grooved to the mix of popular tracks from almost all the party genres ? hip hop, R amp;B, trance ? remixes lent the familiarity factor to the regular party-hopper. Once the mood set in firm and final, the DJ dared to go experimental, giving music lovers a taste of the latest in international sound. If Friday seemed like fun, Saturday was scintillating. The desi crowd danced to firang flavours with US-based DJ Scarlette?s repertoire. VJ-turned-DJ Nikhil Chinappa added the gift of gab to the groove. 

 Like so many women DJs who look quiet but prefer to play some really loud music, Scarlette pitched her noise to a screaming height too. Happily, everyone loved the noise that she made. 

 Sunday was less sensational but cool nevertheless. DJ Ivan, a favourite with Winning Streak and a regular to the city, took up the spin to get the crowd swinging. Giving the younger crowd a lot of popular music, Ivan, like always, was a hit. Nikhil Chinappa decided to back him up and practice his skills on the turntable for a little while longer.

 Googly girl

 It was like a dream come true for the Lucknow born Deeksha Khare when she was crowned the Pond?s Googly Woogly princess on Friday by none other than the Miss India Earth 2004 Jyoti Brahmin. 

 Deeksha, a management trainee with the finance department of Shaw Wallace, experienced the exhilarating moment at the crowning ceremony, that took place at Jyoti?s Sunny Park apartment. ?Winning the Pond?s contest was the last thing I had expected,? gushed the MBA and CFA from IBS Hyderabad. 

 The Pond?s Googly Woogly contest kicked off on October 6 where ladies above the age of 18 were asked to write in about the most beautiful and memorable moment of their lives. Fifteen girls with the best answers were selected to become the Pond?s Googly Woogly princess by a panel of independent judges from all over the country. Deeksha was the winner from Calcutta. 

 So what was the crown clincher moment in Diksha?s life? ?I received a bouquet of 50 roses from my fianc?e on June 18 who said that it was his Valentine?s Day,? gushed the winner. 

 The finalists will again vie for the ultimate title ? Pond?s Queen ? to be conferred by Miss India Universe 2004 Tanushree Dutta herself.

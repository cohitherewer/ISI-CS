The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Base shift need of the times

 Vivek Kumar, district magistrate, South 24-Parganas, met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Sandip Banerjee, Sanjana Basu, Saileswar Chakrabarty, Juthika Mukherjee, Ranajit Basu and Basudeb Chowdhury

Sandip Banerjee: The headquarters of South 24-Parganas is shifting from Alipore to Baruipur. What is the necessity?

 Change is the demand of the time, but there are several reasons behind the decision to shift the headquarters. Actually, Alipore falls practically within the limits of Calcutta and not within the administrative area of South 24-Parganas. It is ridiculous that the headquarters of a district be located outside the district. It?s like our chief minister running the state from a neighbouring state. 

 Actually, South 24-Parganas is the only district in the state where the headquarters are located outside the geographical boundary of the district. Apart from this, we are facing some other problems in the day-to-day administration. 

 But since the shift will heavily burden the state exchequer, we have to wait for a considerable period before finally implementing the decision for the change. 

Sandip Banerjee: Can you specify by when the shift will be effected? 

 We are yet to formally resolve on a change of headquarters, but since the government has taken the decision in principle, what remains is only a formal administrative step. Once we accept the resolution for a shift in the meeting that is to take place before the Puja holidays commence, the government will issue a notification in its gazette and the official process for the shift will be initiated. 

 We have identified a 100-acre plot in Baruipur that will house the headquarters and have drawn up a blueprint of the shifting of the administrative departments. 

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has started laying a connector road from the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass through Kamal Gazi to Baruipur. Nearly 30 administrative departments will be moved to the new building in phases. For example, the electricity supply department, located on Mirza Ghalib Street, has already been asked to set up office at Joynagar. Another department has already shifted to Kakdwip from Baruipur.

Ranajit Basu: We hear a Royal Bengal Tiger camp has been set up in Dayapur. 

 A government-private venture has been formed to promote eco-tourism and generate awareness about the tiger. Actually, the camp is a small resort with only seven or eight cottages located very close to the Tiger project area of the Sunderbans. Our role is restricted to that of facilitator. The promoters of the camp themselves obtained the required no-objection certificate from the departments concerned. We only helped them to expedite the process. We also gave them the permission to employ some armed security personnel in the camp to ensure safety of the tourists. 

Saileswar Chakrabarty: What about the much-hyped tourism project of Sahara?

 For any such project in the area, an organisation needs clearance from the state environment and forest departments. It will also need a clearance from the Union environment department. This particular entrepreneur group had already got a no-objection certificate from the state government but is yet to furnish the same from the Centre. 

 We were asked by the state government to acquire 900 acres for the project. We had already acquired 630 acres and asked several brick kilns to move out. We will not renew the trade licence of the kilns. All our steps are taken as per instruction of the state government and these do not require a Central nod.

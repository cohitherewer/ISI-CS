 Vocal vice: Voices of protest that shatter the calm of a cure centre

Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 Hospitals should be allowed to maintain a suitable atmosphere for treating patients. Visitors should be guided by hospital public relations officers about the norms to follow while in the building. Only two persons per patient should be allowed entry to avoid disruptions. 

Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge 

 Hospitals are meant for treatment of patients in a peaceful atmosphere. Naturally, restrictions should be imposed to pre-empt disruptions which are detrimental to the health of the seriously ill patients. Public property and scientific instruments too are destroyed by collective public wrath which is usually incited by negligence of duty by doctors.

Satyen Biswas, 

 Behala

 The hospital superintendent should be strict in maintaining discipline. There should be a constant vigil for any suspicious movement of groups within the hospital. For improvement of discipline in a hospital, the authorities should recruit private security guards for constant watch.

Ujjal Bhattacharyya,

 Entally

 Restricting entry to hospitals can help counter the problem of disruption of normal work. This would also help protect the costly medical equipment installed there. The hospital authorities should adopt a fool-proof modus operandi with the introduction of advanced security infrastructure and facilities. 

Rajarshi Ghosh, 

 Surya Nagar

 Entry should be restricted to hospitals, which are not places for revelry. Only a couple of persons per patient should be allowed to enter the ward. Too many people are most likely to create chaos. Patients need peace and quiet while recovering from an illness.

T .R. Anand, 

 Budge Budge 

 Entry to hospitals should be restricted to pre-empt disruptions. Such a move will allow doctors and nurses to do their jobs more efficiently and avoid unwanted disturbances due to human interference. Often relatives enter the hospital premises without valid passes. Such people need to be fined to bring about some amount of discipline in hospitals. 

Indranil Sanyal, 

 Address not given 

 Yes, entry to hospitals should be restricted. The entry and exit of outsiders disturb other patients in the ward. Any such disruption proves detrimental to the condition of patients. In this regard, the code of discipline maintained in private nursing homes may be followed. Rules once formed should be strictly adhered to. 

 Anandadip Chowdhury,

Baguiat

The secret of the recuperation of patients in a hospital is a peaceful ambience 

which is disrupted by unwanted movement of outsiders. Restriction should be imposed 

on their entry. In case of an emergency, the patients kin can minimise the chances 

of unfortunate incidents. Only the patients relatives should be allowed within 

the hospital premises with valid passes. 

Kaushik Guha,

SN Roy Road 

Trouble-makers in hospitals should realise the harm 

they are causing other patients by disrupting normal operations in a hospital. 

Ransacking a hospital is never the answer to protest negligence of doctors. To 

avoid vandalism in hospitals, entry of people in groups should be restricted. 

Indranil Sengupta, 

 Salt Lake City 

 Some restriction, by all means, should be imposed on entry to hospitals. Movement of unnecessary people inside hospitals leads to a lot of commotion, which causes disruption of the normal schedule. Patients and staff cannot be allowed to be inconvenienced because of vandalism by visitors. Authorities should look into the matter and restrict unwanted entry to hospitals to pre-empt disruptions.

Sushma jalan,

 Alipore

 Certainly. Hospitals house patients, who need complete rest and peace. Disruptions caused by visitors not only make them irritated, it is also harmful for their health. Be it throwing a party to celebrate a birth in a maternity ward or creating a ruckus due to another patients slightest inconvenience, visitors are always unmindful of the discomfort they are causing to other patients of the ward.

Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 

 Barasat 

 Hospitals are not places of entertainment or pilgrimage. If hordes of people visit hospitals, chaos is bound to prevail. Some sort of restriction maybe two visiting cards per patient should be imposed to maintain order and peace during visiting hours for betterment of the situation.

B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum 

 It is evident that in most cases the death of a patient in a hospital sparks the wrath of his relatives who blame it on negligence of the doctors. The angry relatives then proceed to vandalise the equipment in the hospital and assault the staff. This must be stopped at any cost. For starters, entry to hospitals should be restricted.

Tanoy Mukherjee,

 Barasat 

 The entire system of admission of visitors to hospitals needs a revamp. Apart from doctors and patients, the entry of the relatives of patients must be permitted only on production of an identity card issued by the hospital authorities. This can also keep touts away. The authorities must see to it that hospitals remain the ideal sanctuary for the ailing.

Biswajyoti Bagchi,

 Alipore

 Attending doctors cannot treat patients properly if their own safety is not ensured. Any death in a hospital is unwanted but that is no excuse for supporting vandalism by patients relatives and goons. Relatives of patients should be asked to systematically express their dissatisfaction or ask for an inquiry, but they should be punished for vandalism.

Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Burdwan

 Patients kin resort to rampage at the slightest insinuation of medical negligence. If free access is restricted, the frequency of such unwanted incidents will be minimised. They should be restricted from entering the premises, for an undesirable crowd will increase the suffering of critically-ill patients. 

joydip sur, 

 CIT Road 

 Entry to hospitals should definitely be restricted. Most hospitals lack organised management. Personnel delegated with the responsibility of safeguarding the entrances are negligent in discharging their duties. Their work should be supervised and penalty imposed on those found tripping up on their duty. 

Udayan Banerjee,

 Bhadrakali

 Entry to hospitals should be restricted to some extent, so that some amount of discipline can be brought back to these places of care and cure for the ailing. Of late, hospitals have grown into places where illegal businesses thrive. If the rules for entry to hospitals are made more stringent, perhaps such vices can be avoided.

Nirmal Kumar Saha,

 Sinthee

 It is the responsibility of the authorities to see to it that a peaceful atmosphere is maintained on the hospital premises. A strict vigil should be maintained so that no untoward incident takes place. This should be done out of respect for the patients at hospitals.

Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 Entry to hospitals should be regulated. Unrestricted entry disrupts discipline as well as increases chances of pollution and infection. Political infiltration is especially unwanted.

 Bath blues and basics

 NELANJANA BHOWMICK

 Yesterday, our bathroom was transformed 

 into a battlefield ? I had decided to bathe my pets. The 

 two teams: My mom and me vs the animal kingdom (Chip, Mow, 

 Mingles). Chippers? whining paled in comparison to the loud 

 meowing of the cats.

 Over the years, my mom?s looked 

 at grooming pets as ?an opportunity to bond with them?. 

 Here?s a look at some of her pointers for bathing cats and 

 dogs.

 Brush up: A couple of hours before 

 the bath, brush your pet?s coat since any mats and tangles 

 are likely to shrink during the wash and become difficult 

 to handle.

 Tool kit: Before you bathe your 

 pet, have towels, shampoo-conditioner, sponge and brush-comb 

 ready.

 Step I: Gently pick up the pet 

 and prepare for the bath. Place half a cotton ball in each 

 ear to prevent water getting in and a drop or two of mineral 

 oil in each eye to avoid stinging from the shampoo.

 Step II: Use lukewarm water to 

 wet the coat thoroughly. Gently work the shampoo into a 

 lather and allow it to remain for a few minutes. Rinse well. 

 Use a sponge to clean the face and head. (Throughout, keep 

 talking to your pet in a calm voice.)

 Step III: Towel drying is sufficient 

 for short-haired breeds. Long-haired pets may require blow 

 drying.

 Give your pet a special treat 

 once you?re done! Even if your pet is comfortable with baths, 

 don?t overdo it. Finally, feed your pet a high-quality natural 

 diet to maintain healthy skin and coat.

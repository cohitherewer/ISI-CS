From the land of five rivers

When the east bank of the Hooghly welcomed Job Charnock 

more than three centuries ago, Calcutta was born. And from this moment of its 

birth, it welcomed people from far and near. Like the legendary banyan tree in 

Jaanbazar, under which Charnock sat with his hookah and did business for the East 

India Company, the shade and shelter of our much maligned, yet much loved, city 

has brought many of us together. From the Armenian traders who were among the 

first to come from distant Baghdad, to the Chinese cobblers from Canton, many 

came to Calcutta, through its short but eventful history. Despite our differences, 

the city has been able to metamorphose us into a specific identity ? what I call 

the Calcutta State Of Mind!

My father came here after Partition, right across 

the subcontinent from Lahore. There were many others who came. A city already 

torn apart by its own harrowing experience of Partition, overburdened and broken-hearted, 

had no difficulty in embracing others like us who had lost their motherland. Perhaps 

stories of this exodus will be told one day. I know of one legendary journey undertaken 

by the Narang family, with their entire film studio in Lahore, loading its equipment, 

its expensive sets, its Hindu and Sikh technicians, and its old negatives, onto 

trucks and driving down Grand Trunk Road to Bengal National Studios in Baranagar. 

Yes, the GT Road went up to the Khyber Pass. It still does!

The Punjabis were here before, but not in the numbers 

that the Partition ushered in. And like my family, many of them have stayed. They 

are part of the city, expressing its hopes and aspirations, building its role 

models that cut across all ethnic divides, creating its foundations for the future, 

living, participating, fighting, winning?

Yes, the most obvious, and perhaps the most significant, 

visual symbol of the Punjabi Calcuttan has been the Sardar taxi-driver, whose 

dwindling numbers we today bemoan. At the street-level, he was the one who set 

the tone for the community?s acceptance. Hard work, courage, helpfulness, a largeness 

of heart that accompanied the largeness of frame ? these were the values that 

he had begun to establish even before the first taxis rolled down Esplanade. Why 

else is it then that even today, if there is a choice at the taxi-stand, you look 

for the once-familiar turbaned head behind the wheel?

The transport industry brought many of my Punjabi 

brethren to Calcutta, and they still seem to have retained a large measure of 

their control on that scenario. When you drive down BT Road you cannot miss their 

presence. The values for which the Sardar taxi-driver stood, re-articulated itself 

in another context. The highest reward perhaps came when Gyan Singh Sohanpal became 

transport minister in the Siddhartha Ray Cabinet. 

As a spin-off from the transport business came the 

dhabas, an area where the Punjabi has left his invincible mark, not only in management 

but even the cuisine. In fact, the cuisine of eastern Indian dhabas, born in Calcutta, 

is unique. So many of my non-Punjabi friends holidaying in Punjab have complained 

to me that though the tarka daal may have originated in the land of the 

five rivers, its art and secret blossomed only in the dhabas in and around Calcutta. 

Just as Britain has now usurped the chicken tikka masala, the tarka 

daal has been appropriated by Calcutta?s cuisine. The popularity of the tandoor 

? whether in its creation of the exotic chicken, or the simple roti ? is 

also something that the Punjabi has brought to eating here. 

The Punjabi presence in the hotel and restaurant business 

is nowhere restricted to dhabas alone. It includes even the Oberois, whose meteoric 

rise began in this part of the world. As far as restaurants are concerned, you 

will probably be tired of counting the numbers when it comes to Punjabi-owned 

establishments. And all of them are part of the city?s multi-tier eating habits. 

Even the leading discos in this city, its happening places for the young and svelte, 

are owned by Punjabis. 

The Calcutta Punjabi in fact has done a lot more than 

driving around or feeding this city. The positions occupied by him in corporate 

life has been significant. The list is so long, that I am afraid of causing offence 

by eliminating anyone. But there have been legends like a Keshav Dutt who came 

to be an actor with New Theatres Studios, played hockey for the leading clubs, 

and went to head one of the city?s biggest commercial establishments. There is 

also Yogi Deveshwar, who heads India?s largest multinational company, still holding 

onto Calcutta as its headquarters. There are other legends too that are not so 

well-known. Did you know that Raunaq Singh?s father owned a tyre vulcanising shop 

on Chittaranjan Avenue, and the great entrepreneur cut his teeth in business in 

this very city?

It would be easy to dismiss the Punjabi Calcuttan 

with these obvious accomplishments in business or corporate life if he had not 

matched it with achievements in other spheres. Take Gurbux, the hockey legend. 

The city?s passion for football had not only welcomed a Jarnail, but also created 

its own star in Mohan Singh, the Bhowanipore boy. The Maidan has seen many Punjabis, 

and I am sure many more will be seen.

The brawn-versus-brains joke does not seem to work 

in the case of Calcutta Punjabis, because their contribution to a city so sensitive 

to culture has not been insignificant either. The past has had masters like the 

painter Indra Dugar or singer Kundan Lal Saigal, who belonged deeply to this city. 

The past has also had an exceptional achiever in the celebrated Rabindrasangeet 

exponent Rajeshwari Datta, n?e Vasudev. In music, the present has a remarkable 

Amrik Singh Arora to offer. 

Calcutta?s cultural scenario has brought many other 

Punjabis to the fore. Like the National Award winning documentary filmmaker Gulbahar 

Singh Tateja, the maker of an offbeat Bangla film as well. A celebrated name in 

showbiz is Dolly Basu, whose contribution to Bangla theatre first as an actress, 

and later as a theatre activist, has been remarkable. 

What is it in the Punjabi Calcuttan that has prompted 

such successes? Sometimes I feel it has to do as much with Calcutta as it has 

to do with the Punjabi. This city, while it has at once made it possible for the 

community to succeed, has also assimilated it into its ambience. That is why you 

have a young IT entrepreneur like Jaswant Singh whose loyalty to the city is legendary. 

That is why Calcutta has the first woman taxi-driver in Jasbir Kaur. That is why 

my statistician friends tell me that Punjabi-Bengali marriages are among the highest 

in inter-community couples?

There may be many reasons, but I believe that the 

heart has its reasons, that reason cannot see.

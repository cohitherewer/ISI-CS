The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trouble rolls on relaid tracks

 BARUN GHOSH

 Come Sunday, an ordeal awaits passengers after tram services are resumed on the renovated 2.2-km stretch between Gariahat depot and the Park Circus junction. The passenger bays on the route have been demolished, and may never be reconstructed. 

 Tram services on the stretch have remained suspended since September 1 last year, for relaying of tracks embedded in concrete by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC).

 The Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) will conduct trial runs on Friday and Saturday nights before throwing the route open on Sunday.

 But the question of reconstructing the raised passenger bays has put the transport department in a spot.

 The CTC authorities are insisting on rebuilding the old bays. But the HRBC fears such a move would result in traffic chaos. 

 ?We cannot decide whether to rebuild all six passenger bays on the small stretch between Gariahat Road and Park Circus. The matter has to be discussed as a section of the people want the trams to ply straight to Park Circus from Gariahat, without any halt in between,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury told Metro. 

 He added that officials from the CTC, HRBC and Calcutta Police will discuss the matter in a meeting.

 Chowdhury, however, made it clear that trams will ply on the stretch as before from Sunday. ?The comfort of passengers is our primary concern,? he emphasised.

 Confident that all six passenger bays will be rebuilt at the old spots, the CTC authorities have asked its engineering department to put up its signboards near the locations.

 ?It is not possible to ply trams from Gariahat to Park Circus without any halt. That will not only inconvenience the passengers but also tell on our daily revenues,? said CTC managing director S.N. Pal. 

 He felt that vehicles hurtling down the newly-built Gariahat flyover would make it difficult for passengers to board trams unless bays were reconstructed. ?The trial run will help us understand the problems better,? Pal said. 

 A CTC survey has revealed that the company has incurred a loss of Rs 11 lakh during renovation of the stretch. ?We survive on 80 per cent subsidy. Things will become even more difficult for us if the passengers are not allowed to board trams from bays,? said a senior CTC official.

 He added that the company has received several letters from passengers, including schoolchildren, parents and old and infirm people, demanding that the bays be reconstructed at the old spots. 

 HRBC vice-chairman S.R. Banerjee, however, said: ?It has not yet been decided whether the bays will be rebuilt or not.?

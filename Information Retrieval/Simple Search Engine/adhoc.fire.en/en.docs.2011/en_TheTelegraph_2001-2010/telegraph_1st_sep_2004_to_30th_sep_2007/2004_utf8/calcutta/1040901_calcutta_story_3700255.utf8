The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Family killer was well-off

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AMP; SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Amader ei saparibare atmahotyar jonyo dayi amar kaku Amalendu Bikash Saha, chhoto kaki Anita Saha, o kakur shashuri Mina Das (My uncle Amalendu Bikash Saha, aunt Anita Saha and my uncles mother-in-law Mina Das are responsible for our suicide).

 The fallout of this note, written by Shibendu Saha: Amalendu and Anita have spent 42 days in custody. Shibendu had claimed that the machinations of these three had left him penniless and forced him to kill his family and himself on July 18.

 But the seizure list produced by police in court shows that Shibendu was anything but bankrupt. 

 The items recovered from the second-floor flat of the four-storey building on Tollygunge Road, where Nabendu Bikash (Shibendus father) lived with his family, included a kg of gold jewellery, 14 National Savings Certificates worth Rs 2 lakh, LIC policies in the name of Nabendu, Shibendu and his brother Krishnendu, and Rs 45,832 in cash.

 Police have also produced a list of bank accounts and gold ornaments belonging to Shibendus family found in the bank locker. A plot worth more than Rs 10 lakh was in Nabendus name, said defence lawyer Tamal Kanti Mukherjee. According to the seizure list, Shibendu and his family possessed more than Rs 30 lakh. The evidence produced before the court and the allegations contradict each other, Mukherjee reasoned.

 All that the police could produce as evidence to nail Amalendu and his wife is a National Savings Certificate, worth Rs 10,000, in his name. It was found in Shibendus flat.

 Additional chief judicial magistrate S.N. Ghosh on Tuesday expressed displeasure over the tardy pace of investigation. You have no right to keep the accused in jail for an indefinite period. If you have any evidence, produce it at the earliest, Ghosh told the investigating officer, before remanding the duo in judicial custody for another 14 days. 

 How can the accused be confined to jail on the basis of a statement made by an insane person (Shibendu), who took two-and-a-half hours to execute his devilish plan? counsel Mukherjee wondered.

 We should find out the possible beneficiaries. It is certainly not Amalendu or Anita. As far as we know, Jayasree (Shibendus sister) and her husband will inherit the property, he added.

 An officer of Charu Market police station said: Were keeping in mind what Shibendus friends told us that he was a drug addict suffering from depression.

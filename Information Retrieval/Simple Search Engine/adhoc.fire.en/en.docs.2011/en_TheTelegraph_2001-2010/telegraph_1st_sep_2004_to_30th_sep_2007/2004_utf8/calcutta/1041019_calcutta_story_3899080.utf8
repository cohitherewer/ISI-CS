 Accused refuses to confess

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Piyali Das, an accused in the gynaecologist Susil Pal murder case, refused to give a confessional statement to the Howrah sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) on Monday. 

 According to the police, Pal was killed after he refused to abort Piyali?s child.

 Court officials said the CID had prayed before the SDJM that Piyali be given a chance to confess that she was privy to the murder. ?But, like the other seven accused, Piyali refused to confess even after appearing before the magistrate,? said Dilip Das, assistant public prosecutor. 

 The magistrate rejected the bail petition of the eight accused and remanded them in judicial custody till November 22. 

 Piyali, a doctor at a maternity clinic run by Bally Municipality, was arrested in Karaya on October 15. She has been charged with suppression of facts and criminal conspiracy. 

 The SDJM had remanded her in judicial custody along with her baby. 

 Sleuths working on the case said the accused are given an opportunity to admit to their crime, to enable them to get speedier justice. 

 ?But as all eight have refused to confess, they will have to face a long trial in court,? said an CID officer. 

 Senior officers are, however, confident they will be able to file the chargesheet soon.

 Home raids cap hotel block

 - Trinamul?s sleaze protest sets off FIRs, cop suspensions

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 The houses of some Trinamul Congress councillors in Salt Lake were raided on Wednesday in connection with the agitation by party activists in front of Hotel Merlin Park on Tuesday afternoon. 

 During the stir, the protesters had shut and bolted the hotel?s front gate. 

 First information reports (FIRs) have been lodged against three women leaders ? two of them councillors. 

 Besides, four cops of Bidhannagar (East) police station have been suspended on charges of dereliction of duty. 

 Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), said: ?I have sought a report from my officers. I will decide on the matter after going through the report.? 

 Hotel Merlin Park is owned by Avtar Singh, husband of CPM parliamentarian Jyotirmoyee Sikdar. He was arrested on Independence Day on charges of running a sleaze racket at the hotel. 

 On Tuesday afternoon, a group of 10 Trinamul activists had staged a demonstration in front of the hotel, on the Salt Lake-Rajarhat border. Seven employees were inside the three-storeyed building when the protesters locked the gate.

 A team from Bidhannagar (East) police station later broke open the gate and rescued the employees.

 The incident sent ripples across the state administration, which has decided to act tough. 

 ?Orders have come from the highest level to deal sternly with the case. Police in Salt Lake are under pressure on this issue,? an officer said, on condition of anonymity.

 The Trinamul councillors against whom FIRs were registered have been charged with wrongful confinement and heckling policemen. ?If the charges are proved, they may be handed prison terms for two years,? the officer said.

 Party sources said the councillors may surrender before the Barrackpore sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court on Thursday.

 Salt Lake municipality chairman Dilip Gupta said he was not aware of the police raids on the Trinamul leaders? homes. ?I am inquiring into the matter,? he added.

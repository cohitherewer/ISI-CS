The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pool to pole party

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI, ZEESHAN JAWED 

The 

Taj poolside was the mellow warm-up zone on Christmas Eve with lilting music and 

a lavish buffet spread. 

 E amp;M, the Filipino band playing at The Junction, decided to take the fun outdoors to present a rare mix of old favourites and modern melodies. In a nutshell, they played everything from The Beatles to Britney Spears. 

 More musical treats were provided by Calcutta-based 

saxophonist Paul Mallick, known for playing old romantic hits. 

 To go along with food for the soul was some tangible sustenance from around the world. The buffet spread, comprising 70-odd dishes, packed in everything from Indian and Chinese to French and Italian delights.

 Pole pick

 What happens when Christmas Eve coincides with the birthday of the hottest disco in town? You party without a care in the world with Eyes Wide Shut! 

 The much-hyped birthday party theme at Tantra lured in an unprecedented turnout of over 2,000 party people, celebrating in style. 

 The bash turned out to be steamy with glamorous pole dancers getting into the act, waving their bodies in mid-air from makeshift hanging balconies. 

 The exclusive member?s bar, Bodhi, was packed with the city?s who?s who including businessman Karan Paul and actress Debasree Roy. 

 Amid the fervour, people almost missed the launch of Glen Drummond, an eight-year-old single malt Scotch whisky from the house of Mason and Summers, that took place at Bodhi the same night. Had it not been for free pegs doing the rounds, that is.

 Turk trump

 Indian and Turkish dance performances made up the double Christmas treat dished out by Big Ben, the pub at Kenilworth. 

 Item girl Ashwini Kulkarni set the tone for a sensual night with her killer moves, which looked straight out of her small-time big-screen projects like Boom and Khel. Gyrations and gestures to songs like Urre jaise hawaeyien, Dhoom machale and Janaab-e ali had the entire crowd joining her on the dance floor. 

 In her second sequence, the siren decided to do a remix run. Kaliyon ka chaman, Kaanta laga and Kabhie aar kabhie paar were her tribute to the ?good ol? days of Bollywood? on behalf of the item girls? fraternity. ?As long as people want to listen to these songs, I will keep performing them,? said Ashwini shrugging her pretty shoulders. 

 Post midnight, it was time for some foreign fun. Two Turkish dancers, in their skimpiest best, took to the dance floor and kept up the tempo thereafter. While Ashwini was allowed to do her stuff without any hindrance, a couple of stags tried to get cosy with the exotic beauties. After the brawl, the pub staff had to work overtime to curb the rowdy lot. 

 Arabian night

 Christmas Eve was the first big-ticket event at the six-month-old Red Kitchen and Lounge in Enclave, Alipore. Having recently got its bar licence, the plush lounge-restaurant celebrated December 24 with an exclusive party for select couples, which made for comfortable leg and lounging space. 

 Unlike other night-clubs, here you didn?t have unknown people elbowing you all the time or stepping on your toes on their way in and out. ?We didn?t want a large crowd today, we just wanted beautiful people to have a good time,? smiled Ashim Mewar of the lounge. 

 The entertainment package was similar to most other places in the city, complete with a foreign dancer and a DJ. But it was the graceful performance of Arabian dancer Juliana that made all the difference. DJ Anil played hits from round the year, making for a good rewind session.

 English act

 Fusion was the Christmas Eve flavour at the lounge bar in Golden Park. The Las Vegas Stardust Girls troupe from London ruled the party at Fusion. 

 The three dancers, who have to their credit scintillating performances at similar venues in various parts of the world including Switzerland, Italy, Turkey, Tunisia, Portugal and Germany, took to the packed dance floor at the stroke of midnight. 

 A more-than-willing crowd made way for the English sensations clad in bare minimum. 

 It was difficult to make out the dancers from the rest of the gang after a while, as everybody joined in for one big party!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Asok called to hearing

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya will have to attend a high court hearing on Monday in a case relating to road maintenance. 

 Bhattacharya, who is also chairman of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), was asked by the court to attend the session and clarify why contempt proceedings should not be brought against him for not filing a report on the status of the city?s roads, as ordered.

 On Friday, Partha Sarathi Basu, lawyer for minister Bhattacharya, prayed that his client be exempted from attending the Monday hearing. 

 The division bench of Justice A. Kabir and Justice A.K. Bishi declined to accept the plea.

 Doctors sound alert on bad cholesterol level

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 

 Alarmed at rising heart diseases in the city, especially among people with a high-risk lifestyle, city-based cardiologists have issued a warning to reduce the Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) blood cholesterol levels to 70-100 mg/dl or face a near-fatal heart attack.

 Cardiologists say that in a city where 90 per cent of the people visit a cardiologist for the first time after a heart attack and 70 per cent have a family history of heart diseases, lowering the LDL below the recommended 130 mg/dl is one way of saving lives.

 ?Most Calcuttans with a bad heart condition do not heed the advice of controlling the lipid profile. Instead, they tend to lead fast-paced or extremely sedentary lives. We are now asking these patients to be extremely careful about the LDL cholesterol level. Else, things may spin out of control,? says interventional cardiologist Shuvo Dutta. 

 The big hospitals in Calcutta, including RN Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences, BM Birla Heart Research Centre and Woodlands Hospital, together perform at least 400-600 heart surgeries in a year. 

 And nearly 50 per cent of the patients, advised to strictly monitor their triglyeride and LDL cholesterol levels, fail to do so and complain of some kind of recurrence. 

 As a result, cardiologists are not taking chances and are advising patients to be extremely careful about it. ?Taking a heart-friendly diet with plenty of fibre and exercise are simple ways of keeping LDL cholesterol level in check. In serious cases, drugs such as statins and ezetimibe can be of help,? Dutta adds.

 Normally, LDL cholesterol, known as bad cholesterol, starts to settle on the walls of the blood vessels of the heart and then proceeds to block the coronary arteries, impeding free movement of blood, doctors explain.

 On the other hand, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol destroys the LDLs and prevents blockages within the coronary arteries. 

 ?We have started to advise patients to try and bring down the LDL cholesterol and triglyeride levels to about 70 mg/dl. People who do not have a heart condition can keep it around the 120mg/dl mark to the most,? advises cardiac surgeon Ajay Kaul.

 The lower goals of blood cholesterol was set by city doctors after reviewing the blood lipid levels, including total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, along with triglyeride levels, among patients who have high-risk factors or have ischaemic heart disease or even had coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty.

 ?With about 10 per cent of the Calcutta population suffering from ischaemic heart disease, lowering the LDL levels below the recommended levels is the safest way of preventing a heart attack,? says cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar.

 According to the US National Cholesterol Education Programme, patients with ischaemic heart disease are in the ?high-risk category? for heart attacks and urgently need to modify their lifestyle.

 However, doctors feel that most Calcuttans are extremely ignorant of their heart condition, with 52 per cent believing that they need not go to a doctor despite having a bad heart condition and a family history as well. 

 ?It may be an uphill task, but we will definitely try to achieve our desired results, because that is the only option left,? cardiologist Dutta added.

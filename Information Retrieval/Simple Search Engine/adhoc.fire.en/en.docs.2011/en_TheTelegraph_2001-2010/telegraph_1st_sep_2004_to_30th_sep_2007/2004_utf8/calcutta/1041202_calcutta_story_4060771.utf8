 Cheap as water: Members of a club practise 

in the Lakes 

 The article ?Soiree gunman in net?, October 30, once 

again proves how goons and politicians are hand in hand these days. Whenever a 

criminal is held from the Salt Lake-Lake Town-Dum Dum area, the name of Subhas 

Chakraborty invariably crops up. Isn?t that rather strange? 

 A few months ago, when police arrested some hooligans from Salt Lake Stadium, they confessed to having connections with Chakraborty. Hatkata Dilip too has confessed that he has links with the minister, who, as always, has denied knowing the criminal. 

 It is an open secret that political leaders patronise criminals for their vested interests. The goons try to remain in their good books by taking recourse to rigging, capturing booths and terrorising people during the elections. For the rest of the year, the leaders give them shelter and ensure that they can carry on with their business undisturbed. It?s a simple ?give and take?. 

 But this easy symbiosis comes under strain when a goon, after being caught red-handed, names his godfather and calls him for help. That is enough to make the Communists go red in the face. 

 The case of history-sheeter Bulton, who was patronised by CPM leaders, should serve as an example. As soon as he was flushed out from his hide-out, the CPM top brass washed its hands off him. 

 This time, police should investigate the whole incident carefully so that neither side gets away lightly. 

 As for Subhasbabu, can he stay off such dirty games and concentrate on his sports department duties? 

Debyani Basu,

Apropos your article ?Lake clubs plumb rent depths?, November 2, it is imperative that the Calcutta Improvement Trust revises the rents of the clubs in the area for the development of Rabindra Sarobar. The clubs pay paltry rents considering the present market value of the land. Charity should be meted out to the needy, and not to the affluent. Apathy in this regard is uncalled for. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

The article ?Flurry to find fake notes?, November 1, addresses a serious problem. The circulation of fake currency notes is rampant near the Bangladesh border. Laymen find it difficult to identify fake notes and often end up incurring a loss. Even post offices do not have devises to identify fake notes. Their customers end up paying the price.

 Apropos the report ?Life, through the colourful lens?, November 1, it was great to learn of the exhibition of photographs by former bank officer B.P. Maiti. Given that the tribal population in the Andaman amp; Nicobar islands is on the decline, the government should do something to stem its extinction.

The report ?Varsity sleaze panel draws a blank?, October 30, highlights the need for sex education. Awareness is the most effective weapon against sexual harassment. Law alone cannot improve the situation. Which is not to say that the panel is unnecessary: it has a vital role in the fight against sexual offences. 

Anil Kumar Sen,

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.

The love of some Calcuttans for our four-legged pals must be appreciated (Abandoned, ailing and afraid, October 28). Unfortunately, the man on the street shows little care for the ?two-legged animals? starving on the streets, where Mother Teresa once walked. 

Siby Joseph, 

Bally.

Apropos the report ?Eden Gardens at a price?, November 1, in The City Diary, the move to charge entry fees from visitors to Eden Gardens was overdue. The security measures in the garden should be improved with the money collected. 

Ronita Dutta,

Jadavpur.

The release of funds by the state government for clearance of bio-medical waste is a blessing (Fund flow for medical waste war, October 30). It is difficult for patients to recover quickly in the current environment in government hospitals. The situation is so bad that those visiting the hospitals run the risk of infection. Removal of bio-medical waste is an essential service. Lack of funds should not be an excuse for accretion of waste. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

Behala

The report ?Hospital trouble follows death?, October 28, made me sad. Every day a lot of patients die in the city hospitals due to negligence of the authorities. The government doesn?t do anything to improve the situation, resulting in more such deaths. It is really shameful. 

Atif Ayaz, 

Serampore

Dowry has been the death of innumerable women (Married for love, burnt for dowry, October 26). State governments should educate students about its evils. Social workers, village headmen, lawyers and teachers should spread awareness of its ill effects. 

B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum.

It is great that the state government is taking steps to stop harassment of tourists at Howrah and Sealdah stations by touts (Safety route to tourism revenue, October 29). The newcomers to this city are the worst sufferers. 

Sourish Misra,

Salt Lake.

A photograph of Piu Sarkar at an exhibition was carried in the newspaper on November 25. The caption mentioned that her works were on display at the exhibition. This is incorrect. Sarkar was there just as a guest at the show.

 Calcutta was urged to Think Pink, the reigning colour of a glittering evening at Taj Bengal on Sunday.

 The fashion and musical extravaganza organised by Satya Paul in association with Women?s Cancer Initiative Tata Memorial Hospital (WCI-TMH), Mumbai, was the city chapter of a series of events to create awareness and raise funds to combat breast cancer among Indian women.

 October has been dedicated to the cause of breast cancer the world over, with the colour pink being its symbol.

 Charity pitch

 What started with an emotional prelude by cancer survivor Devika Bhojwani ? who has been instrumental in setting up a foundation for cancer in women, such as breast, cervical and ovarian, in association with the Tata Memorial Hospital ? witnessed much generosity from the cr?me-de-la-cr?me of Calcutta gathered in the Crystal Room of the star hotel celebrating its 15th birthday.

 While our boys in blue fought and lost down south to the guests from Down Under, the Indian cricket team did better at the auction that followed. Two bats signed by Sourav Ganguly and Steve Waugh went down for Rs 51,000 and Rs 50,000 respectively. 

 The ladies in the audience sat up straighter as the third item to go under the hammer was an Ishi?s diamond ring adorned with nine sparkling stones. Priced at over Rs 1 lakh, the jewel went for a steal at Rs 75,000.

 Just when you thought the booty bargaining had come to an end, a generous gesture from Rakhi Sarkar, of CIMA Gallery, took everyone by surprise. She took off the topaz and emerald earrings she was wearing (a Saba Ali Khan creation), and gave it up to be auctioned. It turned out to be the highest-value sale of the evening, at Rs 1 lakh.

 Style check

 A line specially created for the cause was unfurled next by Satya Paul, amid a flamboyant performance by Bikram Ghosh and his group Rhythmscape. City models rustled in saris alongside their counterparts from other cities like Indrani Dasgupta, Sheetal Malhar, Laxmi Rana and Monikangana Dutta, all dazzling in myriad shades of pink.

 The feminine fervour was heightened with polkas in a range of sizes dotting the drapes. Complementary shades of violet, blue and green added to the vigour while blacks and creams helped dramatise the rather warm palette. A smattering of zardosi and Swarovski crystals gelled with the festive mood.

 While the collection has a free flow of saris in crepe, georgette and light silk, it featured some smart evening gowns and churidar-kurta sets as well. There was a sprinkling of the signature Satya Paul scribble for those who did not want to go the dappled way.

 The girls may have stolen the show with a cause, but the boys made for competent sidekicks as they strutted some DAKS ensembles.

 The apparel and accessories brand from Britain available at Burlingtons? flaunted a range of formals, semi-formals and casual wear, featuring some interesting linen and tweed. They were made more appealing by the offer of donating 10 per cent of proceeds from all company-owned stores across metros to the cause of breast cancer this month.

 Bips blitz

 The best of the evening was reserved for the last romp, with the sultry Bipasha Basu making a stunning appearance in the showstopper ? a kamarbandh by Ishi?s, valued at Rs 2 crore.

 A level-headed Bips knew exactly what the belt blitz was all about. ?When you have a name, you have the ability to reach out to more people,? said the actress of her association with the cancer cause. 

 The pledge apart, the ?world?s most expensive kamarbandh? stole the party. The one-and-a-half-year-old brand is given to similar stunts as was witnessed last year when it launched a Rs 1 crore diamond tie in association with Satya Paul flaunted by Salman Khan.

 The bauble, supposed to ?toast the essence of a woman?, is bejewelled with 8,000 diamonds weighing 200 karats, set in over a kilo of 18-karat pink gold. The design is supposed to depict the evolution of womanhood from birth till death. It starts at the naval, signifying birth, and slowly blossoms into a whirl of drips and drops at the waist, symbolising a full-grown woman and her many facets and manifestations, before it gracefully tapers off a little below the hip.

 Who?s who

 The do was sure one of the snazziest the city has seen of late and it would have been nothing short of social suicide not to be seen at it.

 The crowd converged at cocktail hour (rather dry as a result) and beyond and the notable names included the US consul general George . Sibley and wife Lee Alison, Harsh and Madhu Neotia, actresses June and Piu, Shamlu Dudeja, Komal and Ratul Sood, Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta and Rita Bhimani.

 Some were enthused enough to do a little catwalk as well, all for the cause. Shamlu Dudeja and Lee Alison Sibley surprised with their ramp charms while June and Piu glided on in a show of sari solidarity.

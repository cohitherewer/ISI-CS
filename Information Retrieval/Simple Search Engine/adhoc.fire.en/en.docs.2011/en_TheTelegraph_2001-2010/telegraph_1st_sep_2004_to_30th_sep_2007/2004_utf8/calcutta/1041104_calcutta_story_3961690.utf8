Himalayan kingdom on tourist hunt

 About 87,000 Indians visited Nepal in 2003, nearly 34 per cent of the Himalayan kingdom?s tourist pie. While Calcuttans flocked to the country during the Pujas last year, the word from travel agents was a definite dip in numbers this festive season. But the troubled view scaring visitors is more hype than reality, Govind Prasad Kusum, consul-general of Nepal, claimed on Wednesday.

 Maoist rebel activity and the resultant disquiet have pushed tourists ? at least from India and especially Calcutta ? off the Nepal route, although Western travellers have been trooping in.

 But Kusum, with the ministry of commerce and not foreign affairs, said his government was confident that tourism figures would be higher this year than 2003.

 ?We do advise people not to venture deep into remote areas in the west and north-western areas, but the rest of the country poses no security threat, particularly to Indians,? assured Kusum, at INOX, Forum to give away a prize of a holiday to Nepal to lucky winner Aparna Bhatter.

 ?None of the tourist areas, from pilgrimage sights like Pashupatinath, to scenic areas like Annapurna and Nagarkot, have been affected by any kind of trouble. A few Americans were troubled occasionally. But they are avid trekkers and wander off on their own to remote areas. We advise them to let us know when they visit places that are not tourist hotspots. But tourists haven?t been hurt,? he insisted.

 Indians in particular are not in harms way at all, stressed Kusum. ?There are absolutely no anti-Indian sentiments among the Nepalese people at all. As for the guerrillas, they are fighting everyone. So there is absolutely no problem.? 

 It was with that aim in mind that the Nepal Tourism Board tied up with the Elgin Road multiplex for a slogan contest, with a trip for two to the nation. 

 ?Tourism is the biggest foreign currency earner for Nepal, at 24 per cent. If tourism is affected, local people will be hurt. But we expect more people to come here. And the number of Indians should be close to a lakh by the end of this year, we hope,? Kusum signed off.

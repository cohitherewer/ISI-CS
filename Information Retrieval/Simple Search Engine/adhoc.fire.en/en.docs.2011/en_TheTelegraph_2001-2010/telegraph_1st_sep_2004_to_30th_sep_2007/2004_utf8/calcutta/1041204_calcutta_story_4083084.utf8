The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Carriers cry for damages

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The softest target for the brickbat-happy bandh brigade has decided that enough is enough. For the first time in bandh-hit Bengal, bus operators are poised to move court, seeking compensation for vehicles damaged during shutdown hours.

 At least 14 vehicles ? 10 state buses and four private buses? were damaged by Trinamul Congress activists during Friday?s bandh. The casualty zone covered Bhowanipore, Chetla, Alipore, Barasat, Tollygunge, Garia, Kalakar Street, Brabourne Road, EM Bypass and Pailan Park.

 ?Spurred by the court order on payment of compensation for bandh-related damage and disruption, many operators defied the Trinamul call. Now, we will move court to demand damages,?? Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha said on Friday.

 The high court, while hearing a public interest litigation on bandhs, had said anybody could appeal to the court for compensation if he/she incurred any loss or damage due to a bandh. The court had also directed insurance companies to clarify their stand on payment of compensation.

 ?The insurance companies refuse to pay for vehicles damaged in a bandh. Now, if the court can arrange for compensation, either from the government or from the insurance company, you will find normal bus services during any bandh in the future,?? said Saha.

 Sadhan Das, Joint Council of Bus Syndicate president, was less sure. He blamed the government for failing to keep its word on providing security cover for public transport on thoroughfares.

 ?The transport department failed to protect its own buses, so how will it protect ours? No bus operator will dare to ply during bandhs if the government fails to take any action against those who damaged vehicles on Friday,?? he warned.

 Calcutta Tramways Company managing director R.N. Pal said: ?I do not know who will pay, but a detailed report will be submitted to the transport department on how seven of our buses were damaged.?

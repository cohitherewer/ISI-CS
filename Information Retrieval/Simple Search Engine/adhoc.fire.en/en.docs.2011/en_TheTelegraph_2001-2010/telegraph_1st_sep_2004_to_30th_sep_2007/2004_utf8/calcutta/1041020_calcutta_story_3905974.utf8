This Saptami you can be at...Puja Getaway

SANKAR SRIDHAR

Draped in silence and shadows, a path winds through 

a bamboo grove to Rajhaat village. It?s high noon and siesta hour for the villagers. 

Just when we are thinking of ways to while away our time till afternoon, a shrill 

wail fractures the silence and a momentary explosion of colour drives the grey 

from the grove as a peacock spreads its plume.

Mango orchards and peacocks, that?s what the village 

? off NH-2 and a 20-minute rickshaw ride from Bandel station ? is famous for. 

The fruit still flourishes, but the same, sadly, can?t be said of the bird.

But peacocks or no peacocks, Rajhaat makes for a great 

escape from the Puja rush. Well connected by train and just a few minutes? walk 

from a foot-worn fork on the highway, the village is set in idyllic surroundings.

If scouting for peacocks, which are rumoured to have 

moved further away to the adjacent village of Gandhi Gram, is not your image of 

an ideal day out, the trip can be spiced up by taking in a dash of history, a 

sprinkling of science and even a picnic to wrap up the holiday.

The round trip, which is best enjoyed by booking an 

auto from Bandel station, would include a visit to Mayur Mahal, a recreation park, 

picnic spot and boating zone all rolled in one, around four km from Rajhaat. Suwakhal 

Sanglagna Paryatan Kendra, another park a minute away from Mayur Mahal, also houses 

an energy education centre where visitors are shown how water, wind and sun are 

tapped to produce energy.

The road to the Paryatan Kendra, which will be the 

last destination, touches Debanandapur village before Rajhaat. Debanandapur village 

is known in history for being a trading hub used by the Dutch. Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay 

also called this place home.

A museum and library, Sarat Chandra Smriti Mandir, 

is a must visit here. The library, apart from housing many objects used by the 

novelist, also has a wing dedicated to photographs that showcase his life.

It takes around four minutes to reach Rajhaat from 

the library and those keen on tracking peacocks can enlist the help of villagers. 

Tracking is tiring work and not always rewarded. But rest assured, the sheer thrill 

of peacock-spotting will help you work up a king-size appetite, which can be satisfied 

at the Paryatan Kendra?s catering services.

A botanical garden, flower park, designated children?s 

area, mini zoo and picnic spots overlooking a lake are other attractions here.

Evenings are a good time to be at the park, given 

the colourful fountains and great illumination that add to the ambience.

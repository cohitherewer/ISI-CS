The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mini to max at 13

 He has challenged Kapil Dev, danced with Mandira Bedi and even stumped Sourav Ganguly, forcing Team India captain to ask: ?Just who is this guy?? In the process, 13 year-old Sameer Khan has put a smile on the lips of Indian TV viewers and won over more than a few hearts.

 The rise of the MAX kid (as he?s known to everyone) is a typical rags-to-riches story that is played out in so many movies by Sameer?s idol Amitabh Bachchan ? someone he is portraying in the latest MAX ad campaign.

 ?It?s a story about a small, simple school boy living in the gullies of Grant Road in Mumbai and how his dreams come true,? says Tushar Shah, vice-president, marketing and commercial, MAX.

 ?The channel?s Gully Cricket campaign was to be shot by Prahlad Kakkar?s production company Genesis. Sameer?s cousin happened to work for Genesis at the time and was on the lookout for a talented boy to cast in the campaign. He noticed Sameer acting one day and asked him to audition for the MAX campaign. The on-screen chemistry between him and Kapil was an instant hit,? adds Shah.

 The result was the commercial that had Sameer bowling to Kapil (in what looks uncannily like Calcutta?s Hindu hostel) with a run-up that goes on for miles and spans the city, only to be stopped at the stumps by Kapil. Screeching to a halt, the kid offers Kaps a helmet and warns, ?Dekh loonga!? 

 Sameer was equally impressive in the sequel where it was Kapil?s turn to bowl to him. The teenager casually stops the Haryana Hurricane when he?s about to deliver the ball, since he is busy shooting the Aaja mahi ve song. 

 Later projects had him playing Pepsi?s Toss Ka Boss and featuring alongside Mandira Bedi, Kapil and Charu Sharma in a music video promoting ICC Champions Trophy.

 Understandably, working with the celebs has been a dream-come-true for the boy next door. He had always wanted to become a hero, long before being selected by MAX, but rubbing shoulders with some of them brought him closer to the dream, if only a little. A huge fan of Amitabh and Hrithik Roshan, Sameer?s only unfulfilled desire right now is to visit Dubai, where his father works. 

 Though becoming a familiar face on TV has made him popular in school and in family circles, like any other boy his age, Sameer still loves playing cricket, football, volleyball and even pakda-pakdi.

The latest MAX outdoor campaign for Main Hoon Don 

? The Amitabh Bachchan Film Festival, finds him emulating Big B in scenes from 

Deewar, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar and Agneepath. With more projects 

on the MAX drawing board, this little Khan, for sure, is here to stay.

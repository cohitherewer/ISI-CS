National Children?s Science Congress (NCSC) is a unique opportunity for children of 10 to 17 years of age to express their scientific temperament and knowledge and to make their dreams come true. The objectives of the annual programme, initiated in 1993, include providing a forum for the young scientists of the country to pursue their natural curiosity and quench their thirst for creativity through experimentation on open-ended problems. It makes them feel the science and scientific phenomenon at work around them, which they can learn by identifying and solving problems. Thus, the learning process is related to the physical and social environment of their own surroundings.

 NCSC stimulates the child?s scientific temperament through a process of learning the scientific methodology of observation, collection of data, experimentation, analysis and ultimately arriving at conclusions and presenting the findings at appropriate levels.

 The congress is held from December 27 to 31 in different cities under a specific focal theme. After a thorough scrutiny at district and state levels all over the country, about 500 children take part in the five-day deliberations and fun-filled activities. This year?s (12th) National Level Congress will be held at Cotton College, Guwahati. 

 The focal theme is Harness Water Resources for a Better Future, with six sub-themes based on this. The state-level NCSC for West Bengal was held on November 27 and 28 at Loreto Day School, Sealdah.

 As a prelude to the programme, children, their guiding teachers and other state organisers worked for months to design, work on and finalise the projects. Nineteen districts have taken part in the programme. 

 The district-level congresses were held in October and November with about 500 projects being presented by groups of three to five participants, under the guidance of a teacher.

 At the state level, 120 projects were presented and evaluated. For the national level, only 30 of the best will be screened and the leaders of the two best projects will present their works before the country?s highest and most prestigious scientific body, the Indian Science Congress, to be held in Gujarat in January 2005.

 Colours of culture

 For the past eight years, St Xavier?s Collegiate School has been organising a student exchange programme with Belvedere College, Dublin, Ireland. Fifteen Irish students with their teachers come to Calcutta to do community service and to get a feel of poverty in our city. 

 Similarly, 15 boys are chosen from St Xavier?s Collegiate School for a reciprocal visit. Every Irish student stays in the home of an Indian boy, to experience the difference between the Occident and the Orient. 

 The Irish group this year came to the city on November 21. According to previously-planned lists, the boys were allotted their residences with their hosts (the Xaverians) and we got a great opportunity to know them better. 

 The two main work centres are Loreto, Sealdah, and St George?s, Bowbazar. Apart from that, they visit towns like Titagarh and several villages to teach. The intention of the programme is to train the Belvedere students to travel, take care of themselves and then find their way back home. For the Xaverians, it is an experience on how to treat guests who are completely unknown to them. 

 On November 24, we had the welcome ceremony at St Xavier?s Collegiate School. It started off with the lighting of the lamp and a brief speech, a synopsis of Calcutta. One of the boys sang a the song Perfect by Simple Plan. After that, three Xaverians performed the Hindi song Neeley neeley ambar. Next, on stage, the Irish group gave us a true feel of Irish culture. 

 After the show, they started off with a brief introduction to Irish history. Then there was a short speech on post-1916 Ireland. A few songs later was an ace musical performance with Irish instruments. 

 Then, Donal Ridge, the student I am hosting, gave the introduction to the Irish poem Nil Aon Ni, penned by Cathal O?Searcagh in 1959, where he speaks of his love for his birthplace in Donegal. He describes the peace and tranquillity of country life, the beautiful scenery and wandering hills. In contrast, the poet dislikes life in the city of Dublin. He describes the excessive noise, the pollution and dirty suburbs. More singing and some speeches ended the session.

 Since the arrival of Donal Ridge, I have realised the difference in the two cultures. But while India and Ireland might have a lot of differences ? culture, tradition, heritage, language, lifestyle, etc. ? the flags share the same colours!

 Eve meets Lolita

 Where does the new-age woman stand with relation to the communications industry? Do media perceptions reflect or distort her image? Is the modern woman a synthesis of Eve and Lolita? 

 These were some of the questions explored in the seminar When Eve met Lolita: The Woman and Changing Media Perceptions, organised by nine students of Symbiosis Institute of Mass Communication, Pune, as part of their annual series of seminars. The nationwide event, Footprints 2004, took place in Mumbai, Kochi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and Shillong before it came to Calcutta earlier this month. It then moved on to New Delhi and Ahmedabad.

 Footprints 2004 at the Bharatiya Bhasha Parishad brought together personalities like filmmakers Goutam Ghose, Moumita Tarafdar and Sudeshna Roy, theatre critic Ananda Lal and Indrani Sen from the field of advertising. After the inaugural address by the director of Symbiosis Prof Keval J. Kumar, Goutam Ghose and Moumita Tarafdar spoke about the commodification of the female body and about the gradual increase in awareness of women?s rights issues in the media, respectively. Parenting Alone, a national award-winning documentary by Tarafdar, was also screened. 

 Journalist Monideepa Banerjee elaborated on the experience of women in the field of TV journalism, pointing out some positive tendencies as seen in the film Lakshya. The evolution of the role of women in various media from the 1980s was outlined by Sudeshna Roy, who also explained the need for a woman to hold her own while making her work accessible and appealing to the masses. 

 Ananda Lal presented a more theoretical aspect of the role of the media and its responsibility to the people. Finally, Indrani Sen discussed the changing face of women in Indian advertising from the 1950s to the present, and its relation to reality.

 The seminar was attended by students and media aspirants. The Symbiosis team succeeded in creating a forum where it had an opportunity to interact with those who have an inner understanding of the communications industry, providing aspirants with valuable insights. 

 The event was an enlightening one, in which the very relevant issues of feminism and gender, and the equally relevant debate regarding the media and its role and responsibility, were discussed.

In short...

One of the most prestigious events in the Calcutta 

open quiz calender, the Argus Open, was held on the lawns of Dalhousie Institute 

on November 20. Over 70 teams competed against each other through a couple of 

written rounds for a spot in the eight-team final. 

 The nine-round final included an audio-visual connection round and a theme round on entertainment, which proved to be quite a hit with the hundreds of spectators, some of whom, no doubt, stayed back with an eye on the generous audience prizes. 

 While five of the eight teams went neck and neck, Octette had a slender lead till it was pipped at the post by Dalhousie Institute and Answering Service. The former won the event by a tiebreak. Veteran quiz master R.M. Sen conducted the finals.

 nOutgoing Governor Viren J. Shah hosted his last bash for children from various NGOs recently. The annual programme is organised by Shamlu Dudeja?s Calcutta Foundation. The Interact District Council this year supported the event. 

 The mild winter afternoon was brightened by expressions of elation on the faces of the 1,200-odd youngsters entering Raj Bhavan. This year, there were kids from the montessori chain Kangaroo performing a dance, skit and a medley of songs. Dressed in colourful outfits they entertained one and all. 

 The children from the NGOs soon took centrestage with each one putting up something. The governor encouraged the children to stick to education and live honest lives. ?Life mein padhai karo, aage badho,? he signed off.

Making a mark

 He?s only in Class III, but already quite a science sensation. Sreeman Beetehotra Roy, a student of Ramakrishna Mission Centenary Primary School, is the winner of the first prize in Science Talent Search Examination 2004.

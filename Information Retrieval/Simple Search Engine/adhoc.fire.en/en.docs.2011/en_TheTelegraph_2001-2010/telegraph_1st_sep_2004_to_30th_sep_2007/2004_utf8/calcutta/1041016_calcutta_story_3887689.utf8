The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Charge of the band brigade

Eye on Calcutta

Barry O?Brien

For all the non- believers who have neither ears nor 

eyes for it, here?s reason why the new music is worth tuning in to

?Conversion? is a bad word in some parts of India 

today. So called ?converters? are being targeted by armies or senas who 

seem to be getting less saner by the day. Their softest targets are the folk who 

have deep faith in the long-haired lover of all mankind who started touching lives 

some 2,000 years ago and hasn?t stopped since. I too am one of them, who follow 

the lover who said, ?Never mind, turn the other cheek?. So, I know it?s a bit 

of a risk, but I?m going to try and be a ?converter? myself and get all you non-believers 

to come on board. No worries, don?t turn the page! Like you, I too strongly believe 

that religion and faith are personal byapaars, not to be discussed with 

the wife, let alone with you through a newspaper column. I?m only talking about 

?converting? you, musically. 

All prospective converts must study the Conversion 

Table and other tables on this page, pick up a couple of albums, listen to them 

with an open mind and, if converted, spread the word. You must target non-believers, 

particularly those who think that Chandrabindoo is only the last letter of the 

Bengali alphabet and Bhoomi is the word that is raked up every five years, pre-election 

time in UP. 

Last week, I promised that I would tell you more about 

?a conscience-keeping generation of singers and writers who have their fingers 

firmly on the pulse? of their fans ? and the number is growing by the day! It?s 

time to keep that promise and attempt ? quite blatantly ? to increase the number 

that believes in them. So, if you love music and believe that it is the food of 

love, chew on this. 

It goes back to the late sixties and early seventies 

when The Beatles and Vietnam were ?rocking? the world. Nearer home, hippies and 

Naxals were going ?great guns?. Post all this, was lurking an informed and concerned 

middle-class Bengali who turned to Sunil Ganguly and Sakti Chattopadhyay for literary 

solace, to Ray, Ghatak and Mrinal Sen for life-mirrors on the screen, to Ajitesh 

and Nandikar for his emotional catharsis on stage and for his voice in music to?.ah, 

it was here that he ran into a dead-end. 

There was no one to turn to. Sure he appreciated Nazrulgeeti 

and cherished Rabindrasangeet and the rich tradition of adhunik gaan; they 

were lyrical in form and rich in content. They had his ear; but they were not 

his voice. There was something missing; something more that he wanted to express. 

Country, jazz, rock ?n? roll, the Rolling Stones and the experiments of Salil 

Chowdhury had touched him; he was now more global in his thinking, more universal 

in his music. 

The first middle-class, informed, caring Bengali, 

who found this voice was Gautam Chattopadhyay. He named his band Mohiner Ghoraguli, 

the title of a surrealistic Jibanananda Das poem. In 1970, their first song was 

released by HMV ? it was called Aaw Ou Baw and told the story of a UFO. 

Unfortunately, Gautam was some 20 years before his time, and was branded ?experimental? 

and even ?weird?. He was once ?thrown out? of a musical soiree for not pertaining 

to norms and being ?anti-cultural?.

Sadly, Gautam isn?t around to hear the 500-plus Bangla 

bands and scores of solo singers singing their song, but there?s no getting away 

from it: today, some 30 years on, his spirit is not just the inspiration ? it 

is the norm! As Parash Pathar points out in their latest album, Dekha, 

this isn?t ?alternative? music any more, it?s ?mainstream? all the way. 

I?m convinced that this has happened because most 

of today?s music makers in Bengal are ordinary people who have lived ordinary 

lives in middle-class paras, doing ordinary things like flying kites and 

playing cricket on the streets, sipping ordinary cups of tea in college canteens, 

rubbing shoulders with even less ordinary people in crowded buses. They are educated, 

intelligent and passionate; and, perhaps, what?s most important ? they believe 

in themselves. Which is why super successes like Srikanta Acharya and Shilajit 

gave up their sales jobs in North Bengal; Bhoomi?s Soumitra called it quits from 

his family business; and the new lyric prince from Barasat, Kingshuk Chattopadhyay, 

turned his back on a promising academic career ? all to get into their music careers 

fulltime. These are guys who could ? and still have ? other career options. 

My ?Bangali Kenny Rogers?, Indranil Sen, was an engineer 

on the ground with Indian Airlines, while Fossils? lead singer Rupam is a teacher 

at Taki Govt. Boys? School; Sidhu, Cactus ? lead vocalist, is a qualified doctor, 

while Bubla of Kalpurush has an MBA degree; Chandrabindoo?s champs are going great 

guns off-stage too ? Upal is a super cartoonist and computer geek, Chandril is 

a journalist whose pen speaks volumes, Anindya is a TV host-cum-production boss 

and keyboardist Dron is 107.8 Power FM ?s studio techie; Shamik, Agantuk?s lead 

singer, now going solo, is 106.2 Aamar FM ?s programming executive.

In fact, it is this radio station that is changing 

their lives forever, by taking their music into sleepy little towns and far-flung 

villages. It?s time to let them into your drawing rooms too ? some of their stuff 

is cosy enough for even the bedroom! In the past, my converts have had two things 

in common ? they almost never listened to Bangla music, but were music freaks 

all the same. They include: Anirban Nag, a chartered accountant friend of mine 

who swore by Queen and Clapton ? he now listens to Bangla bands non-stop in his 

car; my brother, Andy ? he now listens to Anjan Dutt as he sips a beer at his 

home in Perth every Sunday; a schoolteacher of mine, Ronnie Fernandes ? he listens 

to many a Bangla song with a calypso beat on the beaches of Goa, where he leads 

a relaxed retired life. 

All they are saying now is Tomakey Chai, but 

Tomar Dekha Nai re. So, I strongly suggest that you too let the roddur 

sink in your barandah, you will definitely hear them strumming their Purono 

Guitar and inviting you with: bondhu tomay ey gaan shonabo bikel-byalay!

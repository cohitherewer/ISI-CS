 Staying alive...

 From the dancing youth idol in Grease to the oh-so-cool Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction to the goodie-baddie in Face Off, John Travolta has ruled the screen with roles vibrant and varied. And now the superstar returns as fire chief Mike Kennedy in this Friday?s big release Ladder 49. Taking a hard look at the hazardous and heroic work of firefighters, the film also stars The Village star Joaquin Phoenix.

 Travolta, who has often played larger-than-life characters on the big screen, didn?t think twice about taking up the role of firefighter. And he explains just why: ?These guys are some of the people I admire most in life? How much more of a hero could you be? And what I love about them is that they are not interested in attention. We don?t think about them normally. Then suddenly something like September 11 happens and we all see them, but they don?t even need us to pay attention. They are just doing their job. And there?s something heartbreaking about the person who deserves a lot of recognition, but does not want it.?

 The 9/11 tragedy did play a part in Travolta?s decision to do this film. ?It did shine a light of respect and gave us all a different view of that amazing group of people. I saw this film as my opportunity to pay homage to these guys. I was only interested in the right script that I felt was fair to them and portrayed them in a realistic way,? he says.

 Ladder 49 sees Travolta in more of a supporting role to the main protagonist played by Phoenix. ?It was fun, but it was still the same amount of responsibility. It?s no less pressure, because in a movie you are always under pressure to do a good job. I enjoyed supporting Joaquin. He is a very powerful actor. You know, I am the only actor whom Joaquin has ever asked for an autograph. He was nine years old and I was shooting Urban Cowboy. I signed an autograph and he ran off!? laughs Travolta.

 A devoted family man, Travolta is married to actress Kelly Preston and they have two children, 12-year-old Jett and four-year-old Ella Blue. And the actor feels it is the children who keep their marriage going. ?Honestly, Kelly and I try our best to take care of our kids and that is most important. We try to keep them happy and give them security and love and equilibrium.?

 Travolta?s next film is A Love Song for Bobby Long and he will also be seen reprising his role as Chili Palmer opposite Uma Thurman in Be Cool, the sequel to the hit comedy Get Shorty.

 ?I always do good movies because nobody can predict success. If you try to do that, you?re going to live a roller-coaster life. You can only do your best work. I want to continue acting, to touch people?s hearts and help others as much as I can,? Travolta signs off.

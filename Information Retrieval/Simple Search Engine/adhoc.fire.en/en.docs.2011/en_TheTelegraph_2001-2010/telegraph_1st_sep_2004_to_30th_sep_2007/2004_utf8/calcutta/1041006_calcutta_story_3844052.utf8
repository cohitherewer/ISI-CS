The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Versatile wrap for casual class

Draping a scarf is the easiest way to add 

a chic touch to your outfit, finds Ipsita Deb. Here are just a few of the 

tricks you need to know about where to buy and how to tie the whispy accessory

Wear it around your neck, drape it around your shoulders or go for the rocker look and tie it on your head. A scarf is a truly dynamic accessory with ethnic and western roots, depending on the style and use you put it to.

 With the cooler months approaching, this is the right time to stock up on your selection of scarves. While the silk, chiffon or georgette variety can be worn year round, on Calcutta?s muggy evenings, less frill usually means more ease. Get ready for the nip in the night air with some elegant wraps.

 The choice is huge as there are readily available scarves in many a size ? small to giant; shapes, too ? square, oblong or rectangular; and finally, for any use ? as headgear, neck wear and wrap.

Of the host of stores and boutiques that possess these 

much-coveted style accessories, here are some of the best, all at Elgin Road?s 

Forum mall.

Ritu Kumar

 She has draped her clothes on many beauty queens (and most likely a few real queens, too) and janta alike. Ritu Kumar?s premier signature label has an array of scarves. Made in a factory in Beleghata, they are rooted in traditional Indian textiles. Her trademark floral and paisley motifs have been screen-printed on light crepe, chignon and georgette fabrics, using subtle colours. All items in this scarf collection have employed traditional skills, drawing on the heritage of Indian handicrafts. Beautifully packaged in black and gold, they make excellent gifts for loved ones in India or even abroad. What?s more, they are priced at a modest Rs 635.

Satya Paul

 The Satya Paul brand is pushing its concept of wearable philosophy and power art. Limited edition silk scarves based on the paintings of artist Sayed Haider Raza, priced between Rs 8,000 and Rs 12,000 (depending on size), can be purchased here. The scarves reproduce on fine silk Raza?s works Germination I, Germination II, Bindu and Amarjeev. 

 For those who may feel the pinch of the price tag with this high-end range, the store also keeps a large variety of other scarves in bright colours, floral prints, polka dots and modern designs priced at a much more reasonable Rs 895.

Be:

 Sheer and colourful, airy and light, the multi-brand chain?s in-house scarves provide variety in modernity. The use of crushed fabrics and tie and dye are its trademark. Priced at Rs 795, they come in colourful prints on georgette with embellishments in the form of sequins and beaded tassels. 

 ?Scarves always add to our sales as people like to mix and match their attire with the help of a suitable accessory,? says fashion counsellor Pallavi Grover. Other interesting add-ons include long stoles made of jersey in shades of grey and priced at Rs 495. A collection of scarves from Goan designer Savio John is also retailed here.

 Anokhi

Block prints rule at this international chain, and 

there is a delightful range of wraps here ? dupattas to more slender stoles. 

A classy dupatta can double as a scarf with your denims. Shorter scarves 

are available in cotton, in various floral patterns with the ethnic touch, at 

a very economical price tag of Rs 190. Chiffon scarves are, of course, priced 

higher, at Rs 390. These could be teamed with kurtis or tops for that extra 

oomph.

Bizarre

 The order of the day here is to suffice the needs of the modern girl or woman. Starting at Rs 125 and going up to Rs 1,200, the range of designs is rather diverse. 

 A selection of single-coloured georgette scarves can go with almost any outfit during the day or in the evening. The linen and chiffon scarves come with pretty floral embroidery and delicate sequin work. 

 The crochet-knit scarves offer both style and provide warmth. ?The sales for scarves here are quite high and the rage seems to be for sequins of all kinds at the moment,? says sales executive Ritu Kapoor.

 So now that you have roamed the shops and bought your desired scarf, how can you wear it? Apart from draping it around your neck or tying it into interesting shapes and knots, you can also use a scarf to cleverly conceal a growing bald patch.

 The most common example is the back-tied wrap. Fold a square scarf into a triangle. Pull the straight edge of the scarf over the forehead, then knot the pointed ends on the sides at the back. Or the more complex rosette turban, in which you need an oblong scarf and some deft flicks of the wrist to get the desired effect.

 And luckily, around these parts, sporting headscarves is still acceptable. But with the recent controversy in Europe, you might want to watch it on your travels.

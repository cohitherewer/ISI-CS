The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

Gearing up to greet Santa

Santa is coming a calling soon and there is work to be done. Forget about being 

on your best behaviour, just stock up on cakes and ale and rest assured, the Christmas 

goodies will follow. Practise those carols to woo the traveller from the North 

Pole and he?ll knock on your door before everyone else?s.

Getting a GPRS enabled set

Get yourself a hi-tech phone or be left behind in the dark ages of text messaging. 

Daddy may not be too keen to pay up at the moment, considering what some geeks 

have been up to in other parts of the country, but facilities like picture transfer 

to your PC and direct email to friends are just too cool to miss!

Bidding for Diana?s letters on eBay

If you are game for more steam after the Bebo bust, bid for Prince Charles? and 

Princess Diana?s private letters to the family of their former butler, Paul Burrell. 

They are up for grabs on the auction website eBay, though after the Baazee debacle, 

beware! The letters are supposed to have been written in 1995 after the death 

of Paul?s mum Beryl. Paul?s father put up the letters for sale as he ?didn?t want 

them hanging around the house anymore?.

 Planning a no-smoking trip

If you are an asthma patient or have just had a lung-full of Calcutta?s poison 

air, it?s time for a trip to Bhutan. Even if it maybe a little too cold for comfort, 

the ban on smoking in public places and tobacco sales makes the Himlayan kingdom 

a good place to get your chain-smoking partner to kick the habit.

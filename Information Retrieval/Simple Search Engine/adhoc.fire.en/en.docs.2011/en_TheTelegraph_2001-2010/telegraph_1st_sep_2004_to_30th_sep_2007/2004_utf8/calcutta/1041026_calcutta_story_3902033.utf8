Create a cosy cubicle

Decorating your surroundings can inject some energy 

into your workplace, finds Ipsita Deb

This year, we have the dubious pleasure of celebrating 

the 40th anniversary of the cubicle. In 1964, designer Bob Propst decided to engineer 

something to break up the sprawling, open-air offices of the day. Propst?s invention 

was intended to reduce the anonymity of the workplace. 

?We tried to create a low-key, unselfconscious product 

that was not at all fashionable,? said Propst (The Man Behind the Cubicle, 

Metropolis magazine has quoted him as saying in 1998). But in reality, 

the cubicle has managed to do just the opposite, and has become an icon for faceless 

employees of corporations everywhere. If we take Dilbert?s word for it, office 

politics also comes with the flimsy, collapsible pieces of ply that separate worker 

from disgruntled worker.

But, at the end (and the beginning) of the day, this 

is your home away from home, the place you spend more waking hours than your actual 

house and more often than not, it is of a pale colour with the standard desktop 

computer, telephone, colour-coordinated chair (in some lucky places) and, perhaps 

a shelf, bin and some filing drawers.

If this isn?t exactly what you dreamt of during your 

college days, there is something you can do to change this rather dismal fate. 

Personalising your workspace simply could mean a touch of flavour in your cubicle 

to show off who you are and to make it cosier for you to work in.

First impressions

Making an impression is great only if it is a positive 

one. Your cubicle gives your colleagues an estimate of the kind of person you 

are. Do not use anything that would cause distraction ? either to you or your 

neighbours. Also take care not to be offensive. Respect the space of your clients, 

co-workers as you assert control over your own.

Private-public spaces

Take out some nicely-framed family pictures, distinction 

certificates and inspirational photographs. You could even put up a bulletin board 

on an inside wall to display these items. Cover the soft board with a piece of 

bright fabric first. 

ways remember that your cubicle need not be bland 

but neither should it be so bold as to stick out like a sore thumb. Make sure 

the objects are personal, not private. This will help create a sense of warmth 

and also let others know exactly what space is yours.

For example, if you are a collector, use some of your 

finds in the office. If you love baskets, use these to hold papers, instead of 

standard issue metal office furniture.

?I feel that the best way to decorate any place is 

with the use of colours. Find a colour that matches your comfort level and use 

it to spruce up your cubicle,? advises interior designer Gopa Ray. While putting 

up photographs in nice frames and some bits of exotic art work have become rather 

common, it is still the best way to get some life and energy into your little 

work zone. ?Get some foliage or greenery (a potted plant is just right) and see 

the difference it makes to the ambience. For those who have colour preferences 

that don?t grow in the green zone, go ahead and bunch some pretty, colourful flowers 

together in a vase. However, a word of caution: this may work out to be rather 

uneconomical and time-consuming in the long run,? she adds.

While making your cubicle more homely, always remember to 

use personal, not private, items that create a sense of belonging

Locale limits

When you get into the office-decor groove, you might 

want to put almost everything on display, from photographs of loved ones to funny 

calendars. However, you must be aware of your place (literally and figuratively) 

in the office. If your boss and the rest of your colleagues tend to decorate their 

space rather somberly, refrain from flashy (even if that suits your personality) 

displays of any sort. Also, if your cubicle is situated in a place where clients 

frequently pass by, being conservative is always preferred. 

Clean clutter

With workspaces shrinking, office colleagues often 

get irritated by their slob counterparts and may even insist on them cleaning 

up their act, or at least hiding it. To avoid such an embarrassment, organise 

yourself better. Extra storage space is essential in every office. 

Mobile file cabinets that can be pulled out during 

the day but rolled under the desk at night; extra desk drawers that fit beneath 

computer keyboards; and storage cabinets to supplement personal file drawers help 

ease the cramped space problem.

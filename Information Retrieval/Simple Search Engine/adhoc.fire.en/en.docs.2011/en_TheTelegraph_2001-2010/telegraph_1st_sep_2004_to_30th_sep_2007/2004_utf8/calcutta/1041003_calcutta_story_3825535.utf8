The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Business conclave?s big bite

 Clubsandwich

 The tender Bekti Sicilian, the 

 succulent prawn kebabs and fish tikkas, or for that 

 matter, the out-of-the-world Monte Carlos (a cake-pudding-ice 

 cream-fruit combo) ? fine food has been a forte at The Conclave 

 (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). And the city?s ?first 

 business club? is keen to stick to its core competence, 

 even as it embarks on a structured exercise to extend brand 

 visibility and open up new flanks outside the confines of 

 its AJC Bose Road address.

 ?It was my first out-of-the-box 

 venture in Calcutta back in 1986, when there was nothing 

 much in town outside the star hotels and the traditional 

 clubs. The city?s business people wanted to have a venue 

 where they could meet for working lunches and conferencing 

 and also a place to unwind after work. The Conclave sought 

 to answer those needs,? says Harsh Neotia, who had conceptualised 

 the rendezvous.

 Even after competition arrived 

 in the form of more star hotels and new-age eateries, the 

 chic, unhurried elegance of The Conclave has managed to 

 hold its charm, primarily by dint of its fabulous food and 

 distinctive ?British pub ambience? where business and pleasure 

 blend gracefully. Food festivals with flavours from France, 

 Italy, the Far East, Mexico, the Middle-East ? the versatile 

 kitchen has tried its hand at almost everything.

 ?Now, we are looking at leveraging 

 our strength to make The Conclave brand grow, essentially 

 through a three-pronged initiative,? says Vineet Verma, 

 director. Opening new food and beverage outlets (through 

 its subsidiary brand Dakshini to start with), outdoor catering 

 and providing expertise in club management are the avenues 

 being explored.

 Dakshini, which is well-ensconced 

 in Swabhumi and has made its debut in Nicco Park (as The 

 Caf?), is opening up at the City Centre food court as well.

 ?We plan to develop the brand 

 as a distinctive South Indian eating house and set up more 

 outlets in the city,? adds Verma. Outdoor catering, which 

 is now limited to Turf Club lunches and banqueting at Swabhumi, 

 is set to spread its wings too. Another sub-brand, The T 

 Junction, is already a popular haunt at City Centre.

 Besides offering its F amp;B and 

 management expertise to clubs housed within the premises 

 of the Ambuja group properties, The Conclave is also scanning 

 the scene for turnkey operations in club management to ?convert 

 under-achieving institutions into viable properties?. Even 

 on campus, the one-of-its-kind business club in town is 

 keen to upgrade and reinvent.

 A discreet Continental dinner 

 at The Stallion, a sumptuous Indian meal at The Village, 

 a cocktail twist at The Jazz Bar or compact meetings at 

 The Suites, the members have a spectrum of activities to 

 choose from. And to jazz up things a touch more, the management 

 hopes to add another cosy banqueting facility to The Other 

 Room soon. Members? outings and outdoor parties are also 

 on the cards.

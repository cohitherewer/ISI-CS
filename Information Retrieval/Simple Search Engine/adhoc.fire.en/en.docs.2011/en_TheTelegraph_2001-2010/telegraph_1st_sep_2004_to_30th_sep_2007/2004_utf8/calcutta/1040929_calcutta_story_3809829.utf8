 Bud bouquet for bright future

Feng Shui Matters

Pinky Kapoor

Q: I am a first-year student of an 

engineering diploma course. My study-cum-living room is on the second floor of 

the house, in the north-west. The door is in the east, near the south wall. There 

are three windows ? in the north, west and south. How can I make my room better 

for my studies? My date of birth is 19.06.85.

RPB, Howrah

The Solution: Divide the room into nine equal 

parts and then decorate or energise it. Place your study table in the north-east. 

A lamp here will keep your vision clear and steer you towards your goal. The eastern 

wall can have a picture of buds, symbolic of a promising future, rather than flowers. 

The south-east can be enhanced in the same way. 

 The north can have a picture of a successful person in the engineering field who could be your role model. The south can have a picture of a sun glowing at a summit to help you reach such heights. The west and north-west can have a display of your achievements, like trophies and shields. The south-west that helps to stabilise must have a picture of a mountain.

Q: My date of birth is 11.12.89. 

I can?t focus on my studies and would like to energise my surroundings. Where 

should my study table be placed and in which direction should I sleep? What is 

my lucky number, element, colour and animal sign?

The Solution: Your pillars of destiny reveal 

that you are an intelligent person with three elements of fire. As you are a weak 

wood person, intelligent elements in excess make you think of multiple things 

at the same time and hamper your concentration. To keep a check on this, wear 

blue and sit on a blue upholstered chair. Study facing the north or the south-east 

and place a blue soft board in front of you. Your head pointing to the south would 

be best for sleep. Your lucky number is 4 and your animal sign is snake. 

 Among the five elements, only plants have life. 

So they absorb negativity, avoid any kind of stagnation and stimulate the healthy 

chi energy. They act as powerful energisers for finances when placed in the south-east

Q: I will sit for the CAT this year 

and would want to get into a business school. Luck has not favoured me for the 

past few years in my career moves. Please help me improve my prospects. My date 

of birth is 10.05.83.

Debashish Sharma Paikpara

The Solution: You should sit in the south-west 

and study facing the north-east. Keep the admission forms of business schools 

in a white or a blue folder and fill them up on an auspicious day facing the north-east. 

As you have fire elements in excess in your chart, try to make yourself comfortable 

in an environment that is suggestive of cool and calm shades of blue. To absorb 

bad luck related to education, keep a metal bowl filled with salt dissolved in 

water in the north-east of your study table. Change the salt water every day. 

Q: We live in a flat where the front 

door faces the south. When we moved in, the flat opposite was empty and we were 

doing fine. We have a copper figure of a woman with hands folded in a gesture 

of welcome outside our door. Then our neighbours moved in and put a similar figure 

on their door, only twice the size. 

They have also grown plants in the same arrangement 

as ours outside the flat. They are very competitive and this is leading to tension. 

This year, my daughter had to be hospitalised and we are going through a bad financial 

phase. How can I change the environment? My date of birth is 28.07.49 and my daughter?s 

is 24.04.77.

The Solution: Do not panic about your neighbour 

placing a symbol that is double the size of yours. It is all in the mind and nobody 

can harm us if we are mentally strong. Still, if you want, try placing a small 

bowl filled with dry salt hidden behind a plant at your entrance. It will absorb 

any kind of negativity and will not be harmful for the neighbours as well. 

 Try growing some bamboo plants in the east and south-east of the house. Among the five elements, only plants have life. So they absorb negativity, avoid any kind of stagnation and stimulate the healthy chi energy. 

 They act as powerful energisers for finances when placed in the south-east. Ensure that nothing metallic is kept here.

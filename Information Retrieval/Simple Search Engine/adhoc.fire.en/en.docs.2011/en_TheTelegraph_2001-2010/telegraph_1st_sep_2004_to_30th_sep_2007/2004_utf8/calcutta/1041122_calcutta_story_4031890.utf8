Pradip Pal: I am using the prepaid telephone service of a reputed private cellular service provider. Whenever I ask them for details of my billing, they say they do not have any provision to divulge such information. At times I feel that I have been overcharged. 

 As you are paying for the service, you definitely have the right to know about the charges. We had received such complaints earlier and had taken up the issue with a government cellular service provider. Now, they show the balance on the phone screen immediately after you finish making a call while using prepaid service. We had also received a lot complaints against providers of the wireless-in-local-loop service. We are inquiring into the matter. 

 Let me clarify that be it a prepaid or postpaid service, one is entitled to know, under the Consumer Protection Act, for what he has been charged. Moreover, if the service provider delays in sending you a particular bill, and you lose the rebate, you can take up the matter with us. We will treat such complaints as negligence in providing a service.

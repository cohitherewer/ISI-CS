Films, 

food and a whole lot of cola and coffee. What more do you need in the run-up to 

the Pujas?

 Just to make sure that you have all of that, and that too in loads, The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry and West Bengal Tourism, in association with The Telegraph, Coca Cola and INOX, have unveiled a special privilege card under the aegis of Kolkata Shopping Festival (KSF).

 Launching the card at INOX, Forum, on Sunday afternoon was star couple Bikram Ghosh and Jaya Seal.

 Applauding the concept, the percussionist-actor said: ?Shopping these days is not just about buying things; it?s an experience. With this KSF card, the experience has just got more exciting.?

 Actress Jaya was all smiles after receiving her exclusive privilege card. ?I think it?s a very nice idea and we are definitely going to make best use of this,? she promised.

 Offering a range of discounts and freebies at restaurants, nightspots and multiplexes, the card is a steal at Rs 60, with the goodies to be grabbed adding up to Rs 2,000 and more.

 Valid till October 19 (Sashthi), the card offers everything from free movie tickets at INOX City Centre to free desserts at Red Hot Chilli Pepper, Fusion, Bar-B-Q, Red Kitchen and Lounge, Flavours of China, to special discounts at Pepper Chino, Don Giovanni?s and China Bistro.

 One can round off a shopping spree with steaming cups of Georgia Coffee and ice-cold glasses of Coca Cola, absolutely free, armed with the KSF card.

 The red card also provides a chance to participate in a lucky draw, where among other prizes like gift vouchers from Pantaloons, electronic gadgets from Samsung and air tickets from Sahara, there is the bumper hope of driving home a Chevrolet Tavera.

 There?s also food for thought with the KSF card ? Rs 40 off on an annual subscription of TTIS and cash discounts on classified advertisements in both The Telegraph and Anandabazar Patrika.

 Foam fun

 If the rain romp last week left you wanting more, the high-voltage Bubble and Foam Party at Tantra on Saturday night must have been for you.

 The word of wet fun spread like forest fire as the night-club witnessed a riot of party hoppers jostling and shoving their way into the den.

 Revelry turned into rivalry when two hunks locked horns over a particular damsel hardly in distress, but for once the rules were relaxed and Saturday night best went casually chic with floaters, three-quarters, short skirts and all.

 If outside was madness, inside was mayhem. The Park Street dance floor didn?t have a foothold free and the bar boys failed to keep pace with the flow of things.

 Bollywood tracks ruled as the table turner twirled out tracks like Kaho na kaho and Chhod do aanchal.

 Just after midnight, the alarm was sounded and the water babies were all ordered off the dance floor for the bubble blitz to begin. Three outlets, connected to a foam-making machine (with the help of water and ?a harmless? bio chemical), were thrown open, submerging the entire ground floor area in five feet of foam.

 Some decided to give the fun and froth a slip and nurse their drinks at the Bodhi Bar, instead. ?It is unthinkable for me to go to the dancing area tonight,? said Roma Jalan, enjoying a bird?s-eye view of the foam and frolic.

 But many just kept gyrating to tracks like Hey sexy lady and Mundion to bach ke rahin, soaking in all the foam fun.

 Towel trail

 ?I bet most of you have been conceived on a Bombay Dyeing sheet,? cooed Maureen Wadia, espousing the power spread of the brand to city models in sensuous drapes of bed sheets and towels at the Russel Street store.

 Organised to mark the 125th anniversary of Bombay Dyeing, the event saw the unveiling of new collections of bed linen, bath towels, cushion covers, curtains, towels and quilts ahead of the festive season.

 The girls clad in sheets and linen draped as sarongs and gowns played traffic stoppers as they stepped on the sidewalk right outside the shop in a little ramp romp, while the guys earned their fair share of drape drool, looking fresh out of the bath in towels.

 In case you missed the show, the minimalism will see a repeat at most Bombay Dyeing showrooms in other metros as well. 

 If you are looking beyond eye candy though, there are 200 new designs in the bed sheet section, noteworthy among which is the Facets collection featuring a whole lot of flora.

 Marrying beauty with utility, the Rs 1,000-cr textile major has also come up with corporate gift packs. Available in five sets of towels, bed sheets and even mats and napkins, the neat packaging and sophisticated designs are being pitched at the woman of the house.

 ?She has the maximum say in the purchase decisions concerning this area, if not most other products governing the day-to-day life of the family,? signed off the Gladrags Maureen as the last of the models swished by.

 Model run

 The clamour of party people in Big Ben to catch a glimpse of model Aanchal Kumar turned out to be more fizzle than fizz.

 Hordes jostling for leg-and-look space (over shoulders, under arms?) to steal a glance at a model might not be the coolest way to spend a Saturday evening, but Calcutta sure didn?t seem to mind being in the chaos corridor.

 Aanchal Kumar, along with models from the city (most of whom need a crash course in catwalk, and fast), took to the small dance floor that doubled as ramp.

 othes designed by Sunetra were showcased by the six female models who flaunted skirts and salwar kurtas, saris and western formals. The georgette saris and bright salwar suits with thread and zari embroidery on them didn?t have enough steam to make a mark, but the designer successfully paired the saris with interesting cholis ranging from the sexy backless to the stylish jacket.

 The printed flowing skirts with off-shoulder uppers in bold colours seemed good enough to wear to a casual cocktail. The Western formals with skirts in heavy fabric and straight, smart cuts seemed to be the pick of the entire collection, now available at Saaj boutique on Mirza Ghalib Street. 

 The six sequences that began on the dance floor and went around the bar for the convenience of the backbenchers sure stopped the dance crowd in its tracks. But DJ Douglas with his all-Hindi music platter ensured that the crowds were back on the floor as soon as the models were gone.

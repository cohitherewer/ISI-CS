 Bard amp; beautiful: tours de force

 William Shakespeare?s borrowed plots have been borrowed, in turn, by filmmakers for decades now. With The Merchant of Venice finally hitting the big screen, and with Al Pacino reportedly authoring a superbly restrained Shylock, the maestro is back in the headlines. And as always, talk of his continued relevance is on the tip of everybody?s tongues.

 Perhaps because of the plot?s culturally-sensitive content, Hollywood had stayed away from one of Shakespeare?s greatest works. Even now, the anti-Semitic sentiments expressed by some of the characters in The Merchant of Venice are treated with great caution. But at least English director Michael Radford finally dared to bring the play to celluloid life. So far, Sir Laurence Olivier?s portrayal of the embittered moneylender was taken as the benchmark. But that wasn?t made for the big screen; after its resounding reception on stage, the cast enacted it for TV cameras.

 Pacino?s love for the Bard is enduring. In 1996, he directed and starred in Looking for Richard, a film about Richard III. While his performance was received with mixed reviews (for his gruff voice and New York accent), his involvement with Shakespeare?s work runs deep.

 In the past 10 years, the industry has seen some Shakespeare screen adaptations click, others miss the mark, some stick to the play verse for verse, others reconstruct them at will.

 The year 1996 was also when Baz Luhrman?s Romeo + Juliet hit the screen. While it could not have looked more different from what readers of the tragic love drama expect ? set in modern California, with gangs and shootouts and swimming pools and guns ? the film sticks to the original text. Once you get past the sight shock, the result is a strangely rivetting film of passion and pace, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.

 Kenneth Branagh 

The gorgeous Kenneth Branagh is known largely for his adaptations of Shakespeare?s plays ? some less impressive than others. Much Ado About Nothing, which he scripted, directed and starred in, could have done without mediocre performances from Keanu Reeves and Denzel Washington. He played Iago in Othello (1995), also starring Laurence Fishburne. Another Shakespearean production in the form of Hamlet, directed by Branagh, who also played the Prince of Denmark, with Kate Winslet (Ophelia), Sir Richard Attenborough and Billy Crystal hit the screen in 1996.

 Three years later, a disturbing coincidence was a reminder of the Elizabethan playwright?s continued relevance. A retelling of Othello, set in an American high school was made, by the name of O. Starring Josh Hartnett and Julia Stiles, the film was slated for release till the Columbine school shooting took place. It was held back till 2001, as it was felt hitting audiences with the tale of murdering and conniving students would have been insensitive.

 In 2000, Hamlet was transported to New York, played by Ethan Hawke. His father is not the king, but CEO of Denmark Corp, in this film also featuring Bill Murray, Casey Affleck and, once again, Julia Stiles.

 Not to forget the light-hearted Shakespeare. A Midsummer Night?s Dream tried to capture this mood in 1999. The Michael Hoffman film has an interesting line-up of Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Calista Flockhart and Sophie Marceau. It is a good attempt at capturing the whimsical comedy, with stunning sets and costumes.

 Creditably, Bollywood also ventured into dangerous territory with critical success. Last year, Vishal Bharadwaj?s Maqbool was inspired by Macbeth, with Irrfan, Tabu and a show-stealing performance from Pankaj Kapoor.

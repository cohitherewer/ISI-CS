The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 L-Zone: Furniturewalla 

ZEESHAN JAWED

Deck it up

 l around the country, there has been an explosion in the upmarket furniture industry. Branded furniture is fast taking over the traditional role of the carpenter. The latest in the city?s share is Furniturewalla, a Mumbai-based furniture chain, which opened a 9,000-sq-ft showroom to capture the connoisseurs.

 ?Furniturewalla is the first furniture brand in India. The Calcutta showroom has been set up after much planning and market study. The surveys suggest a boom in the city market,? says Farhan Furniturewalla. The Mumbai-based man intends to add another 9,000 sq-ft of floor space in a couple of months.

New meets old

There are two distinct lines of products at the store 

at 6, Hungerford Street. The buyers have a choice between the classical range 

and contemporary class (pictures by Rashbehari Das). 

 The classical line is styled on colonial lines. Whether it is the deco cabinets or the centre tables, dressers or dining tables, the raw material used is solid wood with lots of curves and designs as embellishment. The contemporary range on the other hand is sleek, bright and more affordable. 

 Most of the pieces in the contemporary range have been manufactured at the Mumbai Furniturewalla factory.

 Price pinch

 The products stand out in terms of design, finishing and class. But the price tag also reflects this. The solid wood deco cabinets range between Rs 26,500 and Rs 39,250. Bedroom sets including a double bed, two side tables, wardrobe, dresser and mirror can range between Rs 145,000 and Rs 200,000. 

 Dining tables in both the classical and contemporary collections cost anywhere between Rs 70,000 and Rs 126,000. The six-seater table can easily be converted into an eight-seater if you are expecting guests. If space is a problem, choose the folding dining table instead, which comes for Rs 44,500. The sea shell chairs are an additional Rs 18,500.

Cosy quotient

 The USP of the furniture chain is ?the comfort level of its products?, says the owner. ?A sofa is meant to be sat on. If you make a classical piece ignoring the right measurements, you will find very few takers for your product. This holds true for dining tables, wardrobes and dressers also. The height and the width should be according to the physical stature of an average Indian,? adds Farhan. 

 The first showroom in Mumbai ?was a learning experience?, an ideal place to learn just what sells and what doesn?t before taking the production plunge. Here, the customer is not left to select the furniture from a catalogue. The ?furniture mall? provides a touch-and-feel experience that has been common for all branded products.

Reach out

 Farhan is looking at making the Furniturewalla presence felt internationally, but the first priority is to expand nationally. The chain is looking at 100 locations in India within the next five years, depending on logistical constraints.

 ?We will set up at least 25 company-owned showrooms after which we will consider taking on franchisees,? he says.

Style wrap in winter wows

From heavily-embroidered traditional pieces 

to casual ones in solid colours stores around town offer various options 

in shawls this season, discovers Zeeshan Jawed

Now that the chill in the Calcutta air is finally 

being felt, it?s time you flaunted your winter wardrobe to full effect. After 

all, it?s only a few days in the year you get to do so and before you can say 

?winter?s tale?, it?ll be time again to shove the woollens back into the cupboard.

While the pullovers and jackets do make the desired 

impact on formal occasions, it?s the universal shawl that comes handy, anytime 

and anywhere.

Women can pair it with anything from saris and salwars 

to jeans. The men can team it up in style with ethnic wear for any occasion.

The two-and-a-half-metre drape not only takes care 

of the fashion factor, it?s also just right for the polite Calcutta winter. 

Till a few years back, the Kashmiri shawlwallahs 

who used to drop in with their bundle of warm clothes were the only window of 

winter opportunity. But things have changed, and how. This year, stores around 

town have stocked up a huge collection.

The trend in shawl shopping this season shows a tilt 

towards non-woollen varieties, with silk and tussar emerging favourites 

for occasion wear.

?In Calcutta, one doesn?t require heavy woollen shawls. 

The silk and tussar versions are good enough to keep people warm and they 

are fashionable, too,? says Raju Dugar, proprietor of Gatha, in Forum. 

Casual chic

Drop the teeny-bopper look and display class this 

winter. Unisex wraps in solid colours can be teamed with any attire, you just 

have to match the shade with your outfit. While this is the most common variety 

to hunt down, for some quality stuff you can drop in at Fabindia.

The shawls at the Hindustan Road outlet are sourced 

from co-operatives in Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal. Pure wool dominates, with 

limited lines in silk and tussar. The colours on offer are bronze, grey, 

black, maroon and off-white, and the shawls are mostly reversible.

?The focus here is on the textures; you won?t find 

any prints or embroidery. These are very light and just right for Calcutta winters,? 

says Pallabi Basu of Fabindia. Some of the varieties available here are Chomoli, 

Himachali, Kungao and Chashm-e-bulbul, named after the kinds 

of weaves.

Ethnic elegance

If you are gearing up to attend a close friend or 

relative?s wedding, do shop for some traditional drapes. While Pashmina is the 

ultimate luxury in this range, these days there are many other options available 

in terms of fabrics.

Twill, jamevar, brocade, pure silk, blends 

of silk and wool and silk and linen look gorgeous and are ideal for special occasions. 

The heavily-embroidered ones, with traditional Kashmiri motifs and paisleys, are 

the classics in this segment. 

Gatha outlets in Forum and City Centre are good stops 

for ethnic shawls. ?We specialise in shawls for occasional wear, at weddings and 

other special functions. And we even co-ordinate these with the sherwanis,? 

says Dugar, of Gatha. The price tag ranges between Rs 1,200 and Rs 20,000.

Men?s wear store Orly has a premium range of Pashmina 

shawls, priced between Rs 8,000 and Rs 15,000. The other line available here is 

one with a silk and wool blend which comes in vibrant colours. The price range 

for that is around Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000.

Wool worth

If it?s the real thing you want, go for Angora wool 

shawls available in stores across the city. These come with embroidery and prints 

and the range is really wide.

Orly has a range of Angora wool shawls with vegetable 

dyes in colours blue, brown, maroon and black. The prices start from Rs 1,000.

Fashion factor

For those unfazed by the chill factor, a shawl might 

be too hot to handle. But if you want to flaunt one to up the style quotient, 

sporting a stole would not be a bad idea.

?Stoles are moving the fastest in our store this season. 

These don?t serve the purpose of keeping you warm, but are very fashionable. We 

have a line of embroidered stoles that are very dressy,? says Avinash Jain of 

Orly.

These come mostly in silks and chiffon. At Gatha, 

stoles for men are available in different textures like tanchoi, tissue 

and pure silk. Bandhni and leheriya are the common prints for these. 

The stoles are priced at Rs 500 onwards.

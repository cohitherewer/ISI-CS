 100 years on Shiva?s lap

Je hatey puji ami Sankar-Bhabani,

Shey hatey pujibo ki chyang murakani? 

 Famous words deriding goddess Manasa by Chand Saudagar, the sea-merchant, immortalised in Manasamangal. Chand Saudagar, in the 14th century text, belonged to the kulin Gandhabanik community, of Durba rishi gotra. 

 His descendants in the community are taking the tradition of worshipping Sankar-Bhabani, or Shiva-Durga, forward. For 100 years now, the Duttas of Beadon Street invoke a Durga who sits on the left lap of Shiva. There is neither the warring Mahishasura nor the rampant lion. 

 ?This form of the Mother Goddess was dreamt of by our predecessor Dhanapati Saudagar. She is a seven-year-old girl going to her in-laws? place with her husband after marriage, riding a bull,? says Samar Dutta, leafing through the pages at one of the three Beadon Street mansions that the Duttas call their home. 

 In the ebb and flow of fortunes, the puja that Dhanapati Saudagar started was discontinued. It was revived centuries later by Bholanath Dutta in 1905 in Varanasi. His four sons shifted it to their Sovabazar address in 1914. ?The puja is being held at Beadon Street since 1925,? Dutta informs. 

 The present address has had illustrious visitors. The cousins recall Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as well as Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, the family lawyer. Another frequent visitor was Dadathakur Sarat Pandit. ?He helped our grandfather set up his business,? smiles Ajoy Dutta, in whose house the puja is held. 

 The wooden frame that supports the ekchala idol (kathamo) has remained the same since inception, the Duttas claim. ?We do not immerse the structure. Instead, these ropes tying the clay structures to the frame are cut, to free the idols for immersion,? Samar Dutta points at the back of the goddess, nearing completion in the courtyard. 

 Every day about 40 types of water are used for the bathing of the goddess. ?Since the water from the first shower of Shravana is needed, our aunts keep an eye out when the month starts. They rush to the terrace with an utensil as soon as rain starts,? Dutta laughs. 

 Turning 100 is a special occasion. So all the three families of Bholanath Dutta?s sons have come together to make this a ritual to remember. Contrary to custom, formal invitations are being sent out to distant relatives. ?We are expecting 500 visitors every day,? says Alok Dutta.

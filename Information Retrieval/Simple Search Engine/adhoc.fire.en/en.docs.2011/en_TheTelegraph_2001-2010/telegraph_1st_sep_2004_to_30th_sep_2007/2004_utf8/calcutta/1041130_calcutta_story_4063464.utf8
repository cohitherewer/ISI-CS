 Nurturing creative consciousness

 To generate a collective aesthetic consciousness in society has always been the aim of artists. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by the members of Utsa, a society formed by a group of young artists, is a positive step in this direction. Apart from providing a platform for sharing and exchanging ideas and techniques while promoting creative cooperation among the art community, the exhibition also serves as a medium to reach out to all who relate and respond to the world of art. Feedback obtained from the show will be analysed and evaluated to help redefine the locus of art in contemporary life and society. Featuring works by Antara Basak (one of whose paintings appears above), Sanjeev Verma, Jaspal Singh, Somnath Chakraborty, Gautam Sengupta and Dipali Saha, among others, the show brings together an assortment of art in diverse media including acrylic, watercolour, oil on canvas, mixed media, terracotta and etching.

 When: Till December 3, 11am - 8 pm

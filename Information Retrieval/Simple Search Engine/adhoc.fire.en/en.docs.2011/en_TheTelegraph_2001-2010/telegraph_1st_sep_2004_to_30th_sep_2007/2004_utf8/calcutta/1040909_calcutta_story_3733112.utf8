 Fire safety code for school inspectors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Officers working as inspectors of primary and secondary schools in Calcutta now have a new job ? examining the fire safety measures of the schools.

 The school education and the fire services departments will organise their first-ever workshop at the Behala Fire Training School on Thursday to teach school inspectors the basic safety measures that each and every school, particularly Montessoris and nurseries, should have. 

 The government decided to train school inspectors after the recent tragedy in which more then 90 children were killed in a fire at a school in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu. 

 Thereafter, the government decided to ensure that each and every primary, secondary and Higher Secondary school in Calcutta as well as in the districts should maintain certain fire safety measures.

 ?The concept of maintaining fire safety provisions is completely new and comes in the wake of the Kumbakonam tragedy,? Kanti Biswas, school education minister said.

 Training the inspectors in fire safety measures is necessary because they regularly check the infrastructure and other norms that schools are supposed to maintain, an education department official said.

 In Thursday?s workshop, a group of officers in charge of looking after nearly 1,000 primary schools and over 600 secondary and Higher Secondary schools in the city will be offered the training. 

 They will also be taught how to evacuate students if there is a fire in any school. 

 These officers will go to the schools under their respective zones and train the teachers. 

 ?The schools of Calcutta, especially the Montessoris and nurseries, are our primary concern, because many of these are housed on extremely small premises, and have very narrow exits,? explained the official.

 The government is also considering devising a means of preparing a list of Montessori and nursery schools in Calcutta. The government has no record of them, as in the existing system, state permission is not required for opening a nursery school. 

 ?The fire services department has already started a drive in the city to locate Montessori and nursery schools. We are trying to take the help of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for the purpose,? the official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Runs, rupees and risks

 Team India must do well for the great 

 gamble over telecast rights to pay off

 SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

 First things must be said first. 

 Last week, I wrote: ?Three Roses is a story of the Seventies. 

 The then Calcutta giant Lipton launched it from its Weston 

 Street headquarters.? It was a Himalayan blunder. It was 

 like saying Alex Ferguson coaches Arsenal. Or Saddam Hussein 

 is the American President. 

 Three Roses was a brand launched 

 by Brooke Bond of Theatre Road ? the then arch-rival of 

 Lipton of Weston Street. The fact that both are now in Levers 

 stable or the arguments that the mistake did not alter the 

 logic of last week?s AdLib are inadequate consolations. 

 My sincere apologies. And I am indebted to those who pointed 

 out the mistake.

 This week, I wish to share an 

 anxiety. It is now common knowledge that the right to telecast 

 matches played by Team India in India was auctioned. Highest 

 bid reportedly was $ 308 million. That is a little over 

 Rs 30 crore in US currency and at roughly Rs 50 a dollar 

 converts to Rs 1,500 crore. Yes, Rs 1,500 crore for four 

 years or Rs 375 crore a year.

 The subsequent legal wrangle is 

 immaterial to the anxiety that I wish to share. Neither 

 of the two channels, to the best of my knowledge, is not-for-profit 

 units. That would imply that both are confident of earning 

 a surplus over Rs 400 crore. And why shouldn?t they be? 

 A cricket telecast is still the most watched TV programme 

 on air. There are lots of eyeballs to be had. The channels 

 are confident that together the advertisers would spend 

 more than Rs 400 crore.

 What happens if Pathan 

 (top) chooses films over cricket and Sourav turns commentator?

 No one would have felt that this 

 is a risky assumption till Sehwag was getting his triples, 

 Sourav was scoring against teams other than Kenya, and Zaheer 

 was running in full steam. But what if: Sachin?s tennis 

 elbow compels him to bat at number seven; Pathan chooses 

 films as a career; Sourav is the winner of the Harsha 

 ki Khoj contest; inspired by Paaji, Sehwag opens a hotel 

 in Gurgaon; Rahul settles in Scotland; Kaif is an MP from 

 UP; Yuvraj is the new Maharaj; Aussies thrash India three 

 love ? each with a margin of an innings.

 What happens then to the eyeballs? 

 The $ 308 million is a bet that is being placed on most 

 of these not happening. Even after you discount the frivolity 

 of some of the scenarios, most would still seem unlikely 

 but not impossible. If the England trend continues, will 

 people watch? Will advertisers advertise? What happens to 

 the Pepsis and Videocons?

 US $ 308 million is a big gamble. 

 The critical point that must be remembered is that the Indian 

 team must do well for the gamble to pay off. Pepsi or Zee, 

 ESPN or Videocon ? none of them can make India do well in 

 the field. Only the board can. Are Zee and ESPN betting 

 $ 308 million on the board?s efficiency to make the Indian 

 team perform? Mr Dalmiya, is another Sachin ready for delivery?

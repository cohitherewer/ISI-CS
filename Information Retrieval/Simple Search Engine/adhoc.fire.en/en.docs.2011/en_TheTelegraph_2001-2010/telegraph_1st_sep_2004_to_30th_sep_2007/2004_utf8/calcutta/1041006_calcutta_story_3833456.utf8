The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rediscovering India

 A land of rich diversity where natures bounty, in the form of hills, rivers and valleys, shares space with noisy, bustling metropolises, unspoilt rural quietude mingles with the opulence of cosmopolitan culture and virgin tribes with their archaic methods of subsistence cohabit with the urban populace and their flashy lifestyles, India is virtually every photographers delight. Titled The Land and the People, the exhibition of photographs by B.P. Maiti marks an effort to capture the pulse of our country through powerful and evocative images of its people and places. A photo-visual journey spanning a period of 25 years and stretching across the entire length and breadth of the country, the photographs on show represent a time capsule wherein the discerning viewer can clearly detect the evolving pattern of the lives of our people and be witness to the slow, imperceptible but inevitable setting of our cultural horizons.

 Event: An exhibition of photographs, The Land and the People, by B.P. Maiti

 When: Till October 10, 4 pm - 8 pm

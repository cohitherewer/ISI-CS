 Diwali and Dhanteras would be incomplete without a new piece of jewellery for those celebrating the festival. With a spanking new jewellery store on every other street, there is supply enough for the overflowing demand. 

 To be heard in the crowd, most outlets with an eye on the festive bucks have rolled out a number of schemes to tempt buyers away from the competition. Here are some places offering great deals on a range of jewels that vary from the traditional to trendy:

Stone setters

 Diagold?s latest showroom at City Centre has spun out a rather unusual range of jewellery, traditional and yet not very conventional. Like the emerald or ruby earrings and neckpieces set in traditional gold designs with dewdrops or chandelier cuts. For the hip and trendy crowd, the contemporary 18k gold jewellery is a perfect accessory for the western look. This Italian line is easy on the pocket as well, coming in hues including pink and copper. 

 On the occasion of Dhanteras, there is a special surprise waiting for customers in the form of gifts and discounts with every purchase, based on a lucky draw.

Freebie fun

 Syndicate Jewellers is offering a surprise gift with every purchase on Dhanteras. Stylish and contemporary jewels from Tanishq are also going with a discount of up to 35 per cent on making charges on selected items. 

 Senco Jewellers is offering a discount of 25 per cent on making charges of its precious pieces. Here, a silver coin has also been thrown in with every purchase. 

 B.C. Sen Jewellers is offering a special lucky draw till November 12, where the first prize is a diamond necklace, the second prize a gold necklace and the third a pair of gold kangans. Apart from these, customers may also walk away with a range of 10 diamond rings and pendants. 

 At Anjali Jewellers, there is a 15 per cent discount on making charges of gold designs and 50 per cent on diamond jewellery. Thrown in is a complementary mehendi, snacks and a lucky dip.

Diamond delight

 Orra, part of the Rosyblue Group, is lighting up this Diwali with a fabulous free diamond gift offer worth 10 per cent of all purchases. Classic designs have been created set in 18k gold and studded with sparkling diamonds. 

 Keeping the Indian market in mind, the brand has introduced a new set of traditional designs. Another attraction is the Swarna Mudra, pure gold coins engraved with images of Ganesha, weighing five or 10 g. 

 Jewellery brand Kirti, which retails through Senco outlets in the city, launched two new lines, Kumkum and Nityah, for the festive season. 

 While Kumkum is meant for the vibrant woman of today, Nityah has an eye on tradition. From sleek to chunky, you can pick up pieces for a few thousand rupees or a few lakhs.

Collection coup

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI INVADES INDUSTRIALIST 

RUSSI MODYS ALIPORE ADDRESS TO CHECK OUT AN ARRAY OF ARTEFACTS

 Glimpses

(From top) 

 At the Mody residence, you stand the risk of falling down the stairs. Blame 

it on the distracting beauty of the paintings that line the walls. Eye-grabbing 

canvases next to the staircase, which is also fringed by a row of plants, could 

take hours to admire. I dont remember the names of all the artists 

anymore, he admits.

 This is an heirloom silver stave, kept with a few crystal pieces on the 

centre table in the ground floor drawing room.

 Mody still examines his collection of artwork with fascination. His latest 

passion is his collection of glass sculptures of animals. Here, he is seen with 

glass sculptures of a fish and birds. 

 This crystal sail of a ship placed on a side table is Modys favourite 

piece. 

He is famed for his collection of blue pottery. His 

eye is currently on glass animal sculpture. But there is far more to Russi Modys 

art and artefacts than whim and fancy. There is a living passion behind every 

piece that the grand old man of corporate India takes pride in.

There are innumerable artefacts arranged meticulously 

all over the Belvedere Road home. Apart from clearly taking a lot of time, the 

multitude of collectible needed a keen eye for finesse to build up. So what does 

it take to maintain a house like this? Fourteen servants and continuous supervision, 

smiles Mody.

Assortment appeal 

Stories about his enviable collection of blue pottery, 

collected from across the world, precede him. His crystals have always been the 

talk of the town and beyond, too. 

But my collection is not money-centric. It is based 

on beauty. I buy anything that I find beautiful. In my house youll find a piece 

worth Rs 5 and somethings worth Rs 5 lakh, confesses the industrialist. 

What you find in my house is of my own liking, I 

dont buy fashionable things for the heck of it.

His assortment of gleaming glass animals is growing 

in size. Camels, kingfishers, fish, roosters it is beginning to resemble a large 

slice of the animal kingdom. I pick these up from stores in the city, he says, 

pointing out a pair of bulls poised to fight each other.

This is my blue-and-white room, he proudly exclaims, 

walking into his ground-floor 1,000 sq-ft drawing room, overlooking well-manicured 

lawns. One is dumbstruck walking into this lavish room. From the smallest plate 

on the wall to four-foot-tall vases and lamp stands, everything here is in blue 

and white porcelain. Ive bought these mostly from Japan and China, he explains. 

The four alcoves on four sides of the room hold sculptures in coloured crystal. 

These are limited edition pieces which I bought from abroad, he says. 

Three Akbari paintings on ivory and others like miniatures 

of Jaipur find place on the walls of this room. 

This is my favourite piece, Mody says, pointing 

at a large crystal sail of a ship. An heirloom silver stave lies alongside a few 

crystal masterpieces on the centre table.

Do and Dont

 Keep making changes at home. Even the most well-done-up 

house can start to look boring after a while. Everyday I put some thought into 

the room Im spending most of my time in.

 A good collection is not just about having the money 

to create it. It is about the passion that goes into building it.

 Collect what you like, not what is in vogue. Nothing 

can be in fashion forever.

 To maintain a collection is not easy. You must learn 

to devote time to it. Servants may clean the rooms for hours, but this wont help.

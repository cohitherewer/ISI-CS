New blood, old shields amp; corporate cash

 MIDFIELD ACTION: The IFA has drawn up a host of schemes, including adopting coaching camps for youngsters, to help football regain its lost glory. A Telegraph picture

 Sachin wants to play football, and not cricket for a change. 

 No, we aren?t talking about Team India?s Tendulkar, but eight-year-old Sachin Ganguly from Ballygunge, who, along with many other young boys in the city, has suddenly been drawn to football.

 Like Sachin, youngsters are increasingly looking at the Wayne Rooneys and the Christiano Ronaldos as their role models and the Indian Football Association (IFA) is hopeful that the young brigade on the Maidan will lead a grand football revival in the city.

 Once regarded as the Mecca of Indian football, Calcutta has lost considerable ground over the years. But with the IFA deciding to devote more time to honing young talent, football is slowly looking to regain its lost glory here.

 To start with, three forgotten British-era tournaments ? the Trades Cup, the Eliot Shield and the Bankim Cup ? have been brought back from the cold. Sovabazar Club was the only Indian outfit in an all-British field to participate in the Trades Challenge Cup, started in 1889. However, the second oldest football tournament in the country died a slow death over the years.

 A few months back, 40 teams, 10 from the First Division and the Bengal under-19 team, participated in the tournament. The Eliot Shield (for city colleges) and Bankim Cup (for schools) have also been re-started. ?The idea behind reviving the tournaments is to ignite passion among young footballers about the game and the results should show in a few years,? says IFA secretary Subrata Dutta.

 In a welcome change, football in the state this year has received a huge boost by way of corporate support through a never-before sponsorship of Rs 50 lakh. 

 The IFA has also adopted 70 coaching camps, 30 of them in the city, as part of the project, addressing all their needs and sending coaches to prop up the ailing clinics.

 ?The state association is now taking care of our needs. Starting from footballs to shortage of gear and developing young talent, we suddenly have a parent to look after our needs. This sadly wasn?t there when we used to play the game,? says Chinmoy Chatterjee, ex-footballer and coach.

 Plans are also afoot to launch a state-of-the-art football academy in the city. The IFA Football Academy, the first of its kind in Calcutta, will kick off at the Kishore Bharati Stadium in Jadavpur, where sub-junior boys will be trained in the basics of the game to develop their skills in a scientific manner.

 ?At the moment, we are talking to sponsors and once the deal is finalised, the academy will start rolling,? says Dutta. 

 An under-19 football league has been started and more television coverage ensured to give the game a kick of life.

 ?The live telecast of tournaments, like the IFA Shield, has been wonderful, with a lot of viewership not only in India, but abroad. The upswing in interest in football among the masses is a welcome change,? says Shantanu Guha Ray of ESPN STAR Sports.

 The IFA is now working on two proposals to carry the soccer-boost initiative forward. The first is the introduction of ?franchisees? of the big three Maidan clubs in the districts, and the second, dividing the Bengal squad (under-16 to under-23) into four categories ? Saffron, White, Green and Chakra ? comprising 25 players each, for training and tournaments. 

 ?Once the scheme works out, we?ll have teams like Bankura East Bengal or Burdwan Mohun Bagan, which will, hopefully, translate into greater interest,? adds Dutta.

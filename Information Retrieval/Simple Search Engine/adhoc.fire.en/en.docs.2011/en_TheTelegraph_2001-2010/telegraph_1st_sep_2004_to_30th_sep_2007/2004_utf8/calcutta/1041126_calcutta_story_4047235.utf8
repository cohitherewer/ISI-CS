 Midsummer meets Macbeth

How about getting a feel of the barren heath in Macbeth or the lush woods in A Midsummer Night?s Dream, roaming through a maze of shrubs and trees? When the cold wind breezes through Calcutta in February 2006, a guided tour of Shakespeare on a green landscape is sure to be much more than just interesting.

 The ambitious project, titled Shakespeare in Forest, has been conceptualised by two theatre directors from poles apart ? city-based Suman Mukhopadhyay and Norway national Orjan Hattrem ? who have set the pre-production process in motion. The venture boasts a multi-cultural cast and crew, with participants from the UK, Holland and France.

 A top-rung actress from Budapest, the Prima Ballerina of Norwegian National Ballet and another actress from the UK have been finalised for the project comprising 16 actors and two musicians.

 More exciting than the motley cast is the concept that weaves in ?a tragedy set in a pagan era and a comedy unfolding in a modern period?, picking strands of similarity from the two texts.

 ?It is as if A Midsummer... carries on from where Macbeth ends. The pre-modern, warring milieu of the tragedy blends into the dream in the comedy, as a post-war situation. The stark and black in Macbeth become grey and then colour in A Midsummer...,? explains Hattrem, currently in town with his ensemble Innspael. 

 ?There?s also a similarity between Malcolm from Macbeth becoming Duke Theseus in A Midsummer? Besides, the likeness also runs in the forest scenes of Macbeth ? the killing of Banquo and the forest moving towards the castle ? and the wilderness in A Midsummer... The instinctive human nature runs in both ? the rawness in the tragedy and the eruption of erotic violence in the comedy. Both involve the elements of earth, fire, water and wind,? adds Mukhopadhyay, director, Tritiyo Sutra. A dramateur from Hungary will pen the final script, keeping both the storylines intact.

 The lavish production running into four hours is site-specific and will be mounted on some sprawling premises. For that, Mukhopadhyay has already checked out two golf courses. Also vital to the colourful opulence is the backdrop, to be designed by a scenographer from France who has been working closely with Peter Brooks.

 ?We are not looking for famous actors, but those who will understand the spirit of the work. So, we will look for actors across India, and maybe even Bangladesh and Pakistan,? says Hattrem, who struck a rapport with Mukhopadhyay on his first trip to Calcutta a few years ago to study Bengali theatre.

 Rehearsals for the project start from November 2005. After a performance in Calcutta, the project is likely to travel to Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai and at least all the European countries from where the participating members hail.

 Early this week, Hattrem?s troupe Innspael put up Inside Fatherhood: A Tribute to the Pregnant Man, exploring how men react when they become first-time fathers, at the Academy of Fine Arts. The performance was part of the 32nd birth anniversary celebrations of theatre troupe Chetana. 

 In Norway, Hattrem and his troupe stage the hour-long play at cafes and pubs. ?In my country, people in the age bracket of 18 to 25 don?t watch theatre. Cafes and pubs with an intimate audience are the best place to reach out to them,? explains Hattrem, who has received ?tremendous response? from the young audience. 

 An issue like fatherhood backed by reports from science journals only added to the viewer interest. ?Because I wanted to see if it was possible to make theatre out of facts,? he adds.

 After Inside Fatherhood, a two-member team from Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi, staged Freedom Song in Hindi in the Academy backyard, touching upon issues like the Godhra carnage, the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Sikh riots.

 The last play of the evening was Chetana?s Phalguni, an adaptation of the Rabindranath Tagore text.

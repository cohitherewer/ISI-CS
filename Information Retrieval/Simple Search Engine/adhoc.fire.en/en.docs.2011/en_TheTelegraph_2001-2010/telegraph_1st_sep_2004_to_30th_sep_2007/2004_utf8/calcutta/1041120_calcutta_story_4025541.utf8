The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Basu-baiter ?cheated?

 KINSUK BASU

 A businessman with a fleet of cars, a full-time corporate adviser, a political bit player and now a crusader.

 Tarak Singh wants to be known as the flamboyant David daring to take on the Goliath of the Left regime in Bengal, Jyoti Basu.

 But for Singh, Friday was a matter of so far, rather than so near.

 ?An unholy nexus, as the apex court puts it, must happen between two or more persons. So, if a representative from the judiciary has been indicted, how come the man from the administration, the former chief minister, has been left out? I somehow feel cheated,? Singh told Metro from his Sainik Farm residence, in south Delhi.

 Through the day, it was a desperate wait for a copy of the order to arrive.

 Finally, around 8 in the evening, when the assurance came that it would be sent to his residence, the man from Behala finally heaved a sigh of relief. The first, in almost seven years.

 ?It wasn?t easy taking on the might of the CPM. Soon after I lodged the petition, several efforts were made to close down my factory and even harm me. Bombs were hurled at my house. Terrorised, I used to stay awake through the night. Later, even the police refused to act on my complaint,? recounted Singh.

 ?I needn?t elaborate. Those who have dared to defy and borne the brunt know how it feels,? added the vice-president (projects) of a reputed company.

 In the Capital now in connection with the company?s future projects, Singh recalled: ?My petition was initially denied on the grounds that I was from the Trinamul Congress and this was a politically motivated plea. But let me assure you, politics is just a passion not profession for me. I didn?t spend a fortune pursuing the case for any publicity, as was first alleged.?

 A pause, and Singh carried on: ?I sincerely believe Dr BC Roy?s dream for Salt Lake has been sent for a toss. The residents of this township don?t represent the lower-middle class any more, thanks to the CPM?s policy. Jyoti Basu followed a policy of favouring a few and dumping the others.?

 Singh said besides Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, he had mentioned in his petition the names of Basu?s brother-in-law Subimal Basu, his biographer Surabhi Banerjee, son Chandan Basu and former advocate-general Naranarayan Gooptu. 

 ?It?s not about the beneficiaries. Anyone offered a plot of prime land for a premium would go for it. The man behind such favouritism is Jyoti Basu? Today?s Salt Lake is surely not what the great man (BC Roy) had envisaged,? Singh signed off.

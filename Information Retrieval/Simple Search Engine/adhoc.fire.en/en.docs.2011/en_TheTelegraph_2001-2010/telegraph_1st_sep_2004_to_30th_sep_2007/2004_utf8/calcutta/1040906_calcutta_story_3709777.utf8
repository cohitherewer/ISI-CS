 Wetlands rule shift

 - A WATERBODY FOR A WATERBODY

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Fill a waterbody to build flats or malls, but under certain conditions.

 Effecting a shift in approach, the government has lined up new legislation, named the Wetland Conservation Act, to conserve waterbodies in the city and its fringes.

 The environment department has drawn up the draft Bill and sent it to a nine-member cell, headed by planning and development department secretary Swapan Chakraborty, for a formal nod. 

 The cell, comprising officials from the departments of environment, forest, fisheries, land and land reforms and urban development, will also function permanently to redress disputes relating to landfill.

 The proposed Bill will allow a wetland located in a plot of land to be filled (partly or fully) for any construction activity on the condition that a new wetland of a similar size be created on some other part of the same plot.

 However, permission will not be granted if the wetland is found important for fire fighting or any other emergency. Also, if the wetland stands alone, that is, it is not in a plot of land, it cannot be filled up.

 The proposed Bill also states that while giving the clearance for filling up a waterbody, various factors will be looked into, like whether it is a natural wetland, an artificial one or was dug up for some other use. Permission to fill waterbodies will depend on the nature of waterbodies, their size and depth. 

 Existing rules prohibit filling up of any kind of waterbody. Officials explained that the proposed Bill was aimed at conserving waterbodies and not protecting them. 

 We want to maintain the area of wetlands that prevail in the city and other urban areas. If we allow anybody to fill a two-cottah wetland, he will have to create a new waterbody of the same size. So, the ultimate volume of waterbodies will be unchanged, officials said.

 Environment secretary Asim Barman refused to comment on the proposed Bill, saying it was under the consideration of the special cell. The environment department has drawn up the draft. I can only say that the provisions of the Bill have been framed on the basis of the realities and the need of the hour, he added.

 Once the draft Bill gets the nod, it will be placed before the Cabinet. Thereafter, it will be tabled in the next session of the Assembly, officials said.

 Another feature of the proposed Bill is that civic bodies, like Calcutta Municipal Corporation, will not have any power to sanction any building plan on a land with a waterbody. Such a building plan will have to be referred to the special cell.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Hosting business amp; pleasure

Since Lt. Governor Sir Stewart Bailey declared it 

open on May 24, 1887, Calcutta Swimming Club (then The Calcutta Swimming Baths) 

had always stood for most things prim and propah in the city?s clubbing lexicon. 

But the winds of change are really sweeping the Strand Road institution.

Close on the heels of the redone Main Bar, the club 

has unveiled its new-look banquets on the first floor overlooking the pools on 

either side. Outgoing president Nandu Belani (the club?s AGM is on September 25) 

and architect Dulal Mukherjee, who had steered the bar-revamp initiative, are 

at the heart of the banquets? makeover.

?When I assumed office last September, I had three 

wishes on my agenda ? renovation of the main bar, re-launching the banquets after 

an overhaul and getting the inside swimming pool heated. While I have achieved 

the first two on the checklist, the heating of the pool has to be taken up by 

the incoming committee,? says Belani.

With elements of deconstruction, ?slight twists and 

simple statements?, Mukherjee has sought to create a visual feel of space and 

openness. ?There?s not much you can do with banquets except changing the floor, 

wall and ceiling,? says the architect whose method here has been minimalistic.

So the flooring was changed from Indian marble to 

vitrified ceramic with wooden borders, and the pillars embellished with simple 

commercial ply generating a pattern and a feeling of softness. Frosted glass panels 

protect the walls and floating panels on the ceiling, along with tilted lamps 

and uplighters, enhance the deconstruction effect. With retractable wooden partitions, 

the banquets can be broken up into three venues to host three happenings simultaneously.

On both ends of the gigantic hall, the architect has 

created two soft-board vistas with geometric shapes tilted and cut to go with 

the theme (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). ?The dynamic patterns can be used 

to fix posters and messages during parties. It?s almost like a notice board converted 

into an object of art. The entire effort was geared towards giving the banquets 

a clean and contemporary look,? explains the architect.

Belani maintains that the management?s focus during 

his tenure has been to give the club a ?more modern outlook? and woo the youth. 

The results are showing. Earlier, the crowds would thin after the peak swimming 

season of March to July. ?Now, the Main Bar does brisk business almost the year 

round as perception is changing and youngsters are feeling more comfortable to 

use the facilities,? the president offers.

The new-look banquets will host corporate presentations 

by day and vibrant bashes by night to carry this forward.

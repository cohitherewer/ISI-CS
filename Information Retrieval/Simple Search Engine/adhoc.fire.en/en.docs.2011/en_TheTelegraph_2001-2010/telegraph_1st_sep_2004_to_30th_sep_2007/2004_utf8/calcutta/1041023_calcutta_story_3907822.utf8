 Anindyo robs a bank. It may sound 

 daring but Anindyo did it in the most unglorifying way. 

 It was so easy that he lost respect for the security systems 

 of our banks, the robbers who get caught while trying to 

 rob and the general public, who can more easily rob 

 a bank than withdraw money from it? And here he is, not 

 even a robber by profession? 

 He had his reasons this one and 

 only time. His wife Sheena has left him because he only 

 spends money on his new band and doesn?t earn. This is his 

 last chance to win her over. It needs hard cash? Nandini, 

 a girl in her early twenties, sits in the train with tears 

 welled up in her eyes. Anindyo enters Howrah station conning 

 the police. They follow him till the platform but Anindyo 

 slips in the train just as it starts moving and the police 

 lose track. 

 As he is settling down at the 

 door with a smoke, Anindyo notices a girl hanging a little 

 too dangerously from the other door of the same compartment. 

 Is she just adventurous or is she? Oh yes, she is! This 

 girl is contemplating a jump! 

 Anindyo wades through the crowd 

 and reaches right up to her and starts talking to her. He 

 finds out that Nandini had eloped and got married to Sarthak 

 a couple of years ago despite vehement protests from his 

 parents. Now after two years they are ready for a reconciliation 

 but Sarthak has disappeared from home after a huge fight. 

 Anindyo offers help and eventually 

 agrees to be Sarthak for the time being. Nandini is going 

 to her ancestral village Mahishadal. They have a traditional 

 family Durga puja there for the last 150 years. So Nandini 

 and Anindyo agree to enact this drama for the sake of her 

 200 extended family members. 

 A regretful Sarthak, in the meantime, 

 follows Nandini to Mahishadal for a reconciliation, too. 

 Anindyo was having a tough time being introduced to his 

 ?in-laws?. All 200 of them are coming out of his ears. He 

 realises that Nandini?s father is an ex-DIG of police, her 

 two elder cousin brothers are police officers. The entire 

 family seems to be squirming with the WB police department! 

 ?Saala? Jekhane bagher bhoy, 

 shekhanei shondhye hoy?!? Anindyo overhears them 

 trying to keep up with their work looking for a bank robber 

 and cribbing to the family how their Puja holidays are being 

 spoilt. He sneaks out for a smoke when a young gentleman 

 asks him for Nandini?s address. ?Oh, ta aapni ki dusho-ek 

 nombor?? ?Maane?? This is Sarthak (the audience 

 will have already known that). 

 ?Aapni?? ?Aami e barir 

 jamai? Anindyo says with a smirk on his face. Sarthak 

 says, ?Aamio!? A little later, once inside, Sarthak 

 sees, to his bewilderment, that the same jamai he 

 met outside is being introduced as the husband of his very 

 own wife. Sarthak gets out of the puja confusion in a rage, 

 trying to figure out how a girl can get married in two days 

 flat and keep a straight face. He takes refuge in 

 a dilapidated portion of the house from where he can see 

 almost all activities and even a part of the bedroom that 

 this new jamai now occupies with his very own wife. 

 He almost sort of settles down there. 

 Among her innumerable cousins, 

 to Anindyo?s horror, Sheena turns out to be one. From his 

 bird?s eye view, Sarthak notices that from a group surrounding 

 Anindyo and Nandini, a girl rushes out. Sheena. Sarthak 

 and Sheena get together and start making vindictive plans 

 to separate the other two. Do they succeed? The story is 

 within the five days of the Puja ? Sashti, Saptami, Ashtami, 

 Navami and Dashami. And two wrong couples stuck in a love-jeopardy. 

 Each individual in this jeopardy finds love all over again? 

 But is this love retrieved from the old situations or discovered 

 in the new ones?

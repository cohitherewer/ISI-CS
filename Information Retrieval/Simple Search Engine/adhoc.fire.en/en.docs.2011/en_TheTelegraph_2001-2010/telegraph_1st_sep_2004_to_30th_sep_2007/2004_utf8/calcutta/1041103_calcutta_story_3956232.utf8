 Rajasthani roster for festive fare

A 

churiwala from Jaipur and a mehndiwali will help accessorise your 

gear this Diwali. Designer boutique store Ekru has zeroed in on a Rajasthani village 

fair theme to add to its festive palette. 

 Going with the silver, lac and wooden bangles is the new range of fusion wear by Niki Mahajan, Sonali Mansingka, Priya Awasty and You along with Ekru?s own designs. Crushed skirts, ponchos, jholas and jootis to match the trendy yet ethnic fare are other highlights. 

 Home d?cor receives a fillip too with cushion covers 

priced at Rs 100 each and jazzed up with sequins, beads, mirrors and embroidery. 

Artistic diyas and floating candles, starting at Rs 10, bring up a colourful 

rear.

 Tarot try

 White cotton trousers, stripped aqua blue shirt, beaded slip-ons, manicured fingers and the right morning make-up. Indeed, the no-nonsense visage of celebrity tarot card reader and numerologist Sunita Menon shatters the conventional image of a mysterious woman. 

 ?I let my work do the talking,? began the 40-year-old fortune teller who has fashion designer Manish Malhotra calling her up every morning to discuss his day?s plans. Also the brain behind the K factor lapped up by soap queen Ektaa Kapoor, Menon was in town to address a Ladies Study Group meet at Taj Bengal on Tuesday. 

 She took a motley crowd of 300 through the basics of tarot card reading and numerology, espousing the cause of fortune telling. ?If your life is going fine you don?t need to consult any expert. Future mending tips at random is a strict no-no,? said Menon. ?When I suggested K to Ektaa, other producers in the industry went out of their way to toe the line, to usually disastrous results,? she elaborated. 

 An enthusiastic lot went on to fire a volley of: ?Why does the number 9 reappear in my life in the form of addresses, seat numbers, car plates??, ?I don?t know my date of birth, can you still read my cards??... which only tapered off as paneer pakoras and piping hot coffee made its presence felt. 

 Her celebrity count stood out nevertheless. ?Ektaa for sure, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Priyanka Gandhi, Shah Rukh Khan, Sachin Tendulkar,? she rattled off the list of names to watch out for in the coming year. If they play their cards right that is. 

 Fast feast

 If you are yet to get a taste of delicious Shahi Halim, drop by at Indus Valley before the month of Ramazan draws to a close. 

 Made of mutton, dalia, dal and nuts, it is as delicious a treat as it is nutritious after day-long fasting. Complementary seasonal fruits and grape twister (grape concentrate mixed with soda) act as perfect digestive after this rather heavy meal. And the entire package comes at a surprising Rs 59.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A different raga

It?s not easy to handle Perizaad Zorabian and Shabana 

Azmi at the same time and in the same frame. And if you are a debutant, it?s all 

the more difficult. But newcomer Prakash Rao does manage to achieve the near impossible 

as the male lead in Mahesh Dattani?s Morning Raga, releasing on October 

29. What?s more, the film is produced by Prakash?s father, K. Raghavendra Rao, 

the film-maker from the South, also behind Hindi hits like Himmatwala and 

Tohfa.

Despite coming from such a filmi family, acting 

was never Prakash?s calling. ?I had studied engineering and wanted to do my MBA 

before getting into business. But after attending Mahesh Dattani?s theatre workshop, 

I got really hooked on to acting. And since I had a background, I chose to make 

it a career option,? Prakash told Metro.

After a short stint with theatre, Prakash headed off 

to the US for formal training in acting. ?I learnt the ?method? acting technique 

which originated from Stanislavisky. The good thing about this technique is that 

it helps you connect with your emotions for real and express them in a way that 

is natural to you and your body language. They never tell you how to act. So as 

long as you can connect with your emotions truthfully, you are free to express 

them in any which way. So the technique can even be used in the Indian film industry.?

Back home, Prakash tried to do a masala Telugu 

film but failed to strike at the box-office. ?I found it very difficult to relate 

to the sensibilities of that film. After that I wanted to do something that I 

could identify with. I approached Mahesh to work on a story for a film. He came 

up with something very original and exciting, my father loved it and we went ahead 

with it. The project did start off because I was the male protagonist, but if 

you see the film you will see that all three protagonists are equally strong and 

relevant to the script. Even if I were not the lead, we probably would still have 

gone ahead and done the film.?

Prakash plays Abhinay, an ad-film jingle composer 

who chucks everything up to make music. ?I form a band and we produce electronic 

trance music. I then go back to my village and reconnect with my mother?s friend 

Swarnalatha (Shabana), a former Carnatic singer. The rest of the film is how me 

and Pinky (Perizaad) help Shabana overcome her psychological barriers, and then 

come together in making music with soul. In the process we discover love that 

had got lost in the past.?

Prakash hasn?t signed any new film and is waiting 

for Morning Raga to release. ?I?m sure the film will open up avenues and 

I hope something interesting comes by. I would do only films that make sense to 

me, both in mainstream and alternative genres. I don?t have a conventional face 

and so I see myself getting only unconventional roles. So it may limit me in certain 

ways, but at the same time it opens up a thousand possibilities.?

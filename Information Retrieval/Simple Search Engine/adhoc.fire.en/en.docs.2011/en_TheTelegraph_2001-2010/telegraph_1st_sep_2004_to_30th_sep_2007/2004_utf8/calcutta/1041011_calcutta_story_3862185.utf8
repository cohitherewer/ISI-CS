 A melodious tribute

 Taru Shruti remembers Rabindrasangeet exponent Ashoketaru Bandyopadhyay on his 74th birth anniversary with a piano recital by the celebrated musician, V. Balsara. Having composed innumerable musical scores for over six decades, V. Balsara is a master with the keyboards, with an extraordinary musical repertoire blending Indian and Western styles. This evening, he plays some of Bandyopadhyay?s favourite melodies on the piano, with vocal support by Koushiki Bandyopadhyay and the Taru Shruti choir. Himself an accomplished musician, Bandyopadhyay had a natural inclination towards the piano which he had put to good use in all his productions. In fact, it is a fitting tribute that V. Balsara, who had scored the music for Tagore?s Valmiki Pratibha, one of Bandyopadhyay?s own productions, will perform today. Balsara will be honoured with the Ashoketaru Smriti Samman at the beginning of today?s programme.

 Event: Tribute to Ashoketaru Bandyopadhyay

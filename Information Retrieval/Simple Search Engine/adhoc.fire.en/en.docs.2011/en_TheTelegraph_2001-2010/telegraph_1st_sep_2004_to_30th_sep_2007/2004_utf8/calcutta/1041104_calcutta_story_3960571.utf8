 Size matters in surgery for most

 - Doctors forced to upgrade knowledge of minimum invasive technique

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With more and more Calcuttans opting for surgeries that involve smaller incision, minimum scarring, minimum pain, less blood loss and faster mobility, doctors are keen on upgrading their knowledge to bolster their practice. 

 They stress that minimal invasive surgery is more popular today owing to advances in all fields of surgery, including cardiology, neurology, orthopaedics and ear surgery. This has changed the concept of healthcare delivery, forcing doctors to update their knowledge.

 ?It is amazing how people in Calcutta have become aware of the new techniques available in medicine. The age-old practices are passe and minimal invasive surgeries are popular. Now even doctors belonging to the old school of thought have started to change,? says L.N. Tripathi, neurosurgeon at the Apollo Gleneagles Hospital.

 According to city doctors, minimal invasive surgeries achieve the same surgical results as traditional operations, despite the fact that they are performed with much smaller incisions, involving the amalgamation of the miniature camera, digital images and fibre optics. Specially designed instruments and the aid of endoscopes (small cameras) inserted through keyhole size incision nowadays allow surgeons to peer deep inside the body without cutting through all the muscle. With the new techniques, neuro-surgeries such as micro discectomy for cervical or lumbar disc prolapse or endoscopic neurosurgery is much easier. 

 In cardiac surgery, minimal invasion has replaced most procedures, including balloon angioplasty. ?The minimal invasive surgeries, especially for diabetic patients with a heart problem, have proved to be a boon,? said cardiac surgeon Ashok Seth.

 With such changes in the quality of surgical procedures, more and more doctors are now spending time updating their knowledge, because patients have started to specify their preferences. ?Seven years ago, people would not believe that a laparoscopic procedure could cure them, but now they are the ones who are asking for it,? says surgeon B. Ramana. ?Complex surgeries of the bile duct, pancreatitis, cancer, removal of tumours and even reconstructive surgeries can be done through minimal invasion,? he added.

 From hardly four to five seminars three years ago, to more than 15-20 seminars and workshops for different medical disciplines every year, have changed the healthcare scenario. ?I remember attending three high-quality seminars last month in Calcutta, which I never thought would be possible when I was in the UK,? Ramana said.

 Minimal invasive procedures have brought about a revolution in the treatment of the hearing impaired, especially cochlea implants, required when the inner ear gets damaged. To treat the damage, a 1.6 mm hole is made outside the ear canal through which an electrode is inserted into the cochlea which helps in treating the patient. In orthopaedics, joint and hip replacement and spine surgery are areas where minimal invasive procedures are used.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 During a recent visit, I found that the area immediately outside Swabhumi, 

off EM Bypass, very filthy. Even though the interiors are in the best of conditions 

and well-maintained, the area is a blotch on the beautiful heritage park. Usually, 

big corporate houses act responsibly and give utmost attention to the cleanliness 

and hygiene of their premises and the surrounding areas as well. Then why is garbage 

strewn along the exterior walls of Swabhumi? I request the management to address 

this problem immediately so that visitors leave the spot with pleasant memories.

 Sumant Poddar, Kyd Street. 

 The footpath in front of Cooperative Bank, in Kankurgachhi, is chock-a-block 

with all kinds of stalls. With growth of business, some of the makeshift shops 

have devoured more space to stock their ware. A shop selling earthenware almost 

juts out onto the road. Surely, such advantages cannot be taken by the shop owner 

without the market committee turning a blind eye. Nor do the officers of the Phulbagan 

police station, which is a stones throw away from the spot, bother to keep 

a tab on such illegal transgress. Calcutta Municipal Corporations officials, 

who make the daily rounds of the area, also choose to be unaware. Who will look 

into the plight of the common man who pays taxes for the construction of footpaths 

but cannot use them?

 Many Calcuttans keep imported birds, white rabbits and guinea pigs as pets. 

But, it is very disheartening that the city does not have a single good animal 

hospital where these animals could get proper treatment when they fall sick or 

are injured. Apart from the emotional loss, owners also lose monetarily if the 

pet dies due to lack of treatment. More NGOs should come forward and set up a 

good birds? hospital. 

 Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park. 

 A fence separates Writers? Buildings from the rest of the office buildings 

in Lyons Range. The gap between this fence and the building is where office-goers 

dump waste during lunchtime. When the government has initiated beautification 

projects in other areas, especially in the heart of BBD Bag, is it not proper 

to beautify the surroundings of its office building as well?

 Chandan Ray, Sarsuna. 

 Calcutta Telephones should do something about its automatic fault-booking system. 

Whenever one tries calling 1951/2/3, the call gets aborted on its own after the 

golden voice takes the caller through a number of options. The other day I tried 

to complain about my faulty telephone (2472-8708) and gave up after the third 

attempt. 

 Name not given, Jodhpur Park.

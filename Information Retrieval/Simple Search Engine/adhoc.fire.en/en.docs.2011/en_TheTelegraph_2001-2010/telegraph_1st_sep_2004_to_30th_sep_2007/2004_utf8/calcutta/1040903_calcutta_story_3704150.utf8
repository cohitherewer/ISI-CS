The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stillborn car test centres

 JAYANTA BASU

 Deadline: October 1, 2004

 Directive: Upgrade all auto emission testing centres so they can assess tail-pipe emission by the Centres guidelines

 Status: Not a single centre has been upgraded

 Government stand: Were trying our best, but its almost impossible

 The deadline set by state transport department is barely a month away. And the preparation to meet it is anything but satisfactory.

 Following a high court order, the transport department had issued a directive more than a month ago, listing a series of dos for all 320-odd auto emission testing centres in the state. 

 Starting October 1, each centre will need to have an opacimeter with revolutions per minute and lubricating oil temperature sensor (for diesel vehicles), four-gas analysers (for petrol vehicles), computer, web camera, compatible software and printer. 

 Besides, each centre will have to be networked with the regional transport authorities.

 As of now, the centres have managed to instal only opacimeters, but without the sensors. Not even a single centre in Calcutta or Salt Lake is in a position to comply with the directive, said an environment official.

 Its very difficult. We have just received the ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) specifications about the machines to be used, and that, too, through a website. Still, were trying our best to meet the deadline, said H. Mohan, joint secretary of the transport department. 

 Despite the official protestations, a few transport officials admitted that reaching the target by October 1 is mission impossible.

 We will be happy if we could upgrade a few in Calcutta by that time, said an official. Auto Emission Testers Association secretary Asim Banerjee echoed the view. 

 The transport department has called a meeting of the action committee, comprising representatives from pollution control board, Auto Emission Testers Association and the transport department on Friday, to decide on a course of action.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Next weekend you can be at... 

Kairabera amp; Murguma

Imagine walking through deep forests, beneath towering 

cliffs, past huge lakes and through beautiful villages ? paradise, perhaps. But 

the road to this particular haven isn?t easy. There are no hotels or any modern 

facilities en route, so the traveller must be prepared to spend the night in a 

canvas tent, under the stars.

If you want to enjoy nature in its purest form and 

don?t mind roughing it out a little, then Kairabera and Murguma are the places 

to be. The two villages in Purulia are near enough to Calcutta to take off for 

the weekend. The best way to get there is to take a night train from Howrah and 

get off in the morning at Barabhum. From there, take a trekker to Baghmundi and 

finally, a bus ride to Koreng More.

If the bus is too crowded even for standing room, 

then take your place on the roof, all in the spirit of adventure.

Then, it?s time to stretch your legs. A four-km walk 

through a scenic village takes you to Kairabera, where you are welcomed by a huge 

reservoir. Take time out for a brief, self-cooked lunch ? or a packaged one if 

you?ve managed to carry it thus far ? while drinking in the breathtaking beauty 

of the lake. Simply sit on the banks and watch the sun set over the vast expanse 

of the Purulia outback.

After a night spent in a tent, enjoy a cup of cha 

as the sun rises. Breakfast cooked and eaten, climb up Chintoo Hill, overlooking 

the lake, which offers a bird?s-eye view of the waterbody. Back at ground level, 

munch on some lunch after the morning?s exercise. Then, it?s time to move on again.

Follow the ridge overlooking the lake. A short but 

steep ascent takes you to the top. Continue walking, past the picturesque tribal 

villages of Jering Sering, Mamudi and Loya. The colourful mud huts and scattered 

fields are a sight for sore eyes. The villagers are friendly, always ready to 

help you find your way. 

After walking five or six hours, Murguma lake appears 

on the horizon. An hour?s descent later, you?re at the shore, in Murguma village. 

Check in at the irrigation bungalow, where a dinner and a good night?s sleep will 

help restore your strength.

Next morning, enjoy a leisurely walk along the embankment 

or just perch yourself at one spot and breathe in the fresh air and appreciate 

Mother Nature in all her pristine glory. Post-lunch (bhaat and puti 

machher jhol) at the local hotel, it?s time to pack your bag for 

the last time. 

A three-kilometre walk along the metal road brings 

you to Begun Kodor, a small town with a palace and a temple in ruins. A two-hour 

bus ride to Purulia and a night train later, you?re back in the city, tired but 

happy.

How to get there

Howrah-Chakradharpur Passenger from Howrah station 

at 10.40 pm. Get off at Barabhum the next morning. Take a trekker to Baghmundi 

(fare Rs 10) and then a bus to Koreng More (Rs 8). The jeep service to Kairabera 

is infrequent, so you could walk the four km. It?s the same story from Murguma 

to Begun Kodor, so again, walk the three km. From Begun Kodor, there are regular 

buses to Purulia (Rs 18), from where you can take the train back. The Chakradharpur 

Passenger arrives in Howrah the next morning.

Where to stay

Kairabera has an abandoned irrigation bungalow, so 

the only option is to camp. The area is frequented by wild elephants, so it?s 

best to camp inside the bungalow complex. Murguma has an irrigation bungalow. 

It can be booked from the irrigation department in Calcutta or in Purulia. There 

is a lot of camping space.

What to eat

At Kairabera, self-help is the only option. Food is 

available at a reasonable rate at the bungalow in Murguma. There are also small 

eating places, but food has to be ordered in advance.

 Bachchan on Black

 Vijay, teacher Dinanath Chauhan?s son in Agneepath, is all set to don the role of a teacher in Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s forthcoming film Black. But picking up the skill set to interact with a deaf, mute and blind student (Rani Mukherjee) has not been easy, even for a man called Amitabh Bachchan. For Bollywood?s original angry young man ? seen more as a doting father or middle-aged army officer these days ? the role of a caring teacher was indeed a ?challenge?. 

 ?How do you communicate with someone who can?t see, hear and speak? The only way you can do it is by touching the person. The director took me to an institute to train to communicate with a deaf, mute and blind person. It was really difficult,? said Bachchan, who also had some sessions with an overseas expert, flown in by Bhansali to equip the actor with teaching techniques. 

 Chatting with The Telegraph on March 16 at The Grand Hyatt in Singapore, on the sidelines of a curtain raiser for the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Awards 2004, Bachchan discussed his role in Black.

 Despite the degree of difficulty ? Bachchan gave a demonstration during the interaction by holding the hands of a journalist and explaining how he had to communicate with Rani in the film by touching her palms ? he thoroughly enjoyed the role. And he was all praise for Bhansali. ?He is an amazing director and is really versatile. It is only he who can think of a film like Black after making Devdas,? he stressed. 

 On being asked whether such a storyline would draw people to the theatres, he clarified that Black could not be dubbed a tragic tale. ?It focuses on challenges and relationships and at the end it is a feel good story,? said Bachchan.

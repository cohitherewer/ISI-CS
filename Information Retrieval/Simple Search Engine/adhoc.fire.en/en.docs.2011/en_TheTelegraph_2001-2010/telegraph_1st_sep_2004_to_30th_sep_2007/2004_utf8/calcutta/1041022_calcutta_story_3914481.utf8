Pandal-hop from home

Good news for those who dare not brave the Puja madness 

but would love to catch a glimpse of the revelry from the comfort couch at home. 

Even better news for those faraway souls who get oh-so nostalgic at this time 

of the year but can do little but pine for remote-control Puja presence.

and live through a virtual Puja. Download special recipes and ring tones, watch 

video clippings from various pandals, play games, send e-greetings...

Here?s a walk-through of the ideal destination to 

savour the Puja dynamics, from a distance. The site can be browsed in both Bengali 

and English. There are eight sections ? Pandal Hopping, Puja 5 Days, Greetings, 

Kids amp; Fun, Recipes, Download Zone, Puja News and Mobile.

Pandal Hopping allows you to upload your own Puja 

pictures and share them with everyone. It doesn?t matter ? as the site says ? 

whether you are in Orlando or Ougadougou, watch your photos match up to those 

sent by enthusiasts from around the world.

Puja 5 Days brings video clips from pandals around 

the city, while at Greetings there are beautiful e-cards you can send to your 

loved ones.

The highlight of the sight-and-sound show is certainly 

at Kids amp; Fun, with the animated movie Mahishashur Pala. It?s a look 

at Durga puja from a slightly different perspective ? the poor mahishashur?s, 

to be precise ? as he narrates the plight of being the only villain of the Pujas. 

Good for lots of lasting laughs. Then there are games like snakes and ladders 

(Durga and Asura replacing the ladder and the snake), memory games and cross and 

naught.

Mouth-watering dishes await you at Recipes with items 

like Phulkopir Roast, Potoler Dorma and Machher Kopta Curry on the menu, while 

the download section features Puja-themed screensavers and wallpapers.

Puja News links you to all news linked to the festival 

from the ABP site. Mobile features ring tones ? ranging from Nishi raat banka 

chaand to Tomar dekha nai ? as well as logos wishing ?shubho bijoya? 

and ?happy Durga puja?.

to have the best virtual Puja possible, you?ll need Macromedia Flash in your Internet 

browser to enjoy the site. If you don?t have it already, no sweat, the plug-in 

can be downloaded from the site itself.

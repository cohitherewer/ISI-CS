 History hidden in a picture box

 - Unclaimed carton at airport facility yields treasure-trove photo collection

 One of the Dr Ambedkar pictures retrieved in the airport storage area

 It was a day like any other at the Indian Airlines storage facility of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, where unclaimed luggage is kept. Except, on this particular rainy mid-June day, one of the innocuous cardboard boxes, when opened, was found to contain a priceless trove of national treasures ? 96 (mostly black-and-white) photographs chronicling the life and times of Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar.

 ?The minute I saw them, I realised they were invaluable. I immediately contacted the regional director,? says deputy general manager (stores and purchases) V.C. Barik, who was present when the box was opened. ?There were pictures of leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Dr Rajendra Prasad and Dr Ambedkar. I knew they were of great historical value.?

 According to regulations, unclaimed baggage is stored for six months for owners to claim. Then, they are disposed of depending on their value. In this case, then regional director M.S. Balakrishnan figured they were important enough to dash off a letter to the National in New Delhi.

 ?Some of the photographs were damaged, because of neglect, but it was an impressive collection,? he recalls. ?I wondered how someone could just forget about them.?

 The prompt response from the National office was the arrival of the assistant director of archives, Pramod Mehra, who took one look at the pictures and ascertained their value, and the fact that they needed immediate restoration. So, he carted them back to the Capital and began the process of returning them to their original form.

 ?The value of these photographs cannot be quantified in terms of money. Their historical and cultural significance is priceless. They are authentic and some are rare, like those of Dr Ambedkar?s parents and brother. Particularly striking is a colour portrait of Jyotiba Phule, the man who inspired Ambedkar,? says Mehra.

 The collection has since been fumigated, pressed and flattened, in an attempt to restore the pictures. ?The humid weather in Calcutta affected the photographs. They had also become wet at some point. They were in bad shape, but irreplaceable,? explains Mehra. ?We plan to hold an exhibition on Dr Ambedkar early next year, for which the photographs will be used. They have enriched our collection.?

 Teen lynched by local club

 - Boy accused of bicycle theft, two flee after killer assault

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Members of an Ekbalpore club on Sunday beat 14-year-old Mohammad Anish to death, suspecting him to be a bicycle thief. The incident, which took place on Mayurbhanj Road, has sent shock waves through the neighbourhood.

 A case of ?culpable homicide not amounting to murder? has been initiated against two members of the club, who are absconding. A warrant has been issued against the two and a high-level inquiry started on orders from the top brass. 

 The incident is a chilling reminder of the lynching of a vagrant near Momin High School, in Narkeldanga, a few weeks ago. The victim was suspected to be a child-lifter. 

 Around 1.30 pm on Sunday, a few members of Evergreen Club had gathered to track down the thief. The bicycle, which belonged to a maulavi, was reportedly stolen on Saturday, while he was taking a class for neighbourhood children on the club premises. 

 After a brief discussion, the members came to the conclusion that Anish was the culprit and went to his house on Bhukailash Road. 

 As soon as Anish stepped out, he was taken to a spot near the club. There, he had to face a volley of questions from the club members. 

 Anish pleaded innocence, but that didn?t deter the members from beating him up. ?A series of heavy blows landed in his face, followed by kicks in his abdomen. The boy slumped to the ground,? said an officer of the local police station.

 Even as Anish groaned in pain, two members continued thrashing him till he fell unconscious. The members then fled. Onlookers picked up Anish and rushed to SSKM Hospital. He died on the way. 

 ?Anish had no criminal record. His father is a daily-wager,? said O.P. Gupta, deputy commissioner of police (port).

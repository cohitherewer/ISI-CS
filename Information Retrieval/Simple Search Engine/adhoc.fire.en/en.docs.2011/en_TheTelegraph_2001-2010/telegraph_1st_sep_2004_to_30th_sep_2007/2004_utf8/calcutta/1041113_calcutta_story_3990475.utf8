 Interest waiver cash for roads

 - Plan to mop up 600 cr unrealised property tax

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee plans to invest the earnings ? expected to be not less than Rs 200 crore ? from the second phase of the waiver of interest scheme to tone up the city?s road infrastructure. 

 The list of proposed priorities includes two complementary flyovers at Esplanade and Ballygunge Phari, a vehicular underpass or flyover at Moulali, concretisation of tram tracks along BB Ganguly Street and a mastic asphalt top coat for important roads.

 In the first phase of the waiver scheme, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation collected Rs 120 crore and spent it to augment the city?s water supply infrastructure to make it compatible with the population load till 2025. ?I invested Rs 300 crore on the city?s water supply augmentation scheme and created new facilities for an additional supply of 60 million gallons of treated water daily,? said Mukherjee.

 Following a meeting between the mayor and municipal commissioner Debashis Som it was decided that the waiver of interest scheme will remain valid for about nine weeks from November 22 to January 31 (2005). From February, the civic authorities will start taking stringent action ? disconnection of water supply and drainage lines, acquisition of movable properties ? against house owners who don?t clear dues by then.

 The total unrealised property tax from one lakh house owners is about Rs 600 crore, of which Rs 400 crore is due from 5,000 owners. The mayor will write to all of them to notify them of the waiver scheme. During the first waiver of interest scheme in 2001, Rs 120 crore was collected out of the total outstanding of over Rs 700 crore. Owners of both residential and commercial buildings can clear their unpaid property tax up to 1999-2000 without paying interest and penalty on the outstanding principal amount.

 According to officer-on-special duty Shaktibrata Ghosh, house owners will be given 34 working days till December 24 to apply for the benefit of the waiver of interest scheme. 

 They will be allowed to deposit their outstanding principal amount during this period if they get a demand notice to pay up.

 ?It is the last opportunity for house owners to pay outstanding property tax with a double bonus in the form of savings of the amount of cumulative interest on the principal amount and the penalty,? said Mukherjee. 

 Last opportunity, as the basis of civic property will be changed from next year. Necessary legislation is in the offing. Till now, notional rent value of a landed property served as the basis of determining property tax on a building and it will be replaced with area-wise tax rate per sq ft.

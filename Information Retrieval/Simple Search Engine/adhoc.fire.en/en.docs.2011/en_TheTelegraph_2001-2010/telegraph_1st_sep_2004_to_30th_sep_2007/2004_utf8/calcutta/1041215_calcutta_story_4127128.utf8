 Tribute to a living edifice

 An epitome of German architectural excellence, Rathaus, the Town Hall, is Hamburgs most prominent building and commands a powerful presence as the seat of the B?rgerschaft (Parliament) and of the Senate. Built in the north German Neo-Renaissance style, Rathaus brilliantly reflects the power, authority and personality that characterise the Germans. A silent witness to over 100 years of history, it has survived the years well, escaping Allied bombing during World War II, which reduced most of Hamburg?s residential and industrial areas to rubble. A historically and politically important landmark on Hamburg?s horizon, this fascinating building has been captured on camera by photojournalist Nilayan Dutta. His photo-essay on Rathaus, comprising 10 photographs, visually embodies its throbbing, pulsating quality, and magnificently symbolises the best of many German characteristics in design: strength, attention to detail and perfect planning.

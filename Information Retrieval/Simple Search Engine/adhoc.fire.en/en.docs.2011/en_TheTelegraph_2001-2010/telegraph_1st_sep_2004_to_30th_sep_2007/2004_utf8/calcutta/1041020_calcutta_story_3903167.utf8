 Fire frown on five pandals

 The fire services department on Tuesday issued warnings to five puja organisers across the city for not adhering to the fire-avert strictures. 

 A report pointing out the shortcomings of the organisers was submitted hours after a pandal was gutted in Bhabani Dutta Lane, off College Street. The fire broke out around 3.55 am at a pandal put up by Azad Hind Sangha. 

 This was the first blaze since the countdown began. 

 With not many people around in this otherwise-crowded locality, it was left to the club members ? busy with the last-minute decorations ? to fight the blaze before fire tenders arrived on the spot. 

 With several inflammable articles strewn around, the fire that flared up at the pandal top spread fast as it engulfed the tarpaulin. The pandal, a 400-sq-ft affair, was gutted in a matter of moments and despite the best of efforts, the image could not be saved. 

 The Sashti blaze has left the fire department rattled. Keen to prevent a rerun of the incident, a team of senior fire officers, led by director of fire services Baren Sen, made their last round of visits during the day before submitting the report. It was compiled over five days and covered pujas of different sizes and budgets across the city. 

 The report raises a finger at five pujas ? three in Bhowanipore, and one each at Amherst Street and Behala?s Buro Shibtala, as being fire-prone. 

 ?We have asked the organisers to get their act right immediately and follow the fire-fighting norms. The vigil does not stop here. The department will continue making the rounds till Navami to point out to the organisers their slip-ups,? Sen said.

 Fire services officers said the exercise of informing the organisers about their lapses had paid off in the past, to the extent that most of them would ensure that the mistakes were not repeated in future. 

 While going easy on the issue of slapping fines, the department this year has issued a whip asking all organisers to ensure that the exit was bigger than the entrance of pandals and that all electrical wiring would have to be carried out by licensed contractors. 

 Besides, proper equipment should be in place to fight possible fires, like sand, fire-extinguishers and water. 

 Even arrangements for cooking bhog would have to be made at a safe distance from the pandal. 

 To drill home the finer points of fire-fighting, the fire department this year had organised a two-day training programme for the puja organisers at Behala and Chittaranjan Avenue. 

?The response, if not overwhelming, surely throws 

a ray of hope. This year, 96 persons from 48 puja organisations turned up for 

the class and they had to take basic lessons,? Sen said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cartoon film debut for kids

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They had spent long hours with pen, paper and animation tools to bring their stories to life. And Children?s Day promises to reward all that hard work. Animation films made by eight kids ? from the youngest Nehal Binani, 8, to oldest Gabriel Gomes,13 ? are scheduled for screening at Sisir Mancha on November 14, as a part of the Kolkata Film Festival.

 Work had started at a four-day workshop at Toonz Webel Academy in June. Selection was tough since there were around 1,000 applicants. And the young animation enthusiasts gave it their best shot, loving every moment of it.

 The semi-finished creations were then packed off to the Toonz headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram. ?The finished films have not deviated much from what the children sent,? explained Srimati Mukherjee, project leader of Toonz Webel Academy. ?Some minor adjustments were made by experts, such as adding a few missing frames and putting finishing touches.?

 The result: six traditionally hand-drawn 2D films, one stop-motion and one Flash-based short. ?The character skin colours and dresses were all done according to the way the children wanted them to be,? explained Mukherjee. ?They had even jotted down the sound effects in the margins, which were followed.? The animation shorts do not have voiceover, but have background music and sound effects.

 ?The experts were very impressed with the material they received,? said Mukherjee. ?In fact, they said it was the best lot they have seen in the past few years.? The Toonz workshop had started in 2001, but this year was a first for West Bengal. 

 Though the entire process of fine-tuning took place in Thiruvananthapuram, the kids were actively involved in it, even from faraway, providing feedback and updates. 

 ?We were in touch over email,? said 12-year-old Sumit Sen, whose Green Man will be shown on Sunday. ?We were also called to the academy in October, when someone from Thiruvananthapuram showed us our storyboards. They were looking so much better and I loved them.? Sumit and his family are eagerly waiting for Sunday.

 In what is a first for the Kolkata Film Festival, a separate 90-minute slot has been provided for animation films daily, where Toonz will showcase some of its earlier productions. Thus, along with nine-year-old Srijoni Gupta Roy?s Each Book Values, 13-year-old Gabriel Gomes? Eat Us Not, and eight-year-old Nehal Binani?s Foolish Fox, films from children?s animation workshops in 2001 and 2002 can also be seen.

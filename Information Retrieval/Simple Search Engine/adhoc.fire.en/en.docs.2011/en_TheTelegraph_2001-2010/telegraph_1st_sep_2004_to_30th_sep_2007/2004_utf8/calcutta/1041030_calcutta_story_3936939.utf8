The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The underpass below the Kankurgachhi-Bagmari rail bridge was meant for trams 

only. But nowadays since plying of trams on the route has been suspended for relaying 

of the tracks on APC Road, the underpass is used by private buses, lorries and 

other heavy vehicles. As a result, the condition of the road and the railings 

has deteriorated. The whole stretch has been converted to a garbage dump for local 

residents. Passers-by use the spot as a public urinal. What impression would such 

a scene leave on tourists? I urge the authorities to clean the underpass and repair 

the parapet along the road.

 Of late, posters of the launch of nursery schools, coaching centres, melas, 

exhibitions and soirees have flooded the city. Most of these events/institutions 

are supposedly for the betterment of society at large. But why are the people 

associated with them bent upon ruining the look of the city? Earlier, posters 

used to be associated with elections and cinema only, but now every other individual 

puts up posters for small functions also. Authorities should either ban putting 

up of posters or make a rule whereby the organisers of such events would be punished 

if the posters are not removed within a given time limit.

 My letter about a Puja pandal near Taratala crossing appeared in this column 

on October 16. The structure had blocked the left flank of the stretch of Diamond 

Harbour Road, with the flyover construction site taking up a portion of the remaining 

space. Thankfully there were no accidents during the Puja days. The organisers 

had erected a rope barricade around the pandal. Several volunteers were also seen 

frantically urging pandal-hoppers and vehicles not to crowd near the pandal. Perhaps, 

the authorities had warned them to take the precautions. The published letter 

certainly had the desired effect. 

Govind Das Dujari, Diamond Harbour Road. 

 Has anybody ever visited the City Bank branch in Bombay Mutual Building near 

the India Exchange Place and Brabourne Road crossing? Don?t the clothes spread 

out for drying by the footpath-dwellers look untidy? The family has encroached 

on the entire width of the pavement with wooden boxes, chulas and utensils. 

Hundreds of office-goers are inconvenienced because of them. Everybody knows what 

civic facilities the general public ought to get. The day is not far when people 

would have to fight for a toehold on footpaths. 

Chandan Ray, Sarsuna.

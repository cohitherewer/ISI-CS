The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 She?s got the look

 Red bindi blazing the forehead, vermilion in middle parting, alta smeared on feet. That was Soha Ali Khan?s uniform for Rituparno Ghosh?s Antarmahal, except the saris and jewellery she changed everyday. For two weeks flat, all she did was hole up in the Tollygunge studios from dawn to dusk and breathe life into a 19th Century character with whom she could hardly relate.

 ?It has been very challenging understanding my role? She (Chhotobou) was an oppressed woman who didn?t have freedom of choice? So different from who I am. But Rituparno made my job a lot easy, helping me with emoting, dialogue delivery and make-up. He sits with you and looks into all the details,? says zamindar Jackie Shroff?s second wife, loving her new look after a pristine white spell in Anjan Das? Iti Srikanta. ?Both (Kamallata and Chhotobou) are unlike me. If one was wise, spiritual and mature, the other was young, innocent and timid,? she adds.

 This month, the post-graduate from London School of Economics switches gear from arty films to hardcore masala fare. In Anant Mahadevan?s Dil Maange More, co-starring Shahid Kapur, Soha plays an ambitious small-town girl who dreams of making it big in the city. Next up, Rajshree Ojha?s English feature film Yatna (which has Soha as a north Indian student, ?melancholic and intellectual?), Somnath Sen?s untitled project and a couple of Hindi films which she hasn?t signed yet.

 The role roll couldn?t have been more exciting. ?I don?t have a dream role. It varies from project to project? The idea is to explore your personality. I am going through a stage of self-discovery, professionally and personally, and I don?t want to be typecast. I was off to Mumbai in between the Antarmahal shoot to do a rock ?n? roll number for Dil Maange More. Four days later, I was back in sari and sindoor,? she tells you animatedly.

 ?But I wouldn?t encourage anyone to juggle too many projects at the same time. It might affect your concentration. I am only learning now. For instance, I hadn?t worked with glycerine before. And I had intense scenes with lots of emotion and anger which I wasn?t used to doing,? she reveals.

 It was up to ?considerate co-actor? Abhishek Bachchan, playing a Bihari potter in the film, to take time out of his busy schedule and teach Chhotobou how to go about the intense scenes. But in English, mind you. ?Our Bengali conversation was rather limited,? admits Soha, with a Sharmila Tagore smile, dimpled and devastating.

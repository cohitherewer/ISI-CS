 Bengal blooms to woo Boston

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the Dutch, the government plans to win American hearts with flowers.

 Samples of tuberose, anthurium, orchid and gerbera were sent on Friday from Calcutta to Boston, where they will be tested by a private company. If the quality is found satisfactory, there could be regular export of flowers from Bengal to Boston in the near future.

 A senior official of the West Bengal State Food Processing amp; Horticulture Development Corporation said this was yet another initiative to encourage entrepreneurs to export flowers to as many countries as possible. 

 ?We export the maximum amount of flowers to Holland. There is quite a demand for tuberoses there,? the official added. 

 Every week, 7,000 to 10,000 tuberoses, worth Rs 1.5 lakh, are sent to Holland. The figure has increased in the couple of years since the first consignment was sent. The corporation has also exported flowers to London and Sharjah, though trade with Holland is more regular. 

 ?We are glad that the government initiative has made an impact. A lot of companies are now regularly exporting flowers to several countries,? the official said. 

 There has been a huge increase in the area on which flowers are cultivated. The number of farmers, too, has increased. The spurt in flower cultivation has been maximum in Rajarhat and Panskura. Infrastructure, especially packing and storage facilities, have also improved through government and private efforts.

 ?Last month, however, a lot of flowers were destroyed in the rains that led to severe waterlogging in several parts of the state. As a result, flowers could not be sent to Holland. But the tuberoses are ready and we will soon start exports again,? the official added. 

 ?If the Boston firm likes our flowers, our export to the USA is likely to be as regular as that to Holland,? said corporation managing director N. Hazra.

 Women face much trouble while travelling between Ballygunge and Ghutiari in 

local trains. The ladies? compartment is usually packed with vendors carrying 

vegetables and fish. Since they are in big groups, they seldom heed requests by 

passengers to give them space to at least stand comfortably. It has been observed 

that the vendors enjoy a good rapport with most of the ticket checkers. Some of 

them also collect a weekly amount from the vendors . Railway authorities should 

take measures to stop this practice.

 Over the past few months, there has been a spurt in crime in certain pockets 

of Sarsuna Satellite Township. Cases of petty theft, snatching and eve-teasing 

have become common despite the existence of a police outpost inside the township. 

The outpost often refuses to accept FIRs and harasses the residents when they 

approach for help. For the last one month residents had formed groups for patrolling 

the area at night. Now, the job has been delegated to a private security agency. 

 Recently, in a meeting, the officials of the nodal police station at Thakurpukur 

feigned ignorance of any complaints made with the outpost and suggested that complaints 

be lodged simultaneously with the outpost and the nodal police station for better 

results. The residents are anxious as they have realised they are helpless. It 

has also been noted that the local political leaders are not finding time to visit 

the affected areas and assess the situation, leave alone take up the cause of 

the residents. Instead of paying the amount to the private security agency, would 

the police protect the people if they are paid the same sum?

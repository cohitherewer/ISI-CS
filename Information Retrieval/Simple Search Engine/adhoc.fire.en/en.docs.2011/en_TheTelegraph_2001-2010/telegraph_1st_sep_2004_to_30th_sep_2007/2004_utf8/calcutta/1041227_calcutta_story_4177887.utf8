Usually a hub of activity, the underprivileged children?s home wore a deserted look on Sunday, with two lone Christmas wreaths hanging desolately on the main gate. Inside, the muted sounds of activity on a winter afternoon were not quite the norm during the festive season.

 Perhaps, because beyond the heavily-guarded, locked gates of Sabera Foundation, in Kalitala, the future of the kids was uncertain, with founder-director Carlos Duran deported on Saturday night. 

 What was a veil of secrecy, with hush-hush visits by celebrities and whispers about monetary dealings, has now become an iron curtain.

 The Spanish national was reportedly sent to Barcelona, via Amman, on a Royal Jordanian flight. According to sources, he was to be arrested by Barcelona police on arrival.

 It is still not clear why his visa was cancelled or the reasons behind his deportation, with Writers? Buildings and immigration officials still silent on the subject. 

 ?He was sent on last night?s flight to Spain, but we are not sure if it was to Madrid or Barcelona. We don?t know if he has arrived yet, but we are keeping in touch with the Spanish embassy,? home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said on Sunday. ?We don?t have to know the reason for his deportation, so the Centre hasn?t informed us.?

 Before leaving the city on Saturday, Duran told Metro: ?It is all about the money. In 2002, when Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas hosted the charity dinner for Sabera in their home in LA, over $5 million was raised. Then the US branch wanted to control the funds, so there were problems and we split. I think that is why they are doing this.?

 Back at the Kalitala home, beyond Thakurpukur, the children continued with the their daily routine, although spirits were ?down?, according to home superintendent Debora Lawless. ?The younger ones are very upset, the older children are coping better. But I don?t know what the future plans are,? she added. 

 The home was started in 1999 by Duran and Spanish singer Nacho Cano, with two girls, one of who was called Sabera. He then roped in friends like Penelope Cruz, who had already spent time in Calcutta working with Mother Teresa. Then, Tom Cruise, Griffith and Banderas joined the cause, setting up the US branch of the NGO. 

 However, a rift between the two arms of the foundation last year forced a split. 

 Celestine (Duran?s pregnant wife) returned from the airport around 11.30 pm on Saturday, having not being allowed to see her husband. She is planning to move court.

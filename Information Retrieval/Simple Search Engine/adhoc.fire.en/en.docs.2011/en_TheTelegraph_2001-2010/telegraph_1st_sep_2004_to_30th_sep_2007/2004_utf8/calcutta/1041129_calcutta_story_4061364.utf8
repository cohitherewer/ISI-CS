 The City Diary

 Come December, one of the city?s most recognisable landmarks, Rabindra Setu (Howrah bridge), will start getting a fresh coat of paint, albeit a little later than scheduled. The original plan had been to start painting the historic bridge from October 17, the birthday of Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), which maintains the bridge and was the executing agency during its construction. But the programme had to be rescheduled. 

 ccording to CPT chairman A.K. Chanda, the earlier tenders had to be ?scrapped? as very few competent companies had responded to the call. ?There were too few technically-competent companies? and we had to invite tenders afresh,? chief engineer S. Chatterjee explained on Sunday.

 resh tenders were invited on November 24. ?This time, four noted paint manufacturers have already responded,? Chatterjee added. The entire procedure of painting the 26,500-tonne steel bridge, which is 2,150 ft long and 280 ft tall, has been delayed, but according to Chanda, should be ?worth the wait?.

 Two children were killed and six injured when the driver of a private car lost control and knocked down a group of boys playing on Coalworth Road, near Sonadighi, on Sunday morning. The incident sparked protest by local residents, who beat up a constable and smashed the window panes of the car. The vehicle has been impounded and the driver arrested. 

 hile eight-year-old Babu Gupta died on the spot, seven-year-old Satish Gupta succumbed to his injuries while being taken to SSKM Hospital. Local residents later put up a roadblock, which was lifted only after senior police officers rushed to the spot. The condition of two of the injured was stated to be serious.

 Two persons were killed in road accidents in Howrah on Sunday. An unidentified youth was knocked down by a truck on National Highway 6 in Uluberia. Police said the man was taken to a nursing home, where he was pronounced dead. The vehicle could not be impounded. 

 n the other incident, a truck hit a 30-year-old cyclist, identified as Ratan Naskar, in Jagadishpur. Naskar was on his way to work in Belgachhia, Liluah. Residents of Belgachhia blocked Benaras Road for four hours to protest rash driving. The killer vehicle has been impounded and the driver arrested. Senior police officers rushed to the spot to pacify the protesters. 

 The body of a 30-year-old man, Bachua, was found in front of a jute mill in Barrackpore on Sunday morning. Police said Bachua was a criminal and suspect that gang rivalry was behind his killing.

 Fires broke out at two spots in the city on Sunday. A godown off Central Dairy, on Belgachhia Road, caught fire at 12.40 pm. Three fire engines rushed to the spot. In the other incident, a fire broke out on the ground floor of an abandoned building at 74/1, Topsia Road, opposite Don Bosco. Six fire engines brought the blaze under control.

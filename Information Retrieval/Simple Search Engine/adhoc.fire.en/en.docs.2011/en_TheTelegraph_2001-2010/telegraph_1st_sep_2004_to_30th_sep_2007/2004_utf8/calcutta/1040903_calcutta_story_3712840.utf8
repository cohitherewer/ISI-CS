 The wild and the beautiful

 Nature in itself is a storehouse of some of the most breathtakingly beautiful sights one can possibly imagine. There is perhaps very little imagery that can challenge the beauty and vitality of life that has a free reign in the folds of nature. And to be able to capture this natural unbridled magnificence on film is an art in itself. The ongoing exhibition of photographs on wildlife takes its audience on a spectacular journey through the wilderness that is the powerhouse of such activity that challenges and, perhaps, surpasses that of the human world in terms of its elegance and naturalness. The photographs have been taken by Biswajit Roy Chowdhury in places that range from the Sunderbans, Shantiniketan, Darjeeling and Mathura in the north to the Niligiris in the south. A visual treat for anyone with the aesthetics for wild beauty.

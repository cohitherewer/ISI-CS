The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Order of the Phoenix 

The wait?s over and The Village is coming to 

town. Releasing on Friday, the latest from M. Night Shyamalan is another winner 

of a spinechiller. While the director of Indian origin is working with most of 

the cast for the first time, he is repeating his Signs actor Joaquin Phoenix 

(picture left, with Mel Gibson and Shyamalan), who had earlier stunned audiences 

with his role in Gladiator. In The Village, Phoenix is part of the 

seemingly idyllic 19th century rural community, which is threatened by the mysterious 

creatures that live in the woods surrounding the village.

 It was working with Shyamalan again that got Phoenix hooked on to the project. ?We had developed a shorthand in Signs and that was able to come over into this. To be honest, there was also something intimidating about it. Part of what?s good about working with someone that you?ve never worked with before is they don?t know you and they are getting to know the character. After Signs, Night and I got to know each other a lot better so he was able to tell when I was bull-shitting much easier than before ? so that was a little intimidating.?

 For the film, Phoenix and the rest of the cast had to go through a 19th century boot camp, existing as a community but without any 21st Century luxuries. ?It was really just an opportunity for us to focus on the film, to not have any other distractions and to get to know each other really in character and to develop our relationships in character; which I think is really important. There are some actors who really embrace each part and try to lose themselves in the part. Then there are others who are on their phones all the time. So to get all of us actors together in an isolated environment was really beneficial,? says Phoenix.

 But it wasn?t as hunky-dory as it sounds. ?Yeah, we did a lot of hard stuff... ploughing the field and scything... that?s some work! No joke!? laughs Phoenix. ?Every muscle in your body hurts, and that I didn?t enjoy it at all. When I started a fire, I was there for 24 hours rubbing sticks together. Everyone else had gone to dinner. So, finally, I just got out my lighter and yelled, ?Fire!??

 His stoic Lucius Hunt was always written by Shyamalan with Phoenix in mind. ?When we were making Signs, I said to Night that I had always wanted to play a mute in a film. I wanted to know what it was like to have to convey a range of emotions without having much dialogue. So when I got the script, it was perfect. 

 ?With Night I always feel a great deal of pressure, because he knows his films so well. He knows his characters so well. You kind of get the sense that he could almost act the part better than you could. I know with Night that each story is so personal, and that he puts such a great deal of work into his screenplays. You feel this overwhelming need to succeed,? concludes Phoenix.

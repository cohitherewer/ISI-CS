 Human touch beats 12-yr stint at helm

 It was ?sheer hard work? on the ground and ?a human touch? that enabled the underdogs to turn the tables on the complacent favourites at the Punjabee Bradree elections, ringing in a change at the helm after a 12-year reign by the vanquished lobby.

 ?Change and transparency were what people in the (Punjabi) community were looking for. It was reflected in the unusually large turnout for Saturday?s polling,? said Kapil Katyal, who defeated A.D. Bhatia of the hitherto dominant Satish Kapoor camp by 95 votes to win the race for the Bradree president. Among the 2,700-odd members, 1,645 fetched up to cast their votes.

 The Katyal camp also sent 12 candidates to the 20-member executive committee and accounted for five of the seven members elected to the building standing committee, for which elections are held every four years. The president has the power to co-opt three members each to both the panels.

 ?Door-to-door canvassing, person-to-person contact and aggressive wooing of community members in the leather and motor parts trades helped us swing the momentum in our favour. We also benefited from the overconfidence in the rival camp,? said Vijay Malhotra, past president and senior member of the community who backed Katyal.

 The cry for a change of guard was audible in nearly every household they visited, confirmed Rajeev Kumar Mehta, chief election coordinator from the Katyal group. ?There was a lack of brotherhood and sections of the community felt neglected and left out,? Mehta said.

 Complacency was their bane, admitted Kapoor, another past president, who had been steering proceedings at the Bradree for more than a decade along with his group. But he refused to accept there was any elitism in the institution and any irregularity in their working.

 ?We had been winning almost uncontested for so long that maybe our candidates took things for granted and paid the price. However, our policy has always been inclusive and our goal, development and progress. We will work in tandem with the new president and his committee for the welfare of the community,? he said.

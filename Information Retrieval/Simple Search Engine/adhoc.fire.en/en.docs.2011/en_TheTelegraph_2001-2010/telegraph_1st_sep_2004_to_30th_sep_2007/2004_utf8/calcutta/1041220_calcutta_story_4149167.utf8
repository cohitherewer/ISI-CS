Basudeb Chowdhury: Can you cite a few examples of how we can be cheated in a deal?

 Well, there can be many examples from everyday life. 

 Many customers are not aware that a balance should be hung from a fixed support. We often come across hand-held scales, by which the weight of a product cannot be accurately measured. The next point to be kept in mind are the weights. Generally made of iron, the weights are to be checked once every two years. For a valid weight, one should check some code figures engraved on the underside. The year of manufacture and that of last verification are encoded at the beginning, followed by the quarter of the year when it was appraised. There is a code number after that, indicating the inspector who examined the weight. Thus, if any consumer inverts a weight, he or she can easily know whether it is still valid.

 Again, while buying imported garments, one must look for the size written in System Internationale (SI) units like meter or in CGS unit like centimetre. Mind you, simply writing XL or XXL is not legal. The shopkeeper should write the corresponding length in valid as well as popular units. 

 Besides, people frequenting bars should keep in mind that a peg measures 60 ml. 

 One last word of caution: no shopkeeper can charge you more than the maximum retail price printed on an article.

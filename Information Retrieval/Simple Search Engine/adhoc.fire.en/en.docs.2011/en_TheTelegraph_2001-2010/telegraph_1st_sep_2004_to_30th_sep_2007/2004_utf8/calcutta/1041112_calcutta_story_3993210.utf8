 Progress minus pitfalls

 Balancing the twin goals of bottomline and commitment to environment, Indian corporates are fast embracing the objective of sustainable development. 

 ?There may be a conflict between the two in the short term. But in the medium and long terms, business growth and sustainable development converge. It?s good to see that companies like Tisco and IOC have taken significant steps towards the goal of attaining ecological efficiency,? said Bertrand Collomb, chairman, Lafarge Group, Paris. 

 Collomb, also the chairman of World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), was in the city on Thursday. On a two-day visit to India, he also spoke at the Tata Energy Research Institute-organised seminar in Delhi on Wednesday. 

 According to him, Indian companies are fast joining their global counterparts in accepting sustainable development, which includes economic growth, ecological balance and social progress, as an important target to achieve. 

 ?We want more Indian businesses to join the movement,? said Collomb, who represents the organisation of 170 international companies. Coca Cola, AT amp;T and Shell are among the prominent members of the 13-year-old outfit. 

 The organisation has members from 35 countries and 20 major industrial sectors. Its network comprises 45 national and regional business councils and partner organisations in 40 countries. 

 With interest among Asian companies on sustainable development rising, the organisation is focusing on India and China and is also drawing up plans to act as a bridge between developing and developed nations to sort out differences on ecological issues. 

 Elaborating on the linkages between sustainable development and growth, Collomb gave the example of the two projects ? increasing employability of people in rural areas and offering low-cost housing to the poor ? that Lafarge has rolled out in this part of the country. 

 While the employability project is aimed at augmenting the skill-set of the masons and helping them in getting gainful employment, the low-cost housing is conceived as a mission to give the economically weaker section a chance to live in pucca houses. 

 ?Both these projects are not only helping people, but also broadening the market as we cannot sell cement if a large part of the population remains out of the market,? added Collomb, who launched Lafarge?s pilot project of ?affordable housing for the masses? in eastern India. 

 He handed over the key of the first house, set up at Chhotoganthipur in the Rajarhat area, to Father Mathew Parakonath, head of Don Bosco Ashalayam.

 Collomb, accompanied by Martin Kreigner, CEO of Lafarge India, and other senior officials also called on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the afternoon seeking the government?s support to popularise the low-cost housing concept.

 ?The success of such a project depends on involvement of all stakeholders ? with the government helping with land, the NGO identifying the people in need of such accommodation, the bank providing the finance and we chipping in with technology. The chief minister liked the idea and it is very encouraging,? he summed up, stressing that the company was committed to this part of the country.

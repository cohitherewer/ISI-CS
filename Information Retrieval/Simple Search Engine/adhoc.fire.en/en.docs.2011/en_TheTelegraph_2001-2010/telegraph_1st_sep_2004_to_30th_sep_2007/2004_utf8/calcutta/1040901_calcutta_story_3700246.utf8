The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Penalty cure for callous callers

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should members of the audience be penalised if their cell phones ring during a performance in an auditorium? 

 Till the cell rings: A scene from Kolkatar Elektra

Madhabi D. Ghosh, 

Salt Lake City 

 When Metro Railway authorities can slap a spot fine for spitting on the walls and littering, then why cant penalty be introduced for ringing cell phones in an auditorium?

Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 

 Barasat

 No matter how important a call is, it should be a pre-condition for sale of tickets to a performance that ticket-holders switch off their cellphones when they are in the auditorium. They have no right to disturb others during a show.

Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake City

 The best way to curb such disturbance is to impose a fine of Rs 50 as penalty for the offender. But this should only be implemented if anybody violates a warning notice issued or an announcement by the authorities of the hall.

Piyal Mukherjee,

 Lake Town

 Cell phones ringing in an auditorium distract a large section of the audience, and therefore are a nuisance. Why should others suffer for the callousness of a particular member of the audience?

Tariq Akhtar, 

 Free School Street

 Members of the audience should definitely be penalised if their cellphones ring during a performance in an auditorium. If they do not switch off their cellphones, they should at least set their gadgets in the vibrator or silent modes. 

Seemin Fatima, 

 Park Street

 Most auditoriums have notice boards or announcements before the programme, requesting members of the audience to switch off their cell phones. If someone does not pay heed to such a warning, he should be severely punished so that he never repeats the offence.

Biman Saha, 

 Lake Town

 The most important step in curbing this problem is to ban the entry of any one with cell phone or, by the use of jamming technology, make the operation of cell phones impossible inside the auditorium. People with cell phones should have the decency to switch off the gadget in a hall.

Santosh Chakravarty, 

 Unique Park

 Penalty can be imposed only if there is a specific law. Working cell phones in an auditorium are undesirable as they disturb others and are dangerous also from the security aspect. By way of penalty, the cell phone owner may be expelled from the show.

Sutapa Chakraborty, 

 Hooghly

 A fine of a few chips will well suit the pockets of those who can afford a ticket to a show and a cell phone. Once someone pays for his mischief, his conscience will be awakened. The best way to put a stop to this is to get the spectator out of the auditorium as soon as he is detected. 

Debi s. Chakraborty,

 Hooghly 

 The question here is not who is to bell the cat but whether to bell the cat at all. The real problem, therefore, is who will identify the cat. Obviously his neighbour. But will it not invite a lot of unwanted chaos and thus defeat the aim?

Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur

 It is an extremely painful experience for a music lover or a film-buff when his rapt attention gets disrupted by the ring of a cell phone in an auditorium. Members of the audience, guilty of such offence, should definitely be penalised 

Kanai Saha, 

 Gauribari Lane

 A ringing cell phone distracts the audience and causes a lapse in the concentration of the artistes as well. So, the audience should either switch off cell phones during a performance or set them in vibrator mode. If a particular member of the audience does not follow this, he should be penalised. 

Samir Chakraborty, 

 Ramrajatala

 Before a penalty is imposed on the audience, arrangements should be made by the authorities concerned so that automatically mobile connections stop working inside the auditorium or cell phones get set in the vibrator mode. 

Prasit Sen, 

 Hatiara

 Members of the audience should be asked to switch off their cellphones while entering an auditorium. If one does not switch his gadget off even after being requested, then he must be fined. 

Debarati Chakraborty, 

 Tollygunge

 The audience should be sensible enough to keep cell phones in silent or vibrator modes during a performance. But if they do not, penalty is a must. They should be asked to leave the auditorium. 

Biswajyoti Bagchi, 

 Alipore

 A penalty for such a crime might create more chaos. Authorities could display a Switch off your mobiles notice at the entrance or can arrange for the audience to deposit cell phones in a counter before the show.

Pitam De, 

Belgachhia

The use of cell phones should not be allowed inside an auditorium during a performance. 

The noise distracts the audience and performers alike and the ambience in the 

auditorium is shattered. Even urgent calls should be sacrificed. Non-compliance 

with an order may be liable for severe penalty. 

Indrani Negal, 

Narkeldanga

If a member of the auditorium disturbs the other spectators by using his cell 

phone inside an auditorium despite prior warning, then the cell phone owner should 

definitely be fined. 

Utpal Dutta, 

 Purba Sinthee Bye Lane

 Members of the audience should be penalised as they have no right to disturb the environment of the auditorium during a show. Every cell phone user has a moral duty of switching off his phone set during a performance 

Raffhat Mir,

McLeod Street

People who use cell phones during any performance 

lack a sense of decency. They should be punished for disturbing others and creating 

a nuisance in an auditorium. 

D Bhattacharyya, 

 Sonarpur

 If someones cell phone rings during a performance in an auditorium, the question of imposition of penalty will only arise if the cell phone owner violates a prior warning by the authorities. 

Vineet Bajoria, 

 Salt Lake City

 Members of the audience should not be penalised if their cell phones ring in an auditorium, for the gadget is an intrinsic part of life today. So, they should be requested to keep their gadgets on vibrating alert so they can stay in touch with the world without disturbing others.

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala

 If certain people are ready to pay a fine for cell phone use in the hall, others will still have to suffer. Arrangements should be made by the authorities for the gadgets to be left outside the hall. 

Prasanta Dutta, 

 Barrackpore

 Insensitive people, without any interest in the show, create much nuisance by using their cell phones inside the auditorium. Such members of the audience should definitely be penalised.

Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 

 Entally

 Spot fines or harassment of cell phone owners would be pushing the matter to extreme limits. Instead, all measures should be undertaken to prevent the occurrence of the problem. Warnings, written and verbal, might be a good step to start with.

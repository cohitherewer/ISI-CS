The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Starting at sundown

Pulling all-nighters is a new-age phenomenon 

with a unique set of challenges for worker and boss. 

Zeeshan Jawed finds out more

You leave for work when everybody is about to turn 

in. You creep back in at the crack of dawn. You aren?t likely to meet your family, 

as when the rest of them are headed out for the day, you are catching hard-earned 

forty-or-so winks.

This might not be your idea of a perfect job, but 

it has become the reality for countless people across the world. The BPO (business 

process outsourcing, just in case you have been napping the past few years) boom 

has turned time on its head for workers everywhere.

Call centres that handle global clients in different 

time zones have to work round the clock to meet demands. With Calcutta getting 

quite a bit of call traffic, young men and women ? and employers ? are still learning 

to cope with night shifts.

Share the load

Most BPOs make employees work in rotations, so everybody 

takes turns working at night. But there are call centres that hire only for the 

dark hours. ?We only hire people who are willing to work night shifts,? says a 

spokesperson for Vishnu Solutions on Camac Street.

Learn to cope

Most BPOs have a training plan in place to educate 

new entrants. Irregular timings can cause health and adjustment problems. Companies 

brief recruits on how to manage their day, so when they report to work, they can 

put in their best. Dealing with health and safety issues are high up on the agenda 

as is stress recognition and reduction.

Perks pay

Most companies which require employees to work nights 

provide transport to and from work. To counter the effects of sleep deprivation, 

work spaces are often done in vibrant colours. Recreational facilities, good lighting 

and ventilation are ensured on all shifts.

Dinner is usually provided by the company. ?Catering 

is outsourced and it is a vegetarian diet. The food has to be fit for consumption 

late at night,? says the Vishnu Solutions spokesperson. ?Whenever I stay in office 

at night, the company gives a dinner allowance,? explains Joydeep Bhowmik, a software 

professional with a leading IT major. Telecom players like Hutch and Airtel also 

have their own canteens.

Tick-tock

The midnight work culture is spreading. Entertainment 

industry professionals also keep late nights. Arijit Mondal and Srija Haldar are 

radio jockeys who present their show from midnight to 6 am.

While the live programme hardly leaves time for a 

cup of coffee, they are dropped off in the morning after hours, says a spokesperson 

for 106.2 Amar FM.

DJ Girish, who churns out music at Shisha Bar till 

the crack of dawn, has it better. ?I start out with dinner at The Grain of Salt. 

My drinks are on the house too,? he smiles. But nothing, he stresses, can be better 

than a good night?s sleep.

Always on call

If your work place is not well equipped, night shifts 

can be a real strain. However, if you are a medical professional, comfort is the 

last thing on the list. ?Medical officers are on call 24 hours. Skilled labour 

can?t easily be substituted,? explains Arpan Choudhari, a doctor at a city hospital. 

Holidays are few and socialising a distant dream.

It gives the words night life a completely different 

spin.

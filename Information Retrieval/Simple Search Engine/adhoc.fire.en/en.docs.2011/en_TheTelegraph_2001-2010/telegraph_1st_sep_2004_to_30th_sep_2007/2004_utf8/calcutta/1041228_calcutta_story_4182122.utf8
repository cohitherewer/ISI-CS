 Cops foil taxi hijack

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The plan was perfect, and so was the arrangement. But the attempt had to be aborted midway, leading to the arrest of three youths.

 Pankaj Roy, Guddu Roy and Alok Das were netted early on Monday while trying to hijack a taxi. The incident took place at Chetla around 3.30 am.

 Constables patrolling the area on bicycles rushed to the spot and saved the driver, who was crying out for help.

 This is the second instance in recent times when constables on bicycles have come in the way of crime. The earlier incident occurred near Rabindra Sarobar. 

 The three youths, according to Chetla police, were scanning the area in a Tata Sumo when they spotted the taxi near Chetla bridge, waiting for early-morning passengers. 

 They parked their vehicle close to the taxi. One of them stepped out and started bargaining with the driver over the fare for a trip.

 The other two then stepped out and aimed guns at the driver. One of them forced his way into the taxi, sat in the driver?s seat and wrested the keys to start the car.

 With not much visible in the early-morning fog, the youths evidently didn?t think that anyone would answer the driver?s cries for help. 

 Just as they were about to speed off, two constables appeared on bicycles. One of the cops stopped the cab, while the other informed the mobile patrol car. 

 An officer reached the spot from the police station and the three were arrested.

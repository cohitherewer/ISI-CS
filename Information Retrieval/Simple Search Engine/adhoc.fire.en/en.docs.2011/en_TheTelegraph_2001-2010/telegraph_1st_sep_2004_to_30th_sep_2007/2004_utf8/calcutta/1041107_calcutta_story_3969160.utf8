 Marine magic, up close

 CHANDANA

 After the Dolphin Show, my next 

 stop in Sri Lanka was the Underwater World, one of Asia?s 

 most popular oceanariums.

 It has more than 2,500 marine 

 animals of 250 species. It consists of huge glass tanks 

 full of marine life. Through the tanks run glass tubes carrying 

 conveyor belts, so you actually find yourself walking beneath 

 rays, moray eels, sharks, swordfish, dugongs, starfish and 

 loads of other species. In separate sections are tanks containing 

 jellyfish and pufferfish (some of it is pretty creepy!).

 Underwater world plays an important 

 role in education and marine conservation. For example, 

 the blacktip and whitetip sharks, and big-belly seahorses 

 breed quite naturally here, indicating how comfortable they 

 are with their environment. Other attractions at the under 

 water world are:

 Polar bears: An underwater viewing 

 exhibit, 2.4 m high, allows visitors to rub noses with these 

 magnificent inhabitants of the arctic regions.

 Sea lions and penguins: Consisting 

 of 10 glass panels, this is one of the longest viewing galleries 

 in the world, with a simulated beach and on elevated rock 

 ledges.

 Crocodiles and false ghavials: 

 Awe-inspiring creatures in a mangrove-like habitat, plus 

 a crocodile nursery.

 Pygmy hippopotamus: A walk through 

 a meandering river path to meet pygmy hippos, face to face.

 By the end of it, I felt like 

 I was returning from a voyage to the bottom of the Sea.

 Alarm over cardiac count

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The alarm bells have been sounded: India is now home to more than 45 million patients of coronary artery diseases and by 2020, it will have the dubious distinction of having the maximum number of cardiac patients. 

 ?We?re very concerned at the general ignorance of the importance of lifestyle modification and regular check-ups,? said Imad Sheiban, director of Interventional Cardiology at the University of Turin, Italy. He was speaking at an international workshop on coronary angioplasty.

 The workshop was organised to mark the inauguration of the state-of-the-art Integris Allura Flat Detector Cath Lab, the first of its kind in eastern India, at Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Centre on Monday.

 ?This Cath Lab will enable us to perform difficult angioplasty procedures with precision,? said A.L. Dutta, head of cardiology at the hospital. It will ensure immensely-superior images with lesser dosage of radiation on the patient.

 ?The Lab is much better than the digital Cath Lab now in vogue in most centres in the country. It does not require the patient to be moved in different directions while taking images,? said Dutta.

 The hospital has started radial angioplasty, that involves carrying out the procedure by using the radial artery (in the arm) for the catheter, instead of the conventional method which uses the femoral artery.

 ?In case of radial angioplasty, the patient can walk and go home within four hours of the procedure, instead of staying at the hospital for a few days,? said Shubhanan Roy, interventional cardiologist at Peerless Hospital. 

 In course of the workshop, five live angioplasties were conducted in the presence of Imad Sheiban and cardiac experts at the hospital. The procedures were directly broadcast to over 150 cardiologists who had gathered at a city hotel. 

 The symposium, according to Peerless Hospital vice-president Rupak Barua, was aimed at providing a platform with international faculty for sharing views on complications of coronary angioplasty. 

 ?We?re planning to organise later this year a mega-conference on neurosciences, another branch of medicine we specialise in, apart from orthopaedics and cardiology,? Barua added.

 ?Such workshops will help us improve the knowledge base considerably,? Sheiban said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buy, buy is the Christmas buzz

 - Sales shoot past 2003 figures in every segment, in every shoppers? stop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Home-grown or imported, budget or beyond, food or fashion, it?s buy-buy time this Christmas. With the winter festive fortnight emerging as the second biggest window of shopping opportunity in town after the autumnal craze, the look has just got brighter and the stakes have risen higher this December.

 Leading the charge is the child brigade. Emami Landmark has reported brisk movement in the toy segment ? from soft toys to activity dolls, imported board games like Risk and Taboo to tricycles and Digimon characters. 

 ?If it was Pokemon last year, Digimon is the top draw this time,? says CEO Gautam Jatia, reporting a 10 per cent sales growth from the corresponding period last year.

 Christmas-specific shopping, like Santas and antelopes, Christmas trees and decoration items, are also big. ?This year, we are concentrating on imported Christmas trees, ranging from Rs 500 to 5,000. These are washable and can be preserved for four to five years,? adds Jatia.

 At Crossword, toys make up 25 per cent of sales now. ?Books and music also move well, as people love to enjoy these few days with friends and family,? says Sidharth Pansari.

 Far from the swank new-age stores, the traditional haunt of the Christmas shopper ? New Market?s gol ghar ? has limped back to life this week. Stuffed Santas, streamers of different hues, Spiderman masks, balloons and candles line the corridors around the canon and the faithful still drop in for festive finery at the beleaguered 135-year-old marketplace.

 New Market may have lost its sheen, but the Calcutta consumer is all decked up at this time of year. As far as the look of the season goes, women?s western wear is the watchword. ?In winter wear, the leaning is towards designer jackets rather than pullovers,? says Suresh Sadhwani, store manager of Pantaloons at 22 Camac Street, selling men?s jackets and pullovers worth more than Rs 1 lakh every day.

 Striped trousers are also very much in vogue, as are party shirts, techno-fabric suits and blazers. ?Our F-trousers with L-shaped, diagonal or zippo pockets are also going great guns,? adds Sadhwani, targeting a 17 to 18 per cent growth over Christmas 2003.

 High-collar T-shirts, turn-up and slim jeans (with Bipasha Basu playing style icon), light woollens and jackets in floral colours are in, according to Madhusudan Binani, a leading retailer. 

 The only cause of concern: Christmas is here minus the chill factor, leaving heavy woollens cold.

 Also moving well are men?s fashion jewellery, like bangles, necklaces, armbands and knick-knacks, ladies? belts supporting denims and western-style leather bags. At Westside, children?s wear is also a big hit, according to store head Amit Dharap.

 Fashion accessories for women are ruling the racks at Nik Nish, a popular gift-shop chain around town, this month. ?We have witnessed a rise of 20 per cent in women?s fashion jewellery over last year,? says Ankit Kedia of Nik Nish, picking women?s belts and bags, perfumes and fancy stationery as the other bestsellers.

 Card shops, too, have witnessed a significant rise in sales. Says Manish Manpuria of Archies Gallery in Forum, the company?s flagship store in the city. ?There has been a 15 per cent growth in the sale of cards this year.? 

 While corporate buying is skewed towards the HelpAge and CRY variety, personal buying is still largely dependent on the personalised straight-from-the-heart missive.

 Topping it all off is the dessert platter. At Kookie Jar, the overall sale of confectioneries for Christmas this year has risen 25 per cent over 2003, says proprietor Lovey Burman, spotting a spurt in the sale of non-traditional Christmas confectioneries. ?For instance, truffle cakes with strawberry is more popular than, say, the plum cake,? she adds.

 On Day Two of the Flury?s comeback, the Park Street address drew in ?around 1,000 people?. Despite the revamped interiors and the refurbished menu, old favourites like the rum ball, chocolate boat and plum cakes sold the swiftest on Thursday.

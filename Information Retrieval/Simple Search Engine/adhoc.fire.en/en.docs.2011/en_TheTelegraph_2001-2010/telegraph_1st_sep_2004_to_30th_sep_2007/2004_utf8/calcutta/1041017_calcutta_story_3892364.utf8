The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Enter, hospitality hub

 The Camac Street hotel 

 Just a shout away from shopping malls, multiplexes and restaurants comes Calcutta?s latest business hotel ? The Senator.

 Located next to the British Council on Camac Street, the 10-storeyed 60-room hotel has been put in place by jewellery giant P. C. Chandra Group.

 The Senator, which is now fully functional, has one multi-cuisine restaurant, a bar and two banquet halls. The room prices start from around Rs 3,000.

 Present at the inauguration of the hotel on Saturday evening were chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

 Encouraging such new ventures and lauding the group?s diversification into the hospitality sector, the chief minister said: ?New business hotels like this will serve the purpose of the current industrial scenario of our state, which is growing all the time.?

 Crowning two-star and three-star budget stops the future of the hotel industry in this part of the country, Bhattacharjee added: ?Even the Taj group is coming up with three three-star hotels in Siliguri, Haldia and Calcutta. Then, there are many foreign companies who have shown interest in setting up three-star hotels here. I am trying my best to allot them land.?

 The mayor, too, was happy with the coming up of The Senator. ?We need more hotels like this. At one point of time there was a question mark whether this hotel would be ready at all but with a little bit of help and support, it has been possible.?

 Referring to the 15 Camac Street construction as ?just a stepping stone?, P.C. Chandra group director Arun Chandra said: ?Now that this dream has been achieved we will go to the districts and set up our own business hotels.?

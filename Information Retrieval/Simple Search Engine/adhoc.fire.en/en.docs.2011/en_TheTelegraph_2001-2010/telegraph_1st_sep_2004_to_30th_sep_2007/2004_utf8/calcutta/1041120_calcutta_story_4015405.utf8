The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 There is a very logical reason for the increasing number of birds at the airport, 

posing a threat to aircraft while take off and landing. The number of meat shops 

has multiplied in the area surrounding the airport. The birds throng the vicinity 

in search of foodscraps in the form of the pieces of meat that the shops dump 

on the roadside. There should be a proper system in place for disposing of carcasses 

and other waste near the airport. NGOs should also raise the issue.

 Most letterboxes are situated in the open. During monsoon, water can be seen 

to trickle into the box and damage the mail. The letters also get wet when the 

postmen take them out of the letterbox during rain. Thus, addresses written in 

ink often get smudged. In fact, even the postal staff have a hard time saving 

the letters from getting wet. To overcome this problem, postal authorities should 

either construct a shed over the letterbox or place it inside the post office.

 I would like to draw the attention of the authorities towards the tram cars 

running from Shyambazar, Bagbazar and Belgachhia depots, via Chitpur Road to BBD 

Bag. These are some of the oldest tram routes in Calcutta and cover CMC wards 

6, 9, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25, 41, 42, 44 and 45. Nowadays, these trams run almost 

empty except during office hours because the routes do not terminate at Esplanade. 

Plenty of commuters would prefer if it had been so. Can half the number of trams 

on this route be permitted to ply till the Esplanade depot via BBD Bag? This will 

not require laying of new tracks either.

 All big hospitals have put up signboards alerting drivers that it is a silence 

zone. But seldom do motorists realise the discomfort to the patients in the hospital 

ans merrily go on honking. Traffic sergeants are often seen booking motorists 

for petty offences outside big hospitals but never have I seen someone being penalised 

for unnecessarily blowing the horn.

 Govind Das Dujari, Diamond Harbour Road. 

 Barrackpore Trunk Road has become a commuter?s nightmare. The stretch between 

Chiriamore and Tobin Road takes a minimum of half-an-hour to cross. There are 

huge potholes, a dug-up divider and two very scary crossings. Immediate repairs 

are a must to prevent major accidents on the stretch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rosters of relief and rigour

 - Cops in Mumbai breathe easy, no respite for city force

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA AND KINSUK BASU

 After the Diwali lights die out, the Mumbai policeman will take in a deep breath ? and breathe out. For Saturday ends the hectic season for the 39,000 men in uniform who have barely been able to catch their breath between the Assembly elections, Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri, the fair at St Mary?s Church and Diwali.

 No such luck for his Calcutta counterpart. If Durga puja pushed the 22,000-strong force to the brink and beyond in October, this November is turning out to be anything but nice. As the first signs of winter set in, a chaotic calendar of cricket, films, festivities and bandhs unfolds for Calcutta Police.

 A film festival is already on in multiple venues. Kali puja and Diwali are being celebrated on two successive nights. Id is round the corner. Eden Gardens hosts a high-voltage One-Day-International between India and Pakistan this Saturday while the Test with South Africa is lined up for November 28. Two bandhs spice up the police bandobast ? SUCI on November 17 and CPI-ML on November 23.

 By the Arabian Sea, a new police commissioner, A.N. Roy, has unleashed a regime of management training. He has hired Switzerland-based training firm Mercury Goldmann that conducts personnel training across the world, desi management guru R.K. Pandya and several other pros to help prop up the force. At the police headquarters near Crawford Market, the new mantra is corporatisation, personal skills, and better dealing with the public. The idea behind the training is to remind the public and the personnel that policing is a form of service.

 Back by the Bay of Bengal, outgoing police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty is striving to motivate his force to face the month?s challenges, advocating similar virtues of public relations and event management. At a meeting with his core team on Wednesday afternoon at Lalbazar, he called upon the 25 officers to preserve the city?s ?glorious? heritage and urged them to put their best foot forward.

 Officially, the briefing was for Saturday?s cricket clash. But it stepped beyond the Eden boundaries, into specific roles and larger responsibilities. ?I have told the officers that one should be courteous but firm while dealing with such events, particularly ones that have an international implication. All their moves would be watched around the world,? Chakraborty said.

 The pep talk from the top cop comes close on the heels of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s pat for his force: ?There are a number of events (in November) but I am sure you will be able to handle it.?

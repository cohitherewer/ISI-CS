 Plan for Howrah wards

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) has decided to treat the five wards in the added areas in the same way it does the 45 others from April 2005. The term ?added area? will be abolished.

 According to mayor-in-council member Debashish Chakraborty, the five wards in the added areas will benefit from the decision because from April onwards they will be treated at par with central Howrah. The development of the otherwise backward wards, he claimed, will be accelerated. 

 For the past two decades, the added areas have not seen any development. The roads and the drainage system are in a shambles. There are no street lights and the roads have no names. Houses are not known by their addresses. These five wards were under panchayats two decades ago, and were merged with the HMC in 1984. But the inclusion was only on paper, for the area remained a backwater.

 ?We have chalked out a new tax structure for all the 50 wards and this will be implemented from April next year,? Chakraborty said. Better civic amenities will be introduced. ?The roads will be named and the houses will have addresses,? he added. 

 ?We have held meetings to make the proposed tax structure transparent,? said Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee.

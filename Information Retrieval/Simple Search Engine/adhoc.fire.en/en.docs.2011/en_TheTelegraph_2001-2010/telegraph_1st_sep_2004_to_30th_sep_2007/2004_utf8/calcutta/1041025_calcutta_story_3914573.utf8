 Courage has four faces

 The ordinary life of ordinary people is commonplace, monotonous and apparently inconsequential. Their joys and sorrows, their hopes, fears and frustrations are all very familiar to us. Yet there comes a time in everyone?s life when they can rise above their mundane existence to prove their true worth to themselves and to those who exploit them, knowing them to be weak and defenceless. Gandhar?s Char Duar, which narrates the courageous saga of a mother and her three daughters, shows how the resolute struggle of the foursome to take up cudgels against insurmountable odds, puts them on a moral plane where each individual?s effort becomes heroic, universal and immortal. Based on a Marathi play by Prashant Dalvi, the play, edited and directed by Meghnad Bhattacharya, has remarkable performances by Bijoylakshmi Barman, Meghna Lahiri and Mandira Bandopadhyay among others.

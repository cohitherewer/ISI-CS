 Timelessness of art

 A thing of beauty is a joy forever. This saying is specially true of art, whose timeless beauty has the eternal power to give pleasure to our aesthetic senses. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by Kazi Nasir pays tribute to this everlasting quality of art, and its ability to freeze beauty in time forever. The works on show, mainly done in acrylic on canvas, represent feminine forms in a state of repose. Mellowness of mood and a dignified serenity and thoughtfulness characterise his figures. What makes Nasir?s paintings remarkable is that despite great attention to detail, his works have a delicate, dream-like quality.

 Event: Exhibition of paintings by Kazi Nasir

 When: Till November 21; 4 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Birla Academy of Art and Culture, 2nd floor, B wing

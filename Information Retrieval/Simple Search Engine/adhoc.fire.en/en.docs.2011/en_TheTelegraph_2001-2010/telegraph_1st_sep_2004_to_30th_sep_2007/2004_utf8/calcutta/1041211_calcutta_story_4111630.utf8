The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cess, tax brakes on green fuel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The switchover to the green fuel has hit rough weather in the city following the hike in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from December 1.

 Auto LPG now costs Rs 26.56 a litre, a jump of almost 25 per cent from the previous price of Rs 21.80. 

 Traders engaged in selling and fitting LPG kits feel the hike will lead to a decline in the number of vehicles opting for conversion to the green fuel. ?The central rules don?t make it mandatory for a vehicle-owner to switch over to LPG,? pointed out J. Khara, an LPG kits dealer in south Calcutta.

 ?We are encouraging car-owners to opt for the green fuel because it is eco-friendly and costs much less than petrol. Many people had responded and were ready to invest Rs 25,000 for the kits. But the price hike, we fear, will turn off prospective customers,? he added.

 According to Beni Das, an LPG dealer in north Calcutta, post-hike LPG may still be a lot cheaper than petrol, but customers, always eyeing maximum benefit, will think twice before opting the conversion. 

 Several car-owners rushed for the conversion last year, when the Bharat Stage II case was being heard in the high court. Owners of old cars opted for the green fuel to prevent their vehicles from being scrapped. The flow ebbed after the Centre introduced a set of rules on emission standard. 

 So far, nearly 300 cars and 700 three-wheelers have switched to LPG. 

 ?The switchover picked up in the past two months, recording 30 vehicles daily. Now, merely 10 or 15 vehicles turn up for the conversion,? an LPG dealer informed Metro. 

 ?If the price is not rolled back, the drive to reduce auto emission will fall flat,? he warned. 

 Environmentalists are of the firm opinion that the government should reduce sales tax (17 per cent) on auto LPG and withdraw the cess (Re 1 per litre). 

 ?The government has failed to curb auto emission. It should now sacrifice some of its revenue by reducing the sales tax and cess,? said automobile expert S.M. Ghosh.

 LPG kit dealers will submit a memorandum to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty to the effect.

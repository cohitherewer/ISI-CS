The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Previously, on entering Metro stations, pleasant Rabindrasangeet on the public 

address system used to soothe frayed nerves. But of late, not only are most of 

the Bengali numbers being replaced by raunchy Hindi film songs, but passengers 

are greeted by lewd music videos on the TV screens. In a way, the cultural capital 

is being plagued by these obscenities. Cultural pollution such as this has the 

potential to cause irreparable damage to the moral fabric of our society in the 

long run. 

 Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur. 

 We are committed to the cause of promoting art and culture. Our feed on the 

Metro station television acts as a platform for promising singers. It is wrong 

to say that only new Hindi film songs are played. Since there are commuters of 

all backgrounds travelling on the Metro, our programmes, spread over 14 hours 

of the day, have to be varied as well. Other than Hindi and Bengali songs, we 

beam Charlie Chaplin and Laurel amp; Hardy films, sports and wildlife features. 

We also pick clippings of vintage Bengali films ? romantic moments from Uttam-Suchitra 

starrers, Bhanu-Jahar comic interludes and the like. Last month, we were experimenting 

by telecasting Bengali programmes during the peak hours and keeping the other 

programmes for the rest of the day. Since commuters are missing Bengali programmes, 

we will spread them through the day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Katwalk to catcalls

 Party hopping

 The Hi Street Fashion show at 

 Tantra on Friday night was far more fun than was expected. 

 Models walked the bar-tops in Narendra Kumar?s designs to 

 the cheers and whistles of the jam-packed crowd. While most 

 had come simply to catch a glimpse of the gorgeous Katrina 

 Kaif, it was hottie Upen Patel who finally stole the show.

 Katrina, though looking her usual 

 beautiful self, seemed rather bland on the ramp and while 

 her first blink-and-you-miss appearance won its fair share 

 of catcalls, the second round was more subdued.

 Upen, on the other hand, unleashed 

 fun and frenzy on the otherwise serious show with an impromptu 

 performance. Dancing and singing on the ramp to fast-paced 

 tracks, he wooed the woman brigade, drooling over every 

 move and desperately seeking the next.

 The men had this semi-stunned 

 expression, especially when the male models began taking 

 off their shirts. The women, of course, were not complaining.

 The designs being showcased were 

 quite different from what you usually get to see these days. 

 Kumar?s experimentation with different cuts was quite novel. 

 In the below-the-navel department, the women sported colourful 

 capris and stylised black patent-leather shoes. The dresses 

 and kurtis had little embellishments but lots of 

 style. The saris were also classy in earthy hues and with 

 embroidery only on the edges. The men?s wear was simply 

 outstanding. Trousers and jackets in standard greys, whites, 

 blues and browns were cut and styled to near perfection. 

 All the clothes were priced upwards of Rs 3,500.

 ?Coming to this nightclub in Calcutta, 

 I?ve realised that the market here is pretty big and there 

 is a lot of scope for tapping it. My clothes are tailored 

 for the trendy, hip crowd,? says the designer. With two 

 days in hand, he intends to scout stores in the city where 

 he can retail his clothes.

 Fashion through 50 years 

 Inner Wheel club 

 members at the show 

 The party pattern in Calcutta 

 seems to be changing with every passing night. Each weekend 

 witnesses new trends making their way into party hubs.

 If the stage is not being set 

 on fire by an ?item bomb? from Bollywood, some belle with 

 a belly to die for is busy moving to the thumping beats 

 of the table turner.

 But Friday saw a party-cum-fashion 

 show of a different nature at the Hyatt Regency. The Inner 

 Wheel Club of Central Calcutta organised Flashback, a saga 

 of Indian fashion over the past five decades, to mark a 

 half-century. ?As we celebrate 50 years of Inner Wheel in 

 India, we also celebrate womanhood keeping in mind the basic 

 essence of our club,? said Smita Murarka, president of the 

 club where membership is only open to women.

 The fashion show that ensued can 

 be best termed as an event for the members, of the members 

 and by the members. Strutting the stage were not city celebs 

 or professional models but the members of the club.

 Dressed in clothes depicting the 

 fashion trends in Bollywood through 50 years, the amateurs 

 displayed amazing poise on the ramp, drawing cheers and 

 applause from family and friends.

 ?Making somebody face the spotlight 

 for the first time is not an easy task. We practised for 

 one whole week and the result has been fairly good,? said 

 Priyanka Choudhury, choreographer for the the show

 It?s all in the groove 

 game

 Sales targets went for a toss 

 and client presentations took a backseat as Calcutta?s leading 

 corporates set out to achieve targets of a different kind 

 ? that of winning the prestigious Third Corporate and Club 

 Indoor Cricket Tournament presented by The Telegraph 

 at the Space Circle Club. The results were declared at a 

 party on Friday night. The indoor cricket stadium that had 

 till days before been the place for serious competition 

 was converted into a hub of fun as DJs played, bands sang 

 and VJs distributed prizes and screamed their lungs out. 

 The formal prize distribution 

 ceremony over, (SP Yarns took the Main Plate Winners Award 

 and Coal India emerged the Main Plate Runners Up, The Loser?s 

 Plate went to PricewaterhouseCoopers while Vedic Village 

 bagged the Loser?s Plate Runners-Up trophy, Pioneer Polyfeb 

 won the Bowl while Grasim Industries Limited was the runners-up 

 in this section), it was time to up the glasses and hit 

 the dance floor. 

 As city band Fifth Dimension belted 

 out covers of KK to Enrique, the first ones to hit the dance 

 floor were some young enthusiasts. ?For their great spirit 

 they take home some Channel V goodies,? declared VJ Kim 

 (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya) who?d flown down to emcee 

 the event. Sporting a bandanna, cool denim capris and a 

 pink tube top, she got into the fun mode immediately. Once 

 DJ Sachin took over the console with a mix of remixes and 

 hip hop, there was no reason for anyone to hold on to their 

 seats.

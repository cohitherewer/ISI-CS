 Retrospective of German films

 The contribution of German films to the art of filmmaking is indeed enormous. The films of Herbert Achternbusch, one of Germanys greatest and most prolific filmmakers of all time, are the works of a storyteller; they have their own grammar and idiom and are infused with the directors own idea of realism. They are unconventional in every sense, but what makes his films remarkable are Achternbuschs cinematic vision, his eye for detail and the fact that his films are technically perfect. The ongoing retrospective of his films, being jointly hosted by Goethe-Institut and Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, is an opportunity for the city audience to experience the sheer precision, artistry and skills of this movie-making genius. To be screened this week: She?s an Olympic Winner (September 20), Heal Hitler! (picture above; September 21) and I Know the Way to Hofbrauhaus (September 23).

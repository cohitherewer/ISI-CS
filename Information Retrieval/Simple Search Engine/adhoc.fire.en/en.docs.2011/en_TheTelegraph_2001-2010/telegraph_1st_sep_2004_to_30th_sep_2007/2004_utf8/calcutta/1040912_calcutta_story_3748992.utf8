 Feminine funk in focus

 ?I wanted the audience to be happy after seeing my show ? the idea was to give them a chance to have some good fun. And I think the show had a bindaas feel to it that they really enjoyed,? said Ritu Kumar, minutes after holding the packed ballroom at the Taj Bengal in complete awe on Friday evening. The designer unveiled her Winter Collection 2004 with a show that the city will remember for quite some time.

 Ritu?s clothes have always been known to epitomise elegance and sophistication. But on Friday she lent a new dimension to this image by marrying the bindaas with the elegant and the funky with the feminine. The show was divided into three sections, with supporting audio-visuals running in the background throughout.

 It opened with the classic couture line comprising her signature bridal lehngas and saris. From soft pastels and neutrals like copper and bronze to brighter hues of fuschia, red, purple, orange and blue, the bridal story unfolded almost like a dream. 

Soon there was a transition from couture to pret. 

Stretch lycra T-shirts depicting patterns and colours of nature were teamed up 

with pants and skirts, both crushed and short layered.

 The finale was in two parts. The first line, inspired by the banjaras of Rajasthan, had ghagras and salwar suits with an essentially folk flavour. The second part moved on to the costumes of Flamenco dancers in red and black. 

 The romance of Ritu?s crushed skirts, that had rocked the ramp at the Lakme India Fashion Week earlier in the year, ran circles round the whole show, with all the three sections being bound by this common thread.

 The music went a long way in conveying the mood of every collection. So, while the bridal sequences were accompanied by strains of Chalte chalte? from Pakeezah and some Sufi music, the pret line was pepped up by numbers like Chadti jawani and Ina mina dika.

 The first part of the finale had folk music playing in the background that slowly moved on to typical Flamenco tracks. ?The music was totally my type, the old classics and Sufi tracks that were played are my favourites. I am not at all fond of trance and the fusion kind of music that is played in every show these days, so I asked the choreographer to steer clear of them,? said Ritu.

 The designs were flaunted on the ramp by some of the top cat-walkers of the country, including Tapur and Tupur Chatterjee, Sayali Bhagat, Sunalika Sahay, Vidisha Pavate, Nina Manuel, Fleur Xavier, Carol Gracias, Bhawna Sharma, Tinu Verghese, Sapna Kumar, Michelle Innes, Laxmi Rana and Krishna Somani.

on Saturday 

 A trip down SPE lane

 Ten glorious years captured in one grand book. Someplace Else Forever is your guide to Calcutta?s most happening musical haunt over the last decade. 

 The sleek coffee-table book was launched at The Park pub on Saturday evening. Apart from all the bands who perform every week at Someplace Else (SPE), those present included percussionists Bikram Ghosh and Tanmoy Bose, actors Victor Banerjee and Arindam Sil and representatives from the counsulates.

 After the formal unveiling of the book, Victor made sure that his copy had autographs from all the bands present. Bikram was very happy that the decade-long musical journey has been recorded for posterity. ?After the roaring 60s and 70s, there was no place on Park Street that played live music. SPE brought live music back to the city. It is the only place in Calcutta where you get to listen to all types of music,? he said.

 Veteran musician Nondon Bagchi, who has penned the preface of the book, was happy with the way it has shaped up. ?The place started with recorded music as a disco. Then, when we started playing, it was just live music. And now it is a good balance of both.? Musician Neel Adhikary, who plays at SPE every week, summed it up: ?Everyone who has been to SPE would love to own a copy of this book.? 

 Priced at Rs 725, the book will be available at the Oxford Bookstore from September 15.

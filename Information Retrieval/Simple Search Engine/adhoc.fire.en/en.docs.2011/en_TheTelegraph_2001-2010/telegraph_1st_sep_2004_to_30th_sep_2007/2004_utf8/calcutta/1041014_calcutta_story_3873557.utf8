 Malaria, extensive amp; invincible

 - Drug resistance vexes doctors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The sting?s changing, both in sharpness and habitat.

 After lying low for a brief spell, the malarial parasite has returned to the city with a vengeance, taking under its wing areas that were not ?endemic? even a few years ago, and leaving behind an army of drug-resistant patients.

 Given the changing nature of the malaria-prone zones and the sharp rise in the number of the parasite?s hosts, entomologists fear Calcutta could turn out to be the perennial breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

 The experts point to the new housing estates, that boast of advanced sewerage systems. These will foster growth of the anopheles mosquito on their damp underground walls, and cases of malaria are bound to shoot up, they fear.

 A considerable section of the population has shifted from the endemic zones to other areas, so the critical density of patients susceptible to the disease is changing. 

 ?People are shifting base, carrying with them the parasite in their blood. This will lead to an increase in the parasite pool,? pointed out Dr Amitava Nandy of the School of Tropical Medicine (STM). 

 This year, though there have been fewer deaths, figures with the STM?s malaria clinic, coupled with those from various government hospitals, reveal that the incidence of the disease across the city has shot up several-fold.

 Besides the endemic zones of Bhowanipore, Kalighat, Hazra, Colootola, Bowbazar, College Street and Sealdah, a large number of cases were reported from Ekbalpore, Mominpore, Garden Reach, Dum Dum, Beleghata and the Lake Town-Baguiati belt.

 Experts admit the spread of the parasite is following a cyclical pattern of crest and trough, but maintain the spurt in the number of cases is a pointer to the fact that a section of the population is developing immunity against malaria. 

 But the crisis is not just in terms of figures or shift of endemic zones. For doctors treating patients at the outdoor departments of government hospitals, it?s a question of which drug to administer.

 With a section of scientists raising questions on choloroquine and cases of drug resistance being on the rise, a large section of doctors here are at a loss for an alternative. 

 ?There is no denying that falciparum drug-resistant cases are on the rise. But even today, choloroquine remains the best medicine. There are the next group of medicines, like sulphodoximine and artermesin, besides the age-old quinine,? said Dr Sudarshan Chakrabarty of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. 

 ?But one has to keep in mind the cost and the affordability of the class turning up at government hospitals,? he added. 

 This may be the reality, but the World Health Organisation (WHO) believes in a different kind of treatment. ?The WHO claims that in case of R-I resistant cases (there are two other categories, R-II and R-III, depending upon the level of drug resistance), the drug should be changed immediately. But its not possible here,? Dr Chakrabarty said. 

 Others point out that across Asia, including in China and Indonesia, the WHO directive on drug resistance and use of new drugs has few takers.

 Fund flow for medical waste war

 JAYANTA BASU

 The days of stinking garbage greeting a visitor to a government hospital may finally come to an end. 

 The finance department has released funds for treatment of biomedical waste generated at the 30-odd government hospitals and other medical institutions in the city.

 A recent letter (memo no. HF/N/MS/290/W-128/04, dated October 11, 2004), issued by the joint secretary of the health department to the director of health service and director of medical education, states: ?The governor has been pleased to accord sanction and release of Rs 15,120,261 in connection with meeting the charge of collection of biomedical waste of state hospitals and blood banks by M/S Medicare Incin Private Ltd.? 

 Medicare, a private agency, had set up a biomedical waste treatment centre in Howrah with the state pollution control board?s support in November last year. 

 Though several government hospitals are using the facility, the government has not been regular in releasing funds.

 ?Around Rs 60 lakh is due from government hospitals. The problem, however, has been sorted out with the notification,? said Medicare?s S.R. Choudhury.

 The decision has been welcomed by the hospitals, too. ?The financial clearance will definitely boost our efforts in proper management of biomedical waste,? said Nityananda Mondal, secretary of National Medical College.

 Apart from general hospitals, the notification applies to homoeopathic and ayurvedic hospitals and blood banks. 

 For collection and treatment of biomedical waste, a hospital will have to make a daily payment of Rs 2.40 per bed to the agency. 

 Medicare is currently engaged in handling the waste of around 28,000 beds of Calcutta and Howrah hospitals. 

 ?The waste treatment facility is being used by most hospitals, except those run by police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation,? informed a Medicare representative.

 Reacting to the notification, a pollution control board official said: ?It has been a very important development for the overall success of biomedical waste management in the state.?

 ?If the programme had fizzled out for lack of adequate funds from the government, the result could have been disastrous,? the official added.

 Puja fee sets off skirmish

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Seven persons were seriously injured in a clash, allegedly between Trinamul Congress and CPM supporters, in the Baghberia area of Baruipur, on Wednesday morning. 

 Four members of a local club were later arrested on charges of fomenting violence. The club was allegedly extorting Puja subscription. 

 A picket was posted in Baghberia as a precautionary measure. 

 Police sources said trouble broke out when members of Yubak Sangha, allegedly under the patronage of local Trinamul leaders, raided the residence of a member of the DYFI (South 24-Parganas), the youth wing of the CPM, after he refused to pay Rs 5,000 as subscription for the local puja.

 Speaking on condition of anonymity, local residents said the club members ransacked the house of Bivash Pradhan and also beat up his parents mercilessly. Sachikanta Pradhan, Bivash?s father, was admitted to Baruipur hospital with serious injuries.

 ?Soon, people from the local CPM party office rushed to the spot and started beating up the club?s members. Panic spread in the area as the two groups clashed with bhojalis and lathis. Six persons sustained serious injuries,? the eyewitnesses said.

 A local resident added that after one-and-a-half hours, a contingent from Baruipur police station reached the spot and arrested four members of Yubak Sangha.

 Local Trinamul leaders, however, said the tussle between the club members and the CPM supporters had started when the latter tried catching fish in a pond owned by a club member. 

 ?None of our people were involved in the incident. It was merely a clash between the local residents and CPM supporters,? said Trinamul leader Sukumar Mondal. 

 The CPM unit had a different tale to tell altogether. Its activists said the club members, controlled by the Trinamul, had taken away Rabindranath Pradhan, brother of Bivash, and confined him in a room on the club premises. 

 Rabindranath was rescued by them after breaking open the door, they added.

 Members of Yubak Sangha were not available for comment. 

 ?We have asked officers-in-charge of the police stations to keep a vigil so that citizens are not harassed by Puja organisers,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas. 

 Gupta declined to say if the clash was political.

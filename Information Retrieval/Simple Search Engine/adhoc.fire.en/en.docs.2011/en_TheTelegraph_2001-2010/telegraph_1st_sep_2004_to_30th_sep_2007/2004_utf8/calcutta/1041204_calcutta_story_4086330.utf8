 Tolerating little foibles

 Imitating Western modes of habit and lifestyle has been a persisting malady among generations of Indians, right from the pre-Independence era to the present day. Rabindranath Tagores play, Shodh-Bodh, satirically draws attention to this disturbing affliction, at the same time pointing out the utter folly and absurdity of imitating a Western way of life. Anya Theatre?s production of this farcical comedy deals with the ups and downs in the romantic fortunes of Satish, a youth belonging to a traditional Bengali family. In his passionate zeal to win the heart of Nalini, the daughter of Westernised parents, Satish indulges in cheating, lying and such vices despite being cautioned by his well-wishers. Eventually, Satish brings himself to the brink of disaster and it is left to Nalini and others to rescue him from trouble. To ensure an end to his foolish ways, Nalini marries Satish in the end. Interspersed with generous helpings of wit, humour and sarcasm, this play, directed by Bibhas Chakraborty, entertains as well as admonishes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bank officer?s son, burglary kingpin

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Last year, he represented a multinational company as a sales executive.

 This year, he masterminded a string of robberies across the city.

 Night-long interrogation of Purnendu Bhattacharya, alias Joy, a youth in his mid-20s caught red handed on Wednesday while trying to rob an office on NS Road, has revealed that he is a son of a bank officer. 

 During the course of interrogation, sleuths also came to know that Purnendu, a resident of Champdani, in Hooghly, had robbed three business centres and made off with more than Rs 20 lakh.

 Confirming Joy?s involvement in the recent crimes, Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department) said: ?We know of three cases in which Joy played a key role. Interrogation is on to find out if he is behind any other robbery in and around the city.?

 The police on Thursday netted two other gangsters who had raided the office of Gobardhan Mundhra and shot and wounded him. 

 The duo, identified as Dilip Das and Ajay Shaw, was arrested at their homes in the same locality as Joy?s. 

 Police, after interrogating them, came to know that they had dropped a revolver into the Hooghly while fleeing on Wednesday.

 ?The four members of the gang that raided Mundhra?s office are friends. They have known each other for several years. The fourth member will be tracked down soon,? said deputy commissioner Pandey.

 According to sleuths who interrogated Joy throughout Thursday, the youth?s father (name withheld on request) is an officer of Central Bank of India and posted in a central Calcutta branch. 

 ?Joy lived with his parents but they had no idea about his criminal activities. Joy told them that he had done a course in software programming and had joined a private firm with a pay packet of Rs 6,000 a month,? said an officer of the detective department?s dacoity wing. 

 ?Before leaving home, he would tell his parents that he was going to office.?

 The investigators came to know that Joy had masterminded the biggest robbery of Rs 18 lakh in the Burrabazar area last month. ?He raided an office in Manohardas Katra with his accomplices and robbed the money at gun-point,? an official said.

 Joy had stormed a mobile phone shop in Bowbazar a few weeks ago and fled with Rs 5,000 and six cell phones. 

 ?He also masterminded the robbery in a cosmetic -shop on Maharshi Debendra Road, in the Shyampukur area, two months ago and decamped with money,? said the official.

 Another sleuth said Joy had joined the gangsters from Bihar and started operating in various parts of the city. ?The gang would divide itself into groups. We?re trying to find out whether Joy had masterminded any house or bank robbery,? he added.

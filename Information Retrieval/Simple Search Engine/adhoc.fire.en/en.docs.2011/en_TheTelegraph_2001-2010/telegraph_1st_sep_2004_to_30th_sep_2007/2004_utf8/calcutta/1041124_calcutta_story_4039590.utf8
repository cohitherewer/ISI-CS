The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 In October 1992, at the time of inauguration of the second Hooghly bridge (Vidyasagar 

Setu), authorities hinted it would be opened to pedestrians shortly. But sadly, 

it was not to be. People are still not allowed to cross the bridge on foot. If 

authorities are worried that people might obstruct vehicular movement, they can 

put up high metal fences on both sides of the pavements and separate it from the 

carriageway. This will also keep people from throwing waste into the river or 

attempting suicide by jumping off the bridge. This way, the bridge will be safe 

and much more useful to the general public. Also, tourists can take a stroll on 

the bridge to enjoy the magnificent view.

 I hear that Hindi-medium schools under the West Bengal board have decided not 

to declare a holiday on Guru Nanak jayanti. This would be unfair since 

schools are closed on all other festivals like Durga puja and Id and even on bandhs 

called by small parties. The school authorities should excuse Sikh children from 

classes on that day. I request the education department to look into the matter.

 State buses should display the details about the route clearly on the body 

of the vehicle. As of now, they display only the route number in small font on 

the front. After dusk, this becomes difficult to read from even a short distance, 

especially on the EM Bypass. Sometimes, the route numbers are written in chalk 

on the windscreen. Even if better buses are beyond its means, the transport department 

can at least ensure that the route details are displayed prominently.

 Ten years ago Rabindra Bhavan was constructed in Majdia, Nadia, at the cost 

of Rs 35 lakh. It was aimed at encouraging local folk art, which is almost on 

the verge of extinction. Sadly enough, in the last decade, hardly any cultural 

programme has been organised here. The building was badly damaged in the devastating 

floods of 2000. No repair has been carried out so far. I request the government 

to take corrective measures.

 Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia. 

 My journey back from Delhi in coach AS1 of 2382 Dn on November 2 was a nightmare. 

The coach didn?t have water supply throughout the journey and complaints to the 

ticket-checkers were fruitless. Even the adjacent coaches ran dry a few hours 

into the journey.

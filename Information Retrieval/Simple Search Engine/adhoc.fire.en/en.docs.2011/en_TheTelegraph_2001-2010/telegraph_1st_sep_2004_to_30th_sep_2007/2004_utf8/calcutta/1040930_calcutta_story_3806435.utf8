State casts net for fish mart

 SWATI SENGUPTA 

 Calcutta consumes fish worth all of Rs 1 crore every day.

 No wonder the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is cashing in on this fondness and planning to enter the city?s fish market in a big way. And also bring in some method to rein in the madness associated with the trade.

 The state fisheries department will soon set up a wholesale market at a convenient spot. ?Right now, we?re looking for a plot, roughly four to five bighas,? said a senior official of the department. The idea behind the project, he explained, is to establish control over the prices, induce professionalism in the trade and maintain standards of cleanliness and hygiene.

 The department wants to set up the market near the existing wholesale fish markets in Howrah or Sealdah. 

 ?Already, some fish markets are being set up by the government in the districts. The aim is to have some control over the market in Calcutta as well, and introduce some strict norms for the sake of traders and consumers,? the official added.

 Apart from regulating the price mechanism for the benefit of consumers, the government is also very eager to enforce cleanliness norms at both wholesale and retail markets.

 ?Calcuttans are very fond of fish. But the markets they have to enter every morning are extremely unhygienic. The civic body or the local councillor neither monitors the market conditions nor forces the sellers to dispose of the remains in a scientific way. The situation at retail markets is quite alarming. This is one of the key areas that needs to be addressed,? said an official at Writers? Buildings. 

 The preservation system, especially at the retail end, is well below the standard. ?Most consumers, because of their busy lifestyle, store fish in refrigerators for a few days. It is, therefore, necessary that they don?t buy stale fish from the market. So, we are trying to introduce a set of norms in regard to storage,? the official added.

 By stepping into the market, the government also hopes to curb a reigning malpractice. Though it?s mandatory for anyone entering the trade to obtain a licence, the rule is followed more in violation than compliance. ?We now intend to set up our own infrastructure and stop the unfair practice,? the official asserted.

 Campus cards for scholars

 - Misuse of university research facilities by outsiders alleged

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Wiser after a series of marksheet scandals, Calcutta University is planning to make more stringent its rules of issuing identity cards to research scholars.

 The authorities are working on a proposal to make it mandatory for university research scholars to carry valid identity cards, bearing the signature of the registrar.

 For several decades, the authorities have been allowing research scholars to avail of the university facilities by presenting certificates of identity issued by their heads of department or research guides. 

 The present move follows complaints from a section of research scholars that people were availing of the university?s research facilities by posing as research scholars, said officials.

 ?We are going to be more strict about issuing identity cards to research scholars. I am unable to elaborate on the matter, as the issue is a sensitive one,? said a member of the university syndicate, who has been entrusted with streamlining the process of issuing identity cards to research scholars.

 According to university sources, over 2,000 scholars are carrying out research at various departments. Of them, not more than 150 have proper identity cards.

 Registrar Ujwal Basu has sent a circular to the departments concerned, asking the heads to prepare separate lists of scholars working in the university and take steps to issue identity cards to each one of them, said the sources.

 ?We might not allow research scholars to use the libraries or laboratories if they are not able to present their identity cards,? a senior official said.

 Goutam Gupta, a senior research scholar and a member of the university?s organisation of research scholars, said there are four categories of scholars in the university. ?The complaints are not of a serious nature so far. But we definitely appreciate the efforts made by the authorities to ensure that every scholar gets an identity card,? he added. 

 A senior teacher at the university?s Rajabazar Science College campus said: ?Chances of research scholars misusing their identity certificates are minimal. Only genuine candidates are issued certificates by the teachers, who are hauled up in case of irregularities.? 

 Registrar Ujwal Basu was not available for comment.

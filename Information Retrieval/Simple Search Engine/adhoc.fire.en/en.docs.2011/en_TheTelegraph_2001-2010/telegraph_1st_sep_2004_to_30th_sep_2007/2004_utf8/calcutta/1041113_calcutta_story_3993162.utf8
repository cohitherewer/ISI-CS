 Vision of success dispels darkness

 Mohammad Asif Iqbal was born in Bhagalpur, went to school in the US and studies management in Pune. But the 26-year-old can?t get over the ?amazing Punjabi tea served by the sardarji on Russell Street or near the Bhowanipore gurdwara?. The Symbiosis Centre for Management and Human Resource Development student loves swimming, water skiing, dancing and girls. From conducting motivational sessions with corporate honchos to being invited by the President to Rashtrapati Bhawan for a chat, this College Street boy has come far. Given, that he is blind. 

 ?I lost my vision completely at the age of 16, when I was in school in Oregon, Dallas. I was in the US for 10 years for treatment, when I stayed with my uncle?s family while my parents and siblings stayed on in Calcutta,? says Asif, opening his laptop. 

 The Toshiba machine, with JAWS (Jobs Access with Speech) software, is his constant companion. ?I use this to take down class notes, prepare presentations, surf the Net and read books. The software says aloud everything on the screen, making it possible for any blind people to use a computer,? adds Asif, a B.Com from St Xavier?s, Calcutta.

 Being visually handicapped, yet refusing to give up, Asif?s determination saw him through primary school in India (?teachers thought I was being lazy, when I was actually losing more than 50 per cent of my vision because of dried optic nerves?) and through graduation (?I helped my father after college in his exports business in Burrabazar?). 

 After college, he took a year?s sabbatical, preparing for management entrance tests, finally being selected as the first visually-impaired management student at Symbiosis. ?If I am given a problem to solve, I might have to take others? help to work it out, but I will never say I can?t do it,? says Asif. 

 Earlier this year, he conducted a workshop for over 15 blind people, teaching them the basics of computers. ?One of my students, who was already working with the excise department, now does programming as well,? beams the self-confessed foodie, who is game for a meal at Bar-B-Q anytime.

 But his mission of making people aware of the potential of the blind received the biggest boost earlier this year when he met A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in New Delhi on August 23. ?The President had come to know of my prowess in handling the JAWS-aided computer through former CBI director D.R. Karthikeyan,? says Asif. ?Among other things, Dr Kalam and I talked about developing software similar to JAWS in India, for mine has been imported and is very expensive.?

 Asif has been holding workshops at corporate addresses, ?taking sessions on motivation and asking them to offer employment to the handicapped?. After the course and through his job in Mumbai, he would like to keep up his mission, while ?planning a retired life only in Calcutta?.

It was only a couple of years ago, in October 2002, that the duo of Preeti Goenka and Sumedha Saraogi brought together some of the top names in the country?s fashion map on one platform for a style extravaganza ? the first of its kind in the city.

 And in these two years, Stylefile has become Calcutta?s most-awaited fashion event, showcasing the very best of Indian designs twice every year.

 The winter edition of Stylefile 2004 will be held at the Hyatt Regency on November 20. 

 While the show has all the right ingredients to be a runaway hit, the new addition this year is a Stylefile Young Master Award that aims at giving ?young designers from the city? a platform.

 ?We want to make Stylefile a serious cultural event. This year we have instituted an award for a young upcoming designer which will be given away through a competition among final-year students of the top fashion designing institutes of Calcutta,? said Preeti.

 Entries were invited from final-year students of fashion designing institutes who had to work on the theme India International. Five finalists have been chosen from a total of 20 entries and the quintet will be showcasing its creations at The Hyatt on November 19.

 The winner, to be chosen by a jury comprising designer Rina Dhaka, model Joey Matthew and choreographer Tania Lefebvre, will walk away with a cash prize of Rs 50,000 and the trophy. And not just that, the creations of the lucky one will share the stage with the biggies during the main event.

 And biggies means biggies. The designer list includes three of the city?s stalwarts ? Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Anamika Khanna and Kiran Uttam Ghosh ? along with Delhi and Mumbai names like Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna, Puja Nayyar, Rina Dhaka, Varun Bahl, Vivek Narang and Manish Malhotra.

 The model line-up is no less glamorous than the designs they will be flaunting. Catwalkers Jesse Randhawa, Vidisha Pavate, Bhawna Sharma, Tupur Chatterjee, Sonali Rozario, Muzzamil, Carol Gracious, Joey Matthew, Laxmi Rana, Michelle Innes, Sapna Kumar, Kiran Bajpai, Iggy, Moni Dutta, Tanvi, Aditya Bal and Shayaan Munshi promise to take care of the glam quotient on the ramp.

 Beauties from Calcutta, however, are few and far between with only Sanjukta and Tina joining the Mumbai and Delhi brigade. The movements on the ramp will be choreographed by Aparna Bahl and Tania Lefebvre from Delhi.

 The five finalists stealing some of the thunder would be Stuti and Prashant Ranjan from the National Institute of Fashion Technology, and Rati Shaw, Shuchi Jain and Debarghya Bairagi from the National Institute of Fashion Design.

 ?We were given the theme India International and had to work on an individual interpretation of the subject,? said Debarghya, who has tried to look at it from a foreigner?s point of view. ?I worked with the kathakali dance form which has a huge international appeal and tried to view it as a foreigner would see an Indian dance form,? he added.

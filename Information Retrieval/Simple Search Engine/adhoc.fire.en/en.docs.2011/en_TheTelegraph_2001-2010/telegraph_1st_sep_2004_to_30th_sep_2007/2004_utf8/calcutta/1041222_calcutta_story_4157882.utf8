 Lottery clean-up puts 44 in cuffs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The crackdown on online lotteries continued for the third day on Tuesday, with police arresting 44 people and lodging 86 FIRs in different cases in and around Calcutta.

 Over the past 24 hours, 11 lottery arrests were carried out in the central and southern parts of the city, while nine were recorded in North 24-Parganas, five in Hooghly, 11 in Howrah and eight in Burdwan.

 The 11 companies in the line of fire include Lotto, Playwin, V-1 and Dhandhanadhan. Nine FIRs were lodged against individual companies in Calcutta on Tuesday.

 A Playwin spokesperson on Tuesday termed the police action a ?motivated campaign?. Maintaining that all games on the Playwin terminal are completely legal, the company said it had paid sales tax for every ticket sold. 

 In 2003-04, the company claims to have deposited more than Rs 8 crore as sales tax to the state government.

 Asked about the government crackdown on online lotteries, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: ?The process was initiated by the state finance department. Action has to be taken against illegal activities.?

 Inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee elaborated: ?The finance department had asked us to probe the irregularities in the functioning of online lotteries on December 17. Based on a complaint by the director of lotteries, we conducted an inquiry and ordered a crackdown from December 19.?

 Most of those arrested comprise sellers, agents and promoters of online lotteries, clarified Mukherjee. They have been penalised under Sections (4), (7) and (9) of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998, for flouting all major regulations set by the state government, police explained.

 The rules say draws can be held only once a week, while the bumper draw can be held six times in a calendar year. Also, the lottery ticket should bear a stamp of the state hosting the lottery and transaction money should be deposited in the bank to give the state government a clear idea about the volume of business generated. 

 ?We?re looking out for operators who are absconding. If they don?t resurface soon, we will seal their outlets,? said Goutam Mohan Chakraborty, additional commissioner (III).

 Kiosks removed to rein in Romeos

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Road Romeos can no longer roam free in Salt Lake, at least for the time being. 

 After receiving orders from the top, the township police have taken the initiative to make things difficult for the eve-teasers.

 A number of stalls, believed to be the happy hunting grounds of the eve-teasers, have been made to down shutters and more than 50 road Romeos have been arrested in raids conducted after last week?s meeting between director-general of police Shyamal Dutta and officials of Bidhannagar police.

 ?Of the 150 people held in Salt Lake in recent times, more than 50 were arrested on charges of eve-teasing,? elaborated Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas. ?We have deployed a number of lady police personnel, too, who are conducting regular raids in three police station areas.? 

 Eight fast-food stalls around the swimming pool have been shut down by police this week as part of the drive. The area has become notorious for eve-teasing and complaints were pouring in.

 ?There is a girls? hostel in the locality. Evening-walkers also frequent the place. A large number of youths used to wait for victims near the stalls on the pretext of having a quick snack,? said a police officer. 

 Stalls have been shut down near City Centre, the area behind Vidyut Bhavan and in front of Nicco Park and Nalban, as well. ?The eve-teasers were active in the spots,? an officer said. He added that temporary stalls have been shut down at other places in the township as they were becoming hubs of criminal activity. 

 ?We are holding discussions with Bidhannagar Municipality and seeking the help of its officials. We have requested them to instal more streetlights. They have also been asked to conduct more eviction drives,? Kumar said.

 After last week?s meeting, forces have been increased at all the three police stations ? Bidhannagar North, South and East.

 Trinamul Congress leaders, however, alleged that police, being unable to nab criminals, are targeting foodstall-owners. ?Eve-teasing cannot be curbed by shutting down stalls. Police have to increase vigil and become more active,? said Sabyasachi Dutta, Trinamul councillor from ward 10 of Bidhannagar Municipality.

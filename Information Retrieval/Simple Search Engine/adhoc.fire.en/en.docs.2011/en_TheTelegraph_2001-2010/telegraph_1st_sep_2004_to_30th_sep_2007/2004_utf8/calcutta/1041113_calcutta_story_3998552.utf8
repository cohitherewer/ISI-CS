 Medical mess on street legal

 - Govt to move higher bench in solidarity move for students

 OUR BUREAU

The muddle over medical seats took a decisive turn on Friday as the government decided to move a higher bench of the Supreme Court with an appeal to grant permission for retaining all 105 MBBS students at SSKM and Midnapore Medical College.

 The decision was taken at a meeting in Writers? Buildings involving chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, advocate-general Balai Roy, chief secretary Asok Gupta, health secretary Kalyan Bagchi, higher education secretary Jawhar Sarkar and senior officials from the health and education departments.

 The agenda was simple: how to ?protect the future of 75 MBBS students? who have been shut out of the MBBS classrooms three months after they began the course.

 The action plan, of course, is complex. Chief secretary Gupta said the government would go by the law. Director of medical education C.R. Maity refused comment on the outcome of the impasse. The time was not ripe for an official declaration, he observed.

 The students? admission to the MBBS course stands cancelled following the apex court?s ruling last month fixing seats filled through the NRI quota at 15 per cent of the total 105. 

 The 75 affected students were on a hunger strike at SSKM Hospital from Monday, demanding that the government intervene and salvage their futures.

 They called off the strike after Bhattacharjee met them on Wednesday and assured them of all possible steps to address their problems. The agitating students then returned to class, but their academic fate continues to hang in the balance.

 M.M. Chowdhury, vice-chancellor of West Bengal University of Health Sciences, said on Friday that he was keeping the doors open for these students to register. ?Though their registration is pending, we will not question it once we get a clearance from the government,? he added. 

 Prabir Sur, director of Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, said an official word from the government should come through by ?the middle of next week?.

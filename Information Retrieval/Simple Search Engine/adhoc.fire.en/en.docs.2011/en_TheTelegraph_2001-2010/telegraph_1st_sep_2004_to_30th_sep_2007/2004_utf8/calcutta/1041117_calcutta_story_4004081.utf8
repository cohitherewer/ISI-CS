Food is no longer cooked in a kitchen that you can 

only imagine and shudder about (mice, rats, cockroaches et al). With the concept 

of interactive cooking catching on like a flamb? on fire, Goodlife has 

decided to stir things up a little. 

From today starts a weekly series that takes the lid 

off secrets behind every cook?s best bite ? from the phuchkawalla ensconced 

behind closed doors to a five-star?s chef-on-show.

For starters, KITCHEN CAPER invades a culinary destination 

that had the gall to bring coals to Newcastle, except in a form its residents 

had not quite seen before?

Give a man a fish and feed him for a day. Try to teach 

a Bengali to eat fish, and keep trying for a lifetime.

Unless you are Pan Asian, which has managed to get 

the Calcutta fish devotee to trade Ilish Machh Bhape for Norwegian Salmon ? that 

too, raw. 

If sushi ? and the rest of the exotic fare at the 

Oriental eatery at the ITC Sonar Bangla ? has clicked, it is not only because 

it occupies a gastronomic space none has dared to tread so far in Seafood City. 

It is because the sight-smell-touch experience at the sprawling restaurant is 

just as unique as its taste.

But to keep together a 138-cover restaurant serving 

the cuisine of five countries is about as tough as stale roomali roti. There 

are three separate kitchens ? one for Chinese and Thai, another for Mongolian 

and Korean, and the last exclusively for Japanese.

There are two challenges ? procuring the freshest 

produce required for this kind of khana and presentation of food in such 

live and interactive cooking spaces. For example, there are two tables here, imported 

from Japan, that have a heating element in the centre. They can either be used 

to cook on directly, like for the Korean live grill, or in a chimney soup-style 

tureen for the Mongolian hot pot ? all by the diners themselves, with just that 

little bit of expert guidance. The Tepanyaki Bar has two cooking stations where 

flamboyant chefs speedily whip up your meal before your hungry eyes, with bar 

seating all around. 

For this, specialist chefs from around the globe have 

been carefully handpicked for specific functions. Like Chef Putha, who miraculously 

balances an egg on the blade of a knife while throwing together fried rice as 

part of the grill. 

?The key to interactive cooking is in engaging the 

guests with a visual appeal,? explains Ramesh Javvaji, visiting chef from the 

Chola Sheraton, Chennai. 

But the most complicated part of running a restaurant 

of this kind is maintaining quality standards. Just as freshness is of the essence 

in Japanese food, so too purchasing has to be handled accordingly. 

While local suppliers have strict parameters, key 

ingredients come in from overseas. Salmon and Yellow Fin tuna are imported from 

Norway and Japan respectively. The thick-grain sushi rice, special vinegar, soya, 

wasabi (killer horseradish paste served with sushi), sake (rice 

wine) and seaweed are all imported. 

For the Misoshiro Soup, yellow bean paste and nameko 

jellied mushrooms are also sourced straight from Japan. ?Even the tofu used 

for the soup is imported. It is silken tofu, which has a different appearance 

and consistency from local tofu,? explains chef Swaroop Saha, in charge of Pan 

Asian.

While Chinese and Thai menus may be more mundane features 

compared to the rest of the spread, they also call for equal attention. 

Thai speciality cook Sritarnai Tapanee, affectionately 

known as Mama (one look at her motherly glow and you won?t ask why), treats a 

Kaffir lime leaf (a herb, an explosion of aroma, used in Thai cooking) with as 

much enthusiasm as most would treat the first hilsa of the season.

?Menu engineering? is required before deciding what 

to serve, where and for how much. For instance, the Korean barbecue platter includes 

expensive ingredients like cuttlefish, clams, prawns and tuna. 

?We have to consider pricing, the skills required, 

value and presentation while planning a menu,? adds Javvaji. Orders for imported 

ingredients have to be placed ?at least three months in advance?, while expensive 

wines have to be booked half-a-year ahead. This includes predictions for the festive 

season.

At Pan Asian, the gamble and the elaborate effort 

seem to have paid off. It is Japanese and Korean food that has made the Calcutta 

diner sit up and take notice. The reward: a full-fledged sushi bar in the making.

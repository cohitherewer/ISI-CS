The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Sanjoy Sett

 Chairman, eastern region, Travel Agents Association of India

 The government doing anything for any festival is a welcome move. If the Durga puja festivities are combined with and continued during Kali puja and Diwali, it will help bring tourists into Calcutta during a lean period. If there is a fireworks event done in an organised manner during the festival of lights, it will attract people here because it?s a new venture. There?s sports tourism, adventure tourism, health tourism and now, even dental tourism. So why not festival tourism? As it is, in the post-Puja period, the hotels are low on occupancy. If the government takes an initiative to attract tourists with out-of-the-box ideas and organised efforts, it will help the tourism industry.

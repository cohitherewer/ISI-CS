 Fibre focus in trendy totes

IPSITA DEB

Jute may have taken a beating, being passed up for 

plastic and other synthetic materials over the past decades for industrial applications, 

but it has resurfaced as a fashion statement that speaks of both style and eco-friendly 

political correctness.

 The natural fibre is completely biodegradable (watch out for synthetic laminates, though) and has been steadily gaining popularity for use in upholstery, rugs and other furnishings. For everyday use, jute has also become a material for trendy, colourful bags.

 Due to its coarse nature, heavy texture, durability and resistance to heat and fire, jute is finding favour once more.

 Jute bags can be sold in the buff (in its natural colour), dyed in vibrant shades or even printed. These are often embellished with sequins, beads, embroidery, mirror-work and even lace at times. At Ballyfabs on Camac Street, you can find a variety of bags to suit your sense of colour, texture and even shape.

 The colours or dyes used range from pastels and bright hues to more sober shades, designed to appeal to both the young, yuppie crowd as well as the more conservative market.

They come in a number of varieties for different uses 

as well. Shopping bags (specially laminated to provide extra stiffness and a flat 

base), trendy college sling bags, duffel bags, gift bags, promotional bags, drawstring 

bags and formal evening bags are some of the options available (picture by Rashbehari 

Das).

 The bags often use handles of interesting materials, including bamboo, cord, cane, cloth, wood and also leather.

 While these are usually far cheaper than leather and synthetic options, jute bags do lose out in terms of durability. A few months of use are likely to lead to some wear and tear. However, at these prices, you can replenish your stock without necessarily feeling the pinch.

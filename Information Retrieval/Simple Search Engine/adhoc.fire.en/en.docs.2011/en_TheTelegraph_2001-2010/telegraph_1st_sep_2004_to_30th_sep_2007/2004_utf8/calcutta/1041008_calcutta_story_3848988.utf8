From the Indian make-up stable Lakme comes the new 

Fireworks Collection ?that evokes the livewire woman of today?. She is to glow 

with colour, exuberance and vitality. The seasonal shades for this latest look 

range from the subtle to the dusky, taking in some bright colours too ? ?capturing 

her spirit in sparkling peachy-pinks, deep blues, lavender, purples and maroons?. 

The festive spirit is being celebrated and reflected in this range.

Created by fashion designer Tarun Tahiliani and make-up 

artist Kapil Bhalla, the colours for the season are set to kick off in a big way.

The Bedazzling Bronze theme, part of the three new 

looks (Pink Crackle and Purple Flame being the others), had model Katrina Kaif 

promoting it in the city, part of a pan-India tour. This look is rather basic 

and simple to imitate. With the right ingredients, this shimmering yet earthy 

sheen can create a dazzling effect.

Bronze it

The first step is the basic face routine. After gently 

cleansing your skin, apply a light foundation in upward strokes on the face and 

neck. Make sure to blend it evenly all through so there are no patches. Lightly 

dust the cheekbones, brow-bone and jaw-line with a loose gold powder. This exudes 

a warm, shimmering highlight. Of course, the makeover session with Katrina used 

products only by Lakme, but you can experiment with whatever you have in your 

kit.

Subtle strokes

Next, capture the earthen glow on the cheeks. Apply 

blusher (Pure Radiance if you are to replicate Katrina?s look) over the apples 

of the cheeks. Make sure it narrowly extends towards the ears. Do not overdo it, 

be sure to keep it subtle.

Eye allure

The third step is to capture the allure of the eyes. 

Line the upper and lower lashes with a kohl pencil in a dark charcoal shade. Blend 

in over the eyelids for a dusky, smoky look. Use a glitter roll-on if you have 

one. Once the sultry, slightly-smudged effect has been attained, sweep on a generous 

coat of thick black mascara.

Luscious lips

Finally, we come to the mouth. Katrina?s look calls 

for Almond Crunch 22 definition lip-liner, filled in with Enrich Lipcolour, Tarun 

Tahiliani 13. Stroke on a liquid gloss for that final sparkle. Bold yet muted, 

alluring with a streak of daring ? this is a look worth trying out this season.

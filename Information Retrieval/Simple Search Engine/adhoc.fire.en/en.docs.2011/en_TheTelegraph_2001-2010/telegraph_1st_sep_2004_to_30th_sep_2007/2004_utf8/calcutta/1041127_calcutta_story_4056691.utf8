 Tribute to teacher, ode to married woman

 Call it gimmick or genuine, the producer in Vidhu Vinod Chopra has been able to raise a storm with one simple ?step-motherly? remark. Mumbai tabloids and websites have gone to town with screaming headlines like ?Parineeta runs into trouble?. Director Pradeep Sarkar, though, has insisted throughout: ?Nothing?s gone awry ? everything?s going as per plan.? And hadn?t that happened, the film?s stars wouldn?t have landed and left the city as per the original schedule.

 Those present on the sets that day argue it was Parineeta?s core team that was more at fault in its dealings with the local technicians. And the problem was sorted out before it could cause damage or delay.

 While the real story stays hidden, it?s better to delve deep into the mind of Chopra, the visionary. The man, who started off making ?Sound of Music and Godfather in the same Bollywood movie? in Parinda, is now one of the strongest pillars in tinsel town. While his western breakthrough project hasn?t quite materialised, he has guided some of the brightest new directors of the country. 

 When Chopra came to Calcutta to promote Munnabhai MBBS, he had confessed he wanted to make a film in Bengal. ?That has always been my big dream. Ritwik Ghatak taught me film-making at the Pune institute and he used to teach me in Bengali. I didn?t understand a single word initially but he chose not to speak in any other language. Those three years were so Bengali that I always wanted to come here and make a film. And here I am making Parineeta??

 He doesn?t even regret not directing it. ?I just want to write and produce films now. I want to help out talented film-makers to realise their dreams.?

 Chopra has always got the best creative talent to come together in one film. Even for Parineeta, he?s got Munnabhai director Rajkumar Hirani as the film?s creative producer. ?There is so much creative energy involved. I believe in the fact that we have to all come together to pursue and achieve excellence in cinema. If there is a conflict of thought, I always have the final say.?

 Hirani thinks likewise: ?It is never a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. When many creative people converge for one single project, it only blossoms, it never gets affected.?

 Sarat Chandra has always been close to Chopra?s heart. ?When I was a little boy in Kashmir, I grew up reading him,? he recalls. ?I read Devdas. I read Parineeta. This film, I owed to Saratbabu. He is the Shakespeare of Bengal... We haven?t even announced the film in Mumbai. We met the press for the first time here in Calcutta,? he added, stressing the Bengal bonding bit.

 Chopra doesn?t deny the fact that he could have shot the film in Mumbai. ?But we had to do it here in Bengal. I think this is the first time an entire Mumbai team has come here to shoot for 57 days. We have been shooting round-the-clock. Sometimes for 12 hours, 16 hours and even 18 hours a day.?

 Director Sarkar and the main cast of Sanjay Dutt and Saif Ali Khan look at Parineeta 2004 as a return to a bygone period in history and a recreation of the old days. Chopra, though, looks at the film differently. ?Parineeta is about the married woman. In today?s times, love and marriage have become very important concepts. That?s what Parineeta explores, relating love with marriage. The story of the film is relevant even today. We could have set it in modern times but I wanted a little period feel. So 1962 is the year in the film, when Bengal was going through a very torturous period.? 

 The casting for Parineeta, Chopra confesses, happened on its own. ?Sanjay has to be there in all my films. He is like family to me. As for Saif, it has been a revelation. When he came to the office he was slated to do another role. He just said, ?I can do Shekhar?. And I saw the rushes and he has truly done an incredible job.?

 But what?s happened to Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the director? ?I am writing Yagna. It should get underway by middle of next year. Amitabh Bachchan plays one of the main roles. Sanjay is there too. The rest of the casting is being done. We are also writing Rajkumar Hirani?s next film and once the scripting is over, we?ll be able to talk more.?

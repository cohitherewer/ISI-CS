The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Universities cobble up student code

 OUR BUREAU

 The spirit of the chief minister?s ?do-it-now? mantra seems to have percolated to the academic institutions in the state. 

 Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) and West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) have decided to introduce a code of conduct for students to help them achieve academic excellence.

 While BESU is almost ready with the code and plans to welcome students with a new set of rules when it reopens after the puja vacation, WBUT plans to implement its new regulations from January.

 ?The formulation of a code for students is a completely new concept. We hope the code will help improve the academic quality of our university,? said BESU vice-chancellor Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee. 

 According to the officials of the universities, the student-related problems hampering academics are:

Clashes among students and between students and outsiders

Ragging

Low attendance

Class bunking

Exam boycott

Agitation on issues like permission to sit for exams despite low attendance

Depression, especially among boarders

Suicide.

 ?Considering the tough job market, we cannot allow students to waste a single day of the course. We will be in a position to implement our code at the beginning of the next semester,? elaborated Samir Bandyopadhyay, registrar, WBUT. 

 The university has 70 private engineering and management institutions affiliated to it. Over 50,000 students study in the institutions.

 Registrar Bandyopadhyay said the university took the initiative after a recent order of Calcutta High Court directed universities offering engineering and management courses to take every possible step to ensure that academic days are not lost due to students? agitations. 

 WBUT officials said at present, the restrictions on students are not followed properly, as they are conveyed only verbally. 

 The new codes, according to sources, will focus on 15 rules and regulations. Some of them are: 

Students will have to attend a certain number of classes every week

Boycott of classes and examinations will be prohibited

Students will not be allowed to leave the campus without permission

Smoking, drinking and consumption of narcotics by students on campus will 

be prohibited.

 Officials of universities said they are planning an awareness campaign to ensure that the students understand the purpose of the codes. Psychologists will also be appointed to conduct interactive sessions with students thrice a month.

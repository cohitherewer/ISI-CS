The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Eight days, 80 shows

 Barely a week after the Nandan campus came alive with the cacophony of film buffs, the city?s theatregoers are gearing up to set it abuzz once again with a stage gala this weekend.

 The Fourth Natyamela features around 75 troupes from across the state and outside who will perform at Rabindra Sadan, Sisir Mancha and on two makeshift stages ? set up in memory of Safdar Hashmi and Asit Mukhopadhyay ? on the Nandan grounds.

 On Thursday evening, the eight-day festival, hosted by Paschimbanga Natya Akademi in association with Purbanchal Sanksriti Kendra, was unveiled with Theatre Workshop?s Andhajuger Manush.

 ?The stress this time is on street theatre and theatre of the adivasi and challenged people, for which we have several groups from outside the city too. The other interesting feature is the impromptu adda sessions to be held from 6 pm everyday,? said Chandan Sen, theatre veteran and one of the organisers. 

 This apart, seminars, screenings and an exhibition have also been arranged to warm up the evenings.

 The Calcutta acts include Chupkatha?s Mrs Souriano, Ganakrishti?s Sateroi July, Nandikar?s Sojon Badiyar Ghat, PLT?s Bibighar, Rangakarmee?s Antaryatra, Blind Opera?s Raja and Anya Theatre?s Kal ba Porshu.

 The street theatre line-up of 19 shows, to be staged on Safdar Hashmi Muktamancha, features troupes from Naihati, Nadia, Burdwan, Barrackpore, Konnagar and Midnapore.

 Adding a new dimension to the gala is intimate theatre, a closed-door performance in a second-floor room at Gaganendra Pradarshashala.

 Holding out the promise of this different theatre experience are groups from Kolaghat and Belghoria. 

 It also includes Soumitra Basu?s Sandarbha, People?s Repertory Theatre?s Dewal (a Jean Paul Sartre adaptation) and Alternative Living Theatre?s Amma.

For those who had missed out on some of the best productions 

of the past few years, there?s a video film exhibition to catch. Chirakumar 

Sabha, Buro Shaliker Ghaarey Row, Balidan and Janmadin (in

 As a flashback to the glory days of group theatre, an exhibition of photographs is also being mounted by researcher Sandhya De at Gaganendra Pradarshashala.

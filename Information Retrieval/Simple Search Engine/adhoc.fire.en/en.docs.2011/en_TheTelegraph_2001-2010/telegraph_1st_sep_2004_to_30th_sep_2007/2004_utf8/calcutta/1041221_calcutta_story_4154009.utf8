The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fog, terror strike havoc on trains

 OUR BUREAU

 The question at Howrah and Sealdah stations, throughout Monday, was not whether a train was late, but by how many hours.

 Dense fog and a terror strike combined to derail trains travelling into Calcutta from up north. The blast that claimed a bridge in the Gaya-Mughalsarai section of East Central Railway added to the delay caused by fog and compounded the misery of passengers on the trains and the waiting multitudes at the terminal stations.

 Officials, too, blamed the elements and the act of terror. ?Most of the trains from north India were running late due to the dense fog. As a result, the trains that were scheduled to cross the accident site before the blast actually reached it after the explosion and were held up,? said a senior official of Eastern Railway.

 Some trains were diverted from Mughalsarai via the Patna-Kiul-Jhajha route while others, including the two Rajdhanis, just waited for the track to be restored ? that took nearly 10 hours.

 The rake of Himgiri Express, not scheduled to run on Monday, was used as the Up Doon Express, given that the corresponding Down Doon Express arrived 16 hours late.

 ?Rakes of some other trains were also used as alternatives for some trains,? the official added. Scratch rakes were also pushed into action.

?All this ensured that we had to cancel only two trains 

? the Kalka Mail and the Bhopal Express ? and reschedule three,? the official 

said.

 Railway officials at both Howrah and Sealdah stations struggled to cope with anxious kin of passengers and the flood of inquiries. 

 All through Monday, the inquiry counters at both stations remained besieged.

 ?We just kept waiting for word about the train and its safe passage,? said Haradhan Mondal, at the Railway Protection Force (RPF) assistance booth, whose sister was on the New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express.

 Maya Ray, whose son was on the Jammu Tawi-Sealdah Express, was heard pleading with an RPF personnel: ?Please tell me whether things are all right.?

 An RPF official said: ?Swamped by inquiries, we kept assuring people that safety measures had been taken in the sabotage-prone zones.?

 For the passengers, it seemed a never-ending journey through night and day. 

 ?There was dense fog in several parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and so the train was stranded for hours at these places. Then, we were stuck because of the blast,? said Muzammil Haque, a businessman from Bangladesh on the Sealdah Rajdhani. ?I wish I had taken a flight.?

 For S. Mukherjee, the worst lay ahead of him. 

 Armed with a ticket for the Kalka Mail, to attend a meeting in New Delhi, he was told the train was going nowhere on Monday. ?How will I go now? What will I do?? Mukherjee was left wondering.

 The plight of co-passenger Rajiv Banerjee was similar. ?There are long waiting lists for all Delhi-bound trains. I do not know what I will do, now that the Kalka has been cancelled,? he said.

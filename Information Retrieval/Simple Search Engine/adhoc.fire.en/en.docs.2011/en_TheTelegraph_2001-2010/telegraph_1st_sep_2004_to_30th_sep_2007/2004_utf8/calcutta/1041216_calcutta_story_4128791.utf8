The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Roman art on lounge line

The 

design concept ? low-key and minimalist. The inspiration ?buildings of ancient 

Rome defined by their dignity, balance and symmetry. The address ? the heart of 

Calcutta?s central business district.

 The Palladian Lounge, a club lounge with a fine-dining area, the first of its kind in the Dalhousie area located on the third level of The Bengal Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry (BCCI), was unveiled on Wednesday.

 Managed by Asian Hotels Ltd, owners of the Hyatt Regency hotels in Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai, the BCCI?s lounge housed in its magnificent heritage building, is designed following the concept of Palladianism, an ancient style of European architecture developed by Italian architect Andreas Palladio.

 Besides the 250-odd members of the chamber, The Palladian 

Lounge, with its executive club lounge-bar, exclusive board room, conference and 

meeting rooms, is also open to guests of Hyatt Regency and ?temporary members?.

?We are confident this would become a mini-landmark 

in Calcutta which is gradually returning to its days of commercial glory and we 

compliment the BCCI for spearheading a change in the central business district,? 

said Sandip Ganguli, vice president, sales amp; marketing, Asian Hotels Ltd.

Architect Dulal Mukherjee, who has done the concept 

design for the interiors, echoed Ganguli?s hopes: ?This is a quiet beginning which 

can go a long way in restoring Dalhousie Square to its former glory and could 

be the starting point for a large-scale restoration of the neglected business 

quarters.?

Ethnic effect 

 Ritwika, an export house for Indian ethnic wear to 

western destinations like London, Vancouver and San Francisco, has recently opened 

its doors to the Calcuttan as well, at a new boutique called Ritwika?s at 121, 

Park Street.

 The two-storey shop has a retail set-up on its ground floor. ?With organised retail becoming such a huge affair in the city, we decided to cash in on the growing trend and bring to the city outfits that are doing so well abroad,? says owner Ashwin Agarwal.

 Though the bulk of the saris and lehngas produced is packed off for NRIs, from the styling of the clothes it?s evident that no matter where Indians live, they look for the same kind of colours and designs. Thus, bright pinks, yellow and blues dominate the collection as does soft green ?all of which are being lapped up by the Indian marriage and party scene. 

 ?The designs of our collection are subtle and aren?t too jazzy,? points out designer Farah Khan. However, sequins and beads dominate the embellishments as do zari embroidery in shining gold.

Priced between Rs 5,000 and Rs 100,000, the saris 

and lehngas have been divided into traditional and party-wear categories.

Casual style 

She caught the eye of ace designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee 

with her creations at Parampara Pret last month. Not only did Sabyasachi shower 

her with praise, he judged Medhavini Khaitan?s men?s wear line the best among 

33 entries at the Rotary show.

 With the kudos in her kitty, the young designer with oodles of promise has just launched her newest collection ? the lounge wear line. At a one-day exhibition at her Queens? Park residence, she showcased a range of whites, blacks, creams and blues in fabrics like cotton linen and denim suede.

 ?The underlying theme of this collection is texturing,? says Medhavini, who likes to keep her clothes subtle, from light embroidery to patchwork. The high-point of the line is the reversible shirts.

 Priced between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,800, Medhavini?s collection is much-needed in the city?s latent men?s wear scene.

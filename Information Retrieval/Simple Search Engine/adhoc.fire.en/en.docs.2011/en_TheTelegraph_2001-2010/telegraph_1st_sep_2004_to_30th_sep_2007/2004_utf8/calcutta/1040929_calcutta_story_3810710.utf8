 Kashmir cuisine count

ZEESHAN JAWED

Kashmir 

is as much about beauty as about bloodshed, as much about the good things in life 

as about the grim. But one thing that can always bring a smile to the face is 

the cuisine of Kashmir. And so can a gourmet guidebook to the paradise on earth.

 Russi Mody launched Healthy and Delightful Kashmiri Cooking, the book by lifestyle columnist Anju Munshi, at Tollygunge Club on Monday evening.

 ?After years of research and interactive sessions with dieticians and doctors, I have penned all my ideas in this book,? offered Anju.

 Addressing many myths about Kashmiri cuisine was one of the motivations for the author born in the Valley.

 The book contains various recipes, mostly meat-based, but many vegetarian, as well.

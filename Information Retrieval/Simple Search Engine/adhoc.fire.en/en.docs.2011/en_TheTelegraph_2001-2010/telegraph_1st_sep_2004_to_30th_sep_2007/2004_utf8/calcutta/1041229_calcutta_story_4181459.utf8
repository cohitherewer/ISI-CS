The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Give us this day our daily pay

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should the day?s salary be deducted for all employees for absence on a bandh day?

 Freeway: A deserted Shyambazar five-point 

crossing on a bandh day

Chameli Pal,

 Batanagar

Don?t the judges enjoy holidays during lawyers? strikes? 

They also enjoy long vacations, which might have resulted in holiday fatigue. 

For lesser mortals, bandhs are a breath of fresh air. More importantly, they are 

not sterile as a medium of protest. English was re-introduced in the primary school 

curriculum of the state following bandhs. Hence, deduction of salary for absence 

on bandhs is uncalled for. 

Jyoti Agarwal, 

 Lake Town

If a bandh does not affect life to a significant extent, 

a day?s salary should be docked from an employee?s salary for his or her absence. 

Going to a movie is certainly not the way to defeat bandhs. But if a bandh does 

bring life to a halt, it will be really harsh on the employees to deprive them 

of the day?s salary. No one should have to risk his or her life to attend office.

Sohini Roy, 

 Address not given

The day?s salary should not be deducted from all employees 

for absence on a bandh. Even if the bandh is, in general, unsuccessful, there 

might be trouble in isolated pockets, thus preventing sections of employees from 

turning up. Such employees should not be penalised. One should remember that people 

have lost lives in the state due to bandh-related violence.

Govind Das Dujari, 

 Diamond Harbour

There is no reason not to deduct the salaries of employees 

who are absent on a bandh. The no work-no pay segment constitutes about 40 per 

cent of the workforce here. These labourers do not have a choice on a bandh, even 

though they need their day?s pay. Why should the rest of the workers be spared, 

especially when ?a cause? is at stake?

Sandip Mallik, 

 Hazra Road

There should be a deduction in the salaries of all 

employees who are intentionally absent on a bandh. But it must be kept in mind 

that a bandh is a political event and an average employee has nothing to do with 

it. Quite often, it is almost impossible to move about during bandhs. Even private 

vehicles are stopped on such days. The only way to prevent bandhs is by not calling 

them.

Anjan Chatterjee,

 Tollygunge 

Let a day?s salary be deducted for absence on a bandh 

to ensure full attendance in offices and to bring back work culture in the state, 

especially in the government offices of Bengal. High attendance rate in offices 

would discourage political parties to call bandhs, helping us to get rid of the 

scourge forever. All this is possible only if the state guarantees security and 

availability of transport to the people on bandhs. 

Anandadip Chowdhury, 

 Baguiati

People face a lot of trouble in commuting to their 

offices during bandhs due to paucity of transport. Also, bandh supporters often 

get involved in clashes with protesters causing bloodshed. It is quite natural 

that people are petrified of going out of their houses on bandhs. It would be 

unfair on the employer?s part to deduct salaries for not attending office on bandhs.

Pritha Sen,

 Jadavpur

No way. An employee might want to attend office but 

not be able to do so due to external factors. Should he or she be pressed to take 

risks because the state can?t think of a better way to prevent bandhs? Having 

said that, a paycut will certainly bring lazy employees to office. However, to 

bring all employees under its ambit, the offices must arrange for their transportation 

and safety.

Rimli Datta,

 Salt Lake

The proposal is not welcome. There should be a cut 

in the salaries of only those employees who live near the office. They can hop 

over even if public transport is not available. But those who live far away should 

not be penalised for absence. Work is important, but not more than life.

Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Burdwan 

Paycut for all employees for absence on bandhs cannot 

be supported. Disruption of traffic and violence are hindrances for those who 

want to go out on bandhs. A salary deduction is justified only if the state ensures 

availability of transport and police protection.

HaraLal Chakraborty, 

 Arabinda Nagar

Deduction of a day?s salary for absence on a bandh 

is a must for government employees. In case of private businesses, the matter 

should be left to the discretion of the managements. Those who oppose the proposal 

should try to imagine the plight of the daily-wage earners on bandhs. 

Joydip Sur,

 CIT Road

Old habits die hard. So, we can safely predict that 

if left to their ways, the politicians would continue to call bandhs. But it is 

imperative that we do everything to oppose them. Deduction of salary for absence 

on bandhs can be a start.

Vinay Kkumar Dokania,

 Shibpur

Deduction of employees? salaries will not, in any 

way, dissuade politicians from calling bandhs. Most people are afraid of being 

caught in the violence on bandhs. They will not attend office even if they have 

to lose money. A better option would be to penalise the villains of the piece 

? the political parties. 

Purnima Vasudeva,

 Rowland Road

Certainly not. As recently as December 3, the entire 

transport system was in disarray due to the bandh called by Trinamul Congress. 

I am sure many people were not able to attend office on the day despite their 

best efforts. Why should an employee suffer a paycut because of the whims of political 

parties?

Joydeep Chatterjee,

 Shyambazar

Bandhs have become synonymous with holidays in our 

state. It would be meaningless to deduct the salaries of employees for absence 

on a bandh. People will simply take a leave on the day and life would be disrupted 

as usual. 

Biswajit Ganguly,

 Dakshindari Road

Most employees do not attend office on bandhs due 

to security threats and transportation problems. If the government makes proper 

arrangements to ensure that life is not affected on bandhs, and yet the attendance 

at offices remains low, there would certainly be a case to slap paycuts on employees.

R.L. Nandi,

 Kaikhali

If the government starts deducting the salaries of 

employees for absence on bandhs, without ensuring transportation facilities and 

taking proper security measures, a flurry of court cases will follow. As a fall-out, 

the system could well be discontinued. So the government should ensure normalcy 

on bandhs before implementing such a rule. 

Pujasree Chatterjee,

 Rashbehari

Employees should not be paid salaries for doing nothing. 

No party considers the plight of the daily-wage workers while calling a bandh. 

It?s only fair that white-collar workers are not provided an escape route.

Debashis Saha,

 Paikpara

Paycut is the only way to change the bad habits of 

the employees in the state, who treat bandhs like holidays. Ministers, judges 

and high-ranking officials should not also be exempted from the system.

Stuti Agarwal,

 Beleghata Main Road

No, employees should not be made scapegoats for something 

which is not in their hands. Mostly, it is not the lure of a paid holiday but 

the threat, which keeps willing employees confined indoors. Furthermore, how can 

the government expect employees to attend office when it is itself unable to ensure 

normal services on a bandh? 

Gunjeet Wadhwa,

 Rai Bahadur Road

Absenteeism on bandhs is yet another excuse for government 

employees to stay away from offices. But deducting their salaries is not justified. 

Several employees have to use a number of modes of transportation to reach office. 

If any of these modes is affected, it becomes difficult for them to attend office. 

Next week

 A bright new year is round the corner. The festive bells are ringing loud and 

clear. Optimism hangs heavy in the winter air. It is time to put on your thinking 

cap and draw out a wishlist. Year 2004 gave us flyovers and foodstops, multiplexes 

and shopping malls. What would you want Calcutta to be blessed with in 2005? Name 

the one thing you want to see happen right here in the city and tell us how you 

think your chosen phenomenon will make a difference. Pick up your pen and let 

your 

imagination fly...

Beer binge for giddy guzzlers

Plan a Party

Zeeshan Jawed whips up a fun formula 

for hosting a lager fest, Munich style

 Do 

 Stack up your party with plenty of beer kegs 

 Arrange for finger food like pretzels

 Drink water to prevent dehydration 

 Don?t 

 Invite strangers or under-age revellers

 Keep precious objects conspicuously in harm?s way 

 Resort to colas or soft drinks 

The city got its first taste of the Oktoberfest recently, 

with the banquet at The Taj Bengal being transformed into a mini Munich (pictures 

by Rashbehari Das). While the beer extravaganza celebrates the autumn harvest 

season in Germany, why not organise your own bash to celebrate, well, just about 

anything! You can easily recreate a similar ambience at home. All you need is 

a free-flowing supply of lager, some nibbles and plenty of beer guzzlers.

By the barrel

Drinking lots of beer and some more beer is the order 

of the occasion. So to make the party a success, try to get your hands on a keg 

of beer instead of the standard bottles or cans. Traditionally, a variety of brew 

is served, but you won?t really have much to choose from on home turf. ?Lager 

beer and the fresh fountain beer are the only types available in India. So, let 

the quantity make up for the lack of variety,? says Subroto Goswami, executive 

chef, Hyatt Regency. Over-sized beer mugs, and a few waitresses in aprons, would 

add the perfect touch, Oktoberfest style.

Finger food

Heavy food will only interfere with the main agenda 

of the evening. But finger food is very much on the menu. ?Appetisers will keep 

the hungry happy without spoiling the appetite for beer,? suggests Goswami. ?Pretzels 

are strongly recommended for their salty nature. They dry out the mouth, increasing 

your thirst for ale. Light dishes like chicken roast and sausages are also recommended,? 

adds chef Surinder Singh of Taj Bengal, behind the exotic layout at the Alipore 

address. To continue the beer theme with the food, try recipes that involve the 

frothy brew, like oven-roasted pork in beer gravy with potato dumplings. If you 

plan to have heavier food, a barbecue would fit right in.

Liquor laws

While the beer might be flowing generously, you should 

guard against crossing your threshold. Don?t mix your drinks if you want the night 

? and the morning after ? to go smooth. Excessive alcohol consumption causes dehydration, 

so remember to drink enough water. If you care for your body more than how many 

pints you can down at one go, get some food into your system before the binge. 

For teetotallers who might mistak- enly find themselves at your bash, stocking 

some non-alcoholic malt beverages that plenty of liquor companies love to advertise 

could be a good idea. For once, give the colas a miss, in keeping with your theme 

for the party. 

Gang up

Choose your guests with extreme care. Make sure each 

of your invitees are above the legal drinking age. Ask your friends not to bring 

along any strangers who might turn out to be unruly revellers. And finally, make 

sure that you keep all breakable objects out of harm?s way.

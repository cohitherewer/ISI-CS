Tipple turnaround with fire force 

Feng Shui

 Pinky Kapoor

 People suffering from alcoholism can gain clarity 

and strength by clearing the southern part of the house and then illuminating 

it with the fire element, using shades of red or maroon. The northern part, on 

the other hand, can be revitalised by installing a large mirror with a metal frame 

and an aquarium or a water fountain on a metallic base

Do you have any Feng Shui remedy to stop alcoholism? 

My friend (date of birth 17.09.1948) is losing everything he is earning and his 

family is now at stake. He wants to stop but can?t. His wife (date of birth 5.11.1952) 

has always tried to make some money herself, but nothing has worked. She has tried 

a number of jobs but everything seems to fizzle out. And whatever she makes is 

sucked up by her family?s need.

The Solution: Your friend can gain clarity 

and strength by clearing the southern sector of the house and then energising 

and illuminating it with the fire element, using shades of red or maroon. The 

true nature of fire is to illuminate the self and in doing so, clear doubts and 

gloom. On the southern wall of your friend?s bedroom, place a picture of deep 

woods with a meandering path running deep into the forest with tall trees on either 

side and a soaring phoenix. The pathway will inspire him to move ahead whereas 

tall trees and the bird will give him energy and motivate him to reach great heights. 

The northern part of the house represents our movement through life. When this 

particular area is cleared of clutter, it makes our journey through life much 

smoother. Let go of the stagnant, negative energy by burning some camphor here. 

Revitalise this area by installing a large mirror with a metal frame and an aquarium 

or a water fountain on a metallic base. Shades of blue can be used to enhance 

this area in the form of accessories like artefacts, floor rugs, flowers and candles.

We have a large collection of paintings all depicting 

women. For the time being, we have taken down all the paintings. Can you tell 

us how we should place them in our house?

Akriti Ganeriwala

The Solution: The energy created by objects 

in our environment has a direct impact on our lives. Think twice before you hang 

any paintings in the house. You should choose artwork with special meaning that 

inspires you. Too many paintings of women can create excess feminine energy. They 

can be used to invite feminine energy for a marriageable son. One such painting, 

when placed in the south-west of his bedroom with his photo beside it, can work 

wonders. But do not over-energise this area by introducing too many paintings. 

Once he is married, these should be replaced with the couple?s wedding photos. 

The rest of the paintings can be hung in a formal living room, which is used only 

occasionally.

Our house has a series of ancestors? photographs, 

all displayed on the northern wall of the dining hall. Is this the right place? 

What precautions should we take while displaying these photos?

Madhu Agarwal

The Solution: In Feng Shui, ancestors are revered 

and respected. We turn to them for their counsel and blessings. Their photographs, 

when displayed on the eastern wall, are believed to bless their descendants directly. 

They are best displayed in living rooms and not in the dining area, corridor or 

bedrooms. The images should not be placed under a beam or beneath or above a toilet 

on floors above or below. Their vision should not be blocked or restricted with 

a column or blank wall too close to it. They should also not be placed at the 

end of a long corridor, where they are hit by flowing energy.

I have been married for 12 years. The first 10 

years were good, but two years ago, we shifted into a new house and my life took 

a bad turn. My husband has become very dominating. I am not even allowed to leave 

the house without his permission. If I ever gather the courage to step out, he 

abuses me verbally and physically. Can you suggest something to ease the situation?

Name and address withheld

The Solution: South-west is the sector of the 

house that is connected with marriage. If this area is missing in your home such 

problems can arise, making marriages miserable. If the sector is absent, install 

a strong light and keep two heavy earthen pots filled with stones in south-west 

side of the house. This will help stabilise your relationship. Create a cosy corner 

in the relationship area of the bedroom with couples? photos and clear the stagnant 

and negative energy here by burning an aromatherapy burner from morning to evening 

for the first few days. Then confine it to evenings only. It will definitely have 

a refreshing effect on your relationship. Choose any fragrance you like.

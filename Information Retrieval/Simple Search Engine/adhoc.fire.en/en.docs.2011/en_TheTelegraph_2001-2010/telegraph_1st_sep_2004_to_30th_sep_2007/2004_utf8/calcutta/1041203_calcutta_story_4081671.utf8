The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Julianne Moore You have a great sense of 

justice and feel strongly about environmental issues. Your jovial spirit and cordial 

manner make you popular. You have a flair for writing. Sport and outdoor games 

are a passion. Stay alert, don?t get fleeced. You wont make an emotional 

commitment unless you?re sure the feeling is mutual. ? Kusum Bhandari

 Years after migratory birds started giving Calcutta a wide berth, thereby exposing themselves to the risk of being hunted elsewhere in the state, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government is preparing to embark upon a census and conservation of the city?s winter guests. 

 ?We are going to start a census of migratory birds this winter,? says V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden of the state forest department. ?Its findings will be used to frame a policy on birds. It will be difficult to keep the winged creatures safe and secure if there is not enough awareness about them.? The census will cover all the wetlands where these migratory birds take refuge.

 A major force behind the upcoming initiative is Suchetana Bhattacharjee, nature lover, who also happens to be the chief minister?s daughter. 

 ?We are trying to create awareness about protecting these migratory birds,? said Suchetana, a member of Aranyak, a platform for organisations interested in nature and wildlife awareness to come together. 

 Although officially the forest department says the census is for ?better management and protection of migratory birds?, forest department sources and several NGOs say they have received reports on how these birds are coming under attack at various wetlands in remote areas. 

 NGOs, research scholars, experts of the Zoological Survey of India and the forest department will take part in the survey, which will be conducted for approximately a fortnight from mid-January. There are an estimated 7,000 wetlands in the state, covering 550,000 hectares. On the basis of the reports, the forest department will draw up an action plan. A two-day census will be conducted at each waterbody, which will be divided into imaginary grids to count the birds.

 The pintail ducks, coots, red-crested pochards, brahmni ducks, cadwall, garganey, common teal, common sandpiper, red shank, whimbrel, Eurasian curlew, various types of snipes, stints, the gulls and the terns ? which once alighted on the wetlands in and around the city, are now forced to leave the safe havens and become easy prey of poachers. These birds wing 1,000 to 5,000 km every year to reach the city?s wetlands. They come from various parts of northern Eurasia, Eastern Europe and high-altitude terrain like Ladakh, China and other parts of the Himalayas. 

 According to forest department sources, at least 40 per cent of the migratory bird population has moved out of Calcutta. ?An increase in the number of highrises, environment shift and sound pollution have forced them to move away,? said V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden.

 According to Kushal Mukherjee, secretary of Prakriti Sansad, these birds have to fight for space with fishermen in various wetlands. The birds get disturbed by the boats.

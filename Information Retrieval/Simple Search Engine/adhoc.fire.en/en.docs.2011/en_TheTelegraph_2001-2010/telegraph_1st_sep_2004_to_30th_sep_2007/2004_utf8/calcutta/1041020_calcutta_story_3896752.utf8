Marathon adda at the pandal, rustling up an elaborate bhog, offering anjali, sharing prasad? the warmth of togetherness. Cementing this community camaraderie by reviving the old para feel. 

 The Telegraph Hand in Hand Puja programme promises four days of fun and frolic, from Sashti to Navami, with loads of events and prizes galore at housing estates across the city.

 The contest line-up has something for everyone in the family, with prizes to be sponsored by Pepsi and Ffort Holiday Klub. While the ladies can show off their conch-blowing skills, the men may line up for a round of dhunuchi naach. 

 There?s a fashion contest for teens, sit-and-draw for the little ones and spot quiz for those with a penchant for mind-teasers.

 Antakshari, needless to say, is open to all those with a melodious strain or just a good enough stock of songs, while the Shera Uttor demands answers to some crafty queries. 

 Those under one roof bagging the maximum number of prizes will be crowned the Family of the Puja, while the Personality of the Puja goes to the fortunate one who mops up the most medals.

 Sashti took off with crayons and water colours at most estates. ?Around 80 kids took part in the sit-and-draw held in our community hall. People are gearing up for the conch-blowing competition, slated for Saptami morning,? said Shankar Banerjee, of Utsarg Utsav Puja in Survey Park, Santoshpur.

 At Saurav Abasan in Salt Lake, the drawing contest pulled in 14 kids from the complex with a resident strength of 50. ?The contest has generated a lot of excitement among the children and the elders are animated, too,? said Chaitali Mukherjee. 

 ?There were around 15 participants in each of the two age groups ? three to eight and eight to 14,? added D.L. Bandyopadhyay, of Anushakti Abasan in the township.

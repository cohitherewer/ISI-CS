 Kin firm on molest charge

 - Top cop in parleys to free son, block committee wont relent

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after the arrest of Shahnawaz Khan on the charge of molesting a married woman in Salt Lakes HA block, his top cop father mounted an exercise to defuse the situation and secure his sons release.

 Abdul Mannan Khan, inspector-general (enforcement branch), met the victims family twice in the past 24 hours, requesting them to withdraw the case and give his son a chance to mend his ways. 

 However, Khan, an IPS officer, when contacted at his residence in Salt Lakes AA block, denied comment. The case is before the court, so it would be wrong for me to comment.

 Shahnawaz was produced in the morning in the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court in Barrackpore, which remanded him in judicial custody till September 16. 

 Shahnawaz had followed the woman and her companion while they were returning from a temple on Saturday evening. He grabbed her from behind but the woman managed to jerk herself free.

 The woman, married 15 months ago, has yet to recover from the shock. I was returning home when this man grabbed me. I twisted myself free and started screaming for help, she recounted. 

 The victims family members recalled their meetings with the Khans. He (Khan) requested me to withdraw the complaint and give his son a chance, since this was his first crime, the father-in-law said. 

 Mr Khan acknowledged that his son had committed a grave crime and said he would not speak a word in his defence. He said he was talking to me as a concerned father, added the victims father-in-law. We told him we would not mind if his son was freed on bail, but we shall not withdraw the complaint, he added. What the son did was wrong and immoral. Our fellow residents, too, want us to stick to the complaint.

 As it appears, the victims family cannot take a unilateral decision on withdrawing the complaint because the HA block committee of residents, which is backing the womans complaint, has a say in the matter. In a meeting in the morning, where Shahnawazs parents were present, the HA block committee decided that the complaint filed by the victims businessman-husband would not be withdrawn.

 The block committee said Shahnawaz was not as innocent as his father claimed. We have seen him earlier, making lewd comments at girls. There is a gang operating in the area, said Niloy Ghosh, a resident of the block.

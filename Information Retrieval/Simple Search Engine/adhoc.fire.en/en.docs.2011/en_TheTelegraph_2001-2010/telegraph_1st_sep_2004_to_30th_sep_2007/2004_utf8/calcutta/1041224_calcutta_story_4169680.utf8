The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Creativity amp; craziness

There was dancing, music, fancy moves, creative madness 

and much more at Xavotsav 2004. Madhumita Das caught up with the movers 

and shakers during the three-day extravaganza on the St Xavier?s College campus.

Over two months of intricate planning, organising 

and running around, endless representative meets, a hoarding screaming its arrival 

and finally, it was here. One of the most popular inter-college fests, Xavotsav 

2004, presented in association with The Telegraph, rocked the city between 

December 20 and 22. 

With over 14 colleges participating and over 25 titles 

to fight for, the college scene in Calcutta came alive. Says general secretary, 

St Xavier?s College students union, Sameer Fernandez: ?Our aim is not to foster 

competition or rivalry among colleges. It is a celebration of togetherness and 

friendship.? 

That is not to say that competition took a backseat, 

as was evident by the intense action on the battlefield. While NUJS and Xavier?s 

struggled for top honours in carrom, table tennis, football, basketball, pentathlon 

and debate, Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society emerged victorious in the coveted 

rangoli, impromptu, street theatre and AdMag contests. 

While Antakshari was the most popular event, with 

hostess Tanya, a student of St Xavier?s, handing over the winners prize to Bhawanipur 

College, again. Guest band Dhoomketu entertained the thousand-strong evening crowd, 

leaving them screaming for more 

On Day Two , events like Scrabble, poster-making and 

T-shirt painting, creative writing, fusion instrumentals and western and Asian 

vocals ensured that the brainiacs, painters, designers, musicians and singers 

all had a whale of a time.

The quiz, Bheja Fry, conducted by Suhel Banerjee, 

also a student of the host college, attracted its fair share of audiences, but 

the top draw proved to be the War of the DJs, where DJ Dippi from Bhawanipur College 

scratched and spun his way to victory. 

But how can a fest be complete without the movers 

and shakers strutting their stuff on stage? Day Three unleashed a colourful and 

creative madness, with stunning moves and rocking rhythms in the western and Asian 

dance competitions. Here, too, Bhawanipur College ruled the roost, but not without 

some tough competition from the Xaverians. 

Rock band Insomnia, guest performers for the evening, 

served to quench the thirst of those who like their music loud and hard, doubling 

as eye candy for the scores of girls who couldn?t stop staring at the crooners. 

In keeping with this three-day extravaganza?s spirit 

of celebration and competition unlimited, Xavier?s, the overall winners, passed 

on the title to Bhawanipur College. To top it all, at Beyond Barriers, on Thursday, 

there were singers Sophiya and Shibani, along with Pakistani band Strings, to 

make it a memorable event.

It was a fit setting for the presentation of Pogo

it and then replicate the same on his keyboard.

I have received so far, as this comes from kids ? my real fans.?

The inaugural Pogo Development Fund cheque went to 

Going To School to support the organisation?s efforts to inspire kids to go to 

school. 

The awards will be beamed on Pogo this Christmas Eve 

at 7.30 pm. Catch it or miss out.

Put a smile on their lips 

There is one wish I would like to convey to Santa 

at the last minute ? give gifts to the poor and bring happiness to their door. 

Let them feel the presence of a kindhearted Santa Claus ?dashing through the snow, 

in a one-horse open sleigh?. Let the world rejoice on Christmas Eve. Let the poor 

know there is someone who can bring a smile to their lips, even if it?s once in 

a year.

A dog?s life 

I overheard some children on the road discussing what 

they would ask of you and I learnt that you are Father Christmas and give the 

children what they ask for. So here I am, giving it my best shot. I am four years 

old and I live on the streets. I can?t tell you my name because I don?t have one. 

I sleep on the steps of a neighbourhood building but have to wake up before they 

kick me out. I spend my days scrounging for food and my nights praying that the 

new day brings with it someone who will take me home. But Santa, my wish doesn?t 

come true and I am often beaten up and tortured by the neighbourhood boys. Sometimes, 

I wish I was never born. On behalf of all the street dogs in Calcutta, this is 

one lonesome dog asking you to please find us all a home this Christmas.

Touching little lives 

While everyone is busy celebrating life and partying, 

let?s not forget there are thousands of children in distress. Some don?t have 

a place to stay and spend their lives in slums. I wish someone shows kindness 

to these people. We, too, should play a part in making their lives better. Instead 

of spending a fortune in nightclubs, it would be great if people like us could 

take these kids to our homes, give them food and a gift or two this Christmas, 

maybe woollens to beat the cold. Santa, I also wish that our country could be 

rid of corruption and that crimes like murder, rape, extortion, etc, are eradicated 

from society. I wish all my friends reading this a very merry Christmas and a 

very happy and prosperous New Year. 

Zaki Mubarki

Birthday boy

The only thing I would like to tell Santa is that 

Christmas is one of my favourite festivals. The whole world celebrates it because 

Jesus Christ was born on this day. I celebrate Christmas because it?s my birthday, 

too! What more could anyone ask for? 

Md Tarique Nisar, St Xavier?s College

In the spirit

Christmas brings with it a promise and assurance of 

happiness and fills us with spirituality. My warm wishes to my parents, professors, 

?green? classmates and, of course, to Santa Claus.

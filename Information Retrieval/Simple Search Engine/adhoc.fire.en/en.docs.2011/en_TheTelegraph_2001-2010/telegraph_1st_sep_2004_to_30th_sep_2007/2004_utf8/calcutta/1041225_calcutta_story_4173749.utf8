 Who?s that girl?

 Paz Vega: Served hot 

 She suddenly seems to be everywhere. But who is Paz 

Vega, the stunning face (and more) that?s all over television channels, magazines, 

and of course, the Internet these days?

 Vega?s latest dance in the spotlight is courtesy the recently-released comedy Spanglish. The film, directed by multiple Oscar-winning writer, director and producer James L. Brooks (As Good As It Gets, Jerry Maguire, The Simpsons series on TV), features Adam Sandler in the lead.

 Flor (Vega), a beautiful native Mexican woman, moves in with an affluent Los Angeles family as its housekeeper. Language is obviously a problem between Vega and Sandler (who plays an award-winning chef) and his wife, a stay-at-home mother. The story is about how Flor finds acceptance in the upscale family.

 Paz Vega may be finding favour with the West just recently, but she is already a superstar in her native country of Spain. Born Paz Campos Trigo on January 2, 1976, in Seville, stunning Spanish beauty first dreamed of being a sports star and later took interest in politics before deciding that acting was her true calling. 

 At 16, she left school and after two years at an acting school and another two studying journalism, moved to Madrid. She changed her name to Paz Vega (her grandmother?s last name) and worked in bars while auditioning for acting jobs. 

 After a stint on television, Paz got her first major movie role in Zapping and a minor part in Sobrevivire (I Will Survive), both in 1999. In 2001, Lucia y el sexo (Sex and Lucia) hit theatres, telling the story of an innocent girl who slowly discovers her sexuality. The film became an international hit, winning Paz a Goya ? Spain?s Oscar equivalent ? for best new actress.

Married to Orson Salazar in 2002, Paz lives in Madrid.

Back in time

 A moment from Alexander: Epic extravagance 

?I would give every penny, every single penny I have 

in the bank to see him walk five yards.? An emotionally charged Colin Farrell 

told the Discovery team on the completion of the film Alexander.

 Academy award-winning director Oliver Stone and Hollywood stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie granted exclusive access to Discovery Channel during the making of the epic Alexander. The result is Becoming Alexander, an engaging programme on Discovery Channel featuring exclusive footage from the making of the film and captivating interactions with its celebrated cast and crew.

 Becoming Alexander will premiere on Discovery Channel on Sunday, December 26, at 8 pm. The film is slated to release in theatres across India on December 31.

 Shot before and during film production, the Discovery team went on location to Greece, Morocco, England and France to capture the happening Irish actor?s preparation for and transformation into the role of the conqueror. Farrell?s lessons in Alexander?s speeches and letters, ancient Greek history and lifestyle and rigorous physical and weapon training have all been captured in the programme.

 The show presents discussions between director Stone and Farrell on Alexander?s character and ambitions, to get inside the mind of this leader.

 Raja Balasubramanian, director, marketing, Discovery Networks India, said: ?Becoming Alexander presents Indian viewers the chance to witness the preparation that Farrell underwent in his journey of transformation from a flamboyant Hollywood star into the conqueror of the ancient world.?

 Stone?s Alexander is based on the true story of one of history?s most talked-about leaders, a man who had conquered 90 per cent of the known world by the age of 25. The film takes a close look at Alexander?s relationships with his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), his father Philip (Val Kilmer), his ambitious and beautiful Bactrian wife Roxane (Rosario Dawson) and his trusted general and confidant Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins).

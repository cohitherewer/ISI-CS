 Closure cloud on cinemas

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 After a sit-in, procession and token strike, the final shutdown. The prospect of cinemas downing shutters before the Pujas is looming large with the CESC determined to extract some pending dues from the industry. 

 The Eastern India Motion Picture Association (Eimpa) claimed on Friday the CESC has served a notice (according to an order passed by the Electricity Regulatory Commissioner) asking more than 150 halls within its area to cough up an astronomical amount for the period 2000 to 2004. 

 But this tax is being imposed on the power that we have not used. Power consumption at cinemas is relatively low in winter, as we dont use ACs. So, why should we be forced to pay for that unnecessarily? demanded Shyamal Dutta, member, executive committee, Eimpa.

 The CESC has threatened to snap power lines of all halls that fail to clear the arrears within a 72-hour deadline. So, we have resolved to close shop as it is not possible for us to meet the demands, said Krishna Daga, chairman, producers section, Eimpa. 

 To protest this arbitrary decision, Eimpa will hold a sit-in involving its members and artistes on September 8 near its office on B.N. Sircar Sarani. The issue will be taken up with power minister Mrinal Banerjee and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. A token strike is also being lined up. If all this fails, Eimpa will call for a shutdown before the Pujas.

 Around 35-odd cinemas (falling in the high-tension category) in central, north and south Calcutta will be slapped with the pay-up notices this month. Another 50 halls (in the low-tension section) will be pursued later.

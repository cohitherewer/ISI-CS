 The City Diary

 A fire broke out at a puja pandal in Debpukur, Barrackpore, on Tuesday night. Five fire tenders rushed to the spot, but a portion of the pandal had been gutted by then. Local people alleged that the organisers had not obtained the mandatory permission from the district administration. Repeated complaints to police, too, had yielded no results. Fire officials suspect that an electrical short-circuit, resulting from faulty wiring, caused the fire. The administration has ordered an inquiry.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s conservancy department has cleaned up Babughat, Bajekadamtala and Ahirtala ghats, where most of the city?s idols will be immersed on Tuesday night.

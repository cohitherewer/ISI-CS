The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Snail mail adds to CalTel woes bill

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Even as Calcutta Telephones (CalTel) is busy sorting out technical hitches and meeting the overwhelming demand for CellOne connections, its billing problems have emerged as a more pressing issue. 

 CalTel sources said nearly 150,000 base telephone subscribers have not received bills dated November 10 even after the November-30 deadline. Long queues of customers, seeking duplicate bills, have become a regular feature at CalTel customer service centres and even at Telephone Bhavan. 

 Sources said CalTel has also received innumerable billing-related complaints.

 Officials attribute this to printing and mailing problems. ?There was a problem with bar-code printing, which has been rectified,? said S.K. Bhaduri, general manager (customer services) of CalTel. ?The problem resulted in a rush for duplicate bills. We have extended the due date to December 7.?

 The CalTel sources, however, said there were last-minute delays in implementing the changed plan.

 G.K. Chin, CalTel general manager (finance), said the bills were not received in time due to postal delays, and banks and post offices have been instructed to collect the payments after the due date. ?We have spoken to the persons concerned and things are being sorted out,? he added.

 There are other problems, too. The bills, some of which the customers have started receiving, contain advertisements of free SIM card activation of CellOne till November 30.

 ?We have no idea whether this offer is still open,? said D. Chakraborty, a customer. Hundreds like him have directly approached ministry of telecommunication?s grievance cell to complain about poor services.

 ?In many cases, we do not get any response from the customer care centres,? complained a subscriber. 

 Bhaduri said: ?Around 500 CalTel personnel, mainly from the customer care department, have undergone training on behaviour and attitude changes.? 

 There are also complaints from the 20,000 post-paid CellOne subscribers, many of whom are not receiving bills regularly. ?Subscribers also complain that their accounts are not being updated after payment of bills,? admitted a CalTel official.

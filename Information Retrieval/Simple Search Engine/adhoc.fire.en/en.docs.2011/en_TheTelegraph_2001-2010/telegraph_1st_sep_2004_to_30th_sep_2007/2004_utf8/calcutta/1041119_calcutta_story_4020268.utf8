 Thursday was tiring for Sudipendu Datta. What with having to escort guests up and down the three-storeyed building, talking, explaining and smiling, the 20-year-old had a tough time. But neither that nor his crutches ? his constant companions ? bothered him one bit. 

 For, the 30th foundation day of the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP), formerly Spastics Society of Eastern India, was a special event for Sudipendu and others like Soumen Roy Choudhury, Mithu Das and Joy Ghosh. And nothing mattered more than letting everybody know that they are as good as anybody else outside their institute.

 Mithu Das (16) can speak only haltingly. A dancer who has performed with Preeti Patel, Mithu is the mainstay of the designing and painting platform at IICP. ?I love drawing,? she said, pointing at a bright paper bag with a floral motif. ?From cutting the paper to size and shape, pasting the strips to designing the pattern for decoration, I love each step of the process.?

 Her friend Joy Ghosh, who loves dancing to music from Kaho Na Pyar Hai..., pointed at tie-and-dye cloth on display that he had helped make. Though his teachers claimed otherwise, he teased them saying he loved ?studies much more than painting?.

 From the job-oriented training room to the canteen, it was a festive spirit that put a smile on every child?s face. 

 Bharati Das, seated primly on her wheelchair, had turned out in her best clothes for the occasion. Taking a break from helping with the salad, she said: ?Today we made pulao, chicken chaap, Kashmiri alu dam and many other dishes for our guests... I love cooking more than anything else.?

 Sudipendu, the ?IICP tour guide?, led the way to the computer lab, too. Working at the special machines, the twosome of Barsha Bhattacharya and Shraddha Khatore giggled shyly as their teachers pointed out poems written by them. While Shraddha interacted freely with visitors, Barsha insisted her poetry be read.

 From paintings to poetry, jute bags to greeting cards, dress material to lamps, each product at the exhibition spoke of the ?special? love and effort of the ?special? kids who had made them.

 Also on the celebration agenda are a puppet show and discussion, slated for Friday, while a Walk for Solidarity will wrap up the function on Saturday.

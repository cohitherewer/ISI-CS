 Christmas countdown

IPSITA DEB

December 

25 may be a long way off on the festive calendar but preparations have already 

begun to make it a treat to remember. 

 Fruits and nuts and lots and lots of alcohol marked the beginning of the fruit and nut soaking ceremony to power the Christmas cake at the Taj Bengal on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The practice of soaking fruits and nuts in alcohol for the process of fermentation is a common practice prior to the baking of Christmas cakes. The fruits and nuts were soaked in 50-70 bottles of vodka, gin, whiskey and cognac. 

Actress June and model-turned-painter Piu dropped 

by for their share of the fun (picture right by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). 

The ladies looked their part in the dress code for the gooey gala: chef caps, 

gloves and aprons. ?The entire experience was extremely therapeutic, balmy, and 

well, let?s just say a great feeling,? squealed June. 

 A basic fruit and nut mix consists of cherries, blackcurrants, tutti-frutti, apricots, figs, apples, resins and cashews. After these are soaked in alcohol, spices like cinnamon and cloves are added for preservation. 

 The final additive to complete the process is butter and cream, which aids in fermentation before the entire concoction is stored in wooden caskets for the next 45 days at the end of which the cake is ready to be baked for Christmas.

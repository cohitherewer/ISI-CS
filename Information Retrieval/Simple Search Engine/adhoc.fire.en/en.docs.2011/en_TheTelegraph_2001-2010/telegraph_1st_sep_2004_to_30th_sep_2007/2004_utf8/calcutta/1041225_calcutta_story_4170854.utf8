The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Season?s swig-it-right strategies

The Christmas weekend is upon us (in case you hadn?t 

noticed) and merry-making is the order of the day and night. As you say cheers, 

yet another time, Metro tells you how to avoid the mess after the mayhem.

Avoid the morning-after 

misery:

Drink slowly, taking small sips at a time

Drink a glass of water between alcoholic beverages to reduce hangover-causing 

dehydration

Don?t drink on an empty stomach. Eat beforehand or munch on something to help 

protect your stomach lining from irritation. This will also slow the rate of alcohol 

absorption, reducing risk of rapid intoxication

Don?t binge. You can limit alcohol intake and still feel good

Pay heed to the adage about not mixing drinks. It could confuse the metabolism 

as your body breaks it down at different rates, putting extra load on your system

Consume lots of water the morning after as well to counter the effects of dehydration. 

After the night out, get some fresh air and stick to home-cooked food

Choose your drink judiciously. This could be the difference between mild discomfort 

and debilitating nausea 

Roughly speaking, the darker the drink, the more caution should be exercised. 

Dark spirits generally contain more congeners ? toxic by-products of the fermentation 

process

Teetotallers would be better off opting for fruit juice rather than carbonated 

beverages as the refined sugar content adds empty calories

Get enough sleep. Your body will repair itself quicker during slumber

Though a throbbing head the morning after might tempt you to load up on coffee 

or tea, exercise moderation. Other than irritating the stomach, the beverage won?t 

do much for you. After the caffeine wears off, you?ll feel worse. If your stomach 

is revolting, have some dry toast and plain yoghurt

Have soups and fruits, as they are nourishing and correct the body?s weary metabolism

For headaches, avoid painkillers if possible. They irritate the digestive system.

Eat healthy, party happy:

Go easy on grub while partying hard. ?The secretion rate of digestive enzymes, 

like lipase and protease, are lowered as the day progresses. By night, their secretion 

is lowest and so, the body deals better with a light meal after sundown,? explains 

Moumita Adhikari, a doctor attached to Apollo Hospitals

Cut down on deep fried and spicy food, even if that means passing up mouth-watering 

kebabs and mutton. Fats are hard to break down and, combined with high salt content, 

will serve to sap more fluid from your system

Again, drink water, as it is essential to break down protein, fat, and carbohydrates

Your meal should include as much fresh fruit and green salads as possible. This 

helps combat indigestion, leading to fatigue and headaches.

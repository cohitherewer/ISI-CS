 Hospital set to add wing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals is planning a major expansion. 

 Announcing the mega project, Apollo group chairman Prathap C. Reddy said a three-acre plot on the premises will be used for the expansion. 

 ?We will add another 75 beds to our 350-bed hospital,? disclosed Reddy, adding that the decision was taken by the group?s board. 

 Joshua Goh, vice-president (international operations) of Apollo group partner Parkway Group Healthcare, said there are plans to construct a four-storeyed building. 

 ?We will set up our radiation-oncology unit in the new building, which will eventually be turned into a full-fledged oncology unit,? Goh added. 

 The oncology units in the existing building, such as chemotherapy and onco-surgery, will be shifted to the new building. 

 ?We are working on the details. A feasibility study will be conducted soon,? Goh said.

 He also announced plans for expansion of Bharat Swastha ? Apollo?s group health insurance scheme. The scheme worked well among farmers of Karnataka.

 Chairman Reddy said the group has applied to the Centre for permission. The scheme will cover economically-weaker sections of society through cooperatives.

 Members of the cooperatives will be given a coverage of up to Rs 1 lakh a year. The beneficiaries will have to bear 40 per cent of the annual premium of Rs 150, while the government will bear the rest. 

 ?Any kind of surgery will be covered by the scheme,? Reddy explained. 

 The Apollo group is looking forward to expanding its medical business process outsourcing to the US and UK, clinching tie-ups with companies there. 

 The focus is on the niche area of billing, coding and adjudication. The group is already interacting with partners in the two countries. 

 ?We are talking to companies based in Boston, New York, Atlanta and New Jersey to increase our presence in this sector. Things are really good and it should get better in the near future,? Reddy hoped. 

 The company currently earns a revenue of around US $ 3 million annually, accounting for about three per cent of the total revenue of the group. 

 ?Efforts are on to increase substantially the amount during the next financial year,? chairman Reddy said.

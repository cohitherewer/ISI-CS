The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Ring, ring, ring...

A tool of smut, a vehicle of sleaze... The cell phone 

has been much maligned this week. Metro on Sunday takes a call on how vital 

being mobile is to today?s Calcuttan 

It is his most precious possession, which he balks 

at the thought of giving up. His little black book ? now often silver, blue, or 

even pink ? is always at his fingertips. Professionally, he is at his wit?s end 

without it. He might claim that family ties are stronger with the 12 little buttons 

in his pocket, but mom definitely feels otherwise...

Some people and their cell phones! They have become 

inseparable.

When 58 per cent of young Calcuttans, working and 

studying, teenager to mid-30s, declare in a survey conducted by Mode for 

Metro on Sunday that the tiny (and getting tinier) gadget they grasp in 

their hands has become a lifeline, it is clear that telephony has invaded our 

collective consciousness.

Around 23 per cent reveal they can?t stand to be separated 

from their set, even in the bathroom!

The mobile phone is no longer a tool of necessity. 

For the user, it is a rather dependent relationship of love as much as of need, 

writing its own rules and bringing with it a sense of community. Around 39 per 

cent ranked it their most important gadget, above landlines, computers, microwaves, 

cars and even ousting the TV from its hallowed space in our hearts.

But precious as they may be to our lives, every cell 

phone has still been dropped an average of 6.5 times, admit respondents!

Professional and personal

While all those surveyed agreed that the cell has 

enhanced professional communication, most users ? 98 per cent ? are footing the 

bill themselves. Average monthly billing is still modest ? just above Rs 548.

Again, contrary to the professional benefits most 

claimed, it is friends who are being called and are calling the most. Around 43 

per cent of respondents said they used their cell to call or contact friends the 

most frequently.

If you?ve heard too much about cell smut this week, 

here is some good news. A total 99 per cent of polled users feel their handheld 

has enhanced family interaction, and 98 per cent add that it has completely changed 

the way they interact with family and friends. Most calls made last between two 

and three minutes.

Word versus voice

The common crib point may be that the young are constantly 

SMSing, but most respondents pegged daily text message count at just five.

However, the text format does have its loyalists. 

Around 83 per cent use SMS, with the percentage significantly higher in the student 

category. Over 96 per cent of boys and 92 per cent of girls use it regularly. 

Across all users, 76 per cent admit to having conveyed important information over 

SMS, and 27 per cent recount a spat over SMS.

?Messages are a real convenience. It doesn?t seem 

like an intrusion when you message someone, it doesn?t matter if they are busy 

or in a meeting,? explains a 26-year-old professional hooked to the medium.

But professionally, voice continues to score over 

word, with a majority not preferring to call for business baatein.

For others, it has been a tool to shed inhibitions 

of a sexual nature. Many users report sending or receiving flirtatious or even 

more graphic sexual messages.

The Siemens Mobile Lifestyle Survey 2004 conducted 

in Asia found that 29 per cent of Indians send ?for your eyes only pictures? and 

17 per cent ?like to talk dirty through the phone?. Almost 25 per cent admitted 

to sending messages to wrong numbers to ?meet someone new?.

With so much action happening, it should come as no 

surprise that in Calcutta, around 62 per cent switch off their phones only at 

night.

Tech tide

Calls, however, are still the driver for the business. 

?Acquisition is driven by voice. As we move on, there will be a convergence of 

technology. Right now it is too premature to say if it will become an acquisition 

tool,? feels Kumar Ramanathan, CEO, Hutch (Calcutta).

The Ravirajs may come and go, but cell phone culture 

is still evolving because of changing needs and customer profile as much as emerging 

technologies.

?It depends on the ability to adopt technology, to 

make it more user-friendly and relevant,? adds Ramanathan.

Music is big, gaming is great, video streaming is 

being developed with the 3G wave. For the 12 per cent of respondents who feel 

that a cell phone is a fashion statement, such frills ? the fancier the better 

? are must-haves.

Another focus on growth is cutting across boundaries. 

Mobile penetration is not only widening, it is deepening, with the number of multi-cell 

phone homes on the rise.

?People are going out more often so even housewives 

are on the move,? says Ramanathan. Second ownership is an indication of the spread 

of use for personal purposes, not just business. ?Children under 15 are sometimes 

given phones with outgoing calls disabled to help parents keep in touch.?

Always on call

At the end of the day ? or the beginning ? it?s all 

about accessibility. And the perceived professional benefits are still strong. 

Around 95 per cent of those surveyed actually like being accessible to office, 

all the time. Around 93 per cent feel more in control of their work environment, 

cell phone in hand.

Accessibility has marginal downsides too. Many people 

choose not to take calls and some switch off phones on occasion. It annoys 81 

per cent of users to find a person they are trying to call has switched off their 

phone. For others, it can be a source of anxiety.

?Most visiting cards still don?t have mobile numbers 

despite the fact that it is a clear product enhancement tool,? points out Ramanathan.

For professionals in emergency services, the cell 

is both welcome and worrisome. ?For those in surgery, it takes away concentration 

the moment it rings. But it also makes doctors more accessible and reachable and 

facilitates regular follow-ups with patients in hospital,? feels radiologist Suman 

Sarawgi.

There are a few times when the Calcuttan feels taking 

a call is inappropriate. A reassuring 96 per cent feel it is wrong to talk on 

the phone while driving. Teachers will take heart that 96 per cent say taking 

a call during a lecture should be avoided. During a puja or memorial, 83 per cent 

advocate silence cells. But during parties, social calls and meal times, few raise 

an objection to the ring.

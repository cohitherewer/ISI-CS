 ?I was assigned a bodyguard the last time I was here. That had nearly killed me,? laughed 32-year-old Tao. But that was eight years ago, when he had come to Calcutta to take the stage with ?grandpa? Pete.

 This time, however, Tao Rodriguez-Seeger is back in the city sans his famous relative and ?thankfully?, a bodyguard. 

 Invited by the Indian People?s Theatre Association (IPTA) for a mass song festival, the free-spirit Seeger grandson plans to take a break from the famous Where have all the flowers gone and We shall overcome routine and let ?lesser, deeper songs? to soar into south Calcutta skies.

 Munching on a Monginis paneer puff (?tasty cottage cheese, but a trifle difficult to handle!?) on Tuesday afternoon, Tao took a break from interacting with local IPTA artistes at Nandan IV and held forth on his time in Calcutta. 

 Dressed in a colourful shirt (?designed by mom?), Tao talked of the time he thought ?grandpa?s Spanish was deplorable?. Of how he hated the ?famous being unable to really help the needy? and how the Kerala backwaters had reminded him of the years spent at the Hudson River sloop as crew member, minstrel and environmental educator of schoolchildren.

 ?If you are up on a pedestal, you go places but probably are never able to touch the right place ? the heart. Given a choice, I would love to just roam the streets of this warm city and let it get under my skin,? added Tao, who is currently gearing up for almost non-stop touring all over America scheduled till September 2005.

 ?Tagore inspired Yeats and Yeats inspired our generation,? said Tommy Sands, legendary Irish songwriter and social activist, also in town for the music festival. ?I have collections of Tagore?s poetry which I read slowly to relish the elegance of utter simplicity,? adds Sands, who has been feasting with gusto on maachher jhol and kheer for the past few days. 

 ?I will go back a richer man,? said Sands of his first visit to Calcutta. ?The barrier of language is splintered by music. And Bengali music is much similar to the Irish strains I am used to,? added Sands, who, with Tao, will perform in the Nandan compound on Thursday evening.

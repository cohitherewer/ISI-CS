 Citu forces cop transfer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A traffic sergeant attached to the South 24-Parganas police has been transferred, reportedly under pressure from some Citu-backed unions. 

 Th unions have accused Chapal Banerjee of slapping false cases on drivers of auto-rickshaws, minibuses and taxis and fleecing them.

 Banerjee, who would control traffic in Garia, Jadavpur, Deshapran Sashmal Road (near the Tollygunge Metro station) and adjacent areas, has denied the charges. He says the unions are after him because he has booked quite a few autorickshaw-drivers operating without a licence.

 Superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta said Banerjee was transferred after an inquiry held him responsible for dereliction of duty. 

 He, however, did not specify whether the complaint of forcible collection of money had prompted the authorities to transfer the sergeant.

 Its not true that we had acted against Banerjee after getting complaints from any trade union. We periodically review the conduct of every officer in the force, Gupta added.

 Dilip Das, secretary of the West Bengal Autorickshaw Operators Union, admitted that members had complained against the sergeant. 

 He used to book autorickshaw or taxi drivers and threaten to cancel their licence if they fail to cough up hefty amounts. We have mentioned the name of another officer who worked as Banerjees assistant, Das said.

 The union, he added, had warned the sergeant and his associate to stop such illegal activities, but they did not pay any heed. 

 Das expressed happiness that the authorities had finally acted on the unions complaints and hoped that Banerjees associate, too, would be pulled up shortly.

 Deputy superintendent of police (traffic) S.S. Mukherjee, however, pointed out that the unions often lodge false complaints against officers they consider tough. 

 Whenever an autorickshaw driver is booked for not possessing a licence, he invariably charges the cop with fleecing him, Mukherjee said.

 Of the 2,000-odd autorickshaws plying between Garia and Tollygunge, and between Garia and Gariahat, at least 40 per cent are not licensed, Mukherjee added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 As in previous years, this time, too, Metro Railway gave detailed information 

in some newspapers about stations nearest to big Puja pandals. Undoubtedly, it 

was very useful. However, it said that Netaji Bhavan station is nearer to Maddox 

Square Mukta Dal Puja. This is wrong, as getting off at Jatin Das station was 

much more convenient. 

 Prantik Sanyal, SP Mukherjee Road. 

 On October 14, I went to Dover Lane post office to buy a few stamps. However, 

the person who usually handles the work was absent. Another staff member refused 

to sell me the stamps as he was busy gossiping. Yet another was dying for a smoke 

and found it more important to look for a light. Is this how they should treat 

a customer? 

 Vijay Jain, Nundy Street. 

 A particular tree?s branches have spread in a very haphazard manner near gate 

no. 3 of Writers? Buildings. People get hurt by the gnarled edges of these branches. 

 Abul Fateh Kamruddin, Hooghly. 

 CESC billboards across the city urge people to dial 1912 to report power theft. 

However, when I called up to give information about power theft within 4 km of 

the CESC office, I was asked to divulge my name and address. The complaint cell 

should entertain anonymous informers also if the complaints can be easily verified. 

 Subhamoy Ghosh, Salt Lake.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Inspired to paint

 A sensitive mind can find meaning in the tiniest of fragments that flit in and out of its purview. It is the artist who can, at a later time, fall back on past memories and recreate them in the light of his imagination. Pijush Kanti Bera has had the privilege of having grown up in the midst of a pleasant environment of art and culture, one that has contributed significantly to his growth as an artist. His creations of acrylic on canvas are imposing and dominating so much as to command ones attention and keep it rivetted. The ongoing exhibition is largely inspired by the idea of womens empowerment; the paintings depict the image and identity of women in a contemporary perspective. Bera, through the abstraction of his own perceptions, takes the viewer through a meditative experience as the latter journeys through a canvas of his creation.

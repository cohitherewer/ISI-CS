 Meg Ryan: Rough and tough

 What is Meg Ryan doing in the jungles of Thailand? The Hollywood superstar is on a mission to track down one of the rarest animals in the world ? the white elephant. In the course of her journey, she meets scientists, conservationists and elephant enthusiasts, and learns about the painstaking efforts undertaken to secure the future of Thailand?s elephants.

 Meg Ryan gains hands-on experience as a mahout before embarking on an elephant odyssey into the heart of the jungle. Watch her on Animal Planet interact with local people and animals in pursuit of the magnificent pachyderms, in the CBS original. Catch the tusker tour next Wednesday on Animal Planet Reveals Asia at 8 pm. 

 America?s sweetheart, the successful star of numerous romantic comedies like When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and You?ve Got Mail, is changing lanes in Hollywood at the age of 44. 

 After the turnaround role in the Gulf War drama Courage Under Fire, she appeared last year in the psycho-sexual drama In The Cut. This year, released in the US in August, was Against The Ropes, the fictional film largely based on the life of tough-talking 1980s boxing promoter Jackie Kallen. It?s a classic tale of a woman making it big in a man?s world.

 Next, Meg Ryan is all set to step into the shoes of author Ernest Hemingway?s wife, Mary, in Papa. Playing the spouse of the Nobel Laureate who ended up killing himself after going through depression is not going to be an easy romantic role. In The Land of Women goes to the floors in 2006. Here?s to more of Meg where it matters most: on the silver screen.

Hockey happy: Life beyond cricket

 The Indian hockey team may not be in its best form, but this is one tournament no hockey fan would like to miss. The Champions Trophy that got underway on December 4 is being beamed live on Ten Sports.

 The tournament is one of International Hockey Federation?s most prestigious annual events, where the world?s six top-ranking teams compete in a round-robin format. India, which finished fourth in last year?s Champions Trophy, was invited to participate in the tournament after Australia withdrew for security concerns. 

 India?s best performance in this tournament has so far been third place in the fourth edition at Amstelveen, Netherlands.

 Only four nations have won the trophy in the past 24 years: Pakistan thrice, the Netherlands six times, Australia seven times and Germany eight times. Find out India?s fate, live, till December 12.

Hugh Grant: Saving grace

 There seems to be a concerted effort to clear the cobwebs around infamous murder plots, with The Fuhrer topping the list. Both The History Channel and Discovery Channel have turned the scanner on Adolf Hitler?s scrapes this season.

 The Discovery show, one in the Virtual History series, focuses on July 20, 1944, when Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg plotted to kill Hitler with an explosive hidden in his briefcase. Computer wizardry brings Hitler back to life in a series of vivid archival scenes.

 On December 19, at 8 pm, take a two-hour virtual tour of Hitler?s bunker the day his generals tried to assassinate him and find out how he survived.

 The History Channel?s perspective is broader. During World War II, several attempts were made on Hitler?s life ? the Burgerbrau Beer Hall Bomb in 1939, the human bomb of Colonel Von Gersdorff in 1943, the bomb at the Wolf?s Lair in 1944. Plans were hatched by military dissenters in Germany and the allied forces. The plots either failed or were aborted. Plotting to kill Hitler analyses the attempts on December 12, at 10 pm.

 The assassin(s) did succeed in case of John F. Kennedy. Through detailed analysis of archaeological and forensic evidence, existing photographs, artefacts and interviews of eye-witnesses and experts, Discovery?s Unsolved History reconstructs the events of November 22, 1963. 

 A businessman, Abraham Zapruder, took his 8 mm camera to a local park and shot a 26-second home video that remains the most riveting piece of live film, capturing the assassination. 

 The lenses of 22 other photographers were focused on the Presidential motorcade. In Who Killed JFK?, to be beamed on December 15, at 8 pm, the Unsolved History team speaks to many of these cameramen. Finally, using the available film, a seamless clock is pieced together, inching forward from Kennedy?s jubilant entry into Dealey Plaza to the tragic last moments that changed the fabric of America.

 Forget the fact that Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is a truly painful film. The formerly charming and rather adorable protagonist of Helen Fielding?s books and the 2001 film is back in an inexplicably grating avatar.

 Renee Zellweger has been transformed into a frumpy, nagging, irritating bimbo. Why? It?s not really clear from a flagging screenplay that bears little resemblance to the book. While we respect Fielding?s decision to bring back the cad Daniel Cleaver played by a devastatingly handsome Hugh Grant in part two (though he is absent from the book), few other modifications actually work.

 First, nowhere in either of the books is Bridget fat and ugly. She?s slightly plump and obsessively fighting a losing weight-loss battle. Unless a relatively tall woman of 128 pounds can be considered fat. But she is made distinctly unattractive on screen. Combine this with incessant shrewish, silly behaviour, and you really must question why Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) loves her so.

 The second equally damaging liberty taken in the screenplay was turning the boyfriend-stealing Rebecca, who Bridget is jealous of (with some reason, as it turns out in the novel) into a lesbian. And that too smitten with Bridget!

 Hilarious episodes from the book ? involving Darcy being caught in bed with a Filipino boy, Bridget?s mother?s indiscretions and questionable advice from a Smug Married Friend ? are all left out in favour of a string of humiliating episodes which paint the 30-something neurotic singleton in a less than flattering light. Why would Fielding chop her own bestseller to bits?

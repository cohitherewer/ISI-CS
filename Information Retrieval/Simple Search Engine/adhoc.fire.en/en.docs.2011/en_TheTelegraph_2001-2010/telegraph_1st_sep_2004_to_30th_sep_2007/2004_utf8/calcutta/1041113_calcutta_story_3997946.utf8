The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ticket tussle before toss

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Three rings of security, 40 Radio Flying Squads, more than a dozen senior IPS officers, 4,000-odd policemen, a dedicated control room ? cricket at Eden Gardens is under heavy cover.

 Hours before the India-Pakistan One-Day International ? marking the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) ? the men in uniform moved in to mend the glitches.

 First up, police were stumped by the CAB printing and even starting to sell tickets without taking into account the new seating arrangements. Then there was the problem of distribution of food stalls below each block, followed by the capacity-check of the water to be supplied at the ground.

 The slip-up on tickets came to light when cops were working out the seat arrangements of each block and realised that at least in three blocks tickets had been sold without prior consultation. ?There was a problem since tickets had already been printed and the distribution had begun. But once the cops explained the extent of the problem, we made the necessary changes,? said Samir Das Gupta, assistant secretary, CAB.

 The ?necessary changes?, said sources, were brought about under some strain as the cop line meant a cutdown in not just ticket sales but also complimentary passes. A number of tickets were finally seized and the seating adjustments made.

 Food stalls have been set up below each block and some 3.6 lakh water pouches have been brought in.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, kept posted about all police measures for the high-profile match, could not confirm till Friday evening whether he would be in the VIP enclosure at Eden on Saturday. ?Till now, I have no plans,? said Bhattacharjee, who is scheduled to give away the awards at the end of the match.

 Lawful entry, asserts Mishra

 - Govt working on alternative, will abide by court decision

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government asserted on Wednesday that the admission of students into the MBBS course on payment of enhanced fees under the NRI-sponsored quota was ?correct and lawful?.

 ?I firmly believe that the admission was done correctly and lawfully,? state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra told the Assembly on Wednesday. ?We are awaiting the decision of a larger bench of the Supreme Court. We are appealing that the issue be resolved quickly, once and for all,? Mishra said, amidst a din from the Opposition benches.

 He said the present situation has emerged out of the ?compulsions? of following the Supreme Court order, but maintained that the government would carry out whatever the court orders. 

 The government is also preparing an alternative arrangement ?so that the careers of the 69 students are not ruined,? he said.

 ?We have asked the University of Technology if a new medical-related course at the graduate level can be thrown open for these students,? the minister elaborated. ?An alternative arrangement is being worked out because that, at least, is better than nothing,? he said. 

 Now, the government is waiting for the nod from the academic and executive councils and something positive is expected to emerge soon.

 Explaining the nature of the course, the minister said it would be ?a medical science-related technology?. 

 ?Medical technology is one of the most promising and developing areas now,? he stated, and reacted sharply to the Opposition?s comments saying: ?Your comments make me feel there is no meaning to life if one cannot be a doctor. Many of us here are not doctors, but that does not make us useless??

 Launching a counter-attack on the Opposition, Mishra added that the government intends to have more colleges, medical seats and doctors in the state. 

 ?Merit is our concern and we want social justice on the basis of merit... We intend to work in the system of cross-subsidisation, but you do not seem to want social justice?? he shot at the Opposition. 

 ?The government will be as sensitive to the students? problem as possible,? he promised. The health minister said the government had decided to offer free education to 10 per cent and partially free education to another 10 per cent. 

 And, ?from the concept of social justice?, there was a decision to have 15 per cent enhanced fee-paying seats. He refused to accept it as capitation fee, ?which the government is against?.

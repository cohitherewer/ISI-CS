 Bridging the cultural divide

 The Art Connection is a checkered mesh of different styles resulting in a visual feast of a refreshing order. It intends to provide a rare opportunity to display the works of artists from different corners of the sub-continent who went to the UK on the Charles Wallace and Commonwealth Scholarships in the recent past. The exhibition is aimed at upholding the diverse experiences and fresh ideas the artists have come back with, in order to implicate the winds of change that mark todays art world. The themes at this group show range from urbanisation, socio-political issues, different value systems, environmentalism and the changing role of the woman. The Art Connection underpins the idea that the language of a dominant cultural form like art, being universal, can easily establish a connection between cultures.

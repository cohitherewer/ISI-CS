 Slaughter leaves son senseless

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For 15-year-old Sayan Sen, the sight of seeing his mother being butchered by his father shocked him into unconsciousness.

 The boy is lying senseless for nearly 16 hours, since Saturday night, and doctors fear that if he doesn?t respond to treatment in the next 48 hours, he may slip into a coma.

 Thirty five-year-old Mantu Sen, owner of a car rental agency, was murdered by her estranged husband, Chiranjit, at 10 pm in Topsia, not just before her son but in full view of neighbourhood residents. 

 ?Chiranjit severed Mantu?s head with a boti in front of their only son. Seeing her slump to the ground, Chiranjit fled,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division).

 During preliminary investigation, police have come to know that Mantu and Chiranjit had been living separately in the same locality for the past year-and-a-half. 

 A divorce case is pending before the high court.

 ?Soon after their separation, Chiranjit started living with another woman in a rented house in Mahendra Chatterjee Lane. Mantu, too, got involved with a man who frequented her Lokenath Bose Garden Road residence. It seems Chiranjit could not accept his wife?s affair,? said an officer of Topsia police station.

 According to police, Chiranjit asked Mantu to visit his home as he needed to discuss certain issues related to the divorce case. 

 ?Mantu came with her son. As she knocked on the door, a drunk Chiranjit emerged, holding a boti. He was shouting and looking crazy. Holding Mantu by her hand, he dragged her to one corner of the road. Sayan was standing alone. We were too frightened by Chiranjit?s furious mood to pin him down and prevent the attack,? said Nripen Rajak, a local resident.

 But Mantu resisted, unable to bear the humiliation in public, and tried to free herself from Chiranjit?s clutches. 

 ?At that point, the man swiped the boti and it hit Mantu?s neck. He was then surging towards us. Seeing a drunk holding a sharp weapon, we had no option but to flee,? said Kamal Sheikh, another local resident.

 After 10 minutes, the group returned and found the woman in a pool of blood. Sayan was lying unconscious on the road.

 They rushed him to a local nursing home. Doctors said the boy must have suffered a psychogenic shock, which might have a long-lasting effect on him. ?He may well slip into a deep coma,? said D.J. Bhaumik, under whose care Sayan is.

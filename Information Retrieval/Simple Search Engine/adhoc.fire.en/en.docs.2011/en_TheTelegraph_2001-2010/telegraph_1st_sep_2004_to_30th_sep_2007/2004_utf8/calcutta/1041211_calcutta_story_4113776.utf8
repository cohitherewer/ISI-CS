The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Take-off for cheap flights

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Indias first ?low cost, no frills? airline arrived in Calcutta from Chennai on Friday, with the promise of many more destinations and flights within the next three months. 

 Air Deccan starts off with a daily flight on the Chennai-Calcutta-Chennai sector, with two ATRs connecting the city with the eastern region and the Northeast in January, promised managing director Captain G.R. Gopinath. 

 By February, two new Airbus A320s will fly from Calcutta to Mumbai and Delhi, on fares that are ?25 per cent cheaper than AC first class train tickets?. Captain Gopinath added that while chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had requested him, during a meeting on Friday, to connect Calcutta with towns like Cooch Behar, ?my request was that the government cut tariff and that government officials be allowed to travel by air?.

 He said 50 per cent of Air Deccan bookings are made over phone, via the 24-hour call centre, and online, and with an average load factor of 90 per cent, the airline?s annual turnover was expected to cross Rs 400 crore in March 2005. 

 ?Air connectivity to the bowels of the country is essential for equitable economic growth in India, in terms of trade and tourism. It is not a nation of one billion hungry people to be fed and subsidised any more, but of one billion hungry consumers,? Captain Gopinath said.

 Deccan Air plans include owning 30 Airbuses in the next five years. ?As aircraft and flights increase, the prices will decrease,? he signed off.

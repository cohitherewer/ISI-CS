 Most women look for the traditional touch on Diwali and all the city boutiques and leading departmental stores are now well-stocked with ethnic outfits for the occasion. Here is a run-down on what you can find where:

Intrigue

 This Park Street address has just stocked up upcoming designer Meenakshi Dadoo?s Diwali collection. Texture is her forte, and she plays with various kinds of embroidery, patchwork and prints. Meenakshi uses Indian handwork to embellish her outfits, with styles including ari-tari, bandhej and gota. ?The feel of this collection is very Rajasthani,? explains the young designer. 

 The colours are saffron, red and bright yellow and the dupattas are embellished with typical Rajasthani latkans (colourful woollen pom-poms). The cuts and necklines are classic with churidars to go with the kurtas. 

 Meenakshi also has a range of salwar suits in subtle colours and heavier textures for the more serious buyer. Her jacket-kurtas ? tied across like a Rajasthani angarakha ? are a must check for the more daring buyer.

 It?s the saris, however, that take the cake. With interesting embroidery work on the whole body of the sari, the pallus with zari or patchwork make for great ethnic yet stylish formal wear. Snugly fitted blouses with small sleeves and deep-round necklines add femininity to the creations. 

Palacia

 This Ballygunge Circular Road address, tucked away on the first floor above Veda restaurant, thrives on the USP of affordability. Kumud Maitra, the woman behind the boutique, has been steadily creating ethnic women?s wear for the last two decades. 

 For her Diwali collection, Kumud has a range of silk skirts paired with short tops with Chinese collars and scarves. 

 In bright party hues, these fusion outfits are just right for the young and the young-at-heart. Salwar kurtas with heavy embroidery and patchwork are among the other things that she has on offer this season.

Finesse

 If the earthy feel is what you want to flaunt, Sujata Sarawgi?s handwoven silk saris collected from weavers all over Bengal and Maheshwar are a good bet. The designer has just started retailing her creations from Finesse on New Road in Alipore. Though most of the saris are dyed with natural hues, hand-embroidered and printed, the festive line boasts some zari work on the borders and pallus.

Gauri

 This brand new outlet, the signature boutique of designer Gauri Bajoria on Alipore Road, has loads to offer for Diwali. A range of Indian, western and fusion outfits can capture the imagination of the fashion conscious. 

 The sari that Raima is wearing is a gold-printed georgette. The pallu has terracotta beads with resham and badla work. Gold sequins have been used to add a bit of sparkle to the pallu, in keeping with the spirit of the festival of lights.

Hugli

 This exclusive fashion zone overlooking the river has a host of new lines under the designer labels that it houses. While there is western wear from Jason Cherian, Abraham amp; Thakore and Just Urban, the designer saris of the woven kind spell a lot of ethnic elegance.

 The clothes are teamed with fashion accessories like leather purses in bright colours, bags ? evening or funky ? in cane or cloth, jootis and paper and silk jewellery.

Other addresses

 If you don?t want to waste the precious thousands on heavy ethnic wear you won?t get to wear more than twice or thrice a year, the range of salwar kurtas and Indo-western outfits that have flooded the shopping malls and departmental stores are worth a look. 

 The MNM ? Mix ?? Match ? option that Shoppers? Stop is offering this Diwali is a good way to choose a unique outfit for yourself without the risk of it being a duplicate. Single salwars, kurtas and dupattas can be picked up to make a personalised outfit, which is worth investing time and money in. 

 The megastore also offers lines of winter wear and saris for the occasion. Leather-look long jackets and women?s coats are the high points of the winter collection. 

 The kiddies can choose from a range of ethnic outfits including dhoti-kurtas and dupattas for the little men and ghagra-choli sets for the tiny women. 

 At Pantaloons, it?s both the traditional women?s wear and the working clothes that are selling this season. A new range called Careers for the sharp dresser is the hot thing right now. 

 The traditional touch seems to have got to the young people even as Raas-Leela, a collection of T-shirts, has become a rage among the teenagers. 

 The bonus at this shopping address comes in the form of special gifts for the festival like strolley bags, watches and many more. 

 The timeless chikan work seems to be back in vogue this time around. Colours of India, a brand specialising in chikan outfits ? ready to wear and ready to stitch ? is selling out of their outlets in City Centre in Salt Lake and Vardaan Market on Camac Street. 

 Priced between Rs 500 and Rs 1,500 for kurtas and Rs 800 onwards for salwar suits, the georgette, crepe and cotton outfits are nice picks for Diwali if you like subtle styles. 

 Work clothes are also doing well this season with Cotton World in Forum, which has introduced the Trendy Work Wear collection. 

 The collection starts at Rs 450 for shirts and tops and Rs 600 onwards for trousers. Choose from full-length trousers and capris in cotton, cotton stretch, linen, modal and denim with a lot of styling and embroidery. 

 Linen skirts, paired with stylised shirts or tops, are big hits in the women?s wear section.

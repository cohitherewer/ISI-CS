 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cannot stop talking business these days ? from industry platforms to cinema settings.

 Unveiling the programme schedule for the 10th Kolkata Film Festival ? that gets underway on November 10 with a bouquet of around 139 films from 45 countries ? the chief minister at Nandan on Tuesday was not shy to discuss money matters.

 ?The festival is being put up on a budget of Rs 1.5 crore. Of this, the government will pitch in with Rs 30 lakh. The rest will be taken care of by corporate houses, but in kind. We hope the festival will open up avenues of business,? stressed Bhattacharjee.

 The spotlight this time will be on contemporary film-making across the globe. After Union minister for information and broadcasting Jaipal Reddy unveils the fare at a gathering of actors and directors from India and abroad, the scene will be set for the inaugural film, Sub Terra, from Chile.

 The eight-day-long fare will have a Retrospective on Hungarian director Istvan Szabo, pay Homage to Italian actor Vittorio Gassman, host a Tribute to British director Peter Greenway and arrange Special Screening of French cinema during German occupation. This apart, two other sections will highlight new film-makers from France. 

 While the much-in-demand Indian Panorama is still being worked out, an Indian Select section has been created with a bunch of five films. For the Cinema International section, the organisers are trying to bring in 61 films from 40 countries. Of these, five will be shorts.

 This apart, an exhibition on Pather Panchali is being planned to mark the 50th anniversary of Satyajit Ray?s debut film. ?To give cine-goers a feel of what other film-makers were doing while Ray made his Pather Panchali, 10 Indian and 10 foreign films will be screened,? Bhattacharjee added, with Ray?s favourite actor and festival committee chairman Soumitra Chattopadhyay by his side.

 ?In the 1950s, this film festival gave us the chance to watch the masters of Italian and Japanese cinema. It was from here that we got to learn what acting of international standard means,? said Chattopadhyay.

 A total of 236 shows will be held at Nandan I, II and III, Rabindra Sadan, Sisir Mancha, Chaplin, New Empire and Purbashree in EZCC to accommodate around 1,45,600 cine-goers. The tickets have been priced at Rs 40 and 60.

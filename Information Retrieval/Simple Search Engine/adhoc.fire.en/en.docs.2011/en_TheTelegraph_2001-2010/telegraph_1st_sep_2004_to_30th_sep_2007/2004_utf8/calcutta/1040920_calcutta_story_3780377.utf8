The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bad boy to Gandhian

 John Abraham is pleasantly shocked to learn that even the noon shows of Dhoom are running house-full on weekdays in Calcutta. ?As far as I know, not too many Hindi movies do well there. It is really encouraging to learn that the film is doing so well in the city.?

 The model-turned-actor always knew that he had a winner in Dhoom. ?It is a very young film catering to all ages between four and 60; it has the right commercial mix of action and romance.?

 John had gauged audience response even while signing the role. ?In a Yash Chopra film, the gravity of negativity is much less. It is very heroic in parts. In fact, I have had the audience sympathy going for me with people coming up and saying, ?You shouldn?t have jumped off the cliff? and asking, ?Will you return in Dhoom 2???

 But Dhoom is over and done with and it?s time for John to be mad about Madhoshi, releasing on September 24. ?It is a psychological thriller dealing with schizophrenia. Bipasha has these hallucinations in a post-September 11 scenario and she falls in love with me. It is a beautifully written script but a very complex one.?

 While John feels Bipasha ?has come up with an award-winning performance? in the film, he feels that their off-screen romance wouldn?t have any bearing on the response to Madhoshi. ?Our real-life relationship is much less hyped on screen than many other pairs in tinsel town. And as you can see (see: Fida and Kyun! Ho Gaya Na?), off-screen pairs don?t really matter when it comes to box-office success. The audience can smell a good script these days.?

 So can John, it seems, having signed some if the most happening forthcoming films in Bollywood. ?After Madhoshi, it will be Vikram Bhatt?s Elaan alongside Rahul Khanna, Arjun Rampal, Amisha Patel, Lara Dutta and Mithun Chakraborty. I play the comic element in Elaan, my first brush with comedy. This will be followed by a Priyadarshan laugh riot co-starring Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar.?

 And that?s just the beginning. ?There?s Mahesh Manjrekar?s bilingual Viruddh/Vs where I play the son of Amitabh Bachchan and Sharmila Tagore. Then Karan Johar?s next production Kaal, directed by Soham, alongside Ajay Devgan and Vivek Oberoi.?

 But the one film that John is really excited about is Deepa Mehta?s Water (now titled River Moon). ?If you thought my baddie turn in Dhoom was being versatile, watch me in this pre-Independence film. I play a Gandhian, wearing dhoti-kurta and playing a flute. I also learnt Sanskrit for the film.?

 Ah-men!

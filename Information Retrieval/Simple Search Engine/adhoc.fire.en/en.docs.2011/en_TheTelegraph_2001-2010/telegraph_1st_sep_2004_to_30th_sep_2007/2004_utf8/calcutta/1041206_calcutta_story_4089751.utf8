 A few hundred people in Calcutta were taken by surprise when they received movie tickets for a show at Tantra. 

 The teaser generated enough curiosity to lure in a sizeable family crowd to the night haunt, even though the title sounded rather sinful ? Aaja gunah karle! 

 The Bollywood theme nite at Tantra did witness some steamy fare as promised, which the aunties and uncles clad in saris and churidar-kurtas seemed to take in the right spirit as the kids scurried off to do their own thing. 

 While yesteryear actors smiled back from old Hindi film posters at the entrance, inside, the latest movie moves ruled the floor and the bar-top. 

 Hotting up the packed confines were three bombshells from Mumbai ? Ashiana, Harshada and Shivangi. From remixes of golden oldies like Helen?s Piya tu? to the more recent Choli ke peechche, the dancers grooved to it all and had the crowd begging for much more. The closest the crowd got to sinning was catching sight of a few provocative poses to Choli ke peechche.

 Shyla sizzle

 Upping the glam quotient at Fusion this weekend was sultry model Shyla Lopez, who jigged and mingled with gleeful abandon.

 No starry nakhras, no late entries or snubbing over-excited party people queuing up for autographs and photographs. Shyla was there by 9 pm and stayed on at her socialising best well past the witching hour. 

 Dressed in a haute black number Shyla did a little table hopping to chat with patrons before hitting the dance floor where stags vied with each other to be by her side. 

 ?I was pleasantly surprised when Shyla walked up to our table and struck up a conversation. She spent five minutes with us and then moved on to the next one,? smiled Suraj Jalan, a regular at Fusion, the night club at the Golden Park. 

 But it was the dance floor, which saw Shyla in full form. A self-confessed ?dance freak?, Shyla loves Olive in Mumbai and the F Bar in Delhi. ?I freak out on the ambience of Olive. I wish somebody started something like that in Calcutta,? gushed the swinging siren. She grinned wider when DJ Suraj played Aaja piya tohe pyar doon, a remix number in which Shyla made a sizzling video appearance. The mobile cameras worked overtime to capture the mood and the moment.

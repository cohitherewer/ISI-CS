The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New meats, more shops

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Turkey, quail, rabbit, duck and cockerel ? all set to play a meatier role in the lives of Calcuttans.

 Spurred by the ?overwhelming response? to the ?unconventional meats? sold at three new Suravi stalls (at Entally, New Market and Jadavpur Central Road), the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to open 10 more outlets across the city.

 ?We will open 10 more Suravi stalls in north, south and central Calcutta. These will cater to the increasing demand for the kinds of meat relatively new to the Calcuttan?s taste-buds,? an official at Writers? Buildings said. 

 The meat of quails, turkeys, ducks, rabbits and cockerels is being sold at the three state government stalls for the past two months. 

 ?Quails, especially, have become very popular. People from different parts of the city are flocking to the three stalls for them. So, it?s best to reach out to these people in their neighbourhoods, and the 10 new stalls will do just that,? added the official of the animal resources department. 

 ?When the three stalls were opened, we weren?t quite sure of the response. We were pleasantly surprised with how people have readily accepted the new meats,? he said.

 The new stalls won?t cost the government much, but the benefits are likely to be immense. ?The demand for quail has shot up, making it difficult even to get hold of quail eggs. The demand spurt has, naturally, fetched the dairy owners a good profit,? he informed.

 Each of the stalls requires Rs 50,000 on an average to be set up ? the cost of installing refrigeration and other facilities. Ten stalls mean a total investment of Rs 5 lakh. 

 ?There is no need for any other investment, as many government milk depots are spread across the city, a majority of which are advantageously located. These can serve as Suravi stalls,? the official said. 

 Between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000-worth of products are sold from each Suravi outlet every day.

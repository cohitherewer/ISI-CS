 A 19-year-old girl tried to commit suicide by jumping from the terrace of her school building on Friday. But, fortunately, she fell on a mound of sand.

 ccording to Sanjay Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), the girl decided to take her life because a teacher scolded her in front of her classmates for not completing homework. ?But the scolding was so mild that it should not have led anyone to attempt suicide,? observed Mukherjee.

 he girl fell unconscious after the fall. She was taken to SSKM Hospital, where she regained consciousness after two hours.

 In the evening, she spoke to her mother. Though there were no external injury marks, doctors are examining her to find out whether she sustained any internal haemorrhage,? said Mukherjee.

 Police on Friday traced the abduction of Dipak Pradhan from Salt Lake to a racket involving antiques. Pradhan was rescued on Thursday. Three more persons have been rounded up, taking the total number of arrests in this connection to five. A headless stone figure of Gautam Buddha has also been seized.

 n finding the figure to be fake, the syndicate demanded the money back. Rabi refused. It was then that goons involved in the racket abducted Dipak, mistaking him for Rabi?s son. Rabi, too, has been arrested and remanded in police custody.

Most of the luxury fitness centres around 

town offer exotic exfoliation treatments. Ipsita Deb explores the variety

A long day on grimy, dusty city streets sometimes 

calls for a little more than a bar of soap and a washcloth. Treatments for mild 

to intense exfoliation ? the removal of dead cells from the epidermis to uncover 

smoother, fresher-looking skin beneath ? now abound.

Body scrubs have been on the market for quite some 

time, sharing shelf space with shower gels and other bath products. While some 

do little more than smell delicious, others claim multiple benefits. 

The products, salt-based (for better circulation) 

or sugar-based (gentler than salt), remove dead, flaky patches and enhance blood 

flow to the skin?s surface, resulting in a healthy, revitalised glow. Not only 

do they exfoliate dry skin, they remove dirt and toxins from oily skin.

If you are looking for a more comprehensive skin renewal, 

the professional touch may be what you are looking for.

?Exfoliation becomes necessary when the cycle of cell 

replacement begins to slow down and becomes irregular due to accumulated sun damage. 

Once you see roughness or fine lines, begin including exfoliation treatments in 

your routine every week or two. In today?s polluted world, exfoliation is a must 

for all,? says Rutu Tawade, manager, Solace.

Some scrubs can be used daily, while others that pack 

an extra spa-quality punch should be reserved for weekly sessions at a luxury 

fitness centres in town.

The Park Spa

The poolside spa at The Park offers some tempting 

options. The Crystal Salt Scrub, using sea salts and virgin olive oil, stimulates 

circulation and removes dead skin cells, while the Honey and Coconut Scrub is 

a heady blend of nature used to soften the skin.

A massage with warm coconut oil completes the experience. 

The Papaya and Rose body glow, blending fruits and flowers, gently removes dead 

cells, finished with a light spray of rose water.

On the more traditional side, the Bali Kopi Scrub 

from Indonesia uses an aromatic blend of coffee and clay to deep cleanse the skin, 

while the Javanese Mandi Lulur Scrub, which hails from the royal palaces of Java, 

uses exotic flowers and spices.

 Cost: Rs 500 to Rs 1,200

Sonar Spa

The spa at ITC Sonar Bangla offers less variation, 

but promises quality in its dual range of exfoliating body scrubs. The Aromatherapy 

Salt Glow, a mixture of aromatic scents and mineral salts, nourishes the body 

with nutrients while exfoliating. The Papaya and Rose Scrub, a combination of 

fruit and rose water, ensures soft and scented skin.

 Cost: Rs 1,200

The Oberoi Spa

Here, the skin type is first ascertained before starting 

the procedure of exfoliation. For those with dry skin, the Ginger and Lime Salt 

Scrub is used to remove flaky skin and bring back lustre. The Orange and Sesame 

Scrub is used on normal skin, while the Neem and Sandalwood scrub, a mixture of 

herbs and nutrients, is used to exfoliate oily skin.

The process of scrubbing takes about 30 minutes but 

the package, which includes a refreshing shower and a cup of soothing herbal tea, 

takes nearly an hour. Unfortunately, one needs to be an in-house guest to avail 

this treatment.

 Cost: Rs 1,350

Solace

The fitness centre at Sunny Park offers a considerable 

variety. The Himalayan Floral Scrub, an aromatic mixture of herbs and spices, 

rejuvenates the body, leaving it silky smooth. The exotic Sandalwood Scrub, with 

its combination of honey, sandal, khus and jasmine, promises lighter skin. 

Caf? Au Lait is a wrap combination, rich in anti-oxidants and suitable more for 

oily rather than dry skin. Its benefits include reduced cellulite and inch loss. 

Lavender Body Polish amp; Lightening Souffl? mixes Dead Sea salts with aroma 

to hydrate the body.

 Cost: Rs 600 to Rs 800

Vedic Village

This spa-resort offers a number of options. According 

to them, the process of exfoliation must begin with a wrap and end with an ayurvedic 

massage using herbal oils. The Aloe Vera and Papaya Body Scrub and Dead Sea Mineral 

Mud Wrap (using products imported from Israel), are highly valued for their mineral 

content. The Vedic Mud Wrap and Abhyangan Ayurvedic Scrub, on the other hand, 

are typical Kerala oil massages with herbal oils and scrubs that result in relaxed 

muscles and rejuvenated skin. The Mukha Lepev, a type of Kumkumadithalyam, a special 

form of ayurveda, is used to cleanse only the face with the use of amla and 

herbs.

 Cost: Rs 800 to Rs 1,800

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government plans to set up a market complex of global standards at Kumartuli, in north Calcutta, to attract foreign tourists, as well as to protect about 250 artisans who eke out a living by making clay images.

 With the chief minister taking the initiative, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is going ahead to develop the proposed complex. We are carrying out a survey, says Sudhanshu Sil, MP and a senior functionary of the CMDA. 

 The findings are expected to be in by the middle of September. We are considering a proposal to utilise funds from the Megacity Project to implement the plan, he elaborated.

 On Tuesday, Sil, CMDA director (physical planning) Nitis Som and other senior officers met and discussed various aspects of the project.

 About 250 artisans live in Kumartuli, making a living by producing clay images of gods and goddesses. They earn well only during the Pujas, but for the rest of the year, they lead a hand-to-mouth existence, for they find it difficult to get work. 

 Kumartulis artisans are famous across the world. These artisans dont get the opportunity to sell their products abroad, as they dont know how to market their wares. We are going to establish an international market to help them sell their products abroad, and to corner the domestic market throughout the year, Sil said.

 It is not possible to set up a market of international standards in the narrow and dingy lanes and by-lanes of Kumartuli. The roads will, therefore, be widened. Adequate drinking water will be provided there and arrangements for public urinals will be made before starting construction, a senior CMDA official said.

 The artisans will not be displaced from their existing workshops and homes. Those engaged in the trade will be accommodated in the proposed complex. Small gardens will be laid out in front of artisans workshops in the proposed market complex. 

 Babu Pal, secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskriti Samity, welcomed the state governments plan. Three years ago, we had organised an exhibition of our products in Kumartuli. But we could not continue for want of funds. The exhibition was closed within a day or two of its opening. Now, we are happy that the state government is planning to develop Kumartuli, Pal said.

 We are ready to diversify. We will, of course, manufacture idols of gods and goddesses during the Pujas. But we may also manufacture clay utensils and other products and sell these, Pal said. 

 It is learnt that the state government will set up a ceramic unit in Kumartuli after the market complex is ready.

 CU fake papers seized

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The forged marksheet racket, with links as far as Bihar, led to the arrest of two persons at a correspondence college in Lake Town on Wednesday. 

 Apart from issuing certificates of different universities, the college would also provide fake marksheets of Calcutta University (CU) ? a revelation that has rattled police. 

 Since the original complaint on May 24 with Jorasanko police station, this is the first time that the inter-state crackdown on fake marksheets has yielded ones bearing the stamp, symbol and name of CU. 

 The raid yielded 20 such marksheets, besides others from different universities such as Magadh, Ranchi and Patna. Besides, a fake CU rubber stamp was impounded from the college. 

 ?We are not willing to take chances. The marksheets will be sent to CU for verification,? said Peeyush Pandey, city detective chief. 

 Ashoke Chaudhury (45) and Nandini Roy (38) were arrested at South Calcutta Correspondence College, in Lake Town, taking the total number of arrests in the forged marksheet case to eight. 

 Earlier, kingpin Sukhdeo Kumar was rounded up from the Budhmarg area of Patna, along with key accomplice Sanjay Sharma from Kankarbagh.

 Besides fake marksheets, police seized migration certificates, admit cards and provisional degree certificates of various universities from the college. ?The charge would vary between Rs 2,000 and Rs 20,000, depending on the type of certificate. While Nandini was the business partner, the house belonged to Ashoke Chaudhury,? said an officer.

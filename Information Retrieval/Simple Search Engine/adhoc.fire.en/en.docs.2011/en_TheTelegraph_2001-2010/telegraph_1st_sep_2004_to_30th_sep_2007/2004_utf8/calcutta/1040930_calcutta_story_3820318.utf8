 Take your pick from an exotic platter? The Arayess (deep-fried lamb sandwich), Sambusek (triangular pies filled with meat, cheese or spinach) or Kabsa (a classic Arabian dish of meat mixed with rice). Round it off with a helping of Baklawa (a sweet dish of layered pastry filled with nuts and steeped in honey-lemon syrup).

 A slice of sheikhdom to titillate taste-buds in Calcutta is very much on the (menu) cards for a clutch of city eateries ? from Grain of Salt to Bar-B-Q. They have all been floored by the ?sheer variety and quality? of Arabian cuisine showcased at a hospitality summit in Dubai earlier this month.

 Over 50 delegates, mostly from the restaurant trade in town, attended the 40th convention of the Federation of Hotel amp; Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) in the Emirate city, and many are keen to launch a few of the mouth-watering dishes from West Asia on their own skewers or sigris.

 ?Dishes like the Iranian Sheesh Kebab, Patthar Gosht or the Fish Musallam (cooked in a unique way on stone, layered with foil and leaf), would suit the city palate perfectly,? feels Nitin Kohli, director, Grain of Salt.

 The Sanjeev Kapoor-signature world-cuisine stop at 22, Camac Street is gearing up to add a whole new line of West Asian items to its eclectic spread, with options like the Baklawa, Fattoush (a salad of toasted croutons, cucumbers, tomatoes and mint) and kebabs.

 Kohli and the restaurant?s administration head Pankaj Tandon have brought back recipes of a number of speciality Gulf dishes for the chefs to work on.

 Not just Grain, the heady aroma of zaattar (a blend of Arabian spices including thyme, marjoram, sumac and salt), has got others excited as well. ?The taste and texture of their kebabs are absolutely out of the world and we hope to introduce some of the items on our menu card,? says Bar-B-Q?s S.S. ?Baba? Kothari.

 Peter Cat, which has been serving its signature Iranian dish Chelo Kebab (with a slight twist to match the city relish) since 1975, is also inclined to take a deeper plunge into the taste of Arabia. 

 ?Since palate preferences are so similar, it?s only a matter of time before Calcutta embraces Middle-East food with gusto,? says proprietor Nitin Kothari.

 ?Dubai was an eye-opener and the novel tang of their kebabs and the hommus dip ? a pur?e of chickpeas, tahina, lemon and garlic ? should be a huge hit in Calcutta,? adds Sunny Puri of Trincas.

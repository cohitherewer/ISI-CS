 Home guard Ajit Guha: Only pats and promises

 In October 2003, Ajit Guha, a home guard and the sole breadwinner of a family (comprising a cancer-stricken wife and two children), had found a bag containing Rs 1,26,550 while on traffic duty. He returned the same. For this extraordinary act of honesty, he got a pat on the back from the police commissioner and a bag full of empty promises.

 In December 2004, Guha is still struggling to make ends meet with a daily income (no-work-no-pay at that) of Rs 107. His wife, Parbati, is mostly confined indoors as she battles the disease. College-going daughter Dalia, who has already undergone two heart surgeries, is struggling to carry on with her studies.

 The bag of notes Guha found while managing traffic at the crossing of Rabindra Sarani and Sun Yat Sen Street added up to four years? earnings. He promptly returned it, only to be inundated by a wave of acclaim. But nothing has changed since.

 A day after the incident, the office of civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee assured him the post of a constable and promised to bear his wife?s medical expenses. But nothing has moved. Guha continues to travel 60 km to the city from Gobardanga for duty every day. And Parbati continues to be treated by a homoeopath in Gobardanga, as that is all they can afford.

 Promises from welfare organisations have proved as empty as those from the government. ?Someone from a welfare organisation promised to bear the expenses for Dalia?s studies. He gave me his card. I rang him up several times and even went to his office. But I could not trace him. I was hurt,? says Guha.

 The one promise that was kept was by Tej Pratap Singh, the businessman whose money Guha had returned. And how! Singh had pledged a pair of chappals each to the four-member Guha family and had kept his word.

 Yet, Guha is not a bitter man. ?I haven?t done anything extraordinary. If such an incident occurs in future, I will react the same way. I am not bothered about help from others,? Guha told Metro, before boarding a crowded Sealdah-Bongaon local at Sealdah station and melting into the crowd.

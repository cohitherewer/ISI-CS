 The woman who can look and feel like a goddess. The one who believes in herself above all else and carries her attitude packed within the layers of fabric she has draped about her. The one who can ?stumble out of a swamp covered with leeches and still look like a million bucks.? 

 That is the woman for whom Kiran Uttam Ghosh has designed her Autumn Winter 2004-5 collection. And she needs not a fat wad of cash to get the look she wants.

 ?Like the smoke signals that each clan had and the claws they wore, clothes are essentially a form of giving clear messages of who you are. It?s about making a statement, of knowing your mind. It?s individualistic, the belief in self and the confidence to carry forth personal style with panache, an unobtrusive show of strength,? is how Kiran interprets fashion with this line.

 The collection is reminiscent of a gypsy, who collects leftover pieces of metal or colourful threads along her way. Within each of Kiran?s outfits lie several layers of different scraps of fabrics, unusual colours merged together and unorthodox embellishments to top them off.

 In varying degrees of turquoise, lavender, red, white and black, she has created a nomadic look with ponchos and bead-edged stoles.

 Having combined layers of fabric printing with hand embroidery, beads and subtle sequin work, the outfits have a mystic identity of their own.

 ?I am usually known for my neatness and attention to detail. Having established myself in the safe-clothes category, I feel it is time to make the transition to a more individualistic style ethos for the spirited woman, the one who can strike a wager or take a risk. I wanted to create this distressed bohemian with not an ounce of wealth on her but who is yet as beautiful as one can get,? says Kiran. 

 Long coats, slim-shaped skirts and flowing ponchos are the highlights here. With detailed prints and over prints, long-textured collars, low-waist skirts, ruches and flounces, Kiran has created an exclusive fashion mantra for the woman with attitude.

 The drama will unfold at the Blenders Pride Fashion Fringe on Friday night at Tantra. With ensembles from Suneet Verma, Rina Dhaka and Shantanu and Nikhil also in store, the show at The Park promises to flaunt not just fashion, but a philosophy too.

 Ethnic appeal

SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

A 

brand new address for quality designer wear opened its doors to fashionistas on 

Sunday afternoon with a star-studded inauguration boasting names like film-maker 

Rituparno Ghosh, actress Pallavi Chatterjee and actor Biplab Chatterjee.

 Sana, a studio stocking salwar suits and tops by designer Chhuti and saris and accessories by Madhuri Agarwal, opened on the first floor of 7B Palm Avenue. 

 While Chhuti has been around on the city fashion map for the past few years, Madhuri, the proprietor of Sana, made her debut by launching her first line on Sunday under her eponymous label.

 Salwar suits and party tops by Chhuti bear traces of her trademark style, which includes use of vegetable dyes and various forms of embroidery. Kantha stitch has traditionally found prominence in her work, but this time she has concentrated more on applique and patchwork techniques with residual fabric. The result is a range, mostly in black and white, with colourful patches of fabrics put together in floral motifs. Other craft forms like tie-and-dye and embroidery have also been used extensively. 

 Chhuti chooses to work with a variety of fabrics that includes everything from crepes, georgettes, chiffons to handloom cotton, matka and kathia (varieties of silk) and khadi. The line is priced between Rs 500 and Rs 5,000.

 Madhuri?s debut designs on the other hand comprise saris in lighter fabrics like crepes, georgettes and light silks, with a sprinkling of sequins alongside block and gold prints and embroidery. The range starts from Rs 1,900 and goes up to Rs 15,500.

A line of stoles and pashmina shawls, priced 

from Rs 350 onwards, can throw up ideal party picks for the winter months. 

 However, what steals the show in this young designer?s kitty is her range of shoes ? slip-ons and sandals. Priced from Rs 395 onwards, the coloured leather sandals come with funky embellishments like stones and sequins and can be teamed with any outfit, from saris to western wear. 

 ?I have known Chhuti for many years now and have always 

been very fond of her clothes. So, when I decided to open a boutique, I wanted 

to rope her in,? said Madhuri.

 Up next at the store will be a line of well-cut trousers teamed with kurtis from Chhuti. ?In my next collection the focus will be more on cuts, rather than surface ornamentation. Abstract but wearable cuts are what I want to experiment with,? revealed Chhuti, visibly excited with the response from Rituparno Ghosh. ?He came sporting a shawl designed by me and has now ordered a jacket to be made in the same style as a black top he fancied,? smiled Chhuti.

 Kid comfort

 Now you can dress up your children to match your glad rags at the newly-opened kid?s boutique Back in Town on Justice Madhav Chandra Road (facing Northern Park). It has a range of branded and specially designed outfits with an international look. 

 ?We are aiming to attract the attention of children below the age of 10 and of course, their parents,? said owner Namrata Bajoria.

 Well-known Delhi brands like Petals, Citylook and Fragrance can be found here, offering an assortment of T-shirts, denims, pants and dresses in a variety of colours, styles and designs. Cotton is the only fabric used, keeping in mind the comfort factor of the little customer. 

 Stationary and a number of gift accessories are also available. Pricing is competitive with clothes starting at Rs 100, bags at Rs 350 and shoes at Rs 400.

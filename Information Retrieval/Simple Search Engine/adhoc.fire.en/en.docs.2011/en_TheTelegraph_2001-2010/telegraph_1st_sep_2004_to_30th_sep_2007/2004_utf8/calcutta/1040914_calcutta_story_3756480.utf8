 PRIYADARSHINI ROY

Priyadarshini Roy

Twinkle toes...

Is this 20-year-old. Darshi (as she is known to friends) started 

learning Odissi at age three from her mother and guru Dipanwita Roy. Her first 

public performance was at age four, and at six she made her solo debut on Doordarshan. 

She has since performed at numerous cultural functions in India and abroad, including 

in the UK, France and Sweden. Her best memories are of dance demonstrations and 

workshops with schoolchildren. 

Prize list...

Of this Ashok Hall ex-student is long and endless, especially with 

participation in western dance and music contests in fests. Received the Siranama 

Award in 2001 for being an upcoming dancer of extraordinary talent. Awards in 

art and trophies for basketball are also in the cupboard of the former house captain. 

The second-year economics honours student of JU is also on the college basketball 

team. Her favourite hobby ? experimental dance.

Way with words..

Laily has. Stood first in the all-India Discovery Channel essay 

competition. Has several accolades for creative writing, public speaking, elocution 

and debating under her belt. Has also trained in Indian classical and Rabindrasangeet 

since seven. As a member of the school Interact Club, Dorji (a nickname she acquired 

for her stitching skills) she has lent a helping hand for numerous community service 

projects. And of course, in keeping with her motto of trying everything once, 

she?s also taken up acting. In 2002, Priyadarshini won the best performer award 

in the SKM Dramatics Competition, ?What Did You Say??. The school team stood second.

Dream team...

FBI. That?s what the girl from Turf Road has her heart set on. Plans 

are for an MBA after graduation and then off to the FBI Academy. And she?s sure 

to dazzle, with her skills as much as her intelligence. An 85 per cent in CBSE 

and 81.3 per cent in the Class XII board exams, first in high school in journalism, 

commercial art and elective English... she?s as good as it gets. For now, catch 

her on DD, occasionally announcing the National Programme of Dance.

 ?Aliens? to blame for malaria spate

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Aliens are posing a problem for mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who has come up with a solution seemingly inspired by Sukumar Ray?s nonsense rhymes.

 He wants the city to don a mosquito net to ward off the ?alien? creatures, whom he holds responsible for the spate in malaria cases.

 ?So far, Calcutta-based mosquitoes have been our concern. We have taken up enough programmes to tackle that problem. But what can we do if migratory mosquitoes enter the city and bite the people?? This was stated by the civic authorities, in all seriousness, in an affidavit in response to an earlier order of Calcutta High Court. The civic authorities demanded a solution from the judges. 

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) commissioner Debashis Som, in the affidavit, expressed his inability to combat the migratory menace.

 ?In this affidavit, we have clearly mentioned that the civic body has already taken steps to finish off city-based mosquitoes. Our continuous efforts to make citizens aware of malaria have got a good response. Calcuttans are now well-informed about the tactics of tackling mosquitoes,? said CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh, who handed over the report to a division bench of the court.

 He added: ?We have disclosed our problem. We are not bothered if we are ridiculed for speaking the truth. The problem can only be resolved if the city can be covered with a large mosquito net. The civic authorities cannot go beyond their jurisdiction to destroy the mosquitoes.?

 The case relating to malaria in Calcutta will come up for hearing on Friday before a division bench, presided over by acting Chief Justice A.N. Roy. 

 Pradip Roy, advocate of Calcutta High Court, moved the petition charging the civic body with having failed to tackle malaria, and that consequently, hundreds of people were dying of the disease every year. 

 Roy complained that the mayor had not kept his promise to set up an exclusive malaria hospital in Kalighat.

 ?In its affidavit, the civic body told untruths to the court. It has said that the proposed hospital building needs some repairs. But the fact is that the CMC had issued a countrywide tender for building the hospital and also received responses. However, the mayor, for some unknown reason, did not proceed further,? Roy alleged.

 He has threatened to bring up the matter in court on Friday.

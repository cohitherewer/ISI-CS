Mario mania 

 Those old enough to have played Super Mario on cartridge games, this one?s 

for you. Watch the brilliant Rise of the Mushroom Kingdom at www.videogame 

dc.com (?dc? as in director?s cuts). This three-part Flash movie (the eagerly-awaited 

fourth part is due shortly) chronicles how the inhabitants of the Mushroom Kingdom 

? the fantasy land where Mario games are based ? rise to avenge the death of Mario. 

Created by youngster Randy Solem, the movies feature the Mario games landscape 

and characters, including Mario?s twin Luigi, Princess Peach Toadstool, the turtles 

and their evil ruler King Bowser Koopa. Solem?s creativity is impressive in the 

visuals and soundtrack. There are around 40 other movies on the site, including 

Mario?s Accident, Mario Gets Lucky, and some based on other classic 

Nintendo games like Sonic, Zelda and even Donkey Kong. The 

game cartridges may have given way to CD ROMs, but their legacy lingers in the 

minds of die-hard fans.

Brave face

 Shapoor 

Khan is 13 years old, but he already knows all about the harsh realities of life. 

When war arrived in Afghanistan in 2001, his family fled to Pakistan to survive. 

On the way back home after the war, Shapoor stepped on a landmine and lost his 

left leg. He was given an artificial limb in 2003 by an orthopaedic centre run 

by the International Committee for Red Cross in Kabul and was taught to walk using 

it. His father said Shapoor, who wants to be a physician when he grows up, put 

up a brave face in public glare but sometimes cried at home.

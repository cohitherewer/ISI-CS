The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 She made a splash with her very first film. Anubhav Sinha?s Tum Bin saw Sandali Sinha (picture right) torn between three men and scoring a hit at the box-office. But after that sparkling debut, Sandali somehow lost out to the law of Bollywood averages and couldn?t woo the audiences with the non-starter Om. Even Pinjar, which found her in an effective cameo, couldn?t salvage her standing at the turnstiles.

 But that is a thing of the past. Sandali is now all set to hit a high note in tinsel town. The girl who couldn?t move to Mumbai due to personal problems earlier has finally landed up in big, bad Bollywood, bag and baggage.

More importantly, Sandali has just finishedshooting 

for Anil Sharma?s big-budget multi-starrer Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyon. 

The patriotic film which boasts of the Amitabh Bachchans and Akshay Kumars has 

Sandali playing the love interest of Bobby Deol, who himself is making a comeback 

of sorts after a long hiatus.

 Sandali is very excited about the new developments in her personal and professional lives. ?Whenever I have come to Mumbai, I have come without work and by God?s grace I have always started work within five days of landing in the city. This time, I have chosen not to take my good luck for granted and give my 100 per cent to the films that I have had the fortune to work in.?

 Ab Mumbai ke hawale Sandali saathiyon?

Preity Zinta: Love bugged

 MTV has gone all mushy. The channel of and for the youth all of Tuesday, September 22, as Yash Raj day to mark the launch of the new music label Yash Raj Music. Through the day, as a 24-hour event, the music channel played songs, scenes and even unseen footage from Yash Chopra productions. Everything from Silsila and Kaala Patthar to Hum Tum and Dhoom were showcased in a way never seen on the small screen.

 The songs and scenes were punctuated with promos of Yash Chopra?s new romantic saga Veer-Zaara starring Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee. In fact, till the release of the film on Diwali Friday, November 12, MTV will continue to beam bits of Chopra magic, every day at 9 am and 6.30 pm.

The film has also seen an unprecedented count of pre-ordered albums on the Net. The music of Veer-Zaara has been scored by the late Madan Mohan and features the likes of Lata Mangeshkar, Gurdaas Mann, Jagjit Singh, Sonu Nigam and Udit Narayan.

Tintin, Snowy and Haddock: Three much 

 If watching TV during the Puja holidays just meant catching the Feluda movies ? yet again ? on DD Bangla, this year promises to be different for kids. The adventures of another favourite sleuth are scheduled to go on air this Puja on Alpha Bangla. Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock will debut on October 17 with The Crab with the Golden Claws gang mouthing animated lines in Bengali.

 And if you think hearing the fearless reporter (with the world?s most famous tuft) of Le Petit Vingtieme say ?Shabdhan, or kachhey bonduk achhe? is odd, you?re obviously not an Anandamela reader. For, generations hooked on to the Bengali magazine have been introduced to Herge?s most popular work in Bengali. Alpha Bangla, in fact, will adopt the Anandemela name changes, too. Thus, Snowy will be Kuttush, Thomson amp; Thompson will turn into Johnson amp; Ronson and so on.

 Herge ? a pseudonym for Georges Remi?s initials (?GR? in reverse ?RG?) ? had actually published the first-ever Tintin adventure (Tintin au Pays des Soviets or Tintin in the Land of the Soviets) in Le Petit Vingtieme, where he worked as an artist.

 The series to be screened on Alpha Bangla has been dubbed directly from French to retain the originality and the dubbing do has been a completely in-house affair for Alpha Bangla. Production is almost complete for the first set of episodes that will feature Cigars of the Pharaoh, The Secret of the Unicorn, The Blue Lotus, The Black Island and The Calculus Affair.

 The half-hour show will be on air every Sunday at 10.30 am and is expected to run for ?at least one year?.

 Alpha Bangla?s sister channel Zee English had been airing the Tintin series for sometime, but the good news for the fans of the redhead is that the Bengali episodes have not been beamed before.

 Will the BJP?s twin poll generals Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti be able to face up to the combined might of the Sonia Gandhi-Sharad Pawar combine? For whom will October 13 prove to be the unlucky day almanac-makers have pronounced it to be? The Maharashtra election is the theme for a storm in many a teacup even in far-off Calcutta as it is the first electoral battle of the Big Two since the Lok Sabha encounter.

 Focusing its camera on the frontline is STAR News with two on-ground initiatives as part of its coverage of the Maharashtra elections to reach out to the masses that matter. Two teams drive the Maratha Express to towns across Maharashtra, presenting detailed reports on each town, its history, its culture, the problems faced by the people, political developments and chats with them and their local leaders. These reports are being aired daily at 6.30 pm as part of the series Maharashtra mein Mahabharat.

 STAR News has also rolled out three vans for the show Kaun Banega Mukhyamantri that will cover 89 towns. Interactive games are played in these vans giving people the chance to participate in contests based on the elections, which will carry prizes. The vans air the channel and bring people up-to-date election coverage. Information on debates to be conducted in specific towns is also spread through the vans, encouraging people to participate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Three cheers for fun and froth November date

IPSITA DEB, MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

If 

you need an excuse to do a bottoms up, here?s one as good as any. A guzzler?s 

delight, Oktoberfest has travelled all the way from Germany to Calcutta. Although 

a measly one-day affair as opposed to more than a fortnight of non-stop fun and 

froth, the event on November 3 at the banquets, Taj Bengal will pack in unlimited 

alcohol and authentic German foods and accompaniments like pretzel sticks, Leberkaese 

(meatloaf with fried onions and eggs), Bratwurst (chicken and pork sausages) and 

Brathendl (roast chicken), to name a few. And all for Rs 900 per head. A host 

of vegetarian items have also been included, keeping Indian tastes in mind. 

 A 21-piece original Bavarian brass band will keep up the Oktoberfest tempo on the November night. 

 Munich?s first Oktoberfest ever was held in 1810 to celebrate a royal wedding with horse races and culinary delights. Since then, the Munich beer festival (as it is often referred to) is held annually. Though called Oktoberfest, the festival actually takes place in September, as early cold and snow are not uncommon to a Bavarian autumn.

 ?Germans are usually considered to be rather serious, however, we know just how to eat, drink and be merry when the time is ripe for it,? said German consul general Erhard Zander at the Taj Bengal to announce the city leg of the celebrations.

 In 1997, Oktoberfesters consumed more than 5 ? million litres of beer, about 45,000 litres of wine, and almost 165,000 litres of non-alcoholic beer. Calcutta?s appetite remains to be seen.

 Taste of India

 Gucchi, the Indian speciality restaurant at the Hyatt Regency, has a revamped culinary offering for Calcutta. And not only has the menu changed as part of the institutional policy to inject life into its destinations every three to six months, the ambience has been modified to bring in a more Indian look.

 ?While the interiors of the restaurant remain largely the same, we have updated the service style and table presentation in keeping with feedback from our clients,? explains general manager Timothy Bruce. So copper handis have replaced the white porcelain dishes and Indian artefacts greet visitors at the entrance, not wine bottles.

 This also marks the entry of a new hand behind the food. Chef Anil Khurana has taken over as corporate chef for the chain?s Indian properties. ?We are trying to turn our restaurants into brands,? added Bruce. 

 Bhutte ke Kebab (tender baby corn coated with potato and bell pepper), and Tandoori Jhinga are succulent examples of new starters on the Hyatt platter.

 New entrants in the main course include Paneer Gulistan, which marries spinach and cottage cheese in a yellow gravy, and Gosht Kofta (lamb dumplings in an aromatic saffron gravy), both of which are worth a try.

 If you want to do justice to the extensive menu, you can opt for the gourmet meal option, which allows patrons to choose two starters, three main course dishes, bread, rice and raita. It comes at Rs 650 for vegetarians, Rs 900 for non-vegetarians per head, with extra charges for prawn and lobster.

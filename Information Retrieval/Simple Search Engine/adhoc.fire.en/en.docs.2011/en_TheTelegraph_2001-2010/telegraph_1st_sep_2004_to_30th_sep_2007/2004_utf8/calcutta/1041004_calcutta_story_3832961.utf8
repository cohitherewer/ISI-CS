The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A vanishing act

 Modern society has undergone degeneration of values to such an extent that relationships are founded not on emotion but on opportunism. Pratikritis Kenaram Becharam (story: Manoj Mitra) explores this problem in a humorous vein, at the same time drawing attention to the urgent need to reform growing decadence within the institution of the family. The play begins with the disappearance of Becharam Chatterjee, the patriarch of a large family. This sets off a chain of absurd incidents in which his family members start bickering about sharing his wealth, instead of setting out to search for the missing man. An imposter, Kenaram, makes his entrance into the household, declaring himself to be Becharam, which is accepted by the family in the hope that it might make it easier for them to lay their hands on Becharam?s wealth. The plot reaches its climax with the sudden reappearance of Becharam, who provides a surprising denouement to this delightful social comedy. Direction: Alok Deb.

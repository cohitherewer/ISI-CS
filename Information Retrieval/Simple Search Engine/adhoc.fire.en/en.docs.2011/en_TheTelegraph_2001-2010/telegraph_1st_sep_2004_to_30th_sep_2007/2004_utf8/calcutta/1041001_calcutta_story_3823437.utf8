The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mumbai masala on style street

IPSITA DEB

 The second edition of The Park?s new style series titled Hi Street Fashion, to be held at Tantra tonight, is set to be a real scorcher. And the main draws this time are some of the catwalkers who will be parading on the bar-top at the nightclub. 

 After all, it?s not everyday that one gets to see some of the hottest babes and dudes of the country (read Katrina Kaif and Upen Patel) on the same ramp. 

 The designs to be displayed promise to be no less glamourous. Designer Narendra Kumar from Mumbai is ready to unleash some Mumbai ishtyle funk on the ramp. ?My so-called muse is the woman of Mumbai. The one who works hard, parties harder and then gets ready to wake up early the next morning and get back to work again. Who can be a better inspiration than that?? asks the designer. 

 The man who started off designing for Tarun Tahiliani has come a long, long way. Today, he has his own label that retails at exclusive outlets abroad. His Aye Aye Yo Disco Disco collection at the Lakme India Fashion Week this year created waves in the fashion circuit, what with the women?s line inspired by a perspective on the American outsourcing phenomenon and its effects on a whole new generation of south Indians. 

 With his first ever showing in the city, Kumar expects to win over the traditional and the GenX alike. He feels the audience here can appreciate both ?international styles as well as the rich heritage of handiwork and textiles?. 

 Speaking about his collection for the show, the designer reveals: ?My show will be like a story of these extraordinary working women. Life is hectic, especially in a city like Mumbai and they barely have time to sit back and spend hours beautifying themselves. With life the way it is today, Calcutta too will surely but steadily evolve into the fast-track soon. In this collection I am paying a tribute to all such women, the women of today and tomorrow.? 

 The collection will be a mix of pr?t and couture comprising ?contemporary designs for the contemporary woman?. The off-the-rack clothes, targeted at a wider audience, are for the day, while the more stylised ones are for the after-hours. The whole range aims to fulfil the fashion needs of any working woman. 

 The designer has used fabrics like linen, cotton, lycra, silk, georgette, chiffon and taffeta among others, in hues ranging from rich earth to blues, blacks and pastels. 

 While most of the collection is Western, Kumar will also showcase some Indian churidar pants and saris. The speciality of the ethnic line, he informs, are some modern embroidery forms for which he has used certain very innovative techniques.

 The line is also high on comfort. ?The outfits are not cumbersome in any way. I do not want any woman to constantly take care to ensure that her pallu is in place or her posture does not crush the fabric. The fabric must require as little maintenance as possible so that she can pass through each aspect of her day with ease,? he feels. 

 The fashion show will be followed by an exhibition where people can buy the clothes there and then. There will also be room for an informal chat with the designer and the models.

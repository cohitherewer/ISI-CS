 Detection of a crime, collection and preservation of evidence, and protection of victims and witnesses --- the hallowed process of delivering justice that is the domain of police and prosecutors. 

 But with the changing times as well as the types of crimes and criminals, the need of the hour is to unlearn old ideas and learn new technologies.

 These were the sentiments of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state law minister Nisith Adhikary at the inauguration of a national seminar on crime and the judicial system, for IPS officers, at the National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) on Monday.

 In focus was crime and the ways and means of solving them. Bhattacharjee admitted that while justice is often ?denied? and is not always swift and easy, the best way to improve the situation and the justice system was with science and technology.

 The chief minister stressed the importance of DNA, forensic science and the power of investigation, urging greater cooperation between prosecutors and police. 

 He added that the ?level of efficiency? was ?not adequate?, and that the ?shabby treatment? of victims was a ?sad reflection of the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system?.

 Both Bhattacharjee and Adhikary felt keeping up with the latest technology like fingerprinting and especially forensics was the key to upgrading the system. The chief minister added that teams like the criminal investigation department (CID) and the detective department in Calcutta Police were required in the districts, while laboratories needed to be updated and modernised.

 The weeklong workshop, entitled Vertical Interaction Course, will continue till December 4 on the NUJS Salt Lake campus. Around 30 high-ranking police officers from across the country will participate. 

 The speakers include Shyamal Dutta, director general of police, West Bengal, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb, writer Mahasveta Debi and Jasodhara Bagchi, chairperson, State Women?s Commission.

 The series of panel discussions for the third edition of the workshop will encompass a wide range of issues. 

 Effective prosecution and the role of the police, co-ordination between various components of the criminal justice system, the conflict and consensus of terror, insurgency and protection of human rights, the prospects in India of community policing and cyber crime are some of the subjects to be debated.

 The chief minister felt that such ?in-depth discussions? were necessary, especially in today?s times, when the criminal justice system is being ?questioned? and there is a ?gradual decline in convictions?. 

 Bhattacharjee, who has previously expressed concern over rising crime in the city, said there was a need to ?appropriately and adequately equip? the law-enforcement officials. An essential part of that process is knowledge about new techniques.

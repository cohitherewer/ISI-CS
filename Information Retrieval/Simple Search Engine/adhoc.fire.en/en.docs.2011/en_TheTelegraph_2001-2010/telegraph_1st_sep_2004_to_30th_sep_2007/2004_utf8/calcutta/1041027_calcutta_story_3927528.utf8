 Truck runs over cop in taint zone

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Constable Dulal Mitra, 30, of Kamardanga police outpost in Dum Dum, was run over by a truck on Tuesday morning. His death has raised uncomfortable questions since the area has become notorious because of policemen who extort money from truck drivers. 

 Mitra was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. The accident happened near the police outpost but neither was the truck driver arrested, nor could the killer vehicle be identified. 

 Mitra was the second victim in the same police station area in less than 24 hours. 

 Police said that as on any other day Mitra, who lived in the Barrackpore police barracks, was crossing the road after parking his motorbike opposite the outpost. The speeding truck crushed him under its wheels. 

 As the roads were deserted, the driver sped away before he could be chased. 

 Superintendent (SP) of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar has ordered an inquiry into the accident. According to residents of Kamardanga, repeated attempts have been made to draw the authorities? attention to the corruption, but only in vain. 

 They alleged that chaos prevails on the roads because policemen collect money after stopping trucks. To avoid being stopped by policemen some trucks are driven at breakneck speed. Unless pedestrians cross the road very cautiously they run the risk of being killed. 

 On Monday, an elderly man was run over by a truck in the same area while he was crossing the road on his way back home. A youth was also seriously injured. A shop was damaged as the truck rammed into it after hitting the two men.

 Ratan Saha, a local resident, said the police outpost is small but the officers have earned such a bad name for themselves that sometimes people wonder why it is there at all. 

 ?We had petitioned the superintendent of police and even the director-general to withdraw the outpost after making an inquiry, but it is quite difficult to move them. After requesting them many times and getting no satisfactory reply, we have given up hope,? he said. 

 SP Kumar admitted he had received complaints about the police outpost.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Go green with the good ol? ogre

Plan a Party

Pratim D. Gupta tells you how to 

have a blast with Shrek and his animal brigade

DO

 Try and organise an outdoor venue

 Decorate the place following the films theme

 Plan a menu with a lot of green food

DONT

 Leave out the popular childrens songs, while 

also playing tracks from the film 

 Get the children to watch the film through-out the party; organise some 

games too

You have loved him. You have adored him. Now it?s 

time to party with him. Even as the sequel to the hugely-popular Shrek 

film runs at INOX and Nandan, give your children the time of their lives by organising 

a theme party based on the ogre?s tale. It will not only be a welcome change from 

the oh-no-not-again bachcha party, but an evening where you can have as 

much fun as your little ones.

All colour

A Shrek party should ideally be hosted outdoors. 

As an event manager says: ?The perfect venue should be a place like Sunderbans 

at ITC Sonar Bangla. There has to be a natural feel to the setting.? 

If you want to do it at your own place, a terrace 

garden or a garden house is a good option. But if you can?t think beyond your 

drawing room, lots of greenery (natural or artificial) should be all around to 

achieve the go-green effect.

Film flavour

The d?cor is of prime importance while planning a 

theme party like this one. The theme colour for balloons and streamers is bright 

green, of course, to go with the skin tone of good ol? Shrek. A touch of yellow 

or red will add a bit of contrast. 

Put up a poster at the entrance saying: ?Welcome to 

the land of Far Far Away?. Also, set up poster-board cut-outs resembling the castle 

windows and the carriage of Shrek and Fiona.

One thing you simply can?t ignore is playing it by 

the ogre ear. So, greet your guests at the door with their very own pair of ogre 

ears. Get them ready long before the party and write the names of the guests on 

each one of them with a glitter pen. 

If your budget is big enough, you can do up the whole 

place with inflatable characters from the film.

If you want to play around with the theme a little 

further, make special Shrek masks for the kids. Painting their faces green would 

also do, provided you don?t mind the mess.

Games galore

Try and play the film on a big screen in the background, 

but make sure that the children don?t get completely engrossed in the movie. So, 

go for special Shrek games to keep them engaged. Try and use the theme and characters 

of the film and name the games Happily Ever After or Fiona on Fire.

You can also plan a big treasure hunt involving the 

other parents who can keep the clues with them for the kids to track down. A popular 

game like musical chairs can also be played with the winner being voted Shrek 

of the Evening.

Toon tunes

Music is the most flexible of all components. However, 

you must have the Shrek soundtrack and play popular songs like Welcome 

To Duloc, I?m A Believer and You Belong To Me. In between, slip 

in some popular children?s tracks, too.

Says DJ Akash: ?Whatever be the theme of a bachcha 

party, they just freak out on some tracks like Macarena and Barbie 

Girl. They are must-plays when kids are around.? But at a theme party, the 

idea is to repeat certain tracks from the film, to make it a complete audio-visual 

Shrek experience.

Leafy delights

There?s a lot of scope to play around with the menu. 

Listen to what restaurateur Naveen Pai would love to have in such a party: ?A 

lot of old-school food like fish and chips, meat loaf and stroganoff. No pizzas 

or French fries. The food should look green with a lot of fresh herbs used in 

the preparations.?

Dishes like Cilantro Pesto Pasta and Spinach and Cottage 

Cheese Dumpling are what Pai pushes. For the salads, it should be a toss-up between 

Avocado and Potato Salad and Waldorf Salad. If you are planning Indian, try aloo 

chaat with dhania chutney and Chicken Reshmi Hariyali Kebab.

For thirst quenchers, go for a simple green melon 

juice or the more exotic Green Grape Mint Head, which looks deep green at the 

bottom, fluorescent green in the middle and light green on top.

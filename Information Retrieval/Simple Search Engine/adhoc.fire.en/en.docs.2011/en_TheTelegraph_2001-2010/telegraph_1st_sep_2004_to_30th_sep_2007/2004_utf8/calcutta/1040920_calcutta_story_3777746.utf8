The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Citu no to bus depot shift

 SIMI KAMBOJ 

 At a time when the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is frantically trying to woo investors to Bengal, his party?s labour arm, Citu, is resisting the move to vacate a prime plot in the industrial complex in Sector V of Salt Lake.

 The government is trying to relocate the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) and West Bengal State Transport Corporation (WBSTC) depots, which together occupy seven acres, and allot the plot to firms willing to set up shop there.

 On August 18, the urban development department wrote to the transport secretary, seeking relocation of the two depots ?to a place outside Salt Lake? and vacation of the plot ?for industry purpose?. 

 ?We have received a letter asking us to explore the options for relocating to another place. We?re looking for an alternative,? said CSTC managing director Sukumar Bhattacharya.

 Currently, a total of 185 firms are operating from and around Sector V, popularly known as Software Technology Park.

 ?Salt Lake has been saturated for some time now. The firms that want to open shop there have demanded 160-165 acres for information technology (IT) alone. But we can?t accommodate them for want of space,? said IT secretary G.D. Gautama. 

 The letter asking for relocation of the depots has raised hackles in the Citu-backed CSTC Employees Union, which has asserted that it will not take the move lying down.

 ?We will resist relocation at all cost. Why should we put up with so much inconvenience just to benefit some private companies?? asked union secretary Narayan Saha. He, however, hasn?t seen the letter; he?s only heard about it.

 CSTC services in Salt Lake, he warned, will be disrupted if the government tries to relocate the depot ?forcibly?.

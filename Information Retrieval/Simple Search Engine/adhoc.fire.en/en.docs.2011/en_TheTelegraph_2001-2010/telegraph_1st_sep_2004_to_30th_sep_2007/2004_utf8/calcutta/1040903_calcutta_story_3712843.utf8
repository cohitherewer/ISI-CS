Tribute to teachers

Classes, projects, exams, textbooks, homework... The 

life of teachers around the world. Behind every successful student is a good teacher, 

guiding and helping tirelessly. To recognise their efforts, most countries have 

earmarked a Teachers Day, to thank them. With September 5 coming up, Young 

Metro takes a look at a few global instances.

 Around 140 Grade IV students of Seri Puteri 

School in Cyberjaya, Malaysia, spent two days and nights using two truckloads 

of sand to create an artwork the size of two basketball courts on Teachers Day, 

May 27, last year. (Reuters)

INDIA 

September 5: Birthday of former vice-president 

and President of India, Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a statesman who was once 

also a teacher. Born in 1888 in Tiruttani, near Chennai, he was the chancellor 

of University of Delhi. He became vice-president in 1952 and President a decade 

later. When some teaching colleagues and students asked him about celebrating 

his birthday, he said they should, instead, commemorate it as Teachers Day. And 

so the tradition began. Apart from students giving individual teachers tokens, 

every school has some programme planned for the occasion. Although this year its 

a Sunday, it will be celebrated on Saturday or Monday.

CHINA

September 28: Birthday of the world-famous 

teacher Confucius. Although better known as a philosopher and mathematician, he 

had thousands of disciples, including Aristotle. Apart from consolidating the 

ancient texts to give China its earliest threads of an education system, Confucius 

was also a teacher of archery and music among other things. When the Republic 

of China was founded, his birthday was established as Teachers Day. 

USA

May 4: At least this year, as decided by the 

National Education Association (NEA). The vague history behind it revolves around 

a teacher from Arkansas who in 1944 began communicating with politicians and educationists 

for a teachers day. Congress finally declared March 7, 1980, as National Teacher 

Day for that year. The first Tuesday in March continued to be the day till 1985, 

when the NEA and National Parent Teacher Association decided on the first week 

of May as Teacher Appreciation Week and the first Tuesday in May was voted in 

Assembly as National Teacher Day.

UN

October 5: Celebrated in over 100 countries, 

World Teachers Day remembers the day in 1966 when the Recommendations Concerning 

the Status of Teachers was signed. The occasion is celebrated with a slew of activities 

organised in coordination with agencies like UNESCO, Unicef and Educational International. 

The activities are a mix of the serious and fun, focussing on the importance of 

the role teachers play in shaping lives.

 Whats on your mind this 

week 

Olympic debacle

As the Olympics kicked off, we began receiving news 

of debacles, which let us down. When other Asian countries like China and Japan 

put up phenomenal performances, our country, with a strength of over a billion 

people, was routed. After the failure, we will investigate the reasons behind 

it like previous years, but to no avail. We need to import modern equipment from 

abroad and also appoint fitness experts who can raise the levels to match that 

of other countries athletes. I hope we can be glorious in the Olympics after 

revamping the existing infrastructure.

 Chaos reigned

Dhananjoy Chatterjee is dead, so the morbid drama 

enacted by the press and public is over. As the clamour surrounding Dhananjoys 

execution reached its crescendo, the baying for blood was rancorous in print and 

on TV. The question is one of decency. If the legal machinery chooses to be spiteful, 

it should at least take care to see that it is not sensationalised. The memory 

of Hetal Parekh and the crime committed against her have eroded over time, reduced 

to an ephemeral factor behind the recent tumult. We came across opinions galore, 

for and against the sentence, reeking of insincerity and callousness. Sensation 

is fodder for idle minds, and the media left no stone unturned in supplying it. 

Who is interested in the condemned mans whereabouts, or what he sang on his way 

to the gallows, except the voyeur? It is ironic that after 14 years, Hetal and 

her slayer shared the same platform of public sympathy, courtesy confusion enmasse.

Better late...

A Shakespearean quote says: The rarer action is in 

virtue than in vengeance. Two weeks ago, Zaki Mubarki had the same opinion in 

his letter, published in this column. Dhananjoys last acts were merely to gain 

sympathy. Living in prison does not make an individual a better person. According 

to a recent survey, a rape in India takes place every four minutes. One cannot 

forgive a heinous crime like what was committed by Dhananjoy. Justice was late, 

but it was granted.

Suffering

People around the country were eagerly awaiting the 

hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee. I think the President has not taken the right 

decision. Dhananjoy should have been penalised, to make him realise that he had 

committed a terrible crime. He should have suffered in the same way Hetal Parekhs 

family is suffering. By hanging, he suffered for mere minutes.

Phone pain

I am often unable to understand whether cell phones 

are tools of communication or gadgets to look cool or for entertainment. The 

old purpose of a telephone as a device for emergencies or simple communication 

has changed after the introduction of modern cell phones. They have now become 

indispensable in daily life. There is no problem in taking cell phones to school, 

as long as others are not disturbed. Anyone who can explain this to students should 

be rewarded.

I am a monsoon cloud

I stay in the sky

When I bring heavy rain

The birds cant fly.

The sun is covered

When I bring the rain

The heavy rain falls on the earth lane.

The lightening has no sound

But the thunders sound is loud

I am very proud 

Because I am a monsoon cloud.

Medha Basu,

Class III, Patha Bhavan

 The sinews of the rose petals

Have entangled; 

The thorns bleed them to death 

Choking in the raptures of a deadly mantra. 

The dried blood sips the fraying fragrance 

Of that distant traveller, 

Now meeting the horizon 

In a tumult of scarlet discs

And so I sit here dead 

Not died in death, 

But faded in sunlight

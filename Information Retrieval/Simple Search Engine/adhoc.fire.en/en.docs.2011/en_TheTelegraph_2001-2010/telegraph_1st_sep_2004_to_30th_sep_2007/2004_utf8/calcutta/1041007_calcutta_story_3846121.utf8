 As the body needs nutrition to survive, so the soul needs nourishment to grow. It is often said that literature is food for the mind and soul. It?s no surprise then, that for decades, filmdom has drawn from the plethora of literature, fiction and non-fiction, based on reality or fantasy. Books have been a staple diet for Hollywood honchos hunting down that one memorable movie made from a classic that will live on celluloid for generations.

 Steven Spielberg has Michael Crichton?s Jurassic Park to his name and Peter Jackson has made three all-time favourites with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Mario Puzo?s The Godfather trilogy, of course, made everyone, from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Andy Garcia to director Francis Ford Coppola, immortal in the Hollywood hall of fame. Even Stanley Kubrick had a go at the medium of making movies from books with 2001: A Space Odyssey (from Arthur C. Clarke?s novel The Sentinel) and the controversial Clockwork Orange (penned by Anthony Burgess). And who can forget author Alistair McLean?s Guns of Navarone?

 In the thriller brigade, Tom Clancy (Hunt for Red October, Sum of All Fears, Clear and Present Danger) and John Grisham (Pelican Brief, The Firm, Runaway Jury) are worthy contemporaries. The lesser-known Philip K. Dick has some well-known sci-fi films based on his books ? Bladerunner from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Total Recall based on We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, Minority Report and Paycheck.

 Sometimes, it?s the characters who gain more fame than the authors, and are more gripping than the story lines, like the larger-than-life James Bond, Hannibal Lector, Jason Bourne, Dr Dolittle, Oliver Twist, Louisa May Alcott?s little women, Bram Stoker?s Dracula and Mary Shelley?s Frankenstein. And Harry Potter might not have graduated from Hogwarts yet, but the first three films have already tasted worldwide box-office success.

 Then there is that special breed of writers, that fascinates with every creation, sparking an epidemic of sorts. Charles Dickens, of course, and Alexandre Dumas (The Three Musketeers series, including Man in the Iron Mask). But perhaps two of the best examples are Jane Austen and Jules Verne, authors writing in completely different genres, each work a masterpiece that generations continue to read, and watch. 

 I, Robot has gone, Vanity Fair is yet to come. But two other films based on books are ready to hit town this week. Gurinder Chadha?s much-talked-about, Bollywood-ised Bride and Prejudice and the Jackie Chan-starrer Around the World in 80 Days are not exactly copies of the originals, but the novels are inspirations.

 Austen was a keen observer of human nature, while Verne made history with what was then science fiction. There are several makes and remakes of Austen?s Emma, Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice; Mansfield Park and Persuasion have also been filmed.

 Verne?s Journey to the Centre of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, 20,000 Leagues under the Sea and Around the World in 80 Days have all featured on film, including animation. 

 Aishwarya Rai might not exactly be Austen?s Elizabeth, and Jackie Chan not Verne?s Phileas Fogg, but it is perhaps a testament to their endearing, timeless and pan-cultural qualities that we can now go balle balle around the world.

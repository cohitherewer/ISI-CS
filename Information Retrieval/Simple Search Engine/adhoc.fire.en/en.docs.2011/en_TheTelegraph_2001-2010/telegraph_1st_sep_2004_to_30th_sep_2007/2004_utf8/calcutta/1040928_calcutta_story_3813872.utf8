 ANUBRATA CHATTERJEE

Anubrata Chatterjee

Reason for rhythm...

He has aplenty. For, this 19-year-old was born into a musical family. 

He began drumming up a beat on table tops with tiny hands at two. His latent talents 

were put into practice soon after. Anubrata began his tabla tutelage under Jnan 

Prakash Ghosh, and continues under father Pandit Anindo Chatterjee, who is also 

his idol. First public performance was at age nine, with Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia, 

no less. Since then, there have been many more. A memorable occasion was accompanying 

Ustad Amjad Ali Khan at Nandan.

Name-dropping...

He is not into, but the student of St Paul?s school has made his 

presence felt at national musical extravaganzas like the Dover Lane Music Conference, 

the Mumbai Festival, ITC Sangeet Sammelan and Sankat Mochan Sangeet Samaroh, in 

Varanasi. 

Around the world...

In more than just 80 days has been the boy from Tollygunge who made 

his overseas debut in 1991. The classical music and ghazal fan has extensively 

toured the US, doing tabla duets with his father. Was invited to perform at the 

World Percussion Festival in Chicago in 2003. Playing in San Francisco with Ustad 

Ali Akbar Khan listening in was tough, but he won the veteran?s praise.

More in store...

There is, from the boy who has taken his tabla talents to Germany 

and even the West Indies. Taking the stage at the Rietberg Museum in Zurich and 

the Ali Akbar College of Music in Basil, both in Switzerland, was quite an experience. 

Fave pastime...

For the youngest winner of the Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra Award is 

driving, which he has been doing long before reaching legal age. Stamp-collecting 

is a saner ? and slower ? hobby. But it takes second priority to music, of course. 

After all, the others honoured by Srijan (founded by Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra) 

in Bhubaneswar this month were Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma, Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia 

and Sonal Mansingh.

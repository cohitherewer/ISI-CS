The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Courier in cahoots with dacoit quartet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In what is turning out to be a twister of a case, police on Wednesday arrested an employee of a central Calcutta courier service agency in connection with Saturday?s dacoity on Synagogue Street. 

 The development comes less than 24 hours after officers of Burrabazar police station conducted raids at Pilkhana, in Howrah, and arrested three of the four youths who had walked off with Rs 3 lakh in cash, three mobile phones and other valuables belonging to employees of a finance firm.

 After initial interrogation, the three culprits had named Sanjay Chaurasia, who worked for a courier service agency, alleging that he had supplied them with information and logistics, which helped them plan a near-faultless dacoity.

 According to police, Chaurasia regularly handled document parcels from the finance company. It is believed that he would open the packages, read the documents, and pass crucial information to the dacoit gang. 

 This information was crucial in planning the operation, with the gang synchronising every move to ensure maximum loot at minimum risk. 

 Though Chaurasia himself has not provided any details of how, and to what extent, he had misused his position, he has confessed to his involvement with the gang of dacoits. It is believed that he knows the whereabouts of the fourth dacoit, still at large. 

 On Tuesday, police netted Rohit Ram, Tinku Paswan and Saroj Singh from Pilkhana. An unspecified amount of cash was seized, along with two mobile phones, firearms, ammunition and choppers. All three are history-sheeters, with dacoity cases lodged at Burtola and Muchipara . 

 On Saturday, the four men, armed with knives, had walked into the first floor office of the finance company on Synagogue Street. 

 They had lined up all the employees of the office along one side of the room and had cleaned out the cash box. Thereafter, they told the employees to hand over valuables, like mobile phones and ornaments. They walked off with the loot, locking the office with its staff inside. 

 Last year, a string of dacoities had taken place in Burrabazar, where porters tipped off criminals.

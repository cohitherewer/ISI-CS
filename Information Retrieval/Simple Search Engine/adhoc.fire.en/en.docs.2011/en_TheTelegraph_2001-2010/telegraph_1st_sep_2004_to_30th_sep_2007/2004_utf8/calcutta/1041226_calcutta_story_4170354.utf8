The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Rhythm?s gonna get you

This is when Calcutta pumps up the volume, gets into 

party gear, goes footloose and fancy-free. Here?s a zip through of what city clubs 

have in store to herald 2005 on a high, in association with The Telegraph.

At Space Circle, the Dooba dooba boys 

will whip up the excitement on 31st night with their foot-tapping numbers. Filling 

in the blanks during the Silk Route gig would be DJ Ruskin from Mumbai. Midnight 

bowling will be another major attraction.

At Tollygunge Club, Moonwind, a young rock 

band from Guwahati, will set the tone for the distinguished 31st evening. The 

sit-down buffet dinner will offer Indian and Continental cuisine, mostly from 

the in-house kitchen, with a propah English breakfast early on New Year?s Day 

at the Shamiana.

At CC amp;FC, it?s party time already, with 

Boxing Day bringing back a blast from the past. The Original 70s Music Nite will 

?recreate the ambience of the swinging 60s and 70s? with a Park Street look and 

Louiz Banks, Pam Crain, Usha Uthup, Don Saigal and Skinny Alley sharing the stage. 

The Taaltantra Nite starring Tanmoy Bose and Debasree Roy is the big event on 

December 29, while the New Year?s Eve party will feature Sandeep Vyas.

Nondon Bagchi and gang will rock Dalhousie Institute 

on the last night of 2004, with special prizes for the best couple. Not long 

after the Hip-Pocket blast, there?s a breakfast combo platter of fried eggs and 

bacon on toast and Chinese-style soups.

Saturday Club also kicks off its New Year?s 

celebrations early with the Black amp; White Nite on December 26 featuring choreographed 

dancing by Beat Busters to the tune of old Bollywood tunes and also DJ Firoz. 

December 29 hosts the East Meets West party, Barefoot in concert and DJ music. 

Rock act Wired will kick off the 31st blast, with Ukrainian dancers. Piu Sarkar 

will be MC.

RCGC will swing in step with Rashmee Nigam 

and Payal Rohatgi on New Year?s Eve, with Ruby Bhatia as MC and DJ Akash at the 

console. Food at the space theme party will be supplied by catering king Munna 

Maharaj.

At the Calcutta Swimming Club, Nitin Bali, 

DJ Zam from Hyderabad and local dance troupe Challengers are the main attractions.

The Calcutta Club grounds come alive to the 

sound of old favourite Shiva, while Ibiza will rock to popular beats belted 

out by Chapter II with DJ Siddharth manning the dance floor.

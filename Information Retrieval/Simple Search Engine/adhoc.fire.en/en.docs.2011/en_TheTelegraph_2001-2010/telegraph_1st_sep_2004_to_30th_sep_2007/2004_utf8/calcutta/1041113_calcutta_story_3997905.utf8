The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Platform for child plight

 - Groups 

join hands for juvenile commission 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 When Shiuli went to Kalighat police station to lodge a complaint about a domestic problem, the first thing she was asked was her age. When the officers heard that she was but 13 years old, and a resident of the red light area to boot, they either refused to lodge a diary or foisted her on their superiors. She went back four times in two years. Each time, her age was a hurdle.

 When a child sex worker escaped and went to a Howrah police station, the officers told her to put down her age as 18, because it is easier to help an adult than a juvenile.

 Just two examples of why children from varied backgrounds and of different ages have come together to fight for a children?s commission. For a month now, youngsters from several organisations have been meeting to discuss the aims and objective, means and methods, of such an initiative. The result is a two-page document, with precise guidelines.

 Quality Institutional Care amp; Alternatives for Children (QIC amp;AC) is not an organisation or a group. It?s a movement that began over two years ago to give more rights to children, who are ?not allowed to vote and hence, are not represented anywhere?. It has since spread to 11 states and is supported by CRY. Here, it includes about 20 NGOs and youth groups.

 On Friday morning, they met the chairperson of the state Women?s Commission, to enlist her support. The next stop is the Human Rights Commission. The idea is to submit the proposal to the state government. ?There were plans to start a national children?s commission. But we are the first state-level initiative,? said Sangeet Shirodkar, South Asian youth representative of ECPAT International.

 They had help from adults in organisations and support groups like Atmaja, Diksha and Praajak. The purpose of the West Bengal State Children?s Commission would be to make sure that children are heard, through the implementation of the law, mainly the Juvenile Justice Act, and with four young people ? two aged between 18 and 25 and two below 18 years ? on the commission. The focus will be on getting the government to do its bit, sensitisation of those involved in the welfare of juveniles and accountability of NGOs.

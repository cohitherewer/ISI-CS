 Facility dearth, delay fan cancer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Late detection of cancer and lack of infrastructure for treatment are the key causes for the rapid increase of cancer cases in West Bengal.

 That is the diagnosis of Alvaro Martinez, chairman, radiation oncology department, William Beaumont Hospital, Michigan, USA, in the city on Monday. 

 He recommended that the state government look into providing more quality cancer care facilities and equipment for treatment.

 Calcutta reports 60,000 new cancer cases from the city and districts. Worldwide, 10 million new cases appear annually. Here, most are detected very late, at a stage where, surgery aside, even improved radiation (brachytherapy) machines cannot really help, according to the expert.

 ?In more advanced nations like the USA, we get many cases at a very early stage, which helps in controlling the disease,? said Martinez, who is travelling the country to update doctors on the latest developments in cancer treatment.

 The dearth of radiation technicians and physicists in state-run hospitals is also a hindrance. ?The pressures are so acute that we hardly get time for adequate radiation planning,? confessed a doctor at the state-run Medical College and Hospital.

 Nearly 200 patients seek treatment at three top hospitals ? Medical College, Nilratan Sircar and SSKM ? but the shortage of technicians has not been addressed.

 Medical College and SSKM have two Bhaba Atomic Research Centre-trained and approved physicists, while Nilratan Sircar (NRS) has only one. ?The technicians are working overtime every day and are even facing exposure to low amounts of radiation,? said an NRS oncologist.

 On Monday, AMRI Hospitals announced the introduction of a Rs 5.5-crore Precise Beam IMRT (intensity modulated radio-therapy) machine, at its new oncology division. ?After expansion, we will start endoscopic neurosurgery and also introduce cardiac surgery in a bigger way, ? announced S.B. Purokayastha, president, AMRI.

 The machine, manufactured by Swedish company Elekta, is the first of its kind in eastern India and the fifth in the country. ?We have orders for more machines from eastern India,? said Percy Shroff, managing director, Elekta Instruments (India).

 Later on Monday, Martinez met city oncologists to discuss global advances in treatment of cancer. Earlier, he spoke of a combination of radiation from brachytherapy machines (in which a needle incision is required to access the tumour) and IMRT (exterior beam), which could yield better results for cancer treatment.

 ?When you get early cancer cases, only brachytherapy treatment can help treat cancer in a particular site, but with late detection of cases, a combination can help,? added Martinez.

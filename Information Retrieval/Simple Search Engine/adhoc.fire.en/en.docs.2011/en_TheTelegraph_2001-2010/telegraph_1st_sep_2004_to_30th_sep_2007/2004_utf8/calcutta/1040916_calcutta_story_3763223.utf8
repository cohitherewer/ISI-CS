 Director of Medical Education (DME) C.R. Maiti visited BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children on Wednesday to probe the situation prevailing there. A day after Metro reported how the state?s only referral hospital for paediatric cases was crammed to the crib, the DME met hospital superintendent Mrinal Kumar Chatterjee and visited the wards, inspecting beds that were occupied by more than one patient. Maiti also spoke to relatives of several patients, who narrated the inconveniences they face in the hospital.

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government decided on Wednesday that if the Left Front comes back to power in 2007, ministers will employ only two attendants each during their five-year tenure. In the present system, a minister can employ two attendants every year. By the end of each year, an attendant is made a permanent employee of the government. The Cabinet had proposed that the number of attendants a minister can engage in five years be reduced to two, from the present 10. 

 ost ministers had reportedly objected to the proposal being implemented immediately. A middle path was worked out: a minister will engage one attendant, instead of four, in 2005 and 2006. And if the CPM-led alliance is voted back to power in the next polls, each minister will engage only two attendants during his or her five-year tenure.

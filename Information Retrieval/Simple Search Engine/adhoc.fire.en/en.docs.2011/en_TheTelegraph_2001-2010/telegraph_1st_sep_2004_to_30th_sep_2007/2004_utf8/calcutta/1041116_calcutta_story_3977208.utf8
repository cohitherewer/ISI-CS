Green grandeur

Himika Chaudhuri visits Parul Swarups 

Alipore residence to pick up tips on using plants in home decor

 Potted plants and flowers have been used to deck up a portion of the 

sitting room, the glass walls of which overlook the garden

 Another part of the sitting room has slightly bigger plants and Bird 

of Paradise flowers 

 This glass tretarium with a marble base holds Bird of Paradise flowers. 

The wrought iron stand holds diyas and flowers

 The living room is decorated with more dry flowers, which are a good 

option in summer when fresh flowers are difficult to get.

You can pick up half-a-dozen of them for just Rs 100, 

and yet nothing adds life to your home quite like a plant can. They are easy to 

lay your hands on, not too difficult to maintain. With a little bit of creativity, 

an eye for detail and some tender loving care, plants are the best way to make 

your house look really proud.

Parul Swarup?s plush three-storey residence on Alipore 

Road is one such unique example of how greens can help transform the look and 

feel of a house and add a host of warmth to it.

?Whenever someone walks into my house, they always 

point out that it is beautiful. I insist that it?s not my decor but nature, which 

I have made a part of my home,? smiles Parul, a self-taught plant expert. She 

really has ? from the washroom to the kitchen, plants have been used everywhere.

And it oozes style. ?Personally, I think this is the 

best time for anyone to decorate their homes with plants. The minimalist look 

in home d?cor is in right now, and some small plants along with a few accessories 

can do the trick,? she feels.

They are also an affordable way to deck up your living 

space for a special occasion. ?I use a wrought iron stand to hold flowers and 

diyas to create the mood for Diwali,? Parul points out.

?For beginners, winter is the right time to start 

building a plant collection. The city has a number of flower and plant shows now, 

and plants are more healthy and survive longer at this time of year. The horticultural 

gardens are a nice place to pick up plants from,? says the woman whose own sprawling 

garden serves as an ideal source for plants and flowers.

For those who live in a flat with little scope to 

keep the pots out in the open, it is better to get a well turned out or slightly 

grown plant that is already strong enough to fend for itself. All plants need 

light, but there is a difference. ?While some can survive in diffused light, others 

need direct sunlight to thrive. The choice of plants is important,? she says. 

The trick is to ?put the plant out in the sun for at least 10 days after every 

five days indoors?, she advises. For a truly green home, one must actually have 

two sets of plants!

While cut flowers wilt within days ? if you are lucky 

? potted plants stay fresh all the time. Potted flowering plants on the other 

hand, ensure blooms that last for a much longer time. To tide over the summers, 

some foliage coupled with a few artificial stems should work just fine. 

But plants also inculcate a sense of involvement for 

those who live in the home and take care of them. ?It is the perfect stress buster,? 

she grins. To jazz up plain pots, small accessories can be used to liven up a 

corner or a table. Keep an eye out to identify them. Parul, for instance, uses 

white marble chips, coloured stones and small candles.

They can be used creatively instead of traditional 

d?cor. A row of plants can act as a divider between the living area and the dining 

area, and have a great deal more life than a divider of teak wood and Kashmiri 

craftsmanship that costs a fortune. 

The same applies to the greenery itself. ?It is not 

important to have a very expensive plant or a bonsai. Fresh and healthy plants 

are enough,? she signs off.

Tips

 Start now. You can pick up the plants from 

the various flower and plant shows that take place in the city during this time. 

Or, head for a nursery.

 Taking care of the plants is of prime importance. 

Read up on the specific needs of plants, or learn the hard way by experimenting.

 Plants stay fresh longer than flowers and 

are easier to maintain. However, even they need continuous care.

 Try growing potted herbs like basil, parsley 

and mint among other things in your own kitchen. Not only do they add a fresh 

fragrance to your environment, you can put them to use, using the leaves to season 

your food.

 Plants that stay fresh through the year and 

easiest to keep indoors are: palms of various kinds, Schefflera, Money Plant, 

Ferns, Dieffenbachia, Aglonema, Monstera, Philodendron, Pleomele.

 Flowers that last longer than others: Orchids 

(if they are not over-watered), Bird of Paradise, Chrysanthemums, Gerberas and 

Gladioli.

 Bicycle ride for piety ends in peril

 OUR BUREAU

 Five persons, including two children, were killed in two road accidents in Salt Lake and on Kalyani Expressway on Thursday. 

 Pradip Das, 14, and Biswajit Sen, 14, who were riding a bicycle, were hit by a private vehicle near Nalban on Salt Lake Bypass, in the Bidhannagar (South) police station area, at 5 pm. Police said the boys, residents of Sukantanagar, were on their way to buy flowers for Kali puja which their club is organising.

 ?They were heading towards the footbridge on Eastern Drainage Channel when the vehicle hit them,? police said. Das died on the spot, while Sen was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The driver escaped with the vehicle, which local people said was a Tata Qualis. 

 Residents later put up a roadblock for half-an-hour at the accident spot, demanding stricter traffic vigil and setting up of a signalling system. They complained that there were hardly any policemen in front of Nicco Park and Nalban, the two entertainment parks that pull huge crowds.

 ?It is a busy road and vehicles move at a great speed. Police must take steps to curb road mishaps here,? said Ashim Guha, CPM councillor and convener of the transport committee of Bidhannagar Municipality. ?The trees on the boulevard are obstructing the view of pedestrians crossing the road. These must be trimmed so that people crossing the road can see vehicles approaching from the opposite direction,? Guha said. 

 In another incident, three persons were killed when a truck hit them on Kalyani Expressway on Thursday morning. Police said Uttam Das, 25, Lakshmi Das, 34, and Gita Bhadra, 35, were killed on the spot. They were all vegetable vendors carrying their goods to a local market. 

 The truck was speeding from Barrackpore towards Kalyani. The three were crossing the road when the vehicle hit them.

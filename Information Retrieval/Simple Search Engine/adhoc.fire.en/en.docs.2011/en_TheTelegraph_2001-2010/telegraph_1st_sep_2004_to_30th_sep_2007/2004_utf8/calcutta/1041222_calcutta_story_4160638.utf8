 Bandhan team: All in the family

 Statutory warning: If you are at the wheel while crossing Park Hotel, don?t dare look up right. For, Bipasha Basu is playing traffic hazard, splayed on a billboard. 

 The girl from Gariahat is sure going places. After the stunning cameo in Jay Sean?s video, Bipasha has now endorsed the new Levis Slim Jeans collection. In the process, she has joined the likes of James Dean, Madonna and Shah Rukh Khan who have previously endorsed Levis.

 As evident in the picture below, the new Levis Slim Jeans collection has been designed to compliment her curves, making her legs look longer and her hips slimmer. 

 Speaking at the tie-up, Shuman Chatterjee, managing director, Levis Strauss, India, said: ?Bipasha epitomises the essence of Slim Jeans as devised by the Levis design team.?

 The new advertising campaign, consisting of a series of eye candy shots with the sultry Bollywood siren, was conceptualised by JWT, Bangalore and shot by Prasad Naik. The collection comes in three finishes, Distressed, Raw and Gloss, depending on the hour of the day.

Bipasha Basu: Slim line

 Shot in Singapore, processed in Hyderabad, music recorded in Mumbai, background score in Chennai? And all for a Bengali audience. Shri Venkatesh, the producers of Chokher Bali, have spared no effort to dish out an expensive, slick family drama in the form of Bandhan. 

 Starring Jeet and Koel Mullick, the film tracks the happy married life of the couple with a kid (played by Anshu Buch) in Singapore, until life takes a cruel turn. With his wife no more, Jeet returns to Calcutta only to bump into Koel No. 2, the twin sister that is. But a bitter past in the family creeps up to slow down the blooming love. Chased by memories of his wife, Jeet is at the crossroads. Can he risk losing his family for a second shot at love?

 Nick is all set to add to the excitement on-screen in the winter vacation as it presents Nick Dum Duma Dum, the Indianised avatar of the runaway international success Double Dare! Combining stunts and trivia, this long-running gameshow had been hugely successful for Nickelodeon in the US. Nick India brings the phenomenon to India, to air at 12.30 pm on Saturdays and Sundays starting December 18.

 Loaded with fun for the family, the show is hosted by Vrijesh Hirjee, the comedian better known for his performance in Kaho Naa? Pyaar Hai. Set in a specially designed Nick space with quirky props and games, Nick Dum Duma Dum transports participants and viewers into a wacky, adrenaline-filled zone. 

 In the first two rounds of this gameshow, two teams of contestants must either answer questions correctly or face outrageous physical challenges. The winning team goes into the final Jackpot Round, where one by one, they climb, slip and slide through an obstacle course, hurl their bodies into slime, jump through puddles and more.

 Pradeep Hejmadi, director, business and operations, Nick India, says: ?Nick Dum Duma Dum is about the whole family getting off the couch and participating in a highly involving and interactive experience.?

 The Incredibles at INOX Forum, Hum Hai Lajawab at INOX-City Centre, Polar Express at both the multiplexes from December 23? And the two multiplexes are making the festive season more special with Christmas trees, Santas, bells and snowflakes. While Refuel, the food counter at INOX Forum, is dishing out a delectable festive spread, INOX-City Centre has laid out Indian and imported decorations and gifts. Santa lookalike contests are slated for Christmas with snow pools filled with popcorn, at both addresses.

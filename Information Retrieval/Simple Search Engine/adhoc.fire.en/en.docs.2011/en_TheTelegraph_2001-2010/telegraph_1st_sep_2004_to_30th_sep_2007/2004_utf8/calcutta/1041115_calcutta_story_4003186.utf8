 Fuel bill spurs LPG shift

 - Oil prices, not clean air need, drive car-owners to opt for gas

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With 10 days to go for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to submit a compliance report on auto emission to Calcutta High Court, the ground reality is clear.

 Only about 1,000 vehicle-owners in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) have converted their vehicles to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 

 While 30 per cent of the retrofitted vehicles are auto-rickshaws, the rest are private cars. ?Interestingly, most car-owners who switched to clean fuel have done so with a view to cutting down on running costs and not to curb pollution,? says Soumen Dutta, a distributor of BRC Gas Equipment, an Italian firm dealing in retrofitting kits. 

 At Rs 23.70 a litre, LPG scores over petrol, whose prices have been hiked several times recently. Switching to LPG cuts fuel costs by 40 per cent, even if an LPG-driven car gives 10 per cent less mileage than a petrol car, the dealer says.

 However, in the absence of any pressure from the government, retrofitting isn?t popular. ?We?ve been ready with the kits for the past 18 months. But, after the October 1 deadline passed, neither Writers? Buildings nor the Public Vehicles Directorate (PVD) has pursued the matter in the manner being done initially,? said another dealer. 

 There are 65 authorised retrofitment centres (RFCs) in the CMA, 80 per cent of which are in Calcutta. A gas conversion kit is available for between Rs 21,000 and Rs 27,000, depending on the car model. 

 Not a single bus or taxi in the city has switched to clean fuel so far. ?We haven?t taken any steps on reducing auto emission till now. The transport department has not provided us with any guidelines, nor has it put pressure on us,? said Bimal Guha of the Bengal Taxi Association. 

 ?We don?t know if LPG conversion is necessary any longer. The transport department and the PVD have not issued any circular or deadline to vehicle-owners,? another RFC dealer said.

 Hindustan Motors (HM), which introduced LPG models in February, has sold only 27 cars so far. ?The awareness level is low. We?ve held road shows at the PVD, but taxi unions aren?t upbeat. They expect financial help from the government in replacement of engines,? an HM official said. 

 Diesel vehicles cannot be converted directly to LPG. The engine has to be replaced with a petrol engine before the LPG kit is fitted on. The company has priced its LPG cars at Rs 2.78 lakh, against diesel cars at Rs 3.40 lakh and petrol cars at Rs 3.90 lakh. 

 As for upgrade of 107 auto emission testing centres in CMA, officials were unwilling to comment on the number of gas analysers and opacimetres procured so far.

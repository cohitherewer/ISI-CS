Charlies Angels, Erika Christensen stars in Swimfan and a moment from Shrek

For most people out there, Puja translates to ?Oh yes!? but for some of us it is a nagging ?Oh no, not again?? And with every possible ?peace? destination taken over by the Puja people, it is mission impossible to get away from the madding crowd. But if you can somehow sneak out and get a weekly ration of cola and popcorn, your job is done. Then sit back and live the movies at home. Metro tells you how to freak out this Puja by catching the best films the small screen has to offer on the five festive days, starting Tuesday. So stop zapping ? zoom in?

Mahasashti Movie: 

Charlie?s Angels

Where/when: HBO, Tuesday, 9 pm

Star trek: Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore

 Storyline: Leaving retro for dead, the angels are back from their 70s avatar to make men look bad again. Natalie (Diaz), Dylan (Barrymore) and Alex (Liu) set out to plug evil for their boss, Charlie. 

 Film funda: The script was re-written at least 30 times by a total of 18 different writers. The mobile phones the angels use are Nokia 8260. Lucy Liu was originally cast as a villain. Milla Jovovich, Alyssa Milano and Julia Roberts were the frontrunners for the parts of Natalie, Dylan and Alex. Drew Barrymore bought the screen rights to the 1976 Charlie?s Angels prior to the movie being filmed. The original cast ? Jaclyn Smith, Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett ? was invited to make cameo appearances, but declined.

Mahasaptami Movie: 

Shrek

 Where/when: Star Movies, Wednesday, 9 pm

 Star trek: Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy

 Storyline: The computer-animated fantasy has the oh-so-loveable green ogre Shrek (Myers) suddenly invaded by a hoard of fairy-tale characters. Shrek goes on to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona (Diaz) with the help of his faithful popstar Donkey (Murphy).

 Film funda: Chris Farley was originally ?cast? as Shrek and even recorded the dialogue. Donkey was modelled after Pericles (aka Perry), a real-life miniature donkey who lives in Barron Park, California. The principal actors never met each other ? all reading their parts separately. Myers actually read opposite his wife Robin when recording his lines for the climactic love scene. Computer animation production started on the project in October 1996 and took more than four-and-a-half years to complete. Princess Fiona?s martial arts were inspired by Jackie Chan. Shrek was the winner in the inaugural Best Animated Feature Film category of the Academy Awards 2002.

Mahashtami Movie: 

Fatal Attraction

 Where/when: Star Movies, Thursday, 9 pm

 Star trek: Michael Douglas, Glenn Close

 Storyline: Dan (Douglas) is a family man whose one-night affair with Alex (Close) turns into a nightmare when she insists on continuing the relationship, claiming to be carrying his baby. Alex has to win him back ? by crook more than hook.

 Film funda: The original ending had Alex committing suicide while dressed in white and Dan being arrested for her murder. It was changed when preview audiences felt that Alex was not brought to justice. This ending still appears in the Japanese release. The film was based on a short film made for British TV. Close still has the knife she used in the movie hanging in her kitchen.The film?s working title was Affairs of the Heart.

Mahanavami Movie: Swimfan

 Where/when: Star Movies, Friday, 9 pm

 Star trek: Erika Christensen, Jesse Bradford

 Storyline: The almost perfect life of Ben Cronin (Jesse) is all messed up when Madison (Erika), the alluring new girl in town, develops a crush on him. When Madison becomes hellbent on ruining his life as well as the lives of those around him, Ben decides to set the record straight.

 Film funda: The scenes inside Madison?s house are the only ones where a light blue tint was not added to the screen. The earlier title of the film was Swimfan85. Erika first shot to fame as Michael Douglas? daughter in Steven Soderbergh?s Oscar-winning drama Traffic.

 Rani Mukherjee in Saathiya

Mahadashami Movie: 

Saathiya

 Where/when: SET Max, Saturday, 9 pm

 Star trek: Rani Mukherjee, Vivek Oberoi

 Storyline: Forgetting class differences, Aditya (Vivek) falls in love with Suhani (Rani) and after a lot of persistence manages to win her over. The secret marriage is just the take-off point of their struggles.

 Film funda: The film is a remake of Mani Ratnam?s Tamil hit Alaipayuthey (Waves), which starred Madhavan in the male lead. Director Shaad Ali (poet-turned-film-maker Muzaffar Ali?s son) was Mani Sir?s assistant for the film. The presence of Tabu and Shah Rukh in guest roles was kept a closely-guarded secret. Shamita Shetty does the item number Chori pe chori, sung by Asha Bhonsle. A. R. Rahman uses the Tamil tunes for this Hindi version, but the words change, thanks to Gulzar.

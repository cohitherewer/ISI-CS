The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Festive fun, festive fear

Nelanjana Bhowmick

I?m in Mumbai, a city that?s currently celebrating 

Ganesh Chaturthi. Next month in Calcutta, I?ll be a part of Durga puja followed 

by Kali puja. Ganpati visarjan (immersion) is incomplete without naach-gaana, 

like Kali puja is without fireworks. 

Amongst all this enthusiasm and festivity I can?t 

overlook the trauma animals experience due to heightened noises (fireworks, dhak-dhol, 

etc). Animals, particularly dogs, show symptoms like panting, shaking, salivating, 

hiding and being difficult to control.

Innumerable dogs and cats suffer from burns either 

due to the mischief of insensitive people or injuries caused inadvertently.

Let?s pause and think about the welfare of animals 

before the festive season sets in. Here are some trauma-control tips:

Exercise your dog during the day, well before the 

fireworks start. To make him feel secure during the evening, keep him in a room 

with curtains drawn and the familiar background sound of a TV or radio for company. 

If your dog shows any signs of anxiety when the fireworks start don?t fuss over 

him, provide him with a place to hide until it?s all over.

Keep your cat indoors and provide a litter tray so 

that he doesn?t need to venture outdoors. For rabbits and guinea pigs, transfer 

the cage indoors for the evening or place a sack over the cage.

Also, during festivals, pets panic and run away, sometimes 

getting lost. Tag your dog, keep the leash on at all times.

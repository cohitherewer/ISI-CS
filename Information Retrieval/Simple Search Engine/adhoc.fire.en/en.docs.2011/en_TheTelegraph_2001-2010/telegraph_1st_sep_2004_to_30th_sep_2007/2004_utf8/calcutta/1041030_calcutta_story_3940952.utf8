 Cops clueless about boy killing 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police were clueless even after a day-long probe on Friday into the murder of Mekai Dhubri, the 10-year-old son of a grocery shopowner, who was kidnapped on Sunday. 

 Even 24 hours after the boy?s acid-burnt body, with a slit throat, was found in a paddy field behind his house on the city?s southern fringes, officers working on the case failed to throw any light.

 A team of officers from Cossipore police station went to Mekai?s Bhangore residence on Friday morning and requested his family members to provide them with a clue to track down the assassins. 

 But they could not, saying: ?We don?t have any idea about the culprits.?

 Mekai went missing around 11.30 am on Sunday, while returning home from his father?s store, 200 metres away. The kidnappers rang up around 7.30 pm and demanded Rs 1 lakh from Mekai?s father, Abdul Rezzak Dhubri, and asked him to meet them at the Bantala leather complex with the cash. 

 Dhubri immediately informed the local police and a search with the help of the leather complex police station was carried out. But nobody was found.

 On Tuesday, the kidnappers called again and told Dhubri that they didn?t need the cash, but would send the boy to a relative?s place. Next day, local people spotted Mekai?s body in a bush, 100 metres from Dhubri?s house.

 With residents of the area demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits, officers of Cossipore police station stepped up efforts to track them down.

 Family members, who went to Katapukur morgue where the post-mortem was carried out, returned without the body. 

 ?Police told us they would preserve the body for forensic tests, which means we will get the body on Monday (November 1). Such tests cannot be conducted on Saturday and Sunday,? said Sezzak Dhubri, Mekai?s uncle. He fears that by then the body would be too decomposed for burial.

 Police suspect the crime was committed by local criminals who know the area well. They said they had activated their network in adjoining areas such as Majhergram, Dheiti and Haroa.

 It appears Mekai was murdered on Tuesday and his body was dumped behind his house the same night, an officer of Cossipore police station said. The sleuths feel the boy must have been kept confined somewhere in the locality from the day of his kidnapping.

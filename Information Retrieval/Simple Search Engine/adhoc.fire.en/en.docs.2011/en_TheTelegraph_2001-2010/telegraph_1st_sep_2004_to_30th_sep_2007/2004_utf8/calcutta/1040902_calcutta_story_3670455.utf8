The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Get real or get lost on telly trail

 Tania Zaetta, who hosts Who Dares Wins 

on AXN 

 The West realised the power of reality shows ages ago, taking full advantage of television as the perfect tool to satisfy voyeurism and the irrepressible urge to grab two minutes of fame. So came the hugely successful programmes like American Idol, Big Brother and Survivor.

 It would follow, then, that the infectious trend spread its tentacles to this part of the world. After all, in a population of over a billion, there is bound to be a fair share of daredevils. Although the concept has only clicked in small doses, there are enough imports to keep the adrenaline pumping.

 The biggest ball player in the reality show park is AXN, with a varied line-up, from the Amazing Race to AXN Xtreme. Scariest Places on Earth, Ripleys Believe it or Not, Guinness Book of World Records, Who Dares Wins, Hot n Wild, Hollywoods Greatest Stunts, Wild On, 30 Seconds of Fame, Worst-case Scenario, Worlds Freakiest Foods The list which has many more reads like a whats what of action adventure programmes. They aim to scare, dare and make your heart race.

Some have even spawned desi versions like Who Dares Wins and Hot n Wild. And now, theres Bikini Destination (heavenly bodies in exotic locales is how the show is described), AXN Next Action Star, the hunt for Hollywoods new action hero for a Joel Silver production, and Xtreme, the much-talked-about India-Pakistan battle.

 For all those fed up with the unreal fare on the K-serials 

and the like, AXN is not all there is to turn to, either. After the popular Bakra 

series, MTV is now launching Scam TV, where 12 aspiring actors join 

a fake acting academy to try and make it big with a little help from Bollywood 

stars.

 Actually, its just a scam its no acting academy and the actors arent going anywhere. But they have no idea of that. There are appearances from real stars like Vivek Oberoi, Mandira Bedi, Ishaa Koppiker, Adnan Sami, Farhan Akhtar, Ritesh Deshmukh, Gulshan Grover and Dino Morea.

 And thats of course after the launch of the second 

season of MTV Roadies, with the seven bikers, picked after countrywide 

auditions, travelling all the way from Calcutta to the Wagah Border. Quirky, kooky 

and funny are the keywords for MTVs broadcasts.

Channel [V] has a continuous series of reality shows, 

but its the talent hunts that made the channel famous. With the phenomenon that 

Popstars became producing Viva and Aasma and Get Gorgeous, the model 

hunt, thousands of youngsters queued up to try and get famous.

 On the Run, Channel [V]s version of a road trip with VJs Purab and Anushka and one lucky viewer, and Discostar, the collaboration between Subhash Ghai and Mukta Arts to discover the next glamour girl, were then, Samsung [V] Super Singer is now. The latest addition is a search for a new voice, with Adnan Sami leading the way.

 Joe Millionaire and Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? must have clocked up enough demand although niche to prompt more of the same fare on Star World. Joe, as it turned out, was a construction worker not a wealthy bachelor, but in both cases, pretty women competing with each other for one mans attentions brought out the worst in them.

 September promises to be even more fun, with the launch of The Bachelor yes, its the same with one guy dating 25 women to find his true love. Also along the marriage lines (America is obsessed with getting its single men and women married off), Race to the Altar involves 16 soon-to-be-wed guys and gals battling it out for a dream wedding, to be broadcast on TV (surprise, surprise).

 A refreshing change no less bloody though is the boardroom battle in Trump Tower, as 16 candidates have to complete a set of tasks to win the top $ 250,000 job. Some are Ivy League college MBA graduates, others have very little education, but all live together in a swanky Manhattan apartment. And theyre out to stab each other in the back, just so they dont have to hear big boss Donald Trump say Youre fired.

 This is only a taste of whats on air, with the Hindi channels offering many more, proving that real life is often more exciting than watching painted dolls fighting for household supremacy. Tune in or lose out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Princely platter

Dining Debut

Himika Chaudhuri lounges around 

at Souravs, the Indian skippers four-floor food stop slated to open 

next weekend

First there was Tendulkar?s. Now, Team India captain 

? not to be outdone ? has matched the master blaster?s Mumbai landmark with a 

culinary offering of his own. The Prince of Calcutta is about to unveil Sourav?s 

on November 11, before which The Goodlife was given an exclusive tour of 

the four-floor destination.

Captain?s corner

Otherwise to be known as The Food Pavilion at 20G 

Park Street, the 10,000 sq ft floor space makes clear that Dada has gone over 

the top in the food field, too. Here is the selection: Oneday, a 24-hour coffee 

shop on the first floor; Over Boundary, one floor up, serving cross-country cuisine; 

Maharaj to dish out ?royal Indian vegetarian fare? on level three; Prince of Cal, 

a lavish lounge bar with spacious interiors. Here goes the line-up, clockwise 

from top right corner:

Opener

Oneday, a 120-cover young-at-heart 24-hour coffee 

shop captures the skipper?s sporty spirit. The bright sun-yellow chairs and the 

walls of glazed glass allow a rush of daylight to flood the place. A translucent 

green ceiling and lots of leg room could be the perfect setting for rock nights, 

as an English band may take its stand soon to provide live entertainment. ?We 

will be serving mainly snacks ? from Indian idlis to Italian pizzas, mocktails 

and coffee here, but after midnight, we will also be serving combo meals for those 

who want dinner,? said Kanishka Mazumder, chief executive officer, Sourav?s. 

Sixer

The theme of Over Boundary, a pan-Indian restaurant, 

is experimentation. Both d?cor and menu are proof of this. Thus, a set of high-back 

cane chairs finds place beside black-and-white velvet sofas. On another side, 

a woody zone separates a private dining space for 10 from the rest of the floor. 

In yet another region, stark benches and tables in white wood dominate. ?There 

is a diverse platter of non-vegetarian food available here, and seafood will be 

the speciality,? said Manoj Jhajharia, director, Sourav?s. A number of Bengali 

and Anglo-Indian flavours will be stirred up to give a taste of Calcutta. There 

is also an interactive kitchen which allows finicky foodies to toss up their own 

meal with the help of the chef at the counter.

All white

Maharaj adds a regal touch, oozing romance. White 

walls embellished with Mother of Pearl, sofas in the form of seashells, spotless 

white cutlery, a wall dressed with candles and a strikingly bright red Egyptian 

marble floor add to the third-floor drama. With cosy tables for two, four and 

occasionally six, Maharaj has its own designated vegetarian kitchen. ?We don?t 

want any vegetarian guests to have doubts about the way the food is cooked. It 

is not made in the same kitchen as the non-vegetarian,? stressed Ajay Jindal, 

another director. 

Nightwatchman

Prince of Cal can take in around 200 guests. The lounge 

has a 12-foot-long bar, with colour-changing lights imported from Austria as its 

background. This nightclub celebrates the spirit of Sourav ? achiever and celebrity. 

?The panel changes a few hundreds of thousands of colours in a matter of seconds,? 

smiled Kanishka. This, along with lit-up pillars separating the bar from the seating 

area, create a dreamy effect. The low, white leather seating and fairly spacious 

dance floor in one corner promise to make Sourav?s the lair for night animals. 

?We will be serving Indian, Continental and Lebanese combo-meals for guests to 

munch while they drink,? added Kanishka.

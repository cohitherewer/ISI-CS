The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Does any man remember the story of Charlie?s Angels? In the movie theatre, did anyone actually bother to follow the storyline when the heavenly bodies of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu filled the screen? The answer, normally, ranges from a resounding ?no? to a cheeky ?are you kidding??

 HBO is now offering you the chance to at least pretend to follow the plot (what?s that?), at home. Catch the premiere of Charlie?s Angels: Full Throttle on September 26 at 8 pm and then throughout October. It gets tougher to keep track of the tale in Part Two, as fallen Angel Demi Moore joins the party. The leaner and meaner bride of Ashton Kutcher plays villain and how!

 So just in case you miss the plot for the right reasons, here?s the outline. In this second outing, Charlie?s babelicious threesome is to search for and retrieve a pair of rings that protect the identities of every informant on the FBI?s Witness Protection Programme. The Angels work for the Charles Townsend Detective Agency (led by the mysterious Charlie who does not show his face).

 Their search for the missing bands leads to a familiar face (and bod) ? Madison Lee (Demi Moore), once Charlie?s trusted aide, who switched sides for a fatter paycheque. That?s probably more than what you?d like to know about the story.

 Happy ogling!

Devina: Bollywood calling

 After Bipasha, Celina and Koena, here goes Devina. The leggy model scorching the city?s ramps till a few months ago, is poised to be the latest Bengali export to Bollywood. Having knocked off 11 other contestants from Calcutta, Devina has made it to the final round of Sahara Manoranjan?s Mr and Miss Bollywood Talent Hunt. The 23-year-old is now signing a one-year contract with Sahara?s film production unit along with 29 others short-listed from across the country through auditions in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune and Ahmedabad.

 In the semi-finals, Devina acted out a scene from Dhoop, starring Revathy, Sanjay Suri, Om Puri and Gul Panag, and danced to Bistirno dupare, the Bhupen Hazarika classic. ?I wanted to do something non-filmi for the dance number and I think that worked for me,? says the girl, who did her graduation from Gokhale Memorial College. The resident of Madanmohantala, off Central Avenue, bagged a runner-up crown at Sananda Tilottama in 1999.

 For the finals to be held sometime in November, Devina and gang is going through a rigorous three-week crash course on acting, diet and skincare in Mumbai. Saroj Khan, Jaya Bachchan and Asutosh Rana have already lectured the go-getters and a few more experts are in queue.

 ?Ten short films will be made with the 30 finalists. Three girls and three boys chosen from them will be cast as the lead in the three feature films produced by Sahara,? confirmed a spokesperson for Sahara Manoranjan. The jury set to decide the fate of our city glam girl comprises Asha Parekh, Ken Ghosh, Nita Lullah, Vishal Bhardwaj, Nadira Babbar and others.

Jim Caviezel: Pure passion

 It?s a classic tale of love found and lost, false friendship and betrayal, incarceration and escape, and, above all, red-hot revenge. And as in the case of Edmond Dantes, very personal. Yes, we?re talking about the 19th Century Alexandre Dumas classic, The Count of Monte Cristo. The inspirational story of one man?s fight for freedom and justice has sparked numerous screen adaptations, including Gerard Depardieu in the 1999 French edition and Richard Chamberlain in the 1974 version.

 But the one to be beamed on Star Movies on Friday night at 9 is the 2002 edition, with Jim Caviezel as the Count, Guy Pearce as the back-stabbing Fernand Mondego and Polish actress and Broadway beauty Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedes Iguanada, for whom it all began ? and ended.

 The Passion of the Christ might have made him famous, but Caviezel of those soulful eyes has always had the power to make audiences believe in the character. So who better to portray the plight of a young man wronged, back from the jaws of death, with a vengeance? And that?s exactly what happens, when he?s framed by his friend (Mondego) and is carted off to prison for life. But he escapes, acquires secret wealth and sets off on his quest for revenge.

 Not to forget a striking performance by another off-the-beaten-track actor. Having first shot to fame with LA Confidential, Guy Pearce?s most innovative performance was as a drag queen in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. The British-born Australian has since scorched the screen in films like Memento and Time Machine. Adding to the stellar cast is Richard Harris as Dante?s cell mate, Abbe Faria. 

 Oh, and don?t miss the fencing scenes between the duelling duo, as both former athletes (Pearce and Caviezel) insisted on doing it themselves, to make it look more real.

 Raunchy, naughty, very irreverent, completely adult and all about sex. Coupling, the late-night entertainment series on Star World at 10 on Saturday nights, definitely wears an ?A? tag. Currently into its fourth successful run on BBC, in the UK, it is now on offer here for all those with a wacky sense of humour.

 Coupling is all about six friends going through life with more adventures than most. Sounds familiar? Well, it?s definitely not Friends. All six are screwed-up human beings in their 30s, having a series of misadventures in the proverbial bedroom and then talking about them in detail, warts and all.

 All six are established comedians, which guarantees 30 minutes of pure caustic amusement and a bag full of laughs ? if you can catch the somewhat twisted humour. Also, some of the characters are actually based on real people. Not that it adds any sanity to the show. Don?t surf, enjoy.

 Mumait Khan: Going places

 She didn?t want to do the Dekh le number in Munnabhai MBBS. She just wasn?t interested in films and she hadn?t even heard of Vidhu Vinod Chopra. But after she did the hot item act in the Sanjay Dutt film, Mumait Khan became the new bod of Bollywood and was invited to nightclubs all across the country.

 Now, she has bagged another plum assignment. She appears as the ?Play Gal? in the new video Mere piya gaye Rangoon that is featured in a new remix album by Universal. For the music company, Mumait was always the only choice. As a spokesperson from Universal put it: ?We wanted a dancer for this song, a talented graceful actress and not just a pretty face. Mumait fitted the profile perfectly.? 

 But that?s not where the story ends. Universal is planning to launch this talented Indian model on the global showbiz platform by placing her with one of their big international artistes in his forthcoming video. It?s a toss up between the spoilt British popstar and the romantic Latino crooner. Who will Mumait shake her leg with? Let?s wait and watch.

 Bruce Willis: More muscle

 The ?dead man? of The Sixth Sense is really busy. Bruce Willis has his hands full ? from reprising his heroic self to playing Hollywood?s father! Just a sneak peek at Bruce?s kitty and you know that the West is more in love with mature men than the young kids on the block (read Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore?s kid hubby). 

 First up for Bruce is Hostage where he plays Jeff Talley, a former LAPD hostage negotiator who has moved himself away from his failed career outside of Los Angeles, and also away from his wife and daughter. When a convenience store robbery goes wrong, the three perpetrators move in on an unsuspecting family. Talley has to get everybody to survive the night using his rusty professional skills. 

 Next on the Bruce bill is Sin City, a collection of interweaving stories based in the corrupt, crime-infested hole of hell that is Basin City. A film-noir drama, the movie has Bruce playing an about-to-retire policeman, Hartigan, taken captive for a crime he didn?t commit.

 In another 2005 release, Lucky Number Slevin, directed by Paul McGuigan, Bruce has a comparatively smaller role in a film dealing with mistaken identity, co-starring Josh Harnett and Ben Kingsley. 

 The Nick Cassavetes film Alpha Dog has Bruce playing dad to Jesse James Hollywood, a drug dealer who became one of the youngest men ever to be on the FBI?s most wanted list. Other cast members include Sharon Stone, Justin Timberlake and Dominique Swain with Emile Hirsch playing Hollywood.

 And finally, Bruce will be back in the new edition of Die Hard as John McClane, who along with his daughter gets involved in a terrorist plot while on a holiday. If you can?t wait that long to catch Bruce in action, watch him on STAR Movies, Tuesday, 9 pm, as he stars in Mercury Rising. The film, which was remade in Bollywood as the Sunny Deol-starrer Champion, is about a brand new super code that is impossible to break.

 Expansion is the name of the game and STAR News has made a new addition to its variety-filled prime-time line-up. A daily crime bulletin, Sansani, will report the most recent crime-related news from around the country. To premiere on Monday, the bulletin will be aired at 11.30 pm all through the week from Monday to Friday. 

 The programme will try to recreate the actual scene of the crime as vividly as possible to give the viewing audience a real taste of the action as it happened. The show will aspire to bring the viewer face-to-face with the gory world of crime in the country. Sansani will also feature, at regular intervals, a Wanted section, which will alert viewers about criminals on the run. Another segment titled Crime Prevention will spell out precautions against crime and criminals. 

 Speaking on the launch of Sansani, Uday Shankar, CEO, STAR News said: ?TV viewers will be able to see for themselves the social relevance of crime-related news as well as the impressive investigative prowess of the STAR News team.?

Bobby Deol: Back in action

 He hasn?t been the big Bollywood champion that he was billed to be. But after a disastrous debut in Barsaat, the junior Deol puttar did get back into the groove with the Rajiv Rai thriller Gupt.

 He consolidated his filmi slot as the angry tough man in films like Badal and Bichhoo. And after the immensely forgettable Bardaasht opposite Lara Datta, Bobby is back playing a true patriot in Anil Sharma?s big-budget multi-starrer Ab Tumhare Hawaale Watan Saathiyon alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar.

 What?s more, Deol junior is coming to town on November 24 to promote this new film of his. And Calcuttans in love with his curly locks can get to meet him up close. 

 A contest, currently on, requires one to dial 9622010101 and answer a simple question. All valid and correct entries will enter a draw of lots for the final selection. The contest concludes at noon the day before Bobby?s in town. So get cracking.

 Unarticulated creative kinships

 That art has the power to tide over differences in boundaries, languages and time, forging strong, everlasting human ties is a fact already well known. Bonding, an exhibition of paintings by 52 contemporary artists from across the country, celebrates a different, special kind of bonding that exists among the art fraternity, specially between artists from Bengal and the rest of India. Jointly hosted by ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton Hotel and Art Pilgrim of Delhi, the show draws attention to interesting parallels in the style and substance of works of eminent artists of our times. These hitherto undiscovered similarities while bearing testimony to the artists? common ideals, inspirations and perceptions, nevertheless highlight the originality of each artist and his distinctive contribution to modern Indian art. Astonishingly clear parallels defined in the works of Ganesh Haloi and Prabhakar Kolte, Jogen Chowdhury and Bhupen Kakkar, Paritosh Sen and Krishen Khanna, Ganesh Pyne and Neeraj Goswami, Lalu Shaw and T Vaikuntam, and Wasim Kapoor, Sanatan Dinda and Vijender Sharma, among others, make this exhibition an absolute delight for the art connoisseur. Curator: Ratnottama Sengupta.

 Death run in extortion drive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two youths, who tried to stop a truck to collect Kali puja subscriptions, were killed when they were run over by the vehicle on the southern fringes of the city in the wee hours of Wednesday. 

 Palash Das, 18, and Subhasish Choudhury, 17, were killed on the spot at Joynagar?s Telipara intersection when the truck did not stop. According to police, the truck driver did not see the youths since it was dark and visibility was minimal. Both the youths were associated with a local puja organising committee and were collecting subscriptions from passing vehicles. The bloodstained bodies lay beside the road, and were discovered only after dawn. 

 A hunt has been initiated for the rogue driver, police said, and the bodies have been sent for autopsy.

 Trouble brewed in Tangra on Wednesday morning after members of the Kamakshya Sporting Club, located on DC Dey Road, discovered that an arm of their Kali idol along with another image was broken. Local residents blockaded the road for almost an hour from around 10.30 am demanding immediate police action. Deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division) Ranvir Kumar said a police contingent was deployed in the area to maintain order. 

 ?A probe into the matter has been initiated, though it is not clear at the moment why the club members left the idols unguarded at night. We are not sure whether the vandals belong to a local group or came from outside,? Kumar said. 

 Inspector-general of state police (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee on Wednesday said that district administrations had been asked to take adequate measures against eight puja committees for forcibly collecting puja subscription. Three of these are in North 24-Parganas, one each in South 24-Parganas, Hooghly and Murshidabad, and two in East Midnapore. 

 Altogether 26 complaints were lodged in this connection, and 45 persons have been arrested. Five men of Acharya Prafulla Sangha in Madhyamgram?s Hridaypur are among those arrested. Police along with Pollution Control Board officials will receive complaints and take action against noise pollution. 

 Between October 24 to November 9, at least 4,587 persons have been arrested in specific cases and there were 26,313 preventive arrests. Also, 57,000 litres of liquor and a total of Rs 2 lakh were seized from 60 places. Other seizures include 107 arms, 224 ammunition, 243,343 banned crackers and 1,762 packets of crackers.

 Pandals illegally encroaching upon road space invited the wrath of the traffic police top brass. A large number of puja pandals in parts of north, central and south Calcutta have severely hit pedestrian and vehicular movement. 

 The problem is acute in the Amherst Street area, with the main road reduced to a bottleneck and traffic slowing down to a snail?s pace. Residents complain that police look the other way since the puja committees are associated with influential people.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Rub it right, Thai style

Ship Shape

The lazy mans yoga is the latest 

luxury on offer at health spots around town. Himika Chaudhuri finds out 

just why

You could cancel that ticket you bought for a vacation 

to Thailand, expecting to spend a chilled-out weekend with liberal doses of massages 

thrown in. Thanks to a few health spots around town, Calcutta is ready to rub 

the Mecca of massage real close.

We not only follow the original Thai techniques, 

our masseurs, too, have trained and worked at Banyan Tree, the renowned Thai massage 

centre. The experience we offer is absolutely authentic, says Amitabh Rai, general 

manager of the Oberoi Grand. The Thai massage section at the Oberoi Spa is, in 

fact, run by Banyan Tree.

In quite another part of town, ITC Sonar Bangla has 

introduced massages known as lazy mans yoga in Thailand. The massages can 

help relieve stress, soothe the internal system, help in the free flow of blood 

and relax the muscles, explains Gurpreet, manager, Sonar Spa.

And if you want to bust some myths about Thai massage, 

just hear it from the masseurs. There are a lot of misconceptions about Thai 

massages. People have the impression that its something erotic, but it isnt 

so in the least bit. Traditional Thai massage is an art that one has to master 

over years. We are like doctors trying to help patients heal, points out Pavasu, 

the Thai supervisor at the Oberoi, here on a foreign assignment.

The Oberoi experience

The pampering at the Oberois plush indoor spa is 

felt to be believed. From the moment one steps into the first-floor address, the 

look, the aroma, the feel and the hospitality are all geared to fill up the senses, 

true Thai style. Petite Thai women welcome the guest to the first stopover the 

help desk where the kind of massage is decided. From the head, to the back, 

to the legs there is something for every part of the anatomy. 

While the true Thai massage is done without any oil, 

innovations allow for the Rejuvenating Thai Massage, which uses perfumed invigorating 

oil to enliven the body. A typical massage takes about 60 minutes, followed by 

a dip in a warm bath with rose petals, a cool shower and a refreshing cup of ginger 

tea.

The hand movements and focussed pressure on the body 

with oil of your choice (eucalyptus or jasmine) for a full hour release blockades 

and stretch the muscles, leaving the body relaxed and light. There are options 

of taking a massage alone or with a partner.

 Price: Rs 2,700, plus taxes

Masseur No. 1 at Sonar Spa

The baby-faced import from Thailand called Ooy (seen 

in the pictures) is the latest rage with guests because of her excellent massage 

techniques. In fact, even if you are suffering from intense arthritic pain, this 

young lady with a smile on her face knows how to offer relief, at least temporarily. 

The Thai room at the ITC Sonar Spa, like most of the other massage rooms, overlooks 

a waterbody that has an instant calming effect on the guest. Dressed in a white 

cotton kurta and pyjama, the guest is escorted to the Thai room where he or she 

is treated to an hour of massage, the focus of which is on relaxing the muscles 

by applying pressure on certain points of the body. 

No oil is used in this. We will soon start applying 

hot compress with Thai herbs after the massage, which will open the nasal channels 

and help in better breathing, besides energising the body, says Gurpreet.

Price: Rs 1,750, plus taxes

Oriental feel at Solace

The masseurs at this luxury centre in Sunny Park might 

not be straight from the Oriental destination, but they are all trained from the 

Watpo school of Thailand and promise to give you the traditional Thai touch. The 

Thai room here specialises in a dry massage that uses pressure techniques to heal 

a tired body.

 Price: Rs 625, plus taxes

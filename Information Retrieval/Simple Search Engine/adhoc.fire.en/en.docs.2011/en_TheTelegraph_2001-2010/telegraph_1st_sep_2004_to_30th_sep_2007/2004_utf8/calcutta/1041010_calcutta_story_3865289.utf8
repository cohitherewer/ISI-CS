Gizmos galore

DVD THIS amp; THAT

Every once in a while, technology takes a giant leap 

around the world, resulting in gadgets and gizmos that are great to look at and 

perform unbelievable feats. But more often than not, it takes us quite a while 

to see the products this side of the digital divide.

Featured here are latest innovations related to DVD 

and mobile phones ? both becoming more and more significant in our lives ? but 

as to their availability here, who knows when we?ll get lucky!

A fan dressed as a clone trooper shows the DVD box 

set of the Star Wars Trilogy (picture right) released recently in 

New York City. Japanese giant Sony unveiled its new DVD camcorder, the DVD Handycam 

DCR-DVD301 (picture above), in Tokyo. The 1.07 mega-pixel camera has a 

3.5-inch LCD display and a 3.2-32 mm/F1.8 - 2.3 Carl Zeiss vario-tessar zoom lens. 

An hour of digital video content can be recorded and stored on a 8 cm-diameter 

DVD RW (rewritable) or DVD R (writable) disk. Sony will put the camcorder in the 

market in October 2006 at an estimated price of 125,000 yen.

Yet another piece of tech marvel from the Sony stable 

is the paper made Blue-ray optical disk (picture left). Users can record 

more than two hours of high-definition movie content on a 25 GB-capacity optical 

disk. Made of paper, the disk can be destroyed with a pair of scissors for foolproof 

data security. So store more, ensure peace of mind and be environment friendly, 

too!

PHONE FETISH

It seems like something straight out of a science 

fiction film. An employee of Japans electronics major Mitsubishi Electric 

displays a prototype model of the reversible LCD display, reflected in a mirror 

(picture right). The screen enables users to display images on both sides 

of the unit. Mitsubishi unveiled the product at the CEATEC Japan, Asias 

largest electronics trade show at Makuhari, suburban Tokyo, last week.

If the LCD screen was out of a sci-fi film, this one 

sure looks like it?s out of a Dick Tracy movie (remember the detective with a 

TV on his watch?). Japans Sanyo has come out with the prototype model of 

a mobile phone with built-in digital TV tuner (picture left). The phone 

can receive TV programmes from mobile satellites beaming them. They can then be 

recorded or played back on the stamp-sized SD memory card.

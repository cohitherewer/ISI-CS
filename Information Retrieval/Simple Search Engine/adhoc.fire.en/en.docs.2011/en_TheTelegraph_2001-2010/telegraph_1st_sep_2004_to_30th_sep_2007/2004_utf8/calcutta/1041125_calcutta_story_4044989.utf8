 Gymnasts on roller-skates entertain spectators at a Russian Circus performance

 With Russian Circus fever peaking in the city and demand for tickets resembling that for a cricket ODI, a sudden cloud cover has been cast over the show on ice. And it has come from the Centre.

 The Central Zoo Authority (CZA), a statutory body under the Union ministry of environment and forests, has contended that the extravaganza, set to roll this Sunday, doesn?t have the required animal-exhibition clearances.

 In a letter despatched on Tuesday, CZA member-secretary B.K. Sharma has urged the local authorities to ?exercise powers? under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, 1960, to ?prohibit or restrict? exhibitory performance of animals.

 ??the government of India has put a ban on the performance of wild animals, namely lion, tiger, bear, leopard and monkey, under the PCA Act, 1960. The CZA has also come to know that the said circus has not obtained the necessary permission from the Animal Board of India for bringing the animals, as well as their performance,? Sharma wrote.

 The CZA missive has been addressed to the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, West Bengal government, the commissioner of police and the director, animal husbandry department, West Bengal, with a copy to the secretary.

 Rathin Banerjee, deputy conservator, headquarters (wildlife), said in Calcutta: ?Our role is two-fold ? to see if the show has a CZA clearance and whether they are exhibiting any of the animal species listed under the PCA Act. Our inspectors have been to the Netaji Indoor Stadium venue and The Russian Circus On Ice authorities fulfil both the criteria. There is no problem with the show.?

 However, when contacted by Metro on Wednesday, CZA scientist B.K. Gupta reiterated from the Capital that ?no permission was granted to the Russian Circus?. He added: ?They need the Animal Board of India permission to exhibit any animal, besides clearance from the regional authority of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.?

 The Russian Circus has on its roster around 100 birds, four northern sea lions, 13 Eskimo dogs and seven domestic cats. ?We had also applied for penguins and polar bears, but they were not sanctioned by the authorities,? Bhaswar Goswami, director, Celebrity Management Group, event managers, had said earlier.

 Said Neha Prasad Yadav, director, Choice Events and Trade, the company bringing the Russian team to India: ?We are fully aware of the permissions needed to be taken for the performing animals. We have got all the required permission documents from authorities like Animal Quarantine amp; Certification services, Central Zoo Authority and the Wildlife directorate.?

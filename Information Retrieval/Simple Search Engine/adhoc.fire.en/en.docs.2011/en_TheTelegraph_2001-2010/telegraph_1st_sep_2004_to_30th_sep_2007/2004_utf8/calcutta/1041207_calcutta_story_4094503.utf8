 Cops see insider in widow house raid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In an early morning swoop, a gang of armed youths raided the residence of 35-year-old widow Noor Jahan and escaped with Rs 20,000 in cash, and ornaments and documents worth around Rs 10 lakh.

 The break-in occurred at 33, Phears Lane, yards from Bowbazar police station. The gang entered the building around 3.30 am by breaking open the main door with a crowbar.

 Widowed seven years ago ? her husband had been killed in Kanpur, where he owned a tannery ? Noor lives with her mother. 

 Of the four youths who broke in, three went up to the first floor, broke the lock to Noor?s room and held her at gunpoint, before decamping with everything kept inside an almirah in the room. 

 Noor?s five sisters and five brothers claimed the incident could have been masterminded by their eldest brother, who could not tolerate her efforts to live on her own on the rent she earned from her husband?s properties in the city.

 Noor said her eldest brother could not also accept the fact that her mother had handed her the charge of a godown in Sreenath Babu Lane barely three months ago. 

 ?They even try to malign me by claiming I am having an illicit affair,? she said. 

 To ensure that her two sons get a proper education, Noor had admitted them to a boarding school in Kalimpong early this year. She had also kept aside a nest egg to fund their studies. 

 Police officers on the case refused to go into the details of the probe, but said it could be an ?insider job?.

 ?There are certain grey areas. How is it that when the gang was breaking open the locks, no one heard the noise or raised an alarm in such a congested area?? asked Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (detective department).

 It seems the gang had not targeted only Noor?s house. Investigations suggest the youths had first attempted to enter a house in Gopal Chandra Lane, but failed after the tenants on the ground floor woke up.

 They then tried to break into a shop on the ground floor of the building in which Noor Jahan lived, before entering her home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Liaison with legends

 People may be queuing up in his hometown for a go at their dream job, but as far as Gautam Bhimani is concerned, he?s already got it. From juggling a job in an advertising agency with a stint on FM radio in its earliest days to a reporter and now a presenter for ESPN STAR Sports, this Calcuttan has come a long way.

 ?My commentary debut was with the Adelaide test in December last year,? says Bhimani, in the city for the channel?s Harsha Ki Khoj ? the search for the next presenter on ESPN STAR Sports.

 The ESPN job happened in a ?strange way?. Following a graduate degree in communication from a US university, Bhimani was working as a copywriter in a city ad agency and RJ-ing in the mornings and evenings.

 ?We?d won a trip to Singapore as the third prize in a quiz. I went for a visit to the ESPN studios there and met Harsha and producer Raymond Hume. Ray probably liked what he saw and within a few days rang me up and I was in,? says Bhimani. ?But I had never imagined getting such a chance, not even in my dreams.?

 Four months into the job, in 2001, he was sent to Zimbabwe where he started doing side stories. ?There was this pub which had bar stools spilling over to the ground and I thought something could be done about the amazing atmosphere.? The short piece was liked so much that John Dykes jokingly asked on air: ?Who?s this guy, I want his job.?

 Then on, it was always the interesting things beyond the action on the pitch that Bhimani was up to. ?In Antigua, there were these people watching the match from trees, despite the ground having lots of empty seats. I asked and found out that it was their haunt for years. So I did a piece perched up in the trees with them.? Commentary from a helicopter or from the Antarctic base in New Zealand were some of the other interesting assignments.

 Rubbing shoulders with sporting legends and travelling to exotic locations count as some of the perks of his job, feels the bespectacled, non-athletic-looking Bhimani. ?But it?s the passion for cricket that makes it most enjoyable.?

 Up next, a full-fledged commentary stint alongside greats like Gavaskar, Boycott and the rest, though the sidelines would also find him in action. And right now, the son of Kishore and Rita Bhimani is loving every minute of his dream job.

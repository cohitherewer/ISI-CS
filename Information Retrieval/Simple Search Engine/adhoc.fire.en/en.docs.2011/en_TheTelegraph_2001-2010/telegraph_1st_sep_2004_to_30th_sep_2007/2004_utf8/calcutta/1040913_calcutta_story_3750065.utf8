 Task force to check train crimes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Booked luggage worth Rs 5 lakh gets stolen on the Varanasi-Howrah Bibhuti Express, reportedly near Mokama station, on September 12. A girl?s luggage gets stolen minutes before her getting off at Sealdah station. A city-based businessman is drugged barely half-an-hour before reaching Howrah. A woman gets raped by a railway cop on a local train near Hasnabad station. Another RPF constable, Jagdish Thakur, is killed in Jharkhand on September 4 night. 

 Worried over the growing incidents of crime on trains in the region, the state Government Railway Police (GRP), RPF, the railways and CID officials of various states have decided to join hands and fight back. 

 A high-level meeting will be held in Salt Lake later this month, Prasun Mukherjee, additional director-general, GRP, said on Sunday.

 ?Dacoities and drugging of passengers in train compartments have increased. But we need more intelligence on such crimes from the neighbouring states, which is why this conference has been planned,? Mukherjee said. 

 Officials of the Eastern, South Eastern and North East Frontier railways, CID officials of Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Assam and RPF personnel will be taking part in the meeting. 

 The talks will revolve around crime zones in the region, the modus operandi of inter-state gangs and ways and means to bust them. 

 ?Some of the gangs are taking advantage of the lack of coordination between police and intelligence in the states,? an RPF official said.

 In many cases, the official added, the passenger is drugged and robbed at one station while the crime could be traced to a station in another state. ?We need more information, especially on the criminals and their networks,? additional director-general Mukherjee said. 

 Sources revealed that the authorities would consider a proposal at the meeting for setting up an inter-state coordination team.

 Apart from passenger safety, the problem of damaging railway property has also become a cause of concern for the railway authorities. 

 On June 25, dacoits damaged a vacuum pipe in an AC three-tier coach of the Howrah-bound Mumbai-Howrah Mail before hopping off with the loot around 2 am in Bihar. The train was stranded throughout the night at Shibsagar station. Next morning, the train managed to reach Gaya at 40-kph speed.

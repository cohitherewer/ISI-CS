 Hollywood wonder world, just a click away

 Games and message boards, music and magic, question-answer sessions and mind-blowing graphics ? the stuff that Hollywood film websites are made of these days. It?s not just a synopsis of the film and a rundown of the cast and crew any more. These sites are interactive portals delving deep into the world of cinema.

 Sometimes, there are games and contests, often there are virtual shops selling film merchandise. There are production notes, with words and thoughts from producer and director to scriptwriter and actor. And there are always loads of film clips, photos and downloadable stuff like icons and wallpapers. They?re exercises in marketing and public relations to the power infinity, and it?s all in the name of publicity.

 The idea is to sell the film way before it?s even released. And once it?s on the big ? and small ? screen, they want you to keep coming back for more. Just log on to the website of your favourite film and you?ll see what we mean. The Village is all about horror, with a message board where you can post your scariest experience or read about others?.

 The Shyamalan factor is very much visible in the way the website is constructed, from downloadable desktop wall papers that change according to day and night, and clips from the film. Spider-Man has cell phone games, and fans can leave questions for co-producer Chris Grant to answer. The Warner Bros Harry Potter site is an entity in itself, from Daily Prophet news to the Marauder?s Map and the Sorting Hat, offering loads of trivia and fun games.

 Minority Report has a futuristic look with computer-generated images of machines and what cities will look like in the future, plus the chance to support the pre-crimes campaign through a vote. The Beautiful Mind site has code-breaking games to a Mensa IQ test. 

 The Shrek site has games within games to make Donkey into a steed (!) through a treasure hunt. Pixar?s The Incredibles site gives you a chance to be a superhero through a series of tests (strength to agility and more) and on the Garfield website, you can make your own wallpaper. Not to mention that while you wait for a download, Garfield wags his tail.

 The Alien Vs Predator site can be viewed in 11 different languages. And then there are sites like The Jersey Girl, which has a link to a daily diary by director Kevin Smith, who talks about the entire film-making process, but in a very informal, unofficial, though profane, manner. The plain speaking and the tit bits about the cast (with stars like Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler) and crew is, to say the least, very enlightening.

 The web experience is not just a visual delight but provides a lot of audio pleasure as well. The Kill Bill website, laced with Tarantino?s trademark and unapologetic style statements, has the amazing film soundtrack playing on the desktop. So as you enjoy the Flash images, you also get to hear the foot-tapping tracks ? Nancy Sinatra to 5,6,7,8.

 Listening to soundtracks or viewing clips, buying T-shirts or winning contests, or interacting with Hollywood personalities you would otherwise never have dreamed of, film websites are much more than just a synopsis of the film, show timings and ticket prices. Some don?t have too many details, while others are taken off the Net some time after the film is released. But most are updated to sell even the DVDs of the movies well after the theatres have had their fill.

 Just log on and enjoy the show.

 Potters magic with murals

 Artspace India, an arts complex based in Baruipur, celebrates the inauguration of its gallery in the city with an exhibition featuring the ceramic works of muralist Tamal Bhattacharya. Having specialised in mural design, this immensely gifted young artist reflects an eclectic personal style. Inspired by themes and designs that have both Oriental and Occidental antecedents, Bhattacharyas art seamlessly forges what is best in both to create beautiful ceramic objects that bear the stamp of his individuality. In consonance with his firm belief that murals offer enormous potential for creative exploration and development, his ceramic hangings and other works on show have been crafted from materials as diverse as glass, tiles, enamel tiles, fibre glass, wrapping paper, corrugated box and board, wood carvings, as well as a number of utility objects from everyday life.

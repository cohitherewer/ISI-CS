Fashion shows are passe. The coolest bash to be seen 

at now is a hair show. Calcutta got its share of the ?in thing? on Thursday evening 

as a team of expert hair designers from across the country displayed colours and 

cuts of the season as part of the city edition of the ?Oreal Professionnel country-wide 

gala.

The India leg of the event is an extension of a hair 

show that took place in Paris last month where Indian hair dressers shared a platform 

with international experts and came back with Indian interpretations of international 

styles. After Mumbai and Delhi, ITC Sonar Bangla was the venue for the third show 

in India ? the first ever Calcutta has seen.

othes for the show have been designed by Wendell Rodricks, 

paraded by top models, among them Nayanika Chatterjee Singh, Amanpreet Wahi and 

Aditya Bal. If Rodrick?s brilliant collection, taking in sporty track pants and 

jackets, passionate red flowing gowns and sexy pink nightwear, was a treat for 

the eye, the best was yet to come.

Six specialist hair designers (Sabina Yah and Raman 

Bharadwaj from Calcutta, Ayesha Riyazuddin from Mumbai, Sachin Dakoji from Hyderabad, 

Anahita Kohli from Pune and Sumit Israni from Delhi) gave the models a new international 

look on stage in 10 minutes flat. Judging from the loud response from the 1,000-strong 

crowd, the speed and perfection had proved infectious. The scissors snipped blink-and-you-miss-it 

fast. The 24-year-old Sumit Israni, the youngest member of the team, was brilliant 

with his styling.

Long hair is back in fashion this year for men. For 

women, the ?chic and versatile? feel goes perfectly with a fringe.

The Vintage Amber-look, the theme for Autumn-Winter 

2004, uses Mahogany Amber, Golden Amber and Ash Amber shades.

?This time the stress is on texturing the hair. We 

are using three colours in different layers so there is a feeling of movement,? 

explained Sabina. ?The hair will look different depending on how you part it,? 

added Raman.

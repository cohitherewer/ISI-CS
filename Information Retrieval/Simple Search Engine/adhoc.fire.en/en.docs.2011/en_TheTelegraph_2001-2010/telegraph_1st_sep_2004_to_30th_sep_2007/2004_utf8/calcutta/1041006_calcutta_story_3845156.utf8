 He?s been off the field for almost a month now due to injury. But when the badshah of Indian football Bhaichung Bhutia walked into the Park Street store of Burlingtons? on Tuesday afternoon, dressed in a crisp cotton shirt and denims, he looked in great shape. 

 One of the best dressed men in Calcutta?s celeb circuit, Bhutia was at the fashion address to try on some cool linen outfits that the men?s garment store is showcasing as part of Indian Rayon?s Linen Utsav. 

 ?I think this fabric is just right for the Calcutta weather,? said Bhaichung, sporting a bright orange party shirt before going the Salman Khan way in front of lensmen to change into an olive green shirt and a white-and-black striped jacket. 

 ?Polyester is pass? and linen is the fabric that is doing well internationally now. Unfortunately in India, the awareness is not so high,? said Ratul Sood of Burlingtons?.

 The store is stocking formal, semi-formal and casual linen shirts in solid colours. The high point of the collection, however, remains a range of light-weight jackets. Prices begin at a few hundred rupees and quickly climb to a few thousand.

 ?Calcuttans may be fast matching their Mumbai and Bangalore counterparts in the trend factor, but they can still do with notching up a few more points on that score,? offered the pin-up boy of Indian soccer, before darting off to do what he likes best ? catch a game of football at Salt Lake stadium.

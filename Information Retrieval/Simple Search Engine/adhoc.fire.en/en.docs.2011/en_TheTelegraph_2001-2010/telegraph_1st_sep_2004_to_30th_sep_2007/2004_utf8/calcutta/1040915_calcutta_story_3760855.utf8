The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Tata Young may keep on screaming dhoom macha le, dhoom macha le but it is the Sunidhi Chauhan (picture right) version which has rocked the country and made Dhoom the huge hit it is. Sunidhi, who has now been branded an item-number specialist in Bollywood, has been belting out one power-packed track after the other and all of them have propelled the prospects of the respective films.

 But had it not been for one kind soul in tinsel town, Sunidhi might not have made the item cut. Reportedly, the singer who first shot to fame with the telly talent hunt show Meri Aawaz Suno couldn?t hit the high-pitch notes. That automatically stopped her from singing a certain type of numbers which obviously did include all those soaring item songs providing the right pitch for the bump-and-grind routines that action films these days ride on.

 So in stepped doctor Sonu Nigam. ?It was her father who came to me requesting me to help Sunidhi out. After some sittings with her, we were able to sort out the problems and she could render the high- pitched numbers with ease. You can say I gave her something that she needed the most,? smiled Sonu. 

 It is also not a coincidence that Sunidhi?s first big break happened under the musical baton of Sandeep Chowtha in Ram Gopal Varma?s Mast. In the film, while Sunidhi did have solos, almost all her duets were with Sonu and boy, did guru and shishya rock together.

 Shilpa Shetty: Look no further

 She did away with the false eyelashes and revamped her wardrobe. While she did make the critics? cut, Shilpa Shetty couldn?t woo the audiences to the halls with her histrionic skills in Phir Milenge. That might, however, prompt the actress to return to her UP, Bihar lootne methods. Anyway, she had promised during the release of the Revathy film that even the best of roles cannot stop her from doing her naachna-gaana.

 So get ready to watch Shilpa sizzle again in her forthcoming films. While all Bollywood is abuzz about this hot item number which she does in Deepak Tijori?s Khamosh, it is the other Tijori film which Shilpa is all excited about. 

 ?I had taken some time to sign Khamosh but once Deepak promised me that it will be over in all of 25 days, I had said ?yes?. And before I knew it, I was doing this other film with him ? Fareb opposite Manoj Bajpai.?

 And now with sister Shamita part of the Fareb cast, Shilpa is over the moon. Last heard, she was sending text messages to music director Anu Malik, which read: ?Anu, you are God. I heard the Fareb numbers and they were fabulous. Now with Shamita in the film, let?s make this film rock.?

 It?s difficult to handle one Shetty in a film. Now with the two featuring in the same frame, the Mallikas and Amritas better watch out? 

Vera Farmiga: Femme fatale

 After some heavy-duty thrillers on the big screen, 

it?s time to make way for the dark and mysterious world of undercover espionage 

on the small screen. The new series on Star World, UC: Undercover which 

premiered on Tuesday promises to do just that.

 From the co-writer of Hollywood blockbusters Shaft and Armageddon comes this complex action-thriller which focuses on the secret lives and private demons of an elite justice department crime fighting unit that confronts the country?s most untouchable lawbreakers by going undercover to bust them. 

 The unit is headed by authoritative Donovan (Oded Fehr of The Mummy fame) and comprises undercover agents Jake Shaw (Jon Seda) and Alex Cross (Vera Farmiga in picture above), psychological profiler Monica Davis (Bruklin Harris) and young techno-wizard Cody (Jarrad Paul) who runs all the high-tech surveillance operations. The team is often at loggerheads with Paul Bloom (Brian Markinson, who appeared in Enemy of the State), their obstructive and fiercely ambitious, career-climbing justice department boss. 

 As a federal team, the close-knit group can respond to emergencies all over the country, taking down elite bank robbers, drug kingpins, domestic terrorists, spies, jewel thieves and dirty cops. 

 You can also catch more familiar faces of the big screen in William Forsythe (The Rock) who plays murderous master thief Jack ?Sonny? Walker and Steven Bauer (Traffic) who plays imprisoned drug lord Carlos Cortez. 

 The series explores the psychological toll undercover work takes on the agents who play this deadly game of false identities and for whom treachery comes with the job. 

 Watch without being seen, listen without being heard, and seduce without being seduced ? that?s what this team of agents and experts specialises in, day in and day out. So tune in to UC: Undercover every Tuesday at 9 pm on Star World. 

 Cricket is not where all the TV bidding action is. 

 The famous MGM lion is all set to roar ? in Japanese. Immediately following the news of movie channel HBO moving out of the Sony bouquet of channels and joining Zee-Turner in India, comes word of Sony Corporation buying out the famous Metro Goldwyn Mayer studios in Hollywood.

 What that means for the Indian viewer, among other things, is an English movie channel from the Sony stable, very soon. 

 Though there?s no official word yet, the channel ? backed by the might of MGM content ? may be launched as early as the end of this year. 

 What that also means is that Zee MGM ? with dwindling viewership and fortunes ? will cease to exist.

 Sony Corp, leading a consortium, will shell out nearly $3 billion for MGM. It will also assume MGM?s debt of about $1.9 billion. 

 Sony, second in the race, clinched the deal when Time Warner withdrew its bid, after being unable to agree on a price with MGM.

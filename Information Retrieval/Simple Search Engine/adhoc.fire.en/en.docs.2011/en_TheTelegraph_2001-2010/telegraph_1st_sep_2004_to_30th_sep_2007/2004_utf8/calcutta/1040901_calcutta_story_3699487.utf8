 Cylinder shortage hits LPG supply

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Planning to buy a new oven and an LPG cylinder before the Pujas? Think again. Chances are the oil companies are not going to provide any new LPG connections before the year-end.

 Register your name with the nearest LPG dealer, but dont expect a new connection immediately. It will take at least three to four months, warned A.C. De, deputy general manager (LPG), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

 Corporation officials attribute the delay in providing new connections to short supply of cylinders. 

 Manufacturers of LPG cylinders, belonging to the private sector, have stopped supplying new cylinders from June, demanding a price hike. Earlier, consumers used to be given new connections soon after they registered their names with the dealers and there was also no restriction on the supply of single or double cylinders.

 We have plenty of cooking gas, but there is a problem with the supply of new cylinders. We are negotiating with the cylinder manufacturers on a revision of prices, but a final decision can be taken only by the petroleum ministry, De pointed out.

 It will take at least three to four months to finalise the process. As soon as the supply of new cylinders is restored, we will start giving new connections. However, consumers with connections need not worry, as refilling will not be hit, De said.

 The number of applications for new LPG connections has gone up to nearly two lakh. The maximum demand is expected before the Pujas, as people of the middle-income group generally spend part of their Puja bonus to get a cooking gas connection. Nearly 2,000 new LPG connections are provided to consumers in the city every day.

 We buy new cylinders from manufacturers for Rs 709, but they want a hike of at least Rs 150 per cylinder, as the price of steel has gone up. They are unwilling to supply new cylinders till the price hike is accepted. We are awaiting the Centres response to the demand, IOC officials said. 

 Petroleum ministry officials have hinted that the problem may continue longer, as the Centre has expressed its inability to provide subsidy to the cylinder manufacturers. The ministry is planning to increase the deposit money from Rs 650 to Rs 950.

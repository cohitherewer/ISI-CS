 Designer Ray

 The genius of Satyajit Ray reached far beyond the realms of movie making. He was, as we know, an accomplished writer and music composer as well. But no less than that was his talent as a designer and an artist. Perhaps due to his professional stint in advertising prior to joining the world of films, Ray took great care in designing the artwork for posters, banners and other publicity material for his films. Ray?s Cinema Away from Cinema, the ongoing exhibition of film memorabilia from his films, celebrates the versatile creative genius of the master filmmaker, screenplay writer, artist and designer par excell ence. Diligently compiled over the years by Parimal Ray, the collection on show comprises posters, lobby cards, booklets and original drawings and sketches by Satyajit Ray. Also on show are the collections of Sandip Ray. Featuring posters, booklet cover-designs, notes and drawings in original scripts from Ray?s self-acknowledged masterpieces like Charulata and Kanchenjungha, as well as from hits like Ghare Baire, Sonar Kella, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, the exhibition is a must-see for the art and cinema connoisseur.

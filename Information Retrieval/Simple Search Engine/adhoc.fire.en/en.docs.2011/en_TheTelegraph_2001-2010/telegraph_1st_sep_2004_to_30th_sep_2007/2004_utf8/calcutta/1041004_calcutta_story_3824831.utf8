The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

Turning into a hog

And why not, with all the star hotels in town fighting for that space in your 

tummy. Chuck that killer diet for a while and go on a culinary sojourn of recipes 

from across the country. Spoil yourself for choice, what with the Kenilworth offering 

a Rajasthani fare, a royal Raj menu being served at Grand, choice delicacies from 

Lucknow on offer at ITC Sonar Bangla and just about every eatery worth its salt 

and pepper hitting the revamp route. While at it, do spare a thought for your 

insides.

Feeling spaced out

Globetrotting 

is boring. Start saving up for the ride of your life, beginning 2007, when Britain?s 

Richard Branson promises to offer the world?s first passenger service to space. 

So scuttle your plans for that Singapore trip yet again, for the zero-gravity 

flight climbing roughly six times higher than commercial flights will cost the 

earth ? $198, 600 ? as start-up. And all for four minutes of weightlessness, a 

view of the horizon from 1,200 miles up and possibly a shot of gin if a liquor 

licence works out. Who said rising above worldly matters comes for free?

Opening a style file

If you?ve been toying with career options or brimming over with crazy ideas, enroll 

in a fashion design course right away. Find a role model in Pepsi, er, Sabyasachi, 

to convince folks. It?s designer darzis with drive who can fly all the 

way from London to Milan and back while the furthest a call centre job took your 

cousin Sunny was to pubtown Bangalore or aamchi Mumbai.

Going balle balle

So much has been written and said about Gurinder Chadha?s new Punjabi pot-boiler 

Bride and Prejudice (aka Balle Balle: Amritsar to LA), that the 

film automatically becomes the must-watch Friday release. Ash mouthing Austen?s 

lines, doing the bhangra with Martin Henderson, giggling her way to Madame 

Tussaud?s glory? it?s all set up for a masala date with makki di roti and 

sarson da saag, Chadha style?

Playing at work

If your office is one of those wired hi-tech places then it?s about time you started 

making good use of the text messaging system. Flirt outrageously, Bridget Jones-style, 

without so much as a whisper. From behind the tech veil, let your latest crush 

know how you feel about every move he makes. Bitching about the boss when he expects 

you to slog at the witching hour is now oh-so-safe. Mixing business with pleasure 

couldn?t have been more discreet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

In tune with fitness of things

Sit back and enjoy an evening of retro rock, swing 

jazz or trip-hop. Be immersed in the ebb and flow of a Cup final on the giant 

screen at the sprawling sports bar. Catch up with a friend over a quiet drink 

in the cigar lounge while the kids have a ball at the juice bar or the dartboard?

The latest entrant to Calcutta?s club circuit, Princeton 

Club on Prince Anwar Shah Road, promises a ?true-blue international clubbing experience? 

to its members, with a basket of facilities and ?round-the-year? activities.

?The club was created after painstaking research both 

within and outside the country and designed for all-round development of the members 

and family, in addition to providing quality entertainment in a relaxed ambience,? 

says Sushil Mohta, managing director, Merlin Group, developers of the property.

The hub of activity will be the 4,000-sq ft sports 

bar, ?the largest of its kind in the city?. Says general manager P.S. Rawat: ?Live 

music of different genres will be an integral part of the sports bar. We will 

also use the place as a platform to launch aspiring young bands, giving them a 

platform to showcase their talent.?

The overhead projector and the gigantic wall-to-wall 

screen will be used to beam top-draw soccer ties like the FA Cup final, key Premiership, 

La Liga matches and Champions League action. The collapsible partition can create 

a separate arena for children, complete with pool, dart, aerobics and home theatre.

?We are also planning to revive the Sunday noon movie 

slot for kids, besides screening a children?s film festival this winter,? the 

general manager adds. The posh cigar lounge, with a specially designed exhaust 

system and a separate glass cubicle for smokers, is another USP that can be used 

for business meetings or as a cosy hangout for friends.

The fully air-conditioned 60,000-sq ft club also includes 

a chic health spa featuring a gym fitted with Technogym gear, jacuzzi, sauna, 

steam, an outdoor swimming pool and a health food centre. An ?exclusive three-boardroom 

facility with secretarial services and hi-tech communication devices, high-end 

indoor and outdoor banqueting facilities? can accommodate up to 300.

Two plush 60-seater multi-cuisine restaurants and 

an open-air cafeteria on the first floor offer both fine dining and pure vegetarian 

options, along with private party space in the banquets and outdoor landscaped 

lawns, with personalised catering.

?We are looking at compartmentalising working hours 

into specific slots for value-addition to all members of the family,? says Rawat. 

For instance, lessons in modern dance for kids will be organised in tandem with 

Padatik, besides cookery and stitching classes.

 Private help sought to plug vast housing gap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Private participation is the key in any serious effort to address the 7.1-million shortfall in housing stock identified in the latest census, according to the state government. 

 ?There?s no way we can meet this huge demand by going it alone and we have to take the help of the private sector to plug the gap,? Dilip Kumar Dutta, secretary, state housing department, said on Tuesday.

 Dutta was speaking at a media conference to introduce three joint-sector housing projects in Action Area II of New Town, Rajarhat, foundation stones of which will be laid by former chief minister Jyoti Basu on Wednesday. State housing minister Gautam Deb and Shyamal Sen, chairman of the West Bengal human rights commission, will also be present.

 The three projects, all coming up in joint venture with West Bengal Housing Board, will offer 1,566 dwelling units in the next 34 months, in the LIG, MIG and HIG segments. 

 Hiland Woods, The Sunrise Point and Akankha are being developed by Bengal United Credit Belani Housing Ltd, Bengal Park Chambers Housing Development Ltd and Bengal Shelter Housing Development Ltd, respectively.

 Saying that the government was looking at 10 joint-venture partners in all, the housing secretary also revealed plans for ?assisted PPP (public-private partnership)? where the holding of the state can be ?as less as 11 per cent?. 

 ?We are encouraging private promoters to come and work with us in a systematic manner, which would also ensure there?s greater transparency and accountability in the housing segment,? stressed R.N. Roychowdhury, housing board vice-chairman.

 Housing secretary Dutta promised a much faster rate of growth for support infrastructure in New Town over the next five years. ?De-silting of the Kestopur canal has been taken up and the surface water will be treated and supplied to the residents of Rajarhat. Community markets, medical facilities and educational institutions will also be in place by the time these projects are ready,? he said.

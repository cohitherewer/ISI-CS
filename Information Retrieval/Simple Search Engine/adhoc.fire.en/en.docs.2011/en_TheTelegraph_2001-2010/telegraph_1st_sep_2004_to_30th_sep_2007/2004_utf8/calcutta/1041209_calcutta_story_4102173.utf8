 Reliving the magic

 The Imdadkhani gharana has been associated with a rich musical heritage that faithfully recalls the masterful genius of Ustad Imdad Khan and Ustad Enayet Khan. The demise of Ustad Vilayat Khan, who preserved and bore the long and glorious lineage of these two sitar maestros to concert halls across the world, signalled the end of an era of a hallowed musical tradition. In a touching tribute to the legendary Ustad, his brother Ustad Imrat Khan presents a sitar-surbahar recital that promises to bring alive the refined elegance and sophisticated skill in playing the sitar, a hallmark of the Imdadkhani legacy. No less a luminary in the horizon of classical music himself, Imrat Khan?s performance offers a rare opportunity to experience the magical artistry of this exponent of the Imdadkhani tradition.

 Event: Sitar and surbahar recital by Ustad Imrat Khan

 When: Today at 6 pm

 Where: The Ramkrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Vivekananda Hall, Gol Park

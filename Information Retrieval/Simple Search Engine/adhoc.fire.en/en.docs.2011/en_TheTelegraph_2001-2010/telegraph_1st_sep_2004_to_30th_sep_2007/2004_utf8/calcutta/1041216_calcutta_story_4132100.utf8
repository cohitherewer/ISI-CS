 Crazy for corn, chocolate

 - GenX takes to steaming cups of special-recipe boiled grain and any which kind of brown

 From nolen gurer rasogolla and bhutta to wine-based chocolates and Butter Lemon Salt Corn, the hottest haunts in town are redefining traditional winter treats. Maybe not in fundamentals ? sweet tooth and fun munch ? but definitely in form, as malls serve up a combo meal for buyers and browsers.

 Simply Corn has grown ?enormously? since its inception in Forum in February 2004, says Mohit Tikmani, proprietor of Enerzy Caf? and the chain. ?Boiled corn has been popularised to such an extent abroad that I thought of opening up a chain in the city,? he explains.

 The popular corn has invaded Landmark, 22 Camac Street, Swabhumi, City Centre and more. The Forum counter notches up 3,500 glasses every month. Priced at Rs 25 for a 150 ml pack and Rs 35 for 200 ml, corn has caught on big time with the youth brigade. Winter, of course, is the best season for steaming cups, with special recipes like Butter Corn, Butter Lemon Salt Corn, Masala Lemon Salt Corn, Chatpata Masala Corn (with onions, capsicum and tomatoes) and Cheese Corn.

 As for chocolates, the city suddenly finds itself in the grip of a mini invasion. Patchi?s second outlet in the country at Forum (after Crossroads in Mumbai) that opened last weekend has recorded sales of ?over 650 kg? in just two days.

 ?The spending power for global goods has been on the upward swing here. We also know that when it comes to chocolates, there?s no particular group to target,? says Pulak Chamaria, president (India), Patchi, which has a presence in 29 countries. On the flavour front, the hand-made chocolate chain claims the city is playing it safe by sticking to the milky way, for starters.

 At Belgique, in Forum and City Centre, the USP is that the chocolates are darker, and the biggest draws are the hazelnut, almond and wine-based concoctions. But at Candy Treats, anything goes, claims proprietor Manjari Tibrewal. The pick-and-mix range of gummy bears, sugar-free teddy bears and much more may cost anything between Rs 60 and a few thousand at one go, but that can?t stop the Calcuttan craving for more.

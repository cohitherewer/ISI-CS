 Rent rule cry for Town Hall

 BARUN GHOSH

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s decision to allow the BJP a free run of the Town Hall for a party workers? convention has prodded mayoral council member Mainul Haque Chowdhury to call for ?a defined set of rules? on letting out the heritage auditorium.

 ?Though the mayor has the prerogative to offer the hall either on rent or free to organisations, a definite set of rules could help better management,? said Chowdhury.

 ?We are yet to frame guidelines for commercially using the renovated Star theatre. We should also frame some rules for utilisation of the Town Hall,? said the mayoral council member, in charge of culture and education.

 ?I personally feel the hall should not be given free to the BJP for organising a workers? convention there,? he added.

 The mayor, now in Senegal, could not be contacted.

 Several members of the Town Hall Society and state heritage commission have protested the mayor?s decision to allow the state BJP unit free use of the hall for a workers? convention on December 10, to be addressed by party president L.K. Advani.

 A civic official said on Tuesday that the Town Hall was let out mostly to cultural organisations, recreation clubs and educational institutions, ever since being thrown open to the public in May 2002.

 ?Any organisation using the hall for four hours a day has to pay Rs 3,000. The mayor does make concessions for special cases,? he explained.

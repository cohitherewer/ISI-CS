BIGGEST MUSICAL EXTRAVAGANZAS HELD ACROSS THE GLOBE ROUND THE YEAR

If variety is the spice of life, then music is lifeblood. 

Imagine a world without music and you get cacophony or silence. Think music and 

you cant forget the annual festivals and concerts that happen globally. And who 

better than Calcuttans to appreciate great music, with their in-depth knowledge 

and understanding.

Old memories revisited conjure up tantalising images 

and sounds Lou Majau, Louis Banks, Pam Crain, Usha Uthup, Skinny Alley, Nondon 

Bagchi most of them still entertain the young and not-so-young with their rocking 

performances and voices.

While we are still a far cry from the annual international 

extravaganzas blame it on the lack of sponsors there is no denying that the 

scene is on a revival route. Congo Square is trying to bring back Jazz Yatra and 

the Bangla Band Rock Festival is attracting its fair share of fans.

In the West, summer is a season of sun, fun and music, 

a potent cocktail that provides a heady atmosphere where anything can happen (and 

it does), contributing to an experience of a lifetime.

Go through a list of the number of festivals that 

happen every year and youll get the picture. Most of them last several days, 

and is as much about culture as good music, from New Orleans to San Francisco, 

London to Switzerland, Rio de Janeiro to Argentina and beyond. Whats more, these 

events usually have a social cause raising money for charity.

The Good Life takes you on a tour of three 

of the biggest and the best. If you want to catch some of the magic, buy the DVDs 

or CDs of the previous years events, from a music store near you. Satisfaction 

guaranteed for music aficionados.

Glastonbury Festival

In the summer of 70, 1,500 bohemians gathered at 

Worthy Farm, Pilton, in Somerset, south-west England, and paid one pound each 

to listen to a few mostly-unknown bands. On June 25, 2004, the now-three-day affair, 

hailed as one of the largest open-air music festivals in the world, played host 

to some of the biggest names in the international music industry like Oasis, to 

living legends like Paul McCartney.

The Glastonbury Festival has become a Mecca for music-lovers, 

who come from around the world to worship their god music, mainly of the rock 

genre. 

And its not just a showcase of the well-known either, 

for theres an amateurs stage where newcomers can flaunt their skills and test 

their talent on a discerning audience.

Its a messy affair, with a mix of mud stirred up 

by the inevitable British rain, makeshift tents for campers and temporary toilets 

that arent always well kept. But of the around 140,000 visitors this year, about 

a quarter were volunteers, trying to clean up after the chaos. However, there 

is enough drinking, dancing, merry-making, raunchy revelry and of course, music, 

to forget the minor irritations.

Chew on the fact that this years line-up included 

Nelly Furtado, Black Eyed Peas, Basement Jaxx, The Chemical Brothers, PJ Harvey 

and more thats only an appetiser of what was on the menu.

Rock in Rio

Initiated in Rio de Janeiro, the festival this year 

shifted to Lisbon, Portugal. The event is about rock, popular and Brazilian music, 

which this year was extended to include Portuguese performers.

It is set in four parts the World Stage, the Roots 

Tent, Better World Tent and the Electronics Tent. There was plenty of international 

music, too, including the big names like Britney Spears, five-time Grammy winner 

Alicia Keyes, Sting, Foo Fighters, Evanescence, Peter Gabriel, Metallica and, 

once again, Sir Paul McCartney. Even Brazilian minister of culture, Gilberto Gil, 

sang for the crowd.

May 29 to July 6, Bela Vista Park saw a total of 120 

hours of show time, with about 100 acts and close to 400,000 fans. The World Stage 

featured the stars, while the Roots Tent gave local musicians a chance to be heard. 

The Better World Stage had discussions for a cause, like HIV/AIDS. The Electronics 

Tent had DJs spinning tracks.

Rock in Rio, say organisers, is due back in Lisbon 

in 2006. Not to be missed.

Montreal Jazz Festival

Salsa, Latin and Motown, jam sessions that extend 

into the early hours of the morning, blues, world, rock--roll and some good ol 

jazz thats the Festival International de Jazz de Montreal. Except, it doesnt 

begin to sum up the magic of one of the best music festivals in the world.

Andre Menard and co-founder Alain Simard in 1979 created 

the festival as it is now a 12-day orgy of various musical experiences, free 

or ticketed. 

The best part, however, is that during this time, 

wherever you go in the beautiful French-Canadian capital of Quebec, you are bound 

to encounter jazz musicians, performing or just hanging out. And a smile is usually 

greeted with a charming hello.

This year, from June 30 to July 11, almost two million 

music-lovers made their way to Montreal, drinking in the sights and sounds of 

the silver jubilee celebrations of the festival.

Diana Krall, Elvis Costello, Tony Bennett, Keith Jarrett, 

George Benson, Patricia Barber, Dianne Reeves, Bettye Lavette, Jon Paris, Sonny 

Greenwich, Philip Catherine and so many more, capped off with Cirque du Soleil 

on closing night. Any surprise, then, that the Montreal affair is referred to 

as the heavyweight champion of jazz festivals?

Robbie rewind

 British popstar Robbie Williams has announced plans 

for releasing his greatest hits album. Imaginatively titled Greatest Hits, 

the 19-track compilation would feature his early hits like Angels, Millennium 

and Supreme, as well as more recent releases like Come Undone and 

Feel. Two new tracks, Radio and Misunderstood, also find 

place in the album, the latter set to be included in the upcoming Bridget Jones: 

The Edge of Reason movie soundtrack. Scheduled for a mid-October release, 

the compilation however misses out on Williams reworking of the Sinatra classic 

Somethin Stupid with Nicole Kidman, and his debut single Freedom.

Veteran rockers REM, meanwhile, announced the tracklisting 

of their new album Around The Sun. This would be the bands 16th album 

and the follow-up to 2001s Reveal. A single, Leaving New York is 

expected towards the end of September. The band is currently finishing the 13-track 

album, slated for an October 4 release and preparing for the Vote for Change 

concerts.

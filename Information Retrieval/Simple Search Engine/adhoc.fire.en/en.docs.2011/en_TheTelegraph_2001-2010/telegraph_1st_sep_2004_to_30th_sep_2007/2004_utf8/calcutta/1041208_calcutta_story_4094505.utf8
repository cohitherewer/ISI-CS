The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The delegate registration fee at the Kolkata Film Festival this year was raised 

to Rs 300. I have learnt that the delegate fee at the international film festival 

at Goa is only Rs 200. The facilities at the festival were almost the same as 

last year then why the fee hike? It was also disappointing to note that new children?s 

films, eagerly awaited by many like me, were not shown in the afternoon slot at 

Sisir Manch this time. Even last year, films produced by the Children?s Film Society 

of India were an integral part of the festival. The organisers should also publish 

the screening schedule in a few leading dailies before the start of the festival. 

The programme schedule supplied while issuing the delegate cards was very useful, 

though.

 The Kankurgachhi island on CIT Road has become a high-risk zone for pedestrians, 

especially during the evening peak hours. Vehicles coming from Maniktala turn 

left at the intersection even at a red light. Pedestrians wait patiently but by 

the time the traffic flow ends, the lights turn green and vehicles from other 

directions speed down the road. This makes it an even more daunting task to cross 

the road. I request the traffic authorities to check if anything is wrong with 

the traffic signal at the crossing and conduct awareness drives for the benefit 

of drivers and pedestrians.

 Ashok Kumar Ghosh, CIT Road. 

 It is ironical that the footpath opposite the All India Institute of Health 

and Public Hygiene is so dirty. Passers-by spit and urinate near the building. 

It?s shocking how people lack even the basic civic sense. Strict action should 

be taken against those who dirty the place, especially since the institute is 

of strategic important in the health system. 

 Anil Kumar Sen, Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. 

 Crime has shot up in the Jadavpur, Behala and Garden Reach areas because they 

are partly under the state police and partly under the Calcutta Police. These 

areas are also under the jurisdiction of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation despite 

belonging to South 24-Parganas. Criminals find it convenient to commit a crime 

in a state police area and seek shelter in the Calcutta Police area or vice versa, 

fully aware that there is a lack of coordination between the two units. All police 

stations in these areas should be brought under the jurisdiction of Calcutta Police 

to solve this problem. Perhaps, because of paucity of personnel in the districts 

in comparison with Calcutta, the thanas under state police are finding 

it difficult to cope with the pressure of such a large population. Such a move 

will also better the traffic situation in these areas.

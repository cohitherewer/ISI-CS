The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sparing them a thought

 9/11 will never be the same again. It took a few seconds of an otherwise normal day to wreak havoc in the lives of so many people. It was the global community that had been ravaged, a community that included the victims, their families and the world at large that was shaken out of normalcy to take cognisance of one of the most perverse forms of humanity gone awry. A black day that has spurred off a chain of events that has jeopardised peace and brotherhood in the name of avenging the wrongs done to society. Alternative Living Theatre has breathed a different meaning into the already sordid turn of events on that fateful day. 9/11 is projected as a day that has spelt doom for women worldwide. As the world got embroiled in a chaotic melange of destruction, little thought was given to the plight of the millions of women whose lives were being torn apart with the death of every father, son, brother and husband. Amma, directed by Probir Guha, takes a long hard look at these women who are being unthinkingly sacrificed to the evil of death and devastation.

 Event: Experimental theatre Amma by Alternative Living Theatre

 When: Today; 6.30 pm

 Where: Padatik Open Theatre, 6/7 AJC Bose Road, Calcutta 17

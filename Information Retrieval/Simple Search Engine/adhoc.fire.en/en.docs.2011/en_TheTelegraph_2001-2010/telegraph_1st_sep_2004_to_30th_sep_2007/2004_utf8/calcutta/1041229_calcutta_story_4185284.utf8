The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Party countdown

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

New 

Year?s Eve is promising to get more varied by the day. The run-up to The Telegraph 

New Year?s Eve party to be held at the Saturday Club began on December 26, with 

an evening of filmi entertainment brought together by 10-year-old city-based 

contemporary dance troupe Beat Busters. 

 Titled Bollywood Dreams, this one-and-a-half-hour-long medley of choreographed sequences traced Hindi films from the time of Shola jo bharke?right on to Seekh le? 

 The Yuletide cheer in the chilly Sunday evening on the club lawns was unmistakable as the party people ate and drank their fill, swaying to their favourite numbers.

Dancers dressed as Mumtaz, Sridevi, Jeetendra and 

Anil Kapoor and video clippings to go with the Gabbar mix sequence that brought 

with it some smashing hits from R.D. Burman?s stable, portrayed the changing face 

of Bollywood in style. While compere Amit Fuar, coming up after every sequence 

dressed in clothes to depict what was next in line, added to the entertainment. 

 ?We have done 15 shows of this production and now we intend to take this abroad,? said head of the troupe Soujit Das, himself an accomplished dancer.

 Silk sojourn

 Silk is by all means the fabric of the season, more so with the winter chill finally setting in after giving the city a miss till late last week. 

 Textile designer Sujata Sarawgi has timed her day-long exhibition well, on Wednesday, at Cinnamon Gallery (1, Upper Wood Street) with some select hand-woven and hand-printed tussars. 

 ?I?ve used silks, basically tussars, woven by master craftsmen of West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra,? said Sujata. 

 Besides the natural shades of gold, honey, tawny, beige and cream, Sujata has also come up with a range of interesting party shades, which are lively yet subtle. ?We are not going in for the predictable ferozi blue and fuchsia pink combinations. Instead, there is an abundance of reds, yellows, greens and blues to go with the party mood. Zari and heavy embroidery add the required glitz to ring in the New Year,? elaborated Sujata. 

 The designs range from geometric shapes to abstract forms along with traditional motifs.

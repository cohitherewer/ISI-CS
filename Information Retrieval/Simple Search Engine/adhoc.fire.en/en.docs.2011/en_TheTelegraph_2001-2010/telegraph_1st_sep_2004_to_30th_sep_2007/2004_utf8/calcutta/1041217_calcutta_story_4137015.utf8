 On the trot, thrills and a treat

 Clear skies, lush greenery, the magical beats of thundering hooves and a glorious afternoon of fine food, choicest beverages, fun and games and camaraderie in a relaxed carnival setting...

 This Saturday could see a slice of London?s Hyde Park or New York?s Central Park replicated in the heart of Calcutta, at the race course.

 A daylong food fiesta, presented by The Telegraph and Eveready, in association with the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) on Saturday (December 18), hopes to create a little excitement on Asia?s oldest race course, largely languishing from under-utilisation.

 Even if you can?t tell your tanallas from your quinellas, there?s enough reason to be at the course to celebrate a day out with Indian, Chinese, continental, Thai and other quick bites to choose from. 

 ?It?ll provide a unique opportunity for a chill-out with a difference for the adults and the young adults in a clean, unpolluted atmosphere,? asserts Gitanjali Alagh Jolly, who?s managing the event.

 From authentic Bengali cuisine by Kewpie?s to Chinese fare by Tangerine, Thai from Twinkle Fung Shway and Indian from Veda and Gupta Brothers, to sinful desserts by Just Desserts, there?s something to suit every palate. And revellers can then wash it down at the special bar counter put up by Pepsi, Fosters, Smirnoff and Chateau Indage.

 Rajesh Gupta, of Gupta Brothers, feels it?s a ?new adventure? to cater to the elite crowd at the race course. ?It?s a totally unexplored area and we will get the chance for a heart-to-heart with our clients,? says Gupta.

 Dilip Massey, of Twinkle Fung Shway, agrees that the race course presents a very special venue for a food carnival. ?The frenzied ambience of the races can only add to the fine gourmet experience,? he observes.

 The grace and powerful energy of the magnificent racehorses and the jockeys in their colourful silks, the animated bustle of the grandstand crowd ? will all contribute to the uniqueness of the setting, feels Col B.B.S. Bali, CoC of the race course. ?People can view racing from real close quarters and when you are just a few feet away from the action, you can even hear the horses breathe,? says Bali.

 The turf club aims to attract ?high-class gentry? through events like this to kick-start a revival of the course on a grander scale. The club attracts a core crowd in January and the effort to hold the food fiesta is to ?try and bring forward that excitement?, according to one of the organisers.

 ?A food carnival like this presents a perfect opportunity to socialise, network with friends and go back with memories of a day well spent,? says an RCTC official. 

 Catwalk models and Tollywood actors will also be present to pep up the festivities.

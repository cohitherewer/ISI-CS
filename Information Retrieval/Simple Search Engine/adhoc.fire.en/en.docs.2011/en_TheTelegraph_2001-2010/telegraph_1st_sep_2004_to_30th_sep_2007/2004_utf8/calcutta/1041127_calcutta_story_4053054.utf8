The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fresh faves with folk feel

ZEESHAN JAWED

Fabindia 

has come a long way since it dropped anchor in the city two years ago. This is 

evident from the fact that footfall has swelled 10 times during this period.

 Situated at 16 Hindustan Park, the Fabindia outlet is more than a mere shop for kurtas. To celebrate its second anniversary, it has launched Adhya, a premium range of garments.

 The collection uses various surface designs and techniques like machine quilting, machine stitching and Sujni work, part of Bihar?s folk tradition. The fabrics used here include hand-woven silks, rich in texture and crafted in accordance with trendy, cosmopolitan tastes.

 The three-day exhibition is on till Sunday, so grab your gear before stocks are sold out. The garments are affordably priced, starting from Rs 800.

 And here?s more for the Fabindia fan brigade ? the chain is all set to open its second store at City Centre, Salt Lake, in January 2005. ?It?s virgin territory and the people here have an eye for ethnic stuff,? explains store manager Pallabi Basu.

Weight watch

 India sure carries a lot of weight in the international arena ? it is one of the top 10 obese nations in the world. After all, 49 per cent of urban Indian adolescents are obese.

 Obesity causes a large number of health problems including diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. What better day to send the alarm bells ringing than on Friday, Anti-Obesity Day. At VLCC, no less.

 To spread awareness against the growing trend of junk food and crash diets, the Theatre Road branch of the health centre observed Anti-Obesity Day by demonstrating some low-calorie recipes.

 ?VLCC believes in shaping confidence. Once that is done, a weight-loss regimen follows automatically,? said Rupa Mitra of VLCC.

 ?Once you start thinking that you can shed the extra kilos, it becomes that much easier. What you require then is some good advice and a balanced diet. Keeping that in mind, we have organised this low-calorie cookery show for our patrons,? explained Mitra.

 Directing the demonstration was Sudhashil Dey, a professor with the Institute of Hotel Management. For all those who thought Kaati Kebab meant loads of spiced-up mutton and chicken, a vegetarian substitute can be tastefully created by replacing red meat with vegetables, revealed Dey and co.

 Food tips for Paneer Kheer, a variety of soups and a fruit yoghurt salad were also jotted down. With good grub up for grabs and precious tips to take home, it was a win-win situation for all present.

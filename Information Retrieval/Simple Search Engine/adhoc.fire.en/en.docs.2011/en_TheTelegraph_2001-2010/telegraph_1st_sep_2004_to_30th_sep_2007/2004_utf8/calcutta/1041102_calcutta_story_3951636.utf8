 Stories on canvas

 Realism in art is hard to come by in an age where it is dominated by obscure ideas and abstractions, to which the common viewer can barely relate. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by Puja Newar thus comes as a breath of fresh air, providing much needed relief to our aesthetic senses. Featuring works in media as varied as oil, pen and ink, charcoal and dry pastels, her art soothes by virtue of its choice and treatment of themes from the verdant, unspoilt countryside. Newar?s paintings, inspired by the simple, earthy lives of village folk, offer sensitive portrayals of nature, life, labour and survival, while her natural artistic instincts raise her subjects to a plane that can be best be described poetic, noble and sublime. Her artist?s vision, capturing her subjects unawares in their natural moods and expressions, reproduces them in powerful brush strokes that gain in beauty and vibrancy through a dexterous blend of soft, mellow lines and rich colour tones, applied in several overlapping layers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Chit Ch@t

It used to be described as the greatest record never 

made. But Brian Wilson?s SMiLE, released after 37 years, is now being heralded 

as the album of the year. Shelved as a Beach Boys project in 1967, SMiLE 

became a myth in the recording industry, fuelling speculation on whether the record 

would ever be completed and released. The Beach Boys were America?s answer to 

The Beatles and SMiLE was supposed to eclipse their 1967 masterpiece, Sgt 

Pepper?s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Instead, after the rest of the Beach Boys 

found Wilson?s brainchild too outlandish for an album, he sunk into a drug-induced 

depression. Wilson had a nervous breakdown and work stopped on SMiLE in 

1967, after 85 recording sessions. In the past few years, Wilson (picture left) 

started touring with a version of SMiLE, performing pieces of songs and 

fragments of music from the old project. SMiLE, the album, was finally 

released last month. It visits American culture through the decades and examines 

social concepts. Besides that, it is filled with hummable tunes and angelic harmonies. 

Look out for the album to hit the shelves in this part of the world soon. Also, 

listen to the Beach Boys 1964 classic, Pet Sounds. Visit www.brianwilson.com

Here?s a piece of news that?ll have your eyebrows 

disappearing into your hairline. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers 

announced recently that they had succeeded in using something very unique to prove 

their theory about a new power source for computers and other electronic devices. 

Any guesses? Well, it?s good ol? spinach! Apparently, they used spinach to prove 

that plant photosynthesis could one day be the method to convert sunlight into 

energy for electronic devices. The team comprised Marc A. Baldo, assistant professor 

of electronic engineering and computer science at MIT, Shuguang Zhang, associate 

director of the Centre for Biomedical Engineering and graduate Patrick Kiley. 

The researchers found that the plant can convert sunlight into a ?solid-state 

electronic spinach sandwich? that may in the not-too-distant future run the devices 

we use in daily life, like computers and cell phones. Popeye wasn?t far off the 

mark! Go to web.mit.edu for more.

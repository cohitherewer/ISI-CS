Opposites bend to mingle

Anamika angle

Personal touch and packaging are key to 

audience connect, finds Anamika Khanna

 Models sport outfits from Anamika?s collection 

at the India Fashion Week this year 

The change in the fashion scenario evokes no doubt 

that we are going through an evolution and a complete fashion revolution. The 

ramp obviously takes an all important position in dictating trends and the moods 

of any season and is going through an obvious and very interesting change as well. 

Just as fashion is completely emotion-charged at the 

moment, so is the need to present any collection on the ramp charged with feeling, 

evoked by anything sensitive and thought provoking. 

The desire to make collections more and more personal 

has become loud and clear, collections themselves becoming a reflection of the 

designer. Reminders of the past, personal interpretations and interest, immediate 

surroundings, all play an important role in bringing out, not the imaginary, but 

real men and women on the catwalk. 

The fashion show is now a real life scenario, a representation 

of who we are. The model is an interpreter of precise style, taking her place 

as a true protagonist of everyday life. The audience now has found a way to identify 

with her, no more is she an alien or a distant dream. 

No presentation is complete without an intense thought 

behind it, while things take a turn on minimalism, at the same time what the audience 

wants is intense thought provoking numbers. 

But the all-pervading question still remains on the 

ramp... Drama or no drama?

Give the crowd enough drama and dreams... the collection 

will definitely be termed unwearable. Present a straight show... Boring! It?s 

a fashion show, after all.

The trick lies in understanding the fine line of balance 

for that perfect ramp show... Dramatise the wearable, have a story to tell, with 

a punchline. 

Obviously you can?t please all, but the fewer people 

complaining, the better!

While the importance of making that fabulous, perfect 

collection is undoubtable, off the ramp, the importance of presentation and packaging 

the real product seems to be prominently missing from the Indian fashion scenario.

Most of us undermine the addition to the product which 

jumps in value just by virtue of beautiful presentation (don?t forget a story 

must be spun around it). None of us will deny that any product is enhanced the 

minute it is wrapped with appropriate style. 

This winter it set to send mixed messages. Opposites 

will not just attract but break rules and bend to mingle. Here are some interesting 

combinations to watch out for: 

 Comfort and opulence 

 Night and day 

 Retro and futuristic 

 Aristo-chic paired with street chic

 Flamboyant against plain 

 Boy and girl 

 Sporty and folk 

While luxury takes its position of supreme importance, 

it is mixed with that tattered hem for the not-bothered attitude. 

Inside out seams, raw edges, uneven hemlines, opulent, 

interesting broaches, exotic prints, lace, velvet, rich jewelled tones out of 

the trunk, a respect for what is old... vintage with Bohemian, luxury knits (suggestion: 

T-shirts over Indian kurtas, teamed with boots), return of the waistline, 

quirky at all times... (that one twist is essential) shimmer, stripes, white is 

the new black!

Skirts and dresses, layers, skirts and more, promises 

of a fabulous and luxurious winter!

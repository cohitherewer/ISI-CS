The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Prop truck traced

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The nightmare?s almost over for director Pradeep Sarkar and his Parineeta team. The mystery of the missing truck has been solved and some sanity has been restored at the harried production site. But the vehicle was yet to reach the film crew till late on Friday.

 The truck carrying antique props, worth around Rs 14 lakh, from Goregaon, Mumbai, was supposed to reach the city by Wednesday. But it went missing and could not be traced.

 The production team, in a tizzy without the artefacts for the period piece, decided to retrace the path from Calcutta to Mumbai and found the truck stationed in Jharkhand late on Thursday.

 ?Some of our unit members, headed by Rajesh Pandey, found the truck loading goods for two other clients en route to Calcutta,? said Tanushree Sarkar, who is handling the artwork for Parineeta. ?We had paid for the full truck from Mumbai,? she stressed.

 Tanushree spent the whole of Thursday scouring auction shops on Russell Street and touching base with antique shops in Alipore. ?Now, hopefully, all that won?t be required. Everyone even remotely connected with the project had been waiting for word about the truck as the entire schedule hinges on it,? she added.

 But there was still a word of caution. ?The truck won?t be allowed past the checkpost as it is carrying goods for three clients. We may have to unload our props and get them here separately,? said Panchali Sarkar, the director?s wife and executive producer for the film.

 When contacted late on Friday, director Pradeep Sarkar sounded quite tense about the truck and its whereabouts. ?It is carrying some lamp posts with the 60s? look that we need for the shoot early on Saturday. I don?t know what we will do without them... It has been a really torrid time for us,? added the adman-turned-director.

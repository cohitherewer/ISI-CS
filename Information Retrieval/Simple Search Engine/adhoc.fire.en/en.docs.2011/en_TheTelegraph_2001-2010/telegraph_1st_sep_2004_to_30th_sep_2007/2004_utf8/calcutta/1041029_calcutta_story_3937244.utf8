 One music launch in 12 cities at the same time. In a first of its kind, Bollywood logged on to the world of video-conference as the soundtrack of Madhur Bhandarkar?s much-awaited Page 3 was launched in Juhu on Thursday evening.

 Apart from viewing the live images, beamed on the big screen at the Reliance Web World on Camac Street, one could interact with the musicians and cast of the film (led, of course, by Calcutta-based Konkona Sen Sharma) to be released in December.

 Page 3 marks the entry of Konkona Sen Sharma in Bollywood. ?This was the first time I shot in Bombay (Mumbai). And to be honest, this film has been much bigger and a lot more professional from what I have done till date? This is also my first music launch,? admitted Konkona, who plays a reporter on the celebrity beat.

 The music, too, is a first in many ways. Composed by EMI India Ltd general manager Shamir Tandon, the Page 3 album features two tracks by David Bowie and Kylie Minogue. ?We had the rights to the two tracks and we added the bhangra beats to go with the mood,? said Tandon.

 The album also features both the sisters, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle. Interestingly, Asha?s song was completely conceived and recorded through a web interaction between the singer and the music maker. ?I haven?t done something like this before. If this becomes the trend, you won?t have to wait for months to get an artiste?s dates. For the particular song, I was asked by Shamir to sing with Helen in mind. I was instantly transported to the 70s to sing Huzoor-e-ala,? said Asha.

 Speaking about the film, Bhandarkar stressed the documentary style he has adopted. ?More than 50 per cent has been shot on steadycam to get the right feel of the glamorous nightlife of Mumbai. There are as many as 45 people in the cast and it was really difficult to shoot all of them.?

 Going by the trend set by Ram Gopal Varma in Bhoot, Page 3, too, will have music videos promoting the film and its soundtrack. Ace ad film-maker Sunil Pillai has shot a music video for the Asha track with Hrishita Bhatt and model Ricky.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Festival favourites

 When sceptics are busy slamming Tollywood?s infrastructure, the Bengal film industry is quietly scripting a success story where it matters most ? on the western shores. 

As many as four films made in the Tollygunge studios 

have gained entry to the 35th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) to be 

held between November 29 and December 9 at Goa. The 21 films shortlisted for the 

festival?s Indian Panorama feature Rituparno Ghosh?s Chokher Bali, Anjan 

Das? Iti Srikanta (picture above), Sekhar Das? Mehul Boner Sereng 

and Anjan Dutt?s Bow Barracks Forever. Among these, Dutt?s yet-to-be-released 

English film has been chosen for the Asian Competition Section, too.

 The Indian Panorama kicks off with Anup Kurian?s English feature Manasarovar, to be followed up by Vishal Bhardwaj?s Maqbool, Sudhir Mishra?s Chameli and M.F. Husain?s Meenaxi: Tale of 3 Cities, among others.

 The Bengal package is at its eclectic best, with some interesting cast and content variety. While both Chokher Bali and Iti Srikanta are period pieces (based on novels by Rabindranath Tagore and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay), Mehul Boner Sereng focuses on the rural-urban dichotomy and Bow Barracks Forever captures the human drama of a cosmopolitan settlement.

 Again, it?s Chokher Bali shining the brightest with imported glamour (Aishwarya Rai), Iti Srikanta attracting attention with Soha Ali Khan, Bow Barracks Forever. pulling off an ensemble cast (Lillete Dubey, daughter Neha, Victor Banerjee and Moon Moon Sen) and Mehul Boner Sereng banking on local power with Rupa Ganguly, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Chandrayee Ghosh and Pijush Ganguly.

 But more than anything else, the festival could mean some serious business for the Tollywood brigade with a string of foreign delegates trooping into the beach town to catch up with the Indian fare.

 ?As a number of film distributors, critics and festival directors come to attend the IFFI, our films will get a lot of exposure. A few films may also get selected for other festivals,? hopes director Anjan Das.

 ?This time there will probably be a marketing cell at IFFI, which will help us show our films to foreign buyers. We made Bow Barracks Forever for the national and international markets and nothing much happens by sitting in Calcutta or over the Internet,? echoes Anjan Dutt, busy shopping for stars for his next project.

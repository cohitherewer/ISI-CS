Sixty of Calcutta?s most famous Pujas have been identified as ?high-risk? and will be closely monitored by the fire services department this year.

 The crowd-pullers on the watch-list include Md Ali Park, Lebutala Park, Ekdalia Evergreen (patronised by mayor Subrata Mukherjee), Kumartuli Sarbojanin, Babubagan, Sreebhumi Sporting, Telenga Bagan, Kasba Bosepukur and College Square.

 ?These pandals have been shortlisted since they are usually theme-based Pujas and draw thousands of people round the clock. Representatives from 40 such high-risk pujas have been summoned on September 28, where we will ask them to take extra precautions on the pandal premises,? fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said. 

 Admitting that puja pandals in Calcutta are set up at the most inappropriate places, including in the middle of narrow lanes and between two buildings, Chatterjee said his department was lenient with organisers since Durga puja was an emotional matter in Bengal. 

 ?Moreover, most of these Pujas are being organised at the same place for the past 40 to 50 years,? he reasoned. 

 The department has issued a set of guidelines for the organisers on constructing the pandal and arrangements on the festive days. ?We have provisions for filing criminal cases against offenders. They can even be jailed. Thankfully, no major fire has broken out in pandals in the past two years,? the minister said. 

 ?We will have fire tenders near pandals like Lebutala Park, Ekdalia Evergreen, Babubagan and some others. Posters prescribing the dos and don?ts on the pandal premises will be put up in the vicinity. We will also make announcements over microphones at stalls near the pandals,? minister Chatterjee said.

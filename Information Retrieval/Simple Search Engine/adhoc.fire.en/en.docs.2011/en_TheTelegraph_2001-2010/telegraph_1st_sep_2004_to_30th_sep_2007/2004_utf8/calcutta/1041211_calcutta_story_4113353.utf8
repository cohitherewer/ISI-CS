 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Friday overruled objections from political parties and the heritage lobby to allow the BJP to hold its workers? meeting in Town Hall. 

 He went on to announce that he would throw open the first floor of the Hall for political parties to hold conventions there.

 Already in the eye of a storm of protest for giving out the space to the BJP, apparently free ? a point which the civic body would neither confirm nor deny, though the BJP claimed it came gratis ? Mukherjee refrained from saying whether the floor will be made available for a fee. He announced that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will spend Rs 80 lakh to introduce a sound monitor system on the first floor of the Hall and instal an air-conditioning system to enable political parties and others to hold public meetings there.

 Town Hall, which is one of the important heritage buildings in Calcutta, has opened a museum on its ground floor. The first floor is lying unused, as its acoustics are far from perfect. 

 ?We will air-condition the first floor and instal a sound-proof system so conventions can be held in the hall without any fuss,? Mukherjee said after addressing a meeting of the BJP party workers, which was attended by BJP president and former deputy prime minister L.K. Advani.

 ?You probably can?t hear me clearly, as there is no system in the hall to monitor the sound. The loudspeakers are echoing what I am saying owing to the absence of a sound monitor system. I shall improve the acoustics by installing a sound monitor system and make the hall air-conditioned,? the mayor promised.

 Mukherjee brushed aside objections for allowing the BJP to hold its party workers? meeting there. ?You all know Town Hall is a prestigious and heritage building. Any political party or organisation is free to hold meetings on the first floor,? he stressed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Look great, feel good, stay fit

 - tailor-made regimens that are easy on pocket

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Firm abs, strong biceps, great quads and calves, taut glutes and hamstrings?

 Training with the latest cardio/strength equipment, loosening up with a relaxing massage, freshening up with alternative therapies or unlocking the spiritual energies through yoga and meditation.

 Looking great and feeling good had never been more important, be it at work or while partying. 

 Even as Calcutta?s GenX is queuing up for that spindle contour, those greying at the temples are equally keen to keep pace and stay fit. Soon they can do it without burning a deep hole in the pocket.

A new chain of health clubs promises to reach out 

to the fitness-conscious with the latest exercise solutions and smash the price 

barrier in the process. Bodyline Sports, ?pioneers of fashionable fitness lifestyle 

in Calcutta?, is bringing to town its cluster of health spas, with a price tag 

designed to ?cater to the mid-range?, as opposed to the high-end line.

 The first Bodyline Health Spa, a state-of-the-art gym, spa and aerobics studio with top-of-the-line fitness equipment, will be thrown open on the Punjab Club campus this Sunday. 

 ?This is our first step towards promoting fit, healthy and glamorous bodies, and making quality exercising options affordable,? says Gagan Sachdev, managing partner of Bodyline Sports.

 From strength training to cardio workout, aerobics to yoga, slimming amp; beauty treatment, nutritional diet tips, personal guidance and tailor-made regimens will be offered to Punjab Club members at a ?pocket-friendly? monthly rate of Rs 650, while for walk-in individuals, the fees will be Rs 900 a month.

 ?We are looking at six such health spas across the city over the next three years, and the fees will remain affordable, even in standalone properties, since we want to reach out to as many people as possible,? says Sachdev. 

 For quarterly, half-yearly and annual members, there will be further concessions, the management promises.

 The Bodyline house is a leading importer and distributor of sports and fitness equipment in the country, and deals extensively in Kaesun products from Korea. Besides motorised treadmills, the health spas will have cross-trainers, exer-bikes, aqua rowers, multigyms, strength machines, weight training, steam and sauna.

 ?Not just the best equipment, we will have extremely qualified trainers. However, our health spas will not be a mere collection of cold machines. We believe in energising and motivating people through the best of instructors, scientific training programmes and an electrifying atmosphere, so that the results come quicker,? Sachdev declares.

 Bodyline Sports, the ?exclusive? health equipment store on Ballygunge Circular Road, has achieved a 300 per cent growth since it opened its doors in May this year. 

 The company has recently done a clutch of health clubs for corporates, like Philips and Martin Burn, and schools like Modern High.

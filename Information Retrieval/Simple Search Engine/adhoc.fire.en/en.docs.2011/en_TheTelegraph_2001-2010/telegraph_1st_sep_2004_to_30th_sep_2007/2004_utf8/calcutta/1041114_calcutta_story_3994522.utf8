 Guide to animal planet

 Chandana

 Safari nowadays means a trip to 

 see and photograph animals in the wild. Most trips are organised 

 by safari companies/guides who provide all necessary supplies, 

 including transportation and accommodation.

 One of the highlights of safaris 

 is going on game drives and bush walks, where you get to 

 see wildlife in natural habitat. But it is very important 

 to respect the natural surroundings.

 Planning: Learn about your 

 destination before you get there.

 Guides: Explore game reserves 

 with the help of professional guides or a game ranger.

 Attire: Casual light cottons, 

 khaki or neutral shades. If you will be outdoors during 

 sunset and sunrise, it is best to wear long-sleeved clothes 

 as it helps prevent mosquito bites. Comfortable walking 

 shoes.

 Caution: Maintain a distance 

 from wildlife and respect your guide?s judgment about your 

 proximity to certain animals. Don?t nag him to take the 

 vehicle closer for a better photograph. A vehicle driven 

 too close can hinder a hunt, or cause animals to abandon 

 a hard-earned meal.

 The three virtues: You 

 have to be patient, silent and vigilant. Sometimes, the 

 wait is painfully long but worth it. Never attempt to attract 

 an animal?s attention by imitating animal sounds, clapping 

 or throwing objects.

 Green tips: Don?t remove 

 any natural material from wildlife reserves. This disrupts 

 the ecology of the area. Pack your trash. Litter tossed 

 on the ground can choke or poison animals and birds.

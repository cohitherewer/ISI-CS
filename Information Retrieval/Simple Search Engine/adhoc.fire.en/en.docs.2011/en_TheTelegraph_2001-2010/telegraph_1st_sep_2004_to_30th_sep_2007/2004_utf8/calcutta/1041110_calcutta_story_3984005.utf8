 Presents to please

 Whether you want to give a simple box of sweets or fancy presents that survive the Diwali binge, gifts are a must for this festival. Here are a few last-minute shopping suggestions to set you apart:

Candle count

 Smokeless candles and diyas rule the roost at Emami Landmark. Smokeless scented gel candles in various hues and sizes are a big draw, priced between Rs 35 and Rs 105. Gel and wax candles come in a range of scents. Pick up larger wax wicks, Rs 180 onwards.

 To celebrate traditionally, take home innovative diyas between Rs 5 and Rs 500.

Gorsia Designs at 10 Judges? Court Road and City Centre 

is not the first place you might look for festive goodies, but it has a delightful 

selection of candles large and small (picture above by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya).

 The furniture shop has a selection of aromatic and floating candles. The scented candles come in air-packed conical, circular and cubicle shapes, with strong aromas of vanilla, green apple and jasmine.

 The floating candles come in delicate designs of flowers, fruits and even deities. The imported options set you back by anything between Rs 350 and Rs 1,800.

 A special festive discount of up to 40 per cent is on here. The shop has a range of candles and diyas as well as artificial flowers, which cost anything between Rs 40 and Rs 400, in attractive hues.

Devotional touch

 With devotion in the Diwali air, the market is flooded with statues of deities. 

 Palm-sized idols to elaborate three-feet statues have hit the market. A Ganesha fountain or a Lakshmi lamp-stand add an element of utility as well.

 Colourful wooden wall hangings with om and swastika motifs are in abundant supply at addresses like Archies. 

 Gold is the colour of the season, with racks devoted to Ganesha in this bright hue. Metal images priced Rs 100 onwards are perfect for the conservative shopper, while the more daring can go for funky glow-in-the-dark idols.

 Statues range from Rs 150 to Rs 500, wall hangings from Rs 200 and Rs 1,200. 

 The glowing options start as low as Rs 8 and climb their way up.

Treasure trove tonic for falling finances 

Pinky Kapoor

Name of author

 In case of depleting finances, Feng Shui advises 

you to bring a handful of soil from a wealthy friend or relatives garden 

and mix it with the soil of your garden. Burying a treasure box filled with coins 

and gems in this wealth area enhances the effect

Q: We were financially sound before we moved 

into our present residence. Since then, our finances have been on the slide and 

now we have reached a point nearing bankruptcy. One of my husband?s friends pointed 

out that our back garden, which is at a lower level than the rest of the house, 

might be the cause of our problems. Can this be the reason for our poor financial 

condition? If so, please suggest remedies. 

Name withheld

The Solution: Any form of land depression within the 

plot behind the house is bad Feng Shui and a sure sign of declining finances. 

This is because the low land at the back does not provide any support to the house. 

The best way out is to fill the land with soil and bring it to a regular level. 

If this is not possible, erect a tall wall or plant tall trees behind the house 

to give it the much-needed support. Another option would be to relocate the main 

entrance of the house at the back so the depressed area becomes the front and 

the high area serves as a solid support from behind. Alternatively, you can bring 

a handful of soil from a wealthy friend or a relative?s garden and mix it with 

the south-eastern soil of your own garden. Make sure this is done on an auspicious 

day just after sunrise and that you bury a treasure box filled with gems and coins 

in this important wealth area. A lemon or any fruit tree planted at this point 

will automatically bring fruitfulness and prosperity to the household.

Q: Our neighbours have installed a metallic 

chimney duct in their kitchen at such an angle that it hits my bedroom wall. According 

to Feng Shui, this acts like a poison arrow and should be removed. However, my 

neighbour refuses to remove it even after repeated requests. Please suggest a 

way to cope with this problem.

The Solution: If there is any metallic object pointing 

towards your house, you can paint the wall facing it red as a counter measure. 

Red, according to Feng Shui, symbolises fire that conquers metal and thus subdues 

the harmful effects of any metallic object. If you do not wish to paint the wall 

red, install a red bulb outside that faces the metallic chimney duct directly.

Q: I have retired after many years in defence. 

Now I plan to start a new garment store for which I have found a place in a prime 

location. The problem is that the sewer pipes of the area run above the main entrance 

of the plot, which I was not aware of earlier. I know this not in accordance with 

Feng Shui principles, but at this stage I cannot give up this project. What should 

I do?

Rajiv Surana

The Solution: Sewer pipes should never be allowed 

to flow above or beneath the main entrance of a property, whether it is a commercial 

or a residential one. Their existence can lead to financial and legal problems. 

The only way out is to fit powerful lights from the ceiling focusing upwards towards 

the sewer pipes. This will help throw back the negative energy created by the 

overhead sewer pipes at the entrance. 

Q: My date of birth is September 18, 1986. 

We are moving into a new house where I have chosen the north-east room for my 

self. According to my date of birth, I am an east-group person and my auspicious 

directions are south-east, east, south and north. Now I am wondering whether the 

north-east room will be lucky for me or not. This year is crucial as I will appear 

for my board examinations in March 2005. My mother plans to install the temple 

in my room at the north-east corner. She wants to know whether there is any harm 

in having an attached bathroom with a door to the bedroom. Please advise.

Rashi Arora

The Solution: North-east is associated with education, 

hence it is supposed to be the best room for teenagers who are preparing for higher 

examinations. Do not get confused with the auspicious directions. You should be 

tapping energy from them by facing that particular direction while studying. Don?t 

worry about the location of your room. I would not recommend having the access 

to the toilet from the bedroom if the temple is going to be installed there. If 

space permits, the toilet door can be relocated outside the bedroom. As an alternative, 

a barrier in the form of a reasonably tall screen can be placed in between the 

temple and the bathroom door.

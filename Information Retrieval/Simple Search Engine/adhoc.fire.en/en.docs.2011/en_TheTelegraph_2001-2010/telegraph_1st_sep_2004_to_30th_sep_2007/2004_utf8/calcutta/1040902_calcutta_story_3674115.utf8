Momo mania

Light Bite

Strange how the momo has almost become mainstream. 

There was a time when only few choice outlets were steaming up the scrumptious 

Tibetan dumplings. Now, they look to be competing with the chowmein-chilli chicken 

combo at every neighbourhood wok.

The momo mania all started off Elgin Road. There were 

three tiny eateries Hamro Momo, Momo Plaza on Suburban Hospital Road and Tibetan 

Delight tucked away in a tiny lane at shouting distance from each other. 

It kicked off with a Tibetan couple on Suburban Hospital 

Road. When they closed down, my mother, Mithu, asked them if she could take over, 

explains Dinesh Singh, who runs Hamro which means our in Nepalese. Chicken 

and pork steamed momos and thukpa were all that was on offer when they started 

out 17 years ago under a tree. Now the fare is far more varied at the tiny eatery. 

An assortment of sauces and dishwater soup still accompanies every order.

Then, 1995 saw a fourth player Orchid gunning 

for a slightly (and we really mean ever-so-slightly) more affluent clientele. 

They started stirring up their own special pan-fried recipe, which involved coating 

steamed momos in a spicy sauce. Now, this has sparked a mini revolution.

But the lightly seasoned minced meat steamed in a 

thin wheat-flour wrapper makes for a light and if you avoid the fried variation 

 healthy meal. Its as light on the pocket as it is on the tummy, coming at between 

Rs 15 and Rs 45 a plate, depending on where you are and what variety you choose.

Lets not get into the authenticity argument. Apparently, 

in Tibet, momos also known as Momocha in Nepal are often made with yak meat. 

Fried momos in general are also a departure. So, instead of wondering whether 

you are biting into the real thing, go for whatever suits your rumbling stomach.

 Hamro Momo

The oldest and some say the best for the authentic 

steamed version. Also stirs up a range of Chinese choices. 

 Tibetan Delight

Tucked away in a little lane off Chowringhee, this 

is the second player to hit the momo market, and is also a hot favourite. 

 Orchid

Introduced innovation into the momo race. Appeals 

to the more posh crowd, too, with more seating space.

 Momo Plaza

The other roomy budget option on Momo Street

 The Propah Picks

From Mainland China to Taajas, lots of restaurants 

have tried their hand at momos. But it is not quite the same thing for one brought 

up on the tiny confines of the original momo houses.

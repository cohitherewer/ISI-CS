The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 What We are Watching

Tube talk - Health shows

 Shweta Kwatra: 

Healthy host 

The Calcuttan may be obsessed with popping the right 

pill for the slightest ill, but when it comes to the small screen, he would rather 

be entertained than be prescribed cure. Though there?s a lot of variety in the 

health and fitness-related programmes that are watched in the city, the ratings 

received are quite low compared to soaps, movies, sports and kids? programmes.

 Here are the top five health and fitness shows, according to Television Audience Measurement (TAM) India viewership data for the week November 7-November 13. 

 Zee TV?s Good Health Show, hosted by Shweta Kwatra, with ratings of 0.83 is at number one.

 At number two is NDTV India?s Doctor NDTV with 0.26.

 Close on its heels is DD7?s Hello Doctor Babu (the only Bengali programme on the list) with 0.22 ratings.

 Sitting on the fourth spot is Sab Se Fit from Aaj Tak with 0.12.

 Rounding off the top five is DD1?s Take Care, with 0.1 ratings.

 Two news channels, two national channels and one family channel make a good programming mix, yet none of the programmes manages a score above 1.

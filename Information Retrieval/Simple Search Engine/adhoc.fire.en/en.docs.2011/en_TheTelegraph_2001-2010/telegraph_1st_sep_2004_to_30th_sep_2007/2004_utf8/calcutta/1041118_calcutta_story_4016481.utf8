 Circle of confidence and communication

 It?s Wednesday morning. The classrooms are empty. Outside, students are seated on the lawn in a circle along with the teacher, busy in conversation. Some groups are seated in a similar fashion in a corner of a corridor. In the few classrooms which are occupied, a similar seating arrangement has been made on the floor.

 This is circle time at The Heritage School, the day-boarding institute off the EM Bypass that is the newest entrant to Calcutta?s blue-ribbon learning station league. And circle hour is the latest move introduced at the smart school that keeps up with teaching experiments across the globe.

 ?This is the outcome of a workshop in Delhi that we attended in August. It was conducted by psychologist and teacher Jenny Mosely, who is popularising the circle of confidence method in UK schools. The effect on the children has been amazing in these couple of months,? says headmistress Meenakshi Atal.

 In the period designated as circle time, children get to speak up on any issue. ?Sometimes we play a game to break the ice as children feel shy in the beginning,? says Shukla Chattopadhyay, a class teacher, who conducts circle time with her children. In the junior levels, clapping games are often played. ?This charges them up and helps the hand-brain coordination,? she explains.

 But it is getting children to talk that makes the method so useful. ?There are so many issues that children want to discuss but feel shy to bring up within the structured environment of the classroom or at home. In this informal set-up, they have the liberty to speak or listen,? Atal says.

 Children use circle time as a platform to voice their concerns. ?Last week, a kid complained that he couldn?t finish classwork in time. The others came up with so many solutions ? keeping an alarm clock, telling himself that he?d have to miss playtime to finish the work...? 

 ?This way,? Atal explains, ?they learn to communicate, think of solutions, listen patiently as well as accept new ideas. It also builds their self-esteem. These are all major life skills.?

 Headmistress of the senior school Ranu Dattagupta says the system helps solve discipline issues as well. ?A child?s social studies notebook was once stolen in class. Some students suggested that we give everyone a zero in the subject. Once that was announced, the notebook was found in half-an-hour.? Emotional issues are also tackled as are problems of adolescence. 

 ?It is so effective that we, teachers, too have our circle time,? Atal smiles.

 The school has a pastoral teacher who lends a listening ear in private as well as a professional counsellor. ?Bringing up children in today?s environment is tough work. Parents need guidance and a forum to share their worries,? says school counsellor Salony Priya. She meets the parents in groups and again with their children, at least once every year in both cases. The frequency increases in the higher classes. ?Children today are eager to know. If we do not speak to them, they are likely to gather distorted information,? she points out.

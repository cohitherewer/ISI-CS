Warm up in wool style 

Peppy pullovers, cool cardigans and jazzy 

jackets men are spoilt with haute choices this winter. Zeeshan Jawed 

checks out the fare on offer in city stores

You don?t have to wear a suit to look sharp this winter. 

Smart jackets, peppy cardigans, fun pullovers and lots and lots of layers can 

create as chic an effect for men. But while it is easy to look good, in winter 

wear, the rules of the dressing game are also quite different.

If denim jackets topped the shopping list last winter, 

sweaters in vibrant colours and interesting patterns are a favourite this December. 

This is clear from brands specialising in other apparels joining the cardigan 

cart.

Like denim major Wrangler. ?We have introduced a lot 

more variety to our range this winter. The new winter wear collection has trendy 

jackets and sweaters that keep you warm. Taking forward our vintage theme, the 

range has been divided into three categories ? Vintage Biker, Vintage Sport and 

Vintage Utilitarian,? says B. Hymn, business head, Wrangler.

A little basic trend-spotting can help men keep warm 

in style.

Winter classics

If you feel the basic pullover is monotonous and prosaic, 

it?s time to try one on again. The round neck variety that granddad used to wear 

has much trendier threads keeping it company on the shelves.

?The sweater as an accessory has reinvented itself. 

Cool colours and interesting knits have redefined woollen wear,? says Ambit Cheri, 

manager of Cotton World Corp. in Forum.

The national chain has introduced a new line defined 

by bright colours and a variety of designs. Pullovers in vibrant solid colours 

in round or V-necks are the best bets for formal meets.

For a funkier look, the Vintage Biker sweaters that 

have been either pigment-dyed or enzyme-washed to give a greased look would be 

a good buy. The colours in vogue this season are olive, orange, grey, green, various 

hues of blue and black. These varieties are available in Cotton World and Freelook 

at Forum and United Colours of Benetton at Forum and City Centre.

For a snug fit, V-necks with and without collars, 

V-necks with zippers and buttons and the turtlenecks are the favourites this season. 

Sporty types

Spot the sporty look all around you. And that doesn?t 

necessarily mean Wimbledon whites. 

The sporty sweaters come in bright and vibrant shades 

with interesting chest prints. Some pullovers have lively contrasting-coloured 

sleeves and fronts. Such sweaters are made of a mixture of acro wool and lamb 

wool, available in outlets of Planet Sports (Forum) and Adidas across the city.

The trendy pullovers are also available by Wrangler 

at multi-brand outlets. The price ranges between Rs 750 and Rs 1,999. Levis has 

a body hugging variety in full sleeves with V-necks. This variety comes in black 

and grey and is priced at Rs 1,149 onwards.

If fleece is your thing, any sporty brand will stock 

the stuff. As does Westside, where that aside, you can find full-sleeved marine 

rib sweaters, carlton jackets, caps, ribbed jackets and more, starting Rs 699 

onwards.

Cotton knits

If you belong to the school of thought that believes 

that heavy woollens are redundant in our balmy city, don?t overload your closet 

with heavy sweaters and jackets. Instead, go for the 100 per cent cotton knits.

?This year woollen sweaters are not in vogue. People 

are going in for the cotton variety, which has been phenomenally popular,? says 

Alok Saraf, owner of the Forum outlet of Spykar. For a more formal occasion, one 

can choose from solid V-necks and button-downs with designer buttons.

However, if your style is casual, try on a sweater 

with three-quarter sleeves. These come front open, with and without zippers. The 

pullovers are priced at Rs 745 onwards. The cotton knits are available at Spykar 

and United Colors of Benetton.

Couture for a cause

STRIKE A POSE

Close on the heels of the Think Pink show, 

Satya Paul officials talk about how to put together a fund-raising fashion fiesta

 You have a concept and you have a cause. Add a charitable intention and you 

have a gala fund-raiser, right? Wrong. It takes more than just a noble idea to 

get people to part with their money. High fashion is by far the best way to lure 

in a great crowd. But given that it takes over Rs 3 lakh to put together a sizeable 

show in the first place, it is a good idea to do thorough groundwork before you 

decide to embark on the ramp rage. 

Start off by drawing up a proper proposal to approach sponsors. Donations for 

charity are liable for tax exemptions under section 80G, so once you ensure them 

proper publicity, it?s fairly easy to rake in the moolah. The key here is to identify 

appropriate sponsors in keeping with the theme. Fashion houses and designer brands 

are the best bet to approach first, consumer durable and FMCG companies come in 

a close second and third. 

Next, identify the proper venue. A charity event, especially if it is of the fashion 

show variety, needn?t necessarily be held in a run-down auditorium. Glitz, glamour 

and due publicity go hand in hand, so five-star venues are ideal. Given the nature 

of the do, a star hotel worth its pomp would usually be all too willing to sponsor 

it and indulge in a little goodwill gesture of their own. 

 Draw up an extensive guest list that includes the 

who?s who in town. While you can?t afford to miss out on the glam quotient, it?s 

a good idea to include some substance in the form of literary names as well, given 

the nature of the event. And don?t forget the top industrialists of the city, 

as directly or indirectly, they are the source of most sustenance. 

 Getting models and a compere at subsidised rates, 

creating quirky invites, devising a proper script and music could be quite a headache 

for you, but less so for a competent event manager with the right contacts. You 

may consider contacting one to ensure a smooth flow.

 Last but not least, roping in a designer, preferably 

a national name willing to churn out a new collection in tune with the mood of 

the evening, can make all the difference between a show being the talk of the 

town and one that doesn?t even get a breakfast mention.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bad knee plagues more women 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Lack of awareness and the fear of undergoing surgery holds back Calcuttans from getting treated for orthopaedic problems, experts observed during a symposium and live workshop on knee replacement surgery on Sunday at Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Centre.

 Another disturbing fact that the seminar threw up is that almost 70 per cent of the patients, from the city and suburbs, who complain of a damaged knee are women. 

 ?We have observed over the past few years that women start developing knee problems in their fifties. But they prefer to endure the pain till things go out of hand and then they approach a doctor,? lamented P.K. Banerjee, head of department (orthopaedics) at Peerless hospital.

 City orthopaedic surgeons say that most patients don?t trust the medical facilities available in Bengal and prefer to go to other states for treatment, only to return very dejected. 

 ?The treatment available in Calcutta in the field of orthopaedics is really very good,? asserted Banerjee. 

 Patients also tend to visit doctors only at an advanced stage of the ailment. ?In advanced countries like the USA, we get patients very early, but in Calcutta, most patients report to doctors very late in their life. That also makes it difficult for orthopaedic surgeons to treat the patient,? said Dilip Pal, specialist in fixed bearing knee orthoplasty. 

 Officials at Peerless hospital said many more similar interactive programmes, including a series of continuous medical education (CME) for doctors and patient awareness programmes, are on the cards. 

 The daylong programme on Sunday was aimed at creating awareness and sharing information on complications and methods used in fixed-bearing knee replacements.

 In the past 10 years, over 2,500 knee replacement surgeries have been conducted at the hospital.

 Cop alert to tackle tease terror

 OUR BUREAU

 A day after reiterating how ?safe? the city was ?in comparison to other places?, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee urged police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty on Tuesday to take punitive and preventive steps to curb crime against women.

 ?I have asked police to look into the cases and also initiate precautionary measures,? Bhattacharjee said at Writers? Buildings after reviewing police response to recent cases of harassment. Chief secretary Ashok Gupta, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and other senior officials sat in, as well.

 ?Not only today, I have been telling them (police) so since the first incident,? Bhattacharjee added, referring to the molestation of a Polish woman off Dover Terrace on Navami night.

 Home secretary Deb said the government?s concern had been conveyed to the police commissioner. ?He is taking the desired measures,? Deb added.

 Five days after the Polish national working with an NGO was molested by four men, hardly any headway has been made in the case. ?She did give us a brief outline of the attackers, and the hunt is on,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (I), detective department. ?She had told us she would leave for Rajasthan on work,? he added.

 Following directives from the home (police) department, the security ring in and around the city has been strengthened to ensure safety of women.

 ?Although Calcutta is a much safer city compared to any other city in the world, we are not leaving anything to chance and have already strengthened vigil on every street. Anyone spotted tailing a woman will be picked up for questioning. So, those out to harass women, beware,? declared deputy commissioner (central) Rajeev Kumar.

 More plainclothes policemen are being deployed in sensitive areas. ?We have been asked to be very strict with those trying to harass women. Special police teams are there to ensure safety of women at night,? said B.C. Mondol, additional superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas). Patrolling of the lanes and bylanes has also been intensified, claimed an official of North 24-Parganas district police.

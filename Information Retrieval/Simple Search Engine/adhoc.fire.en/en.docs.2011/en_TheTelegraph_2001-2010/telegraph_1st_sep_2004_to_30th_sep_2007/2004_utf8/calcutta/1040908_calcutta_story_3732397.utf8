The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Short and significant 

 The second Kalpanirjhar International Short Fiction Film Festival, organised by Kalpanirjhar Foundation and Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan, Calcutta, will be held at the MMB auditorium and Gorky Sadan from September 10 to 15.

 Kalpanirjhar was a little magazine that focused on new Indian cinema as it was evolving in the years between 1979 and 1985. The Kalpanirjhar crew and some of those who cherished and supported the venture came together to form the Kalpanirjhar Foundation (in Calcutta in 2001), devoted to initiating, continuing and maintaining dialogue between the makers and the consumers/viewers/listeners, sustaining an interactive field of creativity for a cause.

 As part of this project, the Foundation had organised the first edition of the shorts festival last year in association with MMB. An important package featured student films focusing on dialogue exercises from the second-year students of FTII, Pune. This years festival also has a special section featuring the works of these makers in the making.

Robin Mallick, director of Filmfest Dresden, has curated 

the festival this year again, with a selection of German contemporary shorts 2003-04. 

The fare includes True 2004 (picture above), directed by Tom Twyker, best 

known for his Run Lola Run, and Heonen, the opening film of the 

Berlin International Film Festival, 2002.

 A special selection of Mexican shorts loaned by Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia will be screened. The festival will also feature films from INPUT (International Public Television). 

 The inaugural film The Dark Side of the Moon, directed by William Karel, has been chosen from the INPUT package. The opening session will feature another INPUT film, The Jogger, conceived and directed by Tariq Ali.

A package of animation classics and short film classics 

will be another highlight. Among the short films MMB is trying to procure from 

the National Film of India, Pune, are Istvan Szabos You, Roman 

Polanskis (picture right) The Fat and the Lean, Ishu Patels Paradise 

and Zanussis The Death of a Provincial.

 The festival will be inaugurated by Aparna Sen, with Mrinal Sen as guest of honour. The daily screenings (5.30 to 8.30 pm) will be held at the MMB auditorium on September 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15, and at Gorky Sadan on September 14.

 Library gherao over campus Puja

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Several employees of the National Library, along with their families, gheraoed director Subhendu Mandal on Thursday, following his refusal to grant permission for a Durga puja on the campus.

 The families of the employees, who live in quarters on the Library premises, urged Mandal to withdraw the letter to the secretary of the National Library Staff Quarters Puja Committee and allow them to organise a Puja like last year. 

 The committee had sought Mandal?s permission in writing on Tuesday. 

 But the Library?s administrative officer, A.K. Halder, wrote back to committee secretary Ajoy Das, informing him that the authorities would not allow a puja on the campus this year. 

 ?I am directed to inform you that your prayer for permission to conduct the Durga puja this year on the premises of the National Library cannot be acceded to,? Halder wrote.

 The Library authorities have also conveyed their decision to Alipore police station. 

 The security officer of the Library has been asked to keep a close watch on the activities of the Puja committee members. 

 Peeved at the virtual ban on the Puja, the members on Thursday stormed the director?s chamber, demanding that they be allowed to go ahead with their schedule. 

 Admitting that he had turned down the committee?s request, director Mandal said: ?It?s impossible for me to allow Durga puja on the Library campus. The Library remains open even on Puja days. Allowing a puja on the campus means disturbing our readers. How can I do that??

 Last year, then officer-on-special duty Ramanuj Bhattacharjee had allowed the employees to organise a puja on the campus. So, many of the employees had taken it for granted that they would be allowed this time, too. 

 ?But I simply can?t allow the four-day festivity. If a puja is allowed on the campus and a section of employees choose to be engaged with it, and stay away from duty, I won?t be able to pull up anyone,? Mandal reasoned. 

 A member of the Puja committee, however, claimed that a puja would, indeed, be organised on the campus, but in a small way. 

 ?Our family members enjoy it and our children don?t want to venture out of the campus,? he said. 

 Asked about the claim, Mandal said: ?I won?t allow any puja officially. If employees choose to ignore the order, it will be their decision. I shall not be held responsible if anything goes wrong during the festivity.?

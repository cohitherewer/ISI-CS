The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ray of reality for new-look Lisa 

A global soul. A typical Bengali. A choosy actor. 

All these are different avatars of the same person. Meet the new Lisa Ray (picture 

by Pabitra Das) who was in town on Monday to launch a new range of Rado watches.

 The short hairstyle is not the only new thing about the gorgeous Bombay Dyeing and Lakme model of the 90s. ?This cut is, of course, for Deepa Mehta?s Water. We were shooting the film with the working title of River Moon but it will be released as Water. The film is set in the 1930s and deals with an ashram of widows. John Abraham is with me in it apart from a host of other talented actors. That?s all I am allowed to say about the film right now.?

 Lisa doesn?t mind talking about her director, though. ?Deepa is lovely to work with. She has her own style of working and I thoroughly enjoy the process. We have worked together before in Bollywood/Hollywood and although Water is different in theme, the pleasure remains the same. She is one of the main reasons I did the film.?

 The model-turned-actress, who made her big screen debut as a lawyer in Vikram Bhatt?s Kasoor, doesn?t want to do Bollywood films anymore.

 ?It is a conscious decision I have taken. I am looking into other films from other parts of the world. I can even do a Bengali film if I get a good offer. I am now settled in London and the city has this stimulating environment from where I can dabble in many things at the same time.?

 And that?s exactly what Lisa is doing. ?I am training in theatre. While I am not working on one particular project, I wouldn?t mind doing something. I also love dancing. So you may just find me dancing in Santiniketan one morning. It?s a kind of a breather that I?m taking and I am loving it.?

 In the city after quite a while, Lisa was happy to come back to Calcutta. ?Mumbai may have been the city where my career shaped up, but Calcutta gave me my first experience of India. It?s lovely to return to this place every now and then. We still have our house here in Shyambazar.?

 Lisa has also just completed another foreign film titled Seeking Fear but it?s not the country but the content she is looking at. ?I hate these labels like crossover films and commercial movies. Finally, every project is about the content material. That has to be nice.?

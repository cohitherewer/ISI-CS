 A creative flair for colours set the Mahasaptami mood at most of the 60 housing complexes enlisted with The Telegraph Hand in Hand puja programme, promoting community camaraderie across the city. 

 In the south, Sikharbindu Co-operative Housing kicked off with a sit-and-draw, following up with a spot quiz and antakshari in the evening. The song session saw the eager residents showing off their musical prowess, while the youngsters were engrossed in testing their grey cells.

 At Happy Nook, near Ruby General Hospital, women gathered for the Shera Uttor contest after offering anjali, while the men cheered them on. 

 ?We had 17 participants showcasing their gift of the gab in three-minute extempore sessions,? said Kushal Roy, of the housing complex.

 At Hiland Park, off EM Bypass, the kids took over with crayons and colour pencils after anjali and a sumptuous lunch. The evening was reserved for the teens to flaunt their Puja wardrobe at the fashion show, while antakshari was meant for all with a fondness for melody. 

 But it was certainly the women of the highrise who kept the mood upbeat by trying their hand at the dhaak. 

 Sit-and-draw also kept the kids busy at Saptaparni, on Ballygunge Circular Road, while at Purbayan Apartment, it was the drawing contest coupled with a spot quiz. 

 In Salt Lake, the little ones showed the way at Labony Housing, where around 75 of them gathered with paint and palette for the sit-and-draw contest. Split up in three age groups, the event found the contestants at their creative best. Later in the day, eight teams of five participants each squared off for antakshari. ?Both the contests had a tremendous response with all of us either taking part in the contests or cheering the participants,? added Anutosh Mukherjee of Labony Housing.

 In Behala, the little residents of ODRC Rental took to paint brush and crayons with great gusto. ?Around 35 children in two age groups took part in the sit-and-draw, and for the antakshari, we had 20 teams of two each trying the preliminary round,? said Himangshujyoti Choudhury.

 In the northern end of town, a fierce battle of wits followed lunch at CMDA Housing Estate in Barrackpore with teams of two participants each. But more was in store at night, when the girls in all their finery took the stage for creative dance. Spot quiz was what kept the youngsters and their families on tenterhooks at both CIT Building in Girish Park and Anandalok Abashik in Dum Dum. 

 At Purbayan Udayan Sangho in Sodepur, the evening took off on a musical note with the residents teaming up for antakshari and spot quiz keeping the spirits high. 

 At Aurobindo Arena in Khardah, the women showed off their conch-blowing skills after the children performed for the creative dance contest. Conch-blowing stole the evening show at Basant Bihar, in Belghoria, too, while Minakshi Housing, on Teghoria Main Road, started off with a sit-and-draw, before wrapping up Saptami with spot quiz.

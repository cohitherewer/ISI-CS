 If the kiddies ? and their parents ? have pulled out their favourite stockings for Santa to fill up with goodies, don the old man?s red coat for a day and be ready to shower gifts on near and dear ones.

 Christmas gifts are good fun ? it is an occasion when you can give just about anything as a present. From edibles and knick-knacks to clothes, jewellery, home d?cor items and hi-tech gadgets, just fix a budget and set out on your hunt.

 If you are still confused about what to give after the year?s presents for birthdays, Pujas, anniversaries and every other occasion, read on for various options readily available in stores around town especially for Christmas.

 Sweet tooth

 If you are playing it safe, the foolproof choice is an assortment of cookies, chocolates and cakes available at standalone confectioners as well as five-star cake shops. Armed with one of these, you don?t need to worry too much about likes and dislikes. Some of the flavours are sure to find favour.

 Xmas tunes

 The tunes of Jingle bells and Rudolph the red nosed reindeer can bring back sweet childhood memories for many. For the music-minded, this is a nice time to give a bunch of carols on cassette or CD.

 Music stores across the city and departmental stores have special Christmas music racks put up to help find those favourite collections of tunes from everyone?s school days. Albums of Boney M, assorted songs under titles like Christmas Magic and Joy to the World priced at Rs 199 per CD could be a timely gift. ?In the last 10 days we have already sold 130 copies of the album Christmas Magic,? said a spokesperson of Landmark. 

 This is the time carol collections and other Christmas songs sell, agrees Lalita Sinha, regional head, MusicWorld. ?The Christmas albums are moving fast now and this is a trend we see every year. The high sales usually continue till December 26,? says Sinha.

 The store has a rack full of Xmas melodies in albums like Christmas with the Beach Boys, Christmas Magic, Christmas with Dean Martin, Jim Reeves? Christmas Song Book, Acoustic Hymns, My First Christmas and Bonny M ? 20 greatest Christmas Songs. The CDs are priced between Rs 150 and Rs 399.

 Brewed best 

 The Yuletide feast is incomplete unless you raise a toast in the spirit of things. So wines remain one of the most common gifts for the occasion. Even in this segment, mould wines, the home-made variety, are the popular picks for Christmas. And you get them really cheap if you make an effort to hunt for some friendly families in the Bow Barrack area who brew it at home during this time of the year. A bottle of 750 ml comes for as low as Rs 85 to Rs 90.

 Kids? stuff

 Filling up stockings for your child is possibly the most exciting part of Christmas since few things make you feel merrier than seeing a smile on your little one?s face.

 Toys remain the most favoured gifts, so heading for the toy section of a departmental store promises to be a prudent step.

 ?Internationally, December is considered the end of the season for toys. Manufacturers usually offer large discounts during this time of the year,? explains Gautam Jatia of Landmark.

 In fact, the store has large discounts on everything ranging from Pokemon toys to badminton rackets, toy bikes and cars, soft toys and even Barbie dolls. Picking up a badminton racket for just Rs 20 or a Pokemon figure for Rs 29 is quite possible. The soft toy selection, which includes the quintessential red-coated Santa, is available at Rs 50 onwards.

 ?Besides this, we also have books on Bible stories and Christmas tales on offer,? adds Jatia. While a small collection of 10 books on Bible stories would cost around Rs 250, single books are much cheaper.

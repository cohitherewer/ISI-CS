The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Boy with the answers

He has never stood anything but first in any exam, has 

a photographic memory, wants to be an engineer and recently beat 20,000 applicants 

in a test of knowledge. Shubham Prakhar, all of 12 years old, is India?s child 

genius. The boy from Muzaffarpur chatted with Sudeshna Banerjee about his 

new-found fame and how it happened

 Shubham with his parents, grandmother (far 

left) and quizmaster Siddharth Basu, on the sets of the show. 

.The semi-final of Britannia India?s Child Genius 

was caught in a moment of suspense. Of the three remaining contestants, one had 

already qualified for the finals. The other two were tied in a sudden-death situation. 

?That was the only time I felt nervous,? recalls Shubham Prakhar, crowned India?s 

pre-teen quiz king on the Children?s Day show on Star World this Sunday. 

The boy from Muzaffarpur, representing the east zone, 

aced the tie-breaker (on geography) to leave south zone champion Ashwat behind. 

The final, against west zone champ Sachit, was comparatively easy, with Shubham 

wrapping up the proceedings on the fifth question itself as the gap between the 

two became unbridgeable. 

?We expected him to qualify in the nation-wide written 

round held in February,? says his businessman-father Kumar Navin, but the topper?s 

spot among 5,000 kids, who were chosen from among 20,000 applicants to the contest, 

came as a boost. From then on, Shubham just kept crossing one hurdle after another. 

?I have never come second in any exam,? the 12-year-old says over telephone, voice 

steeled with quiet resolution.

Both parents stress on their son?s regularity in studies 

as his strength. ?He also has a photographic memory,? adds his father. His ?extraordinary? 

faculties were noted by quizmaster Siddharth Basu as well. ?He told me that he 

was seeing a new quizmaster in me,? says the self-confessed voracious reader, 

a fan of Charles Dickens, Shakespeare and J.K. Rowling, who idolises Rahul Dravid 

for the cricketer?s ?consistency and power of concentration?.

Shooting for the episode had taken place in August, 

but news of the success, as per a contract with the channel, had to be kept a 

secret. ?It was really tough. When our relatives came over on Sunday night to 

see the final at our place, we had to tell them the result as the show started,? 

laughs his mother Archana Kumari. Since then, the house has been flooded with 

visitors and local mediapersons. The trophy, lodged so long in Shubham?s room 

along with the Encyclopaedia Britannica CDs he has won, had to be shifted to the 

drawing room to satisfy visitors. The Rs 10-lakh booty will take some time to 

materialise though ? six years, to be precise. But the student of DAV Public School 

is looking forward to a more immediate future. ?My teachers have promised a treat 

when we reopen on November 22,? says the bespectacled boy.

The other prize has been his new-found friends. ?Sachit, 

Ashwat, Anubhav and I have kept in touch. Sachit mailed me today after watching 

the final,? Shubham says. Quizzing may have given him fame and friends, but Shubham 

is unlikely to fulfil Basu?s prophecy of taking up quizzing. ?I want to become 

an engineer from IIT,? he declares.

Noisy 

night

Calcuttans experienced non-stop sound pollution on 

the night of Diwali. Apart from blaring mikes, firecrackers burst by youngsters 

contributed to the noisy cause. The pollution control board did its best to keep 

this in check. But some unruly people flouted the norms. The sound of crackers 

is disastrous for the condition of the ailing and the aged. It also keeps our 

night?s sleep at bay. I could not figure out whether it was a festival of light 

or noise.

Sourav?s pitch

After recovering from an injury, it was a good decision 

on Sourav Ganguly?s part to play in the Ranji match against Karnataka. He attracted 

many people to the ground, which would otherwise have been deserted. For international 

matches, there are sponsorships galore, but the contrast is stark for Ranji Trophy, 

despite the inclusion of players like Deep Dasgupta, Devang Gandhi, Rohan Gavaskar, 

Sunil Joshi and Doda Ganesh. This gives us an idea of its popularity. Although 

Sourav?s performance was disastrous, it benefited cricket. There were a reasonable 

number of people to see Sourav. This must have also boosted the morale of the 

other players. The board should try to improve the status of first-class cricket. 

It needs more publicity.

Price pain

The prices of everyday needs, from vegetables to stationary 

goods, are going up every day. The most recent shock was the price hike of cooking 

gas by Rs 21.70, and the news that it will go up every month by Rs 5. As salaries 

among most of the middle and lower-middle class are fixed and don?t increase at 

the same rate as the prices of necessary goods, they are the worst sufferers. 

Our state?s politicians should protest this and put pressure on the Centre for 

a rollback.

Sourish Misra

Health high

Won?t it be prudent for the big (private) investors 

of the city to join hands and invest in a project focussing on low-cost hospitals 

offering decent standards of health and medical facilities, which the poorer sections 

of society can have easy access to? A sufficient number of malls and entertainment 

plazas have already come up. Calcutta?s living standards will improve in the real 

sense only if the basic infrastructure is upgraded. Our government-run hospitals 

don?t seem to be in a condition good enough for even stray cats and dogs inhabiting 

them, with whom patients often have to share beds!

Poor politics

Political instability has again affected the economy 

of India. After the elections, the economy has taken a beating this year. Its 

dependence on politics has been proven around the world. India is a classic example 

of a country with great potential for growth getting swamped in political instability. 

There appears to be no respite in sight from this syndrome. Keen political observers 

wonder how the so-called representatives of the people can stoop so low ethically 

when they have to go back to those they represent to be re-elected. Are Indian 

voters so gullible?

The 

Timeless Wait

Distracted from the eyes of a million passersby,

I stand with an empty begging bowl; 

No one stops or chances a glance, 

I fret in a timeless wait, alone. 

Rich lady, rich man, 

And the longest car in Heaven ? 

Not a peek, not even a glance, 

I hear no sound of a clinking coin. 

The endless night seems to swoop, 

I hide behind the pavement nook; 

My dreamless eyes stare focuslessly 

On the emptiness before me. 

My tired hands still beg before He, 

As a midnight star looks down on me.

Cold Ashes

I see you burn 

Silently 

Weeping 

Under the coverlet of the night 

At least you burn? 

I see you shiver 

Lighting up the night 

Wisps of smoke 

Fading away; 

I see you melt 

Licking at the darkness 

Tongue smeared 

With wax. 

I look at you 

My heart like a lump of lead 

Refuses to beat.

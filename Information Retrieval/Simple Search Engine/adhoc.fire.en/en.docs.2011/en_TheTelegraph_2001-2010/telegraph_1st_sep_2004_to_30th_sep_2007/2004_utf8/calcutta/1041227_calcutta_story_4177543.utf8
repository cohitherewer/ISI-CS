 They came with a mission that?s lived up to all their expectations and more. The 21 Pakistani children have still got a way to go before they end their mission, but they claim to be completely ?overwhelmed? already, with the love, friendship and support they have so far received. 

 ?Our message of peace between the two countries and child rights has been received so well. It?s wonderful,? gushes 18-year-old Nabila, from Kasur, in Punjab, Pakistan. 

 As part of the Beyond Boundaries project, initiated by Leapfrog in Delhi and Action Aid in Pakistan, she has crossed the border to play cricket with Indian children. She still works in the fields back home, but it?s a far cry from her life a few years ago. She now even knows how to play cricket, which her parents allowed her to after much convincing.

 Accompanying the Pakistani group are about 25 Indian children from various NGOs around the country. They spent three days in Calcutta hosted by CINI Asha ? one stop in the three-week, nine-city tour.

 After their arrival on Friday was a trip to Raj Bhavan to meet the governor. Christmas day began with a trip to Gandhi Bhavan, for a history lesson. Then it was game time, with the Indo-Pak XI versus the Don Bosco Park Circus XI. The visitors won the match, prompting much celebration with singing and dancing at the night?s dinner and bonfire session at St Thomas? School, Kidderpore, where they are staying. Shah Rukh Khan was the favourite, with his songs and moves doing the rounds at the bonfire party.

 ?The kids were particularly excited after they found out that the Don Bosco team was the champ in the school cricketing circuit here,? says Saumya Sen, founder-director, Leapfrog. But the star of the show was Nazia, the only girl on the field. She didn?t get a chance to bat, but is determined to have a go in the next match, in Hyderabad.

 ?Most of the Pakistani children were a little apprehensive of how they would be received here, what the differences between the two countries would amount to, but they have all lost their inhibitions. They didn?t expect such a warm welcome,? Sen adds.

 When the first cross-border venture happened in April, with 32 under-privileged children from India going to Pakistan, the most ?incredible experience? was in Kasur, with their reception becoming a carnival. They were treated like ?rock stars?, by an audience of thousands.

 That memory was echoed on Sunday afternoon at Diamond Harbour High School, where the Indo-Pak XI played the Diamond Harbour XI, from CINI Asha?s project. Hundreds of local residents queued up to cheer the teams. That was after a launch ride on the Hooghly in the morning and a rally for child rights from the jetty to the school grounds. About a thousand children with personal posters and messages marched with the visitors, joining hands for a common cause.

 The rural folk are far more spontaneous. The food is not quite up to the mark ? ?the rotis are fatter at home, so we feel a little drained at times?. And there are no differences between Pakistanis and Indians. That?s just some of the lessons the youngsters are taking back home. And the love. 

 ?The children have enjoyed themselves. They don?t even miss home. It?s been great,? smiles Nusrat Sheikh of Action Aid, the Pakistan group leader.

 ?I want to start more programmes like this, especially in Calcutta,? adds Sen. ?Boundaries can be anything -? faith, religion or cultural and economic backgrounds.?

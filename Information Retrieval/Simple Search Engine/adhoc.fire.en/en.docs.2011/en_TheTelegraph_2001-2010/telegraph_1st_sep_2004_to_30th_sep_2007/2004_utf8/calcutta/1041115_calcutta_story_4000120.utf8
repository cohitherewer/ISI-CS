 Morality of a fallen woman

 The corruption, hypocrisy and double standards plaguing our so-called modern, civilised society comprise the theme of Theatrecians latest production, Jean-Paul Sartre?s The Respectful Prostitute. Ostensibly a hard-hitting play on racial discrimination, it reflects the attitude of the whites towards the blacks. Yet, interpreted in the present context, the play makes an ironic comment on the abuse, cruelty and exploitation exercised by those in authority and positions of power against the poor and weak. Lizy, a prostitute, is raped and circumstances prevent her from seeing the perpetrator of the assault. She is then influenced, convinced and forced to admit by the Senator, his son Fred and Fred?s friends that she has been raped by a coloured man. Events take a dramatic turn when the alleged accused seeks refuge in Lizy?s house. Tormented by the demands of society and yet stricken by her own conscience, Lizy suffers from disbelief, disillusionment and frustration. Directed by Tanusree Das.

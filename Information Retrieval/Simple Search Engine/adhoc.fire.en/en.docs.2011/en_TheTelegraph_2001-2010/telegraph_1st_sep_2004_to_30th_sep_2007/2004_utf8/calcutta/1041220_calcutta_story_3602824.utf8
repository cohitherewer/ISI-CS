Mandarin 

Gourmet is the latest addition to the relish roster in the city?s original Chinese 

grub hub. The 170-seater restaurant is at 50B Matheswartala Road near Grace Ling 

Liang High School.

 ?Owing to the boom in the food sector, I decided to branch into it,? says Eddy Chang, owner of the property. But the lack of know-how is no stumbling block.

 ?The food served here would be authentic and on a par with any other restaurant in this area. My chefs have been globetrotting and have mastered the art of making authentic Chinese food. The spices are also being brought in from China,? claims Eddy Chang.

 Tiffany trend

 Essential is the name of the design game for Priyanjali Ray. Her debut display at 5, Alipore Park Road is labelled Western Essentials, with the focus firmly on simplicity.

 According to Priyanjali, ?It?s the Breakfast at Tiffany?s look that?s present somewhere, maybe just a dash here and there in the styles and cuts of this line.?

 Winter colours ranging from earthy tones to classic whites and blacks, subtle and bold hues of grape, pink, red, olive green and blue are visible. For the winter parties and cocktails season, the evening dresses with some scarves to accessorise them are knee-length in well-stylised cuts and shapes. Boatnecks, round-necks and even regular V-shaped low cuts are part of this line. Lace, both embroidered and more simple, have been used as part of the material in some of the dresses, the others being crepe, satin, chiffon, linen, cotton jersey and raw silk. All priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,500.

 There are simple cotton jersey T-shirts, mostly in blacks, linen and crepe shirts, plus plain and embroidered camisoles in satin and chiffon. 

 Then there are the skirts, simple, layered, knee-length skirts with back, side and front slits. ?What I like most about the skirts is their simplicity. The subtle beaded embroidery makes them wearable and chic,? said actress Moon Moon Sen, at the wine-and-cheese preview.

 And finally, there?s a great range of shoes, priced between Rs 1,400 and Rs 2,500. The three-day exhibition will be on till Tuesday, but interested buyers can place orders after that as well.

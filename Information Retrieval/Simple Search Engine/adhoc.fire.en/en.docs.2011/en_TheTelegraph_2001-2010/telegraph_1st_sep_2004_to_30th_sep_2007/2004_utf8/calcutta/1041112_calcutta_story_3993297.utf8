Theatre short shrift

Bells clanging loud from the temple next door. A few 

bulbs twinkling in the corridor. A huge cardboard tree peeping out from near the 

end of a long passage. Tattered cloth for stage wings and a lightman visible through 

a hole in the curtains.

But Bijon Theatre, the venue for Shohan?s ongoing 

Short Play Festival, is trying hard to make up with enthusiastic patrons what 

it lacks in hall management and funds. Since the inauguration last week, the festival 

has already seen many theatre troupes from all over Bengal performing on the north 

Calcutta stage near Khanna cinema.

 The rest of the total of 20 troupes from the districts will put up shows till November 20 at Academy of Fine Arts, apart from Bijon Theatre where veterans were felicitated and an exhibition on Utpal Dutt, Shambhu Mitra and Ajitesh Bandopadhyay is being held.

 ?This year?s festival is an improvement on last year?s in that we have a bigger number of participants,? says Anish Ghosh, director of Shohan, organisers of the festival.

 But that is where, apparently, the movement forward ends. For Samir Sengupta, of Ashani Natyam from South 24-Parganas, the footfall at Bijon Theatre was a definite letdown. ?We are used to acting on open-air stages, in front of thousands. Here, with few people in the audience, we feel there is a dearth of inspiration.?

 Playwright-actor Debashish Sarkar, of group Unity Malancha, Halishahar, explains: ?For all of us, theatre is our livelihood. Though we do it out of love, the joy of being appreciated by the audience cannot be replaced by anything.?

 Bibhash Chakraborty, a patron of the festival, blames the meagre attendance on Calcutta?s current attitude towards theatre watching. ?Earlier it was a passion, now it is totally dependent on review-centric hype. It is therefore natural that these groups from the districts do not command full-houses, as nobody knows about them.?

But there?s still reason for hope with some passionate 

stage soldiers like 16-year-old Shubhodip Das trudging all the way from Nadia 

for a bit-role in a production.

Act of unity

The Interactive Resource Center (IRC) was formed in 

Pakistan in December 2000 to explore avenues for community mobilisation and awareness. 

Issues pertaining to gender, political education and minority rights are addressed 

by IRC using interactive theatre technique, an altogether new form, as it reaches 

out beyond cultural stereotypes and societal taboos.

 Main man Mohammed Waseem?s pursuit for making theatre more communicative and interactive has made IRC a phenomenon. A play by IRC, directed by Waseem, will be staged at Rabindra Sadan on November 19, at 6 pm.

 On a different note, a medley of music, enactment and play-readings is lined up at Caf? Coffee Day, Tripura Enclave, on November 18.

Themed around one?s search for identity, Shekor 

(Roots?) features Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee and Amartya Banerjee in play-reading, 

poetry-reading by stage artiste Bijoylakshmi Burman, enactment by percussionist 

Bikram Ghosh and music recital by Suchanda Ghosh, among others.

Twin tide

A lifestyle store, instead of the conventional closed-door 

auditorium, was the setting for Dolly Basu?s two-act play Dui Tarango last 

weekend. Hosted by Ladies Study Group, the performance at Hugli, in Hastings Court, 

mingled festive shopping with a cultural fervour. On one flank of the store, the 

director-actress kept the audience of around 100 women enthralled with two different 

characterisations but with minimal props.

 Seated on a bench in a park, the woman protagonist of the first half embarks on a journey into her past, sharing her memories, loneliness and craving for warmth with a stranger. 

 In complete contrast to the opening piece, the second play, adapted from a short story by Nabaneeta Dev Sen, revolves around a writer desperately trying to meet the deadline for a magazine article. What she looks for through a series of witty situations is the true meaning of love. 

 Basu takes the stage at Academy of Fine Arts this Saturday at 6.30 pm for yet another Choopkatha production, Mrs Soriano.

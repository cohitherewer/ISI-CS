The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 50 called to foil air lock

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Desperate measures are being put in place to deal with the desperate situation likely at the airport on Monday.

 Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials spent Wednesday trying to figure out how the city airport could be prevented from being paralysed on September 27, when 3,000 employees go on mass casual leave to protest the Centre?s privatisation push.

 The AAI listed 50 employees ? both technical and non-technical ? and asked them to stay back at the airport after duty on Sunday to maintain normalcy on Monday. Plans to ?book? some retired employees for a day are also afoot.

 The joint action forum of employees and officers has refused to heed the AAI?s word. Forum officials on Wednesday reiterated their threat to ?paralyse? the city airport.

 ?We will not allow any employee or officer to join duty on Monday. We will also not allow any vehicle to enter the airport compound,? said an official of the forum.

 Forum activists will, apparently, organise roadblocks at all entry points to the airport on Monday to prevent any employee or officer from reporting to work.

 CPM member of Parliament from Dum Dum Amitava Nandi warned of ?dire consequences? if the AAI made any attempt to foil the move to protest privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports. 

 ?We are helpless. We are determined to register our protest against the Centre that has initiated the move to privatise the two (profit-making) airports. If necessary, we will apply force to make the agitation a success on Monday,? Nandi warned.

 He claimed that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had accepted the Left demand for not privatising any profit-making public sector undertaking. ?We consider the UPA government?s action a breach of trust and we are determined to make Monday?s agitation a great success,? stressed Nandi.

 Aituc leader Himansu Roy echoed Nandi and said all non-Left unions would also do everything to prevent the government from privatising the two airports.

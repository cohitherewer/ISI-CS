The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Putt, sweat, make a splash

 ClubSandwich

 Indoor mini-golf course, temperature-controlled 

 swimming pool with counter current, nightclub with latest 

 acoustics and illumination besides vacuum-filled double 

 glass cover for the dance arena, state-of-the-art health 

 club, Sony Play Stations, ornate banquets and well-appointed 

 conferencing facilities?

 Ocio at Belvedere, the ?country?s 

 first leisureplex? in Alipore, hopes to be fully functional 

 by New Year?s Day and reach out to Calcutta with an array 

 of top-of-the-line amenities. ?Leisure, pleasure, fitness 

 and business make up the four-pronged motto at Ocio and 

 we want to make sure it?s the preferred address in town 

 for the stressed-out urban soul to unwind,? stresses CEO 

 B.M. Thakkar.

 While looking at an optimum membership 

 strength of 500, the management plans to throw open most 

 of the facilities to walk-in clientele as well. ?The mini 

 golf course, swimming pool, the gym and the multi-cuisine 

 restaurant will all be open to the paying public and we 

 are in the process of firming up the walk-in rates,? Thakkar 

 says.

 The nightclub, which hopes to 

 ?offer a classy alternative to Tantra?, will also be thrown 

 open to walk-ins after 7 pm, and the dance floor will stay 

 warm to pulsating DJ beats till well past midnight. ?We 

 are keen to make sure that Ocio doesn?t stay the exclusive 

 preserve of the elite. So, we are keeping options open for 

 the pay-and-use crowd as well,? says general manager J.K. 

 Seal.

 Besides the synthetic putting 

 pad imported from Wisconsin, Ocio?s strength lies in the 

 three swimming pools in an air-conditioned environment. 

 The large one is temperature-controlled and suitable for 

 swimming in rain or shine with ambient temperature kept 

 compatible.

 The pool (picture above) is also 

 fitted with a counter-current device against which one can 

 swim for exercise and test one?s level of competence. Two 

 luxurious steam closets with body jet massage showers, a 

 special jacuzzi with 33 massage pressures, an aqua aerobics 

 pool for exercise, a rain shower dance arena and a fibre-optic 

 chandelier placed over the aerobics/toddlers pool add to 

 the fun splash.

 The new-age gym equipped with 

 ultra-modern strength and cardio-vascular equipment with 

 eight individual TV screens, giant plasma TV and World Space 

 radio/CD/DVD player would excite both fitness freak and 

 casual participant.

 With resistance equipment from 

 Cybex International, members can also avail of the upgraded 

 Cybex Eagle premier strength equipment, ?for the first time 

 in the city?, says Thakkar.

 ?One can become a swimming, golf 

 or gym member by forking out Rs 40,000 for a year, while 

 we are offering annual membership for the family with access 

 to all facilities at a bundled price of Rs 90,000,? declares 

 the CEO. The family offer, valid till December 31, comes 

 with introductory incentives.

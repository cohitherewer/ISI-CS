 The festive feel peaked on Ashtami with a beeline for anjali and everybody wanting a share of the bhog bounty. The puja in the morning gave way to pleasure and entertainment in the evening, that continued well into Navami.

 At the Bank Garden Club in Bansdroni (Bank of Baroda housing complex) the spotlight was on the Spot Quiz, that saw more than 30 eager participants grinding their grey cells to come up with the right answers. 

 But diya-lighting was an all-woman affair, with the ethnic best on display. Dhunuchi Naach brought two groups ? one comprising the Under-20 gang and the other the 20-plus group ? to their feet.

 If the bankers had a blast in Bansdroni, mahila might ruled at Citizen?s Cooperative, Maniktala Main Road. 

 ?We thought the 35-year-old puja required a change and so we formed a committee of five females and took the reins in our hands,? explained Mita Chakraborty, president of the puja committee.

 And did the menfolk grin or grumble? ?Thankfully, they have been extending their co-operation till now,? chuckled the president. After sidelining the men from puja organisation, the female force took over the Sankho Badan, 4:1. ?All the eight participants are trying to outdo the others,? said Chakraborty, about competition invading camaraderie!

 At the 42-year-old Regent Estate puja, the female fraternity was all geared up to hijack the Shera Uttor once the anjali got over. ?The ladies are quite keen to participate in the contest. Owing to the great hype, we have kept it open to all and even deferred our lunch till the programme gets over,? said Manas Banerjee of Regent Estate.

 At Binayak Enclave in Sinthee, Shera Uttor was a big draw and also a huge cause of hilarity, as the battlefield of words soon turned into a merry ground of gags when participants came up with funny speeches, slipping into the shoes of the Prime Minister of India. The quiz contest that followed was, however, serious business.

 It was an evening of sound and sight at Mecon Tower, on Prince Anwar Shah Road. The evening kick-started with Sankho Badan, but it was the fashion fiesta that stole the show. Ethnic ensembles or denim dash, kolhapuris or Hush Puppies, one-upmanship was the couture call. It all ended on a melodious note, thanks to Antakshari.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

The buzz on the quiz 

A grand total of 1,098 entries ? with most pouring in 

way past the deadline ? makes it the biggest open quiz in India. The Telegraph 

Open-quiz Show (TOPS) has taken the east by storm, as eager quizzers line 

up to prove their mettle. Space constraint means 600 teams, chosen on a first-come-first-served 

basis, will take the stage on Saturday at Science City auditorium with a 2,000-plus 

audience expected to cheer them on. Young Metro catches the buzz.

Guwahati Gangs

Quizzing is sometimes like the 100-metre dash in the 

Olympics ? it?s all about speed and photo-finish. Three young men, calling themselves 

MI3, crossed the finish line a fraction of a second ahead in the tie-breaker to 

emerge winners in the Guwahati leg of TOPS on September 4. Jagat Jyoti Saikia, 

Manasjyoti Sarmah and Biswajit Phukan, however, will not be able to make it to 

the Calcutta finals due to exams. Taking their place will be Vedanta Kumar Talukdar, 

Pranami Tamuli and Hrishikesh Mali ? Class XI students of team Mensa, who came 

in second after losing the tie-breaker, despite tying with MI3 with 105 points 

after eight rounds. Quizomaniacs came in third. Six teams qualified for the final 

round from the 150.

Ranchi Rage

The quiz drew 160 teams, including participants from 

nearby cities like Jamshedpur, Bokaro and Dhanbad. After a written test, six teams 

made it to the final, with the audience count touching 900. Team Think ? Nikhil 

Kumar Verma, Abhishek Rathore and Narayan Ramkrishnan, budding engineers from 

Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra ? walked away winners with 150 points. Think 

will now compete with the top six teams from Calcutta, as well as Mensa from Guwahati.

TOPS is presented in association with Royal Challenge 

golf accessories in all three cities, and is organised by Derek O?Brien and Associates. 

While quizmaster Dyu D?Cunha did the honours in Guwahati and Ranchi, Derek O?Brien 

himself will take centrestage at Science City auditorium on September 18.

Calcutta Connection

Quiz fans have been enthusiastically queueing up to 

get passes for the Saturday event in Calcutta, which will feature Bangla band 

Bhoomi and a special round with live performances and a sprinkling of stars. Meanwhile, 

housewives to students, marketing executives, IAS and IPS officers (including 

the DC, headquarters, and income-tax commissioners), lawyers and many more have 

all signed up to take part.

Five teams will go through to the finals. They will 

be joined by Team Calcutta, comprising three eminent citizens who have lost out 

in the prelims.

One prominent person in the quizzing circuit will 

be inducted into the hall of fame.

Here?s what quizmaster Derek has to say on D-Day eve: 

?The response is absolutely fantastic. It?s a very humbling experience. People 

said the tradition of open quizzing was dead, and just look at the enthusiasm. 

I am very happy and excited about the show.?

What?s on your mind this week 

Inhumanity

I am unable to understand why the word ?humane? is 

used with reference to humans and ?cruel? when it comes to animals. Most living 

thing are more humane than us. It has been proved in the past and is now being 

proven by the Americans and Iraqis in Iraq, Chechens in Russia and so on. The 

list is long. I think it is time to swap the meaning of ?being a human? and ?being 

an animal?, because I think animals are more humane than humans in every aspect.

Discordant note

I feel dejected when the elderly talk about the current 

trends in film music in derogatory terms. By film music, the indication is Hindi 

films (the less talked about Bengali movies the better). Our seniors are so obsessed 

with the Burmans and Laxmikant-Pyarelals that they fail to take note of the talent 

of composers like A.R. Rahman and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. I don?t disagree that the 

spirit of brotherhood is gradually disappearing from the music scene, but is it 

reason enough to undermine their mettle? Today?s music is a perfect blend of the 

east and the west. I request them to spare a few minutes to listen before judging.

Our world

What a wonderful world we live in, smeared with blood, 

stricken with panic, shrinking in terror and crying out in agony. Terrorism has 

spread like wildfire. Are the terrorists who held the children hostage in school 

and killed so many of them human beings? Before shooting those innocents, did 

they recall their own childhood? Probably not. Are they made of flesh and blood? 

How did so much hatred, so much vengeance, get into them? And what did they achieve 

by killing those kids, harbingers of the next generation? I do not know. I am 

probably naive, acting my age. I can?t help it, it?s the world I live in.

Terror strikes

The brutal act by terrorists in the Russian school 

was shocking. Can they be called ?humans?? We are called humans because we have 

control over our animal instincts. These people obviously don?t. Dhananjoy Chatterjee 

was condemned and hanged for the rape and murder of one girl, but what about these 

people who are responsible for the loss of so many innocent lives? They don?t 

deserve any human rights. They are an insult to the human race. 

The lost lives cannot be recovered, but serious action 

needs to be taken against such crimes, or else peace will fail.

Castigation

One must applaud Zaki Mubarki?s focus on rape in this 

column last week. But his comprehension is a let down, since it is a girl whose 

life is destroyed. Why should Purnima support her husband, when he has not only 

ruined Hetal?s life, but also deceived her? He said that criminals should be imprisoned, 

so that they come out as better human beings. But does Zaki have an answer to 

the rape committed by a policeman? Dhananjoy raped and killed a minor girl. Did 

his conscience take a backseat then? Zaki?s views should be redefined, since accepting 

facts and supporting the unreal are on parallel planes.

The 

Girl In Front Of The Sheetal Shop

?Sheetal Dresses and Designs?

Isn?t that a familiar name?

Yes, of course, these are the dresses

that lead the beauty queens to fame.

In beauty pageants

Sheetal promotes our ?Indian beauties?,

Who consider ?welfare of the under-privileged?

as one of their essential duties.

Right in front of this designer shop

which most of the beauty queens wear,

A reality scene took place

which I would like to share.

Standing outside the clothes shop

this little girl had no clothes at all,

All she had was a piece of cloth

and her very special doll.

It was raining very heavily

and she was drenched to the skin,

But with her doll, she was in her own world

and was very happy from within.

She used the piece of cloth she had

to wipe and clean her doll,

She was so full of love and concern

that she did not think about herself at all.

When even the girl could care for others

What?s wrong with Miss Universe, Miss World and Miss 

Earth?

Why aren?t they doing everything they can

to help children who are less fortunate at birth?

Indian beauties who wear Sheetal dresses

promise to make child welfare their priority on top,

But then how could a girl be naked and without clothes 

in front of the very same shop?

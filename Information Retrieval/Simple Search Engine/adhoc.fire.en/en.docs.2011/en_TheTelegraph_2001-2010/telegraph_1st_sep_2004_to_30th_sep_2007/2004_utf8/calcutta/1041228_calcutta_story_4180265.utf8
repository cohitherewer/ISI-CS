 Embroidered dreams

 With its origin in the hamlets of Bengal, kantha is one of the most enduring art forms. For centuries, women of rural Bengal have expressed themselves artistically through kantha embroidery, stitching colourful stories from legend, mythology and folk culture. Revived in recent times through the efforts of Sreelata Sarkar as an effective means to help underprivileged women get gainful employment, kantha has indeed come a long way from its humble beginnings. Carrying on her mother?s mission of supporting needy women, at the same time adapting this traditional handicraft to the needs of modern fashion couture, Neelanjana Ghose dreams of bringing the world closer culturally through her designs. The exhibition of her kantha creations showcases an innovative blend of traditional Indian symbols and motifs with contemporary design concepts from all over the world, lending her works a wider, universal appeal. Inauguration by Nabaneeta DevSen this evening at 5.30. Guest of honour: Paritosh Sen.

 Event: Exhibition of Kantha creations by Neelanjana Ghose

 When: December 28 - 31 and January 2; 4 pm - 8 pm

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From Chicago, bell to ring in centenary

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It all began when a young lawyer in Chicago felt homesick, wanting to recreate the community feeling of his childhood in rural Vermont. 

 So, on February 23, 1905, Paul P. Harris invited three friends a coal dealer, a merchant tailor and a mining engineer to a friendly meeting in his office. The rest, as they say, is history of Rotary.

 Today, Rotary International boasts around 1.2 million members in about 31,000 clubs in 166 countries. As the numbers of the club burgeoned, so the meetings began to rotate. Hence, the name Rotary. 

 In fact, the motto coined at the 1906 convention, Service, Not Self, remains today, as Service Before Self.

 The centenary celebrations will be held in the city of its birth in February next year. But Calcutta holds a special position in Rotarys history. 

 Rotary Club of Calcutta was the first one in Eurasia, and is the oldest one in the region. It was organised in September 1919, and received its charter on January 1, 1920.

 The Old Number One has had members like Surendranath Banerjee (the first Indian invited to join Rotary), Jagadish Chandra Bose, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Nitish Chandra Laharry (the first Asian president of Rotary International in 1962). 

 Speakers at Rotary Club of Calcutta, which heads District 3290, with 186 clubs and nearly 1,600 members in Nepal, Bengal and Port Blair, include Mahatma Gandhi, Sarojini Naidu and Clement Atlee.

 Prior to February 23, the yearlong celebration includes a unique Olympic torch-style event, where five bells will travel around the world and back to Chicago. One will journey to the first 100 clubs in USA, Canada, the UK and Ireland. The other four will go to the first Rotary clubs in each country in the world.

 Calcutta will be the only city with that honour in India, where the bell will arrive from Lahore on Wednesday. It will be unveiled and rung by Governor Viren J. Shah at a ceremony on September 9, after a bugle call by Eastern Command jawans. 

 The bell will move on to Kathmandu on September 18, after visits to other clubs in the city and the youth arm of Rotary, Interact.

 Programmes will be held in every club of District 3290, says S.S. Kanoria, chairman, centennial committee. There will be a walkathon on September 25 in Kathmandu, to raise money for a cancer institute. Celebrities like Manisha Koirala will also participate, added district governor Prabir Chakravarti. 

 Some rotarians are gearing up for a trip to Chicago in February, while about 300-400 will attend the annual convention from June 18 to 22.

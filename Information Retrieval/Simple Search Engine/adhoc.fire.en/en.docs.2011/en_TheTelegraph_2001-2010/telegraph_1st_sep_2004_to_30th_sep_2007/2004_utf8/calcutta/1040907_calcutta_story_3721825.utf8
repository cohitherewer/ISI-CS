 Rampant racket in green firm tags

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A section of the Indian industry stands accused of procuring bogus ISO 14001 certificates, relating to environmental norms accepted across the globe.

 The accusers: representatives from the media, the state pollution control board and the NGO lobby.

 The ISO 14001 certificate, being awarded in India since the mid-1990s, recognises a firms efforts to ensure better environment management for the industries, apart from ensuring economic benefit as well as more transparency . Its increasingly becoming obligatory for companies willing to do business in developed countries to possess the certificate.

 At a recent seminar, ISO 14001: Myths and Realities How industries can derive the best, held in the city office of the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), several speakers came down on a section of the industry and certifying agencies for trading in bogus ISO 14001 certificates.

 Yes, were receiving an increasing number of allegations that some of the ISO 14001 awardees in the state actually dont deserve it, said Nazib Arif, ICC secretary-general. A few agencies, with inadequate infrastructure and following not-so-transparent procedures, are in the business of churning out bogus certificates. Even the employees of some of the awardee firms are in the dark about the recognition, an ICC official added.

 Tapas Gupta, senior environmental engineer (planning) in the state pollution control board, agreed: There are instances of information gap between the management and shopfloor personnel in certain state-based ISO firms. In his presentation at the seminar, he said: A few ISO companies sometimes even fail to meet the laid-down environmental standards, especially in the field of effluent treatment. 

 The speakers were almost unanimous that the overall credibility of the ISO certification procedure is at stake. 

 An industry representative said: Bogus ISO certification is affecting those who have gone the whole hog to acquire the recognition. Foreign clients have started questioning the credibility of the ratings in our country. 

 Prasun Kundu of DNV, a top-notch certifying agency, said: Many companies are going for the certificate only to be able to enter the international market. Unless the National Accreditation Bureau for Certification Bodies (NABCB), which functions under the Quality Council of India, monitors the certifying agencies, such corrupt practices can never be stopped, Kundu added. 

 Company managers should understand that by adhering to ISO specifications, they also stand to gain financially by economising resource utilisation and achieving cost optimisation, observed an environmentalist.

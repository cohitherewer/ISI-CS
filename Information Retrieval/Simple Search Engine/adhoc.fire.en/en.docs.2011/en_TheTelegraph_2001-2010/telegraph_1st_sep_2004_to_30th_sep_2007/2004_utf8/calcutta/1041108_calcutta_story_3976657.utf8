 Candles, decorated pots, stained glass paintings, paper bags. Walls with posters on Calcutta and Indo-Pak friendship, cricket and Bollywood. Everything at the TTIS (The Telegraph in Schools) Exhibition-cum-Carnival for a cause was made by the students of Chowringhee High School. 

 To top it off, the proceeds from the sales of the youngsters? handiwork will go towards the higher education of a needy student.

 The posters in the stalls at Iran Society were the result of project work. The other items the students made during daylong classes on Saturdays for the past four months. The pots might have come from Kumartuli, but every brush stroke was theirs. So were the artificial flowers and bonsai trees, handmade paper bags, glass paintings and Diwali candles.

 Organised by the Interact Club of the school and Rotary International-Dist 3290, the two-day affair included events like a quiz and a dance. The team of five from Karachi High School were felicitated by the Rotary members and vice versa. Boys from the school will now sell the remaining stuff to shops and in malls to raise money.

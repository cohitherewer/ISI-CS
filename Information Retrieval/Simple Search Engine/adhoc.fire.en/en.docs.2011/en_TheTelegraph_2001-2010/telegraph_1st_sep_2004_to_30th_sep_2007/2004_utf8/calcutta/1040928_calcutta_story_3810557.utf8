The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 What We are Watching

TUBE TALK - five Hindi soaps

 A still from Kahiin To Hoga 

Following are the top five Hindi serials in Calcutta between September 5 and 11 as per Television Audience Measurement (TAM) data.

 Kyunki... Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi on STAR Plus (September 9 episode) firmly held the top spot with a 11.44 rating

 Kumkum on STAR Plus (September 6 episode) managed 9.41

 Kahiin To Hoga on STAR Plus (September 7 episode) reached 8.35

 Kasautii Zindagii Kay on STAR Plus (September 8 episode) scored 8.23

 Bhabhi on STAR Plus (September 6 episode) ended up with 7.62

 Ektaa: Magic touch

Incredible! The word can be used to describe STAR 

Plus. All five Hindi serials in Calcutta come on a single channel. That, in a 

place where the regional slant is one of the strongest in the country. Surprisingly, 

Sony?s Jassi or Zee?s Asitva poses no challenge to the STAR stable 

here. 

 Hats off to woman power, too, particularly to a woman by the name of Ektaa Kapoor. Four of the top five are her babies. They deal with the usual relationship complexities, joint-family problems and social stigmas, but it?s the Kapoor touch that makes each special.

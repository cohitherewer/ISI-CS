The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Protect and preserve

There are over 50,000 child domestic workers in Calcutta 

homes. Most are girls aged below 15, earning less than Rs 400 per month. Some 

of them are regularly abused, mentally and physically. Although Guria is out of 

danger and has her eyesight back after surgery, the plight of child domestic workers 

remains miserable, finds Young Metro.

The National Child Domestic Workers Project of the 

funding agency Save the Children, UK, helped repatriate 190 youngsters this year, 

who had been sent to the city to work as domestic helps. But a recent study conducted 

by the organisation, of 6,982 households surveyed in the city, found 82 per cent 

employed young girls as domestic workers. 

Eighty-four per cent work more than eight hours a 

day, and 24 per cent of the child domestic workers said what they earned didn?t 

reach their families. Some didn?t receive any money at all, while others weren?t 

properly fed. 

And of the 19,282 households surveyed across four 

areas ? North and South 24-Parganas, East Midnapore and 18 wards in Calcutta ? 

27 per cent of the families said their girls were abused or harassed.

West Bengal is one of the four states on top of the 

list supplying migrant child workers (the others being Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh 

and Orissa). Save the Children works with eight partner organisations to strike 

at the root of the problem by working in the districts. In urban areas, it advocates 

child rights. 

One of the successful methods in tackling the problem 

in cities is through intervention programmes by children themselves. Like Loreto 

Day School, Sealdah, one of the partner organisations. Two of these young bravehearts 

are Tina Kaviraj and Debparna Lahiri, both Class VIII students. They knock on 

doors in their neighbourhoods, convincing people to let the children they employ 

venture out for a couple of hours to drop-in centres, where they can laugh, play 

and enjoy themselves.

Tina works in Entally, Debparna in Sealdah. They have 

been doing it for two years now, with parental consent. Debparna?s neighbourhood 

has almost one child domestic worker in every home, and often, the employers are 

?very rude?. She was chased by a dog once, when the employer set him on her, but 

she?s not afraid. 

?It makes us angry, because they are mistreating us. 

We are only trying to help,? asserts Tina, who has so far helped five children. 

?The children don?t really say anything, but we know from the way they behave 

that they are happier when they are with us.?

But the statistics speak for themselves. Of those 

surveyed, 83 per cent dropped out of school at the primary level, 92 per cent 

of their families earn less than Rs 1,500 per month and 56 per cent are not given 

enough food.

There was a candle-light rally of solidarity on Thursday 

evening. Scheduled for Friday is a daylong workshop with state-level participation 

to drive the campaign forward. This will include performances by youngsters, presentations 

by schoolchildren on their experienc es, research findings and talks by NGOs.

Spoilsport

Sport is played to bring the world closer together. 

But what happened in Spain during a friendly between England and Spain was unpardonable.The 

racist abuse directed by Spanish fans at the English black players Shaun Wright-Phillips 

and Ashley Cole has brought the game to a new low. A mere apology from Spanish 

officials will not solve the matter, the stadium should be banned from hosting 

any international matches for a certain period. Playing matches without any spectators 

in the stadium (as suggested by some critics) makes no sense. It brings down the 

revenue and an empty stadium kills the spirit of the game. Matches should be stopped 

immediately when such behaviour is witnessed. And cameras should be focused on 

the crowd to catch troublemakers.

Ban bandh

Bandhs have become a matter of grave concern in Bengal 

today. The bandhs on November 17 (SUCI), November 22 (CPI-ML) and one more on 

December 3 (Trinamul), to protest the hike in petrol and diesel prices, only add 

to the problems of Calcuttans. These political parties have no right to do this. 

They don?t realise that calling bandhs is not a solution to problems. These irritating 

bandhs only obstruct vehicles from plying and stop people from going to work for 

fear of violence. Students and patients are the worst sufferers. Students either 

have exams cancelled or face harassment in reaching their destinations. The seriously 

ill cannot be quickly moved to hospitals due to unavailability of vehicles. Normal 

life is disrupted. It?s good that Calcutta High Court has created a special bench 

to hear bandh-related cases. It?s high time that the Bengal government puts pressure 

on the parties to dissuade them from calling bandhs that serve no purpose.

Labour of love

The story of Guria was a really saddening one. What?s 

more shocking is that her employers hold prestigious posts of a WHO officer and 

a teacher, seemingly important and humane jobs. Many of us have child servants 

at home, to toil and serve our every need from morning till night. We, as youths, 

can do as little as speak against child labour in our own homes or at least treat 

these kids with the minimum respect and provide them elementary education. It?s 

the least they deserve. I think what makes them even more extraordinary is the 

fact that they are compelled to leave their homes and families and earn a living 

at such tender ages as five or six. Kudos to Guria?s rescuers and to Loreto Day 

School, Sealdah, for taking care of her.

Playing games

After the unfortunate arrests of Dipankar Roy and 

Sashti Duley, Pinki Pramanik, an emerging athlete in the state, got entangled 

in a controversy. I was surprised to read that she had been caught for possessing 

a pistol. If any athlete is found guilty of wrongdoing, punishment should be meted 

out. The authorities and the players? families should be more careful in monitoring 

the movements of sportspersons. If the player?s propensity to get involved in 

illegal activities is curbed, it would help churn out future sports stars.

Just 

a thought...

Isn?t it true ?

Life is not at all, 

A bed of Roses, 

For many of us. 

But still we move: 

In search of Golden Paths, 

B?coz we do ?ve faith, 

In the Blessings of God.

Fusion

Thoughts run wild, 

At a frenzied pace; 

Trapped images 

Not all the fumes 

Of restless fury can efface. 

To dwell 

In a moment?s uncertainty, 

Where riotous motions 

Clash and blend, 

And sets the rhythm 

And the rhythm, 

Sets the trend.

Time Can Be Your Good Friend

It?s all over ? the festival of Joy. 

The cold touch of the North Wind is now upon us 

Which makes me miss everyday the morning school-bus.

I was enjoying the blissful slumber 

Till I heard the sounds of thunder 

That mark the beginning of the Joyous festival ? The dhak beats I mean. 

My heart leapt with joy. 

T?was drawing nearer and nearer ? the beat 

Until I realised that the dhakis were coming for an after-puja treat 

Mom handed over some clothes and cash 

And thus gifted them a simple smile. 

They went away, merry and gay 

Leaving behind the rhythmic beats 

Reverberated by the unforgiving clock ?ticks? 

?Back to some serious and systematic work ? I said

?Time only then, can be your good friend.?

Tech Talk Q amp;A

SHINE 

ON YOU CRAZY BOT

Sanyo?s glowing home robot 

Roborior, unveiled recently, is equipped with sensors and camera. It can detect 

intruders, noise, odour and temperature and alert the owner via mobile phone.

Thanks for writing in. Some more solutions to your 

queries on memory matters, Linux links, floppy foul-ups and email errors.

Partha Daskhan: I have a PC with Pentium III 

733 MHz processor, 192 MB SDRAM, 20 GB HDD and 810e Kranion motherboard. My computer 

hangs frequently when I try to minimise any window. The problem arises when the 

PC has run for some time. I was told that the bus speed of RAM is not matching 

the processor.

TechTalk: The causes may be bus-speed mismatch, 

faulty memory module, CPU over-heating etc. Since you have 192 MB of RAM, the 

trouble could be due to memory module(s). You have one 64 MB and one 128 MB memory 

module. Either they run at different bus speeds or one of them is faulty. Power 

off the PC, open the cabinet and carefully remove one module from the motherboards 

memory slot. Switch on the computer and see if it runs without hiccups. Repeat 

the process with the other memory module. You can also exchange the slots. The 

128 MB stick should be installed in Bank 0 and the 64 MB in Bank 1. If that does 

not solve your problem, check the CPU fan. Observe if it is running with occasional 

increase or decrease in speed. If so, change the CPU fan.

As for your query concerning RAM speed, the only way 

to ascertain the memory speed is to cross-reference the memory part number with 

the manufacturer?s catalogue.

Sujit Roy: I am planning to instal Fedora Core 

release 1. Is it as versatile as Windows 98? What are its drawbacks?

TechTalk: The Fedora Project is a community-supported 

Open Source project sponsored by Red Hat. Development is open to anyone, although 

the Red Hat engineering team oversees the development. The goal is to work with 

the Linux community to build a complete, general purpose OS exclusively from free 

software. It is not a Red Hat supported product, but acts as a test bed for new 

features that may be integrated into Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The Fedora Project officially ended support for Fedora 

Core 1 (FC1) on September 20, 2004. Fedora Legacy has now picked up support for 

FC1.

The latest version is Fedora Core 3 (FC3). As for 

versatility, you can perform most tasks with the ease of Windows. But, if you 

want a Linux solution for a robust and stable OS, go for a distribution that is 

vendor-supported. Fedora is a development platform and a public forum. So, users 

are encouraged to participate in the process of overcoming the drawbacks and not 

complain about them!

Nilanjan Bhattacharya: My Yahoo! mail cannot 

retain the password or user ID even though I ticked the ?Remember my ID on this 

computer? box. I use Windows XP Professional. Also, does defragmenting off and 

on adversely affect the longevity of the hard disk?

TechTalk: When you sign into your Yahoo! mail 

account, your browser can remember your ID and password if you check the ?Remember 

my ID on this computer? box. But if you sign out of Yahoo!?s personalised account 

by clicking the ?Sign Out? link, you have to re-enter your ID and password the 

next time you access mail. This is done for security reasons and there is nothing 

wrong with your PC. Your browser?s security level should be set to ?Medium-High? 

off and on doesnt affect the health or longevity of the hard disk. In fact, 

regular defragmenting boosts system performance.

Dibendu Dutta: I bought a PC recently with 

Celeron 2 GHz processor, 40 GB HDD, 128 MB DDR RAM, Windows 98 and Sony floppy 

drive. Since last week the floppy drive is not reading any floppy. It says the 

floppy is unusable even in case of new disks.

TechTalk: Check your computer for virus. Some, 

such as Stealth_C or Form virus can cause read/write problems on your floppy drive. 

If your computer is virus-free, the floppy drive may be malfunctioning. Use a 

head cleaning diskette (60 per cent of all floppy drive problems are caused by 

dirty heads) for a thorough cleanup of read/write heads. Caution: don?t run the 

drive with a head-cleaning disk inserted for more than 30 second at a time, or 

you risk damaging the heads. Another cause may be misalignment. If the drive gets 

tilted even slightly, the read/Write heads go out of alignment from the tracks. 

To check this, you have to open the cabinet and readjust the floppy drive by loosening 

and tightening the screws. 

There may also be broken parts or obstructions jamming 

the heads, and finally the drive might have gone kaput. But don?t try to verify 

these yourself. Sony has one year warranty on floppy drives. Contact the nearest 

Sony service centre.

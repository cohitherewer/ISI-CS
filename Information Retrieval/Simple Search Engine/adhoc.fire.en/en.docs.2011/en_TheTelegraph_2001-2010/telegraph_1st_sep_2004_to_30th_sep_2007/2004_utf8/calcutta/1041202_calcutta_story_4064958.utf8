 Bard?s midsummer dream on the lawn

 If you amble past the lawns of Loreto House in the afternoon, do not jump if you hear a growl close by. Chances are it is Amrita Dhar Roy, a student, rehearsing her role of a lion in A Midsummer Night?s Dream. The play will be part of the World Shakespeare Conference, starting on Saturday. 

 ?We are here even on Sundays since god knows how many weeks now,? say the college girls, waiting for their cue in lehengas and cholis on the greens, which would be their stage on November 6, before an encore at the American Center on November 8. 

 The show promises to be a colourful cross-cultural experience, embellished with Indian music and dance. ?The setting is Mathura. Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, are in the mould of Krishna and Radha. They will be dressed in costumes and crown befitting Indian royalty,? explains director of the play Brian Russo, a Fulbright scholar, who has been working with the cast since the Pujas.

 The members are drawn from across departments ? history, political science, communicative English, education? Two key actors are from Rabindra Bharati University. ?I had done a Bengali theatre workshop there. The boys are so good that I wanted them in my English project,? says Russo, pointing to Subhendu Sarkar, a confident Oberon, and Utpal Mukherjee, squealing in a falsetto. (?I am Thisbe, a female character, who will be in a sari,? he explains later.)

 Russo, who teaches at Franklin-Marshall College in Pennsylvania, is happy with the setting of the play. ?Calcutta should have more plays out in the open. The Maidan should be ideal in winter,? he proposes, walking barefoot on the lawn.

 The US, he points out, has a tradition of Shakespeare in the park. ?The atmosphere is like a picnic. People bring over food, a bottle of wine, blanket and pillow. It?s a perfect family outing in summer after sundown,? he says, talking of the numerous productions at Long?s Park ?back home?.

 The play will not be the only open-air affair at the conference. A Shakespeare walk, with Elizabethan costumes, masks, lights, music and recitation, will start off the proceedings on Saturday afternoon. Off the block from Nandan, it will snake its way to Shakespeare Sarani to garland the Bard?s statue. On Sunday morning, the conference will be inaugurated in presence of defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and state education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty. The afternoon will see Aparna Sen, along with Amitava Ray and Rukmini Roy Basu, lend voice to Eastwords, a novel based on Shakespeare, by her husband Dr Kalyan Ray of University of New Jersey. On Tuesday, the Shakespeare choir will perform, followed by scenes from Macbeth through Indian classical dance.

 Meanwhile, Russo is busy polishing his Midsummer Night?s Dream. The costumes have arrived but Philostrate is still going a tad too fast with her lines and Moonshine forgetting hers. ?We will be fine on stage,? the girls promise. The college exams are in January. With rehearsals hitting a high, no one is sure about that though. ?This production tops our priority now,? states stage manager Mansi Goenka.

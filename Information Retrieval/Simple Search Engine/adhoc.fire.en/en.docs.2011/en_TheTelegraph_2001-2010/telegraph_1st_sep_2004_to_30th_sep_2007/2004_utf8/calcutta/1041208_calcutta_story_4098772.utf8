The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bias cry on campus sets off probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University will conduct an inquiry into allegations that a section of challenged employees (including teachers) and students are being discriminated against. 

 What prompted the move was a written complaint from a visually-challenged lecturer that he was being ?exploited? and ?harassed? by the governing body of his college.

 The university?s undergraduate council discussed the issue on Thursday, the eve of World Disabled Day. ?We were shocked to receive this kind of complaint from a teacher,? pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das said on Sunday.

 ?In keeping with the state government?s policy towards the disabled, we are determined to ensure that not a single teacher faces harassment because of his/her disability. The matter will be dealt with firmly,? he asserted. 

 The university has set up a committee to probe the charges of the teacher of Vivekananda Girls? College, Behala. The team will visit the college on December 9.

 In his letter to the pro vice-chancellor (academic), the lecturer alleged that he had been denied the facilities under the University Grants Commission?s career advancement scheme. Citing rules, he wrote that a lecturer can be promoted to senior lecturer on a recommendation from the governing body of the college. 

 In his case, the recommendation was being ?unnecessarily delayed?.

 The authorities have decided to issue circulars to all departments and colleges, so rules are followed strictly on granting relaxation to disabled students and employees.

 The university has been receiving complaints regularly, not just from disabled employees, but also from challenged students and their parents.

 Sources said the guardians of challenged students have detailed how their wards are being victimised because of the discriminatory attitude of a section of employees.

 The most common allegation is that challenged examinees are ?harassed? when they, or their parents, approach officials for permission to use a writer or a typewriter during exams.

 The mother of a physically-challenged examinee has complained that her son, a student of a south Calcutta college, had failed twice in a paper in B.Com Part I. Her pleas for a special review of the answer-script have gone unheeded.

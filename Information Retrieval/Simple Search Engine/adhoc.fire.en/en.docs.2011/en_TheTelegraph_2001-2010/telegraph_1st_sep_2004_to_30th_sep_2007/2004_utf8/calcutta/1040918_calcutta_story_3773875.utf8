The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Fast forward on the floor

Eye on Calcutta

Barry O ?Brien

The call of action at the city studios triggers off 

work at a pace as fast as anywhere else, contrary to shop talk

Mothers have their own mantras! If each could have 

a copyright, there would be as many magic mantras in this world as there are mothers 

? for each is unique and original. One of my mother?s ?original? mantras goes 

like this ? ?Beta, believe half of what you see and nothing of what you 

hear!? 

?Nothing of what you hear? was fine by me, but why 

?half of what you see?? She always had her stock story. It?s from the days when 

she was young and attractive and my father was young and busy. My father got a 

call from a friend saying that his young and attractive wife was having an affair 

with a younger man. ?Are you sure?? was my father?s casual response. ?Neil, I 

can see them right now. She is holding his hand and crossing the street. It?s 

happening in front of my eyes!? ?Is he a short fellow in grey trousers and a check 

shirt?? ?Yes! How do you know?? ?He?s my cousin and they had lunch with me half-an-hour 

ago!?

For me, seeing, therefore, is not believing! The other 

day in C3, Calcutta?s most happening super market, there were hardly a couple 

of us doing our weekly shopping. I saw but didn?t believe! I later found out that 

between the two outlets, on Elgin Road and at City Centre, they are doing a six-figure 

turnover a day. 

For me, hearing is certainly not believing! For years 

we?ve been told, ?Never shoot in Cal! These Tolly technicians have no work culture! 

You won?t do more than two episodes a day!? So, over the years, we shot only in 

Delhi or Mumbai. Recently though, we had no choice, because the channel (Zee Alpha 

Bangla) and the producers (Tron) of our new programme, Syllabus Barry Sirer 

Sathe, finalised that it would be shot here in Calcutta. 

We braced ourselves to experience all that we had 

heard: no one respects time here; poor work culture; uncomfortable studio floors 

etc. etc. We?ve recently completed the shooting and my mother?s mantra has hit 

the bullseye yet again. Believe nothing of what you hear! 

We zipped through four episodes a day and packed up 

as early as six every evening. The studio we shot the show at ? Roopkala Kendra, 

Salt Lake ? is a joint venture between the state government and the government 

of Italy and is technically as equipped as any studio we have shot in and far 

more comfortable. The atmosphere was wonderful, the technicians extremely professional 

and the end result very satisfying. 

I?m told Mir and his friends shoot as many as six 

episodes of Hau Mau Khau a day and feature films are sometimes wrapped 

up in a fortnight. I don?t follow any of the serials being churned out, but judging 

by the fan following of friends of mine, they are obviously hitting the bullseye 

more often than not. Arindam Sil, walking beside me at a rally recently, had daughters, 

mothers and grandmothers waving to him; Arjun Chakraborty was mobbed by schoolchildren 

at a function. 

The truth is that Tollywood is alive and isn?t restricted 

to Tollygunge any more. They shoot at studios all over the city, in bagan baadis, 

bhada baadis, school campuses and just about anywhere else. Today, in the 

city, dozens of TV serials and game shows are being shot every day, while the 

number of films each year is showing an upward trend. 

But, more encouraging is the sense of humour and nostalgia 

that still encompasses Tollywood. Everyone from spot boy to make-up man has a 

story to tell or make up. Balaida, who times his tea-breaks to the tee, 

told me all about his relationship with Satyajit Ray whom he worked with in every 

film from Pather Panchali in 1955 to Agantuk in 1991. With a smile 

as warm as the tea he served, he told me about his most memorable movie moment: 

serving the master several cups of tea as he lent his voice to his Bhuter Raja 

in Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. There were others, too, who let out secrets of 

many a big director who left his slippers outside the leading lady?s make-up room. 

The footwear was actually a euphemism for ?do not disturb?, only because the director 

was going over the script with her. Nothing else! 

The man they spoke most about was the ?dresser? Bishuda. 

He knows it all; though he hasn?t ?seen? it all. They say he used to stand guard 

at the make-up room door while the biggest matinee idols were ?busy? inside. Bishuda 

put on a lot of weight because he would have to finish the untouched lunches sent 

with love to the greatest of them all, Uttam Kumar. Apparently, the star would 

be sent at least three different lunches and in order to keep all three ?senders? 

happy, he would ask Bishuda to polish off the contents and tell the respective 

carriers, ?Uttambabu boleychhen, rannata khub bhalo hoyechhey?. 

Our make-up man, too, shared with us an Uttam Kumar-original. 

He asked my co-host Biswanath Dasgupta and me: ?Gaal ta kee ektu ketey debo?? 

We were wondering why he wanted to chop off our cheeks! He clarified, that since 

the time of guru Uttam, many male leads requested their make-up men to 

cut their ?gaals? a little or put a shadow under the jaw to hide the double 

chin. 

Then there are the sad stories too. A spot boy told 

me about two of his uncles who committed suicide in the seventies after going 

365 consecutive days without a single day?s work. Now, with the TV boom, there?s 

plenty of work around, but, unfortunately, not good enough facilities. The studio 

we worked in and a few other private studios apart, even clean toilets and air-conditioning 

are ?luxuries? most producers feel are unnecessary. Three special toilets were 

constructed before Shyam Benegal?s Netaji got underway and an air-conditioner 

was installed for Aishwarya Rai?s make-up room and removed as soon as Chokher 

Bali was completed. 

Let?s hope the chief minister?s grant to Technicians 

Studio and the initiative taken by individuals like Tejash Doshi, who is renovating 

Indrapuri, will improve things. Till then, those who work in the old studios ? 

the ones falling apart ? will have to keep their ?enthu? going in the make-up 

room, apparently the centre point of PNPC ? Paroninda parocharcha. The 

adda sessions get better by the day. While the story of how Utpal Dutt 

regularly ate beef and parathas for lunch, is a bit outdated, the one about 

the evergreen Soumitra Chatterjee?s elastic flair and command over the language, 

be it intellectual poetry or hardcore flowery stuff, is now top of the pops. 

For us, shooting was satisfying but the in-betweens 

more fun. It was then that we felt the presence of the greats ? Satyajit Ray, 

Uttam Kumar, Utpal Dutt and Soumitra Chatterjee. Working with people who knew 

them from close quarters is something we will cherish for years to come.

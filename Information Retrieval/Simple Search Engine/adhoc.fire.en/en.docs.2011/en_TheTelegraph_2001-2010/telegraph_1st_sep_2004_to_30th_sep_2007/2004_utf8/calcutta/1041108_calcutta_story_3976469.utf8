After 

over a year of selling from top boutiques in Calcutta, Mumbai and Delhi like Kali, 

Ogaan and Purple Porcupine, Gauri Bajoria has finally opened her own outfit, Gauri. 

 The mood at the Alipore Road address where Gauri is showcasing her range of Indian, western and fusion wear is festive and the palette bright, contrasting the minimalistic studio d?cor that exudes a fun and crazy look. 

 The collection of jackets ? long and short, skirts ? A-line, straight and fitted ? kurtas, formal shirts and saris flaunt a generous amount of gold highlights. Needless to say, most of the outfits fit the evening and party wear purpose. 

 Ones sold on casual chic also have an interesting range of ?urban gypsy? mix--match style to choose from. ?I have tried to give the clothes a sense of faded richness, a look that perfectly balances sophisticated construction with a mix of old destroyed surfaces,? explained Gauri. 

 Silks and dupions are among the primary fabrics used with a lot of patchwork to match the otherwise non-embellished look of the garments.

 Address: Gauri, 24/5 Alipore Road, Calcutta 700027. Ph: 33027506. Timings: 11 am to 6 pm.

 Swing set

 The autumn night was young even as ageless songs carried into the balmy air across the lush rolling greens of Tolly Club this Saturday.

 Stars of the swinging sixties and still swaying strong, Pam Crain, Usha Uthup and Anjum Katyal shared the stage to rock ?Hello Tolly ? Ageless and Evergreen? night organised in association with Spandan.

 The Far Pavilion reverberated with songs like How Will I Do It and Dear Daddy by Usha along with other jazz and blues strains by Pam and Anjum.

 It?s sure been a long journey for Usha, who?s spirited songs used to regale the swish set at Trincas when Park Street used to be the party hub Calcutta liked to groove at. And Pam could be heard at the neighbouring Blue Fox. 

 Cut to the present and they are still the rage amid music aficionados. ?The more you give Calcutta, the more it wants,? summed up Usha.

 Brew bash

 Coffee and insomnia may not be the best of friends but Friday night was different. 

 An unplugged performance by young college band Insomnia at Caffeine on Elgin Road was how the young and trendy chose to start their weekend. 

 Influenced by Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Doors and Nirvana among others, the band belted out a select repertoire from their self-produced debut English album Cry of the Spirit. Songs like Reach Out, Nirvana and the title track Cry of the Spirit sent out an underlying message for the youth to break free from the pressures of modern living.

 For the moment, the revolution translated into little more than the changing face of coffee culture in the city. 

 Rajdeep Ghosal, owner of the Elgin Road address, said it all: ?By and by I would like to turn the coffee shop into a cultural hub. It?s important to offer variety to make the young and trendy stick on.? Ghosal promised more unplugged performances in the future by many more musicians and bands. Looks like quite a storm brewing in the cuppa here!

 Desi dig

 If the idea is to have a relaxed dinner out with friends and family in an ambience that?s classy and with a platter that?s delectable, The Restaurant, On the First Floor, at Purna Das Road (near the Gol Park petrol pump), could well be the newest option available. 

 ?We will try to give the guest and his family a total experience that will encompass well-cooked luxurious food, pampered service and exclusive ambience,? promised Sanchayita Bhattacharya of the restaurant. 

 Ambience and service apart, the Indian platter is the proposed USP of the 2,500-sq-ft eatery that will be open only for dinner through the week and lunch and dinner on Sundays. 

 ?We would like to be known for meticulous attention to detail. We might marinate the fish for 48 hours if a dish calls for it,? said chef Somnath Bhattacharjee. 

 Interesting innovations include a range of light starters. ?We are using Indian spices for the popular starters like crispy chilli baby corn, or drums of heaven,? he elaborated. 

 To refresh one?s taste buds between courses, Indian palate cleansers like a shorba will be offered to the guests.

 And children won?t be forgotten either. ?Cooking them a customised meal will be a starting point,? offered the chef. 

 A celebration table that occupies the centre of the restaurant is meant for special occasions and anyone who books it will be offered a special menu in advance to complete a joyous evening.

 Multi choice

 A new menu is the festive offer from the multi-cuisine restaurant Tangerine on Outram Street. 

 While the array is vast, we bring you a sample of the old and the new to power your dining experience.

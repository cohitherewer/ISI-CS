 It's Your Birthday So...

 Inventions and creative talent impress you. You 

will dabble in religion or philosophy. Even the smallest setbacks can faze you. 

You have your own way of resolving problems. Socialising is an essential part 

of your life. Be helpful, but dont get exploited by others. ? Kusum Bhandari

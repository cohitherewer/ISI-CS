 They have their own theatre group and write their own scripts. They act their own roles and are adept at improvising on their own on stage. They are young adults who know their own minds and are trying to fight their own battles. 

 Jija, Sumita, Raja, Srabonti, Debbie, Bharati and Sayom Deb of Ankur ? the theatre platform of the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP) ? have been on a roll the past year, taking their maiden production, Amader Katha, to venues beyond the walls of their Taratala institute.

 ?Our group, Ankur, was formed in November 2003 and since then, we have had many shows at various places,? says Jija, coordinator of Ankur. 

 A former student of IICP herself, Jija adds: ?From Sisir Mancha to Gyan Manch, Motijheel in Dum Dum and other places, we have had an interested audience at each venue. Acting and interacting with the crowd, we have had an amazing time.?

 Sumita, part of the cast, explains: ?It is impossible for people to understand our pain and hurt. From comments by relatives and neighbours to harassment on public transport and at other places, society?s attitude towards us has always been rather cruel.?

 A former IICP student, Sumita, who from her wheelchair heads the catering training unit there, adds: ?We had realised that mere talking to people to raise awareness will not work. Theatre, on the other hand, is an art form which easily attracts an audience. And we have reined in that potential of theatre to spread awareness.?

 That their technique has been successful finds proof in the case of a little boy whose mother was present at Ankur?s Motijheel show. Srabonti, 16, who wheels Sumita around, says, ?His mother had lost all hope in her disabled son. But when we talked about our own problems, in our own words in Amader Katha, she was moved and brought her son to the institute, where he is now undergoing therapy.?

 According to Jija, the group tries to modify the play according to the needs of the audience they plan to address at the show. ?Our main idea is to get the message across, and for that we try to keep the idea very simple. We use a maximum of 12 people in the cast and try to keep it flexible, so that actors can be filled in by others during exams or other emergencies,? she adds.

 Later, as the rest of the group gathers on the terrace to chat about the acting workshops, body movement training sessions and rehearsals, Bhaskar, Debbie and others turn to Barsha. ?She can?t talk but she is a good poet and our main ideator,? says Sumita. 

 They laugh, share jokes and relive Shah Rukh Khan numbers on their way to shows. But for now, Ankur members are busy planning their new scripts. ?There are so many ideas? lets hope it all works out?,? wishes Jija.

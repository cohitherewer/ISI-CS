The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Glamour grips up for grabs

Purses come handy when youre out 

to make a fashion statement on almost every occasion. Ipsita Deb does a

What you wear can never be complete without the right 

accessories. When it comes to handbags and purses, there?s a fashion statement 

to be made for every occasion, whether you?re heading out for a movie, going to 

a high-society do or sending the right signals at a friend?s wedding. Be it designer 

bags, totes, clutches, purses? a woman can, quite simply, never leave home without 

one. Here?s a look at some of the styles that one can flaunt on various occasions.

Trendy totes

Some women prefer to carry a lot, and nothing but 

the most practical bag will do. The bag ends up serving as a portable office desk, 

dressing table and library. But utility doesn?t exclude looks.

The aspirational name available on the Calcutta market 

is Hidesign. Excellent quality often comes with an equally formidable price tag 

here, but if a larger bag is your thing, this label ? available at the standalone 

store at Forum or at multi-brand outlets like Shoppers? Stop ? is a great bet 

in pure leather.

Stop by Options in Metro Plaza and you?ll find yourself 

with plenty of hold-alls to pick from, ranging from pinks, reds and oranges to 

more standard shades of grey and brown. If interesting shapes and sizes is your 

thing, the store holds squares, ovals, circular and even triangular designs. The 

fabrics include cottons, suede and leather. The prices range from Rs 250 to Rs 

650.

Nik Nish at 22, Camac Street and Forum, is another 

haunt where quality and a variety of styles is guaranteed. Shelved according to 

colour, attractive styles come in different sizes and shades to suit your needs. 

The most popular buys here are the denims in blue, black and even red. The prices 

vary between Rs 200 and Rs 1,500.

Ornate effect

Precious little evening bags with just enough room 

for keys, lipstick and money are the things to flaunt at parties. At 1 Allenby 

(opposite Forum), a range of exclusive glam-power bags in an assortment of colours, 

with arty effects and stylish handles can be found. Vivid colours and bold forms 

are prevalent as is the vintage charm. The bags here are embellished with flowers, 

butterflies, beads and metallic shapes. Colourful patchwork, tassels and embroidery 

enhance each bag and the most popular fabric here is raw silk. 

?The vintage effect is in right now, as is the shape 

and material of the handles. The bags here are styled to suit any person?s tastes 

and colour palette,? says Usha Bagri, city-based designer and owner of the store. 

Handles are decorative ? studded with stones, silver 

and beads, on bamboo or wood. Other hardware details such as buckles, rings or 

snaps have also been paired here in different styles. Priced between Rs 600 and 

Rs 1,400, these are must-buys to enhance the chic factor of your wardrobe.

At BE:, you can find chic counterparts in jute in 

an entirely different avatar with sequins, embroidery and wooden handles being 

the main focus. Designed by Malaga, these bags are larger than usual evening purses 

and are priced at Rs 1,495.

Wristy clutches

The tiny wristlet bags are streamlined in shape, have 

an attached wrist loop and are easy to carry. For the club-party animals, appropriate 

colours and textures can be found, while the more sedate dinner-party type can 

opt for a less glitzy more chic statement. Pink, Rinaldi and Priyadarshini Rao 

have a diverse range of these bags, and you can find their creations at BE:.

The clutch is another evening essential that is often 

treated like a piece of jewellery. At 1, Allenby, small clutches in metallic, 

textured or decorated styles can be found. 

The beaded straps or snaps with a dramatic, oversized 

jewel, in the shape of a butterfly or other vintage-look brooches are the highlight 

of these bags.

Luxury leather

Want a classic, wear-with-everything handbag, but 

one that packs a fashion punch? A classic style with revved up colour and texture 

is the ideal accessory. ?The season has heralded bright colours like lilac, hot 

pink, jade, orange or yellow,? says Andaleeb Hashmi of Leatherworld (Metro Plaza 

and Theatre Road).

The leather can be textured to create the silky soft 

or sturdy feel. The store also holds a range of Italian leather products with 

crocodile or lizard-scale finish. Priced upwards of Rs 400, these are very economical 

and guaranteed to last.

Hidesign in Forum also has a range of sleek textured 

leather bags in different shapes and sizes. While these do tend to be more sober 

in style, the finish and cut is exceptional. A Rs 1,000-budget can fetch you a 

smart bag.

If bargain buys are more your style, head for New 

Market. Santiniketan leather bags and accessories are in, and if you look hard 

enough, you are likely to find one with a decent finish for a fraction of the 

price.

Bridal beauties

With the bridal season in full swing, juttis 

are the perfect accessory. Ritu Kumar boasts a gorgeous range of embroidered juttis 

in dull shades of pink, neutral colours and some dark shades. Handcrafted to perfection, 

these classic pieces look elegant and complete any bridal ensemble in style.

For a more trendy look, BE: has a range of eye-catching 

Indo-western sequinned bags in turquoise, pink and red.

?The in-thing right now for the bridal season is lots 

of mirror-work and velvet embellished with semi-precious stones. People are flocking 

here to grab them as they complement lehngas and saris perfectly,? says 

Simanti Nair of Taj Khazana. But be prepared to pay a notch higher than intended, 

with the tag ranging from Rs 1,650 to Rs 4,200. Sequinned and kantha options 

are ?equally ornate? and come for Rs 336 to Rs 1,800.

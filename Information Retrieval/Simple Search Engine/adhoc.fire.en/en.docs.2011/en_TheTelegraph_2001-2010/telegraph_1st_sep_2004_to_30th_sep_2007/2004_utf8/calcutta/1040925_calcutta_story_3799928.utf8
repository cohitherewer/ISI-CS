The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Right for some, others cry rights

 - Political rally ban breather for Brigade ruffles party feathers

 A STAFF REPORTER

(From top) Biswas, Ghosh, Mukherjee, Nayana 

 Think Brigade Parade Grounds and you think mahamichhil and mess. Not any more.

 With Calcutta High Court all but banishing political rallies from the city?s favourite green, the Brigade could have finally won a breather that matters. The directive from the division bench of acting Chief Justice A.N. Roy and Justice A.K. Mitra, delivered on Friday afternoon, swiftly became the talking point in political organisations of every hue. 

Ashok Ghosh, Forward Bloc state secretary: 

I think the order goes against the democratic right of the people. We have always 

organised rallies on the Brigade only after obtaining permission from the army, 

police and even the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). Now, the court tells 

us that we will not be able to hold any rally on the Brigade. We may have to consider 

moving a higher court.

Manju Kumar Majumder, CPI state secretary: 

I cannot make any sense of this order. After all, we do not hold rallies every 

day on the Brigade. We have not ever held a rally there without army permission. 

My party will decide on the future course of action after going through the order.

Anil Biswas, CPM state secretary: It is an 

interim order which we will respect. Any political party has to seek permission 

from the army for organising a rally on the Brigade. We have always sought the 

army?s permission and will continue to do so.

Subrata Mukherjee, mayor: This order is interesting. 

It does not say where a rally will be held if it is to be addressed by a Prime 

Minister, who is also the leader of a political party. Also, if the court imposes 

it on us, I see no reason why I should not operate an identical order on Calcutta?s 

parks, which my civic body owns. If the court wants people to go to Midnapore 

to air their grievances, so be it.

Nayana Bandopadhyay, Trinamul Congress MLA: 

All parties should sit together to work out a strategy on how we can go about 

organising political rallies if they are not allowed on the Brigade. In the event 

of the Brigade being unavailable, we must either have an alternative or urge the 

court for a rethink.

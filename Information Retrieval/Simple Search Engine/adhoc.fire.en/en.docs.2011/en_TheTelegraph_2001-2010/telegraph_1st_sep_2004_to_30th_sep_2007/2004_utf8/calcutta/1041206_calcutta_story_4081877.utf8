 Film fun with animated adventures

Nisha Lahiri

It?s getting colder, and although the warm clothes are out, the little ones are prone to catching a chill. So mommies may feel the best bet is to keep them indoors. In case you are in search of ideas about how to keep them happy (and out of your hair), look only as far as a video rental store or DVD shop. Watching a film with your toddler is a relaxing and fun pastime for both you and your child. And there?s plenty on offer this month.

 There are movies galore worth catching with the young ones in December, on big and small screen. Here is a list of titles with their favourite cartoon characters and plenty of new ones to fuel hyperactive imaginations.

Barney

 The loveable dinosaur is invading the telly, via HBO. It all begins when nine-year-old Cody Newton, his little sister Abby and her best friend Marcell go on an adventurous holiday to their grandparents? farm. Cody isn?t happy with no cable TV, stuck with two toddlers and a purple dino named Barney. He hides the toy, but the girls manage to turn him into a walking, talking, singing, six-ft-tall dinosaur, leaving Cody stumped. 

 They find a mysterious egg, which then goes missing. So begins the adventure, through an aviary, parade, restaurant and circus. Join Barney, BJ, Baby Bop and the rest of the gang in their search.

Garfield

 A fat, lazy, cat and a dim-witted, loveable, affectionate dog. Throw in a pet-owner who is completely clueless, and you have a chaotic tale of animals and humans. Most adults have grown up with a Garfield who?s not exactly kiddie fare. But this big-screen version is a children?s delight. Catch it at 89 Cinemas. A warning: Garfield: The Movie is not really for adults and the orange feline is the only animated thing about it.

Little 2 

Ice Age 

 This is a classic tale of heroes and villains that toddlers (and you) are sure to love. The 3D animated film is about a rather unlikely band of four animals who come together during the ice age some 20,000 years ago in order to reunite a lost baby boy with his family. 

 Running from glaciers and escaping lava pits and evil plots, the fast-talking but dim sloth Sid, moody mammoth Manny, devilish sabre-toothed tiger Diego and the acorn-crazy squirrel Scrat earnestly pursue their quest. 

 Catch the antics of these ?sub-zero heroes? on STAR Movies. It?s a laugh riot with enough action to keep the little ones glued. 

Shark Tale 

 This one?s sure to entertain both adults and children. The Godfatheresque smooth-talking will make an impression on parents, while the wonders of the underwater world will fascinate babies. 

Oscar, a little fish, suddenly becomes famous. And 

Lenny, a big shark, is turned into an outcast because he?s basically too nice 

to be a shark. Song sequences in the whale wash and adventures through the dark 

alleys are definite winners with the youngsters. Catch it at INOX and 89 Cinemas. 

It?ll stick around for another week, at least. 

Stuart Little 

 Based on the book by E.B. White with a screenplay by M. Night Shyamalan, this film is about a preppy white mouse. The Littles adopts a brother for their son George ? a spunky rodent named Stuart, voiced by the pint-sized Michael J. Fox. But the tiny fella runs into more trouble than he bargained for when family cat Snowbell plots to get rid of him. To add to his woes, George (played by the adorable Jonathan Lipnicki seen in Jerry Maguire) is not happy with a mouse as his sibling. Determined to win their affection, Stuart embarks on a series of adventures. To be spotted on STAR Movies.

Stuart Little 2 

 Here?s a rare opportunity to watch the sequel right after the first installment, this time on HBO.

Stuart now drives a fancy car and is on the soccer 

team, but he needs a friend who?s like him. Then, a bird named Margalo falls into 

his lap. When his new friend goes missing, he sets out after crime lord Falcon, 

with help from his erstwhile enemy Snowbell.

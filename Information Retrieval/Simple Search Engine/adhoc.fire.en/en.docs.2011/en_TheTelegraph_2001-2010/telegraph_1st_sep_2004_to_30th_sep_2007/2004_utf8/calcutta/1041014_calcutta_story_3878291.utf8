The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Brew amp; bite while on the move

 You?re 

on the move constantly. You?d love to grab a bite (and sip) on the go, but hygiene 

and affordability are major concerns. Coffee Day Xpress plans to cater to this 

growing segment and meet the demand from executives and youngsters on the run.

 The national coffee chain has expansion plans lined up for the city. ?The Xpress kiosks have been doing very well in all the southern states and other metros,? said Sandip Mukherjee, president, Coffee Day Xpress, at the unveiling of the chain?s 10th kiosk in the city at Forum. ?It?s now time to make it big in Calcutta.?

 Affordability is a key-factor at the ?no-frills? outlets. Unlike coffee shops or cafes, the emphasis is on fresh, quality food at low prices. On offer are bakery items and hot and cold beverages priced Rs 5 upwards.

 Motivated by Starbucks? success in the US, Coffee 

Day Xpress is setting up kiosks at airports and railway stations, movie theatres, 

shopping malls, educational institutions, petrol pumps and corporate locations.

 In the city, corporate offices like Hutch and ITC, malls such as Landmark and Shoppers? Stop, educational institutes including IIM Calcutta and the multiplex INOX have already tasted the brew of convenience.

At present, the chain has 194 outlets in nine cities, 

which is expected to jump to 300 by March 2005. The Calcutta figure is set to 

reach 16 in the same period.

 ?We are trying to encourage entrepreneurship through our franchise model,? Mukherjee explained. 

 ?Out of the 194 kiosks, 150 are franchises with some run by housewives and retired people.? The chain promises profit from the first month itself, requiring a refundable deposit of Rs 2.5 to Rs 3 lakh from prospective owners.

 ?In every city, we start with self-owned kiosks and demonstrate that franchise is a profitable venture,? Mukherjee added.

 The Pujas would also see Coffee Day Xpress tie up with major Pujas like Singhi Park.

Canvas call

 The cork board set up on one of the walls outside Landmark may seem inconspicuous at first, but the five ft-by-six ft display might soon be a turning point in the lives of young painters.

 Titled Art Corner, this tiny place will help showcase paintings of budding artists. ?For one week every month, we will be displaying works of a young painter, to be chosen by us. The painter can sell his paintings to customers directly as his contact details will be mentioned on the board,? said Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark. Painter Wasim Kapur?s help will be taken to shortlist the candidates whose works will be displayed.

 To support the cause of young painters, actress Moon Moon Sen dropped by for the inauguration.

 The corner was opened with Hena Kapoor?s works on acrylic board with acrylic paint.

 Hair hues

 For those set to spice up their lives this festive season, Garnier Nutrisse has come up with a winning formula. The hair care products company, launched Spicy Red ? the colour of the season ? in the city on Tuesday evening at Winning Streak in an event held in association with Sananda.

 The colour code of the evening that began with red soon encompassed the vibrant festive colours of orange and pink as leading models including Candice Pinto and Aanchal Kumar walked down the makeshift ramp in Mona Pali creations, sporting the new hair hues.

 Soon, the ramp queens made way for the aspiring glam dolls as six of Calcutta?s young models took the stage in lovely lehngas, competing to win the crown of Miss Garnier Nutrisse Spicy Reds Queen. As the packed venue resounded with applause, the tension among the young girls, most of whom confessed to ?being on the ramp for the first time?, was evident.

 Scored on walk, poise and looks, the judges took three rounds to crown the winner. VJ Anoushka managed to ease the uneasiness among the freshers along with chief guest for the evening actress June, as the duo asked simple questions. Each girl did her beauty-pageant best. ?It?s a great experience being here, winning is not important,? was the universal sentiment.

 Finally, there was a tie between Parama Pramanik and Priyanka Kohli as winners for the evening, so one sported the crown while the other made do with the sash. Make-up artist Prabir De, model coordinator Sanchita Kushari Bose, dancer Madhubani Chatterjee and lensman Sanat Ghosh were the judges for the evening.

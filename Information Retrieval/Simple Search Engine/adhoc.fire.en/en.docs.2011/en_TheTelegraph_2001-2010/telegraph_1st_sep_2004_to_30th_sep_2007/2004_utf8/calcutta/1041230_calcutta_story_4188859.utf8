 CU sets code on syllabi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 To improve the performance of its students in competitive examinations, Calcutta University (CU) has decided to initiate a drive to ensure that teachers do not omit portions of the undergraduate syllabus.

 ?We are concerned that many graduates from the university are not faring well in the competitive examinations,? said Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor (academic) on Wednesday.

 ?One of the reasons behind the failure is that they are not taught the full syllabi at the undergraduate level,? Das added. 

 He said a guideline is being prepared according to models followed by international universities to ensure that the entire syllabus for the 40 subjects offered at the undergraduate level is taught to students every year. The guideline will be circulated among colleges affiliated to the university. 

 According to officials, questions are generally not repeated in the university examinations, and taking advantage of that, students skip topics while preparing for tests. 

 After conducting a college-wise inspection, CU found that it was not just the students who were taking advantage of the system: a large section of teachers were also skipping topics on the same pretext.

 ?It would be unfair to suddenly change the system and start setting questions covering the entire syllabi. Before we do that, we have to ensure that teachers teach the whole syllabi to every batch every year,? Das said.

 The guidelines that are being prepared will contain instructions to students and teachers, and will be sold in the form of booklets to the students. The prices will be between Re 1 and Rs 3.

 Hope lost, energy spent, trial drags

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND SANJAY MANDAL 

 Manoj Patel: Father bereft 

 Fifteen months after 17-year-old Rajnis Patel died at SSKM Hospital, all that the parents of the budding cricketer are left with is a volley of questions from defence lawyers.

 Manoj and Munni Patel, the remaining residents of the Bhowanipore home that once cradled the dream of a young sportsman, stand bereft of all hope. On June 2, 2003, they lost their son to a minor leg injury. 

 What energy they have left is spent at the Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s (SDJM) court, where the medical negligence hearing against five doctors of the state-run hospital is in progress.

 ?There is nothing more to discuss,? sighed Rajnis? father, who used to own a barber?s shop nearby. 

 ?I have lost interest in everything? I have given my shop to someone on lease.? They now live on the Rs 3,000 they receive as rent from the shop.

 ?That is enough for us. We live simply. What is the point in cooking special food any more?? asked Rajnis? mother.

 Manoj keeps busy in court. Before, the parents kept busy planning their son?s cricket career. Mother Munni used to accompany Rajnis to all his city matches. ?Now, I pass the time with only my memories,? she lamented.

 The young man played for Aurora Athletics Association in 2000, and then spent two years with Balak Sangha, playing Cricket Association of Bengal second division matches. He was set for first division registration, too.

 Rajnis had travelled around the country to take part in various tournaments, and was getting ready for his first stint in England to play Minor County when tragedy struck. ?His passport was ready. But it all came to an abrupt end,? said Manoj.

 On Monday, defence lawyers argued before the Alipore SDJM court that Rajnis? death was not a case of medical negligence.

 Defence counsel Amitava Ganguly and Dipit Bose asked Manoj whether he had appeared before the inquiry committee set up by hospital authorities. Manoj said he had not appeared before it as he had been performing his son?s religious rites. Instead, he had sent his friend B.M. Bhatt to meet the committee.

 The counsel also asked him if he had sent the X-ray plate, metal rods and clamps used on Rajnis? leg during the operation to the commission. 

 Manoj replied that he had only sent the X-ray plate.

 SDJM Manjit Singh adjourned the hearing till September 29.

 JU opens doors to foreign students

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Students from the developed countries coming all the way to study in a state-aided university in Calcutta. A distant dream? 

 It?s set to become a reality, with Jadavpur University ready to admit students from abroad to all its under-graduate and post-graduate courses from the next academic session, beginning July 2005.

 The 50-year-old university, that has produced graduates and post-graduates working in almost every well-known institution across the world, has, for the first time, decided to raise by five per cent the number of its seats in all streams ? engineering and technology, science and arts ? to admit foreign students.

 ?Our university has recently earned a name for itself through high rating by various national-level government agencies. Now, we intend to open the doors of our institution to the foreign market, so that it can get exposed as a brand by itself,? said Manoj Mitra, dean of the science and technology faculty, on Monday. 

 For instance, he said, ?we want meritorious students from all over the world to be lured by the high standards of our courses, just as high-performing students from anywhere in the world now look forward to study in MIT.?

 The executive council, the highest policy-making body of Jadavpur University (JU), has already approved the decision to start admissions of foreign students from next year. 

 Though allotment of seats in JU was never restricted to Indian students, the university had stopped admitting foreign students from the early 1980s because government rules at that time did not permit JU to charge enhanced fees from foreign students. 

 Since then, the university had been practising a system of offering its courses only to a paltry number of foreign students, mostly from Bangladesh, who are sponsored by the Centre under its cultural exchanges programmes with other countries.

 The University Grants Commission (UGC) has recently lifted such restrictions from universities across the country.

 Officials elaborated that according to the JU decision, students from the developed countries who will take admission from next year will have to pay $ 3000 per year as tuition fees, while students from the Saarc countries will be required to pay $ 1000.

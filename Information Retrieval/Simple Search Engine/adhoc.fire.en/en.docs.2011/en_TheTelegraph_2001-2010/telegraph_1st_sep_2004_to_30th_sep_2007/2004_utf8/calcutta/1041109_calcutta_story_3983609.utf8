The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Glimpses of guts and glory

Peace Process: It was only the start of The Telegraph 

School Awards for Excellence 2004, at Science City auditorium on Saturday morning. 

But there were very few dry eyes ? on and off stage ? as the three students from 

Karachi High School, Ayesha Siddiqui, Saffa Ahmed and Bilawal Abbas, and teacher 

Faiza Quasim, along with their Calcutta pals, held up a banner with words and 

pictures penned by their friends back home in Pakistan. The message was of peace 

and friendship, while Yeh dosti hum nahin todenge... played in the background. 

After that, founder-principal of the school Parveen Quasim, better known as Ammi, 

spoke of how overwhelmed she was with the love and affection they had received, 

in a voice that was choked with emotion. Then, Bilawal sang four lines from the 

Chalte Chalte theme song, Pyar humko bhi hai, pyar tumko bhi hai, 

touching everyone?s hearts. Picture by Pabitra Das

 Help at hand: Angshuman Dalal from Durgapur (far left) hugs his Pakistani 

mother, Ammi, after receiving the Bonding Beyond Border Scholarship, sponsored 

by her. He had his left leg amputated below the knee due to bone cancer and she 

is fighting the disease for the third time. The two were brought together for 

the first time at the awards ceremony and are now family. Jamuna Kapadia (left) 

receives the Vijay Dudeja Memorial Scholarship. She goes to school every morning, 

works as a domestic help after that, and every evening, studies by the light of 

a lamp-post on a Ballygunge Phari pavement, which is where she lives with her 

family. The Class VI student of Sri Aurobindo School invariably does her homework 

on time. Pictures by Rashbehari Das 

Sonia?s Message: Sonia Gandhi accepts a gift 

from Purnima Pramanik (right), a student of Greenfields school. She is severely 

handicapped, born a spastic with mental retardation. But she is an excellent hand 

at embroidery. Purnima?s mother is an ayah, but her two sisters are also 

in school.

Subhram Chakraborty, the winner of The Surrendra Paul 

Memorial Award for Courage, receives his medal and certificate from Sonia (left). 

The Don Bosco, Liluah, student is suffering from multiple tumours in the brain 

and spine, which will probably paralyse him in future. But that hasn?t stopped 

Subhram from going to school, headaches, vision and hearing problems and all. 

He also participates in school programmes.

Congratulating the award-winners, their teachers (?backbone 

of our society?), parents and families for ?determination and courage?, Sonia 

had a message for the young people in the audience. ?We learn by overcoming tough 

situations... Learning never really ends. The most important thing is to remain 

open-minded and free-spirited, inspite of circumstances. You shouldn?t just listen 

to adults giving speeches... Somewhere inside, we want you to be true to yourself. 

It is not something we can teach you. None of us is alone in this world. One way 

to be true to ourselves is to nurture our feelings for others.? Pictures by Pabitra 

Das

To Sir, With Love: Students at Baikunthapur Primary School 

(above) last week. Headmaster Gopal Chandra Patra died on Sunday morning, but 

students and teachers have promised to carry on The Telegraph Education 

Foundation Hall of Fame inductee?s good work. City students will soon visit it.

Future Hope: Education is the Greatest Gift of All was 

the theme this year. About 25 girls from 25 city schools danced to Kal ho naa 

ho... to illustrate just that (below). Picture by Rashbehari Das

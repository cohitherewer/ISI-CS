The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Disco beats for lounge

ZEESHAN JAWED

The night was young, the ambience was soothing and the crowd was in the mood for mischief. Leading the pack was DJ Notorious who flew in from Mumbai to give Calcutta a taste of his scandalous remixes. The venue was Prince of Cal, the lounge at Sourav?s on Park Street.

 The nightclub has three lounging areas at a distance from the dance floor. Most of the nocturnal creatures preferred nursing their drinks to rocking the floor. But when they heard the opening notes of Bin tere sanam by DJ Suketu, everyone abandoned the cosy couches.

 Once the mood caught on, there was no turning back. Tracks like Jab andhera hota hai, Main saat samundar and Dhoom set the perfect party mood. ?The music is very commercial. That is what gets people on to the floor,? said DJ Notorious.

 The table turner was finally impressed by what he saw. ?It is a privilege to be playing here. After all, Souravda is a demi-god. This place is on a par with any hangout in Mumbai or Bangalore,? he smiled.

Retro rocks

 Nothing gets Calcutta going like retro music. So, not surprisingly, a blast from the past at Cloud 9 at The Astor was welcome news that drew in the enthusiastic crowd nice and early. Uncles and aunties kept the younger lot company on the floor.

 But at the stroke of midnight, security guards shooed them aside, for a fashion show with ?a retro theme?. What followed was a parade of pedestrian clothes by models. ?We could have done better justice to the theme,? was a complaint overheard from a lady on the wrong side of 30.

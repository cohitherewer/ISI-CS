The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shake a leg with stars, sing a carnival song

ZEESHAN JAWED

Did 

you think the razzle dazzle was all but over for the season? Then you should have 

been here, there and almost everywhere this weekend, when desi stars and 

exotic dancers sizzled the city partyscape like never before?

 Cine song

 The fare was filmi at Fusion, the newly-renovated ?resto-lounge bar? at The Golden Park. The guests of honour were actors Diana Hayden and Shawar Ali, in town to promote their just released film Ab?Bas. 

 The duo arrived fashionably late after 11 pm, while the party people had patiently queued up for the rumoured entry of the ex-Miss World at 9 pm. We guess the wait got to them, for once the stars arrived, most people seemed too busy partying with friends and family to notice.

 Quite a few fans, however, did flock to the surrounding tables to get a better view of Diana looking casually chic in denims and a black halter. 

 Her six-footer co-star went ahead to shake a long leg, while Diana preferred chatting with fans. Requests included autographs from him and sexy poses for cell phone cameras from her. 

 ?The adulation is overwhelming,? muttered the Hawas hunk. Diana tried her best to keep up with the fans? enthusiasm but was forced to call it a day a little while later and say (what else), ?ab, bas?! 

 Late comers were treated with yet another surprise attraction ? Tauba Tauba girl Monalisa, who also has a cameo in the film Ab?Bas. The girl?s presence was clinched with steamy promos from the movie, featuring her and Shawar, being screened on the giant screen at the venue. The usually sporty Calcutta crowd blushed a little to exclaim ?tauba, tauba!?.

Rio rave

 Brazilian bombshells exploded the nightlife at Tantra on Saturday. The excuse was the Rio carnival being replicated at the disco, if a little premature (the actual revelry takes place on the streets of Rio in February).

 Three dancers, especially flown in from Brazil, clad in authentic samba gear (there wasn?t much of it) turned up the heat on the cool November night. The real fest may bring city life to a halt, where revellers party hard on the streets, but within the closed confines, the make-believe do was quite a blast.

 As the dancers set the bar-top afire grooving to Latino beats of Bailamos and Un dos tres in itsy-bitsy costumes jazzed up with a lot of feathered embellishments, the crowd stopped in its tracks to capture the moves on convenient cell phone cameras.

 Sport spurt

 Match eve may have seen the current cricketers turn in early, but the sprinkling of sportsmen at city nightspots continued on Saturday. Kapil Dev and Leander Paes were seen chilling out at Shisha, after a stop at RCGC.

 The cricket star seemed at perfect ease with all the attention and obliged with countless requests for master strokes on paper, killer smile firmly in place. He didn?t mind being caught sprawled along a wall-side sofa by nosy shutterbugs while digging into kebabs with friends, punctuated by lazy puffs on the hookah.

 Exit cricket, enter tennis. It was Leander Paes? turn to drop in next. Lensmen were kept at arm?s length while Paes nursed endless rounds of Fresh Lime Soda. He stayed aloof in a far corner with close friends. Before leaving, he was overheard complaining about how ?hot? the packed nightclub was.

 But with so much off-pitch action all around, it was quite a surprise to see the sportsmen find time for a quiet night out.

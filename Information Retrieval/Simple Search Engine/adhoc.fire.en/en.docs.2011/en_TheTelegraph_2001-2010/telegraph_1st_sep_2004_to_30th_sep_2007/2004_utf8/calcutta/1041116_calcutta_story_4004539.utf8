 Entry windfall for Eden footfall

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 The past fortnight passed off well. And, going by the indications, the coming few months will be even better.

 Ever since an entry fee was introduced early this month, footfall at Eden Gardens has been on the rise. 

 The state forest department?s division of urban and recreational forestry has recorded that at least 750 to 800 people are visiting the green by the Ganga on an average every day. 

 ?It means we are netting Rs 1,500 daily. The monthly collection is expected to touch Rs 50,000,? said Somenath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests in the urban and recreational forestry division.

 The forest department has set a target of Rs 3.5 lakh by way of entry tickets by the end of the first year. ?However, going by the public response, I think the yearly target should be raised to Rs 5 lakh,? Mukherjee added.

 The authorities expect a sharp rise in turnout after winter sets in and the city reverts into festive mode.

 ?Earlier, many people loitering around the Esplanade area would enter the park to take a nap. They misused the waterbody and littered up the park. With the introduction of the entry fee, these people are being kept at bay,? explained a senior officer of the urban and recreational forestry division. 

 ?On the other hand, many of those who used to avoid the park, deterred by the unsavoury elements, are now feeling safe in it. And that is exactly what we wanted,? the officer added.

 Reputation of the park restored, the authorities are now planning to add a lot more attractions on the premises. Some of them have already been lined up. 

 First up is the annual flower show, from December 29 to January 1, 2005. Deputy conservator of forests Mukherjee expressed confidence that the show will be on a grander scale than in the previous years.

 The next event is likely to be a soiree. Mukherjee hopes to announce the schedule for this during the flower fest. 

 The culture show can also see food counters coming up on the premises. ?We can start off with tea and coffee counters and then move on to food,? Mukherjee said.

 The park opens at 5 am and visitors are allowed free entry till 8 am. 

 It closes at 5.30 pm, though tickets are not issued after 5.

 ?We have to seriously address the issue of illumination within the park. Visitors have told us they want to spend more time inside and we can keep the park open for a longer period if the damaged lights are repaired or replaced. The matter is being discussed now,? Mukherjee signed off.

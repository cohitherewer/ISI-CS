The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For the sake of a job

 Drama, as we all know, is a very effective medium to focus on societys problems. This is because while it highlights the issues it concerns itself with, care is also taken to preserve the quality of entertainment, making it easier for the audience to accept its message. Samikshan?s Manmoyee Girls? School is one such play dealing with the problem of unemployment that is prevalent in our society. The plot revolves around Manas and Niharika, two young people, looking for employment as teachers in a school. However, there being a condition that only married couples will be selected, the two pretend to be married to each other and are appointed teachers. Humorous circumstances inevitably follow as they are compelled to live as husband and wife for the sake of retaining their jobs. Full of intelligent dialogues, sharp wit and mature humour, this is a comedy that is certain to tickle the funny-bone of even the sternest among us.

 Event: Play in Bengali , Manmoyee Girls? School, produced by Samikshan

 When: Today at 3 pm

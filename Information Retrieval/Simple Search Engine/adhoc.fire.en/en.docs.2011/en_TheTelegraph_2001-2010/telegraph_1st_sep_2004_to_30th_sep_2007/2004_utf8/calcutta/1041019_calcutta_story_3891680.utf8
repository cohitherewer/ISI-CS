Puja look

How to look your best for four days of festivities 

Perfect Prep: (From top ) Funky hairstyles, 

body art, nail tattoos and a relaxing massage could be the perfect preparation 

for Puja 2004 

The Pujas can be compared to a five-act play. Much 

of the work gets done behind the scenes when the audience isn?t looking.

So Sashti is when the foundation must be set for what 

is to follow.

Make-up is not really a necessity for what is considered 

the unofficial first Puja day. But where to start and how? Is it necessary to 

follow trend or tradition?

For five festive days, the Goodlife will help troubleshoot 

these problems to help you look your best when it matters most.

Glow guarantee

Before the warpaint comes on and attacks your skin 

with gusto, it may be advisable to go that extra mile to ensure a perfect, natural 

glow that will also minimise the chances of a post-Dashami explosion of spots. 

The deep cleansing, antioxidant, exfoliating and bronzing facials serve the purpose 

of cleansing, toning and moisturising. For those on a tighter budget, home-made 

fruit facials can serve your purpose. Simply rub crushed fruits like papaya, watermelon 

or banana and watch your face glow.

Tress trick

If you are not adventurous enough to take the final, 

permanent plunge required to sport some daring hair streaks but still feel a latent 

urge to try it out, hair extensions are the perfect solution. Head for salons 

like June Tomkyns and Sunflower for a head full of wacky colours like blues, pinks, 

purples and browns.The good thing is if you hate it, you can just take it off. 

Also, it does not look as artificial as hair mascara.

Flirty fingers

Some like them long and round, others like them short 

and square. That used to be the rather narrow, boring fate of nails. Now all manner 

of polishes are being used to stroke up a more creative effect. Nail designs or 

tattoos are the in thing. Anything is possible: piercing and painting to surface 

embellishments using stones, glitter, stars or even Swarovski crystals. Using 

nail art colour or fabric paint, you can have any design at your fingertips.

Tranquil touch

With a number of hectic days ahead ? traffic jams, 

queues and jostling ? you need all your energy and then some. Shed that excess 

office baggage at the start of the festive fever with a rejuvenating massage. 

Whether it is a full body job that can last for an hour or two, or a back rub 

from someone you love, a massage is a great way to wind down. For the professional 

touch, try one of the spas or salons which now offer an array of methods and styles, 

including Ayurvedic, Swedish, acupressure, shiatsu, reflexology and rolfing massages.

Funky fiesta

Instead of wearing heavy jewellery, go in for some 

funky body art as the embellishment of choice this season. Tattoos might turn 

you off with the needle they call for, but you can try out a sticker or, for a 

more personal touch, a paintbrush and some fabric paint.

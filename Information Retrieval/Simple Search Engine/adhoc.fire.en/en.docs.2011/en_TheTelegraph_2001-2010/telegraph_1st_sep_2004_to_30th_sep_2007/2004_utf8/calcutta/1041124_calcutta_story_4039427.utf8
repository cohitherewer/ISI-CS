The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Showcase of strength for tech titans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jobs, business opportunities, tech talk and strategic hardsell by the Bengal government ? the scope and scale of the third edition of Infocom could not be bigger.

 The five-day mega IT exposition ? jointly organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP Ltd publication ? between December 1 and 5 will bring the who?s who of India Inc, the biggest brands from the IT and IT enabled services (ITES) industry and global business community together.

 More than 60 exhibitors have already logged in to book their space at the exhibition venue, the Salt Lake stadium grounds.

 ?This year, we are adding one more interesting element to the show and organising a job fair. Companies like GE, American Express and EXL Services and Birla Soft have already confirmed their presence at the fair,? revealed a spokesperson.

 Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, Reliance Industries, will set the tone for the CEO conclave on December 1.

 Nasscom president Kiran Karnik, Nandan Nilekani, CEO and managing director, Infosys, and Shanker Annaswamy, country head, IBM India, will take the proceedings forward with a discussion on Harnessing ICT (information, communication and technology) for Global Competitiveness.

 ?This will be the third Infocom. The show has already become one of the most important events in the calendar of events in the country. Now, we want it to get the status of a major international show,? said Karnik.

 According to the organisers, the programme schedule has been drawn up to focus on the key issues facing the industry and how efficient use of IT can help them be more competitive. There will also be sessions on business models for BPO players, legal framework challenges and the trends in e-governance.

 There will be representatives from the political world as well ? both central and state ? with Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state IT minister Manab Mukherjee taking centre stage.

 With the state government aiming to take its software export from Rs 1,740 crore (in 2003-04) to Rs 2,900 crore by the end of the current fiscal and add another 40,000 jobs in the IT and ITES sector by March 2006, the IT department is busy drawing up plans to use Infocom as a springboard to meet the targets.

 ?This event gives us the chance to showcase the strengths of the state in front of the captains of industry. We have started contacting key people seeking their appointments during Infocom,? said G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT.

 The list of speakers at Infocom will include Jerry Rao of Nasscom, Subir Rahar of ONGC, Raman Roy of Wipro Spectramind, David N. Barnes of IBM, Joe Duffy of PwC Global, Phil Goldie of Nortel, A.S. Viswanathan of Siemens, Malcolm Wagett of HSBC Electronic Data Processing India and Rahul Telang from Carnegie Melon University.

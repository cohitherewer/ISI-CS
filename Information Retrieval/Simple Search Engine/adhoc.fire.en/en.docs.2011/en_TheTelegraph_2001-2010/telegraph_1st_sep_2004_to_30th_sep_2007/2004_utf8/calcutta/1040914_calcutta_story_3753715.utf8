The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro hop for style stock

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 A glimpse from the Montana World of Wearable Art 

 Calcutta foxes Rohit Bal. The city traditionally is conservative in terms of both style and prices. People in Mumbai or Delhi are much more in the habit of buying designer labels, he says. But Calcutta now falls into a ?strange? category.

 ?There is a new wave of fashion consciousness in Calcutta. Good designers are coming up, boutiques are opening and stores are stocking designer labels. But Calcuttans will not spend on clothes in their own city,? he says.

 Bal has a number of clients from Calcutta who regularly pick up his clothes for weddings and other occasions. ?But they come to other metros to do their shopping, even if it is for the same labels.?

 The city, otherwise, is a great place for designers. ?The cost of labour is one-fourth of what it is here or in Mumbai,? says the Delhi-based designer. The low production cost allows local designers to keep the prices of their clothes down. ?That is fantastic for customers,? he says, adding that many of his colleagues, like Ritu Kumar, get their embroidery done in Calcutta.

 On the personal front, there is a spring in Bal?s step. And with good reason, too. This fall-winter has a couple of firsts in store for the man hailed by quarters as a ?master of fabric and fantasy?. 

 First up are the WOW awards in New Zealand, from September 10. The Montana World of Wearable Art, a fashion extravaganza, will have Dan Hannah (Oscar-winning set designer of The Lord of the Rings trilogy) on the judge?s panel this year. ?I am going as an envoy of the Fashion Design Council of India to check out the scope for future participation,? says Bal. The concept behind the gala is to showcase art on the body rather than on the wall. 

 But how wearable are clothes using fish hooks and car parts, as the exhibits of earlier years? ?It is a different concept of showing art, giving it motion. It sets the mind free. But they should call it non-wearable art,? laughs the ?enfant terrible of Indian fashion? who is credited with creating many a storm in a thimble (the shockwaves at the India Fashion Week in 2003 on seeing Bal?s male models wearing streaks of vermillion a case in point).

 If New Zealand has him in an audience seat, France will find him on the ramp this November. ?I have been invited to the Biennale International Design Festival in Saint Etienne. It is for artists, not just fashion designers. They have asked me to do my show around the art of India,? he reveals.

 Diplomat drive in business birdie

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bringing the world to Bengal will be the theme at the business seminar on December 11, designed to be the showpiece event of the Consular Corps golf tournament this winter, as the state ups the ante of its Advantage Bengal campaign.

 After industry minister Nirupam Sen hosted a dinner for the city?s consular diplomats last month to pledge unstinting support for the birdie-business initiative, another round of parleys this weekend sought to fine-tune the agenda at the all-important business conclave during the December 10-12 meet.

 With organising committee chairman R.P. Goenka steering proceedings, the Consular Corps brass and officials of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), co-hosts of the seminar, are drawing up the guest list for the two-session conclave.

 External affairs minister K. Natwar Singh will be the chief guest, while Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman, planning commission, will deliver the keynote address. Among key dignitaries to speak at the daylong conclave will be former Danish prime minister Paul Slutter and Lord Sterling of P amp;O Ports, the infrastructure company from the UK.

 The Consular Corps expects 10-12 ambassadors to participate in the round-table Q amp;A to be moderated by US consul-general in Calcutta George N. Sibley. This will be preceded by the tabling of a pre-event document and WBIDC presentations on food processing, IT and petrochemicals.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, expected to preside over the business seminar, had said earlier this year: ?We know there is an image problem with our state, which means we have to work that much harder to dispel doubts. I am grateful to Calcutta?s Consular Corps for making a sincere effort to project Bengal as a good place to do business.? He was speaking at the launch of the Consular Corps publication A resurgent West Bengal!

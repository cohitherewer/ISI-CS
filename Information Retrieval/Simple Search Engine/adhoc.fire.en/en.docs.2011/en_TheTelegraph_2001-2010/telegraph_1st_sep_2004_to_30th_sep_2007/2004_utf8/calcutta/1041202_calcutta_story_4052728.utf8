The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bon Appetease

Last year, the Durga puja committee in Dallas, Texas, 

elected a new president. A section of the Bengali community didn?t like the person 

so it decided to have a Durga puja of its own. The original committee took the 

new faction to court. In the hearing, the judge looked at both parties and said 

that he not only respected Indians for their intellect, but also for their cultural 

heritage. Besides, he was familiar with the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore and 

aware of the fact that Bengal was one of the cultural pillars of India. 

Under the circumstances, he was ashamed to see people 

from India, especially Bengal, bicker over petty issues unworthy of a community 

respected widely for upholding traditional values and customs. He refused to judge 

the case and dismissed it from his court. The end of the story is that last year, 

for the first time in decades, Dallas had two Durga pujas. 

The cost of petrol and diesel is the highest in Calcutta. 

The state taxes on petroleum products are also the highest in India. We need to 

object. Collectively? Of course not. The SUCI, CPI(M-L) and the Trinamul decided 

to have three separate bandhs representing the same people (us poor citizens of 

Bengal) and a common cause ( the ?unjustified? rate hike). Why am I compelled 

to draw a comparison between Texas and Bengal? The richest state in the US and 

one of the poorest in India ? Well, facetiously, what we definitely have in common 

are political agendas dictated by an unaware rural public who do not represent 

the collective opinion of those living in New York and Calcutta. Apart from that, 

Texas also does not believe in, but imposes capital punishment.. 

In an era of marriages of convenience that began decades 

ago, Sri Aurobindo was dismissed as a terrorist and Subhash Chandra Bose didn?t 

quite fit into the group of spin masters who had learnt their cricket in England. 

Sri Aurobindo had put the congress on its revolutionary feet and so disappeared 

and Bose formed the INA. 

Later we had the Bangla Congress. Then the Marxists 

split from the regular Communist party and the Left had some forward and some 

regressive blocks to build governments upon. Finally, the Trinamul firebrand, 

depicted by two surrealistically painted three-leaved clovers in a tuft of grass, 

summed up the artistic and political landscape of West Bengal. 

The maidan, I also discovered, is split into the blue 

zone and the red zone and the former is being developed into parks. Elliot Park 

is a great example of how the Calcutta Police and the Tatas combined (Sivaji Ghosh, 

IPS, joint commissioner from the former and Dr Mukherjee, deputy MD of the latter) 

to create an area of green that strollers and joggers will thank forever. The 

rest of the green belt along Chowringhee has also been split up. The section next 

to Elliot?s is being developed with several companies pitching in, and our mayor 

Subrata Mukherjee has clearly said the CMC?s park opposite Rabindra Sadan will 

be the best of the lot. 

This, I think, is a constructive way of utilising 

the spirit of division that exists in our community. Arguing semantics by re-defining 

?division? is best left to the NCC cadets of Presidency College who are the brainiest 

foot soldiers of tomorrow?s India. 

The English-speaking world who argue about split infinitives 

for instance, are the same who will discuss Buddhadebbabu?s observation 

that Bengal has 18 per cent greenery as opposed to the recommended 23 per cent 

and Calcutta has a mere 6 per cent. Tragically, who cares about greens in a world 

where the green-back?s value is dropping? 

But, whichever ?green? awareness you might talk about, 

the world is split into five categories: (1) those who neither know nor care what 

a split is; (2) those who don?t know, but care very much; (3) those who know and 

condemn; (4) those who know and approve; and (5) those who know and distinguish. 

So for the distinguished, or the knowledgeable you can distinguish, here is the 

ultimate ?split? to enthrall your chilling discussions over a hot bowl of soup. 

Split Kabli Chana (green peas) Soup with Lamb 

and Mint 

 Ingredients: 175g dried yellow split peas, 

picked over and rinsed, 1 tbsp groundnut or sunflower oil, 350 g lamb shoulder, 

knuckle end, trimmed of fat, 

1 onion, coarsely chopped, 4 tbsp thinly sliced celery, 

2 tbsp curry powder, 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 small bay leaf, 2 tbsp 

chopped fresh mint, 1 carrot, thinly sliced, 1 tsp salt, ? tsp white pepper, ? 

lemon juice and 4 mint sprigs for garnish. 

 Method: In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, 

heat the oil over medium-high heat and cook the lamb joint until it is brown on 

all sides ? 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, celery 

and curry powder; stirring constantly, until the onion turns translucent ? 3 to 

5 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 30 seconds, stirring to keep 

the mixture from burning. Add the peas, the bay leaf and 1.5 litres (2 ? pints) 

of water. 

Bring the mixture to the boil, skim off any impurities, 

then add the chopped mint. Partially cover the pan, reduce the heat, and simmer 

the soup until the meat and the peas are tender ? about 1 hour. Now remove the 

lamb joint. Once it is cool enough to handle, trim the meat from the bone and 

cut it into bite-size pieces and set aside. 

Remove the bay leaf from the peas and discard it. 

Puree the peas in a blender or food processor and then return them to the pan. 

Add the lamb and carrot and cook with the pan covered over medium heat until the 

carrot slices are tender for 5 minutes. Season the soup with salt, pepper and 

lemon juice. Serve in individual bowls, each garnished with a sprig of mint. 

So, in future, let us encourage the togetherness that 

binds society, people and families and let?s collectively shun those who advocate 

a ?split? in anything except peas!

Meena. More arrests were likely, he indicated.

 fficers said the dealers and those arrested would sell the smuggled foodgrain in the open market at a premium. Inquiries revealed that the 132 tonnes of wheat were earmarked for distribution among the poor in North and South 24-Parganas. 

 We seized 11 truckloads of wheat from Master Flour Mills and Reform Flour Mills, both in the Shibpur police station area,? Meena said. ?The trucks entered the mills? gates straight from the FCI godown,? he added. False challans have also been seized.

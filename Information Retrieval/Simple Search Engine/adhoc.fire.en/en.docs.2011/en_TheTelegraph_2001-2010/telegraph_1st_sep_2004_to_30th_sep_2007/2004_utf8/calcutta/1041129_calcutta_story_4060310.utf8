The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

The pain that lies beneath

 ?I am a common citizen, who tries to understand whatever is happening around me and express it in my way. Sometimes I go wrong, sometimes I?m right.?

 A sample of the simplicity that has made Gulzar?s poetry speak volumes in just a few words. In the city to receive the Satyajit Ray Lifetime Achievement honour at the Bengal Film Journalists? Association Awards, Gulzar didn?t want his name to be taken alongside that of Ray.

 ?Manikda is like a guru. I have learnt so much from his work. Lifetime achievement awards are all about giving them at the right time. You either give the honour to someone as old as me or someone as young as me,? he laughed.

 After being the cynosure of all eyes on the starry Saturday night at Salt Lake stadium, Gulzar read some of his poems at Crossword on Sunday morning. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Gulzar wasn?t critical about new Bollywood cinema. ?Like all fine arts, cinema, too, is a reflection of society. You shouldn?t look at cinema in isolation. You have to make the effort to go and watch cinema, like you go and buy a book to read.?

 The poet-film-maker was also optimistic about the next generation. ?They are a lot more transparent and straightforward. They do not have pretensions. If for nothing else, they will make India their own for their own identity. Our generation has never been able to stand up against all the wrongs. I hope the new one will.?

 Talking about his poetry, Gulzar spoke about the pain that lies beneath. ?I manage the pains of my own faults, my own guilt. I am like burning sticks and time is like water. As time goes by, more water is poured and it all just keeps boiling inside.?

 Working on Munshi Premchand?s stories for a serial on Doordarshan, Gulzar is also keen to explore Rabindranath Tagore?s works. ?My entire life took a turnaround after I read the translated version of Tagore?s Gardener. I want to work on some of his stories which have been written in verse. I want to interpret them the way he wanted to. When adapting a literary work, the meaning should never change. Once the screenplay is done, I?ll do the casting.?

 And Bengali faces may well figure prominently in Gulzar?s plans. After all, Bengal?s special place in his heart shone through more than occasionally. ?I love the language and can speak it, too. But I am afraid to do so in Calcutta. After all, you don?t dare speak in pharsi in front of a Pathan. I am in love with Bengali food, especially fish. And everyone knows my greatest critic happens to be a Bengali, too (in a reference to wife Raakhee).?

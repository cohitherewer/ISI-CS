 Ten commandments of fume test

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 

 On the heels of widespread complaints of vehicles not being tested properly, the state transport department has issued a 10-point guideline to all auto emission testing centres. It is mandatory for the operators to follow the guideline.

 As per the norms laid down by the Centre and the high court, emission from a motor vehicle has to be tested by a multi-gas analyser (for petrol-run vehicles) or a opacymeter (for diesel-run vehicles).

 Though the new rules have been effective from October 1, they are not being followed in the city due to a delay in installation of new machines. Sixty of the 70 testing centres in the city have new machines.

 ?The central norms clearly mention how the new machines should be operated and also the process to be followed while testing a vehicle. But we have information that many operators are not following the norms,? a transport department official said. 

 ?Testing vehicular emission with the new machines is not child?s play; the operators have to be very careful. We have issued the guideline to clear all confusion and ensure that the rules are followed,? he asserted. 

 According to the guideline, only people holding motor mechanic certificates from the Industrial Training Institute or an equivalent centre can test vehicles. He or she must also possess a heavy-vehicle driving licence and a minimum of two years? experience in engine adjustment.

 Those who test vehicles will have to prepare and sign the test reports. He/she will be assisted by a clerk having computer knowledge and a helper.

 The operators will have to maintain a register containing the reports of the tests and send a copy of each report to the public vehicles department (PVD).

 PVD director H. Mohan said all operators would have to abide by the guideline to avoid stern action, including cancellation of licences.

 Secretary of the testing centre operators? association Asim Banerjee said members had no intention of defying the rules. ?It will take time to get accustomed to the new machines. There had been some teething trouble, but things should be sorted out within a couple of months. We have already asked the operators to engage qualified mechanics,? he added.

 As per the guideline, the testing centres will remain open on all days from 6 am to 10 pm and each centre will be allowed to test a maximum of 50 vehicles a day.

 In case a vehicle fails to meet the emission norms, the mechanic will have to make the necessary adjustments on the spot and conduct the test again. If the vehicle still fails to meet the norms, it will be given a fortnight?s time to make the necessary changes.

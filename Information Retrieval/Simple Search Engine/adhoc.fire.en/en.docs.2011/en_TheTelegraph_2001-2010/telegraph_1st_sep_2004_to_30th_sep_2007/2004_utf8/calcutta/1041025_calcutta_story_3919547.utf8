The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

It breathes well, it feels right

Kiran?s call 

Handloom is hot, says Kiran Uttam Ghosh, as she packs her Peacock collection 

for Singapore

Kamladevi Chattopadhyay would have smiled in approval. 

From the days when a spunky woman spent a lone lifetime trying to convince the 

world that handloom is beautiful, the fabric of her faith has morphed into the 

stuff of designer dreams. 

Apparently Gandhiji has been called the first true 

Indian designer! Sometimes I wonder whether we give Gandhiji his due for giving 

khadi its cult status. Remarkable for a man who wasn?t born into a weaver?s family, 

studied to be a lawyer and didn?t know his charkha (spinning wheel) from 

a kargha (handloom) when he started out. 

The grapevine has it that Indira Gandhi had the pick 

of the coveted Cottage Industries? handwoven collection before they went to the 

showroom. Isn?t it still the one stop for every overseas guest?

As that last dart goes into my Singapore Colours of 

the Peacock collection for the event organised by Maniza Jumabhoy, of the Chinese 

Women?s Association, I notice so much of it is made of handloom. That?s a long 

ramp romp for the fabric from 1989 when Devika Bhojwani and Khadi and Village 

Industries Commission put the power of the hand into an apolitical fashion presentation 

featuring 85 garments. 

What is it about handlooms that feels so right? Handlooms 

are natural. And natural is always beautiful. Like fresh flowers. I never tire 

of walking down my street to collect freshly fallen laburnum flowers, or the fragrance 

of shiuli that announces the Pujas. On the other hand, I remember brighter than 

bright plastic roses, blooms from industry?s own garden, that held pride of place 

over my grand aunt?s TV set. Till they began to look tired and dust-infested. 

Then a few years ago, silk flowers were the rage. Now coloured glass blooms in 

every lifestyle store. The artificial brings with it fatigue. But real flowers? 

You needn?t be Van Gogh to smile at sunflowers or Wordsworth to be daffy about 

daffodils.

That reminds me of two very interesting women I met 

a couple of weeks ago. Stanford graduate Sally Holkar planned to be a lawyer but 

took up the improbable case of Maheswar weavers instead, out of sheer love of 

the fabric, and Suhashini Ali, daughter of Colonel Lakshmi Sehgal of Netaji?s 

Indian National Army, the woman who almost became our gender?s first rep as the 

President of India. Her political activism apart, Suhashini is Muzaffar Ali?s 

first wife, Shaad Ali?s mother and Asoka Shah Rukh Khan?s screen mom. 

Both these spirited women were here for their work 

with weaves to promote Kota, Chanderi and Maheswari-makers as part of a synergy 

brought together by Weavers? Studio. And though I beg to differ ? as my entire 

home is dressed in handloom and since they are now used just about everywhere, 

in clothing, dhurries, cushions, curtains, or hangings ? Holkar and Ali fear, 

there has been a decline in the use of handloom products. 

There?s nothing like the irregular sensuous slub of 

a fine, hand-woven man?s cotton shirt, or the transluscence of a sheer cream Chanderi 

kurta. Can you imagine the crispness of a well starched (geeley kora) kurta 

over a dhoti in anything but fine handwoven Bengal cotton? Handlooms have a sense 

of history. Imagine the irregularity of a lal paar Jaamdani being woven 

by machine? Thank heavens and weavers, no two swatches are identical. 

About the last thing you need to inspire brilliance 

is cloned cloth. Why would we look at anything else? Can you imagine polyester-clad 

politicians or the dignified Nehru delivering the freedom speech wearing nylon? 

Remember that street saying describing hi-fashion ?Nylon shari, phylon pant...?! 

Didn?t last long, did it? Even my Parvati doesn?t care for nylon these days. 

We grew up with a rigid image of the handloom sari, 

big bindi, Kolhapuri chappal kind of woman who would only wear handwovens. 

Today it?s no longer an ideological thing. Like I?d like to wear blue jeans and 

a white T one day, or chiffon and pearls another, the handloom look today is yet 

another style statement. 

As for the international buyer: I believe we offer 

him a unique womb-to-tomb understanding of Indian handloom. I grew up with memories 

of my grandmother spirited and elegant in handlooms and handmade chappals. I believe 

my sensibilities have been shaped by images of Indira Gandhi, Aruna Asaf Ali, 

Jaya Jaitley and Shabana Azmi, women who can hold their own internationally, who?ve 

worn handlooms well. 

I?m the product of a country where a handspun, handwoven 

khadi sari dressed the most talked about bride. Indira Gandhi married in a pale 

pink khadi sari spun by Nehru in prison. Sonia Maino wore the same sari on another 

Vasant Panchami she became a Gandhi. And so did Priyanka.

Handmade or (wo)manmade, spirited women and men wear 

handlooms and khadi and it?s stood the tensions of time. I, for one, am not going 

to reinvent the spinning wheel. I?d rather take what tradition has handed me down 

and give it new avatars. It feels right, it breathes well, it works for me. It?s 

a strong thread of passion that I take with me to Singapore. The message that 

handlooms are hot.

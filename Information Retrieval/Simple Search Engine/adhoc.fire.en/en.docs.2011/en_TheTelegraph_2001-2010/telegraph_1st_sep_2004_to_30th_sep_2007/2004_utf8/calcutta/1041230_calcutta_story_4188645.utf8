 Is the kitchen of your favourite restaurant hygienic? Or, is the food served there safe? The state tourism department will soon start finding the answers for you. 

 Flooded with a series of complaints against hotels and bar-restaurants, the government has decided to keep tabs on their functioning and ensure that they follow the rules.

 ?The tourism department is framing a set of rules which will be mandatory for hotel and restaurant-owners to follow,? asserted Sourin Bhattacharya, managing director, West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC).

 Now, anyone can open a hotel or a bar-restaurant after obtaining a trade licence from the civic authorities. The tourism department?s approval is necessary only for opening a starred hotel. 

 According to the proposed rules, the tourism department?s consent will be mandatory, along with the trade licence, even to run an un-starred hotel, restaurant, bar or a guest house. 

 The approval will be given against a fee and after officials are convinced that the establishment will abide by the rules. ?We will check out the efficiency and the capability of a prospective owner to run a hotel or a restaurant.We will also verify the competence of the employees, especially cooks and waiters, the condition of the kitchen, the quality of water and the security system,?? an official said.

 Inspectors will visit the establishments at regular intervals and take stern action, including cancellation of licence, against the owner if any foul play is detected. 

 ?As there is no set of rules on running a small hotel or a restaurant, the government has no control over the owners. The new system will remove the handicap,? said WBTDC managing director Bhattacharya.

 The government?s aim, he explained, is not just to monitor the quality of the service, but also to ensure that customers are not cheated or that hotel/restaurant employees don?t misbehave with them. 

 ?Thousands of tourists from various states and abroad visit the city every day and we cannot sit idle knowing that a good many of them are being cheated at hotels/restaurants,? Bhattacharya emphasised. 

 Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India secretary Rajesh Mishra, while welcoming the move, expressed fear that government control may create problems.

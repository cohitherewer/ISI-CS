 Now, studies with a smile

 - Church schools to revamp syllabi to reduce stress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Trying to outdo each other will no longer be the sole aim of children studying in schools under the Church of North India (CNI). 

 To ensure that students enjoy what they learn, Rev P.S.P. Raju, Bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the CNI, on Monday announced a comprehensive plan to relieve children of parental pressure and stress. 

 The CNI will implement a string of training programmes after the Pujas, covering everybody involved in its education system ? principals, teachers, guardians ? to reduce tension caused by an increasing pressure to ?score high marks in examinations?. 

 ?Our aim is to develop a completely new approach for imparting education to students in all our 11 English-medium schools in Calcutta,? the Bishop said. 

 ?Students face a number of problems because of the changes that have taken place in courses and syllabi. The purpose of our proposed measures is to restructure our education system in a way best suited to the present requirements,? he elaborated.

 The CNI wants to ensure that ?students find pleasure in studies, instead of running after high marks and targets set by others?. The Calcutta diocese has also undertaken a plan to cut the number of failures in every class to ?zero?. 

 ?Our idea is to ensure that each and every student in all our schools is able to score at least the minimum pass marks and go to the next class,? Rev Raju emphasised.

 ?This is possible if learning is made enjoyable for every student, but teachers, too, need to be trained,? he stressed. 

 The schools will be asked to increase interactive sessions with guardians. They will ensure that teachers, guardians and students are constantly in touch with each other and exchange views concerning students? problems.

 For the first time, the CNI will make it compulsory for principals of all 11 schools to undergo training to improve their administrative skills. 

 All of them will be sent to an institute in Hyderabad, where they will have to undergo a short-term course. The English-medium CNI schools in Calcutta include the four branches of St Thomas?, St James?, Pratt Memorial, St John?s Diocesan, Cathedral Mission and the two branches of La Martiniere.

 Once the principals are better equipped to handle students? problems, extensive sensitisation programmes will be started for teachers to establish better relationships among students and teachers and teachers and guardians. 

 Experts in the field of framing teachers? training courses will be engaged for the purpose, Rev Raju said.

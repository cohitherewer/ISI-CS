 Cupids arrow strikes again

 As part of The Signature Theatre Festival 2004, Spandan presents an English comedy, Love Hua Once More. The play, revolving around the amorous affair between a middle-aged couple, is an absolute laugh-riot offering a lopsided view of the institutions of love and marriage. Kumar Anand is a 40-plus widower, still mourning his wifes death. To relieve him of his loneliness, his sister fixes for him a date with pretty divorcee Sonia. Sonia herself has to be coerced by a friend to meet Kumar. Though the pair is initially very much hesitant to strike up a relationship, fate destines otherwise. An accidental phone conversation succeeds in getting the two interested in each other, and soon they decide to get married. The situation, however, continues to be delicately poised as Kumar is yet to get over his past, and the human ?cupids? find themselves headed for doom once their little secret is exposed. Directed by Vandana Sajnani and with Rati Agnihotri in the role of Sonia, the generous doses of humour and laughter in the play promise to keep the audience in good spirits.

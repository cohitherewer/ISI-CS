Warm up to jazzy jackets

From retro fur to classic denims and in-vogue 

tweeds, there are lots to choose from if you want to hot up your winter, says 

Ipsita Deb

Pack away your fleshy summer outfits for clothes that 

make you feel warm rather than look hot. In Calcutta, where the mercury doesn?t 

dip low enough to call for true bundling up, a trendy jacket is your perfect winter 

wardrobe staple.

In terms of trends, the shapes are softer this season 

and markedly feminine. With bright colours also doing the rounds, funky leather 

jackets, blazers and classic topcoats form the style mantra for outerwear this 

year. A jacket can instantly pull your look together, no matter what you?re wearing 

or where you?re going. Here?s a host of rich fabrics and layered styles to warm 

up your winter.

Trendy tweeds

Designers on the winter New York ramp turned to 1950s 

fashion favourites and used luxury tweeds including herringbone, wool and ribbon-enhanced 

polychromatic glittering tweeds, to produce fur-trimmed suits and coats.

?Tweed jackets are definitely a season must-have. 

I?ve designed a number of jackets with double stand collars, pushed-up sleeves 

(with the underlayer showing), trenches with an Indian flavour and below-the-knee 

lengths. These are in hues of tomato red, black, purple, green and yes, more green,? 

smiles designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh.

Ski style

This sporty accessory is no longer restricted to the 

snow-capped peaks. It has been given fashion status. Ski jackets bring active 

sportswear off the slopes and on to the streets, achieving style while retaining 

practicality. The jackets come retro-styled, cropped, brightly coloured or femininely 

fitted. They can be worn with tweed, denim or even chiffon and satin, with the 

season?s mantra being more about clashing than matching. You can spot these at 

New Market.

Denim diktat

Denim, the universal fabric, is working its charm 

in the winter wear segment again this year. It?s looking best in more fitted styles 

with minimal bulk and paired with layered T-shirts, camisoles, silk blouses or 

sweaters. Corduroy jackets are also flying off the shelves. Both can be found 

at Levis, Spykar and Benetton outlets.

?I?ve recently developed an addiction for jackets, 

be it coat-length, short, leather, denim or well, just about anything! I always 

believe that a jacket can complete the incomplete in any ensemble and a versatile 

collection salvages those nerve-wracking I-can?t-wear-this-again situations,? 

says actress Raima Sen (seen sporting various kinds of jackets in pictures 

by Pabitra Das).

Leather layers

A combination of distressed leather, shearling (sheepskin 

underlining) and military inspiration is the leather bomber jacket that?s doing 

the rounds. While the bomber was huge in the mid-80s post Tom Cruise and Top 

Gun, today?s leather bombers are less rugged and more structured.

?More sophisticated, formal and casual leather jackets 

can be found in various shapes and sizes and different lengths such as trench 

coat, knee, three-quarter and hip,? says Andaleeb Hashmi, owner, Leatherworld 

on Theatre Road. Embellishments include simple zippers, buttons and chains, while 

when it comes to colour, traditional black and brown share shelf-space with pinks, 

reds, greens and blues.

The store also boasts customised jackets that can 

be made on 24-hours notice. Priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,500, the leather 

jacket never quite goes out of style.

Vintage vogue

Whether it?s a vintage finish on leather or denim, 

retro is as in now as it was during the sultry summer. Fake fur, now called faux 

fur, is almost everywhere, and keeps you stylish while respecting your animal-care 

instincts. With waists back in fashion, the belted coat is easily spotted, with 

dabs of fur on the collar or belt.

?Fake fur on traditional motifs like paisley acts 

is a contradiction, adding zing to the garments. It makes it interesting, fun 

and sexy,? adds Kiran.

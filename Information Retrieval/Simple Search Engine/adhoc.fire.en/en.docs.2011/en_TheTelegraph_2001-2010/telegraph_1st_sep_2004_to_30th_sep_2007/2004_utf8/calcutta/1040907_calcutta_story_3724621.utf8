 Worth your bathtub

SANGITA S. GUHA ROY

Long before chocolates and champagne started appearing in the bathtub, the humble salt has been invigorating the body and doing heavy-duty cleansing like no other. 

 A cruder variety of the table salt, mixed with artificial colouring and aromatic oils, bath salts tickle and irritate the skin, cleansing and relieving stress. For a good soak, add three tablespoons of a bath salt to a tub full of water. Mix thoroughly with your hands and enjoy. 

 Available in glass bottles (picture above by Rashbehari Das) in a variety of sensual shapes and sizes, bath salts make for colourful bathroom accessories as well. Shades like orange, purple, mint, green, pink, white and lemon make them attractive gift items, especially on romantic occasions. Nothing like giving someone a bottle of bath salts before a date to get the message across! More so if youve taken the pains to concoct a bottle yourself.

 Theres more to the salts than meets the eye. According to Feng Shui exponents, the salts are supposed to absorb the free-flowing negative energy in a bathroom, leaving it as fresh as your body after a dip. 

 When combined with aromatic oils, the salts acquire therapeutic and stress-busting properties. Floral, fruity fragrances apart, exotic names like Mandarin and Ylang Ylang from the stable of Delhi-based brand The Home Store are believed to invigorate, uplift the mood and rejuvenate the body and mind after a hard days work.

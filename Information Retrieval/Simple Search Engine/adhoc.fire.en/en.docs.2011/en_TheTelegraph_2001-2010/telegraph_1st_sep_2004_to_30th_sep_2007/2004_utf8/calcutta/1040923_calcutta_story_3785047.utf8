 Bansdroni beauty blitz

 Sunday evening at Maitra Apartments in Bansdroni was clearly a choice between June and Sourav, glamour and the game. While the men in blue struggled to put up a fight before Pakistan at Edgbaston, women of the south Calcutta locality turned up in large numbers to pick up a few tips on good grooming from the actress at The Good Life Talk Show.

 From figure-conscious mothers to schoolgirls seeking a remedy for suntan, young women eager to learn the art of make-up to the not-so-young fretting over falling hair, the motley crowd poured out its pet peeves while June ? in a black-and-white outfit ? stepped into some grey zones of looking good.

 ?How do you maintain your skin?? asked an audience member. ?I use a scrub, then dab some bath oil and wash it off,? said June. What are the secrets of a healthy lifestyle? Early to bed and early to rise, a balanced diet, drinking lots of water and, above all, smiling, came the reply (with a smile).

 Keya Dasgupta, mother of a one-year-old, wanted to know the shortcut to knocking off her tummy tiers. ?You have to exercise, either aerobics or yoga. There is no easy way out,? warned June, a mother of two.

 Sunspots and freckles turned out to be a common problem bothering those who ventured out in the sun. For Dipannita, who cycles to school everyday, June suggested a face pack of flour, milk or rose water. ?You can apply some home-made curd after returning home and wash it off with cold milk. Using mashed papaya is also very effective.?

 To Pragya, who was wary of the harmful effects of bleaching, June advised a ready recipe of tomato and lime juice. ?Those are very effective bleaching agents but please dilute citric juices with water.?

 For Madhumita, the bother was brittle nails. ?Dab your nails in glycerine and have calcium tablets, too. If your hands are dry, apply some moisturiser or baby oil,? said June.

 The talk veered to falling hair. ?It?s the stress and strain that is at the root of this problem. So drink adequate water and have multi-vitamin tablets,? stressed the star.

 ?What can we do to lighten the dark shade that results from wearing lipstick for long hours?? came a query from the audience. The tip: dilute some lime juice with plain or rose water and apply it regularly. ?But you need to be patient and keep on repeating this for a week to see any results,? added June.

 Ajanta Dasgupta was eager to learn the art of day make-up. ?Use a light foundation and dab some compact powder over it. Lipstick, kajal and sunglasses and you are ready to hit the road.? 

 Queries on how she became an actress (?thanks to Aparna Sen and Sudeshna Roy?) and what she keeps in her hand-bag (?lipstick, kajal, blush-on and perfume) drew the curtains on the chat show.

 The best, as usual, was saved for last. The formal session over, the crowd thronged the actress? table. If the mothers continued with the Q amp; A, the little girls were busy proffering pages and palms to be autographed.

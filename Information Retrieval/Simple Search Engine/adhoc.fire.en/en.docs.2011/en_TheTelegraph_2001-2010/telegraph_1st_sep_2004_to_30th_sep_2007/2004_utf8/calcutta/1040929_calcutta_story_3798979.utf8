The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crack-the-whip fiat for force

 - Top cop wants vigil stepped up ahead of Pujas

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In an effort to ensure a trouble-free Durga puja, police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty has asked his force to beef up night patrol and vigil by plainclothesmen. 

 Home department officials said Chakraborty?s fiat came in course of last week?s crime conference at Lalbazar. 

 Only a few days ago, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had expressed his concern to Chakraborty over the city?s rising crime graph. He drew the police commissioner?s attention to two recent lynchings ? of a vagrant in Narkeldanga and a 14-year-old boy in Ekbalpore. ?The crime figures are uncomfortable for the chief minister, as well as the force,? an official said.

 At the crime conference, Chakraborty asked his officers to reactivate their contacts in every locality ? even build up an informer base among hawkers ? to collect information about gangs or individual criminals. 

 Officers attached to police stations as well as those working in various wings of the detective department have been asked to identify and nab pick-pockets.

 The watch section, in particular, has been asked to keep a tab on the gangs active on public transport. A special security ring will be thrown around malls to prevent snatching and shoplifting. 

 Referring to the recent lynchings, the police commissioner asked his officers to develop expertise in tackling mob violence. The cops, he said, should intervene before the situation spins out of control. 

 Chakraborty also asked the officers-in-charge of various police stations to keep a vigil on houses whose occupants will be out of town during the Puja vacation. 

 Citing the instance of a Gariahat house, where a gang had robbed valuables over a period of 20 days, he ordered his men to ensure that those who spend the Pujas elsewhere do not return to find their valuables cleaned out. 

 On pujas that threaten to block traffic, Chakraborty said the city would not be allowed to be stranded. 

 He asked his men to keep in mind that they are the custodians of Calcutta. And during an event like Durga puja, when all other institutions recede into the background, police?s role becomes supreme. 

 ?A few million people, many of them from the rural areas, will visit the city during the Pujas. They will come in contact with you and go back with an impression of the city based on that. So, serve them with a smile,? was his parting shot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I can be a thinking actress in a masala film?

 With a swollen eye but an upbeat spirit in Siliguri for the Parineeta shoot, DIA MIRZA chatted with Pratim D. Gupta about the new actor in her.

 What made you sign Parineeta?

 I had met Vinod Chopra a couple of years ago and told him that I wanted to work with him. He?s the only film-maker I have ever said something on those lines. That?s something I think I should be doing more often.

 And why so?

 In this industry, only you can get yourself a role. No one helps you. You have to let people know of your interest to work with them. That?s something which hasn?t ever come naturally to me. Just a few days back, someone in the film industry was asking me how it feels to see other lesser talented actresses working with such big banners. I feel, I should get more vocal now?

 But your role in Parineeta is all of four scenes?

 I met Pradeepda at 2 in the night. He was leaving for Calcutta the next day. He told me, ?Dekho, beshi role nei? kintu roleta bhalo? Aami chai tumi koro.? Vinod told me that for this character of Gayatri, whom Shekhar (Saif) is supposed to get married to in the film, they had decided to go for a known face. They wanted someone striking, someone with a timeless beauty. They also wanted someone whom people would root for to get married to Saif. Then I went through the script and I loved the way my character came through even in those few scenes. Throughout those scenes, I am on this higher plane than Saif and he?s like: ?Uff! What a girl.? Also, I felt they would be able to judge me and may be, we can work for a bigger project in the future.

 You did your first film with Saif, Rehna Hai Terre Dil Mein. And now you are working with him again. What?s new about him?

 Oh, he?s a completely different man from the one I worked with. He is a lot more focused and his concentration level has gone up tremendously. He used to be so perky on the sets. But now he is a lot more composed. He wants not just his role but his scenes and the entire film to do well.

 And what about you?

 I think, I too have grown as an actress. Vinod asked me which of my films should he watch to know my acting skills. I told him he would ideally watch all my films and then only he would see the changes in me over all the films. Both Saif and me talk a lot about how a particular dialogue should be rendered. The same lines can be mouthed in so many ways and each has its own meaning. And we are trying to get it just right. That?s something Ajay (Devgan) never does. We recently worked together for Blackmail and he doesn?t need to rehearse at all. He always gets the lines right in the first go.

 You also did the new Saptapadi with Basu Chatterjee?

 Yes, playing Rina Brown was so challenging. She is a woman who has this haughty air about her... The world breaks her and yet even in the last scene there is that ego at work. It was a tough role but I thought I was up to it. Basuda asked me not to watch the original to avoid influences. The film has Jimmy Shergill opposite me. For Basuda, it was a return to old times. It was very touching.

 So are you doing the Saregama Bengali film with Prosenjit?

 I was supposed to. But they haven?t come back to me with the film script. I think they want to shoot it this winter. That?s a problem for me. I have to finish Parineeta and also Neeraj Vohra?s film.

 But how has your Bengali picked up?

It?s not something I am doing consciously. Just that 

my mother keeps talking to me in Bengali and I pick up some lines. Ar kichhui 

naa?

How has the change in image in Tumsa Nahin Dekha 

changed your film career?

 I was more glamourous in Tumsa Nahin Dekha but it?s not that I haven?t played a glam babe before. What the film has done though has branded me as a performer. I have also realised that one can be a thinking actress in an out-and-out entertainer. I am going to apply that in my forthcoming projects.

 So now has the media started taking you more seriously as an actress?

 Post Tehzeeb, both the media and the audiences have started appreciating me more. It feels a lot better, for sure?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Supermarkets soar on necessities

 - Product range, pricing, accessibility amp; customer service spur mart boom

 The touch-feel experience of organised food retail is fanning a supermarket revolution. A Telegraph picture

 When Wal-Mart displaced oil major Exxon Mobil as the world?s largest company, logging sales of $219 billion in fiscal 2001, it was propelled largely by its emphasis on food and groceries. Back home, that sales solstice seems to have been driven home. For Calcutta now sits on the doorstep of a supermarket revolution.

 With more and more consumers in the city in sync with the touch-feel experience of organised food retail, as opposed to the neighbourhood kirana store, supermarket chains are scrambling to dig into Calcutta?s FMCG and grocery market.

 According to Anuj Puri of Chesterton Meghraj, the national footplate requirement for supermarket outlets in 2005 would be around 500,000 sq ft, with Calcutta accounting for at least 10 per cent.

 ?These formats stand out in terms of product range, pricing, customer service and convenience points, location and accessibility. Customers find such stores more reliable in terms of quality and quantity of the products,? feels Sidharth Pansari, director of the Wot Not chain, which opened its new 5,500-sq-ft outlet on VIP Road last Sunday.

Food Bazaar from the Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd 

stable, which launched its VIP Road supermarket inside Big Bazaar before Pujas 

2002, has recorded a 350 per cent sales growth. The Food Bazaar outlets at 22 

Camac Street and Alipore opened earlier this year, are looking at a steady Rs 

8 crore a year, while the newest stop in the chain anchoring Hiland Park?s mega 

mall Metropolis hopes to top Rs 9 crore.

 quot;This is just the tip of the iceberg and we will 

see a burst of growth in the supermarket segment, quot; says R.S. Rekhi, head, 

operations (east), Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd, owners of the Food Bazaar brand.

The ambience, variety and offers make it exciting 

for the consumer, while for the retailer, the sheer volumes make it worth the 

while.

C3, which harps on its triple trumps of cost, 

convenience and comfort, has grown from Rs 60 lakh to Rs 1.25 crore sales 

per month at its City Centre outlet in five months. The footfall touches 4,500 

over weekends, with quot;an 82 per cent conversion quot; rate, according to director 

Rohan Ghosh.

At Food Bazaar, 60 per cent of the footfall comprises 

home-makers. quot;For the housewife, whatever she saves through he schemes, is 

what she contributes to the family kitty and she has the satisfaction of providing 

a pasta or pizza meal at home at a fraction of eating out costs, quot; observes 

Rekhi.

Harsh Rungta, who set up Nice n Fresh 

with wife Nidhi in 2001, feels the Calcutta consumer, now exposed to the format 

of all daily needs under one roof, is ready to grow the market, and fast.

A shift to packaged foods is also helping the supermarket 

format grow through brands big and small. And with the average food spend per 

family unit being pegged at 22 per cent of the monthly budget, the daily-need-driven 

supermarket is on a retail roll.

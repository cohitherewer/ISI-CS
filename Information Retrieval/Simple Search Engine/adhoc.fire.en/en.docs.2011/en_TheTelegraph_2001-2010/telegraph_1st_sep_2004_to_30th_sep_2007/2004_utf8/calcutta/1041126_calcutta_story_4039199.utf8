 CU readies set-up on campus

 - Bio-tech research centre

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Even as the state government dithers on the location of the Centre for Excellence in Bio-technology, a pet project of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Calcutta University is readying to start operation at its research centre in genetic engineering and bio-technology.

 Named after scientist B.C. Guha, the centre on the Ballygunge Science College campus is equipped with all infrastructural facilities required for world-class research in the subjects, claimed the authorities.

 After the chief minister announced his plans on the bio-tech institute two years ago, the university had requested the government to set it up at BC Guha Centre for Genetic Engineering and Bio-technology. 

 But with the state bio-tech council still sitting on the proposal, the university has decided to move ahead and start the BC Guha Centre on its own. The state council has been set up recently to frame policies on the study of bio-technology. 

 ?We are determined to start operations at our centre within the next six months. We cannot delay the implementation of the project any further, especially when universities outside the state are laying tremendous emphasis on the study of bio-technology,? asserted dean of technology D.J. Chattopadhyay earlier this week.

 Once the centre starts operations, the university hopes its scholars and scientists will not face any difficulty in conducting research of ?extremely high standards? in bio-technology and genetic engineering.

 ?The laboratories that are being set up can be compared with the best in the world and we hope to attract scholars not just from our country, but from abroad, too,? Chattopadhyay said. 

 The research will focus mainly on medicine and agriculture, the official said. ?Our emphasis will be on research in pharmaceuticals, particularly anti-viral drugs,? he added.

 The university, according to Chattopadhyay, plans to spend Rs 5 crore to make the BC Guha Centre functional. 

 The state government has granted Rs 1.05 crore and the Centre Rs 25 lakh. The amount has been spent for constructing a new floor at Ballygunge Science College, covering more than 16,500 sq ft. 

 ?We have received a substantial amount from several agencies and are approaching many more for funds,? elaborated a university official. 

 A senior official attached to the state council for bio-technology said several meetings have been held to discuss the policies to be adopted for guiding bio-technology research. 

 According to him, the council was taking time to draft the policies because each needs to be framed keeping the Centre?s guidelines in mind.

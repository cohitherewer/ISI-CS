The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Creative amp; management success

 Small sports:It was the first annual sports 

day in the little lives of the toddlers of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, as 

well as that of the young school, at Yuva Bharati Krirangan. They had funky headgear 

and colourful outfits to provide just the right doses of fun. The tiny tots learnt 

all about competition, but winning or losing took second place to participating 

in the proceedings 

So you?re all revved up about the script, got your 

lines right after struggling for days and managed to make time for rigorous rehearsals 

everyday, in spite of academic and other pressures. Now it?s the time to find 

sponsors so that you can, well, perform. And this is the main hurdle most young 

theatre enthusiasts face. Thus, the need to merge theatre and creativity with 

effective management to give the product (the play) the necessary push.

 Underlining this requirement, city-based theatre group Theatrecian had organised a two-day workshop on September 12 and 19 for the cast and crew of two of its forthcoming plays. There were around 30 participants from various city colleges like JU, NUJS, SRFTI and St Xavier?s. The drama workshop was conducted by Dhruv Mukherji, a prominent face in the English theatre circuit in Calcutta. The management workshops were conducted by Kanak Gupta, a founder-member of Theatrecian, freshly arrived from a management course in Germany. 

 One of the exercises had one group trying to convince the sponsors about a play, with the other group acting as the sceptical sponsors. ?Unless we take ourselves seriously, others won?t,? reasoned Kanak, stressing on why performers need to charge a certain amount, no matter what their age. Gargi Sen, a second-year Xaverian, added: ?Theatrecian attempts to pay not just the actors, but also the crew. It tries to be professional despite the performers and crew mostly comprising college students.?

 The theatre component conducted by Dhruv involved students improvising on their parts through actions. The emphasis was on concentrating on and developing expressive body language. There were rounds that required one to think fast and develop immediate reflexes, a necessity for any stage actor. According to Tathagata Chowdhury, another founder-member of Theatrecian, ?We have always wanted to graduate from being a city theatre group to an entertainment house. This workshop is a step in that direction.? For now, the members of the theatre group are working on two productions, Tom Stoppard?s The Real Inspector Hound directed by Dhruv and Sartre?s The Respectable Prostitute to be directed by Tanusree Das.

Foundation of hope

 Fun and frolic, laughter and games, are a part of most children?s lives. But not those who work for a living. Hope Kolkata Foundation gave vent to the feelings of child labourers with a kite-flying event in Deshapriya Park on Anti-Child Labour Day, which coincided with Vishwakarma puja on September 17.

 To spread awareness about child labour, the numerous kites made by the NGO carried pictures and messages like ?Asho mukta karo? and ?Give them a chance to realise their full potential?. The pictures portrayed the dismal and cruel conditions that the children often have to work in.

 Earlier, the inauguration at the NGO?s office, on Panditya Street, saw chief guest actor Arindam Ganguly breaking into song. The programme included a dance performance based on Brishti Chhore, followed by kite flying.

 Another NGO attempted to make a difference in young lives with a confidence camp earlier this month. Satya Anusandhan (Gurukul), based in Narendrapur, conducted a weekend learning camp for children between six and 12 years old. As part of its organised camps, the monthly workshops have themes like building self-confidence, developing concentration and physical and mental fitness. 

 The participants included students from CIS, MB Girls?, MP Birla Foundation and GD Birla Centre. Conducted by founder Kollol Sen Gupta and psychologist Pramila Agarwal, the workshop laid stress on group discussion and articulation.

Cut-throat careers

 How to get a job ? one that you want and like ? was the focus of the workshop. No wonder then, that hundreds turned up to take notes. The means: a placement workshop for students of Calcutta B-schools, organised by the Consulting Club of IIM-C. The objective: honing soft skills to tackle GDs and interviews. The method: Ajoy Mohanty, GM (operations), Peopleone Consultants, and Soumen Roy, regional manager (Calcutta), Peopleone, as speakers. 

 Over 300 students participated from 20 B-schools in and around the city. The session for IIM-C students was held on a Sunday morning, followed by other B-schools in the afternoon. Some issues that the workshop touched upon were:

Industry-specific inputs, their requirements and prospects 

The importance of selling one?s CV, the window for a job-seeker 

Not to be ?Knowledge Benchers? but to be ?experienced on job mindset? 

Criticality of the first couple of minutes in an interview (body language, handshake, 

etc)

Mock interviews 

Self-actualisation vs self-esteem

 Mohanty emphasised the fact that one needs hands-on-training and a practical approach towards management. He also guided the students through how to go about developing resumes and stressed the need for synergy between the actual job requirements and the resume. 

 He gave valuable tips on how to face an interview. The GM stressed on honesty and frankness about one?s personality. The interviewer makes the judgment in the first two minutes of the interview and so, first impressions are crucial. He highlighted the importance of eye-contact and body language during an interview. Mock interviews for the participants followed. 

 Mohanty also pointed students in the right direction regarding which companies to apply for jobs and the characteristics of each sector. He spoke about choosing jobs compatible with one?s personality and strengths and not to be swayed by salary.

 Healing Touch: The Heritage School gave 

its students and their parents a chance to heal the body, mind and soul through 

a three-day yoga session recently. Conducted by a yoga expert from Surat, the 

first such initiative aimed at rejuvenation by reducing stress and fatigue, as 

well as improving concentration and chronic ailments.

Girl power

 It was an eventful week for Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan (BSS). At the TOPS (The Telegraph Open-quiz Show), the all-girl team, Amen, qualified for the finals from among 600 other, eventually ranking fifth.The team comprised Angana Deb, Priyadarshini Rakshit and Preyoshi Ganguly .Whilst the former two are ex-students, Preyoshi from Class XI floored the opposition answering Derek O?Brien?s poser: ?What advice did Carl Lewis give Brett Lee to improve his bowling?? Answer: ?Take your run up with your eyes shut.? 

 In a debate packed with young brilliant minds and forceful speakers from 12 city schools, Prachi Pritam Jha of BSS was adjudged the best speaker. The debate was co-sponsored by the United Nations High Commission For Refugees and held at the Assembly House. The topic was: ?India must have a national law for refugees?. 

Joyeeta Neogi,

Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan 

 On another creative note, this was also Utkarshan 

month at BSS, the annual school fest. There was a pleasant twist to the events, 

with each participating school asked to bring some under-privileged children on 

behalf of the school?s Interact Club. U-nision was a special dance show by these 

youngsters, and a sit-and-draw competition had also been organised for them.

 The fashion show, U-topia, of course, had the highest audience numbers (the budding fashionistas of Calcutta Boys? bagged this prize). The debate, U-turn, too, drew adequate attention. The topic revolved around dictatorship in India, capital punishment, etc. Each participant had to speak for and against the motion. Besides the main events, nonsense rhymes, script-writing, tattooing, dress and jewellery designing and more were also part of the fest. 

 The champions? trophy was won by St Thomas? Boys, followed by BSS and Calcutta Boys?. The hosts with the most, however, handed over the prize to Calcutta Boys? and as a result, St John?s Diocesion came in third. The event ended with a band entertaining us with Hindi and Bengali tunes.

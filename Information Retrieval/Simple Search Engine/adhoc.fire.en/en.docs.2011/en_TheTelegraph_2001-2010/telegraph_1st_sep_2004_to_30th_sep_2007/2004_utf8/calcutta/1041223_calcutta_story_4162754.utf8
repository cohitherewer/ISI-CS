 Wipe-out whip on virtual gambling

 OUR BUREAU

 The crackdown on online lotteries could culminate in a clean-up. The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government vowed on Wednesday to ?wipe out? the online lottery business from Calcutta and elsewhere in Bengal.

 In a slam job over the past four days, over 1,000 outlets ? nearly 50 per cent in Calcutta ? have been closed down, 1,108 machines seized and nearly 100 people arrested in and outside Calcutta. Of the total cases filed, 453 involve operators in Calcutta.

 State finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Wednesday about 85 per cent of online lottery operations had been stopped. ?The crackdown will continue till we have wiped out this menace,? he stressed.

 Dasgupta blamed online lotteries for turning many people into virtual gamblers. ?So many families have been brought to the brink of starvation and many people have committed suicide after putting all their money into these lotteries,? alleged the minister.

 The director of state lotteries lodged 112 complaints with the police on December 20 and 21 against agents, traders and others involved with 11 online lottery companies operating in the state. ?None of the lotteries was abiding by the rules prescribed by the government,? Dasgupta stated.

 The 11 companies under fire are Playwin, Smartwin, Lotto, Super Lotto, Smart Lotto, V1, Dhandhanadhan, Technost, Sunshine, Classic ON-line and Lotus.

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday, however, asked police not to harass retailers of online lotteries or seize their articles without serving proper notice, in accordance with law. In an interim order, Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh also made it clear the state had the liberty to take legal action against retailers.

 The order follows a writ petition by Calcutta Online Lottery Authorised Retailers? Welfare Association alleging police atrocities and harassment of its members since Sunday.

 ?Police are attacking my clients and disrupting the peaceful running of businesses,? association lawyer Madhumita Basu told the court, adding that the business conducted by her clients was legal. The matter will come up for hearing on January 11.

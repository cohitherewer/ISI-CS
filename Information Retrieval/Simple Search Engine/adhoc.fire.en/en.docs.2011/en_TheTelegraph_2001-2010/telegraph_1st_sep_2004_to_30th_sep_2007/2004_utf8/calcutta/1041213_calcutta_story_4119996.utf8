The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Quality checks and balances

 V.K. SEHGAL, deputy director of Bureau of Indian Standards (eastern zone), met readers of The Telegraph at his office on December 2. 

Participants included Sandip Banerjee, S. Sengupta, Dipak Kujur, Animesh Ghosal, Arunangshu Maity and Jitendranath Das

Jitendranath Das: If anyone designs a new machine or apparatus and wants to start commercial production, does he need your clearance certificate?

 Yes, to start commercial production of any such item one has to get our clearance. Once we test it and find its performance satisfactory, we stamp it OK and put an ISI mark. One may approach our public relations officer for guidance on the procedure. However, in case of some machines, like automobiles, one also needs clearances and certificates from other agencies to ensure that several other parameters are met.

Arunangshu Maity: Can you take a suo motu step to prevent misutilisation of the quality control stamps? 

 We often conduct raids in various markets and commercial establishments to check the products on sale. Earlier, we used to collect samples at random from the production units to assess the quality. But as the consumers buy the products from the market and retail stores, we think market samples give the correct picture about the product quality.

Arunangshu Maity: What about standardisation of imported goods?

 You have raised a very important issue. In this era of globalisation and liberalisation, it is very hard to monitor the standard of the products that are brought in from outside the country. Thus, checks at the units manufacturing such products is beyond our jurisdiction. But once they are on sale in the local markets we can check their quality. 

 We have specified a few goods that have to go through mandatory checking. A company has to obtain a licence if it desires to market a good listed under mandatory-checking. For goods under the non-mandatory checking category, either the manufacturer or the importer can obtain the licence. Thus, either way, the goods manufactured outside the country get a standard certification mark before being sold here.

Sandip Banerjee: How long does it take to get a clearance from your organisation?

 Under ideal conditions, we issue the licence within 120 days of application. But often we have to consider the shelf-life of the product and other parameters which lengthen the process. However, all these are part of our strict investigation methods. We generally issue a licence for a year and it can be renewed annually. In some cases, we also issue licences for two years. That, too, requires renewal. 

S. Sengupta: Do you have any provision for certifying eco-friendly goods?

 Yes, we do. To certify standard eco-friendly goods we imprint the picture of an earthen pot along with the usual ISI mark. Such marks are essential when the products are to be exported, since many countries have strict norms on the quality of goods they import. 

 We generally apply these certification standards to products that release pollutants during operation. The mark indicates the product is eco-compatible. We also have an environment management certification system where we follow IS/ISO 14000 standards under the BIS Act, 1986.

Arunangshu Maity: Does the BIS have any helpline or website for manufacturers and consumers? 

 Our website, www.bis.org.in, enlists the norms that are to be followed by manufacturers and consumers. A well-maintained section in the website helps find a certified seller of a particular product. We also have a full-fledged consumer affairs department to look into consumer grievances.

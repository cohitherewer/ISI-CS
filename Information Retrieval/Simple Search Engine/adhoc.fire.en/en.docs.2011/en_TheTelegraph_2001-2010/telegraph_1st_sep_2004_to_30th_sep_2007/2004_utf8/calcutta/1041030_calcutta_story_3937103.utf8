 Varsity sleaze panel draws a blank

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University?s sexual harassment cell hasn?t recorded a single complaint over the past three years 

 Three years after constituting a committee to deal with sexual harassment, Calcutta University has discovered that there is total lack of awareness among all students, teachers and employees about the panel?s functioning.

 Taking note of the fact that not a single complaint has been lodged with the committee, the university, for the first time, has undertaken a series of programmes to create awareness about sexual harassment and how to prevent it.

 ?We want students, teachers and employees to immediately report to the committee if they face any kind of sexual harassment. The idea behind setting up the committee was to prevent incidences of such harassment. The purpose will not be served if people keep silent even after facing harassment,? said Ishita Mukherjee, convener of the committee and a senior teacher in the economics department. 

 The university will send circulars to the heads of all departments, asking them to explain to their colleagues and students the details of the functioning of the committee.

 Placards and posters with slogans against sexual harassment are being prepared for display on various campuses of the university. Workshops and regular meetings with the students, teachers and employees will be organised to discuss the issue.

 Sixty per cent of the students in the university (10,000) are women. Females comprise one-third of the teaching staff (700) and other employees (2,700). 

 ?We will ask them (students, teachers and employees) not to feel scared to report their complaints. We also want to tell them that they should not take advantage of the situation and approach us with false complaints,? a university official said. 

 Even though no one in the university has lodged a complaint with the committee, officials said they have heard of stray cases of sexual harassment on the various campuses over the past three years. 

 This has prompted the authorities to draw the conclusion that there is a total lack of awareness among students, teachers and employees about the committee. 

 According to the existing provisions, anybody facing sexual harassment can directly approach the committee, which was set up following a Supreme Court order.

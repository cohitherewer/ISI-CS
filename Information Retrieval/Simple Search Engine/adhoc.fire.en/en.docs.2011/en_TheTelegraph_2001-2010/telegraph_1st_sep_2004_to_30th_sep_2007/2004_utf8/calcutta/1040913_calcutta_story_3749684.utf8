 Round-the-clock repair of lines

 - 20,000 phones restored in gutted exchange

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Working on a war footing, Calcutta Telephones has managed to restore 20,000 lines of its Chittaranjan exchange ? one of the highest revenue-earning exchanges covering parts of Burrabazar and other key hubs. 

 A devastating fire on the afternoon of August 28 damaged 27,000 lines of the exchange.

 ?We have restored 20,000 lines. The rest will be restored soon,? CalTel chief general manager S.P. Chakraborty said on Sunday. ?Several teams have worked round-the-clock on an emergency basis to repair the lines,? he said.

 The exchange covers parts of Burrabazar, Posta, Nimtala and other places. Medical College and Hospital, too, is served by the exchange. 

 On August 28, a fire broke out in the Direct Internet Access System unit and was put out by a fire extinguisher. However, officials said, by that time the fire had spread to the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) ? the platform between the exchange equipment site and the subscriber site ? and the primary cable was damaged, affecting 27,000 lines of the exchange.

 It usually takes six weeks for setting up an MDF jumpering for a similar number of telephone lines. ?For the Chittaranjan exchange, we have taken up the work on a war footing in three shifts,? a CalTel official said. Staff from other exchanges too, had been put to work to expedite the repairs. ?Our target is to complete the restoration work in three weeks,? he said.

 According to the official, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) suffered a major loss due to the fire in the exchange, covering the business hub of the city. ?An in-depth inquiry has been launched to find out whether there was any fault in the fire-extinguishing device,? he said. 

 Questions have been raised on why there had been no early detection of the blaze, in spite of BSNL?s robust smoke and fire alarm systems. 

 Most of the damaged and burnt cables have been replaced and both internal and external wires and cables have been changed by connecting them to a distribution frame and terminal box. New remote line units (RLU) have been set up at Medical College, Nimtala and Posta. New cable pairs have been provided to all the lines and jumpering work is underway. CalTel has made special arrangements for Nandaram Market, where all 400 lines have been replaced.

 CalTel is also providing Wireless Local Loop instruments and SIM cards free to subscribers whose lines were damaged. Only local calls are being charged till the lines are restored. Twelve PCOs have been set up in these areas for subscribers to make free local calls. Senior officials, including the chief general manager, visited the exchange to supervise repair work.

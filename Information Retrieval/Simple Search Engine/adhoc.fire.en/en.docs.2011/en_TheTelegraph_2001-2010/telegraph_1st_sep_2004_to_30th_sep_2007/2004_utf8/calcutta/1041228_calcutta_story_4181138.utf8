 A STAFF REPORTER

 National Library, which used to be the seat of Warren Hastings in the 18th century 

 Alipore nestled amid greenery is today the home of some of the biggest industrialists of India. Except for the names of the roads, many of which have been arbitrarily changed over the years, there is little left to remind one of the colourful Brits who lived there and their escapades.

 Only National Library and Viharilal College of Home Science (the reputedly spooky Hastings House) stand as monuments of the past.

 P. Thankappan Nair, better known as the ?barefoot of historian of Calcutta?, brings back to life the romance and intrigue associated with this exclusive neighbourhood in his latest book entitled Echoes from Belvedere: Home of National Library, Kolkata.

 This book grew out of a lecture by Nair in 2002 at National Library, which is more than 250 years old. Nair himself makes no claim to originality but it is definitely a fascinating compendium of material culled from various sources, some of which has come to light over the past 100 years. It builds up the history of the Belvedere Mansion (later National Library) and the sprawling 400-bigha Belvedere Estate that belonged to Warren Hastings.

 The sub-headings themselves provide an insight into the kind of material one can find in the kind. The chapter on the Belvedere deals with its ownership (it was gifted to Hastings by Mir Jafar Ali Khan, who after his deposition from the throne of Murshidabad came to live in Alipore), its sale, condition in the 19th century, and its transformation into the official residence of the lieutenant-governors of Bengal.

 What livens up these dry facts are interesting details like the list of artefacts in the mansion, the thefts that occurred there, the garden parties held in its sylvan surroundings and other interesting episodes in its long and eventful history up to the 20th century. Relevant newspaper clippings, too, have been reproduced. From the descriptions of entertainments alone one can figure out the leisurely pace of life then.

 Then comes the notorious duel between Hastings and his arch-enemy Philip Francis. The incident is retold in the words of the principal participants. We are also introduced to the raving beauty Madam Grand, later the wife of Talleyrand, immortalised by her famous portrait by Joshua Reynolds. 

 Similarly, the histories of other landmarks such as the Alipore Judge?s Court and the Agri-Horticultural Society are carefully documented, albeit from archives.

 The book has a good collection of contemporary pictures of Alipore, some quite interesting, like the illustration of the duel. A print that appeared in The Illustrated London News shows the garden party in honour of the Prince of Wales. Underclad noble savages of indeterminate dance before the gathering covered from head to toe.

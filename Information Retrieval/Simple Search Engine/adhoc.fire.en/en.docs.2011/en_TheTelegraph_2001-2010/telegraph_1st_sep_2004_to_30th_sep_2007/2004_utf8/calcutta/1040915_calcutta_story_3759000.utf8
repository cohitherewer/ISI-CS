 The City Diary

 State home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and his counterpart from Assam are the two members of a central government delegation leaving for Dhaka on Wednesday to take part in bilateral talks. The talks will continue till September 17. ?I have been asked to join the delegation and it would be improper on my part to comment on the issues under the scanner,? Deb said. This is the first time that the home secretaries of the two states are taking part in Indo-Bangla talks. 

 One demonstrated a sense of timing, the other a lack of it. 

 hief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday reached Writers? Buildings early, leaving Trinamul Congress functionaries, who had threatened to stop him, dumbfounded. The protesters had reached the spot a little late. While Bhattacharjee entered office at 11 am, Mamata Banerjee?s brigade reached half-an-hour later. 

 he Trinamul supporters were protesting the poor law and order situation in the state and the introduction of the Pre-litigation Conciliatory Bill by the Left Front government.

 number of MLAs, including Sonali Guha and Paresh Pal, were forced into a police van and arrested. MLA Sovondeb Chattopadhyay later threatened that the group would come back anytime to block Bhattacharjee?s way to office. 

 A memorial meeting will be held at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy at 4.30 pm on Wednesday to mourn the death of Pandit A.T. Kanan. The leading Hindustani classical musician was one of the founders of the Calcutta Music Circle. He was also among the first gurus to join the ITC Sangeet Research Academy. 

 The dais from which the chief minister was scheduled to address a rally in Mukundapur, in Tiljala, started wobbling dangerously moments before he arrived on Tuesday evening. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee went there to inaugurate a post office. Only four persons, including Bhattacherjee, could sit on the dais, instead of the scheduled 12. District magistrate (South 24-Parganas) Vivek Kumar said he would send a report to the state home secretary. Last month, at a Mamata Banerjee rally in Midnapore, the stage had collapsed along with the speakers.

 Air link to Aizawl was cut off for the second successive day on Tuesday due to bad weather in the Mizoram capital. Alliance Air cancelled two flights to Aizawl, including one on Monday, because of poor visibility, an Indian Airlines spokesman said. Two flights from Agartala were combined into one as there were not enough passengers, officials said. The plane took off from Agartala shortly after 5 pm. 

 In a bid to save waterbodies and wetlands from promoters and to maintain the area?s eco-balance, the Joka Organisation for Protection of Environment and Development will organise an awareness programme on Wednesday at the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta. Justice Shyamal Sen, chairman of the state human rights commission, will be chief guest.

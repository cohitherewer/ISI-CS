The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Service with a smile

 Tourists splash water at a roadside tubewell. They should feel more at home in Calcutta once the taxi-drivers and tour escorts are trained. A Telegraph file picture

 Too much to ask for? Not if an orientation programme kicked off by the Centre and aimed primarily at the unorganised sector in the citys tourism industry has its desired effect. 

 The capacity-building scheme for service providers, an initiative of the Union ministry of tourism, seeks to sensitise the first points of contact for in-bound tourist traffic in Calcutta so that visitors feel at home.

 Conducted by the city office of India Tourism, the programme is targeted at taxi-drivers, airport security staff and trolley retrievers, unapproved tour operators, approved guides, zoo officials and employees of interest points like Science City and Nicco Park.

 Its important for them to be gracious and raise basic service levels so that tourists feel looked after and want to come back or spread the good word about Calcutta, which is crucial for changing perception. We want the service providers to be better aware of the product so that they can improve it, explains Alka Kohli, regional director (east) India Tourism.

 The capacity-building effort has already covered more than 1,700 cabbies in Calcutta, impressing upon them the need to be honest and helpful, maintain their vehicles well, wear clean uniforms and not flout traffic rules. 

 Sawariyon ke saath achha sulook karna zaruri hai (Its important to behave well with passengers), admits taxi-driver Mintu Yadav, who has benefited from the project carried out in tandem with the public vehicles department and traffic police.

 The 50-odd tour escorts, who attended a dissertation session at the India Tourism office recently, were briefed in detail on the essential dos and donts in the tourist trade. 

 Guest speakers Abhimanyu Niyogi, senior manager, Royal Calcutta Golf Club, and conservation architect Manish Chakraborti dwelt on the need to be aware and proud of the citys heritage hubs.

 A checklist of good practices has been read out to airport security, immigration and housekeeping staff too, in the presence of senior Indian Airlines officers. A separate programme is being drawn up for tourist taxi-drivers and front-office staff members of travel and tourism agencies.

 Our principal thrust is on proper etiquette and polite disposition, qualities which the unorganised sector often lacks, says S.R. Pal, tourist information officer at the India Tourism city office. Other tourist tips include health and personal hygiene, basic service techniques, garbage disposal, first-aid, basic nutrition values, basic tourism awareness, communication skills and behaviour skills. The training has to be a continuous process, concludes Kohli.

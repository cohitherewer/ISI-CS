The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High road to highway takes a bow

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Four days after the Lake Gardens flyover was thrown open in south Calcutta, another flyover at Mourigram, in Howrah, was unveiled on Tuesday. 

 The 50-m flyover will help ease traffic congestion at the Mourigram level crossing leading to Vidyasagar Setu on one end and National Highway 6 (Bombay Road) on the other.

 Inaugurating the flyover, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the road has fulfilled a long-standing demand of people of Howrah. 

 ?I myself got stuck in jams several times at the Mourigram railway crossing on my way to Uluberia,? Bhattacharjee said. The flyover will boost the utility of the two truck termini at Dhulagarh and Kona Expressway, he added.

 According to the chief minister, the flyover, constructed at a cost of Rs 11 crore, was aimed at infusing speed into the traffic movement from Howrah to National Highway 6. 

 ?We are in need of more flyovers for smoother flow of traffic. Nobody will be interested in investing in Bengal until the traffic system is improved,? he observed. Another flyover would come up at Dankuni, in Hooghly, shortly, he announced.

 Criticising the railways for not releasing enough funds for the project, the chief minister pointed out that he had received a little over Rs 1.52 crore from them. 

 R.R. Bhandari, general manager, South Eastern Railway, intervened to say that the sum was actually Rs 3 crore.

 Tech boost for city traveller

 Australian adventure: Sydney?s Opera House is a bigger draw for Calcuttans than the rest of the country

 Imagine booking your honeymoon holiday with a travel agency and getting a reminder for your first anniversary, with updates on new packages and offers. That?s what Gainwell Travels and Tours promises its customers. 

 Calcutta travel agents are catching up with their Mumbai and Delhi counterparts when it comes to being IT savvy. The computerised reservation system, courtesy global distribution systems like Amadeus and Galileo in India, have been around for a while. But it?s the back-office solutions and customer-care software that are now popular.

 During a recent roadshow in town, Amadeus held workshops to educate travel agents about IT services. The response and awareness were ?phenomenal?, said Karun Bhudraja. ?All the small guys were there, asking intelligent questions. In fact, Calcutta agents bought 18 to 20 of our back-office solutions in three months, more than from any other city. E-ticketing and SMS services have picked up very well here,? he observed. ?The traveller is no longer just a passenger, he is a customer.?

 Accounting software, graphical virtual tours inside aircrafts and cruise liners, customer-friendly programmes ? they?re all on offer, and agents are lapping them up. ?We made our back office IT-enabled last year, but it?s an ongoing process,? said Manoj Saraf, managing director, Gainwell. ?It?s expensive, so not everyone can afford it, but it?s the way forward.?

 Corporate travel company Globe Forex and Travels is in the process of revamping its entire system to make it IT-based. ?We have clients like IBM and Hewlett Packard, who are very strict about that. Every step has to be computerised, from booking to billing. We are going to introduce a system of credit billing soon,? explained Sanjoy Sett, chief of Globe Forex.

 Customers, too, are learning. Holiday-makers have started booking way in advance, to take advantage of apex fares and discounts. ?Puja travel was up by 25 per cent, which is phenomenal,? said Fredrick Divecha, senior vice-president, outbound travel, SOTC. ?Since people are planning in advance, there are bookings till mid-March. People are holidaying more and spending more.? 

 Apart from the usual suspects of Southeast Asia and Europe, Gainwell has had bookings for Egypt, Kenya, South Africa and, in a first, Istanbul, Turkey. New Zealand and Australia might not be the norm for the rest of the country (distance factor), but Calcuttans seem undeterred. 

 ?People are learning to plan much better. So, when it comes to places like Australia and New Zealand, they prepare months ahead, especially budgeting, because they love shopping,? pointed out Sett, chairman, eastern region, Travel Agents Association of India.

 At the other end of the spectrum is Reuel Ghosh, managing director and founder of eRevMax, developing electronic revenue management maximisation software for travel companies. The three-year-old Calcutta-based company has so far been selling its wares abroad. But it now has new recruits, is all set to relocate to a new office in Sector V and release India-specific products in November.

 ?One website sells about 60,000 room nights a day in the US. Only about 50 of those are in India. Once Indian hotels and travel agencies go online, the number of bookings from US and European budget travellers will go up,? said Ghosh.

 What We are Watching

 Saas-Bahu Drama

Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi 

 This story of a powerful business family has been on air for the last five years. The saas-bahu drama was a trendsetter of sorts. The family is always going through trying times and the saviour is nation?s favourite bahu, Tulsi Virani.

 Catch it on Star Plus, Monday to Thursday, 10.30 pm

 Why bother? The cast comprises the who?s who of the small screen and no matter what happens on the show, the fortunes of the Ektaa Kapoor soap never seem to dip. From a humble bahu, Tulsi has now been transformed to the agony aunt who champions the cause of the underdog.

 Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki

 Take a happy family, add a couple of bahus, a gullible sister-in-law, an insecure mother-in-law and what you have is one of the most watched soaps on the telly.

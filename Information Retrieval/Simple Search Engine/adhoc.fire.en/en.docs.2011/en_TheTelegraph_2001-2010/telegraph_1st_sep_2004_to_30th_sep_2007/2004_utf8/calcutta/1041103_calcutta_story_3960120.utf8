The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 A yen for show, none to foot bill

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should the government sponsor a fireworks contest on Diwali to turn it into a tourist extravaganza? More letters will be published next week

 Why not? It would be really wonderful if there is a fireworks competition on Diwali with proper precautions under the patronage of the government. People should be able to watch the competition for a nominal fee. I am sure the proposal will be welcomed by all.

Piyal Mukherjee,

 Lake Town

 Arranging fireworks competition is not the responsibility of the government. Enough fireworks can be seen in the city on Diwali night. It should be kept in mind that a lot of people are reluctant to go out on Diwali as the fireworks are often loud and dangerous. To promote tourism, the government should ensure that the fireworks hazard is kept in check.

Debashis Pathak,

 Beleghata

 A government-sponsored fireworks contest on Diwali will surely attract tourists, especially those from abroad. Government patronage should also encourage manufacture of innovative fireworks. And this, in turn, will attract more tourists. The treasury, the fireworks industry and our environment will all benefit from such a contest.

Prashanta kumar Ghosh,

 Barasat

 Crores vanish into thin air all over India on the occasion of Diwali. If the government sponsors a fireworks contest to woo foreign tourists, more money will go up in smoke. The foreign exchange that we will generate from the event will not meet the cost of sponsoring such an extravaganza. It will be a costly farce. ?Save a farthing? should be the mantra of the cash-strapped government.

Arunava Bose chowdhury,

 Barrackpore

 Fireworks are harmful for health. Imposition of a ban on crackers has been yielding good results for the past few years. A fireworks contest sponsored by the government besides adding to the pollution, will encourage sale of crackers. It would be a highly unwelcome step.

Ranadip Ganguly,

 Diamond Park

 It would be wrong if the government sponsors a fireworks contest on the occasion of Diwali. Fireworks often cause hearing problems amongst the young and the old. Tourists should be attracted through less harmful ways.

Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepore

 A brilliantly lit sky on a single night and potholed roads, traffic jams, pollution, hawker-infested pavements, rickety modes of transport the morning after. That will certainly not enhance the tourist potential of the city one bit. Instead of wasting time and resources on such gimmicks, the government should try to improve the infrastructure of the city and ensure that the tourists do not get fleeced or exploited by the pimps, hoteliers, tour operators, guides and criminal elements.

K.P. Tulsiani,

 Elliot Road

 Our festivals are not only religious but also scientific. The use of firecrackers destroys disease-causing insects. Of course, fireworks can also harm human beings. To avoid that, they should ideally be used under government supervision. It will also help in attracting tourists.

T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge

 Yes, the government can arrange for a fireworks extravaganza at a central place to attract tourists to Calcutta. The ban on bursting ear-splitting crackers has definitely solved the problem of noise pollution but children don?t enjoy Diwali anymore. Along with the tourists, Calcuttans can also enjoy a fireworks extravaganza at a central location, if the government sponsors one. Why not reward the best three fireworks shows? The prizes could be sponsored by big companies, the way it was done for the lighting at Durga puja pandals and organising of dhakir lodais. Such a move will once again recreate the lost charm of the festival of lights in the city. With Kali puja just a few days away, the government needs to hurry if it wants to pull through such a plan successfully this year.

Ashok kumar Ghosh,

 CIT Road

 No, the money would go up in smoke, literally. However, tickets could be sold to such an extravaganza and the proceeds could be used for improvement of the city slums and for other benevolent activities.

Sohini Roy,

 If the government sponsors a fireworks contest on Diwali to turn it into a tourist extravaganza then the festival would lose its spontaneity. It will become just another organised event like a carnival. Gradually, the satisfaction and enjoyment derived from Diwali will be lost.

Tapan Pal,

 Batanagar

 What for? Are the tourists so gullible that they will come all the way to see a dud show? If the government is seriously interested in increasing the tourist inflow, it should concentrate on improvement of roads and the law and order first. When things as urgent as road repairs are being stalled for want of money, one wonders wherefrom all the money for a fireworks display will come. It is, after all, not another film festival, our chief minister?s pet programme, that the money will be sourced anyhow.

Sushma jalan,

 Alipore

 A fireworks contest is not the right way to turn our city into a tourist destination. To lure tourists, the government has to make the state attractive and safe enough for the people of other states and countries to troop in. A fireworks display would only add to the troubles of city dwellers. Not only would the air pollution level go up because of the smoke, the noise too would create a nuisance. This idea is best forgotten.

Abul Fateh Kamruddin,

 Hooghly

No government should ever venture into sponsoring 

such a fireworks contest. It has other important works to do ? to minimise the 

risk of fire and casualty thereof and close down unregistered and illegal fireworks 

manufacturing units. Sponsoring a fireworks contest will be a waste of funds from 

the government exchequer. A fickle-minded proposal of this nature will drain the 

tax-payers? money. Instead, the government can be a third party and keep vigil 

during such a contest. 

Subhanker mukherjee,

A magnificent display of fireworks will surely fascinate 

us all and will be an added bonanza for the tourists. But its insidious threat 

to life and property is often ignored. Many firecrackers create sound more than 

the permissible limit of 65 decibels. Besides, the hazardous air pollutants have 

a disastrous effect on our environment. Even if the fireworks contest is organised 

away from residential area, the air pollution will continue to be a threat. 

Satyen biswas,

 Behala

 The question is ridiculous. In these days when pollution has become a very vital issue such an idea should not be implemented. The tourists can continue enjoying viewing the Kali idol, decorated pandals and the rituals surrounding the puja. Many countries have a big fireworks display on particular occasions. Why would they come all the way to Calcutta to watch a similar show? The government need not indulge in such activities to attract tourists.

Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 Yes, it is a good idea as Bengal is lagging behind other states when it comes to attracting tourists. A fireworks festival can be arranged during Diwali keeping in mind the safety aspects. The state government can utilise the Maidan for the purpose. Such a festival would also provide a much needed boost to the fireworks industry. 

Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park

 It will be heartening if the government sponsors a fireworks contest after taking all the necessary safety precautions. Foreign tourists will definitely be attracted as they are always interested in our festivals. It is a really creative idea and the state government would do well to act on it.

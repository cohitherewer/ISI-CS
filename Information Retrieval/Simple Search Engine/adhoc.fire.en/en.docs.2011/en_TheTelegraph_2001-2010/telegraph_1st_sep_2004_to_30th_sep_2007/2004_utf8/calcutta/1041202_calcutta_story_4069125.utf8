The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Know your knot

From cartoons to crystals, funky to floral 

 the choice is wide when it comes to ties. Zeeshan Jawed checks it 

out

Ever seen how a conventional male shopper struts the 

shop floor? He heads straight for the shirt rack and picks a few at random ? clothes 

to cover up rather than look cool. Next stop pants section, for the customary 

dark pair that goes with everything. Then, he tosses in a few socks, maybe a handkerchief 

or two and? a tie on the way out. This is a source of mystery to some salespersons. 

After all, a tie is traditionally meant to reflect a man?s personality. In fact, 

in recent years, the key to corporate dressing has invaded several non-tie stops, 

and been paired with everything from fine-cut trousers to faded denims.

But the necessary accessory remains a somewhat neglected 

segment, complains the clothing industry. That is reflected in the racks ?the 

choice can be limited and the designs repetitive, if you don?t know where to look.

Here?s putting some thought behind tying the knot?

Match make

Before going on a buying binge, assess your profile 

and pre-requisites. If buying one burns a hole in your pocket, it doesn?t necessarily 

mean the tie is right for you. A lot depends on the shirt you match it with. Try 

a contrasting tie and avoid one with checks if you don a shirt with a similar 

pattern. The same goes for stripes. Experiments with tie truths go best with solid 

colours. Of course, the occasion dictates the dressing ? cocktail with golf buddies 

or board meeting with the boss. 

Tie buy

The knot at the neck can be split into two ? formal 

and evening gear. ?This season, keeping in mind lifestyle changes and international 

trends, Arrow has brought out a vibrant range of colourful ties to go with the 

style of today?s man,? says Janak Dave, business head, Arrow.

Formal ties are available in woven and printed silk. 

The speciality of these ties lies in the designs that have been intricately crafted 

by weaving of the silken fabric. The ties from Arrow are woven into a vibrant 

range of silk jacquards, dobbies and solid structures and are available in a range 

of colours. The line of printed silk ties is a colourful combination of lively 

prints, with bright red, magenta, tangerine, cool blue, turquoise, lime and light 

shades of grey, cream and brown all the rage. Black as the night or pristine white, 

bright prints or plain solids, bold stripes or intricate mosaics ? the choices 

are aplenty. The Arrow prices start at Rs 595. 

If you?re looking for some fashionable fun in the 

evening, slip into Satya Paul, at Forum. Priced at Rs 495, the hand-woven ties 

are available in funky designs of zigzag stripes, cartoons and other amusing and 

abstract prints. If you want to go garish, try ties with Swarovski embellishments, 

at Rs 1,495. If understated charm is more your style, turn heads with wooden ties 

designed by Kuber Sircar in Salt Lake. Informal ties are also available at Blackberrys 

and Provogue in the showrooms at Forum and City Centre. The designs in diagonal 

stripes, checks and floral prints are priced from Rs 695 upwards.

Do amp; don?t

Make sure the tie ends above your belt line. Tie pins 

were in vogue once upon a time, but not anymore, unless mandatory (if you?re in 

uniform).

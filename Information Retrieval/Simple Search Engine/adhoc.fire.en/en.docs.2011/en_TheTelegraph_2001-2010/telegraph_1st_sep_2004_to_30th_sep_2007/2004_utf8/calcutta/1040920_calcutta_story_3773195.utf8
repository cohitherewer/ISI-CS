The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Recently, I noticed a report in your newspaper about a boy drowning in a pond. 

While travelling by bus on Chowringhee Road, I noticed a newly-constructed pond 

in the open space opposite Tata Centre. There is no fence or railing around the 

waterbody and children playing nearby might accidentally fall into it. The pond 

must be fenced off before winter, when the Maidan is teaming with young boys who 

come to practise their cricket.

 Residents of Kidderpore, Garden Reach and Metiabruz and even outsiders working 

in the Taratala, Hide Road and Garden Reach areas, are inconvenienced due to the 

closing of the Westwood Bailey bridge. The swing bridge, as it is called, connects 

Garden Reach with Strand Road and provides a bypass to Kidderpore. The port authority 

has closed the bridge, ignoring the interests of office-goers. Now, all the pressure 

is on Nazrul bridge, which results in frequent traffic jams on the stretch during 

peak hours. Despite the hardship, local residents have waited patiently for the 

port authority to review its decision. But now the government should look into 

this matter and reopen the bridge after negotiating with the port authority.

 Residents of Babubazar, off Karl Marx Sarani, are the worst sufferers during 

monsoon. Since the area is low-lying, rain water easily accumulates on the roads. 

Occasional repairs to the drainage system has hardly made any difference. We request 

the CMDA to relay the drainage pipelines.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Vehicles on the Rajarhat Expressway have to contend with scores of cattle merrily 

obstructing their path. Instead of taking corrective measures, authorities have 

put up attractive boards along the road informing drivers of the presence of cattle 

as if the animals were part of the original plan and were meant to be there. Moreover, 

the road on the eastern flank is severely damaged and is a virtual death trap 

for unsuspecting drivers. I fail to understand why nobody is made accountable 

as the public pays a tax for the maintenance of roads.

 Bengalis are said to be very fond of theatre, but the turnout at the recently-held 

Natyamela at Rabindra Sadan was dismal. There were few enthusiasts at the inauguration 

on November 25. The current social trend shows that youngsters are more attracted 

to the electronic media. This will have an adverse effect on the existing and 

upcoming theatre groups. The government must encourage theatre in a big way. 

 Bhupen Bose, Address not given. 

 The price of tickets for cricket matches at Eden Gardens has been increased 

exorbitantly. During the last day of a Test recently held at the stadium, a considerable 

portion of gallery remained vacant. I presume the price hike might have kept the 

crowd away. The authorities should fix the ticket prices rationally so that cricket-lovers 

do not find them unaffordable. It surely doesn?t make sense if the prices are 

so high that tickets don?t get sold and seats remain vacant. 

 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

 Much is being said about the improved trade ties and medical tourism with Bangladesh 

but my recent visit to the country has made me pessimistic. Indian tourists, with 

valid travel documents, are being harassed by customs officials in Bangladesh. 

Even immigration officers at the Benapole border demand bribes. I was forced to 

cough up a ?tax? of Rs 300 on my way back to India. I have never heard of our 

government charging any tax from Bangladeshi tourists so it is high time that 

our neighbour also mends its ways.

 Kazi Kamruddin, Lalbazar Street. 

 BSNL claims to be improving its services every now and then. The fact is that 

the network problem has continued to bother subscribers from the very beginning. 

Such is the condition that the cellphones don?t work inside Emami Market, AC Market 

or any other crowded shop. Why is BSNL increasing its subscriber base when the 

current load is unmanageable? 

 Omkar Lal Das, Kidderpore.

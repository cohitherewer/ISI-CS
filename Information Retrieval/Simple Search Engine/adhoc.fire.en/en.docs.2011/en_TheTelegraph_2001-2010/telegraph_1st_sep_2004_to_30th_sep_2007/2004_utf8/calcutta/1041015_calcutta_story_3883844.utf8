 Puff protest earns girl sneers, slap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A college girl alleged on Thursday 

 that a school student beat her up for protesting his smoking 

 in an autorickshaw they were sharing. In her complaint lodged 

 with Bhowanipore police station, the girl alleged that the 

 student, riding with his friends ? all from a reputed south 

 Calcutta school ? were in the rear seat of the auto. They 

 first passed lewd comments at her and then, leaning forward, 

 slapped her repeatedly in full public view. She was beside 

 the auto driver.

 ?It is a serious complaint because 

 it relates to violence against a woman,? said Sanjay Mukherjee, 

 deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). According 

 to police, the daughter of a professor and a resident of 

 Rammohan Roy Road, in Behala, was on her way to Ballygunge 

 Phari from the Hazra crossing.

 Trouble started when one of the 

 three students ? all in their school uniforms ? lit up a 

 cigarette. According to her complaint, she first warned 

 the boy to stop smoking. ?Soon, an argument ensued. The 

 student called her names and suddenly slapped her. As she 

 screamed, he hit her again,? said a thana official.

 The auto came to a halt at the 

 Hazra Road-Sarat Bose Road crossing and the trio got off. 

 The girl went straight to Bhowanipore police station to 

 lodge her complaint. ?She could not identify the accused,? 

 said another thana official.

 Officer-in-charge of Tollygunge police station K.K. Patra, passing by, had seen the boy get off the auto after the altercation. ?He interrogated him, but by then, the woman had left. The boy told Patra he had hit her for slapping him first,? said a thana official.

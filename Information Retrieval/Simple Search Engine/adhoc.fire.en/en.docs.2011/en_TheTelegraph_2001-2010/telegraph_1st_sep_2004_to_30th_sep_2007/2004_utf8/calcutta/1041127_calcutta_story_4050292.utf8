 Reforms for Islam, caution note for India

 ?The message is right; the messenger is not,? Guy Sorman offers a wry smile speaking about the Americans waxing eloquent on the Arabs deserving democracy. The sociologist, recognised as a leader of new liberalism in France, has had the Arab problem at the top of his mind for some time. In fact, it was 9/11 and the consequences thereof that made him work on his latest book Rifaa?s Children.

 Sorman is in Calcutta for the launch of the English version of the work based on the life and thoughts of Egyptian reformer Rifaa, who was trained as an Imam. He spent seven years in France and returned to set up a school of languages and the first school for girls in Egypt. Rifaa ushered in the Muslim Renaissance that was destroyed in the 1950s and 60s. ?When my book came out in France last year, reviewers asked me where the moderate Muslims were and why they were not speaking up. I know of so many of them in Syria, Egypt? They are Rifaa?s children. But they are mostly jailed or repressed.?

 Sorman warns against coming to any conclusion about the aftermath of US action. ?It is too early to say that the Americans were wrong. Fifty years ago, nothing was moving in the Arab world. Now at least the despots will have to get on the development path.?

 Sorman is also opposed to the idea of Osama bin Laden being treated as a representative of Islam. ?Muslims in India, China or Malaysia, where democracies are thriving, are living in peace. Though Laden is being idolised by uprooted or unemployed youth elsewhere as well, we must not view an Arabic problem as one of Muslims as a whole. Nor is this a war between the West and the East. Laden wants to dethrone the king of Saudi Arabia, not the president of the US.?

 A member of France?s Commission of Human Rights, Sorman believes that a solution is possible within Islam. ?Radicalism was not born from the Koran but from circumstances.?

 On his fifth visit to the city, the former professor at Paris, Stanford, Cordoba (Argentina), Beijing and Moscow universities is happy to see his vision of India as an economic powerhouse, in his book The Genius of India, becoming a reality. ?The free market model is now working very well here. The fruits ? electricity, telephone, television ? are reaching remote corners. But in the long term, this can also lead to ecological disruption. India surely is not aiming for each of its one billion citizens to own a car. It has to draw the line somewhere. India has a tradition of economic reflection. Perhaps that will be the time to get back to Gandhi.?

 Speaking of Bengal, Sorman feels the Communists have managed to save their skin by changing their ideology. ?Politicians can be prisoners of their rhetoric. Even then it is good that they are part of the coalition government. This means they would need to be reasonable and realistic.?

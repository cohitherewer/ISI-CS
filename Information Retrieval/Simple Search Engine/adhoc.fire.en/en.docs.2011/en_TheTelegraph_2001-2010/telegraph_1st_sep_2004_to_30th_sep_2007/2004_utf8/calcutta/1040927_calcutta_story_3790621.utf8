The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Lzone: Hugli

MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 Calcutta may have a horribly neglected waterfront, but there is at least one destination in town that has tried to use the natural ambience of the river to maximum advantage.

 Hugli is a lifestyle boutique in Hastings Court, near Doi Ghat, trying to draw Calcutta out of its city-centre obsession with a fine collection of objects d?art, garments, jewellery and household items.

 The destination, less than a year old, boasts an exclusive collection culled from across the globe by its proprietor Madhulika Khaitan. Arts, crafts and designs from around the country are showcased beside some from Southeast Asia, and others from as far as Europe and Japan.

 Amongst the unusual choices here is a collection of silk jewellery from a south India-based designer. Silk threads are painted and wound together, set off by colourful beads in a range of trendy and affordable jewellery. Neckpieces and belts dominate the collection in an array of bright colours.

 By contrast, there is also a range of contemporary silver jewellery. For a departure from this sleek line designed for western sensibilities, there is a collection of tribal neckpieces and jewellery from Rajasthan. Hugli is also hosting an exhibition of antique precious jewellery designed by Nalini Panday.

Aart?s sake

 Over time, Hugli hopes to add to the understanding of our ethnic tradition. The long-term objective of the store is to help develop and support the dying arts. ?I would eventually like to form a trust that will showcase the best workmanship and crafts,? says Khaitan.

 It is important to give art its due in our country, she stresses. In terms of the store?s offering, an effort to distinguish Hugli products from the lifestyle heap is marked. ?The offering at our store is also more useful, rather than purely decorative,? she adds. Much of the stock comes from the south (the ?new design hub?) and Delhi.

Rrustic and rich

 An interesting combination of designer labels is on show besides more rustic creations. Clothes from Abraham and Thakore and Jason Cherian hang from Hugli?s stylish racks, as does a collection of clothes from Rajasthan, Auroville and the hill tribes of the Northeast.

 The boutique has a large collection of saris. Woven drapes with real zari, kotahs, chanderis, ikkats and jamdanis, all with a design edge.

At Home

But it is the household range that really stands out 

(pictures by Rashbehari Das). Starting with the reed baskets and vases from Thailand, 

woven from slender pieces of what resembles cane, except much finer. Wooden vases 

and bowls are also from Thailand, hand-picked by Khaitan on her travels.

 Stunning lacquer ware on bamboo and wood is also available here. Bright shades of blue and yellow are sure to pep up even the darkest room. Remarkable examples of tableware on wood with intricate batik work are on display ? mainly bowls, chopsticks and plates. 

 ?This kind of work originated in Japan and China, but now it is found widely in Vietnam too,? explains Khaitan. 

 assware from Europe and India can be found here in a range of colours and prices. Wicker baskets and mats, wooden trays and boxes, trendy handbags are all there to be picked up. 

 More funky examples include a rice bag fashioned into a casual purse, sequin-embellished mojris, candles, candle-stands and even an unconventional collection of books, making it a perfect destination for personal buying as well as gift-hunting.

 Khaitan hopes that Calcutta will wake up to the pleasures of leisurely shopping. ?I want it to become an experience. I would like people to come here and spend some time, have a cup of coffee and enjoy our collection,? she smiles.

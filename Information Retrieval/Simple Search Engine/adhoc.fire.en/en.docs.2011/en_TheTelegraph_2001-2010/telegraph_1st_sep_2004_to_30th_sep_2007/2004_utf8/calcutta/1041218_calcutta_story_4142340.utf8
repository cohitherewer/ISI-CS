The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Photo phones are a snap

 - Price drop pushes sales of snob-value spycams

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Starry lip lock or student sleaze, there is no pushing away the presence of camera phones any more.

 ?Colour and camera are critical when it comes to purchase of mobile phones these days,? confirms the spokesperson for a mobile handset manufacturer.

 ?Camera phones have seen double-digit and even triple-digit growth rates in some parts of the country in recent times,? says Mandar Bhide, regional manager (east and Bangladesh), Nokia. ?There are many moments in life when you wish you had a camera with you.? Having a phone to do the trick really helps in such times.

 Freeze frame is fine but the camera roll is even better. ?Most people who have a video-recording facility in their phones hardly use it,? says a Nokia dealer. ?It?s more of a snob value than anything else, but it certainly helps to impress those around you.?

The flaunt factor is fast turning into a way of life 

with price drop playing a major role in the popularity push.

 quot;Camera phone prices have come down by around 

50 per cent in the past six months, quot; says Jiten Chawla, a dealer of LG mobile 

phones.

Most phones with still image features start for as 

little as Rs 8,000 while those capturing video begin around Rs 11,000. Topping 

the buyer list are students and young executives. quot;Camera, FM radio and Bluetooth 

are the top draws for the youth, quot; says Chawla. quot;Often, they dont 

even bother about the main features of the phone if they like these. quot;

The second time buyer, going for an upgrade, forms 

the other big chunk. quot;Its a matter of going beyond voice, quot; explains 

Bhide. quot;Multimedia is where the action is, with enhanced networks and host 

of facilities offered by service providers. quot;

The only price to pay could be privacy. quot;Its 

great to have a camera in your phone but its also quite irritating to have 

someone click photos of you without your knowledge and consent, quot; says Priyadarshini 

Roy, a young executive and a camera-phone user.

The other grumbles have to do with picture quality 

and space crunch.

But as the speak-and-shoot phones become even more 

ubiquitous, greater space and video clarity could be the next frontiers of improvement 

for manufacturers.

 quot;The user would ideally want his phone to be 

as good as a digital camera, quot; says Bhide. quot;Phones with higher megapixel 

cameras may be up next. quot;

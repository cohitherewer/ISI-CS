 Domestics death sparks seven arrests

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Seven persons were arrested on Thursday in connection with the unnatural death of a 12-year-old domestic, Bhagwati Haldar, on Wednesday at Selimpur, in Kasba. 

 Sipra Das, a teacher and owner of the house where the girl used to work, was arrested for her alleged involvement in the death. 

 Five residents of nearby Netaji bustee, where the girl used to live, were held on the charge of ransacking the Das household, on suspicion the teacher had killed Bhagwati. 

 Samar Ghosh, a relative of the teacher, was arrested for attacking the bustee residents with a sharp weapon, said South 24 Parganas deputy superintendent of police (crime) Soma Das. 

 Bustee residents beat up Soumen Sarkar, another relative of the teacher, who, too, is allegedly involved in the girls death, early on Thursday. He is being treated at MR Bangur Hospital, from where Sipra Das and Samar Ghosh were discharged on Thursday morning, before being produced in the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate in Alipore. 

 The girls uncle, Amulya Haldar, has alleged that his niece used to be tortured and was ultimately killed and her body hung from the grille of the verandah in the Das house. Bhagwati used to live with him after her parents died. 

 Police said though Sipra was arrested on the basis of the uncles complaint, the murder charge against her will be dropped if the post-mortem confirmed suicide.

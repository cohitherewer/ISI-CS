The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Nazeeb Arif

 Secretary-general, Indian Chamber of Commerce 

 The state government has adopted a policy of deducting a day?s salary for non-attendance on a bandh day. If we check attendance figures in government offices on bandh days, it can be traced that of late, people have started voluntarily coming out and attending office despite the threat of bandhs. So, we have reason to believe that the carrot and stick principle is working here. But from the Chamber, we had suggested the deduction of one day?s leave with the objective of restraining people from enjoying a paid holiday. To counter a laid-back approach among employees, another method is used in most places, where people do not attend office on a bandh day, but work on a day over the weekend. But I admit that this principle cannot be followed in the government sector or say in factories, where it is difficult to compensate for a day?s loss.

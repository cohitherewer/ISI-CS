The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 More than skin deep

 With a name like Sex is Comedy, it?s hardly surprising when the film draws some of the longest queues at the 10th Kolkata Film Festival. Add to that word getting around that the director makes porn films back home and you?ve got a real pot-pourri.

 All this doesn?t catch French film-maker Catherine Breillat (picture below by Aranya Sen) by surprise. Despite establishing herself as a leading film-maker in Europe, with 10 films in a 30-year-old career, Breillat has been courting trouble since age 17. That was when she wrote her first novel L?homme facile and ran into censorship trouble. The book was banned for its sexual overtones in France for those under 18.

 Alongside writing some best-selling novels, Breillat has also penned scripts, including Federico Fellini?s And the Ship Sails On.

 While she shifted to films from novels, female sexuality remained her subject. Beneath the way-of-all-flesh hype, Breillat manages to upset and intrigue her audience about the hidden dimensions of female sexuality.

 Fat Girl (the other film being screened at the festival, in picture above) is about an obese 12-year-old?s fantasies and frustrations with sibling rivalry and sexual awakening of two sisters at the core. Sex is Comedy shows a film-maker struggling to shoot an intimate scene between an actor and an actress who happen to loathe each other.

 ?In fact, the idea for Sex is Comedy germinated while I was shooting a seduction scene in Fat Girl. I was feeling very strange then and I was scared to shoot those complicated scenes because you have many problems with actors,? says the Paris-based film-maker, in her mid-50s. So, ?in the mask of a comedy?, she chose to explore the power game at work within the confines of a film set in Sex is Comedy.

?I love to deal with taboo topics and want to show 

the contrary of obscenity. But France is scandalised and people hate me for the 

films I make. Censorship exists in France as well and it?s a constant battle,? 

is the candid confession from Breillat. 

?It was rigid back then when I wanted to make films. I also couldn?t enroll in a film school because the authorities believed women couldn?t become directors... It has been very difficult being a woman film-maker,? trails off Breillat, moving on to her fondness for Bunuel and Bresson.

 ?I also like the movies of Jackie Chan which are very crude but very sophisticated at the same time. And I love Elia Kazan and Hitchcock. But I need to protect myself from these influences to have my individual identity,? she adds.

 Calcutta has charmed her with its warm response ? not just the long lines for her films, but also the interactive sessions she has been having with the audience.

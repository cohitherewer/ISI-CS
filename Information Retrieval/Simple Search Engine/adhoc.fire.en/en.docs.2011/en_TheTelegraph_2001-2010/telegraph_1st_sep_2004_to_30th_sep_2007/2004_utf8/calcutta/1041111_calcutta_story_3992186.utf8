Meghe Dhaka Tara: Soulful struggle

 With only eight films in his 51 years, Ritwik Ghatak has left his admirers thirsting for ever more. On his 79th birth anniversary, Meghe Dhaka Tara ? the classic Ghatak considered to be his creative best ? was launched in a VCD version at a special gathering of the maestro?s family and friends.

 The unveiling captured some precious moments at Nandan with Ghatak?s film-maker friend Mrinal Sen strolling down memory lane. ?We used to have addas stretching for hours at an eating haunt near Hazra. Me, Ritwik, Tapas Sen and often Bijon Bhattacharya. We wanted to make films, but Ritwik was the most desperate of us all and had it in him to take huge risks,? reminisced Sen.

 Also present on the occasion were Supriya Devi (the leading lady in Meghe Dhaka Tara), Mahasveta Devi, Ghatak?s wife Surama and daughter Suchismita, Geeta Ghatak and Gita De. Canned in 1960, Meghe Dhaka Tara was restored in Germany and has been brought out by city-based Maxtech Entertainment.

 Here?s some more good news for all Ghatak fans ? VCDs of Nagarik, Komal Gandhar and Subarnarekha are also on their way to the stores.

Anu Malik: Straight talk

 The latest reality talent hunt show on the telly, Indian Idol has taken a great start and the small-screen industry is abuzz with its popularity among all age groups. One of the USPs of the show is definitely Anu Malik?s candid candour.

 ?Many people ask me why I am so tough on some of the contestants,? says the maverick music maker. ?Well, this is serious business. And a judge?s role can never be easy. True that there is a lot of enthusiasm and immense talent, but what I am looking for is the one who can move the nation with his or her voice.?

 At the launch of the show, Anu had said he was looking for a mix between ?Julia Roberts and Lata Mangeshkar?. But now what Anu wants above all is originality. ?After all, it is not about how well you can imitate Asha Bhonsle or Enrique Iglesias. To impress us you have to be yourself. We want to hear your voice and your style. Not someone else?s.?

 And Anu is not going to be less harsh on the participants. ?We had a job to do. And sometimes we have to be brutally honest. And that is what has got 129 finalists to Mumbai to embark upon their journey to stardom.?

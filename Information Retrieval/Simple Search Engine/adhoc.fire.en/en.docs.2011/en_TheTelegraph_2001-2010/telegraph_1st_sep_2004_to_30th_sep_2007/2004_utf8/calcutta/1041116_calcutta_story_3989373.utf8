 Tandoori chicken marinated in Thai spices, cooked in a clay oven and served with Mexican salsa. French cheese fondue served with Indian kebabs or chicken yakitori with Italian pasta and Thai curry sauce...

 A cross-culinary global trek is what KK?s Fusion, the 90-cover restaurant-lounge coming up next to 89 Cinemas this week, promises the Calcutta gourmand.

 ?For the first time in the city, people can enjoy Indian, Italian, Greek, Mexican, Chinese, Thai and fusion food under one roof outside five-star properties,? says Pradip Rozaro, celebrity chef and owner.

 The culmination of 10 years of research and extensive travel around the world, the ?dream project? of Rozario, formerly executive chef of Taj in Mumbai, brings to the table a fusion fest of assorted combos, designed ?to suit the local palate?. So, Dal Makhani is tossed in Italian pesto sauce or spaghetti in Chicken Butter Masala.

 The chef-owner, who set up Kurry Klub on Sarat Bose Road a decade ago to kick off his experimentation with fusion food, sees KK?s as an extension of that assay, on a wider scale and bigger footplate.

 ?The idea of fusion cuisine crossed my mind when a customer walked into Kurry Klub and asked for khichudi,? Rozario recalls. 

 The chef then rushed to the kitchen and rustled up khichudi, with ?maachh bhaja and aloo bhaja? to go with it. Thus was born Lentil Risotto, served with Fish amp; Chips in Szechwan Sauce.

 Bengalis love to experiment with food, opines the hands-on owner, who set up Mischief with Suniel Shetty in Hyderabad and designed the West Asian menu of the comeback Blue Fox.

 Boasting a platter of ?six distinctive kebabs from six different parts of the world?, KK?s Fusion has a 25-seater Celebratory Lounge on the mezzanine level, a waiting area, a bar, an interactive kitchen with a food bar and a buffet counter.

 The d?cor, by Vivek Rathore of Salient, is also a fusion of Greek, Italian, Spanish and Indian elements, with a predominance of blue, green and beige.

 Another ?unique feature? of KK?s Fusion is the kitchen laboratory where Rozario intends to carry forward his experimentation.

 ?Anyone can walk into the lab for a demonstration of the culinary process and ingredients and try out new combinations. It will be the stage for dress rehearsals when we are fine-tuning any dish,? says the chef.

 While lady waitresses and DJ music will liven up the Swabhumi address, also cooking is a string of food festivals ?with a difference?, for instance, a street food fest with a band party from Mahatma Gandhi Road playing popular filmi tunes.

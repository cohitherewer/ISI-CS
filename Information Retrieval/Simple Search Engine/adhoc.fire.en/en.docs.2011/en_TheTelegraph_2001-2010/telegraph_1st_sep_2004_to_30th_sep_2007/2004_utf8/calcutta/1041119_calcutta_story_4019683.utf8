The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

As you plan for the weekend ? extended, for those 

loathe to work on bandh Monday ? here are some pointers to keep alive the conversation 

as the embers die a slow death into the balmy autumn night?

Bandh banter

Wake up to the fact ? and fast ? that bandh bashing 

is the flavour of the season. With the city turning a corner and saying bandh, 

what bandh, on Wednesday, here?s your chance to rant against the bandh brigade. 

No full stops anymore could be your calling card, as you drop politically potent 

lines like: ?How will the CPM ever call another bandh? What will happen 

in the Mamata vs mass mandate showdown on December 3??

Topic tip: don?t mark Wednesday down as the bandh 

watershed; wait till the Trinamul bandh.

Skipper scrap

Dada did the dew to a rather slippery Jubilee Cup 

effect during the face-off with Pakistan on Id-eve. Side with the Supercat suspension 

slapped against Sourav (?Ganguly had it coming?, says the rest of Indian lobby),? 

or lambast Lloyd for his ?harsh? go-slow penalty. Either way, keep an eye open 

for Kanpur to be in the cricket loop.

Credit card 

If you?ve got it, flaunt it. If you haven?t, say you?re 

not in town this weekend. The invitation card to bless Lakshmi Mittal?s daughter 

matters more than any other piece of paper in the city?s biz circles.

Warm up

Woolly winters are yet to touch base with the city 

but the nip sure calls for cosy dos? under and above the blanket. Dig out spicy 

stories from the past and the present. If old crushes and new love stories don?t 

warm you enough, narrate tales of a pre-winter scoop from SN Market in Delhi on 

your way down from the hills, post-Puja!

Bolly brigade

Get used to bumping into Saif at Tantra or sharing 

bar-top space with Rahul in Shisha or waiting with Bachchan junior at 2.30 am 

at The Park portico. With Bollywood biggies parking themselves in Cal, the city 

is learning to give these silver-screen icons their space. So, knowing who?s in 

town for the latest film is a must, but falling all over them to get an autograph 

when you meet them past midnight is definitely out. Sanjay Dutt or Sameera Reddy, 

just gape and go.

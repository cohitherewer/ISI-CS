 We Ask You Answer

 Citizen rights vs tourist roll

Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on 

current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. 

Today?s question: Should the government sponsor a fireworks contest on Diwali 

to turn it into a tourist extravaganza? More letters will be printed next 

week

Saptadipa Ghosh,

Diwali is the festival of lights and the celebration 

of the triumph of good over evil. The government can certainly sponsor a fireworks 

contest, which will provide enjoyment to all sections of society on such an auspicious 

occasion. But it should ensure that there is only negligible increase in pollution 

due to the contest. The show should be able to attract a lot of tourists. 

Suvadip Goswami, 

 Mahestala

 Diwali is unimaginable without fireworks. So, the government can certainly organise a fireworks competition on Diwali. But the fireworks should not break the 65-decibel sound limit. The profit made from such a contest can be used for beneficial purposes.

Paromita Mallick, 

 Kalindi

 Diwali is a festival of lights and firecrackers. Any show that highlights the grandeur and festive mood of Diwali will definitely be a draw for tourists. Visitors from the West, especially, will find such a competition enthralling. The venture promises to be a good source of revenue.

R. Paulmazumdar, 

 Shyamnagar 

 Such a fireworks contest would turn out to be a nuisance in the name of extravaganza. I hope the government would not be foolish enough to endanger public health for hosting a show.

Virendra Shah, 

 Amratalla Lane

 A huge amount of government money will be wasted if a state-sponsored fireworks contest is started. It is a stupid way of attracting tourists. Only corrupt officials and businessmen will make money from such an event. How about clean roads and proper maintenance of law and order? A grand fireworks display will not wipe out from the minds of the tourists the other things that they will see in Calcutta. 

Md Ayub,

 Bright Street 

 In my view, the government should not organise a fireworks contest on Diwali. Organising such a contest at a time when crackers are being banned will send out a wrong signal to the people. Besides, the money spent by the government on crackers can be better utilised by buying food and clothes for the destitute, so that they too can celebrate Diwali. Happiness should be spread on such a festive occasion.

Ahsan Jahir Molla, 

 Mahestala

 Organising a fireworks contest seems to be a good way to make more money through tourism. But under no condition should the 65-decibel limit be raised.

Prahlad Agarwala,

 Given that numerous sensible and elderly people are tired of fireworks, which cause sound as well as air pollution, the government should not sponsor a fireworks contest on Diwali, even if it attracts a lot of tourists. A folk festival can be considered instead. Such a festival would popularise our culture all over the globe.

Debyani Basu,

 Saptagram

 I think it is a great idea. Tourists are always attracted to the unique and such a contest will definitely be extraordinary. These days, all states are promoting their festivals with an eye on tourism. A few years ago, when Bill Clinton was in India, the Rajasthan government took the opportunity to promote Holi. Diwali is one major festival that we can appropriate. The only thing that the government should ensure is that the contest is planned and organised by professionals and that it is properly marketed.

Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake 

 It will be most welcome if the government sponsors a fireworks contest on Diwali. The idea is a brilliant one and will be profitable in the long run. Such a festival will definitely earn revenue from tourists. Moreover, fireworks manufacturers will be compelled to improve their standard, which in turn will help solve the unemployment problem.

Indranil Sanyal, 

 Dhakuria

 Considering the present economic situation of our state, we cannot afford to organise such an event. Lots of festivals are celebrated in Bengal which are enjoyed by the tourists. We do not need one more. The money can be spent for the uplift of the poor and the betterment of hospitals and schools. The aim should be to build a better state, not a tourist destination.

Ujjal Bhattacharyya,

 Entally

 The government should do everything to make Diwali a tourist extravaganza. This will be a positive initiative for more reasons than one. Such an event, if planned well, will definitely be a money-spinner. The government will also earn the goodwill of the people for organising a recreational event during the festive season. But the event must be properly publicised. 

Owing to restrictions imposed by the government on 

the manufacture and use of fireworks, the industry is going through a difficult 

period. Moreover, illegal manufacturing of fireworks is hitting the licenced traders 

hard. This will give them a platform to showcase their products. But safety must 

be ensured and pollution-control norms should be adhered to.

Udayan Banerjee,

 Hooghly

 No, the government should not sponsor such a fireworks contest. The idea is not a logical one for a cash-strapped state like ours. It is not certain that tourists will want to see such a fireworks contest. Also, the inevitable environmental pollution is best avoided. In fact, the government should concentrate on making Diwali more environment-friendly. 

Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 The government should never organise such a show. A fireworks contest will never be appealing unless held in a large arena on a grand scale. But organising such a show would entail a lot of expenditure. Not a wise idea, given that state sponsorship invariably means flop business. One should also keep in mind that not many tourists visit Calcutta on Diwali. Such an unreasonably lavish show should not be organised in a poor country like ours.

Naren Sen, 

 Howrah

 Holding a fireworks contest on Diwali is a good idea. West Bengal is lagging behind other states as far as attracting foreign tourists is concerned. But while arranging a fireworks festival, the government should keep in mind the safety aspects. If necessary, the Maidan can be utilised for hosting the contest. Such a festival would also generate employment.

PraSit Sen, 

 Hatiara 

 Yes, the government should sponsor a fireworks contest on Diwali. The contest will draw more tourists to our state and especially Calcutta. Diwali is celebrated in all the cities and states of India. Therefore to attract foreign tourists on the festival day, it is imperative to come up with a novel idea. The contest will earn us valuable foreign exchange. 

Atif Ayaz, 

 Library Lane 

 In my view, organising a fireworks contest is a good way of attracting tourists and will prove beneficial for the city in the long run. But care must be taken to ensure that those who do not want to have anything to do with the contest are not disturbed. Ideally, such a contest should be organised outside city limits, in an uninhabited place. 

Anil Kumar Sen,

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane 

 Diwali night is inconceivable without fireworks. A night of grand merrymaking, along with a bit of sound and air pollution, can be allowed once a year, especially if guests from abroad also join the celebrations. The money earned by the government from organising the fireworks contest can be utilised in development work. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata

 The government should look after its citizens and ensure their rights to food, clothing, shelter, education and health. This is the mark of good governance. It is not the duty of the state to sponsor a fireworks contest or any other activity on any festival, other than providing security.

Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge

 Tourists generally tend to congregate at places where festivals are held. A government-sponsored fireworks show would provide them an added reason to visit West Bengal.

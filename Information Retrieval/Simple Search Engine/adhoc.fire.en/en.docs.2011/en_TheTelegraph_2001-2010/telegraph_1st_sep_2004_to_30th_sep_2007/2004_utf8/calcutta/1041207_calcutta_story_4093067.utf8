The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For civic services, show tax receipt

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 House-owners will have to produce the current property tax bill from now on at the time of applying for a trade licence, sanction for major repairs to the water supply line, drainage lines and even repair of the building. 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) decided on Monday to make this criterion mandatory, in the wake of the dull response to the second waiver of property tax interest. 

 Most house-owners with large tax outstandings have refused to take up the offer so far. 

 According to mayor Subrata Mukherjee, this time, the outstanding property tax totals Rs 1,143.86 crore, of which Rs 616.19 crore is the principal amount. 

 ?The amount would not have piled up to such a staggering figure if house-owners were made to produce current tax-paid bill at the time of seeking permission or help from the civic authorities,? he said. 

 ?It is nothing new. In the municipal areas, it has always been mandatory for a house-owner to attach a copy of the current property tax bill-paid receipt with an application seeking any service from the civic body,? the mayor pointed out.

 The CMC plans to mop up Rs 300 crore of outstanding tax from the house-owners through this second waiver scheme, which is valid till January 31, 2005. 

 The house-owners have been given 32 days, till December 24, to submit an application expressing their willingness to pay up the outstanding amount. 

 So far, civic revenue department officials said, the CMC has received applications involving an outstanding amount of Rs 350 crore.

 Mukherjee said that in the first waiver of interest scheme, between June 2001 and March 2002, the CMC had collected Rs 120 crore ? much less than the expected Rs 400 crore. 

 The second waiver has been offered as the last chance to the defaulters before the introduction of an area-wise rate of property tax from next year. 

 The highlights of the second waiver-of-interest scheme are: 

Rate-payers to get 100 per cent exemption of interest on outstanding bill presented 

up to March 1999

Interest exemption up to 75 per cent on property tax bill presented between April 

1999 and March 2002

Hundred per cent exemption on penalty on the outstanding property tax bill presented 

up to March 2003

Rate-payers to benefit from scheme only if full outstanding amount up to March 

2003 is cleared within the validity period of the scheme

Part-payment against dues to be accepted but will not qualify to benefit from 

the scheme unless balance is paid by February 2005

Property tax deposited in the CMC?s suspense account before November 2004 to be 

adjusted in calculating outstanding principal amount.

 Thousands 

join festive feast

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nearly 10,000 people took part in a community lunch organised by the Pathuriaghata Byam Samity in Posta on Friday as part of the Kali puja celebrations.

 The club on Anukul Chatterjee Road organises one of the oldest community Kali pujas in the city. The lunch is being held for the past 77 years.

 People from various parts of the city and outside joined the lunch, comprising bhog, pulao, alur dam, chatni and misti. Annabhog, the special bhog of the goddess, was also served. Some had to wait till dusk to eat as the organisers could accommodate only 700 people at a time. 

 ?Around 8,000 people generally take part in the feast. This time the number has increased because of the growing popularity of the puja,? said club secretary Swapan Bannerjee.

 The puja is popular in the city and outside for other reasons as well. The 24-foot idol is adorned with gold and silver jewellery worth several lakhs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Six days on, see the sun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A collective sigh of relief was breathed in the city as the sun peeped out of its cloud cover after six days on Friday. 

 Met officials said the depression off Calcutta, after staying put since last Sunday, finally moved in a west-north-west direction and entered Jharkhand on Friday morning.

 ?The weather is expected to clear further on Saturday. But, the monsoon over Calcutta and the rest of Gangetic Bengal is still active and we expect normal monsoon rains,? said K.K. Chakraborty, director of the weather section of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore.

 Officials pointed to the significance of an overcast sky continuously for six days. Weather officials could not readily remember another instance of the sun remaining behind the clouds for six days at a stretch.

 ?We do remember that the sun did not come out for two or three days during the super-cyclone in Orissa four years ago, and on another occasion in 2002, when a depression had formed,? an official said. 

 Chakraborty pointed out that prolonged overcast skies during depressions or low-pressure systems were ?not unusual?.

 Only this time, the depression lasted longer near the city and remained stationary for nearly five days because the wind pattern was such that it did not help the system to move, he explained.

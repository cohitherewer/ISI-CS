The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Namrata Shirodkar: Big break

Bride sans prejudice

Ever since Charas flopped, Namrata Shirodkar 

has maintained a very low profile. But now in a big celluloid break, the beauty 

queen-turned-actress plays a demure and restrained Jaya Bakshi in Gurinder Chadha?s 

Bride amp; Prejudice.

 The actress, who hasn?t had a hit in years, landed her role in the crossover film after Gurinder saw her perform in Dil Vil Pyar Vyar. ?After watching the DVD she called me for a screen-test. I was made to read a part? Gurinder and the producer (Deepak Nayar) selected me for the role instantly,? Namrata told Metro.

 Bend It Like Beckham and the prospects of doing a British film made Namrata say yes straightaway. ?After the casting process was over, we were all asked to see the original film. Then there was a thorough workshop in London just two weeks before the actual shooting of the film.?

 Namrata didn?t find the style of shooting any different from a Bollywood potboiler. ?Apart from the all-British crew, everything else was pretty much the same. But we did sync-sound shooting, which was not something which we normally do in India.?

 As far as her character goes (Ash?s elder sister), the actress had to take care that it didn?t become inconsistent. ?The graph had to be maintained. I couldn?t possibly be very frivolous in a particular scene. That the film was shot from beginning to end was very helpful, so we could all be in our characters.?

 Despite the encouraging reviews she has received and the phenomenal collections of Bride amp; Prejudice in the UK, Namrata hasn?t signed a new film. ?It?s not that I have decided not to do films. It?s just that the scripts I am reading everyday have nothing new for me,? she signed off.

 But there?s something new for Namrata fans as she is ready to drift through Rok Sako To Rok Lo as an elegant and enigmatic cafe owner who is integral to the plot in a curiously understated way.

 Saapna, Jaya and Amar Singh: Musically yours

Dreams fulfilled

 Remember Oye Oye, the youth brigade?s national 

anthem more than a decade ago? The voice behind the superhit Tridev track, 

Saapna Mukherjee, is returning to her Bengali roots with a Puja album Baro Loker 

Biti Lo. Launched by Jaya Bachchan and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh at Hyatt 

Regency last Wednesday, the album features eight folk tunes inlcuding a medley 

and is produced by Accord. 

 ?The songs are not remixes. A few numbers were made popular by Runa Laila. And I had to pick them up in a very short time,? said Saapna, now a vice-president with Sahara Manoranjan. ?I have always wanted to sing playback for Bengali films but somehow producers here seem to think that I am inaccessible,? she added. 

Of late, Saapna has sung an A.R. Rahman track for 

Shyam Benegal?s Netaji: The Last Hero and one in Boney Kapoor?s Bewafa 

to be lip-synced by Sushmita Sen. But watch out for Rituparno Ghosh?s Raincoat, 

where she has sung a Geeta Dutt number without any background music. ?It?s a very 

interesting sequence with Aishwarya breaking out into this song as she makes tea. 

Rituda wanted me to sing as naturally as I could, which I did with a sore 

throat,? smiled Saapna.

Message mania

 Fourteen days and 67 lakh SMSs later, 35-year-old Jaya Jetley won the Rs 20 lakh diamond jewellery that Sujal gave to Kashish on their marriage day in Star Plus?s hit late-night show Kaahin To Hoga. Asia?s first reverse auction was a big hit and the text messages just kept beeping in ever since the Kismat Jagao 7827 Lagao contest was announced. It was the lowest unique bid of Rs 95.72 that won Jetley, a senior tax assistant in the income-tax office at Delhi, the prized piece of jewellery.

 ?I am really feeling over the moon,? said Jetley. ?I must have sent more than 2,000 messages. Sujal and Kashish are like family members and to have won a contest related to them is really a dream come true.?

Speaking on ?India?s largest SMS activity?, Peter 

Mukerjea, CEO, STAR India Pvt Ltd said, ?We are happy with the record response. 

Kismat Jagao 7827 Lagao is just the beginning of a series of unique applications 

that will power STAR?s wireless short code 7827. We have always endeavoured to 

excite the masses with content and will now be extending our leadership to the 

area of mobile phone interactivity as well.?

 Jassi: News value

Star saga

 If films and filmstars, on and off-screen, can be the staple of so many TV programmes, then why should the telly?s own top shows be ignored on beam? STAR News launched a novel programme on Monday called Saas Bahu Aur Saazish ? Kyunki Har Serial Kuch Kehta Hai. This show will have different segments to capture the excitement of popular soaps on the telly-scope. One segment will provide a racy recap of the popular serials aired every day across channels. It will also predict the likely turn of events in the following episodes.

 Another segment will profile a story, for instance what the new hair style being donned by Komolika of Kasautii Zindagii Kay is, or when Jassi is likely to have an image makeover. 

 And finally one segment will feature an exclusive interview with a popular television celebrity everyday and delve into their lives. 

 ?In a large number of Indian households while the activities of the Laloos, the Pawars and the Modis make important news, the Tulsis, the Parvatis, the Jassis and the Kkusums are as important to some other members of the very same household. This programme is an attempt to address their peculiar news need,? said Uday Shankar, CEO and editor, STAR NEWS. 

 Pegged as the first show of its kind on Indian news television, Saas Bahu Aur Saazish ? Kyunki Har Serial Kuch Kehta Hai is being aired from Monday to Friday at 2.30 pm, with a repeat telecast at 11.30 am the next day.

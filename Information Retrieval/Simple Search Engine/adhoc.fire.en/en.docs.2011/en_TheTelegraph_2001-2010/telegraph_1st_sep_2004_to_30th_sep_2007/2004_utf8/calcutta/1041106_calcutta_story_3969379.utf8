 Things are changing at the Taj Bengal, with the hotel in makeover mode to celebrate its 15th year in the Calcutta hospitality circuit. The two most recent changes are with its food and beverage offering. Here?s a closer look:

Chinoiserie

 One of Calcutta?s finest Chinese restaurants has got a facelift. Not only has the d?cor been overhauled, a new menu and service style are also in place. From the furniture to the moon-shaped saucers and cutlery, to the waiters? uniforms, much has changed. 

 ?With a lot of competition in the market and several new Chinese restaurants opening, people are tired of eating the same kind of food wherever they go. So we felt this was the right time for a revamp,? said a spokesperson of the hotel.

 While the manner of serving is more personalised, there is a minor starter and a surprise dessert on the house. The old favourites have been retained but there have been numerous new additions. Of these, the Steaming Boat stands out. The diner can choose from a host of vegetables, meats and sauces to be cooked up with gravy or dry, spicy, sour or sweet. Unusual options like Crunchy Water Chestnuts and Lotus Stems are the chef?s recommendations for vegetarians. If non-vegetarian is more your style, Spicy Hong Kong-style Lobster, Braised Chicken with Star Anise and Crispy Fried Chicken Rolls are must-haves. Scallops in XO Sauce is a delicacy for all seafood lovers. The Three-Flavoured Noodles (sour, sesame and spicy) are a perfect supplement with your meal.

The Darsaan bar offers the favourite Chinese dessert 

with a wide choice of flavours, from honey, chocolate and orange to Kahlua and 

Baileys. If you are part of the health-conscious lot, the Green Tea Ice Cream 

is just right. 

By the Way

 The coffee shop at the hotel is rolling out an enticing dinner buffet with over 30 items. This dining experience includes exotic dishes from all over the world in its weekly spread.

 The starters, comprising three non-vegetarian and six vegetarian salads, provide filling variety. On Mondays, two of the savoury main dishes are the Roasted Leg of Lamb and Potato and the vegetarian Tempura. Mid-week you can try the Italian Stuffed Peppers or Pan-Seared Chicken with Ratatouille and Tomato Coulis. During the weekend, out come Chingri Malai Curry and Chicken Stew Venice-style and Crepelle with Ricotta and Spinach. The desserts remain constant, with a selection of eight Continental desserts and two Indian desserts waiting to complete the feast. All this comes priced at Rs 495.

Meat that melts in the mouth and is light on the tummy? 

if you are wondering how to achieve this feat, check out the Kashmiri food fest 

at Charnock?s, the multi-cuisine destination atop Charnock City, Salt Lake.

 Part of the mall?s seventh birthday anniversary celebrations, the Wazwan festival features Kashmiri delicacies like Gustaba, Lahabi Kebab and Rista, usually out of bounds for the city foodie. Organised by Kashmiri food expert Shankar Kaul, the array is extensive and will keep changing to provide more variety.

 Cooked in mustard oil with exotic spices like shalan, the food, especially the meat items, differ from other Indian cuisine in that it is extremely light. ?The meat is pounded thoroughly while it is fresh. It is essentially a cleaning process that makes the meat light in texture, enabling you to consume more than you normally would,? said Kaul. The meat is then simmered for at least four hours in yoghurt and spices before it is ready for consumption. Kashmiris are also very particular about the cuts of meat. ?We use only leg pieces while preparing delicacies and choose very tender lamb,? added Kaul.

 There are tasty options for vegetarians as well. Dum Aloo aside, there are exotic preparations like Al Yakhni (pumpkin cooked with cinnamon, shahi cumin and curd) and Tamatar Paneer (cottage cheese cubes shallow fried and mixed with tomato gravy in Kashmiri spices).

 Cap it off with some Phirni (rice paste cooked in milk and garnished with almonds). And if you are in the mood to reflect on the charms of the Valley, settle for a cup of steaming Kehwa (Kashmiri tea with saffron, almonds and cinnamon). Never mind if it?s only the bird?s eye view of Salt Lake you can catch at the moment from the ninth-floor restaurant.

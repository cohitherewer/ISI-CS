The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Rs 57 crore to cure eyesore

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 

Productivity gap between hired and civic sweepers 

for transportation of 108,000 tonnes of garbage a year in 130 lorries:

Manpower (daily):

Cost (yearly):

CMC 6,000

Contractor 700 

Rs 43 crore

Rs 06 crore 

 The garbage vat, one of the city?s eyesores, is on the way out. 

 A feasibility study on the project, made by a group of four consultancy firms, is being carried out by experts associated with the Calcutta Environment Improvement Scheme and officials of the civic conservancy department.

 After the details are worked out, the proposal will be placed before mayor Subrata Mukherjee for his approval. 

 ?Open vats are an old concept. A modern city should get rid of them,? asserted mayor Mukherjee. He blamed the vats ? more than 500 of them spread across the city ? for the Calcuttan?s habit of throwing garbage on the roads and in lanes, instead of handing it over to sweepers.

 The ?no-vat? project, to be taken up as part of the city improvement scheme, will be funded by the Asian Development Bank. In the Rs 1,245-crore (Rs 1,518 crore, according to the new dollar-rupee exchange rate) loan package proposed by the bank, Rs 57 crore has been earmarked for the conservancy service.

 Calcutta, home to 5.5 million households, generates 300 tonnes of garbage daily. The conservancy department is responsible for clearing the vats and dumping the garbage at Dhapa, an operation that costs the civic body Rs 50 crore a year.

 The present system of clearing and dumping waste comprises three steps. Conservancy sweepers collect household garbage from door to door and dump it in the nearest vat. 

 In the second stage, waste from the vats is loaded on to trucks, to be carried to Dhapa. And in the final stage, trucks unload the trash on the Dhapa grounds, where bulldozers are deployed to level the mounds.

 Under the proposed system, civic sweepers will collect household trash and deposit it in trucks. Because of the absence of vats, neighbourhoods will be spared of the stink. Besides, all areas will be cleaned simultaneously, as the the civic trucks will not ply in batches.

 The new system, however, will require more trucks, buckets and containers. It is estimated that 500 trucks will have to be deployed. Besides using its own fleet of 140 trucks, the civic body now hires another 140.

 Managers of the city improvement scheme plan to procure 50 new dumper pressures, each costing Rs 9 lakh, and over 100 containers. They are also keen on privatisation of the conservancy service, having found out that sweepers on contract deliver 10 times more than those on the civic body?s payroll.

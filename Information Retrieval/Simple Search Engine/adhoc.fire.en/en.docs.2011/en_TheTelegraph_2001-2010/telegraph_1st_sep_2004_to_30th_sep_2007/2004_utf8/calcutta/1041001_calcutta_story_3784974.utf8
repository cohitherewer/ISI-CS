 Stage sojourn with body and soul

 Kinaetma Theatre wanted, or rather preferred, a small audience of 50. Yet, 250 theatre-lovers, no less, made sure they got a ticket to ride The Silk Route: A Memoir of a Journey, the UK-based troupe?s site-specific performance, on the Tollygunge Club lawns few weeks back. They were all taken on a long-winded walk through slush and wet grass in the dark to experience the imaginary route traversed by Marco Polo centuries ago. The last thing the crowd would have expected after scrambling so hard for passes.

 The audience may have had some idea of the theatre-on-the-move experience, but it had no inkling of the form. Apart from those who grumbled about the gruelling walk and at the lack of synergy between form and content, there were others who found the body movements of the performers quite uncomfortable, often breaking out into muffled laughter.

 The movements ? carefree and intimate, often bordering on the erotic ? formed the core of the drama for which a bunch of 24 high school and college students was trained by Nigel Ward and Royona Mitra (founding members of Kinaetma) to match paces with Konkona Sen Sharma and Royona. At the end of three weeks, the girls and boys got to swing, roll, trapeze and fall on each other with enormous ease.

 ?It?s physical theatre, a form far removed from conventional theatre and widely practised in the West. Here, verbal expressions become subservient to body movements but the aim is to strike a balance between text and movement. You need to treat your body as an empty vessel and start removing the prejudices and biases attached to your body,? explains Royona, who did her Master?s in physical theatre and worked with renowned European troupe DV8 in this form.

 The ease and uninhibited expressions of the young performers ? hugging, embracing and caressing ? sprung from the conviction they had in the mood being portrayed. ?I was in the City of Desire along with Royona, which was a journey through the entrapment of desire,? explains Rohini Ghosh, a Class XII student. 

 ?I was comfortable with my movements as Royona and Nigel had made us feel very comfortable with our bodies. We were put through exercises and the several trust games we played, like free-falling with your eyes shut, helped a lot,? she adds.

 In the City of Innocence, it was Mrinalini Sen who impressed with her dexterity. ?It was new (physical theatre) and I loved it. But I had some idea as I was a part of Kinaetma?s last production, The Changing Room, as well and that had helped,? says she.

 The participants were able to quickly adapt to the idea that their bodies were a medium of communication. ?We started out by teaching them how to fall, catch, or throw each other in space. This apart, stretches and exercises were all we could rely on,? adds Royona. At Kinaetma, her work focuses on cross-cultural issues with Indian and European performing traditions.

 Royona admits being aware of an Indian audience feeling inhibited by physical intimacy on stage. ?The cultural and social inscriptions on the body are such that the audience finds it controversial. I had to fight mental blocks when I started working on this form. But such a reaction surprises me too, as our culture has a tradition of temple dance where the art form had a real sexual purpose,? exclaims Royona, who trained in kathak under Rani Karnaa and in contemporary dance under Manjusree Chaki Sarkar.

 ?It was difficult for me as well in the beginning as I was trained in kathak, a form of dance in which the body exists in a separate, sacred space. From there to a form where physical contact is the essence was a journey in itself,? she adds.

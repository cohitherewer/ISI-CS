 Flower power wilts under shower blitz

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Courtesy the Pujas and the wedding season, flower prices have hit the roof. To top it all came last week?s deluge, preceded by a long spell of rain in September, destroying more than half the state?s produce.

 ?Around 13,490 metric tonnes of flowers, worth Rs 8.3 crore, have perished in the deluge,? said Sudhanshu Sil, member of Parliament and chairman of Mullickghat Phoolbazar Parichalan Samiti. 

 The deluge had inundated 2,698 hectares in the two Midnapores, Nadia, Birbhum, North and South 24-Parganas and Howrah. The districts together account for a bulk of the city?s flower supply.

 ?We have been reduced to a penniless state,? rued Asim Sashmal, a grower from Bagnan and a regular at the Mullickghat flower market. A grower from Deulti is now pinning his hopes on only one-fourth of his standing crop, as most of his two-bigha plot had been submerged for 10 days. 

Around 3,000 farmers and sellers bring their produce 

daily to Mullickghat, the largest wholesale flower market in eastern India. Most 

of them are now busy taking stock of their losses.

 With the puja favourites like lotus, marigold, jaba, aparajita and dopati having taken a severe beating, decorators are a discontented lot. 

 ?The price of lotus ? a must for Durga puja ? has risen manifold. My expenses, too, will see a matching rise,? said Arup Nag, general secretary of the Decorators Samannyaya Samiti. 

 According to Nag, who has been hired by eight puja organisers, flowers account for about 20 per cent of the pandal expenses. Sensing an opportunity, some operators are now hoarding bunches of lotuses from Orissa. 

 The marriage scene, too looks equally dismal, as roses, rajnigandha and coloured gladiolii are in short supply.

 The wholesale price of roses has shot up from Rs 50 per 100 pieces to Rs 140. ?In November, it will cross the Rs 300-mark,? said Sadhan Das, secretary of the Mullickbazar Phool Chashi O Bikreta Union. 

 Coloured gladiolii, which now sell at Rs 70 a dozen at the wholesale market, are likely to cost Rs 150 by November-end.

 The rains have also played spoilsport with the export market. 

 ?About 40 per cent of the state?s flower export has been hit by the monsoon and the deluge,? said Subrata Basu, deputy manager, West Bengal State Food Processing and Horticultural Development Corporation. West Bengal had exported Rs 1-crore-worth of flowers last year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Autorickshaws plying between Lohapool and Park Circus are an absolute nuisance. 

The drivers park the three-wheelers near Chandni Market in a most haphazard manner 

to pick up more passengers. Even hand-rickshaws and cycles fail to manoeuvre their 

way through the line of autos that jam the Lenin Sarani-Grant Street crossing. 

As it is the narrow road is insufficient for buses and trams to ply smoothly. 

Just the other day I saw a pedestrian almost running into a mishap. An alert passer-by 

pulled him away from the tramtrack or else he would have been run over. The spot 

is a nightmare for all passengers waiting for a bus or tram. Passengers, after 

getting off a vehicle, cannot seek refuge on the footpath either. Hawkers have 

occupied every inch of space of the pavement along the stretch. A traffic policeman 

should be posted regularly at the crossing of Lenin Sarani and Grant Street to 

discipline the autorickshaw drivers.

 All Calcuttans will agree that the size of sweets is smaller on festive occasions 

like New Year, Durga puja, Lakshmi puja, Diwali and Bhai Phonta. Manufacturers 

should improve the quality of sweets and a standard size should be maintained 

throughout the year. This will increase their general sales and annual profit. 

Weights and measurements department should also keep a check on the manufacturers? 

malpractices.

 The public toilets at Howrah bus terminus are in a deplorable condition. An 

obnoxious smell hangs in the area all the time. Many passengers and passers-by 

see no alternative but to relieve themselves near the lavatory. This only adds 

to the problem. The Howrah Municipal Corporation doesn?t even bother to take corrective 

measures. 

 Naren Sen, Howrah. 

 School buses should not be allowed to ply in the narrow lanes of Lake Town. 

Since they are driven at break-neck speed, innocent residents run the risk of 

getting dragged into accidents. Transport authorities should specify routes for 

school buses to follow before issuing them permits.

 Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town. 

 Residents of Budge Budge are reeling under a mosquito menace. Most ponds and 

drains in the area are dirty and some are covered with water hyacinth. The civic 

body should immediately kick off a drive to spray mosquito repellents and keep 

malaria at bay.

 Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 The master of twists is now becoming the master of 

special appearances. Yes, M. Night Shyamalan (picture below) does make a fleeting 

(can?t even call it that) appearance in his latest thriller The Village, 

running at INOX (Forum and City Centre) and Globe.

 Call it superstition or self-conscious tribute or a frame from the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock, Shyamalan has been in front of the camera ? however briefly ? ever since his first film Praying with Anger, where he played an Indian named Dev Raman.

 In his directorial breakthrough, the Bruce Willis blockbuster The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan played Dr Hill, who examines Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) after the ?accident? at the birthday party.

 The director was back on screen in his comic book tribute flick Unbreakable as a drug dealer at the football stadium where David Dunne (Bruce Willis) is a guard.

 In his commercially most successful film Signs, Shyamalan enjoys his longest screen stint (of about 10 minutes), once again as an Indian. He is veterinarian Ray Reddy engaged in the road accident that claims Mel Gibson?s wife, forcing the priest to lose his faith.

 The Village, though, has just a shot of Shyamalan when his face is reflected on the glass door of a refrigerator. He does, however, mouth quite a few lines as the guard at the desk.

 The film has been another big Disney success in Hollywood with revenue collections of more than $ 115 million and it is also doing quite well in the city with the evening and night shows at the multiplex screens going almost 80 per cent full.

Demi Moore with husband Ashton Kutcher

 Do you need an excuse to watch Demi Moore? Whether she is strip-teasing away to glory or going full throttle as the bikini-clad fallen angel of Charlie, yeh dil maange Moore. Now you can catch the sexy lady in A Few Good Men, to be shown on Star Movies on Wednesday, at 9 pm.

 This, however, is a completely different Demi ? stern rather than sexy, dealing with a brief than de-briefed. She plays Lt. Commander JoAnne Galloway, who is assigned to assist navy lawyer Lt Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) to defend two Marines who are accused of the murder of fellow leatherneck at the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Her quiet chemistry with Cruise goes well with the high drama in the courtroom pitting a few good men against the military establishment.

 For those who thought Demi has gone on a sabbatical, stop fretting. Just recently, work got underway on her new film Half Light. But there?s controversy already ? producers of the film have been accused of destroying a natural beauty spot in North Wales. The movie is being filmed on the remote island of Ynyf Llanddwyn, off Anglesey. Residents are furious with the way the production unit has taken over the island. The lighthouse, its main tourist attraction, has been painted red, while the film sets have been accused of ruining the landscape.

 Half Light revolves around Rachel Carlson, played by Demi, a successful mystery novelist. Her life falls apart when her five-year-old son drowns at her country home. A year later, in an effort to heal her wounds and help her to start writing again, her best friend rents her a secluded cottage in a remote fishing village, where strange events unfold, rocking the tranquil village and causing Rachel to fear for her sanity and her life. While Half Light might take some time to see the light of day, for the time being catch Demi on the small screen.

ER: Medical moments

It?s a decade old and there?s no Parminder Nagra (the 

Bend it Like Beckham star), but there is George Clooney. Yes, we?re talking 

about ER, the much-hyped medical television series that now even features 

Anupam and Kiron Kher in cameo roles.

 It premiered on NBC in the US in 1994. A decade later, there?s no sign of it slowing down. ER, short for emergency room, is still going strong, with a stellar cast. After all, it did give that big break to George Clooney. Before Ocean?s Twelve comes to town, watch him as a maverick paediatrician in his pre-Hollywood days.

 ER is a drama that focuses on the lives of interns in a Chicago hospital as they struggle to become doctors. It?s an emotional roller-coaster ride through the pressures of trauma care, with huge highs and dismal lows, with life and death.

 Catch the early episodes of the multi-Emmy-winning show at 9 pm on Wednesdays on Zee English. The Michael Jurassic Park Crichton creation is famous for its factual accuracy and high-adrenaline action. It was written right after Crichton graduated from Harvard Medical School.

 Apart from guest appearances by famous faces, it also features foreign talent like Brit Alex Kingston, better known as Ralph Fiennes? ex-wife than for her TV career. Yugoslavian Goran Visnjic shot to fame with his memorable performance in Welcome to Sarajevo, based on the Balkans war (but you?ll have to wait a while to see him).

 Continuing their unique marketing and promotional methods with Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin, Sony Entertainment Television is now busy celebrating Jassi?s appointment as CEO of Gulmohur House. Sweets are being distributed in offices across the country with just one roaring caption ? Jassi becomes CEO!

 The media release reads more like that from a fashion house than from a television soap. It announced that Jasmeet Walia would be responsible for the overall management and strategic growth plans of Gulmohur House. What follows is a short biography of Jassi and how she has scaled the great heights in her career.

 With the soap already such a rage in all drawing rooms, Sony?s constant effort to maintain ? and grow ? the Jassi image as a real-life one has paid rich dividends. With the TRP ratings showing no signs of climbing down, be ready to be ruled by the brigade of buck-toothed, big spectacled secretaries.

 After an interval of five years, Indian Museum is set to open three new galleries on its Jawaharlal Nehru Road compound. The galleries will be unveiled in the next couple of months.

 An exclusive gallery on the Indus Valley civilisation is nearly ready, and the other two have a February schedule.

 On Monday, museum director Shaktikali Basu disclosed that during a recent visit, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwaliah had assured the authorities of initiating measures to sanction more funds for the museum. 

 The funds will help the authorities put on display most of the objects now kept in the museum vaults. 

 ?Utensils, statues, instruments for measuring weights and toys used by the people of the pre-historic period will be displayed in the Indus Valley gallery,? Basu said.

 ?The gallery will resemble a pre-historic village, with the rubble of settlements and roads. We will try to design the gallery in such a way that visitors will understand how the villages looked in 1750 BC,? added Basu.

 Separate floor space has been earmarked in the main building of the museum for setting up the gallery.

 The second gallery will display the museum?s collection of masks. The collection was started in 1814, when the museum was inaugurated. 

 ?Our collection of masks is unique and is probably the best in the country. We are going to display more than 400 masks of different periods,? said Basu.

 The third new gallery will display items from the northeastern states, like Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya, and from Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand. It will be set up after renovating the existing minor art gallery. Basu said more than 500 objects will be displayed in this gallery.

 A senior museum official said that as of now, only up to four per cent of the total collection can be displayed due to space constraints and security reasons.

 Recently, the Union department of culture had decided to engage Central Industrial Security Force jawans to look after the museum security. 

 ?After getting confirmation from the Centre that we will no longer have to depend on our own security personnel while displaying our collection, we have decided to initiate a special drive. The decision to open three new galleries is a part of the drive,? said another museum official.

 The other problem the museum faces in displaying its collection is a space constraint. There is hardly any vacant space in the main building.

 Some of the buildings on the museum?s sprawling compound are occupied by central government organisations, like the Zoological Survey Of India, Geological Survey of India and the Anthropological Survey of India. The organisations are the museum?s tenants.

 The museum authorities have written to the Centre for getting back the space occupied by the organisations. ?We are likely to get back the space soon and will be able to please our visitors by displaying the breathtaking collections that we have kept in our storerooms,? said Basu.

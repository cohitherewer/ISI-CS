The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 100-cr biotech park on anvil

 - Buddha plea for ?quality? pharma investments

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The city will soon boast an exclusive biotechnology park to promote investment and research in Calcutta and the rest of Bengal.

 Inviting the captains of industry to arrive here in ?a big way? and make ?quality investments?, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced that a new health policy was in the pipeline that would be flexible and aimed at promoting investments from all over the world. 

 Addressing a large gathering of over 4,000 delegates at the Science City auditorium for the Indian Pharmaceutical Congress, the chief minister said the government has decided to put a well-conceived plan in place to ensure that essential drugs are available at economical rates.

 Later, elaborating on the proposed biotechnology park, Sujan Chakraborty, CPM parliamentarian and chief organiser of the congress, said Rs 100 crore will be spent on the park, now in the planning stage. 

 ?Although we haven?t finalised the site, it could well be in Rajarhat New Town. The park will have modern facilities and will promote R amp;D and stress on long-forgotten traditional medicine formulations,? said Chakraborty.

 Talks are underway with private parties who might be interested in joining hands with the government to showcase Bengal pharma industry?s rich history. 

 Earlier, both the chief minister and Chakraborty had said that Bengal had the potential of promoting trade links in the pharma industry with other countries. 

 ?With Nathu la opening shortly and the government prioritising the pharma industry as a key thrust area, there should not be any looking back,? said Chakraborty.

 The chief minister called for a more rational drug policy, which would support more investments and R amp;D. ?We have facilities for entrepreneurship in Uluberia, Kasba and Behala. More such facilities will be created for quality work,? said Bhattacharjee.

 The Left Front will oppose the proposed patent bill in the pharma industry, which, according to pharmacists and businessmen, will cripple R amp;D because it will ensure patent on the product as well as the procedure to make a formulation. ?If the bill is cleared, R amp;D will be neglected and we (the Left Front) will stop it,? Chakraborty said.

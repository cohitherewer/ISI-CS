In search of safety: A parent walks out of the hospital with 

his child after the spate of deaths in 2002

 This is in reference to the article ?Maul-not cry in Maidan mandate? (September 29). It is heartening to see that 73 per cent of the respondents have given their opinion in favour of abolishing political rallies from the Maidan ? the heart and lungs of the city. 

 Rightly so, because apart from destroying the environment, political rallies ? whether held on Sundays or not ? throw the city out of gear, causing hardships to lakhs of people including the aged and patients who require immediate medical attention. 

 When thousands of people converge on the city from Howrah, Sealdah and other entry points, they throw common sense to the wind and occupy entire stretches of the roads and move at a snail?s pace. Most of them who do not know, or bother to know, what they are walking for, labour under the fixed belief that the more they cause inconvenience to the ordinary people, the more ?successful? their rallies are ? be they against the central government or American imperialism. This habit gets a shot in the arm with irresponsible and loose comments from a certain section of the leaders who feel proud to openly flout the rules and launch personal attacks on those who try to rein them in. 

 Now the question is whether organising rallies at the Maidan and taking out processions are at all necessary. What purpose do they serve? Can?t they be done away with altogether? Why don?t the leaders try out other options of protest rather than calling bandhs and crying ?Brigade chalo!? on the slightest pretext.

 The death of a 10-day-old at BC Roy Memorial Hospital 

for Children, as reported in ?Darkness, despair, death? and ?Powerless and on 

a prayer?, September 28, was most shocking. At least, the wards dealing with emergency 

and critical cases (including the OTs) must get uninterrupted supply of power. 

It is also surprising that when all the other big government hospitals have alternative 

power supply, BC Roy has never approached the CESC to get the same. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala. 

It is really unbelievable that BC Roy hospital does 

not have an alternative source of power supply. In conditions as those described 

in the reports, it seems the patients? relatives have no other option but to pray 

to the Almighty. 

Piyal Mukherjee,

Lake Town. 

BC Roy hospital?s reputation had been severely tarnished 

with the spate of child deaths in August 2002. The deaths on September 27 reminded 

us of those horrible days. Why didn?t the authorities pursue the matter with the 

finance department for sanctioning the purchase of generator sets? The onus is 

on them and not on the CESC. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

The problem of lack of resources in state hospitals 

has been a common woe but death due to power failure is unpardonable. Power supply 

is as basic a need as the hospital building itself. The finance department can 

also not avoid responsibility for the tragedy.

?Staying fit is fun?, September 30, made for an interesting read. Paranoid glances at the mirror have fed major lifestyle trends. One look at that flabby stomach or the thunder thighs makes any self-respecting individual feel aghast. Unfortunately, though we promise to act soon, that ?soon? never dawns. 

Joydip Sur,

CIT Road. 

Despite court orders, the government has again shown its callousness in taking steps towards controlling air pollution in the city (Fume check date falls flat, October 1). What are we to do? Bear with our transport minister playing God with our lives while the chief minister talks of a green Calcutta? It would be ideal if the scientists and research scholars residing in the city voice the demand for clean air. They can better comprehend the cumulative perils of vehicular pollution. 

Goutam Bose,

Bose Institute 

 We come to know of so many deaths through media reports that we become insensitive to the tragedies, almost in self-defence to protect our sanity. But incidents that on afterthought seem preventable are difficult to accept. Puja Singh?s death is one such accident (Mishap victims, September 29). Three people riding helmetless on a two-wheeler is unwise, to say the least. How can parents continue to send their children to school precariously perched on pillion? 

Chameli Pal,

Batanagar. 

 Netaji Indoor Stadium is only 30 years old but needs vast structural changes (Stadium roof to be brought down, September 30). As per plans, the repair work was supposed to have started last winter. The leaking roof can be covered with sheets only temporarily. 

Shiv Shanker Almal, 

Lower Rawdon Street 

 Apropos the report ?Spotlight glare scares hangman? (October 2), the Dhananjoy Chatterjee incident has received more than adequate publicity in the media. Let us allow the episode to die down. It is ridiculous how operas in Chitpur are out to stage jatras based on the rapist and his hangman?s lives. Such efforts should be nipped in the bud. 

Prahlad Agarwala, 

Majdia, Nadia. 

There is a correction in ?Drops of rain, shower of success?, October 26. The financial support for the project was provided by the Future Foundation School authority and not by WWF.

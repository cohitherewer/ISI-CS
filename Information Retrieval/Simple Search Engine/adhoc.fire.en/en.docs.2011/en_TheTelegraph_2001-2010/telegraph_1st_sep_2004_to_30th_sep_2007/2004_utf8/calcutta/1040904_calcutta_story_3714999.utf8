 Rajarhat plot papers ahead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Some plot-owners in Rajarhat New Town are in for a Puja bonus. On September 25, the government will hand over ownership documents to owners of 437 plots in Action Area I of the mega township project. 

 Announcing this on Friday, state housing development minister Goutam Deb said 2,590 families, comprising 13,000 people, will be able to live here. 

 All the required infrastructure has been built and those who live here will not face any problem, Deb said. Drainage and sewerage lines have been laid and drinking water supply and power supply connections are ready, he added.

 The plots will include both individual holdings as well as cooperatives. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta and land and land revenue minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah will be present when the papers are handed over.

 The minister announced that 2,500 new plots will be allotted in the next action area of the project. Advertisements for this will be published soon and the process of distributing forms will start from the first week of October, Deb said. Nearly one lakh people will live in 18,890 dwelling units on these plots.

 Of the 2,500 plots to be allotted, 1,495 will be individual plots for middle and higher income group people. Another 1,005 plots will be allotted for cooperatives, where all categories of flats lower, middle and higher-income group will be built. 

 Officials claimed that the prices of these plots will be reasonable, in keeping with those of Action Area I. The cooperative rules for Action Area I will be followed here, too (four to six cottahs for an eight-member cooperative). 

 In Action Area I of Rajarhat New Town, 5,590 plots have already been allotted to individual owners and cooperatives. Here, provision has been made for 2,590 families. 

 Seventy per cent of the plots have been allotted to middle-class and lower-middle-class people, Deb said. 

 The mega township project, covering 7,000 hectares, is divided into three action areas. Allotment of plots had began in 1999. 

 According to officials of the Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), infrastructure for Action Area I is complete. In Action Area II, the land acquisition process is complete and infrastructure is being built, a senior Hidco official said. 

 In Action Area III, land acquisition continues.

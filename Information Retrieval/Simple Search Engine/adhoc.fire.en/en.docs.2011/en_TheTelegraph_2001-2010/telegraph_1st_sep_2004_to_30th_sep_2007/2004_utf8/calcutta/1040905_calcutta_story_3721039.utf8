The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The other side, at midnight

 Tata Young could have changed her chartbuster Sexy, naughty, bitchy to Sexy, naughty, lacy if she had dropped by to watch Suman Nathwanis lingerie show at Dublin. From sensuous black to pristine white to passionate red and cute pink and lilac, reams of laces in all these colours and more dominated the makeshift ramp at the nightclub as Friday night fever took on a whole new meaning, post the witching hour. 

From long slingy dresses to bustier-like uppers and 

frilled lowers, the outfits were by no means lingerie. This is sleepwear, not 

lingerie. In India, its difficult for a designer to survive by doing only innerwear, 

felt designer Abhishek Dutta, who had turned up to check 

out the fare.

With almost the entire clubbing circuit of the city 

cramped inside the two-tiered night haunt, the drama off the ramp was often more 

interesting than the one on it. I cant stand here and watch these women walking 

around without a drink in my hand, complained someone who couldnt get to the 

bar. I want out, my girlfriend is waiting outside, shouted someone. 

 A little scuffle here and more than a little ogle there, the citys party animals managed to stun even a Delhiite. I never knew Calcutta was this happening, exclaimed Ajay Leekha, who had designed the jewellery. 

 The models were a hit, with the men vying for Nina Manuel and the women eyeing Aditya Bal, the only man on the ramp. But the star was on the sidelines: Raima Sen, looking lovely in a black outfit, stood quietly by the ramp with a friend and occasionally flashed the Suchitra smile.

 A cool return to school

 Erotica night, Chandni Bar night, Helen of Troy night the list goes on. For the nightclubs of the city, a theme night is a sure-shot formula to ensure more footfall by casting the curiosity hook for loyalists and newcomers.

 The dance floor at Winning Streak 

 Winning Streak, which belongs to the less theme nights and more original fun bandwagon, borrowed the success mantra on Friday night as the sports bar played host to a Back to School night. 

 Skool Daze, as the stickers on the steps leading to the underground fun station read, signalled that this was going to be nothing like the serious school days that weve all left behind. And indeed it wasnt. 

 Try to be dressed like a school kid screamed the invite, but Calcutta in its signature style decided not to play it by the book. So, one saw a lot of spaghetti straps, dangerously low denims, plain T-shirts and cargos nothing that any of them ever wore to the schools we went to! 

 One could at best say that the place looked like the dance floor on the final-year farewell day. So, there was beer and lots of spirited dancing and the usual pool games. 

 DJ Ivan, the music man from Mumbai whos now almost a regular at Winning Streak, played some retro numbers from the 70s and 80s (when at least some of the guests on the floor were in school), in keeping with the theme of the night.

Party Pooper

 Shedding their shy tag as fast as the denim line is dropping, the one thing that rankles revellers these nights is if they are promised curves and delivered clothes. The way of all flesh is the surest lodestar to nightclub footfall. And the cribs and cries of nothing was showing have to be heard to be believed...

 Male baby found dead on footpath

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A newborn male baby, cold in death, was found lying on the pavement off GD market, in Salt Lake, under Bidhannagar (South) police station. 

 Morning-walkers discovered the dead baby, barely two days old, dumped in one corner of the dusty footpath around 5.30 am. They called up a local NGO to rescue the infant.

 ?Much later, someone decided to inform us, thereby delaying the process for us to rush to its rescue,? said a police officer from Bidhannagar (South) police station. 

 Around 10.30 am on Friday, the baby was finally taken to Bidhannagar Hospital, where it was declared dead. 

 ?We are still not sure how the baby died. The body has been sent for post-mortem and we are trying to find out who could have dumped the infant on the footpath,? said Humayun Kabir, sub-divisional police officer.

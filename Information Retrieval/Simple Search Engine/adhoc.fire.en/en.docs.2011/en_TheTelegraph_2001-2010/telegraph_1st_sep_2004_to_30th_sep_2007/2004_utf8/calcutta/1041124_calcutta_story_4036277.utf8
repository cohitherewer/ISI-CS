Quack call to bond quick 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Since ducks are always seen swimming in pairs 

or groups, Feng Shui recommends displaying pictures or figures of groups of ducks 

in the east of the living room to help maintain the family bond and keep all members 

united 

Q: We have two children in their teens 

occupying bedrooms in the east and west of the house. They don?t get along at 

all. At times, we wonder whether the Feng Shui of their rooms is incorrect or 

if it is a phase of change that is putting distance between them. Is there anything 

that can be done in the house that will help strengthen the family bond?

Suchitra Mukherjee

The Solution: According to Feng Shui, the ruling 

element of each bedroom, decided by its location, could be friendly or destructive. 

Your children are occupying rooms where the elements are conflicting. The child 

staying in the western bedroom is ruled by the metal element, which is destructive 

to the wood element of the east. This destroys the harmony of their relationship. 

The elements can be made friendly by shifting both of them to the west, north-west, 

east, south-east or north of the house. Secondly, check the size and height of 

their bedroom doors. Ideally, they should be equal. Children occupying rooms with 

larger doors will bully those with smaller doors. You should also ensure that 

the doors are well-aligned and open and shut smoothly without making any kind 

of creaking sounds. Ducks are always seen swimming either in pairs or in groups. 

To keep all the family members united and maintain the bond, it will be helpful 

to display a whole family of ducks placed on a round reflective surface in the 

east of the living room.

Q: We will soon be shifting to a new flat 

in a south Calcutta high-rise. I have lived in an old house in north Calcutta 

for the past 20 years and have lots of friends in the locality. I am really worried 

about whether I would be able to make friends in the new neighbourhood. I would 

like to energise the area to help strengthen my friendship luck. Please advise.

Bindiya Mehta

The Solution: A very simple and a powerful 

enhancement would be to hang a painting, poster or a picture of a group of people 

chatting, dining or dancing in a party in the north-west side of your living room. 

If a round mirror is placed on the opposite wall, it doubles the effect of the 

enhancement. You can also place a beautiful, empty earthen bowl here, embellished 

with gold or silver colours on a table with six ceramic or porcelain figures of 

males and females playing different instruments. Highlighting this area with a 

soft light will further help attract energy that will then get collected in the 

empty bowl. Before placing these, be prepared to handle friends in large numbers.

Q: I live in a palatial house with a splendid 

garden. Unfortunately, while I have all the material comforts I could hope for, 

marital bliss is completely missing from my life. I am desperately looking for 

a remedy that could improve my personal relationship. Please help.

Name withheld

The Solution: The extreme south-west is ruled 

by feminine energy of the earth. This can be stabilised and energised to keep 

the lady of the house blessed with marital happiness. You can place nine heavy 

boulders in the south-west side of the garden and keep a bright light burning 

all night in this area. The light will drive away the prevailing negative and 

stagnant energy related to the relationship and keep the flames of love alive 

between both of you. Ensure that it is placed above everything else in the garden, 

apart from the trees. On a full moon night, take a big, shallow, earthen bowl 

filled with fresh water. Add eight different coloured semi-precious stones and 

six or seven metal coins to it, float four fresh pink flowers and light nine red 

and yellow floating candles in it. These remedies will help reduce differences 

and create a harmonious relationship between the two of you, unless of course 

your astrological charts show severe clashes.

Q: My grandfather has a library in the 

east of the house. It is overcrowded with books and he is so possessive about 

them that he won?t part with a single volume. All they do is collect dust but 

he would not let anybody touch them. I am sure the arrangement is not Feng Shui-friendly. 

Please suggest a way out.

Namita Arora

The Solution: This is a common problem with 

many households. People have collections of valuable books and cannot think of 

parting with a single one. They should be dusted daily and aired weekly or monthly 

to increase their shelf life so that they can be enjoyed by future generations. 

It is best to review the collection from time to time and let some go, though 

with a heavy heart. One must also ensure that the books have breathing space. 

This can be done by placing decorative objects like crystals, small flower vases 

and picture frames between the books.

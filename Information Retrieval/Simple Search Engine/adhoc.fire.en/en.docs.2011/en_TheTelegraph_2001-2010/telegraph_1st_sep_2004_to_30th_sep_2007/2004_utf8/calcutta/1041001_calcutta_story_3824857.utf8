 Building bar on temple premises

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Thursday passed an interim order debarring any construction in the Kali temple at Dakshineswar and the area adjoining the room in which Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa lived.

 The court, however, allowed the Calcutta Municipal Development Authority (CMDA) and the Dakshineswar Temple Trustee Board to proceed with the remaining plans for development and beautification of the temple premises.

 Justice P.C. Ghosh passed the interim order following a petition filed by Shyamali Das, who claims to be a descendent of Rani Rashmoni, founder of the temple.

 A resident of south Calcutta, Das had earlier filed a number cases in the high court and trial courts, alleging that Kushal Chowdhury, head of the trustee board, was in no way connected with the Rani Rashmoni family.

 Das, who appeared in person, alleged that due to the construction work in and around the age-old temple, the area was losing its heritage value. 

 ?The? attitude of the temple board and the CMDA is against the interests of general pilgrims,? she claimed.

 The petitioner went on to allege that the authorities were mercilessly felling trees, that could cause an environmental hazard in the area.

 Shaktinath Mukherjee, counsel for the temple board, and P.K. Das, lawyer appearing on behalf of CMDA, insisted that the area was being developed to provide more facilities for the pilgrims.

 They also challenged the standing of the petitioner and said she had no document to prove her lineage.

 The lawyers also alleged that Das had earlier moved Barasat court and demanded that she be included in the Dakshineswar temple board. 

 ?When the lower court rejected the petition, she moved a revision petition in high court, which is still pending,? they claimed.

 Hearing of the case was adjourned till September 6.

 A joint venture by the CMDA and the temple board to revamp the area was based on findings that pegged the daily pilgrim count at 20,000. 

 On the auspicious days of Durga puja, Kali puja, Buddha Purnima and Kalpataru Utsav, a few lakh devotees flood the temple premises.

Say cheese, in style

Julia Roberts, Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai and Preity 

Zinta ? what do these leading ladies have in common? Well, apart from the fact 

that they are all successful actresses, these gorgeous girls possess smiles that 

have launched a hundred movies and sent a million hearts soaring.

While a nice smile can light up otherwise ordinary 

features, a beautiful face with lips pursed can so easily be a turn-off if the 

smile reveals broken teeth or ugly gums. This is where the concept of cosmetic 

dentistry comes in. With quite a few dental clinics around town offering teeth 

restoration and correction facilities, flashing a set of sparkling 32s has never 

been easier.

Dr Debashish Bera, director of Smile Craft Dental 

Foundation and Research Centre in Salt Lake, says: ?People have become quite image 

conscious now and they are increasingly on the lookout for ways to enhance their 

natural beauty. Teeth are the most important part of the face since a good smile 

can transform any face. Cosmetic dentistry ? or appearance-related dentistry ? 

rectifies various problems of the teeth and gums.?

Dr Srijon Mukherjee, facio maxillary surgeon at Apollo 

Gleneagles, says that in the past four or five years, the demand has shot up in 

Calcutta. ?While cosmetic dentistry has been around for a long time now, previously 

only people in the glamour world would go for it. But now, even the average office-going 

Calcuttan doesn?t mind investing in his appearance,? feels Mukherjee.

Cosmetic dentistry can broadly be classified into 

two sections ? restorative and surgical. ?The restorative part deals with reconstruction 

and reanimation of the existing dental structure. The problems that can?t be dealt 

with through this are taken care of through orthognathic surgery,? says Dr Mukherjee.

Here are some of the common treatments that can add 

to your face value by enhancing the beauty of your teeth.

Teeth whitening

?Everybody likes sparkling white teeth without any 

yellow or brown stains. Bright white teeth can also brighten the face,? says Dr 

Bera. This is achievable by bleaching teeth with a chemical agent (a peroxide), 

used under the supervision of a dentist.

Depending on oral habits like smoking, chewing tobacco, 

excessive intake of tea, coffee or coke, the whiteness can last between one and 

three years. Another way of teeth whitening is enamel Microabrasian where a mild 

acid is used when small areas of the teeth are affected with yellow or brown spot.

?Whitening is also done through laser, but that?s 

not available here. Badly discoloured teeth surface can be rectified by using 

ceramic or light activated composite resin veneers,? adds Dr Bera.

 Cost: Around Rs 6,000

Scaling amp; polishing

This can be an alternative to whitening. Though the 

effect is not exactly the same, first scaling and then polishing the teeth give 

them a clean appearance and bring out their natural colour. The polishing is done 

with Pumis powder and paste with the help of a small rotatory brush that mechanically 

polishes each tooth. ?Scaling and polishing is the healthiest way to have nice-looking 

teeth which may not be sparkling white but have a healthy natural colour,? says 

Dr Mukherjee.

 Cost: Rs 1,000

Restoration

Chipped, broken, small and eroded teeth can be corrected 

or restored to their original shape and size by the addition of a chemical plastic-like 

material called composite resins. Gaps between two teeth can also be healed through 

this. Caries-affected front teeth, characterised by a localised black shade, can 

also be given a new lease with cosmetic restoration.

 Cost: Rs 1,500-plus for each tooth; Rs 20,000 for 

full mouth (approx)

Contouring 

Re-shaping of natural teeth done by slight grinding 

here and there to make the smile aesthetically pleasing is called cosmetic contouring.

 Cost: Rs 1,000

Realignment 

Crooked or protruding teeth are usually re-aligned 

with the use of braces. ?The cosmetic value of braces has really increased over 

the past few years and it?s quite fashionable to wear them now. The bulky steel 

ones are not the only options you have anymore. There are many stylish varieties 

made of porcelain,? says Dr Mukherjee. The most popular are the transparent braces 

that merge with the teeth colour. Braces can be used to either close or create 

space between teeth.

 Cost: Rs 20,000 (approx)

Gum treatment 

?Gums play a vital role in a beautiful smile. A perfect 

gum should have a scallop and knife edge contour,? feels Dr Bera. The most common 

problems are excessive showing of gums during a smile, dark pigmented gum and 

receding gum showing longer teeth. These can be corrected through minor surgery.

 Cost: Rs 2,000 to Rs 6,000

Implant dentistry

Cosmetic dentistry is not limited to people having 

natural teeth ? even a person without a single original tooth can be given a pleasing 

appearance if his/her set of dentures is created considering smile elements. While 

the old-fashioned dentures are used widely, the most fashionable now are those 

in which titanium posts are implanted in the jawbone. A small part of the post 

sticks out, to which a porcelain tooth is fixed. This is better done for a single 

tooth or two teeth, while for the whole set four to five titanium posts are implanted 

on which the teeth are attached.

 Cost: Rs 30,000 for a single tooth

Smile design

This is the biggest wonder of cosmetic dentistry. 

It takes into consideration the whole facial composition of a person when planning 

a smile for him/her. The smile elements taken into consideration are: 

Lip and lip line: The length, curvature and 

shape of the lips can guide the exposure of teeth during the smile and the laugh; 

upper and lower lip line should maintain a perfect relation with teeth.

Gum: How much gum will show during a smile 

is determined by the cosmetic dentist to maintain harmony between pink and white.

Proportion of teeth: Length, width and shape 

(oval or square), surface contour (flat surface or convex), symmetry with right 

and left side of teeth.

 Cost: Rs 20,000 upwards

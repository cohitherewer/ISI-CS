The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Happy feet, healthy feet

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Cothes maketh a man, but that 

 is only half the story. Both ethnic and contemporary ensembles 

 demand matching footwear to complete the picture. Shoes 

 are now high up on the priority list, as much for men as 

 for women.

 But utility has to govern your decisions as much as style if you want your feet to be happy for that all-night pandal (or club) hopping plan. 

 So, a word of advice for all men ? do not let yourself be swayed by shades and designs alone. If you end up buying shoes that do not fit your feet properly, complications ? like blisters and corns, to say the least ? may arise, making every step you take more pain than pleasure.

 ?When we shop for shoes, we are often guided by the glitter and not by the comfort factor. However, wearing shoes that look good but are low on comfort can trigger foot pain and related problems,? says Arindam Ganguly, orthopaedic surgeon.

 ?While buying shoes, always ensure the front is wide enough to accommodate toes easily and the sole has a supportive arch. If you are wearing a distorted pair, you might not feel the effects initially but it could result in fatigue and nagging foot pain at a later stage. Always go in for a good brand because these companies usually invest time and money in research and development,? he adds.

 Opt for comfortable cuts rather than the envious edges. However, you don?t want to sacrifice style for substance altogether. Here are a few places you can check out for a healthy balance:

 Lace up

 Laced shoes for men are the only variety that have stubbornly refused to go out of vogue. Whether it is your first day at school or your first interview, you are sure to have worn them at some point.

 Slip ons

 Boardroom brainstorming or outdoor 

 sales calls, slip-ons are the order of the day (picture

 across city shoe racks, they are the preferred choice for 

 those who would rather not tie laces every now and again.

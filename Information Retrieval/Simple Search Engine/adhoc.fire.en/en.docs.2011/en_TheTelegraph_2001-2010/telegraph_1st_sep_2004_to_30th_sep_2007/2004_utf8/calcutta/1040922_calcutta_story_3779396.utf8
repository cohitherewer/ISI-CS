The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The footpath along Ashutosh Mukherjee Road, in front of Jadubabu?s Bazar in 

south Calcutta is in a mess. Seven feet on one side of the almost 15 ft-wide footpath 

have been completely encroached on by fruit vendors. Permanent shops too display 

their ware and dump cartons and other items right outside their shops on the footpath. 

People are now forced to walk on the main road itself. The encroachment problem 

is not restricted to a few pockets of the city. So, the authorities should address 

this issue immediately. 

 Prantik Sanyal, S.P. Mukherjee Road. 

 Nowadays letters frequently get lost in transit. Even acknowledgement slips 

do not reach the senders. I request the post master general, Calcutta range, to 

look into the matter.

 Autorickshaws at the Ultadanga-Hudco crossing are becoming simply uncontrollable 

by the day. The drivers misbehave with passengers and park the vehicles in the 

middle of the road, choking traffic movement. The worst thing is that they carry 

as many as seven passengers at one time. They take a shortcut from the gate stop 

to Bidhannagar railway station to hoodwink the police at the Ultadanga junction. 

The road on this ?shorter? route, which runs under the Ultadanga flyover, is full 

of potholes and passengers end up with a backache. The transport department should 

discipline the errant drivers. 

 Sunil Banerjee, VIP Road. 

 I had opted for Calcutta Telephones? (CalTel) Sulabh Scheme II in April. I 

purchased an Indian Telephone Card (ITC) but found that there is only one access 

code (1602-33) under the scheme for entire Calcutta. It is extremely difficult 

to get through as this line is constantly engaged. Therefore, I applied to the 

AOTR, BSNL, at the Hare Street office to revoke scheme II and restore my phone 

connection to its previous status of Plan General. Both Bentinck Street and Hare 

Street offices first refused to accept my application. Finally, it was accepted 

by the AOTR?s office. The Sulabh Scheme II has led me to a maze of problems. 

 Nireekshana Elisha, Middle Road. 

 I reside on Gora Chand Road, ward no. 60. The biggest problem in our locality 

is the dirty drinking water supplied by the Corporation. It is the main reason 

for the outbreak of various diseases. 

 Afifa Alam, Gora Chand Road.

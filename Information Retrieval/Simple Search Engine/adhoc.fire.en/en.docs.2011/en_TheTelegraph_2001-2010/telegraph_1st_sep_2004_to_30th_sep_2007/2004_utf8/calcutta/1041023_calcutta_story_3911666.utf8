 Caring for Calcutta was the motto of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2004. Safety measures, civic consciousness and social commitment were the criteria. And the award money is used for deserving social causes.

 With the True Spirit roll of honour being read out at all ?prized? pandals on Navami, the final panel of judges and some organisers of the winning pujas felt there?s no better way to celebrate the spirit of the season?

 Revd Noel Sen, Trustee, The 

 Telegraph Education Foundation: The level of awareness 

 that we found was a healthy sign of growing concern for 

 the community. Durga puja is not just a spiritual function; 

 it has a wider scope. The social work the puja committees 

 are doing helps the NGOs share the load.

 Raima Sen, Actress: I was 

 impressed. The organisers were very aware and had made provisions 

 for everything ? fire-fighting, medical aid and charitable 

 causes.

 Gitesh Ranjan Bhattacharjee, 

 Chairman, PCB Appellate Authority and Former Presiding 

 Judge, Green Bench: Within their limited scope, the 

 organisers have tried to do a lot of work. They deserve 

 to be encouraged.

 D.N. Majumdar, CESC: There were no irregularities in the power lines of the pujas that we visited. The sound pollution problem has also definitely gone down. Moreover, the organisers have now started to talk in all earnestness about environmental issues. That is a definite start.

 Utpal Mukherjee, CMC: Cleanliness is definitely an area of increasing improvement at the pandals. Though the finalists of the contest are free of the charge, puja organisers in general still need to restrain themselves from chopping trees.

 Snehasish Ganguly, former cricketer: The level of commitment for social work or eco-friendly measures is still not adequate. 

 Moon Moon Sen, Actress: 

 A certain amount of awareness has been instilled in the 

 puja committees because of such an award, but there is a 

 lot of ground still to be covered. Instead of calling film 

 stars from Mumbai or getting some of us to stand in front 

 of an idol for five minutes, the organisers should invest 

 in social work. 

 Debasish Deb, Illustrator: The lure of awards can make people do a lot of things. This award inspires them to get involved in good causes. But only when it becomes second nature and they keep up the good show even without the hope of any award, will the True Spirit enterprise become a success.

 Jimmy Tangree, Station Director, 

 Red FM: The criteria was clearly laid down, which left 

 no scope for confusion. 

 Kalighat Milan Sangha, Organiser: 

 True Spirit is truly special since it?s the only award which 

 looks, in great detail, at aspects like eco-friendliness, 

 waste management, toilets, and drinking water facilities. 

 We were conscious about not just putting the arrangements in place, but also maintaining them through the Pujas. We were very tense when the judges visited and were relieved when we passed their scrutiny.

 Maniktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty 

 Durga Puja, Organiser: ?Pujas other than those participating 

 in True Spirit are also learning from us and paying attention 

 to things like public facilities and eco-friendliness.?

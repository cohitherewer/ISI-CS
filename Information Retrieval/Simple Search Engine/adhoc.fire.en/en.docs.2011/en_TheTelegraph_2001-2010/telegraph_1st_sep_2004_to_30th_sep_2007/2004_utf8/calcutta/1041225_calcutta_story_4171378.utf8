The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On, off amp; all that

More roads and more potholes, more to see on the small 

screen and more to miss, more to munch on and more to crib about Calcutta 

2004 was a clutch of contraries

PATH amp; POTHOLE

This was the year of new roads and old potholes, concrete 

and crater, speed lanes and traffic stoppers. With every stretch created or repaired, 

there was a cave-in, a dig-up or plain decay.

Just before the Pujas, civic engineers said over 900 

km of city roadspace was potholed. All added up, the craters would cover 3.5 lakh 

sq m, forcing cars to moonwalk.

On the bright side of the street, this year also saw 

the Gariahat Road being concretised and the AJC Bose Road and Lake Gardens flyovers 

providing a fast-track option at vital stretches. But here, too, myopic planning 

has created fresh bottlenecks.

Nothing summed up the roller-coaster ride better than 

the 11.6-km stretch cutting right through Rajarhat and straight to the airport. 

Within months of being crowned top track, whole sections have sunk into the ground.

TECH amp; TARGETS 

What does road repair have to do with the richest 

man in India? Lots, if Azim Premji is visiting Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s dream 

bastion (no, not Writers?, but Saltlec).

It was a big bang year for Bhattacharjee?s blue-eyed 

information technology (IT) sector, with the high point being the inauguration 

of Wipro?s centre in Sector V.

Then there was Mukesh Ambani talking about basing 

a bit of his tech dreams in Bengal. But if the Ambani big brother first has to 

get his own house in order, so do Manab Mukherjee and Co. Just take a trip to 

Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune, Gurgaon or Chandigarh to find out why.

WILL amp; WAR 

How does a city grab the mindshare of the moneyed 

class? With a scandal, of course.

A will showed the way for Calcutta to dominate national 

business gossip (till, of course, A dislodged B). The Birla battle over R.S. Lodha?s 

claims not only dragged the affairs of the first family of Indian business into 

the public domain. It also forced legal eagles like Ram Jethmalani, son Mahesh 

and Arun Jaitley to land in Calcutta High Court, at regular intervals.

GRUB amp; GRUMBLE

There are restaurants stirring up a storm around the 

city at an almost alarming rate. Every mall and quiet street corner has them, 

the city centre, and City Centre, too. New restaurants (La Cucina, Orko?s, KK?s 

Fusion, Marco Polo in China, Chicky?s, Sourav?s?), expansion and renovation (Mainland 

China and Flurys), coffee shops brewing at every corner? 

There?s something cooking everywhere and there?s someone 

going everywhere, but please don?t expect experiments with culinary truths. 

Most kitchens have chosen to play it safe (read lots 

of Indian and Chinese, with a little bit of this and that) or display a singular 

lack of thought for taste. And for a city said to be finally taking the fast track, 

please can we see some fast food? KFC may soon be joining the new Pizza Hut at 

City Centre, but then, where?s the Big Mac? 

LOUNGE amp; LIMBO

Calcutta, they say, is in the grip of lounge culture. 

The new heir to the nightlife throne is almost set to knee out the reigning nightlife 

king, the disco. It all started with one little corner in Shisha, but now you 

can lounge around at several destinations, dotting the city entertainment map.

But don?t step out in your pyjamas and kick off your 

dancing shoes, just yet. For, the lounges we love to love are, going strictly 

by the book, not lounges. Internationally, the lounge is essentially a 

place where there is ?no dance floor?, has ?very soft music?, and is ?somewhere 

people can relax over a drink?.

Here, the party crowd only feels at home where it 

can lounge one moment and limbo the other. So, lounge we will, with a dance floor 

a foot?s length away!

BEAM amp; BLOCK

There were never more channels to surf and never more 

beam blocks to watch out for. If STAR One, Animax, Smile, Hungama, Discovery Travel 

 amp; Living led the charge of the channels this year, chances are most ? if not 

none ? didn?t make it to your screens. 

And not just new channels, perennial favourites like 

sports or soaps, too, did the disappearing act, thanks to constant cable spats.

The consumer kept on paying his cable bill, but was 

denied his viewership due, from Tendulkar to Tulsi.

BRIGHT amp; BLUE

Caramel popcorn, digital Dolby and Shah Rukh Khan. 

The multiplex-ruled this year as single-screen theatres fought a losing battle. 

If there?s Garfield at the cineplex, there?s live fat cats at the standalone 

halls; if there?s stadium seating here, there are broken chairs there? 

In screen terms, ?04 was brighter than ever before 

and, in the Calcutta of stark contrasts, also more dismal than ever before.

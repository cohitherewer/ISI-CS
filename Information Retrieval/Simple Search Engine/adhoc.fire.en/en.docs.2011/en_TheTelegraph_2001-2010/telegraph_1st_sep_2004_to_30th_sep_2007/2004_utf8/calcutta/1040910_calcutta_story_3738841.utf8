The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bengali nights in Milan 

A touch, feel, taste and try of Bengal

 - Weeklong culture, trade hardsell at Italian business hub

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sabyasachi Mukherjee: A suitable showcase

 Darjeeling tea, jute, Kalighat patas, shola and... Pepsi. 

 Just a few flavours of Bengal that Milan will sample later this month. The state is a partner for Asia Week ? or Le Vie Dell?Oriente ? a lifestyle exhibition to take place from September 25 to October 3 in the Italian commercial capital, announced Indian and Italian officials on Thursday.

 The extravaganza will, the partners hope, help supplant (or, at least, supplement) Italy?s association of Calcutta with Mother Teresa and abject poverty. Apart from the exhibition of art and culture, commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen will visit the country for a 10-day hardsell Bengal tour, examining avenues in gems and jewellery, food processing and leather.

 For Asia Week, Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong will also be represented by a large contingent at the exhibition forum. But India is the highlight of the cultural line-up, starting with a gala dinner on September 24, where craftsmen from Bengal will demonstrate their work, coordinated by Nandita Pal Choudhury.

 It ?happened by chance?, clarified Andrea Bonardi, secretary-general, Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce, that Sabyasachi ?Pepsi? Mukherjee was chosen for the Asian show on September 25 at the Milan Fashion Week.

 ?It is extremely fortunate he was selected,? smiled Bonardi. He was chosen by the Milan fashion council from amongst ?13 Indian designers, including Rohit Bal and Malini Ramani?, he added.

 ?I feel immensely privileged to come from a part of the country that is considered the armpit of the fashion industry and get the chance to display my work on a platform I only dreamt of,? said Sabyasachi. ?I would like to thank Calcutta? In a city of so much warmth, you can?t help but do good work.? 

 On September 27, an Indian and Thai jewellery show will take place. 

 The following evening will see danseuse Tanushree Shankar perform with her troupe. Asian handicrafts, cuisine and ayurvedic treatment will be available for a touch, feel, taste and try through the week.

 Heritage hotel Principe di Savoia, an arena near the main city cathedral, and Asia House in the business hub will host the trade and craft events.

 There will be a number of seminars as well, to explore the potential for investment in India and effective cooperation between the two countries.

 The industry minister will also utilise the trip to travel to Vincenza, a jewellery hub, to promote the jewellery park Manikanchan, explained Gopal Krishna, managing director, West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation. 

 At Parma, food-processing links will be furthered and in Florence, leather units will be tapped.

 After a year of active ties between Bengal and Italy, a number of bullish promises have been made, but little money has flown into the state yet. On Thursday, officials clarified that contacts could only be forged by the government; individual projects depend on business plans and investors.

 ?But this is the time to promote Bengal massively. Other Indian states and China have been attracting all the attention from Italy,? said Bonardi. ?Bengal has to show it can give better and more reliable infrastructure. It doesn?t happen in a few months.?

 Will Bengal sample a similar slice of Italy ? apart from at the pizzerias ? any time soon? The happy answer is yes. Festa Italiana is set to come to Mumbai, Delhi and Calcutta before the year is through.

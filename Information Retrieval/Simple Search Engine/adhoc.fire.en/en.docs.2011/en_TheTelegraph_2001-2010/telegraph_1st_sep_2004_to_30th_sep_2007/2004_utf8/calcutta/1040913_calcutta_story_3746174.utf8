The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Anokhi at Forum

L Zone

SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

Back in the late 60s, an English lady called Faith 

Hardy came to Jaipur and engaged a group of tailors and block printers to make 

some clothes for friends who wished to open a shop in London. A tiny store was 

opened at the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur to sell what missed export mark. The shop 

was called Anokhi.

Slowly the business started spreading its wings and 

now, more than three decades later, Anokhi is an international chain supporting 

a whole community of block makers and hand block printers through its textile 

company based in Jaipur. With stores across the US and Europe, apart from all 

major Indian cities, Anokhi has pioneered the development of traditional Rajasthani 

hand block printing through its range of clothes and furnishings. 

The Calcutta outlet at the Forum shopping mall was 

opened in April 2003. The relatively new addition to the chain has already made 

its presence felt on the shopping circuit. The Anokhi skirt ? the cotton crushed 

variety in vegetable colours with Rajasthani prints ? managed to add to the skirt 

rage here and is still riding the popularity wave. ?Soon after the launch of the 

store, crushed skirts became a big hit. So much so, that we have not been able 

to meet the demand for it. People come back looking for the skirts and curse us 

for not having enough stock. And not just in Calcutta, I get orders from as far 

as Assam,? says Amita Raha, manager of the Calcutta store. 

Garments galore

The collections, available for women, men and kids, 

are a mix of contemporary western and Indian wear. For women, the biggest hit 

is, of course, the crushed skirt range, priced at Rs 980. The panelled skirt, 

in which a single skirt can have as many as 41 panels with elaborate embroidery 

on each, is another draw. This is more expensive at Rs 1,850. Also on offer are 

tops, kurtas, kurtis, dresses, night wear like kaftans, night-suits 

and dressing gowns. There are lycra trousers, capris, wrap-arounds and A-line 

skirts. The other hits with the women are scarves and dupattas in cotton 

and chiffon. A small selection of saris in Chinese silk chiffon, kotah and 

mul is also offered. The tops are priced from Rs 350 onwards, while the 

kurta sets start at around Rs 1,500.

The men?s collection is much narrower and boasts short 

kurtas, long kurtas and kurta-style shirts, all priced between 

Rs 590 and Rs 750. The kids are pampered with cute little crinkled skirt sets 

that can double as lehngas.

Linen lot

The home furnishings section at Anokhi is as breathtaking 

(picture by Rashbehari Das). Bedspreads, cushion covers, table linen, quilts, 

throws, razais and curtains ? the collection is quite comprehensive, in 

trademark block prints teamed with embroidery. The colours are primarily earth 

tones like orange, rust, black, yellow and vibrant blues.

The bedspreads are priced at Rs 750 onwards, while 

the tablecloths start at around Rs 265 and go up to Rs 610. There are quilts for 

kids, which cost Rs 450 and king-size ones at Rs 1,880, with various sizes in 

between. The exquisite embroidered throws start at Rs 1,450 for the singles and 

soar up to Rs 10,000 for the king-sized.

Bag it

Another unique offering from the store is a line of 

cloth bags. There are cotton batuas in a number of sizes, ornamental bags, 

weekend bags, overnight bags and wash bags, between Rs 100 and Rs 500.

A line of silver jewellery with stones is a new addition 

to Anokhi?s repertoire. ?Since our clothes have a khadi kind of look, silver 

jewellery goes well with it. The line flies off the rack as soon as we get new 

stock,? smiles Amita.

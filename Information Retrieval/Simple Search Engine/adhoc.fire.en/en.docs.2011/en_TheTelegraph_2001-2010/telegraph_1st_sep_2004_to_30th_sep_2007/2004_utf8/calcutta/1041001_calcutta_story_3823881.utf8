The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

Good time to take the upper hand and put the out-of-towners 

in the gang in their place. The city?s been the cynosure of all shutterbugs and 

how! Feed on the stylebhais and the cricket czars or be the jabber-not 

in the party.

Milan maverick

If you thought Pepsi was just a sweet cola, it?s about 

time you hung up your shoes. It?s just one of the names the painfully young couture 

king of Calcutta is known by, though you ought to count in Sabya and Sabyasachi 

as well. That the 28-year-old has gone all the way to Milan, clothes, models and 

dreams in tow to storm Milan Fashion Week should win the lad kudos from Bengal 

and beyond. Whether he does another Browns or not remains to be seen but that 

the south Calcutta-based designer is going places is good enough for some drool. 

And if the Behala boy?s halo gets another hiding from Brett Lee and Co, maybe 

we should take the prince of Calcooota crown to Hazra, instead.

All in the game

Cricket may not be the game all of you play but tuning 

in to a little off-the-pitch battle is a must ? if you don?t want to be caught 

off a mistimed sweep. In case you?ve been napping longer than normal, catch up 

on the mother of all board battles before stepping out. For the twists and turns 

on BCCI big day left even seasoned game-players stunned. How Ranbir Singh finally 

scraped past Union minister Sharad Pawar by a casting-vote whisker, 16-15, thanks 

entirely to ?bowler-umpire? Jagmohan Dalmiya should keep the pot boiling for the 

party night. Court cases, political power play and tales told by suitcases? and 

you thought the gentleman?s game was boring!

Beyonce bounce

As you uncork that bubbly this weekend, do spare a 

thought for yet another pop diva taking recourse to some fragrant fun. After J 

Lo, it?s now Beyonce Knowles? turn to bring a whiff of fresh air into her bank 

balance with a perfume promotion for Tommy Hilfiger. It sure is titter time as 

the 22-year-old finally turns a True Star and all just for lying on a sofa and 

singing Wishing On A Star. ?It?s the easiest job I?ve ever done and was 

extravagantly overpaid,? is a confession you?ve got to digest if you are counting 

on the vanity fair plank.

Popcorn punch

With or without the Kajol?s sister tag, Tanishaa finally 

finds herself at home playing a teenybopper in Kabir Sadanand?s directorial debut 

Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao! The storyline that tries to relate friendship 

and love may sound like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai but item girl Jelena?s thumkas 

is enough to get you mast. And with Ja re ja babe Rashmi Nigam slipping 

into the bath tub, it?s more like spicy phuchka fare than the plain ol? 

popcorn. (Phuchka khao! Mast ho jao! is Rashmi?s suggested title for a 

Bengali debut!)

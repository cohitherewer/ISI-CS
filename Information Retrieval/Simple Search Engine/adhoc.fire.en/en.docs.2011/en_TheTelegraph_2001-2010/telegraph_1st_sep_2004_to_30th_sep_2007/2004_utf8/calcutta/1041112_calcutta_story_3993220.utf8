How long can it take for a captain to get his field placements right? On Thursday afternoon, skipper Sourav Ganguly took close to an hour for the perfect placements ? from the welcome bouquets at first slip to the Black Cat security guards at extra cover.

 Playing the perfect host at the inauguration of Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion, the Team India captain reached 20G Park Street at noon, a full hour before the 1 pm flag-off. And instantly, he took charge on what, he confessed, was foreign soil.

 ?When I first saw this place it was empty and then when I saw it recently, everything was done,? said Sourav. If that suggests Maharaj is more a non-playing skipper in this Pavilion, his friends and partners managing the food stop ? under Abhishek Entertainment amp; Foods Pvt Ltd ? don?t seem to mind.

 ?When Sourav is playing he doesn?t respond to either our calls or SMSs and yet when he?s here he gives his 100 per cent to this place,? said one of Sourav?s new-found team members.

 As word of the captain?s arrival spread, hundreds gathered outside the ornate gates of the driveway to the restaurant even as the magic word ? ?Sachin ashbe? ? spread.

 Cordoned off, the fans were not about to give up. And their patience paid off as their favourite stars descended on Park Street ? Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Harbajan Singh, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Ajit Agarkar.

 The Prince of Calcutta?s Team India mates were followed by Pakistan cricket captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and his son.

 As Sachin and Inzamam, in T-shirts blue and green, paused to cut the red ribbon, shouts of ?Sachin, Sachin? and ?Inzy, Inzy? rent the November air, highlighting the Food Pavilion camaraderie before the Eden Gardens conflict. The cricketers headed for Prince of Cal, the lounge on the fourth floor to, well, lounge around. In black jumper and denims, Rahul Dravid was a top draw, along with teen heartthrob Irfan in white sweatshirt, among autograph hunters and camera phone-flashing fans in the 2,500 sq ft stylised setting.

 Just after 2 pm, host Sourav escorted his guests to the multi-cuisine restaurant on the second floor, where a lunch buffet of soup, salad, dahi vada, fried rice, naan, dal makhni, kadai paneer, fish fry, garlic chicken, mutton kosha and desserts had been laid out. A quick lunch later, the cricketers zipped off for nets. If they were bowled over on Thursday, the city gets a chance to check out One Day (24-hour coffee shop), Over Boundary (non-veg multi-cuisine), Maharaj (vegetarian Indian) and Prince of Cal (lounge bar) from Friday.

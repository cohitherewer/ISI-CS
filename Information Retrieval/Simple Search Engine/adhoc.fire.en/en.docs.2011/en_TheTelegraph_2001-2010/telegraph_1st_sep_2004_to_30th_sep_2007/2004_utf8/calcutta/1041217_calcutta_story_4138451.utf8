 Students cry rights

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Students from the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM Hospital presented their case to the West Bengal human rights commission on Thursday, the third day of their agitation and indefinite fast.

 ?We got a patient, three-hour hearing from a two-member panel that included chairman Justice Shyamal Sen,? said Soumyadip Chatterji, representing the students of the SSKM institute, and those of Midnapore Medical College, whose names were struck off the colleges? rolls on Monday.

 This followed a Supreme Court order directing the state government to drop 69 NRI-quota students from the course at the two institutes.

 ?We have been told that director of medical education C. R. Maiti will be summoned by the panel to face charges of human rights violation,? added student Gargi Bhattacharya. 

 Five students, accompanied by seven parents, met the rights panel, Bhattacharya elaborated. 

 ?The students pleaded that their human rights were being violated, and that they should be allowed to continue with their studies,? she said.

 At the institute, the hunger strike continued. ?Why are we being treated like this?? a student complained.

 Still considering the idea of reinstating the axed medical students in alternative colleges, the state government remained ambiguous about whether the 69 students would be accommodated in medical courses or in other technical institutes.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Thursday that the state had filed an affidavit in Supreme Court on Wednesday. Chief secretary Ashok Gupta had flown to Delhi to supervise the process.

 Government officials said the state had submitted a compliance report on Thursday on the earlier order, as desired by the apex court. 

 The state government has also initiated the admission process for filling up the 69 seats by issuing advertisements in the media.

 The students will be selected from the merit list of the Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) 2003. Those seeking admission will have to apply to the chairman of the central selection committee (medical) on or before December 18.

 Cops eye hospital revival

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The Howrah police top brass, eyeing better and modern healthcare for ailing members of their force, are set to revive the hospital in the Shibpur Police Lines, lying defunct for years now.

 Though its still in a nascent stage, we think the proposal will be okayed soon, said police superintendent Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya. Director-general of police Shyamal Dutta had inspected the hospital a month ago and held out the assurance of doing the needful.

 After the inspection, we submitted a formal proposal with the development plans to the government, superintendent Bhattacharya added. 

 Officials stressed the need for a hospital in the police lines of a vast district like Howrah. At present, due to lack of facilities, very few policemen come here for treatment, they added.

 The hospital, with 104 beds, started its downhill journey in 1993.The number of beds dwindled to 30.

 Post-renovation, the hospital will have 50 beds. There will be an intensive care unit with another six beds and a modern operating theatre. A pathology department is also on the cards. Equipment worth Rs 22 lakh, lying defunct since February 2003, will also be utilised. 

 The hospital has just one doctor, 18 nurses, four ward boys, three sweepers and two Group D staff. The staff strength will be increased and more doctors employed, assured superintendent Bhattacharya. The revival also figured in an Assembly discussion, he added.

 Part of the hospital has been taken over by outsiders, who are running an illegal polyclinic in it.

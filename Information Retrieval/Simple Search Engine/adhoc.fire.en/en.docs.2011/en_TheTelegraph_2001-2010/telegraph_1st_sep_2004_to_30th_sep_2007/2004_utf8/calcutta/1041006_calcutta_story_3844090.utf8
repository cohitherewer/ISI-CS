Fast forward: Collective travel can keep the carriageways

 Offices and schools should make the car pool system mandatory. It will help office-goers as well as school students reach their destinations on time. The system will definitely lessen the traffic burden on our already crowded roads.

Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 

 Hooghly

 Making a car pool system mandatory for offices and schools cannot be accepted as feasible. Most schools and offices hire cars from agencies and use them. Such cars on rent should not be used for running on a pool system. Moreover, schools and offices cannot afford to buy so many cars to make the system worthwhile. No organisation will agree to the car pool system if it is not cost effective as well.

 Offices and schools should definitely make the car pool system mandatory to reduce the vehicle count on the streets of the city. Private cars and taxis are especially responsible for the massive traffic load on our city?s streets. A mandatory car pool system will be able to reduce the traffic menace in Calcutta.

Subhobrata Basu, 

 Ballygunge Station Road

 Calcutta is reeling under the pressure of an ever-increasing number of vehicles on the streets. A mandatory car pool system could be implemented at least in the schools and parents should be discouraged to send their wards to school in private vehicles. As this could only be a temporary solution to reduce the vehicle count on the streets, a long term plan is required.

Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake 

 The number of vehicles on the streets of Calcutta is increasing day by day, such that a free flow of vehicles on the streets is almost impossible. So if travelling to school or office in a pool system becomes mandatory, it will lower the vehicle count on the streets and as a result the city will be considerably freed of traffic congestion. 

Gyaneshwar Pandey,

 Tollygunge 

 All offices and schools should have a car pool system and it should be made compulsory. It will help in tackling Calcutta?s terrible traffic situation and reducing vehicular pollution. It is also a good way to save time and will also prove safe for schoolchildren. 

Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake 

 In metropolitan cities, pollution and accidents cannot be avoided by introducing the car pool system. School timings vary between junior and senior sections. Many a time, office-goers return late or report earlier than required thanks to the uncertain traffic flow on the roads. We can, however, have cars belonging to individuals, but shared for office purposes by many, plying on alternate days of the week. Also roads used for emergency services could be kept separate. 

Sujoy Roy,

 Sodepur 

 Making the car pool system mandatory cannot be accepted as a good idea. In the absence of attendants in car pools, children, who are curious by nature, might wander away on the way back home. Drivers may not be sensitive to their needs. 

Md. Ayub, 

 Bright Street

 Compared to other metropolitan cities, road space in Calcutta is meagre. Therefore, it might be a good idea to introduce a mandatory car pool system in offices and schools to lower the vehicle count on the streets during office hours. An increase in traffic personnel deployed during rush hours will help control the chaos better. 

Debasish Chakraborty,

 Cossipore

Offices and schools should pool resources to buy cars 

for their own convenience. This will help employees by reducing the excessive 

expenditure of buying individual cars. This will be of service to everyone. Most 

importantly, such joint ventures will lower the vehicle count on the streets and 

check air pollution. 

Bhupen Bose,

Dum Dum Park

Thousands of people come to Calcutta every day in 

search of jobs. Thus, there has been a tremendous increase in population. Subsequently, 

the number of vehicles has increased rapidly compared to the roadspace. In such 

a scenario, a mandatory car pool system for offices and schools may be of help. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata 

 The total road space in Calcutta is only six per cent whereas the international standard has been set at 33 per cent of the total area of any city. A lower number of vehicles will ease the traffic jams in Calcutta. So it is essential to lower the numbers of vehicles used by office-goers and students. A mandatory car pool system is a good alternative.

Arindam Ray, 

 Salt Lake 

 A car pool system should immediately be made mandatory. It will not only lower the vehicle count on the streets but also serve as a fuel-saving measure which is the need of the hour. If the number of vehicles plying on the roads gets less because the car pool systems, it will obviously result in less air pollution. It will also reduce the number of accidents and keep the roads in better condition.

P. Pramanik, 

 Santoshpur Avenue 

 The system is already in existence in a limited number of schools and offices. If every organisation makes a car pool system mandatory, it may bring comfort to the commuter but will not lessen the traffic problem as envisaged. 

Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge 

 Theoretically the proposal is welcome but practically it is not feasible. Generally office staff and students come from different parts of the metropolis and districts. Naturally, to pick all of them up from different corners, a huge number of cars will be needed. This will only increase the frequency of traffic snarls. Public transports are more efficient in handling such a large number of commuters. 

Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia

 Given the trend of increase in the number of vehicles on the streets of Calcutta, different offices and institutions should make the car pool system mandatory to lower the vehicle count on the streets. The proposed idea would ease the movement of vehicles and help pedestrians to navigate streets better. 

Biman Saha, 

 Lake Town 

 Making a car pool system mandatory is an impractical proposition. If such a system is forced on people, it will not be possible for all office-goers and parents of school students to afford it, and it will not be right to compel them to adopt such a costly alternative. Again, if it is mandatory, won?t the cars used for the pool system add to the vehicle count on the streets, rather than decrease it?

Virendra Shah, 

 Amratala Lane 

 Considering that the number of cars on Calcutta?s streets has already reached saturation point, it will be great if the car pool system is made compulsory, at least for offices and schools. This will ensure less congestion, lower chances of accidents and help reduce pollution. But this measure cannot be the only solution to the problem. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala 

 If the car pool system is made mandatory, the number of buses and trams may come down without the patronage of the office and school-going crowd, but the number of vehicles will actually increase. Also, drivers and conductors will be left jobless and even taxi-drivers will be hit. Besides, if office-goers and students fail to reach the designated spot at the right time, they may miss the car.

Mumuksha Dey, 

 Bangur Avenue 

 In view of the rising vehicle count on the streets, a mandatory car pool system is a good solution to the traffic problem in Calcutta. A compulsory car pool system at schools and offices may reduce the vehicle count on the streets and ease traffic snarls. But we need understanding people, too, who would be open enough to share their cars with colleagues travelling to the same area.

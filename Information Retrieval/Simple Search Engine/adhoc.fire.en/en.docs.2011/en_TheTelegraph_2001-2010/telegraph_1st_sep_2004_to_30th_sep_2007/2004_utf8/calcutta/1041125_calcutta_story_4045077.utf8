 Soap star opera oomph

 A small-screen-star troupe trekked through town on Wednesday. Akashdeep Saigal, Nausheen Ali and Ashim Samantha took time out from their packed schedules to spend some time in the city.

 Akashdeep is best known as the man the country loves to hate. And, as it turns out, he loves to be hated, too. He is Ansh Gujral on the popular soap Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.

 ?I think the role is a blessing in disguise. After stepping into Ansh?s shoes, my popularity has skyrocketed,? smiles Akashdeep, who has also had a few big screen dalliances in the form of box-office duds Pyar Main Kabhi Kabhie and Supari. But Kyunki? has brought him the fame he was waiting for.

 Nausheen Ali is the woman we first got to know as Kkusum, who is now battling her fears for her love of acting. A few ghosts aren?t likely to keep Ali away from a challenging role.

 The classical dancer gave up Kkusum as she was ?not comfortable with a time jump in the serial?. In search of variety, she struck out.

 And variety is what she found, all in one show. She is playing a triple roll in the supernatural serial KalCchakra. ?After I gave up Kkusum, I worked in a Pakistani serial called Ana,? explains Nausheen. ?In KalCchakra, I am playing one negative and two positive rolls.? She is also set to make her big-screen debut next year with Accident, co-starring Naseeruddin Shah.

 The director of KalCchakra Ashim Samanta was also in town. The maker of movies like Amne Samne and Main Awara Hoon has previously made Dil Vil Pyar Vyar for Sony.

 A Mexican TV show inspired Samanta to film 90 episodes for Indian audiences, instead of a film he was toying with. Though the serial is a supernatural thriller, it packs in an emotional punch for prime-time audiences.

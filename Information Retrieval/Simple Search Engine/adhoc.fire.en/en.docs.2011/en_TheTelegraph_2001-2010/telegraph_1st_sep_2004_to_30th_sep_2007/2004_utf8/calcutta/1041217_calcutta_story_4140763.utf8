The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

No war, peace please

Ahmed Wurrie, 21, had a happy home 10 years ago, with 

his parents and younger sister. But like every other citizen of Sierra Leone, 

his life was touched by war in more ways than one. And like most, now that the 

conflict has ended, he is trying to put the pieces of his life back together, 

with some helping hands lending support.

Ahmed Wurrie, 21, had a happy home 10 years ago, with 

his parents and younger sister. But like every other citizen of Sierra Leone, 

his life was touched by war in more ways than one. And like most, now that the 

conflict has ended, he is trying to put the pieces of his life back together, 

with some helping hands lending support. His father died in a crossfire on the 

streets of Freetown, the capital of the African nation. He became a refugee. One 

day, he was kidnapped by rebels and forcefully made to join their army. At the 

time, he was 15 years old. For a year, he ended up in a rebel military camp, carrying 

ammunition. ?I never had to shoot a gun. I just had to carry the ammunition,? 

he says, thankful that he doesn?t have blood on his hands, however forced. 

Now, he?s helping thousands of others like himself 

get over the horrors of one of the most brutal wars in modern history. Through 

the NGO PeaceLinks, based in Freetown, Ahmed is reaching out to the youngsters 

with the message of peace and goodwill. He has found his family, and is training 

to be a tailor through an apprenticeship.

Millions of civilians were victims of mutilations 

in the more-than-decade-old civil war that wracked the nation, between the Revolutionary 

United Front (RUF) and government forces. The rebels hacked of limbs, ears and 

other body parts of villagers, including children, who live mainly on agriculture, 

thus ruining their livelihood. Hundreds of children were captured and forced into 

the rebel army.

The situation eased in 2001. Earlier this year, elections 

were held and the trial of the RUF rebels began in a UN-backed war crimes court. 

But even food for the starving thousands is hard to 

come by. Some aid agencies have accused the world of forgetting about this crisis 

and concentrating on regions in the public eye, like Afghanistan and Iraq. Normalcy 

might be a distant dream, but some people are doing what it takes to make life 

a little better.

Joining Ahmed in the movement are other youngsters 

keen to rebuild their lives and take their country towards a better future. Others 

like 17-year-old Iamaco Laibah, who has three sisters and two brothers, but lives 

alone with her aunt. She is a facilitator at PeaceLinks, talking to students in 

schools about a variety if issues, like HIV/AIDS awareness.

There?s also Tamba Mbayoh, who is from south Sierra 

Leone. He is a talented artist, making quite a name for himself in poster competitions 

around the country, winning prizes galore. He has found solace in art and music, 

and is doing his bit to spread a little happiness. ?I am just happy to be alive 

and well and doing something good. I want to thank everyone who has helped me,? 

he told Young Metro over phone from Freetown, before singing a few lines 

on brotherhood.

Ibrahim Alex Bangura is perhaps one of the most famous 

PeaceLinks members, having won a UN youth peace prize. But as Emerson Kamara, 

director of the NGO, says: ?We all just want to forget the horrors of war and 

get on with our lives.?

Name 

change

Many Calcuttans are strongly against the change of 

name of Park Street. There is no problem with naming a street after Mother Teresa, 

but changing Park Street?s name doesn?t reflect the work of Blessed Teresa of 

Calcutta. Park Street is full of pubs, nightclubs, restaurants and other forms 

of entertainment. Mother?s motto was to help the poor and the needy. Mayor Subrata 

Mukherjee says Park Street is the hub of action and in the heart of the city. 

But how does this activity make it fit to be named Mother Teresa Sarani? Why not 

name the road in front of Mother House after her? Also, Park Street is one of 

the oldest streets in Calcutta. A number of elderly people are rueful about the 

name change. Does public opinion matter to policy-makers?

Blame game

An unfortunate incident took place during the final 

match of the Federation Cup, which claimed the life of Dempo striker Cristiano 

Junior . This mishap once again reminded us of the lack of medical arrangements 

in Indian football matches. The presence of good doctors could have saved Junior?s 

life. To cover up the football federation?s lapses, goalkeeper Subrata Pal is 

being made into a scapegoat. We should all stand by Subrata Pal.

The sudden death of Dempo?s Brazilian striker Cristiano 

Junior in the Federation Cup final is a big blow to all football fans.The mishap 

was due to medical reasons and not because of an attack by Mohun Bagan goalkeeper 

Subrata Pal. It is ridiculous to blame him. It is the duty of the goalkeeper to 

try his best to save a goal. In doing so, he may accidentally hurt a player, but 

never to such an extent that the player would lose his life. He wasn?t even given 

a card, but now his salary is being deducted and a warning being given. It is 

not easy to live with the guilt. Such an accusation might seriously affect his 

career. For the welfare of football, we should stop blaming Pal. Medical tests 

should be conducted before matches to avoid such incidents, instead of punishing 

players.

Cell sense

The recent incident in DPS, R.K. Puram, Delhi, was 

not that great a shock for many schoolchildren in the country. It was just made 

public. Thankfully, it is raising awareness among school authorities, affluent 

parents and students. The cell phone is a necessary device. Instead of banning 

it, the authorities should restrict extravagance. Surely students don?t need cameras 

and MMS services while in school. Also, instead of attacking students after something 

happens, it would be prudent to introduce sex education in schools.

Next Friday is Christmas Eve. If there?s something 

on your wishlist you want Santa to know at the last minute, send Young Metro 

a letter.

The 

Ultimate Summons

When under the grove, or side the sea

When the gleaming sun ceases to be

When the worldly thoughts slowly fade

Swallowing grave where I?ll be laid

Pervades my mind and makes me think

Of my hollow life and the natural link

Of me with spiritual joys ? denied

Of wisdom ? wealth which be left behind

When summons from His kingdom

To his servant on earth, come.

Father?s shoulders, Mother?s lap,

With friends and the days of hap? ?

Like rainbow-colours which slowly melt

Into 

streams into oceans, my spirit knelt

Before the mighty pool of universal glow,

And forms the breeze over lush fields flow

Making static grass with life ? form sway ?

?Haps this is what my manifest may

When summons from His kingdom

To his servant on earth, come.

Russel Haque,

Class XII, La Martiniere for Boys

Nowhere

Shuttling between worlds ?

No rest,

No roots.

Broken twigs I carry in my palms;

On my wings drying tendrils.

No nest I have.

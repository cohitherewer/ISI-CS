The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Footloose and fashion free

Sabya speak

Sabyasachi Mukherjee reviews the 

trends that ruled the ramp in 2004 and looks ahead at the ones thatll dominate 

the coming year

Two parallel and contradicting trends emerged in 2004. 

One was tailored sophistication. Lines became cleaner, more refined, almost bordering 

on the classic, backed by luxury and glamour. Alternatively, there was a strong 

emergence of bohemian grunge. This was not dishevelled, rag-doll grunge, but one 

with sophistication, wit and humour. It refined and redefined luxury.

Fashion was seen becoming less in-your-face, with 

more subtle details and quiet intelligence and emotion.

obally, in women?s wear, the predominant themes were 

English rose, Zen, and what I fondly call soul curry ? a mishmash of cross-cultural 

kitsch silhouettes with a dash of spirituality thrown in. I saw a huge effort 

to create a window of escape for the consumer who had been overfed on commercial 

couture and was sick of seeing the same thing everywhere.

A very important trend that has crept in and is here 

to stay is layering. It gives the wearer an opportunity to interpret clothes in 

their own unique way rather than wearing an ensemble off the rack. Strictly speaking, 

2004 has been the year of separates rather than ensembles. (The new layering is 

free-spirited, as opposed to structured layers of old; this is almost hippie.) 

The order of the day has been do as you like.

One of the strongest trends has been the re-emergence 

of trinkets and charms, around the neck, waist, or simply hanging from the handle 

of a handbag. This is part of an attempt to personalise a generic item. Accessories 

have made a huge comeback.

Vintage was big and remains a predominant theme in 

2005. Even in India, there has been a strong European vintage sensibility, where 

rani pinks, parrot greens and bright purples gave way to old rose pinks, 

cinnamon, olive greens and pale blues.

Lounge wear made a strong comeback in mainstream fashion 

in the form of capes and ponchos. But the biggest trend of 2004 has been the return 

of the skirt, in all shapes and sizes. It has been the real fashion blockbuster.

The key trend for 2005?s fashion is optimism, be it 

colours, silhouettes or even the general fashion mindset. So there will be a re-emergence 

of powdery colours and silhouettes that will be easy to wear, pretty and nostalgic. 

Green becomes a very strong colour next season as the world becomes more ecologically 

aware.

Spring-summer 2005 will see a riot of colours and 

floral prints, checks and stripes co-existing side by side with white, nude and 

ecru. The focus will be on clothes that have lateral mobility, which means items 

that can be worn with a whole range of clothing from last year. 

These will be clothes high on comfort and with unique 

sensibilities, without being bizarrely different. Hopefully, in 2005, the UFOs 

are not going to land on the fashion runways.

The biggest trend for 2005, again like last year, 

would be a free-spirited mindset where mundane marries luxury, different eras 

converge and glamour is interpreted through the mind, not the physical body. No 

longer are things compartmentalised as the ?60s look? or the ?90s look?. You could 

wear bell-bottoms with a military jacket. 

As fashion becomes more cutting edge and the market 

becomes more liberal, the wearer becomes the real designer.

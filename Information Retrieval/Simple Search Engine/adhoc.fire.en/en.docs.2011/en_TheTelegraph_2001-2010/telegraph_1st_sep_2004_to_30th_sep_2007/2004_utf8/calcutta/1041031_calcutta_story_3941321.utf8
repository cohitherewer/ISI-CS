 That?s the way, I like it

 How to recognise a change in choice 

 dynamics and make smart use of marketing budget 

 Remember ?dhoondte rahe jaoge?. 

 I am a fan of this brand. Whenever and wherever I see its 

 new ad, I pause with expectation. 

 There is this new Surf Excel campaign 

 that parades a promotion. The ad shows a kid running on 

 the street holding aloft a piece of white cloth with an 

 ink-coloured circle in the middle. He generates a lot of 

 curiosity among passers-by. Eventually, he washes the cloth 

 and the ink-coloured circle disappears like a stain. On 

 the stain-free cloth is written the prize from Surf Excel 

 ? a scholarship worth Rs 5 lakh.

 What is so unusual about this 

 ad? Well, a number of things. Let me start with the most 

 obvious one. Promotions for brands are more often than not 

 tactical weapons. A gift is offered to the consumer to gain 

 short-term patronage or to engineer enhanced consumption. 

 Choice of these gifts is usually governed by what can be 

 bought cheap rather than any brand-related factors.

 The Surf Excel promotion offers 

 a scholarship as the prize ? nothing unusual there. The 

 real masterstroke is in the design of the promotion. No 

 cards to scratch here to find out what prize you have won. 

 A stain is used, instead, as a mask. The stain has to be 

 removed to know what the prize is. What a clever way of 

 underscoring the core promise of Surf Excel ? stain removal. 

 The same rupee is working tactically as well as strategically. 

 It is an extremely rare and intelligent use of the marketing 

 budget.

 The other thing that is striking 

 about the Surf Excel campaign is the vehicle they have used. 

 I saw it during the recent India Australia Test match. It 

 is true that a cricket match being played by Team India 

 is still one of the most-watched spectacles on TV. Little 

 wonder that as a vehicle it allures most advertisers.

 Yet, there are constraints. Audience 

 for cricket matches has a gender bias. Cricket lovers tend 

 to be more males than females. The bias gets accentuated 

 when the cricket is of the five-day variety. So, what is 

 Surf Excel doing there?

 There is an explanation. The main 

 prize on offer in the Surf Excel promotion is a Rs 5 lakh 

 scholarship. Naturally, the visual depiction in the ad is 

 student-focussed ? there are no mothers or daughters (real 

 or in-law) to be seen in the ad. Most of the people in the 

 ad are in their teens. The protagonist himself is barely 

 in his teens. Cricket matches are their favourite events 

 ? so the Surf Excel ad does fit in.

 Wait a minute. Are we saying students 

 decide which detergent is to be bought, rather than which 

 chocolate? Yes, perhaps, the Surf Excel ad does make the 

 point that the consumer algorithm has changed in the TV 

 era. These days, brands of family products are chosen democratically 

 inside a home. An election is called whenever some member 

 feels unhappy enough with the current one or tempted enough 

 by a new one. All members have their individual votes. President 

 of the home is still the mother. So like Mr Dalmiya, she 

 enjoys a casting vote. But casting votes are useful only 

 in a tie. So, under normal circumstances, brand choice in 

 family products is a collective exercise.

 Surf Excel is sensitive enough 

 to recognise this change in the consumer choice dynamics. 

 In this promotion, it is pampering the influencers ? trying 

 to win the peripheral votes. It makes eminent electoral 

 sense.

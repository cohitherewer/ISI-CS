Behind the bar

 Not too long ago, it was hard to find a Scotch drinker who knew there was anything more to great whisky than guzzling whatever was popular. Today?s upscale Scotch connoisseur sips, sniffs and savours his blended tipple the way a wine-snob scrutinises a glass of big-deal Bordeaux. 

 Few would venture to assert the precise moment at which Scotch whisky was first distilled but many are thankful that it was. The fiery liquid can trace its roots back to the ancient Celts who practiced the art of distilling more than 500 years ago, and called it uisge beatha (water of life). The earliest recorded reference to whisky is in 1494 when it was considered a medicine, providing relief from various ailments, and warming the body on a winter night!

 The different categories of whiskies are:

Grain whisky

 This is made with a mix of various grains, mainly maize, wheat and barley. It is used in the creation of blended whisky and not as a drink on its own. 

Malt whisky

All Scotch malt whiskies must be produced only with 

malted barley. Single malts are the product of one distillery alone while vatted 

malts are the product of two or more distilleries mixed to produce a whisky different 

from its ingredients. 

Blended whisky 

 When people ask for Scotch, they usually mean a blended Scotch whisky, which was first created and marketed in the 1950s. It is a blend of as many as 50 individual Scotch malt and Scotch grain whiskies.

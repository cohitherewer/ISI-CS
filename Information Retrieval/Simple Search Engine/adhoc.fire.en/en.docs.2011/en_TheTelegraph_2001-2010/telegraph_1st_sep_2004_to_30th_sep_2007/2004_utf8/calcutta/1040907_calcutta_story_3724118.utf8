 Busting the ghost of ignorance

 As part of its ninth anniversary celebrations, Aladin stages its latest production Bhoot Kando, a humorous play which nonetheless emphasises that ignorant, illiterate people will continue to live in fear and be cheated unless their lives are allowed to be touched by the light of literacy and knowledge. In the play, a conflict between a ghost and a courageous hawker prepares the ground for the enlightenment and eventual uplift of the oppressed villagers. Having won over the phantom of ignorance that had been haunting the villagers, the hawker decides to set up a school in the village, opening up the prospect of a better future for them. Scripted by Biswajit Ghosh, and directed by him and Prasenjit Ghosh, the play is an enjoyable musical with dances and songs, accompanied by lively, entertaining verses composed by Siddhartha Sinha. Performed by a troupe of talented young men and women, this richly metaphorical play serves as a vindication of the urgent need to spread literacy amongst the rural poor, albeit in a light, funny vein.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Riding the reinvention wave

Q amp; A sessions with medical professionals for 

the benefit of members, a solar-heated indoor pool, air-conditioned glass-bubble 

fast-food counter, baby show adjudicated by paediatricians, samosa and sandwich 

for a quick bite and a sit-down continental lunch during Christmas?

In keeping with the grand plans being drawn up for 

the Strand and the riverfront, The Calcutta Swimming Club (picture by Rashbehari 

Das) is also on a reinvention roll to stay in sync. New president Binod Khattry, 

after assuming charge, has unfurled the agenda: to ensure there?s something for 

everyone at the waterside address.

?We are essentially a family club and don?t have a 

strict dress code. However, club rules and decorum are of prime importance and 

members and guests must conduct themselves in a responsible manner. At the same 

time, we are doing our best to make every member of the family feel comfortable 

on the premises,? stresses the president, also a leading gynaecological surgeon.

While the new committee will inaugurate the solar-heated 

inside pool on November 28, the fast-food counter is also being redone, creating 

seating space for around 30 in a glass-shell air-conditioned environment. The 

ladies? changing rooms, all 30 of them, are also being remodelled.

The president?s pet project, however, is introducing 

question-answer sessions for the members. There are interactive sessions being 

run by the ladies? group, but mostly on cookery. ?We are now inviting professionals 

to answer members? queries. For instance, next week, there will be presentations 

by a gynaecologist and a breast specialist. We will try and replicate the interface 

with lawyers, tax professionals and the like,? says Khattry.

The new committee is also revamping the health club 

with a clutch of new instruments being added to the gym, besides a yoga seminar 

and a workshop on Kerala ayurveda massage. ?If it catches on, we might make it 

a permanent feature,? the president promises.

An increased demand for continental food has prompted 

a beef-up missive to the Amber kitchen which caters to the Swimming Club?s tandoori 

and continental needs.

The management also plans to make the Oldies? Nite 

a twice-a-year event, instead of the annual feature now, and also celebrate the 

Punjabi festival of Lori on January 13. The village fair will be celebrated in 

a bigger avatar. The traditional calendar events like the continuous one-mile 

swimming meet or the Friday night candle-lit dinner and musical evening will be 

carried forward with ?renewed gusto?.

So, when the Swimming Club pools reopen in March following 

the winter season with the customary beer mornings, expect quite a froth.

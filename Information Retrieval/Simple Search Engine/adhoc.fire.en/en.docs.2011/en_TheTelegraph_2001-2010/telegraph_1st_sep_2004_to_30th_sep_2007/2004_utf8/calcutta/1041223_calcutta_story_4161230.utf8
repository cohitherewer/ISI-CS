The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You are independent, impatient and always in a hurry. You can be a pioneer and a trendsetter. You take things as they come, but can quickly adapt to unpredictability. You are honest and popular because you don?t make excessive demands on others. Abstain from profit-making ventures. On the money front, you work best under supervision. ? Kusum Bhandari

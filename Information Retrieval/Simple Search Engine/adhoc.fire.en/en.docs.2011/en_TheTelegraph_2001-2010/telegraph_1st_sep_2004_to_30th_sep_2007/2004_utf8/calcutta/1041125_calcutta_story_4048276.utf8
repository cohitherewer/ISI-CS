The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Murder by music

It took him 12 years to find a foothold in the Indian 

music industry. But today, it won?t be wrong to say that Kunal Ganjawala (picture 

below) has arrived. And how! The voice behind Bheegey honth tere (a scene 

from Murder left)is one of the busiest crooners in Bollywood and what?s 

more, he?s the USP of the new Indipop album Channa Vey.

 ?It?s not really my album. I sang two one-off tracks for two private producers. The other tracks in the album have been sung by others. But I have no problem in the album being promoted as mine. The melodies were quite good and I always knew with good promotion, they would work. It?s always the quality that matters to me ? how much I can vocally add to the original tune,? Kunal told Metro.

 Perhaps it is this quality of Kunal that got singer Poornima to handpick him from a college music competition. ?I was an absolute amateur then and only after she took me to all the music directors in town like Anu Malik and Anand-Milind did I start to look at singing seriously. I started training in Hindustani classical but for five years despite the best efforts from Poornimaji, no one was ready to give me songs,? he recounts.

 In 1997, Kunal struck gold when he met musician Ranjit Barot. ?He was working with A. R. Rahman for Vandemataram then and once he heard me, he just entrusted me with all his jingle work. I sang for more than 200 ad jingles for Ranjit in a span of one year. It was during this streak, singing everything from pop to rock to Indian classical, that I rediscovered myself. Having done nothing for the previous five years, my confidence level was really low. But all that changed,? recalls Kunal.

 And then O humdum happened and the spotlight shone bright on Kunal the singer. ?It was amazing to work with Rahman. Having sung so many ad jingles, I was not alien to his style of working late into the night. I had a great time and went on to sing a couple of more songs for him in Lakeer (What?s up and Nach le). Then the songs in Rajshri?s Uff Kya Jadoo Mohabbat Hai and Janaabe ali in Bardaasht were well appreciated.?

 But Anu Malik?s Murder track was something else. ?Bheegey honth really set it up for me. It made film-makers say that they wanted Kunal to sing in their films. It was never a regular antara-mukhda song. But I had no idea it would be such a big rage. You can?t really plan a hit in the studios.?

 Now, it?s music mania time for Kunal. ?I have sung a lovely ballad for the next Bhatt production Zaher. Then there are some interesting tracks for Subhash Ghai?s Kisna, Khalid Mohamed?s Sajda and Deepak Tijori?s Fareb. There?s enough on my plate right now and I just hope I can keep the good work going,? the singer signed off.

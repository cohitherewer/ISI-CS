The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talent is all she has!

 A Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) graduate in a Bollywood masala film? For Koel Purie, it?s par for the course. ?It?s just another genre of films. My vision is world cinema and I want to work in all possible types of cinema ? Spanish, Italian, Tamil, Telugu. In fact, it?s easier because I have grown up watching Bollywood movies,? the young actress told Metro from London.

 The film in question is Soni Razdan?s directorial debut, the Mahesh Bhatt-produced Nazar. ?It?s a full-out Bollywood movie. I play a cop. Ashmit Patel is the male lead. The film is 80 per cent complete. Since it is a thriller, I cannot say more about it.?

 The project that is totally complete and almost ready for release is Vinta Nanda?s White Noise. ?I play a successful soap opera writer in the film but my personal life is full of turmoil. I use alcohol as a crutch. I am basically someone who is too sensitive to the realities of the world,? explained Koel.

 The last time we had seen Koel was in Rahul Bose?s directorial debut Everybody Says I?m Fine. ?I had finished the first two years of my three-year theatre course at RADA. Rahul was ready to shoot his film and he told me how he had written the character of Nikita with me in mind and no one else could do the role. He even scheduled the shootings according to my winter vacation. So I did it,? she recounted. 

 Then Koel rushed back to finish her course and went on to sign three British films. ?All three are made-for-television movies. There?s Indian Dream, there?s Dirty War about a bomb attack in London and Reverse Psychology. I have also done another Indian film, American Daylight, produced by Bobby Bedi, which will release soon. I am also slated to do a film called Aagosh with Jagmohan Mundra where I play a rock star.?

 Coming from a theatre background, Koel doesn?t read too much into the screen versus stage debate. ?Those who say theatre is much more dramatic than cinema are totally wrong. It?s just that theatre is a more focussed discipline. You can?t get away with bad acting. The judgment is instantaneous ? you?ve either got the audience or you haven?t. You cannot add other masala and music to manage the scene.?

 She has decided not to sign any new film till all the releases come through. ?My biggest asset is my talent. I am not a Miss World. I am also not the greatest dancer in the world. While I can do all that, first and foremost I am an actress. So even if the films do not work, people would know what I?m capable of as an actor,? signed off Koel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Munna and the man 

 He is one of the most humble directors you will ever meet in big bad Bollywood. And that?s not because he hasn?t scored a hit yet. His debut film has broken more records at the box-office and garnered more awards than many big first-time hits. After meeting Rajkumar Hirani, you almost don?t believe he is the man behind Munnabhai MBBS.

 Hirani, who learnt editing at the Film Institute in Pune, started off with editing films and then went on to directing ads. He became a part of the extended Vidhu Vinod Chopra family while editing Mission Kashmir. ?I had this idea and once I narrated it to Vinod, he was so excited, he wanted to produce it. Munnabhai was born,? he recounts.

 The film did go on to become one of the biggest hits of last year and Hirani was the most wanted man in Bollywood. ?After the success of Munnabhai, I could have made any film I wanted and that, too, with any banner. I got loads of offers but I simply can?t do any project without Vinod. We are family,? he affirms.

 ?Vinod is an incredible guy. He thinks about cinema 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Sometimes, he would call me up at three in the night and narrate a new idea he had. I can?t imagine working with someone else.?

 Hirani came to Calcutta as creative producer of Parineeta, produced by Chopra and directed by Pradeep Sarkar. ?I do not have any designated job as such. I just look around to see that there are no production hassles. I am not giving any creative input. I?m sure the director wouldn?t want that. But yes, the more the creative forces behind a film, it does help a project to blossom to the fullest.?

 But the inside story says Hirani was in town to narrate his new script to Sanjay Dutt. ?I have scrapped the period film I wanted to make. I wouldn?t really want to talk about the new film until the script is finished. Yes, Sanjay is a part of the film. We are still writing it.?

 He may choose to stay mum, but Hirani?s second directorial venture will be more of Munnabhai. This time, it?s Munnabhai LLB, a legal take on his socio-comical debut feature. ?With Raju?s new film, we?ll again make you laugh a little and cry a little,? promises Dutt.

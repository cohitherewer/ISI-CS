 What We are Watching

 Plain Jane

 Shweta Agarwal: New face in the flock

 Dekho Magar Pyaar Se 

 If you know her, you are sure to fall in love with her. Her beautiful spirit and sweet disposition make up for her less-than-perfect physical appearance. Food is the slave that soothes her empty heart and nurtures her through the pain of having been exiled to boarding school at an early age.

 Catch it on Star Plus from Monday to Thursday at 8 pm

 Why bother? Mega success of Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin prompted Star Plus to launch a serial of this genre. Unlike Jassi..., the serial has not been able to achieve the top slots in the TRP ratings but has been successful in making inroads into drawing rooms.

Mona Singh: On top

 Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin

 Sweet, simple and not so beautiful, Jassi is the role model for millions of middle class girls with middle class values.

 Catch it on Sony from Monday to Thursday at 9.30 pm

 Why bother? This one serial brought Sony back into the reckoning. Jassi?s innocence has made her a favourite with the prime-time viewer and it is her simple sincerity that is winning her all the accolades. People relate to her aspirations and her attitude. An icon, unlikely but true.

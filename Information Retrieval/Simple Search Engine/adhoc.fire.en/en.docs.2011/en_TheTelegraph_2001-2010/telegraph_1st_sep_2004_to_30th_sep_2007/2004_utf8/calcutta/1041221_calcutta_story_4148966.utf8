 Abdul Momen, a father of four and a grandfather of two, runs his household with the earnings from his STD booth. 

 It?s not much, but he manages just fine. 

 Abdul is a happy man, because three of his four children are sporting champions, in multiple disciplines. All three are hearing impaired.

 Walk into the small, yet neat, home in Rajarhat, and there?s no missing the family pride in sporting achievement. On the wall is a wooden board with just the gold medals the trio has won. The rest, including trophies and other prizes, are stored in two cupboards, standing side-by-side in the same room. 

 They just keep coming, and so more of the precious possessions are stashed in bags.

 Abdul?s eldest child ? the only one who is not impaired ? Sk Rakibur Rahman, followed in his father?s footsteps and became a local football champ. Till he tore a cartilage in his knee. Then, he focused his attention on his brother and sisters, who had picked up sports with a passion at Calcutta Deaf and Dumb School.

 Sk Raezur Rahman and his sisters Sabana Yeasmin and Sanam Parvin have taken part in every local and national sporting event organised for the deaf, winning more often than losing. For the international events, though, the family has come a cropper.

 ?My younger son was chosen thrice for the Deaflympics, but we couldn?t find the money. He has been chosen for the Asian Games in Malaysia next year. Again, I don?t know if he will be able to go?,? Raezur?s father trails off, as if realising fate is not for him to fight.

 ?He plays everything. Football he is great at, but he also plays volleyball and swims, throws the javelin and discuss, does the shot put and more. He even picked up chess and went to Bangladesh recently for a competition,? Momen announces, pride tinged with regret.

 The impairment ? from birth ? has never made the children seem lacking for family and friends. But there have been times when it has thrown obstacles in their way. 

 Although Raezur passed Madhyamik, Sanam and Sabana never made it, because they didn?t have adequate help in the regular schools they were shifted to. And Sabana?s in-laws have still not adjusted to her hearing impairment.

 The sporting spotlight is now on Sanam, who has been selected by the All India Sports Council of the Deaf among nine from Bengal for the 20th Deaflympics in Melbourne, Australia, from January 4 to 18. Of the initial Rs 40,000, only Rs 27,000 could be deposited. The total amount of Rs 75,000 seems a far cry for the family.

 ?I have been to Tata, Bata, Exide, ITC, Britannia, Priya Biscuits and sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, asking for support. No one has helped so far,? sighs Abdul.

 Sanam spends at least six hours a day practising javelin, discus, shot put and even relay. The 23-year-old is also a swimming champ, something that her coach urged her to take up to build strength in her arms.

 Sabana was married four years ago, and is now the mother of a two-year-old son. Her husband does embroidery, and she is happy to have a ?normal? husband and child. 

 She took part in swimming competitions even up to this year, but her in-laws are not too keen on her continuing with sports.

 Rakibur, who now works in his uncle?s tailoring shop, organises umpteen fundraisers in his para, as well as blood and eye-donation camps, with sports competitions as the backdrop. 

 So, the community has now come forward to help his sister in her endeavour, starting with a rally on Sunday.

 Sanam, usually a confident young woman, has seen her game suffer due to the anxiety. A chance to prove herself is all she wants.

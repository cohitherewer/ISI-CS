 Youth, dreams, hopes amp; longings

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 They wish for a greener environment or an equal social foothold for girls; end of wars or simply an identity as individuals who matter. 

 This and many other dreams, hopes and longings, were brought forth by over 115 youngsters from 19 districts of West Bengal. Such wishes and many others, likely to pour in from across the country, will be routed to Delhi for policy-makers to sit up and take notice.

 ?This was the 17th state-level consultation of its kind in the country, as part of a National Youth Alliance initiative,? explained Laboni Jana of Child in Need Institute (CINI), organisers of the programme. 

 ?Adults have always decided for the youth. Such consultations, being held in every state, are attempts to plug the gap between policy-makers and the youth.?

 Jana elaborated: ?The consultations in all the other states will be over in another month and a common national charter will be drawn up for the ministries.? 

 This CINI-National Youth Alliance initiative is aimed at bringing together young people from various walks of urban and rural life. It tries to reflect their concerns to ensure their participation in adoption of appropriate strategies, Jana added.

 The result was a day of meaningful fun and creativity through workshops on poetry, music, dance, theatre and painting for the participants from all over the state, chosen through various partners and friends of CINI at the grassroots. 

 College-goer Sonali Ghosh, peer educator from CINI?s Pailan centre, does her bit by going back to her village and talking to youngsters about issues on women and equality. Given a choice, she would have ?lots of green? trees, rivers and seas? clean and fresh?, just like her collage at the end of the workshop.

 Sulabh Ranjan had pictures of guns on one hand and loving couples on the other, with Aishwarya Rai in the middle. Ranjan explained: ?I know boys my age in my neighbourhood who have been lured by political goondas and trapped in a world of crime. But this violence ? any kind of war ? is wrong.? And according to the blushing boy, the beautiful Miss World should be reason enough for people to practise world peace.

 Bankura Christian College student Soma Dey, part of the music workshop, feels strongly for students who cannot afford higher education. ?What about a meritorious son of a rickshaw-puller? Shouldn?t college education be made free for him?? she asks.

 A peek into some other young minds revealed a range of extreme emotions. 

 Reshma, inmate of Sanlaap?s Bagha Jatin shelter, feels angry if there is no food on the table when she is hungry, Samapti Goswami feels happiness at being able to do what she wants and others feel hurt if not taken seriously.

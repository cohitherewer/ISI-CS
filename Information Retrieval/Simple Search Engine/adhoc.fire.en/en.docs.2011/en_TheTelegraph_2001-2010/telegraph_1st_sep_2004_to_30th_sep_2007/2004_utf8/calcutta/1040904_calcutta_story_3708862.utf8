The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clinic queue for men out of uniform

 SANJAY MANDAL 

What 

makes an ex-army officer a cut above the rest in private hospitals 

Disciplined lifestyle

 Vast experience

 Knowledge of administration

 Capability of handling militant

staff members

 Perfect role model

 Can instil loyalty among the staff 

Brigadier S.B. Purkayastha, Commander S.C. Iyer, Major Amit De the list is growing.

 Plagued by lack of loyalty among staff members and not-too-infrequent vandalism by aggrieved relatives of patients, private hospitals in the city are increasingly turning to ex-armymen to head their administration.

 The former officers have a common brief: instil discipline in the institutes and beef up security. 

 There is hardly any loyalty among the staff. And the problem is compounded by the unions, complained a senior functionary of a private hospital. In some cases, we even find that senior officials are not practising what they preach. Clearly, the employees are not motivated enough, a major lacuna in the healthcare service, he added.

 Enter, former officers in uniform. Thanks to their experience of working in command hospitals, they are perceived to be adept at maintaining discipline (read reining in hostile unions and violent relatives of patients) and motivating the staff. 

 These ex-armymen possess the skill of instilling discipline not just in the hospital corridors, but among the union and staff, too. While serving the force, most of them had run 200-plus-bed hospitals. No wonder, we are looking up to these retired officers to help us run the show better in our backyards, said Sajal Dutta, president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India.

 Dutta, also managing director of Ruby General Hospital, is all praise for Brig. Suranjan Mukherjee, medical superintendent of the hospital. Things have improved significantly since he joined our hospital, Dutta asserted. 

 Brig. Purkayastha, president of Advanced Medical and Research Institute (AMRI), had worked at naval hospital Ashwini, in Mumbai, for 24 years. 

 Drawing a distinction between command hospitals and civilian clinics, he said: In the forces, one deals with disciplined people. Once an order is issued, its taken for granted that itll be executed. But outside, the accountability is not so rigorous. Repeated checks are required to get things done. 

 Brig. Purkayastha should know, for he had been at the helm of three hospitals in the city before joining the AMRI. 

 He, however, is not blind to the positive aspect of civilian life. The forces are a stickler for hierarchy. But here, we do get an opportunity to mix freely with all employees. This helps develop a personal rapport, Purkayastha explains. 

 At AMRI, sources said, the situation has changed for the better over the past eight months. We now have 100 per cent occupancy, best in the past eight years, said an official. 

 Commander S.C. Iyer, chief executive officer of Calcutta Medical and Research Institute, said the job was quite exciting for him. I needed just six months to settle down, and things are under control now, he added.

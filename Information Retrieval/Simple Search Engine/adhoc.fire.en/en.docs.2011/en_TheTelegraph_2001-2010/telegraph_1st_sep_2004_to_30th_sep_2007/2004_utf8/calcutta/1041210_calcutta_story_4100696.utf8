The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 State in overdrive for Saltlec spruce-up

 - IT firms? plea answered, civic facilities to be revamped

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Realising the role of infrastructure in the growth of the information technology (IT) industry, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is drawing up an extensive plan to overhaul facilities in the state?s IT hub, Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec). 

 ?We have decided to prepare a comprehensive plan for the development of Sector V and requested the finance department to release Rs 6 crore initially as a special grant for this purpose,? state urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya informed Metro. 

 The IT companies in Saltlec have long been complaining about the lack of basic civic facilities in the tech town and have taken up the matter with Webel, the government?s nodal IT agency, and the IT department. 

 To address the concerns, minister Bhattacharya convened a meeting recently, which was also attended by IT minister Manab Mukherjee and a string of officials of the state finance and urban development departments and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). He gave the go-ahead to the Saltlec spruce-up plan. 

 ?Details of the comprehensive plan will be worked out and implemented in phases,? said IT minister Mukherjee. According to him, partial repairing of roads has already been taken up. 

 Azim Premji of Wipro, whose visit had triggered road repairs in Saltlec, recently criticised the Karnataka government for poor infrastructure. 

 The issue was also discussed extensively at Infocom 2004, where speakers urged the state to plan in advance to avoid future bottlenecks. 

 The detailed plan will address the gamut of civic issues, ranging from relaying of the ravaged roads to installing streetlights and setting the sewerage and water supply system right to kicking off a beautification programme in the IT zone.

 Besides, there will be provisions for food kiosks and public telephone booths. 

 According to sources, urban development minister Bhattacharya has asked the CMDA to prepare a detailed plan after consulting his department and IT companies in Sector V. 

 To begin with, the CMDA will conduct a detailed survey of the existing infrastructure in Sector V and then draw up the action points. 

 The urban development department was earlier responsible for the maintenance of infrastructure in Sector V. While inaugurating the flyover on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass at the Chingrihata crossing, the minister had announced that the CMDA would also take over the road repairing work in Sector V. 

 At present, both the urban development department and the CMDA are engaged in repairing roads in Sector V. The agencies were involved in widening the roads near the Wipro campus, too. 

 The approach roads to the 11.6 km stretch, connecting the state?s IT hub with the airport, and the roads leading to the flyover at Chingrihata were also repaired by the two agencies.

 ?It is good that the government has realised the importance of infrastructure. But one must point out that the focus till now has been on patchwork here and there. If the government is planning long-term, it must think in terms of relaying of the road surface,? said an IT professional.

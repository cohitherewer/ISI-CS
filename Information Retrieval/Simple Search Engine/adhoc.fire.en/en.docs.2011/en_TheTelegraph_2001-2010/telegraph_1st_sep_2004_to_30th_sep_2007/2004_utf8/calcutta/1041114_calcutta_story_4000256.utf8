 Bon appetease

 Victor Banerjee

Happy Id. But, can you trust a 

 Muslim anymore? One who didn?t observe Roza nor wears a 

 beard? Some of my best friends are Muslims, but after I 

 wrote the biryani piece last week, I have lifted the patch 

 over my Nelson?s eye and decided to look our minorities 

 in the eye and say, ?So what if I pinched your recipe for 

 my column? You can?t lay a lady?s finger on a journalist; 

 we are a pampered minority with pumpkin-magic jack-?-lanterns 

 and more misguided masala powers than you can ever hope 

 to have!?

 You know something? I didn?t hear 

 a whisper from my Assamese friends Nipu or Opu or Rita when 

 I planted a Brahmapautra Rahu in Manmohan Singh?s hand and 

 passed off their delicious recipe for Tenga as my own. Remember 

 it? 

 The charming Muslim lady who had 

 given me the biryani recipe years ago and whom I had presumed 

 illiterate (or certainly not into reading The Good Life 

 section of this paper) now, with her Persian tirade, far 

 removed from inebriated romancing under the palms with Omar 

 Khayyam, burned my new Reliance line to a cinder proclaiming 

 injustice, plagiarism, intellectual property, lawsuits and 

 even murder. 

 Fortunately, midst the fracas 

 she was generating, her mother-in-law, lying in traction, 

 lifted her head to proclaim the recipe was originally that 

 of a Hyderabadi woman who had been married off to a crotchety 

 Arab who died as soon as they landed in Saudi Arabia and 

 left her with a roadside restaurant and a book of recipes. 

 Convoluted, yes, but at least 

 it got me off the roster for imminent beheadings. I?ve given 

 you the background because the Bangladeshi drink?s recipe 

 that I promised you this week, that goes wonderfully with 

 last week?s biryani, comes from another set of Muslim friends 

 in Bangladesh: in fact, their ex-Foreign Secretary?s wife. 

 Therefore, rather than have my 

 body float mysteriously down the Padma with Ilishes (I carp 

 not) pecking at my pits and parts, I hope Tanweer?s wife 

 understands that I am herewith acknowledging her as the 

 source of my recipe, although it wouldn?t surprise me in 

 the least if some starving fisherman from Cox?s Bazaar ascribed 

 it to an Afghan warlord?s sixth wife who had divulged it 

 in an opium field to an inquisitive enquirer from the National 

 Geographic! 

 Either way, my honest credentials 

 are now established across our porous border, into khanti 

 sonar Bangla. 

 Borhani (For 20-25 persons)

 Ingredients: 2 kg dahi 

 (tawk doi to locals), pudina juice (from 250 

 grams of mint leaves), 4 teaspoons ground white pepper, 

 tomato ketchup 1? cups, jeera powder 4 teaspoons, 

 black salt (bitnoon), 4 teaspoons sugar, salt (you 

 can taste the mix when it is whisked and add the salt and 

 sugar to your taste), 3 litres water

 Method: Whisk the dahi 

 till smooth, adding all the ingredients and as much ice 

 as permitted by Bengalis who suffer eternally from laryngitis 

 in the winter though the biryani will be bad for their omnipresent 

 presshar problems and sadly have no effect on their 

 fluctuating shoogaar. Serve. 

 As I was finishing this piece, 

 guess who called me. The beardless biryani lady. Now she 

 whispered huskily and weakened my knees with all the tehzeeb 

 she could muster from her Lucknowi bloodlines and reminded 

 me of the succulent Shammi Kebabs that we shared in a parked 

 car years ago. True. I have a certificate on my wall in 

 memory of the moments we shared. 

 So, next week I shall be back 

 to giving you a Persian or perhaps a Haitian recipe and 

 I shall only give you the details of her Shammi Kebab if 

 she feeds them to me again and acknowledges that her sick 

 mother-in-law, thank heavens, isn?t senile.

 Bon Appetease!

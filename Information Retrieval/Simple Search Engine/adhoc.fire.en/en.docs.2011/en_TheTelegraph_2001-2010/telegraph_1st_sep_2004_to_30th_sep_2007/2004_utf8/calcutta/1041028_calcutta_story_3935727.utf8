Lives less ordinary

They?re ordinary people with ordinary jobs, who have 

extraordinary things happening to them. How do they handle the situation? That?s 

what Hollywood is getting at with the recent spate of new releases. Just take 

a cursory look at the Hollywood films playing on the big screen in town and you 

know what we are getting at.

 Jamie Foxx is a regular New York cabbie who happens to have an assassin on a nightlong killing spree as a passenger in Collateral. The employees of JFK airport in New York are faced with a man who isn?t allowed to leave the building, and so makes a life within its walls in The Terminal. And In Ladder 49, fire fighters are the stars of the show.

 Reel life imitating real life is neither a new nor a novel concept. But post-September 11, there is a trend to toast the courage of plain Janes and John Does. Tom Cruise might be the main man in Collateral, but it?s taxi driver Foxx who?s the hero. One only has to talk to a New York City cab driver for a taste of the madness that is a part of daily life, often more dramatic than a film script.

 The Terminal, starring Tom Hanks, is about a man stranded at the airport. But the people he interacts with are the airport staff, from security manager Stanley Tucci to airhostess Catherine Zeta Jones. It?s about the daily life in a bustling international airport and the people who populate it. Passengers troop in and out, and behind each individual is a story?

 King Arthur might be more about legends while The Exorcist: The Beginning is a pure horror flick, but Ladder 49 is all about those who look death in the face everyday, to save lives. Both John Travolta and Joaquin Phoenix admit to the 9/11 tragedy and efforts of the fire fighters in the aftermath playing a part in their wanting to do the film.

 For Travolta, doing Ladder 49 was like a dream come true. ?It did shine a light of respect and gave us all a different view of that amazing group of people. I saw this film as my opportunity to pay homage to these guys. I was only interested in the right script that I felt was fair to them and portrayed them in a realistic way,? the actor says.

 And this is all the more magnificent for actors who played larger-than-life heroes and anti-heroes in grand period pieces. While Travolta has graced films like Battlefield Earth, Phoenix has played the conniving emperor in Gladiator.

 So what is it about ordinary people that fascinates film-makers enough to make blockbusters of them? The Bridget Jones Diary success might provide a clue. In fact, the sequel, of the not-so-perfect life with Darcy, is ready for release next month. 

 Also coming in November is the tale of The Interpreter (Nicole Kidman), a translator at the United Nations, who just happens to overhear a conversation to topple a government. 

 What would you do in such a situation??

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cell-lifter gang netted 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Days after the police directorgeneral?s assurance to residents of Salt Lake, cops from Bidhannagar (South) swung into action on Wednesday, arresting the members of a mobile phone-lifting gang. 

 The three-member gang from Metiabruz had been on the prowl for some time, operating in crowded places.

 With complaints pouring in from all directions, Salt Lake police had been desperately on the lookout for the gang members till Wednesday night, when they rounded up Mohammad Ali from the Nicco Park area.

 After interrogating him, police raided a few hideouts and detained two more people ? Md Yasin and Gopal Shaw. Sixteen mobile sets have been recovered from the trio. 

 The tip-off about Ali came from the security guards manning Nicco Park. Late in the evening, one of the visitors spotted the 30-year-old moving around ?suspiciously? near the park and alerted the security personnel. The guards, in turn, called up the Bidhannagar (South) police station and sought their intervention. 

 ?We put together a team of policemen in plain clothes and sent them to the spot. The team members followed Ali for some time, before arresting him,? said a senior officer of the police station.

 Police found a mobile phone in his pocket and went through the dialled numbers to track his associates. 

 Ali, who initially refused to speak to the cops, spilled the beans after intense interrogation. His associates were arrested soon after from their hideouts in Metiabruz. 

 Interrogation revealed that Gopal used to sell the stolen mobile sets in the burgeoning second-hand market in the city and even beyond the state borders. Police are not sure whether the gang members used to change the number of the stolen sets using a particular software. 

 Investigators are also trying to establish whether the gang was part of the racket that was earlier busted by the detective department of Calcutta Police in Metiabruz. While the officers are tight-lipped, insiders claimed that most of sets stolen by the gang were sold off in Jharkhand. 

 In a separate incident, police from Bidhannagar (East) arrested a person named Raju Kobiraj on Wednesday afternoon in connection with the recent incidents of gold chain-lifting in CL Block. 

 Police said Kobiraj, who was rounded up from Kestopur, is the leader of a gang of four youths.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tangra hooch toll rises to 24

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The toll in hooch consumption in the Tangra area since Tuesday has reportedly risen to 24 on Friday, even though Calcutta Police tried through the day to downplay the incident by pegging the number at six.

 ?Checking medical certificates issued by various hospitals, we have come to know that six persons have died after consuming spurious liquor. Several persons are still ailing, at home and in hospital, but we do not have any numbers yet,? said Sudipta Nag, an officer of Tangra police station. 

 ?Seven persons have been arrested, including one woman, on charges of selling illicit liquor. We have sent samples of seized liquor for forensic tests,? he added. 

 A pall of gloom descended on the area, spanning Tangra Road, Pulin Khatik Road, DC Dey Road, Gobinda Khatik Road and Suormari Basti, with local residents mourning for the dead.

 Excise department officials have been conducting extensive raids.

 Local CPM councillor Lakshmi Mani Banerjee and others submitted a memorandum to the commissioner of police on Friday. ?We have demanded the immediate arrest of all persons selling illicit liquor in the area and a crackdown on all outlets,? Banerjee said. ?We have started a door-to-door campaign in the area, making the residents aware of the hazards of drinking country liquor.?

 Since Monday night, several residents had complained of headaches, a burning sensation in the eyes, vomiting and abdominal pain. Within 48 hours of the symptoms surfacing, the first death struck. 

 Facing the hostility of the local residents, police officer Nag tried to shrug off responsibility. 

 ?Illicit liquor is produced in the Tiljala police station area, under the jurisdiction of the state police. On several occasions, we had asked our counterparts to take action. But they have not,? he said. 

 The police superintendent of South 24-Parganas, S.N. Gupta, however, sent the ball back to the local police station?s court. 

 ?We take regular action against sellers of illicit liquor,? he claimed. 

 A senior officer at the city police headquarters in Lalbazar said sleuths working on the case were facing a dilemma as the authorities had not confirmed that the deaths were caused by spurious liquor.

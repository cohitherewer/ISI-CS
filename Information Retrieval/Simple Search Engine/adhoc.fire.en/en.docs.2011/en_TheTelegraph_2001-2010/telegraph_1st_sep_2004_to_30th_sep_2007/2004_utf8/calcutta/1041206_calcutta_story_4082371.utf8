The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clubs pay for Puja excess 

 - Up to Rs 15,000 pollution fine for noise norm violation

 JAYANTA BASU

 More than 50 big and small clubs in the city and beyond ? including Mohammad Ali Park in central Calcutta, Kalindi Durgotsav Committee of Lake Town, Sri Sangha Club of Behala and Bidhannagar Sarbojanin in Salt Lake ? have been hauled up by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board for violating noise norms during Durga puja and Biswakarma puja 2004.

 Most of these clubs used loudspeakers at a volume significantly higher than the permissible limit. The violations occurred because the clubs did not use the ?mandatory? sound limiter.

 ?Based on the findings of our experts, the accused clubs were first called for a hearing at our public grievance cell, and then, depending on the nature of offence and their submission, were fined between Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 as pollution cost,? said sources in the pollution control board. 

 The fines were imposed under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986.

 The clubs are expected to submit the pollution cost to the board within a couple of weeks of receiving the order and have been asked to communicate the same to the local police station.

 ?We may even start court proceedings against some clubs whose offences have been found to be extremely serious by our experts,? said a board official.

 Smarting under criticism for allowing the production of banned crackers for sale outside the state during Kali puja and Diwali, the pollution control board has decided to act tough on the errant clubs ?to set an example?. 

 The number of clubs hauled up this year is more than double the last few years?.

 And it is quite clear that the fines have had the desired effect.

 ?We did not have an idea that the sound limiter is mandatory. We have now learned that the hard way. We will make sure that we comply with all the noise norms next year,? observed P. Saha, a club official of Md. Ali Park. The club was fined Rs 10,000 for violation of noise norms.

 ?It?s not that we don?t respect the law. Most of the time, the youngsters in the club control the microphone and they might have crossed limits. We will make sure that nothing of the sort happens next year. This is not only a matter of a few thousand rupees, but also a matter of pride for the club and the area?, said a senior member of Kalindi Durgotsav Committee.

 However, most of the clubs contacted by Metro, whether they have been fined or not, feel that the pollution control board must generate more awareness about noise norms.

 ?Why don?t the board officials inform us about the norms when we go for the customary meeting with police before the Puja?? asked a club official.

 ?Awareness is the key. I feel that the board should develop a better communication model,? said environmentalist Subhash Dutta.

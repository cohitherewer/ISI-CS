The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 She?s not impressed

 It?s difficult to find someone in tinsel town who isn?t willing to talk about her work. And that?s not because the person hasn?t got enough work to talk about, it?s just that she isn?t happy with the way the industry has treated her.

 Kim Sharma, who made a sparkling debut in Aditya Chopra?s multi-starrer Mohabbatein, has been in mute mode ever since she was given a raw deal in Ken Ghosh?s Fida. Playing Sonia, the girl madly in love with Shahid Kapur, Kim?s role was reportedly chopped ruthlessly at the editing table. ?I don?t even want to talk about that anymore,? the actress tells Metro.

 Even a bag full of films hasn?t really bucked up the actress. ?I am doing work all right. But I should be doing more. I am capable of much more ? I am not doing maximum stuff,? says Kim.

 One of her forthcoming films is ready for release and the promos of Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav have been on air for quite some time. ?In the film, I play this character named Rita, who is very over-the-top and manipulative by nature. But since it?s a comedy, there?s nothing cynical about me. It was great to work with Suniel, who?s been cast opposite me. He is really chilled out and funny. And Mahesh (Manjrekar) is Mahesh.?

 Kim, unlike many other Bollywood actresses, isn?t diplomatic about the fact that the length of the role does matter in a film. ?I think the content has to be good. It is very important to have a meaty role. My small role in Fida might have created an impact but it hasn?t had any impact on my career.?

 The other roles in her kitty do range from minuscule cameos to leads. ?I play Noor Jehan?s daughter in Akbar Khan?s magnum opus Taj Mahal. Then there?s the thriller Yakeen where I have been cast alongside Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra. I am playing the lead in a couple of other projects which are to be announced shortly.?

 But after such a huge debut, the big banners have eluded Kim. ?You know what, I didn?t get many offers after Mohabbatein. Maybe I wasn?t good enough in the film. I got a lot of critical acclaim for my negative act in Tumse Achcha Kaun Hai. I got a few offers then. But right now, I am mostly doing relatively small films with a good set up.?

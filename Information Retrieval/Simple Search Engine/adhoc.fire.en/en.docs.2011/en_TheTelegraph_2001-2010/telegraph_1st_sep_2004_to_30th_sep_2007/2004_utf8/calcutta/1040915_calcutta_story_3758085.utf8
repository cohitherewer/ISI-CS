 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday rapped the police for failing to produce a case diary relating to an alleged dowry death in Belghoria. The superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) was ordered to appear in court on September 22 and present the papers. 

 The division bench granted bail to the husband, brother-in-law and sister-in-law of the victim. The three were lodged in jail for the past 84 days.

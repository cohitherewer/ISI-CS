The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Myriad mix in mid-air

A world of boredom and bustle, enterprise and ennui greets 

the observer on an aircraft

The 

?fasten seatbelt? sign has just been switched off. A pleasant voice announces 

that breakfast will be served shortly. Jet Airways flight 9W 902 to Delhi takes 

off at 8.55 am sharp from Dum Dum. Taking off over Salt Lake, the Boeing 737 aircraft 

tilts ever so slightly to its right. As it gains height, it is also seeking its 

destination. By the time the plane is flying over Bandel, its nose is heading 

towards Delhi.

The front section of the plane is earmarked for the 

privileged passengers. There are five rows of four seats each, separated right 

in the middle by an aisle. On either side, there is an aisle seat and a window 

seat. Cr?me de la cr?me usually sits on the first row ? it is easier for them 

to get in and get out of the aircraft. Today, those seats have been taken by four 

influential members of parliament. Each of them sits in a standing committee of 

the parliament that is of interest to the world of industry and commerce.

Immediately behind them sits a couple from Alipore 

whose net worth figure has more than seven zeroes. Managing director of a Rs 100-crore 

engineering company sits with his deputy on the other side.

The third row is taken up by a Bollywood film entourage. 

The leading lady sits by a window with her personal assistant next to her. On 

the other side are the director and the producer of the film.

You could call the fourth a legal row. Two very eminent 

barristers sit at the two window seats. The aisle seats are vacant. The fifth 

is taken up by lesser mortals, but even they own a car of at least a Honda Accord 

level.

Till then most of the passengers are reading the morning 

paper. Breakfast punctuates their reading. They all eat heartily. Trays are removed. 

This prized audience is then offered reading material. A tray full of magazines 

is taken around. Very few get picked. The in-flight magazine of Jet Airways curiously 

stays inside the seat pocket from the start. It does not deserve the privilege 

of being displayed on the tray.

The passengers by the window are looking out. Those 

on the aisle seat observe the cabin crew doing the dishes. Both groups eventually 

get bored and at about 10 o?clock go into slumber. On other days, at this time, 

they all would be at their active best. Boredom engulfs them. They have nothing 

to do, no one to talk to, no television to watch, no music to listen to.

On the very first row of the economy class sit two 

extremely bright looking advertising professionals. They also eat their breakfast 

and read the business paper with religious zeal. Having finished their food and 

knowledge consumption, they start discussing an assignment that they have to jump 

straight into after they reach Delhi. They have to present a media plan to a client 

that afternoon. The client would be launching a very premium car; the category 

is defined by imported cars of the S-class Mercedes Benz category. 

The client is keen that a medium is found or, if the 

need be, created afresh, with high reach and low wastage amongst an august target 

group. The kind that is seated on the other side of the aircraft.

The two advertising professionals could not see the 

other side. A curtain separated the two parts. The curtain was dark and heavy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 As you groove, they mint

 - Local DJs nudge out costly imports on last night of 2004

 They make your parties rock. They make your bodies sway. They even do the New Year countdown for you. And this is the one time of the year when they can make music and go singing all the way to the bank.

 Literally. By making people dance all night ? through the last night of 2004 ? disc jockeys (DJs) can make a mini fortune (see graphic). And with the stakes rising by the winter hour, the war of the DJs is hotter than ever before.

 First, the territorial tussle over the cash console. Local DJs have emerged as the most wanted beat breed this week, nudging out costly Mumbai imports.

 ?The scenario has definitely changed. For the big nights, Calcutta?s DJs are certainly better than their Mumbai or Bangalore counterparts. Not only because they have improved vastly but also since they understand the pulse of the people here,? says DJ Harish of Dublin, gearing up to play everything from Dhoom macha le to Final countdown.

 Calcutta?s party circuit is finally giving its DJs their due. Ask DJ Carlotta, the city?s first female disc jockey, who has chosen Calcutta over Mumbai this New Year?s Eve. ?I decided to stay back and play at Swabhumi... Earlier, Calcutta didn?t recognise its own talents and got DJs from elsewhere.? 

 With a precious few DJs and parties aplenty, they have been much in demand this festive fortnight. Most had to turn down multiple offers to churn out retro and remix, house and hip-hop, Bollywood and even Bangla for the last night of 2004.

 ?I had more than 10 offers for New Year?s Eve. All of them wanted me to play 10 pm onwards. So, I could take up only one,? says freelance DJ Akash, who plans to ring in ?05 with a mix of Salaame.

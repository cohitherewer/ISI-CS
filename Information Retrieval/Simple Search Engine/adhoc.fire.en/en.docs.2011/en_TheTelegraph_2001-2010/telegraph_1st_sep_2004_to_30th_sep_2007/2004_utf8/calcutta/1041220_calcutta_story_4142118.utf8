The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Total arterial bypass gains popularity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 To eliminate redo bypass surgery, some doctors in Calcutta are advocating total arterial bypass procedures, in which the internal mammary arteries, located behind the breastbone, are used for the bypass.

 ?This procedure, instead of the conventional method of using leg veins, is gaining popularity among city doctors. It minimises the chances of a second operation,? said cardiac surgeon Satyajit Bose.

 So, there is a possibility of about 800 to 900 surgeries being conducted a year, using total coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the next couple of years. 

 Most CABG cases in Calcutta are done using the conventional method (by making incisions in the hands and legs). But mammary arteries reduce the chances of redo surgery by almost 50 per cent, said cardiac surgeon Ajay Kaul.

 Of late, it has been noticed that patients, who have undergone bypass surgery using the conventional method, have to undergo another surgery within 10 years.

 ?There is no doubt that using mammary arteries is better and is definitely the advanced method, more so because the arteries located behind the breastbone are disease-free,? said Bose.

 To make people aware of the advances in cardiac surgery, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital organised a two-day cardiology surgery workshop, where UK-based cardiac surgeon Julian Gaer showed doctors in Calcutta the latest techniques in cardiac surgery. 

 ?We even conducted live surgeries and showed doctors the new procedures. We shared a lot of inputs,? said Bose. 

 The advantages of a total arterial grafting with bilateral internal mammary graft:

Ensures good quality of life for a minimum 15 years

No requirement for redo bypass surgery

No extra incisions in hand and leg

Minimises post-operative chest wall discomfort

Near-zero incidence of infection, even in uncontrolled diabetes.

 The biggest problem with bypass surgery patients is their reluctance to modify their subsequent lifestyle. Unless this is done, there are high chances of a redo surgery. 

 Most city hospitals have opened clinics where patients are taught a different lifestyle.

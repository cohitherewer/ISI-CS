 Green sign for festival of lights 

ZEESHAN JAWED

 Veg platter from Blossoms Square

 New cheer for the green brigade this Diwali. Pure vegetarian restaurant Blossoms Square at The Enclave on Alipore Road has done a bit of spring cleaning in its five-month existence to come up with a special Diwali menu and a festive thali.

 The eatery boasts an extensive Continental menu apart from an elaborate Indian platter. A few new Continental dishes also find their way into the new Diwali menu. Cottage Cheese Sizzelian (paneer, asparagus and mushrooms baked with cheese sauce), Veg Paprika (paratha made of three kinds of bell peppers, topped with paprika sauce), Babycorn Florentine (babycorn in a thick spinach and white sauce) are a few dishes worth digging into.

 Veering away from the Continental diversion is the Indian thali for Rs 200 plus taxes. It packs in Jodhpuri Kofta Kebab (corn, paneer, khoya, green chillies and coriander leaves made into kebabs in a curd base), Kashmiri Corn (corn, paneer, bell peppers in a cashew and cream gravy), Alu Dum Banarasi (potatoes cooked in a curd and kasuri methi gravy), Jaipuri Mili Juli Sabzi (a dry preparation), Dal Makhani, a choice between Ghilafi Naan, Khasta Roti, Lachcha Paratha, Masala Kulcha and Garlic Naan and mint chutney topped with a choice of Gulab Jamun or Kesariya Kulfi.

 Biryani makes for a delicious meal at Tamarind.

 Meat matters

 After the Bengali overkill, time for a Hyderabadi feast. Bringing some exclusive dishes from Hyderabad to town is Tamarind at 64, Sarat Bose Road. 

 Pig out on Gosht ke Sev (crispy shredded meat) and Gosht ke Shikampur (grilled lamb patties). Or try out the Gosht ka Haleem, a savoury porridge of ground meat, broken wheat and Hyderabadi masala. Also check out the regular Gosht ki Biryani and Mutton Chop in Hyderabadi style. 

 There are some interesting vegetarian options too. Try Hyderabad?s famous Baghare Baigan (aubergines cooked in tangy gravy), Subz ki Biryani or Subz ka Haleem.

 To end the meal well, order the Khubani ka Meetha, a dessert made with apricot. The festival is on till October 25.

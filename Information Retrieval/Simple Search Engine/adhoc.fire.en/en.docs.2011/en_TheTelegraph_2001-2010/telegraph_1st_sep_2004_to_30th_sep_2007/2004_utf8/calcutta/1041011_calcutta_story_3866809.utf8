The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rainclouds raise fresh flood fears

 OUR BUREAU

 Last Thursday?s battering still fresh in mind and with a number of lanes and bylanes yet submerged, Calcuttans in the northern and central parts panicked as dark rainclouds gathered in the Sunday afternoon sky.

 The shower, smart but brief, was ?normal rain?, Met officials said, characteristic of a retreating monsoon. 

 Officials at regional meteorological centre in Alipore said there had been no rain in their area and around this time of the year, such localised rainfall was common.

 The sky will remain partly cloudy for the next few days, with the possibility of rain in some parts. The monsoon is expected to phase out over the next few days, they added. 

After the torrential rain from Monday to Thursday 

following the depression, several roads in the city are still under water. According 

to Calcutta Municipal Corporation sources, streets in Behala, Tiljala, Topsia, 

Bosepukur, Thakurpukur, Taratala, Barisha and Tollygunge are still waterlogged.

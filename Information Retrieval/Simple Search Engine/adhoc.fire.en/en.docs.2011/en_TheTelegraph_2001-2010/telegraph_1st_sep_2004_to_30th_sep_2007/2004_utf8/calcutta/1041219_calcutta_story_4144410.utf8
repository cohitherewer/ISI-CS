Tooth and gum trouble are the most common medical 

complaints in cats and dogs. Bad breath among pets is so prevalent that pet owners 

believe it is normal. But the reason pets have bad breath is simply because of 

infected teeth and gums.

According to the American Veterinary Dental Society, 

more than 80 per cent of dogs and 70 per cent of cats develop gum disease by the 

age of three. It is most severe in toy/smaller breeds of dogs and in pure-bred 

cats.

The problem begins when plaque and tartar are allowed 

to build up on the pet?s teeth. The bacteria present in plaque and tartar cause 

infection leading to bad breath, bleeding and inflammation of the gums and the 

eventual loss of teeth. In advanced cases, this infection can enter the blood 

stream causing kidney and heart disease.

Dental care

Yearly check-ups: Take your pet to a vet for 

a general check-up every year.

Brushing: Brush your pet?s teeth at least twice 

a week with a toothbrush designed for pets or a soft human toothbrush. Do not 

use human toothpaste.

Diet: Soft or sticky foods should be avoided 

and crunchy foods introduced. A crunchy diet massages the gums and wears off plaque.

Treats: Feeding bones and chewy treats (with 

enzymes) minimise dental plaque. If you give your pet real bones, make sure they?re 

not chicken bones.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of kisses and misses

 His earlier film had 17 kisses and long lectures on condoms. Govind Menon?s Khwahish also introduced a certain Mallika Sherawat to Bollywood. And now the director has dished out his new film Kis Kiski Kismat, released all over on Friday. The film also happens to be Govind?s first script.

 ?It?s a crazy comedy about a father and son involved in a nationwide scandal revolving around the same babe, Mallika. Dharmendra plays this miserly Gujarati stockbroker and a new guy Siddharth plays his son, the laziest man on the planet. As for Mallika, she plays a brainless bimbo who doesn?t even have an idea how sexy she really is. The film is a strange mix of dysfunctional people and family. It?s about money, gossip, media?,? Govind told Metro.

 Like Khwahish, here too, Govind has played it dangerously. ?Everyone in Bollywood makes a stereotype. I don?t believe in giving the audience what they want. I want to give them what I like to see. So why make a Shah Rukh Khan romantic film or a Govinda comedy or a Sunny Deol action flick or even a sleazy Mallika film? In my film, Mallika plays a comedian. Yes, she is sexy. I can?t make a goat look like a cow. She looks sexy even in a burkha.?

 For Govind, Mallika?s character is a mix of Marilyn Monroe and Charlie Chaplin. ?Marilyn did a lot of comedy. Mallika?s character is a combination of Marilyn?s dumb blonde image and the hungry economically deprived image of Charlie Chaplin. I have even shot some portions of the film in 18 frames per second, that typical Chaplinesque speed.?

 The Dharmendra casting though was bizarre, admitted Govind. ?Mallika and Dharmendra together doesn?t make any sense. What I thought was that I needed a dad for my film and I didn?t want him to be nasty or sleazy or repulsive. So I used Dharamji?s image which is randy yet cute. And he is of course such a legend ? there?s nobody better looking than him at his age.?

 The inspiration for Kis Kiski Kismat comes from French cartoonist Gilmore. ?He used to make fun of everyone from the Nazis to the Jews to Jesus Christ. He even made fun of Princess Diana?s death and also Mother Teresa. Here in India, if we make fun of Gandhi somebody will come and break my window the next day. You say something about Muslims or Christians or even Bengalis, everyone gets pissed off. We just can?t laugh at ourselves. My film in some way is a statement against this.?

 Govind has almost completed his next film, Bachke Rehna Re Baba, a Bolly take on Heartbreakers. ?It?s an out-and-out chick flick where Mallika and Rekha play mausi-bhanji who con rich old men.?

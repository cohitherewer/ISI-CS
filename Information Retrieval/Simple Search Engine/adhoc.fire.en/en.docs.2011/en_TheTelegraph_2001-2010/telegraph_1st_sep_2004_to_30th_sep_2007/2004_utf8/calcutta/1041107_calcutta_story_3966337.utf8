 Little India, the Elgin Road multi-label boutique, celebrated its first anniversary on October 30. And to make the wide client base a part of the birthday revelry, an anniversary discount is being offered on all labels that the store houses ? right from Rohit Bal and Suneet Verma to city boy Shayon Mitra. 

 ?We have had a great year in Calcutta and we wanted to give something back to the city,? reasoned director Krishna Raja, who has also added to the existing collection of most of the designer brands to help shoppers get the best deal during the ongoing festive season. 

 Among the new additions, men?s shirts by Raghavendra Rathore and Rohit Bal are worth checking out. Both the lines comprise a lot of cottons ? while white dominates Bal?s collection, pastel hues and stripes highlight Rathore?s range. 

 Suneet Verma?s funky party wear line is another high point here. Black cotton trousers with colourful borders, sling dresses and a range of reasonable tops make Verma?s collection a pleasure to possess. 

 Anita Dongre and Mumbai brand Zooni?s outfits are also on offer. Zooni?s Parsi stitch-embellished kurtis are just right for the body types that look good in loose outfits. 

 Krishna herself has come up with a collection of delicately-embroidered kurtas. Her range of shirts for the metrosexual man also deserves mention. 

 However, it?s the silk salwar kurtas coupled with embroidered pashmina shawls by Shayon that tops it all. In smart jacket cuts as well as conventional straight cuts, the uni-coloured outfits in bright red, royal blue, cream and black are the show stealers.

 On-line lottery crosses thin line 

The lure of a fast buck

 - Complaints draw cop frown, CPM youth wing wants business wound up 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?Humein bachaiye, hamara beta sab kuch lottery mein daal raha hai. Aur kuch din baad, hamare paas khane ke liye kuch nahin rahega (Save us, our son is pouring all our money into the lottery. Soon, we will not even have anything left to eat).?

 A mother?s cry, echoing the frustration and the fear of several families criss-crossing Calcutta.

 Responding to this and armed with a go-ahead from the government, police have decided to initiate a drive against on-line lotteries, the latest lure to earn a quick buck.

 ?We had never received such complaints before, but allegations have started pouring in for the past two weeks. We are working on this and if any trouble breaks out because of this (lottery) game, we will take action,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police, detective department.

 Sleuths had swung into action last week after at least 30 complaints were received from worried family members. Twelve on-line lottery centres in the Shyampukur, Burtola and Karaya areas were raided and eight offenders rounded up.

 Labelling the lottery business a social evil, a five-member delegation of Democratic Youth Federation Of India (DYFI), youth wing of the ruling CPM, met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers? Buildings on Monday and urged him to initiate measures to curb the craze.

 Asitanga Ganguly, state secretary of DYFI, later said the chief minister had told them that the government had already initiated measures against such lotteries and was planning to take further action in the near future.

 ?Ours is a legal game and since the West Bengal government runs its own lottery (paper), on what basis can it restrict any other lottery?? asked Sanjoy Das, CEO, Pan India Network Infravest, which runs Playwin. ?The world over, lotteries are a rage and it is all on-line,? he added.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, however, stressed the ill-effect of the business on society and said the state government had imposed an embargo about a year and a half ago. ?The matter is pending before the high court. Besides, we have told police to keep a close eye on it,? said the finance minister.

 Citing an example, an official of the detective department said: ?A woman from Shyambazar complained that her husband, the sole breadwinner in the five-member family, had been pouring Rs 10,000 every month into on-line lottery. He was taking hefty loans from local money -lenders to stay afloat.?

 Renuka Shaw of Jorasanko, too, went to the local police station and urged officers to do something to stop her husband, who was spending Rs 5,000 every month on lottery. ?He is employed with a private firm and we are a four-member family. For two months, he has not paid our son?s tuition fees to feed his addiction. Please do something,? she urged police.

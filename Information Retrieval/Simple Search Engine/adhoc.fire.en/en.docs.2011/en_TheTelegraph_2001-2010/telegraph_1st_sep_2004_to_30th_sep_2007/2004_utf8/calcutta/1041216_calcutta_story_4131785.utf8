Grilled grandeur

Smita Roy Chowdhury stirs up a menu 

for a barbecue bash

Though the nip is still missing from the December air, the festive spirit integral to a Calcutta winter has caught on like wildfire. There?s something happening every other day at a hotel or nightclub. But if the crowds at these places put you off, give these hangouts a miss in favour of a private affair with your kind of company. And since all things warm and cosy are what one craves this season, you can opt for a barbecue party instead of the usual cocktail do. It is quite simple to organise ? all you need is a suitable venue, a couple of ovens or charcoal grills and a small selection of your closest friends. The best thing is that you can make your guests sing for their supper, trying their hand at grilling their own food.

 Hot haunt

Choosing a venue is of prime importance, since you 

can?t possibly host such a do in a drawing room. If you are lucky enough to have 

a swimming pool, don?t think twice. If not, head for the rooftop or the lawns. 

Scatter plenty of chairs all over the place, set a few tables to keep the ovens 

and the victuals. You can also light a bonfire if space permits.

 Food focus

 Needless to say, the menu is the focus. You can grill just about any meat you can lay your hands on. While chicken ?- legs and boneless pieces ? are easy options, you can try making some lamb or pork chops. Grilled fish like pomfret or bekti is also an easy bet. To save time and optimise flavour, marinate the meat a day in advance. 

 ?Traditionally, barbecue is associated with non-vegetarian food, but if you are organising such a party at home, you have to keep options for veggies too,? feels Surinder Singh, executive chef, Taj Bengal. And the choices, he says, are plenty. Grilled jacket potatoes, asparagus, bell pepper, cottage cheese and button mushrooms are a few that he recommends. These can be served with sour cream or melted butter.

?While planning the menu, especially if you have lots 

of non-veg stuff, you must take care to include fresh salad, which is otherwise 

left out in a barbecue dinner,? adds Singh. Apart from the usual, Singh recommends 

salads like apple and sour curd, potato with pomery grain and mustard, bell pepper 

with mushrooms and lettuce with mayonnaise.

 Liquid facts

Beer, beer and more beer should be the case when it 

comes to beverages. ?Beer is always my favourite when it comes to a barbecue party. 

But these days Calcuttans are drinking a lot of wine too. So, you can serve two 

to three varieties of wine,? feels Singh. And here, blindly follow the thumb rule 

of pairing red wine with red meat and white wine with white. You can serve white 

wine with the veggie fare. And don?t forget to spare a thought for the non-drinkers 

and arrange some mocktails or soft drinks.

 Dress code

Since you would be basically lounging around, the 

comfort factor should be counted in. And the season requires you to be covered 

up. Make the best of your winter wardrobe. Focus on jackets, turtleneck sweaters 

and party stoles. Team these with trousers or stylish skirts that are quite a 

rage this season. This would also be an apt opportunity to flaunt your best scarves, 

mufflers and caps.

 Music mantra

 Lounge music would win hands down for warming up and this can be followed by anything of your choice ? retro, rock, jazz or disco. ?Since barbecue parties are held outdoors, you need to warm up the crowd with some lounge music. I would always move on to retro or rock later,? says DJ Girish of Shisha.

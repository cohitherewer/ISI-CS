 Court quest for water law

 - Impure supply in twin cities earns division bench frown

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Bad water is a bane for the twin cities and the administration must get its act together to flush out the faults.

 Taking this stern waterline, the high court said on Thursday it would soon prod the state government to enact a piece of legislation to ensure generation, transmission, distribution and storage of safe drinking water in Calcutta and Howrah.

 A division bench of Justice Barin Ghosh and Justice A.K. Basu said it would ask advocate-general Balai Ray to advise the government to enact the law.

 The bench also directed state planning board member-secretary Swapan Sengupta to carry out a comprehensive study of the drinking water supply in the twin cities.

 ?We would appreciate the state planning board drawing up a plan for supply of pure drinking water from the point of distribution to the point of consumption,? the bench said.

 ?We would also appreciate the state planning board putting in place a plan on the technical aspect of carrying such water and also suggesting implementation thereof, if necessary, in phases,? the division bench added.

 Planning board member-secretary Sengupta, made a respondent in the case on Thursday, was asked to submit a report within six months.

 The order followed a petition by Subhas Dutta in 2002.

 Before moving court, the petitioner had collected water samples from various pockets of Calcutta and Howrah and had them checked by reputed testing centres.

 Dutta had, thus, been able to substantiate his charges that drinking water supplied by the civic bodies to certain pockets of Calcutta and Howrah was unfit for consumption.

 The reports from the testing centres had prompted the then green bench of the high court to seek clarifications from the civic authorities. 

 In their reports, the civic bodies had claimed that there were no flaws in the system of collecting, purifying and distributing water. 

 ?But the reservoirs in which the water is stored are not cleaned properly,? the authorities submitted.

 The court on Thursday asked Dutta to suggest a feasible method for cleaning and disinfecting reservoirs.

 The division bench further observed that a comprehensive study on the subject was essential to ensure generation and distribution of quality water and also to sensitise the people to the need for storing the water in clean tanks.

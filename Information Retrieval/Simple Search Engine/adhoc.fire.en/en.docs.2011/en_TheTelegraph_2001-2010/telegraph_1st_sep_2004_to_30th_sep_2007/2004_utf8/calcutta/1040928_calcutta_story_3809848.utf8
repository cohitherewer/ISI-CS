 Best of 15 to fox a burglar

 - Lalbazar 

must-do list for householders proceeding on puja vacation 

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Don?t let burglars clean out your apartment while you?re on Puja vacation. Follow our guidelines ? that?s the message from the top brass of the city police.

 Lalbazar has drawn up a must-do list for those who will be out of town during this year?s Puja vacation, leaving their homes either empty or in the care of their domestic helps or aged members of their families. The string of suggestions, according to senior officers, will help people prevent their houses from being burgled.

 ?Every year, a number of houses are burgled during the festive season. And every year, we issue a list of suggestions for householders leaving town on vacation. But we find that inevitably, the owners of the houses burgled had not followed our guidelines. So, it is our fervent request that people follow our advice if they want their houses to be safe,? said an official at the Lalbazar police headquarters.

 Elaborating on the ?strategy? that burglars prefer to adopt, Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said: ?Burglary is a crime of opportunism. A burglar will target a house that will offer him the best opportunity to carry out his crime undetected and with the fewest number of obstacles in his way. An unoccupied house is far more likely to be burgled than the one that is manned, especially at night.? 

 Police suggest that those on vacation not let their homes look abandoned. ?Make it look as though your house is occupied. Instal a light outside the main door and ask your neighbour to keep it on at night. Above all, consider installing an intruder-alarm system,? advised deputy commissioner Mukherjee.

 Police have also prepared a guideline for domestics or aged people who will be home alone during the vacation. ?Not all burglars break into homes. Some try to trick or con their way in. They are known as bogus callers and will pretend to be on official business from utility companies like gas and electricity,? elaborated a Lalbazar officer. 

 ?Bogus callers succeed because they sound plausible and can dupe maids or the aged. Follow our simple steps to safety,? he signed off.

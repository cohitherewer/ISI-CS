 Visions of life

 The fine arts, as a form of individual expression, is generally perceived as a medium fit for articulating personal emotions. It reflects the mind of its creator to offer an insight into his values, beliefs and attitudes. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by Debangshu Das, while not deviating from this norm, effectively illustrates how the canvas can be used to celebrate an impression of life that is idealistic, at the same time being aware of the uncertainties and perils that are very much a part of modern life. Paintings depicting women performing homely activities and adorned with an enchanting beauty, grace and innocence, bespeak Das? fondness for a traditional way of life. Reminiscent of Rajasthani miniature paintings, his figures are characterised by a delicate fragility which imparts upon them a charming, ethereal quality, while bearing out his rare finesse in using the brush. While soft, mellow tones are used in paintings on rural themes, an alternation of gloomy haziness and bold shades mark his paintings of urban life, revealing his fear of isolation, melancholy and moral decadence.

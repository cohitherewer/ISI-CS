 What We are Watching

BOLLYWOOD _ John Juggernaut

 Madhoshi: Sensual saga

 Madhoshi (U/A)

 Starring the real-life pair of John and Bipasha, 9/11 forms the backdrop for this film. Bipasha plays a schizophrenic patient and Priyanshu her fianc?. Enter John and things go haywire. 

Catch it at INOX (Forum): 3.15 pm, 10.45 pm; 

INOX (City Centre): 12 noon, 5 pm; 89 Cinemas: 2.05 pm, 9.45 pm

Flop factor: The Jism jodi has 

failed again after Aetbaar with first week collections well below 45 per 

cent with little signs of picking up.

Dhoom: Speed demon 

 Dhoom (U/A)

 John as Kabir seems to score over everybody in this catch-me-if-you-can drama. With his drop-dead looks, that wry grin and oh-my-God killer body, Johnny baby is the bod of the hour.

 Catch it at INOX (Forum): 1 pm, 3.30 pm, 6 pm, 10.30 pm; INOX (City Centre): 12.40 pm; 89 Cinemas: 2.30 pm, 4.55 pm, 7.20 pm

 Success story The movie is still going great guns though the collections at INOX have come down to 75 per cent in the fifth week. The five new releases this week do not seem to threaten the Sanjay Gadhvi speed rocker, yet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Till recently, a stroll along the Hooghly at Bagbazar?s Bichuli Ghat used to 

be really pleasant. But, nowadays the road along the river is in a disastrous 

condition, dotted with large potholes. Garbage is piled up at places and even 

the lighting is inadequate. A large number of foreigners frequent the area. I 

appeal to CMC to take necessary steps to beautify the place. 

 Debaprasad Mukherjee, Nayapatty Road. 

 Bengal?s greatest novelist Saratchandra Chattopadhyay used to live in a two-storeyed mud house made in Burmese style on the banks of Roopnarayan river in Samtaber. The peaceful surroundings helped him pen many a short story and novel. Now, of course, the river has shifted course by a kilometre, away from the house. The structure, where the novelist spent the last 12 years of his life, is in shambles, though a caretaker has been looking after the house for the past 30 years. I request the government and well-wishers to pool in funds to renovate this dilapidated mud house.

 Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park.

 A life-size bronze-coloured statue of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru 

at the JL Nehru Road-Park Street crossing is in a pitiable condition. The statue 

was installed in 1989 after shifting Mahatma Gandhi?s statue to its current Mayo 

Road site. The pedestal of the statue is partly damaged, thanks to years of disrepair. 

Such statues and plaques should not be installed in the first place when the government 

is unsure whether or not it can consistently spend on its upkeep. I request the 

authorities to repair and maintain these statues and plaques across the city. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia, Nadia. 

 Most unhygienic conditions prevail at Padmapukur Park on CIT Road in the Entally 

area. Mounds of garbage have accumulated at the entrance of the park. The side 

gates which open on to CIT Road have been blocked by encroachers. They have used 

the side gates to support their makeshift structures. Now, the entire park is 

used by them for their daily bathing and washing. They should be immediately evicted 

and the park cleaned. 

 Name and address not given. 

 BSNL pre-paid cards, under the recent ?buy three, get one free? offer, are 

in short supply. The employees at Mominpur telephone exchange say they are not 

aware of the offer and do not stock the coupons. BSNL should not bring out such 

schemes if it is not sure of meeting the demand. 

 Dev Mandi, Kidderpore.

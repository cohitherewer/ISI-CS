 An infinite struggle

 The struggle for liberation against dictatorial power is universal. In the history of human civilization, thousands of self-sacrificing revolutionaries have laid down their lives to ensure freedom for their people. Yet, it is a shame that once their duty is done, they seldom receive their due rewards; their brave and heroic deeds are all but forgotten. Those who survive their heady days of glory are forced to live out an existence in futile hope of recognition and respect. Gobardanga Naksha?s play, Cornel Ke Keu Chithi Lekhe Na, is about one such retired Colonel, who spends his days waiting for his pension letter, even 30 years after his retirement. What makes his condition even more miserable is that while his ailing wife mocks him for his failure to gain either honour or fortune, he himself laments the death of his son, who was, like himself, an idealist and a revolutionary. Based on a story by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and directed by Ashis Chattopadhyay, the play draws our attention to some critical problems of the modern polity through the tragic saga of the Colonel?s continuing struggles.

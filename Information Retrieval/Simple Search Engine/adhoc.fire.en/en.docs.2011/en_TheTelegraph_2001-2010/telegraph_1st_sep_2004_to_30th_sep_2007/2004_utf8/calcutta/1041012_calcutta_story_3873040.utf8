The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

Sreelekha Mitra: Mithun?s wife, Rahul?s mom

 In one film, he?s a loveable lawyer, in the other he?s a cold-blooded contract killer on a night-long killing spree (anything?s possible in the movies). Yes, we?re talking about Tom Cruise. Love him or hate him, he?s on screens big and small this month. There?s Jerry Maguire that won him an Oscar nomination for best actor, on HBO, and Collateral, his first real bad-guy role, hitting the halls.

 In a curious war of the roses, the former husband-wife duo will battle it out for the Calcutta box-office. Whether Kidman?s The Human Stain will reign supreme or Cruise?s Collateral will score, only weeks will tell.

 What?s common to the two stars is that they both dropped out of school to pursue acting. But that?s where most similarities end. As a boy, Tom Cruise Mapother IV was a Franciscan seminary student, ready to be a career priest, after having spent a nomadic life. 

 The youngest of four children is right now busy working on Mission Impossible III, and H.G. Wells? sci-fi novel War of the Worlds, directed by Steven Spielberg. Playing an assassin is a world apart from being a priest, but that?s exactly what the New York-born 42-year-old is in Collateral, the first film in which he plays a villain to the core. There?s been enough hype about his new-look silver hair and it?s time to check it out at INOX.

 If it?s a light romance you?re looking for, Jerry Maguire is a sure-fire hit. The film, apart from Renee Zelwegger and Cuba Godding Jr, has an added appeal in the adorable six-year-old Jonathan Lipnicki as Zelwegger?s son Ray. It?s a heart-warming tale of love and friendship, quite opposite to the hard dose of fear and violence in Collateral.

Tom Cruise: Colour me bad

 If everything works out fine, Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s yet untitled film could prove to be a windfall for TV star Sreelekha Mitra. The film-maker has decided to cast Sreelekha as Mithun Chakraborty?s wife and Rahul Bose?s mother ? yes, you read it right ? after some frantic talent-scouting in Tollywood.

 ?Getting a competent cast from the Bengal film industry is posing to be a big problem these days? But Sreelekha is a very powerful actress,? said Dasgupta, who is considering Bipasha Basu as Rahul?s wife in his film revolving around a father-son relationship.

 ?I am yet to sign on the dotted lines and, so, would like to keep my fingers crossed,? said Sreelekha, after screen-testing for her role which would find her in two completely different looks ? that of a young wife and an elderly mother.

 The aged look is likely to fox the audience, as it would certainly not be a hideous grey wig that she would be sporting (like in Tollywood masalas). 

 For the special make-up, the producers of Dasgupta?s film (Jhamu Sughand) are roping in Vikram Gaikwad, the man who turned Kamal Hassan into a desi Mrs Doubtfire in Chachi 420. ?He had also dressed up Subhas Chandra Bose (Sachin Khedekar) in Shyam Benegal?s Netaji,? added Dasgupta.

Nicole: New challenge

 Wheels, the longest-running automobile show in India, is back for a brand new series on BBC World, with the first episode airing on October 2. The USP of the programme is unbiased and exclusive reviews of cars and bikes.

 The 13-part series will be more energetic and interactive. Grapevine, the section opening the show, features the latest news from the automobile world.

 The car review section will then feature presenters Yudhishtir Urs and Sonam Kalra analysing latest models to hit the Indian market. Face-offs between competing brands will also take place.

 In the Kick Start segment, bike enthusiast Neeraj Chinappa and professional hill biker Sherry will put new two-wheelers to the test.

 Another new section, Forum, presented by Shabri Malik, will let viewers share stories, comments and their passion for all things motorable.

 The first episode took the viewers for an exclusive ride in the new Audi TT. Wheels will be on air every Saturday at 10 pm, with a repeat telecast on Sunday at noon.

 She?s a study in contrasts. Just when you think you have the lovely lady pigeonholed, Nicole Kidman confounds every expectation. One of Australia?s most famous exports to Hollywood was actually born in Hawaii and lived for a while in the US. Batman Forever and Moulin Rouge, Eyes Wide Shut and The Hours ? all diverse films in which she plays very different characters. Just when her critics are ready to write her off, she surprises them twice over. 

 One of the most intense films she has done is The Human Stain in 2003, finally out on the big screen in Calcutta this week. But while the focus of attention has been co-star Anthony Hopkins, Kidman kicked up quite a storm of her own.

 Based on Pulitzer Prize-winning author Philip Roth?s book, The Human Stain is a true story of a professor in small-town America with a secret that threatens his fall.

 Coleman Silk (Hopkins) is the central figure, and it is his affair with Kidman?s character, janitor and farm-hand Faunia Farley, that sets him on a slippery slope.

 The 37-year-old plays a 25-year-old in love with a 70-year-old man. But that wasn?t a problem, she claimed. ?The reason people are drawn together, the reason people choose each other, we never know,? she said in an interview.

 Another surprise: ?I cleaned toilets when I was an usherette in Sydney and my hands got very dirty. Whether you believe me or not, I tried to do the best I could to honour her (Faunia) as a woman.?

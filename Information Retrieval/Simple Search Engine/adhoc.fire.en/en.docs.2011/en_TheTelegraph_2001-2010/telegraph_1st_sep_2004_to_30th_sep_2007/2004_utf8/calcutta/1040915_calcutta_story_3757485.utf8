 Professor and head of cardiology department, SSKM Hospital

 Processions and shouting of slogans have been banned on hospital premises. This used to be a frequent problem earlier, disturbing the sleep of patients on post-operative sedatives. This can be fatal. The security at our hospital gate has also been strengthened. This is to prevent relatives of patients from gatecrashing. Five people go in where one is supposed to. There should be a sense of responsibility on their part. A nurse has to take care of 50 to 100 patients in various wards. So we have given permission to a person from the patient?s house to stay with him or her. During the visiting hours, between 4 and 6 pm, two people can go in to meet the patient. Instead, a group forces its way in. So many deaths take place just after visiting hours as there is so much disturbance, with scant regard for others in the ward. The media should also be sensitive. I have faced a reporter from a TV channel walking into an operating theatre while I was doing an angioplasty.

 Bandh alert, Chhat vigil

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In tandem with the bandh bandobast, the police have Chhat puja to grapple with the day after. Chief Sujoy Chakraborty has asked his officers to be particularly vigilant about banned firecrackers during the processions, with revellers in large numbers arriving from Bihar and Jharkhand.

 So, immediately after the bandh, a dedicated group of officers will hit the roads to clear the way for Chhat puja processions. They will be in touch with control room officers from Wednesday night.

 All this is pushing the force to the brink. Officers have started complaining of burning eyes, insomnia and even high pressure. ?In all my 23-years of service, it?s never been this way. The problem with Chhat is that you have to stay awake all night, since the revellers return late,? said an officer.

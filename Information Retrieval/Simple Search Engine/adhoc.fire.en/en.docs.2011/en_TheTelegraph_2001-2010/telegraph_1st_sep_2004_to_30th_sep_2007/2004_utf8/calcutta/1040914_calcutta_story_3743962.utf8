 Past ?n? present in music medley

 It might have felt half-whipped at the box-office, but his Mango Souffl? tasted sweet success in the festival circuit. And now Mahesh Dattani is back with his new film Morning Raga, which boasts an impressive cast comprising Shabana Azmi, Perizaad Zorabian and newcomer Prakash Rao.

 Within days of wrapping up post-production, the film has been selected as the official entry to Mannheirm-Heidelberg International Film Festival, under International Discoveries. Dattani?s response: ?It?s quite a coup, even if I say so myself.?

 While other directors (like Pamela Rooks) are adapting Dattani?s plays for their films, the award-winning playwright has chosen to go with an original screenplay for Morning Raga. ?I don?t think I want to get into a rut where I spend the rest of my valuable years adapting my stage plays to screenplays. Besides, each project is different and it all depends on what excites me ? a new idea or the screen possibilities of my plays.?

 That Mango Souffl? didn?t work at the box-office did play on his mind before Dattani set out on his second directorial venture. ?I did have that mental baggage when I started off with Morning Raga. But I was clear that I wasn?t going to compromise on my sensibilities. I just had to think more universally. That is why I chose the subject of music as central to my theme.?

 Morning Raga, slated to release in India in November, is about three individuals trying to overcome their pasts. As the past meets the present, it is through the blend of Western and Carnatic music that the protagonists come together.

 The film wouldn?t have been possible without the leading man. ?It all started with Prakash,? recalls Dattani. 

 ?He was a student in my acting workshop about six years ago who got serious about acting and studied at the Lee Strasberg School in New York for a year. After working in a Telugu film, he came over to Bangalore and asked me whether I would be interested in working on a project with him. We approached his father, K. Raghavendra Rao, one of the biggest producers in the Telugu film industry, who agreed readily. Prakash and I worked furiously on the screenplay and then set about the casting.?

And that is exactly where differences crept in. ?I 

had already made up my mind I wanted Perizaad, Shabana and Lillete for the other 

parts but I didn?t let Prakash in on that as he was a lot more ambitious than 

I was. He wanted Preity Zinta and Tabu!?

 ?Just to be fair?, Dattani had serious auditions in Mumbai and Hyderabad for the parts. Perizaad came in for the auditions and sailed through. Lillete was more than happy to do the part having worked with Dattani before. But the Shabana bit took time. ?I called her in London and she seemed excited about the story and wanted to read the script. I sent it to her. After reading it, she called me and we spoke at length about her characterisation and she said ?yes? soon after.?

 Behind the camera, too, Dattani got ?great people? to work with him. ?The real unexpected bonus for me was getting Rajiv Menon as cinematographer? I did have artistic differences with him on the sets, but he has done a fabulous job of the cinematography.? 

 Dattani also had the multiple award-winning Sreekar Prasad as scissorhands. ?He is one of the best editors we have in the country,? gushes the director. ?He has a major role in making the film one of quality and substance, along with Amit Heri who has provided the music.?

 Will Morning Raga be just limited to festivals or cater to the mainstream audience, too? ?Hopefully, both,? signs off Dattani.

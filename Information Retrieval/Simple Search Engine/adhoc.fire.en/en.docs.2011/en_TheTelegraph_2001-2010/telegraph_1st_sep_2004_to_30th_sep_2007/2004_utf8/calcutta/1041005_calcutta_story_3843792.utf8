The multi-genre channel, created exclusively for kids in India, has launched Dekho Roz Jeeto Roz, a contest that offers added incentives for spending the evening hours with Sitting Duck, Mr Bean, Beakman and the Looney Tunes.

 Further, the weekly grand prize-winners will also win a computer each.

 Kids glued to the screen need to identify the prime number appearing during Prime Pogo block telecast every day between 5 and 7.30 pm. The entries can be sent to POGO in three ways ? via special telephone numbers displayed on-air, by sending an SMS with the text POGO to 8888 or by logging on to POGO?s website, www.pogo.tv. A new prime number appears every day and viewers can send in multiple entries.

 The Dekho Roz Jeeto Roz enticements are reaching out to young viewers from hoardings, school buses, print advertising and web-based promotions. In addition, a six-city school contact programme (Calcutta is one of the chosen six) has been undertaken to reach out to children. 

If the contest is not enough to get kids hooked on 

the channel, POGO is featuring four all-time favourite films in October. While 

Free Willy I (picture above), the story of a magical friendship between 

a 12-year-old street kid and a three-tonne killer whale, airs this Friday at 7.30 

pm, Black Beauty, based on Anna Sewell?s novel, takes one on a ride of 

a horse?s journey of life from one master to another on Sunday, October 24, at 

3 pm. The Academy Award-winning Wizard of Oz follows on the last day of 

the month at 3 pm.

 Kate Hudson: Tips on offer 

 She was always almost famous, being Goldie Hawn?s daughter. Then Almost Famous made her a household name in the world of cinema. And now you can learn from the beautiful blonde how to get rid of your man in 10 days. Yes, the Indian TV premiere of How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days will happen on October 23 at 9 pm on HBO.

 In the romantic comedy, Kate Hudson plays Andie, a young Cosmopolitan-type journalist who?s bored writing a cheesy advice column for a magazine. 

 To make things spicier, she decides to write a piece on the things women do that turn men off. As research work for the same, she tries to snare and then scare off a man in 10 days.

 The darling-in-distress is advertising man Ben, played by Matthew McConaughey (A Time To Kill). What follows is hilarious for some ? a howler for others ? with Kate trying everything in the book and beyond to send him packing while Matthew stays put in all earnestness.

 Unlike the premise of the film though, Kate doesn?t want to scare away her real-life husband, rocker Chris Robinson. They are very much in love for the five-odd years they have been together and have a kid son. Kate is also busy helping run the production company she co-owns with her mother, step dad and brother Owen. And it is Goldie Hawn the producer that influences her more than Goldie Hawn the actor.

 So get your popcorn ready and prepare to spend Dashami evening in the company of Kate and Matthew, drawn by the cast and the tagline. ?One of Them is Lying. So is the Other.?

Nandini Singh: Going places

 From a Jet Airways airhostess to a Marilyn Monroe lookalike in the Aryans music video Dekha hai teri aankhon ko to making her film debut in a Subhash Ghai production, Nandini Singh sure has come a long way.

 The girl, who played Govinda?s love interest in the David Dhawan comedy Ek Aur Ek Gyarah, produced by Ghai?s Mukta Arts, has settled on the small screen as the pretty Kesar in the popular serial by the same name.

 The serial at the moment is at a dramatic stage with Kesar?s husband Rudra starting a business of investing in shares. He does not know that he is actually being used as a pawn by his partner Sethi. Kesar is sceptical about Rudra making a fast buck and it is soon revealed that Sethi is actually running an illegal business. 

 Learning that the cops are keeping a track of his dealings and can arrest him, he collects all the money, transfers the business in Rudra?s name and flees. Rudra is arrested and now has to repay Rs 5 crore to the investors, failing which he will be convicted. Kesar tries her best to collect the money, but in vain. 

 The Mallyas chip in with the money and Rudra is released but he falls prey to his own ego because he didn?t want to take the Mallyas? helping hand.

 In the middle of all this mayhem, Kesar gets to know she is pregnant. What happens next to Nandini?s Kesar? 

 Tune into Star Plus, at 2 pm on weekdays.

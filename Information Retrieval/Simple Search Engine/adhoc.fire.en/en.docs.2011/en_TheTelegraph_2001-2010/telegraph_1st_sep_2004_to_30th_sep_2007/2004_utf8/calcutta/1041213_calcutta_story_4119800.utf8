The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Abortion hoax haul-up

 - Consumer forum orders clinic to pay couple Rs 2 lakh

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Pinky Mishra, 24, the driver?s wife who had moved a consumer court a year ago after learning she was pregnant with twins despite the medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) procedure at an abortion clinic, has been awarded compensation.

 On December 6, the District Consumer Redressal Forum awarded a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to Pinky and Shankar Mishra, who had moved court against the Marie Stopes chain, stating it was not financially possible for them to raise two more children.

 ?We had raised money for the abortion with great difficulty? but it was in vain because of their (the clinic?s) callousness,? the couple said in its complaint.

 One of their twin daughters died recently following an illness, the couple?s lawyers revealed on Sunday.

 The Pinky Mishra case was brought to light last July by The Telegraph in a report highlighting how the Mishras were duped at the Barasat branch of the Marie Stopes chain of clinics.

 In May 2003, Pinky Mishra, a mother of two, had gone to the clinic for an abortion. ?My husband is a driver and earns around Rs 1,500 per month and so MTP was the only option left to us... We did not know that we would be cheated,? says Pinky.

 On May 8, 2003, Pinky underwent a surgical procedure for abortion and sterilisation. On May 22, the clinic examined her, prescribed follow-up medicines and issued a certificate stating: ?laparoscopic ligation with MTP done on 8/5/2003?. 

 The clinic also advised ultrasonography (USG). The May 24 USG showed Pinky pregnant with twins.

 When no explanation was forthcoming from the Barasat clinic or the Delhi headquarters of Marie Stopes, the couple turned to lawyers Arup, Mitali and Soumitra Dasgupta.

 The clinic argued that the couple did not heed medical advice related to MTP. So, Marie Stopes could not be held responsible for Pinky?s plight.

 Finally, on December 6, Md Abdul Hai, president of the District Redressal Consumer Forum in Barasat, pulled up the clinic on grounds of negligence and awarded Rs 2 lakh as compensation to the couple.

 ?In case of non-payment of compensation in three months time, a further eight per cent interest will be levied on the compensation amount, until the sum is finally paid,? said Soumitra Dasgupta.

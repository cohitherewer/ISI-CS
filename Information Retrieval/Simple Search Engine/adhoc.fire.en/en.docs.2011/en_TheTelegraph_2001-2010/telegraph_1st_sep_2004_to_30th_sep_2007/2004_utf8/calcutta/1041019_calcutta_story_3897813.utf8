 Ode to Goddess Durga

 God is omniscient and omnipotent. We worship Goddess Durga, the embodiment of power, knowledge, wealth, beauty and fame. Man has no end to hankering for these imposed qualities without any labour. Once achieved, he thinks no end of himself and always tries to misuse these qualities. He takes pride in proclaiming these qualities to others and often uses them to exploit the weaker sections of society. What he fails to realise is that he is like a dust particle compared to the supreme power. From the most powerful man to the most beautiful woman, everything falls into insignificance in presence of the eternal force of this Universe which is dominated by Goddess Durga ? one of the many forms of shakti, the divine power. In an effort to glorify the supreme power and keeping in line with the festive spirit, Modern Mime Centre hosts its new venture, Durga, with Dr Subhra Sanyal and Kamal Naskar on stage.

 Event: Durga ? a mime show presented by Modern Mime Centre

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Where: Sisir Mancha

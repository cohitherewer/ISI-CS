 Scientist?s body found in drain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 On Tuesday, while World Alzheimer?s Day was being observed, Calcutta lost a scientist, who fell victim to dementia and died a tragic death.

 The body of Arun Sen, 70-year-old scientist of Calcutta University?s radio physics department, was recovered from a drain in Madhyamgram on Tuesday evening. Sen had been suffering since last year from dementia, a neuro-degenerative disease leading to acute memory failure and waning of intellectual abilities. 

 Known for his research in defence-related matters, the gaunt, six-foot-tall scientist had been missing for the past few days from his Baranagar residence. Sen had lost his memory and the ability to speak and make decisions. 

 ?On the morning of September 17, the main door of our house was open and my father managed to slip out. Today, we found him lying dead in a drain at Madhyamgram. He was probably walking aimlessly,? Sen?s son Partha said. 

 Rajabazar Science College, where Sen had worked for more than four decades, mourned his death. 

 Sen had headed many defence ministry research projects since 1990. Several of his inventions were accepted by the ministry.

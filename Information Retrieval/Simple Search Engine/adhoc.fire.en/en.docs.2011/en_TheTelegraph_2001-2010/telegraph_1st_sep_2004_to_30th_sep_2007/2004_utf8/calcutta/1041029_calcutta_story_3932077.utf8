The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

 Turn to firang flavours after the desi overdose this festive 

fortnight. Here?s sailing to different shores to power your Continental platter 

this weekend ? so what if you couldn?t quite manage that phoren trip this 

year! 

Campaign trail

 Tune into the politics of the most powerful country in the world for a campaign 

as combative and colourful as can be. ?Mate, looks like the President is truly 

Bushed, what with Kerry getting the Clinton by his side? gives you liberal 

room for conjecture. The Americans themselves seem more concerned with scandals 

like the sexual orientation of Mary Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, with less 

than a week to go before what has all the makings of a cliffhanger. So you can 

happily give the outsourcing debate a miss, even if sonny has been developing 

a drawl lately to fit into the call centre scheme of things, and dwell instead 

on Kerry and the confetti!

Steel smart

If the $ 30 million wedding of daughter Vanisha with 

celeb trimmings like Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai and Kylie Minogue didn?t impress 

you earlier this year, now is the time to act proud Indian with Lakshmi Mittal 

set to officially become the world?s largest steelmaker. Facts and figures to 

rattle at that business bash would be the Calcutta boy?s output of about 63 million 

tonnes of liquid steel set to overtake his closest rival, the French company, 

Arcelor, which produced 42.8 million tonnes last year. ?Our man Mittal?s personal 

wealth of 3.5 billion dollars even surpasses our population,? would be an in-the-box 

joke to crack. 

Cricket crib

No cricket talk, please, could be the right way to 

open your innings at the party, before you play master blaster. Let go of some 

steam against a bunch of overpaid, under-performing losers. Paper tigers tamed 

by the kangaroos can be your politest gaali to Ganguly?s men. And when 

it?s pointed out that dada didn?t even make it to the Nagpur greentop, 

blast away at him, too, (?Prince of Calcutta or Pussyfoot Maharaj?)? But being 

a true-blue Team India man, keep on living in hope of a Tendulkar turnaround.

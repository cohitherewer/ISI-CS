The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Brave the crowd for piety sake

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Will anjali on the Net replace the real ritual in crowded pandals for the devout? 

 Begging for a boon: A picture of devotion 

in a pandal

P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur Avenue

 If the real ritual is replaced on the Net, the very objective and motive of anjali will be lost. In such a case, it would be just a mechanical performance and an individual?s hearty plea to the goddess in devout participation in the ritual will be sorely missing.

 Sourish Mishra,

Salt Lake

The satisfaction and enjoyment of offering anjali 

with others in a crowded pandal can never be matched by a similar offering on 

the Net. But this phenomenon is likely to become popular in future among people 

who live outside the country, and for the elderly who find it difficult to travel 

to pandals for offering pushpanjali. 

Arijit Ghosh, 

 Shyamnagar

 Anjali on the Net is a boon for those living abroad and for those who want to avoid crowds. But it is an artificial approach, without the sound of the dhaak creating the atmosphere for friends and family to get together for the puja. The real ritual in crowded pandals, on the other hand, might be the traditional approach to anjali, but a crowded pandal might not be the best venue for those seeking peace during the vacation. 

T.R. ANAND,

 Budge Budge

 If anjali can be offered on the Net to avoid traditional offerings in pandals, then why not perform Durga puja on the Net and avoid constructing pandals at every street corner? Though technical advancements are taking over every sphere of life today, there are still quite a few areas where technology cannot replace tradition. 

Naren Sen,

 Ramrajatola

 It is absolutely true that anjali on the Net will not serve the purpose of the devotees. It can?t be the perfect substitute for the real ritual in a crowded pandal. The devout would always prefer offering anjali in a puja pandal as it provides the perfect atmosphere for meditation and prayer. However, e-anjali might assist those who live in a place where Durga puja is not celebrated. But since that is not the case in West Bengal, people here would any day prefer coming to the pandals for anjali. The Pujas, after all, is the only occasion when youngsters of the opposite sex can mix freely in a decent atmosphere in the absence of parental supervision.

Debashish Chakraborty,

 Chitpur

 Definitely not. There is dignity in an age-old tradition. To offer anjali before the goddess in a pandal is an ancient Hindu ritual. It offers immense satisfaction to the devotees, no matter how crowded the pandal is. Anjali on the Net will never substitute the real ritual.

R. Baksi,

 Delhi

 How to offer prayers is something that varies from person to person. A saint might be able to meditate amidst chaos but a layman may not be able to do so. Common people often feel the need of a physical presence to help concentrate better. For someone who believes that the physical environment of a puja pandal is necessary for him/her to focus the mind, offering e-anjali might seem very fake. For some, however, it might be a good enough avenue to express his devotion to the Almighty.

Shrijit Venkatesh,

 Salt Lake

 The question would be more logical if the term devout is not used in the context. After all, any person who sincerely wishes to offer anjali ought to be defined as ?devout?. If offering anjali was merely observing a ritual without genuine feelings, how would it matter whether it is on the Net or in a pandal? Many websites nowadays have provisions for each and every step to follow while offering anjali.

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata

 All things change due to the needs of time. Having said that, it is up to the individual to choose between the pandal and the Net. 

Ayon Hazra,

 Delhi

 Puja is not just about offering prayers. It is a social occasion as much as a religious one. Hence, offering prayer over the Internet will never be as popular as anjali in person. The religious will find it difficult to reconcile with the idea of an anjali offered from the comforts of one?s chair.

Chandan Ray,

 Shakuntala Park

 Anjali on the Net is not a desirable practice. It will only lessen the charm of the biggest festival in this part of the world. But if dhaak, kanshor-ghanta and dhunchis can coexist with corporate sponsorship during the Pujas, then I am sure anjali on the Net could also be a part of it.

Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road

 No, anjali on the Net will in no way replace the real ritual in crowded pandals. This is because offering prayers on the Net lacks the sanctity of the ritual. This entails that anjali be offered at the place of worship, even if it is crowded. The jostling and pushing in a pandal is definitely a problem but it should be solved by the puja organisers. They should ask the devotees to queue up in a disciplined manner. The large turnout at a pandal is expected during the festive days. One can?t expect just a handful of people coming to offer prayers to the goddess.

Pankaj Bhatia,

 Loudon Street

 Anjali is a sacred ritual. It is not meant for people who aim just to have a good time during the Pujas. The devout, even if they are old and ailing, would always prefer to offer anjali in person.

Virendra Shah,

 Amratala Lane

 Anjali on the Net may bring some relief to the elderly and the physically infirm but it cannot provide the joy and the satisfaction of the pandal experience. A cricket match is a similar example. Watching the game in person, on the grounds, is different from watching it live on television. However, it is of utmost importance that the organisers manage the crowd at the pandal properly. 

Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 Youngsters cannot afford to miss thronging the pandals while the aged and the sick may opt for e-anjali if they have access to the Net. However, the lively surroundings and the ambience at a pandal can never be replaced by resorting to the computer at home or in a cyber caf?. There will be no real interaction between the priest and the devotees and one can at best shower the flowers on the idol on-screen. Anjali on the Net will be just a proxy. However, time will tell whether the Net version of anjali will take over the one at the pandal or not.

Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 The Internet cannot replace rituals like sandhipuja, anjali, offering of naibedya, bhog, arati etc which are an intrinsic part of Durga puja. Devout Hindus cherish participating in these auspicious ceremonies. Durga puja has a grandeur of its own. The enchanting mantras with the dhaak beats as a backdrop create a splendid atmosphere which no sophistication of technology can compete with. 

P. Chowdhury,

 Lake Town

 If there can be adda on the net, why not anjali? It is a brilliant idea; one that can make the Pujas an occasion to celebrate all over the globe. With lives becoming increasingly hectic, anjali on the Net is the only way to keep alive the tradition.

 Married for love, burnt for dowry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Susmita Saha, mother of a two-year-old daughter, was set on fire by her husband and in-laws on Sunday night. 

 Rescued by her neighbours on Khan Mohammad Road, in Behala, Susmita is battling for life in hospital.

 Police have picked up her father-in-law, Sukumar, for interrogation and are on a hunt for husband Kausik, a member of the DYFI, the CPM?s youth wing. 

 A youth suffered burns trying to save Susmita. The mob that had gathered damaged the Sahas? home.

 Susmita married Kausik, an employee of a private firm, two-and-a-half years ago, after a long courtship. The torture for dowry started soon after.

 ?My daughter and son-in-law were childhood friends. Moreover, we are neighbours. So, I had no hesitation in giving my consent to their marriage,? said Nanigopal Mondal, Susmita?s father. 

 ?But three months into the marriage, the behaviour of her husband and in-laws changed dramatically. They would torture her daily, ordering her to fetch money from me. She did not tell us anything. But when the torture escalated, she broke down,? added Mondal. 

 On Sunday night, when people in the neighbourhood were busy watching immersion processions, Kausik and his father beat up Susmita and poured kerosene on her, before setting her ablaze. 

 Coincidentally, her father was passing by. Hearing a scream, he entered the house and found his daughter in flames. He raised an alarm, that had the neighbours rush over. They took Susmita to Vidyasagar Hospital. 

 Local Trinamul Congress councillor Shyamadas Roy alleged that officers at Sarsuna police station were initially reluctant to register a case, as Kausik is a DYFI activist. ?Even while Susmita was being rushed to hospital, Kausik and his friends were threatening Mondal with dire consequences if he called in the cops,? Roy added. 

 ?My officers are looking into the case,? said additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Subarno.

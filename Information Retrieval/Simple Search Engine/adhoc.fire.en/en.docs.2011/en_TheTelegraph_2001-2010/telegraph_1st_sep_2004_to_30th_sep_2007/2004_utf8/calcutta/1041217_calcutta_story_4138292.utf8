The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Switch on for Team India

 - Channel to beam live day?s play only from Chittagong

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In the stare game between government and broadcaster, the sports bouquet has blinked first. As a result, all of Calcutta can tune into ESPN just to watch Team India take on Bangladesh on Friday morning.

 ESPN STAR Sports declared on Thursday that it would switch on its beam for the second Test on the networks of Indian Cable Net and Manthan. Covering over half of the cable homes in the city, the two multi-system operators have been locked in a dues dispute with the sports bouquet since November 22.

 ?It?s not a solution,? clarified Sricharan Iyengar, vice-president, sales and marketing, ESPN STAR Sports. The beam, after all, will be back only for the duration of each day?s play at Chittagong. Also, while ESPN will be on air, STAR Sports won?t.

 ?We made this gesture at the express request of the state government, so that cricket-lovers do not miss out on the match. We have also been assured that the government will resolve the matter in the next few days,? added Iyengar.

 There was a sigh of relief from Writers? Buildings, too. ?It?s in the interest of the people that the government had to ensure everyone gets to see the match,? said an official. What he left unsaid was that the government had made it clear to the broadcaster that denying the cricket-lover his due could cause a law-and-order problem in Calcutta.

 Iyengar and other ESPN STAR Sports officials met deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Peeyush Pandey at Lalbazar on Thursday to discuss the cable conflict. ?We were told that police would ensure there is no signal piracy and that our commercial interests were safeguarded,? a spokesperson for the broadcaster revealed.

 Till late on Thursday, however, officials of Indian Cable Net and Manthan remained in the dark about the turn of events. ?Nothing has been officially communicated to us by the broadcaster,? said an Indian Cable Net spokesperson. ?But if sports-lovers are able to watch the match, why should we have a problem?? he asked.

 This is a replay of the Euro 2004 switch-off-switch-on of ESPN STAR Sports in June on Manthan, when the sports channels were on air just for the high-profile soccer matches.

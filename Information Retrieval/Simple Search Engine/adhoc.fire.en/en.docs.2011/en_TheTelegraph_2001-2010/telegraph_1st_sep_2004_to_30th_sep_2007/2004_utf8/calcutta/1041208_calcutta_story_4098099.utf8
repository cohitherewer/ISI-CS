Violin voyager

Music Zone

L. Subramaniam talks to Sangita Sultania 

G . Roy about his musical journey over the years

L Subramaniam is a violin voyager who believed in 

charting his own course. Now we have The Best of Dr. L. Subramaniam, a 

compilation released recently capturing the many moods his music has traversed 

over the years. The living legend provides a glimpse into the remarkable journey.

 You were among the first Indian 

classical musicians to step into jazz. What made you go in that direction?

It all started in the 70s? I had just finished my 

masters in Western music and went on a tour with George Harrison, in which I happened 

to meet jazz artistes like Larry Coryell, who approached me to collaborate with 

them. I was hesitant at first but then I realised what a huge scope different 

elements from different parts of music provided. Orchestra, jazz, jugalbandis?different 

things were happening on different fronts and I wanted to create new styles of 

writing compositions. I went on to do my first jugalbandi at that time 

with Ustad Ali Akbar Khan saab. In the realm of fusion, I started experimenting 

with different compositions, the earliest of which was with Larry Coryell. In 

the album Global Fusion, there?s major orchestration with musicians from 

various countries. 

 What inspires you to compose?

Different things inspire at different times? Like 

a beautiful winter in Austria propelled me to compose this western romantic ballad 

called Winter in Austria when I had gone there for an Indian classical 

music festival. The entire town was reverberating with music and it was quite 

surreal. Similarly, there?s an amazing album called Conversations composed 

with Stephane Grappelli, which is like two people talking on violin. It?s the 

result of the vibe we shared.

 How did you select the tunes on the current compilation?

The repertoire is rich and varied. There are different 

soloists who feature in the album, each with their own distinct tonality and composition. 

The pieces vary from a simple violin and piano composition between me and Herbie 

Hancock on one hand to very complex compositions with musicians from my father?s 

generation. Then there is a song, Tillana, sung by my wife Kavita, which 

is a very complex composition again. Flight of the Humble Bee is another 

piece that deserves special mention as it is the most difficult piece ever written 

for violin.

 Can you recall some of your most memorable performances 

so far?

The concert in Lincoln Centre in New York earlier 

this year with George Duke and Stanley Clarke as part of the Lakshminarayana Global 

Music Festival was very enjoyable. Thereafter, the festival travelled to Singapore, 

Malaysia and Australia where I performed alongside Kavita and my daughter Seetaa. 

It was more like a family vacation and was great fun.

 How has your family, especially your father, shaped 

your music?

My father was my guru, mentor and guide and all my 

techniques have been developed by his advice. It is under his tutelage that I 

learned how to use the entire range available for violin, the cross bowing technique, 

sliding? everything. Learning my father?s impeccable Carnatic style has also helped 

me crossover to different genres of music. 

 Your brothers also play the same instrument. How 

do the three of you vary in your musical approach?

Even though we play the same instrument, our specialisation 

and interests vary. My elder brother Vaidyanathan loves writing music and my younger 

brother Shankar is more into singing. I like to play and I also write. 

 Do you and your wife Kavita collaborate musically?

I am working on a project with Kavita that involves 

other Indian musicians like Lucky Ali, Pandit Jasraj, Hariharan, Sonu Nigam and 

others. It?s basically Kavita?s album, which I am producing.

 How do you balance a classical career with a parallel 

one in fusion?

A case in point would be the nature of my appearances 

in Calcutta. I performed with Luc Ponty and Billy Cobham some time ago and I?m 

coming back to deliver an Indian classical concert on January 12 at Ramakrishna 

Mission. I am supposed to perform again on January 26 at the Science City auditorium. 

 Which of your collaborations are most special 

to you?

Recording my first fusion album Fantasy Without 

Limits with the finest backing line-up comprising Frank Morgan, Emil Richards 

and Milcho Leviev on the request of producer Richard Boch was a wonderful experience. 

It was selected as one of the top 10 albums of the year in the US. Performing 

with violin phenomenon Lord Yehudi Menuhin in New York to celebrate the 40th year 

of India?s Independence was very special as well. Composing Fantasy on Vedic 

Chants for Zubin Mehta is also a memorable experience, which premiered in 

New York. 

 Display of virtuoso musicianship has been the 

hallmark of your albums. What other musical ideas have you expressed in this album?

Confluence II, Blossom and Miss Melody 

are some of the tracks in the new album featuring very slow melodies which 

are not at all flashy. The different elements packed into the album are a classic 

example that music can be performed at different levels and spiritual modes ? 

peaceful, melodic, balanced.

 What?s the favourite film soundtrack that you 

have composed?

Salaam Bombay, Mississippi Masala, Little 

Buddha and a Malayalam film, Ehe Sne Ga Theerathu, are some of films 

I?ve given music for. Salaam Bombay was the first film I did and I really 

enjoyed working with Mira (Nair).

 What can we expect from L. Subramaniam now?

I am doing a project involving a 100-piece Chinese 

orchestra. This apart, I will be touring heavily for the Lakshminarayana Global 

Music Festival, which is in its 14th year now. Besides these commitments, it?s 

my dream to establish an institute dedicated to my father, which will be called 

the Lakshminarayana Global Institute. The first branch will be in Bangalore apart 

from other centres including one in Perth, Australia.

Billed for the best 

Its not exactly the Grammies, but the Billboard 

Music Awards is one of the more prestigious awards in the industry. And its 

just as much for the names on the nominees list as for the performers. The 

2004 edition will take place at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

The line-up of performers includes Alicia Keys (picture above), Destinys 

Child, Usher, Green Day, Nelly, Gwen Stefani, Evanescence and Sheryl Crow. Keys 

will perform Karma from her latest album while Destinys Child is set to 

appear with Mary J. Blige and Diana Ross as part of a musical tribute to Stevie 

Wonder, who will be bestowed with the Century Award.

 Usher and Keys lead the list of finalists, appearing in 13 and 12 categories, 

respectively. The Billboard awards are given to artistes and songs as determined 

by their performance on the weekly charts of Billboard magazine.

 In the running for album of the year are Keys The Diary of Alicia Keys, 

OutKasts Speakerboxxx/The Love Below and Ushers Confessions. Kanye 

West heads the nominations for the best new male artiste, while Jessica Simpsons 

younger sister, Ashlee, leads the female category. Artistes like Beyonce Knowles 

and R. Kelly and bands like Incubus and Hoobastank are some of the other names 

on the nomination list.

Bangla unlimited

 It is the latest Bangla band to hit the circuit, and with one album under its 

belt, the group is serious about making music. The six-member Unlimited has been 

rocking Calcutta since 97, finally recording and releasing its eight-song 

self-titled album in October this year. 

 It has a very eastern sound, with a folk touch. There is some western 

rock influence, says 27-year-old Kaushik Sengupta, lead singer and songwriter 

with a day job in a software company. The songs on the album are on issues ranging 

from ove and hope to despair.

 The other members are agricultural engineer-turned-band manager Amitava Choudhury, 

engineering under-graduate Rahool Sarkar who is the bass guitarist and back vocalist, 

keyboardist Debdatta Ghosh who is pursuing post-graduation in business management, 

singer and accountant Ashit Baram Pal and keyboardist Joy. The Kalyani-based group 

has performed on radio shows, campuses and carnivals, and is ready to rock some 

more.

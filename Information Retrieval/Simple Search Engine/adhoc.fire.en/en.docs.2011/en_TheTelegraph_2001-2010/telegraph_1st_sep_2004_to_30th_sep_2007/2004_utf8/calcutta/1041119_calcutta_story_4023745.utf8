Sailorman?s success 

The sailorman is back ? in resplendent 3D animation. 

The 75th birthday of the beloved cartoon character sees him star in Popeye?s 

Voyage: The Quest for Pappy, a 44-minute movie for television and a subsequent 

DVD release. Made by Canada-based Mainframe Entertainment, this is the first Popeye 

animation movie in over 15 years. The challenge, according to King Features which 

distributes the cartoon, was to ?capture the kinetic style of Popeye?s theatrical 

cartoons?. Popeye?s silver-screen debut was in a 1933 Betty Boop cartoon called 

Popeye the Sailor, from Fleischer Studios. Till date, nearly 750 Popeye 

cartoons have been made. In 1980, Paramount Pictures released a live-action musical 

motion picture, in which Popeye was portrayed by Robin Williams and Olive Oyl 

by Shelley Duvall. In 1993, Cartoon Network celebrated the 60th anniversary of 

the sailor?s film debut with Popumentary, a series of six primetime specials.

Sportstar

He?s Turkey?s youngest sportsman to win a medal, and 

at no less than the Olympics, in Athens this year. The lightweight boxer almost 

became the youngest Olympic champ, losing the gold medal to a 24-year-old Cuban. 

But 17-year-old Atagun Yalcinkaya is the star to watch out for in the future. 

After the silver medal in August ? ?a great experience? is how he described it 

? Atagun is determined to take the top spot next time. That?s, of course, after 

winning laurels in other boxing championships.

 ORS, softer yet stronger 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 

 The World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef have made a recommendation that will have a positive impact on the management of diarrhoea, always a challenge in Calcutta and the rest of the state.

 Going by the recommendation, the state government has asked companies manufacturing Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) to modify the existing composition for better results.

 The new formula is low in sodium and glucose, and enables diarrhoea-stricken children and adults to retain body fluids better, health department officials said.

 ?Most diarrhoea cases are reported from the low-income areas like Tiljala, Topsia and Tangra, where basic healthcare and hygiene take a backseat,? said Atanu Mukherjee, an official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. He said the civic body buys 100,000 ORS pouches every year.

 At least 50 diarrhoea cases are reported at the BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children from various parts of the state every day. Some of the cases are referred to the Infectious Diseases Hospital at Beleghata.

 ?The government should look at improving the quality of ORS immediately,? BC Roy hospital superintendent Mrinal Chatterjee said.

 The new ORS has 75-mEq/1 sodium and 75-mmol/1 glucose, which is much below the existing formula. According to a WHO study, the new ORS is very gentle on the intestine and helps the body to retain fluids, thus reducing the need for intravenous fluids by more than 33 per cent.

 ?Parents often complain that despite administering ORS, their children look dehydrated. This could be due to the high sodium content in the existing formulation,? said B.K. Manocha, a city-based paediatrician.

 So far, only Dr Reddy?s Laboratory has introduced an ORS based on the new formula. Around half-a-dozen companies are working on the formula recommended by the two agencies.

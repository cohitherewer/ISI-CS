The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pappu shadow over jails

 A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state prison department on Wednesday asked superintendents of all five central jails across West Bengal to step up vigil on ?high-profile? prisoners lodged there.

 The precautionary step was taken in the wake of reports about the ?illegal activities? of Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Rajesh Ranjan, alias Pappu Yadav, inside Patna?s Beur jail. 

 ?We have to tone up the administration in the five central jails after the Beur jail incident. Jail superintendents have been asked to beef up security so that hardcore criminals cannot flout the jail manual,? principal secretary for jails P.K. Agarwal told Metro on Wednesday.

 ?Warders guarding the cells will henceforth conduct daily searches to prevent the inmates from getting access to mobile phones,? he added.

 The drive has been initiated on the basis of ?secret information? from jails that criminals like Aftab Ansari and Rashid Alam, alias Gabbar, are maintaining contact with the underworld dons outside the jails over mobile phones. 

 ?On previous occasions, it had been detected that mobile phones were supplied to inmates by warders on duty. That is why we have now decided to suspend a warder on the spot if found guilty of having a nexus with convicts and undertrials,? Agarwal added.

 While Ansari and his associates, arrested in connection with the American Center attack, are lodged in Presidency jail, Gabbar and Sheikh Vinod are in Alipore Central jail. Sources said Dilip Banerjee, alias Hatkata Dilip, now in Dum Dum Central jail, was last week warned against maintaining contact with his associates outside. 

 ?Mobile phones may be strictly forbidden in jails. But what can we do if high-risk prisoners send messages to criminals outside through warders? Can we have any machinery on monitoring warders when they are not on duty?? asked a senior official. 

 Principal secretary (jails) Agarwal said a strategy has been worked out to transfer warders and prison inmates from one jail to another on a regular basis so that they cannot develop links. 

 ?We have reports that some jail inmates send warders to their relatives? or even to their homes. A mass transfer of both inmates and warders will help us check the situation,? he observed. 

 The prison administration has also made it mandatory that the same batch of warders will not escort inmates to courts for production every time. ?A fresh batch of warders will escort the prisoners,? asserted deputy inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya. That apart:

 Prisoners 

not to be allowed to remain outside cells beyond 5 pm. Cells are unlocked at 6 

every morning

 An official, 

in addition to warders, will accompany a prisoner when he meets visitors once 

a week at the jail gate

 Barring 

those on Death Row, prisoners to take meals in the community kitchen. Warders 

not to fetch food for prisoners from outside

 Jail 

superintendents to visit cells daily and inquire about the inmates? well-being.

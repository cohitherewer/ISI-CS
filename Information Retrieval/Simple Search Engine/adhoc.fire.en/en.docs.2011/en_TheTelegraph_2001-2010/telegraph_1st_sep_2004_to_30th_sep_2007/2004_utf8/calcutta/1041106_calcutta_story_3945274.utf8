The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Families just wanna have fun

 - The lounge is the latest destination for festive get-togethers

 The Sens of Golf Green at Shisha

 The family get-together has found a new-age address ? the lounge, where leisurely hours can be spent late into the evening by two generations or even three.

 Picture this. Right after the Navami night aarti at the community puja, the Roys of Salt Lake still in their puja attire ? men in kurta pyjama and women in Devdas jewellery and dhakai jamdani ? head straight for Shisha, the hookah destination on Camac Street. The uncles and aunts, cousins and in-laws all troop into the plush fun destination and they all ended up having a rocking Puja party ? different, but memorable.

 ?This year, we have for the first time been witness to a large turnout of families during the days of the Puja and on Bijoya Dashami,? says Sovon Mukherjee, manager of Shisha, who claims to have played host to at least 30-odd Bengali families between Ashtami and Dashami.

 ?I am a regular at Shisha and love the place, so when my cousins came down from Mumbai and Delhi for the Pujas, the entire family decided to party there,? says Prithwiraj Sen, who hit Shisha on Ashtami night.

 Not to play party pooper to the family outings, the lounges relax their otherwise strict rules (like no open footwear) with a smile. And the music invariably shifts grooves from hip-hop to filmi, funky to family.

 The craze for a cool family hangout is cutting across community lines and is a trend here to stay this festive season and beyond.

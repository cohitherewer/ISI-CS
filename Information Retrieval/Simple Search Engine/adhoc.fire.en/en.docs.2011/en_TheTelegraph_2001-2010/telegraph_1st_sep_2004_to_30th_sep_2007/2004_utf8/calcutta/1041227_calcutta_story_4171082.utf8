 In south Calcutta, the Indian Plastic Federation in collaboration with Calcutta 

Municipal Corporation recently launched a drive to buy plastic garbage from households. 

However, the spring balances used by the Corporation staff are usually defective 

and it invariably shows lower weight. A bagful of plastic waste weighing 1 kg 

showed only 300 gms on the spring balance. The civic body must use accurate balances 

and check such malpractice, otherwise people may soon lose interest in selling 

the garbage to them.

 A wine shop in Salt Lake?s AE Block was reluctant to issue me a receipt for 

a purchase of two bottles of beer recently. When I insisted on a bill, the shopkeepers 

said that they do not encourage customers asking for receipts. They kept me waiting 

for around 10 minutes expecting that I would leave. In the meantime, they also 

catered to a few other customers. When they saw that I had not left, one of the 

men took out a receipt book but left about 15 to 20 pages blank before writing 

my bill. The same shop had been pulled up by the excise department about a year 

ago for evading paying the requisite taxes. It seems the shopkeepers have gone 

back to their old game again.

 A registered post I sent from Barisha post office never reached its destination. 

I lodged a written complaint with the post master at the Barisha office on October 

29. I also dropped a reminder to him on November 11 but have not received any 

reply so far.

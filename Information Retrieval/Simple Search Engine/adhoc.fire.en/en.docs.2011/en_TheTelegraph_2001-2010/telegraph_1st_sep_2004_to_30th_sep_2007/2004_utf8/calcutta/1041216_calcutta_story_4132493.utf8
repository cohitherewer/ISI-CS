 Deaths ring in mind study

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two incidents ? one in Tollygunge, in which six members of a family were slaughtered by Shibendu Saha in July, and the other in Howrah, where businessman Samir Bodhok killed his seven-year-old daughter and wife before taking his own life in November ? seem to have opened the eyes of the government to the pressing need for psychologists in the state. 

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is now making moves to popularise the study of psychology at the under-graduate level. Presently, aspiring psychologists have to travel to other states to study the subject extensively.

 However, the situation may soon change if a proposal to introduce psychology through the joint entrance examination (JEE) is cleared. ?The proposal is under active consideration. To start with, the course may have about 20 seats. But we are yet to finalise anything,? said a JEE council member on Wednesday. 

 Justifying the requirement to popularise the study of psychology, West Bengal University of Health Sciences vice-chancellor M.M. Choudhury said: ?We are very concerned at the spurt in suicides among students. Mass suicides and murders within the family, too, are not rare these days. There is a pressing demand for psychologists in West Bengal. The government?s measures will, hopefully, help tackle the malaise.?

 According to city-based psychiatrist R. Ghosh Roy: ?Pressure at home and at school or college have had a big impact. Children are under acute stress these days. And it is not just the children who are that way. Most of our patients are suffering from depression due to stress.? 

 He added: ?The demand for psychologists has never been greater. Due to the absence of trained psychologists, we often have to do a lot of counselling ourselves.?

 At the moment, there are about 325 registered psychiatrists and about 150 psychologists in the state, but most of the hospitals do not have them on their roster.

 ?Several patients require psychological counselling after prolonged illness, but, sadly, little is done in that regard,? said psychiatrist P.K. Pal.

 Recent surveys by the Union government have also revealed that mental illness is on the rise in Bengal, especially among school-going children.

 The findings had a hand in the state government waking up to the need for a full-time course in psychology for students who have cleared Higher Secondary or its equivalent.

 Basic psychology is now taught in the MBBS course. Doctors and medical students, however, feel that the module is inadequate. While medical students can do a master?s in psychiatry and obtain diplomas in psychiatric medicine, there aren?t many options for those wanting to study psychology.

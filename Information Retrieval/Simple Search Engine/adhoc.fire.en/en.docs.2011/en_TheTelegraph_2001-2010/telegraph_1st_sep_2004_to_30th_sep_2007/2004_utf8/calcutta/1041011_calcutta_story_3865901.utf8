 Pitted road blamed for mishap fatality

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Yet another fatal street mishap occurred on Diamond Harbour Road, in Taratala, on Saturday evening. 

 Agitated Behala residents threatened to stop all traffic movement along the stretch between Taratala and Thakurpukur, where the flyover is being constructed, after the Pujas, if the authorities concerned did not effectively repair the road. 

 Asit Mandal, 48, was killed on the spot after being hit by a state bus at around 9.30 pm. 

 Mandal had gone to fetch his daughter Mamoni from a tutorial class and was returning home when the accident occurred. When the bus bore down on the Mandals, the father pushed his daughter out of harm?s way but himself fell under its wheels. 

 According to police, Mandal?s head was crushed and doctors at Vidyasagar Hospital pronounced him dead. The driver of the bus fled, but the vehicle was impounded at Behala police station. 

 Later in the evening, a 100-strong mob blocked the road and vandalised a few buses that were parked along the road and some passing cars as well. A police contingent dispersed the mob around 10.45 pm.

 ?In the past six months, there has been a rise in the number of accidents on this stretch. Ten people have died, and the only reason is the deplorable condition of Diamond Harbour Road,? said Shakti Mandal, a member of the Behala Samannay Committee and a Trinamul Congress state committee general secretary. 

 ?If repair work is not completed by the Pujas, as had been assured by the public works department (PWD), we will indefinitely block Diamond Harbour Road after the festive season,? he said. 

 According to Mandal, the PWD had promised to complete repairing the potholed road before the Pujas, but the situation was getting worse by the day. The recent spell of hard rain had only made matters worse.

 ?Had the police done their bit, these accidents could have been averted, but they are not bothered,? Mandal said.

 South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta, however, claimed that the police were helpless, since there were not enough cops to watch over the entire stretch. 

 PWD minister Amar Chowdhuri was confident that the repair work would be completed before the deadline.

 Park Street, the citys original capital corridor of food and entertainment, is gearing up to woo the gourmand back with new stops and a motley menu.

 After the Bar-B-Q stable went One Step Up across the road, Blue Fox resurfaced with a bang and Oasis launched the fabled food streets first lounge, some big-hitting by the skipper and a five-star Chinese spread almost next door should keep Park Street well in the haandi hunt.

 Our aim is to bring fine dining back to Park Street, says Arup Mookerjee, director of Marco Polo. The continental-Indian combo on Sarat Bose Road is setting up its second outlet on the same premises (24 Park Street) that used to house Waldorf. Marco Polos 150-cover speciality Chinese restaurant, with Chinoisserie chef Marvyn Lee manning the wok, is expected to lay its tables before the Pujas.

 Just round the bend, at 20G Park Street, Souravs the signature venture of the Team India captain is padding up for Sashthi, with super-chef Ajit Xavier Gomes taking guard in the kitchen. We are creating a destination, not just another eatery on Park Street, promises ex-cricketer Sanjay Das, partnering Sourav in this innings. 

 The four-floor magnum opus floated by Abhishek Entertainment amp; Food Pvt Ltd has Maharajs friends Manoj Jhajharia and Ajay Jindal as directors.

 At a time when fine-dining outlets in the southern section of the city have raised the bar, both the reverse-flow entrants on Park Street pledge food and service quality thats notches above the general standard in the area.

 We cant afford to take the customer for granted in todays changing scenario. The average age of our staff will be 22-23 and they would live the credo of service with a smile. Setting standards in cuisine quality and a refreshing warmth for our discerning clientele would be our goals, stresses Mookerjee of Marco Polo.

 Quality of food and service will be the basic line and length at Souravs as well all across the 12,000-sq-ft footplate, opposite Peter Cat.

 With design solutions provided by Mumbai-based architect Kapil Bhalla, the captains deck will have different elements adorning its four levels. 

 The ground floor will house the lobby, signature souvenir shop and waiting lounge, while the first floor will hold an 85-seater coffee shop, christened One-Day.

 Overboundary, on the second floor, will seat 70-74 diners and serve non-vegetarian cross-country cuisine, with live interactive cooking counters.

 Maharaj, the 70-cover vegetarian Indian restaurant, will take up the third floor and the top level will have the 75-seater lounge bar, Prince of Cal.

 According to Bhalla, each floor aims to depict a particular facet of the skippers life through diverse architectural elements. 

 The coffee shop symbolises friendship and what he has achieved, Overboundary is about his growing pangs and experimental days, Maharaj is symbolic of family values, while Prince of Cal is on the fame and stardom theme, says the architect.

 But the real over-boundary could come from Marco Polo that is planning to roll out 10 outlets in the city over the next five years success on Park Street willing.

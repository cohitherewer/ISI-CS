 Shift in crime prime time

 - Salt Lake gangsters now move in early for the kill

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 A promoter and his henchmen raided a house in CF block on Sunday morning and beat up the residents.

 Dacoits raided a house in EC block on Tuesday morning and robbed jewellery worth more than Rs 3 lakh.

 Crime is once again on the rise in Salt Lake and this time, the criminals seem to have outwitted police by changing their time of operation.

 Most of the recent crimes in the township ? dacoity, snatching and theft ? are taking place in the early hours. The main targets are morning walkers, especially women walking alone.

 ?Dacoity and other crimes early in the morning is a new trend in Salt Lake. We are very worried about this,? Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, said on Friday. ?We are stepping up morning patrol, especially for the safety of morning walkers,? he added.

 Apart from big dacoities and day raids, there have been thefts and snatchings in Salt Lake between early morning and noon. 

 Recently, there have been two incidents in which goons have snatched gold chains from women morning walkers in CJ and CG blocks. 

 ?The goons, on bicycles, snatched the chains while riding past the women. Since there were very few people on the roads, they escaped easily,? said a police officer. 

 Police fear there will be more such incidents if the morning patrols are not intensified immediately.

 ?Dense fogs will provide perfect cover for criminals in the winter mornings,? said another police officer. ?Most residents of Salt Lake are affluent and hence, are targeted by criminals,? he added.

 Police superintendent Kumar said: ?We are advising morning walkers to move in groups. Lone walkers become easy preys for snatchers.? 

 When crimes in the evening were on the rise in Salt Lake, police had increased vigil on buildings and parks under construction. 

 A few years ago, nakabandi operations had been launched. As part of the drive, all entry and exit points in the township were closed for certain periods of time. 

 However, the operation has proved to be ineffective. ?Since the personnel deployed at the entry and exit points are not from Salt Lake police stations, they have no idea about the township?s topography,? explained an officer. 

 ?I once found out that policemen manning the EM Bypass-Chingrihata crossing are from Doltala police lines in Barasat, North 24-Parganas,? said Trinamul councillor Sabyasachi Dutta.

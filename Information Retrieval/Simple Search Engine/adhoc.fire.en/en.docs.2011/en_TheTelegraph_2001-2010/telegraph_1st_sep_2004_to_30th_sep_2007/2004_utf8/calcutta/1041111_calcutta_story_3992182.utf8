 Scary theme: The Kali puja pandal at Chetla 

Agrani Club has brought to life the jungle where sandalwood king Veerappan held 

sway. Picture by Pradip Sanyal 

Apropos the article ?Foul cry opens road-fix coffer?, 

October 13, the reaction of a section of state ministers, including the chief 

minister, to certain judicial pronouncements are both unfortunate and astounding. 

The chief minister would do well to introspect on why the judiciary is ?overstepping? 

at times and ?intruding into legislative and executive domains?. 

 Gross social injustice meted out by the government and its organs is prompting the court to act in such a manner. If the administration was free from corruption and partiality, and functioned in the proper manner, the judiciary would not have cared to issue the apparently intrusive orders. 

 From their indecently contemptuous comments, it does not appear that the urban development minister and the sports minister are law-abiding citizens. They, and their colleagues, would do well to remember that a sieve is not entitled to criticise a needle. 

 Through such irresponsible behaviour, they are only encouraging the lawless. 

Santosh Chakravarty,

Unique Park. 

Like water, trees are essential for life. Hence, indiscriminate cutting of trees is a serious offence. It is surprising that the forest department officials are unable to take action against people who are felling trees in the city (Axe drive for green cover, October 11). It is stated that there is no specific rule for punishing those committing such offences in the non-forest areas. Even the directives of Calcutta High Court against indiscriminate felling and trimming of trees are not being followed. This tendency to ignore court directives is dangerous for a democratic country. 

 The government must act immediately to ensure that the rules applicable for illegal cutting of trees in forest areas are also applicable in non-forest-areas. Rules should also be framed to the effect that even cutting of trees with a valid permission must be supervised by a forest department official. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

Behala. 

It is really sad that trees are being ruthlessly cut 

in the city without the forest department?s permission. It is even sadder that 

permissions are not even required. As trees are being felled in alarming numbers, 

it is high time the authorities took a stringent view while issuing clearance 

to the erring puja committees the next year. 

Piyal Mukherjee, 

Lake Town.

It was shocking to find out that some puja organisers 

and agencies are illegally felling and trimming trees in the city, without consulting 

the forest department officials. The report also states that the forest department 

officials have sent a note to the ministry expressing their helplessness. The 

offenders should be booked and punished in an exemplary manner. 

Sourish Mishra, 

Salt Lake.

Apropos the report ?College shut before debut?, October 13, the dubious character of the people at the helm of affairs in the state has become apparent with Calcutta University refusing to accord sanction to a private college despite the college having better infrastructure than government-aided colleges. It is strange that while on the one hand, the government is inviting private investors, it is clinging on to hackneyed ideas on the other. The decision might send wrong signals to prospective investors. 

Rabindranath Kar, 

College Street. 

Apropos the report ?Injured kid finds saviour in cop?, October 12, the officer from the Karaya police station did a commendable thing by rushing the two-year-old unconscious child with a broken hand and head injuries to the hospital. Police are often criticised unjustly by people who do not realise the kind of hazardous situations they have to work in. My salute to the officer who also gave his department?s reputation a boost. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

 Apropos the interview with Nandita Das (It?s all about reaching out, October 8), the actress has gained respect for her off-beat performances at a young age. While most of her ilk hanker for a place under the Bollywood sun, she has confidently chosen to stride off the beaten track and has shown rare courage in her choice of roles. 

Anil Kumar Sen,

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane. 

The article on Sanjit Ghosh, the puppeteer (Finger shift from puppet strings to Puja pulse, October 9) made for an interesting read. Ghosh?s creativity attracted lots of people to his pandals. 

Bhupen Bose,

Dum Dum Park.

 Apropos the article ?May the power be with you?, October 7, CESC?s CRES system offers a number of advantages. It saves time as consumers are not forced to stand in a queue to pay their bills. Also, interest is paid on credit balance at a rate higher than the bank rate. Moreover, consumers paying through CRES retain the right to challenge the bill. Unfortunately, the number of bank branches through which one can make such payment is inadequate. The facility should be made accessible everywhere. 

C.R. Bhattacharjee, 

 Lake Gardens.

 The photograph on October 7 of the chief minister lighting a pyre of seized animal body parts sent out the right signal. The forest department should carry out regular surveys to keep tabs on the situation. 

Sumant Poddar, 

Kyd Street.

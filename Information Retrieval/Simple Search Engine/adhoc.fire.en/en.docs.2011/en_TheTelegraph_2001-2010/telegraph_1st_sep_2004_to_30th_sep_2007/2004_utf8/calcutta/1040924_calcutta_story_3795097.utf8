 Children in bus collision

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Less than two months after 17 schoolchildren were injured when their bus overturned in Salt Lake, another school bus, this one of the Assembly of God Church School and carrying 10 children, collided with a private bus at EC island around 12.30 pm on Thursday. 

 The mishap spot was in front of Poura Bhavan and close to Indira Bhavan, where Jyoti Basu lives. 

 Meenakshi Kumar, a Class II student, suffered a head injury. The rest, all students of the school?s junior section, had a narrow escape.

 This is the sixth accident in the past couple of months in Salt Lake. Five persons, including a child, have been killed in the mishaps. 

 Police said the school bus entered Salt Lake from the EM Bypass, and after taking a left from Central Park, sped towards EC island. The private bus on route 44A was on its way to Labony when both collided.

 ?I heard a deafening sound and the noise of shattering glass,? said a student. The schoolbus windshield was in smithereens and the shards were all over the road. Injured Meenakshi was taken to a local hospital.

 The driver of the private bus escaped but both vehicles were impounded. ?I have asked Bidhannagar police to probe why accidents are occurring on that spot and how to prevent them,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

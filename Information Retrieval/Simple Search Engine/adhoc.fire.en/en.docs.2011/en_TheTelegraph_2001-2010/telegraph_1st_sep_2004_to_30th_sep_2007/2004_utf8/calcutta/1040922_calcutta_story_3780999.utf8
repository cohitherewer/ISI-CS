The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Durga in land of dragon people

 - 30 Bengalis in Saigon band together for Puja, adda, shingara and rolls

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 How many Bengalis does it take to start a Durga Puja? Thirty, if it?s in Ho Chi Minh City.

 Their numbers having hit a record high, 30 Bengalis in Saigon, Vietnam, have decided to bring Durga home to the land of the dragon people.

 Till now, Puja time in home away from home just meant lots of adda amidst noodles and soup. But the community always longed for the real festive feel, spiced up with shingara and rolls. And that?s exactly what will be served up this October.

 ?We were looking for a critical mass of like-minded people to start a Durgotsav here,? Ayan Ghosh, one of the organisers of the Saigon Durgotsav, told Metro.

 The festivities in Ho Chi Minh City will find a structured form for the first time next month (see box). But the formality is up to a point. ?We do not want to create a formal association. We have loosely divided the responsibilities among ourselves, as this durgotsav is a private function within a circle of friends,? clarifies Ghosh.

 ?It will be more a social event than a religious one, and we are glad to have participation from Bangladeshi Muslims as well as non-Bengalis who have connections with Calcutta or Bengal,? he adds.

 The Puja pushers, all within the age-group of 30 to 45 and residents of Saigon for anything between a few years to 11, had started planning from August this year. And started planning big (read: khichuri bhog for lunch on Ashtami).

 ?Unfortunately that bit had to be scrapped, as we got no cooks to volunteer,? admits Ghosh. ?But we are planning to go the whole hog with pan-Indian food, while stressing on Calcutta junk specials like chaat, shingara and rolls.?

 And what?s a probashi Puja without a tryst with Tagore, a bit of Bollywood and touch of Tollywood? A combination of recitation, song and dance from Rabindranath?s Bichitra is on the cards, along with private screenings of Munnabhai MBBS and Banchharamer Bagan. The movies were picked by a ?democratic choice of 20-odd people? during the vociferous Puja planning sessions.

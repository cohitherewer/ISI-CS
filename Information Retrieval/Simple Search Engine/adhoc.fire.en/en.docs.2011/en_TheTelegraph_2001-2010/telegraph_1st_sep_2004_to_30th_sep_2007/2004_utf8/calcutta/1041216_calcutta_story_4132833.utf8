 Red faces, pledges for quota bloc

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Medical students facing the axe following a Supreme Court order continued with their agitation on Wednesday, even as the state government explored ways to enrol them in alternative courses.

 While students at Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (SSKM Hospital campus) were into the second day of their indefinite hunger strike, those at Midnapore Medical College boycotted classes and held demonstrations. 

 Giving a twist to the controversy, Indranil Saha, students? union general secretary of the SSKM campus institute, claimed only 16 of the 69 candidates to be ousted were admitted by the NRI quota. The rest of the 99 MBBS students at the two institutes were taken in by the management quota. 

 ?According to the entrance exam admit cards, issued by the directorate of medical education, none of us was admitted under the NRI quota and only 16 are NRI-sponsored,? Saha said.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted that the government had a ?moral responsibility? towards the NRI-quota students. ?We tried our best for them and employed the best lawyer. I even consulted Siddhartha Shankar Ray. But the Supreme Court remained unconvinced,? he said.

 Bhattacharjee added he was in touch with the parents of the students and ?shared their agony?, but reiterated that the Supreme Court order must beimplemented. 

 Holding out an assurance for the students, he said the government would try to do something for them: ?I am on the job.? The students and their parents appealed to President Abul Kalam Azad again on Wednesday.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said the government would refund the fees paid by the 69 students. Advertisements will be issued to fill the vacant seats from among those on the Joint Entrance Exam 2003 merit list. 

 Both Bhattacharjee and Mishra claimed they were discussing with the higher education department how the axed students could be accommodated in other courses.

 The West Bengal University of Health Sciences, however, is in a fix over the fresh admissions. According to Medical Council of India rules, no MBBS student can be admitted after September 30. 

 ?There will be problems ahead for the 69 new students, as the first semester exams start on January 6,? pointed out Prabir Kumar Sur, director of the SSKM campus institute.

 Entry is already restricted in government hospitals. There is a card system which allows only two visitors in at a time. We are telling the authorities to implement the system as strictly as possible. But there has to be awareness among the people. We cannot hold a mass meeting to announce such things. Unnecessary entry of people means infection as well as disturbance. The nursing homes cater to a specific class of people and the number of their patients is also far lower. We cannot impose the same system as them. We are transparent, but people should not take advantage of that. When doctors and nurses are working, they need the environment to work. If relatives of a patient come in a big group and start an argument or a brawl with a doctor, he gets disturbed. The crowd does not think of the other 49 patients he is in charge of. It is sad that such things happen even after 57 years of our Independence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On Sashti you can be at... Gandhi Ghat

DEVADEEP PUROHIT

A tomb in the memory of Mahatma Gandhi, a lush green 

garden dotted with 120 varieties of roses, exquisite plants and trees, a picturesque 

sunset and an exciting riverfront ? the Gandhi Ghat package is good enough to 

entice you to break free from crowded Calcutta and set off for Barrackpore, around 

30 km from the heart of the city. 

Built in 1948 (the year the father of the nation died), 

the monument on the banks of the river Hooghly and the sprawling garden, Jawahar 

Kunj ? maintained by the state forest department ? can offer a day?s respite to 

city-dwellers, reeling under Durga Puja pressure. 

The breeze from the river and the shades of banyan, 

krishnachuda, akashmoni, ashok, neem and other trees create a perfect setting 

for idling on an autumn afternoon, with birds chirping cheerily in the background. 

Swimmers can have a splash in the water as well. 

Leave the greens behind as the sun heads westward. 

The riverfront is a perfect photzo-op, with the sun setting over Bengal?s once 

glorious industrial history. The jute mills, dating back to the Raj, on either 

side of the river, may have long shut down, but the chimneys still stand tall 

to tell the tale. 

Gandhi Ghat is still one of the most important spots 

on the North-24 Parganas map. Thrice a year ? August 15, January 26 and October 

2 ? the Governor hoists the Tricolour at this location.

History apart, horticulture is the biggest attraction 

here. Tickets are Rs 5 per head, while picnickers cough up Rs 100 to book a kitchen. 

The nurseries produce a dazzling array of roses ? boasting over 120 varieties 

? and a host of other species, ranging from daliah to chandramallika, 

which find pride of place at Raj Bhavan and Eden Gardens.

Families planning a picnic with kids, friends in search 

of a venue for their all-day adda session, elderly folk interested in a 

calm and quiet day out, the spacious spot would melt just about every mood.

Besides Gandhi Ghat, there are a few other attractions 

in the area that include Mangal Pandey Garden, off Barrack Road, and Rani Rashmoni 

temple, near Brahmasthan (Bada Mastan for residents).

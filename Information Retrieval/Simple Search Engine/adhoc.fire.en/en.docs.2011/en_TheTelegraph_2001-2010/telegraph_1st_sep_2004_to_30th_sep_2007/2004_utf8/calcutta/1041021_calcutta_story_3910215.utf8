LO-CAL

By 

Derek O?Brien

Welcome to a week-old column! You will enjoy this if you are a Calcuttan 

(there can never be a ?Kolkatan?!). You don?t have to be a quiz junkie to relish 

this column. We will bring you nuggets of our favourite city under any of the 

?Cal? categories each week. So there could be Gastronomi-Cal, Histori-Cal, Topi-Cal, 

Comi-Cal, Physi-Cal, Typi-Cal, Politi-Cal, or even Lexi-Cal. This week, it?s a 

Puja special! Let?s get Mysti-Cal.

QUESTIONS

1. Try this question to see how much you know about Durga 

Puja. Usually, Sandhi Puja is held between which two of the Durga Puja days?

2. Now something offbeat. Who started the tradition of Kumari 

Puja at the Ramakrishna Mission headquarters at Belur Math? 

3. Here?s an easy one. Traditionally, Kola Bou is regarded 

as the wife of which of the gods? 

4. Let?s put you into the puja mood. Who is believed to have 

started the tradition of Akal Bodhan, the worshipping of Goddess Durga during 

this time of the year, autumn? 

5. Every year Ma Durga visits us on a different vehicle. 

What is she riding this year? 

6. A little bit of history. It is believed that the Durga 

Puja held at Sovabazar Rajbati in north Calcutta was initially held to celebrate 

which historic event? 

 Topi-Cal

The puja of the Chander family in Thanthania, north Calcutta, began 

almost 200 years ago. It started at the Chander family?s ancestral house in Chandernagore 

but later shifted to Calcutta when the family moved to the city. The idol used 

in the Chander family?s puja is also unique. Here, Ma Durga has only two arms. 

She is depicted as sitting on Lord Shiva?s lap, without the asura. It is meant 

to represent the tolerant and benign aspects of Hinduism. 

ANSWERS

1.Ashtami and Navami, 2. Swami Vivekananda, 3. Ganesh, 4. Lord Ram, 

5. A boat, 6. Lord Clive?s victory at Plassey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 What We are Watching

 Holly - Bolly / Cross-over films

 A still from Mahesh Dattani?s film

 Morning Raga (A) 

 A train accident connects three characters. The petite Perizaad stands out in some scenes. But the seasoned Shabana is as good as she gets.

 Catch it at Inox (Forum) 12.15 pm, 6.45 pm; City Centre: 12.50 pm, 5.05 pm

 Flop factor: The Raga saga does not seem to have gone down very well with the audiences. The first week saw an average collection of 62 per cent at Forum. The lukewarm response is no good news for the times ahead.

Taste of Punjab 

 Bride amp; Prejudice (U)

 This Gurinder Chaddha movie might face competition when Yash Chopra comes up with his cross-border saga Veer Zaara on November 12. But till then it is going balle balle. 

 Catch it at Inox (Forum) 12.15 pm, 6.45 pm; City Centre: 12.50 pm, 5.05 pm

 Success story: Almost everyone seems to be going berserk about this bimbette bride. Forum, with 80 per cent collection in the last weekend, is still upbeat but City Centre (51 per cent collection) seems to be getting bored.

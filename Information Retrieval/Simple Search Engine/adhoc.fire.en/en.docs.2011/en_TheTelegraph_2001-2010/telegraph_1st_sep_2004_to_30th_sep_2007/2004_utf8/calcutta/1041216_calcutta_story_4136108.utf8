The Calcutta Public Library was established in 1836 as a private institution. 

The Imperial Library was formed in 1891 by merging a number of Secretariat libraries, 

including the library of the home department. Later, Lord Curzon caused the amalgamation 

of Calcutta Public Library with the Imperial Library. This new entity retained 

the name of Imperial Library and was formally opened to the public on January 

30, 1903. After Independence, the Government of India renamed the Imperial Library 

as the National Library. On February 1, 1953 the National Library was inaugurated 

by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 Take up a challenge if you feel you are in the 

right. Use your communication skills and reach out to people. A friendship may 

cost a lot, either financially or emotionally. A property deal can go well. Shed 

inhibitions. You are short-tempered. Avoid tendency to drift, cultivate stability.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The seats on the left half of the entire length of the newly introduced Bharat 

Stage II private buses are reserved for women. On the right, some are reserved 

for senior citizens and handicapped people. As a result, the number of seats for 

male passengers has reduced considerably though they constitute more than 70 per 

cent of the total number of passengers. Sometimes, women passengers insist that 

men don?t sit next to them even if the seat is vacant. Seats should be reserved 

only after scientifically surveying the average number of male and female passengers 

who travel by bus.

 Meat and chicken shops should not be allowed near schools and hospitals. Young 

children are often disturbed at the sight of animals being slaughtered in the 

open on their way to school. Some patients feel scared while some others tend 

to develop nausea at the sight of blood near hospitals. The slaughtering of animals 

and display of meat in the open is also very unhygienic. Usually, the meat shops 

dump unwanted chunks of meat, feathers, bones and other wastes on the roadside 

itself. This makes the surrounding area very dirty. Will the authorities do something 

about it?

 A letterbox is urgently required near Senpara or Bhattacharjeepara on Garfa 

Main Road. The postal code in the area is 700075. Old and disabled persons are 

facing much difficulty in posting letters, especially when the weather is unpleasant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 So, patients prefer to flee

 KINSUK BASU

 Escape to freedom, some say.

 Patients admitted to government hospitals seem to just wait for an opportunity to run away from, what most consider, the dungeon. Police records say at least 13 patients ?absconded? from NRS Medical College and Hospital between September 29 and October 2. 

 As for other government hospitals, here?s a peek.

 At RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, going by the authorities? admission, at least two to three patients run away every alternate day. In other hospitals, including Medical College and National Medical College, a guarded response from the top brass suggests at least two patients ?abscond? every month.

 ?We mostly refer the cases to the missing persons squad at Lalbazar, from where the police stations concerned are informed. Our job ends there. The onus then shifts to the relatives,? said Samir Gupta, officer-in-charge of Bowbazar police station. 

 But why do patients choose to flee hospitals? A survey pinned on three probable reasons: 

Most patients cannot put up with the delay in treatment, characteristic of any 

tertiary-level government hospital

Quite a few feel frustrated to know that their near and dear ones have actually 

dumped them in the name of providing them treatment 

A minuscule percentage flee to evade the hospital fees. 

 ?No one can deny that our hospitals are in a pathetic condition. On several occasions, we are forced to leave an orthopaedic patient on the floor. And unless he is put on a bed, he cannot be put on traction,? said Pradip Mitra, superintendent of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. ?This delays the entire process, resulting in frustration and despair among the patients.?

 Citing instances, a doctor said that in the hospital?s 44-bed labour ward, the authorities are often forced to admit around 175 patients at a time. 

 ?The ward is so overcrowded that you can?t even walk. An identical situation prevails at almost all major departments, including medicine and surgery,? he added. 

 There are other problems, too. ?The problem of high expectation. Besides, a communication gap develops when a doctor fails to explain the ailment to the patient. Unable to make out anything, the patient simply decides to leave hospital,? explained Dr Mrityunjoy Mukherjee, superintendent of National Medical College and Hospital. 

 Isn?t it a failure of the state healthcare system if patients leave hospitals frustrated? 

 ?We really can?t help that. Every government hospital is over-burdened with problems. If this sparks off frustration, who are we to offer solace? Do you know under what conditions we work?? asked Dr Amendra Biswas, deputy superintendent of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.

 Nobel scare brings in the jawans 

 - Indian Museum eyes CISF security on campus

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The security of Indian Museum, till now looked after by in-house guards, will be assigned to a central force.

 The Union department of culture has decided to deploy Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawans on the museum campus to prevent a repeat of the Nobel medal burglary in Santiniketan. 

 Museum director Shaktikali Basu said on Friday that the modalities of engaging the CISF will be worked out on December 5 and 6, when a committee set up by the culture department meets to consider various proposals on beefing up security on the JL Nehru Road premises.

 Ever since the Nobel burglary, the culture department has been examining a number of options on strengthening the security of various museums across the country. 

 Governor Viren J. Shah, too, had suggested that the CISF be entrusted with the responsibility of Indian Museum?s security. Shah, chairman of the museum?s trustee board, had also constituted a committee in June to review the security arrangements on campus. 

 Apart from its decision to engage the CISF, the Centre has also sanctioned Rs 1.5 crore for purchasing equipment required for boosting security, director Basu said. 

 The money, he added, will be utilised for replacing a number of age-old smoke detectors and closed-circuit TVs installed in the galleries a few years ago.

 ?We have in our possession precious objects like Noor Jahan?s goblet. It is displayed in a glass case. We are planning to instal an infra-red censor on the case. An alarm bell will ring if anyone touches the case,? said a senior museum official.

 Another official said the authorities could not display more than four per cent of their exhibits because of inadequate safety arrangements and lack of space. Most of the 60 galleries are closed. ?It is really difficult to run the show with the existing security set-up,? admitted director Basu.

 It is learnt that the director-general of National Museum, Delhi, K.K. Chakraborty, had visited Indian Museum recently and suggested to the authorities that security be beefed up so that more exhibits could be displayed.

 What is also worrying the authorities is the fact that the museum complex is shared by various other offices, like the Geological Survey of India, Zoological Survey of India and the Anthropological Survey of India. The authorities consider this a security threat.

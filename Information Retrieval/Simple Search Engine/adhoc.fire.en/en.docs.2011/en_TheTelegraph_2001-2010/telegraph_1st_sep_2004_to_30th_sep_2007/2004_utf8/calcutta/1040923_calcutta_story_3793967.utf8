The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From frills to thrills

Time to bid farewell to Shaina, Kunal and dear ol? 

Ramola Shikand. Yes, after an eventful three-year run, Star Plus?s late-night 

soap Kaahin Kissii Roz is going off air from Monday, September 27. Replacing 

it will be Balaji K-Factory?s first attempt at a no-holds-barred thriller K. 

Street Pali Hill (picture of the main cast left, by Aranya Sen).

 So why this sudden switch from the tried-and-tested formula of mushy family fare? ?After a whole lot of research and surveys, we found that the late-night slots generate a lot of male viewership,? said Shailja Kejriwal, creative director, content and communication, Star India, in town to promote the new serial.

 K. Street Pali Hill, however, does have the family saga hangover. It is about three friends and their extended families who live together in this huge mansion. They also happen to be one of the biggest business houses in the country. But they have a past, which comes to haunt them and ruin their sukhi parivar.

 The launch of this new K-soap will also see a programming innovation of sorts. Sujal and Kashish, popular characters from another Balaji hit Kaahin To Hoga (aired at 11 pm from Monday to Thursday), will attend a big bash at the K. Street Pali Hill mansion to introduce the characters and launch the serial.

 ?About a year back, we tried something on these lines. To celebrate one year of Kasautii Zindagi Kay and Des Mein Nikla Hoga Chand, we got one character of Kasautii? married to one character of Des Mein?. The particular one-and-a-half hour episode was a huge hit and we got TRP ratings of 14 ? which is quite incredible,? said Shailja.

 K. Street Pali Hill brings together some of the more familiar faces on the small screen. The three friends are played by Riitu Raaj (with a new numerological spelling), Aly Khan and Vikram Kapadia. There is also a very seasoned supporting cast and an electronic background score by Viju Shah.

 According to the core team at Star television, Calcutta is one of the main target regions for K. Street Pali Hill, with Kaahin Kissii Roz doing the best ?business? in this part of the country. So it?s not surprising that Aly?s character of Arindam Keshab in the serial loves to listen to Rabindrasangeet and has a Bengali wife named Deboshree.

 Pot Puri: Bollywood king and I

 It took him more than two decades, a British supermodel as heroine and an adman as film-maker to become Bollywood?s quintessential hero. And to say Om Puri has really enjoyed being the larger-than-life King of Bollywood ? hitting halls this Friday ? is an understatement.

 ?I have played the hero in a lot of art films. But there they call you the main character or the main role. Apart from China Gate, which also wasn?t a typical commercial film, I haven?t played the hero in Bollywood. But in this film I do everything from singing and dancing to throwing tantrums,? he says.

 And Puri is happy with the way the film has shaped up. ?It is a fun satire which is very human. It is in the same spirit as Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron. The film is a real depiction of incidents in Bollywood, just the treatment is exaggerated. It is in the same genre of Nagesh Kukunoor?s Bollywood Calling (which also featured Puri), but with a much bigger budget. We shot 80 per cent of the film in London and the rest in India.?

 The thespian who has now championed the balancing act between mainstream and off-beat cinema, between Indian and British films, is a lot less angry with the Indian industry these days. ?There was a time when I used to grumble that why can?t these art film-makers take us in the lead when they make commercial films. But then Naseer (Naseeruddin Shah) and me were discussing the other day that let them take anyone they want. After all, they also want to earn money. They have to give the main role to so-and-so Khan. But at least give us more money for the small roles we do in commercial films!?

 Puri makes no bones about the fact that he does commercial Bollywood films for the booty alone. ?For my first major film Arohan I got Rs 10,000, for Akrosh 9,000 and for Ardh Satya 25,000? I don?t come from a rich family. While I don?t want to be indulgent, I do need decent comforts ? a car, good schooling for my child, some savings for my old age. So I have to do these commercial films just for the money.?

 Even for his last big-budget commercial venture Dev, Puri had asked his Ardh Satya director Govind Nihalani for a fatter pay pack. ?I told Govind, ?don?t treat it like a Drohkaal; I know Amitabh Bachchan is not taking his usual remuneration, but you can give me a good amount for this film?. Which he did.?

 Puri hasn?t even seen Dev yet but knew during the making that everything wasn?t smooth sailing. ?I was not convinced with my character. If the parents of the victim have reconciled, who am I as a friend to remain an intense hater? Also, the part where Fardeen comes to my house after all that I have done to him? I asked Govind about these loopholes but he didn?t have answers to my questions.?

 Puri believes that art film-makers ?become a little more adjusting, a little more caring for the stars in their films? when engaged in mainstream fare. ?When it?s an art film with people like us, all that (nice chairs and clean sheets in the make-up room) does not apply.?

 After King of Bollywood, Puri has just one English film lined up ? Hangman. ?Shot in Pune and Mumbai, the film is being produced by an NRI group. I play a hangman who has been in the profession for a long time and wants to quit but is not being allowed to do so. When the Dhananjoy hanging happened in Calcutta, we were dubbing for the film. I tried to incorporate the bit of smoothening the rope with ripe banana. But it was too late ? in the film they use wax.?

 Puri?s recent cervical surgery (?same as what Shah Rukh Khan went through?) has upset his schedule a bit. ?I had to refuse a lot of offers from the West because of their long hours. I signed a few films in Mumbai because I knew the situation could be handled here. I am doing two Priyadarshan films and he has promised me that the roles will be bigger than the one in Hera Pheri. I am also doing a Punjabi film to be shot in Vancouver and another small film based on a Munshi Premchand story. That?s the plan for the next three months. I never plan beyond that hoping that something bigger and better may come up after that.?

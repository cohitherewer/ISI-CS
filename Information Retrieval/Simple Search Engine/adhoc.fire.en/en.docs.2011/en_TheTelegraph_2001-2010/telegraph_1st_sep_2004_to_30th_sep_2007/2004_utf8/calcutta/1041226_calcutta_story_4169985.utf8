The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Catch the clockwork

There 

is this ad that is currently trying to capture our attention. It is from a watchmaker 

and it says ?not everyone who wears it wants to know the time? ? or words to that 

effect. When you come across the ad for the first time, you stop to take note. 

At least I did.

 No, it was not because I found the copy striking. The real reason was that it took me a while to take in the meaning of what was being said.

 And I agreed with it vehemently and instantaneously. I have worn a wristwatch almost every single day in the last 35 years. My best estimate is that I have needed to know the time from my watch about twice every fortnight or even less often.

 Indeed, come to think of it, it will be difficult 

to think of a better example of a mismatch between an opportunity and its use. 

Why then do people wear a wristwatch? It is pretty obvious that time keeping is 

not the most relevant answer. 

 I remember getting my first watch when I was all of 

14. Wearing a watch on my wrist was then a sign of adulthood. That is how, I suspect, 

the habit starts ? much like smoking. And then it gets into the bloodstream.

 Presumably, wearing a wristwatch has continued to 

be a symbol of the urban gentry. That in itself is an interesting proposition.

In these days of laptops and leather cases, cell phones 

and credit cards, adult men and women find it necessary to wear their wristwatches 

day after day, morning after morning just to tell the other watch-wearing brethren, 

?Hey, you and I belong to the same class.?

 Talking about cell phones reminds me that each of these contraptions has a built-in clock. Most of them display their timekeeping effort very visibly. We wear our watch on the wrist and a few feet away in our palms hold our beloved cell phone. Why do we all need two time keepers working simultaneously for us?

 Or am I missing the point? Of course I am. It never crossed my mind that it is not wearing a watch, but it is wearing the watch. That is the main issue. What kind of watch are you wearing? Is it black dial or white, is it analogue only or dual display, waterproof or ordinary? Which brand is it, Cartier or Longines, Titan or Timex?

 It is this display value of a wristwatch that seems to be the crucial differentiator. Even the campaign that we started this column with says ?not everyone wants to know the time?. The real reason then is to make a statement. I, so and so, can afford a slim Longines. I, so and so, have the money and the taste to wear a black dial Movado. Fair point.

 There is, however, one issue the wristwatch industry has not yet addressed. Perhaps its best description would be the ?just married bahurani? syndrome. Your wristwatch is the dulhan. Your shirt-sleeve is her ghunghat. How do you make that all-important statement about yourself through your watch? 

 Even assuming you have managed to steal a glance at someone else?s watch ? chances are all you can say is it?s a nice looking watch. The brand name is seldom readable (the font is so small). How about imparting some magnifying power to the watch glass and thus to your personality?

 Watchmakers beware, there is a royalty involved!

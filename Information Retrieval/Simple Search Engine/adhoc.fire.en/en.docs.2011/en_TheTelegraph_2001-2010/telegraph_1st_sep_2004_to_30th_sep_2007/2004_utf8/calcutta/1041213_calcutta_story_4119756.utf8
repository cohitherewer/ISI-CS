The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Winter high on winsome spread 

 - Bollywood comedy, Hollywood caper rule in weekend multiplex rush

 Akshaye and Kareena in Hulchul: Triumph trail

 Akshaye Khanna, George Clooney, Dilip Kumar, Sanjay Dutt, Garfield the cat, Oscar the fish? and Sachin Tendulkar.

 On big screen and small, the weekend saw Calcutta scrambling to catch some of the biggest or some of the unlikeliest heroes, celluloid and sporting.

 If the cable network dispute batted half the city out of the India-Bangladesh Test match, the multi-course movie spread on offer pushed multiplex collections over the weekend to a cool winter high.

 New Hollywood (Ocean?s 12), comic Bollywood (Hulchul), action Bollywood (Musafir), old Bollywood (Mughal-e-Azam), animated Hollywood (Shark Tale and Garfield) have all ganged up to keep ushers on their toes, Friday through Sunday.

 ?Almost all weekend shows of Hulchul have run house full. Musafir has been the second most watched film with a weekend aggregate of 85 per cent, while Veer-Zaara grossed 80 per cent. Mughal-e-Azam (65 per cent) is continuing to pull in the crowds. Rok Sako To Rok Lo has had a thanda start for a new release,? an INOX spokesperson told Metro on Sunday.

 Kids have captured a corner of the collections, thanks to Garfield and Oscar. ?Even if it?s a solitary show in the morning, the kids are still queuing up to watch Garfield,? said Prashant Sachdeva, general manager of 89 Cinemas. The Swabhumi multiplex has also recorded a healthy weekend rush.

But the clear winner is Bollywood and the surprise 

frontrunner is Priyadarshan?s laugh riot Hulchul.

 Now, into its third week, the Akshaye-Kareena starrer has raked in more in the past three days than Sanjay Gupta?s stylish road film Musafir and Arindam Chaudhuri?s college caper Rok Sako To Rok Lo. Keeping it company at the top, along with Veer-Zaara, is the K. Asif classic Mughal-e-Azam.

 And both Mughal-e-Azam and Hulchul are playing that extra innings to ensure total recall. Buoyed by collections, both have added new portions to the family films. If the Madhubala-in-shackles song Mohabbat ki jhoothi kahaani? has been added to the all colour Mughal-e-Azam, Hulchul has herded in an extra comic sequence featuring Akshaye and Paresh Rawal.

 ?In the recent past, Akshaye and Kareena films haven?t worked at the box-office. So Priyadarshan didn?t want to take a chance and kept out that additional scene at the editing table. Now that the film is a super hit, we have more laughter in store for the audiences,? said a spokesperson for Hulchul.

 Trade analyst Taran Adarsh is quick to spot the year-end Bollywood surge. ?Almost all films since Diwali have clicked and that is very healthy for the film industry on the whole. And with potential winners like Swades and Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo coming up, 2004 should end on a high,? Adarsh told Metro.

 From distant Hollywood shores, Ocean?s 12 is keeping the flag flying high with 90 per cent ticket sales in the opening weekend at INOX.

 The sequel to the Steven Soderbergh blockbuster brings together a never-before star cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones. And it is calling in students and young professionals by the droves.

 Unlike the ocean gang, the other two sequels, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason and Resident Evil: Apocalypse, have faded fast.

 But with the festive fortnight coming up, Shah Rukh Khan invading town with sight (Swades) and sound (Hum Hai Lajawab), and Raincoat ready to unfold with Ash and Ajay, December could be Calcutta?s happiest movie month this year.

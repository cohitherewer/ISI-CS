The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Anything for space to drive

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should offices and schools make the car pool system mandatory to lower vehicle count on the streets? More letters will be published next week

 Chock-a-block: A crowded city street 

SUBHANKAR MUKHERJEE,

 Burdwan

 Utilisation of cars should be prioritised to reduce the number of cars on the road. A mandatory car pool system would be helpful in this regard. Given that environmental pollution is a menace today, car pool for both schools and offices would be a great idea. 

T.R. ANAND,

Budge Budge

It would be a welcome move to make the car pool system 

mandatory for office-goers and schoolchildren. This will help prevent spill-over 

of vehicles and traffic snarls on the streets. It is time that the authorities 

concerned looked into the viability of the implementation of such a system. May 

be the mayor could issue a directive favouring the system and see to it that his 

dictum is followed immediately by people. 

JOYDIP SUR, 

 CIT Road 

 Calcutta?s heavy traffic and the problems associated with it have always played spoilsport for me ? right from the day of my first board examination to my first day in college. I am sure it inconveniences many others as well. If making the car pool system mandatory for school students and office-goers can provide a solution to this problem, then I am all for its implementation without delay. 

DIPTIMOY GHOSH,

 Salt Lake

 A mandatory car pool system may be a plausible idea but definitely not a practical one. All schools and offices do not have adequate resources required to maintain their own car pools. Car pools may lower the vehicle count on the streets to some extent, but for people who are used to availing of public transport, this system, if made compulsory, might prove tough on the purse.

ARUNAVA BOSE CHOWDHURY,

 Barrackpore 

 If implemented, a mandatory car pool system would cause problems in schools and offices which do not have adequate space for cars. So, the car pool system should be made compulsory for only those establishments which have enough space to accommodate their cars. 

NAVIN GHOSE, 

Sodepur 

Starting a car pool system in offices and schools 

may only negligibly lessen vehicle count on the streets since the number of cars 

used by offices and schools forms merely a fraction of the alarming population 

of cars in the city. So, I would call implementation of such an idea nothing more 

than a bunkum option. 

SOUNAK CHAKRABORTY,

 Baranagar

 Office-goers and schoolchildren may be ordered to use the car pool system but care should be taken so that these vehicles follow proper traffic safety rules laid down by government agencies. One rule that could be implemented for the car pool system in schools and offices is to paste an ?On duty? sticker imperatively in front of every vehicle. Our law-enforcers should keep an eye out for these. 

UDITA SEN, 

 Diamond Harbour Road

 If offices and schools make the car pool system mandatory, I don?t see how it will actually lower the vehicle count on the streets. What about lawyers, businessmen, doctors, self-employed entrepreneurs and college-goers? If such a system is enforced, it will adversely affect the interests of the owners of other forms of public transport who rely on the rush at peak hours for their livelihood. Most Calcuttans will not be able to afford the fare of a car pool on a daily basis. 

PRIYANKA AICH, 

 Jadavpur 

 Carpools would reduce the staggering number of vehicles on the roads, thereby drastically cutting down on traffic jams and noise pollution apart from helping conserve our fuel reserves. But for the car pool system to be successful, the participants need to have a common destination as well as perfectly co-ordinated timings, both of which are rare here. 

SAYAN BANERJEE, 

 Belgachhia Road 

 The car pool system, if made mandatory, might not be a welcome option for all, but it might find a considerable number of takers. This will surely lower the car-count on the streets, which will not only enhance commuting convenience, but will also lower the number of accidents on the streets. 

SUSHMA JALAN,

 Alipore

 With the steep rise in petrol prices and traffic jams due to an increase in the number of vehicles on the streets, making the car pool system mandatory in schools and offices is a good idea. By doing so, not only will it be possible to save fuel, we will also be saving our environment from pollution. 

PURNIMA VASUDEVA, 

 Rowland Road 

 The car pool system will lessen the vehicle count on the streets and enable people to save on fuel cost. This will also help them to reach their destinations on time.

KAUSHIK GUHA, 

 SN Roy Road 

 Road space in Calcutta is a lot less than desired. The number of vehicles on the streets is ever-increasing. Though people cannot be stopped from buying new cars, car-owners can be encouraged to use their cars as little as possible. If offices and schools make the car pool system mandatory, it will be beneficial for all. The problem of traffic jams may be solved while environmental pollution will be reduced as well.

RANADIP GANGULY, 

 Diamond Park

 Offices and schools should make the car pool system compulsory for better time management. In doing so, the day-to-day hassles, like non-availability of buses on the respective routes or over-crowding in public buses, can be avoided.

RAKHI CHAKRABORTY,

 Address not given

 Often children and office-goers end up late for school and office because of public transport trouble. This leads to a lot of confusion and disorder. If the car pool system is made mandatory, apart from pollution being reduced, punctuality will also become a way of life.

MOUMA CHAKRABORTY,

Sheoraphuli 

 Apart from lowering the vehicle count on the streets, a compulsory car pool system for schoolchildren and office-goers will ensure free flow of traffic, reduce the number of accidents and bring down air pollution. It will be easier on commuters? purses as well.

PIYAL MUKHERJEE,

 Lake Town

 The ever-increasing level of vehicular traffic in the city poses a serious threat to the smooth flow of traffic as the road space is limited in comparison to the other metropolises. To overcome this difficulty, the introduction of car pool system should be mandatory.

ANANDADIP CHOWDHURY,

 Baguiati 

In Calcutta, the prime reason behind traffic snarls 

is the illegal parking of cars. As most offices and schools do not have any space 

reserved for car parking, owners of vehicles are forced to park their cars right 

on the streets which inconveniences pedestrians no end.The government should pass 

an order such that offices and schools are asked to reserve space for car parking 

and defaulters are penalised. 

RIMLI DATTA,

Salt Lake

If schools and offices make the car pool system mandatory, 

it will definitely reduce the number of vehicles plying on the roads. If such 

a system comes into play, there will be no more dependence on crowded buses which 

follow erratic schedules, inconveniencing everyone. 

NINA TALUKDAR, 

 Golpark

 Car pools for offices and schools could solve the problem of regulation of the growing number of vehicles on the roads, unending traffic snarls, wastage of fuel, deteriorating condition of the roads, air pollution leading to health hazards etc. If everybody is aware of today?s problems, a mandatory car pool system should definitely be popular.

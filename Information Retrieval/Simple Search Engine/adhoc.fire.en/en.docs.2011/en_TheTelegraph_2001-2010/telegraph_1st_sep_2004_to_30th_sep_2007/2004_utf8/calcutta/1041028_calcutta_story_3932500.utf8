 Mystery blast baffles township

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An explosion rocked Salt Lake?s KB block early on Wednesday, leaving the residents tense and police puzzled. The blast, which occurred around 1.30 am, shattered the windowpanes of two flats in separate buildings.

 ?Nothing could be seen when the blast occurred as there was a thick blanket of smoke all around. Later, a dark patch could be seen on the asphalt of the road in front of the buildings,? recounted Ganesh Das, a night guard.

 Das had been sleeping in a garage opposite the Central Government GP Quarters, that houses B-type flats and a football ground.

 This follows the June blast in IB block that had blown away the door of an apartment and shattered windowpanes in the vicinity. A forensic team later blamed the blast on the compressor of a refrigerator in the apartment but no conclusive evidence was found.

 On Wednesday morning, officials from Bidhannagar (South) police station collected fragments from the explosion for forensic examination. While examining the site, officials noticed a large number of iron fragments and jute fibres strewn around. 

 ?It was more than just a firecracker. It appears the explosion was aimed at creating a sense of panic rather than causing serious damage,? said C.R. Mondal, officer-in-charge, Bidhannagar (South) police station. The area was cordoned off for some time. 

 Security has been tightened in the area, which is home to senior administrative officials and police. Watchmen have been alerted and asked to keep an eye on outsiders.

 The explosion has rattled the residents of the township?s KB block. ?This is the first time in 15 years that we have witnessed a blast of any kind. It was so intense that tremors ran through the entire area, breaking one of our bedroom windowpanes,? said Samarendranath Bhattacharjee, owner, flat 2 of KB 10. The noise of the explosion could also be heard at Suraksha, a nursing home near the spot.

 ?The area is not very secure, with squatters settling down. We have to look beyond this incident and at the larger law-and-order issue,? said Roopen Chaudhury, former additional district magistrate, Jalpaiguri.

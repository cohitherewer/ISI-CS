The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Direct feed for cricket

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Will nearly 80 per cent of the cable homes be able to watch Anil Kumble cross Kapil Dev as the highest Indian wicket-taker or Sachin Tendulkar challenge Sunil Gavaskar as the highest Indian run-getter when the India-Bangladesh Test gets underway on December 10? 

 No one really knows, as ESPN and STAR Sports, the sports bouquet beaming the match, remains switched off on the networks of Indian Cable Net and Manthan.

 But there may be hope for a section of cable-viewers, as the broadcaster finalises plans to provide direct feed of the two channels to around 10 operators, bypassing the multi-system operators (MSOs) they are under. The areas range from Behala and Jadavpur in south Calcutta to Baguiati and Bangur in the north, and even districts such as Hooghly.

 ?In the past three weeks, eight to 10 master control rooms have migrated from Manthan and Indian Cable Net to the other two MSOs,? said Sricharan Iyengar, vice-president, sales amp; marketing for ESPN STAR Sports. ?That covers around 70,000 households, while the direct feed option we are planning will further help reach the match to around 50,000 more.?

 With the government in no mood to step in to resolve the crisis on the grounds that contractual agreements between the MSOs and the broadcaster must be fulfilled, operators are under pressure from viewers, particularly since cricket featuring Team India is at stake.

 ?If the problem is not resolved between the MSO and the broadcaster by the time the match starts, we are keeping the direct feed option open,? said Mrinal Chatterjee, an operator in Bangur. ?After all, my viewers are paying me to watch the channels they want to and they should not suffer.?

 But for the rest not yet mulling the decoder option, piracy concerns still remain for ESPN STAR Sports. ?We are rather concerned about the channels being pirated and have an anti-piracy unit in place, monitoring the situation,? disclosed Iyengar.

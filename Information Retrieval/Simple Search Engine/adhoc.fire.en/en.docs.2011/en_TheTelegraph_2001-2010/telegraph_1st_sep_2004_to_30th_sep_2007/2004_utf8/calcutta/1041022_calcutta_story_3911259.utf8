 Alien Durga domain 

Amazing canvas, contours

 For Toronto-based freelance writer Julia Morgan, it?s a ?fascinating assignment?, which will enable her to delve deep into the lore of ?female power?. 

 Akiko Miyata from Tokyo is here to see how the ?Mother kills the devil?, while for Singapore?s Liu Fangjoo, the word Pujas fires a blank, even at Mohammad Ali Park. Calcutta to her is simply Mother Teresa territory.

 The festivities over, Liu will surely fly back to the island nation with more memorable frames of Calcutta than just Mother House. 

 But it?s what Julia pens, or, for that matter, Malaysian scribe Tan Kok Hin churns out, that could serve a far more critical purpose ? the need to wrap-sell Calcutta?s unparalleled week-long carnival beyond its shores.

 For most of the 100-odd overseas guests of Happenings, the NGO that had kicked off the first structured Puja-trek push last year, in tandem with West Bengal Tourism, there?s one common intrigue factor: Why isn?t this out-of-the-world, four-day festival better publicised abroad?

 ?The Pujas can act as a forceful fulcrum to attract global tourists to Calcutta, only if the festival is marketed right overseas,? says George Wesley, a Doha-based NRI, in town for Happenings? Mahotsav. 

 Wesley, manager of Trans-Orient Travel amp; Tourism Centre in Doha, is keen to put the Durga domain firmly on the radar of West Asian tourists scanning Indian stops as a ?must-visit?.

 Julia, who has helped organise the International Festival of Authors ? ?the Olympics of literary people? ? in Canada, shares the perception perspective. ?Calcutta?s image in the West doesn?t do justice to the lively city, and the Pujas could be the perfect platform to turn things around,? observes the arts and crafts researcher. 

 Along with lensman friend Paul, she is keen to explore the behind-the-scenes odd jobs that create the spectacle.

 For Hans Well, a musician and socio-political satirist from Munich, this is the third trip to Calcutta, but the first during the Pujas.

 ?I know this is an inclusive festival and I hope to do a special composition once I?m back in Bavaria on the Pujas? amazing canvas and its varied contours,? says Hans, before getting into the pandal-hop bus on Saptami night along with wife Sabeeka and kids Sarah, Tapea and Jonas.

 Hans is lucky. Sabeeka grew up in Calcutta and could communicate some of the sights and sounds associated with the Pujas. 

 But for Akiko and her mother Kunie, or David Low, a senior executive with Tisco?s Singapore partner Natsteel, minuscule morsels of information about the Pujas have been garnered from backpackers or by surfing the Net.

 The Mahotsav move is being seen as a meaningful kick-off. The state tourism department and India Tourism, the information and publicity arm of the Union tourism ministry, have both identified the need to alter perception for incoming tourist traffic flow to the city to rise above the trickle. 

 And Happenings is confident the image correction exercise has started in earnest.

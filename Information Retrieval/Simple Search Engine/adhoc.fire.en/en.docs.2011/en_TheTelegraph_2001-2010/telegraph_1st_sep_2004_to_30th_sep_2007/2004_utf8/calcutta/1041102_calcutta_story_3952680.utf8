 Calcutta, the city of art and culture, is a regular halt for most visiting performers from abroad. But science events, particularly with participation from different countries, are few and far between. Initiatives from the MP Birla Planetarium may change some of that, at least in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics.

 ?When Alliance Francaise approached us in 2001 for use of our lecture hall for seminars, we learnt that the French government was trying to showcase science in different Indian cities,? said Debiprosad Duari, director, research amp; academics of the planetarium. ?Keeping in mind the limited science programmes, we grabbed the opportunity for a tie-up.?

 French Science Today is the result. The annual programme showcases recent developments in various fields carried out in France. As part of this year?s event, three eminent scientists are delivering lectures at the planetarium. On Monday, Richard Taillet, a noted French astrophysicist, made a presentation on ?Antimatter in the universe?.

 Earlier, on October 27, Henry Videau spoke on ?Particle physics and its connection to cosmology and medical applications?, while Pierre Coullet is scheduled to go through ?The historical developments of the science of motion: geometry, determinism and randomness? on Wednesday.

 ?The speakers are primarily physicists, but their work greatly impacts astronomy,? explained Duari. And though the topics sound technical, the speakers insist they are not only for students of the subject.

 ?There is so much science and technology in our lives these days but most people still feel very intimidated by it,? said Taillet. ?It?s great to have opportunities like these to bring the subject to the general audience.?

 On his second visit to the city, Taillet is all praises for the Calcutta response. ?It?s one of the few places where I saw great interaction and participation from the audience with very specific queries,? the assistant professor at University of Savoie added. His city stop was preceded by Mumbai, Goa, Thiruvananthapuram and Chennai, while Ranchi and Bhopal are next on the list.

 The planetarium?s plans include approaching other embassies ? notably American, British and German ? for similar collaborations. ?And apart from the talks, we are trying to have more exhibitions for the benefit of the general public,? Duari promised.

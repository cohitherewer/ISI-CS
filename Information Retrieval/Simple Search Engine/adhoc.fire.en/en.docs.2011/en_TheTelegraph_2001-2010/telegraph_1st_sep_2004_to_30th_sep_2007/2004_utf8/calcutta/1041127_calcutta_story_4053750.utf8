 Two police officers shifted in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two inspectors-in-charge (IC) of Salt Lake police stations have been transferred barely 48 hours after the director-general of police voiced concern about the deteriorating law-and-order situation in the township.

 Sushil Dutta of Bidhannagar (North) police station and Chittaranjan Mondal of Bidhannagar (South) police station are the two officers who have been transferred. The transfer order, sources said, was issued on Thursday. 

 ?The transfers are routine,? V. Mishra, inspector-general of police (South Bengal), said on Friday. Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, said the ICs were transferred along with a host of other inspectors. 

 Bimal Pati, additional inspector-in-charge of Bidhannagar (North), will take over as the new IC of the police station, while Ardhendu Sekhar Pahari, an official of the district intelligence bureau, will take charge of Bidhannagar (South) police station, Kumar said. Mondal and Dutta have been transferred to the CID and DIB (South 24-Parganas), respectively. 

 Police sources said the two officers were transferred after a spate of crimes, including dacoity, snatching and eve-teasing, in the township within the span of a month. 

 Last Wednesday, director-general of police Shyamal Dutta had held a high-level meeting at Bidhannagar (North) police station. He later told the media that measures would be taken to improve the law-and-order situation in Salt Lake. From Wednesday night, police started conducting a series of raids in the township and arrested more than 100 people.

 ?We have started taking measures already. No thefts have been reported in the township since Wednesday night,? said a police officer.

 Several motorcycles have been stopped in the past few days during vehicle checks at various entry and exit points of Salt Lake. ?We have stepped up vigil and there will be more arrests,? said another police officer. 

 The spate of incidents started on October 31, with a promoter and his gang entering a house in CE block in Bidhannagar (North) police station and beating up residents. On November 2, dacoits raided a house in EC block under the same police station and decamped with jewellery and other valuables.

 There were also two-wheeler snatchings in AE block, two thefts at BC block and jewellery snatching cases in the Bidhannagar (North) police station area. 

 In Bidhannagar (South), two youths recently harassed a woman near the FD park. There was also a theft at a house in FD block, an attempt to snatch a handbag from a woman on Broadway and a jewellery snatching case near IA market. 

 The biggest crime in the police station area was perpetrated in broad daylight near the Karunamoyee island, where dacoits looted lakhs from a guard of Anandalok Hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

L-ZONE: Shisha

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

The beginning

 The coming to town of the first-ever Hookah Bar in the city with glamour babe Neha Dhupia taking the first few puffs on an elaborately-designed glass and metal hookah a year-and-a-half ago was greeted with more than a warm response by Calcutta?s party animals. The small chill-out zone (hardly one-fourth the other popular nightclubs in town) was an instant hit, largely because of its cosy interiors and the lure of flavoured shisha (tobacco) imported from Egypt.

Hot haunt

 Lounging on the low-lying seating arrangement looking on to the dance floor with a chance to cosy up without the sofa handles or table tops coming in the way makes Shisha the perfect setting for the young and the young at heart. 

 With satin cushions for support and dim lights to ring in the romantic mood, a true Shisha loyalist refuses to settle for less. Reason why being able to enter the 22 Camac Street fun zone on a weekend night is just half the battle won, finding a place to sit (or even stand) is mission impossible. But that doesn?t stop the Shisha battalion from coming back for battle.

 Guest list

 Not just Calcutta?s party people, Mumbai party maniacs who chill out at hotspots like Athena and Insomnia seem to feel at home at this tiny nightspot. From Anupam Kher to Abhishek Bachchan, Raveena Tandon to Soha Ali Khan, everyone makes it a point to drop in here whenever in town. There?s no private lounge here for these cine stars to take refuge in and yet they don?t seem to mind the madness. Raveena during her Sahib Biwi Gulam shoot days in Calcutta had almost become a regular here. 

 ?On the first anniversary of Shisha on September 19, Abhishek (in town for Antarmahal) dropped in and made the celebrations even more special,? says manager Sovon Mukherjee. Indian cricket?s pin-up boy Yuvraj Singh with Rohan Gavaskar have also been guests here, as have MTV and Channel [V] VJs by the dozen. The Calcutta regulars read Debasree, Konkona, June, Pallavi?

 Puff amp; bite

 The flavoured shisha of course! Lighter than the original version of the old-world smoke, even the dainty female companion of the macho man can try the flavoured versions. With over a dozen flavours to choose from, peach, apricot, double apple, grape and strawberry remain hot favourites. Flavours like jasmine and cola are also on offer, though not as hot on the sale list. The fun munch consists mostly of Indian kebabs and some Lebanese snacks and starters. Pasta is the only ?full meal? on offer.

Music mania

 The male guest brigade might swear by the ambience, the crowd and the music they get at Shisha, but the women who frequent this place would rather swear by the DJ! Girish, the man behind the console who plays remixes to hip hop and all else, is not just great with his music but has quite a fan following, too.

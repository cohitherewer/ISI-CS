The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Home lobby happy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A footfall deluge over the last three days saw Home Front 2004 ending on a belligerent note on Tuesday, with most of the exhibitors reporting better business compared to last year.

 Held as part of the India International Mega Trade Fair on the Maidan, the exposition was extended by two days to make up for the bad weather. 

 More than 175,000 people visited the housing expo, where 94 pavilions showcased nearly 10,000 apartments set to come up in and around the city over the next 36 months.

 ?We had more than 5,000 people visiting our stall, with 15-20 per cent serious walk-ins,? said Amit Jain of N.K. Realtors, a leading property dealer, displaying 30 projects offering nearly 2,000 units. 

 Jain, however, preferred a standalone expo format for the ?focused house-hunter?.

 Pradip Chopra, secretary, CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers? Association of India)-Bengal and a partner in the 1,100-apartment Sherwood Estate, felt the exhibition had served its purpose, in spite of the weather damper. ?The primary purpose of such expositions is to create brand equity and recall, which was achieved,? he said.

 Merlin Group managing director Sushil Mohta, also a partner in South City, was excited at the ?recognition? for the real estate sector at the fair, which was inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

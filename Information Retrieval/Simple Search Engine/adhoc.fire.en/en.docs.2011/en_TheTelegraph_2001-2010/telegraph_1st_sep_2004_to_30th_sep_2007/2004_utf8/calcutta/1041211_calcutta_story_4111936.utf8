The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bank door hold-up 

 - TWO SNATCH RS 5 LAKH AND FLEE

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The driver of a cloth merchant alleged that he had been robbed of Rs 5.03 lakh by two armed youths while he was approaching the State Bank of India (SBI)?s Alipore branch on Friday morning.

 While one of the youths held a firearm to the forehead of Rama Shankar Singh, the other stabbed his right hand before snatching the bag containing the cash. The duo fled even before Singh could react. 

 Senior officers from Alipore police station and the detective department inspected the site. All the adjoining police stations have been alerted, but no one has been arrested. 

 According to police, Singh reached the SBI?s Alipore Commercial Network branch, at the Alipore Road-Durgapur Road crossing, around 11 am. 

 ?Singh, in his mid-40s, has been associated with the merchant?s family for the past several years. Every day, he comes to the bank from his employer?s residence, on Garden Reach Road, in a car to deposit money,? an officer of Alipore thana told Metro.

 Singh told police that he didn?t find anything unusual while entering the three-storeyed building. The bank is on the first floor.

 But he was intercepted while climbing up the stairs. Two youths, in their late 20s, stopped him on the landing between the ground floor and the first floor. 

 ?One of them aimed a firearm at my forehead, while the other was brandishing a knife. I resisted their attempt to snatch the bag with the money. The knife-wielding youth then stabbed my right palm and snatched the bag. It all happened within five seconds,? an officer quoted Singh as having said during interrogation.

 Singh then ran straight to the bank and narrated the incident to officials. 

 During preliminary investigations, police found that the exit point of the building had been too busy at that time for the robbers to flee without being noticed. ?But no one has come forward to claim that he saw the duo. We are going through Singh?s statement thoroughly,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Police said they were examining Singh?s wound to be sure that it was not self-inflicted. ?Experts and doctors have been engaged for this. Singh has been detained at Alipore police station for further interrogation,? said an officer.

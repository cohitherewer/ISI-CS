The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Awards to be won in a war on AIDS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A novel method to fight an old problem is what a new programme offers. 

 The West Bengal State AIDS Prevention amp; Control Society, Thoughtshop Foundation, an NGO working on youth issues, and Balmer Lawrie amp; Co Ltd launched the Youth Awards for Social Initiatives 2004-05 on Monday, with HIV/AIDS in focus.

 The first year of the award will involve training and guidance for groups of youngsters, mainly from colleges and youth groups, as they conceptualise and put into practice their own projects to control the spread of the deadly disease. 

 Once the volunteers are registered, the initiative will work in three phases, with the final award ceremony in March 2005. 

 There will be prizes at every step and the idea is to be boldly innovative and reach out far and wide. 

 ?This will encourage the spirit of voluntary activity and competitiveness among the youngsters, and will also let them use their imagination,? said S. Suresh Kumar, project director the state AIDS cell. 

 While the state education department is working on including HIV/AIDS awareness lessons in the school syllabus, Kumar added: ?We will implement the winning projects on a larger scale.?

 The judges include Pawan Dhall of Saathii, an NGO working in the field of HIV/AIDS, Josephine Reedzu of Oxfam UK and Umesh Kakarania of the NGO Sparsha. 

 Lending the support of his students was R.G. Kakaria of the National Cadet Corps.

 ?We have been working with this issue for a while, and we felt that the enthusiasm and imagination of the youngsters had not been adequately utilised in the HIV/AIDS campaign,? said Mira Kakkar, secretary of Thoughtshop Foundation. 

 The aim is to reach about 1,250 students from 25 colleges.

 In this battle, knowledge is the winning weapon.

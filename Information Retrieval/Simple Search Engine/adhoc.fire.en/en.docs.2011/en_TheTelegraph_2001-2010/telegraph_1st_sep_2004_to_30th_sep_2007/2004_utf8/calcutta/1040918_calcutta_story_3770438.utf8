 Get set for a closer look at colleges than a career fair affords

 Shop at Harrod?s, be photographed next to the Bachchan statue at Madame Tussaud?s, drive down to Buckingham Palace and also visit the universities to check which one want you want to study in.

 Welcome to education tourism in Calcutta. ?So far, students have had the career fairs to hand them a list of universities and the Internet to confuse them with an overload of information. But this hardly gives them much idea about the place,? says Kaustav Majumdar, director, Asia-Pacific, of Icons International Partnership, an educational consultancy and placement firm. 

 Icons is proposing to take them to the institutions, make them interact with teachers and students, give a feel of the library and laboratories and even arrange a stay at the hostel. ?This way they can take an informed decision,? he adds. Icons has the organisational muscle to pull this together, being a group company of Human Resource Group PLC, a ?80 million conglomerate with more than 80 offices in the UK.

 The first such trip, targeted at students of Classes XI and XII and third and fourth years, is planned for December. Spread over two weeks, it will include a tour of five universities. ?Checking out the facilities is an important part of one?s choice. The library at Northumbria University, for instance, has 4.2 million books. One can hardly make out the magnitude from brochures,? says Majumdar. And if one carries one?s marksheets, one can even get admitted on the spot.

 The choice of the universities will depend on the interests of the students making up the group of 30. ?If they have cross-sectional interests, we will choose universities like Sussex with a variety of courses. If they have focused expectations in say, fashion, we will choose the likes of Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College.? 

 Icons is also in a position to include European universities outside the UK. ?If a batch is interested in the hospitality industry, it is only fair that we take them to Switzerland.? 

 The places to visit will also change accordingly. A group travelling to Scotland will tour the Lake district. The bill of Rs 1.25 lakh will include return airfare, visa charges, travel within the country, living expenses and three meals a day. ?We are not sponsoring the shopping,? Majumdar quips.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at...Kuldiha

 I had just reached the perfect clearing in the jungle, where elephants and deer foraged on the ground and leopards licked themselves clean on extended branches of trees, when something sharp pressed against my shoulder. It felt like a bison?s horn.

 I woke up with a start and found Jogindra staring into my face, his finger poking me. ?Elephants,? he whispered. I didn?t even have the time to rub the sleep off my eyes when the blast of the cold hit me as he dragged me out of the forest bungalow.

 It was kartik purnima and the moon was so bright that it cast sharp shadows and outlined the bodies of the pachyderms in the saltlick around 20 metres from the maacha we were on. We counted four, then a smaller shadow appeared from under the belly of one of them in what seemed like an extension of my dream.

 For those fleeting moments the elephants gave us an audience, shovelling the earth with their feet and trunks to get at the salt balls below, I watched mesmerised, almost forgetting the cold and the irritation of the mosquitoes buzzing in my ears. Then the elephants departed and the chill reasserted itself, sending me scurrying back to my sleeping bag.

 I was tired, no, make that very tired, after covering 330 km by road to reach Kuldiha sanctuary in Orissa, but I lay awake on my bed in the forest bungalow all night, reliving my meeting with the jumbos. Then I went about wondering why no one had suggested the name of this forest in which I had seen jungle fowl and bands of monkeys immediately after entering the gates and five elephants within four hours of arriving at the bungalow.

 Sprawled over 272 sq km, over rolling hills that rise to heights of 200 m at places, Kuldiha sanctuary in the Balasore district of Orissa, is not one of the well-known forests. 

 Yet it boasts of a healthy population of elephants along with deer, bison, bear and leopard. And if Jogindra, the forest guard for six years here, is to be believed, the herbivores are regular visitors at the saltlick.

 Though the lack of tourists has worked well for the forest, it has also resulted in the lack of preparedness among department officials to receive them. 

 It is advisable for those keen on visiting this sanctuary to carry food rations and direct the forest guard while he is preparing the meals. Forest guards here also double as guides, escorting visitors on foot through the woods. Such treks are enchanting, often revealing rock pools and streams otherwise hidden by the tangy undergrowth that abounds where shafts of sun hit the forest floor.

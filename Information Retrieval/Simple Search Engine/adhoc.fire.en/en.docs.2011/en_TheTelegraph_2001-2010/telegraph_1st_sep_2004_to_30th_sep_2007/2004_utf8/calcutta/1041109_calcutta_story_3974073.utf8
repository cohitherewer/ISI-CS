 Metal motifs for festive flames

SANGITA SULTANIA G. ROY

Put out the light on days of boring white wax sticks 

dotting the parapet or tiny earthen lamps dripping with oil sullying the new coat 

of festive paint. Light your fire this Diwali with diyas as varied as the 

crackers you burst. While terracotta diyas are as popular as ever, their 

metal counterparts provide a new-age alternative.

 If your jewel box is spilling over, invest in silver-plated diyas this Dhanteras. These are die-cast copper pieces, with a silver coating achieved through electrolysis. Interesting relief work on the rim helps break the metal monotony as does a swastika motif inside. Sometimes the silver coat is given an oxidised finish for an antique look. 

 There are more affordable white metal options in zinc and aluminium as well. Shapes vary widely to include everything from conch shells to gods and goddesses.

 But if you really want to spark up in style, check out the bell metal or dokra diyas shaped like animals, tribal men and women and gods and goddesses playing lady with the lamp.

While on the off-beat option trail, glass diyas in the shape of earthen teacups can capture your imagination like no other. Adorned with metal embellishments, these combine the sheen of glass with the richness of metal. To avoid a storm in a glass cup, these, like candles, are safely stuffed with wax and a wick.

 Staunch takers for more down-to-earth options can still take recourse to traditional terracotta diyas, but with a difference. 

 owers, leaves, pitchers and Lakshmi and Ganesha shapes are an interesting departure from row upon row of the standard, oblong ones that will line every balcony and window in town. 

 While stone-studded diyas provide double shine, the lantern-style perforated hanging variety with candles for a safe flame are a funky option. Floor stands topped with diyas meant for the entrance or the foyer would go well with a touch of rangoli.

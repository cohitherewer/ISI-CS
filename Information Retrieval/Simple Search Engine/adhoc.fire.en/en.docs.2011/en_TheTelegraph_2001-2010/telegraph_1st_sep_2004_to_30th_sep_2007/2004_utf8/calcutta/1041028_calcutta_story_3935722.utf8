The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From Macbeth to Laloo

 She is into her third Bollywood film and has already bagged a title role. Masumi plays Padmashree in Mahesh Manjrekar?s upcoming laugh riot Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav. And this comes after two completely different roles in her sister, director Shona Urvashi?s Chupke Se and Vishal Bharadwaj?s award-winning Maqbool.

 ?The order of the three films has been very good for me. Chupke Se not only gave me a platform to play a solo heroine but it also proved that I can play the girl next door. Maqbool proved that I can be a great actress. And now Padmashree... will prove that I can be totally glamorous as well,? the actress told Metro.

 Padmashree... has Masumi playing a glam doll wanting to get her father?s diamonds back from the goons. ?You can call my character teekhi mirchi. It is a very situational comedy. We had a whole lot of fun on the sets. Suniel (Shetty) is a thorough professional but as is well known, he is a very big prankster. Johnny Lever is a stand-up comedian who has his audience everywhere. We were giggling throughout. The 30-day Cape Town shoot was over just like that.?

 The actress is also very impressed with her director Mahesh Manjrekar. ?We have worked earlier in theatre. He is so good in any creative discipline. He is primarily an excellent director. As an actor he is always willing to experiment. He is also a good singer and a great painter.?

 Masumi still can?t get over the tryst with Laloo Prasad Yadav (picture above) when the team went to shoot the climax in the railway minister?s house in Patna. ?You know what, the journos stopped writing, the photographers stopped clicking when Lalooji started cracking his jokes. Then I realised how apt the title of our film was. I did spend a lot more time with Rabriji, because the culture there is men hang around with men and women hang around with women. And I must admit their children are all very educated, contrary to what people believe.?

 As for her acting skills, Masumi believes she owes a lot to Maqbool. ?See, I am not someone who will be intimidated by my co-actors. Otherwise I wouldn?t have been able to come up with such a performance in the film. I did have a great experience working alongside such actors as Pankaj Kapoor, Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah. I learnt a lot just watching them perform and as an actress, I would have even been ready to play a tree trunk in the film.?

 As for her other forthcoming ventures, she is tightlipped like other ?superstitious actors?. But she?s definitely in the Madhu Ambat film 1:1.16 ? An Ode to Lost Love that has made it to the Indian Panorama which features her as a big-screen heroine in a bizarre love triangle with the director and cinematographer. Her German film Gate to Heaven, that finds her parked in Frankfurt airport, released last month in Germany and met with a healthy response there.

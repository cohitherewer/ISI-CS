If you think Daniel Ocean?s thieving men are the only 

ones who had their unlawful eye set on a Faberge egg, revisit your history books. 

Carl Faberge, the Russian jeweller and goldsmith, is a legend not only because 

of his classic creations but also because he was sought after by Europe?s 19th 

and early 20th Century royalty.

While in Ocean?s 12, a band of robbers led 

by George Clooney made a Romanov coronation egg worth millions (AP picture) its 

target, the British family has the largest existing collection of works by the 

master. 

Faberge in the Royal Collection by Caroline 

de Guitaut (Rs 3,065) is an informative exploration of the history behind it.

The book, available at Crossword, is a delight for 

those interested in history and art, with over 200 pictures in colour and black 

and white. The British royal family has collected over 600 pieces. Most, however, 

were purchased before 1917.

Queen Alexandra, consort of King Edward II, was introduced 

to the work of Faberge (1846-1920) by sister Tsarina Maria Feodorovna, who became 

Faberge?s leading patron. But even the reigning British royals have added to the 

line.

It includes decorative pieces like eggs, flowers, 

animals, boxes, lighters, and fewer examples of jewellery and tableware.

The fabled Faberge egg evolved as the favoured Easter 

gift. Each took up to a year to make, fashioned from gold delicately inlaid with 

precious gems and enamel. The royal collection includes classics like the Mosaic 

Egg, in which tiny cut stones like diamond, ruby, emerald and sapphire tile a 

gold and platinum egg.

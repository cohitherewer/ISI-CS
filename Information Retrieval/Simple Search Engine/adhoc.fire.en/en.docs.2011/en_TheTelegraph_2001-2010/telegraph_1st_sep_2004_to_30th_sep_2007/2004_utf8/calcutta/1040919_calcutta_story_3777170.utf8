The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Teachers to the fun fore

 It was a party like no other ? just for schoolteachers 

and principals. Don?t frown in confusion, for there was no question of staid behaviour 

and very little shop talk. All the action was on the dance floor, as it was proved 

that even teachers can have fun, and how. Of course, Usha Uthup doing what she 

does best did work wonders with getting the initially shy educators into the spotlight.

The occasion was a celebration ? for an international 

award coming the way of The Telegraph In Schools (TTIS).

Last month, The World Association of Newspapers awarded 

TTIS the World Young Reader Prize 2004. Friday evening?s party at Saturday 

Club was for the teachers and principals who are a part of TTIS. After 

a flashback on the success of the Pakistan trip and details of how the award was 

won, it was time for the games to begin.

For once, however, Usha was upstaged by a brother-sister 

duo. The two jazz pianists ? Angela and Savio ? dazzled the spellbound audience 

with their rendition of songs like Bechamo mucho and Lambada. The 

reason for the raised eyebrows ? the two musicians were six and eight years old, 

respectively. Music clearly runs in the blood for the two grandchildren of jazz 

musician Antonio Menezes. The singer watched from the sidelines, before lending 

her voice to their final performance.

Then, the fun and the frolic. First on the floor, 

not for the first time, was Barry ?Brien, ?brand ambassador? for TTIS. Giving 

him company was Sister Teresa Anthony, provincial in charge of the Daughters of 

the Cross, which manages schools like St Teresa?s and St Agnes?. Grey hair and 

creaking joints notwithstanding, she got a resounding applause for her rather 

fancy footwork. That seemed to give the others all the prompting they needed.

Beatles to old Hindi film classics like Baar baar 

dekho, Usha sang to her heart?s content (dressed in the trademark TTIS 

colours of red, white and black with a T on her bindi), while the teachers 

had a good old-fashioned blast. Special mention should be made of the principal 

of Mahadevi Birla Girls High School, Rashi Narula and her husband Colonel Narula, 

and Mr and Mrs Don Alney, who were by far the best dancers for the night. Ian 

Myers, principal of Frank Anthony, although a late starter, was also quite a hit. 

Way to go, ladies and gentleman. Full marks for enthusiasm. 

And that?s what makes the TTIS spirit so infectious.

Bookstore blast

 In celebration of the 10th anniversary of the pub 

at The Park and the launch of the book Someplace Else Forever, various 

bookstores in the city will play host to a set of four musical acts by bands that 

have made Someplace Else what it is.

?The concept of bringing live music and events into 

department stores is catching on in Calcutta. The very idea of people browsing 

through books and experiencing live drama or musical performances at the same 

time is a welcome variation,? feels musician Nondon Bagchi.

The first performance of the series was held at the 

Oxford Bookstore on September 15 for a select audience. Hip Pocket restricted 

its performance to only five soft rock singles. Starting off the 40-minute act 

with Imagine and wrapping up the evening with an original, Place in 

the sun, they served up an appetiser for the main course at the pub. 

The second act of this musical delight was held at 

Landmark on September 17. This was a 60-minute act by Span, which belted out numbers 

by the Beatles, Eagles and popular singles like Summer of ?69. Span members 

thanked Someplace Else for providing them with ?the platform? to express their 

musical abilities and also making the city audience known country-wide for its 

love of rock music.

The event will next roll into Seagull Book Stores 

with Krosswindz on September 21, before concluding at Crossword.

Freeze fiasco on the floor

 DJ Sanjay Dutta

 The catch line for the evening was ?freeze on the 

floor? and it truly ended up being a rather cold affair at Tantra on Friday night. 

Not the usual space-jam floor that one sees at the nightclub on Friday, but a 

motley mix of 50-odd party people busy enjoying their drinks, quite oblivious 

to the music.

DJ Sanjay Dutta, dubbed ?the city?s answer to Judge 

Jules?, was back after a long time with his collection of progressive house, hoping 

to have the party hoppers grooving to the tunes of his trademark House tracks. 

But things didn?t quite work out the way he would have wanted.

Sanjay, whose association with Tantra dates back to 

the initial days of the nightclub, took to the turntable churning out tracks like 

Thirty three revs by Those 2 Guys, The message by the Pig and Dan 

and Soul tami by Casamecca. But nothing managed to draw enough feet to 

the floor. The desperate DJ was even heard screaming, ?No Bollywood music tonight, 

and if you are expecting it you are at the wrong place.?

Need we spell out who really was at the wrong place?

DJ with a difference

He has a wide repertoire of non-alcoholic and alcoholic 

beverages up his sleeve. Meet Dhananjoy Kumar, better known as DJ, the new bartender 

at The Chowringhee Bar at Oberoi Grand. With his trademark cocktail dance, which 

involves shaking both the body and the shots, DJ is wooing guests with drinks 

of all colours and flavours by the bar. Boasting a solid cocktail-training background 

in London, he is sure to entertain and with no guarantee that you?ll end up on 

your feet. The high, however, will last only till September 28.

Party Pooper

Never say die was the DJ?s dirge at a nightclub on 

Friday. Having failed to whip up magic at the turntable, he was heard telling 

the lone couple on the floor to enjoy its drinks as he was ?taking a break? after 

a hard day?s night. It sure is hard playing to an empty house!

 It is a welcome suggestion, provided, of course, we are talking about fireworks within legal decibel limits. There are so many traditions associated with the pujas that are vanishing with time. Kite-flying on Vishwakarma puja is one such. Another is the tubri contests that used to take place in every other locality. There was so much excitement about the ingredients to make the sparks leap up the highest. Of course, sometimes accidents would also take place. These days such fireworks exhibitions take place only in the posh clubs and we all crowd there to watch the display. The government can and should undertake an initiative like that to add to the attraction of Diwali. After setbacks like Babri Masjid and Kargil war, foreigners are starting to come back here. We took so many of them around during Durga puja. It would be a nice attraction for them. So many international tournaments end with fireworks displays and people always adore them.

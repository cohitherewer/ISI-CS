 Axe drive for green cover

 - Forest officers helpless in face of pre-Puja tree-cut onslaught

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta?s green cover has taken a beating of late, thanks to illegal felling and trimming by Puja organisers and agencies involved in road repairs. 

 Alarmed by the spurt in such incidents, forest department officials have sent a note to their ministry, expressing helplessness to save the trees.

 ?We do not have the legal sanction to book offenders for felling trees in non-forest areas,? reads the note of the divisional forest office, Calcutta. 

 The office is armed with a Calcutta High Court directive ? EN/1668/3C-20/96 ? to fight felling, trimming and transplantation of trees. ?The court directive prohibits any person or establishment in the city to cut down full-grown trees or even trim the branches without our consent,? said S. Bhattacharya, divisional forest officer (utilisation). 

 But implementing the order, officials claimed, is easier said than done. ?PWD contractors, the civic authorities or other agencies hardly consult us before chopping trees,? said a forest department official. 

 Statistics bear out his claim. Till September this year, the divisional forest office has received 162 applications for felling, trimming and transplanting full-grown trees in the city. 

 ?After an inspection, we allowed the felling of 42 trees and trimming of another 13. Transplantation of only two trees were allowed,? forest officer Bhattacharya said.

 But a close look at various pockets of the city will reveal that a far greater number of trees were felled or trimmed, he asserted.

 According to officials, illegal felling takes place across the city, but the maximum number of cases are reported from the south. 

 ?We cannot even act when informed that a tree is being felled illegally. Since the city does not come under the forest area, we cannot prosecute anyone,? an official reasoned.

 ?Unlike in forests, we cannot direct the police to get the offender arrested. Lodging a case in the court is the only option open to us,? he added.

 The divisional forest office has urged the government to incorporate some clauses that may empower its officials to prosecute the offender.

 Forest department secretary R.K. Tripathi was not available for comment.

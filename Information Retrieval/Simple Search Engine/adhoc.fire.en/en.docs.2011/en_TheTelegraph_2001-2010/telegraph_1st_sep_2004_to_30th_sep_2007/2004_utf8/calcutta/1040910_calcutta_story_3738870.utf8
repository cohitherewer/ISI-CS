 Tankers on track till Puja-end

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The West Bengal Tankers Association called off its strike at 2 pm on Thursday, after transport minister Subhas Chakraborty asked oil firms to defer the phase-out of 15-year-old carriers till after the Pujas.

 ?I have asked oil firms tokeep the issue on hold till Kali puja. In many ways, the issue relates to the Centre and we will have to speak to the surface transport and petroleum ministries about it. We will need time to arrive at a solution. The matter will be taken up again after November 15,? Chakraborty said. 

 ?The transport minister has assured us that if required, the CPM members of Parliament will take up the issue. He asked us not to go against public interest, with the festivals around the corner. So, we decided to call off the strike,? said Ajit Das, secretary of the association, after the meeting.

 The scene at petrol pumps in the city was chaotic, with 90 per cent of them running dry. 

 ?The situation will take time to improve, since only 25 per cent of the tankers will manage to bring oil from the depots in Mourigram and Budge Budge tonight. About 70 per cent of the pumps will remain dry till Friday morning,? said Joydeb Sarkar, secretary, West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association. He held out the hope of normalcy returning by Friday afternoon.

 Asked why Bengal was the only state protesting the phaseout, minister Chakraborty said: ?There is no unity among tankers in other states, so no problem arose.?

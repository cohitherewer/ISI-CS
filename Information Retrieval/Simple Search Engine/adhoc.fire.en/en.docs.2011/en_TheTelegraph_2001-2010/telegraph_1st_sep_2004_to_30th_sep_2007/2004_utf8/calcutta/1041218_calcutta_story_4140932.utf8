 A question of inheritance

 In a world full of fleeting realities, illusions and disillusionment, people derive solace only from their own sense of values and the comfort of filial relationships. However, when they are also in danger of being challenged, the bounds of sanity and stability collapse, making one lose ones mental balance. This tragic reality forms the crux of Chetanas production, Nirnay, being staged as part of Nandikars 21st National Theatre Festival. Based on David Auburn?s Proof, the play unfolds the tale of Catherine, a troubled young woman, who experiences conflicting emotions on the eve of her 25th birthday. Following the death of her mentally-deranged father, who was also a mathematical genius, her already volatile emotions are further strained by the arrival of her estranged sister, Claire, and by the presence of Hal, a former student of her father, in her life. Amidst a burgeoning romance and the discovery of her father?s mysterious notebook, Catherine is finally prompted to ask herself a very poignant question: Will she inherit both her father?s genius as well as his madness?

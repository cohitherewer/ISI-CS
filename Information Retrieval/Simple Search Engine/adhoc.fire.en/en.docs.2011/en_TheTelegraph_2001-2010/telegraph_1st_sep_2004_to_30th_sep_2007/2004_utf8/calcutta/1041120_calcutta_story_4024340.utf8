An event which, is in the truest sense by the DJs, 

of the DJs and for the DJs, rocked Calcutta on Thursday night as the eighth Mixmasters 

India-tour took off at Tantra around midnight. 

Forced to push the musical trip to a slow Thursday, 

owing to the 24-hour bandh on Wednesday, the nightclub at The Park still managed 

to work up a crowd.

This was the kick-off point for the eight-city tour, 

where four mix masters at the console from four cities gathered to spin a night 

of magic with music. 

To flag off the event was DJ Jazzy Joe, the man behind 

the annual DJing event, who conceptualised the contest eight years ago. Since, 

he has been busy taking it around the country.

?This is the only annual clubbing event that has no 

corporate backing. It is meant to give the best to music lovers and also to foster 

a sense of togetherness and belonging among the DJ community,? explains the DJ, 

who performed at the opening night. 

so taking charge of the playlist were expert mixers 

DJ Wayne Beck from Chennai, DJ Yusuf Kapasi from Pune and DJ Sanjay Dutta from 

Calcutta. Apart from the founder of the event, other names have changed through 

the years, depending on availability of the DJs. 

After the Calcutta opening, the tour moves on to Guwahati, 

Shillong, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune.

?While on the one hand the crowd gets the best of 

four DJs with their respective strengths, for the young DJ brigade it is a lesson 

that even DJs ? who are usually so competitive ? can perform as a team,? explains 

Jazzy, an industry veteran of over 10 years.

In keeping with the promise of rendering the best 

for the audience, the foursome set Tantra on fire with a mix of some great tracks 

? taking in hip hop to R amp;B, trance to the inevitable remixes ? the platter 

of music was truly versatile. 

Unlike the high-profile DJ events where the music 

turns out to be furthest removed from the music that anyone has heard and wants 

to hear, the music on this occasion was enjoyable and popular.

With DJ Sanjay taking to the mike, Jazzy looping and 

scratching the record, Yusuf working hard at mixing hip hop number and Wayne getting 

the next few tracks in place, the team worked flawlessly. And it was the crowd 

that was the winner all the way, getting great music, with even better energy 

behind it.

Fan MAil

Let?s get one thing clear at the very outset. It is 

altogether unreasonable to expect a die-hard fan of just about anything to be 

wholly objective about the object of one?s affection, adoration, devotion.

So, when a U2 Night is held at Calcutta?s Mecca for 

live music, Someplace Else, only Bono et al could really match up to expectations 

from certain impassioned members of the audience. A fanatic may make the harshest 

(and most boring) critic, but she can also be the true test of quality. Every 

word, every chord of every song ever written by the Irish rockers are treasured.

One could say the singers of this particular local 

band have voices sans power and therefore, the night was a failure. The music 

was, after all, pretty good. But not so. Bono hardly has a timbre to take on Sinatra 

(though when he did, it wasn?t half bad). How does he pull off rock songs and 

love ballads that can galvanise politicians to write off millions of dollars in 

third-world debt besides managing to melt the hardest heart? These are not words 

that you can mouth. These are words that must be felt, breathed, lived, tasted.

When the should-have-been sweet sounds of Who?s 

Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses? rang through the packed pub, there should also 

have been an accompanying warning ? Achtung, Baby! This really is an accident 

waiting to happen. But the Mission: Impossible theme turned out to be just 

that ? bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr?s funky take on the show?s 

theme song for the Brian De Palma movie was virtually unrecognisable. And let?s 

just say that Pride: In the Name of Love wouldn?t have inspired anyone 

to invoke the name of Rev Martin Luther King.

If you are planning a theme night, the musicians should 

have some skills that lend themselves to the repertoire of choice. Otherwise, 

it is as pointless as Britney Spears trying to do Elvis. Or, just own the song, 

take it and put your stamp on it. Of course, this could be a dismal failure. Just 

take Bono?s rendition of Leonard Cohen?s Hallelujah. A complete and unmitigated 

disaster. Or, coming back to the King, you can hear Bono belt out I Can?t Help 

Falling In Love With You and know that some things are meant to be.

But you have to give the band some credit: the crowd 

at Someplace Else sure enjoyed the evening. They had ?em singing along with a 

vengeance. And that possibly defines the cover-happy crowd that throngs the ?live 

music spot? every night: 20 and 30-something yuppies, mostly men, in search of 

a good, familiar tune. It?s all good just as long as the crowd?s happy; why give 

a damn about the devotees?

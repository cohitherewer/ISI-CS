 In hotel lobbies and stadium stands, on the streets and on a high the city, true to football form, witnessed a mini Japanese invasion on Tuesday.

 The soccer bandwagon that rolled into town to fill up hotels by the dozens big, small and everything in between on the eve of Wednesdays 2006 FIFA World Cup Asian qualifying round match between India and Japan, arrived from here, there and everywhere. And if it sunk its teeth into Tandoori chicken and curry, it also paid homage at Mother House and gaped at Victoria Memorial.

 At last count, more than 1,000 Japanese fans had landed from Tokyo and Osaka, Delhi and Mumbai, Singapore and even Dhaka. A contingent turned up in true blue colours to cheer their champions at Tuesday afternoons practice session at the Yuba Bharati Krirangan. We know it is going to be a whitewash, especially after Indias 0-7 loss to us in Japan, but we still had to come here to cheer, said Nakanishi, a resident of Chiba, here from Singapore.

 Nakanishi, putting up at the team hotel Hyatt Regency, was just one of the eager faces in the VIP stands on Tuesday, hi-tech camera in hand.

 The fans, however, seemed keener to have a ball than be on the ball. Inamoto is our biggest star, we are all here to see him perform, said Jun, who has come from Saitama.

 Would somebody please tell him that Junichi Inamoto, the Fulham midfielder, is not even here, thanks to a broken leg.

 That isnt stopping the Japanese jamboree. Even in the first few hours of its stay, the India magic had caught on.

 The Indian curry is quite famous there in Japan, but here it tastes quite different and I loved it, said Yuighi Shida, here from Sendai.

 The Tandoori chicken is a delight, too. But the best thing about the country is the Indian women they look so beautiful in their saris, he smiled.

 While the afternoon found them at the stadium in full force the young and the not-so-young the morning was devoted to sightseeing.

 The Indian Museum, Mother Teresas place, Victoria Memorial figured high on the to-see list, with a grand party lined up for the evening.

 Around 40 of us have this big party at the Paragon Hotel later this evening, where we are all putting up, said Yusuke, who lives in Osaka. We are all praying for a Japanese win here, he added.

 If the big hospitality destinations like Taj Bengal, Hyatt and The Park are hosting hordes of Japanese fans, the small guest houses and lodges in central Calcutta arent doing too badly, either.

 There is even a 20-strong kid cordon that has come in from Delhi. We all study in the Japanese school there and this is one opportunity we didnt want to miss out on, said 14-year-old Takeshi, preening in the team jersey. His friend Kei pitched in: We cant wait for Wednesdays match.

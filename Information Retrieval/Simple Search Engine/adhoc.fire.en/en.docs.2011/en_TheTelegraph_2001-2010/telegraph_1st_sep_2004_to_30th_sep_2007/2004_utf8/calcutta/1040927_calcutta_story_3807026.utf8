The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Special, normal, in unison

 - Handicaps 

in the way of integrating students

 Children of Prerna Montessori in an integrated classroom at Millennium Park 

 The principal of a Ballygunge school called the mother of a two-and-a-half-year-old and thundered: ?Your son is abnormal. We don?t want him here.? 

 The boy was showing the first symptoms of autism.

 Another school in Beniapukur shut the doors on a hearing-impaired boy. The government had to step in. 

 Such skeletons ? stories of rejection and deprivation ? roll out of the cabinets of almost every school. This is tragic, considering integration of children with special needs with the ?normal? ones has been successful in the West and the law of our land gives the former the right of admission in any school. 

 The city has only one integrated school, Akshar, where normal and special children work and play together, while two Montessoris, Divyayan and Prerna, follow the inclusive method. 

 To bring the issue out in the open, a seminar was organised this weekend by Prerna, in collaboration with Teachers? Centre. 

 The government, a vital arm of the movement, was represented by K.S. Adhikaree, assistant commissioner, Office of the Commissioner (Disabilities). ?We can get a child admitted to any school by the power of the law, but what happens then?? he said. According to Adhikaree, accessibility and lack of trained teachers are proving to be hurdles. Schools have neither ramps nor special toilets. ?It would take Rs 44 crore to provide such facilities at our 38,000 schools,? he stated. 

 When the state government arranged a 21-day camp on how to deal with special children, all 15,000 teachers of mainstream schools demanded leave with pay, DA and TA first. 

 There are other problems as well. Principal of Prerna Nandita Agarwala faced guardians of ?normal? students worrying whether handicaps were contagious. Uma Ahmed, who was in the human rights commission when the disability act was framed, recounted how the teacher made an effort when four hearing-impaired children joined Class IV ? turning to them so they could lip-read and slowing down. ?But it becomes a problem in higher classes.? 

 A message was driven home by Madhumita Jajodia from Durgapur, who had to fight family and society to get her hearing-impaired son a decent education. ?How much do we parents allow our special children to integrate with the family?? she asked the forum of school principals and parents. 

 Small steps are being taken by mainstream schools. For instance, The Heritage School brings in experts to detect symptoms and special educators. But for most parents, this is too little too late.

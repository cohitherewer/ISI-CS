The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Back on the bandit?s trail

 So what if he?s dead, Veerappan is still very much a celluloid draw. After Ram Gopal Varma gave him a big-screen debut in Jungle, the prolific maker is back again, this time with a film on the sandalwood bandit who was shot dead by the Special Task Force last month. This time though, he won?t be directing the film. The directorial baton passes on to Shimit Amin, who made a critically acclaimed debut with Ab Tak Chappan.

 ?We have just changed the title,? Shimit told Metro.?It was earlier called Let?s Catch Veerappan and now it is titled Let?s Kill Veerappan. Apart from that everything remains the same. Whether we are going to use the recent killing in our promotion and marketing of the film, we have to meet and decide.?

 The film is being adapted from the book Veerappan: The Untold Story, written by Srinath Raghuram. ?There are four chapters on how three simple villagers hatch a plan to catch Veerappan on their own for the reward money. I found the story very interesting and Veerappan by himself is quite a fascinating character. So I went ahead and decided to film it. The book has been adapted by Sandeep Srivastava,? said Shimit.

 A US-based film editor, Shimit broke new grounds by making Ab Tak Chappan without a single song and without the conventional melodrama so typical of Bollywood. ?Let?s Kill Veerappan will be made with the same sensibilities and the same film language. The whole idea is to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. While I do not mind them in other films, I do not need songs and dances to entertain my viewers,? he explained.

 Shimit also doesn?t see any room for comparison with Varma?s own Veerappan view, Jungle. ?It will be totally different. That was more about the man. This is about a chapter in his life.?

 The two-hour-long film has been shot in the hilly jungles in and around Maharashtra and features a newcomer as Veerappan. ?Apart from him, there is Rajpal Yadav, Aditya Srivastava and Prakash Rao. There are no stars because they do not fit any of the characters,? said Shimit.

 The director doesn?t see the death of the bandit having an adverse box-office impact. ?Our film should release some time mid next year. I am sure everyone will forget this whole Veerappan death thing within the next couple of months.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cable clean-up set 90 days

 - Govt to check subscriber base, no blackouts in interim

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 It could take less time to clean up the cable mess than to cover up potholed roads. Prodded by the regular small-screen disputes affecting viewers and taking a cue from Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai)?s recent recommendations pushing for more state government involvement, a 90-day cable deadline has been set.

 January 31, 2005, is the D-Day, and the time for the trade starts now. Broadcasters, multi-system operators (MSO) and cable operators met state government officials at Calcutta Information Centre on Friday afternoon, where principal secretary Arun Bhattacharya spelt out the plan of action.

 ?Consumer interest is the key in our attempt at laying down the rules of the game,? Bhattacharya told Metro after chairing the hour-long meeting. ?We will ensure that there is transparency at all levels,? he added.

 For this, the government is undertaking a drive to assess the number of subscribers in the CMDA area. Its ?administrative forces? ? including officers-in-charge of thanas, district magistrates and sub-divisional officers ? will be involved in the ?comprehensive survey? that starts November 1.

 A ?steering committee? will be formed by October 31, comprising representatives from the industry and the government to oversee the process. Operators and master control rooms (run by operator groups) must declare their subscriber base to the government within three months. A random sampling may be conducted to check the authenticity.

 The rider for broadcasters, however, is no switchoff or price increase. ?We have requested the broadcasters not to hike prices during the assessment period,? Bhattacharya said. Also, new channels launched during the period must be dealt with separately.

 What happens in case of disputes? ?We will not intervene in market forces,? Bhattacharya clarified. ?The parties must resolve the differences themselves, with help from the committee and an arbitrator, if necessary.?

 Case in point: the recent dispute between RPG Netcom and SitiCable?s Calcutta Communications, that forced an independent auditor to be put in place. ?We welcome the pro-active steps from the government,? SitiCable national head Jawahar Goel said after the meeting.

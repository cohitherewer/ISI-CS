The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Funk fare in feet fashion

From neons to pastels, strappy slip-ons 

to bulky boots, the shoe scene is happening like never before. Himika Chaudhuri 

finds out how you can put your best foot forward, in style

Braid it or bead it. Add some shine or sew on some 

sequins. Go for the casual slip-on or the sexy tie up. The long neglected shoe 

scene in the city is finally catching up with the rest of the wardrobe. From brightly-coloured 

straps to soles in geometric shapes, the hues and designs have never been so wacky. 

Now you can match your shoes with the colour of your hair, your contact lens or 

your car.

While slips-ons are a huge hit among college and office 

goers, for the party people its the stilettoes and tie-ups that are making feet 

the happiest.

The Calcutta shoe market, especially the womens 

section, has suddenly gone the Delhi and Mumbai way, where more style is available 

for less money. Now one doesnt have to shell out a grand to own a pair of eye-catching 

footwear, says Deepak Lal, a shoe store owner in New Market (new complex) whos 

been selling slip-ons for Rs 100 onwards like hot cakes.

Most of the shoes are extremely jazzy, either in 

the choice of colour or embellishment. The new range that is available now has 

to be worn with a lot of style, feels Anamika Narang of Footsee in Metro Plaza.

In the forever-favourite category, boots still come 

out tops with leather ones in black, white, brown and an occasional maroon booting 

out any other contender. Boots with sequins are the new rage, adds Anamika.

A new, yet popular addition in formal footwear are 

low-ankled covered shoes, with pointed toes and low heels. The advantage of these 

shoes is that they are not as high as the leather boots and are perfect for the 

weather here. They also give the formal look that many corporate women opt for, 

says Dulal Kumar of a New Market shoe store.

With more available for less, this is the right time 

for the shoe buff to build her collection. For a quick reckoner of whats hot 

on the shoe racks right now, read on.

Boot bargain

Boots still rule the formal footwear section. These 

lend a confident gait and a smart look. They work well on the party circuit as 

well and can be spotted with skirts, long or short. Those who prefer the easy-to-wear 

variety pop into a pair of ankle high boots, just right with formal trousers or 

long skirts.

Price: Rs 2,000 onwards

Strappy story

The strappier the better is the mantra right now. 

But get ready first to double the number of visits you usually pay to the salon 

for a pedicure to make sure your feet do the shoes justice. Whether you choose 

flats or the pointed heels, more skin show is the idea.

The no-heel look goes well for casual occasions or 

if you are in chilled-out holiday mode. Often called Hawaii slippers, these shoes 

with delicate straps come in basic as well as bright colours with various designs 

on the base. For party wear, the tie-ups with leather laces, sometimes going all 

the way up the calf, lends a dressy look. Available in colours like bright red, 

ocean blue and pastel green, these can complement a gown perfectly.

Available at: Metro Plaza, New Market (new 

complex), Forum

Price: Rs 100 onwards

Buckle up

The shining silver buckle adds a chic look to a range 

of flats and low-heeled footwear. The options are to either go for the low-heeled 

slip-on with one light colour on the base and a contrasting shade for the thick 

strap, like blood red, black or brown. Or go for flats with a colourful base and 

a contrasting leather strap with a shiny buckle. Try teaming them with capris 

or jeans, for a casual outing with friends.

Available at: Metro Plaza, Vardaan Market and 

New Market (new complex)

Price: Rs 100 onwards

Bead boom

Beads and seashells are the latest additions on the 

racks this season and are expected to do very well in the pre-Puja shopping blitz. 

Used liberally to embellish straps, you are likely to get everything from a slip-on 

to high heels with beadwork on them. The colours of the base are usually in funky 

shades, also taking in some quieter pastels.

Available at: Metro Plaza, New Market (old 

and new complex)

Price: Rs 250 to Rs 695

Sequin saga

The sequin-embellished slippers are reserved for a 

really special evening out. Available in rich colours to match the darker colours 

most women opt for during dressy evening dos, these flaunt everything from zari 

work to rhinestones to sequins on wide straps. Maintaining these might be 

a little difficult, as one sequin lost could mar the entire pair. So wear judiciously.

Available at: Metro Plaza

Price: Rs 725 onwards

Cork uncorked

For real comfort while still looking very fashionable, 

these are the perfect match with western wear. The base is made of cork, which 

earns them the name cork soles. Funky spray-painted designs are doing the rounds 

now, as are silver or golden buckles, adding a touch of fun to the sandals.

Available at: Metro Plaza

Price: Rs 595 onwards

Mojri mania

The Jaipur-speciality leather jutis and mojris 

with muted or colourful thread-work are the best thing going for the ethnic yet 

stylish look. But be warned: these are completely inappropriate for the rainy 

season as they collapse at the very sight of a puddle. Keep them on hand for later 

in the year.

complex), Forum

Price: Rs 300 onwards

 hile Murshidabad lost crops worth Rs 100 crore, Nadia?s share is Rs 77 crore. North 24-Parganas lost Rs 82-crore-worth of crops, Burdwan Rs 32 crore and Birbhum Rs 21 crore. Apart from the five districts that are worst hit, damage to crop in other 13 districts has been around 20 per cent. ?We had expected a loss of 80 per cent, but the actual damage has been around 60 per cent,? said Dhabaleshwar Konar, director, agriculture.

 Prasanta Chaki, private security guard deployed at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, was arrested on Monday on charges of molestation.

The victim, in her twenties and married, complained that Chaki had offered to help her when she was looking for an attendant for her pregnant sister. He lured the woman to the fourth floor of the building and tried to molest her. She, however, freed herself from his clutches and fled downstairs.

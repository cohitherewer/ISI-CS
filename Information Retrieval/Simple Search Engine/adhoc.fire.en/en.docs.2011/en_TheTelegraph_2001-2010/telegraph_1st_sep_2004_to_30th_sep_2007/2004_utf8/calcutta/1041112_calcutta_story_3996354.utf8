CHILDREN'S DAY

Harry 

ho!

Harry Potter maniacs all over the globe are waiting 

with bated breath for the sixth installment of the saga. Here?s some gossip about 

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, which will give fans something 

to talk about before J.K. Rowling takes pity on us and publishes it. Firstly, 

who is the half blood prince? Rowling says it?s not Harry or Voldemort. The only 

two known half-bloods besides are Seamus and Tonks. But Tonks is a girl. The description 

doesn?t match Seamus. An excerpt from the book doing the rounds reads something 

like: ?He looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of grey in his mane 

of tawny hair and bushy eyebrows. He had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of 

wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked 

with a slight limp.? There will be little romance for Harry and he will not get 

back with Cho. There will be a new character called Maclaggon. There will be more 

on Snape and Sirius. What happens to Pettigrew will become clear. There will be 

a new Minister for Magic (not Mr Weasley). And life will get tougher for everyone, 

especially Harry.

 The little girls of Kidz Konclave gave bhai 

phota to some underprivileged boys, and then they sang, danced and played 

together as part of early Children?s Day celebrations at the creche on November 

9. Joining them was actor and musician Ratul Shankar, who spent time with the 

toddlers. They all came dressed to the hilt, in party gear and fancy frills, and 

even saris and dhotis. Some adults did join in, but it?s the kids who had 

a blast. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

Drug dilemma

With drug and alcohol abuse among teenagers becoming 

a norm, not an aberration, parents are panicking. Alarmingly, the average age 

for experimenting with drugs like cannabis and opium is now 14. Worse, many are 

curious even earlier. So who is responsible? Parents prefer to blame outside forces, 

overlooking their own indulgences. Other factors cited are lack of supervision 

in schools, bad role models, films and drug peddlers. While these are contributors, 

they are not the only influences. That would be saying that children are mere 

victims of circumstances, exonerating them from the accountability of their choices. 

Adults continue to look for answers, but the children?s explanations tend to point 

towards themselves. Say no to drugs today for a better tomorrow.

Pen the pain 

Most people don?t keep a diary. But it does a world 

of good. You never lose track of what?s going on in your life. Earlier entries 

unravel mysteries of the present. The diaries of yesteryears are comic relief 

when you?re down. It helps get rid of doubts and find solutions. Teenagers often 

can?t trust anyone. Writing helps. I?ve pulled myself out of trouble several times 

by writing about it. Once you put whatever?s on your mind on paper, you?ll find 

answers hidden in the words. I?ve filled up two lockable diaries and am onto my 

third. (I feel safer keeping my secrets locked!). If anyone doubts me, read Diary 

Of A Young Girl by Anne Frank.

Stand together

After Dhananjoy Chatterjee, it?s Veerappan?s turn 

to attract the arclights. The media has been going overboard with news of Veerappan?s 

murder. He was an evil man spreading fear and destruction. Isn?t a bandit like 

him expected to meet a fate like this? Veerappan was a disgrace to humanity, but 

getting rid of one Veerappan is no reason for us to relax. There are bigger Veerappans 

in the guise of politicians and people in important positions who exploit us and 

play with our sentiments. I plead with the youth, who are the future, to stand 

hand-in-hand against such unruly practices.

Vice vs Virtue

The two headstrong opponents, Zaki Mubarki and Md 

Tarique Nisar, have been continuously occupying 6x9 cm of space in this column 

sharing thoughts that are obsolete and not pragmatic in today?s times. Their opinions 

include what Raffhat Mir is like and how brutal Dhananjoy Chatterjee was. Well, 

the government of UK has shown a lot of concern in the Hannah Foster case and 

we should respect that rather than present jump to conclusions. These enlightened 

individuals had earlier also spoken of the Best Bakery case. My advice is to immediately 

read the papers, since they have drifted away from the issue by mentioning a lot 

of irrelevant things. This highlights their poor understanding. If these philosophers 

think that the Indian government is slow, then I wish them luck to be future President 

or prime minister, for some first-hand experience. It is easy to criticise, difficult 

to analyse.

Counterpoint

nIt?s unbelievable that a simple letter is beyond 

Michelle Paskar?s understanding. Her childish attitude is also evident in her 

letter, as no one supports Dhananjoy, neither does anybody disrespect women. It?s 

useless to carry on this argument, because I know my views and am very clear about 

them. I don?t need to prove them. It seems that some people don?t want this matter 

to die a natural death. The conclusion, in fact, remains the same. First Raffhat 

and now Michelle need a re-definition of their views and should try to accept 

the fact that punishing one criminal won?t change the country.

Your 

Answer

I have seen you in search of an answer

You have looked for it among the stars

? in the lines of your palm. 

With a thousand questions on your mind

I have heard you knock on closed doors

Echoes have faded 

Memories have died? 

Still it haunts you to find 

Today when stars are unseen 

I will tell you what I mean 

And tomorrow when the ways are long 

You will understand the song 

There are many things under the skies 

Never seen by waking eyes 

Its hard to tell where reality ends 

And illusion begins? 

They blend and then they separate 

They leave you to search for mirages 

Stolen treasures? broken dreams? 

?woken eyes 

the world far and wide 

are void of riddles you seek to solve. 

Perhaps you will know 

Perhaps you need to go 

Into the hidden undiscovered continent 

Within yourself? 

Maybe you will find your answers 

If you just stop? wait ? and listen 

? to the sound of your own heartbeat

And 

Cover Me In That White

And wash me in wet earth, 

As the hand rubs my eye, 

I won?t grimace, 

Smell of earth in my lips?

And now cover me in that white sheet 

Wrap me from head to toe,

Hide my soft smile, 

It is mine only. 

I want the seven fires 

Lower me now, 

Say your prayers, 

And sprinkle earth on me. 

I am afraid to sprinkle 

Do I smile at you? 

No, beyond you?. 

Pay my debts 

I was an angel once.

Images...

Rhythms come many, moments come few, 

Long run of sorrows, happiness seems new; 

Passers pass the flowers, eyes on the road, 

Lost the mind they know not whence; 

Memories of those moments left abroad, 

How sweet t?was; Now parted by a fence. 

Even the pastures once, seemed to hail, 

The colour of spring now ?ppears so pale; 

I know not how, we lost in the crowd, 

We had faith, we?re so vowed. 

Those days and hours touch me often, 

I ramble why, they now not happen.

Yet, for me there?re memories to cherish, 

A priceless possession, until I perish; 

Seen so many here and learnt from one. 

There same a gale,the works left undone. 

How could time be so cruel indeed, 

Left no soil to be sown with a seed!

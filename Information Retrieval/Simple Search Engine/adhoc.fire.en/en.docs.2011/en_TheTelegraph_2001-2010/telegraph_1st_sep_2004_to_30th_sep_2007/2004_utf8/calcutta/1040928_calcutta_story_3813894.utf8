The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Test of cricket talk

 If they were offering you the chance to sing your heart out or display your acting skills so long, now it?s time to speak your mind. But Harsha ki Khoj (HKK) will be no Popstars or Cinestars Ki Khoj, assures ESPN STAR Sports (ESS), which is conducting the contest.

The hunt, as the name suggests, is on for the next 

Harsha Bhogle to hold forth on air. The big catch: a lucrative one-year contract 

as a presenter with the sports duo. ?There is enormous talent available now and 

the contest will provide an opportunity to bring that out,? feels Bhogle (in picture 

with Sourav Ganguly and Geoffrey Boycott at the former?s para puja). ?I 

dreamt of being a commentator, but it wasn?t possible to make it a profession 

then. Now it is.?

 To get started, contestants need to call up a particular number and record a one-minute commentary piece on an imaginary situation. Since the lines were thrown open on August 21, around 80,000 minutes of messages have been recorded. ?So far, the best response has been from the north and west,? says Joy Bhattacharjya, executive producer of ESPN Software India, ?but Calcutta is doing fairly well, too.?

 ESS is also throwing its doors open to the fairer sex through HKK. ?Interestingly, a lot of the callers have been women,? shares Bhattacharjya. A significant section of the calls has been recorded in Hindi ? ESS? new area of emphasis ? as well.

 On the basis of the voice capsule, the pick among participants would be invited to Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Lucknow, Chennai or Calcutta for the regional round. At each of these venues, a panel of three judges would further shortlist candidates. Judges will include the likes of Wasim Akram, Ravi Shastri, Alan Wilkins and Sunil Gavaskar, as well as ESPN presenters like Jason Dasey and Darain Shahidi.

 What will the wise men look for? Presence of mind tops the must-have list. ?Suppose the screen goes blank in front of the commentator, he must be able to stay in control of the situation,? says Bhattacharjya. Knowledge of the game and a passion for sports are musts. ?I think too much emphasis is put on whether the person has played the game,? feels Bhogle. For this contest, that would be secondary. ?And don?t forget sense of humour. That?s essential,? adds Bhogle.

 Candidates at the audition would have to present short programmes and write scripts (in short, ?everything that is required of a live anchor?) to prove themselves. Shortlisted candidates from the city auditions would then be called for a round in the ESPN studios.

 A show capturing the excitement and emotions of HKK is slated to go on air in end-November. Starting with the regional auditions, the TV series will have behind-the-scenes footage and build up to the selection of the winner. So, if you haven?t done it already, dial 123 from your Hutch mobile or 646 from your Airtel mobile and record the message. The line goes blank on September 28.

 College shut before debut

 - Last-minute affiliation denial despite superior infrastructure

 MITA MUKHERJEE 

 A private college in Howrah, with ?the best infrastructure in the state?, has closed down even before it could admit its first batch of students.

 Agrasain College was supposed to teach B.Com honours and BA honours (English and Hindi) courses from this academic year. But in a ?stunning? last-minute decision, Calcutta University has denied affiliation to the college.

 The denial has shocked local residents as well as students and teachers. Members of the Radha Krishna Education Trust, set up by local businessmen to run the college, claimed that they had launched the initiative only after getting the green signal from the higher education department, West Bengal Council of Higher Education and Calcutta University.

 ?We have completed all formalities at the three levels. We have also deposited Rs 10 lakh as security money. With the denial of the affiliation, we have lost all our savings,? lamented Basudeb Tikmany, who heads the trust. 

 The trust has invested Rs 2 crore for setting up the sprawling campus and the infrastructure. 

 Members claimed that throughout their correspondence with the university over the past two years, they had been assured that affiliation would not be a problem if the college had the required infrastructure.

 ?We had been informing the university about our progress from time to time. But after the final inspection, the university said that the affiliation could not be granted as the college had no provision for teaching professional courses,? said a trust member. 

 Surprisingly, the university authorities, in the final inspection report, commended the ?superior infrastructure the trust has been able to build? and conceded that no other college in the state had similar facilities. 

 According to university sources, what prompted the authorities to withhold affiliation was a recent debate among Syndicate members on the self-financed colleges. 

 Some of the members had argued that the university could grant affiliation only to state-aided colleges.

 ?The Senate has already discussed the matter and recommended an amendment to the statute. Once it is in place, the issue will be resolved,? said Shyamapada Pal, member of the Senate as well as the state higher education council.

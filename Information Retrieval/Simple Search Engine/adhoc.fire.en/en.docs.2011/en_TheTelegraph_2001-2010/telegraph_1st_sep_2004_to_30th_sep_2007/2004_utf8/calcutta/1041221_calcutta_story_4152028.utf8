The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bright is right

Whites and creams have given way to a riot 

of hues in home interiors, finds Smita Roy Chowdhury

Whites, creams and a few pastels ? the palette in 

home interiors was restricted to these hues till about five years back. Be it 

the walls, the upholstery or the furniture, brighter shades were strictly avoided 

when it came to doing up the house.

The concept of all things bright is steadily creeping 

up on the Calcutta householder. Reds, purples and oranges have popped out from 

the wardrobes and made their way to the walls, doors, windows and even furniture.

Says interior designer Gopa Ray, ?People with traditional 

views will not be able to accept bright colours inside the house, but these are 

very much in fashion in home d?cor. There are thousands of shades to choose from 

and one can mix and match for the desired effect. But one has to be comfortable 

with bright colours to have them around on the walls and live with them all the 

time. Otherwise, they?re best avoided.?

Colour effect

Just as a dash of colour in your outfit can lift up 

your spirits on a dreary monsoon day, bright hues inside the house can lend it 

a nice and happy feel. ?In a city like Calcutta where one sees a lot of dirty 

roads and the pollution level is so high, coming back to a house with bright-coloured 

interiors lifts the mood instantly. You definitely feel happier if your immediate 

surroundings are bright and cheerful,? feels interior designer Manjari Sahay.

For entrepreneur Nandita Burman, the colours of a 

house ?reflect the personality of its occupants?. ?Your house is what you are, 

it?s an extension of your personality. I love bright colours in general, and have 

been painting my house in all sorts of wacky shades for the past eight years. 

Oranges, mauves, purples and greens ? you would find all of these on my walls.?

Unusual colours are also a way of making your house 

look different, without having to spend a fortune on decorating it, adds Nandita. 

?Bright colours lend a character to a room and helps it stand out from a similar 

room done up in pale shades.? 

Size matters

While deciding on the colour code, one must follow 

a few basic principles, dependent mostly on the dimensions of the room. The thumb 

rule is to paint one of the walls in the vibrant colour and the rest in either 

a paler shade belonging to the same family or white and off-white.

In case of a small room, dark shades like red, terracotta, 

purple and deep blue should be avoided as these make the room shrink. ?Dark colours 

in a small room will visually bring the walls closer and hence make it look smaller. 

So, it?s better to go for bright and soothing hues of yellow and green here,? 

says Manjari.

If one does want to use some dark colours in a small 

room, the paint should be restricted to a really small wall, a groove in a wall 

or just a pillar or two. Dark colours should also be necessarily avoided in rooms 

that don?t get much sunlight.

The scope to play around with colours is definitely 

much wider in a big room. Here, one can choose just about any shade for one of 

the walls and co-ordinate it with the rest. ?I am using lots of red, orange, purple, 

grape, magenta, mauve, deep blue, golden yellow and green these days. There can 

be various combinations one can dabble with,? says Manjari.

Room wise

A riot of orange might work wonders to liven up your 

living room, but the same shade might be a little too loud for the bedroom. So, 

the colour you choose should suit the requirement of the room. Says Siddhartha 

Roy, lead vocalist of Cactus, ?I just love colours. So I have included a lot of 

vibrant hues in my home as well. I have done up the adda room in yellow, 

orange and grey. It provides a lot of freshness to the ambience and the colour 

code is in sync with the room since I basically chill out with friends here.?

Nandita has followed the same principle in her home. 

?Our den is the family room where we watch TV, work out on the treadmill and spend 

the maximum time together. So we have made this the brightest spot in the house. 

But our bedrooms are all painted in whites and creams,? she says. One of the walls 

of the den is parrot green with a purple embellishment matching the upholstery.

Manjari recommends soothing shades of yellow, olive 

and blue in the bedrooms, with the darker hues of red, magenta and orange reserved 

for the lobby and the drawing room. ?Colours like golden yellow that have a sunshine 

effect, or a refreshing green which will soothe the eye, are ideal for the bedroom,? 

she explains.

Match making

Co-ordinating the colour of the walls with the furniture 

and upholstery of a room is absolutely essential. Says Gopa, ?Dark colours look 

better in a room with a straight-line or minimalist look. If you have elaborate 

period furniture and lots of artifacts vying for attention, you should avoid dark 

walls.?

Manjari agrees: ?You can?t do justice to either the 

wall colour or the furniture if you place a walnut-coloured piece against a dark 

wall. This has to be set against light walls, whereas dark walls will look good 

if co-ordinated with lighter-hued furniture like the ones made from rubber wood.?

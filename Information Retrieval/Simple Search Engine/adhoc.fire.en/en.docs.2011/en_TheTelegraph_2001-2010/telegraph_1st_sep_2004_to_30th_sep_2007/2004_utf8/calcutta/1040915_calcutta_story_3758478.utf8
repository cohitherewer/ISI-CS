The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Township address shift for zoo, jail 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government is drawing up plans to shift Alipore zoo and Alipore Central jail from Alipore

 How about the Alipore zoo not being located in Alipore any more? Or Alipore Central jail moving from its present address? 

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is planning to relocate the zoo and the prison to Baruipur, on the city?s southern fringes. 

 The proposals were discussed on Tuesday, during a presentation by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) before the chief minister. 

 ?We were preparing for quite some time to relocate the zoo. The pollution in the neighbourhood affects the animals,? urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said after the meeting.

 ?And with a new township coming up in Baruipur, there are plans to shift the entire set-up of South 24-Parganas district administration from Alipore. We?re also planning to shift the prison and use the sprawling premises for some other purposes,? he added. 

 The government is yet to decide how the proposed township will be developed or the total area on which it will come up. But it will surely have enough space for various types of industries and establishments, the minister asserted.

 During the presentation, CMDA officials mentioned that the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass would be linked to the Baruipur township. ?The cost of laying the link road has been estimated at Rs 30 crore. The amount has been sanctioned under the megacity project,? Bhattacharya added.

 On the proposed shift of the district headquarters, the prison and the zoo, he said: ?It?s still at a preliminary stage of planning. We have not yet identified the new locations.?

 Bhattacharya also disclosed that an industrial park would be set up on a 50-acre plot off the Kona Expressway. ?Anyone can set up shop there, but the enterprise has to be eco-friendly,? he stressed. 

 Another project on the table is developing a logistics hub at the Kona truck terminal. The terminal will be upgraded with several modern facilities.

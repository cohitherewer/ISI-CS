 Uncharted direction: The Bidyadhari meanders by

The state government acted irresponsibly and unethically 

by admitting students to the first-year MBBS course at Midnapore and SSKM medical 

colleges under the non-resident Indian (NRI) quota (Medical muddle at crisis point, 

November 11). 

 What makes the decision even more irresponsible is the fact that students on the joint entrance examination (JEE) merit list were thus shut out of their rightful places by this move. 

 Now that the Supreme Court has ruled that only 30 students be allowed to complete the course, the educational careers of the others are in jeopardy. While the court has its reasons for cancelling their admission, merely refunding the money to the students and showing them the door is not the solution. 

 The state government is solely responsible for the impasse and it should take act to assuage the fears of the students who suddenly find themselves in no-man?s land for no fault of their?s. 

 Most of the 75 students have opted for medicine at the cost of the other courses they were studying. They have attended MBBS classes for three months as well. 

 It is no wonder that they went on hunger strike at the SSKM Hospital. It appears that their only ray of hope is the chief minister, who visited the hospital and persuaded the students to call of the strike. 

 But the chief minister?s compassion does ring a little hollow as his government is the agency responsible for bringing the career of 69 bright students to the brink of a ruin. 

 It is difficult to find a positive side to this sordid mess, but hopefully, the state education department has learnt a lesson and would think twice before acting so whimsically while admitting students. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

Apropos ?Maps missing?, November 13, detailed maps of the districts of the state, clearly showing railroads, highways, towns, districts, state and international boundaries are not available in the market. 

 From atlases published by foreign publishers, I can tell my children about the courses of the Mississippi, Amazon, Nile or Huang Ho, but when it comes to the courses of Churni, Mundeshwari, Pagla or Matla, I remain dumbfounded. 

 Record rooms of district collectorates maintain detailed district maps, but apart from being restricted, those are mostly outdated as they do not show changing course of rivers or char formation, as is often the case in Malda and Murshidabad districts. It will be excellent if National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organisation updates such maps and markets them widely. 

Tapan Pal,

Batanagar. 

Apropos the article ?Talk tips for marriage blues?, November 4, faith is not enough to make a marriage work; one must also be reasonable. It is wonderful that workshops are being organised in the city to help couples with troubled marriages. Such workshops offer a glimmer of hope to many a family. 

Anil Kumar Sen,

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.

The report ?Stage on resurrection route? (November 6) lights up an image of a bright future for Tapan Theatre. This is another step towards the resurrection of our glorious past on the stage, after the gates of Star Theatre were thrown open. Tapan Theatre had its hey days when actors like Satya Bandyopadhyay, Tarun Kumar and Ganesh Mukherjee frequented here. Thanks to Samar Mitra, it will be back on our orbit. This is not just a question of renovation, but of reminding people of our own culture. 

Abhijit Chakraborty, 

Howrah.

Apropos the article ?Hot on hero?s heels?, November 10, the media hype generated by newspapers published from Calcutta about Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly shows no sign of decreasing. This hype has greatly contributed to the gradual decline of his batting form. 

Prahlad Agarwala,

Majdia, Nadia. 

Apropos the report ?Another look at Bagbazar?s past?, November 6, it is well-known that Bagbazar, one of the oldest parts of the city, has a rich cultural heritage. Unfortunately, very little has been done to preserve that heritage. Even books on the subject are difficult to obtain. Given the scenario, the attempt to make the present generation aware of the glorious past of the area is heartening. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee,

Nayapatty Road. 

 The article ?Mixed menu on match eve?, November 13, made for interesting reading. The One-Day International between Pakistan and India to commemorate the Board of Control of Cricket in India?s platinum jubilee indeed added colour to the city?s sporting history. Three cheers to Jagmohan Dalmiya for giving us an occasion to celebrate. 

T.R. Anand, 

Budge Budge.

Apropos the article ?Rate spurt in shoot at site?, November 9, it is a positive sign that film-makers are rushing to the city for shoots. The government is no doubt delighted at coming across this rather novel source of revenue. However, it should ensure that the revenue earned thus is utilised for the maintenance and beautification of the city landmarks 

Govind Bakshi,

Budge Budge. 

 Apropos the report ?Glimpses of guts and glory?, November 9, it is quite extraordinary how boys and girls who are not even in their teens are defying all odds and coming out on top. I wholeheartedly applaud The Telegraph for providing encouragement to these little heroes and heroines with prizes. May their tribe prosper. 

Piyal Mukherjee, 

Lake Town.

Chirantan, Tanushree Shankar?s tribute to Ananda Shankar, will be staged on January 18 and 19 instead of in December, as was mentioned in the City Lights item entitled ?Big B baritone for Ananda? (December 12). The venue, Kalamandir, remains unchanged.

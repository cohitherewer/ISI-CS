The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Glimpse of good life

 Get a life, says the catchline of the channel. And going by the response in the first three weeks of its screen life, viewers have grabbed it.

 Life, as shown on Discovery?s new channel Travel amp; Living, is all about lifestyle round the world, from travel (still from Thirsty Traveller below) to d?cor to food. Says Pankaj Saxena, vice-president, programming, ?Lifestyle as a content has so far been neglected on television. The destination has been fragmented, with a cookery show appearing on one channel and a travel show on another. That is why people and advertisers are reacting so positively.?

Programmes on Discovery Travel amp; Living have an 

innovative take on even familiar content. For instance, Cooking for Love 

(picture left) is based on a reversal of the maxim: ?The way to a woman?s 

heart is through her stomach?. Three men with limited culinary skills rustle up 

a dish to win a date with a woman who will taste their efforts and go with her 

palate?s pick. ?The cookery programmes on other channels are instructional, with 

low production quality. Our shows will be different,? points out Saxena. Cooking 

for Love (Tuesday, 10 pm) thus is more about relationships than recipes. 

 Kylie Kwong?s Cooking with Heart and Soul is the closest one gets to kitchen tips. ?Even here, we treat cooking as an extension of one?s personality with the camera following her even as she goes shopping for ingredients.? 

 Another show set to wow gadget freaks is He?s Gotta Have It on Mondays at 10 pm. ?The Indian upscale population is ready to consume the best in the world. This show tells them about products that are about to hit the market.? There are celebrity guests, like former England cricketer Phil Tufnell and James Bond villain Goldie.

 For golf lovers, ?the biggest emerging lifestyle sport?, there is Golf Clubs with Tim Brook Taylor on Monday at 10.30 pm. An expert partners Taylor in a game and offers him tips on perfecting the swing, exercises to improve the game and extracting the most out of the course. 

 Indians, Saxena points out, are good with cards and during Diwali the stakes reach sky-high over teen patti. They will now be introduced to poker. ?On World Poker Tour, a card game is filmed like a football match, with multiple cameras. A flycam reads the hand of each player letting viewers anticipate his move.? The hardcore action comes from the Caribbean poker paradise Aruba where four professionals fight for $250,000. 

 Saxena confirms that there is no scope of the new channel?s content overlapping with Discovery. ?One is about lifestyle entertainment and the other about factual entertainment.?

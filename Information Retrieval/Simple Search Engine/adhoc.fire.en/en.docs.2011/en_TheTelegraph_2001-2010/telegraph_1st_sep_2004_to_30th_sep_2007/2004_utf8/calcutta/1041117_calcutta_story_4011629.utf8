 A Writers? tryst for top tech team

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: IT?s on the agenda

 Forty-eight hours before the bandh on December 3 ? the last in a row of three successive shutdowns ? the country?s top tech team will troop into Writers? Buildings for an exclusive session with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 The December 1 meeting with the who?s who of India?s knowledge economy ? representing the executive council of Nasscom ? will be the first of its kind for Bhattacharjee.

 ?We have been requesting Nasscom for some time to hold its executive council meeting in the city. Not only have they agreed to hold the meeting this time, the members will also call on the chief minister to discuss issues related to West Bengal,? state IT minister Manab Mukherjee confirmed on Tuesday.

 ?This is indeed a boost for the state?s image,? added the minister, who will also be present at the meeting.

 The team to Writers? will include the likes of Kiran Karnik, president, Nasscom, Nandan Nilekani, CEO, Infosys, Jerry Rao, chairman, Nasscom and CEO, Mphasis BFL Ltd, Roopen Roy, managing director, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Bhaskar Pramanik, managing director, Sun Microsystems, India.

 They will all be here to participate in Infocom 2004, the annual IT exposition organised by Nasscom and Businessworld.

 ?We are in the midst of getting final confirmations and so can?t give all the names. But we are sure some key members of the executive council will meet the chief minister,? confirmed Karnik.

 Nasscom?s executive council, the highest decision-making body of the association, meets at least once every quarter in Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore. ?But since many of them will be in Calcutta for Infocom 2004, we decided to hold a meeting and also take the opportunity of calling on the chief minister,? added Karnik.

 Roy of PricewaterhouseCoopers, eastern India?s sole representative in the council, said: ?I can?t comment on the agenda for the meeting with the chief minister, but the focus will clearly be on Bengal. We are looking forward to the interaction.?

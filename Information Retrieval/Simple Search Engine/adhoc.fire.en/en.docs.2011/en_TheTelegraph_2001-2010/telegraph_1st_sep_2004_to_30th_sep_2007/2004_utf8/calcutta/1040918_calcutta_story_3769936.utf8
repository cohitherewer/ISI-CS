Style snip for cool kids

Most of what I really need to know about how to 

live and what to do and how to be I learned not at the top of the graduate-school 

mountain but here in the sandpile at Sunday School.

? Robert Fulghum, All I Really Need 

to Know I Learned in Kindergarten

If a bad hair day is a woman?s (and man?s) worst nightmare, 

better to start her (and him) off with a hair-care regimen early. 

With kids becoming increasingly fashion conscious, 

beauty salons have all eyes on tiny heads. Finally, there are places to go for 

a quick snip and style that know just how to pamper a child?s whim and fancy.

June Tomkyns, the Ballygunge Circular Road salon, 

is the pioneer in the segment, with a special section going as far as body massages, 

tattoos and colourful nail designs. 

?We didn?t want kids near the smells of wax, bleach 

or chemicals. We wanted them to be in a colourful zone of their own with toys 

and candies and little car-shaped chairs where they can sit and have a haircut,? 

says Sharon Tomkyns.

Tempting treats

For this salon, the treat at the end of the session 

with scissors is a lollipop. The cutting sheets are shaped to suit a child?s body, 

as are the combs and brushes. Rosemary has been a children?s hairdresser for years, 

and has seen kiddie clients come back as grown up married women. With the expert 

touch, an oil massage (which could take a mother hours of cajoling) is agreed 

upon in a matter of minutes.

Nails are also given their due with little stickers 

to decorate little fingernails. While kids are distracted by books to read and 

toys to play with, their hair can also be braided with little crystals to add 

that extra sparkle.

The newly-opened salon in Alipore, Tressbay, also 

has a dedicated kids section. ?I decided to open the children?s salon when I realised 

what a hassle it was, as a parent, to finish off a tiring day at work and then 

dress up my daughter for a birthday party or family function,? says Darshini Sanghvi 

of Tressbay.

?With a little warmth and affection, they will allow 

you to cut their hair or style it,? she adds. Inspired by models and actresses, 

girls prefer wearing their hair long. But a bar of chocolate (or chips in case 

the tears start flowing) and a few smiles, and the mushroom bob seems far more 

attractive. The boys, too, want to copy their screen idols. Currently, the craze 

is spikes and gelled hair (even though the gel lasts for just one wash, they are 

happy for far longer).

Tattoo tales

Apart from hairstyling, which is priced between Rs 

100 and Rs 250, depending on age and gender, Tressbay provides nail designing 

and tattooing services, besides dressing up the tots for special occasions. The 

tattoos (temporary, of course) are a big hit with youngsters, especially the boys, 

who insist on G.I. Joe, He-Man and even the Indian Tricolour, most popular before 

a big football or cricket match at school or on the telly. The girls concentrate 

their energies more at the nail bar where Barbie is still the rage. If you thought 

adults had all the ideas, check this one out: friends of the birthday girl can 

have Barbie painted on their nails while the centre of attention gets Ken (yes, 

they do start frighteningly early). For a wedding, instead of wearing jewellery, 

a child can have a necklace drawn on with gems and beads as a tattoo or get a 

colourful bindi on her forehead.

So, with some help, your little angel will upstage 

you in all your Sunday best.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

Heading for the Taj

 Hey, if nothing else, it might convince him 

(or her) to profess eternal love in true style. The ageless Taj Mahal, bathed 

in moonshine, can now be yours for a fab backdrop to that long-awaited proposal, 

thanks to a Supreme Court verdict allowing night-time viewing of the monument 

after 20 years.

Hogging ice-creams

 It?s time for all kids, and some grown-ups, 

to go on an ice-cream binge before mommy bans it for the chill factor! Don?t worry, 

the croak will be kissed away in time for the Christmas carol sessions.

Planting flowers

 Dahlias, chrysanthemums, marigolds? there?s 

more cheer in the brief Calcutta winters than you can imagine. If you haven?t 

got a whiff of the winter magic yet, hurry. Your neighbour?s saplings may already 

be a foot high!

 A symbolic world

 Art is an imitation of life. Yet, when an artist represents familiar forms and figures of everyday life, he invests them with new and more beautiful meanings. The ongoing exhibition of paintings and sculptures by a group of seven young artists takes us on a journey where we discover a world far removed from reality but with strong symbolic overtones. The collision of dreams and reality in Sukanta Karmokar?s Murder of Education points out the futility of institutionalised knowledge. The real and virtual also blend in Arunava Mondal?s paintings to represent the isolation of the artist. Subhas Karmokar?s compositions in acrylic (picture above), depict nature?s purity and its positive influence on the human mind. The harmony of colours in Sharmistha Basu?s work shows the unity of the human race. Korak Bhaumik?s work provides an insight into the pent-up energies of this promising artist. Debraj Rudra Paul?s sculpture symbolises the transience of life while Purnima Sil?s paintings give an impression of unspoilt innocence.

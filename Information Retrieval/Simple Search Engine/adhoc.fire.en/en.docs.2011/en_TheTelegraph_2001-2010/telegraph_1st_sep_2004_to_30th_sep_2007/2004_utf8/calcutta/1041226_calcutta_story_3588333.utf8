 ?The Calcutta crowd is the best in India,? announced 

singer KK after his third number at the The Telegraph X-Mas Eve celebrations 

at the Calcutta Swimming Club. And with some reason.

The constant cheering and almost fanatic calling out 

of his name left this Mumbai singer groping for words to thank the Calcutta crowd 

for such a warm reception.

Dressed in a black outfit when the singer made famous 

in a Pal took the stage, post 10.30 pm, and started off with some slow 

numbers to build the tempo for the evening. 

Starting with Yaaron... from Rockford, Sach 

keh raha hai deewana from Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein saw many a Madhavan 

wannabe imitating the dance steps of this 2001 blockbuster on the dance floor.

By the time Banda yeh bindaas hai from Aks 

happened, there was no holding back the bulk of the audience as it rushed 

to the dance floor, jostling for leg space.

From 16 to 60, the adrenaline rush vaulted all age 

barriers. As KK moved from his originals to covers and balanced the flow of the 

evening with a slow number amidst a row of fast tracks, the crowd lapped it all 

up.

DJ Kunal, who ranked third in an annual competition 

of city DJs this year, kept the crowd busy with popular Hindi numbers, whenever 

KK took a break. Emcee for the evening Ashok Harlalka did a good job too.

The well-laid-out three-tier seating arrangement along 

with a well-stocked bar with liquor flowing at reasonable prices made the X-Mas 

even merrier.

With the club kitchen working overtime to dish out 

masala chips and mutton kebabs, there were hardly any grumbles from the 

party crowd.

Rhythm rules

 Christmas Eve found CC amp;FC rocking, without being 

riotous. If it was all about thumping beats and frenzied moves at other party 

places, sitting back and hitting the dance floor occasionally was the order of 

the night here.

The Telegraph X-Mas Eve celebrations saw Dhwani 

and Skinny Alley (also featuring pop star Ritika Sahani) bringing in lots of good 

cheer for everyone.

Dhwani, a four-singer band that has been around for 

some time in the party circuit, was the first to take the stage. They sang to 

recorded music alright, but pumped in enough energy to rock the house.

Popular numbers set mostly to dance rhythms ? be it 

Country roads or a medley of Boney M hits ? brought people on to the dance 

floor in a jiffy. There was a fair share of Indipop and Bollywood tracks, new 

and retro, too.

As the night progressed and the air turned chilly, 

it was the turn of veterans Skinny Alley to hit the right musical notes. In a 

different avatar from its usual rock and blues set, the band?s playlist at CC amp;FC 

included a number of Hindi songs, from Dhoom to Raat baaki.

The band also performed classics like Crocodile 

rock and I saw her standing there and recent hits like Shakira?s Whenever, 

wherever.

Ritika Sahani took care of the Hindi numbers while 

Jayshree Singh handled the vocals for the English songs.

For those looking for a quieter retreat, the lawns 

provided the ideal parking place. Big groups of friends or family members caught 

up on some good adda.

Food and drink stalls took care of the nourishment 

concerns while providing a fair-like look and feel to the festivity.

The revelry continued till well into Christmas Day, 

and long after Skinny Alley had wrapped up, guests were seen grouping together 

on the lawn, finishing the last drinks and waving goodbye? till 31st night that 

is.

Retro rocks

 As always, the bamboo grove at the Tollygunge Club 

was well-lit and alive with people and cars waiting in long queues to get that 

sneak peak of a great party at The Telegraph X-Mas Eve celebrations.

By 11 ?clock, even the golf course?s driving range 

was filled with cars as party people kept streaming in.

Well-known rockers Shiva made the revellers dance 

to their tunes as comparative oldies and retro music were belted out.

I want to break free proved once more to be 

everyone?s favourite, with the dance floor packed to capacity and beyond. During 

the band breaks the ever-popular Hindi remixes were churned out.

On the fashion front, the women were the winners, 

what with dresses and mini skirts bearing the chill with a grin. The age group 

varied, but if an average estimate must be taken, teenagers ruled.

The rest, of course, was a series of tables strewn 

about, some delicious titbits from the Chinese and Tandoor kitchens and never-ending 

queues for alcohol refills.

 Brazilian blast

 The Telegraph X-Mas Eve celebrations at 

the Saturday Club blew cool before blowing hot. First up, Jenny, the Russian 

dancer, failed to ignite the club lawns, despite provocative moves to tracks like 

Turn me on and Whenever, wherever.

So, it was left to Brazilian belly dancer Klara to 

steam up the proceedings and give serious competition to the kebabs and tikkas 

laid out on the party platter.

Having captured the attention of the audience ? of 

the male segment at least ? Klara got into direct contact groove. To her credit, 

she pulled the first dancer on to the dance floor, well into party time. With 

the far-from-young crowd matching steps (or at least trying to) with the mover 

and shaker from Samba land, the woman in Arabian attire just upped the tempo.

As if taking a cue from the warm response to Klara, 

Jenny decided to go up on stage again for her share of the limelight. But the 

Russian act was not a patch on the Brazilian blast. 

The crowd did hit the dance floor with a vengeance, 

but not before Fifth Dimension churned out tracks like Oye oye and Dhum 

pichak dhum.

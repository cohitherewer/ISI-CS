The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 She was on the cover of Time magazine. She will wax eloquent at Madame Tussaud?s. But Aishwarya Rai hasn?t really worked with a top-notch Hollywood director, yet (Gurinder Chadha, after all, is still a British crossover film-maker). But that gap?s a thing of the past with Ash going into total eclipse for Tarsem Singh in the latest Nakshatra ad, with a new look (evident in the picture left).

 This new diamond jewellery commercial called Eclipse finds Tarsem capturing some stunning facets of Ash in the surreal setting of Sossusvlei in Namibia. Perhaps only the dramatic deserts and jagged mountains of the region could catch the beauty of the Balle Balle queen in sharp profile.

 Aishwarya?s look is radically different with her wardrobe designed by Ashley from India and Zelda from London. The post-production of the 60-second film, conceptualised by JWT, was done in South Africa. This is also the first time that Tarsem has shot for an Indian brand, having wielded the megaphone for the international Pepsi.

 The advertisement sees the radiance of Nakshatra transforming a dancing Apsara (Ash, of course), whose vitality is waning thanks to an eclipse. Cherie Saldhana, marketing director, Diamond Trading Company India, says: ?Nakshatra has always been known for its innovative advertising where the best talents come together.? 

Ishaa Koppikar: Stone stunt

 She raised eyebrows ? and the mercury ? when she did the rain dance in Bollywood?s first official item number, Khallas in Ram Gopal Varma?s Company. Then, after lying low for a few films, Ishaa Koppikar hit big time with her lesbian act in Karan Razdan?s Girlfriend. And now, after a disappointing show in Kundan Shah?s Ek Se Badhkar Ek, she is ready to sizzle all over again in Pankaj Parashar?s Inteqaam, Bollywood?s first version of Basic Instinct.

 ?There are a couple of things in the film like that in Basic Instinct,? Ishaa told Metro. ?But it won?t be right to say that it is a copy of the Sharon Stone thriller. Yes, this too is a psychological thriller and does have a celebrity writer and an undercover cop like the English film.? Apart from Ishaa, the film to release later this year stars Manoj Bajpai and model-turned-actress Nethra Raghuraman.

 ?See, Basic Instinct was a lot more sexual than what Inteqaam has turned out to be,? continues Ishaa. ?To be frank, the Michael Douglas-Sharon Stone erotic thriller cannot be made here in India. We have our social values and norms, which wouldn?t allow us to make a film on those lines.?

 What Inteqaam however does have is Ishaa in a completely different look. ?I shouldn?t end up looking the same in all my films. Change is constant and it?s our responsibility not to bore the audiences by flashing the same look.?

 So even while your dreams of Ishaa doing a Sharon turns to stone, you can at least feast your eyes on the all-new avatar of the Khallas babe.

Deep Jwele Jai: Tolly twist

 Three childhood buddies part ways to pursue their 

careers. The girl (Churni Ganguly) marries one of them (Bharat Kaul) and settles 

in Delhi; the other (Pijush Ganguly), pining for her in secret, becomes a mental 

wreck. So far, so good. Just the kind of love twists telefilms are made of. But 

with this one, hang around a little longer. There?s more to it than meets the 

eye.

 Biponno Bishmoy is a small-screen remake of the Suchitra Sen-Basanta Chowdhury-starrer Deep Jwele Jai (not to forget Khamoshi, the Hindi version starring Waheeda Rahman and Rajesh Khanna).

 But the love tale has been tailored to suit today?s tastes. So, Bharat Kaul is not a mental patient but Churni?s businessman husband between whom there?s no love lost. And Churni is no nurse, but an established psychiatrist who chucks her marriage and returns to Calcutta to cure friend Pijush.

 The secrets come tumbling out once the silent lover is hypnotised, and if you still think Churni would step over the edge like Suchitra and Waheeda, you?ve guessed all wrong.

 Let?s leave it at that. Catch the telefilm directed by Jagannath Guha on Akash Bangla this Sunday at 7 pm.

 On the birth anniversary of the father of the nation on Saturday, it is time once again to salute the man called Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

 Doordarshan, of course, will once again screen Sir Richard Attenborough?s film Gandhi, starring Ben Kingsley and Rohini Hattangadi and a host of other talented actors like Rohan Seth and Michael J. Fox, in Hindi, from 12.30 pm. 

 After the beaming of the film, there will be the live telecast of an all-religion prayer meeting from Gandhi Smriti, from 4 pm to 5.30 pm. Programmes at Raj Ghat in the morning will be beamed as part of the news bulletins through the day.

 At 7 pm, the History Channel will profile the leader of a nation who used the power of passive resistance to fight the British.

 Discovery Channel will premiere Men of our Time: Gandhi at 8 pm. The film features rare archival footage from the period, together with original recordings of his speeches.

 The narration on the life of the titanic figure in India?s freedom struggle will be by James Cameron, of Titanic fame.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Arrest, bail in assault

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The four youths named by Girish Park trader Prem Chand Shah and his son Ashish in their complaint were arrested and later released on bail, deputy commissioner of police (central) Rajeev Kumar said on Friday. 

 The youths were picked up from the neighbourhood and interrogated about Tuesday?s incident in which the Shahs were allegedly beaten up and their shop ransacked by members of a local club that had organised Durga puja.

 While the accused claimed that the Shahs were making an issue out of the alleged attack to claim insurance, the father-son duo denied having any insurance cover, added Kumar.

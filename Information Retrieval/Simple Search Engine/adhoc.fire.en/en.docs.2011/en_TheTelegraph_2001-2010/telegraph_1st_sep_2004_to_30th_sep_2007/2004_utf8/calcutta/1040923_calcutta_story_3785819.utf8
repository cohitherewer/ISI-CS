 What We are Watching

Tube Talk - Hollywood Sequels

 Cameron Diaz: Somebody stop her

Charlie?s Angels 2: Full Throttle 

 The sequel to the successful first part is loaded with more butt-kicking action and mouth-watering babes. This time the awesome threesome is out to search and retrieve a pair of rings that protect the identities of every informant on the FBI?s witness protection program.

 Watch it on HBO on September 26 at 8 pm

 Why bother? Although this second part couldn?t repeat the success of the original, do box-office collections matter when it comes to watching the terrific trinity of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu? Add to that, Demi Moore in a bikini. Phew!

 Tom Cruise: Asambhav

Mission Impossible 2

 Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, the IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent. He has to fix a former fellow-agent who has stolen a sample of a deadly synthetic virus that could rapidly wipe out the worlds population. 

 Watch it on Star Movies on September 26 at 9 pm

 Why bother? State-of-the-art special effects, an out-of-the-world background score and Tom Cruise in a do-it-all James Bond avatar. Just get hold of your bowl of popcorn and mast ho jao!

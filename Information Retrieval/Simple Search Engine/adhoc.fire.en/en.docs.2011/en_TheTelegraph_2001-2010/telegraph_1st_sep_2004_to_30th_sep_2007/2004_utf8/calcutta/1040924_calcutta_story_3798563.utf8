 What We are Watching

 Tradition and trivia

Sanjhbela

 For the first time, Swatilekha Sengupta steps out of Nandikar to play the lead for a group other than her own. Sayak?s adaptation of this Bimal Kar novel, directed by Meghnad Bhattacharya, has the Satyajit Ray heroine (Ghare Bairey) as a middle-aged mother confronting a personal crisis. 

 The gutsy woman who had walked out on her husband, raised her kids alone and established herself as the matron of a hospital finds herself at a critical crossroad when a man (played by Bhattacharya) from her past, now suffering from amnesia, returns to her world.

Catch it at Girish Mancha, 6.30 pm on Sunday

Sateroi July

With the Godhra riots as backdrop, Ganakrishti?s Sateroi 

July takes a look at how politics manipulates religion. At the epicentre is 

a molestation trial being heard in a Gujarat court, while fanatics bay for the 

blood of the man in the dock. Director Bratya Basu delivers a terse script and 

gripping plot ? though a little too loud for most ? with a 40-member cast, including 

TV actor Pijush Ganguly.

Drama Hungama

 With so many plays happening around the city, it?s perhaps time to pause and ponder over the craft. That?s exactly what you can do this evening. Drama Hungama, an interactive session, is meant to be a quiz-cum-adda on theatre, with the spotlight turned on trivia. With Dhruv Mukherjee as quizmaster and Tathagata Chowdhury as moderator, the stage will also be set for some special guests from screen and ramp.

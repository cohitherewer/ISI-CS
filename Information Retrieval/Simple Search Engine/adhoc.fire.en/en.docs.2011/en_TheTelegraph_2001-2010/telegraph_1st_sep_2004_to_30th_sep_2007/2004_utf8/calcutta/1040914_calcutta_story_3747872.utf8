The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Working together for child rights

 Of Animals amp; Clowns:It was a circus 

like no other. There were colourful clowns and fancy footwork, but the young performers 

behind it were handicapped. Kautuk, a childrens soiree based on stories 

from Panchatantra, was held by Shinjan Nrityalaya, an organisation set up by Odissi 

exponent Aloka Kanungo, on September 4, in association with The Telegraph in Schools 

(TTIS). The aim was to inculcate moral values in children and bring mentally-challenged 

and normal kids on the same platform. Participating institutions included Indian 

Institute Of Cerebral Palsy, Interlink, La Martiniere for Girls, Modern High and 

St Lawrence High School. After the song and dance, a circus of sorts was staged 

by the mentally-challenged kids. The music provided by Anjan Saha was a hit, as 

was the script by Vikram Iyengar. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

A flurry of activity, paint-smudged fingers, scissors 

going snip snip, busy bustle and cheerfulness all around ? at first sight this 

appears to be just another handwork class. However, as girls get up and announce 

that they?ve finished making the paper bags, the teacher asks how much time it 

took to make one bag. The answers vary from 10 to 20 minutes. The next fact stuns 

them ? thousands of children earn a living by making paper bags every day, at 

the rate of several per minute.

 This leads to a question-answer session. As part of the game, cards are flashed with pictures of various things with price tags. Food items, books, schoolbags, CDs, video games... The objective is to illustrate how needs and wants vary. These and other activities are a part of CRY?s (Child Relief and You) attempts to educate and generate awareness amongst children about child rights.

 ?This project has three aims ? educate children about the other side of the picture so that they can help the under-privileged, make them aware that violation of child rights can happen in any household and generate awareness about child rights. We hope to find advocates among these children,? says Soha Moitra of CRY. 

 The workshops are interactive and use aids like theatre and paintings to get the message across. ?The children are in most cases quite well-informed and there?s a general enthusiasm to know more,? says a CRY volunteer. Participation being a basic child right, there is a concrete attempt to involve the children and get their feedback at every step. Schools like GD Birla, St James, Apeejay and MB Girls? have welcomed the project and made it a part of their curriculum. 

 Plans are in the offing to reach out to more schools through competitions in fests. At a recent fest in St James, children from Classes VI to VIII participated in a one-act play competition, scripted by the students on the theme of child labour.

 The fact that the children have absorbed a lot from these workshops was evident. The common link running through the scripts highlighted how certain basic rights were taken for granted. A positive indication was a young protagonist of the MB Girls play, who takes concrete steps to stop child labour in her own home. Judging by this event, the quest for child advocates is on the right track.

 Idol worship

 That passion knows no bounds was proved during the Calcutta auditions of Indian Idol. Scorching heat, tough competition, long queues ? nothing could stop the young aspirants from making their dreams come true. ?Sab kuch bhula de,? was the motto of every participant. Sixteen years old or 30, boundless spirit and enthusiasm marked everything they did. 

 The suspense mounted with every moment, and the tension was thick. The participants included not just Calcuttans, but contenders from Assam and different districts of West Bengal. At the end of the day, some left with bright faces, while others were upset with the way things had gone. The candidates selected by the jury will be called for a second round of auditions.

 Chance for chatterbox

 Most students express their oratory skills in school by talking in class. But St Xavier?s Collegiate School has instituted an annual elocution and speech contest to give chatterboxes from Classes II to XII a chance to show off their talents. And to encourage Indian languages, the competition is extended to include Hindi and Bengali. The poems ranged from romance by Rabindranath Tagore to rib-ticklers by Apurba Dutta. Varying emotions were expressed.

 It has become a cliche for judges to say that they found it hard to decide on a winner, but in this case, it was true. It must have been a painstaking task to pick just one. Two of our Bengali teachers who will be retiring next year had also been requested to speak or sing, which was a fitting finale for the event.

 Demolish digital divide

 In today?s tech-savvy times, an office without computers is akin to an ocean without water. Keeping this in mind, Young Writer?s Workshop, in collaboration with NIIT (Camac Street centre), jointly organised the first seminar on multimedia, java and power point recently, for high school and college students. We were welcomed to the digital world. The the importance of information technology in the modern world and animation were discussed. 

 The seminar saw a large student turnout from schools like Loreto Sealdah, Loreto Eliot Road, Calcutta Boys?, CIS, Birla High (girls), MHS, MB Girls, Assembly of God Church, St Xavier?s, Carmel High, LMG, Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan, Queen of the Missions, Hartley?s and more. At the end of the seminar, during which we were enlightened about the changing face of industries due to computers, was a question-answer session, to help bridge the gap.

Taxing topic

 Recent debates over the form that Value Added Tax (VAT) would take and the scope of service tax in revenue augmentation were the topic at daylong discussions at NUJS on September 4. Professionals from different fields, corporates to bankers and academicians, held forth on the subject. Prof Amaresh Bagchi of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy aptly began his speech with a clarification on VAT. Although in laymen?s terms it is understood as the tax levied on the Value Added, in reality, it is imposed on the consumer on the basis of consumption. It is, therefore, a tax burden on the consumer. 

 He added that the line between goods and services is blurred. He stressed that although the tertiary (or service) sector contributes nearly 50 per cent to the country?s gross domestic product, the structure and composition is such that taxmen will find it difficult to collect revenues beyond 20 to 25 per cent of this sector. 

 Somnath Ballav, executive director, PricewaterhouseCoopers, pointed out that India continues to differentiate between goods and services, and that the service sector is an important source of revenue. Backing him up was Gautam Roy, commissioner (appeals), excise, also in favour of taxing services.

 Stop that noise

 Incessant blaring of car horns is something schools on Park Street have to deal with on a daily basis. Concentrating in class is often difficult. Apeejay School started a campaign against the menace of noise pollution. But despite Calcutta Police senior officials coming to the rescue by installing ?No Horn? signs, it proved useless. 

 To create awareness, Interact Club of Apeejay School (ICAPJ) organised a panel discussion on ?Whatever the festival, Calcutta cannot suffer from noise pollution? on September 2. Moderator journalist Utpal Chatterjee gave a brief introduction, while environment activist Jayanta Basu said students are the best hope in this case.

 Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, the man behind the landmark order on noise pollution in 1996, focused on the laws. He pointed to a lack of awareness as the main reason for the failure of the 1996 judgment. 

 A platform for control of noise pollution was also sighted as an option. The representatives from the Corporation, municipal secretary S.K. Bhowmick and U. Sengupta (director-general, civil), complimented ICAPJ?s work and promised their support.

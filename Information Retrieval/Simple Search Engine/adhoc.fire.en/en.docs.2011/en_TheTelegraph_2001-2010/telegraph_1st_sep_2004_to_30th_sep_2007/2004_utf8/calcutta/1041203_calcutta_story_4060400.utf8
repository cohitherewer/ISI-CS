 Mission varsity awaits nod 

 BHAJAN GANGULY 

 Ramakrishna Mission is awaiting a green light from the Centre for implementing its proposal to set up a full-fledged ?deemed?university at Belur Math. 

 The proposed university, the first of its kind in the state, will offer correspondence as well as classroom courses.

 The Union human resource development ministry has set up a committee to examine the Mission?s proposal to set up the university. 

 The committee, headed by chairman of the Distance Education Council and vice-chancellor of Indira Gandhi National Open University H.P. Dikshit, has been asked to submit its report within three months, sources at Belur Math said.

 Swami Atmapriyananda, principal of Belur Vidya Mandir and a member of the committee, said: ?The university will be named after Swami Vivekananda. It will aim at following a system of education based on ideals of Swamiji. Initially, the institution will function as an open university. But courses will also be offered under the conventional system later on.? 

 The committee has already held at least three meetings, including one at Belur Math, he added.

 The Mission has identified four thrust areas for starting courses at the proposed university. They are: disability management with special education, integrated rural development, including tribal development, disaster management, including relief and rehabilitation, and Indian spiritual and cultural heritage, including value-based education. 

 ?These thrust areas have been chosen as there is a need to offer value-oriented education to all sections of the society, particularly at a time when we need to increase awareness about the alarming erosion of values. Our courses will try to benefit the mentally and physically challenged,? Swami Atmapriyananda said. 

 The Mission-run Belur Vidya Mandir at Belur Math will function as the coordinating centre of the proposed university. 

 The other units of the Mission in different parts of the country will function as specialised faculty centres. 

 The governing body of Ramakrishna Mission has also constituted a committee, with Swami Atmapriyananda as convener, to scrutinise various aspects of the functioning of the university. 

 In March, the committee submitted a report to the governing body, stating that the proposal to create an open university should be placed before the Centre. 

 The Mission submitted its proposal to Union human resources development minister Arjun Singh in August. 

 A nine-member committee, including principal secretary of the state?s higher education department Jawhar Sarkar, was set up to look into the proposal.

 According to Sarkar, the proposal is still being considered by the Centre and the final okay will be given by it.

 Sources said the Mission will not charge exorbitant fees from students, like other private educational institutions, and will strive to provide education to the poor and marginalised sections of the society. 

 The sources said the Mission has requested the Centre for providing financial assistance in the initial years of the proposed university.

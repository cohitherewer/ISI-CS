The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Woo the young with perky perks

 - Clubs fight geriatric feel, add facilities for fresh footfall in facelift

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Lounge bar and DJ grooves, pizza points and cool cocktails, heated swimming pool and cardio fitness gear?

 The prim and propah city clubs, long regarded as geriatric bastions, are breaking barriers to roll out a platter of perks, just for GenX.

 The rationale is just right ? the young clubgoer has the time, energy and money to spend.

 Most of the traditional institutions of Calcutta, realising that sustainability in the home-out-of-home avatar hinges on ?youth footfall?, are keen to shed their stiff-upper-lip visage.

 ?It?s very important for the clubs to ensure that youngsters use the facilities more, since the future depends on that,? says Utpal Ganguly, CC amp;FC president.

 While Saturday Club gets ready to pump up the music and the mayhem with its new-look lounge bar, Punjab Club banks on the hi-tech fitness pad and discotheque, and DI on its upcoming swank sports complex.

 Even as Tollygunge Club?s ice-cream parlour, beauty salon and on-campus departmental store are becoming increasingly popular, the drive-in movie premieres on the Royal Calcutta Golf Club fairways are a chill-out blast.

 CC amp;FC, which has a proud tradition of sporting excellence, has a system of taking in sports members till age 30 and has beefed up grassroots coaching schemes of late to encourage more youngsters to come aboard.

 Fitness is the fulcrum of reinvention at many of the conventional clubs.

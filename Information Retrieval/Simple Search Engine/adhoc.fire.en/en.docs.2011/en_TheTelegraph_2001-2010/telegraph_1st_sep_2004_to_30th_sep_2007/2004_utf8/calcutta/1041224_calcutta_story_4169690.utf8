The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Little flights of fancy

 First, a mad scramble for passes. With the tickets ensured, just potter about the campus, feel the nip in the air, and sip tea or coffee. This week is that time of the calendar year when the Academy of Fine Arts remains abuzz with actors, critics and lovers of theatre, all flocking to catch up on the assortment of plays dished out by Nandikar.

 The 21st National Theatre Festival, hosted by Nandikar with children in the spotlight, has seen house-full shows for most of the performances. 

 Starting with Swedish troupe Theater Pero?s Tongue-Tied, people have thronged the auditorium for the December 19 and 20 shows, which saw a huge on-stage participation from youngsters. 

 Schoolchildren took the stage for three plays, Olot Palot, Joraay Joraay and Swapna Muhurte under Debshankar Halder?s direction, young trainees of Nandikar put up Andharmoni and members of Nehru Children?s Museum enacted Ekla Pagol.

 On Wednesday, Shri Ram Vijoy found a near-packed hall as the young members of Purbaranga from Guwahati performed an episode from the Ramayana. ?It?s nice to see young people working on the traditional forms,? said Rudraprasad Sengupta, director of Nandikar, after the show.

 The following day, a gang of children of Natrang from Jammu held the audience enthralled with Aap Hamare Hain Kaun?, a critique of the set-ups at home and in school (picture above by Pradip Sanyal).

 The winding path that leads to the Academy auditorium has been decked up with an illustrated exhibition on the socio-cultural milieu of schoolchildren of the city and its fringes. 

 A survey conducted by Nandikar, on which the display is based, has thrown up some interesting findings on the lifestyle of children.

 Though in the last lap, the festival has a few more surprises in store with a potent combination of theatre veterans Habib Tanvir and Sabitri Heisnam. Despite having staged their plays several times in the city, Heisnam?s Draupadi and Tanvir?s Charandas Chor are already sold out.

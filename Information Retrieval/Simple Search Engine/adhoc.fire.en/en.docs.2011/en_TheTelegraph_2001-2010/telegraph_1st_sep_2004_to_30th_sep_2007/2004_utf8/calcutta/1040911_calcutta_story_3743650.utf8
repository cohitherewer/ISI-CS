 Marks fraud arm in Patna

 - Bihar links held in wake of forged certificate complaint 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The racket that fetched forged marksheets for a section of students had spread its tentacles as far as Bihar. 

 The revelation came on Friday after a string of arrests in Patna, including that of the key operator and a middleman. The detective department has rounded up six persons so far for the fraud that traces its roots to a complaint lodged by Calcutta University registrar Ujjwal Kumar Basu with Jorasanko police station on May 24. 

 Basu had complained against first-year student Ajoy Mondal of RG College, Champahati, whose Higher Secondary certificate from the Bihar Intermediate Council was a fake. A probe was kicked off. 

 Mondal claimed he had bought the certificate from a city-based racketeer. He even produced a copy of the receipt. 

 Investigations revealed that the city-based operators ? Madhab Mondal of Sonarpur and Kalyan Bhattacharya of Teghoria ? would collect the fake marksheets from Sukhdeo Kumar, who owned a press in the Budhmarg area of Patna. While Kumar was the key operator, his liaison man was Sanjay Sharma, a 32-year-old resident of Kankarbagh. 

 There was little Sharma could not supply ? from Intermediate marksheets to a bachelor?s degree in science or commerce or a diploma in technical education. ?The rates would depend on the certificates. A first division at the Intermediate level would cost something between Rs 500 and Rs 600, while a technical diploma would cost around Rs 1,500,? said Peeyush Pandey, city sleuth chief. 

 Around 200 fake certificates and 25 false seals of officers, right up to the level of principal secretary, were recovered from both Sharma and Kumar. Besides, a colour scanner, floppies, hard disks and computer terminals have also been impounded.

 Police claim Sharma stopped operating from his Ashokbag office soon after the Calcutta arrests. He would hang around the Intermediate Council for clients and take them to Kumar, where they were handed over the marksheets .

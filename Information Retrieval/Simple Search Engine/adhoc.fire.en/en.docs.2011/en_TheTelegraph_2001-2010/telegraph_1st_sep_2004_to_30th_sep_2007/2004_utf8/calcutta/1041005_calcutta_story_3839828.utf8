 Papier perfect with knick-knacks

 Chances are, this piece of newsprint won?t live to see another day after you are through with it. Read on for ideas about a low-cost, high-satisfaction craft that is sure to galvanise you into instant action.

 Boats, planes and frogs ? fun as they can be ? are hardly the high points of paper craft. Papier mache might be a tad messy all right, but it can be a joy to execute and beautiful to behold.

There are a few stops about town that stock papier 

mache articles like photo frames, wall hooks, paper stands, coasters, lampshades, 

soft boards, hangers, dustbins, jewellery and sewing boxes, little toys and even 

games like snakes and ladders and knots and crosses (picture above by Rashbehari 

Das).

 The motifs vary from cartoons and caricatures to tribal designs. Colours are usually bright and can enliven the most dreary corners and moods. These knickknacks make great birthday as well as corporate presents.

 But then there?s nothing like that personal touch, which is only possible when you get down to using your bare hands and mucking around.

 Scout around a few stores to get a basic idea of shapes, sizes and designs if you don?t have concise ideas yet.

 The next step is to look around the house to fish out the best shapes to use as moulds. Just about anything goes ? balloons of all sizes and forms are great for making bases and round designs, corrugated cardboard works well for bases, while light-weight cardboard is best suited for detailing. Utensils and crockery can also be used as moulds.

 Wallpaper paste or regular glue mixed with a little water can do the binding trick. One part water and two parts glue is the ideal mix. 

 But before you proceed, make sure you cover yourself and the workstation well, to avoid a challenging clean up job after the event.

 ways tear paper for this purpose, rather than cutting it with scissors. Old newspaper can come in most handy. For a more natural look, you might prefer brown paper.

Dip one piece of paper into the paste at a time, hold the strip over the paste bowl and run it through your fingers to squeeze off the excess glue.

 Stick the strip over the form and smooth it down gently with your fingers. The object should be completely covered with overlapping paper strips. After one layer is applied, let it dry for about 24 hours.

 Add another layer thereafter and let this dry for another day. Repeat this process until you?ve achieved the desired effect. At least three layers are recommended. Paint, decorate and proudly flaunt your creation.

 Just in case you can?t figure out the separable mould format, start out with handy household items. Empty shoeboxes, cardboard ice-cream and juice containers, soda bottles, egg cartons and even broken egg shells can be used to perfect your papier mache skills.

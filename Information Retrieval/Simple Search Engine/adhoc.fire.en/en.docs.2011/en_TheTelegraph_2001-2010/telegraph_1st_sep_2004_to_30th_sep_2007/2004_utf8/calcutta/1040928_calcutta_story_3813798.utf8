 Buddha beams at health city

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) on Monday submitted a proposal to the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government on setting up a Rs 20,000-crore health city in Calcutta. 

 After the meeting with Sajal Dutta, AHEI president, and other members, the chief minister described it as ?a good proposal?.

 AHEI members, all top 12 private hospitals in eastern India, who have international tie-ups, will set up several speciality hospitals on an eight-acre plot between Gariahat and Baruipur in the south. 

 The healthcare city will comprise clusters of private hospitals, daycare centres and advanced diagnostic centres, slated to meet world healthcare standards. 

 ?Bengal is the largest health hinterland in India. It annually attracts 70,000 tourists from Bangladesh, 20,000 from Nepal and another 20,000 from other neighbouring countries,? said Dutta.

 The AHEI will now meet Asok Bhattacharya, minister for municipal affairs and urban development, for a suitable plot, on which the multi-speciality health city will come up, comprising 50,000 beds and over 100 separate hospitals. ?The hospitals will cover the entire gamut of cutting-edge healthcare delivery available anywhere in the world,? Dutta said.

 AHEI member-hospitals said the cost of hospital operations will reduce considerably by outsourcing the activities of each hospital, like laundry, food services and housekeeping and supplementary power generation.

 The hospitals will have super-special facilities like referrals, laboratories, pet scanner and gamma knife for necessary investigations. This apart, telemedicine facilities, along with telecardiology and telepathology, will be set up in the individual hospitals. 

 With the facilities in place, the hospital authorities are convinced that they will be able to get an international clientele, particularly from the UK, where patients have to wait for over three months under the National Health Service (NHS) and private hospitals are prohibitively expensive. 

 On the hospital campus, pharmaceutical and other companies will set up warehouses, where surgical, disposables and implants will be stored.

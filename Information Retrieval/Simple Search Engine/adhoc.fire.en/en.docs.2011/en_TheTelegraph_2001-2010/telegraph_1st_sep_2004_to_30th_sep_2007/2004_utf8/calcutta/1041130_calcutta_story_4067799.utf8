 With a pre-show blitzkrieg matching that of a Las Vegas fight night, the Russian Circus on Ice registered a stupendous Sunday night opening in the city. If expectations soared sky high in the evening, the audience reactions at the end of it all were mixed. Some complained about the short duration, some about restricted visibility but everyone (a near-packed Netaji Indoor Stadium) sat spellbound as a Russian team performed for the first time in Calcutta after a gap of 22 years.

 Set stage 

 The USP of the circus is the ice base on which the troupe performs. Created by a special machine at the stadium venue, the ice stage has to be continually maintained to keep it rock solid and also keep the surface smooth.

 Most of the performances use the base to the fullest ? whether it?s a trapeze act or a ballet performance or even a cycle ride. Using skaters throughout, the performers move around the circular stage with utmost ease.

 True blue

 If for nothing else, the dancing queens make the Russian Circus a must watch. Wearing mostly blue and white, the figure-skating pros (most of them are Olympians) with their regal accessories and streamlined motion make the show a complete visual treat. 

 The grand orchestral music playing on the soundtrack makes their moves more enchanting. Scaling up thin air with just a couple of strings and then dancing way up there has never looked more majestic. The understanding between the performers is expectedly spot-on and the hand-eye coordination can even put Virender Sehwag to shame.

Minimal animal 

 A big disappointment for the Calcutta crowd on Day One was the animal quotient at the circus. With just a couple of Eskimo dogs, a few small dogs and a handful of cats in the show, the Rs 500 tickets were no value for money for many. 

 Expecting the penguins and the seals, there was a sense of being cheated. Even the dog and cat shows were too basic to draw the cheers. An audible grumble: ?Dhoor, er theke amader parar circus bhalo (Our local circus is better).?

 Bottomline: No animals, no circus. Sophistication and aesthetics be damned!

 Clown clout 

 It?s old school, but it works all right. The clown is the only interactive element in the Russian Circus on Ice. With his customary whistle and hoop, he gifts balloons to all those kiddies who perform with him on stage. A winner straightaway, the clown does return from time to time to either slow down or buck up the proceedings. There is also a separate skit by the trio of clowns that fights on stage and then comes together to play along to the background music.

 Magic moves

 The Russian Circus on Ice is not for those who are expecting a more glamorous version of a Gemini or Olympic circus. Its speciality lies in its beautifully choreographed movements and rhythmically punctuated ballet items. It is different from anything seen here before in the name of circus. And it is not just for kids ? it?s for everyone who wants to soak in the stunning images of fluid bodies careening seamlessly on the glistening ice. With more than 30 shows to go in the city, the Russian Circus on Ice has definitely become a must-watch event for many a Calcuttan. Just keep the mental baggage back home and watch out for innovations.

 The show will be on till December 17.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 They might not have bagged the new Yash Chopra film Veer-Zaara, but ever since Hum Tum became a roaring hit, Jatin-Lalit are back in business after being in hibernation for quite a few seasons. It?s time to say Chak de to all that and move forward for the music makers who gave us such hits as Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.

 Now, thanks to Tara, you too can sing for the music duo presently rocking to the sounds of Rok Sako To Rok Lo (Planman Life?s forthcoming film directed by Arindam Chaudhuri). The talent hunt from the Bengali telly channel is inviting talented singers to audition for a chance to sing for Jatin-Lalit.

 All you have to do is to appear for an audition at Opera studio between October 1 and 3, from 10 am onwards. Four boys and four girls will be chosen from the preliminary rounds and will have to appear for the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals between October 6 and 8. The finals will be judged by Jatin-Lalit themselves.

 You can sing songs from any of their films ? from Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa to Chalte Chalte (picture right). If you are chosen as the best male or best female singer, you will not only get to sing at the Jatin-Lalit concert on October 9 at Science City Auditorium but may even stand a chance of singing for them in their next film project.

 For their concert on Sunday, October 9, Jatin-Lalit will be accompanied by the very best of crooners from Bollywood including Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik, Sunidhi Chauhan, Shaan and Babul Supriyo.

Tanishaa: A fresh start

 She was supposed to be launched alongside Hrithik Roshan by a man called Shekhar Kapur, when she was all of 16. ?I even did a photo shoot with him for Ta Ra Rum Pum but fate intervened,? Kajol?s sister Tanishaa still rues.

 She did end up making her debut in an immensely-forgettable slasher film Sssshhhh? last year, which sunk at the box-office even before viewers could get the spelling right. ?I had signed two or three other films which never got released. I have realised that not everything is in my control, so why sit and worry about it,? she shrugged during her trip to Calcutta to promote her second film, Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao!.

 Tanishaa saw a special screening of her new film with mother Tanuja and sister Kajol on Thursday night. ?Kajol couldn?t stop laughing throughout the film. The characters have come out very well thanks to our director, Kabir Sadanand. He gave all of us a frame of the character(s) and allowed us to bounce around it.?

 Much like her star sister?s role in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Tanishaa in Popcorn? matures from a ?bit of a bully? to a graceful woman. ?The friendship aspect in the two films is quite similar but here I know I am in love with Akshay (Kapoor), but Kajol was never aware that she loved Shah Rukh. I had to wear this one red sari throughout the film and I just hated it by the end of it. My mother and sister are so graceful in saris; I must admit I am a bit uncomfortable.?

 Between Sssshhhh? and Popcorn?, Tanishaa had signed Mani Shankar?s Tango Charlie which amongst many other stars features her brother-in-law Ajay Devgan. ?But I don?t have any scene with him or for that matter any of the other stars (Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty), apart from Bobby Deol.?

 Currently Tanishaa is shooting for Ram Gopal Varma?s take on Godfather, Sarkar. ?I still don?t know how I got the film. It?s been a dream come true,? gushed the actress.

Amitabh: Yesterday once more 

The original Don is back. Three big weeks of the Big 

B?s hottest movies loom large on SET MAX. Kicking off on September 27 with Shahenshah 

and closing on October 15 with Kaalia, on offer would be eternal favourites 

Deewar, Zanjeer, Kabhi Kabhie, Don, Kaala Paththar, 

Trishul, Satte Pe Satta and Agneepath.

 All the movies have been aired several times on the channel, but MAX hopes one more round will be welcomed by Bachchan worshippers. Calcutta has them in plenty, home to the only Bachchan temple (and idol) in the country.

 The 15-movie fare is called Main Hoon Don Amitabh Bachchan Film Festival and plugging it will be the familiar MAX kid (the same one who challenges Kapil Dev in the cricket campaigns and stumps Sourav Ganguly in Pepsi?s ?Toss Ka Boss? saga).

 Come Friday and intertextuality takes on a whole new meaning on the big screen with the India release of the sci-fi Hollywood thriller Alien Vs. Predator. The iconic monsters from two of the scariest film franchises battle it out on earth after the discovery of an ancient pyramid buried under the Antarctic ice. With the two alien races engaged in the ultimate battle on the frozen continent, the film?s tagline rings loud and eerie: ?No matter who wins, we lose.?

 The film directed by Paul W.S. Anderson stars lesser-known faces like Sanaa Lathan, Lance Henriksen, Raoul Bova, Ewen Bremner and Colin Salmon. While the film may be low on star count, the promotion and marketing of the movie has reached a high pitch. The website, for one, has 11 language versions, including Spanish, English, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese. That?s not all ? each language website can be opened in two formats: html and flash. So you have more than 20 web versions of the same film. That?s something alien to start with.

 This is a must-watch for diet-watchers confused with 

conflicting reports on the popular Atkins diet. The low carbohydrate diet programme 

has been panned by the American Medical Association as ?potentially dangerous 

to health? even as celebrities like Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, Robbie Williams 

and Renee Zellweger endorse it. 

 Atkins: Fat or Fiction on Discovery Channel presents both sides of the argument, featuring dieticians, nutritionists, Hollywood trainers and even Dr Robert Atkins himself. Tune in on Tuesday at 10 pm.

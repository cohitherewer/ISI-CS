The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Along musical highway in reverse gear

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Madhu Lakhotia with Cyrus Broacha on the sets of Gone Case

 Her identity card reads Dhum Atikhol. But her name is Madhu Lakhotia. For someone who is used to life in reverse gear, that is only natural. 

 Lakhotia, as her card mentions, is a reverse singer who can sing any song with its lyrics reversed without any practice. ?I have been doing this since high school. Now it comes naturally to me,? says the Calcutta-born, now settled in Mumbai.

 Her talent has earned her a place in the Limca Book of Records in 1997. It has even taken her to a host of shows on the small screen. ?When I addressed Sekhan Suman as Namsu Rakhse on Movers amp; Shakers, he was so amused that he said he would go by that name in the next three episodes. Elsewhere, Javed Jafferi stated that I needed a brain surgery kyunki meri dimag ka computer ulta hai,? laughs the 42-year-old homemaker, who has even participated in many a stage show. ?People say that when they hear me sing popular songs, they sound as strange as Arabic.? They can hardly be blamed. When one hears Lakhotia zestfully embark on Rame paju hya nipaja, it is tough to make out it is Mera Juta Hai Japani except from the familiar Mukesh tune.

 The first memory Lakhotia has of singing in reverse was in Class IX. ?My friends used to tease me saying that I had an unfair edge in antakshari as reverse singing is also allowed.?

 But it was only after marriage that she honed her talent. ?My in-laws felt that I should get some vocal training.? She even did classes with vocalist Sobha Gurtu who was taken in by her curious gift. ?My voice is a lot more melodious now. When I sing on stage, there is someone singing a song the normal way, while I follow in the reverse order.?

 Having made the national mark, her eyes are now set on a spot in the Guinness Book of Records but it is likely to be a tough ask. ?I met their representatives four years ago when they were in Mumbai. They clarified that I would have to sing in English to be eligible. Also I have to break the current record.? So, in 2002, Chris Wallington of the Guinness records research services threw her the gauntlet ? the lyrics of Queen?s album A Night at the Opera. The current record in the ?Backward talking ? fastest lyrics? category is held by Steve Briers of Kilgetty, Pembrokeshire, who did it in nine minutes 58.44 seconds. Lakhotia has to do the 12 songs in less time. 

 Lakhotia is now thinking of engaging an English tutor. ?How does one pronounce words like leech in reverse? I am not comfortable with English as with Hindi.? The enterprising lady is not giving up though.

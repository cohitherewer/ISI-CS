The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Save cash for a better cause

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should the government sponsor a fireworks contest on Diwali to turn it into a tourist extravaganza?

Joydeep Sur,

If the government sponsors a fireworks contest on 

Diwali, it would certainly add a unique dimension to the festivities. Tourists 

from all corners of the globe would be attracted to such a light-and-sound extravaganza. 

Such a show would not only increase the country?s foreign exchange earnings but 

could also make India a tourist hot spot. 

Sayan Banerjee, 

 Belgachhia Road

The city definitely looks great on Diwali, and there 

is no dearth of fireworks on that night. At the moment, it is not necessary to 

spend money on sponsoring a fireworks contest. The government could, instead, 

encourage private organisations to arrange such events and gauge the public response. 

If it is good, the state government can think of organising such an event in future.

Anandadip Chowdhury, 

 Baguiati

If visitors are more keen on fireworks contests, this 

might reduce the importance of community pujas. This would force puja committees 

to be more organised in their approach. They often spend lavishly on pandals and 

idols, but pay no attention to fire-safety measures. Power supply to the pandals 

is often illegal, and the unsafe electric supply lines lead to short-circuits 

which have claimed several lives in the past. The chances of Calcutta emerging 

as an attractive place to be in during Diwali will increase if the government, 

or for that matter, corporate houses, organise such events, while encouraging 

puja committees to follow safety norms as well.

Indranil Sengupta, 

 Salt Lake

No, I don?t see any reason for organising such a fireworks 

contest. It would be a sheer waste of money and time. Lakhs of rupees that would 

have to be spent to organise such a contest can be utilised for the betterment 

of the existing tourist attractions. If the heritage buildings are better maintained, 

attractive packages are dished out for tourists and Calcutta is cleaner, greener 

and pollution-free, I am sure the tourist footfall would go up manifold. 

Sumant Poddar, 

 Kyd Street

It would be quite a unique idea if the government 

sponsors a fireworks contest on Diwali. With a ban on loud crackers, a state-sponsored 

show would bring a smile to the faces of children. A professional light-and-sound 

show can be arranged to make it more attractive.With most of the citizens busy 

watching the show, the number of freak accidents will reduce. 

Sourish Mishra, 

 Salt Lake

Organising a grand fireworks contest on Diwali is 

a great idea to promote tourism. Many people visit West Bengal during Durga puja. 

Since Kali puja is within days of Durga puja, the government can easily promote 

a fireworks contest as an added attraction for Diwali tourists.

Govind Das Dujari,

 Diamond Harbour Road

Till a few years back, a tubri competition 

used to be organised at Charial, in Budge Budge. I remember, people used to come 

in droves from faraway places just to watch the show. This is not surprising given 

that people enjoy watching fireworks more than lighting them. I believe it would 

be a very good idea for the government to organise a fireworks show on Diwali. 

A lot of people cannot afford to buy fireworks, which are becoming expensive by 

the day. They would bless the government for organising such a show. Also, if 

the majority of poeple go for the show, they would buy less fireworks, thus reducing 

the pollution level on Diwali. Moreover, outbreak of fires and the number of casualties 

would also be less.

Nina Talukdar,

 Golpark

In a country like India, where a large section of 

the population is still below the poverty line, it would be better appreciated 

if the government sponsors free meals, clothes, shelter and medical treatment 

for the underprivileged. Why burn up the hard-earned money of tax-payers in minutes, 

and add to the sound and air pollution, which are already above the safe limits?

Subhakar Mukherjee,

 Address not given

The insidious threat to human life is ignored during 

Diwali celebrations. Most crackers are louder than 90 decibels and release pollutants 

that have a disastrous effect on the environment. A government-sponsored fireworks 

contest will also cause air pollution. Hence, such a show would amount to government 

recognition of polluting activities. It will also go against the court ruling. 

Jayanta Datta,

 Chinsurah 

Such a show will have a huge impact on tourism in 

the state. For whatever reasons, the government has not been able to attract tourists 

the conventional way and hence, innovative ideas must be tried out. But the show 

must be planned and marketed properly. Government patronage has certainly helped 

in attracting more tourists to the Ganesh puja celebrations in Maharashtra. The 

West Bengal government can take a leaf out of that book.

A rijit Ghosh,

 Shyamnagar 

The government has already acquired a bad reputation 

for wasting money on useless ventures. A fireworks contest on Diwali will only 

serve to confirm that reputation. Arranging such a contest is not a necessary 

and logical way of attracting tourists.

Sudeshna Ghosh, 

 Bonhooghly

There is no doubt that tourists would be attracted 

to a fireworks contest on a grand scale, but can the state in all fairness organise 

such an event, when people are living in pitch darkness and are subsisting on 

scraps of food? A fireworks contest would only earn accolades that would ring 

hollow the next day.

Hemanta Kumar Dutta,

 Shibpur

The idea is not a particularly bright one. If implemented, 

it will only add to the woes of the Calcuttans, without attracting many tourists. 

Calcuttans have already been left reeling under the pollution menace and any plan 

which might lead to increase in the pollution level should be nipped in the bud.

Debalina Bose,

 Konnagar

A lot of people cannot afford to buy expensive fireworks. 

If the government organises such a show after taking proper precautionary measures, 

it will provide great enjoyment to innumerable people from the country and abroad. 

The government exchequer will also benefit.

Rimli Dutta,

 Salt Lake

The proposal is a welcome one. The government can 

use such a show to attract thousands of tourists. A certain contest fee can be 

introduced, which will help the government recover a part of the expenditure. 

The contest will mitigate differences and remove social and communal segregation.

Ronita dutta,

 Jadavpur

I don?t see how the government would be able to promote 

such a festival given that the court has banned use of firecrackers which produce 

noise. The government should rather find other ways to attract tourists given 

that fireworks are a major irritant for many residents and can be harmful for 

health. 

Kanai Saha,

 Gauri Bari Lane

To attract tourists, the government should concentrate 

on their safety and infrastructure development instead of organising a fireworks 

contest. Such a show would put unnecessary strain on the exchequer.

Debashis Chakraborty,

 Nilmoni Mitra Row

Thanks to the court ban, one does not have to suffer 

unbearable air and sound pollution on Diwali. A government-sponsored fireworks 

contest will only serve to bring back those dark days.

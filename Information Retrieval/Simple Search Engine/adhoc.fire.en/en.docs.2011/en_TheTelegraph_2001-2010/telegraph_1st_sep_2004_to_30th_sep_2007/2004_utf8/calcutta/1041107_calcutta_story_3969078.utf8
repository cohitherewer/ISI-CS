The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Power to the Puja purchase

 Being with the consumer through the 

 happiest four days in the year remains vital for marketers

 Finally, it is over. Idols have 

 been immersed. Roads have been unclogged. Temperature has 

 cooled off. Goodbye Pujas, hello picnics. It is also a good 

 time to look back and see how things were this Puja.

 The Puja number of a leading Bengali 

 publication was lying on the bedside table. I thought it 

 would be a good starting point. I had already read three 

 of the novels, a couple of essays and all the poetry from 

 this book. Yet, I had not noticed it.

 The back cover ? arguably the 

 most visible page of the issue ? carried an ad from a leading 

 white goods maker. The product being peddled was a washing 

 machine. There were five blurbs, each devoted to a Puja 

 day. Each had a few lines in Bengali. Three of the blurbs 

 had a spelling mistake each. Some spellings altered the 

 meaning of the sentence altogether. But the first blurb 

 takes the cake ?it gets the name of Birendra Krishna Bhadra 

 wrong.

 How did it get through? It is 

 almost impossible for advertising agencies to have expertise 

 in all Indian languages. So they outsource it. Conceivably, 

 that is what had caused such a faux pas. It is, however, 

 not the how it did happen that is important ? the crucial 

 issue is why did it happen. Some of you will remember an 

 old Lifebuoy Gold advertisement. Like the girl in the ad 

 used to say, perhaps the answer is: I don?t care. 

 Should the advertisers care about advertising during Pujas?

 Pujas have traditionally been 

 a peak purchasing season. Today, credit and debit cards, 

 ?buy now pay later? and other consumer finance schemes have 

 slightly flattened the hump in the sales curve. Still, Pujas 

 remain a buying occasion for the vast majority. This is 

 especially true for non-perishables. It thus makes sense 

 for Philips to advertise its DVD player or Videocon its 

 refrigerator or Raymonds its suiting.

 There is this other very good 

 reason for marketers to be seen and heard in this season. 

 If your product is an everyday use bathing soap, a ready-to-use 

 spice or a cream that you always carry in your purse, there 

 is very little extra sale you expect during the Pujas. Yet 

 it makes sense even for you to advertise during Pujas. Pujas 

 are arguably the happiest four days in the year of a normal 

 consumer. Being a part of the consumer?s life during these 

 days pays rich dividends on those dreary monsoon mornings 

 or dull winter evenings when your brand choice is threatened.

 These are not recent revelations. 

 For years, this reasoning has triggered major promotional 

 and advertising bursts. Indeed, there are brands like Boroline 

 and Bata who had at one point of time creatively monopolised 

 the Puja mind space. Parents and kids alike would start 

 their window-shopping at the morning paper.

 What has changed? Are we buying 

 fewer shoes? Or fewer shirts? Have we decided to do without 

 the trappings of refrigerators and washing machines? Perhaps 

 not. The washing machine ad that had all those mistakes 

 was specially created for the Pujas. The advertising space 

 used was also special. Advertiser interest is amply demonstrated. 

 It is the creator of the ad who faltered. He did not have 

 the right resources. Most advertising companies these days 

 do not have an office in this city. The million dollar question 

 is ? should the publications here start lending a helping 

 hand?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

by Derek O'Brien

Exactly a week ago, Sourav?s boys (men!) won at the 

Eden Gardens. Since the Windies came here in the mid-seventies, I have watched 

every Test and ODI at the Eden Gardens. I am sure there are many of you who love 

to do the same. Missed this one though. Home. TV. Legs up. Replays. Lazy man!

QUESTIONS 

 1. The first question is on the early days of cricket at the Eden Gardens. If the first Test to be played at the Eden Gardens was against England, against whom did India play the second Test held at the Gardens?

 2. Now, a question on more modern times. Which team did India play in the first ODI ever to be held at the Eden Gardens, in 1986-87?

3. Who has scored the most number of Test runs at Eden Gardens? 

 4. The land housing the Eden Gardens supposedly belonged to which legendary ruler, before passing on to the Maharaja of Cooch Behar?

 5. In 1950, the Calcutta Cricket Club formally handed over the Eden Gardens to which organisation? 

6. Finally, a question on a famous cricketer 

who dazzled the Eden crowd nearly 50 years ago. In 1958-59, which West Indian 

cricketer hit 256 at the Eden Gardens to score his debut Test century? 

TOPI-CAL 

There are many interesting anecdotes about the Eden 

Gardens and the men and women who played there. Once in the 1930s, a team from 

Natore defeated the Calcutta Cricket Club. While having tea after the game, the 

captain of the Calcutta Cricket Club asked the Maharaja of Natore about the number 

of professionals in his team. The Maharaja looked around the table, as if he was 

counting the professionals, and replied, ?Only one.? He pointed out that he considered 

himself as the sole professional, whereas all the other members of his team simply 

turned up to play at his invitation, out of their love for the game. The Maharaja 

considered himself the ?professional?, since, as he said, he had nothing else 

to do but play cricket!

ANSWERS 

 1. West Indies, in 1948-49; 2. Pakistan; 3. M. Azharuddin, 860 from seven matches; 4. Rani Rashmoni; 5. Cricket Association of Bengal; 6. Rohan Kanhai

 After signing up with global telecom operators like Vodafone and Cable amp; Wireless, city-based software product company Connectiva Systems is now looking at the Indian telecom space. 

 ?The average revenue per user (RPU) for Indian telecom operators is very low and so, everyone is trying to minimise revenue leakage. We are very bullish on the Indian market as our products offer revenue assurance, besides helping in system integration,? says Avi Basu, chief operating officer, Connectiva Systems. 

 According to him, the company is in talks with a number of Indian telecom majors who have shown interest in the company?s products, like Oneview and Onereview. 

 Onereview detects, prevents and monitors revenue leakage and enables revenue maximisation, while Oneview provides flexible business process-based solutions. 

 Besides tapping the Indian market, the four-year-old company, with offices in New Jersey and Calcutta, is also planning a fresh round of funding to finance its growth plans. 

 ?We started off in the US with funding from venture funds, Carthage and Ovation, which hold 35 per cent of the company between them. Now, we are ready for the next round of funding and are planning to mobilise around $10 million,? said Basu. 

 The company is setting an ambitious growth target as well. From a revenue of around $5 million, it is expecting to close the year with that figure. But Connectiva is expecting a 100 per cent growth in the next year.

 The top management feels the target will be achievable due to the strategy of expanding into markets like Europe, West Asia and Africa. 

 ?But all our initiatives on the technology front and research and development will be steered from Calcutta. We develop the products from Calcutta and will continue doing that. However, since we are not a BPO or a software services company, the growth in numbers will not be that phenomenal,? added Shyam Pillai, chief technology officer of the company. 

 As of now, the firm plans to double the headcount from the existing 60 to around 120 by the end of 2005. 

 ?When we decided to come to India, the venture funds were surprised that we were locating in Calcutta. But our experience has been great here,? summed up Amitava Maulik, vice-president, technology.

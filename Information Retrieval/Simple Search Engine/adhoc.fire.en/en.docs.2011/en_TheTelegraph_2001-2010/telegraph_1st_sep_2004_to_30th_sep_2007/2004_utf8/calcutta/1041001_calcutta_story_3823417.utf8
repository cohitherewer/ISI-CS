The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dozen bids for transit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Traffic in Calcutta may move at a snail?s pace, but a dozen companies, both Indian and foreign, have responded readily enough to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s invitation for bids to modernise the mass transit system in the city.

 Seven Indian and five foreign companies have responded to the invitation, which expired on September 15, officials said on Thursday. 

 Among the foreign firms are CSR Sefang Locomotive of China, KLRS of UK, Amex International (Czech), ILFS amp; Taxia of Singapore and Connex of France. Indian ones, like Konkan Railways, Alsthom, Bharat Heavy Electricals and Gammon are also in the fray.

 The government would like to introduce either a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) System or Light Rail Transit (LRT) System to connect different parts of the city. 

 The project will have to be implemented fully or partly on a build-operate-transfer basis and the track will be elevated, without disturbing vehicular movement on the roads.

 ?We have engaged Consulting Engineering Services (CES) to shortlist the bids? A final decision will be taken on the basis of the shortlist,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said. 

 ?Different companies, like Skybus and LRT, have made offers. We will have to see which proposal can be executed fast, with minimum investment and maximum benefits.?

 According to officials from the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC), the agency that had floated the tender, five more companies, including three from abroad, have sought more time to submit their offers. 

 They were unable to procure the necessary documents and complete the formalities for foreign investment. A decision will be taken soon.

 Concerned over the rising number of vehicles in and around the city, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to introduce a modern mode of transport to ease the chaos and increase vehicular speed. 

 The government is in favour of the LRT, as it takes little space to lay the elevated track and will not disrupt traffic services during construction.

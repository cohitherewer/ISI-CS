The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Table set for talks on beam return

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The India-Bangladesh Test came to a tame end on Monday, but the cable countdown to Friday has already picked up pace.

 The piracy machine ? working efficiently enough on Sunday to prompt ESPN STAR Sports to threaten moving business out of the city ? is also taking a breather, but the truce table is busy with three days to go for the second Test at Chittagong.

 Tuesday marked telephonic talks between ESPN STAR Sports and Indian Cable Net, one of the two multi-system operators (MSO) on whose network the sports bouquet has been off for the past three weeks owing to a dues dispute.

 ?As far as piracy is concerned, we are weighing legal options and deciding on the best approach,? revealed a spokesperson for the broadcaster that had earlier alleged ?state-sponsored piracy? had allowed several city cable homes to witness Sachin Tendulkar?s career best knock on Sunday.

 ?We have had some discussions with ESPN STAR Sports and hope to reach a solution in the next few days,? was the word from Indian Cable Net.

 Also on Tuesday, a section of cable operators met representatives of all the broadcasters to voice their grievances.

 ?In the past year, most MSOs have signed contracts with broadcasters without taking operators into confidence,? alleged a spokesperson for Forum of Cable Operators, which organised the meet. ?As a result, we are getting to know about rate and subscription base increases much later, and only when a payment problem occurs.?

 The last-mile operator is expected to come under another round of consumer pressure starting Thursday, when the high-profile Australia-Pakistan series gets underway. 

 The pressure is billed to peak once the Team India batting brigade gets into the act over the weekend.

 Tuesday?s talks come in the wake of the failure of a marathon meeting on Saturday involving ESPN STAR Sports, Indian Cable Net and Manthan, at the behest of the state administration. 

 That was the first time in recent history that government intervention failed to bring back the sports beam.

 ESPN STAR Sports also remains off-limits in parts of Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Ludhiana and Kerala, due to outstandings and contract-related issues with MSOs Hathway and Asianet.

 Shopfest focus on Brand Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the deluge damper, Puja shopping was back on track by Friday, and with the Kolkata Shopping Festival kicking off on Sunday towing its clutch of carnival collateral, the momentum is expected to gather more steam.

 Conceptualised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry (BCCI) in association with West Bengal Tourism, the 10-day window leading up to the festivities is part of a branding exercise to showcase Calcutta?s buying power and change perception.

 ?Its extremely important to project a new brand image of Bengal. Brand Bengal should spell quality and confidence to enthuse giants like Wal-Mart and Marks amp; Spencer to come and do business here,? said A.K. Patnaik, principal secretary, tourism. The state?s role is of ?guarantor? for logistics and clearances.

 The chamber is keen to project the festival as a ?signature event?, and has lined up a series of ?fun? activities to whip up excitement in allied sectors. Thus, a festival privilege card will be front-loaded with benefits and a lucky draw will offer bumper prizes.

 ?We would like to involve a large number of retailers from all segments to be part of the event,? said BCCI president Biswadip Gupta. To ensure a wider compass, the Federation of Traders Organisation (FTO) of West Bengal has been roped in.

 FTO general secretary T.N. Trivedi promised all cooperation from the 50 lakh-plus traders under the federation umbrella to make the shopfest a success. 

 ?However, the civic body and the government should work in tandem to ensure better infrastructure for traders,? he observed.

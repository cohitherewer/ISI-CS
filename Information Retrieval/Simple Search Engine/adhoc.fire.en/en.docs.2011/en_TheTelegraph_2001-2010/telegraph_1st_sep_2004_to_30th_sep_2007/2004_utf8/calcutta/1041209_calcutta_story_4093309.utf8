 Sparkler park gets aye from Mumbai

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 A delegation from Mumbai?s Zaveri Bazar Diamond Merchants? Association is here to discuss with the state government plans for setting up Bengal?s first export-oriented diamond complex at Salt Lake. The proposed diamond park is to be ready by 2005.

 ?We have come to express our positive response to the West Bengal government?s appeal to the Bengali diamond jewellery-manufacturers in Mumbai, seeking participation in the Rs 30-crore Diamond Complex joint venture,? said Jagannath Haldar, president of Zaveri Bazar Bengali Association. 

 ?The proposed complex will come up adjacent to Monikanchan, in Salt Lake,?Haldar added.

 State industry minister Nirupam Sen has offered the jewellers subsidies on gas, electricity and bank interest. 

 Besides, there will be a 10-year moratorium on income-tax and an opportunity for the manufacturing units to import machinery without paying duty.

 ?Our main requirement for setting up units here, however, is an assurance from the government that there will be no ?kam bandh?-style trade union movement in the complex,? said Haldar. 

 ?We are grateful to MP Sudhanshu Sil, because it is he who first approached us with a proposal for setting up a diamond complex in Calcutta,? Haldar added.

 Apart from Haldar, the delegation of 25 leading diamond merchants of Dhanji Street, in the Zaveri Bazar area of Mumbai, includes Koch Gain, Barin Das, Rajendra Kumar Das, Manoj Parui and Arun Sinha Roy.

 ?A number of diamond jewellery manufacturers from Mumbai have complained that of late, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started bothering them on pollution grounds and is insisting that they shift their units elsewhere,? said Sudhansu Sil. 

 Also, a section of the realtor lobby has reportedly targeted the land occupied by jewellers in Zaveri Bazar.

 According to Barin Das, punctuality is extremely important in the export market, and a manufacturing unit cannot afford to miss deadlines due to labour trouble or bandhs.

 ?Bengal has everything we need ? a market, international links, entrepreneurs and a skilled workforce. But the kam bandh image has made the state a little risky for investment. In Mumbai, too, there are problems and bandhs. But the bandhs never affect the manufacturing units,? Das said.

 The delegation will meet the chief minister and industry minister next week. 

 A memorandum of understanding is expected to be signed between the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) and the builders of the complex after the meeting.

 The joint venture will be on a profit-sharing basis, and the WBIDC?s investment will be 2.5 acres of land, disclosed an official of the corporation.

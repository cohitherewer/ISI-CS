The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Old haunt, new hues

MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA, HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

After 15 years in the business of hospitality, Taj Bengal has some reason for cheer. And with a number of value-additions up its sleeve, things can only get brighter in the next few years.

 A rain-drenched Thursday afternoon saw general manager Sanjay Sethi share the five-star destination?s plans to pack in more punch for its client base.

 A new car service is going to be the first add-on to be rolled out. ?A fleet of 12 cars, equipped with DVD players and screens on the back of seats, will allow guests to travel in comfort, while watching movies and other shows,? revealed Sethi.

 While the cars should hit the road by the month-end, a two-year plan involves a revamp of the food and beverage outlets. A new resto-bar will take the place of Incognito and Chinoiserie?s Oriental offering will be overhauled.

 ?The designs are in place, but we will wait for the peak season to finish before we start work,? added Sethi. The projects should commence in April. However, to tide over the busy winter, Chinoiserie has followed Sonargaon with its enhanced menu.

 Dramatic ?soft changes? at the Indian-speciality restaurant, unveiled earlier this year, have been very well received. ?Revenues are up 70 per cent at Sonargaon, post revamp,? said Sethi.

 A butler-on-call service has also been recently introduced.

 Despite the entry of two new hotels in the five-star segment in the past two years, the market has shown encouraging growth. ?In 2003-04, the industry grew 16 per cent over the previous year. This year, the figure already stands at 12 to 13 per cent, and we expect to close with around 17 per cent growth in 2004,? explained the general manager. Revenues, too, should be up from last years? Rs 44 crore to around Rs 52 crore.

 The numbers have also been helped by a rising average room rate in the city. ?The average rate is around Rs 3,500 per night, including airline crew rates. The corporate rate is around Rs 4,500,? he pointed out. Corporates currently make up around 50 per cent of Taj?s business.

 Bullish Sethi may be, but the luxury hotel segment is currently saturated, and no expansion plans are in the offing. However, the Taj group?s budget brand Indione, is on the lookout for property in east India, and ?hopes to be operational within three years?.

 Party animals have a brand new hangout to chill out at this weekend. 

 What was once the London Pub at The Golden Park has been revamped into a new funzone ? Fusion. The 9,000-sq-ft restaurant-cum-lounge bar now boasts of a 120-cover speciality Chinese restaurant serving up Mongolian and Italian fare at its interactive kitchen counter, the USP being ?drink, eat and dance?, not necessarily in that order. 

 Restricted entry is the buzzword at this nightspot with owner B. S. Gujral hoping to right the equation that went wrong the last time. ?The venue is meant for families and couples only. Stags will be kept at bay and stricter screening will ensure entry to high-profile guests only,? he detailed. No amount of plastic money or green bucks will lure them to compromise on this stance, Gujral went on to clarify with a ?no cover charge or entry fees? promise. 

 The interiors boast of space and style, with an interesting interplay of bright and dull colours setting the mood. Violet ceiling and walls, red dome lights, yellow sofas and large, low-lying round tables make for a cosy yet chic setting. 

 Music played here goes for a little revamp as well. While resident DJ Suraj does offer to play requests on weekdays, weekends will be dedicated to the dance floor with a special emphasis on hip-hop and remixes. 

 There are plans to combat day-time dryness also. ?We will be offering a lunch buffet for the office-goers of the area,? said Gujral, intending to put the property to optimum use. 

 Lounges seem to be the hottest hangouts for creatures of the night at the moment, the Red Hot Kitchen and Lounge being a case in point even though it is yet awaiting a bar licence. A Delhi-based company putting finishing touches to a Lebanese lounge and a ?kebabs only? eatery formally opening at City Centre in the middle of October augur well for some lazy lounging.

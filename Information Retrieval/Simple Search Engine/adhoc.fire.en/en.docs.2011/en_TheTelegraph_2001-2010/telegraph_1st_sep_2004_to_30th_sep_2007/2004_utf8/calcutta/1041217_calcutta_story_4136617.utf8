The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

Beware if you feel like cosying up at a disco, for 

the prying eyes and a sneak?s cell phone is never far away. Your MMS clip may 

not be worth a splash that Kareena?s kiss got, but the steam might hot up another 

Ravi Raj?s imagination! Stick to some safe banter instead, when hitting the nightspots.

 Kareena kiss

The splash in a Mumbai tabloid of the Kapoor girl 

getting some lip action with boyfriend Shahid is causing some reactionary lip 

action around these parts, too. 

Bitchiest banter: ?Nice try to get herself some talk 

time again, since her films are not worth a dekho in any case,? to ?the 

chocolate boy seems so tame for her. Bet it?s Kareena who made the first move? 

? anything goes as far as the flop queen is concerned. 

Enrique intrigue

Have they, haven?t they? That?s the debate sure to 

start in the wake of reports of pop star Enrique Iglesias and retired tennis beauty 

Anna Kournikova having tied the knot. Fans of both can join the fun, with a little 

mock tirade about their heartthrobs leaving them in the lurch. Or go in for some 

good ol? sour grapes-style lambasting of the ?Britney Spears of tennis? and the 

?sappy pop icon?.

Musafir mix

And you?d better stay home if you aren?t in tune with 

the hottest flick in town. In case you?re yet to catch it, here?s the low down: 

It?s a Hindi movie all right but the characters in Sanjay Gupta?s Musafir are 

straight out of the world of Quentin Tarantino. They speak a different lingo, 

dress up like Armani models, but still manage to break into the typical song-and-dance 

routine with the utmost ease. With Sanjay Dutt perfecting the cool don act as 

Billa and Anil Kapoor returning in a whole new avatar, Musafir is certainly 

the hottest film in town. And not just because of Sameera Reddy, who apparently 

has chosen to do away with her wardrobe for the film?

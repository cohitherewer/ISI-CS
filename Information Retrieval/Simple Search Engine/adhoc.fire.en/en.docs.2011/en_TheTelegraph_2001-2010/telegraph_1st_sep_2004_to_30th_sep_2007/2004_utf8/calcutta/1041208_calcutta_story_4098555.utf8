The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gallery lifeline for needy kids

 - Sales fraction to help blood disorder patients

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 

 From Cincinnati to Calcutta, she has travelled thousands of miles for a cause. Come Thursday, she will realise her dream.

 Aradhna Singh, an art teacher who shuttles between the city and the US, is all set to throw open the doors of an art gallery named Plasma, with the objective of helping children suffering from blood disorders.

 About 25 per cent of the proceeds from the gallery will be used to help children suffering from diseases like leukaemia, thalassaemia, lymphoma and haemophilia. 

 ?Whenever a person buys a work of art at the gallery, he or she will help a child survive. The gallery is not like other galleries in Calcutta; it is an installation art on the theme of blood,? said Singh. 

 ?We will not hand over the cash to the families to prevent misuse. Instead, we will hand over blood coupons,? Singh added.

 Watching a near one die of leukaemia prompted Singh to head back to India from Cincinnati, where she is based, and start helping children suffering from blood disorders.

 ?I went to the hospitals and saw how hundreds of children queue up every morning for blood. Many do not have access to blood or their parents do not have the money to buy it. I decided to do something for them,? she recalled.

 Two years ago, she floated Hue?n?I, an organisation supporting and conducting art workshops for people of all ages in the city, while continuing to help thalassaemia patients with blood coupons. 

 There are approximately 1,500 thalassaemia patients and a thousand registered haemophilia patients in Calcutta. ?There are many patients who are not registered. Several do not have access to treatment,? elaborated Sharmila Chandra, a city-based haematologist.

 Even paediatricians in the city occasionally treat patients with blood disorders. ?Adequate blood on a regular basis is the most important requirement of these patients. Therefore, any cause which can support these children is welcome,? opined paediatrician B.K. Manocha.

 The employees at Plasma, on Alipore Road, are also suffering from blood disorders or are physically handicapped. 

 ?The lack of mobility prevents them from maintaining a steady job elsewhere, but they are more than welcome at Plasma,? Singh said.

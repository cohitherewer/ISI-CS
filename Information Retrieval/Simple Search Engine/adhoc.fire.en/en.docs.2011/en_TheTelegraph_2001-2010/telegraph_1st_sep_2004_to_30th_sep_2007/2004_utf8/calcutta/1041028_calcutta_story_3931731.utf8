The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cops pledge terror sops

 - Extortion in trade hubs peaks during festive season 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Case I: Mid-October, four youths from a Durga puja committee in Mullickbazar called on the owner of a Park Street sari shop, demanding Rs 5,000 as subscription. The trader called the Lalbazar police headquarters the next day. ?I am not lodging a formal complaint as I fear for my life,? he said. But working on the tip-off, police booked two puja organisers on robbery charges as they couldn?t establish the case of chanda extortion.

 Case II: A north Calcutta puja organiser demanded Rs 3,000 from a wholesale grocer in the Posta-Burrabazar area. The trader first refused to pay the amount and then asked them to reduce it. The request fell on deaf ears and the youths came back the next day. The man had no choice but to pay up.

 These are just two examples of the large scale, silent extortion of businessmen and professionals by organisers of not-so-friendly neighbourhood or community Durga and Kali pujas across the city.

 On Wednesday, Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (I), detective department, said it was difficult for the force to crack down as victims, unlike the Shahs of Girish Park, did not come forward with formal complaints.

 ?Incidents of forcible collection of subscription are taking place across the city. But victims, usually well-established traders or professionals, are paying up instead of coming to us. A formal complaint enables us to initiate action,? said Pandey.

 That claim, of course, can be contested by Prem Chand Shah and his family.

 Extortion has reportedly been rampant in areas like Burrabazar, Posta, Jorasanko, Chandni Chowk, Park Street, Mullickbazar, Gariahat, Tollygunge, Lake Town, Dum Dum and Howrah. The demand often starts at around Rs 3,000 and goes up to Rs 50,000.

 Police also anticipate similar cases cropping up during Kali puja and Diwali celebrations. ?This is the season of high spending,? said Timir Bhattacharya, officer-in-charge, Jorasanko thana. ?Miscreants target individuals who shell out Rs 5,000 or Rs 10,000, thinking the police won?t be able to help.?

 Like one trader from Jorasanko who paid Rs 23,000 as subscription this year. ?I want to run my business smoothly. Had I informed police, what would they do? How long could they protect me?? he asked.

 But top cops urge victims to break their silence. ?Those serious about putting an end to this business must come forward and help us initiate legal proceedings against such rogues,? stressed Pandey.

 Try telling Prem Chand Shah that.

 What?s in a name, just be game

 That Bollywood is not into Shakespeare is evident from the way it picks its titles. That a lot does depend on the name of the film and that the rose does smell different with certain titles is indeed the order of the Friday in tinsel town. 

 Some like it long, others leave it short, some take a corny turn, others flaunt philosophy. But almost each film that releases comes with the conviction that the name it is known by could make or break it at the box-office. 

 These days, the reasons for assigning a title to a Hindi film can be anything from awe to shock, numerology to lyrical lines. 

 Yash Chopra?s choice of name for his new love legend might have cost him a bigger hit. While Veer-Zaara definitely has a ring to it, the original choice, Yeh Hum Aa Gaye Hai Kahaan would have been more in line with the recent celluloid romantic rockers in Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and even Kal Ho Naa Ho. 

 That Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta?s characters have not been able to come anywhere close to the legends in Heer-Ranjha or Laila-Majnu shows the futility in trying to design a myth through a title.

 The master of one-word titles, Ram Gopal Varma must be wondering where he?s going wrong. The maker of Shiva, Rangeela, Daud, Satya, Company and Bhoot tried to be different, going for never-ending titles like Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon or halfway houses like Darna Mana Hai.

 If they didn?t bring in the audiences, Varma picking Vaastu Shastra proved disastrous for the Sourabh Usha Narang directorial venture. The film had nothing to do with the ancient house science and the original title Shanti Kutir might have been a safer bet for Sushmita Sen and company. The name Naach, along with the film?s promos, made people believe that it was another Rangeela. But it turned out to be too different for the viewer to link title with screen truth. 

 Up ahead, Varma is in experimental mode with the titles of his forthcoming films. Murder At Shree Krishna Building has been shortened to Galti Se, and the prequel to Company is called just D (it can?t get smaller).

 The most eagerly-awaited films in the next couple of months have one-word titles. There?s Sanjay Gupta?s stylish Musafir, Rituparno Ghosh?s first Hindi effort Raincoat, Ashutosh Gowariker?s Swades and Sanjay Leela Bhansalis songless wonder Black. 

 Other short titles include Leena Bajaj?s Sanjay Dutt-Aishwarya Rai-starrer Shabd, Satish Kaushik?s love triangle Vaada, Vikram Bhatt?s multi-starrer Elaan and Saurabh Shukla?s psychological thriller Chehraa, starring Bipasha Basu and Dino Morea. Pooja Bhatt too is strictly into short titles with her debut Paap and now Rog. 

 If the short ones are classy, the long ones are young and wacky. Arindam Chaudhuri?s directorial debut, in tune with his chief inspiration, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, is titled Rok Sako To Rok Lo. Mahesh Manjrekar?s new comedy has four characters in its title ? Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav. 

 If the campus romance title aims to excite and create a zing, the comedy has chosen a name with political overtones and leveraged Laloo to the fullest.

Anil Sharma has gone retro with his new patriotic saga Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Sathiyo. The long-in-the-waiting Salman-Shilpa starrer is laboriously named Shaadi Karke Phas Gaya Yaar. Shahid Kapur has three heroines and a Pepsi slogan to handle in Dil Maange More. 

 If there?s cola, there has to be chocolate. Film critic Samar Khan makes his debut with a film titled after the Cadbury?s catchline Kuch Meetha Ho Jaye. Coming not too far from Kabir Sadanand?s Popcorn Khao Mast Ho Jao!, it reaffirms Bollywood?s connect with junk food GenX.

 With film titles, it?s a great idea not to be too rigid. Doing justice to the content and sending the right message across to the audiences should be the priority. If the master of long titles, Karan Johar, can name his new film Kaal, exception is the rule of the name game.

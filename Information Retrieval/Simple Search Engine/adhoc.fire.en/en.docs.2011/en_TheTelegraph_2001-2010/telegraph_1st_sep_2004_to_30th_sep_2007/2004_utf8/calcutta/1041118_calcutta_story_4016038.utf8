The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Star strings

 ?You?ve got two of me,? smiled Anoushka, checking out the freeze-frame, captured in Saffron at The Park. Picture by Pabitra Das 

 Masala chai is all she cares for. ?But not too black,? insists Anoushka Shankar as she chalks out her itinerary for bandh day in Calcutta. ?I would love to go around the city, but I don?t think that?s going to happen. Spa and movies should be a good idea,? says the star sitar player, as she lazes around in Saffron, the Indian restaurant at The Park.

 Anoushka has been in Calcutta ?quite a few times? but has ?never really seen the city?. This week-long visit is a professional one though, to record her ?fourth album? with the likes of Tanmoy Bose, Bikram Ghosh, Vishwamohan Bhatt and Tarun Bhattacharya.

 It?s rather difficult to get Pandit Ravi Shankar?s daughter to speak about her new album. ?I?m a believer in not blabbing about things till they happen. So I feel it would be better to talk about the album once it actually becomes an album and is ready to be released,? she says firmly.

 Anoushka is ready to talk about the experience though. ?The recording?s going really well and we are in fact ahead of time. I am just having a lot of fun and not even thinking about the consequences. I am just hoping that the album is out before I start performing again.?

 Anoushka is in the middle of a ?sabbatical from touring? and will only return mid-April. ?All my shows have been planned till winter. The tours have been organised down to the smallest detail, including shows in Morocco. I am really looking forward to the concerts.?

 The break has also meant that her father is performing without her after almost 10 years. ?He is doing just fine. Touch wood. But he is surely missing me,? smiles Anoushka, a touch emotional.

 Actor Anoushka has taken a backseat after her debut in Pamela Rooks? Dance Like A Man. ?Many dancers who saw the film liked my Bharatanatyam in the film. But it was never meant for the masses. It was always a very niche film. These days people do not make films about our classical arts and I am really happy that I could be in one.?

 But she is not in a rush to be under the arclights again. ?I wanted to do films. I did one, and now, I will do a lot more music again.?

 There is one film, though, that Anoushka regrets having lost out on. ?Mira Nair offered me the role of Moushumi in The Namesake. I even read the part from the script,? reveals Anoushka. ?But she (Nair) intends to shoot in the US between February and April and that will be way too close to my shows. I really want to prepare myself well before I make a return to the stage.?

Plans of performing here in Calcutta are also on, 

but that won?t be possible till next winter. Till then, it is the ?mishti doi? 

which will keep her going. ?I also love Bengali food. Back home, my mother is 

usually into a lot of south Indian food, but every now and then my father insists 

on having good Bengali food. It?s just great!?

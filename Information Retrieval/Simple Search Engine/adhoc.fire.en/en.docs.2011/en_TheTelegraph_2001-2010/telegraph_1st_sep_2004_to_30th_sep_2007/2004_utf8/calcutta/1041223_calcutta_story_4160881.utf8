Mayor Subrata Mukherjee initiated discussions with the state government on a proposal to bring all families, traders and vehicle-owners living in the city under an ?infrastructure cess? net.

 ?With citizens aspiring for a better lifestyle, and given the high maintenance cost of utility services, it is a luxury for a civic body to offer better amenities absolutely free,? pointed out Mukherjee. 

 What he proposed was not a tax, but something like a cess, that will be an ?affordable token amount.? 

 Anybody living in the city and using its better-maintained roads, brighter streetlights, filtered water and salubrious environment should be prepared to share the burden of maintenance along with the house-owners, he reasoned.

 Tenants, slum-dwellers, hawkers, owners of trucks, buses, cars, taxis and auto-rickshaws all enjoy the benefits of a better city infrastructure for free.

 ?It is a problem not only for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) but for all municipalities,? the mayor said. ?Something should be done to make the civic authorities financially more sound, without putting an extra load on the handful of house-owners, who are already overburdened,? said municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya. 

 This is possible only through a wider scale of financial participation by the users and the beneficiaries of the civic amenities, he added.

 Bhattacharya said to offer some relief to house-owners, the amount of property tax has been slashed from 40 per cent to 30 per cent of the annual valuation in Calcutta and Howrah. House-owners in Calcutta are the most unfortunate landlords in the country, as each is forced by the CMC to cough up taxes for four other families living free in the city.

 According to mayor Mukherjee, four types of ?guest families? living in the city enjoy all the civic facilities without paying a single paisa ? slum-dwellers, tenants, settlers in colonies and the floating population from neighbouring states and Bangladesh.

 While placing the Howrah Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2004, in the Assembly, minister Bhattacharya said on Monday that the civic body should not fear that it may lose its popularity by collecting taxes. 

 ?You have no option, but to put a stress on the collection of taxes. Civic bodies in Bengal are providing basic amenities to the people and they have the right to collect taxes for the services,? the minister added.

Lingering luxury

Customer comfort quotient is high with 

waiting not such a woe, says Zeeshan Jawed

A visit to a post-office or a bank was as close to 

Chinese torture as it could get, even just the other day. Babus, either 

acting like boulders or proffering dry palms waiting to be greased, and red tape 

extending from entrance to exit and back... The revulsion wave rode higher because 

of the ambience, the horror look and the hostile feel.

A half-opened collapsible gate would greet you on 

arrival, beyond which sat some of the laziest people possible, parked in coop-like 

cabins and quarrelling over endless khullars of tea.

But things are changing, and how. With companies realising 

the worth of consumer comfort, everything from the waiting area to the business 

floor is being spruced up. Here?s spending some time in office spaces where the 

comfort factor rules both waiting and working.

Cool zones

Visiting a foreign bank or a multinational company?s 

office is anything but a nightmare. From entry to exit and back, the comfort content 

is well taken care of. The doors are flung open by hospitable security guards 

rather than hostile fourth-class staff members.

Inside, the walls are done up in bright colours rather 

than beetle juice designs. No-smoking rules have changed gas chambers into clean-air 

counters. Proper lighting arrangements ensure there are no dark corners in office. 

The cool atmosphere and the well-kept lounges, coffee kiosks, piped music, proper 

seating arrangements and lifestyle magazines ensure the wait is a pleasurable 

one ? okay, almost.

Attitude?s all

Consumer is king. So all multinationals and large 

private concerns are adopting a customer-centric approach. Long gone are the days 

when queries were met by bloodshot eyes and polite requests for normal work pace 

were shot down. Attitude ? of the purely positive kind ? now is everything.

?Ten years ago if I would go to a post-office, a railway 

reservation centre or a bank I would never like to go back again. But things have 

started looking up now,? says Shanker Kaul, a businessman waiting to get some 

work done at a multinational bank. According to Kaul, it is the professional approach 

and the co-operative attitude that keep customers comfortable.

Client capture

But why should a company or a bank spend so much just 

to please an existing customer? ?It?s always the repeat customers who give you 

the maximum business so it?s necessary to give them special treatment. The key 

components in marketing and business growth is to spend the majority of your time 

and effort nurturing customer relationships,? says a spokesperson for ABN Amro 

Bank. 

According to him, such an exercise increases the business 

a lot without increasing the budget by much. So if it is imperative to get new 

customers for the business, it is mandatory to maintain the customers you already 

have. ?If a customer comes and stands in front of you, it helps to welcome him 

with a warm smile. That gives him the confidence to open up to you,? says the 

spokesperson.

The smile, followed up by service that makes the customer 

feel almost at home, is a small thing with a big impact.

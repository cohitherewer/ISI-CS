 Letters

Watery farewell: Many, many thanks for the brilliant photograph 

by Pabitra Das on October 25 of a Durga idol being immersed. The photograph was 

indeed worth a thousand words, and more. 

Anil Kumar Sen,

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane

 It is no surprise that both the chief minister and urban development minister 

of West Bengal have denied the newspaper reports that they have made any ?adverse? 

comments against the judiciary as conveyed to the high court by the state advocate-general 

(Minister denies slur on justice, October 16). Then it must be the brazen work 

of another anti-government conniver hiding among the media members who has concocted 

the story with an oblique motive against the ruling party. Except a video-recording, 

there is hardly any chance for any hard evidence of the exact words used by the 

ministers before the press. But when similar reports appear in different news 

organisations, is it believable that the story was cooked up by a ?mass? conspiracy 

of the reporters?

The unscrupulous political leaders in our country hardly care for any repercussions from the judicial branch for reasons more than one. There is no denying that our judicial system is already handicapped with an acute shortage of fund and manpower. This has provided our impervious political leaders near-immunity against any suo motu action by the court for their brash behaviour. But on the rare instance when our leaders are caught on the wrong foot, little wonder they blame it all on the innocent reporters. After all, we have a skilled advocate-general who would strenuously defend the leaders of the Writers Building in the time of crisis, leaving the hapless reporters to face the wrath of the court. This must be the new definition of quot;democracy quot; for the communists. 

Dr Kunal Saha,

It is a matter of great concern that almost all the city?s private diagnostic centres and clinics shut down during Puja (Puja halt on health, courier services, October 22). Besides, most city doctors, especially the specialists, go on vacation during the period. Patients in critical condition either suffer terribly during Puja or have to be admitted to expensive private hospitals. 

 If couriers shut shop during Puja, at least the postal department?s speed post section can fill the vacuum somewhat; but if private pathological and diagnostic centres remain closed, there is hardly any alternative. What does one do in a life-and-death situation? 

 In Europe and America, services of private pathological centres and diagnostic clinics are never suspended during Christmas. Doctors also are readily accessible. Even private courier services are available round the clock. We are definitely an ?underdeveloped country? as far as these aspects are concerned. 

Diptimoy Ghosh, 

Salt Lake. 

Apropos the report ?Worship by camaraderie, not creed?, October 19, it was heartening to know that the New Market 54 Pally Durgotsav committee has taken the initiative to involve members of all communities in the local Puja. The basic objective of Durga Puja is fostering brotherhood among communities. Therefore, this is one locality where the festival is being celebrated in the true spirit. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee, 

Nayapatty Road. 

Apropos the report ?Township trees in fell peril?, October 20, it is well-known that environmental balance cannot be maintained without preserving trees. Hence, it is alarming that trees are being ruthlessly cut for construction. Rampant felling of trees in Salt Lake has taken a toll on the health of the residents. The situation could spell doom for the township. 

Piyal Mukherjee,

Lake Town. 

This is apropos Sona Murshed?s letter in this column on October 21. If the district headquarter of South 24-Parganas can move out of the city to Baruipur, it is incomprehensible why the animals of the zoo cannot. Is the collectorate any less a landmark than the zoo? At Baruipur, the animals will breathe easy as the pollution level is low. It is surprising that to Ms Murshed, the vanity of the landmark is more important than the quality of life of the animals. When the zoo was opened in 1875, Alipore was no more developed than what Baruipur is today. A large chunk of the visitors come from South 24-Parganas who will find it convenient. It will also get rid of the queues near National Library, gridlocking a busy thoroughfare of the city on winter mornings. 

Chameli Pal, 

Batanagar.

The birthday section on October 21 came as a tremendous surprise. Shammi Kapoor, the heartthrob of yesteryear, whose birthday it was, seems to have undergone a phenomenal physical change. He is now a pale shadow of his young and vibrant self. 

Prahlad Agarwala, 

Nadia.

Calcutta was once considered a city of gentlemen. Hence, it is shocking to note how barbaric people have become. It is sad that a man who spent the better part of his life protecting the country, had to face such torture for refusing Rs 5,000 as Puja subscription (Family stabbed for puja fee refusal, October 15). 

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

Beleghata.

In my childhood, I saw my parents subjected to extortion 

by the local puja committees. Now I am a parent, but the picture has not changed. 

We are ordered to pay up if we want the safety of our family, especially children. 

People who can threaten to harm children cannot be any less inhuman than the goons 

who held schoolchildren hostage at Beslan. Could the Bengali ?bhadralok? 

devise a better way of celebrating Puja? 

Smita Toppo,

Address not given. 

Apropos the picture in City Diary on October 21, I want to congratulate Asia Rescue amp; Medical Services for launching the city?s first fully-dedicated, critical-care ambulance. The service will solve a long-standing problem. 

Dalim Kumar Datta, 

A.P.C. Road.

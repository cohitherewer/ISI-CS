 Mobile found in jail search

 BARUN GHOSH

 A day after the police complained about Sheikh Vinod running an extortion racket beyond the jail walls with the help of his mobile phone, officers of Alipore Central jail went on a search and dug out a set from the courtyard facing his cell. Wrapped in polythene, the cell phone lay hidden in the mud.

 Vinod, lodged in the jail since his re-arrest last year after fleeing Dum Dum Central jail, has been accused of running an extortion racket by issuing instructions over his cell phone. 

 The police allegation came after a marathon interrogation of five Vinod associates, including brother Sheikh Asgar and brother-in-law Sheikh Nasir, arrested in Dhakuria early on Monday. A cell phone was seized from Asgar.

 Though a search of Vinods cell early on Tuesday proved futile, deputy inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya spotted the cell phone around 11.30 am during a special search.

 Two life convicts, Alauddin and Sheikh Samsuddin, helped him dig it out of the courtyard. A senior jail official said the cell phone, without a SIM card, must have been buried in the courtyard on Vinods instructions after the arrest of his henchmen. He said two lifers and over a dozen warders were being questioned to ascertain how a mobile phone reached Vinods cell. 

 Minutes after the recovery, inspector-general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty met jail superintendent Ranjit Mondal and deputy inspector-general (security) Ashoke Dhar at Writers Buildings and asked them to keep mum on the development. This is really an embarrassment, he told them.

 Insiders said Vinods wife Nasima, who called on him three weeks ago, may have passed on the cell phone to Vinod through some warders.

 Khowabnama: Building dreams 

 Khowabnama 

 The famous Akhtaruzzaman Ellias novel has been transposed on stage on a large scale by Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra. Labelling it a product of ?the youth of today? and with The Dream Narrative as tagline, the play records the rewriting of history by ordinary men and women. Dramatised by Samir Dasgupta, the play has been directed by Kishore Sengupta, with some innovative lighting by the 60-plus Dipak Mukhopadhyay.

Catch it at Girish Mancha, 6.30 pm on Sunday

Khunje Nao

 Sohini in Khunje Nao: Method in madness 

 Satyabati?s beautiful world comes crumbling down when 

mental illness takes hold of her. As the ailment gets more pronounced with time, 

the bubbly teenager is packed off to an asylum, while her parents struggle to 

cope with the crisis at home. Under Swatilekha Sengupta?s direction, Sohini delivers 

a powerful performance as the deranged Satyabati, with flashes of the same brilliance 

she had shown in Aparna Sen?s Paromitar Ekdin. This Rangroop production 

is derived from a play by Olwen Wymark.

 Catch it at Academy of Fine Arts, 3 pm on Saturday

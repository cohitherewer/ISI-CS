 Prabir De brushes on a bronze style this Navami

 Before you know it, the fun will be over, so if you have been hesitating thus far, Navami is the time to pull out all the stops. Everyone wants to make the most of the festive spirit with their finery in dressing and jewellery. By this time, most of your pandal-hopping is probably done and the young are restless for fun on their own terms. 

 But to get into the true Navami look, one must make a formal statement that conforms to no rules or regulations. While you may have chosen to play it casual till now, it is finally time to pull out that special sari. Prabir De prescribes the perfect make-up to go with it.

Step 1

 Once more, get yourself ready for the usual cleansing regimen, leaving your skin fresh and ready to deal with another layer of make-up. Apply foundation, taking care to cover up any spots and blemishes that may have appeared after a couple of days of excess, but still ensure the final effect is natural. Use a brush and gently apply some bronzer powder to keep the surface of your skin shiny and natural. The look for the day is bronze and hence a tanning cream (not too much!) may help create that ideal sheen.

Step 2

 Finally, the mood of the day is just right to stun with smoky eyes.

 Use some brown and gold eye-shadow and spread it evenly across the upper eyelids. Take a brush and lightly dab a bit around the lower lid corners as well. Use a silver highlighter to add a shiny finish. Make sure you use a very dark kajal as an eyeliner for the upper lids as well as a marker for the lower ones. It won?t be complete without adding heaps of mascara to liven up those lashes.

Step 3

 Use a lipstick that highlights and complements the bronze look of the day. Use a gold, bronze or dark orange lipstick (a fusion of all three might look great as well). Use a lipliner to outline and enhance the lips, providing a definitive look to them. Finish it off with lots of gloss. 

Step 4

 Finally, turn your attention to your cheeks. In keeping up with the smoky, dusky look for the day, use a blush-on within the same range and gently dab some on your face. However, for those who have used ample bronzer powder, this is not necessary at all. 

Perfect the package

 With the make-up look being rather bold, brazen and in-your-face, the hair may be kept chic but very simple. You could curl the front of your hair and leave the back open and natural. Strong curls are very in and this should definitely give an extra bit of bounce. 

 Attire for Navami should be very gorgeous and very Indian. Wearing a heavily embellished sari or lehnga would be appropriate. Top this off with colourful beads as jewellery.

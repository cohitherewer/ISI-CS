 Songs from the stage

 True to the tradition of Indian theatre, music has played a significant role on the Bengali stage as well. Earthy and cerebral, material and spiritual, music as a stage device has worked both as an effective medium of communication and a source of aesthetic fulfilment. To mark its 20th anniversary, Academy Theatre hosts Manchagaaner Jugalbandi, a festival of manchagaan (theatre-songs). Depicting the evolution of parallel trends in compositions of Bengali and Hindi theatre-songs of the 20th century, the concert demonstrates how these songs express emotions, reconcile conflicts and lead to the climax in plays that experiment with style and language. Drawing upon research in recordings, notations, prompt-books and clippings, they offer a fresh understanding of theatre as we know it. Featuring songs by Rangakarmee (Dir: Usha Ganguli) and Academy Theatre (Riddhi and Devajit Bandyopadhyay). Anchors: Urmimala and Jagannath Bose. Compilation and direction: Devajit Bandyopadhyay

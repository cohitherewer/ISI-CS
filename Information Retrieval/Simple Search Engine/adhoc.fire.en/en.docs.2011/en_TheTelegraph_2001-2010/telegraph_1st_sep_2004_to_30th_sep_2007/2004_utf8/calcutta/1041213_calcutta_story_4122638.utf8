 Demi Moore: Double take

More Moore magic

There?s so much more of Demi Moore on the small screen 

this month. Two very different films with the versatile actress in lead roles 

are being screened on HBO ? Indecent Proposal and Charlie?s Angels: 

Full Throttle. One a path-breaking tale of love, longing and loss, another 

an action film. In one she is a wife and lover, in the other she is kick-ass bad 

girl. So, time for Demi fans to catch their favourite star at her dynamic best.

 If you?re a Demi Moore worshipper, then Indecent Proposal is not to be missed, especially with Robert Redford and Woody Harrelson as the two male leads. In Full Throttle, the former Charlie?s Angel is back as a bad girl, ready to wreak havoc.

 Born Demetria Guynes in Roswell, New Mexico, the mother of three hasn?t had the easiest of lives. Her father abandoned her before she was born. Her stepfather abused her. She married at 18 and was divorced by 22. There was cocaine addiction, too.

 Marriage to star Bruce Willis and three daughters later, Demi went through another divorce. And although her marriage to actor Ashton Kutcher, almost half her age, kicked off some controversy, this is one Hollywood actress who just doesn?t give a damn. 

 On screen, her successful role-playing ranged from Ghost to Striptease, The Juror to G.I. Jane.

 Moore is now shooting for Half Light, to be released next year. The film is about an author who is devastated after her five-year-old son drowns and how she tries to rebuild her life in a small town. It is being shot on the Cornish coast in England, as well as in Ireland and Wales. The self-confessed caffeine addict apparently had a rough time in the villages where the film is located, because there were no Starbucks coffee shops around!

Akshay Kumar in Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo: War 

hero

 The Khans may still be on top in the Bollywood numbers game, but among the masses Akshay Khiladi Kumar is right up there on the popularity charts. And it is no surprise that he is also a huge hit with the Indian Army. 

 When he was last shooting in Manali for his new film Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo, Akshay made quite an impact on the jawans posted nearby. He played a cricket match with them and what?s more, he was even awarded an army commando cap after the bat-and-ball stint. 

 That?s not where Akki?s army connection ends. These days, the Aitraaz star is also sporting a prestigious army band which he was gifted, again by a group of army guys, at an exhibition of guns and artillery held last month at Shivaji Park. The action star obviously loved the guns and metal paraded in front of him and even checked out army tanks. 

 So even if the Anil Sharma film fails to pull in the audience, will the army brigade be out in force to cheer their screen hero?

Roller-coaster ride: Nuts and bolts

 Roller-coasters are real-life monsters, designed both to excite and terrify anyone who dares set foot on them. 

 The city has one at Nicco Park where the ropeway rises to 50 ft and covers around 1 km in three minutes. But few know what goes into making these screamers scary yet safe.

 Interviews with coaster designers, historians and riders tell the story of these remarkable feats of engineering, from the rudimentary form in 17th century Russia, to the 100-ft monsters that dot the skylines now throughout the world. 

 Building the Ultimate on Discovery Channel features John Miller?s 1912 invention of upstop wheels that prevented cars from flying off the track. Ed Morgan and Karl Bacon?s breakthrough materials that gave birth to all types of looping and twisting coasters in the 1960s. The hydraulic launch systems of today that propel riders to 100 miles per hour and more. 

 Experience the journey on Discovery at 9.30 pm on Wednesday. The series showcases the ultimate in engineering design in the world of high-tech transportation, weaponry and entertainment. 

 After the mixed response to the inaugural episode of Super Singer on Channel [V], the second show promises to be more enthralling with the Delhi finalists being announced. 

 Everyone from clinical psychologist Natasha to medical student Prashant to the visually challenged Saif is in contention to be the next vocal star of the country.

 The talent hunt journey also moves to Chandigarh, where thousands wait for their ticket to fame, standing in queue from four in the morning just for a chance to audition in front of judge Adnan Sami. 

 Amidst all the dhoom and dhamaal, arrives 12-year-old Kanak to fulfil his father?s last wish. Also watch out for ?humming bird? Satya Prakash, who comes to Chandigarh after being rejected in Delhi, and Deepak, the surprise lookalike of Adnan.

 In the Pink City of Jaipur, there are some intriguing contestants like Avinash, who plays an?unusual? trumpet, and Shrestha Sharma, the dedicated housewife who has come for the auditions only because of her husband?s persistence. 

 So be a part of Adnan?s search for India?s next golden voice on Samsung [V] Super Singer, Monday, at 11 pm.

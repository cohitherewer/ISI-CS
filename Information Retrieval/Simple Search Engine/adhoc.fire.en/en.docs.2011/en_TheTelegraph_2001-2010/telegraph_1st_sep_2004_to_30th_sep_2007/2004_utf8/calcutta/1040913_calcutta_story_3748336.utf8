 Kyunki... Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi: Still on fire

Here?s a look at the most watched telly soaps and serials by Calcuttans, between August 22 and August 28 according to the Television Audience Measurement (TAM) system.

 Kumkum which is also a Star Plus serial from Ektaa Kapoor?s K-factory garnered a score of 9.04, making it second for the week.

 Tithir Atithi the ETV Bangla serial that has almost every familiar face of the Bengali small screen managed to score 9 on the TRP ratings and was the top Bengali serial for the week.

 Bhabhi on Star Plus, which is a must-watch for the housewives, notched up a healthy score of 8.44 making it fourth on the list.

 Aastha on ETV Bangla scaled 7.61 making it the second most watched Bengali serial for the week.

 No surprises with the top spot going to Kyunki Saas? But STAR Plus? immense hold over the avid soap-watcher is reinstated through Kumkum and Bhabhi.

 Kyunki? needs to introduction, but Kumkum, revolving around the ups and downs of the Wadhwa family, as seen through the eyes of the bahu is a big rage too. Bhabhi, about a young bride whose life goes wrong after marriage, has a dedicated audience too.

 ETV Bangla is the sole representative of the Bengali channels with two soaps from its stable. While Tithir Atithi revolves around characters who stay and work in a guest house of the same name, Aastha is about the life and times of different families living in one building complex.

 April reprieve for birds

 Santragachhi jheel, a haven for migratory birds, is set for a revamp. Come April, the authorities will start evicting illegal settlers on the banks to rid the waterbody of pollution.

 The decision was taken at last week?s high-level meeting between officials of South Eastern Railway (SER), state forest department, Howrah Municipal Corporation and the district administration.

 ?There are a large market and dwelling units along the lake. The settlers and shop-owners dump garbage into the water, forcing the birds to move elsewhere,? said an SER official. ?We have stopped allowing people to fish in the lake after it was declared a sanctuary,? he added.

 ?We have decided to set up a joint action plan for cleaning the lake,? asserted Howrah district magistrate S. Kishore.

 ?If we initiate the eviction drive now, the birds will be disturbed,? he explained. ?And, if the drive is undertaken before any festivity, public sentiment will be hurt. So, April is the ideal time for the operation.?

 Kishore also said the district administration has urged the railways to provide funds for reviving the lake.

 The annual visitors include scores of pintail ducks, coots, red-crested pochards, Brahmni ducks, cadwalls, garganeys, common teals, common sandpipers, red shanks, whimbrels and Eurasian curlews. 

 Besides, there are various types of snipes, stints, gulls and terns. The feathered flock flies up to 5,000 km from northern Eurasia, eastern Europe, China and the high-altitude terrain in the Himalayas to reach the city?s wetlands every year. 

 Santragachhi jheel, spread over nearly one square kilometre, was a favourite destination of the migratory birds. On an average, 6,000-7,000 birds used to visit the lake.

 The number has been decreasing over the past few years and this year, only around 4,000 birds have come to the lake. 

 The forest department, which now maintains the lake, has planned to write to the railway ministry to hand over the lake to the department. 

 ?If the railway hands over the lake, we can turn it into a conservation reserve,? said V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden of the forest department. ?Encroachment and other laws can also be enforced more stringently then.? 

 Yadav, who felt fishing and encroachment were the main problems, added that his department had written to the state pollution control board for declaring the lake a plastic-free zone. 

 It was also decided at the meeting that the sewage lines flowing into the lake would be diverted. 

 The Howrah civic body has promised to set up garbage vats so that people do not throw waste into the water body.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bonanza for books, films and music

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chokher Bali to Chaurasia, Mondo Meyer Upakhyan to Mahabharata, Ray to Ritwik... Activity at the billing tills wasn?t just about apparel and footwear during the ?great shopping window? leading up to the Pujas this year.

 A spurt in sales of DVD/VCDs, books and music, powered by big-ticket NRI and foreign buyers, added to the momentum with a meaty share. And the data, post-decoding of the sensormatic price tags, bears out the buoyancy. 

 MusicWorld, where the average billing size is Rs 450-500, saw a single-ticket till transaction of Rs 25,000 on a Puja day, while purchases of Rs 15,000 was ?par for the course?, according to regional manager Lalita Sinha.

 Rituparno Ghosh was the clear and present winner in the DVD segment (preferred by the NRI shopper) with his Chokher Bali, Shuvo Muhurrat and Utsab hugging the top three sales slots at the Park Street music/ movies store and doing equally well at Emami Landmark and Crossword. Ray and Ghatak classics like Charulata and Jukti, Takko? were also rack rages. While films fared fabulously, Indian classical music also played loud and true, Zakir Hussain With Greats being a resounding hit.

 With price tags 30-50 per cent friendlier than in the West, books have been a major driver, too. ?From Monica Ali to Jhumpa Lahiri, Ashapurna Devi to Suchitra Bhattacharya (of Moina Tadanta fame), the title trek was motley, with ticket sizes often touching Rs 5,000-6,000,? said Rajiv Chowdhury of Oxford Bookstore. The average billing at the Park Street outlet hovers around Rs 450.

 If Vikram Seth and Sir Vidya Naipaul found favour with the NRIs and foreigners at Oxford, Crossword reported a ?healthy interest? in Bengali literature, from Tagore to Feluda. ?Books on local culture and rituals, especially the Pujas, have done exceedingly well,? observed Sidharth Pansari at the Elgin Road outlet.

 Landmark, too, has seen ticket sizes range from Rs 5,000 to 10,000 during the festive period. ?From a DVD Ramayana to Amar Chitra Katha comics, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi to Bhoomi, everything with a local flavour has been lapped up,? said CEO Gautam Jatia.

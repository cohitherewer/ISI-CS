during the recording of The Antwone Fisher Story, with film-maker Mira 

Nair and with director Ang Lee 

 From Istvan Szabo (Being Julia) and Ang Lee (Chosen, The Ice Storm) to Mira Nair (Kama Sutra, Monsoon Wedding, Vanity Fair) and Joel Schumacher (8mm) to Denzel Washington (The Antwone Fisher Story) and James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted), music director Mychael Danna has worked with some of the best directors in the world. In this exclusive chat over email, Danna tells Pratim D. Gupta about his driving forces, his inspirations and his working style.

 Seventeen years into music, do you still 

feel as motivated for a new film score as you did when you wrote the music for 

Family Viewing? What has kept you ticking and your music flowing?

Every project I do, I try to start from a totally 

blank slate ? to reinvent the wheel each time. I watch a new film with an open 

mind and try to find the perfect and most elegant solution to the question: What 

kind of music will best serve this film? And if the answer is Persian ney and 

mid-European medieval ensemble, so be it. I don?t assume anything, but through 

discussions with the director try to understand why they made this film and what 

they are trying to say. This does cause me a lot of extra work, as opposed to 

scoring everything with a standard Hollywood orchestra. But that?s what keeps 

me excited ? pushing into areas that I haven?t already mapped out, learning new 

kinds of music, working with some of the best musicians from different places 

and cultures.

 You are highly regarded around the world 

for producing music that sounds strictly non-Western and has these strains of 

diverse forms. What have been your major influences? What have you grown up listening 

to?

 I grew up in a suburb of Toronto listening to Western classical and pop music. It was when I moved into Toronto to study music that I was exposed to many other forms. Toronto at that time was experiencing an explosion of immigration from all over the world, and all these cultures were thriving artistically, in a very positive way. So there was a lot of interaction between all these different mini-communities. That was a very formative time for me ? hearing all the different kinds of music, especially within the settings of their own traditions, communities, religious and cultural events.

 You have written music both for films and 

for stage musicals. What is the essential difference in sound, pitch, execution 

and overall impact?

 Films can be much more subtle and I think I?m much more suited for the work I like to do. Live music is exciting to be a part of ? there can be some magic moments, but there is something frustrating about the ephemeral quality of theatre for me. I suppose everything is ephemeral really, but I like the illusion of some sort of a longer term record of the work.

 As a music director you have worked with 

the best in the movie business ? from Joel Schumacher to Ang Lee. How do you adapt 

to the musical preferences of different directors and how different are they in 

their choice of music?

 It is the composer?s job to come to a profound understanding of the director?s film, his motivation, his themes, his sensibilities. Yes, directors are all different, and the same director is even different from film to film! Writing music is only half of the job of a film score. The composer?s relationship with, communication with and understanding of the director is really at the core of the art.

 In the past you have worked for period 

pieces like Kama Sutra. What kind of homework or research do you usually 

do to get the sound right?

 I do a lot of homework for every film. Not just historic films, because often I choose to use historic music in order to portray a specific theme within a film that may not on the surface have anything to do with the time or place of the music I?m scoring the scene with. In The Sweet Hereafter, the story takes place in the present era in a small town in Canada but the insular nature of the town reminded me of the fact that the village mentality was very timeless ? it really had a great deal in common with a village in medieval Europe. Also, the fable of the Pied Piper of Hamlin was woven into the film, and was in a sense an analogy of the present day story. So in a sense, that was the film I was scoring, the medieval fable, (with Persian ney and medieval band), even though we are looking at a modern story of a school bus disaster.

 You have got a lot of Indian music assignments. 

Have you listened to any Indian musician? Are you influenced or inspired by any 

Asian artiste, contemporary or otherwise?

 Yes, I love Indian music, pop and classical, and I am married to an Indian woman so I am exposed to the latest films all the time! I?ve recorded in Mumbai and also Delhi several times. I?ve worked with Mira Nair on several films. My most recent film is an Indian one too, Water, which I am doing with Deepa Mehta.

 Tell us something about Water. Have 

you used A. R. Rahman?s songs as reference for your background score? What kind 

of instruments have you used in this period Hindu film?

 The film itself is a lovely piece, a very moving story in the languid and naturalistic style of the early Satyajit Ray films. So I strongly feel that the music for the film needs to be all acoustic, in keeping with the period character of the film, as well as being simple and naturalistic in nature. I just recorded in Mumbai and Delhi with instrumentalists including Anoushka Shankar, Selva Ganesh, Rakesh Chaurasia, Ulhas Bapat, Bhawani Shankar. In fact, I heard the early mixes for Mr Rahman?s songs and I thought the electronic elements were inappropriate for this movie. I hope the final version will have an instrumental make-up more in keeping with the spirit of the film. The songs themselves are his (Rahman?s) usual wonderful work.

 You were slated to do Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s 

Black. What went wrong?

 Sadly it was a case of a scheduling conflict. It is really very disappointing, as he is such an outstanding director with a brilliant visual sense. Hopefully, next time...

 Are you open to more Indian film offers? 

Are you comfortable scoring music for mushy Bollywood melodramas?

 I take great (if guilty) pleasure in enjoying mushy melodramas.

 Which is the next film assignment you are 

working on?

 Where The Truth Lies with Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth as a comedy singing team from the 60s and 70s.

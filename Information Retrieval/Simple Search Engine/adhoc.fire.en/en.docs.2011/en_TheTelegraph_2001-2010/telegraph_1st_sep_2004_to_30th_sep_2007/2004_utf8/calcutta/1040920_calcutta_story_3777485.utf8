The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Batons battle beacon bane 

 Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of Calcutta Police (traffic wing), met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Md. Amiruzzaman, Diptimoy Ghosh, Ajay Pal, Jaidip Moitra, S.H. Khan, Soham Chakrabarty and Srinjoy Basu

Ajay Pal: I have served as officer-in-charge of several police stations under Calcutta Police for several years. Recently, I noticed that some officers are sporting red beacons on their cars, something they are not supposed to. This is dangerous for security reasons, as the attack on Parliament had earlier proved.

 Yes, there has been a spurt in this trend and many officers are using beacon on their cars, which they are not authorised to do. Most government officials believe it is their right by rank to use the light. We gather that their children, too, use cars that flash red lights. 

 The problem is acute in the suburban areas, where even an officer-in-charge of a police station uses a red light. We have spotted government officers in the rank of block development officers using the light. Though all such vehicles are not always booked on sight, in extreme cases, where relatives of the officer are found shopping, or their children are in the car, we note down the number and inform the vehicle-user about it. 

 It has occurred several times that the officer concerned apologises to us. If the vehicle-user does not respond, we slap a monetary fine on him, which he has to pay. We have repeatedly requested officers who come to the city with their car beacons flashing, to cover it up. But it seems even government officers are least bothered about obeying the rules, forcing us to take harsh steps.

Diptimoy Ghosh: Often, we hear that an officer or a constable who takes strong steps against offenders, is rewarded with a transfer from the area. 

 No, this is not true. But the problem of mounting pressure on the dutiful officer remains when he is trying to impose the law without considering the status of the offender.

 For example, if a sergeant imposes a fine on some influential persons for violating traffic rules, they try to pull strings and often pressure us to punish the officer for doing his duty.

 Fortunately, our senior officers are wise enough to tackle the situation and create an atmosphere conducive for the officer on the ground. We always try to maintain a supportive base for the officer who discharges his responsibility without distinguishing the status of the offender.

Diptimoy Ghosh: Traffic officers are blamed for taking bribes from the people.

 This is a common allegation against any traffic constable or sergeant. But if such things happen, why do the people who are wrongly penalised fail to bring this to my notice, or that of the deputy commissioner or other senior officers. 

 On the contrary, we find that in most cases, the offender is at fault and pleads with the traffic officer to let him off. However, when the offenders are not spared, they spread the canard that they were punished because they had failed to grease the palm of the officer concerned and not because they committed an offence. 

 This type of allegation is mostly made by the unionised vehicle-drivers, who feel this is a good way to put pressure on the officer concerned and to corner him by using their union nexus. 

 There are, however, stray incidents where our officials, too, are caught on the wrong side. In that case, I would urge the public to take up the matter with us and get the officer punished.

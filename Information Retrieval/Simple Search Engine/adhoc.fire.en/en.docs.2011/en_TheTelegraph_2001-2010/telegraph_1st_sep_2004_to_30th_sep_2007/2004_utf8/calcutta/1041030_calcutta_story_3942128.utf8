 Star theatre turned into a battlefield on Thursday night and the following morning as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) launched a drive to demolish shops in front of the revived hall. 

 At least nine of the 12 shops in front of the hall were demolished on Thursday night in a move that officers at Lalbazar dubbed ?illegal?. Shopowners took to the streets on Friday in protest and blocked Bidhan Sarani. Five men were arrested. 

 According to eyewitnesses, about 200 CMC men wearing helmets, and armed with payloaders and gas cutters, reached the spot after midnight and started demolishing the shops. When the officer-in-charge of Burtolla police station reached the spot with his men, no CMC personnel could be found, though 400 local people were out on the street. Till late into the night, OC Ashish Somchowdhury tried to pacify the crowd.

 An officer at Lalbazar said: ?Senior civic officials spoke to the police brass last night and sought support for the drive.

 ?The proposal, however, was turned down after it was found that there was no court order to demolish the shops.?

 Police later found out that the CMC had started demolishing the shops without informing them or obtaining any valid permission. 

 Shopowners alleged that CMC personnel walked off with expensive electronic goods and cash. Three complaints were lodged against the CMC, alleging theft and dacoity. However, no case has been started. 

 Avijit Dhar, secretary of the Federation of Traders? Organisation of West Bengal?s North West District Committee, said: ?The CMC ransacked nine shops, though the court order says status quo should be maintained.? Bimala Devi, whose paan shop was demolished, said: ?I wonder how the CMC committed such a brutal act? This shop is part of the heritage.?

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee justified the move, saying: ?There is a Supreme Court verdict which says that tenancy lapses if a building is gutted. Though Star was revived after it was gutted, all the 12 shopowners were offered alternative space on new premises close by. Each shopowner has been offered a trade licence for the new premises.?

 He added that in February 2002, the shopowners had filed a writ petition, which was dismissed by Calcutta High Court. However, in the last week of August, the shopowners received an injunction order. The next hearing was fixed for December 7. 

 Mayor Mukherjee said no order was served on the CMC to maintain the status quo.

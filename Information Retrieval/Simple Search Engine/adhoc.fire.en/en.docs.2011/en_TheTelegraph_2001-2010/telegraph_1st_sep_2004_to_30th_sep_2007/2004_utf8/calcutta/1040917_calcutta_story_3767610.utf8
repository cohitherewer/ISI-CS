The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rail reservation wires snapped

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A bunch of wires, linking railway reservation terminals to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), was found snapped at Telephone Bhavan, Calcutta Telephones? head office, on Thursday afternoon. 

 Railway reservations in several states were severely affected. 

 ?Around 400 jumper wires linked to railway data circuits were found randomly cut in the main distribution frame on the first floor of Telephone Bhavan,? a Calcutta Telephones (CalTel) source said. ?It seems an act of sabotage,? he added. 

 CalTel officials, however, said the interruption was ?nothing major?. 

 ?There was an interruption in a small-sized cable hooked to railway circuits. So, the reservation network got affected,? explained S.K. Bhaduri, CalTel general manager (customer relations) on Thursday night. 

 ?The lines were restored by late evening,? he added. 

 ?We are suspecting sabotage and we have demanded a probe,? said Sisir Ray, secretary, BSNL Employees? Union, Calcutta circuit. 

 General manager Bhaduri, on his part, thinks it is too early to comment. 

 The damage was detected in the afternoon and restoration work started immediately. Senior telephone officials, including a few from the vigilance wing, inspected the spot. 

 Of the 316 railway reservation centres in Bengal and neighbouring states, around 80 were affected. Of them, 45 were worst-hit, said a railway spokesperson. 

 In the city, the reservation centres at Fort William and Dhakuria remained inoperative throughout the day. 

 New Koilaghat was affected for 15 minutes, from 1.45 pm. ?There was a major system breakdown in Puri,? the railway spokesperson said.

 Among the centres that operated normally were the ones at Old Koilaghat, Fairlie Place, Rabindra Sadan and Howrah and Sealdah stations, officials said.

 Sources said some banks and business houses in and around BBD Bag, too, were affected.

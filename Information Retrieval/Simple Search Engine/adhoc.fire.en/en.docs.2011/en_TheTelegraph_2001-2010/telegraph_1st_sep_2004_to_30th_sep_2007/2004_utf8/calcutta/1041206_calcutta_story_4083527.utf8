The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without...

 Making a trip to Goa 

It?s carnival time once more in Goa. It may be too early for the winter raves 

but the International Film Festival is painting a starry picture on its soft sands. 

And those who can?t get a peek into the screenings can easily catch up on giant 

screens dotting the seascape. So, indulge in some serious movie mania in nature?s 

best multiplex.

Catching Bridget Jones? new avatar 

She is blissful and besotted in the arms of gorgeous lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin 

Firth) but only briefly. Anguish is never far for Bridget (Renee Zellweger), who 

is wading through troubled waters again in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. 

Now, she?s got a rival ? Darcy?s drop-dead gorgeous intern ? to deal with as well 

as her former boss, the womanising Daniel Cleaver. It?s laughs all the way with 

this lazy afternoon chick flick.

Getting a new do

Head for your stylist?s trustworthy scissors just in time for the snips to settle 

down for the endless winter parties. Experiment with curls or a rebonding, apart 

from the usual streaks, to really turn those revelling heads.

 Colouring your kitchen

Red polo necks and saucy scarves are not the only way to perk up your winter palette. 

Take the mood into the kitchen, courtesy the freshest of the season?s produce 

? oranges, apples, grapes, beans, carrots, beetroots... Make sure your fruit and 

veggie basket is stocked to give your wardrobe some solid competition.

Preparing for the mosquito mayhem

They will soon be out in full force, smart enough to skirt the mat, coil and canopy. 

Be on the alert, start snapping at anything that moves, battered dictionary (or 

other weighty weapon of war) firmly in hand.

 Happily married? Have a supportive hubby and in-laws? Then your next destination could well be the prelims of Mrs India World 2005. 

 The dozen-odd contestants who turned up for the eastern zonal prelims of the only beauty pageant in the country for married women, ended up extolling the same tried and tested virtues of marriage. From ?I?m happily married to my sailor husband for the last five years?, to ?I was a model till I got married and am now happily settled with my advocate husband?, the contestants ? nervous and confident ? left little room for innovation in the introductory lines as the contest organised by Sahara One got underway at Hyatt Regency on Thursday morning. 

 Cold Calcutta

 ?We have had 130 participants from Mumbai, Delhi was quite good too, but Calcutta seems a little laidback,? said a production team member. Indeed, even well past the 11 am reporting time, contestants were few and far between. Judge and ex-Mrs World Aditi Govitrikar couldn?t help but point out, ?Bengali beauty is famous across the world, I wish women here were more keen to join the contest. a Bengali woman dressed in a sari with a big bindi to match is sure to be a hit.? 

 Contest contours

The judging process was simple and swift. All a participant 

had to do was to get portfolio pictures of herself and fill out a form with personal 

details. They were then grilled by the panel comprising Aditi and Dona Ganguly. 

Post-personality assessment, it was catwalk on the cards, true pageant style. 

 The zonal finalists will vie for the ultimate title at the final contest to be held in December. The winner will get a chance to represent India on the world stage. 

Profile push

Low-cut jeans-clad, streaked-haired damsels to the 

typical Bengali housewife look complete with waist-length jet black hair with 

sindoor firmly in place ? the profile touched both ends of the spectrum.

 Accompaniments were as varied as the main course. From harried husbands forced to bunk a day at work, to worried fathers hovering around protectively, the scene was as surprising as it was amusing. 

 Other tag-alongs included a file of press coverage here and an ex-Miss something title there. 

 For most, however, it was a chance to realise a long-cherished dream. ?A platform like this boosts self confidence and gives women a chance to prove themselves,? felt Dona, who insisted on knowing about the ?professional profile? of the contestants more than anything else. 

Result roster

Is still awaited but whoever wins will have to be 

prepared to work extra hard before she can go on for the national contest. ?There 

are some deserving candidates here, but many of them would need to work harder 

at losing some weight,? said one of the organisers. 

 Weight watching, make-up tips, etiquette classes, public speaking sessions and extra-curricular activities will be part of the daily routine of the finalists during their 15-day grooming session before the big day on December 26. 

 Sizzling hot

 The winter chill is finally setting in during the evenings, making it a perfect time to party, eat out and have some real fun. And what better way to whet your appetite than to dig into some steamy sizzlers and wash it all down with a pint of beer. The Sizzler Festival on at Palm Court, the newly-renovated coffee shop at HHI gives the foodie a chance to do just that. 

 The fest features a wide range of off-beat non-vegetarian sizzlers. From salmon to beef and jumbo prawns, executive chef Utpal Mondal has ensured that the menu has more than the usual chicken and lamb dishes. Lobsters and Pomfret are also included on the menu as are broccoli, corn and cheese from the vegetarian stable. 

 The veggie brigade can also dig into exotic Mexican vegetables in the Continental section or the Cottage Cheese Steak, besides three options in the Indian section.

 ?Each of these sizzlers come with an exotic sauce, which adds to the fun,? smiled the chef. Thus you can complement the salmon with white cilantro butter sauce or a tarragon sauce. The mixed grill with lamb chop and pork sausages are served with a yummy red wine sauce. This apart, broccoli florets, baby carrots and jacket potatoes are standard with each sizzler serving, both veg and non-veg. 

 Priced between Rs 275 to Rs 595, the sizzlers are served with a complimentary pint of Jaguar beer. 

 The festival will be on till November 28.

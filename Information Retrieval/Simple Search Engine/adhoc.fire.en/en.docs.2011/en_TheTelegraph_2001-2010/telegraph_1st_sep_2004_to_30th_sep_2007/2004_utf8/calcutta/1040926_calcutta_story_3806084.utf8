The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at...

 Panchalingeshwar

 God, five times over, and 200 

 tiring steps to reach Him, touch Him and make a wish. I 

 wished for a lesser number of steps so I could climb down 

 fast. I asked the owner of a tea-stall in the vicinity how 

 many steps there were to get back to terra firma. 200, he 

 told me.

 I reached the forest floor in 

 10 minutes, by which time I had finished counting from one 

 to 200. My wish, breath and the Rs 10 pranami, had 

 gone waste. The priest at the temple, however, had insisted 

 that my ?wish would be answered?. I guess Lord Shiva ? actually 

 all five of Him ? was in a bad mood. After all, no one would 

 enjoy staying submerged in freezing water all year round.

 But that is exactly how it is 

 at Panchalingeshwar, a place in Orissa that derives its 

 name from the five Shiva lingas embedded in a fissure 

 on a rock through which runs an exuberant stream. Four medium-sized 

 rocks mark the spot where the otherwise invisible lingas 

 stand immersed beneath the running waters. It is said that 

 those who can feel them by groping around in the cold water 

 will ?definitely? have their wishes fulfiled.

 Some four hours by train to Balasore 

 and one-and-a-half hours by bus or jeep from there, Panchalingeshwar 

 is a place exalted in legend and shrouded by dense jungles 

 where a whole new world opens up with each step.

 SURVIVAL 

 KIT

 Mosquito repellent 

 Torch 

 Zeoline

 Camera 

 Sturdy shoes

 Jarasanth, the ruler of Magadh 

 who finds mention in the Mahabharata, is said to have worshipped 

 the five lingas here. He was, however, longitudinally 

 ripped in two halves by Bhima, and chances are that he, 

 too, must have wished otherwise.

 Wishes apart, Panchalingeshwar, 

 with its cave temple perched on top of a forested hillock 

 and deep, silent woods, makes for an ideal weekend getaway, 

 especially at this time of year, when the forest is green 

 and full of life. The hillock atop which the temple is situated 

 ? around 20 leisurely minutes on foot from the Panthashala 

 ? offers a spectacular view of the rolling Nilgiri hills 

 that seem to stretch all the way to the horizon.

 The symphony of birdcalls, complimented 

 by whistling winds and gurgling brooks, provide constant 

 company throughout the day. Crickets, owls and elephants 

 take over the night shift. A fortunate few, and those with 

 insomnia or a penchant for wildlife, can even catch a glimpse 

 of the pachyderms on patrol on a full moon night, right 

 outside the window.

 How to get there

 Take the overnight Falaknama Express 

 to Balasore. Buses (not too many of them) and jeeps take 

 you to Panchalingeshwar.

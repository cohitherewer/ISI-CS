The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Two weeks to fill Calcutta craters

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has two weeks to initiate road-repair measures in cratered Calcutta.

 The deadline ? borne out of disgust at the condition of city streets ? was set on Monday by a high court division bench, comprising Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Asit Kumar Bishi.

 The government, its public works department (PWD), the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) have been asked to revert to the bench on the steps taken to repair the potholed roads, within a fortnight.

 Responding to a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding the repair of city roads before the festival season, Justice Kabir and Justice Bishi also asked the departments concerned to file affidavits stating details about the maintenance of the thoroughfares.

 ?The state government, the PWD, chairman of CMDA and commissioner of the CMC are directed to submit individual reports stating which agency is responsible for maintenance of roads within the city of Calcutta and for overseeing the safety of the citizens with regard to open drains and uncovered manholes,? the judges ordered.

 ?The said authorities are directed further to inform the court as to whether any measures have been adopted or are to be adopted to ensure that the roads are properly maintained and that the drainage and sewerage system does not endanger lives,? the bench added.

 Appearing for the state, junior standing counsel Subrata Mukhopadhyay opposed the prayer and challenged the maintainability of the case as ?the petitioner, Idris Ali, has not mentioned the names of the roads in poor condition?.

 The lawyer also argued that the petition was incomplete, as Ali had demanded improvement of roads across the state but had not made the municipalities parties to the case.

 The bench, while acknowledging the logic of the government lawyer?s argument, decided to take up the PIL for hearing. ?You must also be facing difficulty while using the roads. The issue should be treated as a serious matter,? Justice Kabir observed.

 Also linking the Pujas to potholes were organisers of various Durga puja committees in south Calcutta who, on Monday, submitted a joint petition to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and mayor Subrata Mukherjee urging ?immediate repair of roads? that threatened to mar the festive spirit.

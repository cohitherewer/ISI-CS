The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Post-lynch protest string

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after 14-year-old Mohammad Anish was beaten to death on the suspicion that he had stolen a bicycle, residents of Mayurbhanj Road and Bhukailash Road held a string of demonstrations in front of Ekbalpore police station on Tuesday. They gheraoed the police station for an hour and 30 minutes to protest ?police inaction? in arresting the alleged assailants named in the FIR.

 Police have come to know in the course of preliminary investigation that Anish was not involved in the theft. ?The owner of the bicycle, a local maulvi, is absconding. The cycle will be traced soon,? said an officer of Ekbalpore thana.

 As news of the theft spread in the neighbourhood, members of Evergreen Club held a discussion among themselves and concluded without a shred of evidence that Anish was the culprit. 

 They gathered in front of his home on Bhukailash Road at 1.30 pm and called him out. 

 As soon as Anish stepped out, he was taken to a spot near the club, where he had to face a volley of questions relating to the theft. Anish could not answer any of them. The gang then started beating him up.

 The police have sealed the club and talks are on with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on whether or not the structure should be demolished.

 ?According to our investigation, the club building is an unauthorised construction. We have told the CMC officials about it and it?s now their turn to decide on the course of action,? said an officer. 

 Police, however, claimed on Monday that a massive hunt had been launched to track down the two alleged killers. ?We are combing the neighbourhoods. Adjoining police stations have been alerted,? said Sanjay Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Ekbalpore residents, while protesting in front of the police station, shouted slogans against policemen, accusing them of not taking any initiative to arrest the culprits. 

 ?If they try sincerely, the accused will soon be netted. The cops know everything, including the whereabouts of the two club members named in the FIR,? said Tariq Aziz, a local resident. 

 ?If the duo can?t be arrested within a day or two, we will launch a series of agitations,? the protesters threatened.

 Mime mirror on milieu maladies

 - Dedicated band of youngsters practise, learn and act to cleanse society

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 ?Aamra naatok korchi (We are acting in a play),? said four-year-old Siddhartha Jana gleefully, taking a break from rehearsing for a mime show. For him and friend Milan Kanti Mondal, the word ?mime? holds little meaning. But neither that nor abject poverty at home can deter them from travelling from remote villages of South 24-Parganas to Garia for regular rehearsals.

 They, along with 30 other youngsters, between four and 23, are part of a Modern Mime Centre project on Role of Mime on Sociology, the first show of which was held recently at Children?s Little Theatre. 

 The project, funded by the Union department of culture, for the period 2004-2005, intends to train children from suburban and rural areas in the fine art of mime-acting, so they can take their performances in groups to their own villages to disseminate information about various social ills, such as superstition, illiteracy and caste bias.

 ?As part of the project, I had been to over 200 schools in Gosaba, Baruipur, Canning, Joynagar and the Sunderbans and performed there. Later, interested students enrolled themselves at Modern Mime Centre or students, thought to have some potential in the art, were sent to me by their schoolteachers,? explained Kamal Naskar, director of the centre. 

 Though the project started about a year ago, this October?s performance was the first for the children as a group. Khokan and Mayukh Naskar are teenagers from Kamarabad, near Sonarpur. ?We have performed in a couple of mime shows as part of the Bigyan Manch from school, but this is different,? said Khokan. ?This show will have a particular message, to be portrayed in the language of an art which requires no language, but is so unknown in villages like ours.? 

 Director Naskar added: ?The dedication of this group is tremendous.?

 True, when the mid-October deluge swept the state, Khokan and Mayukh would camp at Bagha Jatin, lest the rain played spoilsport to their rehearsals and the final performance. Little Subrata Das had travelled despite the rain from a Mathurapur village, near Kakdwip, for the final rehearsal. 

 Unlike little Siddhartha, this youngster had some clues about what he was there for. ?We will fight all the bad things in society, like jaat-paat, through our performance,? he said. Ask him what jaat-paat is, he smiles and draws a blank. 

 Naskar explained: ?These kids, like six-year-old Anamika or Somnath, are too young to understand what they are doing. For them, right now, the entire exercise is fun and exciting. Maybe later, they will take it further.? 

 But for older participants like Chandana Das, 23, who used to live in a Sunderbans village, such performances mean a lot. ?Such thoughtful topics, like the one in which we portray a priest avoiding the so-called untouchables like the plague, only to be saved by them in his hour of need, are very relevant in our society back home,? said Chandana.

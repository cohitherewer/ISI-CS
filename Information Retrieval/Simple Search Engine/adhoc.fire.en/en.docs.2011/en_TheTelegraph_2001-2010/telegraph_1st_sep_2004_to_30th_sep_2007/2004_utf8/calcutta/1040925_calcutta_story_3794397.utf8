 An outcry against violence

 It has now come to be acknowledged that human life is ensconced in a web of violence. Be it with the excuse of religion, revenge or simply as an act of irresponsible revelry, we thoughtlessly indulge in violent activities. Society, too, seems to have become more tolerant of violence in our day-to-day lives and we have learnt to accept it as a part of normal, everyday occurrence. Yet our hearts did fill with horror when we read or heard about the killing and bloodshed that took place during several incidents of riots in our country not too long ago. We felt helpless and outraged, we demanded explanations, we wanted to know the truth and to raise our voice in protest. Padatik?s Hidden Fires, a dramatised collage of five monologues by Manjula Padmanabhan, voices our silent emotions and tries to mirror our society in the context of violence. Famous Last Words by Vishal Sethia, Points by Surendra Kapoor, Hidden Fires by Anubha Fathepuria, Know The Truth by Chitra Nayak and Invocations by Dilip Dave, help us come to terms with our surroundings and offer hope of a future that is free from violence. Directed by Jayant Kriplani.

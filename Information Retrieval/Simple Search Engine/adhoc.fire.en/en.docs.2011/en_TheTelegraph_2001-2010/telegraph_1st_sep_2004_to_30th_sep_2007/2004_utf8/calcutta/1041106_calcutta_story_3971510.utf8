 City centre sleaze bust

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a joint raid with the detective department, Shakespeare Sarani police officials busted a sleaze racket on Friday night at two apartments in the Camac Street-Chowringhee belt. Fourteen girls in their mid-20s and nine men between 28 and 45 years were arrested.

 ?We first raided an apartment in Shantiniketan building on Camac Street. On interrogating the girls, we came to know of another place on Chowringhee,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner, south division. The sleuths then stormed a ninth-floor apartment in a building close to Birla Planetarium and rounded up another group. ?All those arrested have been booked under the immoral trafficking Act,? he added.

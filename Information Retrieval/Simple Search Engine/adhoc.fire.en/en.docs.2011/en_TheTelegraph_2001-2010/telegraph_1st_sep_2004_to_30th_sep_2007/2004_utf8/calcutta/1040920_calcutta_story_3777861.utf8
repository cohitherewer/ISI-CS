 Post-Puja building rule bonanza

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

FLOOR 

AREA RATIO: Land area divided by plinth area

CARPET AREA: Wall-to-wall area inside a flat

BUILT-UP AREA: Internal and external walls 

of a flat and 50 per cent of a partition wall of a neighbouring flat

PLINTH AREA: 

Carpet area + built up area + proportionately shared areas of common corridor, 

staircase, ceiling area of the staircase at the topmost floor, lift space, covered 

space in front of the lift and staircase on the ground floor 

The civic authorities said on Sunday that a new set of building rules will come into effect post-Durga puja, offering a bonanza for builders of houses, especially highrises, by way of extra built-up areas. 

 ?The new rules will please everyone,? hoped mayor Subrata Mukherjee. ?There will be more saleable space, both in terms of actual living and parking of cars. The city will benefit as a whole because the rules will address the problem of shortage of parking space.?

 The rules will create more carpet area ? wall-to-wall inside a flat ?- by excluding the parking lot and the staircase from the calculation of covered area (plinth area) while determining the floor area ratio (FAR) for sanctioning a building construction plan. 

 Under the new rules, the FAR will be allowed in proportion to the width of the roads abutting the plots.

 Now, the total covered area allowed on a particular plot is limited by the FAR in accordance with the width of the road, and the parking lot and the staircase are included while calculating the covered area. 

 As a result, a plot-owner has to forego a portion of the carpet area to get a parking space or a wider staircase.

 Moreover, the civic authorities will encourage construction of more basement parking lots by offering to keep the basement outside the calculation of the plinth area and by allowing the builder the benefit of an extra floor equal to the area of the basement.

 Under the present building rules, there are slabs of road width for the value of FAR. For example, a plot-owner on a four-metre-wide road does not get more covered area than a plot-owner with a three-metre-wide road in front of his premises, since the FAR is all the same for the slab 3-5 metre.

 The forthcoming rules will make the FAR proportionate to the width of the road and hence, a plot located on a four-metre-wide road will get proportionately more covered area than a plot abutting a three-metre-wide road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Girl with global sounds

 IPSITA DEB

 She was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1971. She is now busy casting a musical spell over Park Street, Calcutta. Having taken to DJ-ing in 1998, when she moved to Berlin, petite Vela (picture by Rashbehari Das) has a lot to say before working the turntables at Tantra.

 On India:

 I enjoy seeing new places (read: Germany, the US, the UK, Japan, Holland, Poland, Russia, Italy, Switzerland, Hungary...), trying out different cuisine and meeting people. Russians are rather loud but friendly, always coming up to me for a chat, the English tend to be rather drunk, while the Germans like having a proper party. My first impression of India came from National Geographic programmes and Bollywood films ? the beautiful costumes and hundreds of song-and-dance routines.

 On Calcutta:

 The Kali temple is the first thing I want to see here... I love cows (my friends often SMS ?moo? instead of ?hello?) and I was so excited when I saw cows on the streets!

 On music:

 I like to imbibe musical elements from each place I visit. My style is fun, party music with long tracks that mix two pieces. Basically, light and popular house music.

 On being a woman DJ:

 It makes no difference being a woman DJ. In Russia, people smiled a lot, but if they tried to overstep, I had my turntables for protection. In Calcutta, I got a note from this guy telling me I was doing a great job.

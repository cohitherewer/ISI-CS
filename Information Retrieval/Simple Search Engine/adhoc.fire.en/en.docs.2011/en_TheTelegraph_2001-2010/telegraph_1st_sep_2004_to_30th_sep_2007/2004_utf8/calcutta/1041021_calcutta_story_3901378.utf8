The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A sweet royal tradition of two centuries

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Haluikars carry the sweets to the 

Sovabazar thakurdalan. 

Sweets offered as part of the bhog 

 Across the winding portals of Sovabazar Rajbari is the courtyard. A right turn takes one before the goddess, in daaker saaj regalia. Even as the hands are clasped in prayer, a smell comes wafting in air, causing the mind to waver from pious thoughts. 

 The smell draws one down the path leading to the opposite wing of the palatial mansion. In a room on the ground floor syrup is boiling in a giant kadai. 

 Welcome to the vien of the mansion that has been home to the Debs of Sovabazar for some two centuries now. Only if you are a Brahmin, though. Or else feel free to inspect from the doorstep the king-size containers cluttering the ground, heaped with sweets of all shapes and sizes. And smells.

 ?There are 27 varieties of sweets that we offer to the Mother every day,? says the sprightly sexagenarian Alok Krishna Deb, fishing out a yellowing list. Peraki, pakkan, mogodh, mutri, samesha, khurma? such alien names follow the more familiar jilipi, balushai, khaja and the like. The recipes are the preserve of haluikars from Panskura, Midnapore. ?They have been on our Puja duty for seven generations,? smiles Deb, pointing to Krishnaprasad Bhuniya, busy draining the syrup from just-fried gajas. 

 Many a restriction binds the mithai-makers. Only Ganga water can be used during cooking. ?A car is there only to travel back and forth from the river,? Deb smiles. Once the sweets are prepared, they are reached in 10 mammoth brass thalas. 

 ?The chouka (square) gajas have to be made in the greatest volume,? states Bhuniya, his paitey (sacred thread) standing testimony to his right of handling the deity?s meal. But it is the mithe gaja that is the favourite. ?It has to be fried in low heat. So the preparation takes up the whole night. But the taste is worth the effort,? Bhuniya says. Deb, the seventh in line from Raja Nabakrishna Deb, remembers how as a child, he had sucked the syrup from a container of ladikeni through the window of the store room with a straw. ?When I confessed, the whole container was cancelled from the bhog and I got a royal thrashing.? His sweet tooth has remained. ?I consume about seven kg of the mithai prasaad alone,? he says.

 But what quantity reaches the goddess is beyond anyone?s estimate. Every morning, the Oriya suppliers come from the Beadon Street market, carrying maunds of kheer and chhana on their shoulders. ?They enjoy the prestige of being called suppliers to the Rajbari.? Ghee, sugar and maida are used in abundance. ?There are 200-250 of us, comprising the families of Nabakrishna?s seven sons. It is tough to keep count of the consumption,? Deb says.

 And with Durga starting her feast with the bhog after pranpratishtha on Sashthi, another year has been added to the 235-year-old tradition. ?Even if we try to make these sweets at home, the taste is never the same. What happens here is the grace of God,? Bhuniya folds his palms in reverence.

Sujoy Guha Roy: What decides the ?rarest of rare? cases while awarding capital punishment?

 There are no terms like ?rarest of rare? cases either in Indian Penal Code (IPC) or in allied penal codes of Criminal Procedure. Basically, our judiciary does not want to award capital punishment unless it becomes absolutely necessary to uphold the legal, social and moral values of life. However, in awarding such verdicts, the judges of the trial court concentrate on the nature, the circumstances under which the crime was committed, whether it was a pre-planned crime or not and it?s impact on society. Of these, the last criterion is given much importance. After judging all these aspects, along with a few other parameters that vary from case to case, capital punishment is awarded to the accused.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fears fuel wheel-jam Wednesday

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 With transport lobbies undecided about operating vehicles on wheel-lock Wednesday, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has instructed both Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) and Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) to shore up services.

 State transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury on Monday met officials of the department to discuss the matter. 

 The minister has called an emergency meeting on Tuesday, too, to discuss ways of ensuring uninterrupted services on Wednesday.

 ?Over 600 state buses will be on road from early morning,? CSTC managing director Sukumar Bhattacharya said. Besides, several state buses will remain on standby in depots across the city. 

 CTC managing director S.N. Pal said over 200 trams will be on the streets to plug the gap left by private buses and taxis.

 The Bengal Bus Syndicate, which plies nearly 7,500 private buses daily, will not take out the fleet. ?We have had bitter experiences during earlier bandhs. So, we have decided to stay in on Wednesday,? said syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha.

 The Joint Council of Bus Syndicates said it was ?risky? to take out vehicles on a bandh day as insurance firms refuse to reimburse the damage. ?We are left with no option but to withdraw services,? said council president Sadhan Das. 

 A Bengal Taxi Association spokesman said taxis were easy targets of bandh fury. ?A few may be on road, but the majority will not ply,? he added.

 Pool cars for schoolchildren will also be off the road, said Himadri Ganguly, president of the West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners? and Operators? Association.

 Madan Mitra, Progressive Taximen?s Association president and Trinamul Congress leader, however said 5,000 taxis will be pressed into service from Wednesday morning. ?We have no problem in plying taxis if the government provides security,? he asserted.

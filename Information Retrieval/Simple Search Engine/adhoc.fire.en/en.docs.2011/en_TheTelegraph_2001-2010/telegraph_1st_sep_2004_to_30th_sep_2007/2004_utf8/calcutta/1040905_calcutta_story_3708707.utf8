The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Power of the printed word

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

Is the campaign run by ESPN-Star Sports to bolster its 

telecast bid a testament to that?

In-house 

advertising is pretty common in the media world. Almost every medium a newspaper 

or a magazine, a TV channel or a radio station indulges in it. What indeed is 

pretty rare is to see a mainline medium use another to advertise itself.

The corporate campaign from ESPN-Star Sports has drawn 

curious glances. A speciality sports channel using two of the most expensive models 

in the business, Sachin and Sourav, for their advertising is perhaps understandable. 

They buying the most premium ad space in mainline dailies front-page solus 

cannot be so easily fathomed.

Unless, of course, you remember that a cricket match 

played by Team India is still the most watched television programme in this country. 

Consequently, the advertising space between overs of a cricket match is the most 

valuable property of a television channel.

You will also have to remember that BCCI is currently 

auctioning the telecast rights for cricket matches to be played in India. ESPN 

is the second-highest bidder behind Zee. But there is a snag. Apparently, one 

of the prime requirements for selection is past experience of telecasting cricket 

matches. This is the argument that ESPN-Star Sports is reportedly clutching on 

to. They claim Zee does not even qualify as a bidder because of the inexperience 

in cricket telecast. If Zee is disqualified, then ESPN as the next highest bidder 

with adequate experience wins the rights.

The question that still begs an answer is why is ESPN 

advertising in the daily press? The decision-makers are known office-bearers of 

the cricket board. Arent there cheaper and more direct ways of communicating 

with them? Sure, such routes are available and both the channels, one can be reasonably 

certain, are pursuing those.

Unfortunately, those direct methods cannot utilise 

current sporting celebrities. ESPN can not get Sachin and Sourav to canvas for 

them among the committee members. It will be seen as unethical. They can, however, 

do the next best thing: pay the stars to do a testimonial ad about the cricketing 

experience of the channel, ESPNs strongest argument for getting the contract. 

Such testimonials would obviously then need the widest 

exposure possible. So the daily press was used extensively. Maybe there was another 

factor in play. Television despite its reach is seen primarily as an entertainment 

medium. For making a serious point it is often argued that you need the credibility 

of the daily press. For ESPN, credibility is the key ingredient. They had to use 

the daily press.

What a compliment from a TV channel to its competitors 

from the print media!

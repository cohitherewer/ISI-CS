 Batons fly in sleaze bust wake

 The sleaze scam that broke in Salt Lake on Independence Day drew baton and blood on Friday, with trouble erupting at Barasat court over the production of undertrial Avtar Singh, former athlete and husband of CPM parliamentarian Jyotirmoyee Sikdar.

 CPM and Trinamul Congress supporters clashed when Singhs counsel moved a petition for bail. Singh could not be produced in the court as around 500 Trinamul supporters threatened to storm the courtroom.

 Police resorted to a lathicharge to separate the warring groups. Several protesters including Trinamul MLA Jyotipriya Mallick, injured in the melee were arrested.

 Trinamul supporters started heckling police officers when they were prevented from entering the court. The situation compelled police to resort to a lathicharge, sub-divisional police officer of Barasat Subhankar Chatterjee later said.

 A few policemen, including officer-in-charge of Barasat police station Chandra Sekhar Das were injured in the scuffle. The magistrate adjourned bail proceedings till September 9.

 Another dramatic twist in the tale came later in the day when the high court, responding to a public interest litigation (PIL), intervened in the prosecution of Singh and directed police to produce all relevant records relating to the case by September 8.

 The high courts order followed the PIL by Shahjahan Ali Sheikh, who felt political pressure would make it difficult for police to probe the allegations against the husband of a peoples representative. 

 Sheikh sought a directive from the court for inquiry by the Criminal Investigation Department. 

 Already, a section of the ruling party leadership is trying to shield Singh and his associates, alleged Sheikh in his petition, pushed by counsel Idris Ali.

 The division bench of Justice A. Kabir and Justice A.K. Bishi asked the government pleader whether police had already started a case against Singh, before demanding that all case records be submitted before it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mayor muscle for cafe in park

 BARUN GHOSH 

 Denied a gate, the mayor is determined to foist a toilet-cum-eatery on a park. 

 After raising the hackles of the green lobby a few months ago, when he launched a drive either to prune or uproot several hundred trees across the city to widen roads, Subrata Mukherjee is putting up a toilet-cum-cafeteria in Deshapriya Park amid protests from environment activists. 

 Construction work is now on in a corner of the south Calcutta park, ignoring complaints from morning walkers and environment activists. 

 After demolishing an old toilet, the Trinamul-dominated Calcutta Municipal Corporation has started construction afresh by encroaching on a portion of the park. 

 The pay-and-use toilet and cafeteria on a little over 1,000 sq ft carpet area will be thrown open to the public by December-end. 

 ?It is a novel idea to house a sophisticated cafeteria inside the park just above the pay-and-use toilet. If it clicks we shall try to introduce similar amenities in some other parks across the city,? mayor Mukherjee told Metro on Wednesday. 

 He maintained that the construction would not affect the beauty of the park. At present, over 500 small and medium-size parks dot the city. 

 Mayor-in-council member, parks and gardens, Hridayanand Gupta said the proposed cafeteria has been designed in such a manner that minimum space is required. 

 Though some civic officials had initially objected to the proposal fearing it would draw flak, the mayor used his ?special powers? to push the project through. 

 Councillor from ward 85 Debashish Kumar, who has been working on the project, said Rs 35 lakh has been earmarked for the entire project, including beautification of the park. He dismissed reports of morning walkers objecting to the project. ?The only thing we will have to ensure is cleanliness. After all, the cafeteria is housed just above a ground-floor toilet,? he added.

 Green activist Subhas Dutta said construction of a cafeteria inside a park violates Section 37 of the West Bengal Town and Country (Planning amp; Development) Act, 1979. ?No structure above the ground level is allowed in a park barring those that relate to public amenities,? he added.

 Suicide attempt behind bars

 OUR BUREAU

 Exposing the state of affairs at Presidency jail, a life convict attempted suicide on Friday by setting himself ablaze. A critically injured Abhigyan Basu (36) was shifted to the Bangur hospital before being admitted to SSKM Hospital. 

 Doctors attending Basu said his condition is unstable. The jail authorities have informed the convict?s relatives about the incident through Calcutta Police.

 A jail official said the process of moving the injured convict to the hospital was delayed because there were no doctors in the jail in the morning.

 Inspector general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty said Basu, who was arrested in connection with a murder from the Lake police station area in 1992 and subsequently lodged in the jail, attempted suicide by dousing himself with a bottle of diesel around 7 am on Friday. An inquiry has been ordered into the incident.

 ?We have to find out the immediate provocation for the act. We have also contacted his family members,? Chakraborty said.

 Jail sources said Basu had quarrelled with other inmates on Thursday night, when Kali puja was going on in a pandal inside the jail.

 ?He had protested against the poor quality of food served to him. Besides, he was upset at being asked not to play the drums. We had no idea regarding his whereabouts at night as everyone was busy celebrating the puja. This morning, we were alerted by his cries for help after he had set himself ablaze. He had collected the diesel from the kitchen,? said a jail official.

 Chakraborty, however, denied that the convict had obtained the diesel from the jail kitchen. He said the truth will come out after the probe is completed.

 ?The convict is a known trouble-maker and was transferred to several other jails for his perpetual ill temper,? the inspector general added.

 A senior jail warder said Basu, ever since he was transferred to Presidency jail from Midnapore Central jail on medical grounds, had been creating trouble on one issue or another. 

 ?A few days ago, he had threatened to expose a racket inside the jail if he was not allowed to go out of his cell and mix with other inmates. He is also a drug addict,? the warder said. 

 The incident, coming close on the heels of the deaths of a number of inmates in Alipore Central jail and Dum Dum Central jail, has embarrassed the state jail department. 

 The West Bengal Human Rights? Commission has involved itself in the matter by seeking a report from Presidency jail superintendent S.R. Hossain. 

 Wiser after the day?s development, the prison department has convened a meeting of jail superintendents sometime next week to discuss ways to intensify vigil on the inmates. 

 A section of jail officials feels warders on duty should constantly keep a watch on the inmates lodged in various cells.

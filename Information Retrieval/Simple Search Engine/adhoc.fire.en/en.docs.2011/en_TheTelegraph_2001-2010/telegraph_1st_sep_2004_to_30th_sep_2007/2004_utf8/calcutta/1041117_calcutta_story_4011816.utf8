The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fumes fan dire fires of lung disease

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcuttan is now in need of more oxygen than ever before. The reasons: declining green cover, hike in the number of vehicles and the people?s penchant for pan masala and tobacco. 

 The World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day saw city-based medical experts press the alarm bell on the sharp rise in the number of lung disease cases, responsible for a large number of deaths every year. 

 ?The number of such patients is rising significantly. If a proper survey is conducted, Calcutta will earn the dubious distinction of having more than two lakh COPD cases,? respiratory disease expert Pavan Agarwal said on Tuesday.

 According to Indian Epidemiological Survey reports, India is home to over 12.36 million COPD patients, compared with 6.5 million cancer patients. 

 Among the obstructive pulmonary disease patients, 70 per cent suffer from acute breathlessness.

 The disease is caused when the flow of air into the lungs and out is obstructed, causing persistent cough and breathlessness.

 Respiratory disease expert Asok Sengupta of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital explained that when a person inhales irritating particles, the bronchi produce more mucus. The irritation also causes inflammation or swelling of the bronchi. 

 ?The disease occurs when a large amount of irritants is inhaled over a short period of time or if a small amount is inhaled over a long duration,? said Sengupta.

 ?The inflammation and the excess mucus secretion causes tightening of the muscle bands, making the airways narrow and breathing very difficult,? he added. 

 Doctors also urged the state government to pay more attention to the fact that MBBS students get exposed to the COPD quite often. 

 ?Young doctors asked to treat obstructive pulmonary disease patients find themselves at a loss, because they hardly know the subject,? a doctor explained. 

 While smoking is considered the primary cause for COPD, doctors point out that they have been getting a lot of non-smoking cases, too.

 ?Apart from tobacco chewing, air pollution is another major cause for the spread of the disease,? Agarwal said at a COPD awareness programme.

 If left untreated, obstructive pulmonary disease can even lead to chronic bronchitis. 

 In a worse-case scenario, the disease can even cause emphysema, when the breathing tubes collapse.

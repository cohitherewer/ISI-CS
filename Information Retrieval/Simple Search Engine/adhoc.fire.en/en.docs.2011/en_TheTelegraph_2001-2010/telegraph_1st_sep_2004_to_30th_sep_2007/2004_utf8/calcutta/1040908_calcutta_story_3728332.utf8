 Elektra comes to town

 Greek tragedy, as we all know, is fraught with heightened action and tension, culminating in a denouement arousing feelings of deep fear and pathos, to evoke the catharsis of such emotions. This tragic intensity of Greek drama is revived in Swapnasandhanis latest production, Kolkatar Elektra, based on the Aeschylian tragedy, Agamemnon. Set against the backdrop of modern Calcutta, Kolkatar Elektra shockingly reveals to the audience the schisms that pervade adult human relationships, causing brutal effects on the younger generation. In the play, the loneliness of Pritha, wife of Indranath, drives her to develop an illicit relationship with her husbands friend, Augen. And when Indranath dies in an unforeseen mishap, the two get married. This is deeply resented by Rai (Elektra), daughter of Indranath and Pritha, who isolates herself from her family, secretly plotting to avenge her fathers death. The tragic incidents that follow are but easily anticipated, but what is horrifying is the unruffled alacrity with which Rai executes her plan of action. Written by Buddhadev Bose, the tragedy is a sharp critique of present-day society.

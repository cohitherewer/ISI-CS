 Acceding to pleas from various quarters, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has extended the immersion deadline of Lakshmi idols by a day. 

 An atheist and worshipper of Marx, Bhattacharjee was amused on Monday evening when home secretary Amit Kiran Deb confronted him with a problem: the immersion date for Lakshmi puja was fixed for Thursday, considered Lakshmibar (Lakshmi?s day). Bengali households and neighbourhood puja committees were expected to immerse the goddess on a Thursday, which went against traditional practice and religious sentiment. Bhattacharjee gave the go-ahead for readjusting the deadline. 

 ?The revised deadline for immersion of Lakshmi idols in the state has been fixed for Friday, October 29. The revision was made at the highest level,? Deb said on Monday evening at Writers? Buildings.

 ?In many Bengali households, Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped with ardour on Thursdays, Lakshmibar. Immersion on that very day would mean banishing her ? something no devotee can think of,? a government official said. 

 Lakshmi puja is traditionally observed on a full moon night (kojagari purnima) following Durga puja every year. A sumptuous spread of khichuri, naru, narkel bhaja, chirey (pressed rice) and taaler phopol (kernel of palmseed) is offered to the Goddess of Bounty. She is also worshipped by many on the night of Diwali, along with Ganesh. The notification issued by the Bengal government before Pujas had raised the hackles of both para puja organisers and families.

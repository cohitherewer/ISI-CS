 The INS Kirch: World-class, made in India

 The navy will do its bit to change the way natural disasters are handled in Calcutta and the districts.

 A week after taking over as naval officer in-charge (Bengal), Commodore A.K. Patnaik announced on Thursday his plan to set up a disaster management hub in the city.

 ?Whenever a natural calamity strikes this part of the country, we have no option but to wait for life-saving equipment and rescuers to arrive from faraway places like Visakhapatnam. Precious time, and in some cases, quite a few lives, are lost during this period. So, the navy has decided to take the lead and do something for the state,? Patnaik told Metro. 

 Patnaik has already called on Governor Viren J. Shah to discuss the issue. A naval team has started working on the modalities of the project. 

 ?Once the details are in place, we?ll start working on them. Our basic aim is to have all disaster management resources ready in the city,? Patnaik said at an ongoing workshop for defence correspondents in the city.

 ?We want to do many things that haven?t been attempted here before. For instance, we are now trying to get a submarine here,? Patnaik added.

 The navy has also decided to send INS Kirch, an indigenously-built missile corvette, to countries like Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam to showcase India?s ship-building capabilities. 

 The ship was designed by the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) and outfitted at Mazagon Dock Limited, Mumbai. 

 ?The ship will exhibit her capabilities during overseas deployment. The crew will project to the world that India, too, can build ships that are among the best in the world,? said Commander (operations) Dipankar Goswami.

 The 1,500-ton corvette is one of the frontline ships in the eastern fleet. She is designed to spearhead the navy?s advances in times of conflict. 

 During peace, the vessel is deployed on anti-terrorism and anti-piracy missions on the high seas.

 The ship?s arsenal includes 16 surface-to-surface missiles, a medium-range gun, anti-aircraft shoulder-launched missiles and a close-in weapon system. Around 91.16 m in length, INS Kirch can fire missiles at a target 130 km away. 

 She also has the capability to carry MATCH, a helicopter fitted with medium-range anti-submarine torpedo, and an Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH), explained navigation officer Sundeep S. Randhawa.

 Over the past several months, the corvette had been on overseas mission to various parts of southeast Asia.

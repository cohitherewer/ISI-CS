 A toy train, modelled on Fairy Queen, the oldest working broad gauge steam locomotive in the world as certified by the Guinness Book of World Records, will be a big draw in Calcutta this weekend.

 The toy train, presently being given the finishing touches at the Eastern Railway?s (ER) Liluah workshop, will be the main attraction at Rail Mela, a fair organised by the Eastern Railway Women?s Welfare Organisation at the ER sports complex in Behala on December 18 and 19. 

 ?The engine of the toy train is modelled on the Fairy Queen, the East India Railways locomotive constructed in 1855,? Soumitra Majumdar, chief public relations officer of ER, said on Sunday. The toy train is being constructed at the Liluah workshop from railway scrap. Fairy Queen is a major tourist attraction that runs between Delhi and Alwar with one coach. 

 ?This coach will draw a lot of attention. Although the toy train will run on diesel, the mechanism ensures that it belches,? the officer said. The train will run on a one-and-a-half-foot gauge and cover a circumference of 250 metres in one full circle. 

 Tunnels, bridges and level crossings will be set up to make the joy ride more interesting. The train will have four to five compartments, each having a capacity of 12 wooden seats. The guard will be dressed like Bholu, the elephant who is the mascot of the Indian Railways. 

 The concept has been borrowed from a toy train built by the Kharagpur workshop of the South Eastern Railways. ?That train is a showpiece in several fairs. We have improved on that design,? the official said. Since it is being built from scrap, the cost is minimum, restricted to a few thousand rupees. 

 There are plans to display it in other fairs and perhaps rent it out for shootings. The fair will have more than 100 stalls, a food plaza, spacecraft and other joy rides. The Railway?s treasured artefacts will be exhibited at the fair. Health check-up camps will be organised, where railway doctors will be present. 

 ER general manager Shyam Kumar said on Sunday that a Rs 9 crore project has been taken up to upgrade the Behala sports complex. He said Rs 4.6 crore has already been spent. A swimming pool of international standards is being constructed at the adjacent railway employees? colony. One of the reasons for organising the fair is to popularise the sports complex.

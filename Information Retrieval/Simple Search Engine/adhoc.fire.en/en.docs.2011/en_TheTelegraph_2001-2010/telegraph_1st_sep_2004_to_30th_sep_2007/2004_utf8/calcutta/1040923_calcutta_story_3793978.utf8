The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Ben Stiller?s back in town ? on the big screen, that is. He was great in Something About Mary, and brilliant in Meet the Parents. The sequel Meet the Fockers might not be here yet, but Hollywood?s much-loved comedian can be seen in two films in city halls ? Starsky and Hutch and Along Came Polly.

 The first, co-starring friend Owen Wilson, is based on the hugely-popular American TV series about two funny detectives in the 70s in a metropolis called Bay City. The film tells the story of their first big case. Here, the 38-year-old is at his humorous best, as is the other half of Jackie Chan in Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights.

 As famous as Ken Hutchinson (Wilson) and Dave Starsky (Stiller) is their trademark 1974 red Ford Torino. Putting in a stellar performance as police informer Huggy Bear is rapper Snoop Dogg, while eye candy comes in the form of Carmen Electra, Hutch?s girlfriend.

 Along Came Polly is a feel-good romance between an insurance salesman (Stiller) recovering from his wife?s infidelity on their honeymoon, and a waitress whom he knew back in high school, played by Jennifer Aniston.

 The behind-the-scenes funny moments were more noteworthy than the on-screen action, with a ferret that bit Stiller?s chin and wouldn?t let go. And then, there was a naked Frank Azaria. By his own admission in an interview, the son of two New York comedians was so struck with his pectorals that he didn?t even bother to glance at the man?s butt.

 Stiller even had to take salsa lessons, but was beaten by the 12-hour shooting of a racquetball scene. As the father of a two-year-old daughter put it: ?Those last 11 hours of the day were just torturous and horrible.?

Tia Carrere: Juror?s jodi

 She spoke some True Lies and shone brightly in the Rising Sun. And now you can catch Tia Carrere do some jury duty. Zee MGM, the international English movie channel, will show the 1995 film Jury Duty, on Thursday, at 9 pm.

 The highlight of this hilarious comedy is the funny portrayal of a juror by Pauly Shore, who plays the role of Tommy Collins. Tia plays Monica Lewis, the love interest of a jobless Tommy, who discovers that sequestered jurors earn free room and board, as well as $5 a day. Adding to the star cast of this John Fortenberry film are Shelly Winters, Charles Napier and Stanley Tucci.

 Tia, whose real name is Althea Rae Duhinio Janairo, was actually discovered in a grocery store by a film producer who thought she would be perfect for the part of Lani in Aloha Summer. 

 But Tia?s big break came in the form of Wayne?s World, where she played Cassandra, the love interest of Mike Myers. Of late, she has become a household name with her role of Sydney Fox in the telly adventure series Relic Hunter.

 The actress, who was last heard in the Disney animation Lilo and Stitch, will start shooting for a new film titled Beds And Breakfast, where she plays Susan, a girl who wants to break free from her busy New York life.

 The music of Swades is ready for release and trust director Asutosh Gowarikar to add more than a touch of novelty to the occasion. The Lagaan man, who gave India a much-needed Oscar nomination (after Mother India and Salaam Bombay) and took Aamir Khan to Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, has been keeping his next offering starring the other Khan, Shah Rukh, away from the public eye and ear.

Swades: Music to the ears

Now, at last, promotional trailers of the film have 

started appearing on the telly. And on Friday, almost as an anti-climax, the music 

launch programme will take place in the open ? in front of the Gateway of India. 

?The venue was Asutosh?s idea. The theme of the film is such that it deserves 

to be for the people,? says Ronnie Screwvala, CEO, UTV, which is producing the 

film.

 The garden in front the Gateway has been booked for the two-hour programme, which will be followed by a lavish dinner at the Hilton Tower hotel.

 Though Shah Rukh himself is away on a world tour with other Bollywood stars like Preity Zinta, Rani Mukherjee, Priyanka Chopra and Saif Ali Khan, present at the Swades music launch on Friday will be lyricist Javed Akhtar and composer A.R. Rahman.

 Two members of Gowarikar?s Lagaan XI will also be fielded ? Daya Shankar Pandey, better known as Goli, and Rajesh Vivek. ?They play an aspiring cook and the village post master in Swades,? says executive producer Sunita Gowarikar, the director?s wife. The seven songs, according to the executive producer, display a ?fantastic range of genre and mood?.

As of now, the director is closeted in a studio in 

Chennai, busy with the background score of the film that has been shot at NASA. 

?He will be flying down for a day to attend the programme,? Sunita says. There 

is a wait ahead for the film though, with the release scheduled post-Diwali for 

December 6.

 What happens when a man confronts his dead wife while honeymooning with his second? Shock, suspicion and a sinister something waiting to happen.

 All hell breaks loose when Kushal Chakraborty?s first wife, who ?died in an accident?, makes a dramatic comeback with a new look in Anahuto Atithi. The gripping five-episode thriller starts with Kushal taking a trip with bride June to Manali during the Puja holidays. 

 They decide to drop in at his first wife?s place to console her bereaved mother, only for the lovey-dovey couple to be greeted by the dead woman!

 A murder mystery, a man foxing his second wife, or a mean double game ? what is it after all? 

 ?There?s a twist in the tale which I am not going to reveal,? chirped June. If you want to see the end of it, keep an eye on Akash Bangla. Anahuto Atithi airs on Monday, September 27, 9 pm.

 Best of both worlds in healthcare

 - Cross-referral boost to medical tourism

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The approach to the Wellness Centre inside Vedic Village

 Effective management of chronic ailments like osteo-arthritis and degenerative nerve disorders with ayurveda and panchakarma, a wealth of wellness through naturopathy, Swedish massage and Chinese medicine, and a comprehensive bouquet of state-of-the-art prophylactic and therapeutic packages?

 Vedic Village and Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals have joined hands in a cross-referral contract to hold out a win-win formula that could provide genuine momentum to medical tourism in the city. The strategic alliance enables both the institutions to mutually refer patients as value addition.

 Members and guests of Vedic Village can use the diagnostic facilities available under one roof at Apollo Gleneagles. Conversely, patients at the Bypass multiple-speciality hospital, who opt to move out after undergoing intensive treatment, surgery or cosmetic intervention, can check into the resort with a medical spa, offering a range of ayurveda, homoeopathy and natural therapies.

 Vedic Village, which already has an ayurveda consultancy tie-up with Belle Vue, will send its doctors to the Apollo outpatients department twice a week. ?At Apollo, we will start a department of allied health sciences, initially with ayurveda and homoeopathy, and later, branch out into wellness concepts derived from naturopathy principles,? says C.M. Pradyumna, ayurvedacharya and alternative medicine expert at the Sanjeeva Wellness Centre of Vedic Village.

 ?The project has great synergy for both the partners and would add value to the city?s healthcare delivery system at a time when the concept of holistic treatment is catching on. A large number of our post-operative and recuperating patients can go there, while Vedic?s guests can avail of our preventive health packages,? says Apollo Gleneagles CEO S.N. Reddy.

 A combination of different systems of medicines can offer ?meaningful treatment? for conditions like Parkinsonism, Alzheimer?s disease and multiple sclerosis, alternative medicine experts at the health spa maintain. Different manifestations of musculo-skeletal disorders can also be treated by Swedish massage therapy.

 The alliance will also include educational programmes on lifestyle management for diseases like diabetes and hypertension, according to M.J. Robertson, CEO Vedic Village. ?It is significant that more and more healthcare facilities are realising the relevance of alternative medicine. The tie-up with Apollo Gleneagles will give patients the best of both worlds,? Robertson promises.

 The cross-referral facility will be a boon to ?hundreds of patients travelling from other countries or neighbouring states and seeking world-class holistic treatment with an emphasis on wellness?, hopes an Apollo Gleneagles official. 

 Chairman of the Apollo Hospitals Group Prathap C. Reddy has been at the forefront of the effort to boost medical tourism in the country, and feels Calcutta, thanks to its geographical situation, is ideally suited to become an international healthcare hub.

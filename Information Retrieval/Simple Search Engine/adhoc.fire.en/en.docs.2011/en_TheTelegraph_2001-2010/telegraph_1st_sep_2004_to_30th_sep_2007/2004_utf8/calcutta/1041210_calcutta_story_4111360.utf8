 A step out of shadow lines

 They live in the shadows of our homes, indispensable and almost invisible. Theatre troupe Ensemble?s latest production Shinrir Niche turns the spotlight on the people living on the periphery ? the hired helps, gardeners and drivers who matter most but get little recognition. 

 Conceptualised and directed by Sohag Sen, Shinrir Niche is set on the stairs of a highrise with a cast of 18 actors who take the audience through the trials and tribulations of hired hands (picture above by Aranya Sen).

 ?The issue was bugging me for quite sometime. Because however liberal we are, we tend to adopt a different approach towards them and I think we are extremely hypocritical about it. A Hindu-Muslim issue has crept in though while improvising the play,? says Sen, of the production that has evolved through workshops.

 Over the past few years, all Ensemble productions have developed through workshops which form a mandatory part of Sen?s technique. After visualising the concept, she leaves it to the actors to come up with suggestions and give a definitive course to the play.

 Ensemble had put up two one-act plays on AIDS, Aparadh and Proti Chhoy Second, in early 2004. 

 For the content of Shinrir Niche, Sen has stitched together several real-life incidents, ?some of which are quite hair-raising?. 

 Those dominating the stage space are the helps and Sen has made the ?malik paksha? deliberately invisible. We get to hear about them through telephonic conversation, she explains. The craft of the play is also meant to be a bit crude, in sync with the characters.

 ?The end of Shinrir Niche is somewhat like a fairy-tale. That?s unreal, but that?s how it should be in real life. The play is not didactic. It?s rather entertaining, with a lot of music,? Sen adds. 

 Shinrir Niche takes the stage at Academy of Fine Arts at 3 pm on December 12. The next show is slated for the following day, same venue, at 6.30 pm.

 The way our generation is shaping up, anjali at the pandal might just be replaced by e-anjali. So many young people prefer to stay at home on these four days instead of venturing out to the crowded pandals. But anjali on the Net does not make any sense to me. That sense of reverence is just not there. There are certain things that will always remain traditional, no matter how modern the world gets. Technology can?t distort the basic cultural fabric of the world. I would always want to be present in front of the goddess. That is why I agree to offers of inaugurating pandals or judging puja awards. At least that gives me the chance to view the idol. Since it is not possible for us to go down and give anjali at the neighbouring baroari puja, we usually visit a puja at a friend?s or a neighbour?s. This is what many people in our industry do. Last year, Ma (Moon Moon Sen) and I gave anjali at Tutu Bose?s house.

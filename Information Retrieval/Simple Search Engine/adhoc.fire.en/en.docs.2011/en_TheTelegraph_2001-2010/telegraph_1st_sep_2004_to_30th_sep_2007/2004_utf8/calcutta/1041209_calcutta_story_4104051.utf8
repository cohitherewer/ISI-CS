The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Camera vigil at two key crossings

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Alarmed at the spurt in road mishaps at the Dunlop crossing near Belghoria and at Karunamoyee, in Salt Lake, the traffic department of North 24-Parganas has installed two video monitoring systems (VMS) to control traffic movement. 

 Director-general of police Shyamal Dutta will inaugurate the systems on Thursday.

 The move follows Dutta?s visit to Salt Lake about a fortnight ago. He had expressed concern over the rise in criminal activities in the township and transferred the officers-in-charge of Bidhannagar (East) and Bidhannagar (South) police stations in a bid to revamp security arrangements. 

 ?There are regular traffic snarls during peak hours at the four-point junctions at Dunlop and Karunamoyee. The new system, in addition to helping us manage traffic better, will be useful to trace anti-socials who escape to suburban areas after committing crimes in the city,? explained Praveen Kumar, district superintendent of police.

 Traffic department officers said two closed-circuit movie cameras have been installed on high towers at the road junctions.

 ?While the camera installed at Dunlop will be connected with the police control room at Belghoria through a cable network, the one put up at Derozio Bhavan, near Karunamoyee, will be linked with the police control room at Bidhannagar. We can have a clear view of nearly half-a-kilometre of road through the cameras,? a senior officer said on Wednesday.

 According to an estimate, nearly 4,000 vehicles ply through the Dunlop crossing per hour during peak hours every day. Almost an equal number plies through the Karunamoyee junction during the same period.

 ?Officers at the control rooms can monitor the volume of vehicles at the crossings through the VMS and issue instructions to ensure smooth traffic flow,? Kumar added.

 A major advantage of the remote monitoring system is that it can help officers record the licence number of errant vehicles moving at a high speed after an accident, particularly at night. 

 ?After 10 pm, traffic guards are normally off the vulnerable traffic points. This provides ample opportunity to the errant vehicles to make a getaway. Now, we can record their licence numbers sitting in our control rooms,? said an officer.

 The system will also help officers treat the crossings as exit points for vehicles. 

 ?We have bitter experiences of criminals fleeing through the two road junctions after committing crimes in the city,? said an officer. 

 ?Once they escape our clutches at the Dunlop crossing, they can easily slip into Barrackpore on the one hand and Howrah and the neighbouring Hooghly district on the other,? he added. 

 ?Criminals also take refuge in Rajarhat and its adjoining areas after escaping through the Kuranamoyee junction,? he signed off.

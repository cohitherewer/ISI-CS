The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Marriage mall

 ZEESHAN JAWED, HIMIKA 

 CHAUDHURI 

 No more running from pillar to post to put together a dazzling trousseau this season. The Great Indian Wedding has just got easier to organise with everything from cosmetics to bridal ensembles available under one roof.

 Shagun,the first wedding mall in the city at 10A Shakespeare Sarani, will formally open shop on Saturday, offering a glittering array of diamond, gold and pearl jewellery. 

 The range covers costume jewellery for pre-wedding bashes, lehnga-choli sets, sherwanis, shawls, stoles, scarves, accessories, cosmetics, perfumes? Just about everything you need for D-day, before and after, including wedding cards, bridal furnishings and even crockery.

 ?The Calcutta wedding market is pegged at Rs 7,000 crore, but the entire pie was divided into innumerable pieces because of the lack of a one-stop shop in the city,? mall owner Jaydeep K. Khaitan said on Thursday.

 The 20,000 sq-ft mall packs in five floors of wedding ware with the ground floor dedicated to saris, lehnga-cholis and dress materials. Accessories will be available on the first floor, cosmetics, footwear, bags and crockery on the second, furnishings on the third, sherwanis on the fourth, and lingerie, shawls, stoles and scarves on the fifth floor.

 The price range is as wide. Saris start from Rs 200 and go beyond Rs 2 lakh, while footwear starts at Rs 400 and ends at Rs 14,000.

 The emphasis will be more on women, with only a limited range of sherwanis and jodhpuris available for men. ?We don?t have much space for men?s stuff at the moment,? admitted Khaitan.

 The owners hope to rake in exponential returns on the Rs 15 crore project even though it seems like a seasonal business. ?Wedding shopping takes place more or less through the year, so we aren?t expecting any lean period. We are looking to garner returns worth Rs 35 crore in the first year itself,? claimed Khaitan.

 B?day weaves

 It?s celebration time at Weavers Studio, the address for natural weaves and intricate hand embroidery in town. The occasion: 11th birthday bash of the boutique on Anil Moitra Road.

 The treat: an annual sale of collections from labels across the country.

 Silk kurtas, woollen jackets and hand-printed tussar weaves form bulk of the winter bonanza.

 The Yellow Leaf Co is wooing a young clientele with silk and tussar unisex hand-printed or tie-dyed kurtas in smart cuts and a variety of shades. The label Bodhi is literally creating ripples with self-printed water patterns on saris. Mostly in shades of blue, these six yards of tussar have been jazzed up with a sprinkling of glittering mukaish work to create the effect of ?lights reflected in a pool?.

 A major draw at the design studio is the intricately designed range of woollen jackets adorned with floral and geometric patterns from The Kashmir Loom Co. Pashmina shawls from the same brand is another attraction. ?These make excellent gift items in the wedding season. You wouldn?t really mind spending a few thousand on these as the garments are often cherished as heirlooms,? insisted the Kashmiri representative.

 The predominantly black and white colour palette in this section is pepped up with thread embroidery in bright shades.

 Then there are saris and salwar suits from Sutra, a line stitched together by Assam-based designer Julie Kagti. The highlight here is the textile weave, apart from printing, resist-dyeing and embroidery, all of which is handcrafted. Bright greens and pinks dominate this section with a special emphasis on texturisation techniques like pin-tucks and patchwork. The straight cuts make for smart semi-formal wear. 

 Besides the new range, the usual collection of cotton-woven fabric dyed in natural colours is also on offer at discounted prices. Chiffon and silk scarves in muted shades and light weaves help accessorise the gear for an evening do this party season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Patna-Barasat link of forged marks

 - Dirty dozen of racket now in custody

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From Shyambazar to Lake Town to far-away Barasat ? the racket that ensured free-flow of fake marksheets into Calcutta seems to have spread far and wide, well beyond the borders of the city. 

 The revelation came late on Tuesday, following the arrest of the owner of another correspondence college. 

 Debasish Pal was arrested from the residence of his in-laws on 44/1, Dum Dum Road, following a raid at his correspondence college in Barasat, some 35 km from the city. 

 With Pal?s arrest, the total number rounded up in connection with fake marksheets has shot up to 12. 

 Police have recovered fake marksheets and admit cards of different universities, including Bhagalpur University and Bihar Intermediate Council, from Pal?s institute ? St Mary?s Correspondence College ? following a late-night raid by the police on Tuesday. 

 Pal was produced in Bankshal court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody till October 6. 

 ?Our raids are on and it?s too premature to comment on how many more are part of the racket,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (detective department). 

 Investigations revealed that 44-year-old Pal had been running the college for some time now, promising many in and around Barasat a certificate in Junior Basic Training and then duping them with forged documents. 

 Police claimed he had made a neat packet of Rs 4 lakh, at least. Things came to such a pass that a councillor of Barasat Municipality was forced to close the college a few days before the police raid. 

 Also the owner of a travel agency on KNC Road, Pal had been absconding since then. When the cops swooped down on his in-laws? place, he tried to hoodwink them by impersonating one Bapi Pal.

 ?Pal is also one of the people who had been threatening police sources over the telephone for some time,? claimed an investigating officer.

 Like others arrested earlier in the racket, Pal would collect the marksheets from Sukhdeo Kumar, who owned a press in the Budhmarg area of Patna. Kumar used to operate with the help of one Sanjay Sharma, a 32-year-old resident of Kankarbagh, in Patna, who would lure in the customers. 

 Sharma would supply almost anything ? from Intermediate marksheets to a bachelor?s degree. 

 While a first division in Intermediate would cost anything between Rs 500 and Rs 600, a technical diploma would cost higher, around Rs 1,500. 

 Investigations so far seem to suggest that apart from the four correspondence colleges, there are several others who would toe the Bihar line to procure fake marksheets for their students.

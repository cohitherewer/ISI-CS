The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

Rituparna: On song

 Guess who?s aaj ka Robin Hood? City boy Sharad Kapoor, who makes his Tollywood debut next month with Satarupa Sanyal?s Kalo Cheetah.

 The man ? ?a kind of Robin Hood who gives shelter to a bunch of orphans,? says the director ? is on a risky mission to grab some rare pictures of kalo cheetah on the picturesque Darjeeling-Gangtok border. The ride becomes a lot less rough when co-star Rituparna Sengupta ? looking quite ravishing ? joins him in on the way.

 ?But the mystery deepens at that point when the hero realises he has been cheated,? says Satarupa, who has been waiting for months for her thriller to release in the city facing a screen jam.

 Apart from calling the shots from behind the camera, Satarupa has penned and composed quite a few tracks for her first major masala film. ?Also, Nachiketa has sung a Hindi number which he composed on a Mexican Tango tune,? adds the director. Satarupa?s leading lady, by the way, is off to Mumbai to shoot for her second Bollywood film, Chandan Arora?s Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh. But before that, Rituparna dropped in at Music World for the music launch of Kalo Cheetah. 

Sabrina: Festive flavour

 Gili Gili Pasha Diwali Tamasha. It may sound as spooky as abracadabra, but this is the spell that holds the key to what Diwali eve is going to sparkle with on Cartoon Network. The home of Tom and Jerry and Scooby Doo will light up with a special programming block by this name between November 6 and 12. Every day, the network will add spice to the festivities by beaming new programmes and popular animated movies from 2 pm to 4 pm. 

Jungle Tales and Sabrina will premiere 

on November 6. While the first is a locally produced venture based on Panchatantra, 

the other is the tale of a 12-year-old with a big heart who is half-mortal, half-witch. 

 On Day One, the movie Tintin and the Calculus Affair will fire the proceedings followed by Batman amp; Mr Freeze: Subzero the next day at 3 pm. The list rolls out one must-watch name after another ? Tom amp; Jerry: The Magic Ring, Barbie as Rapunzel, The Scarecrow and Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island. 

 On Diwali, the fun continues till 6 pm with the airing of the spectacular full-length animated film Ramayan ? The Legend of Prince Rama.

 It?s an auction of a different kind where the lowest bidder wins! Broadcaster STAR is launching the second round of its Reverse Auction ? Kismat Jagao contest, following the super success of the first one. This twist to the usual auction process requires participants to SMS their lowest bid for jewellery worth Rs 25 lakh.

 ?Usually, someone would put in a bid for one rupee thinking it can?t get lower,? explained a spokesperson. ?But we?re looking at the lowest bid which would have to be a unique number.? For instance, in the first contest, Jaya Jetley, a tax assistant from Delhi won jewellery worth Rs 20 lakh by bidding Rs 95.72, a figure quoted by none of the other 67 lakh messages.

 The Diwali special contest starts on November 3 and closes on November 17. The winner will be announced on November 20. In order to participate in the auction, a mobile user needs to type ?BID? followed by a space and then their personal bid amount (BID 6.44 or BID 16.94, for instance) and send it to 7827. Happy bidding!

 If your film is named Waqt: A Race Against Time, can you afford to lag behind in your shooting schedule? You can?t. So despite having such big names like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar in the star cast, director Vipul Shah was able to complete his new film in a record 40 days.

 The film brings back the successful Aankhen team that scored in such a big way at the box-office. Currently, the post-production for the film is on at full speed and we?ll get to see the film in no waqt.

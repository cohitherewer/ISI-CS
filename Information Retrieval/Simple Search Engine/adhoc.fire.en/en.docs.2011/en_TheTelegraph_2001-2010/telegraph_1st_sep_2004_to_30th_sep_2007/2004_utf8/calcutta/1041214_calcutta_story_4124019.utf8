The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Global queue at B-school

 - Overseas recruiters swamp Joka institute with summer placements

 A STAFF REPORTER

 As Indian corporations continue their bull run in the international marketplace, budding managers from this part of the world are fast becoming the darlings of global corporations.

 If the results of the summer placements at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) are any indication, the stocks of management graduates from the Joka campus have never been higher for overseas recruiters.

 With more than 30 global offers arriving for the batch of 263 students ? highest among the big-league business schools in the country ? going global has become the flavour of the season at IIMC.

 ?It is a good sign that more and more companies are hiring our students and giving them international exposure for six to eight weeks as summer interns,? said Shekhar Chaudhuri, director, IIMC, commenting on the trend.

 Working with a corporation as a summer intern is an integral part of the two-year management programme. Summer placements are important on the B-school calendar as they indicate the nature of final placements.

 Known for its focus on quantitative methods and an edge in finance disciplines, IIMC has always been a happy hunting ground for the banking and finance companies. 

 This year, too, global investment bank and finance companies like Lehman Brothers (eight offers), Merrill Lynch (seven offers) and JP Morgan (five offers) have scaled up their scouting operations on campus.

 According to Chaudhuri, this trend of picking up IIMC students for global operations should not be looked at in isolation: ?We have a number of initiatives, like student exchange programmes with overseas B-schools and collaborations with foreign universities for mutual sharing of faculty resources. Along with the quality of teaching, these initiatives have also contributed to our global positioning.?

 With over 71 companies queuing up and offering openings in diverse disciplines, the students and the authorities are bullish about a repeat of the recruitment rampage during the final placements scheduled for March 2005.

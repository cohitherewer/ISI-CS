 Jabs at father mental state

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The defence team in the Rajnis Patel case sought to prove on Friday that the budding cricketer?s father, Manoj, was mentally unstable when he lodged a police complaint, accusing five SSKM doctors of being responsible for his son?s death. 

 Defence counsel Amitava Ganguly and Dipit Bose tried to convince the Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court that Manoj?s complaint should not be taken seriously.

 Ganguly, appearing for prime accused Dilip Majumdar, asked Manoj: ?Why didn?t you ask the doctors to carry out a post-mortem?? 

 The father replied that he was very upset after his son?s death. ?I was not in the right frame of mind to ask for a post-mortem, nor was I confident enough to lodge a police complaint the day Rajnis died.? 

 Ganguly countered: ?But you lodged the FIR on June 3, a day after your son died. Were you absolutely fit then?? 

 Manoj replied: ?I filed the complaint on June 3 because I had to leave for Patna the next day to perform the last rites of my son at our ancestral home. I was yet to recover from the shock of losing my only son.? 

 Struggling to keep pace with the volley of questions, Manoj was groping for words to convince the court that he was, indeed, in the right frame of mind when he filed the FIR. 

 ?I told the police all I could remember at that time and did not try to implicate anyone on my own. I only told the truth, nothing else,? he added. 

 Taking over from Ganguly, counsel Bose asked Manoj why did he not accuse the hospital management for his son?s death. In his complaint to the Medical Council of India, Manoj had implicated the SSKM authorities, too.

 Bose asked: ?Why did you not name the hospital management or the other two doctors ? D. Banerjee and Michael Heera ? who were involved in your son?s treatment?? 

 Manoj averred: ?I was convinced that the accused five were responsible for my son Rajnis? death.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Timeless beats beyond boundaries

Zeeshan Jawed, Nisha Lahiri

It 

was an evening of music and nostalgia at CC amp;FC on Sunday night, in a countdown 

to The Telegraph 31st Nite. The retro theme was a throwback to Park Street 

at the Original 70s Music Nite, with Louiz Banks, Pam Crain, Usha Uthup, Don Saigal 

and Skinny Alley rocking the crowd till the wee hours.

 Saris and grey hair were all visible in abundance on the dance floor, as the audience relived the good ol? days when Ushadi made musical magic at Trincas or Pam Crain brought the house down at Mocambo. There were a few top hats and some strapless dresses, but the evening belonged to the golden oldies ? one elderly couple danced the night away from start to finish, drawing loud cheers from the onlookers.

 Some of those who enjoyed the magic weren?t, as Usha put it, even born when Park Street was the place to hang out for the hip and happening. Nevertheless, the youngsters ? toddlers, too ? joined in the trip down music memory lane. Don?s coat came off as he made his unique brand of smart moves on stage, while Pam crooned to the crowd. And Usha, of course, got the dance floor jam-packed with fancy-footed jiving.

A bit of Barry White, Abba and Boney M, and classics 

like Santana?s Black magic woman, George Benson?s On Broadway, Peggy 

Lee?s Fever, Roy Orbison?s Pretty woman, Eagle?s Hotel California, 

Stevie Wonder?s I just called to say, Ben E. King?s Stand by me? 

There was no stopping the music as the listeners ? and dancers ? called for more, 

be it Latin, jazz, rock or pop.

 Skinny Alley kicked off the proceedings, followed by Don and Pam doing duets with Jayshree lending her voice for backing vocals. Shiva drummed up the right beats and Louiz, true to form, was a keyboard sensation. Usha started with her trademark I believe in music, backed by veterans like Sumit Ramchandran on guitar.

 Although the food on offer didn?t match the ambience, what added a touch of authenticity to the event was the decor ? original-look neon signboards of Park Street restaurants, from Sky Room and Blue Fox to Trincas and Flury?s, adding warmth to the cold winter night.

 The young and old raised a toast to the past and more music in future.

 Domino effect

 Revellers at Tantra rocked to the tunes of DJ Domino from London this Christmas weekend. The 26-year-old turn-tabler performed in Calcutta for the first time. Previously she has performed in Mumbai and Goa but she felt nothing compares to the enthusiastic Calcutta crowd. 

 ?It was a privilege to play for Tantra?s anniversary. Anyway, I did not expect such a big crowd at this time of the night or should I say morning,? said the DJ, a little dazed early on Christmas morning. 

 Domino conquered the console well past midnight. But to everybody?s surprise, instead of a lull, the footfalls increased with every passing minute. Tracks like Fire by Asterix, Cyclone, Final oblivion and Turn me on kept the dance floor packed through and through. 

 By the time she took to the console for the second time on December 25, word had spread and there was an even bigger crowd to jive to her tunes. Needless to say, the Saturday night fever caught on fast and the party was in full swing by midnight.

 The New York-born DJ is now based in London but she has been performing all over the world including Australia, Spain and Japan. 

 Jamaican jive

 Exotica is clearly the flavour of this festive week and Oberoi Grand is not to be left behind. Jamaican jammin? is ruling The Chowringhee Bar till December 30 with singer Kaiya Manning. 

 The England-born singer of Jamaican descent delivers a wide repertoire comprising Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Barbra Streisand, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears covers. 

 The voice is powerful and body language electric. Kaiya already has an album to her credit and is currently working on her second album titled All over again. 

 Kaiya started young at the age of 15 and since then has toured heavily and done opening acts for the likes of James Brown, Eddy Floyd and Aretha Franklin. She has trained for seven years in vocals and audience interaction. 

 And music is not her only introduction. The charismatic vocalist was adjudged top model by a leading news daily in England in 1990. 

 But after 30 years in the business of music, there?s little else Kaiya can think of. ?Come to think of it I have not done anything in life besides music and more music,? she said. 

 Kaiya is now looking forward to her second tour to Australia with Boney M. ?I am really excited about this tour. The first tour to Belfast brought us many accolades,? she smiled.

 But that is after she has won the heart of Calcutta. ?I have now been visiting this wonderful city for a long time and find the crowd here very receptive. It?s really nice to have Calcuttans dancing to my tunes once again,? said Kaiya. 

 Apart from ?peppy numbers to usher in the new year?, Kaiya promises a lot of jazz, club and Calypso music at the grand finale on New Year?s Eve by the Oberoi poolside.

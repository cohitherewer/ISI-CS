The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Medical muddle at crisis point

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gargi Bhattacharya. Ranked 16th in Madhyamik 

2001. Completed first year in electronic and telecom engineering, Jadavpur University.

 Sumanta Chakraborty. Scored 92 per cent in 

HS 2003. Completed first year B.Sc (zoology), Presidency College.

 Soma Chatterjee (name changed). Studied in 

Lady Brabourne College for two years. Passed B.Sc Part-I (zoology honours) in 

2004, with a high first class.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee mingled with this trio and 72 other bright boys and girls who now find themselves at a cruel career crossroad.

 Last month?s Supreme Court order cancelling their admission under the NRI quota to the first-year MBBS course ? which many had opted for at the expense of other courses they were pursuing ? has pushed them to the exit door of the class they have been attending for three months now. And left their academic prospects in peril even after payment of an enhanced fee of Rs 9 lakh-plus.

 The students called off their three-day hunger strike at SSKM Hospital after Bhattacharjee met them on Wednesday afternoon.

 ?We understand the unenviable situation these students find themselves in. We cannot allow their careers to be ruined. We will approach a bench of the Supreme Court,? said the chief minister.

 This was Bhattacharjee?s first meeting with the students who have been nursing the feeling that his government has been indifferent to their plight. The SSKM Hospital visit came on the heels of a delegation of anxious mothers of at least a dozen affected students meeting Meera Bhattacharjee, the chief minister?s wife, late on Tuesday with a plea to intervene.

 ?My family is going through a nightmare,? Shanti Bhattacharya, a doctor in a government hospital, told Metro. ?My daughter, a brilliant student, has never had any problems with admissions or studies till now. But today, her future seems completely uncertain.?

 What has put the career of all these 75 students in jeopardy is a series of events since last year involving opening up of undergraduate medical courses at SSKM and at Midnapore Medical College and Hospital.

 The entrance test was held on August 17, 2003. By November 2003, 150 students were selected, but till August 2004 the Medical Council of India (MCI) refused permission to SSKM and Midnapore Medical College. Finally, 105 students took admission after the MCI nod.

On October 30, the Supreme Court ruled that only 30 

among these 105 students would be allowed under the NRI quota and the rest of 

the seats would be handed over to students from the 2004 Joint Entrance Examination 

merit list.

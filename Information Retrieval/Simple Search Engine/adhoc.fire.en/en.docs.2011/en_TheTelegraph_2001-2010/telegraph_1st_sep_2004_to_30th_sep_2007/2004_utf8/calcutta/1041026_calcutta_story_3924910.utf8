The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Teen rape alleged

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the disclosure of the Navami night molestation of a Polish woman in the city comes the allegation of a rape, on Dashami night, in Icchapur, 36 km away.

 Four youths, between 18 and 20 years, picked up a 14-year-old girl from Icchapur?s Purbasha Pally, gagged her and took her behind a club, where one of them allegedly raped her. 

 A complaint has been lodged at Noapara police station, and the four are now in custody, as also a fifth person allegedly involved in the crime.

 The girl has been sent for medical tests and a case of rape has been initiated.

 Superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Parveen Kumar denied that the girl had been raped. ?We arrested the boys on charges of hooliganism and attempted rape,? he asserted.

 Echoing Kumar?s views, another senior officer said: ?The arrests were more of a precaution, as the youths were harassing women. But let me also tell you that the girl doesn?t have a very good reputation, either.?

 However, Section 376 of the IPC, under which the youths have been booked, suggests that girl had actually been raped. 

 In the city, detective chief Peeyush Pandey conceded on Monday that besides the Dover Terrace incident, involving the Polish woman, there had been at least two other incidents of alleged molestations on Navami night. 

 One took place in the port area, resulting in the arrest of Ramprasad Mahato, and the other at Maidan Metro station. 

 In the second incident, Ramesh Sharma, of Rishra, was arrested. 

 As for the Dover Terrace incident, an officer said: ?As the woman has left for Rajasthan, there is not much we can do to reconstruct the incident based on her account.?

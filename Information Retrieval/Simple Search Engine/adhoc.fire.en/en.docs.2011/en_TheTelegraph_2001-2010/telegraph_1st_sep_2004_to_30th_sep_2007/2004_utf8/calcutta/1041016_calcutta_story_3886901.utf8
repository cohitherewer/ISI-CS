The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mini in a hurry hits three

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A minibus knocked down three pedestrians, one of whom died later, in Thakurpukur on Friday morning, sparking a three-hour blockade on MG Road. 

 Residents vented their anger at police and civic apathy by smashing the windscreens of buses and autorickshaws. The killer vehicle was impounded, but the driver is absconding.

 The accident occurred around 11 am near Haridevpur market. The victims were walking down the road, when the minibus, on the Kalitala-Howrah route, hit them. 

 They were rushed to MR Bangur Hospital, where 21-year-old Rakesh Shaw died.

 As news spread, local residents and traders hit the road, demanding immediate repairs and deployment of traffic police. They also demanded the driver?s arrest. 

 Commuters had a harrowing time as buses on routes 40, 40A and 40B and minibuses could not ply. 

 Rathin Haldar, a resident, alleged that repeated pleas to the PWD and the civic body for repairing the ?accident-prone? road had been ignored. 

 Local Trinamul Congress councillor Ratna Sur said: ?I have written to the PWD minister several times. The only response has been a verbal assurance by the officials.?

 Additional superintendent of police Rajesh Subarno said the proposal to post traffic cops in the locality was being considered.

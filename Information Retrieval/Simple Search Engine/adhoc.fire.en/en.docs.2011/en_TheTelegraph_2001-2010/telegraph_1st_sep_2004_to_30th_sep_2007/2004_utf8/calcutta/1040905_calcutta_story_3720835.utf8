The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Next weekend you can be at...

Babli 

Incurable romantics thirsting for an authentic rural 

experience minus the warts of village India will find a perfect hideout in Babli. 

The 12.5 acres of farm, orchard, vegetable garden, pond, pen and barn provide 

a complete natural therapy to wash away the grit and grime of urban existence. 

It takes a while to get used to the lush greenery for eyes tired of dull city 

greys. But once the idea of a rural farm resort set in the midst of the russet 

earth of Birbhum sinks in, one is all too willing to hibernate under the canopy 

of towering trees and fragrant flowers.

Situated at a distance of 11-13 km from the university 

town of Shantiniketan on the Illambazar-Bolpur Road, Babli offers basic modern 

amenities like water and electricity along with Spartan lodging in quaint cottages. 

Food at the common canteen is homely fare minus all frills.

 There are printed instructions about the code of conduct that includes not wasting scarce resources in the area like water and electricity. If the constraints put you off, Babli is not for you. But if soaking in the pristine ambience in the midst of abundant flora with the resident livestock adding to the variety is your idea of a cosy weekend getaway, Babli is just the place for you.

Aiming at complete self-sufficiency, Babli grows almost 

everything it needs (rice, part of the wheat, sugarcane, turmeric, ginger, seasonal 

vegetables, fruits and even fodder and timber) and sells some surplus produce 

as well. Building a virtual forest out of barren land through over 10 years of 

composite farming, Babli also boasts over 80 varieties of flowering trees, several 

ornamental trees and ayurvedic plants. Planned water harvesting ensures that Babli 

has sufficient supply through the year to meet its sundry needs in an area plagued 

by a perennial water crisis, except during monsoons. Three wells, a miniature 

tube well, a series of underground brick channels to harness rainwater and contour 

embankments to collect rain water in ponds for ducks are the simple but effective 

measures taken by Babli planners.

 There is seasonal cultivation of fish in the ponds (depending on the availability of water), along with poultry farming and animal husbandry. The cows, goats, hens and ducks can be caught at their active best in the early hours of the morning when they are all let out of their barns and pens for grazing and feeding at select areas on the farm. Apart from its own consumption of eggs, meat and milk, Babli also fulfils a larger role as Basudhara: The Doodhwala, under which it combines its own milk production with that of 50 small farmers in the vicinity, which is supplied to over a 100 customers in Bolpur and Shantiniketan. The fresh milk, with a distinct taste of its own, is a far cry from the packaged varieties delivered at your doorstep. The full-fat treat, however, is not for the figure conscious city slicker.

What you cant have enough of is the calm that surrounds 

the place any time of the day. So let the birds serenade you into a siesta post 

a sumptuous lunch at Sahadebs canteen under one of the straw and wood sheds or 

give in to the stillness of the night under a starlit sky 

How to get there

You can take a train from Howrah to Bolpur. Babli 

arranges for a car pick-up from Bolpur to the farm. Or board any bus for Durgapur 

and alight at Bonovilla stop where the local people will guide you. If you are 

going by car (180 km from Calcutta), take the Kona Expressway to Burdwan and continue 

on the Durgapur Road. Turn off after Panagarh towards Illambazar and continue 

towards Bolpur till Bonovilla, which is 7 km from Illambazar. Turn right on the 

lal matir rasta and drive down half-a-km to Babli

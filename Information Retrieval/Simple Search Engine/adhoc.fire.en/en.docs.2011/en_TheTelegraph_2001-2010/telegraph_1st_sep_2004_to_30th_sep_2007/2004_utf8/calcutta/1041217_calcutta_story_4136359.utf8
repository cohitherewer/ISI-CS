Tradition trail in bridal best

Fashion focus

Smita Roy Chowdhury explores the 

wedding wows for the ongoing season

There should not be any trends in bridal wear. A bride 

looks best in traditional finery,? feels designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee. ?A traditional 

continual aesthetic which can be passed down generations does stand the test of 

time in bridal fashion,? agrees the queen of Indian bridal wear, Ritu Kumar.

This, somewhat, sums up the bridal style story of 

the ongoing wedding season.

While red, red and more red with splashes of orange, 

rust and pink dominate the colour palette, it?s traditional cuts and the vintage 

feel that continue to rule wedding wear for the Indian woman. However, new colours 

have crept into the wedding shade card ? yellow ochre and mehndi green 

? which have found favour in the bridal collections of most designers this season. 

Unusual combinations also seem to have debuted in winter wedding lines.

?While the eternal favourites like red and rust are 

still going strong, this season the palette on the whole, is softer. So, bright 

hues have partly been replaced by tones like pale peachish orange, mehndi, 

olive, tea rose and yellow ochre among others. I have also tried a lot of strange 

mixes in my bridal line,? says Sabyasachi. Traditional cuts are embellished with 

lots of badla, gota and tara work.

Ritu?s collection is resplendent with her repertoire 

of traditional Indian embroidery. The style diva has stayed away from ?plastic 

embellishments? like crystals and sequins and has instead created an antique metallic 

feel with a mixture of dhapka, aari and gota work, combining 

gold and silver to create the ?fabled Ganga Jamuna effect?. There?s also a line 

of traditional lehngas in red with Rajasthani motifs with gota and 

zardosi, while another range boasts ensembles in ochre and peach bandhni 

with butis and her trademark paisley. She has also thrown in colours like 

mehndi green, rose pink, lilac, peach, soft grey and turquoise.

Another designer treading traditional territory is 

Anamika Khanna. Antique Benarasi work, gota and flat coins embellish textured 

fabrics, while bleaching gives a faded, vintage look. ?It is as if the bride is 

wearing her grandmom?s wedding attire,? she says. A new feature here is the diagonal 

lehnga, where the work runs diagonal to the hemline. ?Most brides still 

want to wear red on the final evening, so that?s the dominant colour in my line. 

But for the adventurous, I have used softer hues like pale pink, pistachio and 

ivory,? adds Anamika.

Abhishek Dutta is another designer who is upbeat about 

the new colour story. The Calcutta-based stylist has experimented with strong 

combinations in his bridal line. ?Bright colours combined with dull ones are hot 

now. Tomato red and ochre, mehndi green with a tinge of yellow, or mauve 

with turquoise are some of the mixes I have tried,? he says. 

Young designer Shantanu Goenka has chosen to play 

around with ?English colours? like emerald greens, ruby reds and coral pinks, 

while Jyoti Khaitan has worked with various shades of green (sported by actress 

Koneenica in picture by Aranya Sen).

There is also a fair amount of experimentation with 

styles. Abhishek, for instance, has given traditional lehnga cuts a miss 

in favour of the fish-tail or mermaid look, while the saris see a lot of innovation 

in the pallus. ?The fish-tail look is doing well with brides now. I have 

also designed bridal saris with semi-circular and net pallus. Special four-and-a-half 

metre saris can be draped without pleats to give a fish-tail effect,? he says.

If Abhishek?s focus is firmly on the skirt, Shantanu 

has chosen to give the dupattas a new look. ?I have done lots of draped, 

stitched and buttoned dupattas with ready-to-wear feel. I have also minimised 

volume,? he explains. For the skirts, a contoured look on the hips and waist and 

lots of flare on the hemline is what this designer has dished out. Jyoti has designed 

A-line lehngas. ?These have less volume and are manageable yet elegant, 

for a slimmer look,? she feels.

But fashion, particularly bridal, should be a personal 

statement. ?What is in fashion right now might not be your style. Avoid garments 

that are in today and out tomorrow,? warns Ritu.

 Inside the inner world of love and longing

Name: Antarmahal

Director: Rituparno Ghosh

Star cast: Abhishek Bachchan, Jackie Shroff, 

Soha Ali Khan, Rupa Ganguly and (fleeting appearance) Raima Sen

Storyline: Inspired by a short story by Tarashankar 

Bandyopadhyay, Antarmahal explores the world of a zamindar (Jackie), his 

wives (Rupa and Soha) and a Bihari potter (Abhishek), caught in the cross-currents 

of colonialism, patriarchy and religion.

There is a buzz about town when Rituparno Ghosh gets 

into lights-camera-action mode. With Chokher Bali having run its course 

and Raincoat ready to trail the festival circuit before hitting town, the 

director credited with bringing the best of Bollywood to Tollywood is now busy 

shooting Antarmahal, his first home production.

Reshmi Sengupta strings together some moments 

and images from the makings of a complex inner world.

 Sept 3. Lahabari, off Thanthania Kalibari. Noon.

 The road turning right off Thanthania Kalibari is crammed with cars, policemen and hundreds of onlookers patiently waiting for hours to catch a glimpse of the stars camping inside. ?Abhishek eshechhe, Abhishek eshechhe? is the buzz among the young and the old. At the old iron gates, a tight security sieve lets only a few familiar faces filter in.

 Inside, the sprawling courtyard of the grand brick-red mansion is teeming with people and paraphernalia. The 100-odd crew members are racing against time to get things ready. Add to this chaos the props, camera, light stands, reflectors of all sizes, electricity loops and what not? More clutter on the verandahs ? baskets stashed with flowers, wooden furniture, marble statues. But the wave of nervous excitement rippling through is unmissable.

 It?s dark in here, the lights sharply focussed on a raised bedi where a puja is in progress. A little distance away, director Rituparno Ghosh sits in front of the monitor with his father by his side. ?Mukhta arektu tulun. Hain? byas,? he shouts to one of the purohits on the bedi and signals to his assistant director. The clapstick clicks, the boom bellows ?Silence? action?, and the camera rolls on.

 The first shot of Antarmahal, a tale of love and longing set in 19th Century Bengal, is canned to satisfaction.

 Afternoon. Call time for borobou Rupa, looking regal ? but somewhat possessed ? in a red-bordered white sari, smudged red bindi and lots of jewellery. ?But I want a more chunky necklace for her,? the director tells his unit, as the hair stylist sprays some water on Rupa?s locks for a wet look.

 After a few finishing touches on her make-up ? smudging the kohl around her eyes, dabbing some more vermilion on the parting and a red garland dangling from her neck ? Rupa steps into a palanquin.

 Cinematographer Aveek Mukhopadhyay parks his camera at the palanquin door for a close shot. Ghosh rushes in for a last-minute adjustment, satisfied returns to the monitor. The camera rolls again to capture a few more dramatic moments.

 Sept 5. Lahabari. Noon.

 The lull before the storm, literally. A relatively easy shot is being canned; family and friends of the Laha family line up for a balcony view. Rupa and Raima (here to get her look right before a critical shoot the next day) are in the air-conditioned confines of their makeshift make-up room. Almost imperceptibly, a sensuous draft invades the sultry September air. Rupa has slipped out of her make-up room in a black slip, with a black wrap casually draped over it. ?Eikhane chao to khonpata (This is where you want the bun)?? she asks the director, plonking down in front of him, short hair held up by the scruff to bare her neck. ?A little lower,? advises the man said to be a woman?s director. The lady in black drifts out as suddenly as she had drifted in ? only to reappear in regalia, much later in the day.

 ?Lunch,? cries Ghosh.

 Afternoon

 A storm is lashing the courtyard (thanks to the giant fans) and tossing the saris swinging from the first-floor railings. A flock of ducks and pigeons (the production team bought a bunch of 50 birds) scurries for safety. Braving the wind, some men march in with a painting ? critical to the plot ? under wraps. An almost violent throwback to times long past?

 A shot with a cat and a retainer of the zamindar household is lined up. The job done, the cat springs from the boy?s lap and melts into the crowd. ?Someone catch it immediately. Rituda is scared of cats,? screams a concerned voice.

 Sept 6. Santoshpur stadium. Noon.

 A dramatic shift, in setting and mood. A thatched hut, adjacent to the one that belonged to Aishwarya ?Binodini? Rai in Chokher Bali, is home to Bihari potter Abhishek and his screen-wife Raima.

 In brown phatua and off-white dhoti, Abhishek stands tall, looking relaxed, joking with the unit, picking up Bengali names and words and getting used to rolling his tongue around them (he will, after all, dub his own voice in his mother tongue). He and Raima ? in green sari ? are soon herded into the hut crammed with those calling the shots.

 Bachchan junior takes off the phatua and lies down on the bed. ?Abhishek, turn this side, then turn to your right and pull her to you,? Ghosh explains to his hero before settling down in front of the monitor. Raima, looking tense but stunning, goes through the motions with the director. After a few rehearsals, a call for the final shot.

 Raima, sari and hair dishevelled, gets out of bed. Abhishek tugs at her aanchal and pulls her back towards the bed. Raima, one hand clutching her sari, tumbles on to her man, a Suchitra Sen smile on her face.

 ?Very nice,? says the director, satisfied.

 ?Come and congratulate me, Ritu. Our first shot is done,? pipes up the potter.

 Just outside the hut, the policewomen on duty flock near the makeshift door for a close view of the Bachchan. ?You people always get to see them (the film stars), please let us have a look at him,? whispers one of them to a unit member blocking her view.

 Time for a break.

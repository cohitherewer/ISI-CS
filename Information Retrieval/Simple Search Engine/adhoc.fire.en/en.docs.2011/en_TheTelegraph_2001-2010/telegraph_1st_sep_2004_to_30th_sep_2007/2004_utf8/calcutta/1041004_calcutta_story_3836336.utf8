The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 They did rock us, in Bangla

SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcuttans knew this was the closest they would get to an international rock concert. And they ensured it was an evening to remember.

 Saturday saw an explosion of sorts at the Salt Lake stadium helipad ground as Rock Jugalbandi ? featuring Miles and LRB from Bangladesh, and Chandrabindoo and Cactus from Bengal ? set the crowd on fire. Giant screens, fireworks and ground-shaking music added to the fun.

 Dressing up

 As every rock enthusiast knows, dressing up is an integral part of the concert preparations. The denim and T-shirts were there all right, but so were saris, salwars and even bare bodies aplenty. T-shirts ranged from Linkin Park to Bob Marley, but outnumbering everyone else was Kurt Cobain. This is Calcutta, my love!

 Us and them

 Bandanas, arms waving in rhythm with the music, posters ? Calcuttans did everything to show they were prepared to take on any rock act from any part of the world. Familiar scenes of clambering on to a friend?s shoulder and singing into invisible microphones, diligent display of the ?V? or the two-finger raised rock symbol after every song, were all replayed.

 Girls galore

 A revelation was the presence of a huge number of women, both young and old. While most were school and college gangs on a girls? night out, the boudis and mashimas were also there with their families. A large police contingent helped check any untoward incident despite the obvious adrenaline rush.

 Sound byte

 Organiser estimates pegged ticket sales at 12,000, but with the gates thrown open well into the concert, 8,000 more streamed in. Giant screens beamed live images, fireballs went up during songs and huge balloons burst showering glitter on the crowd. 

The highlight of the evening was Shei Tumi by LRB 

(picture above by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya), which made the crowd sing along and 

praised the city to the October skies. ?Eta amader arekta bari, jotobar dakben 

toto bar ashbo (This is our second home and we?ll come every time you call),? 

shouted frontman Ayub Bachchu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Yesterday moves to tomorrow

Be it the mouth-watering malpoas of Sawan or 

the bright green attire of the ladies to mark the occasion, the bonfires of Lohri 

or the revelry of Chheti Chand (the Sindhi New Year), there?s never a dull moment 

at The Calcutta Punjab Club.

Creating an environment reminiscent of the spry spirits 

?back home? has always been the raison d?etre of the institution ever since it 

was born out of a Punjabi peeve during the turbulent times of 1938. Upset at being 

thwarted at the portals of the British-run ?sahibs-only? city clubs, leading lights 

of Calcutta?s Punjabi community got together to set up their own rendezvous point.

Conceived by the likes of Col Sir Ram Nath Chopra, 

director, School of Tropical Medicine, Rai Bahadur M.S. Oberoi of the Oberoi Group, 

Rai Bahadur Karam Chand Thapar of the Thapar Group, philanthropist Nandlall Puri 

and transport king R.K. Jaidka, The Punjab Club had a modest beginning at Woodburn 

Park. Later, it was shifted to the crossing of Camac Street and Lower Circular 

Road, before eventually settling down at 21, Ballygunge Circular Road.

?We are the only club in the country built by the 

Punjabis and run by Punjabis and Sindhis. Unlike other city clubs, which follow 

the British calendar, the major events at Punjab Club are the popular festivals 

of our community,? says club president Satish Kumar Kapoor.

While upholding traditional values and customs, the 

club is keen to move with the times. ?Food has always been one of our USPs and 

we are adding a new 46-seater restaurant (Jharokha) soon, serving exclusive North 

Indian food,? says the president.

A contemporary business lounge is also set for a pre-Puja 

launch, while a squash court will be in place within a year, promises secretary 

Sanjay Lamba. The existing infrastructure for the 2,400-odd members includes a 

swimming pool, three dining rooms, banquets, two bars, billiards room, table tennis 

room, cyber caf? and 10 air-conditioned guestrooms.

?We have to create more points of interest for our 

young members and much of our future plans are geared towards that end,? offers 

Kapoor. The tunes of the changing times are already reverberating in the corridors 

of the 42-cottah campus, as footfall at the Friday Club Nites keeps swelling by 

the week. Events like the Shaan Nite on Sawan (picture left) are always sold out 

and the club management is considering having more disco evenings.

?Over the years, the atmosphere at Punjab Club has 

always been one of relaxed camaraderie, with an extremely active ladies? wing. 

Today?s youngsters want to have fun and they have the spending power. So we must 

find ways to address their wishes,? observes Dharmendra Berry, frequenting the 

city?s Punjabi hub for the past 15 years.

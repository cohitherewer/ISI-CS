 Deaths fail to upgrade facilities

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An alternative power supply line is the least it lacks. 

 The BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children is much the same at it was two years ago, when 12 crib deaths within 72 hours forced the government to effect a few cosmetic changes. 

 The super-speciality referral hospital for children still does not have an emergency observation room, emergency medical officers, anti-venom serums, a dialysis unit and emergency surgical facilities. 

 And manning the emergency ward, where more then 250 patients turn up every day, are a handful of doctors. 

 In the absence of an observation room, mandatory in government hospitals, the authorities have no option but to admit even those patients who do not require prolonged treatment.

 ?Had there been an emergency observation room, several indoor patients could have been released after a day?s treatment,? said a senior doctor at BC Roy.

 Left with no choice, the hospital admits patients far exceeding the capacity. At present, 400 patients are being treated in various wards of the 250-bed hospitals. Result: three kids are often cramped on one bed.

 ?It?s true that we run a 90 per cent risk of cross-infection. But do we have a choice?? asked a doctor. Despite the government?s promise of more funds to increase the number of beds, nothing has trickled in, he added.

 Two years after the tragedy, the authorities are still pleading with the health department for life-support gadgets, but in vain. Had the gadgets been available, doctors said, the mortality rate could have been curbed.

 ?Even on Wednesday, I asked the government to send us more equipment,? said superintendent Mrinal Chatterjee. The hospital desperately requires four ventilators, but it has none. The authorities had asked for some incubators. They were, instead, supplied with radiant warmers. 

 Justifying the decision, director of medical education C.R. Maiti said: ?Incubators are obsolete. Radiant warmers can serve the purpose much better in our climate.? 

 He, however, held out the assurance that the government was considering the hospital?s list of requirements. 

 The hospital also requires a blood gas analyser and at least two more neo-natal care units to cope with the increasing number of patients.

 Between 13,000 and 16,000 patients are admitted to the hospital in a year. The annual turnout at the out-patients? department is around 300,000 and at the emergency ward, 30,000-35,000. 

Damages suit: A public interest litigation 

was filed in Calcutta High Court on Wednesday, demanding setting up of a high-powered 

committee to probe the deaths of three babies at BC Roy Hospital on Monday and 

payment of Rs 3 lakh each to the bereaved families as compensation.

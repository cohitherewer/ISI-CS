Md. Amiruzzaman: We often hear that pensioners are harassed by your officials when they come here with their problems.

 I wont deny such incidents. But the number of such complaints have come down drastically. What is required is a change in the mindset of the officials. I have enough hands to cope with the workload, and the situation is improving fast. The officials need to be customer-friendly and shun their bureaucratic attitude. The change cannot take place overnight. Those who suffer at the hands of the officials must come to me directly with their complaints.

 Delhi guest list for library

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam are likely to visit the National Library within the next six months.

 While the Prime Minister will inaugurate the newly-constructed Bhasha Bhavan around mid-November, Kalam is tentatively scheduled to visit the library in February to unveil a full-size bronze statue of Rabindranath Tagore. 

 The new building, constructed at a cost of about Rs 80 crore, will accommodate 2.5 million books and journals, now stored in a number of old buildings of the library.

 National Library?s newly-appointed director Subhendu Mandal said on Friday that the Prime Minister?s secretariat had conveyed to him about Singh being able to visit the library in mid-November.

 The Bhasha Bhavan foundation stone was laid by Rajiv Gandhi in 1990. The construction cost was estimated at Rs 42 crore at that time. But the 14 years it took to come up pushed the cost to Rs 80 crore.

 The four-storeyed Bhavan has a floor area of 40,000 sq m. There is an auditorium that can seat 600 people. Moreover, there are two seminar halls, each of which can accommodate 80 persons. The building is centrally air-conditioned. 

 The giant reading room has the capacity for 1,500 visitors at a time, director Mandal elaborated. 

 There will be separate reading corners for senior citizens at Bhasha Bhavan.

 The present reading room at the original building of the library has the capacity for 350 visitors at a time. 

 Mandal said President Kalam will visit the library in February to unveil a bronze statue of Tagore, now being sculpted in the studios of Kala Bhavan, at Visva-Bharati.

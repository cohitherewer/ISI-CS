 Chit Chat

Dog trouble 

His name is Christopher John Francis Boone and he?s 

15 years old. He has a photographic memory and loves math and science. But when 

it comes to people, he doesn?t even know what the different expressions on their 

faces mean. He loves dogs though, and when his neighbour?s poodle dies, he decides 

to write a murder mystery about it ? that?s the only kind of book Christopher 

likes. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is the winner of the 

Guardian Children?s Fiction Prize and Booktrust Teenage Fiction Award, 

as well as the Whitbread Book of the Year for good reason. Mark Haddon takes the 

reader on a roller-coaster ride into the mind of a confused teenager, which wanders 

off on fascinating tangents as he attempts to find the killer. All is not what 

it seems...

Fight for peace 

Imagine one day in the year when the whole world joins 

hands for the sake of peace. While that might be a distant dream, 98 countries 

took part in the International Day of Peace celebrations last year. This time, 

the aim is to get one billion people to share in the spirit of peace on September 

21, the 22nd annual event. As part of the effort, the United Nations has called 

for a Global Ceasefire and organised a 24-hour Vigil for Peace, asking everybody 

to get together in temples or mosques, community halls or friends? homes, to support 

non-violence. Also, the global Proclamation for Peace campaign is being conducted 

at local, state, national and international levels, while the youth can do their 

bit by inspiring those around them with the simple Peace Pledge and promoting 

cultural harmony.

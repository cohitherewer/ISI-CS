The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Our city, forever in their focus

Eye on Calcutta 

Renu Roy

Down the years, Calcutta has provided Mumbai film-makers 

with both literary inspiration and address for camera action

 Celluloid saga: (From top)Yuva; Sahib 

Bibi aur Ghulam; Parineeta

Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s latest tirade against our beloved 

city during the shooting of his Parineeta may certainly have hurt many 

of us. 

True, we are not perfect. True, yawning gaps remain 

for our work culture to improve. True, Mumbai has a different way of doing things, 

and ours may not necessarily be to the satisfaction of others. Even if we agree 

to all that Chopra accuses us of, I am left with that sneaky question. Why was 

he here in the first place? 

The answer is obvious. After Devdas, Calcutta 

and Sarat Chandra sell, and in an industry which is ruled by the inexorable law 

of success, and everybody runs in the pack, Parineeta seems almost inevitable. 

And this is not the first time that Calcutta has made money for Bollywood.

I am not a film historian, and I do not wish to burden 

you with chronology, but if you have followed Bollywood long enough, even casually, 

you will know that Calcutta and Bengal have returned again and again to the Hindi 

screen. It probably started with the Bengalis who found their place behind the 

camera, and who influenced Bollywood decisions without the public ever knowing 

their names. 

Bengalis like producer-director Himangshu Ray, his 

actress wife Devika Rani (later Roerich) and his scriptwriter Niranjan Pal had 

arrived there even during the silent era.

The presence of Sasadhar Mukherjee and brothers, Bimal 

Roy and team, and even the Calcutta born-and-brought-up Guru Dutt (Padukone) brought 

a significant amount of Bengali influence into Bollywood from its earliest days. 

And Calcutta, with its dramatic ambience, became the location of many Hindi film 

classics. 

One of the greatest films in that category, that continues 

to haunt one generation of film viewers after another, is Saheb Bibi aur Ghulam 

? a tale that has survived with its magic and charisma even after the unhappy 

television reincarnation recently. 

The glitz, glamour and scandals of the 19th century 

Calcutta of the babus held audience attention firmly, while Meena Kumari 

left us with one of the most memorable performances in the history of the Indian 

screen. The horse-drawn carriages, the fighting pigeons, the dark, brooding romance, 

the singing and dancing courtesans are all part of a delightfully decadent Calcutta, 

with intriguing skeletons popping out of its mysterious cupboards. 

Apart from exceptions like an Umrao Jaan, Bollywood 

could do nothing similar with the Nawabs of Oudh, even though their language is 

the same as the language of Hindi cinema.

Calcutta, despite all that its detractors may have 

to say, must have its own sense of mystery that Bollywood has been attracted to 

through the ages. Always on the lookout for the dramatic, and the musical, our 

city, with its strange history, myriad moods, and exceptional melodic talents 

has captured Bollywood?s attention, in its search for the unusual, yet recognisable. 

I am told that another Bollywood classic, based on the Tarashankar story, and 

scripted by our great dramatist Bijon Bhattacharya, had such a long run in faraway 

Lahore, that the theatre had to be re-christened Nagin. 

The black-and-white days of Bollywood saw many more 

stories located in Calcutta, including one named after our most famous landmark, 

Howrah Bridge. Of course, its maker was from Bengal, and though he achieved success 

and fame with frivolities like Kashmir Ki Kali, Shakti Samanta will always 

be remembered for his later magnum opus Amar Prem. Which lover of Bollywood 

can forget the twinkling lights of our beloved city seen by night, seen from the 

swaying distance of the rippling currents from a pleasure boat on the river. Chingari 

koyi bharke to saawan usey bujhaye, Saawan jo agan lagaaye, usay kaun bujhaye 

is a song that belongs to us, to Calcutta, wherever in the world it may have been 

recorded.

Guru Dutt was more Bengali than many Bengalis, and 

his work remains as a testament to his deep spiritual and intellectual linkages 

with the city which he always considered his own. Apart from Saheb, Bibi Aur 

Ghulam where the story was located in Calcutta, Guru Dutt returned to his 

beloved city for Pyaasa. He knew it so well that he did not need to come 

back here to shoot, but could re-create it faithfully in Nataraj Studios in Andheri, 

including Beadon Square, the park on the fringes of our famous red-light district 

immortalised in the Johnny Walker song. Sun sun sun, arey beta soon, is champi 

mey badey badey gun, lakh dukhon ki ek dawa hai kyuna azmaaye is an invitation 

that can belong to Calcutta alone. 

At the end of the film, when the courtesan asks the 

poet where he will take her, it is again about the city. Kahin door chalen?

Just to prove that Calcutta is not only about the 

past, we have films like Sudhir Mishra?s Calcutta Mail and Mani Ratnam?s 

Yuva, that explore the tortuous present. While it is easy to dismiss Calcutta 

as an archaic locale that remains as the convoluted symbol of the dying past, 

in terms of tone and temper, of sound and images it provides tremendous inputs 

for thrillers. The here and now comes through with dark and intriguing undertones 

that few other cities in India can provide. Like Dickensian London, the very presence 

of the city gives the story character. At one time, Vienna provided an almost 

similar locale for Hollywood thrillers. 

Unfortunately for us, neither Sudhir Mishra?s film 

nor Mani Ratnam?s has done well in the box-office. If it had, there would be more 

happening here. Despite whatever he said, we in Calcutta will keep wishing the 

very best for Chopra?s Parineeta. Of course, we do have a vested interest.

Bollywood?s romance with Calcutta will probably never 

end, because it is a romance that film-makers from other corners of the country 

have begun to share. 

Mani Ratnam brought Kamal Hassan to Calcutta a few 

years ago to make a major film in Tamil, and it served as preparation for the 

great sequence that the southern star returned to shoot for Hey Ram. Calcutta 

must have left deep impressions in their minds, because Mani Ratnam, too, came 

back to shoot Yuva here. 

The turbulent and deeply chaotic experience that our 

city leaves in the minds of its sensitive viewers manifests itself in their artistic 

work again and again. There is something about Calcutta that lures them back. 

The city will feature prominently once again as Meera 

Nair begins to shoot Jhumpa Lahiri?s Namesake early next year. I was not 

surprised when Dominique Lapierrre came here to write his big novel and I am not 

surprised now, when I hear that Gunter Grass is expected back soon. 

I will not be surprised even if I hear soon that Vidhu 

Vinod Chopra is returning to Calcutta to make another film. It would seem almost 

inevitable.

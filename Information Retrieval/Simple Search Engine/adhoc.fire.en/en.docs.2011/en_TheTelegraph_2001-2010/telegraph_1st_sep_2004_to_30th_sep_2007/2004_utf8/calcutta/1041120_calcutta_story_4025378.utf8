 Traffic dispersal master plan for Bypass fairground

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A comprehensive traffic management plan is on the cards to prevent the Park Circus connector to the EM Bypass from turning into a motorist?s nightmare, once the permanent fairground near Chingrihata is opened.

 Senior officials met at Writers? Buildings on Friday to work out a formula to ensure unhindered traffic flow between Bridge No. 4 (Park Circus) and Ultadanga, via Parama island. 

 ?We?ve discussed a sound, long-term traffic arrangement in the area. If plans are not chalked out immediately, dispersal will be a big problem during fairs at the permanent venue,? commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said after the meeting. 

 Apart from Sen, those who attended the meeting included home secretary Amit Kiran Deb, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) chief executive officer Alapan Bandyopadhyay and representatives of the traffic police and the South 24-Parganas administration. 

 The meeting resolved that that the CMDA will prepare a ?concept paper on the traffic plan of the EM Bypass, near Science City and the Park Circus area?. 

 A monitoring committee will be set up with representatives of the traffic department, commerce and industries department and the South 24-Parganas administration. 

 The main issues to be addressed are: 

Ensuring unhindered flow between Bridge No. 4 and Ultadanga, past Parama island

Identifying locations for bus stops, terminuses and parking lots

Identifying plots for parking private cars and taxis during fairs

Building infrastructure for quick dispersal of crowd. 

 The concept paper is to be submitted within 15 days. 

 Traffic planners have already started reworking road space from the Park Circus connector to the Bypass. 

 The authorities are considering building a flyover from Bridge No. 4 to Chingrihata.

 ?Dispersal is our primary concern, as there is no major mode of mass transport on this stretch. Bus stops like Ultadanga and Bridge No. 4 are quite a distance from the fairground,? pointed out an official present at the meeting. 

 According to industries secretary Sen, no decision was taken on Friday for the fairs that may be held off the Bypass this winter. 

 ?The short-term measures can be discussed later,? he asserted. 

 At least 7,000 vehicles pass this stretch of the Bypass in the morning and evening. Officials expect the figure will climb four-fold during a major fair. And with over 100,000 people attending a big fair, nothing less than ?chaos? will prevail at the Parama island.

 Jewellery jostle just right

 A hint of the yellow metal, the 

 sparkle of a white rock, the lustre of precious pearls. 

 With a mix and match of all three, a woman?s accessory kit 

 can?t possibly get better this festive season. Here?s a 

 look at some new collections on offer.

 A fine fusion of the modern and the traditional in gold, kundan and diamonds is the offering from Tanishq, the jewellery brand from the Tata stable. From Rs 2,000 to Rs 1 lakh-plus, there are nine different ranges to flaunt from dawn to dusk. ?There?s a lot to choose from? I can wear them to work and also to parties at night,? gushed actress Soha Ali Khan, after unveiling the Tanishq collection.

 Exquisite pieces embellished with South Sea pearls from the shores of Tahiti, Philippines, Indonesia, Australia and Japan add up to the festive fare from Diagold. The new line launched by the Metro Plaza outlet displays dressy earrings and smart pendants in diamonds and pearls in shades of white, cream, pink, black and bluish grey. ?I prefer pearls to diamonds because they have more class and are fit to be worn for all occasions,? said TV star Chandrayee, at the launch.

 Rock solid

 The white rock is a girl?s best friend and her chosen gem for this season too, affirm buying trends. ?People are preferring more diamonds than gold this season. Our Mystique range has a wide array of ornaments with a solitaire encrusted on them. The price soars to Rs 1 lakh and more,? says Dwaipayan Sen, regional business manager, east, Tanishq. The Aamra range is a fine blend of diamonds and gold in mango motifs, while Italia has the rocks set in gold with a dominant Mediterranean influence.

 Gold rush

 ?Women are going more for plain designs that can go with all kinds of dresses. So, our focus is on light jewellery. The Daisy collection of pendants and earrings in pastel shades are between Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000, something they can wear both with saris and salwar kurtas,? adds Sen. The other slick and chic range is Ivy, using the twists and turns of the creeper to best effect.

 Aarka features both heavy and light jewellery between Rs 20,000 and Rs 40,000, while Noor is for those preferring heavy kundan work and ready to pick a bill of around Rs 1 lakh. The rusticity and rawness of tribal jewellery is highlighted in the Ebony range with filigree and sheet work, and the Primals collection shows off bold animal patterns.

 Dew drops

 The charm of these pearls, cultured in oysters from South Sea, lies in the play of light. Set off in white and yellow gold, and silver, their shapes vary from baroque to oval and round. ?The South Sea pearls are much larger than the others and have an enviable lustre,? says Varda Goenka of Diagold.

 Earrings and neckpieces are adorned with diamonds and pearls of white, cream, pink and grey shades. The creations are priced at Rs 10,000 onwards. The most famous ones, by far, are the black pearls of Tahiti. 

 Dreams and digital divide

 It?s that time of the year when the DVs and Mini DVs get more mileage than the 16 mms and 35 mms in the world of cinema. When creativity on canvas scores over commerce. When the Aveek Mukhopadhyays come out of the Antarmahals to capture their own dreams.

 The 0110 Indo-British Digital Film Festival, organised by the British Council, kicks off on Monday at Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre with veteran film writer and enthusiast Father Gaston Roberge inaugurating this year?s edition.

 The festival comprises 69 digital video and mini digital video films from India, Pakistan, Nepal and the UK. The films have been further classified into separate groups based on their genres (only just). Apart from the opening films, the others have been divided into DV Experimenta, Reality DV, Self-Centred, Vox Populi, The Long and Short of It and Caf? Films.

 The five films chosen from the city include Aveek Mukhopadhyay?s 96-second-long Glich which ?blends images of horror using new and old technologies, analogue and digital? and Sanjeet Chowdhury?s nine-minute Interpersonality about a cyber romance between a 21-year-old boy and a 42-year-old bank clerk. Abhijit Gupta?s The Third Schedule uses less than four minutes to put forth his satirical take on Indian politicians while Nilanjan Bhattacharya visualises sensory responses during the act of drowning in The Dark Faces of Drowning. Qaushiq?s Le Pocha is 57 minutes of contemporary alternative music from Bengal.

 Other films include Sohini Ghosh?s Tales of the Night Fairies, a nuanced human tale of Calcutta?s sex-workers. Then there?s the opening film, Marc Craste?s Jo-Jo in the Stars, an unlikely love story between a trapeze artiste and a nameless hero who worships her. Vinay Sitapati?s Vox Populi inspects India?s image through the eyes of Pakistanis.

 Koneenica: SMSing her 

 way to stardom

 She?s anxious about her new film 

 and is busy SMSing promo messages to friends. But the response 

 from a crowd desperate to catch a glimpse of Koneenica Banerjee 

 at Colours of India in City Centre must have put her at 

 ease. ?I think the audiences have accepted me,? chirped 

 the heroine of Aabar Ashbo Phirey, sporting silver 

 eye make-up and a pair of slick sunglasses while checking 

 out the chikan work. Picture by Rashbehari Das

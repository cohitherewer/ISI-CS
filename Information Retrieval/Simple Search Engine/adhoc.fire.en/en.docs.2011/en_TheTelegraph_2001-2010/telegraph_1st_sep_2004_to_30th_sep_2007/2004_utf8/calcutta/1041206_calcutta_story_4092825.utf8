 They are a group of seven. Trendy youngsters between 19 and 24. Students of new-age subjects like media and graphics. Who study, binge on junk food and treat life as one big party. 

 But they are also an inspired lot on a special mission. So while their friends in other colleges party wild during the year-end bashes, Rohini, Kanika, Deep, Ayudh, Rohan, Shriddhi and Priyanka of Wigan and Leigh College will carry out HIV-AIDS awareness workshops. 

 This group had been enthusiastic participants at the awareness workshop organised by Thoughtshop Foundation in early November, as part of the Youth Awards project, which aims at creating groups of aware, conscious youngsters to spread the good word around.

 ?On December 1, World AIDS Day, we held an interactive workshop with over 20 students of our college. Though as a totally urban group, we were aware about the dangers of AIDS, the Thoughtshop workshop helped clear a lot of foggy areas,? said Rohini. 

 Another bunch of youngsters ready to make an early start on the HIV-AIDS awareness run belongs to Vidyasagar School of Social Work. Soon after, Thoughtshop Foundation took a workshop with the students in November, one group planned a cultural programme on the Nandan compound on World AIDS Day. Another has decided to keep aside every Tuesday till February for holding one HIV-AIDS awareness?related programme in one or the other school college, office, institute or club.

 Himalini Verma of Thoughtshop said: ?In all our 13 workshops at Jadavpur University, St Xavier?s College, Baruipur College, and other places, we have received an overwhelming response.? 

 More than two groups have been formed by under-privileged youngsters at a Lutheran World Services centre near the airport. ?One of them has even decided upon a play on HIV-AIDS awareness, that they plan to take to various venues during their own workshops,? added Himalini. ?To work for the Youth Awards, the groups still have time till February. They are warming up with their projects now, improvising on our techniques and developing their own.?

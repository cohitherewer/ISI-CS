 Foul fruit rage on roads

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Lack of co-ordination between the health and conservancy departments of the civic body has turned the city into a haven for vendors selling contaminated cut fruits and sherbets during the Ramazan month.

 According to an estimate by the civic body, over 200 quintals of cut fruits and one lakh litres of sherbets are sold from the pavements daily during the Ramazan month. Doctors in the civic health department said contaminated cut fruits and sherbets are responsible for hepatitis, typhoid, enteric diseases and diarrhoea.

 Member mayor-in-council (MMIC), health, Pradip Ghosh blamed the state government for the state of affairs. He said the civic health department has been functioning without an adequate number of food inspectors for about a year, since the state health department has not yet approved the appointment of 29 food inspectors, made in December 2003.

 CPM leader of the opposition in the civic body, Nirmal Mukherjee, and most of the Trinamul Congress councillors, however, pointed out that food inspectors are not necessary for undertaking drives against cut fruit vendors. 

 ?When I was in charge of the conservancy department, I undertook a drive and seized eight truck loads of cut fruits from the vendors,? said former MMIC (conservancy) Mala Roy.

 ?Civic inspectors never collect samples from vendors, for no case can be filed against them as they run their business without a licence. Cut fruits are, instead, destroyed by spraying bleaching powder on them,? said former MMIC, health, Javed Ahmed Khan. 

 ?The health department has never asked us to launch a drive against cut fruit vendors,? claimed MMIC, conservancy, Rajib Deb.

 State health officials said the department?s main reservation against granting approval to the appointments of the 29 food inspectors was that they were under-qualified. The new recruits are ignorant of the proper method of collecting samples and lack the expertise to identify suspicious food items, they said.

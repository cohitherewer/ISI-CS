 Good parenting essential for tackling precocious 

puberty

After noticing a rise in precocious puberty, city-based co-educational English-medium schools have lined up a chain of seminars and interactive sessions between mothers of girl students and doctors, especially gynaecologists, to educate them on ways of dealing with wards who show such signs.

 With doctors stressing that such advanced adolescence can lead to many complex problems, including abuse, particularly among girls, the trend has caused more concern to the authorities of such co-educational schools where boys and girls enjoy more freedom to mix with members of the opposite sex from an early age.

 When they reopen after Christmas holidays, the authorities of many schools will engage doctors, including gynaecologists, who will sit with mothers of girls studying between Classes III and XII and discuss with them issues like handling children undergoing adolescent changes.

 First among the notable Anglo-Indian schools, where preparations for such exchanges are almost complete, is the St Augustine Day School group.

 ?We are worried with reports of girl students experiencing early puberty pouring in from our junior classes. Since ours is a co-educational institution, it is now our top priority to attend to this problem in a suitable way,? C.R.Gasper, principal of St Augustine Day School on Ripon Street, said.

 In mid-January, the school will organise a series of meetings with mothers, attended by at least four doctors, including women gynaecologists. They will discuss in detail the reasons behind the abnormality.

 ?Boys,too, are experiencing the same problem. But we want to handle the girls? problems first, because the risk of early puberty is not just responsible for exposing little girls to the threat of abuse. It can also lead to emotional problems. We need to start counselling mothers of girl students with immediate effect, as good parenting is most essential for handling these girls,? said L.M. Henry, a doctor who will be attending the Anglo-Indian school meetings with mothers next month.

 ?We will give tips to mothers on little things, like how their daughters should dress, walk, behave and talk or interact with members of the opposite sex once they experience advanced puberty,? she added. 

 The lectures will be delivered in groups of about 45 to 50 mothers in a single session. Those unable to interact in English will be given written handouts with all the necessary information. Other co-educational institutions, where similar efforts are on to fight the problem, are the St Thomas group of schools, Albany Hall Public School, Grace Ling Liang English School and Julien Day School.

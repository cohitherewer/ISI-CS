 Researchers on par with state lecturers

 - Scholarships up Rs 8,000 a month 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bowing to pressure from research scholars of Calcutta, Jadavpur and Rabindra Bharati universities, who have been asking for scholarships on a par with the salaries of university lecturers, the state government is working on a proposal to enhance their scholarship. 

 If implemented, more than 300 government-sponsored research scholars of various universities will get enhanced scholarships at a minimum of Rs 8,000 a month, instead of Rs 5,000 a month. 

 ?Responding to a long- standing demand from research scholars, we have discussed the matter threadbare with officials from the finance department,? a senior official of the higher education department said. 

 ?An official order on payment of the enhanced scholarships will be issued once the department concerned forwards its approval,? he added.

 Faced with the demand from research scholars, the universities have appealed to the state government seeking additional funds.

 ?Research activity is the main function of a university and it cannot be carried out smoothly without the help of research scholars,? an official of Calcutta University said.

 ?We have written to the state government and requested its officials to consider the demand of the scholars. We will start paying the enhanced scholarships as soon as we get the nod from the state government,? said Joydeep Sil, estate and trust officer of Calcutta University.

 For the past three years, research scholars of different universities have been agitating against the state government?s refusal to make an upward revision of the scholarship, ?ignoring? a Supreme Court ruling. 

 The apex court had ordered that the University Grants Commission (UGC) and all state governments provide scholarships to researchers on a par with the salaries of university lecturers.

 According to officials, each of the universities in Calcutta, as well as in the districts, have two categories of research scholars. 

 The UGC and the state government sponsor 300 scholars each. 

 In keeping with the Supreme Court directive, the UGC enhanced the scholarships for its nearly 300 researchers three years ago, at the rate of minimum Rs 8,000 per month. 

 But the state-sponsored scholars in various universities in Calcutta and elsewhere are still getting scholarships at the old rate.

 Yet, the educational and other qualifications required for candidates joining the universities as research scholars are the same as those opting for the lectureship. 

 ?Why should the state government deprive us of our legitimate claims?? asked a research scholar of Calcutta University, availing of the state-sponsored scholarship.

 The scholars pointed out that, for example, it is imperative for every candidate to clear the state-level eligibility test (SLET) or national eligibility test (NET) for joining as a lecturer in any university. 

 It is also compulsory for candidates aspiring to work as research scholars in any university to clear SLET or NET.

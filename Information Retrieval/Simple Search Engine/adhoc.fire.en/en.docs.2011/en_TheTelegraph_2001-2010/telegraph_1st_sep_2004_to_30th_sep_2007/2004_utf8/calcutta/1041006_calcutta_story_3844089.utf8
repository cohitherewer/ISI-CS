 Secretary, West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners? and Operators? Association

 We take 50 persons in the vehicles we run. While schoolchildren are picked up from two or three localities, office-goers are picked up along the specific route on which the bus plies. This, of course, lowers the vehicle count on the streets, while providing people the same comfort as in a private car or taxi. For a vehicle to operate on a commercial basis, a contract carriage permit has to be taken out on payment of Rs 9,000. Moreover, a quarterly tax has to be paid on the basis of the number of passengers to be carried in the vehicle. An additional annual tax of Rs 7,000 is also levied. A contract carriage can ply only on the route for which the permit has been taken. So, it is questionable if it is at all viable for a motor car to run on a commercial basis as a pool car. Ninety-nine per cent of the pool cars are running illegally, as they do not have the requisite permit. All they pay is the tax for private vehicles. This has to be stopped.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Island travel task force

 BARUN GHOSH

 Long wait. Uncertainty over sailing time. Unavailability of confirmed return tickets. Such ordeals for Port Blair-bound passengers may finally come to an end.

 For the first time, the state government has taken an initiative to address the myriad problems tourists and ordinary passengers face while sailing to and from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 ?A visit to the dream island by ship is nothing short of a nightmare. Erratic sailing time costs the business community as well tourists dear,? state housing minister Goutam Deb said on Monday.

 ?We had convened a meeting on Saturday at Raj Bhavan with the Andaman?s lieutenant-governor Ram Kapse and senior officials of the administration there,? he added. 

 A four-member task force, with transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury as convener, has been set up to look into the passengers? grievances and suggest ways to improve the transit services. 

 Besides Deb, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, Calcutta Port Trust chairman Anup Chanda and Shipping Corporation of India (SCI)?s Debashish Basu were among those present at the meeting.

 According to SCI officials, a ship from Calcutta is supposed to sail for three days and reach Port Blair in the morning of the fourth. But it is often delayed by eight to 10 hours, mainly because of the unnavigable 260-km stretch between the port and the Sandheads.

 ?This is one problem over which we have no control,? said SCI?s Debashish Basu. 

 Besides, though the SCI tries to arrange for three to four sailings to Port Blair per month, lack of enough passengers often forces the authorities to defer the sailing date of a ship. ?In fact, except during summer vacation or a festive season, ships carry passengers far less than capacity,? an official explained.

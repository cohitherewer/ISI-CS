The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The Rabindra Sarobar area was in a terrible mess during the recent Chhat puja. 

Thousands of devotees burst crackers by the waterbody causing both sound and water 

pollution. Over the years, the number of migratory birds settling in the Sarobar 

area during winter has come down. If no action is taken against the rising pollution 

levels, the bird count will further decrease. I request the authorities to prohibit 

bursting of noisy crackers and playing of loud music near the Lake. A limited 

number of persons should be allowed to perform puja rituals (that too quietly) 

there. We must try to provide a comfortable stay at the Sarobar for our feathered 

winter guests.

 Of late, it has been noticed that the ATMs at ICICI Bank?s Gurusaday Road and 

Elgin Road branches are frequently malfunctioning. It causes much inconvenience 

to the customers. A reputed bank like ICICI should ensure that such anomalies 

are avoided.

 Some months ago, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation spent a lot of money and 

time to beautify Park Street?s footpaths. It was a commendable effort. Recently, 

the pavements were dug up (perhaps by public utilities like CESC or CalTel). But 

later, the pavement was not restored to its original condition. In addition to 

this, two-wheelers illegally parked on the footpath often destroy the newly-planted 

saplings. I think it is high time that the authorities take stern action against 

the offenders as well as the police officers who are turning a blind eye to the 

practice. The illegally-parked vehicles should be impounded.

 My article ?Gimmicks for the gullible? published in this column on November 

22 had the desired effect. I received two phone calls from M/s Khosla Electronics 

informing me that the promised free gift had arrived. They even delivered the 

gift at my residence later in the day.

 I was asked to pay Rs 331 for an Excel (CellOne pre-paid) card despite the 

printed MRP being Rs 300. The shop owner assured me that I would get more calltime. 

CalTel should instruct these cash card dealers to provide a receipt during such 

transition phases after the price of cash cards is changed.

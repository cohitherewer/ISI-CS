After the runaway success of the Pop Idol and American Idol in the UK and the US, its time for India to jump on the pop star hunt bandwagon. A star-studded launch was held at Taj Bengal on Tuesday to ensure the Indian Idol juggernaut rolls smoothly through the city. The Calcutta auditions take off at the Bhawanipur Gujarat Education Society on Wednesday.

 Shining in the spotlight: Sony Entertainment Television is bringing the show to the country and Tarun Katial, executive vice president, programming and response, introduced the game show format and the procedure for elimination.

 What will really work for the show here in India is the hardcore emotion associated with the contest, Katial said. After all, becoming an Indian Idol means instant stardom, a recording contract with a leading music company and a contract with Sony worth Rs 1 crore.

 Candid compere: Aman Verma, who is to co-host the show alongside Mini Mathur, was present too. Excited about being in Calcutta for the auditions over the next five days, he was hopeful of tapping some great talent here. We have a lot of expectations from this city. It should be a whole lot of fun.

 On a more personal front, Aman seems unflustered about balancing his own big and small screen commitments. I dont see why I should leave one medium to accommodate the other. I give producers my dates and leave it to them.

 Fair Farah: After introducing the three judges Anu Malik, Sonu Nigam and Farah Khan through the audio-visual clips on screen, Aman invited Farah on stage. Looking as pretty as some of the Bollywood actresses she choreographs, Farah was her usual bindaas self.

 I have been a great fan of both Pop Idol and American Idol and I have followed all the seasons. When I was asked to judge this Indian avatar I said yes right away, she gushed. Its another matter that my mom had said, If you dont do this, I am going to kick you out of the house, she joked.

 Farah hopes the platform will be used to discover a real new talent. Many of us have had to struggle so hard to make it. There are still many good actors and singers who havent been able to show their skills. I hope everyone makes the most of this opportunity with the whole world watching And theres obviously a lot of money at stake too.

 The Main Hoon Na director also had a word of advice for the prospective participants. Its not everyday that you get to perform in front of the likes of Anu Malik and Sonu Nigam. Dont try and sing a song that Sonu has sung or Anu has composed or I have choreographed just to impress us. Sing that one number that you are most at home with.

 Our idol: After the formulae and formalities, the special guest for the day was called up on stage Calcuttas very own singing idol Usha Uthup. 

 As she was felicitated by Aman, Usha broke into song. I believe in music, I believe in love, she sang. With everyone on an emotional high, Farah made a public commitment to the songstress: Usha is singing in my next film.

 Usha, for her part, shared a bit of philosophy with the audience: Despite singing for all these 35 years, I have never felt like rewinding time because I have always believed that the most wonderful time is now.

 One Indian Idol may soon be able to agree.

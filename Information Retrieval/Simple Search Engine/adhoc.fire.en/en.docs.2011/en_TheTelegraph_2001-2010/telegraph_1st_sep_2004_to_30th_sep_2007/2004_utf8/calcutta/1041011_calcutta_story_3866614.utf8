The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rain pushes up prices

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If you are already paying high prices for your daily veggies, be prepared to pay even more this Puja and post-Puja. 

 It is official that the prices of cauliflower, cabbage, tomato, chilli and brinjal, among other greens, will shoot up as a fallout of the incessant rain in September-end and the showers through last week. 

 Torrential rain last week flooded Calcutta and districts of south Bengal, like North 24-Parganas, South 24- Parganas and Nadia, which supply city markets with vegetables. 

 ?A price hike is feared because there will not be an abundant supply of vegetables during the Pujas, and this is likely to continue for the next 10 days,? said Dhabaleswar Konar, director of agriculture, on Sunday.

 A loss of Rs 270 crore-worth of crops, mostly vegetables, was estimated as a result of the flood-like situation in September-end. ?This had already created a situation where a price hike of vegetables was feared,? he said. 

 Torrential showers last week made the situation worse, as more crops were damaged. Officials from all over the state have been asked to attend an emergency meeting at Writers? Buildings on Monday, where losses caused in the recent rains will be analysed.

 ?The damage caused will automatically have an impact on the market in Calcutta during the Pujas, and even winter vegetables will arrive late this year. If winter vegetables fill the market by the second week of November, this year they will arrive only by next month- end,? an official added. 

 The city markets will have to rely heavily on states like Bihar and Jharkhand for their supply of cauliflower, cabbage, tomato and chilli. 

 ?If other states accounted for 20 per cent of the supply to city markets earlier, this year, only 30 to 40 per cent vegetables will be from this state, whereas 50 to 60 per cent will come from outside,? the official added. 

 ?We want farmers to grow some ?fast-growing? vegetables like cabbage, radish and spinach, which can enter the market 50 days from now,? he said. 

 Flower cultivation, too, has been hit by the rains and this will pose a problem soon.

 Gloomy weather, gloomy minds

 - Rain refuses to go, light therapy advised for season-induced depression

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 If your spirits have been lower than usual these past few days, blame it on the rain. For, doctors say, the depression in the skies can lead to depression in the mind.

 The sun does more than make you sweat: it cheers you up and gives you energy. City-based psychiatrists have seen patients of depression flooding chambers, after a four-day spell of gloom. There is no sign of the shadow over the city shifting either, with the weather office predicting more rains on Friday and dark clouds continuing to hover for a fifth day.

 The dismal, nagging rain has taken its toll on those who are clinically depressed. ?The weather is so dark and gloomy, I am afraid that if it continues for the next few days, we may have many more people coming down with acute depression,? said Bhargavi Chatterjee Bhattacharya, a city-based psychiatrist.

 The gloom, say doctors, can:

 affect 

self-esteem

 cause 

lethargy

 aggravate 

frustration and anger

 induce 

a negative attitude towards work

 trigger 

the desire for excessive sleep.

 Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a condition that hits people adversely in damp weather, especially during the rainy season. ?There are patients who cannot stand gloomy weather and doctors around the world are now prescribing light therapy for them,? added Bhattacharya. The treatment involves sitting before a bright light for five to six hours every day until the sun comes out to do the job naturally.

 Psychiatrist R. Ghosh Roy has also seen patients on anti-depression medication come back to him over the past two days. ?The damp weather affects the self-esteem of many people. Bright sunlight can lift spirits. Traditionally, people suffer from depression during rainy season more than they do in winter,? said Ghosh Roy.

 Prabir Pal, psychiatrist, has also seen otherwise healthy individuals suffer during incessant rains. ?Bad weather can cast a spell of lethargy. Even those who normally would work through the day are tempted to take a quick afternoon nap,? he said.

 According to the Alipore meteorological centre, the depression has weakened into a well-marked low pressure. ?There was a chance of marginal improvement, but since the low-pressure system near Calcutta has not moved much since Wednesday, we are expecting widespread to isolated rains in the next 24 hours,? said K.K. Chakraborty, director, weather section, regional meteorological centre.

 S.H. Khan: We have heard that doctors have been brought under the Consumer Protection Act. What steps do you take if a doctor is found violating the act?

 Doctors are paid for providing their expertise. Hence, the service comes under the Consumer Protection Act. According to the recent specifications included in the act, doctors should mention in their prescriptions the amount of their fee and should also specify the generic or family name of the medicines. 

 We urge doctors to give the family names of medicines, as several varieties of a medicine of a particular family are sold under different trade names. If one brand is too costly, the patient has an option to choose a cheaper one. That apart, doctors must prominently display their medical qualifications and registration numbers. In a diagnostic clinic, the authorities should inform patients beforehand about the possible expenditure for the treatment. 

 If a doctor violates the rules, any patient can approach us and we will take action against the doctor if he is found guilty.

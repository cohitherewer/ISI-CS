The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Found in Bengal: best of beaches

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Being bullish about Bengal is one thing, being blind to its ground reality quite another.

 The chief minister chose a mega travel convention to cross that thin red line on Friday, when he described Digha ? of all places ? as a world-class natural tourist draw.

 ?Digha?s beach is lined with casuarina trees... It is one of the best beaches in the world,? announced chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, at the inauguration of the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) annual convention at Science City, attended by about 1,400 representatives from the industry, India and abroad.

 Those in the audience who know Digha for what it is today ? a rocky, often risky, shadow of the holiday destination it used to be ? could only gape.

 But for Muhammad Akhtar Mummunka, managing director of Indus Guides, a Lahore-based travel agency and events management group, it was all part of a whole new world opening up.

 As the first Pakistani delegate to a TAAI conference, the representative of the Travel Agents Association of Pakistan (TAAP) was not here just as a goodwill gesture.

 Spending three days in Calcutta makes business sense for Mummunka. ?I have organised 10 groups of 150 Pakistanis each into north India. They just loved it and the Indian High Commission in Islamabad has assured me full cooperation for more trips, this time to the west and south of India,? he said.

 The next grand plan is a joint TAAP and TAAI convention this winter, entitled Tourism ? Bridge to Peace and Prosperity. 

 ?We are also working on package tours to each others? countries. The peace process should be at all levels,? stressed Mummunka.

 Bhattacharjee, meanwhile, was determined to take the tourism pitch to quite another level. Sunderbans was being developed as an eco-tourism resort, ?the focus of the future?, he assured.

 Calcutta?s multicultural nature was why ?tourists love coming here?, he observed, and new shopping malls and multiplexes had given the city a new feel, the chief minister added.

 But the star turn was reserved for aviation minister Praful Patel?s promise of open skies and hi-tech airports.

 lWith the festive season still on and wedding season close on its heels, Weavers Studio on Anil Moitra Street started its three-day exhibition of Benarasi silk saris on Thursday. 

 With nearly 100 saris on display, the variety is large and each one has been carefully selected for its quality and style. Rani pink, off-white, red, mauve and orange are some of the colours used excessively in this collection.

 The Minakar (cloths of gold and woven silk) work, which has been showcased at the studio, is inspired by techniques adopted within the courts of Mughal India and Iran in the 17th and 18th centuries. 

 The weavers harnessed complex techniques to capture on pieces of silk cloth the appearance of richly enamelled gold. From this was created several articles of clothing and even jewellery.

 ?Benarasi silks adopt the oldest form of weaving and have been in existence for the past 5,000 years. The best traditional artisans are bound to hail from Varanasi. However, over the years, with different trends in fashion and new-age textiles, these people and their classical works of art are being neglected. Hence, we decided to provide a platform for them to display their masterpieces in silk,? says owner Darshan Shah

 ?We have also reproduced and created a unique collection of textiles taken from some of our older antique repertoire,? she added.

Gold galore

 lAfter a successful run at Metro Plaza, jewellery designer Varda Goenka, in association with Meenakhi Modi, launched yet another Diagold outlet at City Centre in Salt Lake on Friday. Actress Koneenica Banerjee and model Sheena Chohan were present to flaunt the jewels at the launch.

 ?I am focussing on big pieces this time,? explains Goenka, who is also trying to bring to Calcutta various styles of jewellery from across the world.

 ?I have sourced lines from Italy and Thailand, both of which have exclusive styles that one does not get to see very often in Calcutta,? she adds. 

 The Italian pieces are created out of gold threads that are so soft that an entire neckpiece can easily be crushed into the palm of one?s hand without feeling a thing.

 ?The Italian range starts at an affordable range of just Rs 500 for the pendants,? smiles Goenka.

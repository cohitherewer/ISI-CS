 Fancy fittings draw a fine

 - Car-owners warned by cops to abide by accessory rules

 OUR BUREAU

 Dress up your car with care, because a mismatched accessory might leave your wallet somewhat lighter.

 Over the past eight months, around 1,200 car-owners have been fined by traffic police, after a crackdown on road rulebook violations. The biggest offence has been number-plates embellished with car manufacturers? logos, attracting fines between Rs 100 and Rs 500.

 ?Such number-plates violate the Central Motor Vehicles (CMV) Act. Our drive against the offenders will continue,? warned Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic department).

 Such number-plates are, according to police, being issued by car distributors across the city. ?Fancy plates are now popular. Even owners of old cars are ordering them, spending between Rs 250 and Rs 400 for front and rear plates,? explained police officials.

 The traffic department has already sent a notice to car distributors with the warning that they, too, may be subject to a fine for the violation. ?Section 77 of the CMV Act states that nothing except the registration number can be mentioned on a number plate. The size of the letters and numbers is also specified in the rulebook, ? Basu added.

 The traffic department has issued guidelines for car-owners shopping for accessories, including the following:

Use plain number-plates, clearly displaying the registration number

Tinted windows and rear glass may provide privacy but can also invite a penalty 

and legal action

When installing extra lights in front of your car, ensure that they are focused 

on the road, so they don?t bother drivers of on-coming vehicles

Use simple horns

Make sure both your headlights and tail lights are working. Otherwise, vehicles 

may misjudge the width of your car.

 Subhasish Pal was among those fined recently. His chauffeur-driven Maruti was intercepted on CR Avenue by a traffic sergeant. ?I had no idea about the CMV Act,? said Pal. Joint commissioner Basu stressed that car-owners should change their plates as soon as possible. ?If you are caught, the sergeant may choose to slap you with a fine.?

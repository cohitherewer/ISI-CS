The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talent hunt in music medley

 Another telly talent hunt. Another all-India singing contest. Just a small little twist: this time it comes from those ?who started it all?. After the two TRP-smashing editions of Popstars, Channel [V] brings to you Super Singer ? a nationwide quest to seek the voice that will become the country?s next singing sensation. Having already travelled five cities, the contest hits Calcutta on Tuesday at The Hyatt Regency.

 But will Super Singer just fizzle out amongst the Cinestars Ki Khoj and Indian Idols? Amar K. Deb, Channel [V]?s head honcho, protests: ?We invented the game of reality shows in this country with Popstars. Since then, other channels have copied us and come up with their own versions. But only we know the magic formula.?

 Another USP, feels Deb, is the one-man jury, Adnan Sami. ?He will judge the contest at every stage and he has been doing a brilliant job, at times from 9 in the morning to 12.30 in the night and that, too, without lunch.?

 Apart from the two faces of the channel in the form of VJ Gaurav and VJ Shruti (picture left by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya), the band Aasma is in the city to promote the show. ?Popstars 2 changed our lives. We are sure Super Singer will do the same for other talented musicians.?

 The contest will be a five-stage process starting with the city auditions, followed by the five zonal rounds, quarter-finals, semi-finals and the big final. The Super Singer gets a recording contract from a music album (with a top music director and lyricist), music videos to launch the album and a playback song for a Bollywood film. ?You have to just win, we?ll take care of the rest,? promises Deb.

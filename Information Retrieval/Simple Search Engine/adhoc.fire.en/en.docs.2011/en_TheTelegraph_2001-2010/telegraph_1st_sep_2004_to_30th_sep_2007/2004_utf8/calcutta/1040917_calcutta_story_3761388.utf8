 Adoption offer for home tot

 PRONAB MONDAL

 An official of the government-run Liluah Home for Destitute Women has come forward to adopt a two-and-half-year-old boy, whose mother, a rape victim, died at the centre last year.

 Papia Majumdar, assistant superintendent of the home, wants to take Anjan home as soon as possible. 

 ?I don?t know what the court will decide. But I am eagerly waiting to take him home,? she said.

 Anjan lost his mother, Anju Pal, in January 2003. ?She starved herself to death after her mother refused to take her back because she had been raped,? recalled a home official.

 ?Anju came here in 2000 in an advanced stage of pregnancy. A few weeks after giving birth to Anjan, she started requesting us to release her. She was desperate to return to her Jadavpur residence,? the official added.

 The home authorities tried to convince Anju?s mother to take her daughter back home. 

 ?But she refused, saying ?ota ekta nashto meye, ota ekta paap, oke pherot nile samaje mukh dekhabo ki kore? (Anju is a fallen woman. She is a sinner. If we take her back, we will be ostracised)?,? the official recounted. 

 The moment Anju ? who was extremely attached to her mother ever since her father died ? came to know about this, she retreated into a shell, never to emerge. 

 For over a fortnight, Anju refused food and water. She wouldn?t meet anyone, including Anjan, for whom she had been abandoned by her family. 

 Soon, she developed various complications, such as renal failure. Anju was shifted to a hospital, where she died.

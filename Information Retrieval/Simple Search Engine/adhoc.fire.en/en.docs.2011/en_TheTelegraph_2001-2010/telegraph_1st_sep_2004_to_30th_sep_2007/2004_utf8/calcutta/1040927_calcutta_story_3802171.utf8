The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Speedster, sister and dream run

 At last, the Roys have two reasons to rejoice. Speedster Ranjita has broken her own personal record in the 100 m and 200 m races at the recent east zone meet. And her sister Rita has had a healthy baby boy.

 Theirs was a story of sacrifice and struggle. Of one sister giving up the chance for a future to give the other a chance to chase her dream.

 And chase Ranjita sure did. After their father?s death, when the two were still in elementary school, there wasn?t enough money to eat, let alone coach two quicksilver sisters in athletics. Though equally talented, Rita gave up her shot at a life on the track to stay home and help her mother tie bidis.

 All the while, Ranjita moved from strength to strength. Finally, on September 19 and 20, the east zone competition saw her not only come in first, but also beating her personal best, blazing through 100 m in 12.2 seconds and 200 m in 25.2 seconds, missing the state mark by a whisker.

 ?I didn?t think I could do it because just two weeks before the run, I had twisted my ankle,? said Ranjita, thrilled to bits. She was advised complete bed-rest and the doctor was less than optimistic about her chances of competing. ?He thought it would be better if she didn?t run, but that if the pain subsided, she could give it a shot,? explained coach Swapan Haldar. 

 Ranjita gritted her teeth and ran her life?s best, despite not practising since the injury. ?When I was on the block, I could feel the pain. But then I started running and I forgot all about it till I had finished,? laughed the 19-year-old. 

 Now, Ranjita has her running shoes laced up for the inter-zonal meet in Lucknow, starting October 18, followed by the junior nationals at the end of the year.

 While a career in running has always been a financial strain for the family, the Roys of Chinsurah have managed to make ends meet through a number of scholarships, including one from The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence. 

 After her poor performance in school, those were lost. But this year, Ranjita cleared the Madhyamik and was also drafted into the Allahabad Bank athletics team, for which she will receive a monthly stipend. 

 That should ease the burden a bit. ?Ma has an eye problem that refuses to go away. Now, we are planning to take her to the doctor for a check-up, finally,? explained the girl on the run.

 And with Rita?s husband finding work near her family in Chinsurah, she and her baby boy are a mere 10 minutes away from a home that is starting to smile.

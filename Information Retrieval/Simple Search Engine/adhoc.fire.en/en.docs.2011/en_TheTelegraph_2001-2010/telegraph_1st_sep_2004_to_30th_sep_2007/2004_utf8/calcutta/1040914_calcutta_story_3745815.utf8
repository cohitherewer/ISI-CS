 ...on to infotech highway

 - Bengal?s demand for coveted landing station gets a boost

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Roads in the state?s IT hub may be hard to spot, but a much-coveted infotech highway is zooming into sight.

 The first concrete step towards Calcutta shedding its Group C city status and emerging as a more viable information technology (IT) destination has just been taken.

 The poor standing dictated by a city?s distance from an optical fibre cable (OFC) landing station ? more than 500 km away puts Calcutta in Group C ? has been a pet peeve with IT players, present and prospective.

 That could change. Dayanidhi Maran, Union minister of communications and information technology, has written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, stating that public sector major BSNL will conduct a techno-economic feasibility study for a landing station in Haldia.

 ?We are very happy with the encouraging response and we think our demand will be considered,? said state IT minister Manab Mukherjee, who met Maran last month and reiterated the need for an OFC landing station.

 There are three OFC landing stations in the country, with VSNL operating two in Mumbai and Kochi and Bharti having its facility in Chennai. 

 The facility enables faster and more reliable transmission of voice and data, besides reducing the cost of communication.

 ?In the absence of any landing station near Calcutta, the companies here are facing a cost disadvantage to the tune of 20 to 25 per cent in comparison to their counterparts down south and in the west. If the project is cleared, the growing IT-enabled services (ITES) industry will get a level-playing field,? explained G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT.

 In a recent study by Hewitt Associates, Calcutta finds mention as a preferred destination for ITES companies. 

 ?The demand for bandwidth in the state has increased significantly in recent times and we think a landing station in Haldia will be viable,? added Gautama.

 Besides speed and savings, a landing station closer to Calcutta would also increase reliability of transmission, and improve uptime, said Aditya Bajoria of Vishnu Solutions.

 The state government had gone into overdrive to bag the station ? holding talks with both Reliance and BSNL, convincing Wipro chief Azim Premji to write to Mukesh Ambani and lobbying with the Centre to give BSNL the green signal.

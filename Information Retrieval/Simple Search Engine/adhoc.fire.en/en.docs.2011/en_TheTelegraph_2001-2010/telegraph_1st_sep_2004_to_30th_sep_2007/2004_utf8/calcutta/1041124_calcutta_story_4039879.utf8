 Such a contest on Diwali is a wonderful idea, both for tourists and for the fireworks industry here. This would allow us to show our expertise. Last winter, we held a show at Outram Ghat on the request from an institute. Our men went out in boats on the Hooghly and set up the all-lights-no-sound show in the air. It was a great success. Light-based fireworks are costlier than the sound-based ones and are going out of reach of ordinary people. And those meant for exhibitions and contests are even more spectacular, and hence costlier. Tubri and rongmoshal contests that were commonly organised by para clubs have gone out of vogue due to restrictions on the sale of the ingredients. So people have no idea how wonderful a fireworks show can be. The hue and cry over pollution has made us lose customers. In other states, the cut-off is 125 decibels, here it is 90. So we are being stopped from manufacturing some beautiful fireworks which are legal elsewhere.

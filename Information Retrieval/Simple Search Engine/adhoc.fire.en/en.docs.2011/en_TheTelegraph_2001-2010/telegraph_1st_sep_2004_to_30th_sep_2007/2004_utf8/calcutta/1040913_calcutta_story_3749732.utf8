 Grants bus skips college

 - St Xavier?s seeks nod for new courses after UGC snub

 MITA MUKHERJEE AND JULIUS GOMES

 One of best-known colleges in the country, which is also one of Calcutta?s best, is struggling to live up to its ?nihil ultra? (nothing beyond) motto after being shunted out of a list of institutions that will receive hefty grants from the University Grants Commission (UGC). 

 The St Xavier?s College authorities have approached Calcutta University (CU) for permission to introduce a number of bio-science-related ?emerging subjects? at the under-graduate honours level, university officials confirmed on Sunday. 

 When contacted, Fr P.C. Mathew, principal of St Xavier?s College, confirmed that the first step to introducing the new courses had been taken. ?We will talk about that soon,? he said. 

 The move comes days after a UGC notice posted on the official website declared that the only college from Bengal to have made it to the list of ?Colleges with Potential for Excellence? scheme was Presidency College. 

 Education officials said St Xavier?s College may have missed the UGC grants bus because it lacked post-graduate courses of study and did not offer modern bio-science subjects or popular vocational subjects among its under-graduate courses.

 ?With its current under-graduate programme, St Xavier?s College has lost a host of indigenous scholars to institutions in other states, and its only post-graduate honours course in education is not enough for an institution of higher education,? an official said.

 ?The St Xavier?s College authorities contacted us on Friday and expressed their desire to introduce some new honours courses in the bio-science stream, spanning subjects like zoology, botany and physiology,? said CU pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das, adding that ?talks are on to gauge the viability of the proposal?.

 According to him, the CU authorities have not been officially notified by the UGC as yet, but they came to know from a list posted on the UGC website that St Xavier?s College has not been selected for the grant in the first lot. 

 The UGC?s announcement came as a shock to the state higher education department, which had recommended St Xavier?s College, along with Presidency, for the grant, because it is one of the few institutions in Bengal to meet the standards set by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).

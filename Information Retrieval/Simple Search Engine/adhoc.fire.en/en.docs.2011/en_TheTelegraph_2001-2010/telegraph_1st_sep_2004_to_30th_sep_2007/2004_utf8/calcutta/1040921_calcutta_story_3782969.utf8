 Cops dig up Palash network 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after his arrest, police on Monday began a probe into the network of contacts Palash Das had used to evade the dragnet so far. Detectives examined the telephone numbers retrieved from his cell phone to get an idea about his links across Bengal. 

 Palash was netted in Nadia?s Chakdah on Sunday. There are 28 cases pending against him, including murder, extortion and rioting. In June 2001, he had left the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government red-faced when a police raid, starting in Howrah, led to his arrest from Salt Lake stadium.

 On Monday, Palash and associate Robi Mondal were produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Barasat and remanded in police custody for seven days. 

 While the hunt continues for his other links who would smuggle narcotics for him, police believe his wife holds the clue to several contacts. She has, however, not disclosed any names so far. 

 Insiders claim it was the recent arrest and interrogation of aide Jayanta Biswas that led the cops to track down Palash.

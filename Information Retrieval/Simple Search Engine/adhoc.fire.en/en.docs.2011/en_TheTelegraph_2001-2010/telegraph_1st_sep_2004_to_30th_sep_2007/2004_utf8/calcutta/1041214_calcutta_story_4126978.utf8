 Brad Pitt: Too hot to handle

Time for a Pitt shop

He?s hot as hell, voted one of the sexiest men alive 

several times over. He has dated some of the most beautiful women and been the 

subject of much hot gossip. Even though he?s happily married now, the rumours 

refuse to die. 

 Brad Pitt has proven his acting talent enough times in films like Legend of the Fall, Fight Club and Seven, to make a name and win fame beyond Hollywood. But the 41-year-old (his birthday is next Sunday) from Springfield, Missouri, is still very much a small-town family man at heart.

 The news from the Brad Pitt-Jennifer Aniston household is that while hubby wants kids, the former Friends star wants to pursue a career before she?s ready for motherhood. While the couple?s publicists have denied the claims, the fact remains that Aniston is filming in the UK, and Pitt is busy promoting Ocean?s Twelve. So they haven?t actually seen each other in a while.

 If it?s just his on-screen talents you?re interested in, catch him in the act in theatres as Rusty Ryan in Ocean?s Twelve, or at home in The Mexican on HBO. His leading ladies are often in the gossip fray as often as he is ? there were rumours of him getting along just a tad too well with The Mexican co-star Julia Roberts during filming, although the two share very little screen space.

 Catherine Zeta-Jones was his love interest in Ocean?s Twelve, who Pitt admitted to having ?no problems? kissing, but what really got him was her ability to ?drink anyone under the table?. Now, the grapevine has it that the handsome hunk has been getting cosy with Angelina Jolie while shooting for Mr and Mrs Smith. The film, about a mundane couple who are actually assassins out to kill each other, will be released next year. 

 True or not, we don?t know. Watch this space for more from the Pitt.

Amitabh and Rani in Black: All class

 The wait?s over. The first promos of Black are on the small screen and it won?t be long before the much-awaited Sanjay Leela Bhansali film hits the big screens. Initially slated to release on December 10, the film was postponed since this happens to be the no-moon (black) week, considered inauspicious.

 Coming after his magnum opus Devdas, Black is reportedly Bhansali?s most personal film. Initially planned as a small-budget quickie before another grand musical Bajirao Mastani, Black has grown in proportion and is now being billed as another big blockbuster from the Khamoshi maker.

 Set in the snowy climes of Shimla, the film has Rani Mukherjee playing a deaf and blind Christian girl with Amitabh Bachchan in the role of her teacher. The other important character in the film is Rani?s screen sister played by Nandana Dev Sen. Black has no songs but boasts of a classy background score by international man of music, Mychael Danna. As for the intense dark images in the film, no Binod Pradhan this time ? the camera is being handled by Mani Ratnam favourite Ravi Chandran. 

 The first season was gripping, with its action-packed drama and constant adrenaline rush. Third Watch is back on STAR World, on Wednesday nights, with more of the same. The show about the firemen, cops and paramedics in New York City (the fictional 55th precinct) is back with a bang.

 The first episode of the second instalment opened with moving scenes of the city a few days after September 11, 2001. Some lost their colleagues, others family. But they have picked up the pieces and are moving on, doing what they know best ? saving lives. It?s only a few episodes in, so you can still keep up. 

 There?s action and emotion, it?s about life and love. If you?re an ER fan, then this one is not to be missed.

Madhoo: Telly trek

 Remember the actress who played Roja? Yes, Madhoo the actress who sparkled in many a Bollywood movie like Pehchaan and Phool Aur Kaante has now made her foray into television. As Durga in the Sony serial Devi, Madhoo will descend on earth to fight the evil forces of two other familiar faces, Nirmal Pandey and Aly Khan.

 The popular ?socio mytho? on the telly, Devi will now focus on Durga, the goddess with celestial powers, waging war with Markesh and Rudraksh. There is also a twist in the tale when the forces of evil are beefed up in number to eliminate the last avatar.

 Speaking on this strategic move, Tarun Katial, executive vice president, programming and response, Sony Entertainment Television, said: ?With the introduction of Madhoo, Nirmal Pandey and Aly Khan, Devi shall help us to further consolidate our leadership position for our already existing strong Friday line-up. Viewers can now look forward to a spectrum of supernatural elements in this genre.?

 While Madhoo?s character of Durga has descended on earth to protect Kalika from the evil forces, Markesh, played by Nirmal Pandey (Bandit Queen), is one of Raj?s uncles desperate to eliminate Kalika?s firstborn child. And Aly Khan, who was unceremoniously taken off Balaji?s K. Street Pali Hill, plays Rudraksh, working towards the objective of Satan?s reign on earth but in a more calm and cool manner.

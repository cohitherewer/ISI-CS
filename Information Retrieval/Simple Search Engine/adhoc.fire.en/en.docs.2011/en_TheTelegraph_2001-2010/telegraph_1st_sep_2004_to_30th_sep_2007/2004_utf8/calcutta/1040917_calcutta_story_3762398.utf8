On a string, varied hues in the sky

 Bho-katta season is here again and don?t blame yourself if you didn?t notice. As fewer and fewer youngsters gear up with their latai-ghuri paraphernalia on Vishwakarma puja every year, painter Shanu Lahiri carries on with her enthusiasm for making and painting kites and for new ways of popularising the dying tradition.

 What started merely as ?something different? from painting has been kindled into a full-fledged passion that Lahiri has been pursuing for quite a while. Armed with designs, ideas, colours and equipment, the painter has been on a kite-high for the past 11 years. 

 ?It was then that an NGO approached me with a project of giving lessons to slum children at its centre in Lake Town. I decided to teach them to make special kites and wooden toys,? says Lahiri. 

 She has seen from her days as student and teacher that children, especially the under-privileged, love colours. ?Bright hues attract and fascinate little minds. The idea behind my project was to let the children have fun with colours, paper and designs and also help them make something that they would be able to use for their own recreation,? she explains. ?If they gain the expertise, they may also be able to make a living out of it.?

 But the project didn?t take off. Disappointed at first, Lahiri, however, never stopped pursuing her kite-mania. ?As part of preparation for the project, I had studied kites in detail. I had brought lots of books from abroad, which had amazing pictures and technical details about kites,?explains Lahiri. 

 So, even though there was nobody to share her knowledge with, the painter carried on making and designing kites. 

 Fighting kites has long been part of the Bengali tradition. There have been kites shaped as a simple double-colour rectangle (petkaati), moon (chandial), ace of spades (ishkabon) and queen of hearts (bibi). 

 ?I wanted to make kites in the shape of Ravana, replete with 10 hands, or Hanuman, with an elaborate tail. I have made hundreds of kites in a variety of designs, including some over eight feet long,? she says.

 Lahiri has been inspired by Japanese and Chinese kites, most of which are shaped like fans, and other huge creations in the USA. ?Though the kites abroad are huge and ornate, they are merely for the pleasure of the flier and the viewer. It is only in India, especially in Bengal, that we have a tradition of fighting kites,? says Lahiri.

 ?With reports of the decline in the tradition of kite-making and the gradual loss of this art, I am looking forward to carrying on newer projects, which might help talented but needy youngsters to earn a living as well as keep the tradition alive,? says Lahiri.

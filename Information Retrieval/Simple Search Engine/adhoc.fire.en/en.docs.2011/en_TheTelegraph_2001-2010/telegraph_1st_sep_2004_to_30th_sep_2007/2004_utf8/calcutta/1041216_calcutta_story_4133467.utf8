 Unlike Calcutta, where development was ?largely unplanned? and where ?many things happened illegally?, New Town, Rajarhat, will be a model city, ?completely organised and totally transparent?, according to former chief minister Jyoti Basu.

 The veteran Left leader, known to be the inspiration behind New Town, was speaking on Wednesday after unveiling foundation stones for three joint-sector housing projects in Action Area II of Rajarhat, to come up in collaboration with the West Bengal Housing Board.

 Lauding state housing minister Gautam Deb for his ?zeal and conviction? in going ahead with New Town, starting from scratch and studying all parallel models extensively, Basu reiterated the ruling party?s policy of walking hand-in-hand with the private partners.

 ?While the state and the private sector are both working on their own to create housing stock, the joint-sector model is as welcome and necessary in today?s scenario,? he pointed out.

 Deb, presiding over the ceremony, vowed to live up to the ?unstinting faith? and ?overwhelming response? of the public in the new township. 

 ?Credibility is our USP and this was not achieved overnight. We have compensated every farmer who donated land and rehabilitated all those who had to be relocated,? he stressed.

 The minister said more than Rs 1,000 crore has already been spent in Rajarhat and by the time the entire township is ready, the government will have spent ?over Rs 6,500 crore on creating core infrastructure alone?. He said New Town, which was kicked off with a target population of one million, will eventually accommodate nearly 20 million people.

 Deb also promised to create an IT city inside New Town, ?that will be twice the size of the one in Hyderabad and the most sophisticated in the country?. 

 Infotech will drive the central business district, which will also house all the support infrastructure needed, like star hotels and hi-tech connectivity corridors, he said.

 Underlining the employment potential in the new township, the housing minister said Unitech alone had taken up 150 acres for IT-related development, while work on DLF?s IT park was on in full swing. ?We are now working to create adequate back-up training facilities, so that the incoming majors are not short on quality manpower,? the housing minister added.

 Shyamal Sen, chairman of the state human rights commission, stressed the need for ?sustainable development? and expressed satisfaction over the eco-friendly nature of the joint-sector projects unveiled. ?The joint-sector model could be extended to other core areas, too, like education,? the former chief justice observed.

 The three projects flagged off during the day were Hiland Woods by Bengal United Credit Belani Housing Development Ltd, Sunrise Point by Bengal Park Chambers Housing Development Ltd and Akankha, by Bengal Shelter Housing Development Ltd.

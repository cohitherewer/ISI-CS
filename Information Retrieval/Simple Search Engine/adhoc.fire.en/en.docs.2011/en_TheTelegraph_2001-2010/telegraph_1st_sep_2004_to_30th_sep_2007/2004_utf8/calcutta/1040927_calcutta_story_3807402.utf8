 Death by cricket bat blow

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Fourteen-year-old Miraj Moukhtar, alias Rinku, was killed late on Saturday in Shibpur when two friends hit him on the head with a cricket bat. 

 Rinku, battered in front of his elder brother, Mukhtar Ali, was admitted to a local hospital but succumbed to his injuries within a few hours.

 After Ali provided a blow-by-blow account of the killing, officers of Shibpur police station tried to trace out Rinku?s two friends, Bittu and Sonu, aged between 13 and 15 years. But both boys are absconding. 

 ?We have received a specific complaint from Rinku?s family. We are trying to track the boys. Their families are being examined,? said Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, superintendent of police (SP), Howrah.

 According to police, the boy was killed during a cricket match in a playground in the Kaus Ghat Road area. 

 ?We left home in the afternoon as usual and went to the field. We were a little late. Our friends Sona, Mehtab and Wasim had already started. When we asked them to begin afresh, they agreed. We, then, formed two teams,? Ali told police. 

 Rinku?s team won the toss and decided to bat first. ?Trouble started when Rinku wanted to bat and his two team-mates, Bittu and Sonu, opposed it,? Ali said.

 ?My brother, too, was determined not to give them the bat,? said Ali. ?Soon, they started fighting. I tried my best to pacify them but it did not work,? he added.

 Suddenly, Bittu caught hold of Rinku?s arms. ?Sonu snatched the bat and hit Rinku?s head twice with it. It all happened within a moment. Rinku slumped on the ground, unconscious. There was a deep gash on the right side of his forehead and blood was oozing out of it,? said Ali.

 On seeing blood, Bittu, Sonu and the others fled. Rinku was taken to a doctor in the neighbourhood, who referred him to nearby Jain Hospital. 

 ?The doctors tried to save him for over three hours but failed. Later, doctors told us that the boy died of internal haemorrhage,? said an officer of Shibpur police station.

 Police received a complaint from Rinku?s uncle Urtaz Ali. ?Besides, we recorded Ali?s statement, as he is the sole witness. A search is on for the accused,? said SP Bhattacharya.

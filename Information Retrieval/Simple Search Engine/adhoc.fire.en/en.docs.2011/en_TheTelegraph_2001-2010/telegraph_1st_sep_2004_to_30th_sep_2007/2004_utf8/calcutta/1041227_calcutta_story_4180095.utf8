The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

Melody through the months

Music piracy, radio playbacks and costly soundtracks 

have meant that film albums in 2004 have been all about dwindling sales. On the 

flipside, there is hope in the launch of new music labels (Yash Raj Music) and 

a drastic cut in audio CD prices (Bewaafa CD comes for Rs 55). But which 

were the albums that were able to raise the bar musically all this year? Here?s 

the best 2004 had to offer in original film soundtracks?

 Dhoom? One half of the Jeet-Pritam 

team that scored the music for Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai, Pritam Chakraborty, 

made Calcutta proud by going dhoom in Bollywood. Not just the title track 

which is still the ?must hear, must play? number in every disco across the country, 

Shikdum, Salaame and Dilbara were not only easy on the ears 

but their picturisations made them smooth on the eyes too?

Disco deewana: Dhoom macha le

 Fida? If one man knows the pulse 

of this nation, it has to be Anu Malik. Whether it?s the breezy Nazar nazar 

or the foot tapping Let?s do balle balle or the melodious Dil mere naa, 

Fida scored high on music. Add to that the Anu-Alisha reunion track Maine 

jisko chaha, which found Fardeen and Kareena in the tub and became the hottest 

track of the season.

Disco deewana: Let?s do balle balle 

 Main Hoon Na? ?Farah (Khan) told 

me the situation and I just went tana tana tana tana dhum na!? That?s Anu 

Malik describing how he came up with the qawwali number for the film. The 

title track was a big hit too and so was the retro number Gore gore. But 

the most refreshing song of the album was Abhijeet?s Tujhe jo maine dekha 

(no wonder Sush looked the way she did in the song).

Disco deewana: Chale jaise hawaein sanan

 Veer-Zaara? Thirty years after 

Madan Mohan passed away, son Sanjeev Kohli worked on some of his best unused tunes 

to give voice to Veer Pratap Singh and Zaara Haayat Khan in Yash Chopra?s latest 

celluloid romance. While Tere liye ruled the charts, Main yahaan hoon 

was the other winner. The rest was a mixed bag with Hum aa gaye hain kahaan 

and Do palon ki being highly hummable.

 Yuva? When Rahman decides to 

do a baul song, a disco track, a rap number, and if that is in collaboration 

with Mani (Ratnam) Sir, you know what to expect. Whether it?s the charged Dhakka 

laga bukka or the rustic Kabhi neem neem or the rumbling Badal, 

Rahman?s in top form. But it is Khuda hafiz with its jazz interludes that 

takes the genius to his next level.

Disco deewana: Fanaa

 Murder? The tunes may have originally 

been born in Bangladesh and Arabia but they found their most popular expression 

under Anu Malik?s baton in this Anurag Basu thriller. Kaho na kaho was 

the first track to become a hit followed by Bheegey honth and Dil ko 

hazaar bar roka. Jaane jaana, the Phiriye dao copy could have 

been made a touch different from the original, though. 

Disco deewana: Bheegey honth

 Hum Tum? The return of Jatin-Lalit 

couldn?t have been better timed. The melodious duo was back to its best, churning 

out chartbusters galore in Chak de, Ladki kyon and the title track. 

But what also took the console was the infectious mix of the title number by Rishie 

Rich in the form of U n I, featuring Juggy D and Veronica.

Disco deewana: Hum tum (Rishie Rich)

 Lakshya? Shankar Ehsaan Loy had 

a somewhat indifferent year after 2003?s chartbusting Kal Ho Naa Ho. This 

Farhan Akhtar film too was far from their best but did have a couple of winners 

in Main aisa kyon hoon and Agar main kahoon. The rest of the tracks 

were too functional for the film and couldn?t stand on their own tunes. A poor 

follow-up to the recordbreaking Dil Chahta Hai for the talented trio.

Disco deewana: Agar main kahoon

 Khakee? Jingle maker Ram Sampat?s 

debut was an outright winner with Waada rahaa being the pick of the lot. 

Aisa jadoo dala re made them all move, Dil dooba dooba gave them 

that sinking feeling, Uparwaale made them think. For a rank newcomer working 

with such big names, Khakee was a brave effort. This is one music maker 

to look forward to.

Disco deewana: Aisa jadoo daala re

 Morning Raga? Fusion in the truest 

sense of the term, the Mahesh Dattani film took movie music to another league. 

Blending two completely opposite music forms, composers Mani Sharma and Amit Heri 

fused original compositions from Carnatic maestros with typical Western instrumentations. 

Everything from Raag Todi (Thaye Yashoda) to Raag Natai (Mahaganapatim) 

to Raag Khamas (Maate) has been presented in the most acceptable format 

so that GenY is not alienated from the old world repertoire.

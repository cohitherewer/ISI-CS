The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lunch launch

Zeeshan Jawed

The 

set lunch at the office cafeteria could well be a bigger bore than the boss. Nor 

is a lavish lunch buffet spread at the neighbourhood restaurant the best option 

at hand when you?re out to grab a quick bite.

 Now solving the pang problem to a great deal, at least for office-goers in and around Elgin Road, is the Table d? Hote (full meal but from a limited-choice menu) from Oh! Calcutta. The speciality Bengali and Continental restaurant in Forum has a quick-fix solution in a small but varied working lunch, served in a jiffy.

 A meal under the table-of-the-host scheme includes soup, the main course and a dessert from a set menu with quite a few options in each section.

?Time is a huge factor when you are out to lunch during work. So we ensure that anyone who goes for the Express Lunch or TDH (Table d? Hote) option just spends 35 to 40 minutes from the time of entering the restaurant till leaving,? said manager Sanjoy Roy. 

 While vegetarians can opt for a soup, two vegetarian side dishes, rice, naan and a sweet dish; non-vegetarians get the option of one of the veg items being replaced with a fish or chicken preparation.

 Kadai Chicken, Rezala, Sorshey Bata Jhal in the non-veg section and Jhalfrezie, Jhinge Aloo Posto, Motorshuti Diye Aloo Phoolkopir Dalna in the veg platter are the highlights.

 The cost for a lunch on the run: Rs 150, plus taxes.

 If your bag?s bulging with designer shimmer, do a little balancing act by checking out the crafts and handloom exhibition at the Purbashree Emporium in Dakshinapan, on till October 6. 

 Culled from the states of Meghalaya, Manipur and Nagaland, the exhibition organised by the North Eastern Handicrafts and Handlooms Development Corporation Limited features shawls and saris showcasing ethnic weaves from the regions, besides decorative and utilitarian items made of bamboo and cane.

 ?An annual affair, the exhibition doubles as a platform for artisans from the Northeast to display their work,? said P.K. Gogoi, emporium manager.

 The meet also helps create awareness about the states? varied wealth, added Gogoi. ?The green bamboo (raw material for many of the products on display), for example, is only available in Meghalaya and is now being exported. But the resource is yet to betapped,? felt Gogoi.

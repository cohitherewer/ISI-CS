The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Golden goal for beautiful game

 ClubSandwich

 Surojit Sengupta?s feints on the 

 flank, Shyam Thapa?s bicycle kick, Gautam Sarkar?s tireless 

 running, Tarun Bose?s heroics beneath the bar?

 Nostalgic vignettes all, from 

 the glory days of Maidan football ? memories that could 

 be relived this festive season, thanks to a novel initiative 

 by the city?s premier sports-oriented social club, CC amp;FC. 

 In a throwback to the past, the institution plans to bring 

 together the class of the 70s and 80s in a special soccer 

 show from October 26 to November 6.

 ?We have invited retired and well-known 

 footballers from yesteryears to the seven-a-side tournament, 

 which we hope will become a calendar event,? says CC amp;FC 

 president Utpal Ganguly.

 The Masters meet will kick off 

 with 10 teams this year, with Air India from Mumbai also 

 likely to join the fray. From next season, the club management 

 plans to get more outstation outfits and then, sponsors 

 willing, invite teams from overseas.

 The first recorded football match 

 in the city was played at the esplanade of Fort William 

 in the second week of April 1858 between the Calcutta Club 

 of Civilians and the Gentlemen of Barrackpore. The Calcutta 

 Football Club (the name under which CC amp;FC played its 

 soccer then) had its own chequered history, winning the 

 IFA Shield three years in a row starting 1922 (picture above).

 ?Only footballers born before 

 1964 are eligible for the tournament and we are looking 

 at major PSUs to field retired footballers on their rosters,? 

 says Anand Mandapaka, former Indian hockey goalkeeper, steering 

 the reunion rendezvous at Ballygunge. The club is also inviting 

 PSU bosses to ?promote camaraderie on a platform for colleagues 

 to interact in a sporting ambience?.

 Former Mohun Bagan central defender 

 and India international Pradip Choudhury, who will probably 

 turn out in SAIL stripes, feels the meet could trigger greater 

 corporate interest in the game. ?We are looking forward 

 to meeting old friends as well as opponents on the turf 

 again,? he says, hoping that the old heroes can inspire 

 today?s youngsters by weaving some vintage magic on grass.

 To commemorate the 140th anniversary 

 of the formation of the Ballygunge Cricket Club, CC amp;FC 

 is also organising a 20:20 cricket tournament from January 

 23 to 26 next year on the lines of the popular Singapore 

 meet. ?The idea is to have eight teams of six players each 

 ? four from overseas, two outstation and two local (one 

 being the hosts),? explains the president.

 First up, plans are afoot for 

 an exhibition tie with players attired in outfits of that 

 era (Ballygunge Cricket Club was born in 1864). ?The 20:20 

 meet should also become a permanent dot on the club calendar 

 and acquire international recognition. That?s our goal,? 

 stresses Ganguly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Ordinary folk, special feats

The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence is 

our annual pilgrimage to trysts with the silent, nameless heroes around us

The wife of the principal of one of the leading schools 

in the city confessed that it was the only day in the year she did not wear kajal. 

Moments after this year?s Awards ceremony, one of the city?s socialites and writers 

who adds plenty of colour with his choice of words and kurtas, sent me 

this SMS: ?What an inspiring show! Thank goodness I don?t wear kajal!? 

A couple of hours later one of the most senior police officers in the city called 

me up to say that though he was there on duty looking after the massive security 

bandobast, he was choked and speechless. A little later a schoolboy hero of mine 

who ran the 100 metres in 11 seconds flat, said he cried for the first time since 

he lost a race in school some 30 years ago. 

The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence 

over the past eight years has become an annual pilgrimage for so many of us ? 

a pilgrimage to somewhere deep within ourselves; for my soulmate, Denise, and 

myself, it is our annual spiritual healing; for my closest friends Biswanath, 

Partha and Somnath, it is an annual pilgrimage to the most congested of bylanes 

and remotest of villages. Incredibly, year after year, this small team finds ordinary 

people for whom courage isn?t a special quality ? it?s a way of life! If it wasn?t 

for them, these ordinary people leading extraordinary lives would live on unnoticed 

and we wouldn?t stop to notice just how ordinary we are. 

They did it again this year. They brought us face-to-face 

with heroes who face the sun, only to make sure that their shadows fall behind 

them ? seemingly vulnerable little children who dwarf giants, and frail, featherweight 

teachers who stand stronger than giant tree trunks. They made our hearts feel 

?so full? and yet so empty. They made us feel so ordinary; so small; so humbled. 

I always felt that I was a pretty good swimmer, till 

I had the honour of sharing the stage with a 10-year-old water baby who in spite 

of being born with a not-fully-formed vertebra and not being able to stand erect, 

can swim 100m of each of the four strokes and win a glut of gold medals at every 

national swimming meet for special children. I was honoured and humbled to share 

the stage with Ankita Singha. 

Some of my students at South Point remember the time 

I carried a Class X boy who was having convulsions, down four floors, because 

the lift wasn?t working. I always felt that I was a dedicated teacher who put 

student before self, till I had the honour of sharing the stage with a frail maths 

teacher. She risked her life by climbing down from the third floor of her school 

building to the second, to save the life of a girl who had jumped off the balcony 

to commit suicide, because she was afraid of failing. No coaxing was working; 

so the teacher jumped onto the narrow parapet and smothered the distraught girl 

with warm hugs, so full of love. I was honoured and humbled to share the stage 

with Suchitra Basu. 

I once stepped down from the presidentship of a social 

welfare organisation and thought that I had made a supreme sacrifice, till I had 

the honour of sharing the stage with a woman who went through the pangs of losing 

her mother-in-law and her husband in cold blood, fighting the odds, being elected 

fair and square, and then choosing to listen to her inner voice and not sit in 

the chair that was rightfully hers. I was honoured and humbled to share the stage 

with Sonia Gandhi. 

I was also honoured to be in Science City auditorium 

that morning in a hall full of angels. We call them our angels because 

they are silent, never seen and they fly! They float into our lives as if from 

nowhere; they lead us to lights shining ever so brightly ? lights that we don?t 

notice or choose not to. Meet some of them. 

Angel Kumaresh Ghosh is the journalist who worked 

tirelessly with Biswanath to make it possible for us to honour Gopal Patra, perhaps 

the only teacher to get a standing ovation in an auditorium, less than 24 hours 

before some other angels took him away. We at The Telegraph Education Foundation 

are determined to inspire school students of the city to see the real India and 

reach out to their less fortunate contemporaries in the villages of Bengal. Angel 

Kumaresh babu will show us the way, starting with Baikanthapur, Gopal babu?s 

village.

Angels L.V. Saptuarishi and Ashok Bhattacharya are 

the IAS officers who transformed the lives of so many landless farmers in Nadia 

district with their hugely successful silk-farming experiment some 20 years ago. 

Even today they are in touch with one of the boys of the village ? Sajjad, the 

son of Zakir Hussain, a one-time dacoit who used to steal live copper-wires from 

above the train tracks. They have guided and motivated Sajjad, who is a couple 

of months away from becoming Dr Sajjad Hussain. Angels Saptuarishi and Ashok want 

to be more active members of our village angel squad, in spite of the busy schedules 

they have as senior bureaucrats who lead from the front.

Angels Zasha and Raisa are the ten and eight year-old 

girls who noticed that whenever their car took a left turn after Kwality?s, a 

girl in her early teens would be studying with great concentration under the lamppost 

next to the Ballygunge Phari bus stop. In spite of the noise, the pollution, the 

people and the cars, she always seemed focussed while doing her homework at home 

? the pavement! Their hearts went out to her! They said to their mummy and daddy, 

?We have so many comforts and don?t like doing our homework? please help her.? 

Now that Jamuna Kapadia has been honoured and helped, Angels Zasha and Raisa are 

on the lookout for more Jamunas whenever they are in their car. 

The good news is that our legion of angels is growing 

by the minute. Angel Sushil Kumar Modi, the father of one of the certificate recipients 

last year, wants to reach out financially to Gopal babu?s family; another 

prospective angel, visiting from New Zealand, wants to take care of Jamuna?s needs 

and remain anonymous to you and to her; and post-January 2005, as Dr Sajjad 

Hussain, a young man is looking forward to treat the children of those who 

cannot afford to pay for it.

Hark, our herald angels are singing! Don?t wait for 

Christmas or the next awards ceremony to join the choir. Write to me at hrplvsnl.net. 

Recruitment is on! We are on! It?s time for you to get on!

 Mystery fire kills family

 - Accident, murder or suicide: cops wait for forensic report

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 38-year-old chartered accountant, his 32-year-old wife and their 10-year-old son died in a mysterious fire that engulfed their room in the Noapara area, on Akra Station Road, in Mahestala, early on Tuesday. 

 The police cannot decide whether it was an accident, a murder or suicide.

 Gajendra Bhagat and son Ankit were pronounced dead at Behala?s Vidyasagar Hospital. The wife, Mithu, who had suffered severe burns, died around 10 am.

 ?We are not ruling out any possibilities at the moment. We will investigate all aspects of the case,? said superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta. ?We are waiting for the report of the forensic team,? he added.

 At around 2.30 am, residents of Noapara noticed flames and thick smoke emanating from a window of the first-floor flat the Bhagats had rented in a two-storeyed building. They immediately raised an alarm and informed the landlord, octogenarian Ramdhan Shaw, who lived on the ground floor with his family.

 Neighbours broke open three locked gates to reach the first-floor room. They found the charred bodies of Gajendra and Ankit, a Class V student of a reputed English-medium school in Taratala. 

 Their bodies were close to each other. The son?s head was bent downwards. Mithu, a Nepali, though badly burnt, was still alive. 

 Police arrived and rushed all three to hospital. The neighbours had extinguished the fire themselves, so the fire brigade was not called.

 According to landlord Shaw, Gajendra had started a chartered accountancy firm in Chowringhee with two friends. The Bhagats were a happy family and popular in the neighbourhood.

 ?The couple was in Calcutta for the past 25 years, and for 16 years, they had been our tenants. Gajendra came from Bihar, and he would look after me like my own son,? Shaw said.

 Senior police officers are speculating whether the fire was caused by an electrical short-circuit. 

 Not ruling out foul play, they added: ?He may have had creditors with whom he had fallen out, or perhaps it was a business dispute.?

 Gajendra had purchased a flat in Golf Green and the family was to move into it on New Year?s Day, police also said.

 Island ships on schedule

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ships will sail as planned between the city and the Andaman and Nicobar islands, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury announced on Monday.

 Chowdhury, convenor of a task force set up to regularise sailing to and from the islands, reviewed the problems being faced by passengers. 

 ?Three new vessels will be commissioned shortly,? Chowdhury said. Andamans shipping secretary Naresh Kumar and Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) regional manager S.G. Thawani were among those present at the meeting.

 The state government appointed task force has been asked to look into passengers grievances, including unscheduled sailing and unavailability of return tickets. 

 State housing minister Gautam Deb, who oversees the CPM?s organisational affairs in the islands, was the first to bring the problems to the notice of the state government and the island authorities.

 Welcoming Chowdhury?s announcement, Deb said the task force should also look into the problem of declining interest among tourists to visit the island. 

 The SCI has complained that it arranges three to four sailings every month, but doesn?t get enough number of passengers.?Even during the tourist season, we don?t have cent per cent occupancy on ships,? said an SCI spokesman. 

 Officials said plans are afoot to explore more tourism potential in the islands so that more tourists and passengers can avail of the sailing.

 Doctor assault after boy death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Resident medical officer Raktim Misra of Balananda Brahmachari Hospital, in Behala, had to be admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital on Tuesday after being thrashed by the family of a teenaged patient who died.

 A few nurses, too, were injured when they tried to rescue the doctor from his assailants, who had come to take away the body around 8.30 am. 

 The hospital authorities have lodged a complaint with Behala police station.

 Bachchu Patra, 18, a Class XII student of Behala Boys? School, suffering from an abdominal problem, was admitted to hospital under physician N.R. Chakraborty on September 14.

 On September 17, Bachchu was operated upon. But the pain persisted and the doctor operated on him again on September 23. 

 But his condition deteriorated steadily and he died on Monday at about 11.40 pm.

 Deepankar Roy, secretary of the hospital, said the patient?s friends and relatives were present at the time but there was no sign of any trouble then.

 ?Around 8.30 am, they came to take the body and then suddenly turned violent. They attacked resident medical officer Misra and the nurses who went to save him,? said hospital secretary Roy.

 When the bereaved family was getting ready to take possession of the body, Misra was leaving on a personal errand. Suddenly, some of them surrounded him and punched him on his face.

 ?The mob attacked me before I could realise what was happening. It pushed me into a drain and threw stones at me. Later, with the help of some staff members, I was brought to the hospital. The nurses, too, were not spared,? Misra recounted. He is on a saline drip and a number of doctors were attending on him.

 The attackers broke the left hand of attendant Seema Das, who went to save Misra. They also severely beat up nurse Champa Manna.

The boy?s family members later denied any hand in 

the assault. ?Why would we attack them? We had gone to take the body of my brother,? 

said Rabin Patra, Bachchu?s younger brother. The Patras were three brothers; Bachchu 

was the second.

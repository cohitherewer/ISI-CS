The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Puja prequel to Sarat Chandra screen saga

 Festive frames captured on Joy Dutta?s lens, 

catching sequences filmed on Natarajan Subramanyan?s camera for Parineeta 

 Lalita and Sekhar?s love story in Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay?s Parineeta hardly takes a stroll out of their houses, except for a hurried stopover at Munger. But viewers can await a visual treat around town in Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s production based on the novel. And topping the list would be Durga puja.

 The crew, headed by director Pradeep Sarkar, has canned candid shots of the ritual. More Puja shots are in store once the stars ? Vidya Balan, Saif Ali Khan, Sanjay Dutt and Raima Sen ? descend here. ?I want to picture the city as I knew it while adhering to the novel as closely as possible,? says the ad film-maker who left Calcutta in 1971 while in school.

 The sequence of events in the household of the poverty-stricken Gurucharan (Achyut Poddar) and the prosperous and pompous Nabin Roy (Sabyasachi Chakraborty) takes place in and around October. 

 ?One cannot imagine October without Durga puja in Bengal,? Sarkar reasons. So he landed in the city on Sashti and took to the streets.

 The big day was Navami, when the Parineeta team filmed aarati. ?I would not have had the confidence to take on the crowd unless there was a puja happening in my mamar barir para,? Sarkar smiles. And it helped that Sarkar?s uncle, Ratan Gupta, is a former Puja committee president of the 74-year-old Samajsebi Sangha Sarbojanin on Lake Road. ?It was on the morning of Navami that I received a call from Pradeep wanting to shoot in the para. They wanted to do it in the evening. But that would have been impossible. So they settled for late afternoon.?

 Familiar faces were requisitioned to keep things under control. About 15 local residents, in sari and dhuti-punjabi, flocked to the pandal, shortly after the bhog ritual at noon. ?They were only told that the film was based on Parineeta,? explains art director Tanushree Sarkar.

 The unit is all praise for the Lake Road cast. ?Considering they were novices, it was amazing how smoothly the shots were taken,? wonders Sarkar. ?So cooperative too,? Tanushree adds.

 A huge crane was brought over. ?We needed to take top shots and zoom in for close-ups. There were a lot of passing shots as well. It can get pretty boring for a layman to walk from point A to point B six-seven times. But not a single person complained about the retakes. Thakurmoshai did a dummy aarati for us during what would have been his time for siesta. The dhaakis also played with a lot of gusto.? After the shooting, the unit was treated to bhog. ?We behaved like gluttons,? laughs Tanushree.

If the late lunch was an unexpected treat, a big gain was the wealth of ?pretty faces?. ?We have asked some of them to come for tests so that they can be used in other shots,? she points out.

 On Dashami, the crew camped at Babughat from noon till 7 pm. ?We saw some 15-20 idols being immersed. But what struck me was the number of cameramen on the banks and the high-end cameras they were using,? says Joy Dutta, the still photographer of the crew, who was ?busy capturing the 60s look (the period in which the film is set)? through his lens.

 This was the background. The venue for the foreground of the Puja sequence is Lahabari, housing the Pasteur Laboratories office at 2A, Bidhan Sarani. 

 An idol is ready at Kumartuli for the late-November dates. A dhunuchi naach sequence there with ?cursory participation of both Sanjay and Saif? will add to the festive cheer.

 Lahabari, which has birthed sequences in Dinen Gupta?s Jabaan and Rajani and Nitish Roy?s Tobu Money Rekho, was to have been a part of Devdas, the other Sarat Chandra opus, as well.

 ?Bhansali?s team filmed our house and furniture for about three hours. But the actors never came,? says Debanka Churn Law. Not that the Laws are too eager to welcome stars. ?Shooting of films creates a ruckus. We are not allowing them to move our antique furniture. Also, they must provide the kind of security that we saw at our neighbour?s where Antarmahal was shot. In fact, we are not keen to let out our rooms to a film crew again in future,? states Krishnendu Law, 32.

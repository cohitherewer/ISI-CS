 Financial and economic resources are not enough to tackle human deprivation, the mission of improving quality of life also depends on organisational abilities and public contribution. 

 Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen focused on some of the key developmental challenges at a public discussion on ?Needs and Resources: Education, Health and Employment? in the city on Wednesday. 

 Organised by Pratichi Trust, set up by Sen from his Nobel emoluments, Global Equity Initiative of Harvard University and Unicef, the two-and-a-half-hour discourse brought representatives from academia, politics and development agencies together. 

 Inviting arguments from the public, Sen kicked off the proceedings before a packed Nandan auditorium. After Sen?s presentation, the other panelists ? economist Jean Drez, CPM Politburo member Sitaram Yechuri, West Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta, Cecilio Adoma of Unicef, actress Shabana Azmi, National Advisory Council member A.K. Shiva Kumar and Lincoln Chen of Harvard University ? shared their views on the topic.

 From explaining the importance of public discussions on policy issues to focusing on some vital developmental initiatives, the Harvard professor defined the contours of the evening?s discussion by touching upon education, health and employment. 

 Shabana added another dimension by bringing in the issue of housing for the poor in the urban areas. 

 Focusing on education, Sen lauded the success of mid-day meals programme in generating enthusiasm among poor and low-caste students. But on universalising education, the Nobel prize winner for his contributions to social choice theory and welfare economics. observed: ?I have nothing against private schools, but I think these cannot substitute an inclusive high quality state schooling programme.? 

 Reiterating the role of government, he demanded a robust public healthcare system and narrated the success story in Kerala in bringing down infant mortality rates. He also talked about recent improvement in various human development indices in Bangladesh. 

 But on the United Progressive Alliance government?s proposed employment guarantee scheme ? minimum 100 days employment in a year with a daily wage of Rs 60 per household ? he was cautious and balanced his opinion mixing ?joy? with ?anxiety?. 

 Explaining his concern, Sen said: ?All the states have precarious state of finances... Besides there are also questions about how this employment will be used.? 

 Drez, who has co-authored books with Sen, also expressed concerns about the structure of the scheme, but added that it would have a ?significant impact? for people living below poverty line (BPL). ?Its implementation will pull two thirds of BPL population,? said Drez, demanding higher public spending. 

 Though development was at the centre of the discussion, the politicians on the podium did not miss the opportunity to share their views on economic reform strategies of the central government. 

 ?After the so-called reform of the economy, the tax to GDP ratio has gone down? Today, when we talk about a resource crunch for development, I must say this is the consequence of the policies pursued in the past few years,? said Yechuri. 

 Dasgupta, his colleague in the CPM, echoed Yechuri?s views besides working out a simple arithmetic of resource requirement of Rs 9,500 crore to address basic needs in education, healthcare and employment in the first year of a planned initiative.

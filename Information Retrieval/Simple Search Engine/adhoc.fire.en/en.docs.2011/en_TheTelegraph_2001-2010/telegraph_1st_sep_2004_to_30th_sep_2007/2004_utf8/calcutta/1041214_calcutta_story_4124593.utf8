 NRI wards off attackers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 During Durga puja, the target was a Polish woman. On Sunday night, it was a New York-based non-resident Indian (NRI), who had a first-hand experience of the terror that stalks the city streets.

 Sanghamitra Bose, 47, was pinned down by three youths on Beleghata Main Road while returning to her relative?s residence at Salt Lake.

 She chased the offenders, who threw a stone at her car, but was pinned down by them. She, however, managed to flee the spot and rush to a nearby police station. Police caught two of the accused within 10 minutes of the incident.

 During the Pujas, the Polish woman was teased and assaulted in Gariahat by three youths while returning to her friend?s house. Police had then taken three days to arrest the culprits.

 Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said: ?The incident took place around 11.40 pm on Sunday. She dropped off a friend at Creek Row, near Moulali, and was moving along Beleghata Main Road in a chauffeur-driven Opel Corsa, when a stone hit the windscreen. She was sitting beside the driver.?

 Sanghamitra, who is a researcher in natural justice in the US, stopped the car and got off to confront the three youths standing on the pavement.

 ?On seeing her, the trio started walking away. She ran and caught one of them. The other two then came back and all three started passing lewd remarks. An altercation broke out, following which the two youths freed their accomplice forcibly,? said an officer of Beleghata police station.

 Sensing trouble, Sanghamitra rushed to Beleghata police station. ?As soon as she informed us, we decided to conduct a raid. We rushed to the spot with her and saw two of the youths were still standing there,? said the officer.

 On seeing the police vehicle, the youths started running, but were caught. There are in their early 20s, and have been identified as Basudeb Mandal and Gautam Mandal.

 Police have charged the youths with mischief and wrongful restraint. It was not clear what they were doing on the spot. A hunt is on for the third youth.

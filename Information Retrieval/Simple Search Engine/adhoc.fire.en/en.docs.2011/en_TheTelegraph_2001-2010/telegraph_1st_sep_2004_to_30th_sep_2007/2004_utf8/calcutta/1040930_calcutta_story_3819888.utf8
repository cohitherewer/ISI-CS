Silence of the dead: A womans body lies on the streets 

as rallyists walk by

Apropos the report ?Citu forces cop transfer?, September 6, it is appaling that a traffic sergeant was transferred from his present posting for performing his duties sincerely, thanks to pressure from Citu-backed unions. 

 The Citu backing gives unions a licence to assume that everybody should work according to their directives, including the police. If the police are supposed to remain mute spectators in times of trouble, what is the use of law enforcers? 

 As government servants, the police are supposed to perform their duty, which is to maintain law and order. If the police are lax in their work, they may be charged with dereliction of duty. But if they work sincerely, their duties may bring them in the way of illegal operators. If they take a stand, they have to face the music by way of transfers. So what should they do? 

 In the case mentioned, stringent police action had hurt the interest of illegal autorickshaw operators, thus affecting the interest of the unions that fleece them. The unions have lodged false complaints against traffic sergeant Chapal Banerjee and his assistant, so that they were transferred elsewhere and the flow of illegal money continued. If it is impossible to book the guilty, what is the use of a system of law and order? 

 The government knows that 40 per cent autorickshaws operate without licences, creating chaos on the roads, ignoring traffic rules. Why then does the government not take drastic steps to rectify the auto menace for pedestrians and commuters? relief? If the police take an initiative to tackle the chaotic traffic, they are condemned, like Chapal Banerjee. This is unacceptable. 

 The professional career of government servants seems to depend on the whims of powerful political groups. Will the government see to it that the system becomes people-friendly rather than ?party-friendly?? 

Madhabi D. Ghosh, 

Salt Lake. 

People are known to vie with each other to condole the death of their boss? pet, but it seems no one cares for a dead human being, lying unattended on a busy thoroughfare. Apropos the picture story ?No time to pause for Calcutta?s dead?, September 2, while our city of compassion embraced a mahamichhil to protest US imperialism ? a cause of universal brotherhood ? and more than one lakh people found time to march together, not a single person showed any sympathy for the mortal remains of a woman lying abandoned on the roadside. The Metro picture was a grim reminder of the new generation for which reverence, compassion and tolerance mean nothing. 

Subhankar Mukherjee,

Burdwan. 

Thank you Metro. The picture of the dead woman 

lying on the road in Esplanade, amid policemen and lakhs of rallyists reflects 

the true nature of present-day Calcuttans. At least the cops posted in the neighbourhood 

should have been prompt in arranging for the last rites. Such apathy of so-called 

intellectual Calcuttans is shameful. 

A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

Hooghly. 

As the city joined a mahamichhil for Iraq?s 

cause, a dead woman lay abandoned in the heart of the city, but no one bothered 

to take notice. What is the use of fighting for causes abroad when disgraceful 

events happen closer home? 

Chandan Ray,

Sarsuna. 

The report ?Fowl wings into fish den?, September 4, made interesting reading. In Bengal, most fish-eaters are fast switching to chicken for reasons of their own. In the near future, a time might come when Calcuttans will cease to be known as a race fond of fish. 

T.R. Anand,

Budge Budge. 

The news of two new mega healthcare projects of international standards to be established in Calcutta by two city healthcare giants ? Asia Heart Foundation (AHF) and Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) ? is likely to bring hope, at least on paper, for the hapless patients of West Bengal (Twin boosters for healthcare, September 6). But given the way medicine is practised in the state and errant doctors are shielded by their peers, who is to judge the standards of these proposed health centres? The standard of medical care is dependent ultimately on the care providers ? doctors and nurses ? and not the size of the buildings. 

Kunal Saha,

Ohio, USA. 

Although it is heartening to know that new healthcare 

care centres are in the offing in Calcutta, it is a pity that there are no facilities 

for geriatric problems ? a conglomerate of disorders that come with old age. Geriatric 

patients should be taken into special consideration by our healthcare system. 

Diptimoy Ghosh,

Salt Lake. 

It is perplexing to learn that the arrest of the son of a senior police official on the charge of molestation was not a strong enough message against eve-teasing in Calcutta (Arrest no check on tease, September 7). The police should nab eve-teasers who pass lewd comments at women and mete out exemplary punishment to curb this growing phenomenon. 

Prahlad Agarwala,

Majdia. 

The Maidan?s reputation as an unsafe place for families and women after sundown has robbed it of much of its popularity. The police?s clean-up claim of the Maidan is undoubtedly heartening for lovers of greenery (Maidan safe at sundown, September 2). 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road. 

It is good news that a first-of-its-kind flower market will start functioning from 2005 if all goes well with the proposed Mullickghat complex. Kudos for highlighting this fascinating project with a revolving restaurant and a glass capsule lift ride into the country?s only international flower auction centre. 

Bhupen Bose,

Dum Dum Park. 

Apropos the letter ?Neighbours? cruel turn towards man?s best friend? in the Calcutta Column, Indians are essentially religious, but our religion seems to be restricted to rituals only and do not extend to poor animals at our doorstep. 

Purnima L. Toolsidass,

Compassionate Crusaders Trust.

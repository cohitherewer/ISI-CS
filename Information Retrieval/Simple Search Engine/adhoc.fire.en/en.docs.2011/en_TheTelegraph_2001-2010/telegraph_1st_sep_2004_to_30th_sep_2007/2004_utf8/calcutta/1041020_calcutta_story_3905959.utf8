 People dressed in their best congregate at the mandaps to offer anjali. Priests chant mantras, and the air is heavy with incense. The atmosphere is one of calm and piety. Anjali on the Net, though devout, is a technical affair, and might not live up to the true spirit of the Pujas, which after all is a religious affair.

Arunava Bose Choudhury, 

 Barrackpore

 Traditional rules and rituals have started declining but anjali on the Net can in no way replace the fervour or spirit of mantras in pandals. Those who choose to offer anjali on the Net will miss the feel of the atmosphere in the pandal, that rejuvenates hearts and gives people a chance to meet up with neighbours.

Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 

 Hooghly

Anjali on the Net will not rob the flavour 

and decorum of real rituals at the pandals. In fact, the version on the Net will 

provide scope for more people to offer the anjali in a calm, sober atmosphere 

without the cacophony generally associated with community pujas. As long as there 

is devotion and sincerity, nothing else really matters.

Ranadip Ganguly, 

Diamond Park

Anjali at pandals have a special flavour of 

their very own. Jostling for space and flowers, listening to the purutmoshai 

chanting mantras, meeting neighbours after a long, long time ? these cannot be 

matched by anjali on the Internet. The real flavour of Durga pujas will 

definitely be missing on the Net. 

Kaushik Guha, 

SN Roy Road 

Offering anjali on the Net? It could never 

be compared with offering anjali in pandals or temples. The element of 

bhakti cannot be there on the Net. If one does not have the time, then 

he should not offer anjali at all. By offering anjali on the Net, 

he will ridicule the Pujas. This lunacy should stop somewhere. A devout person 

will never offer e-anjali. 

Madhusree Mukherjee, 

 Salt Lake

 Anjali on the Net is a frivolous idea. Through the anjali, people pray to the goddess and ask for her blessings. Therefore, it should be done sincerely, no matter whether the pandals are crowded or not. The world might get technologically advanced by the day, but the Internet still can?t be the solution for everything. 

Tapan Pal, 

 Batanagar

 Anjali on the Net will serve no one?s purpose. The devout will avoid it, as scriptures or almanacs do not mention this. For the non-devout, it is just an opportunity to flaunt the new dhoti or sari bought for the Puja day. For a teenaged boy, this is a good chance to get close to that new girl, who moved into the locality recently. Can the Net ever offer these? 

Joydip Sur, 

 CIT Road 

 Technology is not a replacement for tradition. The excitement that revolves around the entire event of waking up to the sound of dhaak, taking an early bath, getting dressed in your best and walking down to your nearest pandal for anjali has its own charm. This magic that is anjali cannot be created on the Net. 

Sayan Banerjee, 

 Belgachhia Road

 Why does e-anjali need to replace the real ritual? It will only be a welcome move for probashi Bengalis who will be able to offer anjali. Secondly, those Bengalis who will have to be out of the state this Puja for professional or other reasons, can still catch up on the ritual with this new concept of e-anjali. It will be excellent, if this concept can coexist with the traditional ritual at the pandals. 

Rimli Datta,

Salt Lake 

 The environment at the pandal is of utmost importance.The e-anjali is a good solution for those staying abroad and for the sick and disabled, who can avoid pandals and offer anjali in the peace of their own homes. But for the rest, this is absolutely ridiculous.The crowded pandals, the sweet sound of the dhaak, the auspicious smell of the dhunuchis ? features such as these make the Pujas complete. 

Govind Das Dujari,

 Diamond Harbour Road

 Factors like extortion of subscription, pomp and show, inexperienced young lads replacing elderly organisers, lack of family atmosphere discourage the devout from going to crowded pandals for anjali. In the tech-age, a devotee offering anjali on the Net may become a reality in the near future. For even the Chandipath that we enjoy on Mahalaya comes through sound waves instead of being chanted by a priest.

Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge

 Chanting of mantras evokes a divine feeling in the devotee, inspiring him or her to offer prayers to the goddess. In this case, therefore, real chanting in pandals or recorded mantras through the Net will not amount to much of a difference.

Sushma Jalan,

 Alipore

 Anjali on the Net might bring relief to many people who miss the auspicious ceremony for fear of crowds and traffic jams. But it will never be able to replace the real ritual of standing in front of the goddess, with dhaak beats in the background and the smell of dhoop. The excitement and thrill of the mandap can?t be possibly there on the Net.

Jayanta Datta, 

 Chinsurah

Anjali on the Net will never be able to replace the real ritual in crowded 

pandals for the devout. The real devotee would always want to go to the ?real? 

place and offer anjali before the idols. However, e-anjali might 

help those living elsewhere, where Durga puja is not celebrated. But in our state 

you will always have devotees who are determined to come to the pandals for anjali, 

come rain or shine.

Protyush Mozumder, 

Biren Roy Road (West)

Bengalis abroad have already begun to taste the charms 

of Durga puja through the Net. For others hoping to avoid the crowds in Calcutta, 

e-Puja or e-anjali might be a rather good idea. But the thrill of offering 

anjali in a pandal can never be matched by a virtual ambience. 

Anandadip Chowdhury,

 Baguiati 

 E-anjali cannot replace the spirit in pandals without the dhoop, dhaak and kanshor. The mandap is where people of a locality turn out in their festive best and bond together. This is also the only occasion for young girls and boys to meet in the absence of parental supervision. 

Pritha Sen,

 Jadavpur

 Anjali at pandals brings family members, friends and neighbours together in an atmosphere of peace and calm, amidst the heavenly beat of the dhaak and the enchanting smell of the dhoop. But for people staying abroad web anjali is a good idea. In the absence of a real holiday during the Pujas, albeit without any organised Puja in the vicinity, this could be a good gift for probashi Bengalis.

Indranil Sanyal,

 Dhakuria

 Pushpanjali on the Net cannot replace the real ritual in the pandals. The true charm of the anjali lies in the priest?s chanting mantras, the smell of the dhoop and the beat of the dhaak, amidst an overall atmosphere of religious fervour. This can never be replicated by the Internet.

Diptimoy Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake

 The importance of the rituals in crowded pandals will never diminish. The Net can never inculcate the real feeling of religious fervour in us, for the essence of the smells, sights and sounds that we associate with the Pujas will be missing in the realm of the virtual.

Debyani Basu,

 Birati

 This being vehemently the e-age, every aspect of our lives is being affected by new inventions and technology. From matchmaking, to job hunting, the Net is our constant help. And just like our idea of letter-writing has been replaced by e-mails, adda by chat sessions on the Net, it is inevitable that anjali at the pandals will be replaced by anjali on the Net. More and more people will opt for e-anjali in the future.

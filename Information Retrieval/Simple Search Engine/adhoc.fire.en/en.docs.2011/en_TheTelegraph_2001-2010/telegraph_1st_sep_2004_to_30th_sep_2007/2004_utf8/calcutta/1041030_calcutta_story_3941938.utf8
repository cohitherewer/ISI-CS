 Minister in a spot over arrest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The arrest of hatkata Dilip will certainly put transport minister Subhas Chakraborty in a tight spot during the district conference of the CPM in January. 

 Though Chakraborty on Friday dissociated himself both from the arrested criminal and national footballer Sasthi Duley, from whose house Dilip was picked up, his opponents in the party are ready to hound him on the issue. 

 Sources said Dilip was close to the son of an influential minister in North 24-Parganas. Dilip was one of the organisers of a Durga puja in Basak Bagan, Lake Town. The minister?s son had assured Dilip that he would persuade Governor Viren J. Shah to inaugurate the puja in 2002. But the governor cried off at the last moment. 

 Besides Chakraborty, some CPM functionaries will not let go a party MLA from North 24-Parganas who had reportedly provided shelter to Dilip after the district police launched a hunt for him. The MLA, a cohort of the minister, does not have a very clean image.

 The district police are aware that Dilip and his accomplices worked hard for CPM candidates during the municipal polls held on June 27. Dilip and his men reportedly ?terrorised? voters of Dum Dum, South Dum Dum and Rajarhat municipalities on the poll day in the presence of a minister and a newly-elected MP from the district. 

 The tide turned against Dilip after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee made his arrest a prestige issue. Dilip had reportedly fled to Bangladesh, but returned after being assured a ?safe shelter?.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without...

Eyeing the sun

Bet the sun and the sweat never felt better. After almost a week of dank depression 

there?s some cheer in the air. Quite an excuse to take a day off and celebrate 

with a picnic under clear blue skies, if you haven?t taken too many rainy days 

in the past week, that is. If the boss is not as relenting as the weather, sun 

your damp laundry and take a walk at an odd hour to feel better.

Painting the sky

Kite craze may be waning among the young and the trendy but it?s one of those 

simple pleasures of life that never fails to bring a smile. Do it after the others 

have flown and fallen ? perk up with a few colourful paper purchases post-Vishwakarma 

Puja! And if your imagination takes off, try catching a few out on a hot air balloon 

or a paraglide!

Going with the flow

Those endless rounds of steaming chai and piping pakoras to warm 

things up over, it?s time to chill with a little detox treatment. Yeah, we agree 

you?ve already had too much of washing up, but a day-long programme of living 

on just juices and all things liquid will help cleanse your system like no other. 

It could also erase those murky memories of mud and slush.

Giving some,taking more

Saris for pishima-kakima, kurtas for kaku-jethu, toys and 

toffees for Tukai-Bubai? as you go about ticking the endless list one by one and 

blowing up your precious Puja bonus part by part, it?s not all that selfish to 

spare a little thought for your own humble self. It might be good manners to accept 

your share of the booty with a gracious smile, and dropping loud hints about your 

likes and dislikes may just about make things easier for the taker as well as 

the giver.

Saying hello to Hutch

No, we aren?t pitching for the cell phone provider made famous by a Pug. We?re 

just urging you to set up a date with Owen Wilson (Hutch) and funny man Ben Stiller 

(Starsky), two police detectives assigned one tough case after the other in a 

1970s metropolis called Bay City. If the men don?t matter, go for Carmen Baywatch 

Electra, Hutch?s sexy girlfriend. Starsky and Hutch is showing at INOX 

(Forum and City Centre) and 89 Cinemas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 State panel accused of landfill

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A state-run organisation is the subject of an inquiry by the pollution watchdog for filling up a waterbody in the city. 

 Officials confirmed on Friday that the pollution control board is probing an allegation that the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC) was filling up a waterbody in Basakbagan, Lake Town. 

 The incident is making waves at Writers? Buildings, because this is the first time a government organisation has been accused of landfill. 

 ?We usually associate this kind of crime with private promoters. So, we have taken this case seriously,? said an official of the pollution board. ?How can we let a government body commit an illegal act?? he asked.

 The WBTIDC has erected a wall around the waterbody and is planning to set up an institute there. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had laid the foundation stone for the project in December 24, 2001. But construction is yet to begin, as some local people have objected to the WBTIDC?s move to fill up the huge waterbody.

 Pollution board law officer Biswajit Mukherjee has written to the WBTIDC managing director, requesting him ?not to make any attempt to fill up the waterbody?. 

 Mukherjee wrote: ?In pursuance of a public complaint received from the Society for Democratic Rights, the pollution control board caused an inspection at the site and it is observed that there is an attempt at filling up the waterbody in question.? 

 The Society for Democratic Rights has recently lodged a complaint with the board against the WBTIDC. This prompted an inspection by pollution board officials, who found the allegation ?partially true?.

 WBTIDC managing director Dhiman Mukherjee, on his part, told Metro he would investigate the charges himself. 

 ?I have not been informed by any of my colleagues about the incident. Still, I will inquire into the allegation and take up the issue with the transport department, if necessary,? Mukherjee said. 

 What sparked resentment among residents of Basakbagan was the death of two youths on September 12 after a portion of the wall around the waterbody collapsed on them. Residents alleged the wall was built on the waterbody and it collapsed after the base eroded.

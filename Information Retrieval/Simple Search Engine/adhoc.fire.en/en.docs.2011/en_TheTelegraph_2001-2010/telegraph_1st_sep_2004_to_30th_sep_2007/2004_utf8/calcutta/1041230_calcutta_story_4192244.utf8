The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Starry knights in ?04 sky

 (From top) Shah Rukh Khan, Irrfan, Saif 

Ai Khan, Abhishek Bachchan and Nana Patekar 

Phata poster nikla hero? Thankfully, 

Bollywood actors are no longer their shady caricatures on the film posters. Homework, 

method acting, professionalism ? it?s an all-new man?s world out there. And everyone?s 

invited. A forgotten Pankaj Kapoor does a Don Corleone that could make Brando 

proud, a struggling Abhishek Bachchan finds favour in a negative avatar and a 

macho Akshay Kumar goes crying to his screen wife. Bizarre, beautiful, brave, 

here go the top male performances of the year 2004?

Shah Rukh Khan ? He returned to school, languished in Pakistani jails for 

22 years and left Global Precipitation Measurement programme at NASA to light 

a bulb in a remote north Indian village. Amidst all that jazz, he gave voice to 

Mr Lajawab. Bollywood?s hero no. 1 continued to dictate terms at the national 

box-office and beyond but his non-star odyssey in Swades couldn?t take 

Charanpur to Champaner heights. 2005 should be a mixed bag too, with roles ranging 

from Amol Palekar to Karan Johar.

Akshay Kumar ? Gone are the days when his name in the credits meant five action 

scenes, three songs and four stunts. Leaving his Khiladi days well behind, 

Akki has been a versatile virtuoso dabbling in everything from comedy to villainy. 

While Raj Kumar Santoshi?s Khakee saw him play the funny man with a heart 

of gold, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi had Akshay the matchmaker with a twist, and 

finally Aitraaz put him in the dock as the ?accused husband?. While none 

of them was a leading role, Akshay went on to steal hearts and hits.

Abhishek Bachchan ? It took him more than 13 films to do a Zanjeer 

but more than his first bona fide hit in Dhoom, Abhishek Bachchan silenced 

every critic in town with his scorching portrayal of Lallan in Mani Ratnam?s Yuva. 

As the streetsmart small-time goon who dreams big and aims high, Abhishek packed 

in so much punch that the thud rang across every tinsel territory of the country. 

Shaad Saathiya Ali roped him in for Bunty Aur Babli, Rituparno Ghosh 

cast him for Antarmahal and Ram Gopal Varma made him do an Al Pacino in 

Sarkar.

Nana Patekar ? During every show in every town of the two-odd hour duration 

of Shimit Amin?s debut film, everyone watching waited with bated breath: when 

would Nana break into his Krantiveer mode? That moment never came in Ab 

Tak Chhappan. He didn?t yell, he didn?t preach, he didn?t even react when 

his wife was gunned down. At his restrained best, Nana shone through every frame 

of the Ram Gopal Varma production.

Saif Ali Khan ? It might have been more hate than love for Chhote Nawab off 

screen this summer, but when his Harry met Rani?s Sally on the big screen, it 

was time to say Hum Tum. From the girl-hater in the initial reels to the 

lovesick nomad in the middle to the mature lover in the end, Saif showed his immense 

growth as an actor. And the kisses in rain and shine? Well, he can easily give 

liplock lessons to the likes of Kareena and Shahid.

Hrithik Roshan ? Cutting down on his films drastically after a whole string 

of flops post-Kaho Naa? Pyar Hai, this man is strictly into quality management. 

And his only release this year has been Farhan Akhtar?s Lakshya. With a 

new look and some new steps, Hrithik soared to new heights playing the boy-becomes-man 

to the hilt. The film did average business at the box-office but the actor in 

Hrithik displayed an entire gamut of emotions ? when Preity leaves him, when father 

Boman Irani salutes him or when his comrade dies in front of him. 

Irrfan ? From afternoon television serials to Mira Nair, our Macbeth has come 

a long way. The thinking woman?s hero has never looked back since he stunned us 

all with his performance in Tigmanshu Dhulia?s Haasil. But it was with 

Vishal Bharadwaj?s Maqbool this year that Irrfan treaded uncharted territories, 

lending his intense eyes to the Bard?s vision. Whether it was playing second fiddle 

to Abbaji or making love to Nimmi or just brooding over his guilt, Irrfan was 

top notch as he broke the myth that only star sons with bulging biceps can make 

it in Bollywood.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mixed menu for mirth

IPSITA DEB, HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

Designer 

Preeti Jhawar held a pre-Diwali exhibition of Indian and western clothes at The 

Conclave near Beckbagan on Monday. The concept behind the collection is vintage. 

The look creates elegant attire that can be festive, classic, Oriental or Indian 

kitsch. 

 While the main colours used are kumkum red, candy pink, turquoise, ochre and fuschia, the brighter the better being the idea, the embroidery has been accentuated with old copper coins, zardosi, shells, wooden beads and patchwork in paisleys and abstracts.

?My inspiration comes from the kind of things you 

would find in your grandmother?s trunk, taking pieces from the past or 

changing new fabrics in a manner to create the antique look. The material used 

for embroidery may be broken, worked on, very vintage, burnt or look primitive. 

My aim is to give that sheen and combine elements with colour and fabric,? says 

Preeti.

 Her garments use mainly georgette, silk, cotton and linen. While the kurtas are priced Rs 3,000 and above, the saris come for between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000.

 Gem games

 Kanak Jewellers is celebrating its very first birthday from November 6 to November 10 at its Park Street showroom. 

 The store is known for its modern and ethnic range of platinum and gold jewellery with colourful gemstones. With lots of sparkles, there are three special offers going on.

 The first is the Disc-count scheme, just right for those who like a fun gamble. A fortune disk is rotated and stopped on any number. This figure is the percentage of discount on making charges of the jewellery chosen by the lucky shopper. 

 The Luck-lakh is a lucky draw with three prizes of Rs 100,000, Rs 51,000 and Rs 25,000 worth of jewellery. This is only to be played on Dhanteras. 

 The final surprise for customers is Each-one, which guarantees gifts for all buyers, be it diamond rings, gold or silver coins.

Birthday bites

 Tarun Kundu and Mumpy Mukherjee, mentally challenged children from Mentaid, started the festive week with a bang. They inaugurated the fourth outlet of Cakes, a confectionery chain, along with singer Usha Uthup.

 ?I could not think of celebrating my birthday in a better way,? smiled the effervescent Usha. 

 Tarun and Mumpy couldn?t have agreed more, presenting her with a handmade embroidered hand towel, a case for her eyeglasses and wrapping paper.

 The fourth outlet of the chain opened at 23A/23N/2, Diamond Harbour Road, Block B, New Alipore.

 Keeping the festive market in mind, the shop has introduced new items like special Diwali pastries such as Lemon Diyas, priced between Rs 15 and Rs 25, Diwali cakes between Rs 200 and Rs 250 and a wide range of gift hampers, Rs 200 onwards.

Budget binge

 Decide your menu for the evening and how much you would like to pay too?

 Though this might seem a most ludicrous proposition to most sound business minds, Cloud 9, the restobar at Astor hotel, has pulled off this rather unusual scheme. From Tuesday through Thursday, guests need only pay just as much as they feel the food is worth.

 ?Members of the restobar are loving this free hand and their opportunity to make heard their views on the food here,? explained Ravinder Palta, manager, Astor. 

 Once the guest has experienced the entire meal, he assesses not just the quality and taste of the food but also more intangible aspects of the evening, like ambience and service, before deciding how much he should cough up.

 ?Only if he?s totally satisfied does he pay the whole price, otherwise, he can deduct amounts for the factors he feels were missing,? added Palta.

 But loyal customers, who don?t want the charming nightclub to shut shop for shortage of funds might want to be fair about the quality while they are having fun.

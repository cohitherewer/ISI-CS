 A sparkling winter sky, a lush green expanse, the cream of Calcutta? Add to that a grand gourmet experience, some splendid hospitality, and you have the recipe for a perfect getaway on a lazy December day. And when all this is happening at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC), the pleasure trot so easily breaks into a canter. 

 The race course, situated in the heart of the city, was the venue for the Food Fiesta presented by The Telegraph and Eveready on Saturday.

 ?We are trying to attract more and more people to this place because we have a lot to offer to people in terms of variety and quality,? said B.B. Kohli, clerk of the course. ?The idea is to create awareness among the masses that RCTC is as good as any other place of entertainment in the city. In fact, it has got an edge over other places,? he added.

 And if Saturday?s response to the afternoon fiesta was any indication, RCTC could well emerge as the hot winter hangout. People started flocking to the venue well before race time, and the food stalls were where all the action was. If Kewpie?s dished out Bengali cuisine, Taaja?s, Veda and Gupta Brother?s churned out a wide Indian fare. Grilled Fish and Buffalo Chilli Chicken were some of the sought-after dishes.

 Tangerine and Twinkle Fung Shway provided a taste of Chinese and Thai cuisine. The Golden Fried Prawns, Chicken Siu Mai and Pork Spare Ribs went down well.

 If Just Desserts? provided the sinful sweets, Fosters and Smirnoff filled up the bar to wash down the festive helpings.

 The games? corner proved a popular appetiser with some simple fun tools. The Food Guide Stall was a big draw, with winners walking away with a copy of The Telegraph Food Guide.

 ?We will continue in our endeavour of providing variety to the people. On the whole it should be a perfect opportunity for people to socialise and network and go back home with memories of a day well spent,? said Kohli.

 ?The food and the game stalls have added to the vibrant atmosphere of the club. Now people will have another reason to come to RCTC even if they are not interested in races, quot; said Brijesh Sookhia, a regular at the races.

 Bangla beats

 It was Bangla Rock, Woodstock style. Well, maybe not quite. No fuss over seating arrangements. Just stand up straight and shout out loud or lounge on the grass and let the rhythm get you.

 Braving the December chill, a crowd of a few hundred gathered on Friday evening to hear their favourite bands belt out their best.

 It was just metal and music at the Bowlers? Den lawn where Bhoomi, Cactus and Lakkhichhara shared the stage for the first time.

 The Kalyani Black Label Bangla rock gig kicked off at 6 pm, with Bhoomi leading from the front. Songs like Aamar ki hobe and Tomar dekha nai re had everybody grooving to the Bangla beat. ?We will not get the rest of our fees if we leave without singing Tomar dekha nai re,? quipped a band member of Bhoomi after being showered with requests for their most popular number.

 Next, it was the turn of the relatively new kids on the rock block, Lakkhichhara, to get the crowds going. The large female fan brigade was seen latching on to every line of songs like Telephone, Mon amar kemon kemon kore and Lakkhichhara hoyechi.

 But some of the loudest cheers were reserved for last, with Cactus taking centre stage with their latest hit Rajar raja and old favourite Phirbe na.

 Sound check

 On Friday night, the spotlight at Someplace Else was on guest band Skinny Alley. After a three-minute sound check, and an hour-long performance by regulars Hip Pocket, the veteran gang took the stage amidst a host of SPE regulars. 

 And when Skinny Alley slipped in a few originals from their forthcoming album, between innovative cover versions, the pub crowd had it?s moments? worth. With Jayashree in the lead, numbers like Hard to forgive, Go figure and Who are you lingered long.

 X?mas mix 

 The Chandernagore lights, without which no Puja can be complete, have found their calling for Christmas, as well. On Friday, Dalhousie Institute (DI) on Jhowtala Road was all lit up with themes and patterns from the illumination capital of Bengal.

 The mood for the coming festive season was set on Saturday when the lawn came alive in a blaze of colours. ?Everyday something or the other would be happening at the club till New Year?s eve. This light-up is a prelude to the festive season,? said Hanan Ali, secretary of DI.

 There was a fashion show for the young ones where the kids strutted the stage in their fashionable best. While some preferred sticking to the theme of the evening and dressed up as Santa Claus, the others were happy showing off their glad rags.

 Matter, all in the mind

 SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

 The man behind the counter must tell 

 the customer what he wants to hear, but cleverly

 Vishikh is a dear colleague. The 

 other day, after work, I took a lift in his car. He asked 

 me if he could stop on the way to pick up a DVD player. 

 It was his car and he was doing me a favour; I couldn?t 

 have said no.

 We walked into a shop. The young 

 sales assistant was not overtly enthusiastic. Vishikh asked 

 him about brands of DVD players. All of them were reputed 

 brands. The top of the rung was at least Rs 2,000 dearer 

 than everything else.

 It was now time for the experiment... 

 Vishikh wanted to see the same scenes from Gadar 

 played on the same TV set through each of the DVD players 

 in turn. This turned out to be a physically demanding task 

 for the sales assistant. Let me first tell you the gadgets 

 he had to handle. One DVD of a three-hour-long movie called 

 Gadar. A bank of TV sets and three brands of DVD 

 players. He also had to contend with issues like plug points 

 and appropriate spaces to place the contending DVD players. 

 So one player got connected to a Japanese brand but the 

 other player was hooked on to a Korean favourite. The third 

 had an Indian companion. Vishikh was not happy (he works 

 in our R amp;D cell).

 I am not very sure which experimental 

 design Vishikh eventually employed. I was busy watching 

 Amisha over and over again. Vishikh came up to me and asked, 

 how important is a Rs 2,000 difference? I was mumbling, 

 when I realised that Vishikh was not waiting for my answer.

 The sales assistant had been maintaining 

 all along that there was no difference between the brands 

 except the price. His motive was not to quickly conclude 

 a sale so that he could attend to another customer; all 

 he wanted to do was avoid the effort, a physical one at 

 that. His is a daily wage contract that will last till Diwali.

 The shop owner was obviously keeping 

 an eye. He intervened at a crucial juncture: ?Sir, you are 

 comparing apples and oranges; one is a Rs 6,500-player and 

 the others are Rs 4,500 ones.? He left it at that. Vishikh 

 happily bought the top of the heap DVD player.

 The deal clincher: 

 Brand name or price tag? 

 Two days later, I myself decided 

 to buy a DVD player. I went to the same shop. The salesperson 

 was a different one, she was completely sold on the most 

 expensive brand. That made me very uncomfortable. I kept 

 fiddling with the cheaper brands.

 The shop owner again intervened. 

 He started with the same spiel about apples and oranges. 

 Then he looked at me and my unpolished shoes. That changed 

 the script. He leaned slightly towards me. His smile was 

 conspiratorial, his pitch barely above the level of a whisper. 

 And the dialogue was a Salim Javed masterpiece: Maal 

 ek hi hai, naam aur daam aap ki pasand.

 I left the shop as Vishikh, but 

 Rs 2,000 richer.

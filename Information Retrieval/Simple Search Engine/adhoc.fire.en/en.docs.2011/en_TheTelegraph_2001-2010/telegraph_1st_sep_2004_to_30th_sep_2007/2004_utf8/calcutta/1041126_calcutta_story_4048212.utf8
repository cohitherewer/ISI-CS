 A moral battle

 The nationalist movement in India, though founded on lofty ideals, was not completely free from its share of criticism either. Tagores well-known novel Chaar Adhyay was, in fact, the subject of much controversy when it raised some uncomfortable questions related to terrorism and subversive activities taking place in the name of nationalism. Aabhash?s stage presentation of the novel, however, does not stop short at merely spelling out the negative aspects of the Indian freedom struggle. Scripted and directed by Sekhar Samaddar, the play universalises the theme of violence to make it relevant in the modern context. What makes this production all the more remarkable is the way in which it blends the romantic element of the original story with the main action to provide a poignant perspective of the emotional and spiritual struggles that women constantly have to face. Ela, who is inspired by the philosophy and ethics of Indranath and subsequently falls in love with Atin, the proud romantic, epitomises the modern woman who is self-conscious and intelligent, yet in the throes of a moral dilemma.

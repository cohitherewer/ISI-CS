The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Focus: trade, social boost

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From the customary visit to the Missionaries of Charity to an interaction with members of the Ficci Ladies Organisation, a slice of authentic Bengali cuisine at Kewpie?s to a luncheon engagement with Jyoti Basu ? the French senators plan to pack in a lot into their three-day sojourn in town.

 The delegation of six senators, led by Xavier de Villepin, senator representing French expatriates, and Pierre Fauchon, president of the Senate India-France Friendship Group, will visit Calcutta from Thursday to Sunday to further social and economic ties with the state.

 Courtesy calls lined up include a trip to the Governor House and meetings with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industry minister Nirupam Sen, IT minister Manab Mukherjee and mayor Subrata Mukherjee. It is understood the French senators will explore cooperation possibilities in the areas of information technology, education and food processing.

 ?This is the first time in a decade that such a high-powered French delegation will be touching down in Calcutta and we sincerely hope the visit will lead to concrete alliances in a number of sectors, besides boosting people-to-people ties, quot; said M.K. Jalan, French honorary consul in the city.

 ?The idea of this visit follows the presentation on business opportunities in West Bengal made to the French Senate (Upper House) France-India Friendship Group in Paris last November by Mr Jalan,? according to Francois Goldblatt, charge d?affaires, Embassy of France in India. Goldblatt has written to the chief minister and Governor Viren J. Shah, seeking appointments.

 Senators Villepin and Fauchon will be accompanied by Yolande Boyer, Philippe Nogrix, Jean-Pierre Plancade, Michel Doublet and Jean-Dominique Nuttens, chief administrator of the Senate. Examining the ?specificity of the policies in Bengal?, particularly on the economic and social level, will be the prime focus of the visitors.

 An interactive session with the Indian Chamber of Commerce and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation on Saturday with presentations on IT, agro and food-processing sectors will be addressed by Manab Mukherjee, while a meeting with Sen and the WBIDC chairman is scheduled for the evening. A visit to Sector V in Salt Lake and a presentation on Rajarhat are also on the French menu.

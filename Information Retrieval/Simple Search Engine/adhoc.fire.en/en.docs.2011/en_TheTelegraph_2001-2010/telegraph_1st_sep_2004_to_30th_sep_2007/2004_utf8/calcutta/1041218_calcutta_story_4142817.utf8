The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court rap for power theft slur

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Friday hauled up CESC for harassing a consumer on a false charge of pilfering power by manipulating his meter.

 Justice Subhra Kamal Mukherjee directed the private power utility to refund Rs 75,000 it had collected from the consumer, with interest, within two weeks.

 The judge criticised the CESC lawyer for his absence during the hearing. While passing the order, he asked CESC to be ?careful about levelling charges against a consumer?.

 In August 2003, CESC snapped the power supply of Abdul Rahim, a trader and resident of Beniapukur, for failing to pay Rs 1.13 lakh for allegedly ?stealing power through an aperture? at the top of the meter. Rahim moved court through his lawyer Swapan Mallik, challenging CESC. 

 The judge asked the petitioner to deposit Rs 75,000 to CESC and sent the meter to be tested by the department of metallurgy, Jadavpur University. After the money was paid, CESC restored power supply from November 13, 2003. 

 The departmental head, on July 3, 2004, placed his report before the court, stating that the meter was fault-free. 

 On the basis of this report, the court was about to a pass an order. But CESC lawyer Subir Sanyal told the court that the university had informed his client that it will furnish a new report. On Friday, when the matter was heard, the CESC lawyer was absent.

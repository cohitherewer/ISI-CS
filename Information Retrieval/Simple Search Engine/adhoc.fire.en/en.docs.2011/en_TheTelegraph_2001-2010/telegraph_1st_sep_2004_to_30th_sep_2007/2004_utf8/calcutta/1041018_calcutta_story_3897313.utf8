The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Every role has to offer some new challenge?

 Raga 

 During her trip to the city to celebrate Kaifi Azmi day, actress Shabana Azmi spoke to Pratim D. Gupta about her forthcoming films, the path Indian cinema is on and her special connection with Calcutta...

 Why do we see so little of 

 you on the big screen these days? Have you decided to work 

 only with big names?

 Throughout my career I have worked with the maximum number of new directors. There is no one fixed criterion for selecting a film, though. The selection process can happen in various ways, but the script has to be recommended. I will be frank ? the chances of me reading just about any script are very slim. The covering letter has to be interesting. Handwritten scripts won?t do. Again, not that it has to be spirally bound. I should be able to read it. Then I usually have a meeting with the director. He may not be very articulate ? most articulate people are glib and the most inarticulate ones often turn out to be really talented. The process between the director and me should be more like osmosis. Of course the project and the producer have to be sound. And most importantly, the role has to interest me, offer some new challenge.

 What made you sign Mahesh 

 Dattani?s Morning Raga?

 I have always been very curious about Mahesh?s work. I have seen a couple of his plays and found them to be very interesting. There are a lot of layers and subtexts in his characterisations. And even his script was not the typical comic type that is being made everywhere now.

 But you didn?t say yes straightaway?

 No I didn?t. After the script (bound, of course) arrived, I called Mahesh up and asked him a lot of questions and I found that he was more than willing to answer them. He was ready to go through the whole process where Perizaad (Zorabian), Prakash (Rao) and I were allowed to interact amongst ourselves as professionally trained actors. So I could sense the possibility of a process of discovery through the film.

 You had no problems playing 

 a Carnatic singer, being from up north?

 When I first heard the music, I was terrified. How in the world will I be able to lip-sync such difficult songs? Being from the north, it was an unfamiliar discipline for me. That I was terrified proved to be a challenge for me. That?s so typical of me. So I decided ? let?s do it.

 What kind of homework did 

 you do for the film?

 Oh God, a lot of homework. First I got hold of videos of Carnatic singers. Fortunately a lot were available. Then I went through vigorous training. A young woman named Ranjini who is a violinist and plays my friend in the film helped me out immensely. I had to get the body language correct.

 What was it like working 

 with someone from theatre?

 Since Mahesh is a writer himself, he understands the process of inhabiting a character, that it can be a very daunting prospect. Coming from theatre, he also enjoys the process of rehearsal. The unit overall was a very happy one. Then, Perizaad and I got along very well too.

 The initial reaction to Morning 

 Raga has been quite incredible?

 Oh yes! Aparna (Sen) and Rekha have seen the film and liked it. Alka Yagnik and Anup Jalota have told me that even they couldn?t have done the last swaram in the film. My mother, who has been my fiercest critic, has seen the film three times and has confessed she is following my career again as minutely as she did during the Ankur days. My brother who never watches my films has loved Morning Raga. More importantly, different age groups have reacted positively. The music is astounding ? fusion in the true sense of the term. The basic story too has so much potential of a mother rediscovering her son through music. The film should do very well commercially, if it is marketed well.

 Are you happy with the way 

 Indian cinema is shaping up?

 Indian film producers have realised that there is no pan-Indian audience for a film. So, catering to the lowest common denominator, from Mumbai to Jhumritalaiya, has stopped happening. Fifty per cent of the population is below 25 and with the kind of urbanisation that is happening, it?s young urban people who go to watch the movies. So different kinds of films are being made for different kinds of people. We are in a transition phase where some good films are emerging.

 You have done a Hollywood 

 film named Waterborne...

 It is about a terrorist threat to the water system in Los Angeles. I play a Sikh woman who becomes a victim of a hate-crime. Then there is a realisation in the woman who bids for peace and reconciliation. I think, post 9/11 and the Gujarat riots, we should keep talking about reconciliation and healing or the wounds might lead to yet another episode.

 Are you doing Rituparno Ghosh?s 

 film where you play Amitabh Bachchan?s wife?

 I don?t know. Ritu spoke to me and I said yes, I?ll do the film. But the producers never contacted me.

 Why are you not in Water 

 with Deepa Mehta doing it again as River Moon?

 Let?s just say that we mutually agreed that I shouldn?t do the film.

 Why haven?t you done another 

 Bengali film after Sati?

 Oh I can?t do a film in a language I do not know. In Sati I played a mute character. I am terrified of doing films in another language. It needs raw guts to do a film in an alien language.

 How special is Calcutta to 

 you?

 I?ll tell you something that happened to me in this city. Several years ago I was having food at a restaurant when a waiter came up to me and said, ?You are Kaifi Azmi?s daughter right? Can I touch your hands? Many years ago when I had felt very despondent and tired with life, the power of your father?s poetry got me exhilarated all over again.? Now, something like that can only happen in Calcutta?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Beat beyond boundaries 

 Puja music is now as much about dhak and dhol as about guitar and drums. And the spotlight is on the Bangla bands, big time. From roadshows to foreign tours, the trademark sounds flow everywhere from Bengal to Boston this October. Here?s looking at the famous five:

 Bhoomi

 Kicking off the storm on Mahalaya 

 eve, the popular folk music band (in picture above) left 

 for a one-month, five-city American tour. ?We?ll be performing 

 at Boston, New York, Atlanta, Dallas and Sacramento,? said 

 lead vocalist Surajit Chatterjee. ?The shows were largely 

 a result of the positive response to our performance in 

 the US last year. It?s so much fun watching the Bengali 

 kids there who can?t even speak Bengali but freak out on 

 Tomar dekha nai?? Back home, Bhoomi?s new 10-song 

 album Dekhte Dekhte may be released under the HMV 

 label even while the south Calcutta boys rock the US.

 Cactus

 The last three Pujas were spent enthralling Bengalis in Delhi. But not this week. ?We had to be in Calcutta this time,? says lead vocalist Siddhartha (better known as Sidhu). 

 ?Then we also got a very high-profile Ashtami show at Hiland Park and a Dashami show at Survey Park. So we?ll have a whole lot of fun this Puja performing with our sound-and-light set up.? On the album front, the long overdue Rajar Raja, mixed and mastered by star recordist Bishwadeep Chatterjee, is almost ready for release.

 Fossils

 Daily roadshows and a show at Haldia on Ashtami are happening, but the stress is definitely on the new album, which has managed to create quite a buzz. Mastered in the American studios, the first lot of the album simply titled Fossils 2 has already sold out, without a formal launch. Says lead singer Rupam: ?Nobody has heard this kind of hard rock in Bangla music. We plan to launch the album in a big way soon.?

 Chandrabindoo

 It doesn?t get more hectic than this ? Mahalaya in Siliguri, Tritiya in Hyderabad, Sashthi in Delhi, Saptami in Jaipur, Ashtami and Nabami again in Delhi. ?Yes, it will be a whole lot of fun but there is that sense of sadness for not being able to be in Calcutta during the Pujas,? said lead vocalist Anindya Chatterjee.

 The band has just released its first VCD titled Chandrabindaas and also a special animation video of the hit Juju track. Next up, a reconstruction of the band?s first album, this November.

 Lakkhichhara

 Roadshows rule the band?s Puja plans but the clincher is definitely the circuit house show at Jamshedpur to kick off the Puja celebrations there. ?Most of us being from South Point school, we always end up having a blast at Durgabari nearby,? said keyboardist Debaditta. 

 ?But the roadshows will be real fun as we?ll be mainly freaking out with kids in every para.? On the racks, Jibon Chaichhe Aaro Beshi is still selling very well, while the next album is slated for Poila Baisakh.

 Call of culinary explorer

 The big wooden gate has given way to a smarter one with a liveried guard in alert attendance. The old-world charm has given way to a modern d?cor with dim lights and artificial plants. Solid wooden seating has been replaced by easy chairs and cosy corners. The high ceiling space has lost out to a basement-like hole and a first-floor dining hall.

 The address is the same (24 Park Street); all else has changed. Exit, good ol? Waldorf (now in a smaller avatar on Russell Street); enter, Marco Polo in China.

 Yes, the multi-cuisine culinary stop on Sarat Bose Road has just arrived on Park Street, and brought with it a bit of China ? d?cor, ambience, kitchen and all.

 Marco Polo in China, capable of seating 154 diners at a go, was thrown open to food buffs on Friday.

 ?Everything, except the address, has changed. The d?cor and menu have been done ab inito,? explains Kallol Banerjee, manager of Marco Polo in China.

 Will dishing it out on Park Street be very different from doing food business on Sarat Bose Road? ?Park Street remains the food hub of the city, and we will be providing fine-dining facilities with true customer care,? says Banerjee.

 As for the cuisine chosen for Park Street, it could well be the starting point of an elaboration on the Marco Polo theme. ?Marco Polo spent six years in China? We want to give Calcuttans a taste of all the recipes he picked up during his stay there. For our next restaurant, the theme could be another place that he visited,? reveals the manager at 24 Park Street.

 The prices could look steep, but sufficient quantity should make up for that, promises Banerjee.

 And what?s recommended? For starters, 

 American Corn Pepper Salt or Pan-Fried Chilli Fish or Golden 

 Fried Prawns (Rs 280). Next, the soup list, where there?s 

 Green Asparagus and Mushroom Cream Soup or Seafood Coriander 

 Thick Soup. As for the main course, the lobster and the 

 pomfrets set up the real biggie: Prawn in Schezwan Chilli 

 Pickle (Rs 330).

 One word of dry-throat caution: 

 the liquor licence is yet to flow through.

 Cal chromosome: Ashtami 

 anjali on Indrani itinerary

 Be not misled by her Bengali surname. 

 For Delhi is more close to Indrani Dasgupta?s heart than 

 Calcutta where she drops in several times a year for work 

 or for relatives. ?My memories of Durga Puja in Calcutta 

 are of people milling around everywhere... I was very small 

 then and remember feeling lost and scared,? smiled Indrani, 

 after sashaying through the Satya Paul show last weekend. 

 But come Pujas, and you are sure to catch her hopping over 

 to a pandal at CR Park in Delhi for her Ashtami anjali! 

 That?s as close as it gets to the real thing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 It happens faster than you can rattle off his full name. Even as Bourne Supremacy, the sequel to the hit Matt Damon-starrer Bourne Identity releases in city theatres (INOX, 89 Cinemas, New Empire), talks are on for a third part to the espionage thriller series. And all this after Matt had once dismissed the idea of a follow-up to the 2002 original, which earned more than $210 million worldwide.

 Based on the series of novels by Robert Ludlum, Bourne Supremacy has already totalled $165 million in North American theatres. The films revolve around Jason Bourne, played by Matt, an American assassin beset by amnesia and nightmares of a past life. Now that both films have worked at the box-office, the production of the third part, Bourne Ultimatum, should get going in no time.

 For the reel-life superhero, however, real-life terror is too hot to handle. Matt cancelled the Bourne Supremacy promotional tour to Moscow ?in connection with the latest events in the country?. The film?s producer and top managers of Paramount and United International Pictures were supposed to visit Moscow together with the actor but all the festivities were called off.

 There?s good news on the family front though for Matt with his 70-year-old uncle becoming the oldest person to swim the English Channel. George Brunstad arrived on the French coast in the early hours on Sunday after a gruelling 21-mile swim. The swim took 15 hours and 59 minutes and Brunstad, a champion swimmer who had trained for the challenge for a year, snatched the record from a 67-year-old.

Katrina Kaif: Return route

 Never mind that her first stint with acting didn?t quite Boom at the box-office. Katrina Kaif has got herself two of the most plum assignments in tinsel town. The beautiful half-Brit half-Kashmiri model who is wooed these days by Chhote Nawab (Saif Ali Khan, for the uninformed) in an advertisement, is really signing on the right dotted lines.

 The model hasn?t had the best of times in Bollywood. She was out of a Mukesh Bhatt production because she couldn?t mouth Hindi dialogues. Again, in the recent past, she was shown the door in Suneel Darshan?s Barsaat due to a dispute over the number of songs picturised on her in the film.

 But all that is now a thing of the past as Katrina gets ready to take tinsel town by storm. First up will be the David Dhawan remake of the 1969 Walter Mathau comedy Cactus Flower, where she stars with Salman Khan, Sushmita Sen and Arshad Warsi. Going by the success of the last Salman-David jodi in Mujhse Shaadi Karogi ? coupled with the filmi tattle about how Salman is hard at work memorising those three words to coo into Katrina?s ears, off-screen ? the film should see a grand opening.

 Then, of course, comes the big one. A Ram Gopal Varma film co-starring both the Bachchans. Over the past week, the rumour mills have been working overtime claiming that Katrina is the latest inclusion in the cast of Sarkar, Varma?s take on the Coppola classic, The Godfather.

 When Metro contacted Katrina, she said: ?Yes, I am doing the film?. The excitement of playing a ?foreign-returned girl? in the film opposite Abhishek and sharing screen space with the Big B was unmissable. Diane Keaton, anyone?

Goopy and Bagha: Still in favour

 The Bengali film festival at INOX City Centre titled Shera Cinema is going great guns. Into its second week now, the turnout is improving by the day. The festival, which started with Pather Panchali, is now bringing a mix of the funny and the sombre in its second week line-up. Aimed at both the aged and the young, the selection of films should bring in both the popcorns and the jholas.

 The ever-popular duo of Goopy and Bagha returns to the big screen with not one but two films ? Satyajit Ray?s Hirak Rajar Deshe and Sandip Ray?s Goopy Bagha Phire Elo. If Gyne and Byne are in town, can Prodosh C. Mitter be far behind? Feluda?s adventures at Sonar Kella, in the heart of Rajasthan, will be screened on Saturday.

 If these films do not provide enough food for thought, the genius of Ritwik Ghatak will come alive on the multiplex screen with Jukti Takko Gappo. Then there?s Raja Mitra?s little-seen Nayantara, followed by Mrinal Sen who wraps up the festival with his Ek Din Protidin.

 So get set to go and dedicate the week to the Rays, Sen and Ghatak.

 The missive is peace, the mission Tagore. And what better date than the evening of 9/11? At Rabindra Sadan, a soiree marks the launch of Hutch Anandadhara, a compilation of 12 Tagore tracks. 

 All nine singers who lent their voices to the album are slated to perform at the concert. The album features the likes of Bala Murali Krishnan, Manna De, Yesudas and Shubha Mudgal.

 Supported by the cell phone major, musicians from Bengal and Bangladesh ? Indranil Sen, Iffat Ara Dewan, Sanjeeda Khatoun, Laisa Ahmed Lisa and Aditi Mohsin ? have also rendered a few scores.

 ?Songs carrying a peace message have been picked from Swadesh and Puja porjays (segments). We had sent cassettes to them and everybody from Bala Murali Krishnan to Shubha Mudgal have stuck to the original notations. But they have rendered the songs in their own unique styles which has given the album a different flavour,? says Indranil Sen, who undertook the project as a fundraiser for Rotary Club of Calcutta Metropolitan and Rotary Club of Metropolitan Dhaka.

 So, tune in to Bala Murali Krishnan for Anandaloke mongolaloke and Aguner parashmoni, Yesudas for Aaji joto tara tabo akashe, Manna De for Alokerei jhorna dharay and Shubha Mudgal for Prano bhoriye trisha horiye.

 Proceeds will go to Tollygunge Cheshire Home, Santiniketan Shishu Tirtha and High Care.

 The City Diary

 The division bench of Justice Amitava Lala and Justice P.K. Deb of the high court on Thursday rejected the bail petitions of Surendra Kumar Agarwal, owner of a Bandel nursing home, and his assistant Mumtaz Begum. Both were arrested in connection with the murder of gynaecologist Susil Pal. The petitioners? lawyers said the two had been framed. But public prosecutor Kazi Shafiullah contended that both were involved in a conspiracy to kill Pal. He argued that releasing the two on bail will affect the investigation. 

 nspector-general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty said on Thursday that the baby boy of Piyali Das, also arrested in connection with the murder, has been suffering from a common cold. The baby, taken into custody along with the mother, has been admitted to Chittaranjan Seva Sadan.

 An explosion caused by an electrical short-circuit marred the pre-Puja shopping spree at Gokul?s, on Chowringhee Road, opposite Rabindra Sadan Metro station, on Thursday evening.

The shoppers jostled with one another to leave the mart and many tripped and injured themselves,? said eyewitness Kalyan Haldar. 

 The high court on Thursday passed an injunction on the appointment of a director of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI). The government had recently published an advertisement in newspapers for the appointment. A cancer patient had filed a petition, challenging the decision to invite applications from non-oncologists as well. 

 he division bench of Justice A. Kabir and Justice A.K. Bishi stated that no appointment could be made on the basis of an advertisement. Instead, the government should obey the Supreme Court?s guidelines, which specify that a qualified oncologist from a panel of five must be appointed to the post.

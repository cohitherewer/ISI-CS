 Pre-school, playschool... the age bar dips

 Time for school already? A Telegraph picture

 When does one send ones child to school? On Montessori Day, that is a question looming large over parents. 

 Even a decade ago, children would be sent to school at three-and-a-half. But the bar is dipping, and fast. 

 With mainstream schools taking in kids between two and two-and-a-half years, playschools, a new-age pre-school appendage, are lowering their admission ages. 

 There is no Board under which toddler education falls. So there is no standardisation. Till the early 90s, the admission age in Class I was six-plus. Now, in most schools it has been made five-plus. Our nursery, therefore, is taking in children a little earlier at two-and-a-half years, says Madhu Kohli, principal of South Point School.

 This is pushing children to the Montessoris even earlier. While for most, one-and- a-half years is the coming-out age, there is a playschool in Alipore, Gymbaroo, that is open to 10-month-olds. 

 We provide a stimulating environment, not available at home, in which the mother can spend quality time with her child, explains Vandana Sethi, supervisor of Gymbaroo. Admitting that kids never went to school this early, Sethi says kids today are a brighter lot and their energies need to be channelised.

 But a bigger need, perhaps, is to cross the admission hurdle. No mainstream school admits a child unless he has been to a playschool. Otherwise, they say they find it difficult to cope with a child, complains Sarottama Majumdar, mother of two-year-10-month-old Pragya. To get into the best school, one tries to get the child to the best pre-school. So Pragya has to trudge all the way from Kudghat to a Lake Gardens Montessori.

 As soon as a child can walk and talk, parents are asking around where to send them. This demand, induced by peer pressure and convenience, is creating the supply, explains Shalini Sunderlal, of the Academy of Progressive Montessori, which has started the citys first course for teachers dealing with kids from birth to two years of age.

 In a pre-school, children get toilet-trained, learn to trust people outside home and interact with others of the same age, points out Nandita Agarwal of Prerna Montessori. But in the absence of a curriculum, many pre-schools do not know what to do with them. 

 One should just create the environment and leave the child to learn at his own pace. But many playschools start to teach them before they are ready, she adds.

 In the rat race, the playway method is taking a backseat in many Montessoris. They start pattern-writing and counting before they reach nursery school. So they have to repeat the same lessons for months when they enter school, says psychologist Saloni Priya. As a result, kids lose the interest to learn and by the time they are 10, they are back-benchers.

 This is not all. Parents are taking two-year-olds for tuitions. Word goes around about a former teacher of a mainstream school offering coaching classes and promising success in admission tests, and everyone flocks there, says Sethi of Gymbaroo.

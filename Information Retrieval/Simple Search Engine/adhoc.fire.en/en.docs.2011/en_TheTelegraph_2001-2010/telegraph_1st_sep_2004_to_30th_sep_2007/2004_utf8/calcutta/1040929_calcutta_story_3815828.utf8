 Hospital fan falls on guest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 62-year-old woman was seriously injured and rendered senseless after a ceiling fan crashed on her head at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, in Beleghata, on Monday evening. 

 The woman had come from Burdwan to meet her ailing son Biswajit Sarkar. She was immediately admitted to the hospital, and doctors worked on supportive treatment through the night.

 On Tuesday morning, when the woman continued to complain of pain, doctors were forced to carry out an MRI scan and keep her under constant care till her condition improved. She is said to be responding to treatment.

 According to hospital sources, Biswajit was admitted a few days ago after being diagnosed with meningitis. Two days ago, he was shifted to one of the cabins in the hospital.

 On Monday, his mother arrived around 5 pm and was talking to her son when suddenly, the fan fell on her. Other visitors raised an alarm, and doctors were called in. Biswajit?s mother was shifted from her son?s cabin and admitted.

 The hospital authorities tried to make light of the incident. Dr S.K. Biswas, superintendent, claimed the woman was ?fine?. The authorities have refused to lodge a complaint with the local police, even though that is the rule.

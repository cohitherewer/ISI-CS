 Carry a single book to school

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Children weighed down by their daily burden 

 How much does your child?s schoolbag weigh? We seldom give a thought to the subject even as we rue the sight of the little ones lugging their bags along.

 Here is the answer. A school bag weighs around 4-5 kg even for primary school students. And a solution to the problem seems to be at hand with publisher Orient Longman introducing a novel concept.

 Under the Sangam National Term Book scheme, students will have to carry one book to book. The same book will contain four subjects ? English, mathematics, social studies and science. The book will change every term. ?We have brought out 15 books, with three books for every year for Classes I to V,? said Sonali Sengupta, regional manager, east, Orient Longman, at the launch of the series at a city hotel.

 The books have already been well-received in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Pondicherry. 

 Dr Apurba Nandi of Institute of Child Health and former head of the paediatric surgery department at Nilratan Sircar Hospital, explained how risky it was to allow children to carry the burden. ?The spine is flexible. Pressure can lead to scoliosis or kyphosis, problems of bending. The nerves running through the spinal chord may also suffer. Another vulnerable area is the shoulders, regular pressure on which can cause permanent damage,? he said, adding how the number of children coming to him with such complaints was on the rise. ?I give them pain-killers and exercises, but it is best if the root cause ? the heavy schoolbag ? is removed.? 

 B. Nagalakshmi, a member of the series editorial board, said that the books were produced in tune with NCERT regulations, and therefore would be nationally acceptable.

 The idea, no doubt, is welcome. Whether the schools here are ready to introduce the books is the weighty question.

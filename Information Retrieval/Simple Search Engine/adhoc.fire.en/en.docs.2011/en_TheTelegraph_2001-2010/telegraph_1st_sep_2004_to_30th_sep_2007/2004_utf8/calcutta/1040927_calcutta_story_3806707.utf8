 Twin flyover flanks for faster car flow

 SWATI SENGUPTA 

 The fast lane is all set to welcome more traffic with open arms. 

 With the car count in fast forward on the AJC Bose Road flyover, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government now plans to add two arms, or fast lanes, to it, at a cost of Rs 34 crore. 

 Already, a technical feasibility study has been undertaken by the authorities of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) to determine the viability of adding two ramps to the flyover, state transport department secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Sunday. 

 ?This was part of the original plan of the AJC Bose Road flyover, and I am not quite sure why it was never executed. We are now conducting a study to check the possibility of adding the two ramps to the completed flyover,? he added.

 One of the proposed arms ? an approach ramp ? is to rise from the Sarat Bose Road side and lead up to the AJC Bose Road flyover. 

 The other ? an exit ramp ? will descend from the now-completed flyover and lead towards the Mullickbazar end of AJC Bose Road. 

 The ramps are proposed to be added to the flyover, constructed over a period of 29 months and four days, with a loan from the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC). 

 Each ramp is likely to be around 250 metres long and six metres wide, costing an estimated Rs 17 crore. 

 The Yachio Engineering Company (YEC), a technical consultant, had been ?informally requested earlier? to examine the feasibility of constructing the two ramps and a preliminary study was made. 

 ?Though the plan did not work out then, the government is now doing a rethink on the two ramps, with a huge increase in traffic volume and for the convenience of people who want to go either towards the Sealdah side or take the flyover route from the Sarat Bose Road end,? transport secretary Chowdhury said.

 The preliminary study of the HRBC held the exit ramp towards Mullickbazar as a viable proposition. A detailed study is now awaited. Some finetuning of the carriageway width is necessary. 

 Initially, however, the HRBC authorities had pronounced that there would be some problems with the approach ramp from the Sarat Bose Road end. The design was, thus, altered, and the present study is now based on a drawing that bypasses these stumbling blocks ? buildings on the Sarat Bose Road-AJC Bose Road crossing.

 OUR BUREAU

 The police on Friday registered FIRs against nine lawyers in connection with the fake marksheet scam. ?The lawyers are accused of using fake marksheets. They have been charged with forgery,? said Rajiv Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central). 

 According to sources, two of the accused practise in the high court, while a third runs a solicitor?s firm.

 The complaint against the lawyers was lodged by Pinaki Ranjan Bannerjee, office secretary of the West Bengal Bar Council. An officer of Jorasanko police station came to the council office and recorded the complaint.

 ?We?re assisting police in their investigation. An inquiry committee, set up by the council, has identified nine lawyers who had placed forged documents with the council,? said Saradindu Biswas, senior executive committee member.

 One of the accused was enrolled with Incorporated Law Society and the rest were members of various bar associations.

 Twelve persons have so far been arrested in connection with the fake marksheet racket. On Tuesday, Debashish Pal, owner of St Mary?s Correspondence College, was arrested in Dum Dum, following a raid on his institute. 

 Police have seized fake marksheets and admit cards bearing the seals of various universities, including Bhagalpur University and Bihar Intermediate Council, from Pal?s college. 

 Investigations revealed that Pal had been running the college for quite a while, promising many in and around Barasat certificates in junior basic training and then duping them with forged documents. 

 Pal would collect the forged marksheets from Sukhdeo Kumar, who owned a press in Budhmarg, Patna.

 Binge on bhog

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 'My diet goes for a toss during the Puja days thanks to the sumptuous bhog 

prepared at our barir pujo by my many many grandmothers and thakurs. I look forward 

to the bhog platter to gorge on Luchi, Chhanar Dalna, Phulkopir Dalna, Chhoka. 

I cant stop!' Koel Mullick

One of the enduring flavours of Durga puja is the bhog ? steaming-hot khichuri and tongue-burning purer bhaaja or mutton curry minus onion and garlic and the yummy payesh filled with cashewnuts and raisins.

 It might look like the easiest thing to put on the Puja platter, but the rules of the kitchen game are strict enough to ensure that if the norms are nullified the food for the deity does not even make the bhog grade.

 ?To begin, it has to be cooked by either a Brahmin man or woman, or someone who?s received diksha from a religious guru,? says pandit Nitai Chokroborty.

 A wash and a change of clothes are mandatory for those wanting to stir up the food for the gods. ?While cooking, the person is not allowed to speak, eat, drink or even attend to the call of nature,? adds Chokroborty.

 Khichuri is the favourite bhog option not just because it?s the fastest thing to cook. The colour is vital too ? ?yellow is the colour of sunshine and wealth?.

 On Navami, the mutton must be cooked without onion and garlic. ?It?s believed that the mutton cooked after the boli (offering) will taste good, no matter what it?s cooked with,? says Chokroborty. 

 Family feast

 The Mullickbari at Bhowanipore follows the no-non-vegetarian and no-rice regimen of the Baishnab parampara for the four days, followed by the mangsho-bhog on Dashami.

 The elaborate daily offerings include 17 types of naibidya (fruits, sweets and all) and a special home-cooked kheer. For lunch and dinner there is Luchi, Chhanar Dalna, Chhoka, Phoolkopir Dalna and a range of Bengali delicacies.

 ?Though we eat the same items all through the year, the taste of bhog is invariably different,? says Dr Dinesh Chandra Mullick.

 From the 88-year-old to the youngest member of the extended Mullick family, Dashami is the meal to really look forward to. ?This is the only day when we are allowed to eat mangsho-bhaat,? smiles Madhuchanda Ganguly, a daughter of the family.

 Post-immersion, the liver curry has remained the speciality on the Mullickbari menu at the annapurna dalaan.

 Taste of today

 Take the CA Block Sarbojonin Durgostav, Salt Lake, now in its 26th year.

 ?The bhog cooked for the puja is never enough for the huge number of people who troop in, so the food for the lunch is cooked separately,? says Jayjit Biswas, convenor of the block?s cultural committee.

 With 700 to 800 plates being filled, the venue for the sit-down lunch has had to be shifted to classrooms of the nearby Salt Lake School in the block. The popular bhog pick: mutton curry and rice on Navami, but with onion and garlic.

 Do it yourself

 Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpie?s tells you how to rustle up Pathar Jhol for four-to-six grumbling gastronomes?

 Ingredients:

500 grams of patha or mutton, 1 tsp turmeric 

powder, 1 tsp ginger paste, 1 tsp chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin powder, 1/4 tsp pepper, 

1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 350 gm steamed and cubed potatoes, 1/4 coconut with 

upper skin removed and chopped into small pieces, 1 tsp whole cumin seeds, 

6 to 8 green chillies, 21/2 tsp mustard oil, 1/2 tbs ghee, 3 cups water.

 Method:

Marinate the mutton in 21/2 tbs of mustard oil, turmeric 

powder, salt and pepper for half an hour. In three cups of water, add the powdered 

masalas. Bring the water to boil and add salt and sugar. Boil for five 

minutes, lower heat and keep on the fire for another five to seven minutes. Add 

green chillies slit down the middle and simmer for a few more minutes allowing 

the flavour of the chillies to spread. Add the meat now and cook till it?s three-fourths 

done. Heat 2 tbs of oil and fry the potatoes till golden yellow. Add the meat 

and cook till done.

 In a separate pan, heat the ghee and add the whole cumin seeds and coconut pieces till the coconut is golden yellow in colour. Pour the contents on the cooked meat. Serve with plain rice.

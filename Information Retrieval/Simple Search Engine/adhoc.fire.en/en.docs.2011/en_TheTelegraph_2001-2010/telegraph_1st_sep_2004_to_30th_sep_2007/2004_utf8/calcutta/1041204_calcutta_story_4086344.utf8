 Kareena Kapoor: Popular pick

 Mobile mania is at its best and everyone?s making the most of it. Come Saturday and watching a movie on MAX will mean much more than just an exciting viewing experience. You will be able to download the ringtone of a song as you see it play on television. Singtone, as the service has been named, will not limit itself to current popular songs, but also classics from yesteryears.

 ?Singtone is yet another interactive innovation from MAX and is aimed at delivering on the channel?s promise of Deewana Bana De,? said N.P. Singh, business head, MAX.

 Viewers have to send an SMS to 2525 with ?RT Songcode? as the message, where Songcode will be the code of the song displayed on screen. The service kicks off with Khubsoorat (starring Rekha) and the song Sun sun sun didi tere liye on Saturday night. Also on offer would be classics like Abhimaan, Kabhie Kabhie, Laawaris, Karz and recent hits like Baghban and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor.

 ?We are the first in the movie genre to offer such a service,? claimed Tushar Shah, vice-president, MAX. ?It will be available across different time bands including morning, afternoon, evening and prime as well as during Super Gaane, the song countdown,? he added.

 The technical partner for MAX in this is Mobile2win, while the content has been developed by Sound Buzz.

 Aishwarya Rai, Yukta Mookhey, Diana Hayden, Priyanka Chopra? Sayali Bhagat? The world will get to know who the Miss World 2004 is on December 4, at 6.30 pm, Star World.

 Miss India 2004 is in group 6, facing a fight from Australia and Mexico.

 On World AIDS Day, representatives of USA, South Africa, Fiji, Tanzania, Philippines, Puerto Rico and Brazil side-stepped part of the rehearsals for an AIDS awareness conference.

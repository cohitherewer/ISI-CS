 A STAFF REPORTER

 (From top) Japan?s Festival of Water and 

Fire, in which a portable shrine is carried through a crowd of water-throwing 

spectators; The Shinkansen; A still from Kurosawa?s Rashomon 

 Ohaiyo, Calcutta. A slice of Japan beckons citizens this week, as the curtain went up on Vision Japan 2004, a nine-day jamboree, on Saturday evening. Organised by the consulate-general of Japan, the festival is showcasing numerous facets of Japanese cultural life, sports and economic development. The fare is a varied one, ranging from films to economics, percussion to ceramics.

 The documentary film festival that was held over the weekend at Rotary Sadan comprised a bouquet on the theme Tradition amp; Present-Day Japan. In the traditional section, there is Images of Japan, capturing vignettes of culture and tradition, and also 15-minute sports magazines on judo and karate.

 The Story of Shinkansen, Japan?s famed Bullet Trains, as well as the Launch of the Sony Legacy will give viewers a taste of the Nippon technology march. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the venue shifts to the Institute Hall auditorium of Shibpur BE College.

 What?s a Japanese film festival without a feast of Akira Kurosawa? Next weekend will have Nandan II screening Sanjuro, Doomed (to live), Rashomon and Madadayo.

 Academy of Fine Arts is hosting what is being billed as ?one of the most spectacular exhibitions the city has ever seen?. The panel exhibition will also make visitors aware of the ?immense contribution of Japanese companies in West Bengal?.

 Displays of origami, bonsai, ikebana and Hina Matsuri dolls will add to the Japanese ambience. The famed paper-folding craft will be taught in an origami workshop at the Academy from November 26 to 28, with a ceramics showcase from November 22 to 24 at the Government College of Art and Craft on Tuesday.

 The biggest draw of the festival promises to be Silent Bird, a percussion and shomyo chant. ?Shomyo chant is a rhythmic religious prayer, illuminating the mysteries of body, word and mind. It had originated in India,? explains D.N. Bakshi of Indo-Japan Welfare Society.

 The extravaganza is aimed at showcasing ?the vibrancy of the dynamic relationship between the two countries, especially in view of the economic interactions in West Bengal?, in the words of the Japanese consul-general Kenji Shimizu. ?We are keen on extending our areas of cooperation with Japan,? was chief minister Bhattacharjee?s message.

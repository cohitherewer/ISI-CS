 10-lakh heist in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 At a time when the city and its adjoining areas are teeming with policemen to tackle Wednesday?s bandh, a gang of robbers pulled off an audacious heist in Salt Lake?s DK block, a stone?s throw from Karunamoyee island, one of the busiest points in the township. 

 Five armed youths in a blue van snatched more than Rs 10 lakh from the security guard of Anandalok Hospital, who was on his way to deposit the money in a nearby bank. The guard and a hospital vehicle driver were severely injured.

 Rabi Mondal (27), a hired security man of the hospital, was carrying Rs 9.73 lakh in cash and Rs 78,000 in cheques in a bag. The Bolero he was in was being driven by Biswajit Mahesh (30). 

 The hospital is in DK block of Salt Lake, in the Bidhannagar (East) police station area. Around 11.30 am, the duo drove out of the hospital to deposit the amount at the State Bank of Mysore?s CK Market branch, less than half-a-km from the hospital. 

 ?The money had accumulated over three days and since it was a festive week, we could not deposit the money earlier,? said D.K. Saraf, secretary of Anandalok Hospital. 

 Cash that accumulates on Saturday and Sunday is usually sent to the bank on Monday. However, since Monday was Id and the bank was closed, the money was to be deposited on Tuesday. 

 As the vehicle moved a few metres from the hospital gate, crossing the adjacent Geological Survey of India building, a blue Maruti Omni overtook it and blocked its path. Inside were six men, including the driver. Four youths armed with improvised handguns, knives and crude bombs, jumped out and started beating up the driver and the guard.

 Even as Mahesh and Mondal were attacked with knives and sticks, a crowd had gathered. However, no one dared to intervene, police said. Mahesh, who was hit on the head and stomach, started vomiting and fell unconscious. 

 When Mondal resisted, he received a blow on the back of his head with the butt of a pistol, leaving a gaping wound. 

 The dacoits snatched the bag and the vehicle key, and sped off. Mondal and Mahesh are in the ICCU of Anandalok and their condition is stated to be critical. 

 ?Police officers misbehaved with us when we went to lodge a complaint,? Saraf alleged. ?They told us we should have informed them beforehand that we were taking the money to the bank,? he said. 

 ?The law and order situation has deteriorated sharply in recent days. It has become extremely unsafe here,? said Ramen Das, vice-president of Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Welfare Association.

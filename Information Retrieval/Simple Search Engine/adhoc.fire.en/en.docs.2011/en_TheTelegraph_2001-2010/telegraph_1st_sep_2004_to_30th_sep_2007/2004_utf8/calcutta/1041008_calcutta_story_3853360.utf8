The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small talk

Just when you thought it would... it didn?t. The rain 

just won?t stop, so here are a few conversation starters sure to warm up a damp 

party?

Waterworld

It is bound to turn competitive while comparing notes 

on the water levels near home. ?Oh, it was knee-high in sewage near my place,? 

may raise more than a couple of eyebrows about your general state of hygiene. 

So, try this one to kill two birds with one status stone: ?Oh, my Prada pumps 

are ruined, just ruined!?

Spin doctor

Mr Dependable, aka Anil Kumble, has earned true drool 

points this week. He?s finally joined the elite 400 Test wickets? club and girls 

and guys alike should make some room for exclusive cooing.

The spoilsports can do the balancing act by cribbing 

about Team India losing out on the chance to call the shots by allowing the Aussie 

Young Turks to go on the run rampage at Chinnaswamy Stadium. But instead of adding 

to the damp, think positive and allow the ?spinner who doesn?t spin the ball? 

to bask in the 400 fame.

Bratz vs Barbie 

Barbie and her boyfriends, dream house, kid sister 

and cars need to give way to the cool kid on the doll block. And its time we all 

mourned for our childhood pal.

Bratz, the denim-clad tomboy, has knocked Barbie off 

the top Christmas-seller racks. She has upstaged the buxom blonde, now on the 

wrong side of 40, with her two-year-old roughshod ways, supposed to mirror the 

post-Spice Girls generation fed on street fashion. Pouting in triumph and flicking 

her thigh-length 70s disco outfit along with her hip-hop posse, she belongs to 

US-based MGA Entertainment, billed as the world?s biggest privately-owned toy 

company.

Eagle landed

One of Calcutta?s most played album?s came alive on 

Wednesday night. Hell Freezes Over, which plunged the ageing rockers back 

into the limelight after their ?14-year vacation?, hit the tube and made the classic 

Eagles tracks seem as good as the first time we heard them. Time to raise a toast 

to Don and the boys ? again.

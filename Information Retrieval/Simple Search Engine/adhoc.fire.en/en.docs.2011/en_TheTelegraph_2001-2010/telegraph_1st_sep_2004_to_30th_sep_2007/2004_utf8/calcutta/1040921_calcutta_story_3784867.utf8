The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Star Spot

 SOUBHADRA CHAKRABARTY

Soubhadra Chakrabarty

Quiz crazy...

Is this guy. The 26-year-old began in Class V and has since participated 

in about a 100 quizzes by his own accounts. In fact, his first win was with quizmaster 

Derek O?Brien, as was his latest accomplishment. A member of the winning trio 

of TOPS (The Telegraph Open-quiz Show), Q Junkies, has a passion for trivia 

unquenched over time. TOPS is only the latest in a long list of wins, the first 

being in Class VII in Durgapur.

How does he do it?

Well, simply put, it?s a combination of fascination and hard work. 

The voracious reader loves poring over anything he can lay his hands on. But Soubhadra 

does have a few favourites ? European authors and arthouse films. The Akira Kurosawa 

and Jean-Luc Godard fan spends at least 30-45 minutes every day reading the papers 

to keep himself updated. That?s not a chore, but a hobby born of interest. His 

area of expertise is the abstract genre.

Life and death...

Is what he is learning to live with on a daily basis, having completed 

his MBBS from Calcutta National Medical College last year. The doctor-to-be is 

in pursuit of the basic answers of life, which prompts his preoccupation with 

the abstract. Music is another coping mechanism. At the moment, however, the young 

man is busy studying hard for his post-graduate entrance exams, as well as pursuing 

a diploma in public health from All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health.

Memorable moments...

Include making it to the semi-finals of Mastermind in 2000. But 

the only time he became emotional was while taking part in a cricket quiz in March 

2001, where Australian cricket giants Glen McGrath and Adam Gilchrist conducted 

two special rounds during the show. Meeting the great game men made Soubhadra 

weak in the knees. 

He says...

?I have got so much from quizzing, that I?d like to give something 

back. Maybe someday I can be like Derek and do what he does.?

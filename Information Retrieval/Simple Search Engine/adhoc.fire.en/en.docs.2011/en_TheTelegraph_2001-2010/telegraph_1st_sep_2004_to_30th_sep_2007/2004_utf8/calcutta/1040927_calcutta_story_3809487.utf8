The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Popcorn to phuchka

The last time she came to Calcutta during Christmas 

four years ago, she could only help herself to rum balls from Flury?s. ?They had 

exhausted everything else by the time we reached,? she still regrets. This time 

though, Rashmi Nigam (picture by Pradip Sanyal) was well in time to spread the 

word about her debut film Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao!.

 The girl, who created a stir with the remix music video Ja re ja, was hand-picked by Pritish Nandy. ?He had seen me in the video and called me up and said, ?If you can carry off a sari so well and bite like that (remember the suggestive clenched-teeth act?), we have to take you?. I thought here was a different, youthful film, which will surely be publicised well. So I went ahead and said yes.?

 She could have got the film on other counts too. ?Incidentally, Kabir (Sadanand, the director of the film), his wife Archana and me were from the same school in Delhi. My mother used to teach Kabir mathematics and I can tell you the marks weren?t that great. But I never blackmailed him to bag the movie,? laughed the pretty face with hot bod to match.

 In Popcorn..., Rashmi plays Sonia. ?I am this rich popular kid in college, who has grown up in the lap of luxury. The film traces her journey of self-finding even as she tries to search for love and stand on her own two feet.?

 Rashmi also manages to do something very few Bollywood actresses have managed in recent times ? that of stealing the thunder (and screen time) of an item girl. ?It was decided at the last moment to put me into the item song Dupatta beimaan re alongside the Serbian babe Jelena. Once I reached the sets, I saw 50-odd people preparing a bath for me. Well, I just got into the tub and stayed in that freezing cold water for one-and-a-half hours. After it was done, I called up Mom and said, ?I just took a bath in front of 50 men?. She just kept mum.?

 After shooting the film, Rashmi also squeezed out time to shoot for Daler Mehndi?s comeback video. ?Being from Delhi, I have grown up listening to a lot of Punjabi music and with choreographer-director Ahmed Khan shooting it, I just had to do it.?

 What?s more, Rashmi is also game for a Bengali film. ?I would love to do it.? 

 And what should it be called? ?Phuchka khao! Mast ho jao!?

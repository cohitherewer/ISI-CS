Download is the key. With Apple Computers showing 

the world that legally downloading music works as a business model (and how!), 

more and more companies (software majors et al) are jumping on the online music 

store bandwagon.

When Apple launched its service, pundits had scorned 

the idea saying people would never pay to download music that they can get for 

free. Thousands of downloads and a million-song library later, Apple has not only 

proved detractors wrong but also shown others the way.

As a result, Microsoft is beta-testing its music store 

(on trial at www.beta.music.msn.com) while Yahoo! has announced plans of acquiring 

online music seller MusicMatch (www.musicmatch.com). Microsoft competitor Real 

Networks already has its store in place (www.real.com/musicstore) and Napster, 

the erstwhile bad boy of music which used to allow free peer-to-peer download, 

is trying to be successful with its own music download service (www.napster.com). 

Even the likes of Amazon and Wal-Mart, known primarily as shopping portals, are 

now eyeing the download pie.

The pricing and format at most online stores are similar. 

The stores can be accessed through a music-playing software (Apple?s iTunes, Microsoft?s 

Windows Media Player or Real Network?s Real Player). You can browse by artistes, 

albums, genres or go by suggestions from the store or consult its top-downloads 

chart. Participation from all major music labels ensures a huge catalogue ? iTunes 

and MSN Music have over a million songs each, with Napster storing 700,000 and 

Wal-Mart 300,000 and counting.

Where price is concerned, single songs range from 

88-99 cents (around Rs 40-45) and albums around $10 (Rs 450). The songs are always 

in compressed format (Apple?s AAC, Microsoft?s WMA and MP3 for others) with varying 

number-of-computers-per-download limits.

One of the more appealing reasons for legal music 

download is the option of buying only the songs you like and not an entire album 

for only a song or two. Bonuses include watching music videos, downloading audiobooks 

and gaining access to exclusive download-only tracks.

Popularity of online downloads can be gauged from 

the iconic status that Apple?s iPod music player has achieved or from the first 

radio show (courtesy Virgin and Napster) airing in the UK counting down the week?s 

most downloaded songs.

The only bad news is that almost all the sites are 

yet to throw their doors open to India ? or for that matter, rest of Asia ? trying 

out American and European markets first. But there seems no reason why the model 

should not be a success in this part of the world. Portable music owners are aplenty 

in the city, let alone the country, and their common crib is that none of the 

online music stores has extended its service to India, yet.

As of now, you can only browse through the library 

and sample 30-second, sparkling clean preview clips. That, decidedly, makes matters 

worse!

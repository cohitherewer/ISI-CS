The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The dry fish market at Baithakkhana Road has been posing a formidable threat 

to the environment. Residents living near the market and passers-by are unable 

to withstand the nauseating stench from the market anymore. It makes many fall 

sick. I request the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to shift the market elsewhere.

 The Burdwan main line connects the Serampore railway station to Calcutta. Hundreds 

of people regularly troop into Hooghly since it houses the Serampore sub-divisional 

court and administrative headquarters. However, proper rail services to the town 

is severely wanting. The railway station is in bad shape. According to the authorities, 

more than 13,000 monthly tickets are sold from the station alone. But the passengers 

face an uphill task of negotiating the perennially waterlogged and slippery subway 

to the station. Even during summer, the subway is flooded with dirty water leaking 

from the faulty drainage lines. The Eastern Railway Passengers? Association (Serampore 

branch) had also demanded the construction of a ladies? toilet on the station 

premises as there is none at present.

 The Eastern Metropolitan Bypass is a sort of expressway within the city, where 

vehicles are supposed to move at a moderately fast pace. Care must be taken so 

that the vehicles overtake each other in a disciplined manner. Lane-marking is 

a must for this purpose. Now that the monsoon is over, the authorities should 

demarcate the three different lanes ? for slow-moving, fast-moving and medium-paced 

vehicles. A separate lane could also be earmarked for two-wheelers.

 I regularly board Budge Budge-bound buses from Taratala. The share taxi stand 

there is just a stone?s throw away from where passengers wait for buses. The Budge 

Budge Road is one of the most important trunk routes to Calcutta but it?s a pity 

that there are no proper bus stands along it. The present spot where most buses 

halt at Taratala is slushy. The foul smell at the place makes most of us feel 

sick after standing there for sometime. Are Budge Budge-bound passengers not worthy 

of better treatment? A proper, permanent bus stand is sorely needed at Taratala. 

We are told that Calcutta Municipal Corporation?s mayor Subrata Mukherjee also 

has a house in Budge Budge. Will he urge the councillor of the Taratala area to 

heed our request? 

T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.

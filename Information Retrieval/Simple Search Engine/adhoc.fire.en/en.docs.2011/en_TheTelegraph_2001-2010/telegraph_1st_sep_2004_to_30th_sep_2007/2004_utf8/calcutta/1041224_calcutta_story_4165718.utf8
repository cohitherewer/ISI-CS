 Buddha sees arson in office blaze

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The fire on October 28 last year in the minority community development corporation office at Bhabani Bhavan, Alipore, was a ?pure act of arson,? chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Thursday.

 ?The fire was an act of arson and not an accident,? the chief minister told Opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee (Trinamul Congress), hinting that his government believed there was more to the fire than met the eye. The fire had gutted the vast corporation office and the loss was pegged at Rs 27 lakh. 

 According to forensic reports, the fire appears to have been started by a human hand. ?The usual causes, like electrical short-circuit, did not lead to the fire. On December 27, we had lodged a complaint with Alipore police station on the basis of the forensic report. I am planning to engage senior officers to investigate the case,? Bhattacharjee said.

 The chief minister, however, did not throw any light on either the identity of the arsonist or his motive. 

 ?We have to investigate the case thoroughly and book the culprits,? he pointed out. 

 Bhattacharjee dismissed the Opposition charge against his government to the effect that the fire was meant to destroy valuable documents. 

 Earlier, Trinamul leader Banerjee had complained about gross irregularities in the department, and alleged that loans had been sanctioned by the corporation to members of the minority communities for political considerations, and there were grave financial irregularities in which leaders of a political party were involved.

 Banerjee alleged that the office was set on fire to cover up the irregularities. Denying the charge, the chief minister said no document was destroyed in the fire. The data was stored in computer hard discs. 

 ?I will shortly give you the list of candidates who had applied for loans from the corporation, as also the names of those who were sanctioned loans. There was no irregularity while granting loans to deserving candidates,? Bhattacharjee told the Opposition. 

 Eight of the 15 computers in the office were damaged in the fire, but not a single document was damaged, as those were stored in other computers, which remained intact.

 The chief minister told the Assembly he had reinstated Mohammad Salim as chairman of the corporation.

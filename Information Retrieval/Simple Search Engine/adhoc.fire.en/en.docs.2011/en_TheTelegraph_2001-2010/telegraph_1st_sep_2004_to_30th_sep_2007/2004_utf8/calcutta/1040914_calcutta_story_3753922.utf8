 Suicide in fear of losing mother

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dreading the death of his ailing 65-year-old mother, Dhiman Kumar Dey, 34, hanged himself at home on Monday.

 Dhiman?s mother has been suffering from bouts of malaria over a period of time at their 10B, Madhur Sen Garden Lane residence in the Jorabagan area of north Calcutta.

 Mastermoshai, as Dhiman was popularly known among his students, lived with his widowed mother on the top floor of the two-storeyed building. After the death of his father, Lal Behari Dey, a few years ago, and with his only sister married out of town, Dhiman had remained a bachelor to take care of his mother.

 Dhiman taught secondary-level science at home, allowing him to keep an eye on his malaria-stricken mother. Besides, a few months ago, she had broken an arm.

 ?Dhiman was a sentimental soul. On Monday, he went to his mother, held her feet and broke down. He then went back to his room and locked it from inside,? said Tapas Ganguly, officer-in-charge of Jorabagan police station.

 Well after noon, when his door was still locked, neighbours alerted the police. 

 The door was broken open, and Dhiman was found hanging by a nylon rope from the ceiling fan. Dhiman had admitted to a few parents of his students that he feared losing his mother. Police have informed his sister and brother-in-law of the death.

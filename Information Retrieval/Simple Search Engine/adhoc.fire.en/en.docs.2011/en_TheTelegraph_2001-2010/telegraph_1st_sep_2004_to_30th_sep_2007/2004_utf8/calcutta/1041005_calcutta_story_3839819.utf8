There is no greater festival than Durga Puja in Calcutta. 

It is more colourful than the Oktoberfest and more delirious than Mardi Gras. 

The familiar sound of dhak, dhunuchi nach, the mild fragrance of 

shiuli, are a familiar tug at every Calcuttan?s heart. 

It is the time for celebrations and good food and 

drink are always an intrinsic part of this festive occasion. I have created two 

recipes with gin, known essentially as a ?ladies drink?, to celebrate the power 

of Goddess Durga. These two cocktails are especially created for the festive days 

and hence are sweet to taste. 

KOLKATA REMIXED

Ingredients: 

60 ml gin, 2 tbsp sweet curd (Mishti Doi), 4 tbsp 

yogurt, 4 tbsp banana puree, 1 piece Rosogolla (medium size), a pinch of cinnamon 

powder, 5 ice cubes 

Method: 

Mix the above ingredients together in a blender at 

high speed and serve in a pre-chilled earthen glass or kullar. 

KUMARTULI 

Ingredients: 

60 ml gin, 100 ml tea with milk (dhaba chai 

? sweetened), 2 tsp condensed milk, 1 tsp caramelised sugar, 15 ml Bailey?s Irish 

Cream, 5 ml Cr?me de Menthe, 5 ice cubes 

Method: 

Blend the above ingredients together and serve in 

a pre-chilled tall cocktail glass.

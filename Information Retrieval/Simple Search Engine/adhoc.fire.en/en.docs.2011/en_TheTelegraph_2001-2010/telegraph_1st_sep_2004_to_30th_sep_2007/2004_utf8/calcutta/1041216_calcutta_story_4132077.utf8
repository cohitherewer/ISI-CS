Live Italian action

Madhumita Bhattacharyya takes the 

lid off La Cucinas culinary bash

Kitchen Caper

If the motto is ?in the moment?, how do you possibly 

serve 70 four-course sit-down dinners together in just over an hour?

La Cucina, the brand new Italian eatery at the Hyatt 

Regency, pulled off such a feat on Tuesday night with practised ease. All it takes 

is six expert chefs, a few hours and a carefully planned menu.

The wine dinner hosted by the Indo-Italian Chamber 

of Commerce and the Italian consulate was the finale of Festa Italiana, a series 

of events in the city showcasing Italy. To top it all, the food feat, orchestrated 

by the colourful Davide Cananzi from Florence, was performed in an open kitchen.

Diners? delight

There is no scope for hasty last minute finishing 

touches and burning sauces when your hungry guests are smelling, hearing and seeing 

you prepare their meal right before them.

The kitchen is compact and seemingly small for an 

84-seater restaurant. But it proves more than capable of handling a sizeable load. 

A wood-and-gas fired oven dominates the space. Ten burners, a charcoal grill, 

a grill for toasting, a deep-frying basin and another for boiling, occupy a central 

cooking station. Two well-lit display refrigerators are stocked with cuts of meat, 

vegetables, fruits and condiments.

While the arrangements ? cleaning, marinating, chopping 

and the like ? are taken care of in advance, the final touches have to be done 

at the last moment to ensure the food is hot and fresh. The cold antipasti are 

plated earlier. The sauces, which can simmer for hours on the stove, are also 

made before hand.

But when the moment arrives, the kitchen hums like 

a well-oiled machine. ?The open kitchen makes the chefs more conscious about the 

way they cook, but that?s how things should be at the back of the house,? smiles 

general manager Timothy Bruce, who along with chef Cananzi chose the wines for 

the dinner. An hour or so before the final action begins, the boys take a break 

to change into fresh uniforms and grab a bite themselves. It will, after all, 

be a long night.

With three wines ? one white and two reds ? being 

served during the dinner, the bottles are opened a couple of hours in advance. 

?It lets them breathe,? explains Bruce. Each bottle has to be tried individually. 

?You don?t want to serve your guests a bad bottle,? he stresses. If a really ?big? 

wine is to be served, it can be opened up to six hours beforehand, decanted and 

poured back into the bottle.

Another time-consuming task finished ahead of time 

is the frying of the Norwegian salmon, to be served finally on risotto with truffle 

oil, finished with a tart dressing. They are fried for a few minutes, covered 

and kept aside, and will be baked in the oven before serving.

Palette picks

On a normal evening, almost everything would be cooked 

after guests place their order. They can specify preferences over the semi-circular 

counter dividing diner and chef.

At the speciality restaurant, many ingredients such 

as cheeses like mozzarella, gorgonzola and scamorza, and olive oil are also imported. 

Others are made in-house to ensure consistent quality. ?We make 2.5 kilos of ricotta 

a day, used for pasta and ravioli,? explains Cananzi. Yoghurt, milk, lemon, salt 

and pepper are needed for this.

The wine selection takes detailed planning as well. 

Around 35 labels are currently in stock and another 16 or so are on their way, 

all of them imported.

The pastas ? all 12 varieties ? are freshly made. 

Flour, egg and water are kneaded together and put through the pasta machine. Sometimes, 

whole wheat and semolina variations are also made. Farfale takes the longest, 

as the squares have to be lightly twisted together by hand for the bow-like shape. 

But even this is brisk work for experienced hands. For the Tuesday dinner, six 

kilos (served with a delightful pesto sauce) was made in an hour.

With such able chefs at work, it is no surprise that 

even the Italian consul general Augustino Pinna was convinced of the meal?s authenticity.

Here, from the moment the aromatic olive oil hits 

the pan, a feast for the senses is truly yours.

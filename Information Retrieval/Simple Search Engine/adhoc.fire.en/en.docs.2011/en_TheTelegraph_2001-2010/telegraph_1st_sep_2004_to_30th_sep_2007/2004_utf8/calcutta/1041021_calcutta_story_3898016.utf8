 Festive flavours far beyond the boundaries

By Ashtami evening, your taste buds have probably had an ethnic overload, after rounds at the pandals, digging into bhog and feasting on endless Bengali specials at home. So, it might be time to tuck into some Chinese or Continental cuisine for a change, along with a glass of wine and the right company. Here is a food map for a detour from the spice route.

 Park Street

Park Street, with its bright lights, variety and extended 

hours, is the hub in terms of a festive dining experience. In the field of Continental 

cuisine, Mocambo stands out, having been a popular stalwart on Park Street for 

several decades.

 ?People like their old favourites here, whether it is the Pujas or not. And during this festive time, we take care to highlight our specialities,? says restaurateur Nitin Kothari.

 The flavours of choice for the season are the prawn cocktail and devilled crabs for starters with Chicken ala Kiev, Fish Diana, Bekti Bell Meunierre, Bekti Newburg and the range of sizzlers ruling the main course picks.

 Oriental aroma

Amongst Oriental destinations, nothing beats Tangra. 

Take your pick of scores of eateries offering reasonably cheaper, authentic grub. 

These no-frills restaurants provide value-for-money meals at all times. Garlic 

Steamed Fish, Chilli Crab Claws and the regular, ever-popular ?Chilli Chicken-Chowmein? 

are the biggest sellers during this period.

 ?Though our sales figures do go up, there is not a very big difference during this season. As for the festive spirit, there really is not much we do to enhance it,? confesses a manager at Kafulok.

 For those with a fatter wallet and a few dollops of extravagance, Mainland China is the ideal destination, with a host of buffet items allowing the diner a wide choice. ?For our Calcutta patrons, we promise it will be a dining experience to remember as we have given the entire restaurant a facelift,? explains a spokesperson for the Gurusaday Road restaurant. ?Not only can we accommodate more people, we have special dishes right up to Dashami.?

 With a host of non-vegetarian choices like Prawns in Spicy Chilli Sauce, Chicken Soya Sauce, Fish Chilli Mustard and Crab Pepper Salt, there is some heady stuff to be had.

 Multi-cuisine

There will always be a few in every group who always 

want to be anti-establishment in choice of cuisine. So, in every family of avid 

Indian khana lovers, there will be one rebel with a culinary cause. 

 If you want to keep the peace, head for a multi-cuisine restaurant. Try out Tangerine on Outram Road, which is serving up a lavish buffet laden with Chinese, Continental and Indian flavours each day of the Pujas.

 ?During the Pujas, the sales are much higher as people are ready to spend lavishly on eating out. We intend to keep revellers happy by keeping our doors open for as long as they keep coming in,? says chef Sujit Sinha.

 Or if you prefer to bring some foreign platters to your family at home, here is a recipe from the woks of chefs Subhas Basu and Sujit Sinha of Tangerine.

 Grilled Bekti with chilli lemon honey sauce

 Ingredients:

 5 fish fillets, 1 tsp chopped garlic, 1 tsp olive or vegetable oil, ? tsp shredded fresh red chilli, salt and pepper to taste, 1 tsp butter, the juice of half a lemon, 100 g vegetables like carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers, yellow peppers, spinach, baby corn and ginger, depending on preferences.

 For the sauce:

 1 tbsp butter, ? tbsp chilli flakes, ? tbsp sugar or honey, 1 kaffir lime leaf, salt to taste

 Method:

 Marinate the fish for half an hour in all the ingredients (leaving aside the component for the sauce). Grill in a pan till half-done. Finish with butter and keep aside. Parboil the vegetables and stir-fry with ginger, butter and seasoning till well done.

 For the sauce, melt butter in a pan and add the chilli flakes and the sugar or honey. Add warm water and stir till all the ingredients are blended well. Finish with lime juice and lime leaf.

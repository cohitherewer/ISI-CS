The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ...

Ganpur forest

Twelve years in exile over, the Pandavas were on the 

lookout for a place to spend the last year lying low before going back to reclaim 

their kingdom. That is when they reached Ganpur in Birbhum.

All that might be legend, but it?s not hard to imagine 

why the quintet chose to stay put here. The area holds promise, offering everything 

to a person planning on staying holed-up for a weekend getaway ? dense disorienting 

forests, furrows in the laterite soil that could be used as shelter and streams 

that snake through the bed of the forest. 

Legend has it that the forest was full of fruit-bearing 

trees when the Pandavas visited. But it is advisable for those visitors with a 

weakness for fruits to buy them from Mallarpur station. That is where visitors 

to Ganpur Forest need to alight from Ganadevata Express.

A stone?s throw away is a village after which the 

station is named. The top draw of the hamlet is the cluster of 12 terracotta temples, 

each with a shiva linga in the sanctum sanctorum. It is around five km 

from the station to Ganpur Forest Rest House, which offers comforts the Pandavas 

could never have dreamt of. Both buses and rickshaws ply the route.

The only trees that make up the natural forest today 

are cash-yielding sal, all the 3,300 acres of it, and is home to numerous 

birds and not so numerous wild boar. Migrating herds of elephants from Dalma also 

frequent this forest. 

Some three km into the jungle is another Mahabharata 

connection. A Siddhnath Shiva temple on Shivpahari where Jayadrath is said to 

have meditated for months in front of the four-foot linga to be granted 

a boon wherein the one who ?dropped his head on the ground ? would combust spontaneously.

Jayadrath lost his head in the Kurukshetra battle, 

but Arjuna whose arrow did the damage, found a loophole in the boon to save himself. 

Jayadrath?s head went flying and landed on the lap of his father, a rishi, 

who, shocked by the sight of his son?s head, dropped it on the ground. He was 

immediately reduced to ashes.

Legend aside, Ghagha, a tribal village deep in the 

jungle is definitely worth a visit at this time of the year, when evening sets 

quickly and villagers crowd around bonfires to swap stories.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Line ?n? length to york diabetes

Wasim Akram is on an Indian odyssey to help others fight the 

disease he conquered on the field, reports Sudeshna Banerjee

on World Diabetes Day

On November 13, as one captain after another from 

across the border stepped on the Eden turf to accept the honours on the platinum 

jubilee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, puzzled fans in the gallery 

searched for an obvious face. Wasim Akram was missing in the hallowed gathering. 

It was only on reading the newspaper the morning after that they realised where 

he had been ? in Bangalore, at an awareness rally on diabetes on World Diabetes 

Day. ?That cause was closer to my heart,? he smiles modestly, on reaching Calcutta 

on Wednesday to spread the same message, this time among children.

A hero is beyond national barriers, especially when 

he rises to the cause of humanity. And Akram has been an inspiration for every 

person who has to live with the prick of the needle every day. A country which 

has 35 million cases and is considered the ?diabetes capital of the world? (in 

the words of Sanjeev Johar of Roche Diagnostics, Akram?s tour organisers) can 

certainly do with such inspiration.

?After you got diabetes, did you become weaker?? asks 

a boy from the corner of the Vidya Mandir auditorium. ?Absolutely not. I played 

better after I got diabetes,? says the champion all-rounder, looking relaxed in 

casuals, and completely aware that the children, many of them certainly with diabetic 

parents, were hanging on to every word.

?This is why I like speaking to children. They remember,? 

he says, back at the hotel. True enough, on being asked what the Akram?s message 

to them was, the kids filing out of the auditorium after the magic hour, rattle 

off: ?Increase physical activity, avoid junk food, play any sport for an hour 

every day.?

If Akram is so passionate about fighting the disease 

(Calcutta was his fifth stop on this Indian odyssey), one has to turn the pages 

of his past to see what he has been through. 

It was the monsoon of 1997. The Sultan of Swing was 

just back from a tour of the West Indies as captain. ?I had bowled a lot, took 

17 wickets in three Tests. But after that, I pulled a hamstring muscle in a first-class 

game. Though I rested and missed a tour, it wasn?t getting better. There was the 

stress of match-fixing allegations and all. I lost a lot of weight, felt sleepy 

and weak? didn?t know what was happening. My father took me to a doctor? I was 

31, at the peak of my career. When the report came with a reading of 460, I asked 

God: ?Why me?? ?

It is what he did thereafter that makes Wasim Akram 

a fit ambassador in the fight against diabetes. ?I wanted to play at any cost. 

So Dr Faisal Masood put me on insulin straightaway. Tablets wouldn?t have helped. 

And I thought I would have to shift to insulin one day anyway, so why not now??

Diabetes did bring about a few changes in his habits. 

?I stopped taking health drinks as the sugar content is high. When the others 

would have PowerAid, I would drink water.? 

The first year, Akram would experience hypoglycaemia 

?every second game?. ?The umpire would have chocolates in his pocket, the physiotherapist 

carried sweets.? Akram is also grateful that his team mates understood that he 

would be edgy and angry in those moments. But he never turned his back on the 

field. ?I would go to fine leg, take a chocolate and come back to bowl the next 

over.? Being related to stress, hypoglycaemia became a constant companion, especially 

in the big matches. ?It happened twice in the famous Chennai Test. Nobody knew,? 

he smiles. ?If I had to get out of something, I could use diabetes as an excuse. 

Agar jhoot bolna tha to thik hain; nahin to kabhi zaroorat nahin hui,? 

the smile breaks into a grin.

Perhaps it is because behind this gentle compassionate 

exterior lies a tough competitor, that Akram succeeded in his fight against the 

disease. As the auditorium full of kids chant his name in wilful abandon ? ?Wasim, 

Wasim? ? one could not but help recall another day, another chorus, in Calcutta 

when the drama centred around the same man.

On February 19, 1999, Pakistan, under Akram, had appealed 

for a run-out decision against Sachin Tendulkar even as he was obstructed while 

grounding his bat.

What happened next is history ? an ignited gallery 

forced a break in the match; reams were written on whether Akram should have called 

Sachin back (a clipping of the day?s report in The Telegraph at extreme 

left). He still stands by his decision. ?It was the umpire?s decision that got 

him out, not us.?

And still Eden figures among his favourite grounds. 

?Every game we played there saw a full house. Perhaps the fact that we won made 

it even better.?

Family support, stresses Akaram, is very important 

to handle diabetes. His younger son Akbar will be four in January and Tehmooor 

is seven. ?They know I played cricket as there are pictures all around but they 

have never asked me to play with them. Neither do they understand a seven from 

a four. I think it is my fault. I have hardly been home...?

Being committed to a cause ? be it cricket or diabetes 

? has its flip side, but Akram is keen to make up now. Knowing his determination, 

it seems to be a promise he will keep.

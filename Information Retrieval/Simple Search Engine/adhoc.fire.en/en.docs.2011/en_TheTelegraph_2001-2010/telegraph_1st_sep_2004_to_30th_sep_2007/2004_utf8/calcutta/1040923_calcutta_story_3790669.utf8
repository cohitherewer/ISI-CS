The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pay bill, take baby dead five days ago

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 A nursing home in Howrah made a couple run around for money to square off its dues on Wednesday, before handing over its newborn that had died five days ago. 

 On September 10, Binay Majumder?s wife delivered a male child in a city hospital. Soon after, the mother and baby were released, with a word from the doctors that the tot was ?fine?.

 Four days after they reached home, on September 14, the baby started developing certain complications. ?It started with a stomach problem. Soon, we noticed that he could not breathe properly. A string of home-made remedies were tried, but his condition kept deteriorating,? recalled Binay. 

 In their desperation to save their only child, the Majumders took him to a Shibpur nursing home on September 17. 

 The baby died the next day. For the 24-hour stay, the nursing home prepared a bill of Rs 8,500. Binay were stumped. A contract labourer by profession, it was clearly beyond his means to pay up. 

 Helpless, he pleaded with the authorities to lower the amount. ?After repeated requests, they decided to scale down the figure to Rs 6,000. But even that was beyond my reach,? Binay said.

 Since Saturday, he had been trying to convince the authorities about the nature of his work and his income. But the nursing home would not budge: the Majumders would not be handed over the body unless they coughed up Rs 6,000.

 Someone advised Binay to inform the police. But he refused. ?There?s no denying that the nursing home had spent some amount for my baby?s treatment. How can I complain against them when it was all my fault?? Binay confessed to Metro.

 No other option in sight, he finally went to his colleagues, requesting them for loans. Seeing his plight, they chipped in with whatever they could.

 On Wednesday, as soon as the body was handed over, Binay broke down. ?The child has at least come to us,? he said, ashamed of having sought help from others. 

 When contacted on Wednesday, the hospital authorities refused to speak.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Lo-Cal

By Derek O'Brien

There is Christmas cake and, well, there is Christmas 

cake. Some swear by great-grandma?s secret recipe. Some would opt for the nattily 

packaged variety from the Kathleens, Kookie Jars, Upper Crusts or the five-stars. 

Our family favourite: Nahoum?s, the legendary shop run by a Jew in New Market. 

Merry Christmas!

TOPI-CAL

Typi-Cal 

 Following the demise of the Mughal Empire, its postal 

system was succeeded by a similar system run by the East India Company. This helped 

the British at Calcutta communicate with the trading outposts at places like Rajshahi, 

Dhaka and Murshidabad. In 1766, Robert Clive carried out significant postal reforms. 

The system that he helped establish was sometimes referred to as ?Clive?s Post?. 

Finally, the Calcutta GPO was established during the tenure of Warren Hastings, 

in 1774. The GPOs at Madras and Bombay followed in the subsequent years.

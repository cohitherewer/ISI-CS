 Being with the beat, not buying it

 Plagued by piracy, hit by skyrocketing input costs and driven to despair by dwindling sales, the Indian music industry already has its back to the wall. To top it all, April 2005 is set to be the cruellest month. That is the deadline by which the value-added tax (VAT) regime will begin across the country. 

 ?This is a killer blow for us. We will face a price hike of 10 to 15 per cent. It will put us out of the market,? complains Vijay J. Lazarus, president, Indian Music Industry, and CEO, Universal Music India. And Hindi film music, being the highest selling sector, will be hit the hardest. 

 Lazarus has reasons to lament. Sales have come down from Rs 1,200 crore to Rs 600 crore in six years. On this reduced turnover, the industry has registered cash losses of Rs 300 crore in the past 18 months.

 ?Counterfeiting has always been there. But that happened in the cassette format. Now with CDs coming in, digital piracy is our biggest threat,? explains Shridhar Subramanium, managing director of Sony Music India.

 The array of MP3 songs on the Internet is there for all to download. ?Technology has hampered our sales. Recording cassettes was a more difficult proposition. Now piracy has become a household feature,? says Mukesh Desai, chief executive officer of Super Cassettes Industries, owner of the T-Series label. 

 But that at least restricts the listeners to those with access to the Internet. ?The worst thing to have happened are the MP3 CDs,? feels Lazarus. ?These CDs, carrying 100-120 songs downloaded in a compressed format, are selling for Rs 45-50 in the grey market. We have dropped our prices from Rs 240 to Rs 99 for 10 songs. So, in effect, these products are worth Rs 1,000.? Adds Subramanium: ?Penetration has been rapid. The quality may not be good, but for Rs 50, the buyer does not mind,? 

 Super Cassettes had set a trend by pulling down prices of albums to rock-bottom in the 80s. ?Pirates were eating into our profits,? Desai recalls. But faced with digital piracy, even the company is helpless. ?There is no way we can bring down prices any further from the Rs 99 a standard film CD sells for,? says the CEO.

 Add to this the influx of cheap MP3 players. ?This has eaten away the lower end of our market,? says Lazarus. 

 Another finger is pointed at the FM radio stations. ?Statistics show that in cities which have FM radio, our sales have dropped by about 40-50 per cent,? says Kumar Taurani of Tips. The peeve point of the music companies is the fact that the FM stations play the entire song. ?If they play all the latest songs so many times a day then who will go to buy the cassette?? demands Desai. His prescription is a law restricting them to a minute or 90 seconds, as is the norm for pop releases in the West. A case is on in court over the issue, he adds.

 The night clubs also play a lot of film music. ?Who would visit a disc which does not play chartbusters? They play our songs to make money on liquor sales. The major night clubs in Mumbai do business of about Rs 1 crore a month while paying us barely Rs 1 lakh.? The copyright board has set a rate for playing music. ?It is around Rs 600 for an hour, which works out to Rs 10-15 for every song. In comparison to the damage it does, the amount is peanuts,? shrugs the Sony chief. 

 Today, the music consumption has increased manifold. Only the record labels are losing out on the profits they believe should be their?s for the taking. Why should a person who is listening to a song on the way to office on FM radio, at home on television and at the nightclub want to invest in it?? says Lazarus.

 Statistics do the singing. Tips? Fida sold 3.5 lakh units while Kyun? Ho Gaya Na... registered 2.5 lakh. Taurani says even two years ago the figures would have been 20 lakh and 10-12 lakh respectively. ?Earlier, the music of even a flop film would sell 5-10 lakh. Now we are relieved if we can push 50,000 to 100,000 units.? Sony?s Kal Ho Naa Ho and T-Series? Tere Naam have sold 30 lakh and 25 lakh. ?These are astoundingly large figures,? says Subramanium. 

 Ganesh Jain of Venus, who has had 50 lakh-plus scores with Khalnayak, Raja Hindustani, Raaz and Soldier, demands a separate police force and a court to deal with piracy. Deterrent punishment is what Lazarus wants. ?Of the 7,000 anti-piracy cases files, there have been only 500 convictions, of which 50 are large.? In the US, a fine of $150,000 is clamped for every pirated cassette or CD found in a shop, he adds

 In this scenario, VAT has come as the proverbial last nail. ?We already have to pay a sales tax of 16 per cent. There is no such tax on books or computer software,? Taurani says.

 Industry players are petitioning the government for re-classification that moves pre-recorded audio cassettes and CDs from the electrical and electronic machinery category to the publishing category. ?A blank CD sold for Rs 15 costs Rs 125 when it contains recorded material. So our value comes from the content. Why should it be clubbed under electronic or plastic goods and not regarded as intellectual property?? they demand.

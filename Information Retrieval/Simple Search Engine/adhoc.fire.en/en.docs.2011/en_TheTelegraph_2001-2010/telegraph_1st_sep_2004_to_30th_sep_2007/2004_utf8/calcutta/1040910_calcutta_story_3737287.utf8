 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s new slogan: a cleaner and greener Calcutta. 

 Directed by the chief minister, the environment department has drafted a new set of rules on tree plantation to ensure a steady growth in urban forestation, in the wake of rampant tree-felling in the city and other urban areas.

 ?We have almost finalised the rules relating to felling and are now preparing a separate set of norms on plantation in the city. The combined rules, that could be called Green Rules, will come into effect within a couple of months,?? environment secretary Asim Barman said on Thursday.

 ?In the tree-felling rulebook, we have incorporated clear and specific directives on chopping, trimming and felling of trees. In the plantation rulebook, there will be guidelines on which part of the city will be given a specific forestation programme, that is, what tree will be planted where,?? Barman said.

 According to tree-felling norms, builders intending to construct estates for commercial purposes will have to plant trees on space equal to the area of construction. 

 The land for new plantation will be identified by the forest department. This apart, if any agency has to fell a big tree, it has to plant at least five saplings.

 However, by the plantation rules, road intersections, gardens, islands, vested land, open spaces, canal sides and river banks will get trees in tune with their character, like fast-growing, dust and heat absorbing, tall, ornamental and decorative. 

 ?For example, trees to be planted along river banks will be of large variety, while trees along canals will be tall. New plantation on key roads will be fast-growing and dust-absorbing,? Barman explained.

 The environment department, in collaboration with the forest and urban development departments, will conduct a survey to assess the status of greenery in the city and big trees and gardens located along the roads. A special cell, comprising officers from four departments ? environment, urban development, forest and municipal affairs ? will oversee the project.

 ?Our move is to ensure at least 25 per cent increase in green coverage in the city within two years,?? environment secretary Barman said.

 The decision to frame specific norms on new plantation follows chief minister Bhattacharjee?s directive to different agencies that have displayed a reluctance to plant new trees.

 The chief minister, at a recent meeting with Cabinet colleagues Asok Bhattacharya, Subhas Chakraborty, Gautam Deb and Manab Mukherjee, made it clear that he will not compromise with environmental issues. 

 He expressed dissatisfaction over the neglect of the environment and violation of the pollution norms by government officials and development agencies, like Calcutta Improvement Trust and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.

 ?We are asking contractors and private builders to plant more trees, if they find it necessary to fell any tree, but it is unfortunate that government officials and agencies are not following the directive properly,?? Bhattacharjee told the ministers at the meeting.

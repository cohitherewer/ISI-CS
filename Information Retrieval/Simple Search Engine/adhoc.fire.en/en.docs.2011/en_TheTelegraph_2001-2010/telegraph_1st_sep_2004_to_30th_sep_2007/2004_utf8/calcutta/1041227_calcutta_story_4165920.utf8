 Gold-enamelled Persian decanters, crystal ware, onyx furniture, Oriental jacquard prints ? it?s a veritable treasure trove at the 18th Industrial India Trade Fair on the Maidan. 

 As usual, the annual meet has drawn a lot of foreign participation, each country displaying its own brand of exotica.

 Partner-country China is displaying the latest in its cutting-edge technology at its pagoda-style pavilion, housing 21 stalls. Starting from high-fashion shoes to the hi-tech highway paver and new-age building material, there?s a huge amount of display material and information available for people interested in entering into trade partnerships. 

 In fact, most of the goods, including a colourful array of shoes, are not for sale. ?The Chinese are more interested in joint-venture deals with Indians,? said Samir Kumar Ghosh, chairman, Industrial India Trade Fair Committee. A memorandum of understanding was signed at the fair auditorium on December 22 between the Council for the Promotion of International Trade, China and BNCCI. 

 The West Asian guests, on the other hand, have come up with a more artistic display. Handmade glassware at the Iranian stall catches the eye, each piece made irresistible by the use of Persian-style gold and silver enamelling. 

 The price matches the intricate detailing on blue and black decanters, holders and a host of other knick-knacks: most objects cost above Rs 500. 

 Turkey?s stall is dazzling with cut crystal objects. ?One for Rs 300, three for Rs 600,? is the business model for small crystal artefacts. 

 Ethnic chic is what rules stalls of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Vietnam. As usual, the Pakistani stalls are dominated by huge onyx furniture and artefacts. 

 ?The stone is not available in India and is, therefore, a huge draw,? said a Pakistani participant. Saris and dress materials are among the other objects available at the 20 Pakistani stalls. 

 ?There was an unprecedented amount of Pakistani entries requesting participation. We had to draw lots to finalise the names,? said Ghosh. 

 Bangladeshi stalls always touch a chord with Calcuttans with their Dhakai and Jamdani saris and this year is no exception. Yet another stall from foreign shores mobbed by the hungry Calcutta crowd is from Nepal, offering instant noodles and traditional fast food. 

 The showstopper, however, is the lone Vietnam stall. Traditional Vietnamese outfits for women, much like our salwar-kurta, make ideal party and formal wear. 

 The satin bottom and long-coat-style jacquard tops for Rs 1,000 and jacquard short jackets for Rs 500 in attractive combinations of black and red are absolutely stunning.

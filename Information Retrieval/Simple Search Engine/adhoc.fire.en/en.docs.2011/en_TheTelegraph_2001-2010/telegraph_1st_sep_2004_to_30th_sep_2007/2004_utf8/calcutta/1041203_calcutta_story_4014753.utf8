The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

It?s showtime, folks!

ZEESHAN JAWED

Morning, noon and night, family or friends, freaky 

or chilled out? Calcutta has discovered what it is to hang out. Whether they are 

multi-utility centres or standalone destinations, the city finally has a vast 

palette of entertainment to offer, in an array of hues. Goodlife will take 

a weekly walk through some of the hottest hotspots of the city in HOT HANGOUT... 

Starting point 

INOX at City Centre, DC Block, Salt Lake, Sector I.

Raison d??tre

Scores just for being the first cinema hall, leave 

alone multiplex, in the township. Now, the movie has become just an alibi for 

an evening of fun.

Feet figures 

The multilevel complex is spread over 30,000 sq ft 

with four auditoriums and two Refuel food counters at Level I and Level II. The 

combined seating capacity is 1,144.

USP 

A DJ playing in the lobby, a large-screen television 

that is top draw during cricket matches, with crowds spilling out of the glass 

doors and into the open spaces of the mall. 

?We organise various events for amateurs like DJ hunts, 

exhibitions etc. The entire lobby was literally turned into a village when the 

movie The Village was released. There is always something happening here 

to catch the imagination of the people,? stresses Subhasis Ganguli, general manager, 

INOX City Centre.

Crowd count 

In a regular week, 15,000 to 18,000 movie-goers visit 

the multiplex. However, during festivities like Diwali and Durga puja, the footfall 

invariably increases by nearly 30 to 40 per cent.

Fee factor

If you are hit by a cash crunch, catch a movie in 

the morning when the rates of the tickets are lower. Weekend evening shows will 

pinch the hardest. The rates are flexible, depending on demand for the movie.

Family fun

Family factor rules on weekends, as is common to the 

City Centre crowd. ?It is a one-of-its-kind destination in Salt Lake, so it has 

caught the fancy of residents. There is something for everybody in the family. 

If somebody doesn?t want to watch a movie, he can roam around or just sit back 

and relax,? feels Nitu Gupta of IB Block. Office-goers normally unwind in the 

evening while younger browsers can be found through the day.

Multi matter

If Bride and Prejudice and Veer-Zaara are 

not on your agenda, soak in the feel of the place. Shake a leg to tracks rolled 

out by the DJ at the foyer. 

Munch menu

The vegetarian offering is a big draw. Apart from 

the regular fare of pizzas, burgers, hot dogs and soft drinks, weekends see a 

special menu for families. Chola Bhatura, Aloo Ke Parathe and Dahi Vadas are some 

of the scrumptious delights served up. 

But any time of the week, flavoured popcorn ? caramel, 

chilly tomato and cheddar cheese ? is the biggest draw. This Level I food counter 

is accessible to everyone irrespective of their purchasing a ticket or not.

Hectic hub 

If spending time and getting lost in the crowd is 

your idea of fun, it is better to drop by in the evenings when the mall comes 

alive and the DJ starts playing his music. With such a plethora of options in 

this cineplex, there?s little chance for getting even a tad bored.

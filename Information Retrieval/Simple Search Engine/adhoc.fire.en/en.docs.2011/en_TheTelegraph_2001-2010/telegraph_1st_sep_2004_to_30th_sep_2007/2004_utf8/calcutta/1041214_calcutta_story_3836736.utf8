Library lair

Himika Chaudhuri finds out how to 

put together and maintain a readers den at home

You don?t have to be Henry Higgins to have a library 

to die for (or to know that propah English is a near forgotten tongue). Whether 

you live in a huge house or a more moderate bungalow, showing off your enviable 

collection of tomes can be well worth the effort, lending class and character 

to your homestead.

?In a flat, it is difficult to display your collection 

to full advantage, like you can with a dedicated space for a library,? feels homoeopathy 

specialist Prasanta Banerji, viewing his 10,000 strong collection with pride.

While he has a two-tier wooden library at his Elgin 

Road residence (picture above by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya), there are other ways 

a bibliophile can pay homage to his chosen god. At their Southern Avenue residence, 

the Roys, a family of doctors, have reserved two walls in a 2,000-sq-ft flat to 

stock books in a ?mini library?.

Book keeping 

The Banerjis? huge reading room is an effort to emulate 

Henry Higgins? haven in My Fair Lady. The project is one that requires 

time and dedication. ?Maintaining a library is one of the most difficult jobs 

in the world,? says son and homoeopathy specialist Pratip Banerji. The biggest 

threat is bookworms (not the bespectacled kind, of course).

Regular pest control is required and termite-resistant 

cupboards are to be made with every new stock of books. Despite the insect-resistant 

materials and insecticide, the volumes bask in the sun once a year, which is an 

elaborate and time-consuming exercise.

To get rid of the mustiness, carpet gives way to wooden 

flooring. ?Anything that soaks up moisture should not be kept in a library as 

damp is bad for books,? adds Prasanta.

Indexing

It?s almost impossible to enjoy your home library 

unless the books are properly indexed and stored away. And that is the reason 

the Banerjis have sought the help of a professional librarian to index the collection.

?All the data is fed into the library computer. The 

software will tell you which bookshelf you can find a title or the works of a 

particular author in,? explains Pratip.

Division of book types is also imperative. In the 

Banerji library, non-fiction finds place on the ground floor while the upper level 

boasts a diverse range of fiction, from Nancy Drew to ? Henry.

For the Roys who have to maintain order in the face 

of a space crunch, indexing is under broader heads ? books on medicine are stored 

in two larger cabinets, including journals and magazines, while a third is dedicated 

to fiction.

?Once in three or four months we go through the cupboards 

and pick out books we aren?t using or titles everyone has read and put them away 

in trunks,? adds Pratip.

Lights

Lighting is crucial to read the books as much as it 

is to look for them. ?We have used white light for the reading table below, while 

the second floor has more charming yellow lighting,? explains Pratip.

Light inside bookcases is also a good idea. Though 

expensive, it adds to the ambience and facilitates the often long search.

In the Roy home, a study table with a reading lamp 

is the only frill space affords.

Furniture

Wooden furniture ? neither too formal nor too relaxed 

? is what Prasanta advocates. ?Big furniture adds to the weight of a reading room,? 

he feels.

?Since most smaller homes and flats don?t have the 

luxury of a separate room for a library, low-lying cabinets with drawers on rails 

is a good idea,? says interior designer Jayita Sinha. The top of the cabinet, 

she suggests, can double as a reading table, computer table or a space to stock 

more books. Glass-front cabinets will ensure that the volumes get a good display 

too.

New libraries could use wrought iron, cane or even 

plastic furniture. ?The furniture of the library should be in sync with the entire 

house. For a casual look, low chairs, bean bags and even cushions and dhurries 

can be used,? adds Sinha.

For enough light to support reading in the morning 

and evening, brighter, white light is preferred. ?For a cosy feel, however, a 

soft yellow light can be left on when no one is actually reading in the library,? 

signs off Sinha.

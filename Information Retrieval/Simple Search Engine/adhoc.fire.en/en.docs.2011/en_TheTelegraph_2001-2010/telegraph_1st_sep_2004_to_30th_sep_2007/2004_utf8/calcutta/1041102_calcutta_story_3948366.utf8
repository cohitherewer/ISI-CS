 Extortion spree at 

taxi stands 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA 

 The next time you hire a taxi from Bangur, Lake Town, Salt Lake or Rajarhat, be prepared to shell out a few extra bucks. 

 The money is the ?permission? fee to be paid to local CITU activists for their ?benevolence? in allowing passengers to board a vehicle.

 A group of people ? identifying themselves as functionaries of the CITU, labour wing of the CPM ? are regularly extorting money from drivers and passengers at several taxi stands in the area. 

 ?We pay the CITU men Rs 5 for every trip we make from the stand. If we refuse to pay, they will not allow us to park our vehicles at the stand. Besides, we will face all kinds of harassment on the road from police,? said Hari Shaw, a taxi driver at the Lake Town taxi stand. 

 Taxi drivers at the Baguiati and Karunamoyee stands, too, are victims of the racket. ?We charge the passengers the extra amount we pay to the CITU men,? said a driver at the Baguiati stand.

 The CITU leadership does not flinch in admitting to the practice. ?We allow these taxis to park illegally for the benefit of the passengers. We collect money from the drivers to employ people to man the road. There is nothing illegal in it,? argued Pramod Jha, secretary of the Lake Town unit of the CITU-affiliated West Bengal Taxi Workers Union. Jha even claimed that the fee is being collected after taking permission from police. 

 While 40 taxi drivers regularly pay the CITU men at the Baguiati stand, nearly 20 drivers pay up at the Lake Town stand. 

 At Karunamoyee, CITU men allow 30 taxis to queue up in two rows along the stretch between the bus stand and Central Park, against payment of the ?permission fee?. 

 ?Though they give us Rs 2 coupons, we have to pay Rs 5 for each coupon. If we do not buy the coupons, we will not be allowed to park at the stand,? said a taxi driver near Bonobitan, a few metres from Bikash Bhavan.

 The taxi drivers alleged that the CITU men share their booty with police.

 Police officers, while admitting that the problem exists, said no complaint has been lodged.

 ?This is, indeed, a type of extortion. If we get a specific complaint we will definitely take action,? said Praveen Kumar, police superintendent, North 24-Parganas. 

 Kali Ghosh, state committee member of the CITU, claimed no complaint has been filed regarding forcible collection of money. 

 ?This is a serious allegation and we will definitely look into it,? he promised.

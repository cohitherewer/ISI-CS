All play and little work

BABY'S Day IN

NISHA LAHIRI

Is your little devil straining at the leash at home? 

With boundless energy capable of bursting forth at the most inopportune moment, 

a home hath no fury as a baby bored. 

Well, have no fear, for there are a lot of constructive 

yet playful activities that you can experiment with on your tiny tots, to make 

them learn a little and have fun as well. The bonus is, the toddlers can be kept 

occupied for hours while you catch 40 winks or a cup of chai. 

?If the parents are tired, let the children enjoy 

some time by themselves. They need it, too,? says Joyoti Ghosh, principal of Joyland 

Play Nursery and Kindergarten. ?It gives them a chance to develop their imagination.?

Building blocks

It?s a wonderful way to teach your kids about sizes 

(grading from big to small or vice versa) and will also keep them busy for long. 

The best part is, they love breaking down the towers and rebuilding them over 

and over again. The brighter the blocks, the better ? it will also teach them 

about colours. But the blocks must be the right size ? not too large for the little 

hands but large enough so that being placed at odd angles doesn?t mean they?ll 

come tumbling down.

Brush with colours

Lots of crayons and big books with plenty of white 

space are the best. Let them run riot, but watch out for budding artists using 

the walls as canvas. Pictures of specific things, like fruits or vegetables, are 

a good way of teaching. Cartoon or storybook characters are also an enjoyable 

pastime. A baby book with lots of random images will let the children?s imagination 

run free. 

?Let the little ones scribble as much as they like, 

even if it?s messy,? adds Ghosh.

Little chefs

We only mean the non-fire kind. If you?re baking a 

cake, then mixing the dough is the best thing to give them. Let them lick the 

bowl afterwards. 

?Kneading the dough is an excellent way to develop 

finger muscles. Ata or maida is the best, with a little salt to 

make it springy. Making chapatis with belnis is a great way to develop 

wrist muscles. Both actions improve writing and colouring skills,? explains Ghosh. 

Letting them see the results, and tasting the food too, gives them a sense of 

accomplishment.

Match or thread

Matching and sorting are two of the best ways to learn. 

Pairing household items like cups and saucers or two socks, sifting through and 

separating rajma from chhola or different types of beads and buttons 

improve concentration. Just spread out the paraphernalia and watch them wonder. 

Threading beads is the best way to improve hand-eye coordination. Give them lots 

of big beads with large holes and colourful strings, and teach them to make necklaces. 

The toddlers will love undoing and redoing the task.

Puzzle pastime

Alphabets or animals, numbers or nursery rhymes, it?s 

a good way to keep the kids constructively occupied. But be sure to check the 

right age groups before buying puzzles, because if it?s too advanced then it?s 

no fun. Once again, the more they jumble the pieces and redo them, the happier 

they are. Sometimes, they?re just happy playing with the pieces.

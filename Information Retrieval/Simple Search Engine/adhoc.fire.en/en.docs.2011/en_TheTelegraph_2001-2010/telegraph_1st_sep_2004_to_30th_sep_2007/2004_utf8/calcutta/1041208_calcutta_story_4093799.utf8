 Deep south corridor to airport 

 SANJAY MANDAL AND DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Speed down from the southern fringes of the city to the airport, for the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is set to extend the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass up to Baruipur.

 ?It?s going to be a matter of minutes travelling from the southern fringes to Calcutta airport, and we solve the traffic congestion in south Calcutta to a large extent,? urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya told Metro on Tuesday. 

 ?Work on the project has formally started,? he said, adding that the widening of the Bypass from Ultadanga to the Science City island will begin soon. The CMDA?s latest initiative comes in the wake of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s plans to add ?wings to the city?. 

 According to CMDA officials, the extension of the Bypass from Kamalgazi to Baruipur, an 11-km stretch, will take about two years to complete. 

 Minister Bhattacharya said Rs 30 crore has been sanctioned for the extension project, while Rs 12 crore will be spent on widening the six-km Bypass stretch.

 The road will be laid along the western side of the Adi Ganga canal. ?Initially, the road will be two-lane but we have a provision for widening it, with two more lanes on the other side of the canal,? a senior CMDA official said. According to initial plans, a bridge will be built over the canal.

 The CMDA is planning the resuscitation of the Adi Ganga, too. ?We will hold talks with the irrigation department on how the canal can be revived. However, our priority is constructing the road,? the official said.

 The CMDA employees? union has welcomed the move. ?It was our long-time demand for starting the extension project, and we hope it will be finished within the target date,? said P.B. Nag, general secretary of the CMDA Staff Union, on Tuesday.

 Along with this, the CMDA is also taking up the widening of the Bypass from Ultadanga to the Science City island. Work on the six-km stretch will begin soon, officials said. The six-lane road will be widened to eight. 

 The widening work has been planned in two phases ? the first phase from Ultadanga to Science City, and the second from Science City to the Rashbehari Avenue connector junction.

 Work on the second phase ? widening the road from four to six lanes ? will be taken up at a later date.

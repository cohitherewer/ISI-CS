The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Showers signal on Monday

 OUR BUREAU

 Two persons were killed and two others injured in a wall collapse in Basak Bagan, on the northern fringes, on Sunday afternoon as heavy rain, accompanied by gusty winds, lashed the city and its adjoining areas since Saturday night.

Rain and squall have been forecast for Monday, too. 

?We expect heavy to very heavy rain in Calcutta and south Bengal over the next 

24 hours, owing to the depression that has developed,? said K.K. Chakraborty, 

director of the weather section at the Met office, which recorded 46.8 mm of rain 

between 5.30 pm on Saturday and 5.30 pm on Sunday .

 According to the police, around 2.20 pm on Sunday, the boundary wall of the Vehicles Training Institute in Basak Bagan gave way, following incessant rain, leaving four persons trapped under the debris. They were taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where Subhas Singh, 30, and Surajit Saha, 19, died.

 The non-stop downpour led to waterlogging on parts of Southern Avenue, Abdul Rasul Avenue, Regent Park and SP Mukherjee Road in south Calcutta and Sovabazar, Hatibagan, College Street and adjoining areas in north Calcutta.

 The power situation, too, is likely to be dismal on Monday if the CESC fails to start up its 250 MW thermal unit in Budge Budge. The unit was shut down on Saturday night after a snag developed in its boiler.

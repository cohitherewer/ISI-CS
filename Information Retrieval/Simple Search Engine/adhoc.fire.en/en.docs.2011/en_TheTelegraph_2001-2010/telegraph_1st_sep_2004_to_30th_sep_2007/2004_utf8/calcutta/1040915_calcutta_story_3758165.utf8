 Agent arrest on tip-off

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For the first time since Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) activities were detected in the city, a Pakistani national ?suspected to be a key operative ? was arrested on Tuesday afternoon. Acting on a tip-off, sleuths of the Calcutta Police detective department rounded up the suspect from Taltala.

 Mumtaz Ahmed Kureshi, 45, was arrested when he turned up to receive money from a local hawala operator. During preliminary interrogation, he said he was from the Sindh province of Pakistan.

 ?Kureshi is from Kohri village, in Dadu district. His father?s name is Nisar Ahmed Kureshi,? confirmed Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner (detective department). ?We are cross-examining him to find out what task he had been assigned.?

 Kureshi was netted on the basis of information supplied by Ali Bhai, alleged ISI agent arrested from a Bowbazar eatery on August 27. Another suspect, hawala operator Muzzaffarul Islam, was arrested when Ali, who had attended a three-month ISI training session in Karachi two years ago, was taking money from him.

 ?We laid a trap in a lane and officers took up position from noon. Kureshi arrived around 3 pm,? said a sleuth.

 During interrogation, Kureshi told detectives that he had come to the city three months ago not only to supervise and cross-check the information supplied by agents like Ali but also to collect information about the movements of the Indian Army.

 ?Karachi-Dhaka-Calcutta was the route he took to reach here,? said an official of the detective department. 

 Kureshi opted to live away from the city and rented a room under the name of Sahabuddin in Kankinara, on the northern fringes.

 According to detectives on the case, Kureshi would send information via e-mail. ?He used one or two particular cyber cafes,? said a detective, adding: ?We are going through the diary and papers found on him. We will search his Kankinara residence on Wednesday.?

 Elaborating on Kureshi?s role, a detective said: ?He collected specific information about army movements and sent it across to Pakistan.?

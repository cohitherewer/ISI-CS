The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Channels do a comeback 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 There is nothing official about it. But pressure from government-backed quarters ensured that the missing channels were back on screens on Friday. All three channel bouquets ? Zee-Turner, STAR and Sony ? returned within a few minutes of each other on the respective networks, where they had been unavailable for the past few days. 

 Zee-Turner had blacked out its channels on the network of multi-system operator (MSO) RPG Netcom on September 2, alleging huge outstandings.

 In what was seen as a retaliatory move, RPG Netcom ? distributor of the STAR and Sony bouquets ? then switched off the two on Calcutta Communications (CalCom), a unit of the Zee-owned MSO SitiCable on September 7, citing arrears and non-submission of correct subscriber base information, among other issues. 

 Zee-Turner then slapped a legal notice on RPG Netcom, claiming that payments for cheques had bounced.

 But Friday saw peace prevail on all fronts.

 ?We had a positive discussion with RPG Netcom and resolved all the issues,? said Siddharth Jain, COO, Zee-Turner, who came down from Delhi with the prime agenda of working out a solution.

 The Zee-Turner channels returned to nearly eight lakh households under RPG Netcom around 5 pm. Soon after, the STAR and Sony bouquets were back on beam in the 1.5 lakh CalCom homes.

 According to officials of SitiCable and RPG Netcom, truce had been reached in view of a meeting of MSOs, scheduled to take place on Saturday. Apart from RPG Netcom and SitiCable, Manthan and CableComm are also expected to meet to discuss the various problems plaguing the local cable industry. They will also try to frame guidelines for the trade.

 After days of deliberations among the warring parties, however, what really paved the way was apparently a missive from the administration: first restore beam to the consumers, then resolve your differences.

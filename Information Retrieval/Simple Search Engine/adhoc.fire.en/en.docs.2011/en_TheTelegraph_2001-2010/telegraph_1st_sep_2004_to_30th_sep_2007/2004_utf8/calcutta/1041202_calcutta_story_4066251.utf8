 What We are Watching

BIG SCREEN

Love 'n' lust

 Shah Rukh and Preity: Popular pick 

Veer-Zaara (U)

 Yash Chopra is back, with more mush and melody. The raja of romance reigns supreme, with King Khan the crowning glory in this tale of love beyond borders. 

 Catch it at INOX Forum: 12.55 pm, 4.35 pm, 8.15 pm. City Centre: 12.25 pm, 4.05 pm, 7.45 pm

 Why bother? The Yash Chopra magic is evident at the box office. The weekend collections at the multiplexes are above 90 per cent and things are only looking up with no competition in sight. The lead pair of Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta repeats the magic of Kal Ho Naa Ho. But it?s Rani Mukherjee who?s drawing all the accolades in the role of a lawyer. The cameo by the Big B, as King Khan?s father, is another talking point.

Disclosed: Hot pair 

 Aitraaz (U/A)

 It?s time for Disclosure at the box office, desi style. Priyanka Chopra does a Demi, cornering macho man Akshay Kumar. Kareena Kapoor plays docile damsel, only to steal the show in the second half.

 Catch it at INOX Forum: 2.45 pm, 5.50 pm, 8.55 pm. City Centre: 1.25 pm, 6.15 pm, 9.15 pm.

 Why bother? If nothing else, you must check out the Akshay-Priyanka chemistry and watch the former Miss World muddle her movie metaphors by bringing a bit of Basic Instinct, Sharon Stone-style, to Disclosure.

 A celebration of shakti

 The eternal force of this Universe is dominated by Mahakaali, whose energy is manifested in the form of shakti, the divine power. She is the mother, the daughter, the Eternal Woman, the creator and the protector of life. Her shakti finds expression through all women, who live out their daily existence battling against all odds. The ongoing exhibition of paintings, Shakti ? a celebration of women power, by eminent danseuse Madhuboni Chatterjee, is an effort to pay tribute to the unsung glory of Everywoman. Her sensitively portrayed images of women, visualised as mother, warrior, worker, dancer or dreamer, show them in starkly diverse roles, leading lives with true grit, determination and passion, progressing with courage and quiet dignity towards their chosen destination. The extraordinary struggles of these ordinary women have an amazing quality to inspire the artist and the viewer alike to search for that power within themselves and hence discover their own inner beings.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Madhuboni Chatterjee

 When: Till October 19, 11 am - 8 pm

 Where: Gallery Kanishka?s, 2/1 Hindusthan Road, Calcutta - 700029

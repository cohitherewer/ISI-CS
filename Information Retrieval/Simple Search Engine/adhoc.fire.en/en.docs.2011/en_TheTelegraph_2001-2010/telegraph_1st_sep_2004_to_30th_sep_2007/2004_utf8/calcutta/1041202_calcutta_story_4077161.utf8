The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 By the river of Bengal

 An exhibition entitled ?Europe on the Ganges? opened on Tuesday evening at the Oxford Bookstore, sponsored by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) and Alliance Francaise de Calcutta. It was meant to develop awareness about the French, Danish and British settlements that had thrived since the 16th Century along what was originally called the Bhagirathi but is better known today as the Hooghly.

 An exhibition of photographs has been mounted focusing on the architectural treasures in sites such as Barrackpore, Serampore and Chandernagore, along with texts on each site. 

 INTACH has produced a film on CD to exploit the tourism potential of these former settlements, which still look quite picturesque, although many of them are in ruins. 

 Live performances of French music and readings from Francoise Sagan were held on Wednesday. 

 This is, however, not the first time that such a commendable effort has been made. In the past too, river cruises and excellent photographic exhibitions have been organised to promote awareness. 

 But, in spite of all the publicity these events attract, little of value gets done, for they end up as society dos. Few grassroots people ever have access to these, because many may find the elitism quite intimidating.

 Actually, there is so much to be seen down the river that it would be inconceivable to anyone who has not sailed down it. 

 The ruins of the many mills and factories that dot the banks could themselves provide a wonderful picture of the industrial upsurge that Bengal experienced when these foreign powers chose to settle down here. But unless the administration works in tandem with these well-intentioned organisations, it would be impossible for them to achieve anything of worth.

 Sting check for mayor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Spare yourself the sting even if you can?t save the city. 

 Such an idea must have impelled mayor Subrata Mukherjee to instal a chemical anti-mosquito gadget in his office at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation at a time when the incidence of malaria is alarmingly on the rise in the city. 

 ?I don?t think the mosquitoes in my office are malaria-carriers but their sting smarts a lot,? said Mukherjee, with a smile, in his room in the presence of mayoral council member (health) Pradip Ghosh. 

 Though Ghosh declined comment, there are others very critical of the move. ?The Trinamul Congress board should be ashamed. At the same time, we must appreciate Subratababu?s boldness in accepting the reality by installing these gadgets and admitting that the civic health department has failed in controlling malaria,? said Nirmal Mukherjee, Left Front Opposition leader.

 CPM councillor and MP Sudhanshu Sil said testing of blood samples and treatment of malaria are only the secondary jobs for the civic health department. 

 The primary responsibility is to check the breeding of mosquitoes in and around the city, and the Trinamul board has failed to carry out that.

 According to Opposition leader Mukherjee, the officer on special duty (health) is busy with private practice and, even in the peak malaria season, never available in his office beyond 5 pm. 

 However, officer on special duty Atanu Mukherjee claimed that the overall incidence of malaria and the infection that causes malignant malaria till September is lower than previous years.

 ?Fearing that malaria may play havoc this year between October and January, owing to the inaction of the civic health department, the officer on special duty and his team have started preparing technical grounds to fudge the figures,? alleged Sudhanshu Sil. 

 Atanu Mukherjee retaliated by saying the malaria toll is declared by the state government and, therefore, cannot be concealed. ?However, without a positive blood slide report, I am not ready to accept any malarial death claim, even if the death certificate is issued by a doctor,? he added.

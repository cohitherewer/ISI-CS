 An ode to imagination

 Imagination, as defined by Coleridge, is the power to conjure up images in the minds eye. Envisioned in the minds of the artist, imagination breaks forth in a riot of objects, forms and colours to present an altogether new impression of the world as we see it around us. The ongoing art exhibition, Images and Imagination - Part II, is part of a continuing effort to celebrate and pay tribute to the creative excellence of some of our leading contemporary artists. Featuring works by M. F. Husain, Bikash Bhattacharjee, Ganesh Haloi, Jayashree Chakravarty, G. R. Santosh, Krishna Reddy, Prabhakar Kolte and Lalu Prasad Shaw (picture above), among others, the paintings on show represent an interesting mix of the modern and the traditional, the rustic and the sophisticated, the sober and the savage. In a wide variety of themes, styles and media, the collection on display is a veritable visual treat for the art connoisseur and art lover alike, and promises to refresh the viewer?s aesthetic senses.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings, Images and Imagination - Part II

 When: Till November 30 (except Sunday); 3 pm - 7 pm

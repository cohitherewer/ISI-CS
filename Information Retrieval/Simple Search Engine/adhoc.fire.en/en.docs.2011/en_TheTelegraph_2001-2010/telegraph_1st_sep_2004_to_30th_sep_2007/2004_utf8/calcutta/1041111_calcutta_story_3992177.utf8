The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

LO-CAL

Derek O'Brien

I was in school when my father, Neil OBrien, conducted the 

first ever Eddie Hyde Memorial Quiz. I remember him trawling through his diary, 

fishing out the very best questions and jotting them down. There were no word 

processors and printers those days! Nor were there any sponsors and lavish budgets. 

Although times have changed and quizzing today has acquired a much greater following 

than it did way back in the1960s, some things remain unchanged. The quizzing standard 

at the Eddie Hyde Quiz, scheduled for November 13, 2004, at 4 pm, is one of them. 

Unfortunately, it clashes with the India-Pakistan tie at Eden Gardens. Here?s 

a bonus six questions on this historic stadium.

QUESTIONS

PHYSI-CAL

1. If one end of the Eden Gardens is called the Pavilion 

End, what is the name of the other end?

2. When a fire engulfed the pavilion following a riot at 

the Eden Gardens on New Years Day in 1967, which cricketer gallantly ventured 

to rescue the Indian and West Indian flags?

3. Till date, who has scored the most ODI runs at Eden Gardens?

4. Against which team did Anil Kumble take his career best 

ODI record of six wickets for just 12 runs at the Eden Gardens?

5. Apart from Sachin Tendulkar, who is the only other Indian 

to score an ODI century at Eden Gardens?

6. Which part of the Eden Gardens stadium was built in 1871?

 TOPI-CAL

HISTORI-CAL Not everybody has 

something nice to say about Calcutta. Famous people have called it, ?a dying city? 

and ?the city of dreadful nights?. But one of the most hard-hitting comments is 

by the German author, Gunter Grass, ?Why not write a poem about a bloody great 

mess that was dropped by God and called Calcutta. About how it throngs, smells, 

lives and gets even bigger.? We dont agree, Mr Grass!

ANSWERS

1. High Court End; 2. Conrad Hunte; 3. Sachin Tendulkar, in nine 

matches he has scored 470 runs; 4. West Indies; 5. K. Srikkanth; 6. The Pavilion

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Take father?s job, dump mother

 OUR BUREAU

 The civic body has a problem on its hands: young employees are deserting their mothers after getting jobs on compassionate grounds following the death of their fathers while still on the payroll of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 ?This is taking on the dimension of an epidemic. We?re getting distress letters from widows almost daily, alleging that their sons are living separately after marriage,? said mayor Subrata Mukherjee. 

 The letters from deserted mothers broadly belong to two categories, pointed out deputy municipal commissioner (personnel) Samiresh Chatterjee.

 The most frequent complaint is that a mother is being forced to survive on a meagre widow?s pension as the son has moved out after getting a job on compassionate grounds. Some mothers also complain that their sons have deserted them after getting married.

 All of them seek the CMC?s intervention to help them get back their sons. 

 Binapani Das (not her real name), a resident of Palpara, wrote to the civic body that her husband was a block sarkar in the conservancy department. He died a premature death in 1994. The couple had a son and two daughters. The son was inducted in the CMC in 1997. 

 Three years later, he got married and soon after, bought a flat and shifted into it with his wife. The mother now has to fend for herself and her two unmarried daughters on the family pension.

 Kalpana Dhar, whose son was a civic employee, has a different problem. After her son?s death, his widow was recruited by the CMC. But two years into the job, she remarried and left the Dhars. 

 ?The service rules cannot tackle this problem,? was mayor Mukherjee?s candid admission. The rules only specify that to replace a ?died-in-harness? employee, a woman has to be widow at the time of recruitment.

 The state government, which had been forced by a funds crunch to stop appointing family members of employees who die in harness, decided on Tuesday to restart the practice. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta will draft a policy, which will be circulated among the ministers.

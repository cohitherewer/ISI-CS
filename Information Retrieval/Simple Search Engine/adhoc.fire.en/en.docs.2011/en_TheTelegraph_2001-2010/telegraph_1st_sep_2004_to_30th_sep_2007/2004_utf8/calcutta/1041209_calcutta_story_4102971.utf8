Rhythm, roots and quest

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 Mamata Shankar performs with her troupe at the Uday Shankar birth centenary celebration last year 

 Right now, her Triangular Park address resembles a chaotic military camp ? her dancer-soldiers nodding prompt attendance by 9 am every day and the day stretching well past midnight, consulting activity charts, organising cars for pick-ups and drops, workshop schedules, accommodation for the visitors ? right down to the curtains in their rooms and flowers to greet them with. All squeezed within endless rehearsals for the final act.

 High on the 25th anniversary celebration of her ballet troupe ? Mamata Shankar is busy making sense of ?sheer madness?. 

 On Wednesday afternoon, she said: ?The plans for the 10-day-long silver anniversary celebration will include workshops, seminars and performances. Eminent performers from the World Dance Alliance (Asia Pacific chapter) will conduct workshops and seminars, with over 60 dancers from all over Bengal. For most of our guests, this will be their first Indian sojourn.?

 While Sheryl Stock from Australia, Hsiu Ping Chang from Taiwan and Mew Chang Psing from Malaysia will be holding workshops at Nehru Children?s Museum and Rabindra Sadan between December 10 and 16, this weekend will see seminars attended by Basilio Estaeban Villaruz from the Philippines, Mohammad Anis Mohammad Nor from Malaysia and others. 

 Francis Ring, an acclaimed aboriginal dancer, is slated to be a special draw at the programmes. The celebrations will be rounded up by two performances by the Mamata Shankar Ballet Troupe on December 19 and 20.

 Shankar added: ?The idea is to hold on to the roots of our own rich cultural traditions and innovate. Do something new, which is not merely a fusion of the East and West. My father always asked me to do that??

 Keeping her father?s ideals in mind, the state government and West Bengal Dance Group Federation rolled off the annual Uday Shankar Nrityautsav on Wednesday. 

 With performances by the Indian Classical Dance Troupe from Japan, and programmes on the Manipuri, Kathak, Bharatnatyam, Odissi, Kathakali, Mohiniattam, Mayurbhanj Chhau dance forms, the festival will keep the crowds busy at Rabindra Sadan till December 14.

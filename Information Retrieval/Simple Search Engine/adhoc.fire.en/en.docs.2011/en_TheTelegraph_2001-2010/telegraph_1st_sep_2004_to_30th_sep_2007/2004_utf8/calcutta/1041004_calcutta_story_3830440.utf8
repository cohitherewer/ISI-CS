The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The ?dream project? of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of building 

connecting flyovers from Kona Expressway to Mumbai Road and Delhi Road has come 

to a standstill after his party lost the elections. Shouldn?t the present government 

take over the work and complete the so-far-well-done job on time? It is very difficult 

to use the national highways, especially during monsoon. More mishaps on these 

stretches wouldn?t be surprising. The state should look into the matter, especially 

because it is trying to improve the state?s infrastructure to lure investors.

 Recently a cashier at the State Bank of Mysore, Rashbehari Avenue branch, refused 

to ratify my signature on the grounds that it was in green ink. She said that 

only auditors are allowed to sign/write in green ink. She relented after I politely 

inquired which section of the Negotiable Instruments Act had such a provision. 

Would it not be better if the staff of reputed banks are a little more acquainted 

with banking laws and rules?

 I was caught talking over my mobile phone while driving by a cop near Park 

Circus a few days ago. However, he let me off with only a warning as I was attending 

to an emergency. But then, taking calls while driving is a big risk. It 

will be justified on the part of the authorities if they adopt a stiff penalty 

system.

Hair experts at Mapui salon showcase five 

styles that can add sparkle to your looks as you go partying this Diwali

style; Ronita showcases the Secret Affairs look; Aarti wears some Chic Curls. 

As you prepare to light up your home with diyas 

in the next few days, it?s also time to add sparkle to your looks by flaunting 

some ethnic clothes, flashing heavy jewellery and donning a dash of colours on 

your eyes and cheeks. And while you decide to stick to the traditional with your 

looks, try and give a trendy twist to your hairstyle this Diwali. 

Mapui hair and beauty studio, in association with 

Wella, showcased a few innovative hairdos for the festive days.

?Each of my trends have been inspired by Wella International?s 

trend vision called Window with a View. They are new-age looks that should work 

wonders for youngsters and boost their confidence,? says Mapuii, who has been 

in the business of grooming tresses in India and abroad and now owns this brand 

new salon in Chakraberia.

If you want to tread the safe-look path, the following 

styles are definitely not for you. But if you want to get a little creative and 

make an impact, especially in the clubbing scene, these are sure to turn a few 

heads. 

Folk feathers

Model Nandini is given the style Tales of Folk ? a 

feather cut with light, soft curls at the base. The colours used on the hair are 

a mixture of various shades of earthy warm browns. Blonde highlights accentuate 

the colours by giving them a slight sun-bleached effect. 

?The look is more visually diverse than with definite 

lines. The pattern itself is simple and subtle and not flamboyant,? says Mapuii. 

Secret style 

Model Ronita showcases the Secret Affairs style, which 

is basically straight long hair cut in soft long layers. ?The haircut makes my 

obviously round face look longer,? she says. 

The look is sensuous, not immature. And as the trend 

suggests, the colours range from warm to cool tints of red, burgundy and copper 

on a brown base. 

Chic curls

This style is not exactly out of the ordinary. It 

is a rather common hairdo made to look stylish. Model Aarti?s hair has been coloured 

in a global brown tone with caramel streaks running in regular lines through the 

length of the hair. The tresses have been given a pointy razor cut with soft curls 

at the ends turned out.

Urban upstart

Those belonging to this category are more outrageous, 

rebellious and rather unique. The disconnected colours used in this style called 

Urban Manifesto are bold and dominant. 

The colours could be anything from pink and yellow 

to blue or orange. 

The emphasis is on creating a new personal statement. 

Model Ashraf calls it the ?Thai hip-hop look?. He wears a range of colours that 

include blonde, blue and green on his hair.

Strange streaks

Model Abbas sports the weird look that is just right 

for partying and nights of revelry. The rebellious streak falls through here as 

well but with a crazier aura. While the back hair colour has been left black, 

light green streaks race around the hair in front and on the sides.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flurry to find fake notes 

 - Rs 50 lakh duds spread in city markets over eight months

 PRONAB MONDAL 

 Police have launched a massive hunt for fake currency notes in the denomination of Rs 500, totalling Rs 50 lakh, that have been spread in city markets in the past eight months allegedly by ISI-controlled agents.

 Officers from the detective department?s note forgery wing have been asked to work round-the-clock to track down those who have received the fake notes.

 The spread of fake notes came to light after sleuths netted three persons, including a Bangladeshi national, from Free School Street on Saturday. Fake notes worth Rs 2.5 lakh were seized from them.

 City police were tipped off about the three by their counterparts in Mumbai. 

 ?Cops there stumbled upon the racket after arresting Mohammad Rashid in Calcutta in a joint raid with us. Rashid, arrested in connection with spreading fake notes in Mumbai, told them that a well-organised racket was active both in Mumbai and Calcutta,? said an officer of the detective department.

 During the course of interrogation, sleuths came to know that the arrested trio had spread fake notes worth Rs 5 lakh in city markets. 

 ?Arrested Bangladeshi national Ehsas Habib had visited the city twice before and had spread fake notes through his local contacts,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police, detective department.

 ?The fake notes that Habib and his accomplices had distributed in and around the city were worth not less than Rs 50 lakh,? said an officer. 

 According to officers working on the case, if the fake currencies have already started circulating in city markets, it will be impossible for a lay person to identify them.

 ?The quality of the fake notes is so fine that we, too, found no difference between a genuine Rs 500 note and a fake one,? informed an officer. 

 ?A team of experts from the Reserve Bank of India confirmed that the notes were fake and not printed anywhere in India,? he added. 

 Detectives later said the notes were printed in Karachi, Pakistan.

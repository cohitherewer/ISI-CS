The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All play for kids to help you party better

Looking 

for a safe place to leave your kids while you catch up on some last minute shopping? 

Kool Kidz, a ?secret? forest party zone at the Enclave Mall in Alipore is a brand 

new option at hand to consider.

 Formally inaugurated on Thursday with actress June dropping by to strike the usual pose, the 2,000-sq ft hangout boasts of a play zone along with a cafeteria, on the same lines as the one at Forum. 

 The venue is also being pitched for kiddie parties for folks who?d rather shell out a bomb than see their house being turned into a war zone. . 

 The play area has colourful moulded plastic, non-toxic toys apart from computers with unlimited CD ROMS that are both entertaining and educative. 

 A mini caf? serving sandwiches, burgers, French fries, pizzas, rolls, hot dogs and shakes is meant to recharge little batteries when and if they run out of steam. 

 If they clamour to carry the fun home, you?ll have to bribe them with toys from Little Tikes, available for sale.

 While kids largely have a free run here, there are still certain dos and don?ts to be adhered to. Children above 11 years aren?t allowed in. Those who pass the age test have to be accompanied by one adult and no shoes are allowed in the play premises. 

 Entry fees are Rs 65 per hour on weekdays and Rs 75 per hour on weekends.

 Pandal-hopping in chunky neckpieces or danglers is out. What with the surging crowds, predicted rain and humidity supposed to be the order of the four Puja days, going light on jewels is the sensible thing to do. 

 P.C. Chandra seems to have the answer in the Goldlites range of handcrafted light-weight jewellery launched recently. Merging eastern and western design elements, the 22 karat gold jewellery is priced to suit the pockets of college students and young professionals. Starting at Rs 2,000, the collection includes a wide variety of pendant sets, chains, lockets, earrings and necklaces to help accessorise the festive gear.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Amrita Arora: Telly charge

 Music videos for more reasons than one have become as important as item numbers these days. Everyone in Bollywood, from superstars (Shah Rukh, Salman, Aamir, Rani) to the not-so-famous, have made sure that they gyrate to some Indipop or remix track and make their presence felt on the airwaves of the small screen.

 The latest two to join the video bandwagon are Zayed Khan and Amrita Arora. The music video in question comes from none other than remix king DJ Aqeel who ruled the small box some months back with the mix of Keh doon tumhe.

 This new album from Universal has Aqeel going the Bollywood way again with Disco 82. A return to the 80s, Disco 82 tries to capture the invasion of Bollywood music by the disco beat from the west. Borrowing from what was a rage in that decade, the Rubik?s cube, the whole video is set inside one. Each block of the cube tells a story and is represented by Zayed and Amrita ? the ?hero? and the ?heroine? amongst a host of other characters.

Adnan Sami: Top of the pops

 He has been high on music in the recent past, having sung on almost every Bollywood soundtrack, composed tracks for some of them, got big-screen biggies to appear on his Indipop videos and even singlehandedly judged one of the biggest talent hunt shows in the country. And now Adnan Sami is Channel [V]?s Chosen One for all of the month of November.

 The Pakistani native, who was raised in the UK, made it in the Indian music industry with his smash hit album Kabhi To Nazar Milao which broke all records. His Bollywood foray was fashioned by the popularity of his tracks in Ajnabee, Saathiya, Yuva and more recently, Naach. While other television channels roped in multiple judges for their talent hunt shows, Adnan was given the sole responsibility of picking Channel [V]?s Super Singer. 

 Now you can catch the talented musician reveal all about his latest album Teri Kasam as he is captured in an intimate tete-a-tete in [V] Chosen One Special. So, don?t forget to tune your ears to Channel [V] on Sunday, November 28, at 9 pm.

 Continuing its gripping reality based series on Star News, this week, Red Alert features a half-hour special on a mysterious story where a phone call from the dead opens up a Pandora?s box of crime and deceit. Lalit?s wife, Sandhya, was found ?burned to death? in their house. 

 Barely 15 days after this incident, Lalit received a call from an unidentified woman whose voice resembled that of Sandhya. The police swung into action. Focused investigation and statements from neighbours revealed the real drama.

 Sandhya was indeed alive and she was living with her erstwhile lover, a carpenter, who worked in their house. Both had cooked up a vicious plan for their new life. The duo got hold of a girl through a pimp and burned her to prove that Sandhya was dead. The plan intended to book Lalit for his wife?s suicide.

 Also on this week?s Red Alert, find out how Bindu Singh, a deadly gangster in Patna, terrorises people, operating from jail. 

 Anchored by Jeetendra Dixit, this crime special on television is aired every Saturday with two repeats the following Sunday. The Saturday date with crime is at 11.30 pm on Star News.

Elvis Presley: Back in time

 If you think good documentaries on music are hard to come by these days, you?re absolutely right. Which is why you must catch Imagination on BBC World. The series is currently featuring Walk On By: The Story of Popular Song, a ?walk down the yellow brick road through 100 years of music history?.

 From the popular songs sold as sheet music on Tin Pan Alley at the turn of the 20th century to the billion-dollar pop industry of today, the series explores the development of the modern music industry on both sides of the Atlantic. Some of the most revered music veterans speak about their parts in shaping music on the programme.

 On air every Saturday since November 6, the November 20 episode showcases The Road to Rock ?n? Roll. Taking the dramatic effect of Elvis Presley?s first performance on American television as the cue, the documentary tries to trace the complex way in which musical forms such as blues, country, gospel and jazz developed to give birth to rock ?n? roll. Archive footage of legendary performers such as Muddy Waters, BB King, Hank Williams, Ray Charles and Van Morrison is also featured.

 The week after, it?s a look at the new generation of record buyers growing up in 1950s America with Producer Pop, while the December 4 show chronicles the British invasion.

 Worried over the possible entry of chemically-treated cashew nuts and lozenges, used to deck up pandals, into markets after the Pujas, mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Thursday ordered the civic health department to slap notices on the organisers, asking them to hand over the decorative pieces to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. 

 Enhanced External Counterpulsation treatment (EECP) has been introduced at the BM Birla Heart Research Centre. The EECP technique is a non-invasive, outpatient procedure to relieve angina by improving perfusion in the areas of the heart deprived of adequate blood supply. The treatment brings relief for patients with coronary artery disease.

 The civic body has started restoring Asia?s first gas-operated crematorium at 2, Crematorium Street, near the Nonapukur tram depot, Park Circus. The crematorium, now defunct, came up in 1903 at a cost of Rs 34,000.

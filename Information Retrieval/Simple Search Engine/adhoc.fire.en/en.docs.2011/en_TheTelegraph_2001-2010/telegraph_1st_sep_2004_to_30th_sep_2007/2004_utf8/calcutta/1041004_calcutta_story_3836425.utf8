 Post-Puja crater cover in Salt Lake

 SANJAY MANDAL

 ROUGH RIDE 

 Total length of road in Salt Lake and added area: 

around 260 km

Specifications of road repair by the technical committee 

(after Pujas): 

Type 1: five-inch thick

Type 2: three-inch thick

Type 3: less than 2.5 inches thick

Type 4 (inside blocks): one-inch thick

Prospective pandal-hoppers in Salt Lake have no option but to brace for a bumpy ride in Pujas 2004. 

 For, the township?s civic body has decided to undertake major repair of the roads, some of which practically need to be relaid, only after the festival.

 ?Major repairs will have to wait for the Pujas to end. Before that, we?ll try to take up some partial repairs,? said Dilip Gupta, chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality. 

 ?Before the overhaul, the six-member technical team, set up to oversee the repairs, will have to conduct a survey and submit the report,? he added. 

 The team, appointed last month by the urban development department, has just begun the survey. 

 According to Banibrata Gupta, committee member and chief civic engineer, the survey will be ?extensive and will measure the length and breadth of the roads?. 

 The panel has two representatives each from the urban development department, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and the civic body. 

 Once the report is submitted and the budget worked out, funds will be allotted to the three agencies. 

 According to officials, roads in Sector III of the township are particularly alarming. The stretch between Labony Island and Broadway needs thorough repair, as does Second Avenue from tank No. 9 to CA island, which needs 70 per cent overhauling 

 Residents have resented the delay in repairing the roads. ?Most of the roads are in bad shape. Last year, too, we had a similar experience,? complained Ramen Das, secretary of Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Welfare Association. 

 He alleged that the authorities had used only bricks for the repairs last year. 

 ?As a result, the township got almost covered by a blanket of dust, causing considerable damage to human beings and environment alike. We will resist any move to repeat the process this year,? Das asserted. 

 Of the roads in the township, the CMDA, on the municipality?s request, maintains the one from Prashashan Bhavan island to Karunamoyee and the Salt Lake-EM Bypass crossing. 

 The urban development department maintains Broadway and all roads in Sector V.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Net sales, net gains, neat give ?n? take

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 GenX comprises the bulk of on-line buyers and sellers

 It starts as a curiosity (as a buyer) and ends with a full pocket (as a seller). And everyone?s invited. The on-line market is becoming big in India. ?There has not been a single year when we have registered less than 100 per cent growth,? beamed senior manager Samarjeet Singh, whose company baazee.com does business of ?a couple of hundred crores every year?.

 The growth in sales, however, is geographically uneven. If Bangalore and Hyderabad top the list of e-buyers, Calcutta lags behind even Imphal. But the lack of local buyers has not stopped city sellers from logging on. The market, after all, is big, especially after baazee?s incorporation with ebay, the world?s biggest on-line auctioneer with a 114-million client base.

 On the stage at Vidya Mandir recently were a clutch of entrepreneurs who have been doing business on baazee. And hanging on to their words was a near-capacity crowd looking for a launch pad.

 ?Anything sells on the Net,? declared Aman Chopra, an MBA. He cited how his old pair of Reebok shoes found a buyer. Sixty-something Navneet K. Gupta, who deals in goods worth lakhs every month, named three keys to products that find favour: fair pricing, uniqueness and utility. Cellphones (both old and new) and jewellery (including a lot of diamonds) change hands most frequently on the Net. ?Even in a bad month, we sell close to a crore?s worth of jewellery,? Singh pointed out. In Calcutta, it is electronic goods that sell most. During Rakhi and Diwali, there is a demand for sweets, nuts and clothes.

 The advantages of on-line buying, said chartered accountant Pankaj Maloo, are availability and value for money. ?You would visit five-six shops before taking a purchase decision. On the Net, you have 40 people offering the same product, giving you a range of products and prices.? 

 If on-line accessibility is an option in the metros, in small towns it is a luxury. ?Places like Jhansi, Saharanpur and Bhatinda lap up the MP3 players and UPS drives,? laughed Chopra. 

 GenX comprises the bulk of both buyers and sellers. Take Soumyashubhra Ghosh. A Class IX student of South Point, he has sold computers in his first six months. ?I got the idea from a friend,? he smiled. ?Young executives post their items via the office computer during lunch breaks,? Singh added.

 The sellers were mobbed for tips after the presentation. ?Business is on the downslide. Nor will we get a job at this age. This is the best way to earn from home,? Gupta told silver-haired visitors. Housewife Mitu Dugar and school teacher Modira Dasgupta did not need any coaxing. ?This is a great place to sell off unwanted gifts,? said Dasgupta. Dugar was more excited at the thought of manning an e-counter for her brother?s toy shop. 

 Last checked on the site, a couple of toothpastes were up for auction. Perhaps they have reached their destined set of teeth by now.

Ray amp; sense of rich history

 Peter Goldsworthy lives in Adelaide, has never been to India before, but equates a woman?s predicament in his novel to the one ?that plagued Tagore?s sister-in-law, as she was caught between two brothers in Jorasanko?.

 It?s the first time in India for Tim Winton, too. But he is thankful for a foreign language film channel in Perth, which is where he caught one of his ?favourite movies so far ? Satyajit Ray?s Home and the World?.

 Compared with the others, Kate Grenville is an ?old India hand?, having been here once earlier to shoot films on families in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and other places. And ever since, she has been a fan of the film genre to which The Apu Trilogy belongs.

 Though in the city for book-reading sessions, Australian authors Goldsworthy, Winton and Grenville would like to wish and believe that ?Calcutta will be a much deeper and interesting place? than the other cities they have visited so far.

 Having not had much of a run of the city, save the trip from the airport, Winton, winner of the Miles Franklin and NBC Awards in Australia for his novel Cloudstreet, said: ?Compared with New Delhi, Calcutta has a distinct throbbing life of its own. In Delhi, on our way to the city from the airport, we came across tidy, impersonal boulevards and high walls, behind which, we were sure, some life existed. Calcutta, on the other hand, comes across as a city where people really live??

 Grenville, winner of the 2001 Orange Prize for fiction, added: ?Our idea about Calcutta was that it was a beautiful but decaying city. And truly you feel a sense of rich history here and want to know the city better.?

 Goldsworthy, author of Three Dog Night, said: ?I was introduced at a young age to Indian writing by my father, who had given me a collection of R.K. Narayan?s works. Later, I read Tagore on my own and despite the rather quaint English translation, I loved every bit of it.? 

 For all three, this trip could be just the right platform to find out that special connection between Australia and India ? ?earlier part of the same landmass and under the same colonising power?. As Winton put it: ?We were more than neighbours once. There must be a connection between friends somewhere, right??

Way in the wilderness

Chandana

Last year in September I visited the Shamwari Game 

Reserve situated in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Spread over 49,000 acres, 

this private game reserve boasts of five eco-systems, supporting many forms of 

plant, animal and bird life.

I decided to stay at the Long Lee Manor (situated 

within the reserve) overlooking the Bushmans river valley. On my first night there, 

I woke up to the screeching of monkeys, signalling the proximity of a wild animal. 

My heart started pounding at the thought of the majestic lion or graceful leopard 

being close by. I couldn?t wait to go into the wild.

At 4 am the next day, after a briefing by the guide, 

we left for game viewing in an open Land Rover. We had a trained ranger with us 

who answered all our queries about flora and fauna. The rangers are in two-way 

communication with each other at all times, so on any day they know where the 

game is and how to track it down.

We first spotted the deer drinking at the watering 

hole. Then the rhinos, hippos and zebras. Crocodiles and alligators in the damp, 

giraffes strolling around. After a wait of two hours, we finally spotted the majestic 

lioness with her cubs feasting on a kill, while the male kept watch. We were only 

10 m away from them.

At dusk, the Land Rover stopped at a panoramic spot 

for a sundowner. And that?s where we saw a herd of elephants. By 8 pm, I was back 

at the lodge, with loads of memories of the day?s discoveries.

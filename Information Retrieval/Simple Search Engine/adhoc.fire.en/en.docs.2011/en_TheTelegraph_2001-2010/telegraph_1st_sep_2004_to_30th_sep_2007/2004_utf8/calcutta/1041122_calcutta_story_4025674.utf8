 Let?s not intellectualise comedy: Akshaye

 Bollywood?s ?thinking actor? Akshaye Khanna is back after the disastrous Deewaar for the latest Priyadarshan comedy Hulchul. He speaks to Pratim D. Gupta about his new film and why he and Kareena make a great pair.

 What is your character in Hulchul?

 The character does not really matter. See, there are some films which are essentially character-driven and there are some which are plot-driven. Hulchul is a film where one plot leads to another. I do play a normal college going lad but there?s no great characterisation here. Yes, I am the hero of the film. But it?s the fantastic story which is the USP. 

 So it is a typical Priyadarshan laugh riot?

 The genre is romantic comedy. To me, it is full of dhamaal, a paisa vasool film going experience. It also has a lot of high drama and is loaded with emotions. All of us associated with the film are really happy with the product. Sometimes what we imagine and what comes out do not really match. But not so with Hulchul, it?s shaped up really well.

 You have already done a comedy with Priyadarshan 

in Hungama. Are you repeating yourself?

 Yes, both of them are comedies but they are totally different. People shouldn?t expect Hulchul to be a sequel to Hungama. In fact, I feel Hulchul is a lot better than Hungama. 

 But with the same director it does fall in the 

same school of comedy?

 See, Priyadarshan has a huge range. He has done all types of films from Gardish to Virasat to Hera Pheri. While he can do all genres, I think comedy is his forte. He is very good at it.

 How different do you think is the Hulchul 

brand of comedy from Dil Chahta Hai?

 Priyan?s comedy is slapstick, over the top, unlike Farhan?s, which is quite subtle. But both are fun to watch. Hulchul again is a bit of both ? subtle and situational. See, you can?t really define comedy. It is anything which makes you laugh. Why intellectualise comedy?

 How was it working with Kareena for the first 

time?

 Oh! She?s fantastic. I have been a fan of hers ever since I saw Refugee. She is one of the best actresses we have here today. She is one of those who has got acting in her blood. It comes so naturally to her. It?s not only a treat to watch, it?s a treat for any leading man to act with her.

 Her forte?s comedy, too?

 She did some comedy, a bit over the top, in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. But here in Hulchul she is absolutely fantastic. 

 So the pair is something to watch out for?

 I believe we share a great on-screen chemistry. And that?s because we have a great off-screen rapport. When you enjoy working with somebody, it shows on screen. If you don?t, that too shows on screen.

 You have dabbled in negative roles, comedy, and 

also played the conventional hero. Are you not concerned about your image?

 The only image I hope to achieve is of someone who gets good jobs and does them well. As an actor, it is just my job to entertain the audience and that?s what I want to do. Image building cannot be a consideration. 

 You feel that Dil Chahta Hai brought you 

back in the groove?

 Yes, the film did have a very positive effect on my career. But don?t ask me why it did well. Only the audiences can answer that. I can?t dissect films or performances and especially not my own.

 Your film with Amitabh Bachchan, Deewaar, 

bombed badly. Any regrets in doing the film?

 It had great potential at the script level. But the audience didn?t like it at all. When I saw the trial show, I thought it was an ?ok? film. Sometimes, some films don?t work. Sometimes, they do. It?s difficult to know beforehand. But no regrets?

 Any other film you are doing?

 Nothing at the moment. I am always reading scripts. A couple of projects should work out which will be announced in the near future.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Fashion focus for Fridays 

Denims and bright hues take over ties and 

greys at the workplace when the weekend beckons, says Ipsita Deb 

After bouts of the blues, blacks and greys through 

the working week, it is finally time to add some colour to your life with the 

approach of the weekend. After a long stressful week (when was the last time you 

managed to stick to your nine-to-five working schedule?), Friday for some, Saturday 

for others is the light at the end of the tunnel of drudgery. And clothes are, 

after all, a reflection of spirit.

?My office is like a fish market. People screaming 

and shouting with no sense of place or proportion. The stress factor, which is 

always on the upward curve, starts dropping only on Fridays, which is everybody?s 

pay day,? explains fashion designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh. 

?While I wear more formal trousers and shirts during 

the week, on Fridays I don colourful cut-offs and a bright blouse, casual and 

yet not as casual as Saturday. I even change my accessories to suit the Friday 

culture. I insist on taking out this mock crocodile handbag and different shoes. 

Even my husband tends to wear a brighter shirt or tie to work on Fridays.?

The idea of Friday dressing was born mainly due to 

two factors: to bring the excitement of the weekend to the workplace and to make 

life a little easier for those ready to hit the town after office hours. ?Sometimes 

there just isn?t time to go home and change after work, before going out for dinner. 

Wearing something that looks chic, trendy and colourful as opposed to the usual 

uniforms of the week is just what you need and Friday?s the only day such things 

are actually possible,? adds Kiran.

That?s IT

Firms like PriceWaterhouseCoopers have no such concept 

of dressing down, even over the weekend. ?We wear business casuals the whole week 

through, with the exception of when we go to our practice offices. At such time, 

business formals have to be worn,? says Joydeep DattaGupta, partner, PWC. 

Business casuals for men usually implies a shirt and 

trousers, while formals means a suit. In companies like NIIT, however, employees 

do have a policy of wearing casuals over the weekend.

Talking trendy

Those who work with cell phone service providers tend 

to be in casuals most of the time. ?Our organisation is made up of very young 

people, the average age being less than 30 years. So the environment is always 

lively and colourful. Our employees can come to work wearing jeans,? says Deepak 

Gulati, CEO, eastern region, Bharti Cellular Ltd. 

?Despite the competitive edge of the industry and 

the pace of our activities, we try to do extra-curricular activities within office 

to keep our employees engaged and constantly rejuvenated. We encourage special 

dressing themes on Fridays for our call centre executives,? he explains.

Ad colour

Fun, creative, risk-taker is the usual image of an 

ad executive. Advertising agencies have always been distinguished by their casual 

work ethos. Dressing down and funky fits right in with their flexi-hours and the 

less-rules-more-deadlines mode. As Tapan Sen, director, client servicing, JWT, 

points out: ?We do expect those going to meet clients to be in formal attire, 

but there is no written code as in many companies. On Saturdays, I sometimes come 

to office in shorts and a T-shirt.? 

The very idea of Friday dressing in India came straight 

out of the Allen Solly advertisement, he feels. ?But surprisingly, if you look 

carefully, practically every ad shows a man rather formally dressed. I can?t see 

anything casual about it.?

Ram Ray, CEO, Response, also dismisses the idea of 

formal garb. ?It doesn?t matter one bit what people in my organisation wear as 

long as they can carry it off. People should be comfortable with themselves and 

the total package. Whether they are meeting clients or not, it should be acceptable.?

BPO basics

In a finance business-process outsourcing (BPO) unit, 

however, the work culture and dressing is more formal. Call centres, on the other 

hand, have no fixed dress code as the business takes place over the phone and 

employees can wear casuals throughout the week. 

While those corporate houses with five-day weeks have 

the Friday dressing ethos, those like ABN-Amro with a six-day working schedule 

have revised the concept for Saturdays.

?It is basically the last day of the working week 

that people are allowed to wear jeans to bring in the feeling of calm and relaxation. 

While on most days we wear trousers and formal shirts or formal Indian wear, on 

Saturdays we wear whatever makes us comfortable (not shabby of course),? says 

Moumita Dattagupta, assistant manager, HR.

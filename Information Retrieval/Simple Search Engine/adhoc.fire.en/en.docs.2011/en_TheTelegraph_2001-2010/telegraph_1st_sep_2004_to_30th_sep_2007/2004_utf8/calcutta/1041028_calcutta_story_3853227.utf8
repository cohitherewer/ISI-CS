A river runs through it

Plan a Party

A cruise adds variety to your social calendar, says 

Zeeshan Jawed

 Do

 Make sure the weather is appropriate before setting out 

 Ensure all safety gear is on board 

 Don?t

 Invite more than 150 guests

 Plan for any alcoholic beverages 

Move over pubs and discos, bungalows and farmhouses, 

cruising over the Ganges is the chill-out mantra of the season. The clear sky 

and gentle breeze is the perfect mix for your autumn-winter bash on the water.

Set sail

Cruise parties are a perfect platform to escape the 

pollution and bustle of the city. They also provide a welcome break from nightclubs. 

?We started letting out cruises for private parties in 1999. However, the trend 

has suddenly caught on and during the peak months, we get up to 40 bookings per 

month,? says Sanjoy Sen, cruise officer, Vivada Inland Waterways Limited, the 

only luxury cruise provider on the Hooghly.

All aboard

The launch can accommodate up to 150 people, with 

the first-floor air-conditioned hall holding over 50. The sky deck accommodates 

another 40. If required, the lower deck can be converted into a dance floor. The 

cruise also has an adjacent kitchen.

Work it out

The party of your dreams might turn out to be a little 

hard on the pocket. The charge for weekday mornings is Rs 2,000 per hour and an 

additional Rs 500 for the evenings. Weekends are another Rs 500 dearer. Food comes 

at between Rs 150 and Rs 225 per vegetarian plate and Rs 250 to Rs 300 per non-vegetarian 

portion. You can arrange for your own food as well, at your expense.

Team time

Party-happy corporates have taken to the floating 

fun concept with gusto. ?Over 90 per cent of our bookings are from business houses,? 

says the cruise officer. Employee get-togethers and dos on special occasions are 

arranged. ?The most memorable party we had was on a launch. The theme was Bengali 

and we stopped at Belur Math and returned late evening,? recalls Deepak Gulati, 

CEO, eastern region, Bharti Cellular.

Buckle up

Before taking to the water, remember that there are 

certain guidelines that have to be followed. The vessel starts from Millennium 

Park and goes up to Belur Math and back. It has to return to the shore before 

midnight. ?We have all infrastructure in place, according to existing regulations, 

to deal with accidents. Life boats, life jackets and fire fighting equipment is 

on board,? assures Sen. Apart from that, the head count of no more than 150 must 

be adhered to. No alcohol is allowed on board.

 A helping hand of women for women

 Amrita Basu (name changed), had passed out of college, worked for about a year, before settling down with the husband her parents chose for her. But Amrita?s in-laws made her life miserable. Suffering from an inferiority complex, Amrita?s self-esteem hit rock-bottom, when her husband finally left her a few months after their baby was born. 

 She had come for help to Women?s Sahayog (WS), a voluntary NGO, which works with gender-sensitisation programmes and provides counselling to victims of domestic violence and abuse. ?Women like Amrita, more than anything else, need to feel positive about themselves and develop self-confidence,? said Sujoyeeta Ghosh, programme director and legal counsellor at WS.

 And it is with this idea that WS has set about launching its new scheme ? a Wellness Programme for personality development, self-esteem and self-enhancement workshops by Nupur Jaiswal. 

 Kusum Jain, president of WS, said: ?Most of the women who come to us are from the middle and upper-middle classes of society. Almost all are educated, some have even held jobs. Their problems are mainly ones regarding their families, husbands and in-laws.

 ?There are some accomplished women also, who maybe haven?t got married and feel bogged down by societal pressure now. In them and others, self-esteem is conspicuous by its absence,? added Jain. ?We will be trying to improve that.? 

 Thus both 56-year-old Sumita Chatterjee (name changed), a victim of extreme abuse by her husband for a long time and Poonam Singh, 23, apprehensive about her future and marriage, have been advised to give the wellness workshop a shot to ease their mental dilemmas.

 Jaiswal explained that the five-day workshop would have interesting sessions that would include various exercises attempting to bring out the participants? fears and apprehensions and give them the necessary psychological boost to tackle them. 

 Sindoor Virick, secretary, WS said: ?It is not our idea to help women break the system that is causing them some trauma. We will help them help themselves within their own systems.?

 Jain added: ?Each person, each family is different. Every participant needs to feel better after the workshop. So the workshop will deal with not more than 30 women, as we need to interact on a one-to-one basis.? 

 If required, participants will be advised for their mental and physical health and well-being to take up the free pranayam classes that are conducted at WS?s Chowringhee office every Thursday afternoon. ?Most women do not take care of their nutrition or health. If need be, we will also advise participants to avail of free medical consultation at our centre every Wednesday afternoon,? said programme director Ghosh.

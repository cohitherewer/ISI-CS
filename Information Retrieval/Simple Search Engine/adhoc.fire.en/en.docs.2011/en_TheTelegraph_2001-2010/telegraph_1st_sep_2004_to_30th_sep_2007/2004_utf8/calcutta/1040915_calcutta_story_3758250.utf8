 Another father?s cry for justice

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Dhananjoy Chatterjee?s execution has prompted a father, whose 10-year-old daughter was killed 17 years ago while trying to save herself from being raped, to cry for justice.

 The accused, Indrajit Sinha, had been convicted by the trial court and sentenced to life imprisonment. But he walked free 14 years ago after obtaining bail from the high court while the appeal was pending.

 Kamal Krishna Mukhopadhyay, an employee of Jessop?s in Dum Dum, has written to Calcutta High Court acting Chief Justice A.N. Roy, demanding a speedy trial.

 Five days ago, a similar plea was made by a paan-and-bidi shopowner from Midnapore, who alleged that the rapist-killer of her 12-year-old girl was at large even after conviction by the trial court. He had obtained bail from the high court 12 years ago.

 Mukhopadhyay recounted in his letter how on December 3, 1987, one of his neighbours, Indrajit Sinha, 20, killed his daughter Moumita, by pushing her off the roof of a two-storeyed building for resisting his advances.

 ?It was a mere accident... We also want a speedy trial,? said P.K. Sinha, Indrajit?s uncle, when contacted late on Tuesday.

 ?I taught him (Indrajit) commerce and mathematics. That day, my wife asked Moumita to hang out the washing to dry on Indrajit?s terrace. There, Indrajit tried to rape her. My daughter resisted and so Indrajit pushed her off the roof,? the father wrote.

 Moumita died in RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, four hours after admission.

 The accused was tried at Alipore court. The post-mortem report revealed that the accused had hit the girl on her forehead before pushing her off the roof. Police recovered his bloodstained clothes.

 ?After taking the versions of 34 witnesses, in 1990, the trial court found Indrajit guilty, and sentenced him to life behind bars,? said Mukhopadhyay?s lawyer Kallol Guha Thakurta.

 Two-and-a-half months later, the convict moved a bail plea along with an appeal challenging the verdict. A division bench presided over by Justice Padma Khastgir granted him bail, keeping his appeal pending. The plea is still pending.

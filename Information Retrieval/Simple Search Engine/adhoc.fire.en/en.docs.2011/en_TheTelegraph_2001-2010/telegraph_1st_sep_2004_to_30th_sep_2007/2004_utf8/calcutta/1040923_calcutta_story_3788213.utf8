The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A wealth of love for the hills

 Meher H. Mehta 

Managing money was his profession. But the call of 

the mountains was too hard to resist for Meher H. Mehta. The current vice-president 

of The Himalayan Club took to climbing when he was 16 and the romance has continued 

ever since for the banker.

 The Himalayan Club is one of the oldest mountaineering clubs in India, founded by the British in 1928. The headquarters were shifted to Calcutta when the British left in 1950. Mehta joined three years later. It?s also one of the only clubs of its kind with an international presence. The club has 14 offices outside India and around 800 members, two-thirds of who are from countries other than India. The Calcutta chapter has nearly 60 members.

 Mehta has served as a secretary, a committee member and as the vice-president of the club. ?Our primary aim now is to get more younger members,? says the septuagenarian. The club is planning to visit schools and introduce the youngsters to the call of the wild.

 The club organises expeditions to mountains, brings out a journal and tries to rope in eminent climbers from time to time, to share their experiences and offer tips to the members. ?The Himalayan Journal, brought out annually by us, stands comparison to some of the best in the world,? feels Mehta.

 As for mountaineering trips, an eight-member team is leaving for Thinchenkanj in western Sikkim on October 25. Recently, Tom Nakamoora, an Alps expert, had come to Calcutta and the session with the veteran left everyone mesmerised. Training members is also an integral activity for the club. ?Our members are regularly sent to courses in various institutes.?

 Surprisingly, Mehta has no mountaineering background. There was no one in his family who took to climbing before him. Now his son has followed in his footsteps and is a keen trekker. ?I was born in Mumbai, grew up in Calcutta and have spent long periods of my life abroad,? says Mehta. ?I just fell in love with the mountains on a trip to Darjeeling. I think things like this just happen.?

 He also admits that he?s no climbing expert, but just a great mountain lover. ?My mother died a million deaths with my early mountain expeditions.? Mehta has extensively covered mountains in Sikkim and the Garhwal Himalayas and also those in North Wales. ?We learnt the hard way since there were no institutes back then.? One of his more memorable incidents was meeting Sir Edmund Hillary.

 A keen sports enthusiast ? he has played first division hockey, cricket and football ? this retired banker now lectures on management subjects in his spare time.

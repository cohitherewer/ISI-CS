The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A playful weekend

 As part of its 25th anniversary celebrations, Nandipat hosts a theatre festival featuring three popular plays (direction: Bibhas Chakraborty), plus an interactive session (on September 20 at Jibanananda Sabhaghar) in which distinguished theatre personalities will share their views on the preferences and expectations of modern theatre audiences. Anya Theatre?s Naakchhabita, the first of the plays being staged, is about an old woman who, having grown up in an environment ridden with selfishness, hypocrisy and opportunism, returns to her ancestral village to wipe away the trauma of her confused and bitter memories. Nandipat?s Mrityu Na Hatya is a cleverly disguised political satire that depicts how, irrespective of time and place, the state machinery and ruling classes always abuse power and repress the freedom of the working classes. The third and final play of the festival, Shwet Santras (a scene from the play appears above), another Nandipat production, conveys with great tragic realism how apostles of peace are persecuted by warmongers throughout history.

 Event: A festival of plays hosted by Nandipat

 When amp; Where: September 18 at Academy of Fine Arts; 3 pm (Naakchhabita), at 6.30 pm (Mrityu Na Hatya); September 19 at Madhusudan Mancha; 6.30 pm (Shwet Santras)

 Gift of sight for Durga

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The Pujas came with special tidings for Durga and her parents. The seven-year-old girl from an indigent Murshidabad family, who had all but lost vision in her left eye due to a tumour, saw the goddess in new light, thanks to a rare surgical procedure at a city hospital.

 Durga had a small tumour in the left eye socket from infancy, which kept growing into an enormous size, leading to proptosis (bulging eyeball). She started losing her vision.

 She was referred to an eye surgeon in Calcutta by an NGO from an eye camp in Murshidabad. The eye surgeon sent Durga to neurosurgeon Asim Roy, who, in turn, consulted Amitabha Chanda, a specialist skull-base neurosurgeon with AMRI Hospitals.

 ?This was an extremely difficult tumour to resect. The child had Type I neurofibromatosis, a very rare tumour, with an incidence of less than one in 200,000,? observed Chanda.

 The details were sent to Germany by Gandhi Kinder Hilfe, the NGO monitoring the child?s treatment. ?We consulted the leading neurosurgeons in Germany and they concurred that it was a very difficult tumour to operate on,? said B.N. Roy, who formed the NGO in Germany, which helps the economically-backward sections in India, particularly in Murshidabad.

 At the behest of the family and Gandhi Kinder Hilfe, the team at AMRI, led by Chanda, went ahead with the procedure. ?Following the MRI scan, debulking surgery to save the child?s vision was planned,? explained Chanda, who was aided in the surgery by Asim Roy and Rajarshi Banerjee.

 The tumour involved almost all the nerves in the orbit and distorted every structure. The cutting time was nine hours and the whole tumour couldn?t be resected. A small part was left, as an attempt to remove that would have killed the child, maintained the AMRI team.

 Durga has now recovered, though she initially had a huge swelling in the left eyelid and the left side of the face due to a massive haematoma.

 ?But the swelling is almost gone now and she can see well in her left eye,? smiled Chanda.

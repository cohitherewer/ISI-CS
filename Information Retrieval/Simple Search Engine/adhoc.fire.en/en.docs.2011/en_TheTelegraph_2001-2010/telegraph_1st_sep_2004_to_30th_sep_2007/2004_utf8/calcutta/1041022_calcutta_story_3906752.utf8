 Redefining relationships

 This play raises pertinent questions relating to the man-woman relationship in modern times and tries to examine its various facets from different perspectives in a humorous way. Priyambada?s (a housewife) husband Kumud Kishore Guha is a shrewd politician who had won two consecutive municipal elections in the past and is gearing up to continue his winning streak for the third time as he goes to the hustling again. However, his hope is dashed this time when he is defeated by a solitary vote by his old nemesis, homeopath lady doctor Shefalika Khastagir, a hardcore feminist who has joined politics to settle an old score with Kumud. Meanwhile, news of a councillor?s death brings happy tidings for Kumud. But since the seat is ?reserved? for women, he orders his wife to file her nomination. He tutors her well, and she wins comfortably. But after the polls, a transformed Priyambada discloses her husband?s wrong-doings publicly. Kumud is stunned. Now he has to deal with two foes: his wife and Shefalika. The battle of the sexes reaches a hilarious peak before Kumuds and Shefalikas children come to their aid and help restore sanity in their respective families.This Bohurupee production is directed by Tarapada Mukhopadhyay.

Paint power to enhance energy

Feng Shui

 Pinky Kapoor

Q: I am an aspiring artist and would love 

to paint pictures that will bring good luck to the buyers. I have heard that paintings 

can have a strong impact on the lives of people whose walls they decorate. Somehow, 

I can?t paint pictures with subjects like waterfalls or couples. Please guide 

me on how I can incorporate Feng Shui principles into my creativity.

Name withheld

The Solution: The paintings displayed in a 

house should capture the essence, spirit and inner feelings of the occupants and 

visitors. They definitely enhance the energy of the home in many different forms.

If you do not like to paint concrete subjects, abstract 

art can also help. For example, splashes of reds, maroons and oranges symbolising 

fire and flames are excellent for the fame and recognition of a family. When it 

is combined with the settling and nourishing earthy tones of yellow and rust, 

it helps significantly enhance passion and love for married couples. Similarly, 

swirling flashes of silver merging with black and different shades of blue in 

soft curves are excellent substitutes for waterfalls.

Q: I was employed with an industrial pipe 

manufacturing company as a senior marketing manager for the past five years. Last 

November, I was transferred to Delhi and this April, to Mumbai. But unfortunately, 

I had to leave the job to return home as my mother was not keeping well. Now, 

despite an intensive job hunt through consultants and responding to newspaper 

ads, I have not been able to find anything. My date of birth is September 8, 1959 

and my animal sign is pig. How can I enhance my career luck?

 The Solution: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a strong water person. So, you need to be balanced with colours like green and warm fire shades. Keeping a motif of the fire element, such as the sun, will be an excellent energiser for your wealth. Keep your important documents in a red folder in the north-east side of your bedroom. Your wealth period starts this year and you can expect a lucrative and stable job pretty soon.

 Abstract paintings with splashes of reds, maroons 

and oranges symbolising fire and flames are good for supporting the fame and recognition 

of a family. When this is combined with earthy tones of yellow and rust, it enhances 

passion and love between married couples

Q: Very soon I will be moving into a flat 

where the bedrooms are quite small. How should we place the beds in each room 

according to Feng Shui principles?

Aparajita Banerjee

The Solution: The best placement for a bed 

is diagonal to the bedroom door. Care should be taken that it does not fall under 

a beam or is not placed within a wall cavity. There should not be any sharp edges 

? like protruding corners of columns or the bedside table ? to hit the person.

Do not place the bed in such a way that your feet 

are directly pointing towards the bedroom door. Preferably, the head should be 

in one of your auspicious directions. But while doing so, don?t end up sleeping 

with your head towards the toilet wall or facing the toilet door. The bathroom 

door should not be in line with the bed.

Q: I am very new to the subject of Feng 

Shui and would like to know how the kua number and its associated directions help 

us in our lives.

Catherine

The Solution: The kua number by itself 

is taken as a personal lucky number and the four auspicious directions revealed 

by it are believed to bring excellent Feng Shui luck. The first one is known as 

Sheng Chi or the success direction. This is extremely beneficial for businessmen 

and professionals. Office tables and chairs should be positioned to enable them 

to benefit from their Sheng Chi direction. It should also be tapped for important 

business meetings, presentations or interviews.

 Next is Tien Yi or health direction. Sleeping with the head in this direction helps auspicious energy flow into the body. Facing it while eating also has a beneficial impact on our health.

 The third is Nien Yen or the marriage direction. Facing your personal marriage direction helps immensely when you go out on a date or meet your future partner. Later, this particular direction needs to be energised with your marriage photographs and stabilised with amethyst rocks and sparkling crystals. Lastly, facing the Fu Wei or personal development direction is valuable for students or people in creative fields.

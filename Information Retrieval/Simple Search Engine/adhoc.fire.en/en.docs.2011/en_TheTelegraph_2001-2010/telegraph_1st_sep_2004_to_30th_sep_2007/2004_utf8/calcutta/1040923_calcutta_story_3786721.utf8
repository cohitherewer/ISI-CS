The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Handicrafts to go with high life, soccer stars in sip sojourn

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI, ZEESHAN JAWED

The 

three small villages of Kota in Rajasthan and Chanderi and Maheshwar in Madhya 

Pradesh are bound together by a strong thread and literally. Three of India?s 

best-known handlooms have been brought together to form a synergy of sorts ? between 

basic maheshwari, fine chanderi and elaborate kota weaves. 

 An effort by Women Weave, a non profit organisation spearheaded by Sally Holkar, has culminated in a countrywide exhibition of works by women weavers from the three villages of India.

drink, Zim Zam, at The Park

Following their experience with women weavers in Maheshwar, 

the organisation in association with UNIDO took over the other two villages to 

help the weavers come up with products that would appeal to urban customers. 

 While Delhi witnessed the fine handwork earlier this month, Calcutta emerged the second destination for exhibiting the delicate yards. A special preview of the fabrics at Taj Bengal on September 21 is being followed by a two-day exhibition starting September 23 at Weavers Studio. 

 Titled Teen Kila Collection, the effort is essentially to club the best of the styles, designs and weaves. Thus, a plain kota dupatta now comes with the dazzle of chanderi buti work and a dull cotton maheshwari sari gets a soft silk base to match its counterpart from Chanderi.

 The exhibits are priced at Rs 500 for a dupatta and go up to a few thousands for six yards of magic. 

 From classic whites, subtle pastel shades right on to bright happy hues, there is something for everyone.

 Earthy appeal

 If you thought coffee tastes best in china, try terracotta for sip size. Caffeine, the coffee shop on Elgin Road, is the unlikely venue for a Bengal handicrafts exhibition by NGO Nimble Fingers. 

 Featuring essentially terracotta and handmade products, the exhibition honours veteran terracotta artist Nabendu Sengupta from Naihati. On display are a variety of pots, planters, wall plates and Ganeshas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Muted messaging

 The art of mimesis has come a long way since the time when it was first performed in ancient Greece. Based on stories by classical masters, actors played out silent, animated yet powerful performances depicting topical issues, often emphasising their didactic element. Produced by Howrah Kalamanjari, this evening?s mime show by Suman Mukherjee and his troupe is a take-off on the classical style of mimesis, treating a number of current themes of serious, social interest. While Modern Valentine and The Great Thief comment upon the dishonesty, hypocrisy, corruption and self-seeking that are characteristic of our times, The Drunken Fools cautions us against the dangers of addiction. A note of wistful romanticism is struck in presentations such as Imagination and My Dream, where the audience will empathise with the artist?s yearning for a world in which peace and happiness reign. Its My Style and Kolkata Metro Rail are tragi-comic reflections on the rapidly changing trends and lifestyles of the urban populace.

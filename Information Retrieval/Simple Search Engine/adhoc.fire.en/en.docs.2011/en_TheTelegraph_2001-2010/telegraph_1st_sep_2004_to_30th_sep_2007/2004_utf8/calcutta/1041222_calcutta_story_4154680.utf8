The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Rahul Saraf

 Managing director, Forum

 Of the three bandhs in recent times, we kept our store open on two. On the Trinamul Congress-sponsored one, we were shut through the morning and opened at 4 pm. The deciding factor largely is whether transport is available. Deduction of salary for absence on a bandh day is the administrative decision of individual companies. But I cannot penalise my staff for failing to turn up if there are no buses and cabs on the streets. This time we tried to take a stand against the series of bandhs. A circular was issued to make it clear from the management that we would try to come to work. I am happy to say that attendance was 98-99 per cent on both days. The odd couple who didn?t turn up were let off with a warning. I am not against bandhs, but as a tool of protest it should be used with caution. Of late, people had started taking it as a paid holiday. We did good business on the bandh evenings. It showed that given a choice, people want to come out.

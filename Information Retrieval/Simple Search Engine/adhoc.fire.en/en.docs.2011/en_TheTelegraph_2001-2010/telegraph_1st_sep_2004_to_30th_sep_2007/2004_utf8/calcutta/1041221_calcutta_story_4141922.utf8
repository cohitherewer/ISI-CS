 Private hand in 12-crore CIT project

 BARUN GHOSH

 The funds-starved Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), for the first time since its inception in 1911, has entered into a joint venture with a private company for construction of a housing project on a CIT-owned 29-cottah plot on Deshapran Sashmal Road. 

 ?It took us two long years to work out the project,? K.S. Rajendra Kumar, principal secretary, urban development, said on Monday. A new company, CIT-and-SPS Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, has been formed to execute the project. 

 An eight-member board of directors, four each from the CIT and the private construction company, will meet this week to finalise the Rs 12-crore project, which will start by January 2005. The highrise will have 100 flats.

 Dulal Banerjee, officer on special duty, said a memorandum of understanding had been signed, on the basis of which the CIT will provide land and the company financial backing. 

 ?If this project works out, we can undertake several other joint-venture housing projects. We have prime land in and around the city but are unable to construct housing projects owing to a paucity of funds. Financial backing from private parties will really be a boon for us,? he observed.

 Officials said a large share of the CIT?s annual revenue, amounting to Rs 22 crore, is spent paying the salaries of its 1,200-odd staff. ?We are not getting any subsidy from the state government. So, a joint venture with private companies will not only help us survive but expand the scope of our activities too,? said Dipak Paul, CIT chief valuer.

 The CIT on its own has undertaken a number of projects by utilising its limited resources. ?We have started a Rs 12-crore project to widen the approach road connecting Dhakuria station with Gariahat Road to 44 ft. The renovated road will be ready by early 2005,? Paul said.

 The CIT worked out the project following complaints from commuters about regular traffic snarls on the Dhakuria Station Road approach. It entails demolition of over 60 shops and 18 small dwelling units. 

 A five-storeyed rehabilitation home will come up opposite the approach road to accommodate some those evicted. Another four-storey building will come up in 2006 to rehabilitate the rest of the shops and dwelling units.

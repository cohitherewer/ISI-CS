 Time for some fashionable fun when it comes to furniture as well. 

 Long gone are the days when the carpenters? market on BB Ganguly Street was the destination to do up the interiors. With the fast-changing lifestyle equation, the taste of the consumer is changing from common to classy. Increasing businesses of big market players like Gorsia and Gautier clear any doubts whatsoever.

 Brainchild of Farhan Furniturewalla, the new showroom at 6 Hungerford Street named Furniturewalla is the latest entrant into the market of furniture. The brand has its presence in seven other cities in the country. 

 The 9,000-sq feet store in town, situated bang opposite Birla High School, boasts an admirable collection of contemporary yet classy styles manufactured in India as well as imported from Spain, Egypt, China and Philippines.

 Humble sofas are pass? and modest dining tables are a things of the past here. Get yourself a recliner (sofas based on the lazy boy design) which costs Rs 35,500 and the extending dining table (which can be extended from six to eight chairs) that will leave you poorer by Rs 48,000. The various bedroom sets range between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 2 lakh.

 ?Our products are very popular with the upper middle classes onwards because of the quality and designs we offer,? claims Farhan Ebrahim Furniturewalla, owner of the brand.

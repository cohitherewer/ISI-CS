The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Off to festival of flavours

 - From Digha, via Calcutta, to Milan, a true taste of Bengal

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 Chef Based: Kitchen king

 He comes from Ashwasthapur, a village near Digha. In a few days, he is heading for Milan, armed with garam masala and his chef?s hat.

 If the Italian city is getting a whiff of India this month, a bit of Bengal panch phoron will also tantalise its palate. Chef Sheikh Abdul Based is the man from Oberoi Grand who has been entrusted with representing the culinary tradition of the region at Asia Week.

 Rohu Machh Bhaja, Chingri Malai Curry, Doi Machh, Begun Bhaja, Phool Kopir Dalna and Suji ka Halwa are a few of the Bengali dishes that Based will be dishing out during a week-long Asian food festival at the Hotel Principe di Savoia.

 Cooking in Italy presents its own set of challenges. ?We will go to the market and see what kind of fish is available, to find one that will suit our cooking,? explains Based, who will be leaving a couple of days ahead of the September 24 opening gala dinner. Chef Gautam Chaudhry from The Oberoi New Delhi is the only other chef making the trip. Together, they will provide the Indian flavour for the festival, on till October 3.

 The 54-year-old Based has been abroad for workshops in Paris and Thailand, where he trained chefs in Indian food. In Italy, too, the kitchen is unskilled, this being the first exposure to the cuisine. ?We had to choose dishes that would not take too many people to make,? explains the chef. ?So, we couldn?t keep something like rosogollas on the menu, because they need a lot of expert hands.?

 Food from across the country will be on show, though the accent is predictably on kebabs and North Indian cuisine. The menu was set after ?constant correspondence? with the host hotel.

 The Oberoi will be represented in Milan at the spa week as well. ?We see this as a tremendous business opportunity,? feels Amitabh Rai, general manager, Oberoi Grand. ?With the cooperation between Italy and West Bengal, there are a lot of people from the gems, jewellery and tea industries coming to town,? says Rai.

 Old man and suicide note

 - ?Tormentors? in turmoil

 PRONAB MONDAL

 An old man?s threat to commit suicide, yet to be executed, is causing his daughter and son-in-law to spend sleepless nights, because he has named them as being responsible for his decision.

 The couple is now desperately trying to get the man cancel the ?suicide note?. Kanailal Bhawal and wife Seema have even sought help from the police. But what the officers said was half-assurance and half-caution: ?It?s fine so long your father is alive or if he dies a natural death. But if he really kills himself, you?re in trouble.?

 Suryapada Sadhu, in his mid-80s, had left his Hridaypur residence, in Barasat, late in September, leaving behind the single-page ?suicide note?. The note, which begins with the names of his three daughters, reads: ?Ami shechhay tomader bari chhere chole jachhi chirotore. Aamar mukh tomra aar keu konodin dekhte pabe na. Amaar shechha mrityur jonyo pradhanato amaar mejo jamai Kanailal Bhawal ebong taar sahojogi hisabe amaar mejo meye Seema dayee thakbe? (I am leaving home for ever. You will never see me again. My second daughter Seema and her husband, Kanailal Bhawal, are responsible for my decision to commit suicide?)?

 Before signing off, Sadhu had written: ?Amaar jontronar jonye jara dayee, tara er theke hajar gun jontrona pabe, ei ashirbad rekhe gelam (I wish that those who have tormented me will go through much greater torment in life).?

 Sadhu, owner of a printing press, made a number of copies of the note and distributed them among relatives and family members, including Kanai and Seema. He was, however, tracked down at his press and brought back by his relatives on Sunday.

 ?We were puzzled by the note, because we did not deserve this kind of treatment from someone who is dear to us and looked after well? We don?t know what will happen to us if he kills himself,? said a terrified Kanai. 

 Towards the end of the note, Sadhu had mentioned a timespan, ?27.09.04 to 3.10.04?, for committing suicide. ?Accordingly, Sunday was the last day. We have no idea whether the note is effective now or not,? Kanai added.

 Sensing trouble, he had also written to superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Praveen Kumar, seeking his intervention. ?I will ask my officers to look into the case. If necessary, we will speak to Sadhu,? Kumar told Metro.

 Kanai had also consulted a lawyer, Nimai Ray, who opined: ?Attempt to suicide is an offence and police can book a person under Section 309 of the IPC. If Sadhu is found guilty, he will have to face an year?s simple imprisonment or a fine or both.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Although Calcutta?s soccer giants, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, spend huge 

amounts in training their teams, they care little for the club grounds, which 

are in a disastrous condition. Neither is the grass trimmed, nor are the uneven 

surfaces taken care of. However skillful the players be, they cannot produce the 

best results on such unkempt grounds. 

 Debaprasad Mukherjee, Nayapatty Road. 

 I boarded a state bus on route 14 C from Karunamoyee crossing in Salt Lake 

and asked the conductor for a ticket till the Boisakhi crossing. He charged me 

Rs 4 even though the distance is not more than two km. Even private buses charge 

only Rs 3 for the distance. The conductor pleaded helplessness and cited that 

the ?stage? changes after Boisakhi and, hence, the fare increases from Rs 3 to 

Rs 4. The distance is the same whether it is a private bus route or state bus 

route, then why the difference? On what basis does the government fix these stages 

for fares? 

 Madhabi D. Ghosh, Salt Lake. 

 Bongaon railway station is in bad shape and needs thorough overhauling. Given 

the passenger load, the number of ticket counters here should be increased. At 

present, only one counter caters to the passengers.

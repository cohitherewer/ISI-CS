 Licence fee lash for trade

 - Inflated area rates drive city shopkeepers to redress queue 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 More than 300,000 licensed traders in the city feel that the new policy of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), charging trade licence renewal fees according to the size of the shops has cost them dear. 

 They point out that they had to waste time during the peak festive season to get their incorrect bills rectified. 

 A long queue of traders in front of the licence counter at the civic body headquarters is now a familiar sight. Over 95 per cent of the total complaints pertain to inaccurate estimates of shop area in the bills.

 ?Most of the rent bills submitted by traders are fake. No sensible organisation responsible for providing public utility services can calculate its revenue on the basis of such bills. So, I decided to collect service charges from traders on the basis of the floor areas of their shops,? mayor Subrata Mukherjee said on Sunday.

 Admitting that traders have been inconvenienced due to faulty billing, Mukherjee said: ?It is a temporary problem. Traders will benefit once the floor-area database of the shops and establishments is ready. Less tax but a wider net is the main objective of the new trade licence policy.? 

 The last date for renewal of trade licences is November 31. General secretary of the Federation of Traders Organisation (FTO) Taraknath Trivedi has demanded a two-month extension of the renewal date.

 Chief municipal auditor Tapas Guhathakurta, who is in charge of trade licences, said: ?I admit that there were errors in the bills, but no trader can accuse us of charging him more than last year.?

 According to Guhathakurta, of the 282,000 bills sent to the traders, errors have been reported in only 20,000. 

 Mohammad Yusuf, a shop-owner in Metiabruz, said: ?I am losing out on plenty of business by having to come here to get my bill rectified. The sizes of my shop and go-down have been inflated by about 10 times in the bill.?

 Bholanath Ghosh, who runs a sweet shop in Behala, complained that the floor area of his shop had been shown much more than what it actually is. He pointed out that in the absence of actual data, the bill amount had been calculated by converting the recorded rent amount into sq ft, according to a chart.

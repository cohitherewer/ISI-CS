The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Aftab and Shriya: 

 Pitt stop

 From the Farex baby to a sex-crazed husband, Aftab Shivdasani has indeed grown up on screen. He has gone Mast, done his share of Masti and is now poised to make a divine intervention. His latest film Shukriya (running at Jyoti) sees Aftab playing a god, who comes down to earth to check out how a human life works and falls in love with a girl, played by Shriya Saran.

 ?It?s a very emotional film targeted at the family audience. I play this guy who knows he?s gonna die in four days. Through Shukriya, we are trying to project the fact that death is not something to be scared of and is ultimately an inevitability in everyone?s life,?Aftab told Metro.

 And if you still haven?t figured out what?s happening and why, Shukriya does bear an uncanny resemblance with the Hollywood hit Meet Joe Black, where Brad Pitt played the title role of god, who descends for just a few days.

 ?Yes, there are some parts in our film which are similar to Joe Black. But it does have its share of Indian values as well,? says Aftab. But does that make him Bollywood?s Brad Pitt? ?I don?t know about that. That?s for others to figure out,? laughs off the actor.

 Aftab?s last release, Indra Kumar?s Masti is one of the biggest hits of the year and critics have unanimously hailed the actor as the best thing about the film. ?Comedy is one thing which the public has appreciated in me a lot. But then again I do not want to limit myself to just comedy. I would like to explore other grounds. It?s difficult for an actor to stay stuck in one particular genre.?

 But comedy is still on top if you check out Aftab?s kitty. ?There?s Jaane Hoga Kya being directed by a new film-making duo Glenn and Ankush and I am really looking forward to it. There?s Bipasha and Preeti Jhangiani in it with me. Then I have Dost where Sanjay Dutt plays god and I play an atheist. Rimii Sen is paired with me in the film. And finally there?s Ektaa Kapoor?s Koi Aapsa opposite Natasha, which is an out-and-out love story.?

 The child star-turned-hero is disappointed that his recent releases haven?t brought him to Calcutta. ?I just love the city and would love to come if and when the opportunity comes.?

 She is called the dandiya queen, so no wonder she produces her vocal best during Navaratri. In this festive season, Star Utsav has set to tune an evening of Falguni Pathak. Even as Dashami brings the curtains down on Durga puja, Pathak keeps the spirit high with her Dil jhoom jhoom nache re numbers. The air heavy with the beat of dandiya ras, Navratri would reach a crescendo to bring an end to the fast. The evening will be anchored by Shaina and Kunal of Kahiin Kissi Roz. The date with the dandiya diva is at 9 pm on Saturday, October 23.

 Paris Hilton: Back to basics

 You have heard only naughty things about her. And some of you who are fortunate enough (or unfortunate, as the case may be) have even seen the much-hyped, much-forwarded sex video of Paris Hilton online. But now you will get to see a different her as she appears on the FOX TV reality show Simple Life, to go on air soon on Star World.

 The show follows Hilton and best friend Nicole Richie as they are forced to leave their palatial residences and engage in manual labour. Armed with a road map and their trendy dogs Tinkerbell and Honey Child, the girls leave behind their extravagant lifestyles as they embark on their version of a Thelma and Louise adventure. 

 Bidding goodbye to private parties and saying hello to public restrooms, Hilton and Richie have also been stripped off their cell phones, cash and credit cards. From making sausages for the locals to trapping hot guys, Simple Life is not that simple for the ladies who are used to the lap of luxury.

 And if you thought Hilton would not go the whole hog, just catch her shovel cow dung.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Memories and the man

 There?s a faraway look in Shashi Kapoor?s light grey eyes, as he settles down for a chat under the leafy bower at Fairlawn Hotel on Saturday morning. ?I sit here and I go back 50 years,? he muses. 

 The Sudder Street address has managed to do that every time ? hurtling him back to those memorable moments spent with wife Jennifer and their children, stage shows at New Empire, the house in Hazra where he was born, his association with Satyajit Ray and the city?s theatre veterans.

 ?I met Jennifer in Calcutta. So, this city is very important for me? I plan to visit the house where I was born. It?s in Hazra, near Kalighat,? says Kapoor, in town to promote The Prithviwallahs, his book chronicling 25 years of Prithvi Theatre, the seat of stage in Mumbai, and also Prithvi Theatres, the company founded by his father Prithviraj Kapoor.

 Catching up with Calcutta after around 10 years or so ? he was here last in 1993-1994 to attend a screening of Merchant Ivory?s Muhafiz at the film festival ? Kapoor is clearly in flashback mood. On top of the agenda, the day he landed, was a call to that famous building on Bishop Lefroy Road where he often used to drop in. 

 ?I met Bijoyadi, Sandip, his wife and their son. It was so nostalgic. I had tea and sandesh, terrific ones, soft and less sweet,? says he, reliving his association with the Rays (picture above by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya).

 ?I first met Manikda in 1982 when Ismail Merchant and James Ivory were making Ruth Prawar Jhabvala?s The Householder with me and Leela Naidu in the lead. James had approached Manikda to supervise the editing at the final stage and he agreed. Later, I did a TV serial on Feluda for Sandip. Manikda had written the script.?

 Writing The Prithviwallahs dug up a treasure trove of memories. ?I surprised myself by remembering things that my parents had told me when I was barely five or six. I was one when my parents shifted to Bombay. My father was with New Theatres here before joining J. Grant Anderson?s theatre company. Or that the first car my father bought was an Opel. It?s very uncanny, but the first car I bought is also an Opel. Maybe I am living his life...,? he trails off, again.

 ?The theatre people I knew in Calcutta have all died? Shambhuda, Utpalda, Triptidi? Her daughter Shaoli comes to Prithvi Theatre sometimes.?

 But Friday had several surprises in store for the 66-year-old actor. ?I came to know that Sati Devi, who used to act in Prithvi Theatres in around 1944, was Bijoyadi?s sister. She was an established actress and her daughter Ruma (Guha Thakurta) had also started her career at Prithvi. It was there that she met Kishore (Kumar). I hope I meet Ruma this time,? he says, looking forward to the rest of his stay in town, till the 21st.

A platinum punch

 Of the various things that Soha Ali Khan did on her visit to Calcutta this time, distributing awards at an event to honour achievers was also on the agenda.

 And the peppy young actress seemed more than happy to shower the winners with generous lines of congratulations and pose with them for one picture after the other.

 The event, organised by the Platinum Guild of India (PGI) Pvt Ltd, was an effort to award excellence in the platinum retail business in eastern India.

 ?Calcutta is coming up very well as a market for platinum buyers and the effort on the part of the retailers to promote the metal is fantastic,? said Vaishali Banerjee, manager, PGI.

 Indeed, if trade sources are to be believed, platinum is doing as well as a metal in its nascent stages of being marketed ought to do. ?The conversion rates are very high, meaning that many of those who come intending to buy a platinum piece actually end up buying it,? suggested Nilanjan Sen of BC Sen Jewellers, the Lee Road store of this chain that has bagged the award for the Best Store Experience in the Calcutta region.

 They were judged on the basis of sale, display of jewellery and store experience by a market research organisation hired by PGI.

 ?In fact, the growth rate for platinum is expected to be more than gold and silver in the near future,? shares Sen. The metal is doing so well in Calcutta that PGI has used customer feedback from here to create its latest line of jewellery titled Dew Drops.

 ?The price point of this collection begins at Rs 3,000 and most of the pieces are minimalist and classy,? explains Banerjee.

 While Calcutta has got on to a good start, it still has a long way to go with stores in Chennai and Banglore bagging the top awards at the national level. ?We, however, believe the Calcutta market holds promise and will be a small but stable market on which PGI will be able to bank,? feels Banerjee.

The Gariahat branch of MP Jewellers bagged the prize for the second best store in the city. While the star stores walked away with the honours, star sales people across the city displaying exemplary skills in customer relations were also feted.

All in the family: Sanjana?s guest appearance

This doe-eyed beauty caught her father by surprise 

on Friday evening, tiptoeing into Fairlawn Hotel to catch up with his trip down 

memory lane. ?Sanjana said she wanted to surprise me,? laughed Shashi Kapoor, 

amused by his daughter?s whim. But a busy schedule found Sanjana taking an evening 

flight back home on Saturday. ?I did drop in at the Nandikar festival yesterday 

though, to say Hi to Rudrada and others,? smiled the woman behind Prithvi 

Theatre.

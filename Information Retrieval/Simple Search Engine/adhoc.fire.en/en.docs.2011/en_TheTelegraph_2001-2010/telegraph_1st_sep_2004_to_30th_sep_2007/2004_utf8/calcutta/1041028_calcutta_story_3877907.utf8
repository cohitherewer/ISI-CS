Care for crowning glory

Ship Shape

Ipsita Deb does a round of city 

salons to find out how best to pamper tired, limp and distressed tresses

Some days your hair looks great from the moment you 

jump out of bed, while on others, a can of mousse couldn?t salvage it. A bad hair 

day has become such a dreaded force that it is now a commonly-used euphemism for 

those times when just about everything goes wrong.

But don?t feel hopeless. There are steps you can take 

to ensure your crowning glory is gleaming like a dream more often than not. You 

might not be able to combat heredity, but you can enhance what you are stuck with.

Treatments like colouring and perming ? aside from 

pollution and poor dietary habits ? take a toll on hair health. So, it is advisable 

to have a haircare regimen to pamper those lustrous strands. What you can?t do 

yourself at home, with hair products advertised by poster girls for perfect locks 

such as Diana Hayden (above) and Preity Zinta (right, below), you can try to get 

at the nearest salon.

?With Calcutta?s climate, eating and drinking habits 

and the chemicals applied, people must take more care to maintain the hair?s pH 

balance,? says Raman Bharadwaj of the Park Street salon.

To provide energy for distressed hair, A.. John, along 

with ?Oreal, has come out with a power-dose treatment that contains ceramides, 

vitamins, amino acids and proteins to restructure and repair the hair fibre and 

give it extra sheen. Another treatment, known as hair spa, focuses on cleansing, 

relaxing and stimulating the scalp while nourishing and conditioning the hair. 

The price for both treatments starts at Rs 400, and goes up depending on the length 

of hair.

This salon is a firm believer in the fact that hair 

is the main feature of a woman?s beauty. The hair-spa package offered here is 

a deep-conditioning treatment to prevent hair fall, eliminate dandruff and add 

volume. This also comes in the form of a hot-oil massage and steam bath. A special 

mud pack, using Mineral products, is a conditioning mask that gives bounce and 

sheen to dull or listless hair.

June Tomkyns herself has made a special hair tonic 

which is useful for cleansing and conditioning the scalp. For those with coloured 

hair, this parlour has a special protein treatment that helps retain the colour 

while diminishing the harsh effects of the dye. The prices here start at Rs 350.

Mapuii

This new ?hair and beauty studio? opened on Chakraberia 

Road is the first hair salon in the city in association with Wella. ?Healthy hair 

grows out of a healthy scalp,? says manager Darshini Sanghvi. As far as treatments 

go, it has divided it into five sections. The Nurture treatment uses glycerine 

and glucose to nourish dry and sensitised hair, while the Purify treatment, using 

piroctonolamin, prevents dandruff. The Refresh treatment is a curl-saver that 

rebonds the hair, while the Vitalise treatment adds depth to fine hair. Finally, 

the Rejuvenate treatment, using biolin and lauric acid, prevents hair loss. With 

each treatment, the client is given two massages: the shampoo massage and the 

relaxation massage, each with their own therapeutic properties. Prices are between 

Rs 450 and Rs 600, depending on length.

Sunflower

Sunflower believes in going nature?s way. It has an 

oil massage, with ingredients like eggs, honey and curd, which helps do away with 

dryness. ?A perfect grandmother?s recipe? is how stylist Sabina Yah describes 

it. There is also a treatment using only egg yolk, adding protein and nourishment 

to the strands. A dual spa treatment, comprising a nourishing cream bath or a 

hair vitalising cream, serves the purpose for dry or fine hair. Finally, the salon 

also has a power-dose treatment for coloured hair to bring the moisture back to 

the roots. The price for the special treatments here starts at Rs 250.

Sudha?s

According to beauty therapist Sudha Bibra, ?consultation 

before treating the hair is essential?. The client?s lifestyle, food and exercise 

habits have to be taken into account. The three treatments cater to dandruff, 

hair fall and limpness. These include three-month herbal and ozone treatments 

to improve the texture of the hair. ?With almost everybody colouring their hair, 

I have also made hair packs and oils to improve the quality of the hair,? she 

adds. A deep conditioning turban therapy is essential to add life. The time period 

for leaving in the oil varies from person to person. Sessions come at Rs 300 each.

 Goon shot in gang rivalry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 32-year-old criminal, Sujit Sarkar, was hacked and shot dead in Narkeldanga early on Monday. 

 Local residents found the body lying in Moida Gali, blood oozing out from the wounds. 

 No one has been arrested for the murder, though police have identified two of the assailants as Manoj and Nata. 

 Preliminary investigation revealed that Sujit, who was a resident of Barasat, had served a conviction for dacoity and was released two years ago. After his release, he had set up an extortion racket.

 ?The killing seems to be a sequel to gang rivalry,? said Sanjay Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.

 A sleuth working on the case said: ?The murder was pre-planned and the assailants came well prepared. They were armed with both firearms and sharp weapons. They brutally hacked Sujit and then shot him in the head to ensure his death.? 

 After examining the body thoroughly, police said Sujit had scuffled with the killers. ?There were a number of scratch marks on the body, indicating he had fought till the last moment. The cut marks indicate the killers had used bhojalis. The bullet wounds suggest the killers had used either a pipegun or a country-made single-shot gun,? said an officer. 

 According to police, Sujit was involved in extortion in the northern part of the city. ?He forcibly collected money from businessmen in the Maniktala and Shyambazar areas. There are a few complaints against him. But most of his victims preferred to remain silent, fearing a backlash,? said an officer of Narkeldanga police station.

 According to police, Sujit had set up the extortion racket following the arrests of a host of gangsters active in north Calcutta. ?He then developed links with criminals of various localities,? said an officer. ?We are probing whether he had any links with Gopal Tiwari, who heads a widespread network in north Calcutta.? 

 Police are also collecting information about Sujit?s enemy camp. ?According to our information, he had developed rivalries with other gangsters, whose names cannot be disclosed for the sake of investigation. We are also verifying whether anyone from his own gang had masterminded the killing,? said an officer.

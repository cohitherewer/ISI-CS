 Lacquer lap in golden glow

Ipsita Deb, Himika Chaudhuri

Prior 

to marriage, Vietnamese couples hold a Hoi ceremony, in which the groom?s 

family presents the bride?s family with round red lacquered boxes that are filled 

with tea, betel nuts and traditional cakes. Just as the gifts are symbolic, so 

are the boxes, which are covered in shiny red lacquer, representing good luck 

and joy.

 If you want to enhance your chances of acquiring an exotic partner, check out the Vietnamese bamboo products exhibition on at Fabindia at Hindustan Park. Uniform strips of bamboo stuck together with glue or lacquer and moulded in varied shapes and sizes cut a quaint picture in striking colours of red, gold and black.

 ?A rather painstaking process, the non-toxic lacquer used in making these items is ideal for serving food. And the rich colour tone makes them ideal for festive gifts,? says manager Pallabi Basu. 

 The texture of the products using 11-13 layers of lacquer are smoothened by sandpaper. Lacquer is a tree sap, which is flexible and resistant to water, heat and insect damage. There are several square-shaped, pressed bamboo vases that are not waterproof though, and hence ideal for dry flower arrangements.

 Each of the intricate products are hand-made with a wooden, bamboo or composite base. Fruits and eggshells have been used as colourants as well as for detailing. Mother of pearls, silver or gold is used to stunning effect too. 

 An array of nut bowls, metallic coasters, photo albums, plates, bowls, trays, decorative objects, vases and pots are on display at the exhibition. Priced between Rs 200 and Rs 1,900, the products will be available as long as stocks last.

 Hair and now

 He?s arguably the best thing that happened to hair styling in India. For when Jawed Habib took to clipping people?s hair to make them look good way back in 1988, the task of a professional hair-stylist was not considered too much better than that of the barber next door. Yet, after 16 years in which the hair man has amassed fame and fortune, Habib still prefers to call himself the people?s hair-dresser.

 ?I don?t do too many high-flying names; I enjoy working with people who come to me wanting to look good,? said Habib, sitting in his newest salon in Calcutta, the fourth in the city.

 ?Calcutta has moved a long way since we set up our first franchisee outlet on Wood Street in 1994. Now people think of spending money on themselves to look good, and not just on books, education and music lessons,? quipped the man who feels the city is doing pretty well as far as moving up the ?image ladder? is concerned.

 Habib?s tips on international trends are a huge relief for women with no time to pamper themselves: ?The unkempt look is in, the set look is out ? a casual look with a jhola and natural hair is in right now.?

 To kick-start his Short Street outlet, Habib did a makeover session, experimenting with some colours. ?I think shades of khaki, copper and gold look good on the Indian complexion which is wheatish. Unless the skin is very fair, red is best avoided as hair colour,? he suggested.

 With the fourth store in place, plans are on for two more in the near future. 

 Happening tips from Habib:

 nFor Him: Short hair is in right now. The unkempt look will be the style to sport for a while. You can experiment with colours, too. Trying two shades to give the impression of movement in the hair is likely to look good on most.

 nFor Her: Shoulder-length hair is what you ought to have. The casual look is the passport to the league of ?in? women. Colouring is a rage ? Mumbai and Delhi are more experimental with colours, Calcutta still likes to take the conventional route of browns and golden.

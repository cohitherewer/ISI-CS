The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fifty-two weeks of female power

Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee 

 Gone are the days when Hindi film actresses were summoned in the screenplay just for the glam quotient and the treeside naacha-gaana. Well, the year?s biggest hit, Dhoom, did turn the clock back by bringing in the babes just as shapely backdrop, but films like Murder and Julie flaunted the shapely form in the foreground to rake in the moolah. 

 In topsy-turvy tinsel town, where women are used as pivot or prop, Metro looks back at the year?s most dhoom macha le performances?

Rani Mukherjee ? Arguably Bollywood?s heroine no. 1, this diminutive Bengali 

beauty is going from strength to strength. After teaching young lovers how to 

have their morning toast in Saathiya last year, this summer she showed 

women in love how to shed their inhibitions and yet be the cutest thing on two 

legs. 

 In Mani Ratnam?s Yuva, she was the most convincing of the six characters as the battered Bengali wife of Abhishek Bachchan, with a mind of her own. Hum Tum saw Rani treading into Manish Malhotra territory and coming up trumps in her different hairdos over different decades. Yash Chopra?s Veer-Zaara just drove home the point that even in a character cameo, she can be a scene-stealer. And with Black, The Rising and Bunty Aur Babli to come, Rani should rule in 2005 too.

Preity Zinta ? It?s difficult to slip into the Yash Chopra mode overnight. 

To add yourself to a list comprising Sharmila Tagore, Rekha, Rakhee, Sridevi and 

Madhuri Dixit is not the easiest of ordeals. But Preity did that in style. After 

riding 2003 on the wings of Koi? Mil Gaya and Kal Ho Naa Ho, Preity 

added grace, elegance and star power to Zaara Hayat Khan, opposite the sheer charm 

of Shah Rukh Khan?s Veer Pratap Singh. What Veer-Zaara also showcased in 

the later reels was that Preity could be the prettiest grandmom around. When Preity 

wasn?t on the big screen, she was dimpling down on us from giant billboards, pushing 

everything from bikes to chocolates.

Priyanka Chopra ? Like the Miss India crown, she shared her debut film credits 

with Lara Datta in Andaaz and then struggled alongside Preity in the Sunny 

Deol-starrer Hero: The Love Story of a Spy. But 2004 saw the ex-Miss World 

coming into her own. While she had nothing to do in Rajiv Rai?s Asambhav, 

David Dhawan gave her the beach and the blokes in Mujhse Shaadi Karogi. 

With a winner under her belt, Priyanka made Demi Moore proud with a Disclosure 

of her histrionic talent in Abbas Mastan?s Aitraaz. Playing the bad babe 

(and Amrish Puri?s wife in her fifth film!) brilliantly, Priyanka was the best 

thing about the Akki-Bebo movie (only if you turned a deaf year to her diktat: 

?Treat me like an animal!?). 

Mallika Sherawat ? After the 1, 2, 3... 17 kisses in Khwahish, Mallika 

moved on to level two of the dare bare game with the Bhatt production Murder. 

What the unalloyed skin show also meant was that no one really bothered about 

the acting skills of the actress formerly known as Reema Lamba. But to be fair, 

the Anurag Basu film had more to it than what met the voyeur?s eyes. Proof: Mallika?s 

vital statistics failing to lift the fortunes of Kis Kiski Kismat.

Shilpa Shetty ? The very concept of an actress who has been branded as an 

item girl to try and do a Tom Hanks is commendable. And Shilpa did just that. 

Under the sensitive supervision of Revathy, the actress might have failed to win 

the hearts of the UP, Bihar territories this time but she did manage to carve 

a niche for herself in the hearts of critics and cineastes with her stirring portrayal 

of an AIDS patient in Phir Milenge. Wearing a salwar kameez throughout 

the film and a deglamourised look to go with it, Shilpa showed that behind all 

those jhatkas there was a talented actress waiting to be tapped.

Sushmita Sen ? She may do just a couple of films a year but Sushmita knows 

exactly what she is doing. After stunning audiences and critics with her performance 

in Samay in 2003, this year she first decided to return to school and go 

glam and then run scared. With SRK drooling as her student, Sush looked ethereal 

in her flowing saris in Main Hoon Na. If the drop-dead looks kayoed the 

campus in the Farah Khan film, Sush?s scared face in Ram Gopal Varma?s Vaastu 

Shastra made you wonder why Urmila Matondkar was rated so highly in Bhoot!

Kareena Kapoor ? There was a strong feeling around that Bebo will never be 

able to come out of the Poo pout of K3G fame. Whether it was Khushi 

or Chameli, she could never rid herself of the Kareena act. But 2004 saw 

a new her, starting from Yuva, going on to Dev and rounding off 

with Hulchul. A Kareena who could flash an innocent smile, a Kareena who 

could be loved, a Kareena who could make you laugh. And with Dharmesh Darshan?s 

Bewafaa promising to do what Raja Hindustani did for sister Karisma 

Kapoor, Bebo can only get better, kiss or hiss.

 Antara Mali ? Critics blamed her for the no-show of Ram Gopal Varma?s 

Naach but Bollywood hasn?t seen a more nuanced performance this year. Whether 

it was the basic body language or the lithe moves or the subtle display of emotions, 

Antara was on the top of her game. Comparisons with the other Ramu girl Urmila 

and bizarre promotion strategies meant that Antara and her naach remained 

largely unseen and unnecessarily criticised.

Aishwarya rai ? No Michael Douglas, no Meryl Streep, no James Bond. Ash remained 

very much in India and her Western connection this year was restricted to Bride 

 amp; Prejudice and Madame Tussaud?s. While the Gurinder Chadha film used 

the Ash factor to good effect, it helped her remain in the international limelight 

for weeks. The glocal film circuit is abuzz again with Ash doing better with Neeru 

(Raincoat) than Lalita Bakshi.

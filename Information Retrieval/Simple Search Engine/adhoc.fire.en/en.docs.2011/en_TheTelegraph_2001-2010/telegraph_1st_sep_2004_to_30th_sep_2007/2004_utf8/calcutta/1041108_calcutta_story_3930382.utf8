Bon Appetease

Victor Banerjee

I never cease to be taken aback when confronted on 

the streets by someone who has actually been cooking what I have been recommending. 

Culinary adventurism is a rare phenomenon and yet, there are those who obviously 

love to try something ?different? and have some fun in the kitchen. The icing 

on the cake was when, after I had given my pushpanjali at our neighbourhood 

Durga Puja pandal, a grey-haired dowager snuggled up to me and said she had actually 

tried out my whisky and oatmeal water recipe and that her family had got a mind-blowing 

kick out of something deliriously provocative. Amen.

Now that winter is creeping up on us, biryani 

is something that a lot of us are going to make simply because it stretches and 

because you need cook nothing else for a houseful of guests. 

Herewith is a laborious step-by-step infallible recipe 

unlike anything you have ever read before or have ever tasted. This is my gift 

to you all for this Kali Puja, Id or Christmas or any politically inspired iftar 

party that you may wish to host.

BIRYANI (for 10 famished, to 12 simple, gluttons!)

Ingredients:

Fine boiled rice ? 2 kg

Mutton ? 2 kg (cut into large [pieces] botis) 

Potatoes ? As many as the number of guests, at least 

Ghee ? ? kg (do not skimp)

Onion ? ? kg

Method: 

First marinate the mutton for two hours in 2 dstspn 

(dessert spoons) ginger paste, 1 ? dstspn garlic paste, 1 ? dstspn red chilli 

paste and 250 g curd. Mix all thoroughly with the meat and keep aside.

Cut the onion into fine slices and fry till golden 

brown in the ghee. Strain the ghee completely and crush the browned 

onions and keep aside.

Peel and cut the potatoes at a slant, without cutting 

through. In a dekchi put a spoonful of the crushed onions, a little saffron 

for colour and half of the strained ghee along with a cup of water and 

a pinch of salt. Let the potatoes cook in this until the water dries up and the 

potatoes are half cooked and have a good colour.

Put the left over ghee into the meat mixture 

and place it back on the fire till the mutton water has dried out. Then fry for 

a while till it has a good colour, add a little water and pressure cook it for 

15 minutes. When done, put 3 tsp of kewra water, 3 tsp of garam masala 

powder made of laung (cloves), jaiphal and javitri (nutmeg 

seed and flower) bari elaichi (large black cardamom) and dalchini 

(cinnamon) all powdered together. Keep meat aside.

Heat the rice water in a big dekchi, put some 

bayleaf, laung, elaichi and salt in the water and let it boil.

Put in the rice and let it cook stirring from time 

to time and feeling the rice to check when it is half cooked. Then, strain it 

in a strainer basket or muslin cloth, ensuring the water drains out really well.

Now, in the same rice dekchi smeared nicely 

with ghee, put a layer of the drained half-cooked rice, sprinkle a little 

shahi jeera and saffron mixed in a little milk and water. Then put 

a layer of mutton, and a few potatoes. Now another layer of rice, shahi jeera, 

saffron water. Pile them as you feel you should. Now add some rose water and kewra 

water. When all is done, make a hole in the middle of the rice (in the dekchi) 

with a long handle of a spoon, right through to the bottom of the utensil. Pour 

all the ghee and water of the mutton and potatoes into the hole and cover 

the lid of the dekchi.

FOR DUM

Cover the lid of the dekchi with a nice big 

cloth. Place a heavy stone on the lid (or you can seal the lid with some kneaded 

atta). This dekchi should now be placed on a tawa full of 

ashes (raakh). Let it remain like this for two hours. To make sure the 

dum is fully done, sprinkle some water on the outer body of the dekchi 

just with your finger tips. If the water trickles down it should not be removed 

from the fire. If the water dries immediately it means the rice is fully done. 

You are ready to serve. For those of you who want 

to maintain a parochial difference from the treats of Hyderabad and Old Delhi, 

I shall give you a typically ?Bongla-deshi? drink to go with this fabulous biryani, 

next week,

If I never write another piece, I will have left you 

with a do-it-yourself recipe that will reinforce stale marriages and make innocent 

young maidens more eligible than all the fortunes that their fathers can ever 

bestow upon unworthy slobs as dowry.

With this, may your winter of contentment turn into 

a glorious era of gastronomic device to conquer and plunder armies that march 

on their bellies !

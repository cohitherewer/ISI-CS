 Six new pre-paid taxi booths

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Taxi operators have initiated a move to set up six pre-paid booths across the city to reduce refusal by drivers.

 The booths will come up at Sealdah, Howrah, Gariahat, Jadavpur, Shakespeare Sarani and Shyambazar. At present, there are only three such booths ? at Sealdah, Howrah and Karunamoyee (Salt Lake).

 ?We have got a clearance from the transport department and the traffic police. The final round of discussions with the traffic police is on to finalise the locations. We want to start the booths after the Pujas,? said Bimal Guha, Bengal Taxi Association secretary. 

 ?We want to maintain cordial relations with our passengers. Though instances of taxi refusal have come down, we are still receiving some complaints,? he added. 

 Hailing the move, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said: ?The operators have been told to consult the traffic police in finalising the spots for the booths.? Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Banibrata Basu said the taxi operators will be provided all help in setting up the booths.

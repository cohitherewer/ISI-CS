 Revival of Mughal art

 Jhuma Chattopadhyay is an artist who prefers to stay away from the limelight but her works are sure to catch the eyes of discerning conoisseurs of art. Chattopadhyay seems to be fascinated by the geometrical precision of architectural buildings of the Mughal era. She captures the regal aura of the bygone era with perfection, carefully etching out all the finer details including the domes and carved minarets with precision. Chattopadhyay uses dark, sombre colours and offsets them against a bright, usually azure sky. Dark mahogany brown seems to be her most frequently used base colour. This dye lends maturity to the heavy, ornate and ageing architectural masterpieces. She is quite at ease as she plays with natural light and shade.

 Event: Paintings by Jhuma Chattopadhyay

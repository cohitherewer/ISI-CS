The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 When angels meet, melody rules

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Nishat Khan with Buddy Guy, Carlos Santana and Jeff Beck in Dallas

 When city-born young sitar exponent Nishat Khan was invited by Eric Clapton to share the stage with a clutch of axe icons like Carlos Santana, Jeff Beck and John McLaughlin at the Crossroads Festival in Cotton Bowl, Dallas, Texas, the chemistry was instant and the impact electric.

 ?I was the only sitar player in that galaxy of guitar greats this July, with Clapton, B.B. King, Pat Metheny, Jimmy Page, Buddy Guy, Ozzy Osborne, Paco De Lucia, Al Di Meola and others playing complementary to each other. It was an exhilarating experience. I struck an instant rapport, particularly with Carlos and Pat,? he adds.

 He is in town on a reconnoitre trip for a possible ?Meeting of Angels? concert in Calcutta during Easter 2005, with a Gregorian chant ensemble, a project he took to Zagreb in January 2004, on the invitation of the Croatian President.

 While his hometown looks certain to play host to this unique marriage of Indian ragas with Gregorian chants, to be presented by Showhouse, Khan also has the germ of a crack collaboration on home turf in mind.

 ?In Dallas, Carlos, Pat and I got talking and we are looking at some interesting possibilities. Pat wants to get locked up in a room with me playing the sitar, but we would also like to play together in public domain. Calcutta listens to music with its soul and it would be great to bring these guitar gurus here,? says Khan.

 The 40-year-old sitarist, whose virtuosity has been compared to Jimi Hendrix (in Chicago Times) and Bach (in Washington Times) because of the ?ingenious, very personal interpretation of his musical heritage?, has done ?a major fusion collaboration? with Flamenco artiste Paco Pena. 

 He has also teamed up with McLaughlin, Philip Glass, Evelyn Glennie and Django Bates for various projects.

 ?I would really like to bring Pat to India and also Carlos, who is a very good friend. We relate to each other and there?s a lot of mutual respect and bonhomie. But my immediate goal is the Gregorian chant concert in Calcutta, a concord where I will use an eight-member choir from Croatia for the chants,? says Khan.

 The scion of one of Indias most renowned musical families, Khan has conquered not only the North Indian classical idiom, but has also traversed realms as diverse as the chants, Western classical, abstract jazz and Flamenco.

 In August 2002, he was invited to perform at the Japanese Parliament DIET in Tokyo, his concert marking the 50th anniversary of Indo-Japanese diplomatic ties. 

 Currently based in Beverly Hills, California, Khan is a visiting professor at University of California, Los Angeles.

 ?My goal is bringing the world together through my music and I hope Meeting of Angels can be a small step towards that,? Khan says.

 And Calcutta hopes it can also have its wish of a tryst with Santana and Metheny granted.

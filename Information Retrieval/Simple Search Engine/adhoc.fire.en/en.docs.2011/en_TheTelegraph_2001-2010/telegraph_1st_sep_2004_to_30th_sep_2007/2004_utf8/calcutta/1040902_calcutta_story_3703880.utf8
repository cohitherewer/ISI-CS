 Inspired artistic creativity

 When a group of young, aspiring artists come together to share their ideas, it is but natural that it will result in a free flow of innovative thinking, unleashing a tide of immense creativity. It is no surprise then, that the members of Scarlet have successfully translated their visions and dreams into fine objects of art, reflecting their very own principles of life, truth and beauty. Their third exhibition of art, featuring an extensive collection of paintings, graphics and sculptures, bring to the fore the artists impression and interpretation of several aspects of modern life including war, religion, nature and interpersonal relationships, to name a few. Dhruba Ghoshs work on ceramic, that appears above, is a splendid statement of the sculptors idea that co-ordination and balance are essential factors to attaining perfection in life. Santanu Chakrabortys Life in Nature, Sudipta Majumdars Goddess and Dipanjan Das Towards Light, are some of the paintings on show that deserve special mention.

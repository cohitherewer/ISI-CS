The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Top cop with music in his soul

 M.K. Singh

An IPS and a singer with two albums in his kitty. 

M.K. Singh sure stands out in the khaki brigade. And with Abhishek Bachchan 

set to lend voice to his lyrics for Rituparno Ghosh?s Antarmahal next week, 

his credentials as a lyricist are also beyond doubt.

 ?I grew up in a family where radio was a strict no-no, leave along singing,? muses the regional passport officer. But Singh was fortunate to have friends who encouraged his singing abilities in school. The first formal recognition of his talent came in Class V when he won an audition for the lead voice in a chorus. ?It was a patriotic song composed by a teacher. The Indo-Pak war had ended in 1965 and preparations were on for the Bangladesh war.?

 After school, Singh went on to St Columbus College, Hazaribagh, where a music group called Black Masks assembled almost every evening. In 1977, an inter-college competition took place among all 37 colleges under Ranchi University, from Munger to Jamshedpur to Dhanbad to Kodarma. Singh picked up the medal with his rendition of Kabhi kabhi mere dil mein. ?That was the first time I realised that I do sing well,? the former DC, traffic, laughs.

 In Delhi University, he would be imitating all leading voices ? Mukesh, Hemant Kumar, S.D. Burman? ?I have never received formal training but that worked as a learning experience.? As a member of Spicmacay, he would also listen to the likes of Kishori Amonkar, Gangubai Hangal, Shobha Gurtu and the Dagar brothers. ?That helped me develop a ear for classical music.?

 Laurels followed alongside professional accomplishments. During his probational training in Mussourie, he emerged as the best actor and singer among the 300-odd probationers. At National Police Academy, Hyderabad, he directed a play, Ashar ka Ek Din, which fetched him two more awards.

 The top cop, who was posted in Midnapore as superintendant of police in the blood-splattered days of Garbeta and Keshpur, says music has always helped him relax. ?I had to travel a lot in those days. Instead of getting tense while rushing to a troubled spot, I would immerse myself in music.?

 His first album came in 2001, out of a concern for Bhojpuri lyrics becoming frivolous and lewd. ?Ae Babua sold 35,000 copies. I even picked up an award for the best regional music.? Ruk Ja Sajanwa followed in 2003. This year saw him tour Surinam, Guyana and Barbados with ICCR-sponsored shows. 

 And after being the voice singing a bhajan in the backdrop at the Varanasi ghat in the closing frames of Chokher Bali, it is time for him to return to the big screen, this time in a different role.

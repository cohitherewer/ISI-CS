Bottomline: bank on us

AdLib

When it comes to money-keeping, there is no substitute 

for the trust factor

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

Many years AGO, I used to share a room in Bombay (not 

Mumbai!) with a banker friend. Both of us were paying guests. We used to inevitably 

have our dinners together, at the friendly neighbourhood Irani shop.

Every now and then our man from the foreign bank would 

be working very late. He would call me to say he couldn?t join me for dinner. 

Next day, I would ask him what had wrong the night before.

It always was an account reconciliation problem. The 

amount creating the problem was often as trivial as a few paise. Half jokingly, 

I used to ask him why he didn?t pay the few paise from his own pocket and be done 

with it. His reply was always the same. What if errors were of large amounts? 

Just as well he did not pay heed to my illiterate advice. He is one of the leading 

lights of the financial world today.

Banking, he had told me then, is an easy business. 

You take a loan from someone at 5 per cent and then lend it to someone else at 

9.5 per cent. The difference is what a bank earns. It really sounded simple. There 

is just this one thing he did not elaborate. You needed one thing, more than anything 

else, to succeed in the banking industry. And that one thing is not money.

People must have enough confidence in you to lend 

money to and rely on you enough to borrow from. It is easier said than done. Even 

at that early stage, he skipped his dinner date with me and burnt midnight oil, 

earning the trust of his clients.

Things were a trifle easier a few decades ago. The 

banking business was then mostly B2B, a business to business affair. You and I 

rarely went to the bank to borrow. They would not let us. We went to the bank 

to keep our money there. Naturally, we looked for the safest bank.

Two significant changes have taken place since. A 

significant portion of the banking business has become B2C ? that is business 

to consumer. Indeed, lending to consumers, either directly for housing, car, etc 

or through credit cards has now become the most visible part of the banking business.

In the current context, the consumer is not particularly 

bothered about how trustworthy his lender is, as long as he feels comfortable 

with the interest and terms of the loan. Yes, we continue to keep our money in 

the bank but safety of our money is possibly no longer on top of our minds while 

choosing our bank. The other change is in terms of our graduating to mutual funds 

and equities. We have learnt to live better with financial risks.

Yet the consumer feels uneasy today. All around him 

there is this anxiety. It is a world that the consumer has recently entered. He 

feels ill equipped to negotiate this world. He does not wish to exit the world 

either. How else is he going to get his new car or 11th-floor flat?

Prices of dreams are quoted to him, not in lakhs of 

rupees but in hundreds of rupees per month. Lured by EMI and mutual funds on one 

hand and deterred by his unfamiliarity with the world of banking and finance, 

he is desperately looking for help.

Have you seen the new campaign from ICICI bank? Through 

gestures and words all that they are saying is ?Hum Hai Na?. Who said ?trust? 

is pass? for a bank? It has just acquired a fresh nuance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 SMS spurt secret to small screen success

 At your fingertips: Sachin in action

 Exciting programmes, new channels, innovative promotional campaigns and different distribution platforms. What?s next in line for the broadcasters beaming soaps and sports to your small screen?

 Clue: it has nothing to do with television. The cell phone in general, and Short Messaging Service (SMS) in particular, is what broadcasters like STAR and Sony are eyeing for the next scene of action.

 STAR floated a separate wireless division in June, while Sony plans to do so in the near future. ?The idea is to make 7827 the preferred SMS number,? Peter Mukerjea, STAR India CEO, told Metro at the launch of the STAR One channel in the city on Tuesday. ?We are also looking at letting our advertisers use the number for promotions,? adds Mukerjea.

 Channels are using dedicated numbers (STAR?s 7827 or Sony?s 2525) to increase interactivity with their audience. Viewers can send in contest answers, receive programme updates, download logos and ringtones and even watch video clips of programmes.

 But for the moment, it?s SMS that remains the key focus area. ?During Champions Trophy, for the Captain?s Corner contest, we saw a response of 8,000 SMS in one minute,? reveals N.P. Singh, CFO, SET India. Kismat Jagao 7827 Lagao, another contest launched recently by STAR, received ?67 lakh? text messages over a period of 14 days.

 ?We have a tie-up with Hutch, through which Hutch subscribers can view schedules, synopses and promos, download ringtones and watch clips from our serials like Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin,? explains Singh. The Hutch service offers content from around 13 channels.

 STAR is also gearing up for delivering clips over mobile phone. ?We?re looking at offering news bytes, sports highlights like fall of wickets and goal of the day,? says Mukerjea, adding that advancements in technology will be the key factor for the growth and nature of content available on phones.

 India?s cellular subscriber base (3.35 crore by September end, according to Cellular Operators Association of India data) and growth rate are other reasons why broadcasters are seeing a lot of scope in the area. ?It?s also a one-to-one opportunity for the viewer to interact with us, making him more comfortable,? adds Singh. Sony expects another SMS surge when it provides viewers the opportunity to vote for its upcoming Indian Idol contest through 2525.

 Though revenues from SMS and other cell phone related services are yet to make up a significant slice of the overall revenue pie, it is the potential for growth that has the channels excited. 

 ?We only started a year ago and downloads are not very expensive,? admits Singh, ?but as volumes grow and range of content increases, it is sure to get much better.?

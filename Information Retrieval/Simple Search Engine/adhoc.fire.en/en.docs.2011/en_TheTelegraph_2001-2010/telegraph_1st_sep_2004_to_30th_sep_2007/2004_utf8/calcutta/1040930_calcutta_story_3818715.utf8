Staying fit is fun

Sweating it out is no longer a depressing 

thought. Ipsita Deb finds out how to burn those calories while having a 

blast

Exercise should be child?s play. To enjoy workouts 

and increase the likelihood of sticking to a fitness plan, adults ought to play 

more. Just watch a child having a ball and you know why ? it is fun, spontaneous 

and yes, a great calorie-burner.

The trick lies in finding an activity, or range of 

activities, that you enjoy. The first thing to do is to tune into the rhythm of 

your body and then groove to it. If mornings may work best for some, evenings 

might be a better option for others. While for some the usual gym and aerobics 

routine may seem the only way out, for others a wacky workout routine (or the 

lack of it) can work just fine.

So, experiment with exercise truths and have fun while 

you sweat it out.

Punch line

If cardio machines make your heart skip the wrong 

beat and you just cannot bear to lace up for another step class, you might consider 

adding some chops, kicks and flips to your exercise routine.

Try Solace?s Masterblaster class and watch yourself 

get a real kick out of life in workout lane. Besides being fun, the benefits of 

martial arts are huge ? increased self-confidence, energy, strength, stamina and 

mental capability, along with calorie combat and fat-burning.

While the latest chartbusters play on in the background, 

the class sweats it out for a no-break 90-minute period of body conditioning. 

Starting off on a fast track with spot jogging, aerobics, boot-camp, circuit and 

shuttle exercises, the women sporting tracks, Tees and sneakers gear up to be 

stronger and fitter.

?It is all about mind and body co-ordination. People 

invariably think that this is going to be tough, but it isn?t. With props like 

X-er tubes, stability balls and weights, there is little scope for monotony and 

much for fun,? says instructor Mrinalini Mukherjee.

The class ends on a slower note through meditation 

and yoga. Conducted every Wednesday from 5 pm to 6.30 pm at the Sunny Park address, 

the classes are great for anybody who wants to enjoy shedding some weight and 

paying back a sleazy one-liner with a stylish punch. Age no bar.

Waves and shakes

The use of dance as a therapeutic tool is grounded 

in the idea that the body and mind are completely integrated. The theory underlying 

dance therapy is that body movements reflect the inner state of the being, and 

that by moving the body within a guided therapeutic setting, a healing process 

begins. Emerging inner conflicts and issues from the unconscious to the consciousness 

of the person are addressed at various levels ? physical, emotional, mental and 

spiritual.

With dance therapy emerging as a favoured fitness 

form, The Spa at The Park Hotel conducts regular workshops and classes in this 

therapeutic form.

?Dance has a place in everyone?s life, and for it 

to be utilised as a promotion for good health is indeed a worthwhile venture,? 

says instructor Raja Chatterjee.

?Since people are so stressed out in today?s world 

due to flexible working hours, the focus here is on allowing a person to completely 

express herself in serene surroundings to the tune of soft classical music,? he 

adds.

The Spa also conducts Aqua Aerobics classes. This 

improves strength and tone, and increases flexibility of all muscles. Being able 

to swim is not a prerequisite for this class.

It is an exciting, fast-paced programme that aids 

weight control, lowers calorie count and tones the body. ?The purpose is to bring 

about positive changes in personal health and fitness through the learning of 

exercise and movement patterns, utilising the safe and effective medium of water. 

Being in water completely relaxes the muscles,? says aqua aerobics instructor 

Neelam Rout.

These classes are less strenuous and yet great calorie-burners. 

If you are looking for total relaxation, what better than dancing till you drop 

before making a splash in a cool pool.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A star, an actor and a producer

Suniel Shetty and (above) a promotional still 

from Rakht 

Rakht may be just another release for the plethora 

of stars in the cast, but for Suniel Shetty it is more a reason for high blood 

pressure! For the Mahesh Manjrekar thriller also happens to be Shettys second 

production venture under the banner of his Popcorn Motion Pictures (after Khel 

was stumped by the box-office).

 Being both a producer and an actor puts me under much greater pressure, confides the macho man. Being a producer is a tough job in itself. But at the end of it all, if the final product turns out to be as good as Rakht, I am not complaining.

 With Rakht, which he co-produces with liquor baron Vijay Mallya, Shetty feels Bollywood is set to charter new flight paths. We have had a lot of romantic films and musicals. Rakht is something that has never been made before on the Indian screen; it is one of its kind. On Saturday night, we all saw the first trial show and it has turned out to be a fast edge-of-the-seat thriller.

 The action hero with a soft touch hopes that the galaxy of stars will help the film glitter at the turnstiles. In a movie having an element of mystery, known faces help. Otherwise you tend to forget the character because of the unknown actor. When you know everyone on screen, you start doubting every character.

 Shetty is also looking forward to the audience reaction to his role in the film. I am playing this mentally deranged mechanic It is another attempt of mine at doing something drastically different. These days, screen time doesnt count and an actor has to do all sorts of role. So many people have appreciated my small little cameo in Kyun! Ho Gaya Na These pats on the back matter a lot and the icing on the cake is the film becoming a hit.

 Refusing to read too much into the sudden death of Khel, the actor-producer insists: It was a great launch for our production company. We made a grand film and we also marketed the film in a big way. So we did our bit as the makers. Obviously it would have been greater had the film been a hit.

The release of Rakht has been timed to ensure there is no other film of the same genre for a clash of audience interest. Lets see how it fares Next we are planning an entertainer, a comedy perhaps.

 While Suniel Shetty the producer is planning a comedy, Suniel Shetty the actor already has two comedies ready for release Mahesh Manjrekars Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav and Kundan Shahs Ek Se Badhkar Ek. I havent done many comedies apart from Hera Pheri and Gopi Kishan. Both were appreciated a lot but didnt do all that well at the box-office. But now with the huge number of multiplexes coming up, I am sure families will flock to see both my new crazy comedies. While Laloo... is an action comedy, very glossy in look and feel, Ek Se Badhkar Ek is a typical Kundan Shah laugh riot.

 If theres one thing the star is unhappy about, its the media bashing of Anubhav Sinhas Dus, for which he was shooting in Canada for the past couple of weeks. It looked like a planned campaign but let me tell you we have achieved what we set out to do. The producers are planning to show the distributors what they have shot.

 That is then. For now, Rakht is ready to flow this Friday at INOX (Forum and City Centre), 89 Cinemas, Navina, Basusree and other theatres.

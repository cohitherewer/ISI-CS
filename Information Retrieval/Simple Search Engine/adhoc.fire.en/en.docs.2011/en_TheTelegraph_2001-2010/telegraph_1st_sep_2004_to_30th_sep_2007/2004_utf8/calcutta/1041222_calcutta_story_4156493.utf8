 Wake-up call for elders

 Most parents see in their children an extension of their own unfulfilled ambitions, imposing upon their offspring a life wherein the children are compelled to forsake their own interests, dreams and desires. In their pursuit to make their children conform to social stereotypes of success in academics and in career, parents crush their childrens special gifts and qualities, breeding in them feelings of resentment and converting them into mechanical beings cut off from their true inner selves. In an attempt to make society aware of the harmful effects of such a potentially dangerous social scenario is the Natrang production, Aap Hamare Hain Kaun. Directed by Balwant Thakur, the play shakes parents and educationists out of a moral stupor which engenders materialism, consumerism and a mechanical way of life. Highlighting the problems that children suffer because of the over-ambitious nature of their parents and also due to a hostile social environment, this play empathises with the lot of today?s youngsters.

 Event: Play in Hindi, Aap Hamare Hain Kaun, produced by Natrang, Jammu

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

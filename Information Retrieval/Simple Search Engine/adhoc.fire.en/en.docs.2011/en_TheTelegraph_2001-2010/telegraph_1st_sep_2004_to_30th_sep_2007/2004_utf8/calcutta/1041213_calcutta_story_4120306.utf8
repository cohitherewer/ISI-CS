The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Preserving the past for future

 NISHA LAHIRI

Living history, forgotten legacy: Basubari 

in Bagbazar (above) and Sovabazar Rajbati. 

 She lives in a modern city, but her love is for the old and faded. Architecture is her passion, and Calcutta is her lab, in a bid to preserve the past through a record of the city?s public and private buildings. Joanne Taylor?s fascination has finally come to fruition, and the result, she promises, will be available to everyone.

 The Sydney-based business woman has a soft corner for India, which she visited first in the early 1970s. ?I had studied some Indian history as an under-graduate in Sydney University. So, an Indian business associate of my husband?s invited me to Calcutta to visit his family home. I just fell in love with it, because I had never seen anything like it,? recalls the blonde Australian.

 That was some years ago. Taylor returned in April, touring four buildings during her four-day stay. For the past month, she ?played detective? in about 20-odd old buildings in Calcutta, Howrah and nearby areas. Her photographs an ode to the rich cultural and architectural history of Bengal.

 Sovabazar Rajbati, Lahabari, Basubari in Bagbazar, the many Mullickbaris, Marble Palace, Jorasanko Thakurbari, Burdwan Palace? Heritage is high fashion in Australia, and it is that fascination Taylor is feeding with her work. ?Back home, people pay to get that rustic look, which is easily found here.?

 The disrepair that the buildings have fallen into is cause for concern. ?There were some houses where I couldn?t muster the courage to go to certain areas. It was too dangerous,? says she. 

 But it?s the warm welcome from the friendly inhabitants of the houses that has spurred her on. It all started by spreading the word among a few friends and writing a few letters. ?Everybody knew somebody else and soon, I was allowed into a lot of homes.? 

 Sometimes, it was more a question of chance. ?I would just stand in front of a house that had caught my fancy and click. Curious, the occupants would ask what I was doing, and when I explained, they would invite me in and show me every nook and cranny. It was wonderful.?

 From family treasure chests filled with memorabilia like photographs and documents to the library to dig up records, Taylor has done it all. And not just on buildings, but also on the families who have lived in them for generations. ?Living history: the forgotten heritage of Calcutta?, is what she dubs her work.

 What began as a passionate pursuit has now graduated into something much bigger. She will be doing a doctral thesis on the subject when she goes back to university next year. But she has already met with interested publishers in Calcutta to bring out a book. ?Otherwise, I will donate my work to some archive here, so people can have access,? she signs off, before promising to return next year.

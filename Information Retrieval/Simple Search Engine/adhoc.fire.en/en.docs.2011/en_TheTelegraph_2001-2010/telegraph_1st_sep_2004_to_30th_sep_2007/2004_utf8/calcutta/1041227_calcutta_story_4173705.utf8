 Inspired art

 Up-to-date and contemporary in every aspect, the art of Srimati Lal, a curator and prolific art critic, is born from a single-minded intensity that shows her narrating stories truthfully, boldly and dramatically. Flame, the ongoing exhibition of her paintings and drawings, bears testimony to the artist?s passion, dedication and discipline through works that reflect a rare combination of humour, compassion and objective detachment in her characterisations. Her paintings have a beauty and perfection derived from a technically flawless style and the ability to improvise with care and sensitivity. Articulating ideas and emotions through a mature use of colours, Lal?s art successfully transforms her inspirations, Van Gogh and Matisse, into her own lucid language.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Srimati Lal

 When: Till January 3, 2 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Genesis Art Gallery 8B Middleton Street

 Durga puja may get bigger and brighter with every passing year, but when it comes to the rituals, the only change is a decreasing number of hands to help the priest. Now, a remedy is at hand for the lack of knowhow among para women who have traditionally been the bedrock of puja samogri organisation in a baroari puja. 

 From Tuesday, a workshop is being organised on Raja Dinendra Street, in Maniktala, to train those wanting to lend a helping hand. Organised by Baidik Pandit O Purohit Mohamilan Kendra, it will teach all aspects of rituals to participants for free. Explaining the crying need for such an initiative, Pandit Nitai Chakraborty says: ?The lack of informed assistants has an especially damaging impact on Sandhipuja, which has to be completed in 48 minutes. The ritual is extremely elaborate. Petals of 108 lotuses have to be peeled open and 108 lamps have to be lit. The offerings for naibedya, bhog, arati and balidaan have to be kept ready as well. It is a common complaint at pandals across the city ? without able helping hands, priests are failing to keep to the demanding timeframe.? 

 The five-day workshop, in which participants can register on the spot, will take them through the paces of borondala decoration to collection of ingredients of naibedya. ?With the breakdown of the joint family, such knowledge is not getting handed down as they always had been,? Chakraborty feels. 

 Agrees Kajori Mullick, who has signed up for participation. ?We never bothered to learn such things in our childhood, as the elders were there to do it all.? A mother of a 14-year-old now, she wants to be equipped to handle Ashtami puja at home, as well as help out at her neighbouring Karbala Tank Lane Sarbojanin puja. For Purnima Ghosh of Bagbazar, the workshop is a stepping stone to holding Durga puja at home. ?It is also tough to find a priest during Lakshmi or Saraswati puja. I should know how to handle such an emergency at home,? she says.

 Chakraborty is also holding a workshop for priests and has instituted Purohit Ratna, a talent search for priests, during Durga puja. ?It is five years now that we have launched this award. Our backs are to the wall, but we do not find any sponsorship for our efforts.? he rues.

 Cards to revive stadium

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty has learnt a lesson from the disruption in power supply to Yuba Bharati Krirangan (Salt Lake stadium), that had left the government red-faced during a pre-World Cup football match between India and Japan last month.

 Five days after an action replay during an IFA Shield tie on October 8, minister Chakraborty disclosed plans to safeguard against such dark disruptions at Netaji Indore Stadium.

 Chakraborty?s plan includes introduction of a gold card, which will allow its holder free entry to the Salt Lake and Netaji Indoor stadiums. He hopes to raise Rs 10 crore by selling the cards and organising fund-raisers.

 Chakraborty has appealed to local MPs, MLAs and sports-lovers to donate generously to the fund, that will be spent entirely on the stadium?s renovation. Besides, he intends to seek sponsorship from corporate houses by naming the four gates after them.

 The gold cards will be of various denominations, ranging from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. VIP gold card-holders (Rs 10 lakh or more) will be entitled to witness any match or programme at the Salt Lake stadium, besides free entry to the indoor stadium. 

 According to sports department officials, the card system was first introduced while the Salt Lake stadium was being constructed in the late 1970s. The sports department had mopped up Rs 20 crore by selling cards under the banner of the Society for Sports and Stadiums (SSS). 

 An SSS card-holder does not have to pay to witness any event at the Salt Lake stadium or Eden Gardens. 

 A formal finance department nod is awaited for the gold card scheme. ?Netaji Indoor is the largest stadium of its kind in the country. It needs immediate repairs. Since the government is cash-strapped, we have decided to launch a drive to raise money. The West Bengal Sports Council is taking up several fundraiser programmes, too,?? the minister said on Wednesday.

 The stadium was reopened in March with some minor repairs after a nine-month gap. The government is still not allowing any mega event to be held here and has restricted the number of guests. Its air-conditioning system has broken down and plaster is peeling off. The roof is cracked and the electric wiring damaged.

 Sports department joint secretary Swapan Chakraborty said at least Rs 5 crore is needed immediately for emergency renovation work.

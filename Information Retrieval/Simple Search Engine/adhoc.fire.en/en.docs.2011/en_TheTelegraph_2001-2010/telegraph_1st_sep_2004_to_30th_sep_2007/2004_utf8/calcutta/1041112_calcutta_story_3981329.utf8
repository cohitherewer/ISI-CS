Mirror magic on the walls 

Feng Shui 

Pinky Kapoor

 Circular or oval mirrors are excellent for the 

northern walls and rectangular ones enhance career and wealth when placed on the 

south-eastern walls. Mirrors should be very carefully placed in the house so they 

do not reflect the main entrance, bathroom or kitchen door.

I would like to know where mirrors can be comfortably 

placed in the house. Do the shapes and heights of the mirrors also matter?

Shobhana Agarwal

The Solution: Mirrors should be very carefully 

placed in the house so they do not reflect the main entrance, bathroom or kitchen 

door. They should not reflect any negative objects outside through the windows. 

Circular or oval mirrors are excellent for the northern walls and rectangular 

ones enhance career and wealth when placed on the south-eastern walls. They are 

best avoided on the southern and south-western walls. Mirrors should not be tinted 

or tarnished and should be kept spotlessly clean. Large plain mirrors reflect 

our energy fields while narrow ones can make us subconsciously feel cramped. 

Mirrored tiles slice human images and have a disturbing 

effect on personal aura. They should be large enough and placed such that you 

can see the entire head at once. They should be well-framed, otherwise the raw 

and sharp edges send out harmful energy.

Fashion facts

My husband and I have been fashion designers for 

the past three years. We have been doing very well and have received much attention. 

Where should we place the records of our achievements and newspaper cuttings? 

We would also like to know where to keep the details of projects we are currently 

working on.

Name and address withheld

The Solution: Display your well-deserved achievements 

and clippings on a triangular maroon soft board mounted on a wooden frame on the 

southern wall of your office. 

 Place your firm?s name on top and illuminate it with strong light. Such an arrangement will bring greater fame, recognition and appreciation from your clients. West is the area of creativity, so it is the perfect direction to keep the papers with details of the projects you are currently working on.

Family focus

We live in a big joint family in which there is 

no unity among family members. I have recently noticed that there is no construction 

in the eastern part of the house, which falls in the garden. But no major modifications 

can be made. We are sleeping in a bedroom in the extreme eastern side and there 

is a sudden cut immediately after this. Can I make alterations in my bedroom to 

help bring some harmony to the family?

S.M.

The Solution: Mirrors are known as the aspirin 

of Feng Shui. They are extremely powerful in intensifying energy and creating 

an illusion of space and depth from within the house when exteriors cannot be 

touched. Place a small ornamental mirror with a green wooden frame on the eastern 

wall of your bedroom. Ensure it is at a level so your bodies are not reflected 

in it while you are sleeping. Further, displaying photos of all the family members 

in wooden frames on a low cabinet below the mirror will help draw the family together 

and increase communication.

Cosy corner

Our house has projections in the north-east and 

south-east. The eastern part, also the entrance to our home, is recessed. Please 

suggest ways to balance this area. We also have too many columns in the living 

area. These create problems while arranging furniture in the room and also seem 

to obstruct vision from all angles. Is there an easy way to solve this problem?

Samrat Anand

The Solution: The eastern part that falls out 

of the house can be decorated lavishly with inspirational paintings, fresh potted 

plants, a green carpet or a rug and a personal light that gives an impression 

of your own space. Columns can be connected with low cabinets to create continuity 

in the living area. Placing beautiful lamps and artefacts here can further highlight 

these. This space can be used for a cosy sit out.

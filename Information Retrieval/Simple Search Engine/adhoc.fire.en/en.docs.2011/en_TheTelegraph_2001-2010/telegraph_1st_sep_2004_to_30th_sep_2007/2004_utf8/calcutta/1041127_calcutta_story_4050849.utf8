It is intriguing that during the three centuries and 

more of its existence, our city has attracted and inspired visual artists of different 

kinds, at different times, and from different ethos. Of course, the early names 

that come to mind are almost exclusively European.

Along with soldiers, fortune hunters, adventurers 

and traders of all hues came the itinerant European artists to the growing city 

of Calcutta. Perhaps it was the centuries-old Kalighat pata painters who 

were here long before Job Charnock, perhaps there was something intrinsically 

artistic in the rich fertile soil on the east bank of the Hooghly.

Whatever the reason, or the conjecture, the fact remains 

that through its history the city has been seen by the eyes of foreign artists, 

and rendered through artistic perceptions that remain unique to the experience 

we call Calcutta.

The first to arrive, of course, was the uncle-and-nephew 

team of the Daniells family, who left behind phenomenal examples of visual perception 

of the birth of a city growing out of the rural ambience of the three villages 

on the riverside. Their use of the camera obscura helped them capture details 

in their sketches with the precision and perfection that only photography was 

to do later in time.

History has found the evidence of more than 50 artists 

who came to Calcutta in the 19th century alone, and left behind magnificent examples 

of their art inspired by the city at different times, and from different perspectives. 

Their names are mostly forgotten, their work is scattered haphazardly throughout 

the world, yet they give evidence that our city has always caught the attention 

of foreign artists.

The bustling bazaars and the vigorous variety of people 

have remained immortalised in the work of Balthazar Solvyns. The babus 

of Calcutta, painted by the great portrait painter George Chinary, remain our 

only testament of the pre-photographic history of the city and its people.

Other painters followed, from other corners of the 

world and the subcontinent, names that we may have individually forgotten, but 

whose paintings are remembered in the significant body of work that art historians 

have chosen to call the Company Painters.

When paintings and sketches as records of reality 

were supplanted by photography, the lenses of celebrated photographers, who kept 

coming here, time and again captured our very visual city. Some of them, like 

Mr Bourne and Mr Shepherd, chose to stay on here. Even today, their shop is a 

treasure house of glass negatives that we have cared neither to preserve, nor 

to archive.

Time has brought in new media for the visual artist, 

and new visual languages of expression. The first moving pictures in India were 

shot in Bombay, when British royalty arrived in India for the first time, with 

the Crown Prince setting foot on imperial soil at the Gateway of India. Bombay?s 

historical advantage in motion picture has remained, but our city, too, has attracted 

a fair amount of attention. It is only symptomatic that a Mira Nair, who began 

her career with a salaam to Bombay, should find her way here.

Hollywood hardly ever came to India and even when 

it rarely did, it was far too interested in exotic Orientalia to consider Calcutta 

a suitable destination. Apart from stray incidents of a Errol Flynn shooting on 

the Maidan in the shadows of the Victoria Memorial, our city was largely ignored 

by Hollywood filmmakers, till the arrival of European film auteurs like Jean Renoir, 

son of the French Impressionist painter.

He shot a film based on Rumer Godden?s novel The 

River in Calcutta and its environs. He left an indelible mark on our culture 

of cinema, and has become part of our cultural history. His unit included cameraman 

Ramananda Sengupta, and art director Bansi Chandragupta. Two observers on his 

sets went on to become international figures. One was future cinematographer Subroto 

Mitra and the other was none other than Satyajit Ray.

In many more ways than one Renoir was a foreigner 

who taught an entire generation of technical and creative people how to look at 

their own familiar world.

Renoir?s film did not do well at the box-office but 

the interest in Calcutta continued to develop through documentary, rather than 

mainstream Hollywood, cinema. Malcolm Muggeridge?s BBC documentary on Mother Teresa, 

and Calcutta was once again the subject of search for the visual artist.

In print, Geoffery Moorehouse?s book about our city 

in the late 60s and 70s was seminal. Gunter Grass? experiences opened a whole 

storehouse of European interest in the human face we presented in the context 

of urban decay. It led up to Dominique Lapierre, and City of Joy.

The success of the book brought Hollywood back to 

our doorstep. More than anything else, we had the fortune of having our city photographed 

by the Oscar-winning cinematographer Peter Bijou, who had set new standards in 

Hollywood with Mississippi Burning. You may disagree with the film, you 

may dislike it, but you cannot ignore the quality of the visual experience Peter 

Bijou has left us with.

Perhaps the box-office failure of City of Joy 

will turn Hollywood away from us for decades again. But films have been made on 

Calcutta, and in Calcutta, by a variety of documentary and fiction filmmakers, 

primarily from Europe. 

The most celebrated, of course, was La Nuit Bengali, 

an unusual love story based in pre-war Calcutta between its writer Mircea Eliade 

and a local girl. Directed by Nicolas Klotz, the film again may not have been 

a great artistic success, but our city in a period film had its moments of glory.

Then there was a television film on William Carey, 

the Irish missionary who translated the Bible into Bengali and created the first 

example of prose in the language. An Australian filmmaker came from Down Under 

to document Christmas among the Christians, especially Anglo-Indians, inhabitants 

of an old people?s home.

I am confident that more filmmakers will arrive, new 

visual artists will try to discover signs and symbols, and new forms of visual 

art will emerge. And the city that has hosted visual artists through the centuries 

of its existence will continue to do so. So here is a warm welcome to all of them.

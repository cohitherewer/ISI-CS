 The ephemeral beauty of real flora is now replicated 

to prolonged effect in artificial flowers, leaves, twigs and even fruits. If you 

balk at the idea of flaunting garish plastic impostors alongside your tasteful 

furniture, take a closer look at silk, fine plastic and tissue flowers around 

town, which only give away their unreal self at a touch.

 While there?s no disputing the unparalleled beauty of natural flowers and plants, modern lifestyles are often sadly at odds with fresh buds.

 The new age solution is provided by these artificial counterparts that help add colour to your living or office space and perk up moods almost as successfully.

 Enjoying the fruits of all seasons is yet another advantage. Now you can top your tables and grey corners with the vibrancy of roses and sunflowers all year round, not to mention the green of all-time favourite ferns, palms, creepers and other plants.

 While seasonal fruits are about all you get on your plate, you can salivate over ripe apples, oranges and even exotic varieties like Australian grapes and kiwis heaped on the dining table or refrigerator and kitchen tops regardless of the calendar.

 The regular varieties come in stalks, creepers or in pots, but if you want to turn heads with a unique touch, there are some fine plastic floating flowers available as well. Chrysanthemums, sunflowers, tulips, roses?you can float them in a glass or metal dish filled with water. Usually kept in front of entrances or in the foyer, these exude calming charm as they add a splash of life without the bother of getting fresh flowers every day. Drop in a few seashells and funky water toys, and yours would be a statement to remember. 

 Dried flowers, shrubbery and berries are other options in this category if understated charm is what you are looking for. At the other end of the spectrum are glass flowers, a single stem of which can jazz up the dreariest corner.

 Customised bouquets using artificial flowers and other decorations are the way to create everlasting memories, rather than those that wilt in a heartbeat. Let your imagination run riot putting together fun arrangements. You can also collect stems and try your hand at prettying them up yourself.

 l the tending these evergreen beauties require is a little light dusting or a moist wipe. Who ever said that garden fresh is the best bet?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Saturday night fever

Saturday the 20th. An all-action November evening 

awaits the city. From a Royal tee-off to hosting the recently-wed daughter of 

the world?s richest Indian. From a high-profile fashion show to a Japanese jamboree 

rolling into town, the who?s who of Calcutta spent Friday chalking out its hop-step-jump 

route for the morrow. Metro flips through an overcrowded 

Saturday diary.

BLESS THE BRIDE

 Paris and Versailles in June, 24 Alipore Road in November. The Mittal marriage chariot touches down in town late on Friday and unveils a gala, but only for those armed with the 250-odd invitations sent out by Mohan Lal Mittal, father of steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal. 

 The private occasion, organised by ML and sons Vinod and Pramod, is to ?meet? and ?bless? Vanisha and husband Amit Bhatia. From 8 pm, ?close friends and family? will be entertained (with Shilpa Shetty and others scheduled to take the stage) in style.

STEP UP IN STYLE

 At the stroke of 7 in the evening, the Ball Room at the Hyatt Regency plays host to Stylefile Winter Show 2004, with an upper crust turnout of 1,400. Six style sultans from Delhi ? Rohit Gandhi, Rahul Khanna, Puja Nayyar, Rina Dhaka, Varun Bahl and Vivek Narang ? will share ramp space with Calcutta fashion rulers Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Anamika Khanna and Sabyasachi Mukherjee.

 As the designer line-up promises to haute up the balmy evening, the model menu ? Joey Matthew, Laxmi Rana, Vidisha Pavate, Jesse Randhawa, Tupur Chatterjee, Sonali Rozario, et al ? will definitely up the oomph quotient.

JAPANESE JAMBOREE

 Saturday evening also marks the beginning of a nine-day cultural extravaganza, Vision Japan 2004. Organised by the consulate-general of Japan, it will showcase numerous facets of Japanese cultural life, sports and economic development. To be inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the Academy of Fine Arts, 7 pm, one highlight will be the Japanese documentary film festival.

VERSE AND VERVE

 Before that, the chief minister is expected to recite some poetry at Sharodotsab, the diamond jubilee celebrations of Press Club, kicking off at the Maidan tent from 5.30 pm. 

 Giving Bhattacharjee musical company will be veterans Ramkumar Chattopadhyay and Nirmala Misra. But stealing the spotlight will be actress Rupa Ganguly with her Rabindrasangeet.

ROYAL BLAST

 A serious swing in the morning and glow ga-ga after dark, as Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), the oldest golfing greens outside the British Isles, tees off its 175th anniversary gala in style, again on Saturday. 

 City-bred champ Arjun Atwal, the first Indian in the USPGA Tour, promises to be the cynosure in the first session. The candle-lit fairways of the Royal will then see a blast in the evening, with 60 couples assembling for a shotgun start as Calcutta welcomes glow-golf.

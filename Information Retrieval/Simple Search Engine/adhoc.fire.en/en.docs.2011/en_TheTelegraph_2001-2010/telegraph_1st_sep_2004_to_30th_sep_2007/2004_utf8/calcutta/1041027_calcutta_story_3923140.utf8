The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 VIP green perishes under waste weight

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE 

 At a time when the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is busy planting saplings across the city to keep it pollution-free, trees planted along VIP Road are dying fast. And the authorities do not seem to care.

 Random deposition of garbage around the trees on either side of the eight-km long VIP Road, which connects the city with the airport and runs through a number of teeming neighbourhoods, has led to the death of at least 40 full-grown saal, eucalyptus and other trees over the past few months. 

 However, the North 24-Parganas district administration and the state environment department appear to have turned a blind eye to the depletion of greenery along the stretch of road.

 ?The accumulation of garbage, with both organic and inorganic components, at the roots of the trees causes enormous harm to them. The organic components in the garbage decompose with time, producing toxins loaded with deadly microbes which seep into the ground after being dissolved in water. The microbes act as poison for the trees,? A.K. Chakrabarty, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Barasat, who is in charge of overseeing the area, said on Monday. He said he was helpless to take any steps to save the dying trees.

 Apart from depletion of greenery, a suffocating stench from the accumulated garbage has now become a nightmare for residents of the area. ?The foul smell that continuously emanates from the garbage has made the area virtually unfit for human habitation,? observed an elderly resident. 

 Garbage is being deposited on both sides of VIP Road, from Gate No. 1 of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport to Sribhumi. Things are at its worst at the crossing of the VIP Road that leads to the Airport. Other major depositions of garbage are at Teghoria (near Big Bazar), Joramandir, Baguiati junction, Kestopur and near the water pumping station at Sribhumi.

 Though garbage is regularly deposited in the area, residents allege the municipal authorities are doing nothing to address the growing problem. ?What can we do if residents of both multi-storied apartments and houses in the area dump their domestic garbage beside the road nearest to their houses instead of handing it over to the man assigned to collect the garbage?? Tapas Chatterjee, chairman of the Rajarhat?Gopalpur municipality asked. He added that a new garbage heap is coming up along the road connecting Joramandir and Dum Dum Park.

 According to him, the municipality has garbage vats at Joramandir and Kestopur, from where truckloads of garbage are being taken to the dumping ground. He said nearly five metric tonnes of garbage are being regularly collected from the vats. 

 Manoj Pant, district magistrate of North 24-Parganas, also felt that the garbage should be removed regularly to keep the area clean. ?We have already asked the municipality to remove the garbage from VIP Road on a permanent basis,? he said.

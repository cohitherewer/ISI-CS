 Saturday evening found some old friends of Shashi Kapoor gathering at the Hyatt Regency poolside for the launch of his The Prithviwallahs. 

 Published by Roli Books, The Prithviwallahs tracks the history of Prithvi Theatres, the professional company set up by Prithviraj Kapoor in 1944, and the performing arts complex that Shashi Kapoor built years later with wife Jennifer in Mumbai. 

?I got the book in advance and read it at one go,? 

said Mrinal Sen, who formally unveiled The Prithviwallahs. ?But it had 

already been launched yesterday, when Shashi presented a copy to Bijoya Ray.?

 After the launch, a 10-minute audio-visual clip was screened, which captured the dramatic journey of the people involved with the theatre company and the complex. 

The guests ? including Victor Banerjee, Moon Moon 

Sen, Nabanita Dev Sen and Suhel Seth ? were treated to some rare photographs of 

Jennifer Kapoor playing Olivia in The Winter?s Tale, or a young Prithviraj 

being mobbed after a stage show.

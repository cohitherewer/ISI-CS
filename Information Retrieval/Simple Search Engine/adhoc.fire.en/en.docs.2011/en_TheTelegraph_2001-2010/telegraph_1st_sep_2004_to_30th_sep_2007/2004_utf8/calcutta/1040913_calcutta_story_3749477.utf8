 Tanker blaze toll up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The toll in Saturday?s tanker blaze rose to six on Sunday, with three persons succumbing to their burns in hospital. One of them was a woman.

 Two adults and a two-month-old baby died on the spot when the private tanker carrying diesel overturned and burst into flames on Saturday on National Highway 34, on the approach to Bally bridge. 

 Eleven persons sustained burns and were admitted to Uttarpara general hospital and Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. Sources said the condition of five was critical.

 The victims are Rohit Samanta (two months), Ashoke Jaiswal (45), Hiralal Shaw (35), Noorjahan Bibi (60), Biswajit Chowdhury (30) and Dinesh Paswan (28). Police said they lived in the roadside shanties on which the burning oil fell when the tanker overturned after hitting a pile of stone chips.

 Superintendent of police Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya said on Sunday that the bodies have been sent for post-mortem. The damaged tanker was towed to Bally police station. ?The driver and his help are yet to be traced,? he added. 

 Local MLA Kanika Ganguly, camping in the area since Saturday night, said on Sunday that those whose shanties were damaged in the fire are being shifted to the Bally municipality-run Chaitalpara primary school. ?We have made arrangements for over 60 people, who are being provided with food and clothing,? she added. 

 Howrah district magistrate S. Kishore spoke to Bally municipality chairman B. Saha about rebuilding the damaged shanties.

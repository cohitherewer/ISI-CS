Post-Sept. 11: Chaos 

and free-for-all ensue 

A mixed message from state government-backed quarters has thrown the cable industry into another chaos cauldron.

 Following a decree by two CPM bosses that broadcasters cannot switch off any channel for the next three months, a section of operators is back to the game of switching multi-system operators (MSOs) without clearing dues.

 This has left broadcasters seriously concerned about their payments at the end of this month and pondering business viability in Calcutta.

 Two CPM bigwigs had recently stepped in, supposedly on behalf of the state government, to sort out a cable mess. 

That included two spats involving broadcaster Zee-Turner, 

MSO RPG Netcom and Calcutta Communications (a unit of MSO SitiCable) affecting 

millions of city cable homes .

 On September 10, complying with ?requests? from the duo, truce was called among the warring parties and the channels restored to the networks within minutes of each other.

 On September 11, the two partymen mediated at a meeting of MSOs in a newspaper office, apparently to look for more concrete and long-term solutions. 

 Various issues were discussed, including cable operator migration, MSOs paying different rates for same set of channels, and under-declaration.

 It was while discussing the last point that the powers-that-be decided on a survey to determine the number of cable subscribers in the city. 

 The process, according to them, would take three months, and till then, a strict order was to be followed: no switchoffs by any broadcaster.

 As the message trickled down to the ground level, a free-for-all ensued. ?Certain MSOs are currently offering over 20 per cent discount on the monthly bill or asking for lower declaration to lure operators,? complained an MSO official. 

 And the defaulting operators are all too happy to bite the bait.

 ?Some operators and MSOs are always trying to avoid payment,? explained an industry veteran. ?The ?order? is being interpreted as the licence to do anything they please now.?

 Broadcasters are not amused. ?Some operators and MSOs are under the impression that even if they don?t pay, we cannot take a call because of the diktat,? said the city representative of an entertainment bouquet. 

 And with no word from the government ? officially or otherwise ? the chaos continues unchecked.

 One of the two CPM heavyweights is learnt to have clarified that broadcasters are free to take action to safeguard ?commercial considerations?.

 But business cannot be conducted on hearsay, argued another broadcaster.

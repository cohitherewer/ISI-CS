 Plod to sprint for treadmill

 - Limited outdoor exercise options push machine sales

 Potholed pavements, vanishing parks, rising pollution levels, late nights (hence, no early mornings) and even the fear of abduction?

 If the ubiquitous morning-walker is gradually becoming a rare breed in the city, blame it on these perils and more.

 Instead, Calcutta is fast becoming treadmill town, as the cardiovascular machine to walk or jog invades city homes. For the fitness equipment monitoring time, speed, distance, calories burnt, heart and pulse rates, what started as a slow trudge in 2003, has exploded into a full-blooded sprint as 2004 draws to a close.

 ?There are too many roadblocks to outdoor exercises these days and most people have extended working hours. So, getting up early and venturing out is often ruled out. The treadmill offers a viable alternative, where one can have a safe and effective workout in the confines of one?s home,? says Gagan Sachdev of Bodyline.

 The fitness equipment store on Ballygunge Circular Road sells around 300 machines every month and has recorded a 300 per cent growth since it opened in May, largely triggered by the treadmill rage.

 ?What people want these days is a simple cardiovascular exercise and the treadmill is the best tool for this. Internationally, treadmills account for 80 per cent of fitness equipment sold and Calcutta is now waking up to the multiple benefits of this versatile machine,? says Adeep Kapoor of G.K. Sports.

 The Kyd Street sports goods outlet sells 200-250 pieces every month, and along with Bodyline, controls ?85 per cent of the city?s treadmill market?. Kapoor feels the treadmill, which offers monitored and measurable exercise in a clean environment, is no longer ?an elite equipment?.

 Its usefulness is not lost on either Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission professor Pradip Bhattacharya, or paediatric cardiac surgeon Attawar Sandeep G. Both took home treadmills recently, realising the need for regular exercise. Others are doing the same, either to simply stay fit or to keep a check on diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol.

 According to cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar, exercising is essential to combat mental stress, the ?bad stress? causing acute imbalances in the body?s biochemical environment. ?But finding the time and a place to exercise is difficult in today?s scenario. The treadmill provides a graduated exercise regime and helps maintain a healthy calorie balance,? Sarkar says.

 Bodyline?s Sachdev, a wholesaler and importer as well, feels it?s also the feel-good factor working. ?Today?s youth parties hard and wants to stay in shape. Running on a motorised treadmill has become part of lifestyle,? he says, predicting that soon, most Calcuttans going for a treadmill will opt for motorised machines, which currently hold a 50 per cent market share. A high-end motorised treadmill could have a TV monitor, soft-touch screen, motion-control system and a cushion deck for soft impact.

 Cell-swipe gang of Bihar netted

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 An inter-state gang of cell phone-lifters was busted on Tuesday after a series of raids in central Calcutta.

 Twenty-four handsets, worth over Rs 1 lakh, were seized from their possession.

 According to police, the gang, based in Bihar?s Bhagalpur, operated over a wide area in West Bengal, from Sonarpur and Calcutta to Titagarh and Barrackpore. It also had networks in cities like Lucknow and Patna.

 ?All 11 members are from Bhagalpur. Pratap Mahato, 24, is the kingpin, and except for 41-year-old Jayabati Mahato, the rest are all between 12 and 18 years old,? said Atanu Ghoshal, officer-in-charge of Titagarh police station.

 ?We had been on the trail of this particular gang for quite a while, but were waiting to nab the kingpin red-handed,? said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Parveen Kumar.

 ?On Sunday, we had been tipped-off about one of the lifters and had followed him to a spot in Titagarh. The boy led us straight to the kingpin. During interrogation, Pratap revealed that the gang was being coordinated in Calcutta by Jayabati. The rest of the gang was then rounded up,? superintendent Kumar added.

 Pratap had set up his ?headquarters? in a rented room in Titagarh market, about 30 km from Calcutta, so that even if one or more of the lifters were netted in the city, the police wouldn?t be able to trace them back to him. 

 Jayabati, meanwhile, rented rooms in several guest houses in central Calcutta to lodge the gang members. 

 They would then hit the markets, both in Calcutta and in the suburbs, in teams of two or three. 

 Each team would first watch the movements of the victim from a distance. When he was busy bargaining in a shop, one of the lifters would lightly press a newspaper against the man?s pocket and pull out his handset. 

 The cell phone would immediately be passed on to a second team member, standing right behind the first. In case the victim became suspicious, the first member would draw attention away from the second, allowing him to make a clean getaway.

 At the end of the day, the lifters would hand over the booty to Pratap. After accumulating a specific number of handsets, Pratap would send them to Bhagalpur, where each set would be sold off for anything between Rs 500 and Rs 800.

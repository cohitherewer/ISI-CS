The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The art quartet

 Four of the citys promising young artists come together to showcase some of their best and latest works at the ongoing art exhibition, Exposition. The paintings on show reflect the artists responses to their environment, as well as articulating their personal philosophy of life. The paintings of Subhasis Bhattacharyya represent the growing restlessness of the artist who feels helpless and insecure in the face of violence and crime. Inspired by folk and tribal art, the sensitive yet vibrant coloured textures of Pranay Paul depict a spontaneous harmony between nature and life. While Sujay Das (whose On Different Planes appears alongside) recreates simple yet deceptive geometric figures and shapes to generate an illusion of three-dimensional space in his paintings, the canvases of Sanjay Das build superb optical drama through a masterful use of colour, forms and their arrangement in a particular pattern.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by four artists

 When: Till September 26; 3 pm - 8 pm

 Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery

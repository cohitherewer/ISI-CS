 Living tale of a legend

No matter how many times they stage Charandas Chor, 

Calcutta just keeps craving for more from the Bhopal-based Naya Theatre. And on 

each of their trips, the city looks forward to Habib Tanvir and his rural artistes 

from Chhattisgarh bringing home an earthy rusticity. 

 In town to wrap up Nandikar?s National Theatre Festival with three plays, Habib Tanvir dropped in at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre on Thursday evening, with wife Monica and daughter Nageen, to launch his work of fiction, The Living Tale of Hirma.

 The other, closer-to-heart, reason was catching up on a documentary on him and Naya Theatre made by Sudhanva Deshpande and Sanjay Maharishi. The 73-minute Gaon Ke Naon Theatre, Mor Naon Habib explores some fascinating facets of the thespian. The film-maker duo tailed Habib Tanvir and his actors on and off to shoot some rare footage of the backstage action and rehearsals, and capture a life on the move. 

 ?As a director, I spot talent and groom them. I inject my ideas imperceptibly into the actors and let them improvise. But often, my biggest challenge is the lack of ambition among the rural people,? said Habib Tanvir, in a long chat with the audience.

 Having trained in theatrics in London and Berlin, Habib Tanvir founded Naya Theatre with rural artistes of the traditional nacha form of Chhattisgarh in 1959. Since then, the troupe has been touring the country and abroad with a rich repertoire of plays in Hindi, Chhattisgarhi and Urdu, essentially using Chhattisgarhi music, dance and folk forms.

 ?In the initial years, I would direct and guide the actors on my lines and it was very frustrating. Then I gave them the autonomy of their mother tongue and they got back their strength. So, I had to practically unlearn whatever I had picked up,? said the 80-plus stage legend, who ?learnt a lot? under the direction of Balraj Sahni and Dina Pathak.

 ?If you happen not to be able to read and write, your other senses become sharp. While adapting A Midsummer Night?s Dream to Kamdev Ka Apna, Basant Ritu Ka Sapna for the illiterate actors, I would read out a scene to them, allocate the roles and ask them to improvise,? said Habib Tanvir.

 ?But the Chhattisgarhi actors know how to sing and dance very well and have a certain sense of satire and humour which is rare,? explained Monica Tanvir, a theatre artiste and director herself. ?Habib was very patient with them and I also learnt not to interfere.?

 At Academy of Fine Arts on Saturday, Naya Theatre staged Kamdev Ka Apna?, Charandas Chor and Zahreeli Hawa.

Sound of music success

 There?s a nip in the air at last, the mood is mellow and music can only add to the carnival spirit. As the year draws to a close and Calcutta slips into festive fervour, there?s heightened activity at the music stores. A large part of sales is driven by Yuletide, and Christmas carols are hot.

 Compilation CDs like Joy To The World and Christmas Magic are fast vanishing off MusicWorld and Landmark racks. ?Indian classical also moves well during this period. Three artistes in great demand are Pandit Jasraj, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi and Ustad Zakir Hussain,? says Lalita Sinha, regional manager, MusicWorld.

 The Park Street mega store has already sold nine lakh cassettes, CDs, VCDs and DVDs compared to seven lakh in the previous year. According to the MusicWorld spokesperson, 2004 sales are expected to cross Rs 11 crore, compared to Rs 9 crore in 2003. The store is targeting Rs 1 crore-plus sales this December. For the fourth year running, MusicWorld Park Street has retained its position as the largest-selling store in the chain. ?Last year, on Christmas, we had 10,000 visitors. This year, we expect an even bigger crowd. Last year, on an all-India basis, MusicWorld sales on Christmas touched Rs 31 lakh, with Park Street contributing Rs 5 lakh,? says Sinha.

 Carols and Christmas-related music like A Very Special Christmas Vol. II, besides perennial favourites like Boney M and Frank Sinatra are moving well at Landmark. ?Babydoll, Adnan Sami?s remix album and Veer-Zaara are also hot now,? says Gautam Jatia, CEO of the Lord Sinha Road store.

 Veer-Zaara is also among the favourites at Crossword. The other titles moving well are soundtracks of Swades, Kisna, Raincoat and Mughal-e-Azam, besides Enrique?s Asia Tour album. ?Albums like Double Dance Remix, Parwaaz (Jagjit Singh live in Singapore), Blazing Drums and Have I Told You Lately have done extremely well in recent months,? says Sidharth Pansari, head of the Elgin Road store.

 ?Party numbers are the biggest draw at this time,? feels Debraj Dutta, a veteran in music merchandising in the city, now with Prime Music. The large number of NRIs in town during this time also boosts music sales, he adds.

She?s got the look: Soha Ali Khan is here 

to stay

Debut film: Iti Srikanta. Second venture: Dil 

Maange More. Third project: Antarmahal. Total tally: two Tollywood, 

one Bollywood. When belles from Bengal are all flying to the western coast (Bipasha, 

Celina, Koena, Rimii...), this Delhi-bred daughter of Sharmila Tagore has dared 

to shift into reverse gear. Her willingness to vault the language barrier without 

batting a pretty eyelash and dazzle us with that smile makes Soha Ali Khan our 

fresh face of the year.

 There?s a celluloid storm waiting to hit Calcutta this winter ? Mumbai?s Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s Parineeta, New York-based Mira Nair?s The Namesake, and non-resident Bengali Raj Kaushal Chatterjee?s No Poblem.

 That, believe it or not, is what Mandira Bedi?s husband has decided to call his first foray into Bangla cinema.

 ?It is more of a Benglish film with a liberal sprinkling of English dialogues and will be the first of my quadrology on the four Indian metros and four colours of the Indian flag,? the film-maker told Metro, when contacted in Mumbai.

 Mandira, who played the leading lady in Raj?s last release Shaadi Ka Laddoo, will do nothing extraaa for hubby dear this time than a fleeting cameo. ?I will come to Calcutta to be with him (Raj) for a couple of days and yes, maybe do a small little role.? 

 And how Bengali is her man? ?He is more Punjabi. He prefers his chicken tandoori to his fish curry. But No Poblem will be a sort of return to roots for him.?

 Raj, who is also co-producing the film with Vicky Tejwani, had come to the city in September for the pre-production recce. ?The target audience for No Poblem would be all the Bengalis in India,? said Tejwani.

 To be shot in a start-to-finish 15-day schedule in December, No Poblem is a comedy about three couples and their experiences on one particular night. 

 While the actor for the male lead is yet to be decided, Raj has gone for Tolly?s telly stars (yet undisclosed) for the majority of the remaining cast.

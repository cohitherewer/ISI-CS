 What?s in, what?s out? What?s cool, what?s cold? These are the questions dominating every dressing room this festive fortnight.

 Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh is clear about this Christmas? craving: ?Leather is completely in right now, be it as jackets, trousers or shirts. And the more years you?ve had them, the better. Ponchos are another interesting option this season, but finding one with the right length is essential. On the colours front, any hue of green is a must!?

?Low-slung belts in every shape and size are another 

must-have, while white (not grey!) jeans are looking great at the moment. To complete 

the season?s styles, boots have certainly made yet another comeback and interesting 

styles should be opted for.? 

Mix ?n? match 

 Practical people will splurge on a great pair of trousers or an elegant skirt, as opposed to a dress they can wear just a couple of times. With ponchos running the rounds of the fashion circuit, the city?s racks are flooded.

 At Little India on Elgin Road, you can find chiffon ponchos in a variety of colours with minimal embellishments priced at Rs 1,050, while Kyra in Hotel Hindustan International has some stylish ones in black, scarlet red, fuchsia pink and peacock blue. These are priced a bit higher, between Rs 1,250 and Rs 3,950. Westside at 22, Camac Street also has colourful ponchos in blues, pinks and earthy shades priced at Rs 799.

 Stores like Shock, Options and Stylesmith at Metro Plaza have some colourful blouses with beads, sequins and fancy slits that are priced between Rs 395 and Rs 700. For those eyeing a lower price bar, Fashion Folks on Wood Street has some snazzy tops, denims and striped trousers in the Rs 250-Rs 700 bracket.

Skirts, too, are here, there and everywhere, in diverse 

shapes, sizes, cuts, lengths and fits. Priyanjali Ray?s outlet at 5, Alipore Park 

Road has a range of camisoles with embellishments, while the skirts, mostly in 

black, have options of a back, side or front slit. Prices start at Rs 800. 

Dressing up 

 ?Calcuttans, by and large, believe in the mix-and-match concept of dressing up, normally sticking to skirts and trousers to go with tops. It?s only at this time of the year that people seem to get a wake-up call for dresses and the demand for them shoots up,? says designer Komal Sood.

 At Komal?s store Kyra, you can find a variety of dresses in black lycra, be it sleeveless or spaghetti strapped. Some also have certain embellishments, in the form of embroidery, sequins or beads and are styled as silhouettes. These are priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 3,950.

 For those with a feel for the flashy, Shoppers? Stop has a range of sequinned georgette dresses for Rs 1,195. For those who prefer dresses in a single colour with minimal embellishment, Bizarre has a host of short, knee-length and long dresses in halters, straps and even off-shoulders. Priced between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,500, these are designs that are bound to remain stylish even after the party boom plays out.

For the brand-conscious buyer, Be: and Little India 

have a variety of designer dresses in lycra, silk and chiffon under the labels 

of Suneet Verma, Priyadarshini Rao and Pink. Priced at Rs 2,000 and far more, 

these can be found in shades of green, fuchsia pink and black.

Ethnic effect

 Fusion clothing or Indo-western styles seem to be an attractive option for many, with Indian prints, embroidery, beads and other embellishments also giving off the ethnic feel.

 At Megha Modi?s store in Forum, there are a variety of interesting skirts and tops that can be mixed and matched. In shades of green, red and black, there?s a lot of choice. 

 At 1, Allenby (opposite Forum), designer Usha Bagri has her own collection of Indo-western ensembles. Long skirts with matching blouses, simple metallic embellishments and embroidery can be found here. The prices at both places rise above the Rs 1,000 mark. ?The fusion look is very in right now and ethnic sets of a skirt and blouse are hot,? says designer Usha Bagri.

Ogaan on Southern Avenue has an exquisite range of 

Indo-western skirts designed by Kavita Khaitan, starting at Rs 3,000.

 Add-ons

 ?A world without accessories makes fashion boring. When I plan my outfit, I don?t usually pre-plan these extras, but I know that without them, any look would seem incomplete. A chic pair of earrings can highlight your face, while bags enhance an outfit and shoes make your legs look so much nicer,? says actress Raima Sen.

 No winter wardrobe can be complete without the right footwear for the right outfit. Priyanjali Ray?s outlet has classy footwear in suedes, raw silk and linen, and with heels starting from the trim two-and-a-half-inch mark to even the five-and-a-half-inch mark.

 Inc 5?s range of shoes at Regal in the Oberoi Grand Arcade also has a huge variety, priced between Rs 800 and Rs 1,600. Footsie and Foottrap in Metro Plaza have some smart pairs of party shoes and sequinned nagras, pegged at anything between Rs 150 and Rs 250.

 For those in love with the shimmer of jewels but a fear of the price tag, New Market has a great range of chunky, simply, ethnic and westernised costume jewellery that can go with any outfit. In a variety of colours, shapes and sizes, you?re bound to find something to suit your taste here, for just Rs 25.

 Then there?s Nik Nish at 22 Camac Street with sparkles in vibrant colours and designs, priced between Rs 30 and Rs 300. At 1, Allenby, a range of glamorous bags with stylish handles and embroidered artistry can round off your shopping spree. The bag bill: between Rs 600 and Rs 1,400. For a tighter budget, colourful totes can be picked up for Rs 300 from Leatherworld .

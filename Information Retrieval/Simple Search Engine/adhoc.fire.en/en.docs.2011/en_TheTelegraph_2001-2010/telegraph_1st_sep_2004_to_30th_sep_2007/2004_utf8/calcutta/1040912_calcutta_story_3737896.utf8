The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

All that jazz about gas

What petrol do you use, sir? Ummm, errr, grrr 

How relevant is the label when it comes to this daily need?

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

I 

start writing this week?s column after managing to avert a fairly major crisis. 

It all started in the morning. My car was pretty low on gas. Somehow I had missed 

the news about the oil tanker strike. This morning?s paper screamed at me. I hurriedly 

drove to my friendly neighbourhood petrol pump. Alas, I was 12 hours too late. 

They had run out of all petrol, premium and ordinary, last night. Eventually, 

on the seventh attempt, I found a gas station that was still in business. I filled 

up my tank and drove to work.

It is then that I remembered the Yuvraj Singh (picture 

above) ad. The one in which he is driving around with a pretty young thing and 

stops at a gas station for directions. The attendant tells them that the direction 

would depend on the brand of petrol they are using. If Yuvraj?s car was running 

on a particular brand of petrol then he should take a route, long and circuitous. 

The idea was to give the couple more legitimate driving time together. That was 

possible, the ad was trying to imply, because the advertised brand gave much better 

mileage. Our man at the gas station then proceeds to tell the couple that if they 

are not using the brand then the building they are looking for is the one just 

opposite the gas station.

In a crisis ? as it was for me a few hours earlier 

? brand choice obviously takes a back seat. Yet, a couple of things struck me. 

I do not remember the brand of petrol I took in my car from the seventh petrol 

pump. Nor do I remember the company that sells the brand. I was worried about 

my failing memory. The next point was even more alarming. I could not recall the 

brand of petrol that my very own friendly neighbourhood petrol pump sells. Honestly, 

I cannot even tell you whether it sells Indian Oil or Bharat Petroleum. I promised 

to see my doctor as soon as I could.

In the meanwhile, this column had to be sent. In all 

fairness to the few who waste their time reading my column, I thought I must at 

least mention the brand of petrol in the Yuvraj ad. That is easy, I thought. I 

walked into my young colleague?s office next to mine. He is a laptop-using 100+ 

cc motorbike rider. I asked him which brand of petrol he uses. He said AAEI. I 

asked him whether he had seen the Yuvraj Singh ad in a petrol station. He said 

he had. Encouraged, I asked him if he remembered which brand it was for. He said 

TVS Centra.

I, however, was still worried about my memory. How 

could it be that I do not remember these simple things; something must be wrong. 

Fortunately, the doctor had a free slot in the afternoon. I reached on time. The 

doctor asked me what the problem was. As usual, he gave me a patient hearing. 

After which he looked visibly worried. I thought I must have exhibited symptoms 

of serious psychological disorder. The doctor was brooding. He suddenly rang the 

bell and asked for his driver. I said to myself, goodness, he is going to drive 

me to a nursing home for an immediate brain surgery.

The driver entered the doctor?s chamber. I stood up 

to go. The doctor looked nervous. He glanced at me and asked the driver: ?Amra 

roj shokale hashpatale jabar shomoy kon petrol ta ni (What brand of petrol 

do we take every morning)?? The driver said: ?Phoolbaganer morer (The one 

at the Phoolbagan crossing).?

I drove back to office to meet my deadline.

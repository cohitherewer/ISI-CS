 Complaint forms at fingertips

Soham Chakrabarty: There have been instances of passengers themselves having to stop a vehicle and bring the errant driver to the sergeant. 

 You need not argue or fight with the driver if a bus, taxi or an autorickshaw is violating traffic rules. We need people to keep tabs on these offenders. As we have only 250 sergeants and few times more the number of constables to look after nearly 14,000 autorickshaws and an equal number of private buses, it is not possible physically to notice every offender. You can seek redress in three ways: 

 You can call up our special control room in the numbers 1073 (BSNL), 98308 11111 or 98300 10000 and seek assistance. In case the driver or the conductor of the bus is misbehaving, you can immediately lodge a complaint with the officer on that number. If you are in a moving vehicle, tell us about your location so that we, in turn, will pass the message to the nearest officer on duty and get the vehicle booked.

 Secondly, you can lodge a complaint after getting off the vehicle, too. Just remember to note down the vehicle number the and time and place of the incident. You can also visit our website (www.calcuttatrafficpolice.org) and lodge a complaint in a formatted file. You can do this even without disclosing your identity. But if you put your name and contact details, it becomes easier for us to book the offender. In case you want to keep your identity confidential, mention it there.

 And thirdly, not many people are aware that every sergeant or traffic constable on duty carries with him complaint cards. If you want to complain about a vehicle, ask for one such card from the nearest sergeant or constable and fill it up. You may post it to us or hand it over to the officer on duty. Your complaint number is displayed on our website. You need not to pay anything for this, except the postage in case you send it by post.

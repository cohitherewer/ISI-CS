The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Foxed over docs-to-be

 KINSUK BASU 

 The struggle seems endless. Both for the students and the health department mandarins.

 After accommodating the 69-odd students ? selected on Saturday for this year?s MBBS course against those admitted in the NRI quota ? the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is at a loss to ensure that the students don?t lose out on a year of their career. 

 On Sunday, hours before the students went for their classes, the mandarins, including director of health services C.R. Maiti and principal of the Calcutta Medical College Jayshree Mitra, held a series of meetings at Swasthya Bhavan to find a solution while working out the modalities of their admission and exam procedures. 

 To begin with, as health department insiders put it, these students will have to catch up with their classmates on the three pre-clinical subjects ? anatomy, biochemistry and physiology ? if they are to take the first semester exam, scheduled for January 6. 

 As if that is not difficult enough, they will have to appear for the first professional MBBS exam as well, scheduled for July-end, with the requisite attendance percentage. 

 According to Medical Council of India guidelines, at least 75 per cent attendance is required before one takes this exam and with only seven months to go, teachers feel this is almost impossible. 

 Even the students, who have been confident so far, are suddenly clueless. 

 Amidst preparations for attending classes ? at SSKM and the Midnapore Medical College ? from Monday, they have many queries but nobody to answer those.

 ?It is still not clear to us how we can attend classes with those who are already way ahead of us. It?s not a few weeks but months, and one can?t be expected to catch up,? said a candidate from Barrackpore.

 Teachers of the respective colleges, however, have been asked to go ahead at the usual pace, keeping the January 6 deadline in mind. 

 ?There are two semester exams leading to the first professional MBBS exam and it is mandatory for all to clear it. As per the guidelines, the entire process of holding the semester and the first professional exams will have to be wrapped up within 12 months,? said Prabir Sur, director of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM. 

 ?The curriculum has to be completed within nine-and-a-half to 10 months, and teachers have been advised accordingly,? he signed off.

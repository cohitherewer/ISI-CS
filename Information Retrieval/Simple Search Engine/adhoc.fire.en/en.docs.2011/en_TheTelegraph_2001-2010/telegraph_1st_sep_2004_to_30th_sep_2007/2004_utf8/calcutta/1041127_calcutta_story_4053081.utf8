The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flyover duo set to debut

 OUR BUREAU

 The Calcuttan?s run on the fast track will be accelerated further in the first week of December, when two more flyovers will be opened to motorists.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will inaugurate both ? the Lake Gardens flyover on December 2 and the one in Howrah?s Mourigram on December 7.

 ?The Mourigram flyover is complete, while approach roads to the Lake Gardens flyover are being touched up. The entire work is expected to be over by the time the two are inaugurated,? public works department (PWD) minister Amar Choudhury said on Friday.

 Work on both high roads were delayed inordinately. 

 ?The Lake Gardens flyover was delayed because of land acquisition problems. A studio owned by the information and cultural affairs department and a few Food Corporation of India godowns had to be relocated,? explained a senior official. 

 He added: ?All the hitches could be removed only because the chief minister had made it clear that he wanted the projects to be executed without any delay.?

 The flyover will connect Southern Avenue (Lake Club) to the Prince Anwar Shah Road crossing. It will help reduce congestion on the Dhakuria-Gol Park-Gariahat stretch, as vehicles from the Jadavpur-Garia side will take the flyover en route to Southern Avenue and SP Mukherjee Road. About 300 metres of new road are being laid to connect Prince Anwar Shah Road with the flyover. 

 One flank on Deodar Rahman Street will merge into the flyover to help residents of Lake Gardens move on to it. 

 ?We?re ensuring that vehicles start plying on the flyover on the same day it is inaugurated. Work is progressing round-the-clock to ready the new roads and the necessary installations in the next seven days,? minister Choudhury informed mediapersons. 

 Work on the 800-metre Mourigram flyover was scheduled to be inaugurated in November, but the PWD was waiting ?for the chief minister to find time out of his busy schedule? to inaugurate it. 

 Supposed to be ready in just 30 months, the flyover took over six years to be completed. ?There were too many issues involved. We had to work with the railways and there was a funds crunch, too,? said PWD minister. 

 The flyover, connecting National Highway 6 to Vidyasagar Setu, will have a four-feet wide footpath on either side. ?The entire flyover is ready and vehicles can start plying on it any day,? an official said.

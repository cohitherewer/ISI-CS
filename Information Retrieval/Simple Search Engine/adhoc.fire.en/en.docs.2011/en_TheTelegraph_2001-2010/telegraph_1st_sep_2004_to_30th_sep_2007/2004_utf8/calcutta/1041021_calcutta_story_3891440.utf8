The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dance till dawn to tunes traditional and techno

Matching stick for stick, Navratri nights are giving colourful competition to pandal hotspots during these festive times. The festival synonymous with colourful costumes and dandy dandiya moves may have come a long way from being a cosy community affair to nine non-stop night-outs replete with high-octane DJ music culminating in the grand celebrations on Dussehra. But the garb and the gaiety are as infectious as ever.

 What used to be small roof-top affairs among the Gujarati community now encompasses all sections of the Indian diaspora, spilling over on to huge stadium grounds and even discos. Folk singers have given way to high-profile visitors from Mumbai and the traditional dholi and shehnai players have lost out to DJs and disco beats. Yet, the spirit of the festival has remained in place.

All this week and beyond, come evening and there is 

a mad rush to make it to the venue (remember Riya Sen and her torn sari in Falguni 

Pathak?s Chudi Jo Khanki...).

 Girls in their lehnga-cholis and boys in their kediyas and kurtas try to match footsteps and display their expertise with the dandiya sticks. Here?s checking out a few high-pitched dandiyas around town:

 Salt Lake

 Check-in time: 8 pm

Twirl to the beats of tradition at the Salt Lake stadium 

helipad ground. With space to pack in 10,000 people, the palatial playground has 

been witnessing a footfall of anything between 4,000 and 5,000 every evening.

 ?We celebrate the festival by following customs of the community. This year, too, we have constructed a makeshift temple inside the venue and kick-started the festivities with an aarti. For us this is not a commercial operation but a festival which is celebrated with a lot of zeal,? said Girish Raj, general secretary of Payal, the group behind the event.

 Forget about some fun on the sly, the organisers don?t even allow slippers on the dance floor and non-vegetarian food is a strict no-no. ?We do not invite celebrities and DJs to our event. We have a live band which is playing the traditional notes and a few singers from Gujarat who have been brought in to add the folk feel,? says Girish.

 But those with two left wrists need not worry. If the dance floor is not your haunt, make the food stalls your fiefdom. Besides the dhoklas and the theplas, you have a choice between pav-bhaji, dosas, idlis and ice-creams also.

 Swabhumi

 Check-in time: 6 pm

 Tomar dekha nai re, Mon amar kemon kemon kore and the all-too familiar roll of the dhaak... Not the scenes (or scores) from a Puja pandal but some of the tracks that are keeping the crowd at Swabhumi on its feet.

 ?We have a considerable number of Bengalis dropping in every night to try their hands at the dandiya. I decided to play a number of Bengali songs to make them feel at home,? says DJ Ravi, who has also been playing songs like Chunri chunri, Bhumro bhumro and his own remix version of Oye oye (a superhit of the 90s), also. 

 With Bengalis gripped by the garba fever, pampering their tastebuds has also been taken care of. Besides the usual dosas, idlis, dhoklas, pav-bhaji, chana masala and chaats there is chicken kebab and tandoori fish tikka, too.

 Crowds to the tune of 2,500 are thronging the three venues ? Urban Courtyard, Rang Durbar and Rang Manch. The entry fee is Rs 150.

 RCGC

 Check-in time: 7.30 pm

The K-serials not only rule the tube but also have 

a presence on the dance floors. We got a proof on Sashti night at the RCGC Tee 

Lawn, venue for the dandiya, when small screen star Ronit Roy took the 

stage for a jig.

 The sticks came to a standstill as shooting queries about his characters in Kyunki? and Kasautii... took centre stage. Not to be outdone, the one-film wonder insisted on showing off his singing prowess with not one, not two, but three numbers.

 The fun and frolic continued almost till the first early-morning golfer was to tee-off, with no less than 900 party people having a blast. The food code was strictly vegetarian and couples-only was the social call.

All that it took for an individual to reach the 8,000 

sq. ft dandiya floor was Rs 125.

 And there were takers for that aplenty. The venue registered footfall of 1,600 on Tuesday, the first night of festivities at the Royal.

 ?I decided to kick off the event on Tuesday because the Puja holidays start from Wednesday and we are anticipating a good response. We have roped in Keyur Mehta who is known as the dandiya king of Calcutta to play some traditional Gujarati folk music. DJ Akash is doing his bit for Hindi music buffs, churning out tracks like Chandu ke cha cha ne...,? says Avinash Singhania of Encore, the group behind the event.

 The Park

 Check-in time: 6.30 pm. 

The garba gathering kicked off on Saptami at 

the Park Banquets and Sangam Hall. Organised by The Lions Club and The Interact 

District Council, there is a heavy dose of Bollywood here. While the food at Sangam 

would be pure vegetarian Gujarati, the chaat-chowmein-north Indian delicacies 

will make up the menu at The Banquets.

 The entry fee is Rs 200, the the dress code relaxed.

 Ocio

 Check-in time: 7.30 pm. 

The festivities at the city?s first leisureplex began 

in the 6,000 sq. ft Banquet hall on Wednesday. DJ Harish and DJ Sheikh from Dublin 

have been specially roped in to play at the extravaganza. Expect a good amount 

of disco and funk music beside the regular dandiya numbers. The food court 

is serving a whole range of light bites. The entry fee is Rs 300.

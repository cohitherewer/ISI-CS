The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Thanks to the swelling population and our enthusiasm for celebrating festivals, 

more and more Durga pujas are held in Calcutta and its suburbs every year. As 

such, the demand for the clay idols has also increased. But it is very disheartening 

to find that the lives of the artisans at Kumartuli remains bleak as ever. They 

still work in cramped makeshift studios with little infrastructure to save them 

and their work from the showers and waterlogging. With continuous rain for the 

past few days, chances are they will miss the date of completion of the idols. 

Buyers may cancel their orders as a result. Authorities should come forward to 

support these clay-modellers. Only then can the artisans succeed in pushing their 

products better, both in the domestic and the foreign markets. 

 Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park. 

 Kalyani is an important railway station under the Sealdah division. Of late, 

this station has earned a notorious name thanks to rampant sale of illicit liquor 

from small shanties scattered around the station. Youngsters may get drawn into 

the trap and take to the bottle. I request the divisional railway manager, Sealdah, 

to look into the matter.

 Trams are a boon to the elderly people in the city. But nowadays the aged passengers 

face a lot of discomfort as tramcars get derailed very often during rush hours. 

This is because the tracks are not well-maintained. While most passengers have 

the option to get off and take another mode of transport, the elderly are at a 

loss. The tracks on Chitpur Road, College Street and BB Ganguly Street need immediate 

repairs. Tramcars get derailed frequently on these stretches. The Calcutta Tramways 

Company should repair the tracks at the earliest. 

 Dalim Kumar Datta, APC Road. 

 Hundreds of oil tankers ply along Budge Budge Trunk Road every day. The heavy 

vehicles have already damaged the road severely. Add to it, the way Calcutta Municipal 

Corporation has dug up the road to lay underground water pipes. It has not bothered 

to repair the road where it has completed work. No wonder, Budge Budge Trunk Road 

is dotted with slushy, muddy potholes. Commuters find it extremely difficult to 

travel on the road on a regular basis. The last time that repairs were taken up 

on the road was six years ago. So, it badly needs a thorough overhaul to give 

a respite to residents of the area. It will also save the vehicles plying on the 

road from further damage. Will the transport minister come to our aid?

 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.

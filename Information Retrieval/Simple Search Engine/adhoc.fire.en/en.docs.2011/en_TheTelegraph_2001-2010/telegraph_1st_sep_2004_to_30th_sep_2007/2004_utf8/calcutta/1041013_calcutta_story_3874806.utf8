Interim bail for last ritess

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The Howrah district and sessions court was the scene of an uproar on Tuesday, before Manjusha Mukherjee and son Jyotirmoy were granted interim bail. The two have been in Presidency jail since last month in connection with the murder of 18-year-old Kuntal Sain. 

 Manjusha?s elder son Sampad, prime accused in the murder, died in the jail on Sunday. The bail was sought to enable Manjusha and Jyotirmoy to perform Sampad?s last rites. 

 While lawyer Sujit Chatterjee and five others were moving the bail plea around 1 pm, Kuntal?s uncle Surajit Sain threatened the defence team with dire consequences. 

 The lawyers protested and lodged a complaint with the judge. Pandemonium ensued, as counsel on both sides started abusing one another. Judge Shyamal Chakraborty adjourned the proceedings.

 The court resumed an hour later and Manjusha and her son were granted interim bail till November 22. A copy of the order was sent to the sub-divisional judicial magistrate, who forwarded it to Presidency jail. 

 Public prosecutor Chinmoy Chowdhury denied reports about the chaos in court. He opposed the bail prayer on the grounds that the lives of the two would be in danger if they came out of the jail. 

 Rights panel probe: The West Bengal Human Rights Commission on Tuesday asked additional director-general of police (human rights) K.K. Das to probe Sampad?s death. ?The inquiry will be over in four weeks,? said panel chairman Justice (retd) Shyamal Sen.

 Calcutta it is a? changing, and changing very fast. With ?work hard by day and party harder by night? becoming the mantra of this metro, the hospitality industry has gone into overdrive.

 Revamp and rev up is the name of the game. Case in present point: Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) rolling out plans of a major makeover. The aim is to give the AJC Bose Road address a vibrant new look to attract GenX, even while retaining its grip on the not-so-young base.

 The revamp, part of which has already begun, will take place in two phases. The start is with a facelift, literally. ?We will be changing the facade of the HHI, thus giving the hotel a new frontal look,? announced D.K. Jaiswal, managing director of the hotel.

 Soon, the rather plain white building will give way to a brightly-lit structure, good enough to illuminate that stretch of road under the gargantuan flyover.

 The facelift done, the next step will be to refurbish at least a 100 rooms spread over the 6th, 7th and 8th floors. A personal valet will be added to rooms on the 8th floor.

 In keeping with the increasing demand for banquet space in town, an entire floor is being dedicated for that purpose. The 12,500-sq-ft banqueting facilities spread over six halls comprising Topaz, Silver Tulip, Senate 1, Senate 2 and the Boardroom have been fully renovated.

 ?We?ve also started a 100 per cent vegetarian kitchen to cater to marriages with an all-vegetarian menu,? said the HHI executive chef Utpal Mandal.

 The food front, in fact, boasts the biggest changes. The first comes in the form of a new menu at Kalash, the Indian restaurant.

 The interiors have been done up tastefully with beige furniture and new crockery and cutlery, and the menu contains a mix of Indian and global food that is a must check out for any foodie worth his salt.

 From the rich cuisine of the Lucknow gharana to a throwback to a platter from purano Calcutta, the chef has a whipped up a whole range of yummy delights. 

 ?To cater to the tastes of the new generation that is exposed to good food, a new menu with interesting items is a must,? explained Mandal.

 Another step further in this direction would be the launch of the new lounge bar next month that would stir up an exclusive Italian and Mexican menu. ?This is going to be the fine dining destination and will surely be a great experience for Calcuttans,? claimed Mandal.

 Biryani bites

 If you think you?re not pampered enough when you step out to eat, dropping in at Indus Valley, at 53, Syed Amir Ali Avenue, wouldn?t be a bad idea. The food, at least, will make you feel like royalty.

 After the roaring success of the haleem festival, the restaurant is back with more. This time round, it is a more elaborate fare comprising various kinds of biryani and chaap. 

 The mutton fan club can try out the Nizam-e-Biryani and the Sultanat-e-Biryani. Then there is Mumtaz-e-Biryani and Begum Bahar Chaap for those who want to give red meat a miss. Vegetarians, however, would have to make do with Rajputana Biryani alone. All this can be washed down with Ruhafza sherbet and Mehtabi Firni. And then walk out munching on a meetha paan.

 Biryani, salad, raita, firni, paan and sherbet would cost you Rs 150. For the same price, you can choose the combo containing chaap, lachha paratha, firni, raita, sherbet and paan.

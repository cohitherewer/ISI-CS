 You share your birthday with...

 Dilip Kumar 

You are enthusiastic, perceptive and a quick learner. You are not afraid to question authority, and can rebel if restricted. You are attached to your friends. You never take advantage of people. Though you?re a little eccentric, you live by your word and promises. ? Kusum Bhandari

 Patients fall into NGO net

 - Victims 

allege police apathy 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Some city NGOs are allegedly taking terminally-ill patients in need of financial help for a ride, and the police do not seem to care.

 Wasim Islam, a cobbler from Titagarh, had first-hand experience of police apathy when he approached Titagarh police station on Saturday to lodge a complaint against an NGO. 

 His complaint was a serious one: Disha Welfare Society, an NGO, had raised a tidy sum for the treatment of his terminally ill son, but did not give him a single rupee.

 He was asked by the Titagarh policemen to file his complaint with Belgharia government railway police (GRP). The Belgharia police asked him to go to the Dum Dum GRP, where, in turn, he was directed to Belgharia police station. 

 By the time Islam reached Sinthee police station on Sunday morning, following the directions of Belgharia police, his son, whom he was carrying with him, had started bleeding. He gave up. 

 Indrajit Saha, secretary of Disha Welfare Society, denied the allegation. ?Some NGO might be misusing our name. We do not know any Wasim Islam,? he said. 

 When contacted, Arindam Manna, officer-in-charge of Belgharia GRP, said they had refused to register the case as it did not fall under their jurisdiction.

 There are several others like Islam who have been taken for a ride by NGOs. 

 Madhab Manna, husband of 25-year-old cancer patient Pratima, alleged that several NGOs were collecting funds in the name of ailing persons but siphoning off the lion?s share. ?We have lodged complaints with police to no avail,? he alleged.

 Manna said that members of fraudulent NGOs locate critically ill patients at the outdoor clinics of hospitals and offer help. Later, when their malpractice is brought to light, they even hire goons to ensure that the victims keep their mouth shut. 

 Government officials, including Manik Sil, a CPM local committee member of East Jadavpur, and Utpal Sanyal, a cancer specialist attached to Chittaranjan Cancer Hospital, have also been taken for a ride by NGOs. 

 Sil told Metro that an NGO headed by Pooja Pal had collected money from patients using his name and address. ?Pal, who heads Barisha Aastha Sammilani, was my tenant. She printed my phone number on her business card without my permission,? Sil alleged.

 ?We have heard that Pooja Pal has moved from our jurisdiction to that of Lake police station,? said Anjan Ganguly, officer-in-charge of East Jadavpur police station.

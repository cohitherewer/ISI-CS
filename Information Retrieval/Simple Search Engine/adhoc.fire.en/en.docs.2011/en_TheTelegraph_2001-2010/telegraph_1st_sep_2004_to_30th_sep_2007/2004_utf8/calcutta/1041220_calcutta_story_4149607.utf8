The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Efficiency boosters in 3-day showcase

 - Global 

tech for garment trade 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Garment manufacturers in the state will get an opportunity to give their business the technological edge with GARKNIT X ? Garment Knitting International Technology Xhibition ? making a stopover in Calcutta for the first time from Friday.

 ?It is amazing the way the scenario is changing in Calcutta. The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee-led Left Front government seems determined to boost business in West Bengal, and we, therefore, had no hesitation in choosing Calcutta as the venue for this unique international exhibition,? explained B.P. Mishra, chief executive officer of Xhibition and Konferances India, organisers of the event.

 Companies from various parts of the world, including Italy, China, Japan, Germany, USA, Korea and Taiwan, along with national players, will display the latest machines that raise efficiency of production at a low cost at the exhibition in Science City.

 The venue is undergoing a transformation for the three-day event.

 ?We will have makeshift inter-continental restaurants, world-class stationery stores, a classy business centre and a special trade desk. There will also be facilities for foreign exchange,? Mishra explained.

 According to him, the city?s phenomenal contribution to the domestic market for kidswear can improve further, and the same applies for sectors such as silk export, which is also growing steadily. 

 The garments market in Calcutta is in the range of Rs 500-600 crore, the lion?s share being the kidswear market, pegged at nearly Rs 300 crore, the highest in India. 

 ?These are all modest figures, since there are over 3,000 family units in Metiabruz and another 1,500 units in Bankra manufacturing garments. These units do not have a regulatory body. With proper technology and guidance, they can prosper and bring more business to the city,? said Pradip Kochar, a city-based businessman who is supporting the exhibition.

 Out of the four per cent silk exports from India, Calcutta accounts for over one-and-half per cent. 

 With even the hosiery industry bigwigs like Lux and Rupa hailing from Calcutta, the garment business boom in town is likely to continue, feel experts.

 The government, in its bid to improve business facilities in Bengal, is targeting scattered business establishments for improvement. It has also decided to open an apparel park.

 ?With a Rs-2,000 machine, Metiabruz businessmen are producing one to two kidswear in an hour. By investing a few thousand more, they can produce up to 14 products an hour,? said Mishra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 In many pockets of the city, drugs are sold in broad daylight and in full view 

of the public. The subway near the Sealdah railway station is one such area. Many 

school dropouts, jobless youths and daily wage-earners are introduced to this 

vice here. The police should patrol the area often, conduct raids and arrest the 

drug peddlers. The longer these gangs are allowed to operate here, the more will 

people fall into the trap. 

 B.N. Bose, Dum Dum. 

 The Garden Reach hospital was established around 1966. Initially, authorities 

promised that it would be a 131-bedded, well-equipped hospital. But that assurance 

has fallen flat a long time ago. Only an outdoor department was set up and 10 

beds were added later. Even now it has no provision for x-ray and medicines. Its 

windows are broken, doors have vanished. Hundreds of residents in Garden Reach 

are tailors by profession. Often, when a needle pricks the finger accidentally, 

they rush to this hospital. But the nurse simply refers the case to a bigger hospital. 

At least simple treatment should be available in the Garden Reach hospital. Local 

MLA Md Amin, who is in charge of the labour department, should at least make available 

the primary treatment facilities in this hospital.

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, Hooghly. 

 Although convoys of ministers and high-ranking officers regularly pass via 

VIP Road, both sides of the street are littered with rubbish. In fact, the poor 

maintenance has left it very much looking like a dirty alley. The local residents 

are the ones who suffer the nauseating stench emitted from the rotting refuse. 

I request the municipality to look into the matter.

 Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia. 

 From early morning till midnight, contractors unload sand, fly ash, rubbish 

and construction material on Sahid Khudiram Road along the only drainage canal 

in this densely populated area under Budge Budge Municipality?s ward no 12. The 

state government?s neglect of this nuisance has lead to the filling up of a major 

portion of this canal. No wonder, the area had been inundated after heavy downpours 

this monsoon. The canal has now become a huge dumping ground where mosquitoes 

and flies breed in large numbers. Cases of malaria, dengue, enteric fever, gastro-enteritis, 

jaundice and other infections have shot up in the locality. Lorries, trucks and 

matadors that bring in construction material are illegally parked on the narrow 

road. Repeated complaints to various authorities (including the state minister 

of environment, municipal affairs, public health, urban development, the home 

secretary, district magistrate, chief minister and the Governor) have gone in 

vain. 

 Mohan Lal Sarkar, Budge Budge.

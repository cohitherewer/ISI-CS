The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Woman power, up close

 Eye on Calcutta 

 Renu Roy

 The city has played host to some remarkable 

 women who have influenced the way we live

 Our city?s presiding deity, and 

 that of the eastern bank of the Hooghly long before the 

 city came into being, is decidedly feminine. The worship 

 of femininity is deeply symbolic, because this city has 

 been the cradle and chosen home of some of the greatest 

 women in our history. The belief that Kalighat was consecrated 

 with the finger of Parvati that fell on it during Shiva?s 

 tandava goes way beyond its immediate religious implications, 

 and has far wider human and elemental implications. 

 Even if one does accept Job Charnock 

 as the city?s father, the contribution of Rani Rashmoni 

 cannot be forgotten. Her once-stately mansion that can now 

 only be recognised as the spice market at Jaanbazaar was 

 the original seat of power, which allowed the East India 

 Company to establish its trading post. Both legend and history 

 describe her as a woman of great substance, with the intelligence, 

 the initiative and the foresight to envision the city that 

 came about. 

 Calcutta?s women have played significant 

 roles in its history. Can our understanding of the past 

 be complete without comprehending the depth of Ma Sarada?s 

 contribution to the Paramahansa? Or the significance of 

 Sister Nivedita to the achievements of Swami Vivekananda? 

 Is it by chance alone that this city produced the subcontinent?s 

 first woman university graduate and qualified woman medical 

 practitioner? Is it sheer coincidence that it was the actress 

 Nati Binodini who sacrificed her talent and her phenomenal 

 career to give this city the theatre of which it is so justifiably 

 proud? Is it only an accident of history that it was here 

 that Begum Rokeya Sakhawat created the opportunity for modern 

 education for Muslim girls?

 I would like to believe that all 

 these events are not entirely coincidental. It is not for 

 nothing that the icon of the Shaktiroopini Mata we are all 

 in the midst of celebrating right now is very special to 

 Calcutta. It encompasses the spirit of this city. This city 

 has always hailed and worshipped women of power. Perhaps 

 that is why powerful women have risen here again and again.

 The iconic Mother has appeared 

 before us in many forms, like in the lined and wrinkled 

 face of Mother Teresa. An Albanian Shaktiroopini Mata has 

 transformed the mind of this city in a manner that no one 

 ever has. We cannot forget what she gave us, because it 

 was love and hope in despair. Calcutta has been ever so 

 cosmopolitan in its intimate acceptance of women like Sister 

 Nivedita or Mother Teresa.

 I will now take the risk of being 

 misunderstood to talk about the women who have made a difference 

 to the quality of our lives in our own times, albeit in 

 our own small spheres. I have had the privilege of interacting 

 with them and feel it is important to acknowledge the Shaktiroopinis 

 of our very own city.

 Mahasveta Devi certainly belongs 

 to my list of the remarkable women in Calcutta today. She 

 is not just one of the finest writers of our times, but 

 a woman of indomitable spirit, a fighter against injustice 

 for those who are dispossessed. My first interaction with 

 her writing came in the 70s during a Hindi production of 

 her Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa, in which I played the 

 role of the protagonist?s friend Nandini. I am amazed at 

 the many practical and subliminal ways in which she has 

 sensitised so many women to the world around them.

 Aparna Sen, with whom I have shared 

 a long-cherished friendship, has been more than an example 

 to many of us. More than anything, she represents the myriad 

 ways in which a woman can express herself, without surrendering 

 the experience of living like millions of other women, as 

 mother, wife, sister, daughter et al. She was an outstanding 

 performer and star who never let her eminence become a barrier, 

 either to other people, or even to herself. As the editor 

 of Sananda, she has contributed immeasurably to the 

 creation of the new Bengali woman of today. As a director 

 of rare sensitivity, I know for a fact that her films Paroma 

 and Paromitar Ekdin, have certainly made a deep impact, 

 especially on younger women in her audience. The thoughts 

 she has provoked, as editor and filmmaker, will travel for 

 a considerable period of time.

 Among those who have influenced 

 the lifestyles of women in this city, a special place will 

 always be reserved for Usha Uthup. She appeared first as 

 part of the Sami Sisters trio, she revealed an Usha Iyer 

 in the Park Street of my youth, and then became Usha Uthup 

 ? the phenomenon we know today. One woman, many lives, many 

 melodies, many thoughts, many emotions, with one voice. 

 Usha Uthup is a remarkable woman, whom Calcutta made possible. 

 She was neither born nor brought up here, but chose this 

 city as her home, just as this city chose her as its minstrel. 

 And wherever the minstrel travels, she carries Calcutta 

 to every corner of the globe. Kolkata, Kolkata, Don?t 

 Worry Kolkata?

 What is remarkable, and full of 

 resonances from the past, is the manner in which theatre 

 in Calcutta has given refuge to women who wish to communicate. 

 Even in the 19th century, it was theatre that gave respectability 

 and security to countless talented contemporaries of Binodini. 

 In our own times theatre has given us at least two ? Usha 

 Ganguli and Dolly Basu. 

 Usha Ganguli has produced several 

 important and meaningful plays, but I am neither a critic, 

 nor is this the forum for analysis. Perhaps the play that 

 symbolises her in many ways is the production of Himmat 

 Mai, her version of Brecht?s Mother Courage. 

 It seems to give shape to the courage with which Usha herself 

 has continued with Hindi theatre in Calcutta, and has managed 

 to make minority language productions an indivisible part 

 of the mainstream. Can you think of Calcutta?s theatre scenario 

 today without her?

 Dolly Basu?s triumph is personal, 

 with her meteoric rise as an actress in a language that 

 is not her mother tongue. She was able to overcome personal 

 and family barriers to discover herself on the boards of 

 the theatre, and to project her talent with confidence and 

 subtlety. I often feel that she, perhaps more than anyone 

 else, truly found the blessings of Binodini, whom I continue 

 to think of as the patron saint of all Calcutta actresses.

 That reminds me of the words with 

 which the Paramahansa blessed Binodini backstage: ?May you 

 attain Chaitanya.? 

 And may the women of Calcutta 

 continue to discover themselves!

 Drops of rain, shower of success

 - Cloudburst 

feeds school's water needs for six months

 JAYANTA BASU

 At a time when most people were looking at the heavens, despairing over the dark monsoon clouds that wouldn?t go away, the Shreenitas, Moumitas and Hiranmoyees of Future Foundation School were welcoming rain.

 They were looking forward to showers so that they could demonstrate ? hands on ? the newly-installed rainwater harvesting mechanism on their school premises near Tollygunge, the first of its kind in any school here.

 The rainwater harvesting mechanism has been installed in the school by utilising part of its rooftop run-off, with the West Bengal chapter of the World Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature providing the financial and technical support. ?The mechanism is simple,? explained the enthusiastic students. 

 ?Rainwater is collected in a 1,000-litre tank from the school terrace through three pipelines. The tank has three connections ? the first one supplies water to toilets, the second to the school garden, and the excess water through the third pipeline goes directly to the aquifer underground?, they added. 

 According to estimates, nearly one-and-a-half lakh litres of rainwater will be collected in the school annually, which will fully meet the overall toilet and gardening needs from May to October, and partially for the rest of the year. ?We always encourage students to take up environmentally-important activities and rainwater harvesting is just another step in that direction,? explained principal Ranjan Mitra.

 The school has already started ?vermicomposting? ( eco-friendly method of converting bio-degradable wastes into organic fertilisers with the help of earthworms) using leftover vegetables, fruit peel, dried leaves and flowers collected in a pit and ?paper recycling? by turning waste paper into pulp.

 ?The whole project has come up within three months. Though WWF has borne the capital investment, the school?s students will take care of the regular monitoring part,? said Saswati Sen of the WWF. 

 ?We have already identified two groups of adequately-informed students from the nature club. One group will train the school staff on the dos and don?ts of the project, while the other will try to generate awareness among fellow students about the virtues of water preservation, especially rainwater harvesting,? said Krishnakali Mukherjee, school teacher and adviser of the project.

 According to the experts associated with the project, the ?uniqueness? of the project lies in the fact that it has an arrangement of ?direct groundwater recharging?, apart from the regular arrangements like supply to toilets and school garden. Annually, about 80,000 litres of rainwater will be available to recharge the groundwater from the system, estimate the experts. ?In Calcutta, such small rainwater harvesting projects in schools or other public places could prove extremely beneficial,? said S.R. Banerjee, state WWF director.

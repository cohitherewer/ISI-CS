The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Toasting a perfect Ten

HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 Espee, one of the best-known boutiques in town, raised a toast to its 10-year-old existence. What began with two friends trying to dabble in colours and fabrics, went on to fuse the fastest moving names in fashion under one roof ? Sabyasachi (Pepsi) Mukherjee, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Rina Dhaka...

The design stop celebrated a decade with much fashion 

fare on Tuesday (Picture above by Rashbehari Das). Well-wishers poured into the 

Theatre Road outlet, with proud owners Purnima Chawla and Sangita Kejriwal doing 

the gracious hostess? act. The guests in turn reciprocated with praise panache. 

?These were the people who believed in me when I began. It was from here that 

I started to get commercially noticed,? reminisced a nostalgic Pepsi. 

 The celebrations were marked with a brief fashion show, displaying the works of various designers the shop stocks. The designs combined an extensive palette of muted earth shades and vibrant blues, reds and fuschia. The cuts and silhouettes are as varied, ranging from classic finishes to flamboyant fun wear. 

 The b?day fun, of course, translated into festive fervour. ?Vibrancy will be the buzz at our store this season,? promised Purnima.

 And the racks are only expanding. ?We hope to carry on to other cities in the country from here,? signed off Sangita.

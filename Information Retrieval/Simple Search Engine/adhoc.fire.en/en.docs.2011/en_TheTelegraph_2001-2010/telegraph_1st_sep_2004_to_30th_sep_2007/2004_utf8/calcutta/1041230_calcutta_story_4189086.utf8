 Ballet on skates ready to roll in

 In Europe it is called ballet on ice; in the US and Canada, theatre on ice. Whatever be the name, it is one of the fastest growing sports on skates. And for Calcuttans, the good news is they do not need to marvel at footage on television and dream of a voyage to St Petersburg State Ballet on Ice to learn how to glide across the white glistening sheet in a display of sublime grace and agility. 

 Zenith Roller Skating Academy is teaming up with the recently-opened Indian Ballet Company to provide lessons closer home (at Indira cinema studio) this January. ?The idea of combining the two came to me when I went for a ballet demonstration at Mukherjee?s academy,? says Madhuchhanda Mookerjee, director-choreographer of Zenith, which specialises in artistic skating. 

 Madhuchhanda has been putting students on wheels for some years now. Two of her students have picked up medals at the National Roller-Skating Championship in the category dance on skates.

 While she started out with the western dance style (to tunes like Barbie Girl and Coco Jumbo), demand made her shift to Hindi film songs. The prize-winning routines, however, were with Indian classical dance forms ? Odissi and Bharatanatyam. Ballet, therefore, would be the latest feather in a varied course cap.

 Says Ash Mukherjee, director of the ballet company: ?Ballet grants a dancer grace and musicality as well as flexibility. In fact, all world-famous skaters like Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean had to take ballet lessons to perfect their craft.? 

 Ash plans to teach exercises that would give students strong abdominal muscles and backs. ?Imagine the impact of metal against ice when skaters land after a jump. Their knees and backs have to withstand that.?

 Ash points out that there is a lot in common between roller-skating and ballet. ?It is only a few ballet steps that are outside the purview of skaters. They are always on the move. Moreover, they cannot be on point as one needs ballet shoes for that. Grande allegro (big fast steps), involving big jumps and turns, also looks ungainly on skates. Other steps, like saute de basque, can be done in both disciplines. In fact, skaters do an extra couple of turns when they jump.? 

 According to Madhuchhanda, only those with the maximum control on skates can attempt to dance. ?My existing students will now concentrate on learning ballet. Those who enroll afresh will have to pick up skating first.? That, she says, requires a year.

 Madhuchhanda is planning to organise a championship on ice this March at Clown Town. ?I plan to stage Swan Lake with my students,? she smiles.

 Sprihi Kanodia, a Class XI student of Mahadevi Birla Girls School, is eager to add to her repertoire after perfecting Bharatanatyam on skates. ?Ballet will not be easy, but if we are dedicated there is no reason why we cannot do it.? 

 In the excitement that the new offering has caused, 12 of Madhuchhanda?s students have already signed up for ballet on skates. Now it is only a few days? wait to get rolling.

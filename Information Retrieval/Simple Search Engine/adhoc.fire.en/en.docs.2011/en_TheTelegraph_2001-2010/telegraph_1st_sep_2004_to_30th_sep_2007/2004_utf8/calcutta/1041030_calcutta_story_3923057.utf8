The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Screen grab for festive Friday

 - Veer-Zaara shifts spotlight from multiplex mania to standalone theatres

 Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in Veer-Zaara

After a gap of eight years, he is back with a bang 

this Diwali. And Yash Chopra is leaving practically no screen untouched to make 

Veer-Zaara the biggest box-office success of his career.

 With a record 150-plus prints in Mumbai, 300 prints overseas and 25 prints in Calcutta, the Shah Rukh Khan-Preity Zinta-Rani Mukherjee-starrer is already a winner.

 ?It?s very simple. What Chopra wants is come Friday, November 12, everywhere you look, you just see Veer-Zaara,? says Kushagra Jalan, director of Jalan Distributor Pvt. Ltd., the Calcutta distributor of the film.

 ?We will be distributing the film in 30 to 35 screens in Calcutta and a total of about 50 screens, districts and suburbs included. This is the largest ever distribution for us. Only Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham came close.?

 This ?expansive strategy? from Chopra is very unlike his usual self, say trade pundits. ?Earlier Yashji wanted his films to run at a few theatres but for a long time,? says Arijit Dutta, EIMPA president and owner of Priya and Globe. ?Most of his films have run for at least 20 weeks at Priya. But this time, he has gone with the current fad in Hollywood, where he is banking on initial recovery and hence the record number of prints and screens.?

 What the 50-screen target means is that the spotlight, after months, would shift from the multiplex to single-screen theatres. How the India-Pakistan love story does in these halls of recent neglect would determine the film?s fate. 

Also, a longish run for Veer (Shah Rukh) and Zaara 

(Preity) could throw these theatres overshadowed by the multiplex mania a long-awaited 

lifeline. ?For big films like this one, single-screen halls, with more number 

of seats, hold the key for recovery for the film distributor unlike small films 

which bank on multiplex collections,? confirms Dutta.

 Apart from 89 Cinemas and INOX (City Centre and Forum), Veer-Zaara is sure to release at Menoka, Hind, Paradise, Malancha, Purnasree and Parijat.

 Says Mahitosh Chatterjee, manager of Menoka: ?For a big film like this, you can?t limit the viewership to the niche multiplex crowd. The film is not only for those who can afford Rs 200-250 tickets, shell out Rs 100 for car parking, spend another Rs 200 at the food court. It is also for the masses who prefer the Rs 30 rear class ticket. Our capacities are thrice and prices half.?

 The man of the moment, of course, played down the grab-every-screen-in-sight syndrome. ?There are huge expectations around the film. We are just reacting to that and trying to reach out to as many people as possible,? Yash Chopra told Metro, when contacted in Mumbai.

 With the Chopra banner beam plans getting as big as it gets, Veer-Zaara is all ready to steal the Diwali thunder of other releases. While Sanjay Gupta has pushed back Musafir, Ram Gopal Varma and Subhash Ghai are going ahead with Naach and Aitraaz. Says trade expert Taran Adarsh: ?It is getting very tough for the other makers to get proper theatres. I am sure some may postpone their releases. If they do not, their initials are going to be badly affected because Veer-Zaara would be the first option for every exhibitor and viewer.?

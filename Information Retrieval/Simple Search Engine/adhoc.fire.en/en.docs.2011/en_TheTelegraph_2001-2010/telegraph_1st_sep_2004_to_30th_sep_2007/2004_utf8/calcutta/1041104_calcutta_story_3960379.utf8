 Cops ready to combat killer fog 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Taking a lesson from last winter?s string of mishaps caused by poor visibility, the traffic police have come forward with special measures to avert deaths under wheels in the next few months.

 Fog-induced low visibility claimed lives of several persons, including policemen on duty, last winter. 

 ?The majority of the accidents took place because people failed to see the road clearly at a distance. This year, we are providing traffic policemen with equipment to cope with the fog. We will also issue guidelines for policemen and pedestrians,? said Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police, traffic. 

 According to statistics made available by police, 155 people died in road accidents last winter (November to February). The average death toll was 38.75 per month, against the annual average of 36.83 per month. 

 ?Keeping this in mind, we have decided to alert policemen as well as pedestrians,? Basu said. Three policemen of constable rank died while on duty last winter. ?All three were victims of fast driving and low visibility,? said an officer of the traffic department?s fatality wing.

 Most road mishaps in winter take place either at night or in the early morning. ?Last winter, the accidents took place between 10 pm, when traffic constables are withdrawn, and 6 am, when they are about to join duty,? said a senior officer of the traffic department.

 A study conducted by the department has revealed that most of the fatal accidents took place in relatively less congested areas, such as the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, Red Road and the approach roads to Vidyasagar Setu, where the fog cover is thick at night.

 ?Poor visibility doesn?t deter motorists from driving fast. By the time they spot a pedestrian or a cop, it?s too late to apply the brakes,? joint commissioner Basu said.

 Elaborating on the safety measures, a senior officer of the traffic department said: ?We will provide policemen with more jackets with reflectors and safety bars. Helmets with reflectors are also being considered.?

 The safety guidelines: 

Park your car just along the kerb

Keep the taillights switched on and, if possible, keep indicators blinking

If the visibility is low, listen carefully before crossing a road

Do not try to stop vehicles by standing in their way 

Install fog-lights (yellow lights) in cars

Don?t stand on road dividers.

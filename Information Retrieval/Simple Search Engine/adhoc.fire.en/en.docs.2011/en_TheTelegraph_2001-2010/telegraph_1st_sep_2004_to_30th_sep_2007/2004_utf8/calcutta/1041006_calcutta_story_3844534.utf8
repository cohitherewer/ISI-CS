The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Act the part

Inject life to the ramp, implores choreographer 

Achla Sachdev

 I look for models who can do a little more than just walk the ramp. In fact 

I look for people who can act without speaking. The body language, the walk, the 

facial expressions should make the crowd feel happy, excited and titillated. In 

short, the model should know well enough what effect he or she has on the crowd. 

 I am against the straight face no-smile 

ramp walks simply because they are so boring. Adding that little bit of appeal 

with a little gig in the middle of the ramp makes the audience feel that they 

haven?t just seen some lifeless clothes. For them, it should also be an evening 

well spent. 

As a choreographer, I can teach each of them what 

I want, but whether what I have visualised comes alive on the ramp depends on 

the skills of the model. 

 I think 

Jesse Randhawa and Candice Pinto do a great job of this kind of modelling. They 

are both very spontaneous and expressive. I worked with some models for the first 

time at the Indian Leather Products Association show last weekend in Calcutta. 

I think they tried well enough to portray themselves in a novel way. 

The problem is that since most choreographers don?t 

ask models to put in that extra effort, they don?t usually bother to use their 

body language and expressions as part of the walk.

 Being 

a model doesn?t mean having a very thin frame. Crash diets are a no-no but yes, 

one needs to be slim. Flab on the stomach, hips and thighs is bad news. Height 

is a prerequisite since most outfits look best on tall people. A healthy diet 

with exercise is the ideal way to move ahead.

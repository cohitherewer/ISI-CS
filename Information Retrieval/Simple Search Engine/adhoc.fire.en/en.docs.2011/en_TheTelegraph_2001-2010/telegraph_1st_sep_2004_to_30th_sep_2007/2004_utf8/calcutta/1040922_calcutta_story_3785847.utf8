 Held for dupe of armyman

 A STAFF REPORTER

 He was an army officer on the verge of retirement. 

 She had just opened up a training centre, employing ex-armymen.

 So, Colonel P.K. Chaturvedi signed up. That was in 1995. It was the beginning of his troubles, which continue even after his death. His fault: believing in Ashima Ganguly.

 When Ganguly needed capital for a pen factory in 2001, Chaturvedi poured in Rs 9 lakh from his life?s savings. He received no returns.

 After losing a total of Rs 21.5 lakh to Ganguly, Chaturvedi?s widow filed a police complaint two months ago.

 Ganguly was arrested on Monday morning, produced in Alipore sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s (SDJM) court on Tuesday, and remanded in police custody.

 Chaturvedi did receive a few cheques, but some bounced because the accounts didn?t exist, while one was made to a bank that had closed down, said lawyer Debranjan Basu Mullick.

 ?There was excuse after excuse every time my father asked about the money,? said daughter Sonali. ?About two months before his death in March 2003, he made Ganguly sign a bond, as he had started to get suspicious. After his death, we tried soft negotiations for a while. But when we realised that all we were getting was more lies, we decided to take the legal route.?

 Even though the complaint had been filed at Behala police station on July 3, Ganguly remained free till September 20. 

 ?She was absconding. Police raided her so-called office on Russell Street last month, but couldn?t find her there, either. Finally, on Sunday night, she returned to her mother?s house in Jadavpur. The police had kept a vigil, and arrested her on Monday morning,? added Basu Mullick.

 Ganguly has been charged with cheating and misappropriation under Sections 406, 409 and 420 of the IPC, and forgery under Sections 467, 468 and 471.

 SDJM Manjit Singh denied her bail petition and remanded her in police custody. The next hearing is set for September 24.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bon Appetease

Victor Banerjee

With options on guy turkeys and doll turkeys, the 

quandary around the globe this Christmas is, where in the world do you find the 

best turkey? A couple of weeks ago, I discussed splits (remember the split pea 

soup with lamb shanks?) without talking about Bengal, India, Serbia, Czechoslovakia 

or the Soviet Union.

A few years ago, after the accords of Oslo and Camp 

David were as trussed and stuffed as any Christmas turkey ever cooked, I came 

up with the brilliant idea of air-dropping pink dairy pigs in an operation to 

rival the most famous paratrooper landings of WW2, all over Israel and any pockets 

in the land where you might find Palestinians cramped in camps. The idea, I was 

sure, would derail the war and unite the enemies to fight a common cause and rid 

their land of pigs they both abhorred. The Indian government, already determined 

to propose a ban on cow-slaughter, refused to understand that pigs were, euphemistically 

at least, as much a symbol of unity midst disunity in the Middle-East as the holy 

cow was relevant to uniting UP where quantities of gobar and cow urine 

combined to form the greatest concentration of methane in the earth?s atmosphere.

My plan was rejected. The UN loved the idea but the 

US vetoed it. They were determined to continue sending bacon rashers and smoked 

ham to their poor soldiers in Iraq and Kuwait, in spite of the religious ban on 

pork products in the region. Then, this last week, the Thai government airdropped 

over 100 million peace bombs, made of origami paper birds, all over southern Thailand 

where ethnic violence has tainted the image of a peaceful land. The Super Powers 

were quick to react to this ?Buddhist? approach and felt Thailand had a lot to 

learn from Vietnam and Afghanistan where napalm and tunnel bombs did the trick 

more quickly and easily. Also, it opened up new areas of international cooperation 

and investment in the re-building of cities and their devastated infrastructure 

as opposed to simply leaving a mess of paper planes for people to sweep off their 

streets for weeks. 

After the fake television re-enactment of precision 

bombings in Iraq during the first Gulf War, sales of defence equipment from the 

United States soared to an all time high. After this current Iraq war, where the 

US and Great Britain backed by 30 odd other coalition members from countries that 

George W. certainly cant remember the names of, let alone pronounce, some of whom 

sent a dozen soldiers to support the clean-up operations, the US Dollar has fallen 

to an all time low and millions from Europe are flying across the Atlantic for 

cheap Christmas shopping in the United States much like Bombaywallahs fly to Bangkok 

for their designer wear. 

And now every restaurant on Park Street is selling 

?Australian Wild Duck? this Christmas. For heaven?s sake. In a land famous for 

wallabies, crocs and the duck-billed platypus (in my opinion the world?s most 

fascinating creature) which dingo gazed through clouds of black and white cockatoos 

and saw ducks fly north for the summer, across the bright constellation of the 

?Southern Cross?, to land on the kitchen tables of Calcutta, beneath the winter 

sky?s sting of ?Scorpio?? Frankly, my dear, I don?t give a damn! But for those 

of you who can tell an Aussie wild duck from Midnapore?s paati haansh, 

I shall give you a recipe for roast duck that shall bring Yuletide joy to your 

family who can afford neither turkey nor goose nor a mallard from Oz.

Bon Appetease your appetites this Christmas and may 

you, with a little help from my absurdities, cook up mysteries and fantasies in 

your kitchens, in the New Year!

Glazed duck and stuffed apples in fresh apple juice

Serves 6

Ingredients:

1-3? lb duck with giblets; 1 teaspoon salt; 1/3 teaspoon 

freshly ground black pepper; 6 cooked apples, washed, cored and immersed in acidulated 

water; 1 tablespoon/? oz unsalted butter; salt and pepper; 3 oz/? cup sultanas/golden 

raisins; 2? oz / ? cup coarsely chopped shelled walnuts; 16 fl oz fresh apple 

juice; 4 oz clover honey

Method:

Pre-heat the oven to 500?F (2500?C)

Wash the bird and pat it dry, reserving the 

giblets for step 4. Rub salt and pepper inside the cavity. Fold the posterior 

flap inside the cavity and truss the legs and tail together with kitchen string.

Place the duck breast side up on a rack set 

inside a large roasting pan, and cook for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature 

to 3500?F (1800?C) and rotate the duck to its side on the rack. Cook for 20 minutes. 

Place the duck on its other side and cook for an additional 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, make sure that the apples are properly 

cored. Finely chop the giblets reserved from Step 2. Heat the butter in a pan 

over a medium setting and saut? the giblets until they are just brown. Add salt 

and pepper to taste. Add the sultanas and walnuts, stir, then set the pan aside 

for the stuffing to cool. Stuff the apples firmly with the mixture.

Combine the apple juice and honey in a large 

saucepan. Place the stuffed apples in the liquid. Bring to a boil and then reduce 

the heat to low. Cover the saucepan and simmer for 20 minutes, occasionally basting 

the apples. Remove the apples with tongs and set aside.

Increase the heat under the saucepan and reduce 

the apple juice-honey mixture to 4 fl oz of syrup, stirring now and again.

 Remove the roasting pan from the oven. Take 

out the duck and the rack. Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of fat from the 

pan. Return the duck to the pan, breast side uppermost, and place the stuffed 

apples around the bird. Baste both the duck and the apples with the apple juice-honey 

reduction. Roast for an additional 15 minutes.

 Transfer the duck to a serving dish and surround 

it with the apples. Pour the juices from the roasting pan over the duck. Remove 

the trussing string and serve at once.

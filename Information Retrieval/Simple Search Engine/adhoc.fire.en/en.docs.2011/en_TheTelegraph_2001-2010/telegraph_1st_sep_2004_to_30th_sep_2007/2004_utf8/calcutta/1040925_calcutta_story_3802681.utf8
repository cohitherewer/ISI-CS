The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Young saviours unite

What does it take to protect the environment? Walking to school, 

perhaps. And how about propagating peace? Maybe just a gathering of like-minded 

people to chalk out an agenda. There?s a lot the youth can do to make the world 

a better place. Young Metro takes a look at two events coming up next month 

that Calcutta could be a part of.

Peaceful Process: Youth initiatives take 

global wings

Walk to School Week

Yes, it?s time to cut the calories and the pollution, 

and claim the roads back from the car crawl. Pedestrian power rules, and what 

better way to prove it than to walk to school? So take up the cause during International 

Walk to School Week from October 4 to 8, and make your mark. Get the adults to 

join in. Of course, if you live in Salt Lake and go to school in Ballygunge, it 

might be a tad difficult, but get off at a safe distance and join the march.

It all began in 1994 in Hertfordshire County in the 

UK. The following year, the rest of the country joined in. By 1998, North America 

had become a part of the movement. Last year, nearly three million children, parents 

and others from 29 countries participated in the celebration of International 

Walk to School Day, on October 8. 

Whatever the motive, be it safer streets, healthy 

habits or conserving the environment, the purpose is the same ? for communities 

to bond together and walk for their rights. In most places, schools, colleges 

and other educational institutions have events woven around the theme, thus encouraging 

the act year-round. 

Support and survive.

Youth Peace Summit

From October 23 to 28, United Nations has organised 

the World Youth Peace Summit ? Voices of the Next Generation ? Cradle of Humanity, 

in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. The first-of-its-kind event is slated to draw 

about 2,000 youth leaders from every walk of life, business and government to 

education, law, medicine, science, religion, the arts, sports, NGOs and other 

organisations, from around the world.

The hallowed gathering will include Nobel Laureates, 

celebrity guests, international dignitaries, and well-known personalities. The 

summit will focus on creating awareness about issues like health, poverty, employment, 

violence and environmental degradation, as well as empowering the youngsters to 

take action by providing a framework. 

To take part (all are welcome), log on to www.worldyouthpeacesummit.org 

or www.millenniumpeacesummit.org. For summit documents, brochures and other 

information, email infowyps.org. Join in the effort to build a forum 

for peace and a platform for expression, expand a global network and promote communication 

and understanding for a brighter tomorrow.

 What?s on your mind this week

 Toast 

to TOPS

It was a day dedicated to quiz-crazy Calcuttans. The 

date was September 18, the place was Science City (filled to capacity), the occasion 

was The Telegraph Open Quiz Show, the biggest gathering for any quiz contest 

ever held here. The entries overflowed, and such was the enthusiasm that participants 

queued up well before the reporting time. Even the rain couldn?t put a damper 

on things. Though our team could not make it to the finals, it did not dampen 

our spirits. We cheered the finalists instead. Derek O?Brien was excellent and 

so were the organisers. Hats off. The memories will linger for a long time.

Endless misery

?What did we do to deserve this?? was the pitiable 

cry of an individual who attended a funeral of a victim of the Russian hostage 

crisis in a school. Thomas Gray once said: ?Death is the inevitable hour.? But 

is it justified for the children who lost their lives in the carnage? We have 

not forgotten the Kumbakonam disaster yet. When will it end?

Animal love

I whole-heartedly agree with Santanu Bhowmick?s views, 

which appeared in this column on September 17. Generalising animals as cruel and 

human beings as avatars of kindness is absurd. Pet dogs have often been known 

to give up food after the demise of their master, while stray ones guard abandoned 

babies on city streets. I recently saw a programme on Animal Planet that warmed 

my heart. A sick deer calf abandoned by its mother was being looked after by a 

lioness! While the calf fondly chewed on her ear, the lioness stood guard. Both 

were without food for 16 days. The lioness braved starvation for the calf. That?s 

humane.

Sunil Kumar Chakravarty

Blind justice

The emotional fellow-feeling for Hetal Parekh that 

Raffhat Mir has is evident from her letter published in this column last week. 

The answer to Raffhat?s question to the rape committed by a policeman is simple: 

he should be hanged. In fact, every rapist on trial should be handed the death 

sentence. Only then will it be proven that justice is blind. It is sad that since 

the hanging of Dhananjoy, a 15-year-old to a schoolteacher and a policeman have 

committed the crime. Also, several children died copying Dhananjoy?s final act. 

His hanging has added fuel to a raging fire. Does Raffhat have an answer as to 

why the woman for whom Bapi Sen lost his life disappeared? And why isn?t she concerned 

about the culprits in the Hannah Foster and Best Bakery cases? For the crime to 

stop, mass hangings of all undertrials accused of rape should be carried out. 

It may sound unreal, but it?s the only way. Any alternatives, Raffhat? 

Zaki Mubarki,

Equality

Some thought should be given to Raffhat Mir?s views, 

expressed in this column. But she missed Zaki Mubarki?s point. He means that everyone 

committing crimes like murder and rape should be hanged. But there should be equal 

treatment. Also, why isn?t she then bothered about Bapi Sen, Zahira Sheikh, Jessica 

Lal, Naina Sahni and Graham Staines and his sons?

A 

Broken Safety Pin

A fragment of the apple 

Bursting in the tree 

Above your nails, 

Drips in the violet blood 

That formed on the rocks 

?as the waters pulled away 

Towards your last blow on the flute 

And then, 

We hung on our ears, 

A pentacle of ice? 

Inam Hussain Mullick 

1st year English, JU

Revelation ? The Secret

I am ?cold? ? 

The arms of love don?t ?enfold me?. 

I am lost in some ?darkness?, 

Where its warmth cannot reach out and ?touch me?.

I want to cry, but tears freeze to ?indifference? 

in my eyes.

I can call out and you?ll be near me, still ? Why? 

Oh! Why do words fail? 

I didn?t have the right to ?hurt you?, 

But I mistook myself for you, 

Won?t be understanding my ?silence?. 

Oh! The ?passion? in your words, 

You tell me we are together ?forever?, 

Never to be separated, for we are ?one soul?. 

But dear ? these are ?just words?, 

And we are ? ?REAL?.

Love

Somebody loves you

And wants you to know,

Longs to be with you

Wherever you go,

Somebody loves you

And right from the start,

Somebody wants to

come into your heart.

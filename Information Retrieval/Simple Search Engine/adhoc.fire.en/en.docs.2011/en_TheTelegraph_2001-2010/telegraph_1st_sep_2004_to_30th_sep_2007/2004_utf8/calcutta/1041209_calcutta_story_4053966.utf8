Troubled past, positive outlook

 Anjali, Rita and Jayanti (names changed) looked resplendent in flaming black-and-red saris. Laughing together over cups of tea near Shahid Minar, going over the lines of their play before their performance, they framed the very picture of confidence.

 Which was poles apart from their earlier situations. Each of these three, along with others at a south Calcutta NGO, were survivors of violence. Getting ready for their production Er Ki Porinoti as part of the celebration of the International Campaign to Stop Violence against Women and Girls, their smiles and excitement hid well the sadness in their eyes. 

 Beaten by their husbands, threatened to be set on fire by in-laws, thrown out on the streets, cursed and abused, denied meals and the right to meet their children ? these women have missed out on love and crave for basic respect.

 In between rehearsing at the last minute, Anjali said: ?My husband had always been abusive. He hit me so hard that I had to be hospitalised many times. He would not let me or my children use the bathroom for long times at a stretch,? Anjali fought her tears. 

 Fighting a case for compensation from her husband, Anjali now cooks for a family and looks after the old couple, who in turn, lets her stay in their house. ?My strength are my children?? her voice trailed off. 

 For Rita, trouble began at her in-laws soon after marriage. ?My husband was supportive in the beginning, but later even he changed. Now, I have to fend for myself with my three-year-old son,? she said, her eyes moistening, as she got ready for her performance. ?Here at the NGO, there are others like me. We understand each other?s worries.?

 An official of NGO Swayam said: ?These women are real survivors. Broken in spirit earlier, they are now fighting their own battles and inspiring others to do the same.? 

 As 28-year-old Jayanti put it: ?Even if I forget my lines on stage, I am confident I will be able to make up for it, by improvising ? Lessons from my troubled life have taught me to think positive??

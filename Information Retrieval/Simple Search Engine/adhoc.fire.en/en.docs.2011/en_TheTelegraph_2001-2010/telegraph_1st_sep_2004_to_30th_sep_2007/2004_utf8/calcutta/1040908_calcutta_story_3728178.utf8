The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Cool shades to shun the sun

TIP TO TOE

With eyewear brands offering mega discounts 

and the malls flooded with trendy cheaper options, the time is right to go for 

some gorgeous gogs. Himika Chaudhuri ogles the fare

The worst of the sunny season may be over, but there 

is good reason to pick up a pair of shades now. For one, the end-of-summer sales 

of all the biggest brands selling sunglasses are on at the moment. But for those 

who prefer affordable gogs that are good for a season, there is a flood of trendy 

unbranded shades imported from Bangkok. 

So you could adopt the Saif Ali Khan look from Hum 

Tum or the John Abraham style in Dhoom with less damage done to the 

pocket than you might expect.

Besides being available in the outlandish colours 

 like pink, yellow, green, purple the shapes are also diverse rectangular, 

conical, oval, butterfly.

At between Rs 300 to Rs 650 a pair, the price differential 

is enough to give pause before purchasing a designer label. Hop down from the 

Rs 2,500-plus pedestal and try out this funky fare. They could be ideal to sport 

on a Christmas jaunt in Goa this winter, where the crowd isnt likely to look 

at the fine print on your eyewear.

The seasons mantra is the bigger the better. Its 

the 60s big-glasses look that is really in now, says Anamika of Cool, a new outlet 

for eyewear in Sreeram Arcade. In fact, while the retro look is back, slim shades 

are still as much in fashion as ever.

The speciality of the range of glasses imported from 

Bangkok is that they are meant for both morning and night wear and are good for 

men and women, said Chetan of Desi Boyz, an accessories shop in Metro Plaza where 

the bright coloured bikers glasses are selling like hot cakes. The glasses offer 

UV protection as well.

A word of caution: unbranded and affordable does not 

necessarily translate to roadside. Most of these dirt cheap choices look cheap 

as well. Not to mention the fact that there is no guarantee that they will be 

friendly on the eyes.

Here is a look at the options to block out that unwanted 

glare:

Rimless strap-ons

These have been around for a while and come in both 

neutral and bright shades. Blue, brown and colourless are the options that you 

have if you want to flaunt the good boy look. 

If you are keen to make a style statement, however, 

you should consider the wackier variety, like the syrup green or the bright yellow 

pairs. 

The style sits on the face and would show off a face 

with broad facial structure to best advantage. They are quite popular, we are 

told, with bikers who wish to avoid metal frames which are prone to heating up 

during summer.

Price: Rs 350 onwards

Butterfly

You could go ahead and get as unisex as you want, 

but all said, these particular frames are best worn by women. Shaped somewhat 

like a butterfly (hence the name), the narrow fibre frames are available in colours 

like bright red and violet. 

The feminine look is best suited for small faces, 

and the bright colours might favour those on the fairer side of the shade card.

Price: Rs 250 onwards

CELEB 

STYLE

The 60s look

These are the big hits of the season, thanks to Saif 

Ali Khans endorsement in Hum Tum. These cover up a large part of the face 

and goes well with casual outfits (sported by Victoria Beckham right). The colours 

are grey, dark blue and red. Pick up a pair and be the cool cat of the disco.

Price: Rs 650 onwards

Mercury toned

These are just right to help your friend catch a glimpse 

of the girl sitting behind him. The reflective, silver mercury coating is often 

jazzed up with tinges of reds and yellows that reflect more in the sun.

Price: Rs 350 onwards

 Hospitality rides a crest

 - Occupancy, banquet bills surge; star addresses eye winter of 2005 boom

 HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

 House-full (well, almost) is the healthy sign hanging outside hospitality stops across town these days (or rather months). With occupancy levels vaulting and food-and-beverage bills bloating, all major hotels in town are on a high. And yet, feels the industry, this is just the beginning of a boom.

 ?The demand for five-star rooms has gone up by 60 rooms per day in the last year. But the boom should come around next winter, when rooms in all five-star hotels will be booked for six months at a stretch,? predicts Amitabh Rai, general manager, The Oberoi Grand.

 All major hospitality addresses have witnessed a significant growth in occupancy rate. Add to that the average room rate (ARR) ? price of one room night ? also going up and you have all the makings of a hotel hot streak.

 Going strictly by numbers, the fastest mover is latest entrant ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton and Towers. Warming up to its second winter, this season promises to be far busier than the previous one. ?We came in at a time when West Bengal was again beginning to show an upward business trend. The positive surge has affected us, too, and we have managed to achieve cash breakeven in the first year of operations, which is an international benchmark,? says Ranvir Bhandari, general manager, ITC Sonar Bangla, boasting a ?phenomenal 100 per cent increase in occupancy rates?.

 In the heart of the city, too, there?s no slowing down. ?For a long time, Bengal was not on the business radar, but now that people are looking at the east, national and international business travellers are checking in,? reasons Rai.

 S.H. Rahman of The Park agrees: ?Hotel occupancies are going up due to a global upswing in travel and improvement of business environment in the state.?

 Bulk-room bookings from corporate houses and a constant flow of banquet events are adding to the feel-good factor. And through it all, the hotels are happy to raise the service bar. ?Most of the guests have international exposure and are not ready to settle for anything less,? reveals a spokesperson for Taj Bengal. So, personalised services and comprehensive business-and-pleasure packages are a must.

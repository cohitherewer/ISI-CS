 Homicide hearing against promoter 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Monday directed Alipore court to resume the trial of Pradip Kundalia and 11 others on charges of culpable homicide in the case relating to the collapse of an apartment block in Bhowanipore in 1989. Eleven people had been killed.

 The case against Kundalia and others has been pending in Alipore court since 1990, after the court wanted to start the trial against the accused persons under Section 304 A (IPC). This would mean the accused could be sent to jail for only two years. 

 All the accused, including Kundalia, were granted bail by Alipore court. According to legal experts, if the charge of culpable homicide is proved against Kundalia and others, the court can sentence them to life imprisonment.

 After a gap of 15 years, the government on Monday appealed before Justice G.C. De of Calcutta High Court and alleged that the trial court had taken a lenient view of the case. 

 ?The gravity of the crime of Kundalia and others, who were the promoters of the apartments that collapsed, was not considered by the trial court,? public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah told the court.

 The Kundalia building crashed on the night of June 19, 1989, and more than 36 people were trapped under the debris. Police and the fire brigade rescued 25 of them, while 11 others perished under the rubble.

 The decision of the state government to seek an order from the higher court against the order of the trial court after 15 long years has set political tongues wagging.

 Pradip Kundalia was reportedly well-connected in the previous government of Jyoti Basu. Soon after assuming office, chief minster Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said Kundalia?s crime was unpardonable and ?he should be put behind bars?.

 A few months ago, Kundalia was arrested again after a fire broke out in a Shakespeare Sarani highrise. The authorities filed a complaint against him after it was discovered that the building did not have the requisite fire-fighting measures. The Calcutta metropolitan magistrate?s court had sent Kundalia to jail custody. He was later granted bail.

 Beyond blackboard, making science fun

 For once, Samantha D?Rosario believed the feats of Harry Potter could be within the realm of possibility.

The Class IX student of Loreto Day School, Sealdah, 

saw classmate Jackline D?Costa climb atop a wooden board supported by just a few 

sheets of paper rolled into cylinders. And the flimsy props took the girl?s weight 

without buckling. 

 Rationality then took over. Monica Roy, another student, explained: ?This experiment deals with centre of gravity. Jackline?s load is distributed among the paper pillars, thus reducing the pressure on each and enabling them to support her weight collectively.?

 Bridging the age-old gap between the blackboard and the learner, 200-odd students from the city and its adjoining areas performed around 150 such scientific experiments, using low-cost material. 

 The event was part of Apurba Vigyan Mela, being organised at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum. The three-day science fair will end on Saturday. ?The fair is part of the series of programmes organised at the museum to observe 2004 as the year of scientific awareness,? said director Dr Jayanta Sthanapati.

 ?The students taking part in the fair have been trained by experts from renowned institutes, such as SN Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Bose Institute and the Association for Research and Training in Basic Science Education (Nagpur),? Sthanapati added.

 What prompted the museum to involve the students in experimenting what they have learnt by rote? 

 Former director Samar Bagchi explained: ?There is a Chinese proverb: ?I read, I hear, I forget; I see, I remember; I do, I understand.? I believe the saying aptly sums up the learning process. We wanted to encourage students to go beyond the textbook and the blackboard.? 

 According to Suresh Agrawal, secretary of the Nagpur-based association, science is not just about making rockets or nuclear weapons. ?Students are scared of science at an early age because their only exposure to scientific processes is the teacher?s discourse.?

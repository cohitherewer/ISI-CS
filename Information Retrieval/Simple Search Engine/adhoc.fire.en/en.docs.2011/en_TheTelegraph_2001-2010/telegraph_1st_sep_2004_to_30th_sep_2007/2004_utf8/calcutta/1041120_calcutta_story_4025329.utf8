 ?Last year, we did not have a a proper first-aid box, an ambulance or a helpdesk. This Puja, we have taken care of those drawbacks and improved our showing from Two Star to Four Star rating. But we were faulted in not having a wheelchair. Also the judges were upset at our keeping captive pigeons at the Devi?s feet. We promise not to do any such cruelty next year.?

 Words straight from the heart from the organisers of 22 Palli Sarodotsab, felicitated as a Four Star puja at the awards ceremony of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja on Thursday evening. 

 ?This is not a contest, but an all-round effort to organise our greatest festival in a more humane way,? master of ceremonies Biswanath Dasgupta had announced at the inception. And such confessions from the people who hold the Pujas exemplified the spirit behind the unique award. 

 Judges from all participating bodies ? PUBLIC, Red FM, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Calcutta Traffic Police and West Bengal Fire services other than The Telegraph and CESC ? had ranked the participants not on the basis of bright lights and decorated pandals, but for the effort they had put in to take care of their visitors and neighbours.

 The organisers had come equipped with plans of how they would try to make a difference in life around them with the prize money. Thus Five Star Kalighat Milan Sangha pledged to start a night-coaching camp for children of sex-workers and patuas in the neighbourhood. They had bought a microscope with the Rs 10,000 they had received the year before and started a malaria-detection clinic.

 Educationist Barry O?Brien, a moving force behind the award, related how years ago an Italian acquaintance had escaped the city during the Puja, calling his experience ?disastrous?. ?This year, he had revisited Calcutta in Puja time. He SMSd his reaction, again in a single word ? brilliant. This is the change we are striving for.?

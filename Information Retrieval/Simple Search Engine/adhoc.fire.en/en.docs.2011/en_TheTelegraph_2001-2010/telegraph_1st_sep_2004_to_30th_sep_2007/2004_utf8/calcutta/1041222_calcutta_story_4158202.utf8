 Manpower drift hits IT units

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With more and more IT giants setting up operations in the city, retaining human resources is increasingly getting difficult for the smaller outfits. 

 Arnab Debnath, chief executive officer of Anshinsoft Corp ? a city-based start up ? has learnt it the hard way. Though the four-year-old company, which started its journey with just three employees, has ramped up to 80 and drawing up expansion plans, Debnath?s biggest worry is human resources. 

 ?We are into high-end technology and so it is difficult to get the right kind of people. And in most of the cases, we lose them to bigger players after training them up. We are trying to sort these problem out,? said Debnath, during the inauguration of the company?s new office in Infinity Tower II in Salt Lake Electronics Complex. 

 Rolling out the expansion plan, he said the new set-up of 10,000 sq ft would accommodate more than 150 people. According to the plans, the number would go up to that level in a year?s time.

 State IT minister Manab Mukherjee, present at the programme, shared Debnath?s concern on the human resource challenges smaller IT companies are facing. 

 ?We want companies like Anshinsoft to do for Calcutta what Infosys, which also started out as a small company, did for Bangalore,? said Mukherjee.

 He stressed the importance of local success stories to make Calcutta one of the most attractive IT destinations in Asia. 

 Not just in terms of numbers, Anshinsoft is also planning to broaden its business domain and enter new markets and rope in new clients.

 Its existing list of clients includes names like Goldman Sachs, Nomura Securities, Toshiba and Hitcahi. The company expects to end the financial year with a revenue of around Rs 12 crore and is projecting a 50 per cent growth in the next financial year. 

 ?We entered the business with complete focus on the Japanese market and financial sector was our main domain. Now, we are expanding our operations in the US, Europe and other Southeast Asian countries,? added Debnath, who is very bullish of the company?s prospects in areas like digital media and radio frequency identification tag.

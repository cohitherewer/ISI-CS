The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Repair row in killer wheel wake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ananta Mahapatra may still have been alive on Friday had civic authorities paid heed to a police warning about road conditions in October.

 A day after 22-year-old Ananta and another unidentified passenger were crushed under a minibus which overturned after hitting a Shyambazar pothole and an elevated tram track, it emerged that city police had warned the civic and other authorities concerned about possible disaster zones on Calcutta?s cratered carriageway.

 At meetings with several agencies in early October, police submitted a list pinpointing nearly 100 stretches on roads-turned-death traps.

 ?The condition of the roads was clearly mentioned. We detailed the difficulties we were facing because of it,? said Arun Kumar Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, traffic department, on Friday.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said the Calcutta Municipal Corporation was ?not responsible for roads belonging to the public works department and the Calcutta Port Trust?. It will also not intervene on roads where trams ply, he added.

 The Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) is about to undertake extensive repairs on damaged tracks. ?We have allotted Rs 65 lakh in the first phase and work will begin early next week,? said S.N. Paul, CTC managing director, on Friday.

 Six areas ? including the MG Road-Central Avenue crossing, Judges? Court Road in Alipore, stretches of College Street and Park Circus ? would be addressed first. A Rs 53-crore proposal has been submitted to the government for repairs on tram tracks over the next five years.

 Roads with exposed tram tracks mentioned in the police report include:

 APC Roy Road

 BB Ganguly Street

 College Street

 Bidhan Sarani

 MG Road

 Galiff Street

 Rashbehari Avenue

 Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road

 Elliot Road

 The approach road to Belgachhia bridge

 Park Circus seven-point crossing

 Most mishaps occur on badly-maintained roads, according to a traffic department survey. ?Roads like Gariahat Road, Syed Amir Ali Avenue, Southern Avenue, CR Avenue, Sarat Bose Road or the EM Bypass are relatively accident free,? a senior officer said.

 Poor traffic conditions claimed another victim on Friday. Sanjay Das, 22, from Maheshtala was killed when a private bus knocked him down in front of Birla Planetarium around 8 am. Traffic constables rushed the youth to SSKM Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.

 This takes the road accident death tally to 351 this year, and up to five in the past 24 hours.

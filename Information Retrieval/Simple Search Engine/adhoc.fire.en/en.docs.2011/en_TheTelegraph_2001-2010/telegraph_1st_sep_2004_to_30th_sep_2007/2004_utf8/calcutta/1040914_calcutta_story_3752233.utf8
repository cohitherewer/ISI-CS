The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buddha or Bar for mayor flyovers

 - Minister?s rights jab unplugs Subrata venom

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee will seek the chief minister?s intervention to resolve the row over the civic body?s proposal to build two complementary flyovers at Esplanade and Gariahat. And if that fails, he will move court.

 The flyover dispute was kicked up by municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, who had claimed that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had no right to take a unilateral decision on the issue. The minister?s contention was that only the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) could decide on any infrastructure project in the city.

 Refusing to buy the logic, the mayor has claimed that as the roads on which the flyovers will come up belong to the civic body, it?s well within his rights to take a decision. 

 ?Why is the minister criticising us? He should, instead, praise us. The CMC has drawn up the Rs 50-crore proposal even after being denied its share of the motor vehicle tax,? Mukherjee said. 

 ?Since Independence, this is the first time that the civic body is not seeking any financial help from outside for such a major infrastructure project,? he asserted.

 Clarifying his stand, minister Bhattacharya told Metro on Monday: ?I am not against the proposed flyovers.? 

 But, he added, the Town amp; Country Planning Act clearly states that the CMDA is the only ?planning authority? for the Calcutta metropolitan area. No other authority, be it the government or the civic body, can take up any basic infrastructure project without consulting the CMDA.

 Besides, the minister stressed, the mayor should have first placed his proposal before the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Committee (CMPC) for discussion. 

 Countering the minister?s assertion, the mayor asked: ?How then could the transport department be allowed to construct the unplanned flyovers at Gariahat and Park Street?? 

 Had the transport department planned them properly, Mukherjee argued, there would have been no need for two more flyovers. 

 The Gariahat flyover has only displaced the traffic mess from the Gariahat crossing to Gol Park and the Hazra Road-Gariahat Road intersection. To clear the bottlenecks, the CMC wants to build a flyover that will connect Birla Mandir to Pantaloon store, with an extra arm descending on to Hazra Road, the mayor explained. 

 The northern end of the Park Street flyover, he said, will extend only up to Lindsay Street. ?Had the planners been a little more careful, they would have extended it to the CR Avenue-Bentick Street crossing,? Mukherjee said. 

 Once the flyover is commissioned, the Dorina crossing will turn into a perpetual traffic chaos. ?The civic body?s proposed flyover, between Peerless Inn and Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee?s statute, aims to clear the mess,? the mayor signed off.

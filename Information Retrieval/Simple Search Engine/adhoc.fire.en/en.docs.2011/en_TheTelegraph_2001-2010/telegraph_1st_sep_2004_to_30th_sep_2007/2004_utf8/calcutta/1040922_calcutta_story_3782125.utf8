 Celluloid sagas cash in on comic capers

(Top) Keanu Reeves in Constantine 

and (above) Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in Spider-Man 

 There?s Superman (Clark Kent) and Batman (Bruce Wayne), Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) and Catwoman (Selina Kyle). And then there?s Punisher (Frank Castle), Hellboy, Phantom (Kit Walker) Spawn (formerly Al Simmons), X-Man Wolverine (Logan) and Hulk (Dr Bruce Banner). They?re part of legend and folklore, but most of them are still enigmas. They may not all be wonderful, but they are all trying to save our world ? knowingly or not ? from the clutches of evil.

 Some we?ve all heard of (if Superman isn?t in your vocabulary, then you have been living on a different planet). A few we?ve grown up with (remember the Sunday morning cartoon slot first occupied by He-Man and then Spiderman?). And then there are some most of us have never heard of (not unless you?re part of an elite comics-consuming cult a la Elijah Wood in Shyamalan?s Unbreakable).

 Hollywood didn?t take long to realise the power of comics and gear up to exploit its immense potential. The result: a steady flow of blockbusters (okay, some were duds) that captured hearts, minds and more importantly, tasted box-office success across the globe.

 Welcome to the world of action comic books, led by Marvel and DC, and now making inroads is the Japanese form, the Manga (inspiration for the Matrix trilogy). 

 The characters that immediately come to mind are Superman, Batman and Spiderman, with several television series and films made on them. Human or not, superheroes have always been popular ? inspiring the good guys and terrorising the bad ones.

 While Superman is the all-American nice guy and invincible to red boot (faster than a speeding bullet et al), Batman is a brooding creature of the night orphaned in childhood. His methods are by no means perfect, but they are effective all right. 

 The Caped Crusader, however, has featured on screen more times (starting with Adam West on the small screen) than his contemporary from Metropolis. Superman, according to recent reports, is being revamped by DC Comics to make him less indestructible and a little more human. And Hollywood, of course, has advertised to fill the vacancy left by Christopher Reeves.

 Spiderman from the Marvel stable, though, is a little different from the two DC superheroes. The friendly neighbourhood saviour is actually a pimply, confused teenager, Peter Parker, who at first tried to use his new-found powers to make money. In fact, most Marvel characters are heroes with a twist. 

 Daredevil Matt Murdoch (made famous by Ben Affleck) is blind, while the towering Hulk (played by Eric Bana) is a misunderstood monster.

 Movies based on comic-book characters have been flooding the market lately. 

 Spider-Man 2 (Tobey Maguire?s claim to fame) and Catwoman (a struggling Halle Berry) have only recently done the rounds. Immediately prior to that, two lesser-known heroes ? Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and Punisher (A Russell Andrews) ? also came and went, though not really making the cash registers ring in town.

 So, it?s back to basics for Warner Bros, which plans to unleash the next ? and greatly anticipated ? instalment of Batman around June 2005. George Clooney?s disastrous outing Batman and Robin ensured that he would have to be replaced. 

 And with Michael Keaton (remember his stellar performances in Batman parts one and two?) not fit for the part anymore, a new face had to be launched.

 Christian Bale makes his debut in Batman Begins, which chronicles the transition from Bruce Wayne to Batman, exploring the unknown years. 

 Like the last film, Begins also features an all-star cast. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are a few of the familiar names on the list of this Christopher Nolan film.

 Also set to arrive in February next year, again courtesy Warner, is the hardly-known John Constantine, in the film Constantine. 

 Starring Keanu ?Neo? Reeves, the movie, based on DC?s Hellblazer graphic novels, is the story of an occult detective who has been to hell and back fighting demons. Keeping him company (and upping the glam quotient) is Rachel Weisz (remember her in diaphenous black in The Mummy films, at her scheming best in The Runaway Jury and in uniform to fight the Enemy at the Gates).

 On the alternative path, the countdown to three Manga releases has also begun. Hayao Miyazaki?s Howl?s Moving Castle (follow-up to the Oscar-winning Spirited Away), Mamoru Oshii?s sequel Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence and Katsushiro Otomo?s Steamboy are all being produced by big Hollywood banners. Though lacking American superhero stamina, Manga?s success in mainstream Hollywood rests largely on the success of these three animation films.

 And here?s the bonus ? films based on comic-books are not just for kids. The increasingly dark plots and dubious characters make them definitely adult. 

 It?s not just about saving the world any more, but more about knowing what makes it go round. Enjoy the show.

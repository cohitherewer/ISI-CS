 Jingle bells for festive fern

 It?s time to brush up your art and craft lessons to pep up Yuletide fun. Armed with colourful balloons, streamers, bells and balls, the annual exercise of dressing up Christmas trees is a good occasion to show off your creativity. 

 Here?s a Goodlife guide to the best sparkles in town in the run-up to fern fever.

Spot check: The one-stop destination to shop 

for anything related to Christmas decorations, from the basic tree to bells, balls, 

stars and angels, are the road-side shops on Free School Street. These are open 

from 10 am till 8.30 pm during this season and do brisk business on Sundays as 

well. Old New Market with its special Christmas market near the cannon is of course 

the other obvious destination. 

Tree talk: Christmas tree is the centre of 

all the fervour. In the absence of natural ferns, the closest one can get are 

the plastic and synthetic versions. ?We have two types of trees. Those imported 

from southeast Asian countries, made of hard washable plastic, and the desi 

stuff made of shiny paper, which doesn?t last all that long,? said Deepak, a salesman 

at Gifts Palace on Free School Street. 

 Christmas tree sizes vary from one 1 to 7 ft. While the imported ones are priced between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,000, the paper trees cost at least 10 times less and are priced at a maximum of Rs 200 for a 7 ft tree. 

Santa Story: In keeping with the size of the 

tree that you buy, you can pick up a Father Christmas doll as well. Priced between 

Rs 10 for the palm-sized versions and Rs 200 for a two-and-a-half feet Santa, 

the Free School Street fare has as good a finish as those available in more swanky 

malls. 

Jingle Bells: Special Christmas packets containing 

bells, balls and small stars are available for anything above Rs 50. These come 

in silver, gold, electric blue, pink and yellow, and are priced between Rs 24 

and Rs 48. 

 Large paper stars and bells that can be filled with coloured thermocol balls and candies to entertain kids are also quite popular. These are priced at Rs 45 onwards. 

Fern frills: Some ribbons and streamers are 

what you need for that extra jazz. Among the new entrants this year are the 9 

ft long elastic streamers in shiny paper and snazzy colours. These are priced 

at Rs 45 per piece. The other option is a glittering rope of electric bulbs priced 

at Rs 60 per piece. The classic paper streamers in various colours are priced 

at Rs 18 a dozen. 

Foam fun: To make the traveller from the North 

Pole feel perfectly at home, pick up a bottle of foam spray for Rs 60, that caps 

off the party fun to fine effect.

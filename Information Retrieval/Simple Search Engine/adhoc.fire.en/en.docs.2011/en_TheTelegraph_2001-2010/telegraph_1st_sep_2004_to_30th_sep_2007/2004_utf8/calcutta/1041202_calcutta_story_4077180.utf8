Screen On amp; Off

Mariah Carey: New challenge

 She has been down but never out. Popstar Mariah Carey is back with a bang, announcing the title of her new album, The Emancipation of Mimi, to be released on March 21. She admits on her official website that she didn?t really want to disclose the title this early. ?So obviously, my album title has leaked out way before I intended. The single isn?t even out yet... hello!?

 Mariah is worried that her fans may not understand the title and offers an explanation. ?Knowing that the title was very different for me and might cause some confusion, I had a whole explanation to go along with the press release which was supposed to come out in February, but basically that got foiled.?

 So who is Mimi? ?Mimi is a very personal nickname only used by those closest to me... just one of those little things that I?ve kept for myself in an attempt to have some delineation between a public persona and a private life,? is how Mariah puts it. ?By naming the album The Emancipation of Mimi I am letting my guard down and inviting my fans to be that much closer to me.?

 But it is also about the evolution of Mariah Carey, the singer. ?Most importantly, I am celebrating the fact that I?ve grown into a person, an artiste who no longer feels imprisoned by insecurities or is compelled to try and live up to someone else?s vision of Mariah Carey. I now feel I can honestly say ?this is me, the real me, take it or leave it?. For the first time in my life, I feel free and unashamed to be who I really am? And that?s what the music of this album and its title reflect.?

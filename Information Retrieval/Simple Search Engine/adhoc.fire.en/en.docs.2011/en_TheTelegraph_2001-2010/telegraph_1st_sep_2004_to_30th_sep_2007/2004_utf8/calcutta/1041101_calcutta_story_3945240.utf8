 Parking plans for snarl-free roads

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Faced with regular traffic snarls because of unregulated parking of taxis and private cars in and around Howrah, the civic authorities are working on a proposal to construct a number of parking lots by the year-end.

 ?We have identified certain pockets for setting up parking lots to accommodate autorickshaws, taxis, private cars and other vehicles. This will help reduce traffic congestion in the city. Vehicles from outside add to our woes. Proper parking arrangement can help us get rid of the problem,? Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) mayor Gopal Mukherjee said on Sunday.

 The civic body, he informed, has consulted experts on how to construct parking lots in a congested city like Howrah. Police, too, have been consulted. 

 According to Mukherjee, the corporation will earn a substantial amount as revenue from the proposed parking lots. Around 200,000 vehicles come to the city from across the state and beyond daily.

 Police superintendent Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya has assured the HMC of all possible help in setting up the parking zones. ?In fact, traffic cops are the worst sufferers in the present situation. The civic body?s decision is a step in the right direction,? he observed. 

 Officers of Golabari, Howrah, Shibpur and Malipanchghora police stations are always overburdened as they are required to attend to traffic problems along with maintaining law and order.

 ?If vehicles coming from outside are parked properly, the burden on policemen will lessen a lot,? Bhattacharya added. 

 A recent survey by the district police reveals that the roads in the city, especially in the north and central regions, are becoming narrower because of illegal parking of vehicles. 

 Civic officials said a parking lot was constructed for goods vehicles three years ago. But it remains largely unutilised as it is away from the main road.

 ?We have, however, made it a point for all goods vehicles have to be parked there,? a senior official said. 

 Autorickshaws and taxis will be allowed in the new parking lots as they create the maximum traffic chaos. 

 Nemai Samanta, district CITU secretary, said the new arrangement, by ensuring systematic parking places, will automatically improve the traffic situation in the city and its adjoining areas. 

 In another development, the civic body has set about repairing the damaged roads. 

 The HMC has already allotted Rs 50 lakh for the project. ?We have notified the roads in 11 wards and tenders have already been floated,? informed mayor-in-council member Mamata Jaiswal. 

 Officials said the road around Howrah station will also be renovated with concrete pads. 

 ?We have approached the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority for funds. They have not yet approved the proposal,? Jaiswal said.

 ?We will be able to repair the damaged roads in the station with concrete pads only if a lump sum amount is sanctioned,? he added.

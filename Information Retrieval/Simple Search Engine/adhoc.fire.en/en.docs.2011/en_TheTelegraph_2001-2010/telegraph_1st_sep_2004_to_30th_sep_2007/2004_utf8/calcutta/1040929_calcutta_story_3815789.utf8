 ?Sir, where do you get water when everything freezes in winter?? ?Do the students have to learn shooting?? It was quite a volley of questions that Lieutenant Aashish Malhotra faced from students at South Point High School on Tuesday. But building bridges by exchanging ideas and emotions is what Operation Sadbhavana has set out to achieve.

 Forty-two children from schools in the Drass sector of Kargil district (the second coldest place in the world) were visiting the school under Malhotra?s stewardship. ?We received a call from the Army yesterday, seeking permission to bring the kids. They live in such isolation that it is a great idea to introduce them to the rest of the country,? principal J. Solomon said, welcoming the little ones.

 The students had a party. Over the past two days they had their fill of Eden Gardens, Metro Rail, the Ganga, Aquatica and Taj Bengal. But it was Science City that pleased them most. ?We learnt so much about chand sitare,? the sunburnt faces beamed. 

 Life along the LoC is tough, with school remaining closed in winter. The war had made things worse. Uilayat Ali?s cousin was sitting near the door when a shell burst near the school. She suffered splinter injuries. Thenceforth, they stopped classes in rooms facing the LoC. Sometimes classes took place in bunkers. ?Once, gas from a bomb blew off our plastic roof,? recalled Bilal Ahmed of Class VI. The children do not have much to say on the philosophy of war but one thing they are sure of is that Pakistan started it.

 As soon as the strains of the South Point song and then Phir bhi dil hai Hindustani sung by the Kashmiri children faded (take a bow, Shah Rukh Khan), the city students surrounded their guests. ?What is your favourite food?? ?We eat whatever we get.? Sundry other queries followed.

 By the time, they had taken a tour of the school library, they had changed their opinion of the best place visited. Perhaps Lucknow, their next stop, will have more curiosities waiting.

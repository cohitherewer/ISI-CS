The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Puja halt on health, courier services

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 

 Saptami evening. Cancer-stricken Amalendu Choudhury was desperate to get a blood test done before he could resume oral chemotherapy. But not a single diagnostic centre was open.

 An immobile Choudhury called up a few big hospitals, but was told that the sample could not be collected before Monday, that is, after four full holidays. Left with hardly any choice, Choudhury is now going without medication.

 With the festive spirit at its peak, almost all essential services in the city have shut down, leaving Calcuttans in the lurch. While diagnostic centres have declared their decision to keep their shutters down till Sunday, clinics are not ready to promise anything till Dashami. 

 ?Sorry, we will start collecting blood samples only on Monday, even if there is an emergency,? said an employee at Wockhardt Hospital and Kidney Institute. Most pharmacies have done the same.

 Another victim of the festive fever is Rakesh Mohan, 26-year-old employee of a city-based multinational firm. He has just landed a job with a Los Angeles-based firm with offices in Delhi. Mohan was asked to courier an ?urgent letter? to Delhi, but could not because the courier services have all suspended operations till Sunday.

 ?Sorry we can?t help you. Since we are closed till Dashami and the next day being Sunday, you can send it only on Monday,? said an agent for Blue Dart Courier at Tollygunge. Mohan tried to explain to them the urgency of the matter, but without effect.

 As in the case of Mohan, the plea of Gautam Matthew, who was trying to send an urgent letter to his employer in Coimbatore, was rejected. Matthew had tried Desk to Desk Courier (DTDC), Nightingale, First Flight and all the other prominent courier services, without any success. 

 ?They simply slammed the door on me. Celebration is fine, but what about an emergency?? wondered Matthew. 

 A DTDC spokesman in Calcutta said they had accepted orders till ?late afternoon on Wednesday (Saptami), but would resume operations only after Dashami. Everything is closed. Our employees, too, need to celebrate the Pujas, don?t they?? he said.

 The festive fever has hit public telephone booths, too. Sayantani Ganguly found all the STD/ISD booths in her Garia neighbourhood shut on Thursday. 

 ?Since I do not have STD facilities at my residence, I thought I would call up Bangalore and speak to my husband, who is ill, but I found all booths closed,? she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Not a dull moment in carnival countdown

Reshmi Sengupta, Zeeshan Jawed

When 

there?s fusion music and twinkle toes for company, a fast dipping mercury hardly 

matters. Audiences at The Telegraph 31st Nite countdown celebrations at 

CC amp;FC on Wednesday saw Bharatanatyam dancer Shobana kick up a storm along 

with tabla player Tanmoy Bose. With his Taaltantra team ? comprising Sourav 

Roy on keyboards, Ratul Shankar on percussion, Ryan Shah on drums, Moinak on bass 

guitar ? Tanmoy played pieces combining instruments and vocal recitals by Supratik 

and Deboshree.

As Tanmoy swerved back and forth from the tabla 

to the darbuka, Violin Brothers Deb and Jyoti Shankar joined in, along 

with Debashish Bhattacharya on the guitar. The group belted out a five-beat cycle 

with which Tanmoy performed konakol, a form of recitation practiced in 

North Africa. This was followed by Trinetram, a three-piece raag-based 

composition with the Violin Brothers.

Four recitals into the show, Tanmoy made way for Bharatanatyam 

dancer Shobana to display some of her deft footwork. The lead actress of Pamela 

Rooks? Dance Like A Man kicked up a storm dancing to a track performed 

by Taaltantra. She mesmerised audiences with her second recital, a thumri 

piece set on Krishna Leela, portraying a wide range of emotions. In the 

third piece, arranged by Taufiq, Shobana fused Bharatnatyam with folk dance. 

Tanmoy sprung a surprise in the end by bringing in 

dhaki Gokul Das to perform the traditional instrument along with Taaltantra, 

before wrapping up the show with a Salsa number.

Bare bash

Calcutta doesn?t believe in waiting with bated breath 

for the final night of the year. The countdown to The Telegraph 31st Nite 

at Saturday Club on Wednesday was rocking harder than ever.

?The countdown has proved that city spirits only soar 

higher. People want more fun and I am going to ensure that nobody leaves without 

their share,? winked resident DJ Feroze.

The East-meets-West party kicked off at 8.30 in the 

evening with local band Barefoot belting out old favourites like Summer of 

69 and Country roads. Nostalgia was the mood of the moment and requests 

were flying thick and fast. 

DJ Feroze conquered the console next, churning out 

the latest hits. ?I know the taste of the crowd here and I am going to play some 

hardcore Hindi masala music after they are done with the English numbers. 

And yes, the title track of Dhoom, which has ruled the roost this season, 

is going to be there as well, but in my style,? signed off the console king.

Face-off

Mask, mask, who?s the fairest of them all?wondered 

revellers at the masquerade ball on Wednesday at Cloud 9. The restobar at The 

Astor witnessed beautiful party people put their wicked face forward in the run- 

up to the big night on December 31. 

The guests were offered a choice of colourful masks 

that only revealed the twinkle in their eyes as they grinned wider than ever. 

Painters and artists present added to the colourful celebrations with guests queuing 

up to sport funky tattoos. 

?The city is already bursting at the seams with live 

bands and exotic dancers, so we thought of providing some innovative relief,? 

smiled Saurav Chatterjee, CEO High Life, the event management company that organised 

the event.

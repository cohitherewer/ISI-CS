The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Puja package with private player 

A tryst with Bengal tradition

 - Five-day, Rs 22,000 festival bonanza to project city in all its splendour

 A STAFF REPORTER

 DEVI DESTINATION: A blend of culture and luxury has been lined up to boost the city?s tourist traffic pie

 The sales pitch has never been louder in Left-ruled Bengal. If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is hard-selling the state?s business potential to industry captains, the tourism department has joined hands with a private player to package the Puja and sell it to both domestic and international tourists, at a premium.

 Blending culture and luxury, the state tourism department and a city-based organisation have scooped up a five-day Puja tourism project between October 19 and 23. The idea (as reported in Metro last month) is to boost the city?s present ? and pathetic ? 3.9 per cent share of the country?s international tourist traffic pie.

 Calcutta Mahotsav, the five-day combo of fun and excitement along with meals, five-star accommodation and travel expenses, will come for a price ? pegged at $ 750 for foreign tourists and Rs 22,000 for domestic travellers.

 ?The government is unable to carry out something like this by itself. So, we will offer Happenings our infrastructure,? tourism minister Dinesh Dakua said on Wednesday, while announcing the Puja tourism project in association with Happenings, a part of Calcutta Promotions Pvt Ltd.

 ?Our idea is to project the city in all its splendour during the Pujas,? said Shankar Roy Chowdhury, former chief of staff, Indian Army, who is also chairman of the advisory board of Happenings.

 Tourists will enjoy classical, modern and folk concerts, visits to puja pandals and a view of rituals, ranging from sindur khela to immersion in the Hooghly.

 The tryst with Bengal?s tradition will be topped with mouth-watering regional cuisine and leisure activities, like golf, shopping in city markets and visits to museums and art galleries.

 The cultural extravaganza will include Bikram Ghosh?s Drums of the East, featuring a variety of drums that are played in Bengal, Manipur, Mizoram and other Northeastern states.

 A three-day dance festival ? with performances by experts in various Indian dance forms ? will be a major draw, claimed the organisers. 

 The other attractions will be a three-day arts mela at the Bharatiyam complex, in Salt Lake, a visit to Vedic Village and a river cruise to Belur.

 ?A lot of research went into planning the programme and for the past three months, we have been trying our best to market it,? said Shyam Agarwal, one of the promoters of Happenings. 

 ?We organised something like this last year as well, but the scale will be bigger this time, as we have formally tied up with the government,? Agarwal added. 

 The response has been ?satisfactory?, claimed the organisers, with 60 tourists already signing on for the ?landmark? tourism project, which can accommodate around 100 bookings. 

 ?We have even involved the Consulting Club of Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, to work out strategies to make the concerts and shows successful,? added Agarwal. 

 ?A typical foreign tourist spends around $500 for a five-day stay in the city. Our aim is to bring 10,000 such tourists over the next five years, so that $ 5 million is spent in Calcutta during Durga Puja,? summed up Roy Chowdhury.

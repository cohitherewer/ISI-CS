 Duo in net for morning-walker kidnap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two more persons were arrested on Monday on the charge of abducting a businessman who had gone for his constitutional in front of the Victoria Memorial Hall early last Wednesday. Both youths, in their early 20s, confessed to their crime during grilling.

 Businessman S. Rajgharia was abducted by a gang of six armed men while walking along Casuarina Avenue around 4.30 am. 

 The kidnappers called up his Pretoria Street residence and demanded a ransom of Rs 50 lakh. The sum was scaled down to Rs 2 lakh and Rajgharia?s family brought him back after paying the ransom. Later, one of the gangsters, Uttam, was arrested in the Mahestala area.

 ?We arrested Vishal Chakroborty and Asim Dey in the Mahestala area on Monday, on the basis of information provided by Uttam. Mastermind Madan is still at large,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 According to detective department officers, Madan, who once used to drive police vehicles at Metiabruz police station, formed a gang a few months ago, along with some criminals. ?He has already earned a lot of money within a short span of six months,? said an official.

 After arresting the duo, both school dropouts, sleuths learnt how they had blown a major part of the money. ?They spent a good part of the ransom on liquor and fun. After getting the Rs 2 lakh in cash on Thursday, they went straight to a red-light area and spent the day there,? said an official of detective department. Then they went to a posh restaurant. ?They spent at least Rs 50,000 that day,? said the sleuth.

 According to the trio, they had kept a close watch on morning-walkers at Victoria. 

 ?They were looking for a rich and aged person who comes alone. They decided to zero in on Rajgharia and checked out his residence to ascertain his financial status,? said the official. 

 Vishal, one of the arrested kidnappers who is the son of a contractor, said the gang had selected the businessman in his 70s to ensure a smooth operation. 

 ?We did not face any trouble when we dragged him into our Tata Sumo,? he said.

Designer shimmer for D-day

Brides-to-be 

will do better to think sexy than demure this season if you take designer Shantanu 

Goenka?s word on it. Still retaining the ?opulent look? in flared lehngas 

as opposed to the more contemporary tapered bottoms to ?outshine the rest of the 

jing bang at a wedding?, Shantanu has experimented with the uppers in the ensemble 

to come up with corset-style cholis, shorter and more revealing with deeper 

necklines.

To be showcased at the forthcoming Bridal Asia Show 

on September 21 in Delhi, Shantanu?s new collection experiments not just with 

cuts but with colours and motifs as well. The traditional reds, maroons and oranges 

have given way to coral and aquamarine shades of blue and green along with topaz, 

sapphire and emerald colours. The shine and shimmer of zardosi and gold 

is traded for antique embroidery in matching threads, jazzed up with crystals 

and beads. Indian bels and butis take a beating since the motifs 

used borrow from antique European designs like English tapestry and French brocade 

with floral themes ruling the roost. 

Fabrics are flowy with mainly chiffons and georgettes 

combined with a variety of silks. 

But is the average Indian bride game for a few raised 

eyebrows on the big day? ?A number of NRIs are looking for a healthy blend of 

the Indian and western elements to lend a touch of novelty to their bashes,? said 

Shantanu. 

Saris, kurtas, robes and dupattas are 

other components from the designer?s stable for pre-wedding bashes, bridal showers 

and those numerous rituals that make Indian weddings the phenomenon that Bridal 

Asia shows draw from.

Needle niche

A stitch in time now saves 10. That?s exactly the 

number of embroidery techniques, from various parts of the country, being showcased 

at RajGharana Sarees on 87L Park Street. 

From the elegance of Parsi needlework of Kashmir to 

the opulence of zardosi, the saris tell an intricate story of the varied 

richness of Indian craftsmanship. 

While the ikkat from Andhra Pradesh and the 

chikan work from Lucknow are household names, the store is a good place 

to get acquainted with more exotic crafts like the kamti work from Gujarat 

(a unique blend of mirrors and threads) to the ethnic east Madhubani stitch from 

Bihar (heavy thread work on silks). 

Those who thought kundan work was limited to 

jewellery will be in for a pleasant surprise to see the multi-coloured gemstones 

from Jaipur adorn the drapes in combination with a lavish network of threads. 

Kantha stitch from Bengal feature prominently in the collection as well.

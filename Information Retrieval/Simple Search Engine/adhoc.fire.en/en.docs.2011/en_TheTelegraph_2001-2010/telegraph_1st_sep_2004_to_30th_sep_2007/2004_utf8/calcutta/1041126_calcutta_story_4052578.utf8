Chit Ch@t

Giant-sized fun

He is, undoubtedly, one of the best-known children?s 

authors of the 20th century. Roald Dahl has spun wild tales beyond most people?s 

imaginations, like Witches, and heart-warming stories like Danny the 

Champion of the World. Some have been made into successful films, like Matilda 

and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. But connoisseurs know that there?s 

a whole lot more. One of the lesser-known and most enjoyable Roald Dahl books 

is The BFG, short for Big Friendly Giant. The loveable big guy kidnaps 

little Sophie and takes her to giant land, but in his gibberish tongue, he explains 

that he won?t harm her. Together, the two friends end up getting the RAF and the 

Queen of England to help them in their quest to save children from being gobbled 

up by giants...

Trendsetters

A couple of decades ago, Beijing was a sea of drab 

Maoist suits. China?s biennial fashion week has played a part in changing the 

scene. Young and trendy was the trademark at the just-concluded China Fashion 

Week in Beijing, showcasing the spring/ summer 2005 collection. The designers 

were as young as they come, including students from Beijing Institute of Clothing 

Technology. So were the outfits and the models (the girl, left, was one of several 

kids).

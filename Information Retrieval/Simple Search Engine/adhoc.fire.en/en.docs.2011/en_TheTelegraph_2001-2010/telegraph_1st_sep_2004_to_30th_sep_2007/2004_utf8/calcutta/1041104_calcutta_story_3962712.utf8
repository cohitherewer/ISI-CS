The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Take-off signal for twin flyovers

 OUR BUREAU

 Two flyovers, meant to accelerate traffic movement, will be flagged off this month. The right-turn flyover at the Chingrihata-Salt Lake Bypass crossing will be commissioned on November 8. The Lake Gardens flyover is slated to be opened by the end of this month.

 ?The right-turn flyover is all set to be commissioned in accordance with plans. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will inaugurate it,? Alapan Bandopadhyay, chief executive officer, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), said on Wednesday. 

 The flyover will allow a smooth entry into Salt Lake for vehicles moving towards Rajarhat New Town. ?The flyover was handed over to us by Tantia Constructions within the stipulated time, the steep rise in steel prices notwithstanding. However, citing the same reason, Senbo has delayed various flyover projects,? an official said.

 According to CMDA engineers, the 550-m flyover was a technically trying task. ?It is an S-shaped flyover and is built over a canal,? said an official. Moreover, it was a multi-agency project, involving various state government departments. All these, the officials said, caused a few months? delay. ?However, compared to other flyover projects, which are behind schedule by years, this delay is negligible,? a senior urban development department officer said. 

 The Lake Gardens flyover is also set for commissioning this month. ?Work on the flyover is almost finished and it should be ready for commissioning by November-end,? a public works department (PWD) official said. 

 PWD minister Amar Chowdhury, CMDA CEO Bandopadhyay and railway engineers conducted an inspection of the flyover on Wednesday and later held a meeting. ?The railways today promised that they will complete their part of the project in a few days,? the official said.

 Construction of the Lake Gardens flyover was delayed due to problems related to the relocation of a food department godown and of an information and cultural affairs department studio. 

 The project was taken up in January 1995. The original project cost of Rs 24 crore has shot up to Rs 38 crore.

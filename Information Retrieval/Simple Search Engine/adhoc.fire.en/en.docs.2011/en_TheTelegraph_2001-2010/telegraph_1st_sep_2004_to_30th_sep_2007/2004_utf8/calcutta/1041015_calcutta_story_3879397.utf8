 If wishes were horses...

 Wishes are important in everyones life. However, most of us do not have the power to confront our wishes. Only a few among us, like Dipankar and Deblina who examine and analyse life in all its depth and profundity, have the opportunity to be face-to-face with their wishes. When this happens, life ceases to be monotonous and takes on a dramatic turn. Life becomes full of colour and excitement, and its characters are charged with a passion and vitality. When wishes become tangible, there is wish fulfilment, and with it unfolds the drama of life in all its colours; sometimes bright, sometimes sombre. Ritwik?s Ichchhapuran is like a modern mythology in the way it blends reality and fantasy to build a picture of life. Flashes of truth strike us in bursts as we are taken on a fascinating journey along with the characters of the play. Sometimes our imagination soars along with the characters and we find ourselves sailing towards an endless, dream-like horizon, transporting us to a realm where our wishes want us to be.

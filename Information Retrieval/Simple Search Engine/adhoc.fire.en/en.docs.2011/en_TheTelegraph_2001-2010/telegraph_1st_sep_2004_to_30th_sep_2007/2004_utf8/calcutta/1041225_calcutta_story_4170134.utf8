 Prince Anwar Shah-Nimtala, Dhakuria-BBD Bag and Peerless Hospital-Shyambazar 

minibuses are not going via Southern Avenue these days as they previously used 

to. Since all three routes pass through the business district of the city, many 

rely solely on them to reach their offices. Now, residents of Southern Avenue 

have to go all the way to Gol Park or Gariahat to take these buses. Even if it 

is a temporary change, it would be very convenient if the buses take a route which 

is easier to access for Southern Avenue residents.

 As per a recent order of the Supreme Court, all primary schools of the country 

are supposed to provide mid-day meals to the students. However, in many schools, 

teachers have to double as cooks or arrange for the food. This may affect the 

quality of teaching. Besides, the cooking of liquid or semi-liquid dishes may 

prove unhygienic, as proper water supply is necessary for the purpose. Wouldn?t 

it be better if dry food packets are distributed amongst the students during tiffin 

time? The government may engage a contractor to supply these food packets in the 

schools.

 Letters addressed to the Governor are received at the Raj Bhavan gate only 

between 2.30 pm and 3.30 pm. Since it may not always be possible for the common 

man to strictly adhere to these timings, I appeal to the Governor to extend it 

from 10 am to 5 pm. This will also help an office-goer to drop a letter at the 

gate on his way to or back from work. 

 Mohan Lal Sarkar,

 Most visitors to Rabindra Sadan and Nandan have to cross the Chowringhee-AJC 

Bose Road intersection. However, I have noticed that buses, trucks and other vehicles 

tend to violate traffic rules at this crossing often. They speed through the crossing 

just when the traffic light is about to turn red to avoid getting caught in the 

signal. It appears that the traffic control system at this crossing is lacking. 

I request the traffic authorities to deploy more policemen there. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

 Generally, all pharmacies in a locality observe their weekly holiday on the 

same day. In case of an emergency, this turns out to be a matter of life and death. 

Since medicines are essential items, the association of drug retailers should 

make it mandatory that at least one of the shops in every locality should remain 

open on any given day. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

Behala.

 Security scurry on campus

 - Fake marksheet revelations send CU on vigilance drive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An organised racket in fake marksheets operating in the city, certain sensational revelations and, finally, a string of arrests.

 Seemingly wise after the event, Calcutta University (CU) has decided to go on an unprecedented security overdrive. 

 ?We have two objectives for initiating the drive. On the one hand, we want to prevent students with fake marksheets from taking admission to our under-graduate and post-graduate courses,? a senior official of the university said.

 ?On the other, we want to prevent fake marksheets being issued in the name of our university by some organisations and agencies in and outside Calcutta,? he added. 

 The university will write to all its 165 affiliated colleges, asking them to cross-check all marksheets and other documents submitted by candidates seeking admission to the under-graduate courses. 

 The colleges will be asked to strictly follow all admission-related guidelines of the university, particularly ones that say that the institutions must consider all admissions as ?provisional?. 

 To check the marksheet racket, officials are considering a scrutiny of a few ?correspondence colleges? that have been cashing in on the university?s brand name. 

 ?The college authorities have been asked to be extremely vigilant while dealing with admissions,? said CU registrar Ujjwal Kumar Basu.

 ?They have also been instructed to physically check the documents on the basis of the training imparted to officials by the university,? registrar Basu added.

 This, according to university officials, will include a verification of the colour, thickness and other secret features that go in the making of an original marksheet. 

 If the college authorities observed certain anomalies, the documents could be sent to the university?s verification department for a final check, CU officials explained.

 At the department, professionals would be able to tell in a moment if the marksheets are genuine or not. 

 Police inquiring into the marksheet racket claimed that the new version of the fake marksheets would stump even trained eyes. 

 Officers claim that it was found that some fake marksheets even carry the secret UV code-line.

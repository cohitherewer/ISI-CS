The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boycott on law campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Agitating students of Calcutta University?s Law College on Hazra Road, backed by Students? Federation of India (SFI) activists, boycotted classes on Tuesday, bringing academic activities to a halt for the second day in a row.

 The students alleged that the ?negative attitude? of dean of the institution and faculty head Imtiaz Gulam Ahmed was hampering their studies. They demanded his immediate removal.

 On Monday, the students had boycotted classes after a section of them held a sit-in, demanding action against dean Ahmed.

 ?We submitted an open letter stating our demands to the dean on Tuesday. The teachers had come to the university, but the students, who support our cause, left without attending classes,? said students? union general secretary Prem Kumar Singh. 

 ?The SFI is supporting us, but this is really an agitation of the students of the college. We will not back out until our demands are met. The dean told us today that we can do whatever we want to, but the consequences will be drastic,? Singh added.

 College authorities claimed that a section of students owing allegiance to the SFI had locked up the classrooms and had prevented the teachers and students from attending classes. 

 Officials alleged that the students? union started the agitation after strict invigilation rules were enforced during a recent examination.

 ?It is unfortunate that the students are making unjustified demands. The agitation comes at a time when we had almost succeeded in streamlining the system. All our efforts have gone in vain,? dean Ahmed lamented. 

 According to college officials, the Ll.B and Ll.M classes were on in full swing till Saturday and the agitation will hamper lessons at a time when the teachers are struggling to wrap up the syllabi.

 College officials said that the university authorities had been informed in detail about the situation on the Hazra Road campus. ?We are hoping that the students will call off the agitation. Necessary action will be taken if they continue to disrupt classes,? an official said.

 Several students were ?reported against? for using unfair means during the Ll.B examination in July-August. Most of them failed to clear their names before the disciplinary committee and that was the reason behind the agitation, the official explained. 

 The college, which functions as Calcutta University?s law department, is 20-plus years old and has about 900 students in the five-year Ll.B and two-year Ll.M courses.

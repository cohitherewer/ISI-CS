 Girl freed from employers

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY AND JULIUS GOMES 

 Guria: Scarred

 She is all of nine, yet Santanu Banerjee, a World Health Organisation officer, and his wife, a teacher, beat her and kicked her continuously over a period of two years. 

 They even struck her with a knife recently.

 Guria?s agony ended only on Sunday, when a group of neighbours barged in and rescued her from the clutches of her employers. Surprisingly, her rescuers did not lodge an FIR against the Banerjees.

 ?We received a call from Sruti Ghosh, one of our students who lives in the same housing estate, about the little girl being tortured. We rescued her,? said Christine D?Rozario Gupta, project coordinator of a home for destitute girls at Loreto Day School, Sealdah.

 ?Guria has suffered severe trauma and is scarred both mentally and physically,? she added.

 Residents of AF-228, Rabindra Palli, in the Kestopur area of Rajarhat police station, were used to hearing the occasional wail or the sound of incessant weeping emanating from the first-floor flat of the estate. 

 Unable to restrain themselves any further on Sunday, they knocked on Santanu Banerjee?s door and told him to lay his hands off maidservant Surita Kumari Singh, alias Guria. 

 Guria?s tale of woe began two years ago in her native Ranchi. Banerjee, who works at Bikash Bhavan, his wife Piu and their only son Sanju, 5, had visited Ranchi then, and engaged Guria with her mother?s permission to perform minor household chores. 

 ?They forced me to perform all the household work, from swabbing the floor to doing the dishes, washing clothes and even tending to the child. I was given only two chapattis with some sugar every day for meals,? said Guria. 

 ?On top of that, she was brutally beaten every day, the scars on her face and body bear witness to the torture she went through,? D?Rozario Gupta added.

 Piu, principal of a local kindergarten, was responsible for a number of welts running down Guria?s back and the pinch marks on her face. 

 She had hit Guria on the head with a knife on a previous occasion, for which the girl had received two stitches. 

 Earlier, neighbours had warned Banerjee to cease torturing the girl, but to no avail. Asked about the incident, Banerjee claimed he had been framed. He admitted he had beaten Guria but the welts, he said, were rat bites.

 Appearing before a division bench of Calcutta High Court, advocate-general Balai Ray submitted on Friday that urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya had not made any adverse comment, as published in a section of the media, on the judiciary and its role in administrative matters.

 he court had asked Ray whether minister Bhattacharya had made the remarks during a press conference on October 12. ?The ministers secretary has sent a letter stating that the minister did not make any adverse comment on the judiciary, as published in some city-based dailies, including The Telegraph,? said Ray. 

 he court then asked the dailies to submit their versions of the minister?s reported remarks on November 24, when the matter will come up for hearing again.

 The body of a 55-year-old man, identified as Nisith Baran Ghosh, was found in a room of a hotel on Prafulla Sarkar Street, in the Bowbazar police station area. ?The body was stiff, indicating that Ghosh had died at least four hours earlier,? said Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 resident of Krishnagar, Ghosh had checked into the hotel with a woman on Thursday afternoon. In the hotel register, her name was entered as Mili, Ghosh?s wife. The woman left the hotel around 6.30 am and has not been seen since.

 he body has been sent for post-mortem. 

 The CID said on Friday that gynaecologist Susil Pal?s killing was premeditated. Those who beat him to death knew exactly what they were up to ? reason enough for the investigating officers to lodge a case under Section 302 IPC (murder). ?We have found evidence to support our suspicion that the doctor was repeatedly beaten on the lower half of his body, till his scrotum burst and kidneys were damaged,? said R.K. Mohanty, additional director-general of police (CID).

A cancer patient, he had left for Mumbai for a check-up on September 13, keeping his house at Mata Mohonmohini Nagar locked. The coins in a bag were kept in the kitchen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Florence flavours fly in

 Steaming pastas and risottos find their way straight from the pan on to hungry plates under a chef?s expert eye, while diners sit content in the happy glow of a wood-fired oven, warm browns and burnt copper?

 La Cucina is a cosy kitchen with ?home-style cooking?. The long-awaited Italian restaurant at the Hyatt Regency is finally ready, and should be in business by Friday. 

 With final touches to d?cor awaited and service styles being perfected, the 350-sq-m space on the first floor of the property fits right into the five-star?s flavour, with muted d?cor, understated class and quality food.

North Italian food is the focus of the menu here, 

with chef Davide Cananzi (in picture above by Rashbehari Das), brought in earlier 

this year from Florence, at its helm.

 An interactive kitchen is at the heart of this beautiful eatery (as it should be ?La Cucina literally translates to ?the kitchen?). The chef?s team of eight prepare the main course before the guests. The antipasti table and dessert spread are the only pre-cooked elements here.

 Even more intimate options are a private dining room and a chef?s table. ?The chef?s table accommodates six diners, to be served by the chef himself, not waiters. We personally take them through the meal,? smiles Cananzi.

 Guests can also let their hair down at an attached lounge for 12. A selection of fine wines, aperitifs and other beverages can be had here, before or after meals, exclusively for those who come to the restaurant. 

 ?Around 50 per cent of our wines are from Italy, with others from France, Chile and California. We have not kept Indian wines on the menu to keep to the Continental theme,? says general manager Timothy Bruce.

 The Calcutta client will take to the authentic fare, hopes Hyatt. ?The Italian food in India is influenced by the American or English version. In Calcutta at least, there are few places where you can find authentic Italian food,? says Cananzi.

 The cuisine of the north is simple, with an emphasis on aromatic food and slow cooking. ?This is food like my mom would make. A tomato sauce would be cooked for over three hours,? smiles Cananzi. It does not, however, include a lot of heavy sauces and creams. 

 As opposed to what most Indians have come to expect, Italian food, stresses the chef, is not covered with cheese. Parmesan is served separately on the table for diners to sprinkle as per their taste.

 Part of the Hyatt agenda is also pairing food with the right wine. ?All flavours don?t go with the same wine,? adds the chef. ?Parmesan, for example, only goes with a dry white wine,? he points out. 

 Furthering this cause will be occasional wine nights, where starters will do the rounds teamed with an appropriate glass of wine.

 Open through the week for dinner (between 6 pm and midnight), a Sunday set menu will also be served up (noon to 3 pm) at the 84-seater outlet. The ? la carte prices range from Rs 220 to Rs 710. The Sunday buffet comes at Rs 775 plus taxes. An extra Rs 200 brings with it half a bottle of sparkling wine.

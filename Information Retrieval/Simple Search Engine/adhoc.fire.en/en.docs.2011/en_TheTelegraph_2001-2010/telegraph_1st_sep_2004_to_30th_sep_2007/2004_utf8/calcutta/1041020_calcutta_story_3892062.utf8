 Puja look

IPSITA DEB

 Prabir De creates the aqua look for Saptami 

So the Pujas are finally here in full swing, and all 

those new clothes and accessories can be worn (guiltlessly) and shown off around 

town. 

 According to make-up artiste Prabir De, the aqua look is perfect for official Day One of the Pujas. This, he feels, has roots in mythology.

 The colour blue has immense significance in the Ramayana, particularly with reference to Ram?s worship of Durga. Here, De translates the pages from folklore in a modern, trendy interpretation of the ?blue look?:

Step 1

 After cleansing your face, apply a base that is the same colour as your skin. Apply it smoothly over the face and neck, ensuring there are no splotches. Dab a little light powder over the skin and use a compact to even it out.

 Step 2

 Bring out your eyes, keeping in the mind that the look should be on the lighter side to go with the mood of the day. Use aqua, yellow and green eye shadow over the upper eyelid.

 Splash just a dash of light brown eye shadow around the lower lid. Mark the corners of the eyes with a bronze pencil to give a gold and copper sheen to those tantalising eyes. However, make sure not to overdo it and refrain from using kajal (save the more dramatic touches for the days to come). Apply lots of mascara and watch your eyes come alive.

Step 3

 When applying lip colour of any sort, always match the shade to your complexion. But for Saptami, try and keep it as light as possible.

Step 4

Apply a light blush-on to give that extra glow to 

your cheeks. However, make sure the colour is very subtle and you have an almost 

no-make-up look. Keep your hair open and straight. The effect should be simple, 

yet stylish.

Final look

 Finally, care must taken with your clothing and accessories. Trendy western wear will make a statement on this day, so get into trendy capris or a long printed skirt and a well-styled blouse before you hit the pandals or a friend?s house. 

 Ornaments, artificial or real, should be colourful, of different shapes and sizes (like the blue hoops in the picture). 

 Make sure that whatever you choose complements your attire. So, with these western outfits and colourful adornments, you should be all set for Saptami.

 Japan, South Korea, Sweden, England, Ireland and India may not speak the same language, but are united by the power of non-verbal art. 

 Brainchild of Ashok Chatterjee, director, Body Language School in Calcutta, the eighth International Festival of Non-Verbal Arts (IFNA) started on Tuesday evening at Rabindra Sadan with a colourful performance by the six countries. The troupe had performed at Suri on December 5. 

 Music, gesture theatre and clown mime form an integral part of the show, that relies on ?experimentation and spontaneity? as the key elements to take the art of mime ?out of its traditional confines?. 

 The Indian section of the programme saw legendary pianist and composer V. Balsara orchestrate a music medley by artistes from India, Japan, England and Ireland. 

 The instrumental pieces, with Balsara on accordion, included a rendition of Sare jahan se achchha. The tone was set for Japanese musician Yoshimi Yeno to play Rabindranath Tagore?s Hriday amar nachere aajike... on flute, apart from a Japanese prayer piece and other original tunes. 

 Clown mime by Sweden and South Korea went down well, too. Swedish actor Jay Baker-Eriksen portrayed the story of a little Swedish boy as he explored his little world through simple acts of eating, sleeping, playing ball and pranks. 

 ?Since this is an inter-cultural festival, I wanted to show a small piece of Swedish life, which is very different from India,? said Jay. 

 The South Korean team, on the other hand, combined magic, acrobatics, juggling and clowning to hilarious effect. 

 The team got maximum audience adulation even though South Korean artiste Kim Chan Su said prior to the show that Indian audiences are not as spontaneous as people in other parts of the world. 

 ?Here, people don?t laugh or cry as easily with you,? Kim had smiled.

 The water-and-fish mime by England was, however, drowned in hoots and catcalls. 

 Subsequent shows to be held on December 8 and 9 at Girish Mancha and the Tata Consultancy Services auditorium in Salt Lake, respectively, will see little changes in the foreign performances. 

 The Indian section will include solo performances by upcoming sitar player Anirban Chatterjee and dance recitals by Sharmistha Ghosh and Kashmira Samanta.

 ?We try to include a new element in IFNA every year to add to its richness. Next year, we plan to bring down Japanese ?now? drama, which is a kind of traditional Japanese drama, rather costly in nature,? promised Chatterjee.

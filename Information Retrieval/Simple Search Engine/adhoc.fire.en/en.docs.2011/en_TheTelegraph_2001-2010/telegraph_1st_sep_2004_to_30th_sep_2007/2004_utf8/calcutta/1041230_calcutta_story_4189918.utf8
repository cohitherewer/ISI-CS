 Success spawns meaty add-ons 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After tickling Calcutta?s taste buds with quail, turkey, duck and rabbit meat, the state animal resources department is set to make additions to the items on offer.

 The department will introduce mutton and lamb meat at the three Suravi outlets in the city from January 1. Priced at Rs 130 per kilo, the meats will be available in 250 gram and 500 gram packets.

 ?We will procure mutton from local farmers, while lamb meat will be supplied from our farm in Salboni, West Midnapore. The meat will be processed and packed hygienically,? an animal resources department official said. 

 The department is currently raising a batch of over 200 lambs at its Salboni farm and is also inviting farmers to supply lamb meat. 

 ?The idea is to offer consumers more choice as well as widen the marketing channels for farmers. Also, since chicken and mutton are easily available, we decided to offer lamb which is known for its tender meat,? the official added. 

 The West Bengal Livestock Processing Development Corporation will procure the meat from farmers and market it.

 The three Suravi outlets at New Market, Jadavpur and Entally have been doing brisk business ever since exotic meats like spent duck, cockerel, rabbit, turkey and quail were introduced six months ago. 

 Buoyed by their success, the government has decided to set up 10 more outlets at a cost of Rs 50,000 each.

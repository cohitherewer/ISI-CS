 Patience tips for teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Concerned over complaints of teachers in government-aided schools losing their patience and thrashing students, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is planning to educate the teacher on ways to manage anger, stress and the child.

 On Sunday, officials said the government?s newest initiative is aimed at combating the bullying teacher in scores of state-aided schools in and outside Calcutta, where corporal punishment was banned over a year ago.

 ?I regret to say that many of our teachers, who are modern men and women, have very little patience with children. As a result, they end up bullying the children,? said Kanti Biswas, state school education minister. 

 ?Many of them lack motivation. We have reached a stage where they must be equipped with skills and an understanding of the child they have to handle,? he added.

 A proposal for incorporating training on anger and stress management in the B.Ed course was under consideration, the officials said.

 On an average five to 10 complaints of teachers beating up students are received every month. A scrutiny of the complaints revealed that the teachers are mostly at fault because they do not have the patience and ability to control anger. 

 In the government?s view, teachers, who are studying the B.Ed course, are not adequately equipped to tackle children because it is not compulsory for B.Ed students to study child psychology. The paper on guidance and counselling of students is optional.

 According to officials in the school education department, apart from overhauling the B.Ed syllabi, the government has plans to introduce some more measures to minimise occurrence of incidents of corporal punishments. 

 Some measures to keep corporal punishment in check include compulsory study of child psychology and child guidance and counselling, along with introduction of regular parent-teacher meetings.

 Open-air music mania

 Children?s Day turned the INOX multiplex at City Centre into an open-air disco. In a first-of-its-kind event (the courtyard of the Salt Lake mall was turned into a dance floor on a previous occasion), 10 music enthusiasts participated in a contest that landed the winner a contract to play at the ?open-air disco? at the hall for the next year.

 The extravaganza started at 4 pm, with participants being judged on the parameters of mixing abilities, choice of music, number of songs played and interaction with the crowd. 

 The panel of judges included general manager INOX City Centre Subhasis Ganguli, RJ Jimmy Tangree and Debraj Bose from Coca-Cola. Each participant was given a time frame of 15 minutes to display his tricks and musical talents at the turntable. 

 Bhangra created a blast at the console but there were takers for western tracks too with Superstar and It wasn?t me keeping onlookers on their toes. 

 Sadly, the female factor was totally absent. Finally, DJ Jaypreet walked off with the resident DJ contract.

Slurp up

 With the nip in the night air, it?s time to revel in all things warm. Ming Room on Park Street has come up with the perfect offer. A steaming bowl of soup, along with some crunchy starters, has been set as the seasonal platter for the starters-and-soup festival being held from November 16 to December 15. The menu includes a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian items.

 A bowl of soup comes with a platter full of assorted starters of your choice. This combo meal comes for Rs 130, plus tax. Some appetising veggies in the starter platter include Golden Fried Paneer Balls, Cheese and Mushroom Rolls and Golden Fried Baby Corn. For non-vegetarians, the Chicken Cocktail Spring Rolls, Spare Ribs and Golden Fried Prawns are a sure hit.

 There is a wide variety of soups, including Clear Lemon Garlic Soup, Szechwan Soup and Hot And Sour Soup. Each of these may be prepared as vegetarian items or cooked with chicken or shrimp.

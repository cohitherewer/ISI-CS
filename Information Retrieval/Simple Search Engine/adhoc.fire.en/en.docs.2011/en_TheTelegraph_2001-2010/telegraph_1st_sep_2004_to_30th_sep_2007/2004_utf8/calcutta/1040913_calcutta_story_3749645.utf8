 Brush with bunglings

Pranabesh Das: If anyone complains about corruption or embezzlement in any state government office, do you take any action?

 Strictly speaking, we are the government?s document auditors. If any government office bungles in financial transaction, say during giving or receiving payment, we are the authority to look after this. For example, if a chair is bought by a government office and it has no document of the payment, we definitely inquire into the matter. But if they can produce the documents and prove that the chair matches the specification laid down in the requirement, we have nothing to say. However, if anybody informs us about any major financial corruption, we immediately pass on the information to the authority concerned.

 Brawl at cards leaves one dead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A quarrel among four friends during a gambling session ended with the murder of one in Ajaynagar, Dum Dum, on Saturday night. Victim Gautam Sinha, a fruit merchant, was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead. 

 Two of his friends, Uday Mondal and Bablu Mondal, were admitted with gunshot wounds. The fourth, Shibu Saha, was arrested on Sunday morning in a local hideout.

 Police are baffled over how the youths, with no criminal record except rowdyism, could possess a gun. Local people alleged that all four were CPM supporters and were often involved in hooliganism. 

 According to police, the four were drunk while they were playing a game of cards on the ground floor of an abandoned apartment block.

 ?A quarrel broke out between Uday and Shibu on Saturday afternoon, after Uday accused Shibu of cheating. The matter ended there. Later in the evening, when they started another round, the row erupted all over again. Realising that things were spinning out of control, Shibu asked Bablu to intervene and separate the two,? said Parveen Kumar, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police. 

 But soon matters came to an exchange of blows. Gautam punched Shibu. 

 Shibu doubled up, clutching his abdomen. When he stood up again, he was wielding a pipegun. Before the others had a chance to react, he shot his assailant.

 The first bullet hit Gautam in his lower abdomen and he fell. Bablu jumped on Shibu, trying to wrest the gun out of his grasp, and took a bullet in the back in the scuffle. The injured Bablu tried to help a profusely bleeding Gautam, and raised the alarm. Shibu fled. He was held on Sunday.

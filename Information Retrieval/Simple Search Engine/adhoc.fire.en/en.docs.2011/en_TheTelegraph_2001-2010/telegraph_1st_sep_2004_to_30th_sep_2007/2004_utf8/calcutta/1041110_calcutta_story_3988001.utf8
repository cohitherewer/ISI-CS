 Zooming in on life

 Contrary to popular opinion, there is a lot more to photography than simply capturing images for posterity. The photographer is an artist who seeks to recreate his subject in a manner as to give an altogether new form and meaning to it. Sophisticated techniques, such as highlight and accentuation, shifting of perspective, use of natural light, blend of light and shade, colour and monochrome, are but a few tools at the disposal of the skilled photographer, who uses them to generate powerful images conveying profound truths, to which we would otherwise have been oblivious. Hosted by Chhhayapath, the ongoing exhibition, 10th International Salon of Photography 2004 , offers an opportunity to view a vast collection of world-class photographs that provide food for thought to the discerning viewer, at the same time giving pleasure to his aesthetic sensibilities. The sheer range of breathtaking snapshots on display, taken by renowned lensmen the world over, renders this exhibition a must-see for all.

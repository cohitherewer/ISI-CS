 Milk sop for star witness

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The cop cup of kindness overflows for Jhalmanjoy Maity. 

 The 62-year-old is caretaker of the Lake Gardens housing complex in which 87-year-old Lila Deb was strangled, and though he was not involved in the murder, police suspect he may provide leads in the case. 

 It is, therefore, essential to keep him ?mentally and physically fit?. So, the police have been providing him with glasses of milk for the past three days in Lake police station.

 According to officers of Lake police station, though Maity must have some information about the killing, ?we have not examined him thoroughly because whenever we start questioning him, he tells us that he is not feeling well.? 

 Lila Deb was strangled to death in her apartment, where she used to live with her part-time domestic help. Her two sons are settled in Chicago and Los Angeles. They repeatedly asked her to join them in the US, but she refused. She was not ready to leave the house where she had lived with her husband.

 In the course of investigation, police discovered that more than one person was involved in the killing. ?It seems, the assassins entered the flat from outside and Maity probably saw them,? said an official working on the case, adding: ?Maybe he had no idea they had come to kill Lila. We are asking him to try and recall their faces.?

 But whenever the police turn the heat on him, he says: ?You are like my sons. Why are you talking to me in such a manner??

 ?Whenever he is grilled he threatens to fall ill. So, we have to take care of his health,? said another officer of Lake police station. So, Maity gets two glasses of milk every day.

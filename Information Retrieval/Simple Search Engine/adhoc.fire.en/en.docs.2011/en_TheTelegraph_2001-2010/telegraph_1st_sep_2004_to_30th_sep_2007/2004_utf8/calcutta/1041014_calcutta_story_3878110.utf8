The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Pool in for comfort

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should offices and schools make the car pool system mandatory to lower vehicle count on the streets? 

Govind Das Dujari, 

 Diamond Harbour Road

 The introduction of a compulsory car pool system for offices and schools is an excellent idea. The question reminds me of the cartoon character Dagwood in the Blondie series who uses a car pool. If the concept is so popular in the West, where fuel is cheaper and a car not a luxury, I don?t see why the system should not be made mandatory in a poor country like ours.

A.K.Ghosh,

 CIT Road

 The idea is that the cars being used for transportation of individuals should be used for transportation of a group of people. This will lead to reduction in the number of cars for transporting the same number of people as before. Which means there will be less pollution and traffic snarls. People who avail of public transport may continue to do so. 

Prasit Sen, 

 Hatiara

 Yes, offices and schools should definitely make the car pool system mandatory. The number of vehicles on the roads seems to rise each day and this system will not only curb this trend but also help get rid of frequent traffic jams. 

Anil Kumar Sen, 

 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane

 It deserves to be turned into reality as it will not only minimise the possibility of accidents, but also reduce traffic snarls and sound pollution. The long hours that people are forced to spend stuck in jams are torturous. It is essential to maintain smooth traffic flow so that commuters reach their destinations on time. 

Indrani Negal, 

 Narkeldanga North Road

 If there is a car pool system in place in schools and offices, vehicle-users will park their cars at a proper place. Otherwise, people have a tendency to park their vehicles just about anywhere. This often causes traffic jams. However, a large number of cars are required to transport employees of a big organisation. The office or school premises may not have enough parking space. As of now, most employees and students in the city use buses, Metro rail or trains to reach office/school. 

Gourav Biswas, 

 Diamond Park 

 In my view, the car pool system should be made mandatory as office-goers and schoolchildren find it difficult to reach their destinations on time, either due to traffic jams or non-availability of buses on the required routes or overcrowded buses. Apart from this, a car pool system will also reduce the headache of parents who, amidst tight schedules, are forced to take their wards to school and back.

Satyen Biswas, 

 Behala

 This step should have been taken long ago. Calcutta is a congested city. Easy availability of bank loans for purchase of cars makes people go on a maddening car-buying spree. This has led to so many private vehicles on the streets and excessive pollution from vehicular exhausts. To spare our diesel tanks and our lungs, the car pool system is a great idea.

Ratna Bagchi,

 Salt Lake

 Yes, car pools should definitely be made mandatory. It would decrease pollution and would also ease the traffic load on city streets, thereby bringing down the number of accidents. It would also mean more space for pedestrians.

Indranil Sanyal,

 Dhakuria

 Traffic congestion has become a menace. But will the authorities agree to such a system?

Rohini m. Paulmazumdar,

 Shyamnagar

 There are other ways to tackle the problem. Issuance of driving licences should be drastically reduced. Bicycling should be encouraged as is done in Japan.

Safin Hamid, 

 Tollygunge

 Making car pools mandatory is not a feasible idea. Most people have odd working hours these days and therefore it would be almost impossible to coordinate timings of going to and returning from office. Furthermore, people will have to spend extra time picking up and dropping off others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Victoria visitors pay Rs 4 to enter

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 From February 1, 2005, visitors and morning-walkers will have to pay Rs 4 to gain entry into the Victoria Memorial Hall compound.

 The entry fee was revised on Monday by a division bench of Calcutta High Court comprising Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutt.

 Previously, the bench had fixed an entry fee of Rs 5 for the general visitor and Rs 2 for the morning-walker. 

 The new flat rate was introduced to restrict the entry of morning-walkers, deemed to be ?more responsible? for polluting the area.

 ?The layer of mist and fog, which saves the grass of the Memorial compound and also the monument, is being destroyed by morning-walkers. So, it is necessary to restrict the movement of the public during the morning for the sake of protection of the monument and its compound from pollution,? the judges observed.

 The judges, however, announced a monthly, half-yearly and annual entry card system for the morning-walker. Morning-walkers will have to pay Rs 100 for a monthly card, Rs 500 for a half-yearly card and Rs 1,000 for an annual card.

 The government, which vehemently opposed introduction of the entry fee, finally accepted the court proposal on Monday. State chief secretary Ashok Gupta, however, suggested an entry fee of Rs 2.

 The fee is waived for students in groups with a letter of introduction from the head of the institution concerned.

 Environmental activist Subhas Dutta sought free entry for senior citizens, too. But the court said the Memorial authorities would take a decision on the proposal.

 Dutta told the court: ?Environmental scientists say the layer of fog and mist protects the earth and the building from pollution. Overnight fog and mist should be dried by the sun?s rays. It is good that the court has paid special attention to the issue.? 

 As to cleaning the drains around the compound, the court directed the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners to pay Rs 60,000 to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) within seven days. 

 ?Within seven days of receiving the money, the CMC will have to clean the drains,? the court decided.

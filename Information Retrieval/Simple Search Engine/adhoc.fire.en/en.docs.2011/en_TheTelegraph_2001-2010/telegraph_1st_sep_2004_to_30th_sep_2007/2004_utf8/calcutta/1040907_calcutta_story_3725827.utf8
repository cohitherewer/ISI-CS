 Ditched by debtors, solace in suicide

 - Mutual fund failure set off boycott fear

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 What made Pulak Ghosh of Parnasree kill his wife and daughter before committing suicide on August 30? Statements of Ghoshs colleagues and friends have buttressed the sleuths suspicion that the reason was a debt trap.

 His last words to a friend, before he left office on August 27, were a clear indication. I cant bear the tension any more. Theres no alternative but to kill myself. I dont know how my family will cope with the humiliation I am going through, the friend quoted Ghosh as having lamented. 

 Little did the friend (who asked not to be named) realise that Ghosh would act out his words. An employee of the Eastern Railway Employees Cooperative Society, Ghosh poisoned his wife Rina, 34, and daughter Moumita, 13, before hanging himself in his flat. 

 Rajesh Subarno, additional superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), said the sleuths were on the verge of closing the case. We have almost completed our probe and will soon come out with the details of the case, he added. 

 Ghosh was not very well off (his monthly salary was Rs 8,000). With the intention of making some quick money, he had floated a mutual fund a common practice in many government offices. 

 Colleagues deposit a paltry sum of Rs 200 or Rs 300 each to the banker and get back the amount with interest a month before the Pujas.

 That led to his downfall. Greed got the better of him and he had to pay for it with his life. Last year, too, he was in a similar situation, but managed to overcome it. This time, he was not so lucky, said the friend. 

 Ghoshs colleagues would deposit with him a monthly sum of Rs 200 each. A years deposit amounted to Rs 24,000. Every year before the Pujas, Ghosh would return Rs 3,000 to each of the depositors. 

 Ghosh would lend the amount he received from his colleagues at a monthly interest of two per cent. The borrowers were required to pay back the amount with interest by the first week of August. 

 Ghosh was supposed to pay back his colleagues on August 31. But he had no money that day, as his borrowers had let him down. 

 They had reportedly denied having taken any money from him. Anticipating social boycott and insult, Ghose chose to end his life, his friend added.

 Ghoshs colleagues also named another employee of the office, A. Maitra, who had committed suicide for similar reasons.

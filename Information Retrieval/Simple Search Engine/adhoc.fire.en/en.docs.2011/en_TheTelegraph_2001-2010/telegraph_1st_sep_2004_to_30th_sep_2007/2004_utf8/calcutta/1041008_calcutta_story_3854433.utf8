The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech town sings morning blues

 ?Weather kharap. Office-e keu nei. Amio taratari bari chole jachhi (The weather is bad. The office is empty and I?m leaving early, too),? said the woman who picked up the phone at Webel Bhavan around 4.30 pm on Thursday.

 The rain day sign-off, along with the attendance figure of around 10 per cent at the state?s nodal IT agency, summed up the mood at the state?s IT hub in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec).

 Thursday morning?s downpour and the incessant rains that continued well into the afternoon did what Citu-sponsored bandhs could not do ? slam the brakes on Bengal?s tech town ? for a few hours.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s blue-eyed boys and girls in Saltlec failed to play the 24x7 rules of the game, forced by waterlogging to remain indoors and trigger a very low turnout in Sector V.

 Though the firms formally refused to share attendance figures, sources in Saltlec confirmed the turnout was ?really low in the morning?, though it picked up later in the day.

 ?Most of the offices were open, but average attendance hardly crossed the 50 per cent mark in the first half. People started trickling in after the rain held up,? said a senior officer with a tech firm, who had to wade through water early in the morning to meet project delivery deadlines.

 Be it the bigger companies like Tata Consultancy Services, IBM and Cognizant Technology Solutions or the smaller firms at SDF and Infinity buildings, the attendance roster read the same ? more empty than full.

 With IT minister Manab Mukherjee and secretary G.D. Gautama out of town for the inauguration of a software technology park in Durgapur, the headcount was equally low at the IT department?s office on a submerged Camac Street.

 ?Most of my friends didn?t come as there was hardly any public transport available,? added the Saltlec employee.

 The condition of roads ? both in and outside Sector V ? kept a sizeable population away from work.

 ?I live in north Calcutta and so my route to office also includes the Ultadanga area. I didn?t want to risk my new car and navigate waterlogged Ultadanga and then the potholed and flooded roads of Salt Lake,? said a young techhie with a multinational company. 

 But the scene was different for the IT-enabled services sector, which works round the clock and caters to clients abroad.

 ?We had 100 per cent attendance. Our employees were picked up from their homes and so, we did not face much of a problem,? said a spokesperson for BNK e-Solutions.

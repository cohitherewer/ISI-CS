 Angelina Jolie: Generation gap

Mamma mia for Jolie

It?s an epic film about one of history?s most enigmatic 

and charismatic leaders. Alexander the Great was the only European conqueror to 

venture all the way to India in pre-Christian times. He ruled 90 per cent of the 

known world by the age of 25 and never lost a battle even when outnumbered. 

 It has all the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster, but above all, it?s the cast that offers the final twist. Director Oliver Stone has truly done it this time, with Colin Farrell as Alexander, Val Kilmer as his father Philip and ? hold your breath ? Angelina Jolie as his mother Olympias. 

 There?s also Christopher Plummer as Alexander?s teacher Aristotle and Anthony Hopkins as his general and confidant Ptolemy, and many more. 

 But the mother figure, of course, is the talking point. What?s the 29-year-old Jolie doing as the mother of 28-year-old Farrell? By her own admission, the Oscar-winning actress wasn?t sure about playing the part of the ambitious and power-hungry Olympias. But after reading the script, she connected with the character ? a wife discarded during a time when women were but chattel, and then driven to succeed through her son.

 Learning to handle real snakes for the film was just part of the filming process after that. Jolie is quoted as having said: ?Some people say she?s simply driven by power or, as she says, her fears. But I had come from a place that made the most sense to me that I also felt made her human. She genuinely loved her son and was like a tough father.?

 Jolie is sticking to epic tales with the part of Russia?s Catherine the Great in Love and Honour. But for now, you can catch her as the femme fatale Lola in the animation film Shark Tale in cinemas, or wait for the sci-fi film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.

C.I.D team: High on success

 It?s not often that a Hindi serial makes it to the record books. But Sony?s C.I.D has managed just that. The November 7 episode of the popular detective series found a place in the Limca Book of Records? ?TV show ? longest continual shot? category for being shot continuously for 111 minutes. The next stop may be the Guinness Book of World Records.

 In an attempt to deviate from the usual 30-40 second shots, director B.P. Singh attempted to can the entire episode without a cut. This meant days of rehearsals and precision planing, but in the end the cast and crew were able to pull it off.

 The storyline for the episode titled The Inheritance follows a business tycoon from South Africa returning to India to settle his inheritance issues. When one of his relatives is murdered and a masked intruder attacks the businessman, he summons the CID team. As the sleuths get closer to finding out the identity of the killer, another murder takes place. It leaves the team puzzled and mulling the next move.

 They?re the quintessential party babes, rich kids and spoilt brats, with good ol? mummy and daddy indulging their every whim and fancy. Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie have made a name by just being at the right place at the right time. And then a dose of reality came along, in the form of a TV programme ? The Simple Life.

 Simply put, for one month, they had to live on a farm, with a family, in small town America, and help out with all the chores. But things didn?t quite go according to plan. They bumbled their way through milking cows, refused to skin the chicken for dinner, didn?t do any of the household duties assigned to them and skived off even the smallest of tasks, like making their beds.

 The only time the Hilton heiress and singer Lionel Richie?s daughter were in their element was during a night out at a local pub, making the most of the interest shown by the local lads, for whom it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. There?s more to come, so tune in to Star World on Thursday nights and keep watching. And laughing, or sniggering.

 Another reality show counting down to its finale next Thursday, on Star World, is For Love or Money 3. From a choice of 16 women, Preston has whittled it down to two ? PJ and Rachel. Who will he choose? Will she choose money over him? If she does, then will the mystery cheque reveal a prize money of $1 or $1 million? The trailers promise a twisted ending?

Hugh Jackman: X factor

 Superheroes descend on your screen this month, courtesy STAR Movies. First up, Marvel Comics? blind lawyer-turned-crime fighter Daredevil?s first outing starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner. The blind superhero doesn?t quite have the fan following of Batman, Superman or Marvel?s more popular Spiderman and the movie tried to change some of that. Find out if it managed to and whether Affleck was apt for the role. Though the premiere on the channel was on November 14, look out for repeats.

 The other super attraction is the second X-Men movie, X2: X-Men United. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Halle Berry as Storm should help to please fans of both sexes. This time, the youngsters with supernatural powers band together to find a mutant assassin who has made an attempt on the life of the President. The X-Men?s arch enemy Magneto makes his presence felt, too. Mark November 20 as the X day.

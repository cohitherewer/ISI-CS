 Browsers to beat bundle power 

 - Explore beyond IE

 TechTalk

 Which is the most popular operating 

 system in the world? No prizes for answering that no-brainer 

 ? some version of Windows, of course. No wonder then that 

 most Net surfers don?t bother to look beyond Internet Explorer 

 (IE), the browser that comes bundled with Windows. But a 

 world of IE substitutes awaits those who dare to try something 

 different.

 These are as feature-packed (if 

 not more) as IE and provide support across several operating 

 systems apart from Windows. On a dial-up connection (which 

 most of us still use at home) every bit of bandwidth counts, 

 and the need for maintaining a virus-free system can hardly 

 be over-emphasised. So, speed and security are two key areas 

 (learning from the numerous malicious attacks on IE) some 

 of the better browsers stress on.

 There are several lightweight 

 feature-rich browsers available. But here?s a look at the 

 top three IE alternatives. What suits you best depends on 

 your surfing pattern, but do try each one out to discover 

 what the worldwide web looks like through a window that?s 

 not Internet Explorer.

 Mozilla 

 Firefox 

 One of the lightest browsers around, 

 both in terms of download size and usage. Introduces the 

 alien concept of tabbed browsing to IE users where, instead 

 of opening every page in a new browser window, different 

 pages can be opened as tabs within the same window. Result: 

 managing tabs is far easier and time saving, since links 

 open in the background. 

 Other features include built-in 

 pop-up blocker and Google search, text zooming for better 

 readability and a transition system to import your bookmarks 

 and passwords from IE. For extra security, Firefox doesn?t 

 load ActiveX controls (often harmful). Downloading files 

 is also easy and managed through a single window. Allows 

 the browser skins to be changed, too.

 History lesson: Mozilla 

 was the original code name for the browser that came to 

 be known as Netscape Navigator, and later, Netscape Communicator. 

 Mozilla products are now developed by mozilla.org -? a community 

 of independent developers which works towards improving 

 the source code, as part of the open-source software project.

 Other products from the Mozilla 

 stable include the email client Thunderbird, the bug-tracking 

 server software Bugzilla, and Camino, a web browser optimised 

 for Mac OS X. The Calendar Project is what is keeping the 

 team busy currently, working hard at creating a first-class, 

 cross-platform calendar application.

 Current version: 1.0, though 

 it?s only a preview (beta) release, with the final release 

 expected in the fourth quarter of 2004. 0.9.3, the last 

 full-version release is also available for download.

 Platforms: Windows, Linux, 

 Mac.

 Opera 

 The fastest browser on the planet 

 goes the tagline. And it?s surely one of the fastest, at 

 least. For a simple comparison, on the same Internet connection, 

 try opening a page with Opera that is loading very slowly 

 on IE. The difference should be obvious.

 Opera also offers the best platform 

 compatibility with support even for OS/2, Solaris and smartphone 

 operating systems. A great feature is the Wand. When you 

 visit a page for the second time where you need to fill 

 in user name and password, click on the Wand and voila, 

 you?re in! The email client is built-in, which can also 

 be used to read news feeds and Usenet newsgroups. Like Firefox, 

 Opera supports skin changes too, only with greater variety 

 from My Opera.

 Several search-engines are built-in, 

 including Google and Altavista. Opera supports many languages 

 as well. Another useful feature is Sessions, which lets 

 you save a collection of open pages as a session, allowing 

 retrieval on later start-ups or in the middle of another 

 session. Opera can also be set up to start with the pages 

 you had kept open when the browser was last closed.

 The only pinch is the price. You 

 can try the advertisement-filled version where the options 

 even allow you to choose the kind of ads you want displayed, 

 but a lot of browser space and precious bandwidth is taken 

 up by the ads. Conversely, $39 is steep.

 History lesson: Opera started 

 out as a research project in Norway?s telecom company Telenor 

 in 1994, and branched out into an independent development 

 company named Opera Software ASA in 1995.

 Current version: 7.54

 Platforms: Windows, Mac, 

 Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, OS/2, QNX, smartphone/PDA

 (with Java), 3.4 MB (without Java)

 Netscape 

 Navigator

 For old time?s sake, if nothing 

 else. Netscape was one of the first real threats to IE, 

 finding favour with a huge section of Net users in the early 

 days. That was until it ran out of steam and couldn?t keep 

 up with Mr Gates? bundling power. Lately, though, Netscape 

 is trying to bounce back with an updated and jazzed-up version 

 of the browser.

 It is based on the Mozilla source 

 code. New features include integrated radio and a Winamp 

 player. Other nifty ones include a single-click page-saving 

 option that allows you to save a page with all the graphics 

 files (GIFs and JPEGs) and a text search option where you 

 can right-click on a word and choose Web Search. The result 

 appears in a separate browser window. The new version of 

 Netscape supports tabbed browsing and lets you choose whether 

 to accept or block pop-ups. You can even allow select pop-ups 

 to appear. Tabs, zoom and download features are also offered.

 History lesson: In mid-1994, 

 Silicon Graphics founder Jim Clark collaborated with Marc 

 Andreessen (a recent graduate of University of Illinois) 

 to found Mosaic Communications, later renamed Netscape Communications. 

 By the summer of 1995, the Netscape browser, though paid, 

 commanded as much as 80 per cent market share. In 1998, 

 owing to IE pressure, Netscape turned free and opened the 

 source code to developers from all over the world to create 

 a new and better browser. The Mozilla Project was born.

 Current version: 7.2

 Platforms: Windows, Mac, 

 Linux

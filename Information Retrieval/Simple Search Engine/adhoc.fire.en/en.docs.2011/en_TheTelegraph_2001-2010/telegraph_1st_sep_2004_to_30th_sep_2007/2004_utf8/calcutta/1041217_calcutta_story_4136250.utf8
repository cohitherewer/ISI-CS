 Invoking the Fire God

 Tollygunge Club and Open Doors, in association with Patton, Seagram 100 Pipers and National Insurance, present Agni, a stunningly choreographed dance number by Manipuri dance exponent Priti Patel. To be accompanied by dancers of Anjika, the show pays obeisance to Agni, the Hindu God of Fire, in all the three forms in which He is worshipped. Commencing with a prayer to Goddess Usha and followed by the ritualistic Agni Manthan when the holy fire is lit, the dancers invoke Agni through brilliantly synchronised movements. Here Agni is shown in relation to the earth, water, fire and sky, and finally, as a purifier and destroyer of all evil. A combination of Vedic chants and ancient Manipuri rituals, along with the contemporary choreography of Manipuri male dance forms, specially Thang-ta, a martial art form, brings together the Vedic and Manipuri traditions in a visually delightful and aesthetically appealing performance that promises to linger in the minds for long.

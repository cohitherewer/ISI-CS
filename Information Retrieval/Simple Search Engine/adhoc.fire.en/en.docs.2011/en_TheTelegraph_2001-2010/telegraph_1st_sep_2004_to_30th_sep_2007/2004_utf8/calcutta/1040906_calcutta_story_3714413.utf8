 Sundown on a Sunday evening. Time for starry souls whove slaved through the week to let their hair down and have a blast. Or maybe just take a deep breath and chant out loud.

 Thats what is happening in a south Calcutta house, where a group quietly gathers to chant a Buddhist prayer or learn a little about enlightenment. Peep in and chances are you will spot Tollywood hero Jishu Sengupta and fiancee Nelanjana Bhowmick latching on to every word.

 Nichiren Buddhism helps one cope with peer pressure, cut-throat competition and the demands of living up to the expectations of parents, says Nelanjana, who has been practising it for nearly two years.

 Jishu, only three months old in the Nichiren Buddhism camp, adds: I feel much better ever since I started practising the faith. I am more confident and focussed now. And its a hassle-free method, as one can chant while driving, too.

 The star duo is among a growing bunch from tinsel town leaning towards Buddhism.

 From coping with a personal crisis to juggling a stressful job, Buddhism is slowly becoming a way of life for those under the spotlight.

 Its more than just a passing fad, they insist. So if Hollywood can boast of heavyweights like Richard Gere, Goldie Hawn and Madonna, Tollywood has its own band of faithfuls to flaunt keeping Jishu and Nelanjana company are June, Chandana Bhowmick, Deboleena, Chaiti Ghosal, Arindam Sil, Rwita Dutta Chakraborty...

 As members of Soka Gakkai International (SGI), an organisation preaching the teachings of monk Nichiren who lived in 13th Century Japan, the Tollywood stars attend at least two meetings a month.

 With 1,036 members, known as engaged Buddhists, on its rolls, the Calcutta chapter of SGI sees around 80 to 100 members from the corporate arena and the world of showbiz signing up every month.

 As people working in the glamour industry are constantly under pressure, chanting prayers and being acquainted with Buddhist principles helps them relieve their stress, explains Indranath Chowdhury, spokesperson for the Calcutta wing of SGI.

 For TV star Deboleena, the soothing effect of the prayers helped her during a personal crisis. I had lapsed into depression when my grandfather died last October. After joining SGI, I recovered quickly. It boosted my confidence, too, she says. 

 For Arindam Sil, it helps realise his inner strength.

 If the SGI camp is gaining ground by the day, there are some like June who prefer to go their own Buddhist way. I follow the Dalai Lama to achieve peace and harmony in myself and in those around me. It has given me a lot of energy, says the actress.

bridge on Aids 

 A Thoughtshop Foundation workshop on HIV/AIDS awareness in progress.

 Day One: The car-ride seemed to last forever through bumpy roads and dirt tracks. Finally there was this dark, dingy room, across an open drain and muddy field. Peeling paint, cobwebs, a single broken door and no windows.

 Day Two: On Hungerford Street, a swift elevator ride straight up to the fifth floor. A swank room, flooded with late afternoon sunshine, smart colour scheme on the walls, bright soft boards and comfortable chairs.

 If there was one feature common to these two dramatically different sites, it was a certain streak of enthusiasm. ?Who knew a three-hour-long awareness workshop could be so much fun?? gushed Manjari, 18, as she posed for photographs on Saturday in a plush apartment. Her quieter counterpart Nita, relishing biscuits with a cup of tea, had echoed the same feeling a day earlier in a ramshackle room.

 The excitement had been drummed up by two groups of youngsters, as different as the rooms they gathered in, for Thoughtshop Foundation?s training sessions on HIV/AIDS awareness as part of the Youth Awards project. 

 Revathi Rajaram, project coordinator, said: ?The Youth Awards project intends to take training sessions to various youth groups and institutions aiming to encourage them to spread AIDS awareness, with various Thoughtshop prizes waiting at the end.?

 But an award was the last thing on the minds of the participants ? be it Sukumar Rajbanshi, a 19-year-old fish-seller from Indiranagar slum, or Rohini Lodge, an ex-Modern High student, pursuing a course in advertising from Wigan and Leigh College.

 The Yuba Sangha clubroom, near the airport, had over 25 girls and boys of the 14-20 age group from three slums ? Metropalli, Indiranagar and Talbagan ? listening with rapt attention as Thoughtshop counsellor Mou asked questions on various aspects of AIDS and drug addiction. 

 Seated cross-legged on the floor, shy smiles peeping out of their bright faces in a musty room, it was a day out of the ordinary for these adolescents, most school drop-outs and with hardly any time for recreation after earning their living all day.

 Youngsters like Tarak Jana got into the spirit of quizzing as he fought for bonus points for his team, answering questions on the possibilities of the virus spreading through mosquito bites or at the barber?s, through kissing or by shaking hands.

 While new information might have kept the show going at the slum workshop, Thoughtshop?s ?cool approach to such a sensitive topic? maintained high adrenaline levels at the Wigan and Leigh college setting. 

 Amidst trendy beadwork sling bags, hipsters and streaked hair, the importance of the session was lost on none. ?This is the first time I have had a real frank discussion about AIDS with people who know. This is also a great chance for us to do something good while having fun,? said Ayudh Roy, pursuing media studies. 

 Revathi of Thoughtshop summed it up, ?No matter where we go, whom we address, the adolescents? eagerness is overwhelming.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A thought for food

AdLib

 A brand is what the consumers buy, from 

phuchka faves to roll raves 

Some years AGO I was having lunch with Mr Jagdish 

Chopra, an ex-Levers top marketing man. Our discussion veered around to successful 

Indian brands. To my pleasant surprise, he spoke more about bylanes of Madurai 

than downtown Manhattan. And he also knew a lot about Calcutta (?Why would you 

not include Sen Mahashay in the list of successful brands??).

This was early Nineties and I felt it was an interesting 

thought, and that is all. Possibly one of the unmistakable traits of greatness 

is the ability to think ahead of the times. It takes lesser mortals like us a 

good decade to see a branch of Aminia in Gol Park and realise the full import 

of Mr Chopra?s comment.

A brand is, one dictionary says, a trademark or distinctive 

name identifying a product or a manufacturer [1]. A brand name thus distinguishes 

a product and promises a bundle of benefits to the consumer. It is now easy to 

appreciate the greatness of some of the brands of Calcutta. And there are so many 

of them in just food ? Nizam?s roll, Anadi?s Mughlai Porota, Aminia?s Chaanp, 

Rahmaniya?s Biryani, Vien?s Sandesh? Even the phuchkawala next to Vivekananda 

Park is a brand.

It is thus interesting to see some of these brands 

realise that by being single location, they are missing out. So Aminia is also 

in Gol Park, Rahmaniya is additionally in Lake Place, Vien has a south Calcutta 

outlet.

You do not need to trudge all the way to Chowringhee 

to enjoy some of the best food brands. That seems to be the promise. That should 

expand the market and strengthen the franchises. Yet there is something else that 

needs to be remembered. A brand is not what you make; a brand is what the consumers 

buy. Famous words these.

Many ask questions like, tell me what was (the tense 

is really unfortunate) so great about rolls from Nizam?s? The truth is that brand 

Nizam?s core values and drivers may not necessarily reside in the kitchens behind 

New Market. 

They possibly lie in bunked classes and noon shows. 

Or in the boisterous laugh inside parked cars with drunken friends. Or in hurried 

lunches between meetings. Maybe even in sharing of the roll in semi-dark parked 

cars on the Strand.

Food brands, especially of the eating out variety, 

are treacherously misleading. They always appear to be made up of vegetables and 

fleshes, curries and spices. In reality, a significant portion of their being 

is experiences and memories. The mother brands are blessed with them.

For the brand extensions, obviously, the father?s 

college life cannot be replicated. Creating newer ones for the son will be important. 

In fact, as critical as replicating the original dishes.

 Hanging ban in pandals

 - Diktat after another girl dies copying Dhananjoy execution

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five weeks before Durga Puja and a day after a 10-year-old girl killed herself while re-enacting the Dhananjoy Chatterjee hanging - the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), along with the citys law-enforcers, decided to ban anything to do with the state execution at puja pandals.

 Police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty made it clear during a coordination meeting with the CMC, fire brigade and the CESC that no puja organiser would be allowed to depict the Dhananjoy hanging or even hangman Nata Mullicks acts at or around pandals.

 The crackdown comes a day after a school student hanged herself while enacting the Dhananjoy execution, assisted by her two little sisters in Habibpur, Nadia district.

 Purnima Gyne, a Class V student of a local school about 65 km from Calcutta, asked her two sisters Sampa, 7, and Pampa, 3, to tie the noose made from her mothers torn sari around her neck, as Nata Mullick had done to Dhananjoy.

 Police said the girls did exactly what their elder sister asked them to do and Purnima, who was standing on a stool, accidentally slipped and hanged herself.

 The latest in a string of child tragedies in the wake of the hanging and a swirl of rumours about how the episode would be picked up by puja organisers as a publicity stunt prompted the clause to be included in the things-to-ban puja list. 

 The others include:

 No taking 

over of city parks by stall-owners

 No damage 

to the pavements that have recently been paved with special tiles

 No blocking 

of city roads

 Free 

passage for the movement of fire engines

 No tapping 

of power

 No noise 

pollution through microphone

 Last year, of 1,097 puja pandals, 172 were erected on busy streets. According to assistant director (conservancy) Swapan Mahapatra, over 75 per cent of the citys community pujas encroach upon the pavements, thoroughfares, streets or lanes, and about 11 per cent are organised in CMC parks.

 Of 136 CMC parks in the city, community pujas take place in over 125 of them. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has directed municipal commissioner Debashis Som to ensure that no new pujas are organised in the CMC parks.

 The existing pujas will be held as usual, but unlike in the previous years, organisers will not be allowed to let out the premises for setting up stalls.

 Gang of four robs gas shop

 - Top cop says stolen sum low, dealers point to dacoity spurt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Hours after the men in uniform did a routine pre-Puja round of shops, warning owners and employees against robbers and extortionists, a gang of four youths looted an LPG distributor?s outlet at Baishnabghata, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, in the Jadavpur police station area, around 5.30 pm on Monday.

 The youths, in their early 20s, arrived at the outlet on two motorcycles. Brandishing revolvers, they snapped the telephone line and forced one of the five employees present to unlock the cash box. 

 They put the money in a bag along with a mobile phone and a gold chain taken from the employees, before speeding off on their motorcycles. 

 Around 6.15 pm, the employees called up outlet owner Pulak Maitra, who informed the Baishnabghata Patuli police outpost about the incident and later lodged an FIR. 

 However, additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Subarno, who visited the spot, said the police had received no ?specific complaint? about the incident.

 ?We have spoken to the employees and the owner. After preliminary investigation, we believe a significant amount from the cash box had been deposited in a bank in the afternoon, so we cannot be sure about the exact sum that was taken. I don?t think it is a significant amount,? Subarno said.

 Local police, however, believe the incident was not a stray robbery but a pre-planned dacoity. Intensive raids were conducted in Tiljala, Behala, Regent Park, Jadavpur and Thakurpukur to net the criminals. An investigating officer did not rule out the involvement of insiders.

 Around noon, personnel from both Jadavpur police station and Baishnabghata Patuli outpost had gone from shop to shop in the area, warning owners and employees about the seasonal spurt in theft.

 The robbery sent ripples of concern among other LPG dealers. ?In the past two months, there have been a string of robberies at LPG outlets across the state, with five instances in Calcutta and its adjacent areas alone,? said Asim Som, assistant secretary of the West Bengal LPG Dealers? Association. ?We will meet the director-general of police tomorrow and discuss the matter with Indian Oil Corporation officials, too.?

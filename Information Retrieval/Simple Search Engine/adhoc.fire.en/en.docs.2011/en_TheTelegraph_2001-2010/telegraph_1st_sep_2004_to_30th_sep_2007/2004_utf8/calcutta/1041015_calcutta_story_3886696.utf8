The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Stage On amp; Off

 Tara: Flashback

Imagine the pretty young Tara Sharma waiting on the 

balcony and calling out to her Romeo. Well, that?s exactly how it happened and 

that too in front of a packed audience. 

 Some years ago when the actress was in the UK studying and then working, she was into theatre in a big way and did play the female lead in the Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet. 

 The production was directed by acclaimed American theatre personality John Sheehan and was staged at the Old Repertory Theatre in Birmingham.

 ?I had great fun doing that but these days there is no scope of doing theatre,? says the actress who recently scored her first hit in Bollywood with the Indra Kumar multi-starrer Masti. 

 Tara, who started out with the Bhatt camp in Saaya and then played Abhishek Bachchan?s love interest in Om Jai Jagadish, feels a stint on stage does help an actor go all out when the medium translates to cinema.

?Very few people know that I have done theatre because 

I don?t really talk about it,? says Tara even as she shoots for her forthcoming 

films in Mumbai. Up next is Dev Anand?s ?offbeat? political satire Mr Prime 

Minister where Tara plays a terrorist. Talk about willing suspension of disbelief.

Gaurav: City bytes

 He is an absolute cracker on the small screen but it is the stage where VJ Gaurav?s heart lies. Having done a lot of plays already, Gaurav also loves to conduct quiz shows and was a big hit when he wore the QM crown at Kala Mandir for the Sangeet Kala Mandir quiz show last year.

 ?I wanted to do it this year also but I couldn?t squeeze out time,? said the funny man who was in the city for the Channel [V] Super Singer contest. 

 Gaurav is already working on two plays. ?They are still at the discussion stage. One of the two is a very morbid comedy. I would love to come to Calcutta with the play.? 

 Calcutta holds a special place for Gaurav as his father belongs to this part of the country. ?I used to spend a lot of time at the Tollygunge and Saturday clubs. We would also regularly eat at the Super Snack Bar in Alipore. And this city always comes up with such a nice response to whatever I do??

 Whether on stage or screen, Gaurav is gathering all the experience he can in order to direct a film some day. ?Yes, that?s my ultimate dream ? directing a film. So I am trying to be more wise with all these multiple roles and use it in my film-making.?

 A flash of new talent and a slice of vintage Bengali stage made the two-day-long Greenwood Park Theatre Festival memorable for all those who dropped into GD Birla Sabhagar last weekend. Hosted for the third successive year by Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd, the theatre fare kicked off on Saturday with Shrabya group performing a string of audio dramas (Rabindranath Tagore?s Bhool Swargo and Sanjib Chattopadhyay?s Klesh Nibarani Samity). 

 The stage was then set for Murshidabad-based theatre troupe Ritwick to showcase Meghabati. The allegorical work won Ritwick the Bijon Bhattacharya Smarak Samman for best play from the districts. Dressed in resplendent costumes, the troupe members enacted a two-and-half-hour tale of protagonist Meghabati?s peace mission against a tyrannical king. 

 Ritwick had fought off several groups from the districts to emerge winner at a two-day preliminary round held at St Xavier?s College auditorium last month. 

 Sunday evening wrapped up the festival with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee felicitating Soumitra Chatterjee with the lifetime achievement award, Utpal Dutta Smarak Samman. City group Chetana staged Nirnoy, which bagged the Tripti Mitra Samman for best production, under veteran Arun Mukherjee?s direction.

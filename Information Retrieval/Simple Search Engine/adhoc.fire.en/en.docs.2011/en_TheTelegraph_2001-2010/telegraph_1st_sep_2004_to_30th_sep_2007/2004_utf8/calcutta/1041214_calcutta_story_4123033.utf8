There are just a few weeks in the city that truly 

qualify as winter, and this stirs in the Calcuttan a yen for all things warm and 

cosy. And if you are at a party, wearing your winter best, you might crave a steaming 

beverage. Boring tea, coffee and hot chocolate aside, the most you can look forward 

to usually is a sinful Irish Coffee.

If you are bored of the old brews and are looking 

for a new twist to heat things up this festive season, here are a few potent mixes 

you can try. These strong aromatic punch recipes are strictly for the winter. 

Handle with care, if you don?t want to get burnt!

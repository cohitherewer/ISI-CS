The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Thank you for the music

 The music may yet be your saviour. Rock aficionados, let down by MTV and surviving on a late night diet of Channel V, take heart. One of the world?s classiest music channels is just around the corner. And if it turns out to be even half as good as being promised, not only will it be a lifeline for the music lover, but may also nourish him back to health.

 VH1 makes its Indian debut at midnight, December 31. Music is the mainstay and there would be no VJs mouthing inanities on the channel: something that might immediately win the hearts of most Calcuttans.

 ?Only English videos, both contemporary and classic?, will form the core content, confirms a spokesperson for the channel. That?s also how VH1 will differentiate itself from sibling MTV India (both are parented by the US-based Viacom). 

 But ?niche? is a label that the channel is not too keen on. ?It is niche only to the extent that it may not have mass Hindi audience appeal,? offers the spokesperson. ?Otherwise it is pretty much a mainstream English music channel. In fact, India?s first and only international music channel that also encompasses celebrity lifestyle and pop culture.?

 Back-to-back classic music videos from the 70s to the 90s would include artistes of different genres: Queen to Linkin Park, Pink Floyd to Robbie Williams and Billy Joel to Eminem.

 The programming line-up would also consist of shows on music and celebrities. All Access takes ?an insider?s look into the world of rock ?n? roll, from money to fashion to feuds and more?. Driven traces the ?process from childhood to the first glimmer of stardom? of an artiste through his teachers, family members, friends and creative partners. Storytellers is the equivalent of MTV?s Unplugged, where stars perform acoustic versions of their hits and share secrets on what makes them tick.

 Fabulous Life focuses on the lifestyle of the rich and famous, while Behind the Music takes a peek at the personal life of the popstar, tracing their struggles, setbacks and successes. Chart action will unfold through Greatest, a countdown show with a celebrity host presenting definitive rankings of the best songs, artistes, albums and ?everything else in rock ?n? roll?.

 As far as channel promotions are concerned, spots and tickers are already airing on MTV, but ?there will be a high decibel multimedia launch campaign? soon. ?We plan to associate with top international music legends who are scheduled to tour India in the first quarter of 2005,? is the word from VH1.

 There?s also a twist in the tale as far as distribution of the channel is concerned. Though both the other Viacom channels, MTV and Nick, form a part of SET Discovery, VH1 is hopping over to rival Zee-Turner. It will form part of a new bouquet that would include POGO, HBO, TV18?s Hindi business channel and Zee Business News.

 The music is certain to blow your mind. The only uncertainty is whether your cable operator delivers it to your screen or not!

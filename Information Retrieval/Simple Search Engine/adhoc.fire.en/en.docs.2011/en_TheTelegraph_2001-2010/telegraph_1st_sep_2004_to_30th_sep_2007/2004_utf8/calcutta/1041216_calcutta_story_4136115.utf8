The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Sameera Reddy: Flying colours

 When the going?s good, it?s wise to just keep going with the flow. And that?s something Sameera Reddy is doing with emphatic elan. While sizzling on big screens all across the country as Sam in Sanjay Gupta?s Musafir, the actress is, of course, doing a deglamourised turn in Buddhadeb Dasgupta?s Kaalpurush.

 But what?s new about sexy Sameera is her stunning stint with English terrain as part of the BBC exchange programme. The actress spent six days in London with ?her life exchanged with that of Emma Bunton?s (one of the former Spice Girls)?. 

 Sameera appeared as a guest on the popular soap in Britain called Casualty. The other guests who have made appearances on the show include everybody from Kate Winslet to Orlando Bloom. Then she met with Simon Fuller, the man behind the Spice Girls who also manages stars like Eminem. 

 The actress who made her debut in Maine Dil Tujhko Diya also squeezed in a meeting with Rav Singh, a symbol of paparazzi power in the UK. She went on to spend a whole day shopping at Gabbana and other major brands for the red carpet at the Variety Awards on Sunday.

Abhishek Bachchan: Small screen beckons

 He had helped Kareena cross the border in their first appearance on the big screen in Refugee. Now he will come to the small screen to impart a lesson of life to Kareena.

 In a special appearance on Thursday, at 9.30 pm on Zee TV, Abhishek will scold Kareena for telling lies: ?Oye Kareena... phir jhooth bola tune, ab to jaroor phasegi?. So far, Kareena has been sailing through an eventful life of twists and turns with her double identities ? as Kareena Sood, secretary to Tribhuvan Pandey, owner of Chamatkar soaps, and as RJ Kareena in Radio Curry.

 But there is twist in the tale. While Abhishek is junior Bachchan all right, the Kareena in question is not the Kapoor girl. It is Kulraj Kaur, playing the title role in Zee TV?s soap Kareena Kareena, who will receive Abhishek?s admonishings.

 Earlier, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Brett Lee have also appeared as spoofs on the show.

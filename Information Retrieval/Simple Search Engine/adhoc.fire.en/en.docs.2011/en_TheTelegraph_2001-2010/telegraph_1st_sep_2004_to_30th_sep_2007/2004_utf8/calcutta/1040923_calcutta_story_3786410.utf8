The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Footsteps from the past

 Modern middle-class life is complex and full of unforeseen problems. It entails taking tough decisions and constantly making compromises that deeply affect the mind. This is especially true for women, who find themselves torn between their responsibilities as a dutiful mother or wife, and their desire to redefine their own identity and seek self-fulfilment. Sayak?s latest production, Saanjhbela, confronts us with such a crisis faced by a middle-aged woman, Shrimoyee, and her teenaged children. Though an undercurrent of latent tension is discernible in the family from the very beginning, the sudden entry of Alokesh, a man from Shrimoyee?s past, completely disturbs the equilibrium in their lives. Based on a story by Bimal Kar and directed by Meghnad Bhattacharya, the play shows us how the entire family feels trapped in the throes of a dilemma and endures deep mental anguish while the story moves onwards to its inevitable end.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Saanjhbela, produced by Sayak

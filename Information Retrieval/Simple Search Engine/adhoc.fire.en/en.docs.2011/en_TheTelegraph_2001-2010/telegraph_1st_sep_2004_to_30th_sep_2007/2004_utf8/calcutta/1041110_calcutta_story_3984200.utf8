The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Special security shield for film fest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Unprecedented security will be provided to delegates from abroad for the 10th Kolkata Film Festival, which starts from Wednesday. 

 Apart from the delegates, the security blanket will cover venues and even strongrooms where the film prints will be kept. 

 At least 45 delegates, including film-makers and producers from countries like Chile, Germany, France and Israel, will be provided the Y-category security during the seven-day festival, spread over eight auditoriums across the city. 

 The festival will kick off at Nandan with Sub Terra, by Chile?s Marcelo Ferrari, who will be present at the screening.

 The police brass are tight-lipped about the security arrangements. According to sources, a security blueprint has been prepared after a meeting with home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty. Senior officers from the North and South 24-Parganas police, too, took part in the meeting. Clearly, the objective is to prevent any incident akin to the rape of a Swedish diplomat during a film festival in New Delhi last year.

 Special Branch officers trained at NSG Institute, in Maneswar, will be deployed to provide security to the invitees from the moment they set foot in Calcutta. The officers will be with the invitees throughout the duration of their stay here.

 For providing security in areas beyond the jurisdiction of the city police, particularly the hotels on the EM Bypass, senior officers, including those from the district intelligence branch, have been briefed by Chayan Mukherjee, IG (law and order).

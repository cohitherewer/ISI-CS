The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Hail past in present

A return to the roots, steeped in artistic enterprise. 

Metro takes the trail of five pujas, beautiful and basic, that have shunned 

modern gimmickry and unearthed themes, motifs and styles that hark back to a time 

more pristine and peaceful. From benign Mangalik Mangalmoyee to multi-media splendour, 

Durga dons a myriad hues

The pandal at 41 Pally, Haridevpur, has shot to prominence through 

its innovative use of the wood apple. But no less admirable are the wicker baskets 

collected from Basia, 120 km from Ranchi, and the wood engravings that tell a 

mythical story on each pillar. Picture by Pradip Sanyal

There?s a mela out there at Barisha Shakti Sangha. The 

ambience is soothing, with the lone strain of an ektara playing on the 

soundbox. The chief item of decoration is the toy windmill, a ubiquitous fluttering 

presence in any rural fair. The Devi is hosted in a minimalist naatmandir.

The two primary shades stand in sharp contrast in the Kankurgachhi 

Youngster pandal, a throwback to the art of linocut. More than eight different 

media have been used to paint, emboss, engrave and even animate to create poetry 

in black-and-white. The alley to the pandal has been done up with lino-style paintings 

in tribal flavour. The motif is retained in the idol as well. Picture by Pabitra 

Das

The Devi at Pragati Sangha, Purba Putiari, is the benign Mangalik 

Mangalmoyee in its golden jubilee year. The lion sits like a tame pet at her feet 

while Mahishasura?s presence is confined to his head. There?s alpona in 

the courtyard and live performances by rural artistes in the surrounding cottages.

?Nowhere has there been such a massive exhibition of Bastar 

work,? Tijuram Baghel had promised before the Pujas. The splendour in ironwork 

at Bosepukur Sitala Mandir in Kasba stands testimony to the claim of the Chhatt-isgarh 

lad who has toiled with villagers of eight hamlets. The pandal utilises more than 

10,000 figurines, in tribal and modern motifs, with the highest standing eight 

feet tall at the gate. Picture by Pabitra Das

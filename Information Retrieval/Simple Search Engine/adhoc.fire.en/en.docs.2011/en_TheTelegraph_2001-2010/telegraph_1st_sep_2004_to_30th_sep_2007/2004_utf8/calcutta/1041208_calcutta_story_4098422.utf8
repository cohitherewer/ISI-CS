 Brush strokes for bridal belles

Himika Chaudhuri

With 

the wedding season in full swing, Sananda, the leading Bengali magazine 

for women, in association with Chambor, organised a daylong talk on dressing up 

a bride. Chambor Sananda Kone Katha had an expert panel, including designer 

Sharbari Dutta, Ananya Chowdhury of Anjali Jewellers and make-up artist Aniruddha 

Chakladar. Actresses Nilanjanaa Sengupta and Konineeca Banerjee were the special 

guests.

 The panel covered three major aspects of a wedding look ? clothes, jewellery and make-up. ?Jewellery is synonymous with women?s empowerment and it?s essential for a bride to have her own set,? stresses Ananya. And it doesn?t have to cost the earth. ?We offer budget bridal sets for Rs 30,000,? she adds.

 Its best to stick to tradition on the clothes front, the experts feel. ?No matter how modern a girl gets, on the wedding day she looks best in shades of red,? says Sharbari Dutta. ?A bride should wear what she feels comfortable in. Wearing something odd to keep up with fashion trends isn?t a good idea.? Her advice was echoed by the actresses present. ?I loved wearing my mom?s red Benarasi sari for my wedding,? smiles Nilanjanaa. Konineeca, however, wants to go the whole elaborate hog, organising a sangeet and engagement as well. 

 Aniruddha Chakladar took over the stage next to dress up three girls with different skin tones. From dark to light, he took each of them through a makeover session, demonstrating both traditional and contemporary styles.

 The retail scene in Salt Lake?s tech hub, Sector V, is gradually coming to life. The latest entrant is a lifestyle furniture boutique by Godrej, which opened its doors on Tuesday.

 The GN block address was inaugurated by footballer Bhaichung Bhutia, a resident of Salt Lake. ?Just last week, my fianc?e had to go to central Calcutta to check out some furniture. Had we known this place was opening, we would have waited,? he smiled, looking around the 4,000-sq-ft store stocked with a range of Indian-made and imported home and office furniture. 

?People now look for convenience when they go shopping. 

A furniture shop offering such a wide variety will draw crowds from the Salt Lake 

area itself,? feels B.N. Doongaji, vice-president and business head, retail, Godrej 

 amp; Boyce. The store is designed to be a one-stop shop for anyone setting up 

house or overhauling their home or office. From the company?s mainstays ? refrigerators 

and steel cabinets ? to minimalist bedroom sets and lavish leather sofas, the 

store caters to tastes and needs across the board.

 The furniture is mostly in white wood, wrought iron and imported fibre, coupled with leather. Straight, clean lines make this ideal for young homemakers. The designs are space-saving and utilitarian. 

 Prices also start low. A bed in white wood with storage drawers is priced at Rs 12,000, while a sleek wooden study table with drawers and racks comes for just about Rs 4,000, as does a coffee table in glass and metal. The expensive buys are the leather sofas, which hover around Rs 7,000 for a one-seater. The show stealers, however, are dining sets with leather chairs and round glass-top tables.

 ?So far, we?ve been concentrating on office furniture. This new range of home furniture has just been added to our existing stores,? adds Doongaji. With three showrooms in Calcutta (Gariahat and Chowringhee besides Salt Lake), there are plans for a ?new look? outlet on Brabourne Road soon.

 Chic cuts

 Rich colours and snazzy embellishments are the way to perk up winter dressing if you go by designer Shradha Mankatala?s taste. This NIFT graduate supplies to Espee boutique on Rawdon Street apart from retailing out of her house (74 G/1A, Bondel Road). Her forte is Indo-western wear with emphasis on skirts teamed with kurtis and ponchos.

 For the marriage season, Shradha has designed ?contemporary wedding wear? comprising ?tight, stocking-like churidars? with short kurtas and stoles. 

 Embellishments include zardosi and Gujarati-style mirror work. ?You?ll find a lot of regional influences in my work,? smiles the designer. 

 Thus, bandhni (tie-and-dye), abla (mirror work) and floral motifs dominate her designs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buildings bond with fun, fervour

 In the reader?s hand every morning. Hand in hand with him during the Pujas. It is a bond that grows stronger every autumn. A bond called Boroplus The Telegraph Hand in Hand.

 Involving about 50 housing complexes spread across the city, the event heightens festive cheer in every courtyard by organising competitions, some of which are rooted in rituals while others are the staple of every informal gathering.

 Residents of the apartments that have signed up for the event are all brimming with anticipation.

 Says Pratima Chakraborty, joint secretary of the puja at Auroville Apartment, Mandeville Gardens: ?The events on the Hand in Hand calendar are our kind of events. We have been organising some of them through the years. So we were only too happy to take part.? 

The amount of flexibility afforded has also been a 

point of satisfaction. ?We wanted a proper quiz with a quiz master and designated 

teams instead of questions being lobbed at all present, as was suggested. Our 

proposal was immediately accepted,? she adds. She herself has signed up for dhunuchi 

naach and sankho badon, adding that she hopes to come up trumps with 

the conchshell. 

 For some, like Joy Bhattacharya of Hiland Park, it was the years of association with the newspaper as a reader that proved decisive.

 According to Rajat Sarkar, secretary of Sourav Abason in Karunamoyee, Salt Lake, the events also provide an opportunity for residents to get to know each other better. ?Ours is a one-year-old complex. We try to spend as much time together as possible during these four days.?

 Welcoming a helping hand, Satyaranjan Mukherjee, treasurer of the Hiland Park puja, says much of the fizz would be lost if he had to depend only on contributions to keep the show running. ?Already, the women are refusing to cook during the Pujas. That means an extra burden of nine meals.?

 There are reasons apart from sponsorship and spirit that make the residents look forward to Boroplus The Telegraph Hand in Hand. ?We are receiving multiples of the usual quota of entries this year, all for the lure of prizes that Hand in Hand brings,? laughs Sisir Ghosh, secretary of Purbachal Sarbojanin Durgotsab.

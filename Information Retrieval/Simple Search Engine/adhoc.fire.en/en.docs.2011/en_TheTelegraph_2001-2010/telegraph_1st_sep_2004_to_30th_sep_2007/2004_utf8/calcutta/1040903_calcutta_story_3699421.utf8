The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Isotope bath for sewage

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Pitching in for a cleaner Calcutta, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has decided to explore the feasibility of a high-tech sewage treatment scheme for the added areas and a supplementary conservancy service for the city proper.

 I want to explore the atomic irradiation technology of treating sludge, as an alternative to direct dumping of raw sewage, in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur. A Rs 730-crore underground sewer project has just been put in place in these areas. It was funded by the Asian Development Bank, said Mukherjee.

 The mayor has discussed the matter with municipal commissioner Debashis Som and has asked him to carry out a feasibility study.

 The Sludge Hygienisation Research Irradiator (SHRI) technology, developed by Bhaba Atomic Research Centre, treats urban sullage with radio isotopes. 

 Raw sewage will be stored in tanks at pumping stations, from where the sludge will be collected. After an isotopic treatment to free the sludge of harmful bacteria, it can be used as manure.

 We are eager to receive a positive response from the civic authorities, said Dr Anil Kakodkar, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. The technology has been successfully implemented in Baroda, he added. 

 Mukherjees second scheme is to deploy two mobile vats in the city proper on an experimental basis. They will supplement the existing trash collection and disposal facilities in Calcutta. The mobile vats will mainly collect trash from shops and establishments, the mayor explained. 

 Those who will miss the sweepers whistle can dump their litter in the mobile vats, said mayor-in-council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb.

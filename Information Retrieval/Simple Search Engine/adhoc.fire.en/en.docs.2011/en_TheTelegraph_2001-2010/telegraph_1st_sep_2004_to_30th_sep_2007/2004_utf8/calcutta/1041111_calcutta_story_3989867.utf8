 Railway 

staff held for theft

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An attendant and mechanic of South Eastern Railways, identified as Sandip Rana and Raj Kumar Nayek, were arrested on board an air conditioned coach of the Down Howrah-Mumbai Mail on Wednesday morning on charges of theft after a passenger, Sanjay Kumar, lodged a complaint with the GRP. 

 ?Kumar, who is an Army captain, complained that his wife?s purse was stolen after the Up train left Kharagpur. He had named three persons in the FIR. We have identified all three,? said superintendent of railway police (Howrah), Sunil Mallick. 

 ?Gautam Chatterjee, a mechanic and the third person named in the FIR, escaped from Santragachhi, where we had taken him to reconstruct the crime,? Mallick added. 

 The employees of the Santragachhi railway workshop demonstrated in front of the local GRP office to protest the arrests. A number of trains were delayed due to the agitation.

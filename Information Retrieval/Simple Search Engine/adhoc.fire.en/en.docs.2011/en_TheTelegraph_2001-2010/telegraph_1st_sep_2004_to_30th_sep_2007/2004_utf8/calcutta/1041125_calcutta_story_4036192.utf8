 Chinese chutzpah

 There are no more ?waiters? at Mainland China. That is Anjan Chatterjee?s take on the turn of events at the Gurusaday Road branch of the national chain.

 Which doesn?t mean the dining destination has gone the self-service way. But it does mean that the 140-seater eatery has grown another 90 covers, making it the largest restaurant of its kind in town.

 ?This space is to accommodate all those people who would have been waiting and may have even left disappointed,? says manager Debashish Ghosh. Even on some busy weekdays, patrons have a 10-to-30 minute wait before they are seated. 

 Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays have been constantly overflowing since it opened its kitchen four years ago. With the average group size hovering around eight heads at this popular restaurant, more space can only be welcome.

 The basement, which was previously reserved for banquets and busy seasons like the Pujas, has been converted into permanent seating. There is still a partition that can be put up for small groups. ?We don?t want to lose banquet customers who see Mainland China as a quality alternative to five-stars,? adds the manager. Now it has sprawling seating, with bright red sofas and a bar on one side creating a lounge-like feel. Even the first floor has been spiced up, with louder hues enhancing the cosy environs.

 Size apart, Calcutta?s favourite Chinese place has evolved in terms of substance. ?I have spent some time in Shanghai, which has its own distinctive style of cuisine, to incorporate new elements into the menu,? explains chef Rajesh Dubey. The changes have been implemented nationally. Shanghai food is apparently very different from Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine. ?More braising, soya and sweet are involved,? Dubey explains. There is enough spice too, with the authentic aroma of Sichuan pepper sizzling up seemingly sober orders. 

 A separate Dimsum menu has been introduced, with special emphasis on steamed and pan-fried food. ?Our clientele has started requesting these, and have moved away from deep-fried and saut?ed items,? adds Ghosh.

 So far, many factors have contributed to Mainland China?s success, with a key ingredient being the buffet. ?For lunch, around 80 per cent of guests opt for the buffet,? explains Ghosh.

 Regular changes have to be built in to the schedule. ?We try to keep our items as unique as possible, but as soon as we introduce them, so do other restaurants across the city. This confuses guests in terms of what they should expect from dishes,? observes Ghosh. Festivals pave the way for innovations. Now, there is a seafood promotion on, which brings lobster in interesting variations to the table.

 The new spread, they promise, is unlike anything the city has seen before.

 Couture czars power crystal craze

 After Versace, Alexander Mc Queen, Philip Treacy, Vivienne Westwood, Paco Rabbane and Thiery Mugler, there?s JJ Valaya, Suneet Verma, Manish Arora, Tarun Tahiliani, Mandira Wirk and Satya Paul!

 Before it pumps up your patriotic fervour, let?s hasten to add that the above-mentioned have all turned to the brilliance of crystals to jazz up their couture collections.

 The fall-winter 2004 designer lines have already seen a smattering of Swarovski razzle-dazzle and more is to follow. If JJ Valaya cuts a subtle shine in crystal trimmings and edgings of saris and dupattas, Manish Arora has used them to glittering effect on belts and bag handles, besides ready-to-use crystal neckpieces and crystal transfers.

 Transfers are something Valaya specialises in as well, apart from jazzing up his men?s line for the season with crystal buttons. ?I think crystals are the modern-day answer to the use of precious and semi-precious stones in Indian garments,? feels Valaya, who?s been the Swarovski brand ambassador for the past four years. 

 And if you thought crystals lost out to gems in terms of colour, think khaki. The latest in coloured crystals from Swarovski?s stable comes with a greenish tinge that is believed to be the rage the world over.

 ?Khaki has been voted by Vogue as the hottest colour of the season,? says Sanjay Sharma, country manager of Swarovski India. Reminiscent of the sand and the desert, khaki according to Valaya is a ?happy mix of the rough and the smooth?. 

 The palette extends to five yards in case of Satya Paul saris. Geometric abstractions and linear, kinetic forms defined by crystal powered the couture collection last season and are still going strong, claims a brand spokesperson. 

 To further strengthen the glitter game, Swarovski has now come up with a new quality-branding label called Crystallised With Swarovski to differentiate between fake and real Swarovski crystals.

 ?This is a step towards giving our customers value for money in a scenario where the brand has become generic to crystal. Today, Swarovski has become synonymous with anything that glitters,? claims Sharma. So much for gold!

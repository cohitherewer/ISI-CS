 Spurned in love, youth suicide

 - 17-year-old told beloved of decision to die

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Unrequited love drove 17-year-old Ritesh Agarwal to his end on Sunday. The student of Class XI jumped to his death from a Chowringhee highrise in what appears to be a premeditated suicide.

 ?Hum ja rahein hain, tum khush rehna (I am going away. Be happy),? the infatuated boy from an English-medium school in south Calcutta had professed to his beloved, on the phone, just minutes before taking his own life on Sunday around 9 pm.

 Residents of the area rushed to a narrow passage near Kanak Building on hearing a thud. They found the boy, in a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, bleeding heavily from serious head injuries.

 After police were alerted, they took Ritesh, son of a cloth merchant, to SSKM Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.

 ?It appears to be the fallout of unrequited love,? said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station. 

 ?We spoke to the girl, who lives in north Calcutta and is a year senior to the boy. She claims that to her, Ritesh was like any other friend, no more,? added the officer.

 Ritesh reportedly left his Salt Lake residence on Sunday afternoon to attend a private tutorial in the township. 

 ?He finished the coaching session as usual. But before leaving, he told his tutor it would be his last session,? recounted Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 ?This implies that he had decided to kill himself. The tutor didn?t think the statement was unusual, as Ritesh was scheduled to appear for his annual school examination, starting Monday,? the deputy commissioner added.

 Ritesh later made the telephone call to the girl. She was alarmed by the boy?s tone and informed her father about what had happened. ?The girl?s father contacted the nearest thana, following which an alert was sounded in police stations across the city. So, it took little time to identify the youth,? explained police.

 The Agarwal family, residents of CF block, Salt Lake, was not available for comment.

 Police are looking for clues to shed light on why the teenager would come all the way from his Salt Lake home to Chowringhee to take his life. Initially, police thought that he had made the trip to visit friends. But there is no evidence to support this view.

 The phone call to the girl and his final words to the private tutor confirm that the death was not an accident, feel police. Preliminary medical reports reveal that the youth died on impact from the fall. 

 ?Deep wounds were found on the head. The pelvic area was also fractured, indicating that he hit the ground in a sitting position,? said Sharma.

 ?We are still waiting for the post-mortem report to ascertain the exact cause of death,? clarified an officer from Shakespeare Sarani police station.

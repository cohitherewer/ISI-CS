The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Personal pleading preferred

SANTANU CHATTAPADHYA, director of consumer affairs and fair 

business practices, met readers of The Telegraph at his office on Friday to answer 

their queries Participants included S.C. Palit, Prabir Ghosh, Sandip Banerjee, 

Animesh Das, S.H. Khan, Pradip Pal, G. Laha, Tamal Roy and Subhasis Chakrabarty

Subhasis Chakrabarty: What is the legal status 

of the commission and how can it help us?

The directorate of consumer affairs and fair business 

practices is a quasi-judicial body, having branches in all districts of the state. 

The consumer affairs department, headed by minister Naren De, comprises the consumer 

affairs and fair business practices directorate and the legal metrology directorate. 

Consumer grievances are usually looked after by my directorate.

Animesh Das: How does the directorate function? 

Does one have to engage lawyers?

Our directorate is headquartered in Calcutta, while 

branches are spread across the state. If a bona fide consumer feels he has been 

cheated in any transaction and that he can prove his charge with documents, he 

can contact us. 

The directorate can also be approached if a consumer 

feels there is a deficiency in any service provided to him. 

As for the second question, lawyers are generally 

not needed to file a complaint, with either the directorate or the forum. However, 

if any consumer wants to appoint a lawyer, he can do so. We encourage consumers 

to plead their cases personally. 

Prabir Ghosh: I am getting inflated telephone 

bills since November last year. I have complained to the telephone authorities 

and, following their advice, have installed the dynamic lock facility. But the 

situation has not improved at all. Can I get any help from your department?

Telephones come under the service sector and one has 

to pay to avail of the service. Hence, as a consumer, you definitely have the 

right to lodge a complaint with us if you find any deficiency in the service or 

feel that you are being cheated. 

But in this particular matter, before lodging a complaint, 

please check out the type of service you are availing of.

Sandip Banerjee: Can consumers hope to get any 

benefit from the steps your directorate is taking?

I think statistics will indicate the success of my 

department in providing justice to the people. According to the available statistics 

(till March 2004), 61,664 cases were lodged with 20 units across the state. Of 

these, 56,114 were disposed of within 90 days. The increasing numbers of complaints, 

too, indicate that consumer awareness is spreading.

S.C. Palit: I have bought a leisure timeshare 

from a Chennai-based resort company, which has a branch office in the city. I 

had paid some amount to them about five years ago for a tour which was finally 

cancelled. I was asked to opt for another package, which I refused. Now, the company 

is refusing to return my money. I am 70 and cannot run from pillar to post for 

the money.

You have taken considerable time in approaching us. 

You have to approach the directorate office nearest to the city office of the 

holiday company. If you fail to locate the office, you can approach the headquarters. 

Our officials will guide you.

Animesh Das: What do we need to do to get the 

benefits of various consumer protection acts?

You have raised a crucial point. First, a consumer 

has to take a cash memo while buying a product. Secondly, he has to make sure 

the guarantee period or replacement scheme or any assurance that a trader gives 

while selling a product should be recorded. Besides, the shop has to be registered.

 A judicial magistrate was allegedly heckled and his wife bitten by CPM activists on Thursday morning for protesting the landfill of a pond adjacent to their house in the chief minister?s constituency. 

 Somnath Mukherjee, sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM), Burdwan, who lives in Gangulybagan, in the Jadavpur police station area, has lodged a complaint, but no one has been arrested. 

 The Mukherjee home is next to a 20-cottah pond. Around 9 am on Thursday, residents of the area noticed a group of youths filling up the pond. The youths claimed they had obtained permission for doing so from the state refugee rehabilitation department. 

 The residents protested and urged Madhuri, the SDJM?s wife, to join the protest. As soon as she came out, Subol, a local CPM activist, and his associates allegedly pounced on her. ?Subol bit me on the right hand and also beat me up,? said Madhuri. 

 Khokon Ghosh Dastidar, husband of Chandana Ghosh Dastidar, CPM councillor of ward 101 of Calcutta Municipal Corporation, and secretary of the CPM?s Central Jadavpur local committee, was present on the spot. He allegedly abused and manhandled the SDJM when he arrived on the spot.

 ?Control your wife. She is going too far,? Ghosh Dastidar reportedly warned Mukherjee, before pushing him to the ground. The youths allegedly threw mud at Mukherjee?s uncle, Monojit, 68, when he tried to save his nephew. 

 ?The pond has become a garbage dump. We wanted to convert it into a children?s park,? councillor Ghosh Dastidar?s husband claimed. ?Our partymen did not heckle or beat up anyone,? he added.

 The area?s residents said the actual motive behind filling up the pond was to raise a multi-storeyed building.

 ?The CPM leaders have filled up other waterbodies in the locality on the pretext of building parks and gardens. Multi-storeyed buildings have come up on those plots,? alleged Sankar Kundu, a local resident.

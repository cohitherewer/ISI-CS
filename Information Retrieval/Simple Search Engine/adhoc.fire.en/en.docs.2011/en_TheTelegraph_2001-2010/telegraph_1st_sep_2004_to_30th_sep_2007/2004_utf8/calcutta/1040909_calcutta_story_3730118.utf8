Inhuman: Deer gather near their dead mate left in neglect

Ticket no guarantee for a clean Memorial

 The report ?Walk the greens for a fee?, August 11, 

undoubtedly depicts a step in the right direction to save the sanctity of a structure 

as old and beautiful as Victoria Memorial. 

 The whip of discipline has been long due for callous visitors who are often found littering the gardens of the Memorial. 

 Unfortunately if morning-walkers are not aware of the nuisance they are causing, they should be ready to face the music. Since they are the ones who use the grounds, they should also not grumble about the entry fee. 

 It is a shame that passengers spit carelessly on the walls in Metro Railway stations. The filthy stains, thanks to gutkha and paan masala, along with the rubbish accumulating on the station premises in the form of cigarette and bidi butts, destroy the city?s solitary claim to cleanliness. 

 These are the same people who visit Victoria Memorial either as morning-walkers or drop in after office in the evening. 

 Thanks to the invasion of the campus by revellers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect the Memorial grounds from being littered with empty food packets, half-eaten snacks, empty water bottles etc. 

 But the most pertinent question that should be asked is whether the entry fee will only facilitate infiltration by mobile-toting affluent men and women, who are more often than not found to be habitual offenders and couples with dubious intentions. 

 They are the ones who, as a group, pose the biggest stumbling block towards maintenance of cleanliness at the Victoria Memorial grounds.

The picture-story ?Farewell, my friend?, August 10, raises serious questions regarding our nonchalance about other people in distress. In this jet age, we hardly have time to spare for others when they need us, even during somebody?s illness or a bereavement in the family. From the series of photos, it appears that all the deer in the enclosure had assembled to bid goodbye to their departed friend. If animals have fellow feelings, why is the sentiment becoming increasingly absent in our society?

The recent death of a wounded deer is proof of the 

deplorable condition at Alipore zoo. Surely, the funds, allotted for the nutrition 

and upkeep of the animals, are not being put to proper use. The animal welfare 

authorities at Delhi should look into the matter and take necessary steps to prevent 

similar occurrences in future.

While activists raise a hue and cry about animal rights, 

it was pathetic to see a dead deer being dumped carelessly by its keepers at Alipore 

zoo. 

Manju Bagri, 

Address not given. 

The recent death of animals at Alipore zoo clearly 

point to the misuse of funds and the authorities? total lack of concern for the 

animals in their care.

Apropos the report ?Cancer scare turns resident wrath on hospice?, August 11, it is sad that Somasree Roy, herself a cancer survivor, is facing difficulties in trying to establish a hospital. She is facing the same social hostility experienced by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in 19th century Bengal. While political parties are proving to be hurdles in the path of social progress, the role of the police, in this case, deserves appreciation.

It is heartening to note that an oncology department has been commissioned at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital for cancer patients (Oncology wing added, August 12). With cancer spreading like an epidemic through the city, this will definitely be appreciated. 

Purnima Vasudeva,

Rowland Road. 

Apropos the report ?War hero battles want in slum? (August 11), it is tragic that INA veteran Bal Bahadur Chetri has to subsist on a meagre income in a one-room ?home? that he has to share with eight family members. When will our politicians or officials give him the honour and respect that he deserves? 

Kajal Chatterjee, 

Sodepur. 

Apropos the report ?A plastic purchase?, August 9, it is welcome news that household plastic and polythene waste will now be bought from the doorstep. This way, the housewife gets to earn a certain sum and blockage of drains and sewerage systems can be averted. 

Govinda Bakshi,

Budge Budge. 

Apropos the report ?Private hospitals in rate slash spree?, August 12, kudos to private hospitals for offering subsidised rates on diagnostic tests, prescribed by doctors at state-run hospitals, to ease the load on government hospitals . 

Sourish Misra, 

Salt Lake City. 

The plight of child labourers employed in city households reveals that we are merely exploiting helpless, poor children under the pretext of helping them by giving them money, food, or a place to stay (Flee poverty, survive on abuse, pittance?, August 12). 

Debaprasad Mukherjee,

Nayapatty Road. 

In a picture caption on August 4, it had been mentioned that Ora Kara?, that is running in the halls now, is Amitabh Bachchan?s second Bengali film. It is actually his third. A little-known film called Jaban had been released in 1972. Anusandhan, his second, came decades later.

 You share your birthday with...

 Rati Agnihotri 

You have a spark that motivates people. Challenges and hard work don?t daunt you. You have an eye for detail. You pursue a policy of live and let live and consciously avoid harming others. You are drawn to soft-spoken and gentle people. You are averse to interference and like to work independently. ? Kusum Bhandari

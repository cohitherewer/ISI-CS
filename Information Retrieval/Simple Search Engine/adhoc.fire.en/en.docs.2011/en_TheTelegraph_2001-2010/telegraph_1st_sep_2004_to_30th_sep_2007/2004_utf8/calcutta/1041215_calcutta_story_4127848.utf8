The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Safety first, salary cut later

 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Today?s question: Should the day?s salary be deducted for all employees for absence on a bandh day? More letters will be published next week

 Transport trouble: A semi-deserted Howrah 

bridge on a bandh day

Virendra Shah

 Amratolla Lane

It is quite necessary and desirable that the day?s 

salary should be deducted for employees who are absent on a bandh day. At the 

same time, it should be kept in mind that the political parties are primarily 

responsible for bringing life to halt by calling bandhs. Once the root of the 

problem is eliminated, salary deduction would no longer be an issue. 

MD. Ayub, 

 Bright Street

Yes, the day?s salary should be deducted for employees 

who are absent on a bandh day. Recent bandhs have shown that most people do not 

support them. The few who do must be ready to suffer a paycut. But the government 

should make proper transportation and security arrangements, especially for women.

Gitanshu Naskar, 

 Howrah

Deduction of salary for absence on bandh days is not 

the right way to prevent bandhs. There is a certain amount of risk associated 

with venturing out on any bandh day. The only reason people stay at home on bandh 

days is because of this. Fear of a paycut might increase attendance in offices 

in the short term, but won?t be of much help in the long run.

Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia

There is some form of traffic disruption on almost 

every bandh day, forcing numerous employees to return home while on their way 

to work. Given the scenario, should the people be forced to attend office for 

the fear of suffering a paycut?

Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake

No, the day?s salary should not be deducted for all 

the employees who are absent on a bandh day. Before fining the employee, the authorities 

must find out the reason why he or she could not reach office. It is quite possible 

that some employees might have failed to reach office due to unavoidable circumstances.

Suvadip Goswami,

 Maheshtala 

Plenty of public transport was available during the 

last few bandhs. In such a scenario, employees should be fined for not attending 

office on the day. However, those who live in far-off places should be exempted 

from the purview of the paycut.

Abhijit Chakraborty, 

 Howrah

A section of poor people have to forego their daily 

bread as they cannot work on bandh days. Their plight is not taken into consideration 

by political parties while calling bandhs. These people have to suffer for reasons 

totally beyond their control. Given that, there is no reason that the government 

should make an exception in the case of its employees. They too, in all fairness, 

should suffer a paycut for not working on bandh days. It goes without saying, 

if someone can reach work, he or she should.

Tanushree Mukherjee,

 Chandernagore

It would be extremely unjust to deduct the salary 

of an employee for absence on a bandh day. Employees are not absent on bandh days 

because of personal reasons, but due to disturbance caused by others. Employees 

have nothing to do with bandh calls; they should not be penalised for something 

beyond their control. 

Ahasan Jahir Molla,

 Maheshtala 

No matter what the government claims, bandhs do affect 

life. Employees who reside close to their office can attend to their duties even 

on a bandh day. Those who live far away from their offices, however, often face 

insurmountable difficulties in getting there. Hence, I feel there should not be 

salary deduction for absence on a bandh day. 

Rabindranath Sarkar,

 VIP Nagar

I feel the government should have faith in the sense 

of responsibility of its employees. I feel most employees won?t be tempted to 

bunk office just because some party has called a bandh. But what can they do if 

vehicular and rail traffic is suspended or a tense situation prevails due to the 

bandh? Low attendance on a bandh day does not always mean that the employees support 

bandh or are enjoying a holiday. They should not have to pay for the offences 

committed by political parties by calling bandhs.

Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Burdwan

Paycut for absence on a bandh day cannot be supported. 

Disruption of traffic and sporadic violence are potent hindrances for most people. 

And the government cannot decide how its employees should perceive the threat 

of untoward incidents on a bandh day. It is a highly subjective issue. If state 

administrative machinery ensures law and order and normal life on a bandh day, 

only then paycut of errant employees is justified.

Sachindranath Mitra,

 Beleghata

Bandhs play the roll of safety valve in society. They 

prevent more violent forms of protest by the people. When the employers have the 

right to retrench, lock out, lay off and suspend, why can?t the employees have 

the right to observe a peaceful bandh? There is even a provision for strike as 

per industrial dispute act, 1947. According to Constitution, this is a welfare 

state. So, the government should look after the interest of the people, who, in 

any case, are not responsible for the bandh calls. 

Naren sen,

 Santragachhi

Such a rule can certainly be tried out on an experimental 

basis. But people who have genuine reasons to stay away from work on a bandh day 

should not be brought under its purview.

Satyen Biswas,

 Behala

It would be undemocratic to deduct employees? salaries 

for absence on bandh days. Not working on a bandh day is a type of non-violent 

protest. The government cannot take away this right of the people.

Reena Mukherjee,

 South Sinthee Road

There must be a paycut to send out the message to 

employees that bandh days are no different from other working days and have to 

treated so. Those who are serious about their work will find a way to reach the 

workplace no matter what may come on the way.

P. Pramanik, 

 Santoshpur

Yes, both public and private sector employees should 

suffer a paycut for being absent on bandh days. That would be one sure way of 

preventing bandhs. The government, on its part, should ensure easy availability 

of transport, not just on paper, but in practice.

Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 Barrackpore

Despite government assurances to the contrary, it 

has been seen that people who dare to go out on bandh days are often stranded 

due to blockades by bandh supporters. Under the circumstances, it would be highly 

unwise to introduce paycuts for those who are absent from office on bandh days.

D.P. Bhattacharyya,

 Sonarpur

Deduction of the day?s salary is a way to put pressure 

on employees to attend to their duties on a bandh day. Such a rule does not take 

into consideration what effect the bandh has on normal life, and hence, is extremely 

unfair. Employees, at least, should have the liberty to adjust their absence on 

bandh days against their leave dues.

Subhasish Majumdar,

 Sonarpur

An employee should not be punished for unintentional 

absence. Going out of the house during bandhs is dangerous. Can the government 

guarantee the safety of employees who venture out on bandh days? Unless it can, 

it should not deduct the day?s salaries for employees who are absent on a bandh 

day.

Saadia Sitwat,

 Fern Road

Certainly not, because most government servants do 

not have a shining white ambassador parked outside their houses to take them to 

work on bandh days. The majority, especially the female employees, has to take 

a risk by stepping out on a bandh day. If our state government doesn?t want to 

accept that buses have been burnt and vehicles smashed in our very own Calcutta 

on a bandh day, then, at least, can it please stop being so inconsiderate and 

unjustified?

 Emission rule flout triggers fine drive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Concerned over the spurt in violations of auto emission norms, the Pollution Control Board (PCB) and city police have begun a joint crackdown on errant vehicles. 

 Officials said on Monday that over 200 vehicles have been booked in the past 48 hours for plying without the requisite pollution under control certificates. 

 The surprise checks were part of the drive that got underway on Sunday.

 ?We are asking drivers of both private and commercial vehicles to produce the certificates. Those who don?t have one are slapped with fines of up to Rs 1,500,? said Shyamal Sarkar, PCB member secretary.

 On Sunday, two joint teams, comprising PCB engineers, traffic sergeants and other police officers, set up camps in Joka and on VIP Road, near Lake Town. ?On the first day, we fined 105 vehicles for not having the certificates,? said a PCB official.

 Monday?s surprise checks were conducted at Ultadanga and the Gariahat crossing. The officials booked 100 cars.

 A senior PCB official said: ?We are not checking the level of pollution. What we are asking for is the certificate showing the emission level.?

 Member-secretary Sarkar said the PCB will start the second phase of the drive from next week. ?In the second phase, we will check the emission level of the vehicles and action will be taken according to the result.? He said innumerable complaints about violation of norms had led to the drive.

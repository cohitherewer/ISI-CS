The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Prabhakar chatterjee

 Director of health services, government of West Bengal

 People are demanding so much that it is becoming 

tough to live upto their expectations. For instance, a would-be mother wants the 

doctor to sit at her bedside through all three stages of delivery and even when 

there is pain in the first stage, relatives rush to us. But if we restrict entry 

of relatives, we have to improve our act so there is no insecurity. We are trying 

to impose restrictions. But simultaneously we must improve communication among 

doctors, nurses and patient kin. A workshop on methods of communication has been 

held. But some are always upto mischief. If hoodlums get in, posing as patients 

relatives, there is nothing we can do. There are cases when a person gets in using 

a visitors card and throws it from the verandah so that someone else can come 

up using the same card. To prevent this, a card-punching system has to be started. 

But it is impossible to restrict entry at the main gate as outdoor patients come 

to the hospitals.

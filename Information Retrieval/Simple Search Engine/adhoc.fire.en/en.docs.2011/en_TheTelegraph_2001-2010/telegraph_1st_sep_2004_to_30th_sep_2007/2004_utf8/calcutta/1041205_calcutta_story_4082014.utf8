Livingstone, I presume

Whats in a name, when personalised marketing preys 

on a potential consumer?

SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

Mobile 

phones have this great advantage. When they ring, you can check who is calling 

you. Indeed, it often helps you prepare a quick excuse for a deed not done, an 

alibi for not attending a party, whatever. An unknown number is tricky. Your first 

reaction is to duck the call. Yet it is not a wise thing to do. You never know, 

it could be an invitation to have dinner with Sourav at Sourav?s!

It is with hopes of such improbable windfall that 

I picked up this call from a number I had never come across before. The male voice 

on the other side was less than pleasant. He was not impolite, but his tone was 

a little less than smooth. He verified my number. I still did not suspect anything. 

He said he was calling me on behalf of the mobile 

service provider who is in direct competition with the one I patronise. He was 

very candid. He said my allegiance to their competitor is what prompted him to 

call me. This was part of a programme of personalised marketing they had embarked 

upon.

He started by promising me multiple advantages if 

I switched to their network. While explaining, he forgot the multiplicity. His 

sole emphasis was on the fact that their calls are cheaper by quite a few paise. 

Be it a local call or a STD, he assured me that I stand to gain every time I made 

a call through them. 

Through questions that were not too subtle, he then 

learnt from me that I do have reasonably frequent occasions to make international 

calls. He was ecstatic. He again calculated the great savings that will accrue 

to me if I switched to their camp.

My response must have been less than warm. He immediately 

shifted his stance. His first question was a smart one and I fell for it. Two 

things did me in ? the sudden switch of topic and his apologetic tone. He asked 

me whether he had caught me in one of my busy moments. I blurted out that he should 

not worry as I was in my car on the way to a meeting.

That was enough information for him to change his 

line of attack. He explained to me again that theirs was a highly personalised 

programme. From the list of subscribers of their competitor, he confided they 

had picked only those who were important and influential. He then proudly announced 

that his call to me was part of that programme.

I must confess that I was feeling the effect. For 

people like me, who are not so young but still trying to be upwardly mobile, ego 

massage gives a great high. I felt elated enough to ask myself what is so great 

about my current service provider? I was about to ask my still anonymous caller 

if I switched whether they would let me continue with the last five digits of 

my current number.

This is when he dropped the brick. Keeping the same 

reverential tone, the great champion of personalised marketing on the other side 

of the line asked me his all-important question: Sir, may I know your name please?

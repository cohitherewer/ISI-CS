 Musicians with a message

 The atrocities and brutalities rampant in society fill us with sadness, anguish and outrage, making us despair when we think of the future in the light of such hatred and violence. On the occasion of Human Rights Day, Oxfam GB, in collaboration with Thoughtshop Foundation, presents an evening of music by Loknaad that touches our hearts and offers us renewed hope of a future where peace, unity and brotherhood prevail, and where men lead their lives with honour and dignity. Performed by Vinay Mahajan and Charul Bharwada, the songs are an expression of the pain and the courage of common people who have been victims of violence. The ?minstrels of social change? as they call themselves, denounce through their compositions, the cruelty, inhumanity and prejudice that are destroying our society, sending out an appeal for love, tolerance and understanding. Inspiring and heart-rending, their songs come across as voices of peace and hope in a fervent effort to put an end to social injustices and restore order and harmony in its place.

 Event: An evening of songs to mark Human Rights Day 

 When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

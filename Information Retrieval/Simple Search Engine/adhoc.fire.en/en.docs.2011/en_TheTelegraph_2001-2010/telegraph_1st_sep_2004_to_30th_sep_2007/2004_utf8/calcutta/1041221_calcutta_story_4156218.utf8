The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From item girl to gharwali

 Meaty role or not, Koena Mitra means only big banners. ?I don?t want to do solo roles in films with bad banners that people won?t even go to watch. I would rather have a small part in a big banner with good stars? ? that?s how the leggy model from Calcutta sums up her thumb rule. 

 In her first major release Musafir, Koena has stolen the few scenes she had bagged among the maze of high-profile players like Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor and Sameera Reddy. And as reports of a job well done trickle in, Koena seems happy to have at last got rid of the item girl tag that has tailed her since her Khullam khulla (Road) days. 

 ?There wasn?t much scope for me to act in Musafir. My character demanded a great looker and that?s what I am meant to be there. One of my songs (Saqi saqi) is also a huge hit.?

 The girl is now waiting to spring a surprise with her second film ? Raj Kumar Santoshi?s Insan co-starring Ajay Devgan, Akshay Kumar, Tusshar Kapoor, Lara Datta and Esha Deol, which releases on January 24. 

 As the ?talkative, bubbly and nagging wife? of Ajay Devgan, Koena has shed her sexy-siren image for a docile next-door-woman look, going all the way with churidar-kurta, sindoor and mangalsutra. ?Ajay is a strict cop and I am able to influence him in a different way. We are a total contrast as husband and wife. And I have only one shaadi song with him here,? chirps Koena.

The image makeover from sultry seductress to pious wife is not something she is bothered about. ?Everybody has put me in the sexy glamorous bracket and I have no problems with that. It?s because I can carry certain kinds of clothes and not look cheap. I have no inhibitions. But if the director believes I will suit a role in churidar-kurta I will definitely go and do it,? she asserts.

 Next up is David Dhawan?s trademark comedy Shaadi No. 1, co-starring Fardeen Khan, Zayed Khan, Soha Ali Khan, Esha Deol, Amisha Patel and Sanjay Dutt. 

 ?Here are three men who are always cheating on their wives, and Sanju is this rockstar who comes and spills the secret to the three women. There are three sisters also, two of whom are Esha and me. The third is not yet decided. I don?t know whom I have been cast opposite, but shooting starts in February,? says Koena about Shaadi No. 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Watch out to get wrist right

With most of the international big names 

in luxury timepieces available in Calcutta, its the right time to make a 

statement, says Zeeshan Jawed

If you believe that all your watch has to do is get 

you to work before the boss, you are way behind the times. With international 

brands bringing the best of the world?s luxury watches to town, a timepiece is 

not just an accessory, it is a statement.

Be satisfied with a humble leather-strap and round 

dial no more. Throw your credit card statement to the wind and give in to style 

and splendour. ?All the major international brands have set up offices in Delhi 

or Mumbai. So both awareness and accessibility have increased, leading to a boom 

in the watch market,? says Rajiv Chopra, managing director, Prime Watch World.

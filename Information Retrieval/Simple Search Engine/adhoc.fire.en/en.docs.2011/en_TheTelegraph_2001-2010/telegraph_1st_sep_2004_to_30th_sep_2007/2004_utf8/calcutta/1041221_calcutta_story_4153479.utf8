 Breath of life for tramcar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Trams are not going to be phased out from the city.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Monday unveiled a revival strategy for the century-old tramcar.

 ?The government has no intention of winding up tram services, though Calcutta Tramways Company is running at a heavy loss,? the minister told the Assembly.

 He said that efforts were on to introduce a light railway transport system from Barrackpore, in North 24-Parganas, to Sonarpur or Joka, in South 24-Parganas. ?This rapid transit system is the need of the hour,? he asserted.

 Chakraborty was replying to questions from Pankaj Banerjee, Trinamul Congress MLA and leader of the Opposition, and some other members of the Treasury and Opposition benches. 

 The minister informed the House that a global tender was floated a few months ago, and a consultative committee formed to examine the proposals and submit a report by next month. ?We will take a final decision after going through the report,? Chakraborty said.

 ?Tram tracks are being embedded in concrete to make them more durable. We have already renovated the tracks between Ballygunge and Park Circus. Renovation of tracks between Shyambazar and Galiff Street will be undertaken soon,? the minister said. 

 The government is also working on a strategy on how to commercially utilise the land in the seven tram depots in the city. The transport minister said that suggestions from an expert committee, constituted in 1995 to explore the possibility of commercially utilising the lands, could not be implemented due to legal problems.

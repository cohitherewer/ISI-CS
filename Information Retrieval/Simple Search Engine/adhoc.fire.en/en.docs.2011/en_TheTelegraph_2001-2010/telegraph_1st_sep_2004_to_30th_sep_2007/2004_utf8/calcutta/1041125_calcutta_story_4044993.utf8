 Stage route to awareness

 - Activists share experience and expertise, develop network

 Theatre, for these activists, is not a means of entertainment. It?s a tool of the trade ? creating awareness on issues ranging from politics to health. In areas where there are often no means of gaining knowledge or education, forum/action/live theatre is the only way of disseminating information. And the activists are a part of the same community.

 But it?s the lack of networking that?s hindering their work more than paucity of funds. What helps is exchange of ideas and communication between the different groups, to share expertise and experiences. It is with this purpose that Theatre for Development, a three-day workshop, has been organised by the British Council, at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre. 

 Participants comprise over 50 people from Siliguri, Orissa, Madhyamgram, Bandel, Malda, Tripura, Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, Banglanatak.com and even two groups from Bangladesh (one works with human rights while the other has gone as far as Afghanistan with street plays on safe motherhood and the benefits of iodised salt). The facilitators include Prof Ralph Yarrow of the University of East Anglia, UK, and John Martin, director, Vidya Project, a group from Ahmedabad travelling around the country with the two Englishman. ?We hope to make people from these communities the experts, instead of getting in outsiders,? said Martin.

 The issues under discussion range from the difficulties of getting through to hostile audiences, finances and how to better network with each other. As Spandan, a group from Bandel, explained: ?In Kidderpore, we had great trouble with our pulse polio immunisation play, because the people think it causes infertility. And in Purulia, we were told to leave with our save-the-wildlife play, because elephants had been on the rampage.?

 Hardship is a part of their existence. The group from Tripura uses housewives ? local villagers with free time in the afternoons ? as the vehicles. The Madhyamgram troupe members sell fish in the mornings and then report for theatre duty in the evenings. But they firmly believe that while a little more money would help, corporate sponsorships would dilute the message. ?They use activities like games, so it?s the methods that matter more,? added Prof Yarrow.

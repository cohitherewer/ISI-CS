The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 There are a number of large waterbodies in and around the city that can be 

utilised for scientific practice of pisciculture. It will not only add to the 

fish supply in the local markets but also generate employment opportunities for 

the youth. The South Dum Dum Municipality has undertaken a similar project in 

Lake Town, which is really commendable. Other civic bodies should take similar 

measures to augment their revenue as well as save the wetlands from being usurped 

by promoters. 

 Rabindra Nath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane. 

 While travelling by local train from Sealdah to Diamond Harbour or Canning, 

I have noticed that at several stations hawkers sell drinking water in glass bottles. 

No one knows whether the water is fit for consumption. Some vendors also sell 

spurious soft drinks. At Howrah station, where first-timers to the city land, 

unaware of the flourishing illegal practice, the masses are unable to differentiate 

between the real and the fake. The authorities should take measures to stop the 

sale of fake products at stations.

 One of the main aims of the Bangla Akademi is to popularise the states vernacular language. Recently, I noticed that the list of the programmes and some other notices at the Akademi were printed only in English. Shouldnt the information be displayed in Bengali as well?

 The railway authorities should introduce a superfast train to Bangalore via 

Hyderabad. The route should be such that the journey doesn?t take more than 24 

hours. Many from the city study or work in Bangalore and travel between Calcutta 

and Bangalore quite frequently. The absence of a direct superfast train causes 

much inconvenience to them. The Howrah-Yashwantpur Express also should be speeded 

up. 

 Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park. 

 I wish to draw the attention of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to the deteriorating 

garbage disposal system and the miserable sanitary condition in the Linton Street 

(near the Beniapukur Vidyapeeth) area. The problem can be attributed to the improper 

method of garbage disposal in the locality. The stagnant water is a breeding ground 

for mosquitoes and flies. I request the civic authorities to take steps to prevent 

the dumping of garbage in the open. If the unhygienic practice is not stopped, 

it can lead to an outbreak of diseases during the monsoon. 

 Ghulam Akbar, Linton Street.

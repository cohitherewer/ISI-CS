 Stench, snakes and sewage

 - Faulty drains leave housing estate awash

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Residents of the Thakurpukur housing board complex at Ramchandrapur, on the southern fringes of the city, have been marooned for days together for faulty construction of the drainage network. 

 Since neither the departmental minister nor officials concerned looked into the matter, residents have decided to organise demonstrations and put up roadblocks.

 In a letter written to housing and public health engineering department minister Goutam Deb, members of the Thakurpukur Cooperative Housing Society stated: ?The residents-cum-allottees in general have lost faith in the welfare motive of the government and have been venting their grievances against the board of this society almost daily. There is a possibility of them resorting to undemocratic means to extract their legitimate demands any time, and the situation may go beyond our control at that stage.? 

 Cooperative secretary Asim Kumar Pattanayak said they had met board commissioner Samar Saha last month-end, but he could not offer any hope of draining out the water through which the residents are forced to wade.

 The problem has been created by the existing drainage system, which was built at a cost of about Rs 60 lakh paid by the flat-owners. But it did not function, because the level of the drain is higher than the plinths of the buildings.

 Pattanayak said rainwater mixed with sewage is playing havoc and the place stinks all the time. The mosquito menace has become intolerable. Poisonous snakes are crawling inside the houses. A bad smell is spreading and polluting the atmosphere. There is practically no outflow from the inner drain into the main outer drain. Instead, sewage from the outer drain is reverting to the housing complex. 

 ?Our worst fear is that sewage water will seep into the drinking watertank,? said Pintu Bhattacharya, a resident of the estate.

 When they had drawn his attention to the problem, the board commissioner told them that it can be solved only after the dredging of Tolly?s Nullah is complete. ?But the reply was not reassuring enough as even today, it is not certain when the work will start,? he said. 

 The Thakurpukur housing complex was planned in three phases. Work on the first phase was completed four years ago. It has about 850 flats, of which 250 are occupied. Another 150 flats have already been sold but the occupants have not arrived. 

 Resident Subrata Sengupta said when the flats were sold four years ago, ministers had made tall promises. Now, everything is wrong.

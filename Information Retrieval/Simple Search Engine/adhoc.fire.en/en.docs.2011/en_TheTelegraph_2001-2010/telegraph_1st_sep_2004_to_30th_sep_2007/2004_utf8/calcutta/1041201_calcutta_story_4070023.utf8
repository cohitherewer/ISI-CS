 Salt Lake nod for cell towers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Following directives from the state and central governments, the Salt Lake municipality will allow cellular phone operators to set up base transreceiver stations (BTS) in the township, but has added some riders to the approval.

 The decision on the approval was finalised at a board meeting of Bidhannagar Municipality on Tuesday. 

 ?We have entered the era of hi-tech communication and we have to allow the requisite infrastructure to be built,? said Dilip Gupta, chairman of the municipality. 

 ?We had opposed the setting up of towers on residential buildings or in parks, as it is against our building rules,? he added.

 The municipality has set some guidelines for construction of towers. A certificate from a government-approved structural engineer and an approval from the state urban development department will be required. 

 Also, the towers cannot be taller than the height stipulated in the building rules. 

 ?The operators must ensure that local residents do not face any problem,? municipality chairman Gupta said. 

 A team of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited officials had held discussions with the civic authorities on setting up towers in Salt Lake for better connectivity. ?We are expecting other private operators to apply for setting up towers, too,? the civic chief said.

 According to officials, the residential buildings, where these towers will be set up, will have to pay property taxes on commercial rates. 

 ?We have applied for setting up towers in Salt Lake,? confirmed Atanu Ghosh, general manager, cellular mobile telephone services, Calcutta Telephones. ?We are conducting a survey for setting up more towers and Salt Lake is a part of that scheme.?

 Although there are a number of BTS towers in Salt Lake, they were not initially approved by the municipal authorities. ?We had to slap penalties and regularise the structures,? chairman Gupta said. 

 According to officials, the main problem is that the residential buildings are in congested areas and construction of the towers can be unsafe.

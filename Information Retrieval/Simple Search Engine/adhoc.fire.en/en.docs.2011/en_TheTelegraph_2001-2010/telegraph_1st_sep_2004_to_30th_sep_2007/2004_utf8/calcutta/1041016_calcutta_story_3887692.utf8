The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shop till you smile 

Your 

smile ought to get as big as your shopping bag if you take the month-long Ha-ha-ha 

fest at Shoppers? Stop to heart. Supported by CRY (Child Relief and You), the 

proceeds of the fest will go towards the development of underprivileged children. 

All you need to do is purchase a stick-on smiley worth Rs 5 as you go about picking 

up more tangible goodies.

 Cartoonist Prriya Raj kicked off the fun with the caricature of two of the underprivileged children present, against a colourful backdrop of countless smileys. ?It?s so simple to bring a smile on a child?s face? Do buy a smiley and spread the happiness,? urged Raj.

the premiere of their film Shudhu Tumi, directed by Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit 

Guha, at Bharati Cinema on Friday. Prosenjit plays the leading man. Picture by

If your funny bone is yet to be tickled, catch Om 

Katare?s theatre group Yatri perform Hadd Kardi Apne on weekends. Caricature 

and mimic artists, celebrity look-alikes and live jam sessions will bring up a 

hilarious rear.

 Stick smart

 If pandal-hopping is not up your street, indulge in some parallel festivities by taking to Navratri nights. 

 The Navratri Mahotsav at Stadel, the hotel tucked away inside Salt Lake stadium, is one of the options to boogey the night away. 

 Organised in association with Payel, Suromallika and Nimble Fingers, the fest is a one-stop spot for Dandiya, live Gujarati music, food and even some last-minute gift shopping by way of handicrafts being displayed by Nimble Fingers. And there?s no need to rush home early for that special spread either. A Bengali dinner buffet, on from October 20 to 23, should keep the hungry gang happy.

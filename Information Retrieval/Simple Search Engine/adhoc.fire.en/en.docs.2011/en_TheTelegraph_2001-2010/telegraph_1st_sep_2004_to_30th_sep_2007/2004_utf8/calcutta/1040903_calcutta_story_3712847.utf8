Gaming gala 

Its back and big. The fourth game in the Potter series 

is different from its predecessors in many ways. First, youll need a really up-to-date 

PC with loads of memory and processor muscle to play (even sluggishly) this game. 

After that, the opening shot of a wolf howling (Black!) with the Hogwarts Express 

chugging along in the background promises a great fantasy ride. There are lots 

of new spells, including one to conjure a Dementor. Harry, Hermione and Ron (and 

even Fred and George) look and sound grown-up and you can play as either of the 

three. A ride on Buckbeak the Hippogriff is an added bonus. Unlike the previous 

versions, when you die during the game you restart at exactly the same spot. Apart 

from the all-flavoured beans, there are cauldron cakes and pumpkin patties to 

collect, which can be traded for goodies at Fred and Georges shop. The graphics 

are much better too, making the Hogwarts Castle come alive, particularly in the 

areas previously unexplored.

 Diminutive diver

Hes young, but not quite as young as he looks. The 

14-year-old is four feet six inches in height and 66 pounds in weight. But Bryan 

Nickson Lomas is already a sports star. The Malaysian might have finished 19th, 

but the diminutive diver was one of the youngest Olympians in Athens. And definitely 

dwarfed by the 10m platform that was his stage. The aim of the boy from Kuching, 

Sarawak, was to get to the semi-finals, and that he did, well above the qualifying 

points required. The Olympics was only his fourth international event so far, 

after the SEA games in Vietnam, the diving World Cup in February and the China 

Open in April. But Bryan has several national gold and silver medals under his 

belt. A big splash for a little lad.

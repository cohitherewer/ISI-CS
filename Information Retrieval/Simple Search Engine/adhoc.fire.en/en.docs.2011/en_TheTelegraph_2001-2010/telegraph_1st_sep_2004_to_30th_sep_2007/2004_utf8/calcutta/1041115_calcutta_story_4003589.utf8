 Trauma care makes debut

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In Calcutta, nearly 450 people die in road accidents every year, and a few hundred more lose their limbs or become paralysed after suffering a massive heart attack from trauma-related injuries. 

 ?The first few minutes are very critical and that is the period when a person has the best chance of survival, even in a near-fatal accident. But sadly, we don?t have enough personnel or expertise to handle trauma cases better,? said Sourav Koley, critical care specialist in Calcutta.

 All that is likely to change when the city?s first-ever trauma care hospital opens on Monday. The Rs 27-crore hospital, a joint venture of the Armenian Church of India and the Asia Heart Foundation, is the first such project in eastern India, which started a year ago after the state government greenlighted it.

 Between 1998 and 2004, at least 38 people died on the city streets, and the trend shows no sign of decelerating. Doctors believe it is mainly owing to the lack of timely attention and proper medical care.

 For some time, critical care specialists in the city were trying to teach cardiac resuscitation to the police force. It is an important technique for reviving trauma-affected people. 

 However, with little to show for all that, the government decided a few years ago to start its own trauma care hospital at SSKM Hospital and another such unit was planned at Medical College and Hospital. The foundation stone for such a hospital was laid at SSKM Hospital, but the project never got underway due to lack of funds.

 Finally, early last year, the Armenian Church members and Devi Shetty, chairman of the Asia Heart Foundation that runs the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences, at Mukundapur, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, placed the proposal before the government, which soon okayed it.

 The 300-bed hospital will have a 30-member medical team throughout the day, on duty 24 hours, for the benefit of patients who could be rushed in for trauma care any moment. Apart from state-of-the-art neuro-surgery speciality, the hospital has all top-of-the-line medical equipment to tackle urgent cases of orthopaedics, neurology, nephrology and urology. 

 Housed on the same campus as the Mukundapur hospital, the trauma care centre will have cardiac specialists from the mother hospital to take care of the cardiology part of the treatment, explained vice-chairman Aloke Roy, himself an expert in nuclear medicine. 

 ?The treatment will not be expensive. A dilation facility will be available for Rs 700 and CT scan for Rs 800 only. If a patient is poor, we won?t charge him anything at all,? Roy added.

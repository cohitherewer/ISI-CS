 Twist in lost script case

 - Student trio cleared, HS exam centre officials under cloud

 Five months after three Higher Secondary (HS) answer-scripts mysteriously found their way from an east Calcutta school to a ditch by the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, the needle of suspicion swung towards some officials at the examination centre.

 A probe conducted by the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education has given the three examinees a clean chit, finding no reason to believe that they could benefit in any way by smuggling out their answer-scripts.

 All three students of St Lawrence School who appeared for their HS from Tiljala High School, have fared well.

 ?We examined the scripts thoroughly, but found no pointer to the candidates? bad intentions. The inquiry confirmed that the fault was someone else?s,? said HS Council president Jyotirmoy Mukherjee.

 ?A fresh probe has been launched to identify the guilty. Stern action will be taken against them, since the lapse could have damaged the careers of three students,? he added.

 In April, after their mathematics second paper, the scripts of Amartya Sengupta, Nikhil Goenka and Kushal Patel were reported missing by the invigilators, who alleged that the three students had left the exam hall without submitting their scripts. Normally, missing scripts are not evaluated. This time, however, an exception was made, and so their results were tracked.

 Within a few days after the council initiated a probe, Nikhil and Kushal received their results. Amartya?s results, however, were withheld till ?some circumstantial evidence? against him was cleared.

 Nikhil scored first division marks, cleared the joint entrance examination and joined a private engineering college in the city. Kushal got a second division. Amartya, according to a relative, secured first-division marks and is currently studying marine engineering.

 ?We still don?t know what the truth is. We cooperated with the council and the council cooperated with us throughout. We are happy that all three boys have been awarded good marks and have been admitted to good colleges,? said Fr K. Thottam, vice-principal of St Lawrence School. 

 ?I am told that the HS council is now looking into the other side,? he added.

 ?I don?t feel any teacher would commit such a heinous act, unless some individual bore malice towards the student or the system, or was trying to seek vengeance in some way,? Fr Thottam opined.

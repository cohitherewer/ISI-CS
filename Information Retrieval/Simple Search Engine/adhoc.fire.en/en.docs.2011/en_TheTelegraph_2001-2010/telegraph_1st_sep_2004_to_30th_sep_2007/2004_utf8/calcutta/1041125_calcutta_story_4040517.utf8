The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mayor targets porticos

 - House-owners 

cry foul, demand damages

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 

 Calcuttans have long associated garibarandas (porticos) with pomp and pelf, but if mayor Subrata Mukherjee has his way, there won?t be many left in the city. Mukherjee said on Wednesday that Calcutta has the least amount of roadspace among Indian cities and the traffic load on them has grown 10-fold over the past 40 years. And one of the ways of augmenting the road infrastructure is getting rid of the hundreds of porticos in the city, he added. 

 The mayor said the existing roadspace can be increased by nearly 20 per cent by trimming the pavements and on some of the major arteries, like Sarat Bose Road, SP Mukherjee Road, Bidhan Sarani and APC Road, several balconies overlooking the pavements have been the main stumbling block in trimming the kerbs.

 According to a Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) building department estimate, about 4,000 balconies jut over the pavement from 350,000 buildings in the city proper. The balconies comprise about 1.14 per cent of the space occupied by the buildings. ?Why should any sensible person scrap a road-widening programme for the convenience of such a small number of house-owners?? the mayor asked.

 General secretary of House-Owners? Association Amar Mitra said: ?We have convened a meeting of our members and we will submit a memorandum to the mayor and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya.?

 Mitra said all the balconies overlooking the pavements have been sanctioned by the CMC after taking requisite fees from the house-owners. ?If the CMC now plans to demolish the balconies, it must pay compensation,? he added.

 ?We are not demolishing all the balconies as a policy measure. Only balconies falling under the road-widening project might be demolished. We will first appeal to the house-owners for cooperation,? said mayoral council member (roads) Anup Chatterjee.

 ?The sanction for the extension of a balcony over the pavement was given under the CMC Act of 1951 and there was a condition that the balconies could be demolished in the interest of the city?s development. Hence, the question of paying compensation does not arise,? said the CMC?s deputy chief law officer Shaktibrata Ghosh.

 The CMC director-general (building) Ashok Roychaudhury pointed out that several such balconies were demolished during the widening of Amherst Street in the late 1970s and the construction of the Metro Railway.

 Four decades of clay creations

 The auditorium at the Government College of Art and Craft on Tuesday was packed with students ? many seated and many more standing ? gazing in rapt attention. The focus was on an 81-year-old murmuring in soft and slow Japanese. As he stood up with a mound of clay in hand, necks craned forward. It is not every day that a master in ceramic art gives a live demonstration.

 Soei Obiya is in Calcutta as a guest of the local consulate-general for Vision Japan 2004, the nine-day cultural extravaganza. If he is called a living legend, it is perhaps because he uses his bare hands to give shape to the most intricately-designed pots. 

 In Los Angeles, people asked him why he did not use a potter?s wheel. In Poland, there was a queue to shake his hand. ?People thought it was the hand of god. But the human hand can do so much,? Obiya smiles warmly. 

 The audience soon had proof of just how much. He went on to shape the mound of clay into a sphere, hollow in the middle, just with his thumb and palm. 

 As the applause gradually subsided and the interaction came to an end, the octogenarian, speaking through translator Kazuko Nigam, insisted that his art was the result of divine assistance.

 Obiya was not always such a deeply religious man though. ?Ten years ago, my house of 25 years burnt down. Nothing of value could be saved. Our savings of 3,00,000 yen were reduced to ashes.? It was one day after that when he perceived Lord Buddha in a pot he was shaping. ?Since then, I feel an immense sense of gratefulness for every piece I create.?

 There was an element of the supernatural in Obiya?s taking to the potter?s path as well. ?Three people had predicted that I would be a master potter when I was a child, but I never bothered to touch clay.? 

 While earning his living as an art evaluator (having learnt painting since the age of three), he visited a potter at the age of 36. ?It was a sheer coincidence. He asked me create something and was extremely impressed with what I produced.? 

 But it was not till 41 that he considered taking up pottery as a profession and set up a kiln on the outskirts of Hachioji City in Tokyo. His work has been in demand from Japan?s foreign ministry, mainly as gifts to other state heads from the Premier. 

 Obiya himself has visited many countries, holding lectures, workshops and demonstrations. It is Paris that he looks back to with the greatest fondness. ?I was called the magician from the Orient and the audience at the Japan Cultural Institute gave me a standing ovation.?

 Even as a tourist, Obiya?s eye is always on interesting structures. ?I like buildings, especially their roofs.? So a visit to Taj Mahal leaves him talking about just the monument?s dome. ?I had created such a lid of a pot just before coming to India,? he says excitedly.

 Talk of the future, though, casts a shadow over his face. ?The end of the 20th century was a period of change for art. Even abstract art can appeal to people if the creator?s heart is pure. But these days, artists are so preoccupied with money and name that art is suffering.?

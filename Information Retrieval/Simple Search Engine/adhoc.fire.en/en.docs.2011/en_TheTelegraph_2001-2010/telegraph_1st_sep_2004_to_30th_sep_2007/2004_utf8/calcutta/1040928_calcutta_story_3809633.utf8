The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Snag hits Metro services

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Peak-hour Metro Railway services were thrown haywire on Monday morning, when power supply to the third rail tripped at Jatin Das Park station. 

 Trains remained suspended for over half-an-hour. Seven trains, including four Dum Dum-bound ones, were cancelled and three rescheduled. 

 A packed Dum Dum-bound train was entering Jatin Das Park station around 10.25 am, when it slowed down abnormally, before coming to a halt at the station. 

 For a while, the passengers thought it was a normal stop and that the train would start running after the scheduled interval. 

 But within minutes, Metro officials announced that a power link had snapped and services would not resume till the supply was restored.

 ?We had no choice. The Up train, TD43, had to be halted as power supply to the third rail tripped at the station,? explained Metro spokesperson S. Mahapatra. 

 As a spin-off effect, services from Dum Dum, too, were disrupted. In order to save the situation partially, the Metro authorities decided to operate on a truncated route, between Dum Dum and Maidan stations. 

 Hordes of passengers were stranded at stations from Tollygunge to Rabindra Sadan, hoping that the services would resume any moment. Many were forced to avail of the services overground to reach their destinations.

 Even the trains that ran on the truncated route were packed much beyond their capacity. Passengers were seen jostling with each other while boarding or getting off at Sovabazar and Mahatma Gandhi Road stations. 

 ?As the trains were overcrowded, we had to run at a very slow speed to ensure safety of the passengers,? said a motorman of a train at Sovabazar station.

 In order to avoid a rush, the authorities refunded many tickets and waited till 11.15 am before issuing fresh tickets. 

 Passengers protested when they learnt that tickets were not being issued. 

 ?They kept shouting at us, thinking that it was another case of suicide. But we tried to explain that it was a technical fault that could happen any day,? said a supervisor at Tollygunge station. 

 Had tickets been issued even while the services remained disrupted, the crowd would have become unmanageable, he argued.

 High hopes: Children have the right to shelter 

of the law 

Apropos the report ?Crater cover in Premji path?, 

November 19, there is perhaps no denying the fact that most of the roads in Salt 

Lake are in an utterly deplorable state due to the neglect and the lackadaisical 

attitude of the Bidhannagar Municipality and the state government. 

 This is amply proved by the state government?s drastic efforts to camouflage the ravaged roads with patchwork on the eve of IT baron Azim Premji?s arrival in the city to inaugurate Wipro?s facility in Salt Lake Electronic Complex. 

 Astonishingly, when most stretches of the road connecting Salt Lake with New Town remained unrepaired for years, causing much discomfort to people entering the township through Rajarhat, the hasty burst of action ? to impress a business tycoon ? proved how much can be done if there is will. 

 If all the repair activities were because of Premji?s visit, then I guess, Salt Lake residents have no other option but to pray that he visits the township again and again. If on one such visit he decides to take a roundabout route, perhaps even the illegal settlers would be evicted and the roadside garbage cleared! 

Sunil Banerjee,

Minors are, beyond doubt, citizens of the country (Platform for child plight, November 13). Hence, when they face social injustice, they should be eligible for the same support of the law as adults. 

 If children want to lodge a complaint with the police, they should be allowed to do so. There are many minors in the country who do not have guardians or have guardians who do not look after them. They can very easily become victims of social injustice if they face a hurdle while lodging complaints with police. The cops should be duty-bound to investigate into complaints of minors. 

 The plan to start a national children?s commission must be widely supported. Such a commission would go a long way in protecting the rights and interests of minors. 

 The tendency to exploit minors must be rooted out. The government and social organisations should work hand in hand towards that end. The minors must not feel they are helpless before the law. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

This is apropos the article ?Sport no draw, decide cablemen?, November 23, on city multi-system operators discontinuing ESPN STAR Sports on their beams. The feed at my home comes from Manthan which, as your report makes clear, has arbitrarily decided to stop beaming the sports channels as a mark of solidarity with Indian Cable Net. Why should Manthan viewers be penalised because of the multi-system operator?s attitude? 

Jit Gupta,

Apropos ?Howrah hall in disrepair?, November 18, it was disheartening to know that the authorities have not yet started the repair and renovation of the Howrah Town Hall due to lack of funds. The state government should come forward with financial help to renovate the hall. Ideally, it should join hands with the municipal corporation to ensure that the building is properly renovated. 

Sourish Misra,

Salt Lake.

It is rather disconcerting that the Howrah Town Hall 

is now in a state of disrepair. The way the 142-year-old structure is being neglected 

is quite shocking. It is not merely a building, but a document of the past. 

Anil Kumar Sen,

Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.

The report ?A winter guest headcount?, November 19, dealt with a matter of grave concern. Living close to Subhas Sarobar, I know how rapidly the number of migratory birds visiting our city is declining. The changing skyline has a hand in it. Hopefully, the proposed census of migratory birds will help the state government design at least two new tourist projects at Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar. Thus, the cost of saving the habitats of migratory birds will be accrued from the pockets of tourists. 

Debashis Pathak,

Sura Cross Lane. 

The number of migratory birds visiting the city during 

winter has been steadily declining over the last few years. Mainly because of 

the increasing pollution level in the city and because they are killed in large 

numbers for meat. This trend should immediately be halted. 

Prahlad Agarwal, 

Majdia, Nadia. 

Apropos the report ?Twin fund raiser projects on 60 surplus acre?, November 15, CMDA had allotted plots in East Calcutta Township in early 1989 for another project. Most of those who had been allotted plots in the FC block could not build houses there, as the plots were occupied by shanties. Also, a foul smell emanates from the local canal, which, besides being a breeding ground of mosquitoes, serves as the toilet of the slum dwellers. These people have even built huts on the land of the cash-strapped CMDA which they let out. 

Bidisha Sengupta,

Address not given. 

It is a matter of concern that about Rs 15 crore was lost in the fire at Calcutta port. The incident only shows how poor our fire-fighting system is. The port authorities should take proper steps to prevent such accidents. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

Rakhal Ghosh Lane. 

The report ?Boy with the answers?, November 19, made for pleasant reading. Hats off to Shubham Prakhar for his success. He is, indeed, a little genius. 

Debyani Basu, 

Bisharpara.

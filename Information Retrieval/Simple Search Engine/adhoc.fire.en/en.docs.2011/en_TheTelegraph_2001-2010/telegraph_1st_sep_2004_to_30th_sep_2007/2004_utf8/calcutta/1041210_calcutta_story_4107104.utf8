 The consumer affairs department will deploy inspectors at major markets and malls in the city to prevent customers from being fleeced or buying goods with fake labels. 

 This will be part of the ?consumer protection programme?, to be finalised on Friday at a meeting called by departmental minister Naren De. 

 According to the plan, inspectors will be deployed at 30 markets and shopping malls, including Shoppers? Stop, Charnock City, Pantaloons and City Centre. 

 The inspectors, who will be assisted by volunteers of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), will verify the weights and measures of various goods and cross-check the authenticity of packaged commodities and export items. 

 If any foul play is detected, the goods will be seized and the trader booked. 

 Consumer affairs department officials will also hold meetings with traders to make them aware of the rules and with consumers to explain how their grievances could be redressed. 

 ?Our move is aimed at protecting the rights of consumers,? said minister De.

 ?The decision to deploy inspectors follows the seizure of thousands of fake and doubtful packaged commodities and faulty weights at various markets, including major shopping malls,? explained legal metrology (consumer affairs department) controller Ashok Bhattacharya.

 He told Metro: ?By stationing our men and NGO volunteers at markets, we want to keep the traders under constant surveillance. And we want to step up our vigil before the year-end shopping spree peaks.? 

 According to officials, nearly 150 traders had been booked and around 500 items seized from 30 big markets over the past six months. The inspectors had collected nearly Rs 3.26 crore from the errant traders as penalty.

 The seized items include packaged drinking water, soaps and detergent, biscuits, spices, fruit juice, sweets, garments, foreign perfumes and noodles. 

 ?The items were doubtful, faulty and underweight and there was no proof of their genuineness,? an official said. 

 Apart from raiding markets and shopping malls, the inspectors had conducted surprise checks at various hotels, bar and restaurants. Thirty errant traders were detected and fined for selling packaged drinking water and beer above the printed maximum retail price (MRP), according to controller Bhattacharya.

 Besides the checks, the department will issue booklets, detailing the rules and regulations, the rights of consumers and how to tell genuine goods from fake ones. 

 Among others, the booklets will be distributed to customers at the entrance of all big markets.

 ?We are taking all possible steps to protect consumers from being cheated. But at the same time, consumers, too, will have to cooperate with us in booking the errant traders,? minister De said.

 ?If you find a particular item at a shop doubtful, inform us immediately at our 45, Ganesh Chandra Avenue office or call us at 22256447. We will book the trader within 24 hours,? he asserted.

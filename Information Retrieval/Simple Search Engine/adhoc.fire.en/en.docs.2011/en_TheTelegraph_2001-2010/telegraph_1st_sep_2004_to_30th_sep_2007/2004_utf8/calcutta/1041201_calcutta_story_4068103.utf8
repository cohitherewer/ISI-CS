The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Road repair buck passes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Faced with public outrage over the condition of city roads, Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has put up billboards on some of the affected roads, pleading its inability to undertake repair work. 

 ?Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) is responsible for maintaining the major portion of the roads having tram tracks,? states a billboard on the crossing of BB Ganguly street and Bidhan Sarani. 

 While the tracks and the area within 1.5 feet on either side come under the CTC?s jurisdiction, the civic body is responsible for maintaining the rest of the road, the billboard further adds. The announcement makes it clear that the CMC will not repair the tracks or the portions of road along them. 

 ?The billboards have been put up to clear public misconception about the CMC?s responsibility. They clarify our position,? mayor Subrata Mukherjee asserted on Tuesday.

 ?I know at least 10 roads, including BB Ganguly Street, Bidhan Sarani, Rabindra Sarani, MG Road and Kidderpore Road, which are in a horrible condition, with accidents occurring at regular intervals. Even then, I shall not get them repaired, as the state government is responsible for their maintenance,? he added.

 The stand-off between the CMC and state government over road repairs started a few months ago, when the mayor wrote to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, making it clear that the civic body would not repair roads with tram tracks. Officials of the CTC, a subsidiary of the transport department, expressed their inability to ensure road upkeep, citing a funds crunch.

 The matter was recently referred to the high court by a public interest litigation. The CMC representatives told the court that the civic body is responsible for maintenance of all city roads excepting those with tram tracks. The case will be heard again on Thursday.

 Minister Chakraborty has admitted that it is the government?s responsibility to maintain roads having tram tracks. ?We are trying our best, but a shortage of funds is posing a problem,? he added. 

 CTC managing director S.N. Pal said at least Rs 60 crore was needed to repair six roads that were in a particularly bad state. 

 ?It is not possible for us to undertake repairs if the government doesn?t provide us with funds,?? he added.

 According to police, at least 75 accidents have occurred in the city in the past three months, in which three persons died and 40 others were injured. Over a hundred vehicles were damaged in the mishaps.

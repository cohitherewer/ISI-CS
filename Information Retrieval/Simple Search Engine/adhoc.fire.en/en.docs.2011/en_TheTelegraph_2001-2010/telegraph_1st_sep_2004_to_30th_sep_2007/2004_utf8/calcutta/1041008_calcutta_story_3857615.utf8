The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Just another love

In a flowing red skirt and matching top, the 40-something 

Rati Agnihotri (in picture left by Aranya Sen) strides on to the stage like a 

sprightly woman in her early-30s, often taking the audience by surprise as she 

breaks into Tere mere beech mein, a song that made her famous on screen, 

several summers ago.

 The audiences might have come to see the Ek Duje Ke Liye girl in Love Hua Once More ? a ?Hinglish comedy? staged as part of the four-city McDowell?s Signature Theatre Fest at GD Birla Sabhagar last Friday ? but the glamorous screen star of the Eighties seemed to be having a blast on stage.

 Vandana Sajnani?s bitter-sweet tale of heartburn and heartbreak features Rati as Sonia Singh, an attractive divorcee who ties the knot with a Bollywood script-writer. ?I started acting in films when I was all of 16. But I am enjoying stage acting very much, too. It?s very exciting. I loved doing Please Divorce Me Darling last year at GD Birla Sabhagar and the audience had received us well,? she smiled.

 Prior to Please Divorce..., Rati was content with her second innings on the big screen, starting off with Yaadein and going on to Hum Tum and Kyun? Ho Gaya Na!.

 Theatre happened largely thanks to actress Vandana Sajnani, who coaxed a reluctant Rati to try it out. From among the many scripts she was swamped with, Rati finally chose to debut with Sajnani?s English venture.

 ?But you can?t compare films with theatre. The two are very different. While on stage, you have to interact with the audience and throw your voice loud enough to reach the last row or sometimes even the gallery,? says the mother of a college-going son.

 Rati now wants to broaden her horizon and take up plays in Hindi, too, but film assigments leave her with little time for that. ?Doing a play in Hindi will be possible some time next year. Right now, I am very busy with my film commitments.? 

 Till she touches down on the stage again, there?s more of Rati coming up in Anupam Sinha?s Shukriya and Govind Menon?s Kis Kiski Kismat.

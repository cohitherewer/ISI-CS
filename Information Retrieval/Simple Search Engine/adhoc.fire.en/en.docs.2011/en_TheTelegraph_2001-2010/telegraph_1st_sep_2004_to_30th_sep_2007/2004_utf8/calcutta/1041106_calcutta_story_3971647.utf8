 Puja chanda arrest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two members of a club in Baduria, North 24-Parganas, were arrested on Friday for beating up a senior state government official and extorting Kali puja subscription from him. A complaint has been lodged with the local police outpost.

 According to police, additional district registrar Gautam Ghosh and his friend were returning home in an autorickshaw when they were intercepted by a group of eight.

 The youths asked Ghosh to pay Rs 50 as subscription. As he refused, the youths assaulted him and his friend. 

 After escaping from the gang, Ghosh informed police. Plainclothesmen later arrested two of the club members for extortion.

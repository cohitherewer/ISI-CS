The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 His full name reads Aman Yatan Verma and he insists on the Yatan bit. One of the more familiar faces on the small screen, Aman is currently in town for the Calcutta auditions of Sony?s new talent hunt show, Indian Idol.

 The actor who has also tasted success in his small cameos on the big screen likes exploring different media. ?Why should I keep myself confined to just films or just TV? If I am accepted everywhere, I see no problem in that. In fact, I am currently doing an untitled Hindi play that is to premiere in Dubai in the near future,? said the Khul jaa sim sim? man.

 But if time spent on the small screen is an honest indication, Aman is most at home on the telly. ?I enjoy playing the grey characters in Devi and Kumkum. And I love hosting shows, too. But then again, I don?t have a problem with the big screen.?

 Aman does have one film up his sleeve ? Aslam Azmi?s Paigaam with Juhi Babbar and Rajesh Khanna. And he doesn?t break into the usual hero-worship when asked about his stint with ?Kaka? on the sets. ?Let?s just say we didn?t have any problem shooting for the film.?

 And what is the difference between working with the two mega stars ? Amitabh Bachchan in Baghban and Rajesh Khanna in Paigaam? ?Zameen aasman ka farak hai ? but don?t ask me in which way,? smiled Aman. Well, we can at least make a tall guess!

Nicole Kidman: And the Tony goes to...

 The Tony Awards are to the theatre world what the Oscars are to film. Except, the Academy Award was named after a man with no real ties to the industry, while the Tony is named after a pioneer on Broadway, and a woman to boot. With Hugh ?Wolverine? Jackman leading the pack, it was a night to remember.

 Antoinette Perry or rather Toni ? she might have been beautiful but was a tough cookie ? was a theatre actress and director from Denver who had some of the biggest Broadway hits to her name. She died in 1946, and the award was instituted in her name from the following year.

 Tonight, tune into Star World to watch the star-studded affair of Tony 2004, held at Radio City Hall in New York on June 6. Hugh Jackman the host (besides being a nominee) put on a wonderful performance during the ceremony. A bevy of presenters queuing up to give away the awards included Nicole Kidman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rene Zellwegger, Ethan Hawk, Sean ?P Diddy? Combs and Patrick Stewart.

 The winners have long shared the spoils but for those not in the know, we won?t spoil the surprise. The highlights of the evening, however, were the performances. Mary J. Blige and Tony Bennett did their interpretations of Broadway classics, plus there were live shows by nominees like Alfred Molina and company?s rendition of Tradition from Fiddler on the Roof.

 This one?s worth a watch.

Rupa Ganguly: On song

Her family thinks she could have taken up music as 

a vocation, and done very well, too. But she was never too keen, restricting her 

ventures to Rituparno Ghosh?s Bariwali (where she hummed the Tagore songs 

her character often lapses into), or an Anjan Dutt telefilm (where she recorded 

a full song).

 At long last and after a lot of prodding from friends and industry folk, Rupa Ganguly is ready with her solo album, Anek Diyechho Nath, a compilation of 10 Rabindrasangeet tracks.

 ?Music has been a passion since childhood. I loved singing Rabindrasangeet and I could relate to the lyrics when I would utter them,? says Rupa, whose training in music began under Kabita Banerjee in Beltala Girls? High School decades ago.

 ?I am a perfectionist and I have sung the tracks with utmost care. But I owe this to my mother, father-in-law and Kabitadi,? she adds, having chosen barsha as the predominant flavour for the album.

 ?I was guided by the mood I was in while selecting the songs. It was raining heavily then and I picked those that I felt like humming.? Hence, the monsoon-laden numbers like Aaji jhorer rate tomar, Emono dine tare bola jay or Je raate mor duyarguli?

 Though a hectic shooting schedule left her with little time for riyaz, Rupa shut herself up at home for a fortnight before the recording to practise for a couple of hours everyday.

 Now deep into the making of Rituparno Ghosh?s Antarmahal, where she plays Jackie Shroff?s borobou, Rupa is known to have a song on her lips anytime, anyplace.

 Her debut album will be unveiled at Nandan IV this evening by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee who has often voiced his admiration for Rupa?s on-screen persona and her off-screen role in breathing life into his favourite Nandan with telefilm festivals and more.

 One perhaps can?t capture the confluence of cultures any better. Artists, musicians and gourmets from across the Padma will feature in a festival being held in Mumbai, courtesy a local Bengali channel and featuring Indian models.

 Tara Bangla is organising a Bangladeshi festival on September 26 and 27 in Mumbai.

 The festival will have fashion, traditional and modern music, contemporary art and food as its four components.

 The fashion show will have collections presented by leading Bangladeshi designers, including Bibi Russell, Lita Chowdhury, and Aneela Haque. All the models featured will be from India. 

 The gastronomical extravaganza will be organised by noted gourmet Shawkat Osman. Specialities served up will include favourites like smoked hilsa and kachchi biryani along with other traditional delicacies. 

 On the art front, selected works of 15 renowned artists will be exhibited for a week at Jehangir Art Gallery. Three out of the 15 artists will be present at the festival. Around 100 artworks will be displayed at the exhibition, most of which will be on sale.

 Contemporary Bengali music will be presented by Shakila Zafar, who performed last year in Calcutta. Rabindrasangeet will be presented by three Bangladeshi exponents of the genre, led by Rezwana Choudhury, Iffat Ara Dewan and Aditi Mohsin.

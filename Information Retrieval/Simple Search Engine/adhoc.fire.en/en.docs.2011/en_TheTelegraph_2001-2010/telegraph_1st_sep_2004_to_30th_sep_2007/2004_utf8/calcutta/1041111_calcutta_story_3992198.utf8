The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Toast of the town

The 10th Kolkata Film Festival (KFF) was inaugurated 

on Wednesday evening (picture by Aranya Sen). Seven days and so many films to 

watch. Here are some quick pointers on what to see and what to miss?

 Retro route: Who exactly is Istvan Szabo? A graduate from Hungary?s prestigious Academy of the Art of Theatre and Film, Szabo made his first feature film, The Age of Daydreaming, at 26, which is being shown at the festival. Over the next 40 years, he has made internationally acclaimed films, which have been favourites at all the major film festivals and award ceremonies, including the Oscars, Cannes, Locarno and Berlin. Unfortunately, his last film Being Julia, starring Annette Bening and Jeremy Irons, is not a part of KFF?s retrospective package.

Must watch: If you get to watch just one film 

in this fest, it has to be Goodbye Lenin by Wolfgang Becker. Exploring 

the great German divide, the film is about a son trying to recreate GDR to help 

his mother return peacefully from coma. Then there?s Lars Von Trier?s Nicole Kidman-starrer 

Dogville shot exclusively inside the studio with minimum props to allow 

maximum freedom to the actors. And if you just want to turn back time don?t miss 

Eisenstein?s Battleship Potemkin, Godard?s Breathless, Renoir?s 

The River, Antonioni?s The Night, De Sica?s The Bicycle Thieves, 

Bergman?s Wild Strawberries and Kurosawa?s Rashomon.

 Who?s here: If last year was dedicated to the German jamboree, this year belongs to the French fiesta. With the Special Screening section entirely dedicated to France, you can see quite a few French faces in the city. Director of the inaugural Chilean film Sub Terra, Marcelo Ferrari, is also in town. Noted Morrocan film-maker Saad Chraibi will be seen in the Nandan complex. So will be the striking Sri Lankan actress Damitha Abeyratne.

 Off the beaten track: If the mainstream doesn?t beckon you and being and seeing different is your style, choose between the movies of Peter Greenway and Catherine Breillat. While the Britisher challenges the very medium using every new rule in the book to fulfil his creative vision, Breillat ?explores sexuality as a subject and not an object?.

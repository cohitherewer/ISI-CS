Picture perfect prod for weight watch

Feng Shui

Pinky Kapoor

I have put on a lot of weight in the past five 

years and have been wondering if Feng Shui can help me lose some of it. I have 

tried many diets but nothing seems to help.

Name and address withheld

 Eating a balanced nutritious diet along with regular exercise is always the best way. Try putting pictures of your slimmer self on the fridge door, and on the kitchen and bedroom walls to encourage you to make the extra effort to restrict your diet. But displaying pictures where you look overweight will only make you feel guilty and miserable.

Esteem boost

I am suffering from low self-esteem as my exams 

have been going very badly. How can I improve my luck? I used to study in the 

north-east, and would sit facing west, but have shifted to a south-east room. 

What should I do?

Sana

Find out your Chinese zodiac animal sign and place 

it on the north-east side of your study table. Apart from giving you self confidence, 

it will strengthen your intuition and make you feel more powerful. When you feel 

low, look into a mirror and say positive things about your exams. You will feel 

happier and more energetic. South-east rooms are good for studying as the ruling 

wood energy helps you grow. Studying facing your sheng chi direction will 

help you concentrate.

may be good inspiration to lose weight, but take care not to overdo it, like Mary 

Kate Olson (left, in picture with twin sister Ashley) did, and end up with an 

eating disorder. (AP/PTI)

East is east

We live in a big house in a joint family. We have 

a few rooms in different directions. We are confused about the directions in which 

our rooms actually fall. They are irregular in shape. How do we make corrections 

in such rooms?

Smriti Agarwal

It is easy to find out where your rooms are located using a compass or the sun. Next, divide the house into nine equal sectors and see where each room falls. If they are irregular, block the extra area with a soft curtain or partition. If it is small, use it for storage. Rooms should not have more than four walls.

Petal power

My date of birth is 12.4.78. I would like to know 

which direction is best to put peony flowers in. Does it enhance marriage prospects? 

My animal sign is horse. How should I use this to my advantage?

Dipti Kalyani

 Peonies are believed to be powerful emblems of marital love. North-west being your personal marriage direction, this zone should be enhanced with a pair of peonies along with objects or pictures that represent couples. A similar arrangement should be placed in the south-west. Your bedroom should not have excesses of male energy. Decorate the walls with pictures of couples. According to your charts, your marriage prospects are very bright this year and next. Your personal animal sign, which is horse, can be used to your advantage after marriage, placed with your partner?s animal sign in the south-west and north-west of the bedroom.

Career counsel

I am a third-year student of B.Sc, born on 13.11.1983. 

How can I perform better in my studies? Please tell me my lucky number, lucky 

direction and lucky colours. I like computers and electronics. Can I take them 

up as a career? Currently, my study room is light yellow and it is in the south-east 

corner of the house.

Diptadip Basu

 According to your pillars of destiny, you are a strong wood person with support from the water element. Fire represents your intelligence so you will do well in computers and electronics. Your lucky number is seven and favourable directions in order of preference are as follows: north-west, south-west, north-east and west. Fire colours like red, maroon, purple, mauve; earthy colours like beige, cream, yellow and metallic shades like white, gold, and silver are best for you. Preferably your room should be either in the western or north-eastern sectors of the house.

 Students wait as varsity dithers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The fate of hundreds of BA and B.Sc Part I examinees of Calcutta University, declared unsuccessful for failing in the compulsory language papers this year, still hangs in balance.

 The students are yet to get confirmation on whether the authorities will hold a special supplementary test to enable them to clear the language papers and take the Part II examination next year.

 Responding to a demand from a section of students and college principals, the under-graduate council of the university had proposed last month a special test on the language papers.

 But the proposal was shot down by the Syndicate, the highest policy-making body of the university, following strong objections by some of the members. 

 ?Considering the students? interests, we have decided to take up the matter again at the next meeting of the Syndicate, scheduled on November 30,? said a senior university official. 

 Ranajit Basu, general secretary of the West Bengal Principals? Council, said: ?We have again requested the authorities to consider our demand. We hope they will take a positive decision at the next meeting, keeping the interests of the students in mind.?

 The pass percentage of this year?s BA and B.Sc Part I examinations, the results for which were declared in October, dropped significantly because of the large numbers of failures in the language papers. 

 Many students who had scored above 60 per cent in the honours and elective subjects, failed to secure even the pass marks in the compulsory English and Bengali papers.

 Soon after the publication of the results, principals and students urged the university to conduct a special test, clearing which the failed examinees will be able to appear in the 2005 BA and B.Sc Part II examinations.

 The principals had also submitted a memorandum to Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic), who, in turn, forwarded the matter to the under-graduate council.

 The students had argued that saddled with four honours and six elective papers of 100 marks each, they are left with hardly any time to study the language papers. 

 To further their argument, they drew a parallel with the Part II curriculum, in which they are required to study only four honours papers and another paper on environmental studies.

 According to the existing system, students are required to appear in the compulsory English and Bengali papers, each carrying 50 marks, in the BA and B.Sc Part I examination. 

 They are required to obtain at least the pass marks in the two subjects in order to qualify for the following year?s Part II examination.

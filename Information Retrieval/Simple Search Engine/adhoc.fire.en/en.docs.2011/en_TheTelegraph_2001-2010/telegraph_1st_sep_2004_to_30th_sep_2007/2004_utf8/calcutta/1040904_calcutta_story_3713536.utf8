The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gunpowder in air, fire in blood

 The Naxalbari movement drew from and spawned theatre and poetry. Samir Mukerjee recalls the turbulent times

Life in calcutta has been through various phases 

where dappled sunshine has alternated with crepuscular skies. An interplay of 

light and shade lent interesting counterpoints to the surrounding scene. The Naxalbari 

movement surfaced in the late Sixties and reached its peak in the Seventies. There 

was the smell of gunpowder in the air. There was a lot of blood-letting and savage 

violence. Those who were not on the periphery got caught up in a vicious circle 

of reprisals and counter reprisals. This was the time when inflammatory plays 

shook the Calcutta stage with all their ferocity. 

 When the establishment made a show of the mailed fist to stamp out this radical upsurge, playwrights with their instincts and consciences roused, expressed their anger in front of the footlights. Utpal Dutt was at the head of this movement with his offerings Duhshapner Nagari, Barricade, and Teer. 

 Asit Bose was a prolific playwright and his voice of protest was strongly heard in Kolkatar Hamlet and Rangtar Mukut. Souvanik produced Nazir Bichar at Muktangan and Jochhan Dastidar came up with Aajker Spartacus. An unknown group staged Hochchhe ta ki and Lash Bipani. Chetanas Marich Sangbad became a tremendous draw in those days. Dwijen Banerjees powerful production Amitakshar made us take a closer look at life and gave us a lot to mull over. 

 These plays dealt with repression, the colossal hypocrisy and callousness of the government, the obstacle race that daily life had been reduced to and the fight put up by the victims of oppression and fraud. When a parliamentary democracy fails to respond to the needs of the people it leaves itself wide open to satire. 

 Art is a research into life. Life is contained in society; societies are governed by political institutions. This makes a political choice imperative for thinking individuals and thats where the playwrights came in with important truths to communicate. 

 Amidst all this ferment, the magazine Frontier became a mouthpiece for the radical dissenters. Academics and intellectuals of all shades were drawn to this magazine where they also contributed their thoughts. The editor, Samar Sen, an uncompromising and honest-to-god journalist, saw to it that its vigour and capacity to rip apart a diseased society remained undiminished. 

 Little magazines proliferated at this time which reflected conflicts of a society in transition. During the Emergency, the magazine Kolkata was banned for containing seditious material. Intelligent boys and girls read Anustup with great devotion. Aneek and Lal Tara were also on the stands and had strong political overtones. Being an inveterate theatre-goer and meeting an assortment of actors, actresses and young aspiring writers, I happened to come across some of these leftist magazines which dented my complacence. It would be impossible to put on an air of indifference and plough a lonely furrow when all the warts and moles of a highly stratified society were being displayed with ruthless honesty.

 With so much anger stored up in dusty hearts one felt the vibrations of a movement which became very vocal as it continued to gain momentum. One heard slogans like Naxalbarir lal aguney shodhon badke puriye maro. Young boys and girls, from colleges and universities, entertained the feeling that something was brewing and a certain boldness had crept into the utterances of the votaries of the Hard Left. The days for seeking blessings from an invisible god were meant to be over. The Naxalites believed in direct action and turned their backs on those values which made people fatalistic and effete.

 In lots of offices, young clerks talked on these lines and behaved as if they could smell some battle from afar. Upper middle class parents could not restrain their progeny from gravitating towards this movement. Even if their enthusiasm was temporary, these youngsters felt the need to redefine their stand on life and politics. Maos Red Book made its appearance and it was carried by some people in their packets as if it had some potent message of political salvation and had to be carefully guarded. 

 Utpalendu Chakravarty flitted in and out of our drawing room with his incisive comments on political chicanery. Apart from his films Mukti Chai, Chokh and Moyna Tadanta he wrote short stories as well, hammering away on the theme of economic inequalities and injustice. 

 Sometime in the turbulent Seventies, when one could hear the drumbeats inside ones blood stream, we chanced upon Girin Chakravarty who was a theoretician in the CPI-ML and a primary school teacher to boot. From him we heard the names of Shushital Roy Chowdhury and Saroj Dutta who were firebrands and part of the think-tank of the Hard Left. Saroj Duttas journalistic enterprises were well-known and his murder by agents of the establishment created ripples that didnt die out easily. 

 During the Seventies, one heard the name of David Selbourne bandied about in discerning circles. He had visited China and written a book on it. He came to Calcutta when the political effervescence was still simmering. His arrival here and meetings with film directors and leftist intellectuals were almost an endorsement of the fervour that was sweeping through the Bengali middle classes. 

 Norman Bethunes books also received public acclaim and his fighting spirit boosted the morale of the young hopefuls of the day. Edgar Snow, Neville Maxwell and Hemango Biswas satisfied our curiosity about China, her culture and stormy politics. Their message had a profound significance just when a tempest was brewing. 

 The Naxalite movement spawned revolutionary poetry. With a mixture of sarcasm, terse utterances and aggressive stances, poetry became a formidable weapon to rouse dormant instincts and blow away cobwebs. Monibhushan Bhattacharya brought out his Gandhinagare Ratri where a society in agony was held up to us pitilessly. When truth was one of the casualties, it became important to make the protest strident and unadulterated. Poets like Samir Ray, Sanat Dasgupta, Birendra Chattopadhyay and Sagar Chakravarty brought a different kind of tone and flavour to poetry. 

 They made no concessions to sentimentality. Their poetry spoke for the poor and for all those who spent their lives in a meaningless repetitive ritual of drudgery. Shankars Book Stall at the junction of Rashbehari Avenue and Gariahat Road used to store just the sort of books and magazines we needed to shake up our consciences. 

 The ultra-Left movement was finally hijacked by unsavoury elements who had a shop-soiled agenda of their own. In the initial period, however, this movement was looked upon as the last gasp of romantic idealism, the last attempt to shun self-absorption and espouse social causes. 

 I would like to sum up the feelings of the young who gave their golden years to the propagation of a new faith, in the words of the Austrian poet Erich Fried: 

Because his spine is twisted

Because he is past shouting

Because he stinks

Because he is too weak

To go on living

The system 

That is to blame 

Shall also not go on living.

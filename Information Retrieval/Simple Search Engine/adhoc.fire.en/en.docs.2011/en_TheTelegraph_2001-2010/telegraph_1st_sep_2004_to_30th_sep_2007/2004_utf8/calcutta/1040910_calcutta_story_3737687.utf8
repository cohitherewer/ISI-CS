The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Politics is in fashion, young and suave

Kiran's Call

The Indian image of today is comfortably 

global yet very local, feels designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh

If wishes were horses, what would our politicians 

ride? It?s a matter of personal style and image, but play this one out in your 

mind. Seat one neta on some fancy flier like Dream Girl. Then, there would 

be thoroughbreds, Shetland ponies, draught horses and so on. And finally, the 

young colts walking off with half the stables at the last elections. Some, citing 

animals rights, may refuse to ride and others, to drive home horse sense and horsepower, 

opt to carry the animal. Enough variety for some brisk horse-trading. And Omar 

Abdullah? He?d have been, I read somewhere, a Formula One driver if he hadn?t 

been a politician. 

What you choose to ride, then, is all about your style. 

And style is one thing fashion is about.Today, it?s about having the courage to 

dance to your own tune. What strikes me is, there?s pride in our generation in 

our Indian image, it?s comfortably global yet very much local. 

I love being Indian. I grew up believing nothing beats 

the Alps. Today, I would as much take my kids to see the beauty of Darjeeling 

as I would take them to Disney Land, or down the ?chooriwali galli? in 

Hyderabad just as our parents would take us to gape at the Hague. 

We?ve outgrown the awe of the West. As a nation, we?ve 

always been known for our pride or ?izzat?, but as a country, we were idling 

somewhere close to the bottom rung in many spheres. Apart from the Olympics, where 

we turned ourselves into a nation of also-rans, we?ve got our art selling at Christie?s 

and our cosmetics, at Body Shop. 

Whether it?s experimenting with noodle straps with 

the sari, ?churi? pants, tripping over kurtis in every lane in Rome, 

the McTikka Burger or the Safari suit that?s probably worn more in India than 

anywhere else.We?re ready to imbibe the best from the west but we take it on our 

own terms. 

What?s more, let?s not forget that Madonna?s toned 

body is a testament to the power of Yoga over aerobics, Stella Mcartney and Galliano 

owe a huge debt to India for inspiration and brocade and the paisley have set 

international runways on fire. I believe we?ve shed the excess baggage of our 

earlier generations. 

This thought came home to me as I came across a report 

in The Telegraph on seven young politicians from both sides of the Central 

Hall aisle going to the US to build new bridges. Our young political fraternity, 

like fashion, isn?t about anything new, it?s interpreting tradition afresh. These 

chic young politicians are carrying on the tradition of their politico fathers 

with a spirit all their own. This is politics? fashion moment. 

One man who precursed it all was recently in Calcutta. 

Years ago, Omar was already where today?s young politician now follows. Like him, 

the Scindias and the Pilots are comfortable with their Indianness, and don?t have 

to wear khadi to prove it. It?s odd to think of clothing as a prop. Clothing 

is almost always its own reward. Clothes tell a story about what you want to portray 

yourself as. Like him, this young breed needn?t play kabadi to prove their 

patriotism. They?re comfortable knocking around on squash courts or as President 

of the River Runners Association. Our young politicians are comfortable with a 

unique international Indian image. 

The Abdullah visit to Calcutta was a private holiday, 

and Omar was here with his wife Payal to show their sons the charm of Calcutta. 

Over an amazing kela-patta lunch of Appams and Stew, Malabari Prawns and 

mango pickle at Tamarind, I realised, this Essex-born man is invaluable to India. 

He is a liberal Kashmiri Muslim, with an English mother, who is unequivocally 

Indian. From Mumbai?s Sydenham College to Scotland?s University of Strathclyde, 

his stint in corporate marketing with ITC in Singapore and Calcutta, briefly, 

before his first Lok Sabha dekko, he has emerged an erudite, thinking man who 

doesn?t need to shout to get into the limelight. 

His take on Parliament was refreshing. If you wonder 

what film stars do there, Omar assures you they bring in an invigorating perspective. 

He was taken aback when Garam Dharam, whom he grew up watching in Sholay, 

came up to hug him in Parliament with an, ?I?m proud of you, young man?. 

I believe there is no better time than today to be 

an Indian. We are India?s brand ambassadors. As global locals, it?s a young and 

stylish India the world is contending with. Personally, I love it ...

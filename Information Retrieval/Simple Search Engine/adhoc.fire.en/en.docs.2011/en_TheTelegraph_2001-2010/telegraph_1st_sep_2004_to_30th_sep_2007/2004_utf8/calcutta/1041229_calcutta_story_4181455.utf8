The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Of late, a number of television channels are telecasting serials based on real-life 

incidents of crime. They generally reconstruct the incidents to clearly depict 

the modus operandi of the criminals. But sometimes the reconstruction is so gory 

that viewers are horrified. While the serials are shown late at night, the repeats 

and trailers of these serials are beamed throughout the day and hence even children 

come across them. Will the channels take responsibility if the kids try to imitate 

the incidents and risk their and others? lives? We have already seen how some 

children lost their lives in a bid to imitate the hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee.

 On October 30, my wife?s handbag was picked at the Kalighat temple. She immediately 

lodged a complaint with the police since the bag contained her voter?s ID, our 

daughter?s school identity card and other valuables. However, on December 4 we 

found an envelope in our letterbox with the ID cards enclosed. It bore the stamp 

of the Botanical Garden sub-post office. We thank all those who returned the cards 

to us. Such nice gestures are rare these days.

 There are several automatic weighing machines at Sealdah railway station. I 

checked my weight thrice on a particular machine and it was different each time. 

Surprisingly, none could get my weight right either. Is there any authority that 

checks the machines once in a while to verify whether or not they are functioning 

properly?

 Savings account holders at many post offices are not getting withdrawal slips 

since long. Senior citizens are facing a tough time withdrawing money as a part 

of their monthly income schemes. Frequently, postage stamps of commonly-used denominations, 

revenue stamps and even inland letters, envelopes and post cards are not available 

in many post offices. Application forms for Kishan Vikash Patra and National Savings 

Certificate are always in short supply as well. Telegram facilities have also 

been restricted to very few post offices. Authorities should take steps to solve 

the problem. 

 Jyoti Baksi, Heysham Row. 

 The front portion of Metcalfe Hall on Strand Road is extremely dirty. The entrance 

to its left is an open-air garbage dump. It is disgusting that a heritage building 

is neglected by the civic body in this manner. 

 Chandan Ray, Sakuntala Park.

Music, mime amp; bonds of brotherhood

 That music transcends barriers will be aptly showcased next week in a 20-minute orchestra piece, in which melody-makers from Japan, Ireland and India will play together at the eighth International Festival of Non-Verbal Arts (IFNA).

 The musical medley at Rabindra Sadan will unfold with nonagenarian V. Balsara at the helm. No, the legendary pianist and composer hasn?t had to traverse continents to come up with the two 10-minute sets where foreign musicians will share the stage with their Indian counterparts. Balsara has composed the pieces right here in his humble Bowbazar house. ?We musicians can coordinate mentally. Physical presence is not always necessary,? Balsara smiles mysteriously.

 He does reveal using some standard stock music and sending the composed notation sheets to musicians to study and practise. The musicians will only rehearse together twice or thrice prior to the show. 

 ?Music is universal, it has no language, it?s like pantomime,? Balsara sums up the mood of the festival. 

 A brainchild of mime artiste Ashok Chatterjee, the IFNA will be held in Calcutta from December 7 to 9 at Rabindra Sadan, Girish Mancha and the Tata Consultancy Services auditorium in Salt Lake, respectively, after a performance in Suri on December 5. Highlights of the festival include gesture theatre by actors from England, programmes by Japanese musicians, mime from Sweden and clown mime by Koreans.

 ?Our idea is to push the boundaries of mime as traditionally understood in India and create new audiences for the dynamic art form, which overlaps with other modes of acting today,? said Chatterjee, while unveiling the festival plans on Wednesday.

 Swedish clown mime artiste Jay Baker Ericson will be portraying the story of a child exploring life with the help of simple props like a chair. ?We are like a real family of performers here,? smiled Ericson, and extended an invitation to IFNA to travel to Sweden next year. 

 While the foreign components will stay the same on all days, the schedule in the Indian section will vary with Balsara?s composition on December 7, and upcoming musician Anirban Chatterjee?s sitar solo on December 8 and 9, apart from a dance performance by Kashmira Samanta on AIDS on December 8.

 Back at his Bowbazar home, Balsara revealed the instrumental pieces would be folk in nature with instruments typical to the countries being represented. The Indian section will feature renditions of Sare jahan se achcha and Jai Jagadish Hare, among other pieces, on sitar, sarod, flute, tabla and a host of other instruments. 

 There will be three distinct sounds, played one at a time, but in a way that each will blend with the other seamlessly. ?It will be like world integration,? quips Balsara, who will probably play a piano or an accordion at the show.

 A celebration of childhood

 The pressures of living up to the expectations of parents have robbed children of their right to enjoy a happy, carefree childhood. So any effort made to help youngsters rediscover the children in themselves deserves praise. Particularly commendable in this respect is the role of Childrens Little Theatre (CLT). For over 50 years, CLT has nurtured the lives of children with care, complementing their education with group activities like music, dance and dramatics that children delight in, and at the same time helping to nourish critical mental faculties essential to their personality development. CLT hosts its annual festival this year featuring dances, ballets and recitations by its students. To be inaugurated this evening, the six-day event is a magnificent celebration of childhood. The sheer joy of self-expression through rhythm and an innocence shining through their every word and movement will surely endear the young performers to the audience.

 Event: Annual Festival of Children?s Little Theatre

 When: December 24 - 29, 6 pm

 Where: Aban Mahal, Dhakuria Bridge approach

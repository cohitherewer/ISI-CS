 Tease traps in township

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Alarmed at the spurt in eve-teasing cases in Salt Lake, police are undertaking stringent measures to ensure that women can move around freely without fear of being harassed.

 ?A security ring for women will be thrown around the township. Policemen in plainclothes and in uniform will be patrolling the roads. We will also engage women personnel to tackle the situation,? elaborated a senior police officer of Salt Lake. 

 ?We are strengthening vigil in the parks and other public places,? said Parveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 The move comes after Sunday?s incident in which two middle-aged men in a Qualis made lewd comments at a woman and tried to drag her into the vehicle. ?The woman was on her way back after attending Jagaddhatri puja celebrations in FD block. She was followed as soon as she came out of a house,? said an officer of the Salt Lake police.

 As the two men, Pradip Baidya and Kamal Ancharia, tried to drag her into the car, she ran back into the building. When the woman tried to go home later, she saw the Qualis still waiting.

 This forced her to seek the host?s help. ?The businessman chased the duo in his car. After a 15-minute drive, he succeeded in overtaking and stopping them, when they were forced to slow down on a potholed road. We were informed and the culprits were handed over,? said the officer.

 After the news spread among local residents, women ? from housewives to college students ? came forward to seek protection from police. 

 ?We are selecting a batch of women police personnel to net eve-teasers. They will set up traps, roaming in casual clothes. Senior officers will also be around. This way, harassers can be caught red-handed,? said an official.

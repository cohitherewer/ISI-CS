 Critical equipment fighting fit

Saibal Chakrabarty: Is it true that the equipment recently acquired by the fire brigade for use in critical operations, like tall sequential folding ladders, do not function properly most of the time?

 That is not true. Except during the Puja days, our water tanks are kept in readiness to reinforce the capacity of the fire tenders that are sent to put out fires. Generally eight large tankers, each containing 18,000 litre of water, are kept ready round-the-clock in select fire stations of the city to tackle major fires. 

 Moreover, we also keep 12 water-carriers in different fire stations to build a water-supply chain. We had imported some super-speciality apparatus like folding stairs that can be used in very confined spaces. It is possible that these instruments may fail to work during a particular operation, but till date, that has never happened. The instruments have been successfully used in several operations.

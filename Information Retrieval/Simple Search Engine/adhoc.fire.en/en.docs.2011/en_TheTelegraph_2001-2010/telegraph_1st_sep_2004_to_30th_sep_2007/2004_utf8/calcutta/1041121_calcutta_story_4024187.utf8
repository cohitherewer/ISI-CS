The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Cricket, cash and comfort 

For Rs 1,500, the Calcutta consumer wants a lot more 

than just a few inches at the Eden

Shiloo Chattopadhyay

This 

was a couple of days before Diwali. Farukh was on the line from Dhaka. He wanted 

to come to Calcutta on the 13th to watch the cricket match. My immediate reaction 

was actually a hangover from the past. ?Today is Tuesday. The city is Calcutta. 

It?s a day-night match being played on a Saturday, so no CL will be wasted. India 

is playing Pakistan. And you want me to organise three tickets? You must be joking, 

Farukh.? I told Farukh to come to Calcutta and enjoy the match on TV in my house.

Farukh is a close friend. I had to make the best effort 

for the tickets, however unlikely the prospect may have seemed. Bishoo, my trusted 

lieutenant from office, was sent. He came back within a few hours with three tickets 

of Rs 1,500 each. Not out, no contact, no premium. He stood in queue and bought 

it from the counter. I called Dhaka and gave the good news and added, just to 

save my face, how very difficult it had been to organise the tickets.

Farukh arrived on the morning of the match and met 

me at my office. He was wearing a mischievous smile. He opened the sports page 

of the Ananda Bazar Patrika lying on my desk and showed me a small news 

item: CAB will be selling a small number of tickets of Rs 1,500 denomination that 

morning from the Mohammedan Sporting ground.

While I was watching the match later in the afternoon, 

I realised that the number of tickets on sale that morning was not few. Indeed, 

I also figured that not many people went to buy them. Most other stands were however 

filled to the brim. Life, associate and annual members of CAB or their proxies 

were there in large numbers. Free tickets are not shunned as yet. Priced tickets 

of lower denominations also got sold.

What was wrong with the Rs 1,500 tickets? Were they 

overpriced? The argument that there aren?t enough people in Calcutta who can spend 

Rs 1,500 for a cricket match is hardly plausible. Overpricing in this case possibly 

connotes lack of adequate value. What Mr Dalmiya was offering on the 13th at Eden 

Gardens for Rs 1,500 may not have been a good enough buy. And this does not include 

the result of the match. Thanks to expert commentators and multiple cameras, television 

delivers the cricket of the match ? the physical product ? far better.

More importantly, it comes at no cost to you, packaged 

in the comfort of your home. The missing element, some say, is the atmosphere 

of the ground. You know what we are talking about. You are watching Laxman drive 

Shoaib through the covers. Suddenly you find the sun too strong, you lean and 

turn the fan meant for your seat ever so slightly. You feel like partaking the 

pleasure of a leisurely sip from a steaming mug of coffee or from a tall glass 

of coke with lots of ice. Raise your finger and it will be brought to you by the 

uniformed waiter in attendance for your row of seats. If you have missed the run 

out, catch it on the giant screen replay. If you are tired, go to the AC toilet 

to freshen up. Come back and you can incline your seat at an angle that gives 

your back that much-needed support. If you are hungry, walk a few paces down to 

the caf? serving hot food.

Unfortunately, you will miss all these today at the 

Eden Gardens as well. For Rs 1,500, the consumer expects a whole lot more than 

the inches that are on offer now. The empty seats were pregnant with a message. 

The consumer of Calcutta has spoken. CAB beware.

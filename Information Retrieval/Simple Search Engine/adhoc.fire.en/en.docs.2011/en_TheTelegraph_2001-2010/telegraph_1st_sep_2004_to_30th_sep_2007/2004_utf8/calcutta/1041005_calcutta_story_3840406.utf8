The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Homoeo route to cancer relief

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta and faraway Bethesda, in the American state of Maryland, seem to be at a critical crossroad of making popular the homoeopathy way to curing lung cancer. 

 If all goes well, the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will play a pivotal role in a first-of-its-kind research project, to be funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the USA. The project will involve keeping a close observation on the lung cancer patients undergoing treatment at the Prasanta Banerjee Homoeopathic Research Foundation, on Elgin Road, documenting their progress and sending the results to the US regularly.

 Dr Jeffrey D. White of the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine, NCI, told Metro: ?If the project is successful, you might just have lung cancer patients at AIIMS being treated with homoeopathic medicine in a few years from now.?

 Drs White and Banerjee will be meeting doctors at AIIMS later this week. Dr Prasanta Banerjee said: ?While we treat lung cancer patients at our clinic with homoeopathy, AIIMS will act as Dr White?s extended monitor here in India. We will also have another NCI representative based at our clinic for the liaison between the project here and Dr White.?

 After reaching a formal agreement with AIIMS and a subsequent approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research, 40 new lung cancer patients will be inducted into the project, six months from now. 

 ?They will be merely observed by us, and regular documentation of their progress will be sent to us, while they undergo exclusive homoeopathic treatment at the foundation,? added Dr White. 

 The ball had been set rolling back in the mid-90s in Greece, when the father-son (Pratip) doctor duo had impressed oncologists with homoeopathic cancer treatment, as opposed to painful chemotherapy. 

 ?The Banerjees? method is the first alternative method we find credible,? said Dr White. ?Back in the US, we are looking at a few more alternative methods, such as following the macrobiotic diet, high on seaweeds and sea vegetables, to fight cancer.?

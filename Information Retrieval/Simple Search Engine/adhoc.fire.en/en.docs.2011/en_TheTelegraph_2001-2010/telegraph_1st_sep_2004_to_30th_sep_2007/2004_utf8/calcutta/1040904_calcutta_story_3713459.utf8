The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Speed thrill on wheels, for trade and ties

Storm car rally (AFP) 

 About 60 cars, cruising through Southeast Asia, on a mission of peace, cooperation and friendship. That is a freeze frame of the first India-ASEAN Car Rally, and what it aims to accomplish. The plan is to flag off the rally from Guwahati in November, and end in Thailand.

 For about three weeks, each car, with a driver and a navigator, will travel through Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia and Singapore, on the route mapped out so far. Three cars from each country are allowed, and all the vehicles will be Indian makes. Since this is the first year although the plan is to make it an annual feature it is a non-competitive event.

 Organised by the ministry of external affairs and the Confederation of Indian Industry, the rally aims to explore long-term ties and commercial opportunities among the participating countries, from infrastructure to tourism. To that end, there will be a series of business seminars and cultural activities in each of these countries. 

 An interesting aspect of the rally will be from the technological standpoint, courtesyAustralia-based IT logistical security company SpartaMatrix, which recently set up its India office in Calcutta. Although specialising in supply chain security, particularly in the maritime sector, its security and tracking systems will be used during the trip.

 Three cars, including one providing direct interaction with the rally master and driven by Chuck Ho, a Hong Kong policeman and stuntman for Jackie Chan, and 17 technicians, are part of the package. Emergency response system, satellite tracking devices to keep a check on the cars and cameras will part of the service. The technology, software and hardware, is developed using space technology.

 SpartaMatrix, however, is using the rally as a showcasing opportunity for its technology, says chairman Philip H. Wainwright. The main purpose is to work with the private shipping companies in India, and the Calcutta Port Trust, to make the industry tech-savvy, IT-updated and safe. Modernisation of transport security is how Wainwright puts it. In future, the call centres and manufacturing facilities in Calcutta will also be utilised by SpartaMatrix, he adds.

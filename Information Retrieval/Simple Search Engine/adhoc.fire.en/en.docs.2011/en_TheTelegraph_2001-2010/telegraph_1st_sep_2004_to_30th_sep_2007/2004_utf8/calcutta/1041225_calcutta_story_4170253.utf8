 Yuletide cheer

 From Bow Barracks to Park Street ? the city geared up for a rocking Christmas Eve, and the party has just begun! The festive weekend got off to a rollicking start with most nightclubs registering unprecedented footfalls even as traditional Anglo-Indian bastion Bow Barracks celebrates its own brand of Yuletide cheer.

 The mood at Tantra, celebrating its fifth anniversary on December 24, is exotic, while chill-out zones like Shisha are providing the bridge between non-stop partying and family gatherings.

 ?Christmas Eve being the birthday of Tantra is the biggest night of the year and we have already registered over a 1,000 entries today,? said Anirban Simlai, director F amp;B Park, before 6 pm on Friday. Exotic imports like European dancers and an American lady DJ define the Christmas line-up at this hotspot.

 In sharp contrast, community feeling is the flavour of the colourful four-day-long carnival at Bow Barracks, home to an interesting mish-mash of Anglo-Indians, Chinese, Muslim and some Bengali families. Singers Usha Uthup, Shayne Hyrapiet and residents heralded the Christmas fun with evergreen numbers like Que sera sera, Lonesome tonight, I just called to say and The final countdown on December 23.

 Homemade wine and cookies, and hawkers selling piping hot momos and meatball soups add to the festive mood amid colourful Christmas d?cor and confetti shower. ?This is just to let everybody know ours is a very vibrant community,? smiled a spokesperson for Bow United Organisation. 

 Those who want to break away from the family fun, yet take it easy, have an option in Shisha bar, which is offering a hookah festival and a Lebanese Christmas treat to Calcuttans. ?We have kept it low key as we don?t want to attract the wrong kind of crowd,? said DJ Girish of Shisha. The party here starts early for folks who like to warm up a little before hitting more thumping pastures. ?We got a lot of queries from college kids and are starting as early as 7.30 pm,? added Girish, who is banking on mellow carols like Welcome Christmas and So it is Christmas by John Lennon, instead of the usual lounge music.

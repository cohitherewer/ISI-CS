 Art?s triumph over life

 Beauty is that intrinsic virtue of art which empowers it to overcome the ravages of time. The artists brush captures forever and colours with his imagination the beauty in life and the universe, allowing his art to transcend the truth of death, decay and destruction. Though the original which inspires a work of art inevitably perishes, its replica, as frozen on canvas, continues to shine with the same beauty and radiance it possessed earlier. This eternal paradox that exists between the worlds of art and reality is marvellously explored in the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Krishna Dey and Arpita Khaskel (one of her paintings appears above). Drawing upon themes from literature, personal experience and daily life, the works on show display a surprising blend of tradition and modernity, as if to emphasise the timelessness of art as opposed to the temporal nature of life. Dey?s works, mirroring the ruin and decadence of places that once enjoyed a position of proud eminence, mourn for a past that is no more. Khaskel?s paintings, on the other hand, reflect the artist?s concern about fragility and vulnerability of all that is beautiful and innocent in this world.

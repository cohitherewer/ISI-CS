 City cops net Jharkhand?s wanted

 - 24 cases of abduction, extortion against M.Com with political links

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dhananjoy Pradhan is young and smart, and walks with a swagger. A master?s degree-holder in commerce from Ranchi University, he has been involved in the racket of kidnapping and extortion since age 19. Pradhan is the undisputed don of Jharkhand?s underworld, with strong contacts in political circles. 

 A self-styled hero in the dreaded underworld of Bihar and Jharkhand, Pradhan was arrested on Wednesday in Calcutta. Among other things, police have found several phone numbers of Bihar-based MLAs in Pradhan?s mobile phone. ?His annual turnover from extortion and kidnapping runs into a few crores. Between Bihar and Jharkhand, the police have been on the look-out for him in at least two dozen cases,? said Rajiv Kumar, deputy commissioner (central).

 Police claim that on several occasions, Pradhan had collected his ransom in Calcutta after kidnapping someone either in Jharkhand or Bihar. Investigations reveal that at least on six occasions in the past, Pradhan had come down to the city to collect his ransom. On several other occasions, his men did the job for him. 

 Born in Ranchi, this son of a grocer used to run his fiefdom with about 50-odd men, who operated across Bihar and Jharkhand. Pradhan confessed that he had been involved in the racket since his college days when he, as part of a gang, would make money by threatening local businessmen. 

 Police claim that on September 27, Pradhan reached the city and put up at Ashoka Hotel, in Howrah, booking his room in the name of Rakesh Singh. A few days ago, fearing a police raid, he shifted to Meghdoot Hotel. Throughout the day, he would move around the city and return late at night to evade police. On Tuesday, he checked out when a team of sleuths came looking for him. A chase later, he was finally rounded up from a spot in Bowbazar. 

 Pradhan played a key role in the sale of scrap metal by the railways in Jharkhand. ?He would either lend support to those buying a tender or kidnap those seeking to place their tender. Anyone trying to do business would have to pay him hush money or incur his wrath,? explained one of the officers involved in Pradhan?s arrest.

 In a separate development, Burrabazar police arrested two men, Sardez Khan and Mozammel Khan, at the intersection of Brabourne Road and Jackson Road. Residents of Darbhanga, in Bihar, the duo would operate with the help of an informer, Beku, of Samsul Huda Road, in the Karaya police station area, for a string of crimes, including dacoities, in and around central Calcutta.

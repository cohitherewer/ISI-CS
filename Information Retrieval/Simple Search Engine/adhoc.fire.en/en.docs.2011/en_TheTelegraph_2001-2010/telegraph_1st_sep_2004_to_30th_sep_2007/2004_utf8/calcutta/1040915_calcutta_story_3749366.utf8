 Honouring souls divine

Since the dawn of civilization, mankind has been perplexed with the mysteries of the universe and the human role in the cosmic scheme. In India, perhaps, more than in any other country in the world, we have been blessed with saints, philosophers and prophets who have sought spiritual enlightenment on the cycle of life; a relentless cycle that keeps our race surging ahead. In celebration of this glorious quest to understand and conquer the infinite, Chitrakoot Art Gallery hosts The Seekers, an exhibition of paintings, photographs and sculpture that seeks to pay tribute to the complete dedication and unwavering resolve of these great souls. Featuring works by eminent artists such as Nicholas Roerich, Chintamoni Kar, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Akhitam Narayanan and Sanatan Dinda, among others, the exhibition highlights, through its collection of works in various forms and media, how the search for spiritual meaning raises human life on a plane that is celestial and sublime. Curation: Ratnottama Sengupta and Prabhas Kejriwal.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings, photographs and sculpture

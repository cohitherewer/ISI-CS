 Six months is a long time standing at the end of the waiting line. Debipakkha and Shudhu Tumi, the two family dramas ready for release since May, will finally see the light of day this Pujas.

 Though the producers of both films are counting their losses for the delay, the deferred release date might actually end up working to their advantage.

 With Durga Puja as its backdrop, Raja Sen?s Debipakkha couldn?t have had a more appropriate release than on October 8, five days before Mahalaya.

 If Rituparna Sengupta is the biggest draw for Debipakkha, Sudeshna Roy-Abhijit Guha?s debut directorial venture Shudhu Tumi is turning out to be the only Prosenjit-starrer to hit the halls (on October 15) this festive season.

 Reshmi Sengupta raises the curtains on the two pre-Puja releases that also have one common cast factor, rising star Koel.

Debipakkha

 Cast: Soumitra Chatterjee, Sandhya Roy, Rituparna Sengupta, Satabdi Roy, Koel Mullick, Kaushik Sen

 Directed by: Raja Sen

 Releasing at: Minar, Bijoli, Chhabighar (October 8)

 Storyline: The simple world of a small-town priest comes crumbling down when one of his three daughters (Rituparna) is raped by a local promoter (Biplab Chatterjee). Fearing a social backlash, the priest and his wife (Soumitra and Sandhya) pack her off to Mumbai. But more woes are in store: eldest daughter Satabdi comes back home widowed and villainous Biplab has his eyes set on the soon-to-be-married youngest daughter Koel.

 Starting with Mahalaya, the drama builds up over the five festive days when Rituparna returns to her father?s house after six long years. She?s now a wealthy woman on a vendetta trail. The flashbacks in between relive a sordid tale of exploitation and a woman?s struggle to survive and then avenge the wrongs done to her family.

Director voice: ?I have tried to portray the 

pressures on a middle-class family when it goes through a crisis. At the centre 

is a woman who finds the courage to put her tormentor behind bars,? says Raja 

Sen, who authored the script with help from Indrasish Lahiri and Sunetra Ghatak.

Starspeak: ?It?s a very sensitive film and 

working with actresses like Sandhya Roy, Rituparna Sengupta and Satabdi Roy was 

a great learning experience,? says Koel.

Shudhu Tumi

 Cast: Prosenjit, Koel Mullick, Gargi Roychowdhury

 Directed by: Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha

 Releasing at: Darpana, Prachi, Bharati (October 15)

 Storyline: The Chowdhurys are your friendly next-door neighbours, but stern disciplinarian Prosenjit spoils all the fun. The stony fa?ade starts wearing off once bubbly Koel crosses his path, but not before the routine face-off. But what Koel discovers, having fallen in love, is the presence of another woman, Gargi.

 Here?s a tough love triangle, with the fresh and charming Koel pitted against the mature and mysterious Gargi. Instead of wondering who the left-out girl is, watch out for some refreshing outdoors ? Koel cycling down the hilly terrains of Arunachal Pradesh or Prosenjit-Gargi cavorting around the snow-capped peaks. But do we hear The Sound of Music somewhere there?

 Director voice: ?We have made a commercial film and tried to retain the charm of old Bengali films. The characters are based on real-life people, revolving around family values, love and relationships. And melody is one of its strongest points,? says Sudeshna Roy.

 Starspeak: ?Shooting for this film was great fun and I was very excited. Everybody in the crew helped me so much during the shoot,? adds Koel.

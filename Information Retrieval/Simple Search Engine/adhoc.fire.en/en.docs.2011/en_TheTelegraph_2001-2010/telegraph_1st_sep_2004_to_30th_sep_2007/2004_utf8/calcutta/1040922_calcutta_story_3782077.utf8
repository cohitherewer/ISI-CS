The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fashion, fizz and light bite to fly high

Members 

of Calcutta Club were treated to an exciting evening of fashion, food and thumping 

music recently. Titled ?Come September Eve Ball?, the show packed in some ramp 

rage with city models sashaying to Goan DJ Moses Aron?s up-tempo beats. 

 The sequence choreographed by Prithviraj Ghosh saw models Nicola, Rusha, Priyanka and others sport outfits from boutiques such as Meadows and Aaradhika. 

 The evening drew to a close with a contemporary dance performance by a troupe called Broadways.

 Victorian vibe

 A young couple from Jaipur, Siddhartha and Vanya Lodha, showcased an exhibition of Victorian, coloured stone, diamond and kundan jewellery at Genesis Art Gallery last weekend. What started off as a high-risk venture that hung heavily on chance, is today a lucrative business with export orders from London and Dubai. Priced between Rs 5,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh, 10 pieces were already sold at the exhibition within the first few hours of its opening. 

 The handcrafted jewellery can be divided into two distinct styles ? one with 18-carat gold as the base and the designs delicately strewn with diamonds and coloured gems, and the other a distinctly old-British taste of a silver base with colourful semi-precious stones set on it. 

 The Victorian pieces, according to Siddhartha Lodha, ?are far more dressy and can be worn for weddings and other formal occasions. The ones with the gold base, on the other hand, are more casual.? 

 The jewels command universal appeal with a combination of traditional and modern elements.

 Coffee amp; kite

 As the skies finally clear, Caffeine on Elgin Road is just in time to indulge in a little kite craze. The coffee shop got into the mood with a kite festival, Let?s Fly. It?s even better when the high-altitude fun is translated into a colourful ambience with kites of almost every shade and size. The ground reality in the shape of kite sandwiches being served till September end is too hard to resist.

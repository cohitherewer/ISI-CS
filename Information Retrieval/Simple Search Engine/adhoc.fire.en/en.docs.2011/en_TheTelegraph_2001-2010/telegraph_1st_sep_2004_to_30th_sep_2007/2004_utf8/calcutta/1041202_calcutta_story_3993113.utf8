Mr India in the mid-80s took the nation by 

storm with Anil Kapoor doing the disappearing act at (watch) will. Then, Grasim 

stepped in and Mr India happened for real. Only this time, it was a beauty pageant, 

just for men. Bikram Saluja bagged the coveted crown in 1994, inspiring many a 

young man to follow suit.

 It?s selection time again and the hunt is on for 32 able and eligible contestants who will strut their stuff on stage on January 29 in Mumbai. But before the final countdown, the highway to fame and fortune is a bumpy one. Walking the walk and talking the talk are not skills learnt overnight. 

 Brushing up on their talents were 40 young men between 18 and 28 years, at The HHI on Wednesday, for the selections. Some were city slickers, others had travelled from afar ? Patna, Guwahati and Durgapur ? but they all had a twinkle in their eye and a spring in their step.

 ?I have been wanting to participate for a long time. I decided to give the pageant a shot this year. So I left my business and came to Calcutta,? announced Manish Kassliwal, who had booked a berth from Guwahati.

 As for contestant qualifications, it?s not as tough as you might think. ?We are not looking for an Arnold Schwarzenegger or an Albert Einstein. The participants need to fulfil some basic criteria. They have to be between 18 and 28 years and they should not be less than five ft 10 inches,? said Sonia Swami of Applause Entertainment, the event management company running the show.

 ?It?s not just about good looks. It?s about choosing a man of substance. He must have the boy-next-door appeal with a good personality and intelligence quotient,? added Swami.

 It all took less than a minute for each aspirant. Fifteen seconds is all they were given to introduce themselves, and 30 seconds to put their best foot forward, be it dancing, singing or acting. While the confident candidates stole the show, the hesitant ones were a little stumped by the stage show. The eastern region finalists will be declared this month and the lucky ones will get extensive training before D-Day.

Car comfort

 Stuck in traffic at the VIP Road-Lake Town crossing? If you are a guest at Taj Bengal, this might be reason to cheer, not squirm.

 A fleet of 12 cars equipped with DVD players and screens has been introduced by the Alipore hotel ? as also by Taj addresses across the country ? in a bid to add value to the five-star service. ?The idea is that the whole Taj experience, from arrival to departure, should be one of luxury,? explains Modhurima Sinha of Taj Bengal.

 Ten Indigos and two Safaris have been customised for the Calcutta property. The Indigos have a limited spread of music videos in 10 categories ? from pop to classical music. There are two screens behind the front seats, with personalised screen-side or remote controls. In addition to this, the Safaris also pack in a Sony PlayStation. A mini-fridge at the back of the vehicle is stocked with mineral water and cold towels to refresh tired travellers. The Safaris, too, are fitted with a mechanism to block dust coming in through the air-conditioning vents.

 While this service does not come cheap ? one-way airport transfers in an Indigo come a shade shy of Rs 1,500, and it?s even more for the larger vehicle. 

 Though more exclusive car makes were on offer, the entertainment add-on is emphasised here. ?We have a rise of over 25 per cent in usage of our cars after the revamp, particularly for in-city travel,? reveals Subrata Bhattacharya, in charge of the travel desk.

 Over 70 per cent of guests would be availing of the airport-transfer service ordinarily, but many would also have previously-arranged alternative transport. The viewing selection remains limited till it receives feedback from guests.

 The current spread has been chosen by the corporate office and regional flavours may now creep in. Movies have been kept off the menu, keeping in mind the one-hour journey from airport to the Alipore hotel. Drivers have also gone through an extensive training process with some of them helping kids out in operating the PlayStation.

Filmi Art

 Gallery Kanishka?s on Hindusthan Road is celebrating the art of dokra with a delightful exhibition of bronze figurines. Artisans? Art Works, as the exhibition is called, was inaugurated on November 24 by filmmaker Rituparno Ghosh.

 The variety is wide, with beautiful bronze statuettes and items like lamps, caskets, bowls and photo frames. If you?ve got a gift to give, then drop in to browse. Priced between Rs 300 and Rs 31,500, there?s something to suit most pockets.

 The gallery has been tastefully decorated with characters from Abol Tabol smiling up from a low table, while an arrogant Ravana looms large at the other end of the gallery.

 The most prized item is a Durga idol that stands regal at the entrance and comes with the highest price tag. The exhibition will continue till December 4.

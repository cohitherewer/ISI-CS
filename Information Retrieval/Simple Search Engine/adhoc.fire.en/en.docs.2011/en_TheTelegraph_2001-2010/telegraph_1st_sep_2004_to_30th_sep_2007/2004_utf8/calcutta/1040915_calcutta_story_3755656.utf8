The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The majority of officials manning the stalls at the recently held travel and 

tourism fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium were not able to reply to queries on details 

about tourist spots. People of Bengal, especially Calcuttans, are great travellers 

and await the fair with much eagerness every year. The organisers, I must say, 

left no stone unturned to woo the visitors. Video displays, distribution of leaflets 

and brochures, discounts on package tours, a provision for spot booking, contests 

and lucky draws ? there was so much that one would want to plan a perfect outing. 

Another glaring deficit was a wall map of a northern district, published by a 

public sector unit, had distorted facts and misspelt names of places. The authorities 

should pay attention to such details and depute informed people at the information 

desks at the stalls.

 Jyoti Baksi, Heysham Row. 

 New slim hoardings have been put up along many roads in the city and on the 

Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. Most of them aimed at creating public awareness about 

traffic rules and have been erected by the order of the deputy commissioner of 

police (traffic). However, the hoardings are too low in height and could injure 

a pedestrian if he is not attentive.

 Shiv Shankar Almal, Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Dozens of bus depots have been constructed on acres of land in the Calcutta 

metropolitan area for night parking and repair of Calcutta State Transport Corporation 

and Surface Transport buses. However, as of now, many state buses are in disrepair. 

During the time that they are made fit to operate in the workshop, a portion of 

these state bus depots can be allotted for parking private vehicles. With flyover 

construction, water pipeline laying and road repair work in progress on many busy 

thoroughfares, the vacant space in the depots can be temporarily put to good use. 

This will solve our parking woes till the repair and construction work is completed. 

 Chandan Ray, Sarsuna. 

 Satta operators are operating on Shamsul Huda Road in Park Circus (ward 

no. 65) for over two years now. Goons gather at a particular spot in the area 

to gamble. They also pass lewd remarks at girls passing by. A few weeks ago, I 

even spotted a local man selling country-made liquor near the spot. The Karaya 

police have never taken any action against these hooligans. One wonders if they 

benefit from the money made from the illegal business! I request the higher authorities 

to take strong action against both the satta operators and the blind cops. 

 Name amp; address not given.

 Traffic constables can breathe easy. No, not at their port of call ? as precious little is being done to reduce air pollution at the crossroads ? but in 10 traffic guard offices, where oxygen parlours are being put in to provide smoked-out cops a breath of fresh air.

 ?We will set up these parlours before Durga puja. Each unit will cost Rs 70,000, but they will definitely help our traffic policemen to cope better with vehicular pollution,? announced commissioner of police Sujoy Chakraborty on Friday, while inaugurating the first parlour, donated by BOC, at the BBD Bag bus terminus.

 This oxygen-therapy move was initiated after a health-assessment report compiled by the city police revealed a large number of traffic constables suffering from asthma and bronchitis. 

 Despite court directives and pressure from the green lobby, the state administration has done nothing to improve the quality of air that the city breathes. Police laxity in monitoring pollution measures has been one of the prime culprits in the failure to lower toxic content of the ambient air.

 Now comes a temporary succour for a few. ?As the report pointed out that the cause of the diseases suffered by constables was the air pollution they faced every day, we informed the state government about this and sought financial help to set up the oxygen parlours. We want to set up such parlours in police stations, too,? commissioner Chakraborty added.

 Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner of police (traffic department), said: ?Constables on the morning and afternoon shifts are the worst hit. They could turn to the oxygen parlours for a rejuvenating session.?

 Rejected by kin even in death 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Even after his death, there was no taker for the body of 21-year-old Sampad Mukherjee, who was in Presidency jail in connection with the murder of teenager Kuntal Sain. 

 Sampad, desperate to make some quick money, had allegedly hacked Kuntal to death on the night of July 1, in connivance with another youth, Arijit Pal, his younger brother Jyotirmoy and mother Manjusha. All are in jail. 

 Hours after Sampad was found dead inside cell no. 35, his octogenarian grandfather Biswanath Mukherjee flatly refused to accept the body. 

 ?Sampad may be my grandson but I severed all links with them ever since my son Ashok discarded his family and went missing in 1989. I have no relations with Sampad, his brother and their mother for the past 15 years. I have no wish to visit the jail and take the body,? Mukherjee said.

 He was calm when he came to learn of Sampad?s death from newspersons. ?I have no sympathy for the family ever since my son went away. This is a closed chapter for us,? he said, adding that he did not even feel like going to the jail to take a last look at the body. 

 Jail sources said Sampad?s grief-stricken mother, when brought from her cell to take a last look at her son, pleaded that the body be handed over to her father-in-law. 

 ?Both my younger son and I are in jail. Then who but my father-in-law should take Sampad?s body?? she cried. 

 Sampad?s uncle, Tapas Mukherjee, too, felt that someone from the family should visit the jail and take the body for cremation. ?After all, Sampad is our nephew. We cannot ignore this, despite his being involved in a murder case. Let his soul rest in peace,? he said. 

 Senior jail officers said on Sunday that the body could be handed over to a person related to the deceased. ?But till now, no one has claimed the body. We are in a fix. What do we do with it after post-mortem tomorrow?? asked deputy inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya.

 Sampad?s neighbours, too, are firmly against bringing the body to their area. 

 ?We have no sympathy for anyone who could commit a murder in cold blood. Let the body rot in the police morgue,? asserted Pulak Roy, an elderly person of the locality.

 Sampad?s lawyer, Bidhan Roy, alleged that he was murdered in the jail. 

 ?How can a lively 21-year-old die all of a sudden?? he wondered, adding that Sampad must have been drugged and later killed. 

 Echoing Roy, another lawyer, Sujit Chatterjee, alleged that it was a pre-planned murder. ?I want the police to arrest two more youths, Mohammed Nasir and Sanjoy Jaiswal, whose names the deceased had mentioned in his confessional statement before the magistrate,? he said.

 Chatterjee wanted a judicial probe ordered into Sampad?s death. He said the West Bengal Human Rights Commission had been informed of the ?unnatural death?.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Recently, while marketing for vegetables in central Calcutta I asked the vendor 

how the lady?s finger, brinjal and other vegetables looked so fresh. The vendor 

smiled unabashedly and admitted to using colours to give a sheen to his products. 

It is needless to say that chemicals used during cultivation are hazardous enough. 

If colours are applied on the vegetables and fruits before bringing them to the 

market, they only add to the health risk. United Nations agencies, in a report 

released on October 5, urged for the reduction of the use of agricultural pesticides 

through Integral Pest Management. The state health department and the agriculture 

department in association with NGOs should teach people to avoid vegetables laced 

with chemicals and urge farmers to abstain from excessive use of pesticides.

 The delivery pipes attached to the milk tankers are tied to the side of the 

vehicle. However, the nozzle doesn?t have a cap and dust gets accumulated in it 

when the tanker is on the move. All this dirt is washed down by the milk while 

filling up the tank at the booth. This invariably contaminates the milk. The dairies 

should take steps to supply milk in a hygienic way.

 Most cinemas are regulating the air-conditioner to maintain a very low temperature 

inside the halls. Cine-goers are feeling very uncomfortable because of the reduced 

temperature. The change in weather has left people more vulnerable to cold. I 

would request the management to adjust the temperature inside the theatres according 

to the season and the temperature outside. 

Biman Saha,

Lake Town. 

 I noticed placards outside a temple that said ?silence zone?, ?stick no bill?, 

?prayer in progress? and so on. However, the beating of drums and blowing of conch-shells 

at the temple at odd hours cause much inconvenience to the residents of the area. 

The temple surroundings are also littered. Is it not the temple committee?s responsibility 

to practise what it preaches? 

Jyoti Baksi, 

Heysham Row. 

 The Baguiati Chaul Patti is popular amongst people of Bangur, Dum Dum Park, 

Shyamnagar Road, Dakshinpara and Lake Town as it is the biggest rice market in 

the area. However, the road from the market to Dum Dum Park Shoni Mandir is full 

of potholes. Prompt action must be taken to repair the road.

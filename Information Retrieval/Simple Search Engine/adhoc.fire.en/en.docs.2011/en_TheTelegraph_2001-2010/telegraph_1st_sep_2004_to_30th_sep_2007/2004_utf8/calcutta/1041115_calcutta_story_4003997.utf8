 Saibal Chakrabarty: It is common knowledge that most shops and markets have faulty electrical wiring and do not bother to keep even the most basic fire-fighting equipment. How do you deal with such shops and markets?

 Most of the markets in the city are quite old. We are trying to ensure that they follow fire safety measures. As far as new buildings are concerned, we have started inspecting their fire safety arrangements while they are being constructed. As a result, most of the new constructions have the necessary fire protection arrangements in place. The problem of faulty electrical wiring is acute in old buildings and markets. Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee has taken an initiative to ensure that they adhere to fire safety norms. We are going to introduce a licencing system. We have shortlisted 50 agencies that will inspect buildings while they are being constructed and award provisional no-objection certificates (NOC). We will conduct inquiries on the basis of reports filed by the agencies before issuing a final NOC.

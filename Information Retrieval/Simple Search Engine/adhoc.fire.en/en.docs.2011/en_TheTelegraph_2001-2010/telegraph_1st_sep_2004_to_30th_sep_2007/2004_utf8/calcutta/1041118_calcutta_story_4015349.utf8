 A fire that raged for over 15 hours from a little after Tuesday midnight reduced a sturdy, three-storeyed, red-brick warehouse, built in the late 1920s, to a shell. 

 Goods, including garments, electrical and leather items, raw silk and polythene, worth over Rs 15 crore, were destroyed.

 Baren M. Sen, director-general, fire services, said the fire, the cause of which is yet to be established, destroyed 120,000 sq ft on three floors, each measuring about 40,000 sq ft. 

 ?The fire was detected around 1.45 am in Shed No. 4 of Netaji Subhas Dock. We have not been able to establish the cause as yet, but we must say that the safety measures were grossly inadequate,? Sen said. 

 ?The emergency internal pipeline system did not work, and there were no sprinklers or fire alarms. We will meet the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) authorities to discuss the lapses,? he added.

 Sixteen fire tenders and two tugboats equipped with fire-floaters that eject water at high levels were pressed into service. The fire brigade used an aerial ladder to sprinkle water from above the building. 

 A grey cloud hung over the neighbourhood on Wednesday, and the smell of smoke hung heavy in the air till as late as 4.30 pm. 

 One of the walls of the shed leant dangerously inward, increasing the risk of the structure caving in. 

 Thick steel girders, along with a spiral staircase, were reduced to a twisted mass of metal. Barely 100 metres away, workers were handling the cargo of eight gigantic ships that had lined the inlet from the Hooghly. 

 Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel on duty on the premises raised the alarm early on Wednesday, after they noticed smoke spewing out of the shed, and summoned the fire brigade. 

 Minister of state for fire services Pratim Chatterjee claimed that the fire had started earlier. 

 Echoing Sen?s remarks, Chatterjee said: ?We are not ruling out chances of internal sabotage. The forensic reports will shed more light on the matter.?

 A CPT official said: ?A special team, led by CPT deputy chairman M.A. Bhaskarachar, will probe the fire.?

 Another fire broke in unit four of Titagarh Paper Mills, at Barrackpore, on Wednesday morning and raged till late in the evening. Twelve fire tenders tried to douse the flames. 

 Yet another fire broke out in a railway coach under repair at the Liluah workshop around 2.30 pm. The blaze was brought under control in an hour?s time.

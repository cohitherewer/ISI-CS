 Court rap rerun for CMC

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corpo ration (CMC) had another harrowing day at the high court on Friday. 

 Barely 24 hours earlier, a court bench had censured the civic board for its neglect of roads. Another bench on Friday restrained the civic authorities from demolishing a building in Kapalitola Lane, central Calcutta. 

 ?It?s unfortunate that the CMC does not bother to follow norms before demolishing an allegedly unauthorised construction. When a civil dispute over the validity of the allegation is pending before a lower court, how can the CMC demolish a part of the building?? asked Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta. 

 The bench was hearing a case on a petition filed by Ishraar Ahmed Khan, a high court advocate, and wife Sultana Khanam. 

 The petition challenged the validity of a civic notification stating that a part of the building, in which Khan and his family have been living for 25 years as tenants, will be pulled down.

 ?This is a conspiracy hatched by Masud Alam, who owns the building,? alleged Khan?s lawyer Subroto Mookherjee. ?Alam is now fighting a battle with Ishrar in a lower court, seeking an eviction order against the tenant,? he added. 

 Mookherjee also alleged that Alam, in collusion with some civic employees, had managed to obtain a notification declaring that part of the building was constructed illegally.

 ?Helped by other tenants, Alam had lodged a complaint with the CMC that the part of the building occupied by Ahmed Khan was constructed without obtaining the civic body?s approval,? Mookherjee submitted. 

 The matter will come up for further hearing next week.

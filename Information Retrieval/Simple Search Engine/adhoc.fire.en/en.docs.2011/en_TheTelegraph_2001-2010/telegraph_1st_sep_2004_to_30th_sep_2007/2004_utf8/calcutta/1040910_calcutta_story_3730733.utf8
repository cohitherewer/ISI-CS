With the retro rage catching on, a blast from the 

past is the flavour of fashion. Be it the 70s bell-sleeves or 60s sunglasses, 

the idea is to take the cue from the past, give it a new twist and flaunt it with 

elan. Re-affirming the motto, tattoos, one of the most ancient forms of body art, 

are back with a bang.

The popularity has prompted quite a few parlours around 

town to set up body painting facilities. So, you no longer have to make do with 

skin stickers available in the market or hunt out the old man who sits on the 

pavement to brand you with suspect pictures using an ancient needle.

In fact, Tressbay, the new ?Oreal parlour in Alipore, 

has a whole section dedicated to body art. ?The demand for permanent tattoos is 

very high. Right from the day we opened the colour bar, we have been getting clients 

of all ages who want to tattoo their own names and initials, or that of their 

partner, and various other designs,? says Darshini Sanghvi, tattoo expert at Tressbay.

For those who dare not go under the needle, or others 

who don?t have a penchant for the permanent, the body painting option is both 

easier and painless. What?s more, you can flaunt different images at different 

parties and even match the colours with the outfit you are wearing. You just have 

to get together a few bottles of fabric paint, pick up the brush and give your 

imagination a free run.

Brush with creativity

A temporary tattoo is only good till the first wash 

so it is best applied just before you are heading to a party. You can coordinate 

the colours with your jewellery or outfits. For this you will need a few fabric 

colours, a paintbrush and some ideas for designs. ?For painting the tattoos, we 

use special paints imported from Thailand. Mehndi is also widely used for 

this,? says Darshini.

Designs galore

While you can paint just about any image that comes 

to mind, there are a few patterns that are fashionable at the moment. Lots of 

tribal motifs and Arabic designs are in. For more feminine appeal, you can pick 

from a range of pretty floral patterns, angels or hearts. Those in their early 

teens might want to flaunt cartoon characters.

Hot zones

The upper arms and the neck have always been the favourite 

parts of the anatomy for tattoos. The other popular zones for women are the naval 

area, right down from the neck to the cleavage, the ankles, the shoulder (to be 

shown off with halter tops) and the base of the spinal chord which can be displayed 

when you are wearing low-waist jeans.

Permanent patterns

The permanent tattoos stay on for life, so you have 

to be really sure you want it before getting one. Once you have made up your mind, 

choose a parlour of repute as it is best to be confident that they use hygienic 

methods and sanitised instruments, even if that means paying a bit extra.

?At our parlour, permanent tattoos are done with disposable 

needles and every piece of equipment is sterilised,? explains Darshini. Apparently, 

pain should be no deterrent, either. ?The prick is very mild,? she stresses.

Not just that, an anti-allergy solution is applied 

over the area before the tattoo is done. The client is also advised to take an 

anti-allergy pill after the job.

The permanent ones are of two types ? black and coloured. 

The designs are more or less the same as the painted ones.

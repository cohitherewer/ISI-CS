It was agitation time once again at Presidency College, 

this time for a civic cause, and though it lasted only seven hours, it brought 

the college authorities to their knees.

 At 10.30 am on Wednesday, under-graduate students went on a hunger strike to pressure principal Amitava Chatterjee to take early steps for cleaning up the heritage campus. 

 The prime demand: Chatterjee must give the student body a bona fide assurance that steps will be taken immediately to rectify the situation. 

 At 5.30 pm, Chatterjee conceded all the students? demands in writing, prompting them to call off the fast.

 ?The principal has assured us that things will change for the better in two months,? said Upal Chakraborty, general secretary of the Presidency College Students? Union. ?It remains to be seen if he is a man of his word,? he added, implying that a reinforced agitation may be on the cards, should the principal fail to act.

 Chakraborty, accompanied by other student representatives, submitted a memorandum to Chatterjee on Wednesday morning, pointing out the areas that need immediate attention. The three-page document mainly focuses on the dilapidated condition of the campus buildings and co-curricular facilities, and on how the campus lacks adequate clean-up facilities. 

 Chatterjee was busy with a University Grants Commission-sponsored seminar, and could not be contacted for comment. College officials confirmed that Chatterjee had called up the municipal authorities concerned and had arranged for sweepers to clean some parts of the college.

 At around 3.30 pm, a band of sweepers was busy cleaning the road behind the Baker Laboratory building that leads to the rear gate of the college. 

 Laboratory wastes from the bio-science departments, located in the building, are regularly dumped there, violating animal ethics committee norms and creating a potential health hazard for all those who use the road, students? union members claimed.

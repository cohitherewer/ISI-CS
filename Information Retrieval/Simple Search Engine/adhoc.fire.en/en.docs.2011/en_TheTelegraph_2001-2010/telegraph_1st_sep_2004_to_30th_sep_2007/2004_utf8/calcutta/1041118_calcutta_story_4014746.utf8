 Understanding an epic

 Michael Madhusudan Dutts celebrated epic-narrative, Meghnadbadh Kabya, though revered and held in high esteem by those with a penchant for literature and the arts, suffers from detachment owing to its seemingly remote language and unconventional rhyme-scheme. Nandikar?s stage rendering of the epic makes an effort to deliver the poem from its aloofness by relating it to our everyday experience. Dance hastas, songs and an intimate tone in the language bring the action to life, at the same time help reduce the seriousness associated with the poem. Venturing on a totally new stage experiment which fuses narration, description and dialogue into an integral whole, the performance features a single kathak (storyteller) whose controlled movements and expressions captivate the audience by articulating the passion, energy and agony of Meghnad in his final moments. Acting and direction: Goutam Halder.

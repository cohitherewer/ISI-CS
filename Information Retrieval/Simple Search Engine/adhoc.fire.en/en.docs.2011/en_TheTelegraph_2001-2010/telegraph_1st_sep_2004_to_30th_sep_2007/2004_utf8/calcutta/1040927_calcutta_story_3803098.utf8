The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Food is fuel for busy bees

From liveried bearers serving four-course 

meals to coupon counters in swank interiors, canteens are often the lifeline for 

a workforce, discovers Ipsita Deb

Walk in around lunchtime and you?ll know what a mid-day 

meal means to a workstation. It?s a survival tool in more ways than one ? sustenance 

for body and soul, you?re told.

Where the table is what?s on it are of equal importance. 

Office cafeterias can be broadly classified into four categories. Those adopted 

from the Raj where gloved bearers in starched livery will serve you a four-course 

meal. 

Then there are places where the gloves have been snatched 

off and the uniforms discarded due to mounting costs and other causes.

The third category (which is the most common) is when 

free, highly or barely subsidised fare is provided to employees. The food in this 

case is cooked in the office kitchen. The last is when the office provides the 

space and the food is outsourced.

Age-old appeal

Old horses like J. Thompson and a certain reputed 

tea company still have the Raj hangover in place. With lunchrooms for junior and 

senior employees, the meal itself is an elaborate affair comprising a three-course 

spread, vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Usually, Continental cuisine is served 

and the food is both light and tasty. 

Served on silver cutlery by well-turned-out bearers, 

the sumptuous meal ? free for all employees ? usually ends with biscuits and cheese.

Change chime

Twelve years ago, the CESC head office, better known 

as Victoria House, would serve up the British style of fine-dining with an elaborate 

four-course meal for its employees, whether they be junior peons or top officials. 

?Experienced white-uniformed khansamas from Chittagong, who would gather 

ingredients from different parts of the city,? recounts K.N. Sanyal, administrative 

director, CESC.

Today, there is a cost canteen where coupons are sold 

in the morning to enable cooks to buy the ingredients. Stainless steel has replaced 

silverware and the meals themselves are cheap but not subsidised. A hot favourite 

today is Kasha Mangsho and vegetable samosas, a Saturday special.

Indal is another case in point of a place being forced 

to put an end to its fine-dining ways. But it does provide dining space to its 

employees. 

Foreign flavours 

While the Hutch cafeteria swears by Kurry Klub, Airtel 

digs Savourites. The Airtel lunch space comprises swank red tables and wrought 

iron chairs. Employees are offered multi-cuisine meals and food is even served 

late in the evenings for the call centre executives. 

Shruti Kant Pal, chief HR officer of Bharti Cellular 

Ltd, says: ?Apart from lunch hour, this is the place where employees gather for 

special events or to watch important cricket or football matches.?

BOC?s multi-facility centre Ozone boasts of a caf? 

called Moksha, with food and beverages sourced from Caf? Coffee Day. The d?cor 

is in orange, with green sprinkled in between. The tables have board games painted 

on them.

Starry affair 

The Taj Bengal cafeteria, with its bright lighting, 

colourful upholstery and weekly food themes, has the ambience of just another 

restaurant within the hotel, and the food is served in an elaborate buffet. 

?This week, the engineering department is in charge 

of the canteen and the cuisine is Chinese. The whole place has been decorated 

with Chinese lanterns. Interactive sessions between different departments during 

lunchtime are a common feature,? says Madhurima Sinha, HR manager of the hotel.

The Park Hotel cafeteria, though less brightly decorated, 

also celebrates food themes like street food, summer coolers and Hilsa festivals.

For VSNL, the cafeteria is a source of major HR activity. 

Being almost 4,000 sq ft, it is designed with green marble flooring and table 

tops. Hygiene is the keyword here as is proven by a walk through the kitchen. 

Priced at an unbelievable Rs 2, employees can savour a wide array of vegetarian 

and non-vegetarian items.

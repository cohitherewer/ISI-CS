The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Stunning scent of a woman

Create the impression that lingers long 

after you have left the room. With smelling good becoming as important as looking 

good, Himika Chaudhuri explores how you can find your signature fragrance

Almost nothing attracts as much attention as the scent 

of a woman and, no matter how much you deck up, it?s your smell that is sure to 

make the impression that lingers.

?I wouldn?t step out of my house without a generous 

dose of my favourite perfume Davidoff Cool Water or Dune by Christian Dior,? said 

actress Nelanjana Bhowmick. 

From the floral for the formal party, strawberry for 

movie with friends, musky for the night-out with Prince Charming and subtle for 

an office board meeting, a perfume can say much about your mood. 

City malls have felt the frantic rush for the right 

fragrance as well, with women increasingly looking to make a classy scent statement.

?The perfume market is aspirational, with the brand 

conscious moving away from mass-market perfumes to the high end,? said Naveen 

Mishra, unit head, Shoppers? Stop, Forum.

for the classic Chanel no. 5 to Catherine Zeta Jones for Elizabeth Arden, labels 

have pulled out all the stops to entice shoppers with their heady fragrances.

While favourites in the high-end segment remain products 

of Christian Dior, Davidoff and Elizabeth Arden, here is a guide to how to go 

about picking your bottle, available at a number of shops and departmental stores 

across the city.

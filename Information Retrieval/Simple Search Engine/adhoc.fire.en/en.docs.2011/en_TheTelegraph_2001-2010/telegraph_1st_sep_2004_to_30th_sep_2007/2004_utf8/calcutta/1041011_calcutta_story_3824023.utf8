 After having their fill of innovative idols and bizarre light-o-craft, theme-based pujas have now come to be the craze of the season.

 And the organisers are willing to go to any extent, even allotting a substantial part of their budget to reproduce authentically the themes they have chosen.

 New Alipore?s Suruchi Sangha, for instance, has kept aside Rs 32,000 (around 6.6 per cent of the Puja budget) to procure books, CDs and VCDs to learn about Rana Pratap and his period. 

 The award-winning club plans to transport pandal-hoppers to Rajasthan, complete with a replica of the historic Chittor fort standing erect amidst vast swathes of sands, dotted by undulating dunes. 

 The ambience will be supplemented by a display of the art and culture of Jaisalmer, Jaipur and Chittor.

 Jumping on to the bandwagon, a club in Babubagan has ordered 10,000 tiles and 40,000 bricks and one in Barisha, eight country boats and scores of moghas (Rajbanshi masks carved out of wood). 

 A club on Motilal Nehru Road will use 100 kg of lozenges to decorate its pandal, while another in Putiary will be decked up with a million pieces of marble.

 Turning green, a club in Haridevpur is decorating its pandal with 300,000 wood apples, while a 7.95-km jute plait is being readied for a pandal in Picnic Garden (Kustia).

 Justifying the expense on books, CDs and VCDs, Suruchi Sangha president Aroop Biswas said: ?Satyajit Ray had taught us through Sonar Kella that no theme can be reproduced in minute details, without sufficient back-up and research.? 

 After the Puja ends, the books, some of them rare titles, will be distributed among book-lovers and libraries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Countdown to century tryst

 Clubsandwich

 The aroma of exotic cuisine from 

 distant shores, strains of bhatiali or Vivaldi in 

 the air and the clatter of waltz and foxtrot on the floor... 

 Maybe even Zubin Mehta?s adroit baton weaving symphony magic 

 or a quadrangular ODI meet involving England, Pakistan Bangladesh 

 and India whipping up cricket frenzy in town?

 The possibilities are endless 

 as The Calcutta Club (in picture right), which bears eloquent 

 testimony to the social history of the city in both undivided 

 and post-Partition India, pads up for a glorious century. 

 On April 15, 1907, when other city clubs were exclusive 

 preserves of Europeans, a few ?prominent English and Indian 

 gentlemen? met and decided to form a social club where both 

 Indians and Europeans would enjoy equal status, facility 

 and treatment.

 Now, the institution, which had 

 the then viceroy Lord Minto as its patron and Maharaja Nripendra 

 Narayan Bhup of Cooch Behar as the first president, is gearing 

 up to embrace the glittering milestone. When the clock strikes 

 midnight on December 31, 2006, The Calcutta Club will usher 

 in the New Year with a spectacular display of fireworks?

 And the club hopes to carry the 

 celebrations right through the 12 months thereafter, for 

 which, a distinguished guest list is being pencilled. ?Besides 

 Calcuttans of eminence from all walks of life, we will also 

 invite foreign delegates ? maybe descendants of old members 

 or those who have some connection with the club and the 

 city,? declares president Bhaskar Sen.

 Lord Harry Woolf, Lord Chief Justice 

 of England, figures prominently on the probable invitees? 

 roster, while efforts are on to trace out material on and 

 scions of prominent former members, including the likes 

 of Lord Carmichael, then governor of Bengal and vice-patron 

 of the club.

 The management has formed two 

 sub-committees ? the centenary research advisory committee 

 and the centenary commemorative stamp committee. Two more 

 panels will address planning/programming and resources. 

 ?We are exploring all avenues to cull material on important 

 past members,? says Dhrubajyoti Banerjea, chairman, centenary 

 research advisory committee.

 The International Nite, likely 

 to kick off the commemoration in January, could feature 

 an international food festival. ?We will also sound out 

 Jagmohan Dalmiya on the possibility of hosting a four-nation 

 One-Day tourney with teams from the UK and the subcontinent,? 

 offers Banerjea. The centenary committees will co-opt past 

 presidents, existing members and ?anyone who can contribute? 

 to the cause, the management promises.

 Decking up for the occasion is 

 already underway, with restoration of the old photographs 

 and lithos, fresh landscaping for the garden and upgrading 

 of the solar heating of the swimming pool. Close to the 

 century year, the regal heritage building will get a fresh 

 coat of paint as well.

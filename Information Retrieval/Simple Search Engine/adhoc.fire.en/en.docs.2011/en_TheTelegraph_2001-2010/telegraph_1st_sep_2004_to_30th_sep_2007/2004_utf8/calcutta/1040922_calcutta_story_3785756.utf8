 Twin mishaps, two deaths

 - 35 in hospital after accidents, toll includes Class XI student

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Twin accidents in Howrah on Tuesday claimed the lives of two persons, including a Class XI student, and left 35 injured. 

 The errant vehicles have been impounded and the drivers arrested. 

 Mohammad Irfan and Mohammad Safraj, both students of a Howrah school, were on their way to a friend?s house on a motorcycle when a speeding lorry knocked them down on GT Road.

 Irfan, who was driving the two-wheeler, and Safraj were rushed to a nearby hospital, where the former was declared dead. Safraj was released after treatment. Both were residents of Pilkhana, in Golabari.

 ?We were going to a friend?s house in Shibpur?s Mandirtala to collect some lecture notes. On the way, I lost my friend,? recalled Safraj.

 ?Irfan?s body was identified by his father, Mohammad Illyas. We have released the body after post-mortem,? said Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, superintendent of police (Howrah).

 In the other accident, an Amta-bound private bus, with around 70 passengers, swerved out of control and rammed into a tree near Kajipur, in Bagnan. Thirty-five passengers were injured. One of them, Luftar Rahaman, 35, died on the way to hospital. 

 Of the injured, 11 were admitted to Uluberia State General Hospital, where their condition was said to be critical. The hospital authorities fear three of them may not survive. ?We have shifted them to the emergency ward, where they are under special supervision,? said an attending doctor. 

 Residents along the Bagnan-Amta Road held a demonstration for an hour to protest the bad condition of the arterial thoroughfare. The protesters alleged that the authorities had turned a blind eye to the road?s condition, which had been turning worse by the day over the past few months.

 Concerned over the spurt in road mishaps, police urged drivers to restrict their speed limits. ?We have sent a bunch of proposals to the higher authorities to arrest the trend,? said a senior officer.

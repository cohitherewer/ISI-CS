Kakoli Bera is 29 years old. Three years ago, she 

could barely talk coherently, heard voices in her head, couldn?t go out of the 

house on her own and could only perform the very basic functions of daily life. 

Now, she earns a living by stitching and embroidery, is learning computer, goes 

everywhere on her own, does all the housework and loks after ailing mother. Above 

all, Kakoli, a sufferer of Schizophrenia, loves being herself.

 ?Ami shob korte pari,? she says. She used to have prolonged periods of hallucination. Recently, she had no problems staying alone at home when her mother had to be hospitalised. She stitches for about 10 hours every day ? her favourite is cross stitch and embroidery ? and cooks the meals ? ?maach, mangsho, dal, torkari, shaag?. And she keeps accounts of her earnings. All because her mother had hope.

 Kakoli is one of several success stories of people with mental illnesses. Intervention and counselling at the right time is the key, said Ishita Sanyal, founder of the NGO Turning Point, which conducted a three-day workshop on how to deal with the disease from November 8 to 10.

 ?Family support is very important. They are professionals in their own right, because they know the affected family member like nobody else does,? explained Jim Crowe, president, World Fellowship for Schizophrenia and Allied Disorders. The New Zealander is in town for a ?follow-up session? after his first visit last year. 

 The role of the family, doctor, healthcare professional and counsellor, as well as those living with Schizophrenia, were topics of discussion during the workshop. Parents talked about their frustrations, but there were also heart-warming tales of people who had conquered the mental illness and are living normal lives. ?One of the girls has just a government job,? added Sanyal.

 People like 26-year-old Prashant Singh, who went to Turning Point of his own accord over two years ago, after long bouts of depression and concentration trouble. His family doesn?t know of his illness, but he is not ashamed to admit that he has it. He has learned to cope, and now works in the family real estate business and volunteers with other patients at the NGO. Yoga, Art of Living and reading Swami Vivekananda?s books help him. 

 ?Stigma is something that never goes away. It?s there every where. But there?s a change here from the last time. More people are willing to talk,? said Crowe. His last trip was to Iran, where he toured hospitals and homes. Next year, he?s off to Iraq. He?s happy that things are improving in Calcutta.

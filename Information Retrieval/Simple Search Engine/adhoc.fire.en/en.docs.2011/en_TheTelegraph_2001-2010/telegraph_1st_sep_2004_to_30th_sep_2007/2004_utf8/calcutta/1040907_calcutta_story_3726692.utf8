 The City Diary

 The construction of a highrise at Ramgarh, in south Calcutta, has been stopped following demands by local CPM and Trinamul Congress leaders that the promoter place orders for building materials with unemployed activists of their parties. 

 n this connection, the Trinamul organised a meeting on Sunday. It was attended by party MLA Sougata Roy. The partys block president Bibhu Nandi said: We will not allow the construction to resume till the unemployed youths of our party are allowed to supply the materials. Not to be outsmarted by the rival, local CPM councillor Buddhadeb Bose said: Demands made by the unemployed youths are not unjustified. Instead of buying materials from outsiders, promoters should engage local unemployed youths.

 romoter Shyamal Dutta has adopted a compromise formula. I will compromise with both parties as they have considerable clout in the area. I hope work will start soon, he said.

The Down train will start from Prantik at 12.55 pm and arrive at Bolpur at 1.02 pm. Thereafter, it will proceed to Howrah at 1.15 pm.

 Tension prevailed in Topsia throughout Monday after a demolition squad from the civic conservancy department pulled down a defunct pump house on Sunday night. Local residents claimed the civic body did not inform either the local councillor or the water supply department prior to the operation near the 24A bus stand. The conservancy department, however, went ahead and removed the debris. 

 hief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury said the action followed a request made earlier to the water supply department by the city police to demolish the structure to facilitate smoother traffic movement. There are over 300 such defunct pump houses in the city and some have even been converted into party offices illegally, an official said. 

 Water supply in certain pockets of Behala was disrupted on Monday. The civic body attributed the disruption to a breach in a 24-inch diameter pipe near Behala police station. The breach was repaired in the evening.

 A departmental probe has been initiated against a sub-inspector of Entally police station after local residents blocked Sealdah-Beleghata Canal Road, protesting his high-handed behaviour on Sunday night. The protest followed raids on three houses in the crowded locality, off Beleghata Main Road, early on Monday, by the sub-inspector and three constables. Local residents claimed the cop arrived with labourers and asked the tenants to move out in the middle of the night. When they refused, the policeman ordered the labourers to drag the family members, including women, out of the house. This, they say, led to an argument between the residents and the cops. The house owners were arrested as they had apparently asked the police to carry out the raids. 

 Twelve persons were arrested from various online lottery centres on Monday on charges of allowing rowdies to gather in front of the centres. Eight centres in Gariahat, Karaya and Maniktala were raided and sealed.

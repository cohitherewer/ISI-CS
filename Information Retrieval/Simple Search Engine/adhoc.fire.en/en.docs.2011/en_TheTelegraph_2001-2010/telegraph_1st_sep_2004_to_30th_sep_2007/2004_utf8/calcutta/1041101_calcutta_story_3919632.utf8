L-zone: The Elite store

Shine on

 Watch your step as you walk into this lifestyle zone at 6, Little Russell Street. You don?t want to trample on Dennis (of Menace fame) in bush shirt, shorts and cap.

 Don?t let the mischievous handful scare you away, either. This is a rather harmless acrylic version of the fictional character. In fact, the only thing you might reasonably be afraid of is the price tag. And it is not the most expensive (or exotic) item at The Elite Store. The three-year-old shop stores high-end crystal, glass and acrylic products imported from Europe and Asia.

 ?We have something for everybody. You can pick up an ashtray for Rs 80 or you can go in for a decorative item worth Rs 18 lakh which we will be unveiling before Diwali,? said Suresh Roy, the associate manager of the 3,000-sq feet store.

Glass act

 The store boasts of glass products from such brands as Toyo from Japan, Walther Glass from Germany, Ocean from Thailand and many more. From lassi to liquor, there are glasses for most beverages. Try out the conical ones, perfect for the desi yoghurt concoction or the tulip variety if wine sits better on your palate. If champagne or cocktails are your choice, grab some glasses especially for the purpose. A set of six can cost anything between Rs 200 and Rs 10,000. Dinner sets range from Rs 1,500 to Rs 10,000.

Crystal clear

 The store houses a timeless, formidable collection of crystal products. ?Most of our products are 24 per cent lead crystal, which is what makes them so bright,? added Roy.

 Galloping Forward (a jockey on his horse), With the Same Heart (a couple) and Mind and Hope to Fly (two birds in a nest) are some of the pieces in crystal and porcelain you would love to flaunt. Besides these, there are utility products in crystal, too. Centre-table plates in all shapes and sizes, shot glasses and decanters to store wine are just a few of these. The crystal is all hand-finished.

Bar basics

 If you enjoy drinking but hate to do the rounds of the crowded and jostling city bars, create your haven at home. The seven-and-a-half-foot wrought iron structure available at Elite has space for everything one may require for free-flowing evenings. The circular space at the bottom is to store the bottles. The first level is reserved for fruit, knick-knacks and an ice-box. The glasses can be placed in customised grooves. The indoor set-up comes for around Rs 28,000.

Acrylic devotion

 Fountains have always been popular amenities for gardens large and small. But now ? thanks to Feng Shui and other interior-design concepts ? they have made inroads into drawing rooms and bedrooms too. The pleasant sound of trickling water helps block background noise and creates a tranquil and peaceful air.

 From large, dramatic sculptures made of acrylic with bronze finish to the smallest table-top models, the added element of water is sure to enhance any environment. The in-built motor circulates the liquid constantly. The fountains call for minimum maintenance. The indoor pieces can cost anything between Rs 10,000 and Rs 300,000.

 so in acrylic are a number of deities. The gods seem to have gone high-profile at this store. The images of Ganesha, Lakshmi and Saraswati are available in a number of avatars and in various moods. But beware, bhakti in style might have a drastic impact on the wallet.

 Reflections in simplicity

 The paintings of Sadhan Sengupta are a welcome departure from abstract works of art that are difficult for ordinary art lovers to comprehend or appreciate. Currently on view is a collection of his paintings, titled Mystery of Existence. The artist paints with a natural flair the pure and simple emotions such as love, longing and loneliness. His characters are marked by innocence and wistfulness that are almost disarming. Sometimes they appear to be hankering for that ever-elusive elixir of life, but with a quiet dignity, serenity and inner strength, far removed from the world of materialism and affectation. Yet, for all their simplicity, his figures seem to be wrapped in an aura of mystery and anonymity that bestows on them a charming, enigmatic quality. An artist who believes in realism, Sengupta uses bright, bold colours with a dramatic use of light and shade, to create stunning effects.

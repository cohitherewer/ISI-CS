The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You have tremendous confidence and social presence. 

Trust your instincts. Restrictions irritate and frustrate you. You have a good 

deal of ambition and are challenged by new ideas and interests. You want new places, 

new faces and new ideas. You are warm-hearted and helpful. ? Kusum Bhandari

Three days of fun and fairways at the celebrations of the 175th anniversary of Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) came to an end with a gala dinner on Sunday at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 Hosted by RCGC captain Aveek Sarkar, representatives from Royal clubs across the world and a fair sprinkling of Calcutta upper crust turned up to make the final fiesta an evening to remember.

 Scintillating performances by Usha Uthup (there were three, spaced out over the evening) and some great vibes between comperes Mandira Bedi and Brandon D?Souza helped make the moment extra special.

 Cricket king Jagmohan Dalmiya, tennis great Naresh Kumar, industrialist Harsh Neotia, Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman and representatives from foreign embassies were just some of the names on the elite list.

 In attendance was Richard Cole-Hamilton, captain of Royal amp; Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, the oldest golf club in the world, as well as captains and delegates from 17 Royal clubs around the globe. Also present were officials from RCGC, including patron B.M. Khaitan and Indian Golf Union president Prakash Bhandari.

 ?Golf is one of the most humbling of human experiences and the captaincy of Royal is an equally humbling experience,? said Aveek Sarkar in his opening speech. Cole-Hamilton spoke about the 250-year-old club in St Andrews and encouraged 175-year-old RCGC to carry on the good work.

 Felicitations of the foreign clubs brought a smile to everyone?s lips, with praise for the hospitality a must mention. Some also had stories to tell. ?The course did win, but as far as my own golf performance was concerned, it was what my headmaster used to say, Hall never fails to disappoint,? said Royal Norfolk?s J.M. Hall.

 ?It was the best game of my life,? smiled B. Muthuraman about winning the RNA Cup (held simultaneously with the RCGC tournament) with Cole-Hamilton as his partner. 

 The Invitees Golf was won by Amit Luthra, with G.S. Baweja finishing runner-up and B. Muthuraman as second runner-up. Gordon Simmonds clinched the best overseas golfer?s title.

 Far from the fairways on Sunday, a good time was had by all. ?Isn?t it simply great?? beamed Usha Uthup right after replying to ?And how?s the queen of Calcutta doing?? from an admirer. ?I usually do not perform three times in a programme like this. But it was such a fun thing.?

 Not just the queen of Calcutta, but the big star of the small screen, too, was bowled over. ?It?s quite unlike any other show I?ve compered,? happily admitted Mandira Bedi. ?That the participants genuinely had a great time was evident from the way they expressed their thanks.? The fact that her father had played on the Royal greens many years ago just made it more special for Mandira.

 The dinner was the culmination of an all-action week. An evening of glow-golf, a seniors round on the greens, a fireworks show and a musical trip down memory lane just added to the overall magic of the meet.

 On Thursday night, Skinny Alley, Pam Crain and Don Saigal rocked the Royal gathering with hits from old favourites like Harry Belafonte and Frank Sinatra. On Friday night, it was left to Barefoot to drum up the beat.

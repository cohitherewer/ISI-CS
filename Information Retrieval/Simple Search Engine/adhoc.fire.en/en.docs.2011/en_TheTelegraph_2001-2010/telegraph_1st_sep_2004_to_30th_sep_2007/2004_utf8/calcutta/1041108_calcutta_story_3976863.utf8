 Lights out at surgery

 - Power cut spree at BC Roy casts shadow on critical care

 KINSUK BASU

 It had happened in September. It happened again last Tuesday. Then, last Friday. Also, last Saturday.

 In a near re-run of the September horror when three children had died in just under 10 hours, a two-and-a-half-month-old girl child had a narrow escape at the BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children last week as the power tripped while she was being operated on.

 This was November 2. Two days later, doctors inside the operating theatre of the BC Roy Polio Clinic and Hospital for Crippled Children in Beleghata had to convince officials to keep the lights on till a reconstructive surgery was carried out. Surgery over, the power went off. On Saturday, the power went off again. Fortunately, no surgery had been lined up.

 Around 1.30 pm on Tuesday, sources at the BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children said, officials from the local command station called up to warn of a power switch-off. The operation in progress was a complicated one ? the girl?s biliary tract had dried up ? and a power cut was the last thing the medical team could afford.

 ?The operation stretches over five hours and since several delicate vessels are involved, one has to go about it very carefully,? explained Dr Moloy Bhattacharjee of the hospital?s paediatric surgery department.

 Even before the entire team could be alerted, the lights went out. Till large torches were organised, the operation was kept on hold. Then, as some held up the light, the doctors went about the critical surgery on the infant.

 The close call was initially hushed up. ?I am aware of the incident. We have already informed the health department brass about our requirements for an alternative power supply source and it would not be proper for me to comment at this stage,? said Mrinal Kanti Chatterjee, the hospital?s superintendent.

 On November 5, power to the polio clinic tripped. Around 12.10 pm, news of the emergency intervention came in while a reconstructive surgery was in full swing. ?We had to convince the officials it would be impossible to cut off the power while the operation was in progress,? said T.K. Maitra of the hospital?s orthopaedic unit. The power, he said, went off again on Saturday owning to a ?cross fault?.

 ?Hospitals remain our top priority and we would not tamper with supply unless it?s a must. But there are times when we have to. Unfortunately, there is still no system in place for alternative power supply,? said D.N. Majumder, executive director (distribution), CESC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Picture passage across the planet

MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

Globe trotters are not the only ones who will be impressed 

by The Travel Book ? A Journey Through Every Country in the World. This 

Lonely Planet publication ($39.99) contains some of the most stunning photographs 

of 230 countries.

Starting with Afghanistan and ending with Zimbabwe, 

a double-spread is devoted to each nation, filling 439 pages with breathtakingly 

off-beat pictures. For example, in the US-spread, there is not a single image 

of the Statue of Liberty, Grand Canyon or Mount Rushmore in sight. Instead, Yosemite 

Valley is captured with startling clarity, beside the Guggenheim Museum and the 

entrance to a subway station.

Those familiar with Lonely Planet?s extensive travel 

guides might not be expecting a work of this nature: words are in short supply, 

and most happily so. Brief information ? more fun than useful ? is provided under 

a handful of heads: Introduction, Best Time to Visit, Essential Experiences, Getting 

Under the Skin, In a Word, Trademarks, Surprises. The pictures do the rest of 

the talking.

The note from the editor says it all on the jacket: 

?As you can see, it?s a very big book and we hope you get lost in it.?

With over 1,200 images to behold, in all likelihood, 

you will.

The advice is designed more to bring a smile to your 

face than tell you how to live, as the travel guides do. The India pages tell 

you to read Discovery of India or India: A Million Mutinies to ?get 

under the skin?, watch Mother India, eat Tandoori Chicken, dhal (sic), 

dosas, samosas and curries. India, ?in a word?, is summed up as 

?Arre Vah! (Holy cow ? not literally)?.

Beauty in unexpected places is in focus throughout 

this coffee-table book that tempts you to take off on the next plane, to whatever 

the destination.

The lead picture of the Kuwait page is blue-and-white 

overhead water reservoirs. The Swiss splash is children skating on frozen Lake 

Zurich. The Matterhorn makes an entry, but much smaller. Albania is brought to 

life with a snapshot of what looks like a low-cost housing complex in vibrant 

yellows, in muted light.

?Julie Andrews appears at any moment? is the caption 

that accompanies a rolling mountainside captured for Austria.

Babies playing ?on the shores of Dili? in East Timor 

scream to city-dwellers to pack up and head out.

The glossy pages of this weighty book come alive even 

more due to the excellent printing, and at an affordable price. Available at Crossword, 

you can make the most of the ongoing discount to pick up the pulsating volume 

that will sway many a holiday plan in years to come.

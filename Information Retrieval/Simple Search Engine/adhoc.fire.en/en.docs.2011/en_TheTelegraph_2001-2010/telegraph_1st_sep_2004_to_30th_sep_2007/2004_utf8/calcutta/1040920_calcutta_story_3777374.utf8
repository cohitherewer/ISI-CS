The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 One more night, Bachchan style

PRATIM D. GUPTA

Multiple 

calls were on hold. Inboxes were full. Everyone wanted to get through to each 

other. There was just one message to convey ? HE IS HERE.

 Abhishek Bachchan?s night-outs at Shisha on Wednesday and Saturday were an eclectic mix of fun, frenzy and fan fare. While his mid-week appearance at the hookah bar was a well-disguised slower delivery, his weekend appearance at the Camac Street nightclub was a wrong ?un.

 The andar ki baat amongst Calcutta?s night riders was that the Chhota B had stayed back in the city just to soak in the Saturday night fever at Tantra. And why should he return to Shisha having dragged on the hookah and done the thumka already on Wednesday?

 But Abhishek did just that, catching his fan brigade off-guard, the night before heading back home. The look had changed in the couple of days. While the Brojo (in Antarmahal) stubble was very much in place, the baseball cap was gone and it was a more confident looking Bachchan Jr striding into Shisha with friend Gaurav Goenka.

 And then, the modern was mixed and stirred with the medieval as Abhishek turned Shahenshah to oblige jharokha darshan. Parking himself in one corner, the potter in Rituparno Ghosh?s pre-Independence drama looked more like Jackie?s zamindar self as he allowed just one fan at a time to go through the meet-and-greet routine.

 With the dance floor extending close to the Bachchan bend, the camera mobiles were wielded every now and then, with the click following an extreme zoom-in.

 While DJ Girish continued to invite Sonny long legs to join the floor, Abhishek was in no mood for naach.

 The Dhoom dude was also extremely cautious with his verbal volleys. The first thing he asked the special security guard assigned to him at Shisha was short and simple: ?I hope you are not a reporter.?

 Had he been one, he could have possibly got a language lesson in some very polite Bengali words that the half-Bengali hero is known to have picked up during his brief stay here.

 That?s it then on the Bachchan (Jr) front for the time being. Up next it will be the turn of the Big B himself to enter Ritu?s world, but something tells us his presence in the city may not be mirrored at the 22 Camac Street haunt.

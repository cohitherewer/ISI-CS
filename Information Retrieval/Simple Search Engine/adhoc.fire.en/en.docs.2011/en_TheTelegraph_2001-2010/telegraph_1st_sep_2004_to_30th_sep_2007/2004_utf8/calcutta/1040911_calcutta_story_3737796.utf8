 Rescued from vice dens, no place to call home

 PRONAB MONDAL 

 They were once lost to the flesh trade but were rescued. Unwanted by their families, they are still confined.

 Hundreds of girls ? all victims of human trafficking ? have been languishing in government-run refuge centres across the state for the past several years. They spend their days hoping against hope that their near and dear ones will come to take them back home. 

 ?It?s a fact that most of the girls are still languishing in refuge centres only because their families are not ready to take them back,? said a senior official of the state social welfare department. 

 ?Most of them were rescued from red-light areas. Once the parents come to know of the fact, they lose all interest in taking back their daughters,? he added.

 According to reports with the state home department, at least 3,000 girls from the districts as well as from Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh are trafficked through Calcutta to various parts of India and even abroad every year.

 The city police, however, claim they have a good record of rescuing minor girls from brothels across the country. ?Last year, we had rescued around 1,700 girls who had been sold to brothel-owners. The rescue rate varies from 30 to 32 per cent every year,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Apart from the parents? apathy in taking back their ?wronged? daughters, refuge centres also get entangled in the red tape in their efforts to send back the inmates.

 An official of Liluah Home for Destitute Women, the largest refuge centre in the state, said: ?Sending back girls from abroad is a difficult task for us. If a girl is picked up from a brothel, the police start a case under the Indian Penal Code. The push-back process can?t be initiated till the case ends. And the girl has no option but to languish in a centre for five to 10 years.?

 Refuge centres are engaging non-government organisations (NGOs) to counsel the parents and family members who are refusing to accept their daughters. 

 ?These families ? from districts like Murshidabad, Bankura and Malda ? fear they will face social ostracism if they take the girls back to the villages. The NGOs? efforts bear fruit at times,? said the official of the social welfare department.

 The girls have mostly been lodged in homes in Liluah, Salt Lake, Uttarpara, Midnapore, Purulia, Malda, Burdwan, Raigunge and Cooch Behar. ?Dialogues with their families are on to send them back as soon as possible. But it?s a difficult job,? the official added.

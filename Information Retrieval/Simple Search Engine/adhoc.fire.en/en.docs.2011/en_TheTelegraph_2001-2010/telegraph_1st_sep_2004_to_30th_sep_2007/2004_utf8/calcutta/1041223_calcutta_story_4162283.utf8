 Road-fix rap for tramway

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday censured the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) for not paying heed to a court order pertaining to repair of city roads.

 The bench, comprising Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Asit Kumar Bishi, asked CTC managing director Subrata Narayan Pal to appear before it on Thursday and explain why he did not file a report on the progress of road repairs, as sought by the court.

 On December 13, the court had asked the CTC to file a report stating the steps it had taken to repair the roads under its supervision. When the matter came up for hearing on Wednesday, no one was present in court to defend the CTC.

 Taking serious exception, the bench said: ?We are repeatedly saying that we are taking the issue (city road repairs) seriously. But, the agencies responsible for the condition of the roads are not paying enough attention or following the order of the court.? The case was filed by advocates Idris Ali and Sreemoyee Mitra.

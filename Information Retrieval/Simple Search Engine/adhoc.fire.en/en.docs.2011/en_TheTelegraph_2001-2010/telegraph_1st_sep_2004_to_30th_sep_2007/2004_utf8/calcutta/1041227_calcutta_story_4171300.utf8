 Freed birds adding to city?s flocks

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Testifying to the adage, birds of a feather, flock together, birds belonging to the endangered species are being found in increasing numbers in the city, according to a recent survey by the state forest department.

 These birds were rescued by teams of forest department officials from the bird markets in the city, and later released at various spots in Calcutta and Salt Lake. 

 Alexandrine Parakeet, Red-Breasted Parakeet, Blossom-Headed Parakeet, Black-Headed Munia, Red Munia, Brahmani Mynah and some other varieties have, in recent years, added to the flocks existing in the city.

 Says Vinod Kumar Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden, state forest department: ?The original habitats of these birds are in North Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and other places. But they can survive in our city?s climatic conditions and so we have released them here.?

 These birds are being rescued from various bird markets in Galiff Street, Boral in Garia and in Howrah, Hooghly and North and South 24-Parganas. They were first taken to the rescue centres and then to the spots in Salt Lake and the city, where they were released. 

 Among the birds released are 900 Alexandrine Parakeets, 600 Blossom-Headed Parakeets, 500 Red-Breasted Parakeets, 300 Pied Mynahs, 300 Brahmani Mynahs, 300 barn owls and 5,000 Black-Headed and Red Munias.

 There are other birds, too, which can be seen in the city but not in large numbers. 

 These, too, are being released in the city. ?Various types of eagles are being freed. Black kites dominate here. Recently, we have started releasing Shikra and other types, too,? an official said.

 These birds are mainly seen on the Maidan, in the Victoria Memorial Hall grounds, Shibpur Botanical Garden, Rabindra Sarobar, Subhas Sarobar, Narendrapur, and Nalban and Banabitan in Salt Lake. 

 Alexandrine Parakeets are seen in official complexes in Salt Lake like Bikash Bhavan and Mayukh Bhavan, whereas Red-Breasted Parakeets, most endangered among these varieties, can be sighted at Victoria Memorial.

 Most of these birds were released by forest department staff but there are some that escaped from cages and multiplied by breeding.

 ?These birds are definitely breeding and can be seen in specific places in the city,? said Kushal Mukherjee of Prakriti Sansad.

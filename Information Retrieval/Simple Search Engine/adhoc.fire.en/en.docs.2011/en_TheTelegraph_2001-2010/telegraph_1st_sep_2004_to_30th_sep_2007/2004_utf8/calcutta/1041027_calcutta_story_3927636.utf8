 After giving Indian toy producers and low technology product companies a run for their money, manufacturers from beyond the Great Wall are now setting their sights on the brown goods market in this part of the world.

 Under the brand name Finesse, three Chinese products ? VCD player, DVD player with a host of frills, and portable CD player with VCD ? were launched during Durga puja.

 ?We have tied up with Chinese electronic goods major Goldyip. They are manufacturing the products according to our specifications and we are selling them here,? said Pritimoy Chakraborty of Zenith Finesse, one of the largest importers of corporate gift items from China.

 While Finesse is banking heavily on competitive pricing to gain market share, the company is also putting in place an extensive service centre network to win consumer confidence.

 ?We want to make rich man?s entertainment tools available to the middle class at affordable prices,? reasoned Chakraborty. The price list: five-in-one VCD player Rs 3,000, six-in-one DVD player Rs 6,500 and discman with VCD player Rs 2,500.

 According to him, the initial response from the market is ?satisfactory? and the distributors are bullish with the products due to their ?differentiating? features.

 ?Our target is to sell around 10,000 units per month and we are looking at a Rs 100 crore topline in a year?s time. Given the growth trends in the market, we don?t think it will be difficult to achieve this target,? announced sales manager Debranjan Banerjee. 

 The company has already roped in channel partners and is in the process of expanding network in the eastern and southern regions. 

 While Finesse is rolling out ambitious numbers, existing market players are unfazed with the entry of another new Chinese player.

 ?These products are known as durables and consumers look for reliability of the brands along with the price tag. Chinese products were successful in the use-and-throw segment, but repeating the same in case of durable goods will be difficult,? said a representative of an electronics major. 

 ?If the experience of the past one or two years is any indication, the Indian consumers are yet to get hooked to this category of Chinese items,? he added. 

 He identified top of the mind brand recall and infrastructure to extend post-sales service as two most important factors contributing to sales. ?Their price competitiveness will wear off once they start spending under these heads,? he predicted.

 But Finesse is working on extending service centre facilities, designing a brand campaign, and also planning to set up a production facility in the city. 

 ?It has been proved that doubts regarding reliability of Chinese products was a myth. Our products will reiterate their superior quality,? summed up Chakraborty.

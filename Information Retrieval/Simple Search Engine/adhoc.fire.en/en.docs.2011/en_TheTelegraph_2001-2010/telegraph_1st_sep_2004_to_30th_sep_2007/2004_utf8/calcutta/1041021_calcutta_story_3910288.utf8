Give them a chance: Rare species like a white tiger can breed 

better in the Alipore zoo if the footfall is kept under control. A Telegraph file 

picture 

Apropos the report ?Township address shift for zoo, jail?, September 15, it will be a very sad day for the people of West Bengal when the Alipore Zoological Gardens is shifted in its entirety to a place off EM Bypass. 

 The zoo, established in 1875, is one of Calcutta?s most loved landmarks. All of us still gaze with awe at the huge tortoise there which is probably older than the zoological gardens itself. It was one of its first denizens. Its companion died some years ago because irresponsible visitors pelted it with stones that cracked its protective shell, resulting in an infection that did not heal. 

 Some animals could definitely be removed to other premises. Experts in zoological management should decide which animals can be retained at Alipore. 

 I suggest that the zoo be utilised for the protection of endangered species. Since most visitors will troop in at the new complex the endangered species can be better cared for in the absence of curious stares and continuous noise. The relative calm environment of the present complex will help them breed faster. The extra space can be turned into a garden. 

 As a regular visitor to the Agri-Horticultural Society for nearly 50 years, I have noticed the improvement that has been brought about by the administration. Why not let the Society maintain the garden at Alipore zoo? 

 Calcuttans do need more open spaces but not at the cost of a heritage landmark like Alipore zoo. 

 Let us hope that that the chief minister will do his best to stop such vandalism. I also call upon the general people to raise their voice for the protection of the Alipore Zoological Gardens. 

 It is the lungs of Alipore. 

Sona Murshed,

The article ?Rats bite patient finger?, September 

16, was shocking. The condition of SSKM Hospital ? one of the premier health care 

centres in our state ? is shameful. But this is not the only hospital that is 

plagued by the nuisance of strays. The scenario is almost the same at all other 

government-run hospitals in Calcutta, and worse at those in the districts. The 

experience of being left unattended is also a reality that plagues ailing patients. 

Debyani Basu,

Birati.

Rats biting patients is no longer news in our state. 

By and large, government hospitals are havens for rodents, dogs, cats, pigs and 

insects. Patients are supposed to venture into these hospitals at their own risk 

because the authorities are unable to maintain the minimum hygienic standards 

that should be the basic requirement of any hospital. 

Govinda Bakshi,

Budge Budge. 

?Off the dotcom dirt track?, September 14, made for disturbing reading. With Salt Lake sulking with potholes at every furlong most visitors are forced to take a circuitous route to the IT hub. The authorities need to step up repair work or else the chief minister?s IT dream bubble for Saltlec will burst. 

T.R. Anand,

Budge Budge. 

The fiasco over Salt Lake roads is neither strange 

nor new. It is only the pockets of the authorities that are filled up each time 

some amount is sanctioned for road repairs while the potholes remain. Roads throughout 

the state are in the same wretched condition. The situation demands prompt action 

on the government?s part. 

Abdus Samad,

Incheon, South Korea.

It can be deduced from the response of poor people to various kinds of lotteries that they are desperate to try their luck (On-line lottery crosses thin line?, September 14). These innocent people are usually ignorant of the ?probability? which is intrinsic to the game of chance. The government makes pots of money from taxes collected from these lotteries. But it should also take steps so that lotteries do not ruin lives. 

Govind Das Dujari, 

Diamond Harbour Road. 

 Gambling in our scriptures is as much a sin as theft. 

Lottery lures the poor with promises of making them wealthy in an instant. The 

government should take action against organisers. 

Hara Lal Chakraborty, 

Arabinda Nagar. 

It was terrifying to learn that the person responsible for the administration of justice in the state expressed surprise at the incident of an accused roaming free, instead of punishing those responsible (Justice cry begets justice prod, September 16). 

Tapan Pal,

Batanagar Road. 

Kudos for highlighting the qualities of medicinal plants in ?To preserve, promote nature?s bounty?, September 13. Several medicinal plants like githakumari can heal severe burns. Such medicinal plants are our assets. 

Bhupen Bose,

Dum Dum Park. 

Apropos ?Court quest for water law?, September 17, it is a matter of regret that water samples from Calcutta and Howrah have been found unfit for consumption. The authorities should find some solution to replace worn-out pipes so that clean drinking water can be supplied to the city. 

Piyal Mukherjee,

Lake Town. 

Apropos the report ?Twist in lost script case?, September 18, the way the scripts have been found point to the irresponsibility on the part of those conducting the test. 

Rabindranath Kar,

Sankar Ghosh Lane.

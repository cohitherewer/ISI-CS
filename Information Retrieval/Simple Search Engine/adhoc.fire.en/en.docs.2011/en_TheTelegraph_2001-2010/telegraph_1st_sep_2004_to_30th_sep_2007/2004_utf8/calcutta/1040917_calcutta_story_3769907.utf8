The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Busy and on the beat

If you thought wedding vows (with actress Jaya Seal) 

would slow down Bikram Ghosh, you were so very mistaken. The star percussionist 

turned actor is all set to break new grounds in the world of music. And this time 

it will not be limited to just Calcutta.

 First up, Bikram?s debut Hindi film music score for Bappaditya Bandopadhyay?s bilingual film Devaki, starring Perizaad Zorabian and Suman Ranganathan. ?It is kind of an arty commercial film. There is a huge amount of silence in the movie. I have tried to blend folk tunes with a whole lot of symphony. So while I have used folk musical instruments like madol on the one hand, I have also fused Western classical strains. Devaki will see the real me, with more of the fusion music that I play (than in Iti Srikanto and Hothat Neerar Jonyo).?

 Bikram?s ?very excited? about scoring an item number for the first time in Devaki. ?There are three songs? The item number Dhuan dhuan sung by Jojo, which is very Bollywoodish in feel and rhythm; a Rajasthani folk song based on raag mand; a peppy fusion song named Zindagi bandagi from my forthcoming private album.?

 Samaa, the next album after his chart-busting Rhythmscape, is Bikram?s first foray into ?Hindipop? music. ?These days, with the invasion of remix music, new melodies are not happening at all. Samaa is my way of making a statement against this sad state of affairs. The album is very retro in feel with a 60s and 70s kind of melody.?

 While the album will be launched some time in October in Mumbai, the first music video will be shot on the outskirts of Mumbai very soon. To be directed by Somnath Leela Sen, the video will feature Bikram and singer Mahadevan as sutradhars.

 There?s also more of Bikram the actor coming our way. ?I have done a small role (opposite Rupa Ganguly, no less) in one of the six episodes of Chhoy because it was being directed by Anjanda (Anjan Dutt) and the role was really interesting. I play one of four characters, a flirtatious photographer, but there is also a deeper side to him.?

 That?s Bikram?s overflowing diary for now. Add to that the countless live shows that he has committed to and slip in a small Italian job ? yes, he?s off to Milan on September 27 for a solo act at the Asia Week ? and you known why they call him Bikram the busybody.

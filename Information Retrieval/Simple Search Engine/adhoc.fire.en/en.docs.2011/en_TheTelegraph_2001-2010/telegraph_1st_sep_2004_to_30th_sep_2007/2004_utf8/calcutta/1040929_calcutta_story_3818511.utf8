The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Jakarta jamboree

The Show:

 Passage to India, to showcase India?s best 

in fashion at Pasaraye Grande, one of the biggest malls in Jakarta, alongside 

the Gucci and Armani collections the swish set of Indonesia loves to shop for 

here.

 When:

 October 1 to October 8.

 Who:

 Abhishek Dutta, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Sharbari 

Datta and Megha Modi from Calcutta along with a select few from elsewhere in the 

country.

 Sneak Peek:

 Provided by Abhishek Dutta at his Mandeville 

Gardens studio with model Sreshtha sporting one of the creations (Picture by Rashbehari 

Das, make-up by Nabin Das). Dutta hopes to woo the world markets with a collection 

high on ?Indian attitude?.

 The Look:

 East meets West (albeit in Southeast Asia) 

with an emphasis on ?antiquity? combined with a contemporary finish. 

The Ensemble:

 Georgette dress embellished with kashab 

embroidery and double-toned denim fringe detailing. Backless corset-style tie-ups 

and semi-precious stones lend credence to the claims of a fusion fare. Further 

innovations amount to an embroidered neckline to give the illusion of an ornate 

necklace. Dull colours and acid washes help maintain a balance. Local legacy of 

a predominantly Muslim population has prompted a crochet cap with an over-hanging 

crochet notch on the forehead to do a ?Mumtaz? manoeuvre. Teamed with kashab-crochet 

stockings, Sreshtha is ready to test Oriental waters.

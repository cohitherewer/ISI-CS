The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sholay in 2 minutes

 It has all the ingredients to make a full-length masala movie ? abduction, revenge, stunts, melodrama? Yet it lasts just 120 seconds. Yes, two minutes. As the promos say, ?Don?t blink or you?ll miss it.?

 Zee Cinema has come up with a unique product to showcase its catchline ?Movies. Masti. Magic?. Paap ka Anth is a film that tells the story of how a girl who is kidnapped by a dacoit and grows up in a world of crime returns to the village to seek revenge. ?It is a case of Bandit Queen meeting Sholay,? explains director Rajesh Krishnan of Foot Candles.

 Krishnan, the man behind the Team India huddle ad for Pepsi, admits it was tough to manage the canvas of 100 people unfolding over a timeline of 15-20 years in two minutes. ?We worked on a detailed storyboard and kept complications in the plot to a minimum.?

 Paap Ka Anth is now running in 75 theatres in 40 cities, including Calcutta. ?It comes as the last commercial before the actual film starts. For a minute-and-half people are left guessing about what is being screened and then comprehension dawns as a humourous anticlimax follows.?

 ?Many theatre-owners have liked it so much that they play it during the intermission as well,? adds Bharat Ranga, business head of Zee Cinema, explaining that this is ?the channel?s way of starting a dialogue with its audience? on its 10th anniversary.

 The film, starring Vijay Raaz (flowerman P.K. Dubey of Monsoon Wedding), was shot in four locations of Tamil Nadu, miles away from the townships. ?We wanted a rugged terrain like in Sholay,? Ranga points out.

 Two minutes it may be, but the cinematic scale is still grand. Says Sabu Cyril, art director of Yuva and Main Hoon Na: ?We took over part of a huge village. All the houses were painted. Light posts and wires were knocked off. Some new houses were built which were then set ablaze during a raid by the dacoits. There were a whole lot of explosions as well.?

 Krishnan recalls how mud was brought in to cover a tarmac road. ?It looked so convincing that the village headman lamented how the road that took them 25 years to concrete had been returned to its earlier muddy condition in hours. Of course, we undid all that before we left.?

 Cyril?s magic also left its mark on the Lambretta scooters the dacoits rode. ?We found three-four of the 70s? vehicles in Chennai. The rest I had to design out of old two-wheelers of other makes,? he recalls.

 Paap ka Anth will be beamed on the small screen from end-November.

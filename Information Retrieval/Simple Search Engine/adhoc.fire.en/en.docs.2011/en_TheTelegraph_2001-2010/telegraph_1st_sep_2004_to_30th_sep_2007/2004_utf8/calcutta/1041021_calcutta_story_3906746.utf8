The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Car gas analysers on way

 - 50 gadgets to be in place before court hearing on tailpipe tests

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 After missing the October 1 deadline, the state government has started acquiring the multi-gas analysers required to measure tail-pipe emission.

 At least 50 such gadgets, each worth Rs 4 lakh, will be installed across the city before the issue comes up for hearing in the high court towards November-end.

 The government has claimed that the deadline was missed because the Centre had been late in approving the new analysers.

 The machines are being imported in a ?knocked-down? condition by a Delhi-based firm. They will be assembled there before being sent to Calcutta. 

 The Centre had fixed a ?tail-pipe emission standard? to be followed by all vehicles from October 1, 2004. 

 As per the guidelines, the emission level will have to be measured by multi-gas analysers, instead of the existing one-gas analysers. 

 Besides, they must also be able to measure the temperature of vehicle engines.

 Testing fees for cars have been fixed at Rs 100 (against the existing Rs 30) and for two-wheelers, Rs 80 (against the existing Rs 25).

 ?We hope at least 50 new machines will be installed by November. Operators of the emission testing centre have placed orders, which will start arriving in a week. Two new machines have been procured for trial,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury. 

 According to public vehicles department director H. Mohan, the operators agreed to instal the new machines after a lot of persuasion.

 ?Had the Centre?s approval come on time, the operators could have installed the analysers much earlier. They are not easily available,? Mohan explained. 

 According to transport department officials, at least three months will be required to instal multi-gas analysers at all 107 auto-emission testing centres in the city. 

 However, installing even 50 new machines by November-end will be quite a face-saver for the government, given the high court?s rap for the failure to meet the October 1 deadline. 

 The government has been asked to submit a status report about compliance of the court order by November.

 The operators who are unable to invest in the new machines can upgrade the existing ones by attaching new devices. The rider: the upgraded machines must have the capacity to measure the volume of gases and the engine temperature.

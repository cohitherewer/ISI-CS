 Park for children in legal quagmire

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A master plan file gone missing from the urban development department, dual claims and a children park plagued by a controversy are the highlights of a long legal battle dogging the residents of Lake Town.

 The master plan for the Lake Town-Patipukur township had earmarked a plot in a prime location for setting up the children?s park.

 The 6.13-cottah plot, marked as ?non-saleable?, in Block A of Lake Town, was handed over to the Lake Town Association in the late 70s. The association was asked to work with South Dum Dum Municipality for developing the park.

 Work began in the late 80s and was completed soon. ?We had constructed an indoor badminton court and some swings and slides,? explained S.K. Sinha, secretary of the association.

 Local residents, too, took up cudgels for the project, meeting sports minister Subhas Chakraborty to request him to take personal interest in its execution.

 The minister, on his part, released a grant of Rs 20,000. The money was used for constructing a building and setting up some indoor infrastructure in it.

 However, things took a dramatic turn a few years ago, when a former section officer in the urban development department claimed that he, along with two others, had bought the plot and that the residents? association had been occupying it illegally. 

 ?The association was stunned. It had all the documents to prove that the plot belonged to it,? said Arup Dasgupta, who is fighting the association?s battle in Sealdah court.

 The three ?new owners? of the property, worth more than a crore, had filed a case in Sealdah court against the association. 

 Two of them later backed out, but the main claimant is still in the fray. 

 ?We found out that he was a section officer in the same urban development department and had, somehow, managed to get the allotment of the plot in his name. We, therefore, decided to challenge this unethical negotiation in court,? said counsel Dasgupta.

 Another twist in the tale came to light when Dasgupta requested the court to call for all documents relating to the property. 

 ?To our dismay, the urban development department told a packed courtroom that all documents, and even the master plan for Block A of the township, were missing. Till now, the file, which holds the key to the entire mystery, has not been traced,? Dasgupta added.

 Two senior officials of the department had promised to help the association settle the dispute in its favour. One of them has since retired and the other has been transferred. 

 ?We will fight till the end because we are on the right side,? asserted association secretary Sinha.

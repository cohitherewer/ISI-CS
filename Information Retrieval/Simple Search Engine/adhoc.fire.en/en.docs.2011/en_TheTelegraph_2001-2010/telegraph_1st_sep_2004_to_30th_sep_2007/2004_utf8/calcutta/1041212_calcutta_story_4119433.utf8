The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Taal to techno, bol to beat

How do you turn a staid music show into one rocker 

of a concert? Well, by learning how to do it.

Realising the need for today?s musicians to be more 

comfortable on stage, the father-son duo of Shankar and Bikram Ghosh (in picture 

) are setting up a drumming institute to groom young learners.

A full-fledged campus, with lodging facilities for 

outstation students, will come up on a sprawling 20-cottah land in Behala in the 

next six months, says Bikram.

?The guru-shishya parampara of learning classical 

music in India still has a high output value, but it needs to be re-addressed. 

Certain aspects have become redundant. The course we are offering will retain 

the traditional system but orient the students to be professionals,? explains 

the percussionist.

Classes will be held on basic grooming which entails 

being presentable on stage, the art of packaging concerts and also fine-tuned 

tips like how long to stretch a concert, how to judge the pulse of the audience 

and how to choose the right piece for a particular occasion.

?A number of musicians in our country have expertise 

to fall back on, with seven to eight years of training, but they have failed to 

establish themselves. So, packaging concerts has become vital,? feels Bikram. 

?Besides, it has become a problem for next-generation musicians to garner sponsorship.?

The course module conceived by father and son will 

initially focus on tabla, mridangam, kanjeera, pakhawaj and folk drum, branching 

out to western drums at a later stage. The premises will have a performance arena 

for concerts at regular intervals and will also host drummers of repute for lectures 

and demonstrations.

If things proceed to plan, the curriculum begins in 

March 2005 with an existing student base of 150. The infrastructure will boast 

recording facilities and an archive stashed with CDs and tapes, where students 

will tune in to their music of choice.

?There has also been a change in the audience profile. 

A huge chunk, the young generation in particular, is not interested in classical 

music. So, we also need to create a listener base. We plan to offer packages to 

schools and colleges where we will provide them with listening programmes and 

demos,? adds Bikram, who will form the faculty along with his father. Shankar 

Ghosh, of course, has been conducting tabla classes at his Behala address for 

decades.

To flag off the school, the duo would be drumming 

up an elaborate concert at Swabhumi on February 6. The first section of the soiree 

marks the revival of Calcutta Drum Orchestra, with a piece composed by Shankar 

Ghosh. 

The second half will be an ?all-drum creative jam? 

with Bikram on the tabla, V. Suresh on ghatam, S. Sekhar on mridangam and R. Mani 

on the oldest south Indian drum, thavil.

Big B baritone for Ananda

Akash bhora surjyo tara? The auditorium resonates 

with the familiar baritone reciting Tagore. This is Amitabh Bachchan?s tribute 

to his departed friend Ananda Shankar, with whom he spent so many hours in Calcutta 

before he became a superstar, and so many more when the Shankars would call on 

him in Mumbai.

On stage are the dancers from the Ananda Shankar Centre 

for Performing Arts, swaying, twisting, bending to the beat. This is their tribute 

to Ananda Shankar, their inspiration, on his 62nd birth anniversary. 

This is Chirantan, ?a simple composition that 

brings alive the situation that we live in, caught in conflict and hankering for 

peace?, says Tanushree Shankar, the creative force behind the project. ?The concept 

was in my mind for long. Tagore?s songs fitted in perfectly with what I wanted 

to say,? explains Shankar, on her first tryst with Tagore. ?I did not want to 

do just another dance drama.?

The show is set amidst a turmoil that leads to frustration 

and sorrow. Yet, in this desert of despair is a flicker of hope that leads one 

to a new morning, a new beginning. With hope, one learns to love, be happy and 

have the courage to seek peace.

The music of Chirantan is much more than an 

interlude between the five chosen Tagore songs. It is an organic whole into which 

the songs and the poetry have melded. Debojyoti Mishra, the composer, is happy 

that he had the scope to work on a grand scale in his first composition for choreography. 

?I have used a number of forms ? Latin American, Japanese and deep baroque ? with 

Tagore?s tunes. We went all the way to Chennai to record with the Chennai Chamber 

Orchestra.?

The result is pure listening pleasure. The violin 

strings at one musical moment or the sitar strains at another fuse with the strident 

statements made by the body of dancers. Towards the end, a song (Dhwanilo ahban 

madhuro gombhiro) transforms into a chant as Bachchan?s words bring home the 

final message.

The 35-minute show is preceded by two short dance 

pieces and an eight-minute musical audio-visual film on Ananda Shankar. Chirantan 

comes to the people on December 18 and 19 at Kala Mandir.

Watch in, watch out: Lissome Lisa?s time in 

town

One gets a glimpse of her only once in a while. Lisa 

Ray, of course, prefers it this way, dividing most of her time between Canada 

and the UK. Despite becoming a rage with a Bombay Dyeing ad at age 16, the lissome 

beauty born to a Polish mother and Bengali father chooses to remain low key, refusing 

most films that come her way. After Deepa Mehta?s Bollywood/Hollywood, 

she is now awaiting the release of The Arrangement. Catch Lisa, who would 

spend that occasional holiday at her family?s Shyambazar address, in town on Monday.

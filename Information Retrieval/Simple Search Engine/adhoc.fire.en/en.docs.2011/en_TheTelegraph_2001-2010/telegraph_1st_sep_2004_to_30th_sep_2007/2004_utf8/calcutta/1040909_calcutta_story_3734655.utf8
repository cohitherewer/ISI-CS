The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A tradition of turmoil

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rallies, sit-ins and bandhs ? a Bengal walking the business talk is still struggling to change its stripes.

 And in some national issues of late, Calcutta has been doing today what no one seems to be keen to do tomorrow. The ongoing tanker strike is just the latest in a line of protests.

 It started with the token strike against phasing-out of old vehicles to clear the air. The issue, clearly, was national, but the protesters could not digest a Union government directive slamming the brakes on old and potentially-polluting vehicles.

 While some states felt there should be a national consensus, others advocated restricting the ban on such vehicles to the metropolis proper. Calcutta, of course, shouted the loudest and even went into strike mode, in a phased manner. 

 Bus operators, taxi drivers and even truckers struck work periodically to voice their protest at the green diktat.

 This was followed by another showdown, this time to protest imposition of auto emission norms. While most states accepted the stringent norms set by the Centre to control vehicular pollution, in Calcutta, transport operators first organised a sit-in and then went for a token strike.

 ?This is a character peculiar to Bengal. If you recall, during the Independence struggle, Bengal was at the forefront of all protests and rallies. And post-Independence, with the number of jobless rising every year, it has clung on to the tradition,? feels Bhaskar Sen, former president of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industries. ?Somehow, the state has not been able to come out of this shell.? 

 Another case in protest point was the recent three-day strike at petrol pumps to press home their demands over lowering of taxes.

 And now, truckers ferrying oil from depots to pumps have gone on an indefinite strike to stave off the impending ban on 15-year-old tankers. ?This was a move aimed at the safety of operators and there has been no protest anywhere else,? said Gautam Dutta, general manager, Indian Oil Corporation.

 Some, of course, miss the clouds for the silver lining. ?Several big names, like Reliance and Wipro, are coming to the state and some major investments are already in place. Let us not always see the negative side,? suggested Sanjay Budhia, past chairman, CII (eastern region).

 Graduating in style

The best thing about a student fashion show is the amount of enthusiasm that goes behind every collection and the cheer and applause accompanying it. 

 The Rang Manch at Swabhumi on Tuesday evening reverberated with thunderous applause from fellow students as 45 young designers from the Bhawanipur Education Society College unveiled their graduating collections at Fashionista ?04, the annual fashion extravaganza of the college.

 The show kicked off with the Ex-Factor collection, put together by former students of the institute and moved on to Future-Era, a line by the students of the Fashion-Online department. The graduating show followed, with 10 collections designed by 45 students.

 Creativity and innovation defined the collections. The funk factor was high with the ?anything goes? look ruling the roost. This was brought about by the use of wacky accessories and fabric in contrasting colours. Garments displayed included saris, salwars, lehngas, trousers, skirts and jackets. 

 Themes ranged from Greek gods, human expressions, cross-cultural influence and woman power to digital graphics and even live-in relationships! And the names of the collections ? Desi Adonis, Forever, Teen Trousseau, Wed Denim, Intel Outside, Art-de-Cosmopolitan, Cross-Culture, Truth of Life, Statutory Warning and Defying Logic ? were often more fancy than the clothes.

 After the show, honorary general secretary of the college, Heena Gorsia, announced the awards in various categories. The best collection award was bagged by Shweta Harlalka, while Nidhi Jain walked away with the best designer of the year prize. The awards for the best student of the year and the runner-up in the same category went to Maitreyi Parekh and Swagata Mukherjee, respectively.

 Malay magic

 If exotica rules the city nightscape, can day-time foreign intrusion be far behind? Furniture from Malaysia is the latest import in town. 

 Truzo on 10, Wood Street is offering a range of leather and artificial leather sofa sets, dining sets, foldable chairs, leather massage chairs and a lot more. Priced between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh, the sofa sets are sleek and comfortable. There are discounted office furniture sets as well. 

 ?You may find less variety in designs here, but we bank more on quality than on quantity,? said Manoj Mishra of the furniture studio.

 Silk smooth

 Exclusive Indian Silk House, the new avatar of the age-old silk sari shop completed one year in December. The anniversary celebrations are on and the new stock of the season is worth more than just a glance. 

 Though the look is new, the repertoire is still retro. ?We are trying to bring back the intricate zari and silk thread designs that were so classy and rich,? said Kavita Sawansukha of the outlet. 

 Innovative designs and fabric textures continue to be the USP here, while retaining the eternal appeal of classic weaves. Thus the floral motifs of the Baluchari has made way for smart checks, while tussars with woven designs have taken over the usual printed pieces. But the showstopper is the marble print sari in soft colours on a white silk base, made by a special printing technique in the Aurbindo Ashram, Pondicherry. 

 Colourful zari-embroidered stoles and woollen and silk shawls designed like Jamewars complete the winter picture. 

 Poncho punch

 If you are yet to pick up an outfit for the New Year?s Eve bash, check out designer Sucheta Merh?s collection of winter party wear. The stylist has unveiled a special line at her boutique Earthy Myths on 8/2 Loudon Street. 

 The line takes into account the winter nip, while keeping the style quotient high. Retro-slim long jackets in natural fibre that can be teamed with almost anything from trousers, skirts to saris is just one of the pop picks here. Velvet ponchos and Sucheta?s signature prints to be paired with the skirts on offer are worth special mention as well. 

 Crochet flowers, beads and embroidery have been used extensively. A collection of woven silk scarves includes some ideal accessories for the coming months. 

 Those who want to go ethnic this year-end can opt for the vintage kurtas or saris in tussar, crepe and georgette in fluid prints with a touch of sequins and embroidery. 

 ?The collection is funky yet sophisticated, dramatic yet personal,? feels Sucheta. 

The line is part of an exhibition at the store, on 

till December 31.

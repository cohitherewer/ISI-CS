Ornamental contact lenses in myriad hues 

are the latest in optic accessories. Ipsita Deb eyes the options on offer 

from the leading brands

If you have an obsession with accessories, why leave 

your eyes out of the loop? Next time you match your bag and shoes with your ensemble 

of the day, you also have the option of making the most of the key feature of 

any person?s face: the eyes. Next to sunglasses, coloured contact lenses have 

caught the fancy of the urban youth ? both the guys and the gals. Once, coloured 

lenses were only accessible to the likes of actresses and models. But in recent 

years, they have become easily available over the counter and more affordable. 

Here is a status report of the latest in this appearance-altering accessory.

Lens labels

Where to actually start your lens shopping is quite 

a tricky proposition as there are many contact lens brands on offer from a number 

of retailers. Technology is on the upward curve and lower prices and incentives 

are the rules of the game. 

Big names like Johnson and Johnson and Bausch and 

Lomb are reliable, but it is always best to consult your eye-doctor for what suits 

you. Prices vary depending on the type of lens. At GKB Opticals, disposable lenses 

under the labels of Bausch and Lomb, Johnson and Johnson and Freshlook Colourblend 

can be found. These range between Rs 995 and Rs 1,350, compared to conventional 

lenses, which come at around Rs 2,300 to Rs 3,600. At Lawrence and Mayo, the prices 

are slightly less, as is the selection.

Colour choices

While blue, green, brown and grey were the only colour 

options when the coloured lens first hit the city market, today there are myriad 

hues of the blue, green and brown families and other shades like honey, hazel, 

turquoise, jade, amethyst and violet. There are a wide range of mixed colours 

such as grey cinza, blue topaz and green ocean.

It is quite difficult to settle on a colour that best 

suits you. The two key factors to keep in mind are the natural eye colour and 

complexion. Most optical stores today allow you to try on coloured lenses so you 

can make an informed choice rather than trying to visualise what shade would work 

for you. While Aishwarya?s green eyes (picture right) look stunning on film, do 

remember that you might not look as good with that colour.

Subtle shades

Medium-tinted coloured lenses are used to bring about 

subtle changes in the natural tone, and are an excellent choice for those with 

light eyes. These enhance, rather than change, the natural colour of the eyes. 

Light-filtering tints are useful to aid colour-blind people and sportsmen, as 

they are designed to make objects stand out from their surroundings.

Delightful designs

The Freshlook Radiance range leaves the iris area 

of the lens clear, except for a starburst configuration that adds that alluring 

sparkle without affecting the natural shade of the iris. If you look closely at 

the tiny lens, a dark ring can be seen around the area that would fall over the 

wearer?s iris. The result is crisp and sharp. The four shades here are Moonlight 

(silver sparkle), Eden (green glint), Autumn (bronze shimmer) and Sunrise (gold 

shine).

CIBA Vision?s Freshlook colour range includes Dimension 

lenses, which are made purely to enhance the existing colour of the lens with 

a specially-designed pattern that make the eyes appear larger and more alive. 

The readily available choices are Caribbean Aqua, Pacific Blue and Sea Green.

Optic options

Many people have switched from eyeglasses to contacts 

because of the flexibility that they offer, allowing a far more active lifestyle. 

The mirrored contact lens packs in quite a few other advantages: they protect 

the eye from the sun, are scratch-proof and are easily found if misplaced. All 

coloured lenses can be made to match your eye power. Disposable ones can be good 

for a day, week or month. 

Eye essentials

Lenses ? coloured or normal ? are safe, as long as 

you?re careful. Certain precautions must be taken. If you want to know how long 

you can keep them on at one stretch, contact your optician. 

Never swap or share them with your friends. While 

this might be tempting both from a cost and friendship point of view, the possibility 

of spreading infection is high. Also, always make sure to use multi-purpose solution 

designed to clean, rinse, disinfect and store the lenses.

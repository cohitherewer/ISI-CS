The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fast amp; furious models on wheels 

Fast-lane fantasies

 - Customised solutions, both interior and exterior, to give cars a new look 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Sporty rear spoilers and a cool silver coat. Walnut or carbon finish on the dashboard. Plush race car seating upholstered with premium-grain Italian leather. Fridge, laptop station, tailormade speaker positions for optimum sonic satisfaction, rooftop-mounted video screen... the works.

 All to transform your plain Jane jalopy into a femme fatale. For Calcutta?s turbo-charged GenX, weaned on a steady diet of Paul Walker?s mean machines in 2 Fast 2 Furious or Shah Rukh Khan?s red convertible in Dil To Pagal Hai, and even the not-so-young seeking a ?different look? for their cars, there are now customised solutions galore.

 AV Designs, claiming to be ?the only firm in the east? dealing with car modifications, has launched a range of makeover options, both for interiors and exteriors, to give city vehicles ?unique global looks? with a sensational transformation. Powered by the brothers Daga ? Anand, Abhishek and Vinay ? with back-up experience from uncle Krishna Kumar, the AV workshop at P-25, Taratala Road is rolling out the fleet of sleek ?designer? cars burning rubber on city roads of late.

 With new automobile models zipping out every second day and car-finance firms going on overdrive, aspiration levels are mounting fast in Calcutta. As owners click into gear for a swifter upgrade, Team AV is all geared up to address this accelerating demand. ?They do a great job with sports fits and spoilers to give my car a special international look,? says Rikki Dewan, owner of Don Giovanni and an automobile freak. 

 From Rs 15,000 to Rs 300,000, designer damages vary with solutions picked. ?A lot of customers come to us with their old Cielos, Ford Escorts or Opels, bored with the looks and concerned about poor resale rates. We give them a totally new-look exterior and interior at a very reasonable cost. By spending some money, they get a brand new look and a clutch of useful value-adds, which jack up the resale value as well,? says Anand.

 The vehicle design firm from the Glix Group of Companies has a tie-up with Standox of Germany for exterior paint and offers a card of 10 lakh computer-generated shades to choose from. 

 Depending on needs, the vehicle can be converted into a mobile home or office, with tailored options like PlayStation connection, coffee-making and shaving arrangements or even a vibrator massage for a bad back while driving.

 As the makeover moguls promise a continuous influx of new designs and concepts, youngsters are making a beeline to get their bumpers and grills redone, concealed fluorescent blue lights installed on the floor, or hand-rests and cup-holders for the extra comfort.

 With the used-cars market growing every day, companies financing second-hand cars are also lining up at the Taratala works alongside individual owners, and AV plans to come up with its captive showroom of modified used cars on the Bypass soon. 

 But first on the agenda is ?Calcutta?s maiden car-grooming centre?, in collaboration with Opulent of Pune, next to its makeover workshop, to provide customised treatment packages for longevity.

 Big-brand showrooms, too, are seeing value in the add-ons. AV has already entered into tie-ups with major dealers of Maruti, Mitsubishi Lancer, Honda and Toyota for adding designer looks to new, unregistered cars on display. 

 ?It?s only the tip of the iceberg and the potential market for modifications is huge, as Mumbai has shown,? says Abhishek.

 And Calcutta has just begun to live its fast-lane fantasies.

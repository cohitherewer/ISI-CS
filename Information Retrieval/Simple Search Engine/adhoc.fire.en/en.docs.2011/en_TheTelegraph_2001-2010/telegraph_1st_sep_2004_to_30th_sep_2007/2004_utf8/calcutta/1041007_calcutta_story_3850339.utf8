The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Two star daughters, two hurrahs 

 - Konkona ecstatic over Mira Nair offer, Anoushka savours sabbatical

 RESHMI SENGUPTA AND PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Konkona Sen Sharma: All tied up

Anoushka Shankar: Breezy visit 

 Two star daughters, two artistic pursuits, both reticent and both in the same city?

 If Anoushka Shankar breezed through a city ?she loves to come back to? without as much as a murmur on Tuesday, Konkona Sen Sharma has all but landed ?a dream role? while keeping a low profile in her hometown.

 The talented actress-daughter of Aparna Sen is poised to replace Rani Mukherjee in the role of a 19-year-old Bengali housewife in Mira Nair?s adaptation of The Namesake.

 ?Mira Nair gave me the script and offered me the role of Ashima Ganguli. I am dying to do it. It would be a dream come true,? said Konkona.

 ?I haven?t signed up yet because there?s a date problem, as I am acting in my mom?s film Goynar Baksho around the same time,? added Mrs Iyer.

 Shooting for Goynar Baksho starts in January, but Nair?s winter project, to be canned in Calcutta, New York and a UK city, ?might work out in February-March?, hopes the rising star.

 ?I play a young girl from a typical conservative Bengali family who gets into an arranged marriage and goes to the US with her husband. The film is all about her life and relationship with her husband and children,? explained Konkona, about the Jhumpa Lahiri novel that finds a pregnant Ashima in the kitchen on the very first page.

 If Konkona is pressed for time, Anoushka is making most of a ?sabbatical from touring? she is enjoying thoroughly.

 Pandit Ravi Shankar?s daughter flew into the city on Tuesday morning. In the few hours she was here (she flew back to Delhi in the evening), the sitar player-turned-actress dropped in at Bikram Ghosh?s Behala residence to wish the percussionist-turned-actor and actress wife Jaya Seal.

 This was the first time Anoushka touched down in Calcutta since the Hothat Neerar Jonyo co-stars got married, and an added Calcutta connection to her debut album cannot be ruled out.

 Anoushka?s Calcutta collaboration is already underway ? her maiden, yet-untitled album with 10 tracks (with no help from dad!) finds city tabla player Tanmoy Bose joining rhythm hands with Vishwamohan Bhatt on the mohanveena, Pedro Eustache on the flute and Ricardo Mino on the piano.

 The hush-hush visit came at a time when Anoushka?s acting debut Dance Like A Man is running at city theatres. The Pamela Rooks film may have found lukewarm favour with the audience, but as Anoushka had told Metro last week that she?s feeling ?so happy with life?, having taken a break from touring, and exploring ?so many new things?. 

 Including a secret sojourn to the city.

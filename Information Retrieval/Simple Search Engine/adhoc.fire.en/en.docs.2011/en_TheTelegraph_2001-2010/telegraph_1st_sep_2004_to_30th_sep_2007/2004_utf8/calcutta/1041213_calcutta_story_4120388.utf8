 Cop widow waits for job justice

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Deepa Ganguly

 Deepa?s nightmare journey began three years ago when her husband traffic sergeant Biswajit Ganguly was deliberately mowed down by a taxi at Panchanantala off Gol Park while on duty. That was on August 14, 2001. 

 The 27-year-woman, a graduate now reduced to penury, has since that fateful evening been pleading with the police for a job on compassionate grounds.

 On October 12, 2001, she applied for a clerical job with the Reserve Force office at Lalbazar police headquarters.

 Four days later, a letter from the office of the police commissioner reached her saying it could offer her either the job of a constable or that of a group D staff.

 On December 3, 2002, a letter from the Reserve Force office summoned her on December 26, 2002. The earlier offer was repeated. Another Lalbazar letter on May 26, 2004, killed her dream. It read: ?You will get a job of constable, but not right now.?

 ?Had the killer taxi struck eight minutes later, my husband would have been alive and I would not have running around with a begging bowl. He was on duty till 9 pm. He was hit at 8.52,? said the widow of Biswajit, who was hit from behind by the taxi of Avimanyu Thakur, now behind bars for life. 

 Thakur went berserk after he was booked for rash driving at the same spot by another policeman. The taxi driver returned to get even with the policeman who had booked him. Instead, he hit Ganguly from behind by mistake.

 ?My husband died on duty. And he did not die in an accident. He was murdered. I have the requisite educational qualifications for becoming an inspector, but there has been no gesture of compassion from the police,? said Deepa. 

 Deepa and Tukurani, her 68-year-old mother-in-law, live in their rickety house at Shakuntala Park, Behala. Biswajit?s father, Ramendranath, a former policeman, died a few years ago of renal failure.

 Deepa met police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee on Friday. He assured her of help.

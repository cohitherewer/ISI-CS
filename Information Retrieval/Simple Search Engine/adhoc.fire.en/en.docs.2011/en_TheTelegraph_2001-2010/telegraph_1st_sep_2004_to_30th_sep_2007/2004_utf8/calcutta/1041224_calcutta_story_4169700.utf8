 What does it take to get the design of a liquor bottle right? Employees of Shaw Wallace Distilleries will tell you how it took nine months, five design agencies, 55 design options, and a six-city research operation to arrive at the final decision of giving their most successful whiskey brand, Royal Challenge, a new look.

 An effort to find the 21-year-old brand a new avatar resulted in the old sturdy and sober bottle giving way to a sleek and smart piece which, suggest its marketers, would be synonymous with ?glamour and vibrance?.

 The square-bottomed, round-at-the-top look claims it could do to the liquor business what Dil Chahta Hai did to Bollywood ? turn the look on its head.

 ?Ever since Royal Challenge has been launched, the average age of the consumer has gone down from the 50-plus bracket to the 25-plus bracket. So, we felt the need to introduce this new look to attract the new consumer,? explains A.K.M.A Shamsuddin, president of Shaw Wallace Distilleries Limited.

 The evening of the launch, aptly titled Dhoom, took off with a few presentations but soon gave way to entertainment with some jhatkas from Canadian dancer Hazel and a musical performance of popular numbers by city-based singer Diti.

 Ancient art

 Jewellery has inspired many a woman to create extraordinary pieces of art. The latest is jewellery designer Anjali Agarwal, winner of the World Gold Council?s prestigious Swaranjali award, who has managed to ?romance glass with gold?.

 Her latest collection of jewellery, which ?seems like a dream come true?, draws from the ancient art of Thewakriti (Thewa: process designing glass on gold; Kriti: art), where each piece tells a story of its own.

 ?Only 15 families in the world in the villages of Rajasthan still know the 400-year-old art of Thewa. My endeavour has been to allow this art to resurface, as well as contemporise it,? says Anjali.

 The Sun collections, which have the three facets of sun, moon and earth, are further embellished with stone-setting kundan work and the use of baroque pearls, diamonds and other gems. The Oriental collection is an exquisite line that merges tradition with modernity and takes inspiration from the ancient Chinese masques.

 Other collections include some with a silver sheen and European motifs mingled with rose-cut diamonds and precious stones. The Panchatatwa (five elements) line brings in all the elements of the universe in unison and was ?conceived like poetry?. Largely minimalist, the collection brings out the feminity and romance of ancient times. 

 The collection will be available at Trendsmith on 8/2 Loudon Street, near Belle Vue Clinic, till December 25. The prices range between Rs 20,000 and Rs 1.8 lakh.

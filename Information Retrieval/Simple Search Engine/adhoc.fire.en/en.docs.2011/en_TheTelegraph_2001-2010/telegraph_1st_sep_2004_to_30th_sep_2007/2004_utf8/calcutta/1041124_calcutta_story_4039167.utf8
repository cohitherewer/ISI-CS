 Artistic intelligence

 Transcending the boundaries imposed by language or speech, art has an innate ability to reach out to our souls and awaken thoughts and passions that inspire, delight and even elevate us. The artist?s imagination, as captured on canvas, envisages an image of life hitherto unknown to us. The Disha Annual Art Exhibition 2004, which brings together the works of a group of young artists, bears out the truth of this statement and at the same time provides art lovers an opportunity to witness the evolving consciousness of the present generation. Featuring works by Ayan Ghosal, Jyoti Tibrewal, Seema Chaturvedi, Neha Jalan, Anju Chirimar, Manashi Majumdar (Deserted; picture left) and others, the exhibition brings to focus the beliefs and convictions, ideologies and philosophies that dominate the minds of today?s artists. The paintings on show, built around themes as varied as nature, religion, family and fantasy, among others, present an interesting interplay of hope and aspiration amidst an environment of melancholy and desolation.

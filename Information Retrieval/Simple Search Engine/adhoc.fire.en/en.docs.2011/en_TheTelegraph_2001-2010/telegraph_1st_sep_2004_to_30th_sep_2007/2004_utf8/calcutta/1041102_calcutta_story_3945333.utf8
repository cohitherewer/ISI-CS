 Alcohol cure for thyroid disorder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 SSKM doctors are trying out a new technique of treating nodules, with success

 Suffering from thyroid gland nodules? Try treating it with alcohol instead of going for immediate surgery.

 For the past two years, doctors under the guidance of Subhankar Choudhury, head of the endocrinology department at SSKM Hospital, have been prescribing just that and have got 80 per cent success. 

 The treatment, doctors claim, has resulted in a drastic reduction in the size of nodules (tumours or cysts) that otherwise would have to be sliced open on the operating table. 

 Started in late 2001, the new technique of treatment saw Sujoy Ghosh of the endocrinology department, along with his senior, A.K. Singh, screen more than 300-plus thyroid patients, out of which 250 were selected for the alcohol treatment after a series of tests. 

 ?We first ascertain whether a nodule is malignant or benign. In case of a malignant nodule, the mainstay of therapy is surgery, but non-malignant cases stand to benefit from alcohol injections,? said Ghosh.

 Ashok Choudhury and Sriram Bera, who were asked to undergo surgery for their thyroid nodules, acknowledged that they have benefited from the alcohol treatment. 

 ?When the nodules did not disappear after several months, we were asked to go for surgery. That is when we decided to try out the alcohol injection treatment,? informed Bera.

 ?We selected only those patients whose nodules were benign, cystic or solid in nature. Also, only nodules less than 5 mm in size or 40 ml in volume were selected for the treatment,? explained Singh.

 During the treatment, doctors first drain the fluid out of the nodule. Then, 2-6 ml of absolute alcohol is injected into the nodule and re-aspirated after some time. The results so far have been encouraging ? a 50 per cent reduction in the size of the nodules in just a few months? time. In most cases, three injections are enough, said Ghosh.

 ?We, however, warn patients that there is always a chance, though minimal, that things may not work as per the plan,? added Subhankar Choudhury.

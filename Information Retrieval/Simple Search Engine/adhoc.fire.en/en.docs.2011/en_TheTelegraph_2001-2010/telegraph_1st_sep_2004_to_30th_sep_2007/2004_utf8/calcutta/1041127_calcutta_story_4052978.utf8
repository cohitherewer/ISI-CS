 The saviour and the saved on the same stage; one felicitated for extending his services much beyond the call of duty, the other to receive financial aid. An organisation that is not connected with the police in any way came forward on Friday to show its respect for a man in uniform who walked the extra mile to keep the chief minister?s words ? that the police are the government at night.

 Santanu Majumdar, sub-inspector of Karaya police station, was honoured for saving two-year-old Dhiren Sinha, who was lying unconscious and unattended to in the emergency ward of a city hospital with a broken arm. Dhiren, whose father deserted him and his mother before Durga puja, was given a savings certificate to pay his school fees.

 The small function at Karaya police station on Friday was attended by members of Round Table and senior officers, including deputy commissioner (south) Anuj Sharma. ?If the officer didn?t help that night, my son would have died,? said Dhiren?s mother, Indira, who was also present.

 ?We salute Majumdar. His act proves that if you have no one, police are there to take care of you,? said S. Karnani of Round Table. 

 Recounting Majumdar?s act, deputy commissioner Sharma said: ?He had taken four injured criminals to National Medical College and Hospital around midnight. On seeing Dhiren lying unconscious beside an old woman, he inquired and found out that he and his mother, who was in MR Bangur Hospital, were involved in a mishap. Majumdar immediately sent the criminals back to the police station and after receiving a go-ahead from his officer-in-charge, moved from hospital to hospital till the boy was attended to at NRS Hospital.?

 Indira, who has been released from hospital recently and still can?t walk properly, said: ?The financial aid will help me to provide basic education to my son.?

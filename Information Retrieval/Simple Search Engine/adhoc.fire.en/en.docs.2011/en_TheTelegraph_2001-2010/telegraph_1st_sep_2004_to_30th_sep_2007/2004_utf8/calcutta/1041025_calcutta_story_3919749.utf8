 Law to plug slum funds diversion

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 

 Alarmed at growing reports of diversion of civic funds earmarked for improving the slums in the city, the state municipal affairs department is contemplating legislation to stop such diversions. 

 ?There is no denying that such diversions continue and they constitute a malpractice,? municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Sunday. 

 He added: ?You cannot support such diversion because the allotted funds are meant for the uplift of poor people, who account for more than one-third of the city?s population. The face of Calcutta will change for the better if we are able to improve the conditions of the neighbourhoods in which the poor are concentrated.?

 Minister Bhattacharya said the government had already received a number of complaints on the alleged diversion of funds meant for the development of slums.

 ?Slums still exist in a pathetic and deplorable state in the city because the former Left Front board had unduly deprived these poor people of development by diverting the funds given by different agencies for their uplift,? countered mayor Subrata Mukherjee. 

 ?Since a number of influential communist leaders were from the colony areas, they had channelised the funds for their own interests,? he alleged. 

 The government started thinking about plugging the loopholes to avoid such diversion of funds following a meeting of municipal affairs ministers with Union finance minister P.Chidambaram, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad in Delhi last week.

 The ministers had been assured of a doubling of the Central grant for the development of slum areas from Rs 35 crore to Rs 70 crore. 

 According to a deputy director of the municipal affairs department, slums are totally different from colonies by definition and origin.

 In the case of slums, the land was taken over by the state government under the Thika Tenancy Act and they fall under the Slum Area (Improvement amp; Clearance) Act- 1956. Slum-dwellers are basically a different class of tenants.

 But in the case of colonies, the state government gave the land to settlers through pattas. Colony settlers are owners of the plots. There are 5,072 slums in the city and the total number of colony plots is 50,000, each measuring three cottahs. Slums are older than colonies by over 100 years.

 Slums grew in the interest of the city landlords and the business community and they have been home to the menial labour force for years.

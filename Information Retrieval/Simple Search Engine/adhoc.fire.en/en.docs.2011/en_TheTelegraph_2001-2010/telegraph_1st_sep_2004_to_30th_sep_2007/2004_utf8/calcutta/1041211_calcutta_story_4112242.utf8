 Lottery office ransack

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The regional office of an on-line lottery distributor was ransacked on Friday morning after an altercation between the lottery?s officials and Trinamul Youth Congress supporters. The officials later shut down the establishment.

 ?It was an unfortunate incident, but defending oneself against an unprovoked assault is no crime,? said Madan Mitra, Trinamul Youth Congress president, who was present on the spot.

 According to Mitra, a procession, denouncing online lotteries and asking the operators to wind up their business, was moving through the Deshapriya Park-Lake Market area, ?when we received a telephone call from the lottery office, asking us to stop the demonstration immediately or face the consequences?. 

 Reacting to this ?provocation?, the demonstrators made their way to the lottery office and allegedly stormed in. 

 A heated exchange ensued, which snowballed into fisticuffs. The mob broke windowpanes. Some sustained minor injuries in the scuffle. 

 Neither party has filed a complaint with the local police station. ?We are not aware of any such incident in our area,? said the duty officer of Lake police station. 

 ?We run a business that is both legal and accepted, so it is rather unfair that people engaged in it should feel threatened,? asserted Jayanta Mukhopadhyay, assistant vice-president of Playwin, which dominates the online lottery scene in the state.

 ?The government should come out with a clear statement regarding lotteries,? he signed off.

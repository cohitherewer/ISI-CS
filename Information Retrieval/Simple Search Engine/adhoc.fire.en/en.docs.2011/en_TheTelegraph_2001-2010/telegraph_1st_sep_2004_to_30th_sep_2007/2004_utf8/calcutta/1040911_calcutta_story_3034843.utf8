 How doctors handle death

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 ?Uni ar nei (he is no more).? That was how Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital intern Kasturi Nanda broke the news of a death to the bereaved family. Later, she confessed to friends that it did sound like a Tollywood one-liner.

 Nanda, at least, had uttered the words. One of her friends at Medical College and Hospital, confronted with the first death case in his budding career, broke the news to the men at the police outpost on the campus and asked them to convey it to the family. 

 The doctor?s job ? saving lives ? also involves handling deaths. Unfortunately, very little has been done to arm them to deal with such a delicate situation tactfully. 

 ?I know of several doctors who ask a colleague to break the news to the family,? said forensic department head A.K. Gupta of Medical College and Hospital. ?Doctors, so confident of staving off death, are often at a loss when it strikes.? 

 ?We would like to change things,? senior Indian Medical Association (Bengal branch) functionary Subir Ganguly said. Physicians affiliated to the organisation, he explained, were working on a course on improving managerial skills of doctors where the emphasis would be on handling deaths.

 As the first step, the physician will have to keep his mobile phone switched off. ?Taking calls on the cell phone ? even if it is to tell the caller to ring later ? may appear very insensitive,? Ganguly said.

 The course will lay special emphasis on the body language of the doctor breaking the news of a death.?We will ask physicians to maintain direct contact with bereaved relatives (holding a hand or placing a hand on a shoulder),? Ganguly said. ?This should be done in the physician?s chamber or in an isolated corner of the hospital floor if a chamber is not available,? he added.

 But some, like neurosurgeon Amitava Chanda, have devised their own way. Chanda, who passed out of Medical College a decade ago, was in the US and Canada for some years. 

 If the patient is critical, Chanda keeps the relatives posted of every turn the treatment is taking. He explains: ?Close involvement with the treatment is the best way to prepare relatives for an imminent death in the family.?

 Director of medical education Chittaranjan Maiti admitted that bereaved families and friends resorting to violence on campus had added to the woe. ?We will get in touch with the Medical Council of India. It is the only authority that can effect changes in the curriculum,? he added.

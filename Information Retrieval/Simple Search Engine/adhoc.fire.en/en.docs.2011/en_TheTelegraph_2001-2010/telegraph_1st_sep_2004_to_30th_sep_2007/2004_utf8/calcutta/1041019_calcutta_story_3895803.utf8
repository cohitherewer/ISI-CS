 Deity, devotion and trophy hunt

 Since my childhood, I have developed very strong bonds with the Pujas. The most important reason for this is that a shop, where various puja ornaments used to be sold, opened near my home two months ahead of the festival. I would stare in awe as the ornaments that decked up the goddess and her children used to be made there.

 I used to be attracted by and surprised at the skill that went into making them. These craftsmen made amazing crowns and ornaments for Durga and Lakshmi and Saraswati with the simplest of things like beads, sola pith and silver foil, yet these were as gorgeous as jewellery worth lakhs. 

 These artisans made the ornaments for the puja at our village, too, and these used to be transported by boat. The village artisan would have completed the image by then. It would come to life after being adorned with these ornaments. The remaining rite was that of chakshudaan. When the artisan completed this, I would be amazed at the sudden transformation. 

 There were yet two to three days to go. But I would already feel deep devotion, and at the same time a certain sense of fear at the goddess? warlike stance. Even now, I wonder at this access of childlike devotion before the Pujas. This devotion would become ten-fold with the start of the Pujas. Devotion apart, another aspect of the Pujas would move me ? its aesthetic element. 

 The beautiful image was radiant and I would be amazed at the beauty with which the fruits and flowers and other offerings would be arranged by the womenfolk.

 During evening arati, the music of the drums, the restrained grace of the dance with the censer, and the priest, bell in one hand and the lamp with five flames in the other, together created an atmosphere of such beauty that it touched my infant heart. This left an indelible mark on my mind. Today, I do not visit pandals in spite of the pomp unlimited. But the devotion of the Pujas of my childhood is, in my opinion, totally absent. 

 Today, Puja has turned into a social occasion. Devotion has no place there. But I shall always cherish these childhood memories. 

 Nowadays, a new phenomenon has entered the festival and that is sponsorship by corporate organisations. This has its plus points as well as its minus points. Because of the sponsorship, many art college boys and girls have entered the fray. As a result of which, there is a tendency to experiment on the part of these new entrants in image-making. 

Some welcome innovative efforts are becoming visible. 

Last year, I had the opportunity to see some of these innovative works which I 

admired. On the other hand, the awards being given by the corporate houses have 

taken priority over the sanctity of the puja. As if award-winning is the only 

purpose of the Pujas. This is regrettable.

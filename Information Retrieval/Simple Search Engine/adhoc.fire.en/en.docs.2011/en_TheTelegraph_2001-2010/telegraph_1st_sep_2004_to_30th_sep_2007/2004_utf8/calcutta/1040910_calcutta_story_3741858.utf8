The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Telly take on frills of life

 There is more to fashion on television than Fashion TV. And with new shows and channels being uplinked, lifestyle is the buzz byte on beam.

 Trendz, the one-year-old channel ?where life meets style?, has gone local with Diabolical while Discovery is gearing up to slip into its lifestyle avatar.

 Zee Network?s 24-hour fashion and style channel Trendz has been treating viewers to glimpses of global lifestyle. ?Trendz (unlike FTV) is not ramp-based fare. It goes backstage, talks to models and discusses their hairstyle,? says Madhuri Malhotra, associate vice-president, programming. 

 In fact, Trendz has done a lot to break the perception of fashion being unending catwalks in revealing clothes. One can catch up with the terms and the trends through educative fare like The History of Trousers, where the talking points are the differences between Capri and Bermuda or the days when bell bottoms became the rage.

 This way when fashion dos are profiled, and creative concepts behind each designer?s collections discussed, one can be ?with it?.

Diabolical, a Thursday night special anchored by Vivan 

Bathena (picture above), is billed to be the magazine guide to the best hang-outs. 

?It is urban, classy, energetic and pan-Indian,? says Malhotra. The show, which 

dropped in at Tantra a couple of weeks ago, will also hold forth on a plethora 

of look-good arenas like monsoon make-up, hair-streaking, office and partywear. 

?Keeping today?s racy lifestyle in mind, we offer one-minute tips as snippets,? 

she adds.

 Discovery?s Travel and Living, to be launched in October, will have a larger inventory beyond the pancake and the parties. ?Travel, health, food and sports are all part of good living now,? says Aditya Tripathi, director, marketing, Discovery. 

While serious food shows like Floyd in India 

(picture of Keith Floyd below) will have viewers pick up local recipes touched 

up by the celebrated food writer, there will be game shows based on cooking as 

well.

 ?Many international programmes we will beam, like the World Poker Tour, echo our own culture,? Tripathi says. Poker is considered an American pastime. But it has many similarities with teen patti. Hidden cameras will show the cards of the players so viewers can make out if they are bluffing or betting beyond their hand. 

 Tripathi explains that the accent on fashion and lifestyle on television is a reflection of shifting gears in life around us. ?In today?s double-income families, a vacation is no more a visit to the grandparents. There are golfing holidays and packaged tours. People are eating out and experimenting with food. Cars are being changed with an eye on new models. Homes are being done up and people are conscious of their looks.?

 With the willingness to spend has come a demand for information. ?Television is the place where advertisers meet their target consumers,? he sums up.

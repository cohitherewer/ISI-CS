 Alarmed by the visions portrayed in Day After Tomorrow, the chief minister has called for a broad social partnership to ensure that posterity doesn?t get swept off by a cataclysm or perish in a gas chamber.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s prescription, rolled out on Sunday at an award-giving function, comprises three planks: 

 4Involving universities and academic institutes in environment management, especially in research;

 4Strengthening partnership with the industries and trade bodies such as the Indian Chamber of Commerce to preserve the green;

 4Encouraging non-government organisations to spread green awareness.

 The chief minister, who referred to the futuristic film on the impact of the current pace of green depletion, dwelt on a wide-ranging environmental issues, such as the proposed State Wetlands Act (which debars land sharks from sinking their teeth into the watery green) and the draft National Environment Policy. 

 Echoing Bhattacharjee?s views, environment minister Manab Mukherjee stressed the need to convert state pollution control boards into environment protection agencies.

 Union environment and forests secretary Pradipto Ghosh hailed the Environment Excellence awards as pathbreaking and ?in tune with the current paradigm shift in environment control?. 

 The awards ? for industry, non-government organisations and municipalities ? were jointly instituted by the state pollution control board and the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in 2002.

 ?Three jury panels worked overtime to select the winners, based on their commitment to green norms and beyond,? said Sudip Banerjee, state pollution board chairman.

 In the industry category, the first prize was bagged by Haldia-based MCC PTA India Corp Private Ltd, the second by CESC, Budge Budge, and the third by Khardah-based Electrosteel. 

 Special awards for ?Sustained Environment Performance? went to Bakreswar thermal power and Haldia Petrochemicals.

 ?All the award-winning industries vindicate the argument that good environment is intricately related to good economics,? said Nazib Arif, ICC secretary-general.

 In the NGO category, Gontra Samabaya Krishi Unnayan Samity (Nadia) and Lokomata Rani Rashmoni Mission (South 24-Parganas) were jointly awarded the first prize. Madhyamgram Green March and Loka Seva Parishad (West Midnapore) ranked second and third, respectively.

 In the third category, Kalyani, Englishbazar and Durgapur municipalities were the winners.

 The National Library: An Act to extract

 The National Library is on a book-collection spree. Flush with the success of its officials? visit to Bhubaneswar, where they mopped up 2,200 books from various publishers, the library authorities announced on Monday that a special drive would be launched during Calcutta Book Fair 2005. 

 The move is part of the plans to collect books from all publishers in the eastern region, under the Delivery of Books Act, 1954. A team comprising senior officials has been set up for the purpose.

 Library director Subhendu Mandal, who led the team?s visit to Bhubaneswar on September 28, told Metro on Monday that the Act makes it mandatory for every publisher to send at least one copy of a book it brings out to the library. But quite a few publishers, many of whom are unaware what the Act stipulates, do not send their books to the library.

 ?We have decided to implement the Act strictly and are planning to hold a seminar during the Book Fair to spread awareness among the publishers. The library will set up a stall at the fair, at which the seminars will be held. Our main targets are the small and medium publishers, who are mostly unaware of the Act,? Mandal said.

 Similar drives will be launched in other major cities in eastern India, too. ?Our team will visit Assam, Port Blair, Jharkhand and Bihar in the next few months to collect books and spread awareness about the requirements of the Act among the publishers there,? Mandal elaborated. 

 The Centre, he said, has asked the library authorities to be tough in implementing the Act in its golden jubilee year. ?We can punish any publisher for flouting the provisions. But the punishment is not at all rigorous. All the offender has to do is to pay a penalty of Rs 50 for each book it has failed to supply to the library. It?s natural that most publishers do not bother about the Act,? the director explained. 

 To cope with the rampant violation, the library authorities are planning to approach the Centre to make the penalty more stringent, so that the errant publishers really feel the pinch.

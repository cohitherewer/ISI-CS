The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You should be feeling much more confident about your prospects in life. 

Try to avoid sticking your nose into everything. Your positive attitude should 

help your romantic prospects. You are lucky in monetary affairs. Avoid hot temper. 

You have the capacity to fight adverse circumstances. You are not tactful though 

your intentions are always good. ? Kusum Bhandari

 A fire broke out at godown of raw materials for herbal products on Jheel Road, in Cossipore, on Tuesday. 

 Nine fire-tenders put out the blaze after an hour-and-a- half. Although the godown was gutted, there were no casualties, firemen said.

 Officials said the fire started at noon and was put out around 1.30 pm. Preliminary investigations revealed that it was set off by a short circuit.

 Police said there was a lot of inflammable goods stored in the godown. A case has been filed against the owner.

 A fire also broke out at a chemical factory on Benaras Road, in Howrah?s Salkia, on Tuesday evening. Four engines battled with the blaze for an hour to douse it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pension settlement in 60 days

 Nand Kishore, accountant-general (accounts amp; entitlement) met readers of The Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants included Md. Amiruzzaman, D. Ghosh, Santanu Bhattacharjee, Ranajit Basu, Pranabesh Das and Sanjana Basu

D.Ghosh : Which are the areas your department 

looks after?

We look after the pensions of all gazetted officers 

in ranks of IAS and IPS of state cadre, judges of the courts, school (secondary 

and higher-secondary) and college teachers and members of the non-teaching staff. 

We also deal with the pensionary files of political sufferers and gallantry award-winners. 

Nearly 6,000 offices forward their pension cases to us.

Ranajit Basu: How many cases do you handle annually 

and how many of them are pending?

We had handled around 30, 904 cases in 2003-2004 and 

135,833 in 2000-01. The number rises greatly when the government issues any order 

to implement recommendations relating to pension fund (PF). 

 We regularly remind all our pension-sanctioning offices to submit their cases in time. We are also awake to the need of those who are in dire need of money following retirement from service. 

We have set a deadline of two months for processing 

a case and forwarding it to the treasury. 

Ranajit Basu: Often, there are complaints that 

many cases are pending in your office.

 We process the cases of around 3.54 lakh PF account-holders. 

At present, we have only 3,196 disputed cases. Of these, 1,142 are being held 

up for over a year. 

Most of these cases are pending because either the 

documents, such as successor certificates, had not been submitted or the sanctioning 

authorities had not applied their mind while forwarding the cases to us.

D. Ghosh: What steps are you taking to solve the 

disputed cases? 

 We are trying our best. In fact, where there are nominal lacunae in furnishing the documents, officials are asked to take the initiative to verify them. But as many cases are in court, we are helpless. 

We now sit once a month with the disputed cases and 

try to work our way around. The process has started bearing fruit. 

Md. Amiruzzaman: Why are many pension cases held 

up though the pensioners had submitted all the required documents? 

 We generally hold back the papers when it comes to our notice that the service record of the person is imperfect, or if there is a rider in his record. In that case, we ask for a clarification from the department concerned, and after getting the green signal, we release the pension file. 

 In some cases, legal battles over succession force us to hold back the payment. Ad-hoc appointments, too, are responsible for delayed payment.

In most cases, we are held responsible for the delays 

caused by other departments.

Santanu Bhattacharjee: How can one trace the current 

position of his file? 

 To facilitate the search, we are introducing a slew of interactive systems. We are strengthening our existing Pension Facilitation Cell (PFC) so it can respond immediately to most queries from the pensioners.

 Here, one has to come with valid documents for collecting the pension. He can know the status of his file from the PF cell, located on the ground floor of our office. 

 If theres any problem, the pensioner is informed about it and asked to take up the matter with the official concerned. Though we try to provide prompt information, sometimes it takes a while to find the file, as we are yet to computerise the entire system. In that case, we request the person to submit his queries in the early hours of any working day, and we provide the information later in the day.

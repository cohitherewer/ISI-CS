 Cop talk on puja at library

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Officers of Alipore police station have invited the National Library director and the secretary of the National Library Staff Association to a meeting on Saturday, which will discuss safety measures taken by a number of Puja committees and other related issues. 

 The meeting assumes significance for the National Library Staff Quarters Puja Committee, as it has been debarred from holding a puja on the campus this year.

 A.K. Halder, library administrative officer, has informed Alipore police station about the authorities? decision. 

 On Thursday, several members of the committee had gheraoed library director Subhendu Mandal, to protest the decision. They were demanding that the authorities reconsider their stand and allow the employees to organise a puja on the campus, as in previous years.

 Director Mandal, however, refused to budge from his position. Instead, he asked the library?s security officer to keep a close watch on the activities of the Puja committee members. 

 His argument for not allowing a puja on the campus: ?The Library remains open on Puja days. If the festivity is allowed on the campus, readers will be disturbed.? 

 Members of the Puja committee are, however, determined to organise a Durga puja this year, too, but on a small scale. 

 ?We will ensure that the scholars are not disturbed by the Puja,? said a member.

 Sleuths net woman link

 - Clinic registers were tampered with to cover up abortion tryst

 OUR BUREAU

 A week after the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had suggested that the Susil Pal murder case was solved and sealed, a key accused was arrested late on Sunday.

 Piyali Das, the woman whose baby the gynaecologist had allegedly refused to abort on July 2, was produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Howrah and remanded in jail custody till November 22, along with her 15-day-old male child.

 Das was arrested on charges of murder, criminal conspiracy, and contributing to disappearance of evidence of offence. On Sunday night, CID sleuths zeroed in on Piyali?s Entally residence, where she had put up after leaving Bally.

 Investigators believe the arrest has brought them a step closer to unravelling the murder mystery that has taken them from Calcutta to Bally, Konnagar and Uttarpara.

 ?We had approached Piyali on several occasions to give out information, but she had refused to cooperate. We had even requested her to come to Bhabani Bhavan, but she didn?t. Besides, she had even misled the sleuths with incorrect information,? said R.K. Mohanty, additional director-general of police (CID).

 Sleuths maintained they had found documentary evidence to suggest that Piyali had conspired with Bally CPM zonal committee member Biswajyoti Basu to tamper with the attendance register at the Sebayatan Nursing Home, Bally, where Pal had examined her, and also at Matri Sadan, the Bally municipality maternity home.

 The tampering was done, sleuths believe, to establish that Piyali was present at Matri Sadan, and not at Sebayatan, on the day of the murder.

 Piyali then was five months and 20 days pregnant. After Pal refused to abort ? and apparently suffered the consequences -? she delivered a male child in a Shyambazar nursing home.

 While Piyali has so far maintained that the child has no congenital defect, sleuths claim to have documents revealing otherwise. 

 Even Basu was aware of it when he invited Pal to Sebayatan, sleuths added.

 Another accused in the murder case, Biswanath Kangshabanik, has prayed that he would like to make a confession before the court.

 The prayer of the Sebayatan staff member, who has provided sleuths with all the vital leads, has been submitted to the court officials.

Brisk binge for busy brigade 

Plan a Party

Himika Chaudhuri finds a short-cut 

for some impromptu fun after slog hours

An impromptu office party is the ultimate luxury for 

those slogging it out, 24x7. With their erratic (read: never-ending) job hours, 

they hardly ever find the time to actually plan a proper party weeks or days in 

advance like normal people do. A few hours at best is what these slaves get to 

set up a binge and have their share of fun before getting back to work within 

a few hours. So, this is by all means the best test of one?s capacity to organise 

a party without planning it. Finishing work a few hours before schedule, remembering 

the boss?s birthday all of a sudden or just the will to strip a colleague of some 

cash could be reasons enough for this sudden desire to party.

The den

You need to fix the venue first. It?s easiest to hop 

over to a colleague?s place, preferably a bachelor who wouldn?t mind the mess 

and the noise. A house with a terrace is the ideal option (though not during these 

drizzling evenings) but a cosy drawing room can do as well for a smallish group. 

Allow the host for the evening to leave office a little earlier than the rest 

so that he gets time to put the basic amenities (glasses, ice, plates, napkins, 

etc) in place.

Cash call

For the food, booze and everything else in between, 

the first thing you need to check is the fund facts of the team. So, the ATM card-owners 

in the group need to play Good Samaritan and cough up the cash. While credit cards 

may help you out on the food front, for the liquid diet you need to dish out the 

green notes on the spot.

On the menu

Ever seen an office team of teetotallers? So, buying 

the booze invariably tops the things-to-do list. Food can still be picked up as 

late as 10 in the night, it?s the off-shops that need to be invaded before the 

shutters are downed. Get your rum ? and whisky, and vodka and whatever else ? 

radar right and rush.

The food is the next thing on the list because a hungry 

party is never fun. Something easy to carry and serve is what one should opt for. 

Packets of Biryani and Chicken Bharta and roti with some kebabs for snacks 

are the safest (read cheapest) bets. All one needs to do is count the number of 

mouths and order the same number of packets of Biryani and half the number of 

plates of Chicken Bharta. Call up eateries with home-delivery facilities to avoid 

the hassle of wasting precious time picking up the grub. If you decide on the 

food after the dial-ins have retired for the night, make do with dhabas 

like Azad Hind, Honey Da or Sharma?s.

Fashion facts

Division of labour is the key to a party well begun 

? the guys can sweat it out at the booze store and the food stop while the girls 

can snatch those precious minutes to doll-up in the office loo. This is the right 

time to rob the fashion freak of the department off her expensive make-up items. 

Use her lipstick and eye colours along with a bronzer and blush-on to brighten 

up and get into the party groove. Since you can?t do a damn thing about the office 

attire you?re saddled with, try to jazz up your look with accessories like a scarf, 

a pair of danglers or a heavy neckpiece (if you are lucky enough to have any one 

of these in your handbag). And add a casual but sexy touch ? pull out that shirt, 

unbutton that top button and get ready to rock.

Count the wheels

Now that you look good and feel great, the next thing 

is to actually get to the venue. Public transport is hardly the choice for a large 

group, and that too, when you are dying to start the fun. Count the number of 

cars that you have between yourselves and then call the Blue Arrow taxi service 

to fill in the blank.

Music mantra

You have almost everything in place now, expect for 

the music, which is vital to the way the party will go. If the host has a music 

system, then there isn?t much to worry about. But if he?s the bookworm type and 

doesn?t have much time for tunes, you have yet another task in hand ? to pick 

up a music system from another colleague?s house.

Finish off

When you?ve had a few pegs, the food and enough of 

each other in the small room, head straight for a nightclub to complete the circle 

of fun, chill out till the wee hours and don?t forget the parting line: ?See you 

in a few hours, guys.?

 Banking on fusion notes

After 

money matters year round, it was time for some music. On Wednesday night, Standard 

Chartered?s priority customers were treated to Cirque Selecte, a fusion performance 

that proved an evening well spent.

 Ustad Sabir Khan, Taufiq Qureshi and Amaan Ali Bangash captivated an audience with a fusion retelling of classical ragas. The sarod, tabla and drums merged seamlessly in a creative and spontaneous performance that not only drew enthusiastic applause from the audience but a few whistles too. After the four pieces, Qureshi regaled the room with his vocal percussion. ?Husband and wife fighting? is how he described a hilarious composition alternating high and low pitched noises that truly brought a marital spat to the poised platform.

 The evening, hosted at ITC Sonar Bangla, started with a wine-and-cheese round to help guests unwind. The select bash is the bank?s annual event for high net worth customers. ?The evening is strictly no business, to create a lifestyle space for our key clients,? explains Anindya Paulchaudhuri, cluster head, senior customer relationship manager, Standard Chartered.

 Wealth isn?t passport enough to get through the Cirque Selecte gates. ?It is about wealth, stature and a certain kind of mindset,? stresses Paulchaudhuri. However, with a bustling calendar, there are events enough to go around.

Arabian aura

 The smoke rings inside Shisha, the first hookah bar in the city, are growing thicker by the night. The first hookah festival in its one-and-a-half years kicked off last weekend with an Arabian Nights mood to match. It took a while for regulars to recognise their favourite stewards covered from head to toe in traditional Arab attire as they welcomed them in with piping hot kehwa or Arabian tea.

 Arabian music set the mood for endless puffs on flavoured hookahs. While Daiquiri Hookah, Pina Colada Hookah, Rum ?? Cola Hookah and Vodka Hookah flowed freely, along with options like Strawberry Milk Hookah, Caramel Milk Hookah, Rose Milk Hookah and even Cappuccino Hookah. Props like aromatic candles accentuated the magical feeling. ?Candles are typical of a lounge in any Arab country,? said manager Sovon Mukherjee.

 The hookahs at the festival, which will be on till Christmas Eve, cost Rs 250 per helping.

 Melody mix

 Pub-crawlers looking for some soulful music to take a break from rock roll can chill out at their own pace at The Junction. Keeping you company in the popular Taj Bengal bar will be the E amp;M Duet from Philippines comprising Elmer Grino on keyboards and guitar and vocalist Mayshel. Golden oldies apart, a good amount of jazz, R amp;B, hip-hop, country and pop features in their repertoire.

 ?I have travelled all over the world and been in some of the best bars. So my performance has a perfect mix of all that ,? said Elmer. ?I am a great fan of Celine Dion and Whitney Houston. So one can expect some of their songs too,? piped up Mayshel. The music is also good for early night warm up before you hit more thumping zones as the duo, in town till February, starts pretty early at 8.30 pm.

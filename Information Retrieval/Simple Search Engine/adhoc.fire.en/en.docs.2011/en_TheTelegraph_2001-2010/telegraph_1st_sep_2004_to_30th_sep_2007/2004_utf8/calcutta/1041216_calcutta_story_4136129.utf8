 Santa Claus may be doing the rounds in 10 days, but he paid an early visit to the Cakes outlet in Salt Lake last week, the newest cake shop chain in the city, when he decided to sample their Christmas special yummies.

 In a horse drawn carriage laden with everything from fruitcake to eclairs he took some kids and model Priyanka on a ride around the township. 

 In keeping with the mood of celebration, some special entertainment has been kept in stock for the little guests who visit the store. ?At both the Rawdon Street and Salt Lake outlets, we?ll have magicians, ventriloquists, painters and mime artists to entertain them between 4 pm and 5 pm everyday,? says Santanu Guha Thakurta, owner of the FC Block outlet. Besides the traditional Christmas cake, sweet delights come in shapes of Santa, Christmas logs and Christmas trees. Iced cakes, cookies, Dundee cakes and mince pies are also available. The high point of the Yuletide special, however, is the Tuna Eclairs. 

Cake craving

 It?s time to binge on the chocolates and cakes without worry about the increasing girth. And La Patisserie is making it that much easier, with a tempting new menu. If you decide to stick to your resolve during the festivities, the Taj Bengal cake shop has included a host of sugar-free goodies. ?The most interesting item in this section is the chocolate pastry which, despite being made wholly of chocolate, is sugar-free,? said chef Pratik Roy, in charge of the confectionery and bakery. Even the breads are low-fat. ?People now prefer brown flour mixed with seeds of various plants like sunflower. We have a dozen different kinds of low-fat breads,? adds the chef.

 For those who want to indulge in the sinful goodies in their sugary form, the traditional Black Forest, Chocolate Passionate and Del Ray cakes besides a host a pastries, pies and chocolates, are on offer. ?We?ve begun to sell the cakes by the slice so those with small families can enjoy them,? explains Roy. In the savouries and sandwiches section, anything from a Thai Chicken Pai to Hopping John Footlong, a Chicken Mustard Strudel to the veggies, is priced between Rs 25 and Rs 45.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Winter menu, summer cost

 A STAFF REPORTER

 At a time when common or garden vegetables are priced beyond the reach of most, there is a strong possibility of cauliflower, cabbage and tomato being available in the markets not just the whole year round, but at reasonable rates, too. The same holds for fruits such as apples, pears and apricots.

 With the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government keen on turning such a possibility into reality, the West Bengal State Food Processing amp; Horticulture Development Corporation has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Himachal Pradesh Agriculture Produce Marketing Corporation, which will enable both states to buy and sell more fruits and vegetables from each other.

 State food processing corporation managing director N. Hazra said on Friday that the recent MoU signed in Shimla between representatives of the two organisations will make many fruits and vegetables available throughout the year in the state. 

 Tomatoes are grown in abundance in Bengal, especially on the city?s fringes like South 24-Parganas, as well as in north Bengal. Mangoes are grown aplenty. But a large quantity of this produce is wasted every year owing to lack of proper marketing. Farmers do not get the right price for tomatoes and the vegetables go waste. This is how the MoU will also benefit farmers, Hazra added.

 ?While vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower, onion, brinjal, okra and tomato, among others, grow best in winter in West Bengal, in Himachal Pradesh, these are best grown in summer. We can arrange for a supply of vegetables to each other accordingly,? Hazra elaborated.

 ?It is not that winter vegetables are not available in the city or elsewhere these days. But everyone cannot afford them round the year. Once supplies are abundant, most people will be able to buy cabbage, cauliflower and tomatoes, whatever the season. This may even bring a sea-change in the menu,? another official said.

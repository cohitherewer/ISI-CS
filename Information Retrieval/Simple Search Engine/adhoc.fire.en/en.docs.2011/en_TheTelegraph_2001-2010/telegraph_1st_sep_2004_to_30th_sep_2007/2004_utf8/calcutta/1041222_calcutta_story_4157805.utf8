 Order goes up in smoke

 - Cigarettes puffed unchecked in high court corridors 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 The day after Calcutta High Court issued a circular saying smokers on its premises would be fined, a number of lawyers, litigants, court officers, law clerks and even the vendors were coolly puffing away in the corridors on Tuesday.

 On Monday, Raghunath Roy, high court registrar (administration), on the basis of a lawyer?s prayer, issued a circular slapping a spot fine of Rs 1,000 on people smoking on the court premises. 

 Lawyer Tapas Bhanja told the registrar in his plea that after the Supreme Court directive, the high court cannot allow any person to smoke on the premises. A few years ago, the Supreme Court had banned smoking in public places.

 ?A ruling cannot instantly change a person?s habit. Unless the public is aware of the consequences of smoking, it is a very difficult task to check smoking inside the court,? pointed out advocate Kallol Guha Thakurta. 

 The advocate had himself moved a public interest litigation three years ago, seeking an order prohibiting smoking in court.

 Another high court lawyer said: ?I did not smoke a single cigarette till 2 pm, but when I found people still smoking in the corridors, I joined them.?

 He said there were some lacunae in the high court order. 

 ?What steps will the authorities take against smokers who refuse to pay the fine?? he asked. He said it is a very difficult task to impose such a rule in a domain of advocates.

 Reacting sharply to the lawyers? indifference to the circular, lawyer Bhanja said: ?It is very unfortunate that the high court has failed to stop smoking inside the court building. I went to the registrar (administration) during the day, but found that he was not interested in enforcing the rule.? 

 He said the registrar (general) of the court had asked the registrar (administration) to hand over to him all the relevant documents with regard to Monday?s circular.

 Asked whether there was any truth in Bhanja?s charge, the registrar (administration) denied comment. 

 Smoking inside the bar association rooms of the court is strictly prohibited.

 ?Lawyers are not allowed to smoke in the association rooms. Now, it is quite impossible for a lawyer, who smokes, to step out of the court building every time he wants a puff,? said an advocate.

 ?There should be a smoking zone demarcated on every floor of the building before enforcing the rule,? suggested an advocate who smokes. 

 He added: ?It is impossible for me to work all day without smoking.?

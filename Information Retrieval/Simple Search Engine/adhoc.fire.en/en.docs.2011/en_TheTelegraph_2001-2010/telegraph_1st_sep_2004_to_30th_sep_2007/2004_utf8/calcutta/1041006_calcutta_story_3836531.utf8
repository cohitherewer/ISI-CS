 Cancer risk scales tip for morbidly obese

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SANJAY MANDAL 

 Not just overweight persons, experts, too, are worried over the rise in the count of morbidly obese persons in the city.

 Morbid obesity is a chronic disease caused by excessive storage of fat in the body, resulting in acute physical and psychological problems. Experts say the morbidly obese account for over 30 per cent of all adults in Calcutta.

 Also, every 15th student is turning obese and shows a tendency to develop morbid obesity at a later age.

 ?This life-threatening disease is caused when a person attains twice the weight of an overweight person. Excess weight is calculated by measuring the body mass index, which is a combination of weight and height of an overweight person,? explained V.K. Bhartia, surgeon at the AMRI Hospitals. 

 In the calculation, the weight is divided by the height to obtain the body mass index (BMI). Any BMI reading above 30 kg/m2 (obese) is considered morbid obesity in Indian conditions.

 Statistics available with the health department and city doctors shows that over 14 per cent women above 40 suffer from excessive weight problems, a condition that the World Health Organisation has placed on the list of top 10 killer diseases.

 In India, experts count 40 to 50 million overweight in the upper middle class alone, where food habits and unhealthy lifestyles cause diseases like gall stones, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteo-arthritis and cancer of the cervix, prostrate, breast, colon and ovaries.

 For every 100 patients coming for gall bladder surgery, 30 are morbidly obese, a rather new phenomenon, said D.J. Bhaumik, a laparoscopic and general surgeon. 

 ?The surgery textbook says the 5 Fs (fair, fat, fertile, female and above 40) are potential cases of gall bladder surgery. But now, we see more obese persons turning up than the others,? said Bhaumik.

 City-based oncologists say that contrary to the popular theory about malnutrition leading to cancer in Bengal, more overweight persons are succumbing to cancer. The highest count is cancer of the breast, among females living in Calcutta, followed by cancer of the cervix.

 ?Since in overweight persons, the oestrogen secretion is more, chances of developing breast cancer rises dramatically. This is precisely the reason why we have been asking women in the city to get slimmer to avoid cancer,? says oncologist Subir Ganguly.

 This apart, cases of colon and uterine cancer among women have also increased in the past few years, with fewer persons working out and more eating junk food, resulting in fatty deposits.

 Worried over the rising trend, city hospitals are introducing an advanced treatment for morbid obesity. AMRI Hospitals have come up with a morbid obesity clinic, with facilities of bariatric surgery and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. A Lap Band (a silicon ring) is placed around the stomach near its upper end to constrict the stomach and reduce its volume.

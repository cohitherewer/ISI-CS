 Chinese and Mughlai masala mix

 As city eateries vie with one another to dish out a Mughlai mania after getting over their hilsa high, The Astor is stepping slightly off the tried-and-tested taste trail.

 Keeping up with a kebab festival at its resto bar, Cloud 9, the Shakespeare Sarani hotel is offering a brand new lunch buffet menu in its Chinese section at just Rs 195 per appetite.

 One gets to start off with a cream and corn soup before moving on to the main course. Pop picks from the non-veg platter include butter peanut chicken and pan-fried chilli fish, while the vegetarian faves are Chinese mixed vegetables and garlic and Szechwan sauce flavoured vegetables. These are best accompanied by Singapore noodles or vegetarian fried noodles. The month-long promotion offers a beer or coke on the house.

 To try the tested flavours of the season, peep into Cloud 9 for the kebabs on offer. Ones with a fish fetish can choose from boneless preparations like Achari Fish Tikka and Mallika-e-Dareya cooked in pickle masala, yoghurt and cheese.

 For meat hunters there?s the Lucknowi Seekh Kebab and Adraki Panja and for champions of chicken, Murg Chakori Kebab, Murg Firdous and Murg Hajari Kebab are a few options here. 

 For vegetarians, Rajma Galauti Kebab (minced rajma flavoured with chef?s secret spices) and Rangi Stuffed Paneer (two types of stuffed paneer cubes grilled on charcoal) are the obvious choices.

 The platter price: Rs 175 to Rs 215.

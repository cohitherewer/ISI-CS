 Masti: Marriage blues 

 Masti 

 Another box-office bonanza from the makers of Dil, Beta and Ishq. It is about three friends who are not averse to some fun outside marriage. But very soon they realise that their masti mission is backfiring. This sex comedy stars the young lot led by Vivek Oberoi, Aftab Shivdasani and Ritesh Deshmukh. Lara Dutta chips in with a delightful item number.

 Catch it on Sony on October 10 at 8 pm

 Why bother Chills, thrills and spills, the movie had it all. If the one-liners stole the show, Ajay Devgan in a cameo did the star turn. The movie marked Indra Kumar?s first hit after years.

Shaadi...: Wedlock 

 Shaadi Ka Laddoo

 Story of two friends with their fair share of problems. One is married and the other wants to be. This second directorial venture of Raj Kaushal featured wife Mandira, the restrained Sanjay Suri and newcomer Ashish Chaudhuri.

 Catch it on Zee Cinema on October 16

 Why bother The high point of the movie is the first lady of Indian cricket, Madame Mandira. But even she could not save the sagging fortunes of the film. The only benefactor was the item girl Nigar Khan, who sizzled in Chal hat.

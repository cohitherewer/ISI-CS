 What is common to Raja Chowdhury in Mr amp; Mrs Iyer, Aman Kapoor in Chameli and Karan in White Noise? The three add up to Rahul Bose?s self-confessed trilogy of portraying a passive male opposite an active woman. ?You can also call it a quietude, a state of being which masks a whole lot of turbulence inside,? says the writer-actor-director, who also happens to be India?s rugby captain.

 In town as guest of honour at a television channel prize distribution, Rahul is all excited about his forthcoming acting assignments. ?The films are Idol and Whisperers directed by my friends Sumeet Chopra and Rajiv Virani. I have also written the scripts for both the films. The stories are not mine, but they came and twisted my arm and I had to write the screenplays.?

 Rahul always knew that he would be one of the two protagonists in the dark psychological thriller Whisperers, but he didn?t know that he would end up playing the lead role of the Hong Kong DJ in Chopra?s Idol. ?In fact, I had suggested two other famous actors for the role but he came back to me and I had to do it. The character of the deejay is very dissipating and indisciplined. He is into a whole lot of sex and drugs and yet mixes music every night. There are a lot of seismic shots of his life being hurtled to disaster.?

 While Rahul is yet to shoot for these two films, his most recent venture, Vinta Nanda?s White Noise, is ready for release. ?It is the first film to be set in the TV industry and Vinta, having worked extensively for the small screen, was the best equipped to handle it. The film revolves around the making and airing of a Kyunkii? type serial, Pavitra Aarti. I play this wannabe film-maker who chucks his job in the IT sector to make films like Fellini. He ends up editing this serial, which is going down the TRP ratings. Koel Purie, who played the female lead in my directorial debut Everybody Says I?m Fine, is the new writer of the serial. There is a conflict between us and then the self-healing of both the characters. If there is a love angle at all, it begins at the end of the film.?

 As for his own directorial venture, Rahul has hit a writer?s block. ?It is definitely proving to be tougher to write than I had imagined. It is a love story about two people, who never meet or touch each other physically. They see each other and choose to play out the relationship in their minds. It is very surreal and will be shot in the US, since the social construct has to be a first-world country. All I can say is that it will be infinitely stranger than Everybody Says??

 Ever since he slipped in behind the camera, Rahul has become more of a director?s actor. ?I have definitely become a more co-operative and empathetic actor because now I know the pressures of being a director. But that?s off the sets. On the sets, there are times I feel certain things can be done differently. If the director is collaborative I give my opinions and if he is not I keep mum. After all, as actors we are just supposed to help realise the director?s vision.?

 Rahul, who was featured in Time magazine as ?a thinking actor-director? from India, had to turn down Ismail Merchant?s Heights, where he was slated to appear opposite Glenn Close. ?Ismail called me up and said that the film had become much smaller than it was conceived and that I shouldn?t be doing it. I told him, ?Of course I am not doing it?. Now the film has got made with a different cast.?

 His reasons for turning down a host of other films were different, though. ?After Jhankaar Beats, I was offered two films just like that. For the first 30 seconds, I was thinking about the Rs 50-60 lakh that would be added to my bank balance but the 31st second onwards, the fantasy died. I don?t want to repeat myself --- I wouldn?t like to flash the same smile or look. I was also offered three Bengali films; they were all crap. Then there were two films from New York that weren?t exciting either. I can?t loosen my parameters for a Hollywood film. They are not even the best around. I prefer the Wong Kar-wais and Inarritus any day.?

 But he does like an American named Quentin Tarantino, whom he bumped into at a film festival. ?I met him fortuitously. He is not at all aggressive, as his films make him out to be. He is very cool. Quentin told me, ?You guys ripped off my Reservoir Dogs, which I had ripped off from a Hong Kong film. Now if some Hong Kong guys rips off your film, it will become a full circle?. He also didn?t look down on me as an Indian. We both knew the kind of struggles and ecstasies we had gone through to make our films and that both our films were up there. It was like one film-maker meeting another.?

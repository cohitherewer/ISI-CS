The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Quality time with bees amp; bugs

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 For 21-year-old Jaspinder Singh, life has, of late, been any thing but a bed of roses. But he doesn?t seem to mind. On the contrary, he?s elated. 

 From clearing an obstacle race, to spending time in a tank full of cockroaches, and then turning into a living beehive by allowing two kg of these winged honey-making creatures to settle on his body for an hour, the city boy has done it all and come up trumps.

 Participating in AXN Xtreme ? the original production show that requires participants to do bizarre things and win, India met Pakistan on a different turf earlier this month, where India garnered more points.

 ?All the rounds were gruelling and difficult, but we somehow managed to pull it off, beating our Pakistani counterparts,? said Jaspinder, who cleared all the preliminary rounds in style and travelled to Taiwan to participate in the mega finals.

 To begin with, the AXN Xtreme team carried out the qualifying rounds in Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi in August, where over 500 contestants vied for one top spot from the four metros to take on an equal number of participants from Pakistan.

 The qualifying rounds saw Jaspinder, along with hundreds of other contestants, participate in three gruelling rounds.

 In round I, the contestants participated in a 200-m dash, and then slip into as many pullovers as possible within a short span of time. 

 The fastest 50, who had also put on the maximum number of pullovers, were selected for the second round.

 In the next two rounds, the participants had to cross an obstacle course, where they were further shortlisted to 20. The contestants then had to undergo a stress test and drink a tall glass of bitter gourd juice.

 ?The most horrifying act was when we were asked to jump into a tank full of cockroaches and remove nuts and bolts that were strewn all over the place. This was certainly tough, because the cockroaches tended to climb all over your body,? recalled Jaspinder.

 Several weeks later, the good news finally reached Jaspinder?s father, Rashpaal, who has a transport business in the city. 

 ?I was overjoyed to learn that I will travel to Taiwan to take on Pakistani youths,? recalled the commerce graduate, who has won the Mr Calcutta contest in 2000. 

 But taking part in a model hunt was one thing and climbing a 10-storeyed building to get hold of some flags from the top was another, agreed Jaspinder. 

 For eight days, starting November 27, the Calcutta boy and his teammates took part in several gruelling rounds of sport. 

 ?What we won was an adventure of a lifetime. I still remember carrying all the bees on my body for so long. I got very nervous at one point,? he added.

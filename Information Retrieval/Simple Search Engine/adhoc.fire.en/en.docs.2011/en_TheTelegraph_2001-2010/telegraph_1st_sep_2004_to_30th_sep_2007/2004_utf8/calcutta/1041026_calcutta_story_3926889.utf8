 Crafting the Devi: The idol at the Hatkhola 

Gosaipara Sarbojanin Puja was based on the works of artist Ramananda Bandopadhyay.

As one crossed Bijan Setu, (better known as the Ballygunge 

bridge) there were some of Calcutta?s most famous pujas in Kasba which have made 

headlines over the past few years. But this year, there was something special 

in store at a lesser-known puja in Kasba ? the first puja on the left immediately 

after crossing the Setu. The theme of the pandal of Kasba Uttarpara Aurobindo 

Sporting Club was devised by Kaushik Pal, a Class IX student of Ballygunge Jagabandhu 

Institution. 

 It was the sculpture of the Sena and Pal periods which he saw at the Indian Museum that inspired Kaushik. And with Durga puja around the corner, he approached the puja committee with his idea and they accepted it. 

 Over the past three months, 12 men at the Government Art Hostel in Girish Park had worked hard to give shape to Kaushik?s idea ? ?I call all of them dada?. Kaushik himself had to go there almost every day to assist them. 

 ?I had to manage time in-between as my half-yearly exams ended just before the Pujas,? says Kaushik. He had to work very hard as the process involved a lot of sweat, toil and patience ? first the sketch was drawn on the thermocol, which was then cut accordingly. Then, the plaster of Paris was used and finally the terracotta colour of pora mati was spray painted on the model. The entire thing cost approximately Rs 50,000. 

 Kaushik?s interest in art was born at a very young age, and he learnt wood-carving in school. He has also studied art. In 2002, Kaushik ranked 21 from amongst 50 students selected all over the state through a district-wise inter-school painting competition. He is very keen to take it up as a profession, especially after receiving appreciation from people this year.

 ?I felt great, when people came up to me and congratulated me for my work and also gave me suggestions,? he smiles.

Deity with a difference

 The Pujas came and went, with a touch of something unique at more than one pandal. Kedar Ghosh, a commerce student in his 20s, had no formal art training but his love for the goddess Durga saw him make an idol of her for a puja pandal. Kedar created something special for the Kshetra Milani Puja in Shibpur ? an idol made of paper, paddy, pulses, cinnamon, cotton, red pepper, wheat and flattened rice. 

 The theme was ?Devi: A soul called mother ? woman of our society?. Indeed, mother and motherland are greater than heaven itself, but women have been deprived of human rights in civilised society. Thanks to some revolutionary reformers, women are emerging self-reliant and armed with education. 

 This image was visualised as the Devi with 100 hands, emphasising that no society can progress without recognition of the contributions of women. The present situation of women in our society inspired Kedar ? crimes against women, physical and mental torture and dowry deaths. Kedar also made images of Lakshmi and Saraswati. He used paddy plants, signifying food, to create Lakshmi, while the Saraswati idol depicted the need for mass education.

Working together

 The South Asian Mid-term review (MTR) of the Yokohama Global Commitment 2001 was held at Taj Samudra, Colombo, Sri Lanka from September 29 to October 1. The event was hosted by the government of Sri Lanka, UN agencies, ECPAT International, Save the Children and other members of the South Asia Coordinating group for combating Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC). A consultation was held from September 27 to 28 for children of South Asia to come up with recommendations for the governments of South Asian countries. As a volunteer for the NGO Sanlaap, and the Asia youth representative of ECPAT International, I was invited to be a youth facilitator. 

 After clearing the emigration obstacles (thanks to not having an ?Emigration Check Not Required? stamp on my passport for the trip to Sri Lanka), I was finally able to reach Colombo on September 27. Though I was delayed for the consultation, MYCO youth facilitators ? Rusiru Abeysinghe from Sri Lanka, Emmen Saeed from Pakistan and Ravi Karkara from Save the Children ? were already on their toes during the workshop. 

 While Emmen is an experienced youth facilitator, Rusiru and I were participants at the last South Asia Children Consultation held in Kathmandu last year. Twenty-four children and young people from Afganistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Maldives and Sri Lanka participated in the workshop-based consultation, which was in preparation for the MTR.

 The two-day workshop comprising introductory sessions, sensitisation on child rights and other global commitments made by governments around the world were part of day one. Day two primarily focused on recommendations from children and young people from the region to end sexual exploitation of children. Two groups were made, one creating the media statement (facilitated by Rusi and myself) and the other was the drafting committee of the young people recommendations (facilitated by Ravi and Emmen). 

 We spent most of our time reviewing and creating the essential documents which the various government delegations could refer to while creating their plan of action in fulfiling the commitments made at the Yokohama Second World Congress. On September 29, the MTR began with dignitaries from the coordinating group addressing the inaugural session. The children and young adults presented their recommendations to the government delegations headed by ministers and secretaries.

 The president of Sri Lanka H.E. Chandrika Kumaratunga soon arrived to inaugurate the MTR. She addressed the delegates, emphasising the need for bilateral agreements between governments to stop CSEC, and the role of young people in it. She also gave a brief insight into Sri Lanka?s specific problems. After her speech, she spent time interacting with the young participants and commended them for their valuable recommendations.

 The heads of the delegations from different countries then took the podium to present their respective reports on the promises they have been able to keep and the ones they couldn?t. Some governments, however, did not accept that CSEC prevailed in their country. The Indian government, though, declared signing the Optional Protocols of the Convention of Child Rights after about two years. 

 But the government had no specific answers on when the National Commission for Children would be formed or what its composition would be. Finally, it was time to take a break from the serious discussions. We went for a walk along the beach by the Galle Face, just opposite the venue, and then danced to our hearts? content at the young people?s bash at the hotel. 

 Day two began with panel discussions on new emerging issues like commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking of boys. A session on dissemination of information from the thematic discussions was chaired by Carmen Madrinan Atwood, executive director of ECPAT. It aimed at giving everyone an overview on the issues. 

 The country groups then went to work developing the plan of action, including at the regional level. A press conference was held in the evening where representatives from India and Pakistan announced the young people?s media release. 

 However, India is yet to sign on the MTR commitment. A technical meeting was slated for October 1, while all ECPAT group representatives were taken on a community development field visit by ECPAT Sri Lanka/ PEACE. This was followed by a South Asia ECPAT group meeting, which reviewed the MTR and tried to integrate youth participation within the ECPAT network.

 Counterpoint

 This is in response to ?Courageous Crusader? (October 8) in Young Metro. On October 12, Young Metro published ?Helping Hands?, where Pranaadhika Sinha clarifies her stand saying that Right Now Kolkata is different from Right Now. We would like to clarify that Right Now is a youth group registered in Kolkata and not in Pune as was reported and we have a standing of over four years in the social sector in India. We have chapters in Pune and Calcutta, referred to as Right Now Kolkata and Right Now Pune. Pranaadhika admits she was associated with Right Now previously. What we find difficult to digest is why she chose a similar name to form her group. The only reason we could assign to this is her intent to take advantage of reputation that Right Now has earned over the years. In the letter, she says that the two groups should ?take the issue seriously... rather than sidelining it with malicious attempts at slander?. Right Now?s work over the past four years bear testimony for our commitment to the issues that we address. But in the social sector we also believe in working in an ethical fashion by establishing best practices. We could?ve been appreciative of Pranaadhika?s work had she not engaged in an unethical act like this. We are seriously concerned about the deceptive use of our name.

On junior judges? trail

It?s an award where school kids put on the judge?s 

robes. That is what makes MP Birla Foundation Puja Utkarsh Samman stand out. This 

time, 24 of us ? 18 from South Point and six from MP Birla School ? underwent 

a workshop with researcher Purba Sengupta, sculptor Arunendu Banerjee and additional 

police commissioner Naparajit Mukherjee. Armed with the knowledge of our traditions 

and traffic rules, we set out on Sashti and Saptami. We had to mark the pujas 

on image, pandal and ambience. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed by the 

organisers who explained the theme, the speciality of idol and their social services. 

My friends and I, with teacher escorts, visited 25 pujas on the two days. In our 

view, the best idol was at Pathuriaghata Pancher Palli, the best pandal was Shib 

Mandir (picture left), while Suruchi Sangha had the best ambience.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lights, camera... but no action

 The Bachchans: Yet to be seen together; 

(Top) A scene from Shekhar Kapur?s Elizabeth: The one that got made 

 The year was 1967. In between the Goopy Gyne Bagha Bynes and Aranyer Din Ratris, Ray had taken time out to pen a script for an English film entitled The Alien. But the big American studios never forked out the funds needed for the ambitious venture. Fifteen years later, Steven Spielberg?s ET redefined film history.

 This Ray project was just one of the many Indian reel dreams that never became real. Over the years, there have been many Bollywood biggies, which were launched only to fizzle out in a hushed-up hustle. The fadeout reasons have been as varied as the plots ? producers backing out, directors moving on to new projects and sometimes just plain bad luck.

 There are a few film-makers though who take great pride in announcing projects without actually putting their plans on paper. Raj Kumar Santoshi launched AB Corp?s ?comeback film? Ranveer with elaborate fanfare promising to bring together baap and beta Bachchan together on screen for the first time. Last heard, the project is on the backburner, with the Big B not approving the script (in its fifth draft).

 Earlier, Santoshi?s much-touted Aamir Khan-Shah Rukh Khan starrer Rask didn?t quite take off. Aamir reportedly wanted Santoshi to do just one film at a time (like him) but that wasn?t possible for the Ghayal maker. It will take one Herculean effort to get the two Khans together now.

 Another Aamir film that never got made was Shekhar Kapur?s Time Machine. The project that would have pitched him opposite Rekha, Raveena Tandon and Naseeruddin Shah would have been Kapur?s take on the HG Wells novel. The maker of Elizabeth also aborted his youth film Ta Ra Rum Pum. Had that happened, the likes of Hrithik Roshan, Preity Zinta and Tanishaa would have made their debuts much earlier.

 In recent times, and closer home, Aparna Sen?s Gulel has run into roadblocks that, one hopes, are removed before the traffic lights turn red.

 Then Ram Gopal Varma discarded his ?mega international project? Ek. Varma found the theme of international terrorism politically incorrect at a time when the Indo-Pak bond was being strengthened. Had it been made, Ek, at a projected budget of Rs 80 crore, would have easily been the costliest Indian film ever made, with half of Bollywood.

 Ironically, the film that does have half of the film industry ? Anubhav Sinha?s Dus ? has the same name as that of one of the most ambitious Bollywood projects ever ?Mukul Anand?s Dus. He even shot a part of the film in Utah (resembling an out-of-bounds Kashmir) but his death meant the film never got completed.

ABORTION 

COUNT

Russian great Sergei Eisenstein could not finish Que Viva Mexico when his financier 

backed out

 Orson Welles could not finish his Don Quixote in the 30 years he shot it 

in Mexico, Spain and Italy

 MCA Studios did not support Alfred Hitchcocks Kaleidoscope because 

they found the serial killer protagonist too ugly

 MGM studios balked at the cost of Stanley Kubricks epic Napoleon 

that would have starred Jack Nicholson

While Varma has been able to start shooting for his Godfather-remake Sarkar, other directors like Mahesh Manjrekar and Vikram Bhatt couldn?t film their version of the Coppola classic. Even Anil Gadar Sharma had unveiled ? well, not quite ? his edition in 1989 with Dev Anand playing Brando. Sharma, of course, is known for abortions, having shelved the bilingual King, starring Mithun Chakraborty, and a Jaaved Jaaferi directorial project named Break Dancer.

 Currently in the city to shoot for Rituparno Ghosh?s Antarmahal, Abhishek Bachchan was slated to make his debut in two other films before J.P. Dutta?s Refugee. One was another Dutta project Aakhri Mughal, which was in fact Kamal Pakeezah Amrohi?s unfulfilled dream, which he had planned with the senior Bachchan. The other was friend Rakeysh Mehra?s light-hearted Indo-Pak drama Samjhauta Express, that could not stay on track.

 There were other interesting projects that could have changed the way Bollywood shaped up. Had Gulzar made a lyrical Devdas with Dharmendra, Hema Malini and Sharmila Tagore, would Bhansali have brought the Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay classic to the big screen the way he did? 

 Had Bachchan Senior done Subhash Ghai?s Devaa, we could have seen another winning combo in the Big B and the Big G. Had Dilip Kumar and Raakhee done Baghban years ago, Amitabh might not have been reinvented. Had Ketan Mehta directed his Mangal Pandey trilogy in 1996 with Sanjay Dutt, looking at Aamir Khan wouldn?t have been such a hair-raising experience.

 But then as the Sidhuism goes, ?If ifs and buts were like pots and pans, there would be no tinkers!?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 With the eastward expansion of the city, Park Circus station serves as the 

nearest railhead for people residing or working in the area. Though the number 

of commuters has increased over the years, there has been no improvement in the 

condition of the station premises. Many local trains do not halt at this station. 

Getting in or out of the station is a nightmare, as all the entrance/exit routes 

are obnoxiously dirty, encroached upon and prone to waterlogging during monsoon. 

Recyclable garbage, collected from the area, is sorted on the road running parallel 

to the railway track on the western side of the station ? right from the footbridge 

to the level-crossing. It blocks the road completely, forcing commuters to cross 

the tracks or walk along it. It would help passengers infinitely if that stretch 

is cleared, the newly-built ticket counters are made operational and more trains 

halt at the station.

 Recently, I noticed that all the silt and slime removed from a roadside drain 

had been heaped on the footpath adjacent to Sishu Mangal Hospital. A shower then 

washed the muck back into the drain. As a result, the opening of the drain got 

choked once again.

 Parking on the lanes and bylanes near Forum, on Elgin Road, has become an ordeal. 

Attendants managing the parking lot fleece private car-owners. They often ask 

for unreasonable parking fees (as much as Rs 20 for an hour on some occasions). 

On refusal, they threaten that they will not be responsible for theft of or damage 

to the vehicle. This practice is rampant especially late at night. The authorities 

need to take steps to make the areas near shopping malls safe for visitors during 

the festive season.

 Donald Shimoda, GC Avenue. 

 The streetlights on the stretch between Teghoria and the Haldiram confectionery 

complex are never lit. I request the authorities to ensure that the streetlights 

are switched on after dusk.

 R. Dugar, Raghunathpur. 

 During the Pujas, thousands of people go pandal-hopping at night. It will save 

them a lot of trouble if the pavements and roads are repaired now. The garbage 

vats should be cleared, at least in the festive season. Lots of tourists come 

to Calcutta during this time. Keeping the city clean will improve our image. 

 Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talks table for cable squabble

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government is stepping in to regulate the cable industry yet again. 

 On Wednesday, broadcasters and multi-system operators (MSOs) were informed of a meeting on October 15 at Calcutta Information Centre by principal secretary Arun Bhattacharya?s office. 

 Apart from regional representation, the country heads of the broadcasters have also been asked to attend.

 The additional secretary or deputy secretary will preside over the meeting, where issues such as dues disputes, under-declaration and framing of guidelines to regulate the cable industry are to be discussed. 

 The state may also ask broadcasters to refrain from switching off signals to MSOs or go for a price hike in the immediate future, keeping in mind the government?s intervention.

 The recent series of cable conflicts that has left viewers fuming is one of the main reasons for the meeting. 

 ESPN STAR Sports was switched off on MSO Manthan?s network during crucial Champions League matches. Earlier, a cable spat involving Zee Turner, RPG Netcom and SitiCable?s Calcutta Communication saw CPM mandarins get involved.

 Another trigger for the meeting was cable watchdog Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai)?s recent stress on more involvement from the state government in the cable industry.

 In Recommendations on Broadcasting and Distribution of TV Channels submitted to the Centre, Trai says: ?Any change in the system in a country as large and diverse as India must come after consultation with the state governments, as well as local stakeholders.?

 Trai adds: ?The cable act depends heavily on? state government officers. In other large countries like the USA, local authorities regulate the cable industry in terms of local functions, like fixing of rates for the basic tier.?

 Trai also laid down guidelines for broadcasters in case of switching off MSOs. These include a one-month notice and advertisements in newspapers.

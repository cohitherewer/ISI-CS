 Dreams die with Big B wannabe

 In life, Babulal Sharma dreamt of turning into Vijay. That was the reel name of Babulal?s role model Amitabh Bachchan in several films. 

 But in death, Babulal proved that he was a mere mortal, quite unlike his agile big-screen hero. 

 Unlike his guru Amitabh, whom no jail could hold back, the 27-year-old died inside the prison on Tuesday, allegedly after tripping and falling in the bathroom, his heart?s desires unfulfilled.

 ?He always dreamed of making it big in films. If not as a star, at least as a co-star or even an assistant. He used to get his kicks from the thought that his name would appear in the media and that film producers would seek him,? said Biswanath Mondal, Babulal?s neighbour, who had known him since childhood.

 It was this burning desire to become famous that led the son of a priest from Rajasthan to join the Amitabh Bachchan Fan Association in Dum Dum when it first started. 

 That was in 1999, when he first came in touch with S.P. Kamat, association president, and the man who led him to perdition. 

 The next year, Kamat created a sensation of sorts by organising a gurupuja on the occasion of guru purnima, in his attempt to deify Amitabh Bachchan. Babulal played a key role in this hero-worship, hoping that his name would somehow figure in different media reports. 

 It did. Both Kamat and Sharma hogged the limelight. That was the beginning of their end. 

 ?Babu?s father used to do the rounds of areas of Burrabazar then, working as family pandit in many households. Babu tagged along. Des-pite his busy schedule, Babu would squeeze out time to meet Kamat,? said Sanjit Roy, the man who has been with the priest-turned-fan for years. 

 During his days as an apprentice, the graduation drop-out from Manindra Chandra College started dreaming of becoming Bachchan. Babulal befriended Kamat and got sucked into politics. 

 Police records suggest that soon thereafter, Babulal came in contact with Sudhir Bhattacharya, the man who had ruled Dum Dum municipality as chairman for decades, and was gradually drawn into a conspiracy. 

 But he was not entirely sure about the details. 

 Months later, chairman Das was murdered, and following Kamat?s arrest, Babulal was rounded up from his house. 

 Police recovered a large amount of cash from Babulal?s Rajarhat residence and seized a mobile phone he had bought.

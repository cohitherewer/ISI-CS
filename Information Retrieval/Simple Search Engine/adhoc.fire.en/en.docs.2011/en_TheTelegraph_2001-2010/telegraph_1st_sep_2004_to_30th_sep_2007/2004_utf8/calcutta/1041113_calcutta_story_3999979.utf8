The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The Brando brand

 Much before he blazed the big screen with Elia Kazan?s A Streetcar Named Desire, Marlon Brando had shot to stardom as Stanley Kowalski on Broadway. For that, the young man from Illinois, trained in the Stanislavsky school of method acting, had sought out the role from none other than Tennessee Williams, driving up to Massachusetts where the playwright had been nestled for the summer. 

 From a rough and brutal youth of the 1950s to the ageing head of a Sicilian crime family, the tribute to Brando mounted at the 10th Kolkata Film Festival tries to capture some moments from the actor?s vast repertoire. 

 In association with the Calcutta Film Society and the department of media studies, Calcutta University, American Center has rolled out a bunch of five Brando films to be screened at Nandan. 

 The first to kick off the package on Thursday was Elia Kazan?s second venture with Brando, On the Waterfront. Based on Joseph Conrad?s novel The Heart of Darkness, the 1975 classic fetched Brando his first Academy Award for best actor. The film is scheduled for a repeat on Saturday at Nandan II at 9.15 am. The Friday fare featured A Streetcar named Desire, for which Brando won an Academy Award nomination as best actor in 1951. 

 Guys and Dolls, the 1955 classic where Brando pulls off a singing role under Joseph L. Mankiewicz?s direction, is slated for Sunday at Nandan II, 11.15 am.

 His second Academy Award-winning film The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, will be screened at Nandan III at 11.15 am on Monday, while Apocalypse Now gets underway on Tuesday at Nandan III at 11.15 am. 

 On the missing list are Sayonara, Viva Zapata (for which he bagged the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1952), The Young Lions and, of course, Bernardo Bertolucci?s Last Tango in Paris which boasts one of his most intensely personal performances. 

 But apart from the dedicated band of admirers, the Hollywood star had a memorable Calcutta connection ? he was interviewed by Satyajit Ray for Doordarshan on his visit to the city in the mid-1970s.

 The City Diary

 Architecture 

is not just for the elite and architects must strive to serve the common man, 

initiating dialogue with the end-user, Balbir Verma, president of Indian Institute 

of Architects (IIA), said on Sunday. Verma was inaugurating the exhibition on 

the sidelines of the 21st national convention of the IIA at Science City. The 

theme of Natcon 2004, being directly organised by the parent body, is Architecture, 

A Science An Art. ?The built environment for each living being in this country 

needs the services of a qualified architect and it is the duty of our profession 

to demonstrate that,? Verma added. he IIA president said West Bengal has been 

?a pioneer? in public-private partnerships in the housing sector and that Calcutta 

has ?progressed by leaps and bounds? over the past few years. More than 300 delegates 

are expected at the three-day summit (December 26-28). A convention of this magnitude 

helps raise awareness all around and provides an invaluable platform for local 

architects to interact with their counterparts elsewhere in the country. This 

exchange of ideas can only result in a better built environment for Calcutta,? 

hoped Mukul Mitra, convenor of the architects? meet. 

 Calcuttans, at last, are having a feel of winter. Met officials said on Sunday the minimum temperature is expected to dip in the city and its adjoining areas for the next couple of days as a cold wind from the north and north-west is blowing in unhindered. The minimum temperature on Sunday was 17.1 degrees Celsius. On Monday, it is likely to hover around 16 degrees Celsius. 

 The anti-cyclonic circulation which was bringing in moisture-laden warm air from the sea and blocking the North Wind has dissipated. The sky is clear and the North Wind is blowing again,? an officer said.

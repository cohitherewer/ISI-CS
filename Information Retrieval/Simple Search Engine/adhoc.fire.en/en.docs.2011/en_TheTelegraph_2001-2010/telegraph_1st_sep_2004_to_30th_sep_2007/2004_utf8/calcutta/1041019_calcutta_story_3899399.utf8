A tight security ring is being thrown in and around 

the city to ensure a peaceful Puja.

Policemen, from commandos to the Rapid Action Force, 

are all set to regulate the city?s traffic and pedestrian movement from Sashti 

evening till Navami night.?We are deploying 15,000 men in uniform, including traffic 

police, on the roads to ensure that revellers have a hassle-free Puja,? said Sanjoy 

Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

Mukherjee?s message to Calcuttans and people from 

the adjoining areas: ?Don?t be upset by traffic snarls on Monday and Tuesday. 

Our special Puja plan will start functioning from Saptami, and thereafter, everything 

will go smoothly.?

netted 881 professional criminals, including snatchers and pickpockets, and 280 

rowdies from different parts of the city. 

In Salt Lake, 20 eve-teasers were arrested in various 

spots, including in front of the swimming pool and City Centre. ?We have deployed 

policewomen to arrest road Romeos,? said Humayun Kabir, sub-divisional police 

officer, Salt Lake.

According to deputy commissioner Mukherjee, as part 

of the anti-sabotage measure, policemen armed with semi-automatic rifles will 

keep a close watch on all entry points, including Sealdah railway station and 

long-distance bus terminuses. 

?Officers of the special branch and the detective 

department have been alerted. They will carry hand-held metal detectors for spot-frisking,? 

he added.

During the festive days, 45 vehicles of the Radio 

Flying Squad and 12 vehicles of the High Radio Flying Squad will patrol the city. 

Fifteen police camps have been set up to assist revellers.

subscriptions. An extra effort to keep the Rashbehari Connector to the Bypass

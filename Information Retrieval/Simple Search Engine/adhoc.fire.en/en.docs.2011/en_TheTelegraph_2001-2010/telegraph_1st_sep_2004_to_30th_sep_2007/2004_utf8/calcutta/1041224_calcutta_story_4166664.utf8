 Calcutta High Court on Thursday set up a five-member committee to monitor the repair of roads, especially in the city. 

 The committee, consisting of five lawyers of the court, will have to submit regular reports on the status of progress in road repairs.

 A division bench, consisting of Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Asit Kumar Bishi, decided to set up the committee ?in the interest of the people?. The bench asked the five lawyers ? Milan Bhattacharya, Alok Ghosh, Idris Ali, Debasish Kar Gupta and Debjani Sengupta ? to inspect roads and express their views to the court, so that appropriate action could be taken.

 The order was passed after the public works department (PWD), Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) filed separate reports before the court on the progress of road repairs. The judges observed that if the committee kept a regular vigil, it may create pressure on the road-repairing agencies.

 Before passing the order, the judges came down heavily on the state government for not providing sufficient funds to the respective agencies for road repairs. ?Tell your government to withdraw tram services from the city if they have got no funds to repair the tracks and roads,? the angry judges told CTC managing director S.N. Pal, who was present at the hearing.

 On Wednesday, the court had ordered managing director Pal to appear before it and explain why he had not furnished the progress report on road repairs, despite a court?s directive to do so.

 Pal filed the report on Thursday, stating that the amount allotted by the state government to repair the 42-km-long tracks across Calcutta was insufficient. In the current financial year, the government had allotted only Rs 2.5 crore for repairs.

 ?In the 80s, Rs 10 to 12 crore used to be allotted for maintenance of roads and changing tram tracks. This has now been reduced to Rs 2 crore. Unless the budgetary allocation is the same as before, the CTC cannot fully maintain its infrastructure,? managing director Pal stated in his report.

 His company had submitted a proposal to the state government for allocation of Rs 53 crore in phases to change tram tracks. The CTC will start track repairs at the Mahatma Gandhi Road?Chittaranjan Avenue crossing, Judges? Court Road, the northern part of the Calcutta University, south Shyambazar depot, Belgachhia bridge proper, Park Circus in-gate to New Park Street and Rabindra Sarani.

 The public interest litigation on road conditions was moved jointly by Idris Ali and Sreemoyee Mitra, advocates of Calcutta High Court.

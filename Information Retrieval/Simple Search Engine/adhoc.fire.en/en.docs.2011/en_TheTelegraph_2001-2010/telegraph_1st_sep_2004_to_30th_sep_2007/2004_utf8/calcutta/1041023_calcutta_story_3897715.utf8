 Prabir De demonstrates Dashami?s traditional look

 After months of planning and anticipation, it?s all over in a flash. Durga Puja 2004 is on its way out, and there is only one fitting way to bid a fond adieu to the biggest festival in Bengal: decked up in your traditional best.

 The week (and more) of para adda sessions, pandal-hopping and freaking out in general with friends is over. Dashami is the moment to please your parents and pull out all the stops, putting your western wear on hold till the season passes. Here, Prabir De creates the colour to go with it.

 Step 1

 Start off by applying some moisturiser on your face to temper the harsh effects of the last few days of make-up. Leave it on for some time till your skin has absorbed it and there is no oily residue. Use a light compact and perhaps a dash of concealer in case you spy some marks or spots. Now that you have taken care of the basics, you can progress to the eyes.

 Step 2

 The eye make-up for this final day of the Pujas should be very dark and striking. Keep some orange and gold eye shadow at hand. Apply both shades on the upper lids in gentle upward strokes, spreading it evenly. Dab just a little bit near the corners of the lower lids as well. 

 Apply a generous helping of dark kohl, outlining the eyes to make them come alive. Don?t forget to add lots of mascara on the lashes for the final touch.

 Step 3

 Light orange and gold lipstick is what is recommended for the mouth. Be very careful to choose the right shade to go with both your skin and your ensemble. 

 Step 4

 Orange rouge, which will highlight the cheekbones and provide that extra glow to your face, is what comes on last.

 Team it well

 Turn your attention to your tresses. Make a perfect middle parting and tie it up in a khopa or low bun, tucking in fresh flowers if you wish. Tie it where the hairline meets the neck. 

 Coming to clothing and accessories, take care to keep these within the realm of tradition. This is not the time for experimentation. Rather, use this opportunity to reconnect with your roots and pick up a tip or two from your mother or grandmother. 

 The most cost-effective, perfect accessory for the day would be a big red bindi. For married women, a thin line of sindoor down the parting is ideal. In the jewellery arena, gold is the best bet.

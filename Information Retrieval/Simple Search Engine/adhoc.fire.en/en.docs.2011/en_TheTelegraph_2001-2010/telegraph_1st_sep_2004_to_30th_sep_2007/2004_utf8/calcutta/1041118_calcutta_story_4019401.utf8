The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Caffeine connection

 What?s brewing on Karan Johar?s table? Cooped up in a London room, the young director-producer is working on the script for his next film. ?The story is in my mind but it?s not structured. The writing is slow? I am struggling,? he admits over phone.

 But there is something else Karan has on offer before his next big-screen production after Kal Ho Naa Ho gets rolling ? Koffee with Karan.

 Come Friday, 10 pm, and the curtains will go up on the Karan Johar chat show on Star World. ?Yeah, this is the first time people are seeing me as an actor,? he laughs, speaking of the promos that have been on air for some time, showing an impish Karan fishing for compliments from the crew.

 The crew of Koffee with Karan is full of praise for the star film-maker off-camera too. ?He is not an anchor who comes in and says ?where is my script?? We have used so many of his suggestions in the show,? says co-producer Fazila Allana.

 Adds director Ravina Kohli: ?Karan is quick on the uptake. He has a terrific memory and rarely forgets a line. Moreover, since he understands the camera, he knows what to do in front of it.?

 What got Karan to look tellyward? ?I am always trying out new things. At one point I was even designing costumes for Shah Rukh,? he explains. If King Khan being part of the cast is the only detail he has to offer of his next film, guess who the first guest is on his chat show? Khan, of course, with Kajol keeping him company. ?Most people who come on the show are my friends. It was a bit strange at first, asking them questions to which I already knew the answers. In fact, I had to maintain a balance between being diplomatic and completely personal. That?s why it is such a challenge.?

 He concedes that his ?personal relations? have helped the show as a brand. ?I am part of the fraternity. This distinguishes KwK from other chat shows. Except for Sunny Deol whom I do not know so well, I did not have to do any research. It?s a fun chat I have with them,? says Karan.

 The format of the show, with outdoor shots, also makes it stand out. ?In one episode, we have taken Saif to Barista (which, according to Ajay Vidyasagar, senior vice-president, marketing of Star, will soon introduce coffee mugs signed by Karan and introduce a flavour named after the show) to do a random survey on Preity Zinta. Preity also did the same on Saif at Caf? Coffee Day. The opinions were played out to them,? says Fazila. ?Every show ends with such a punch,? Ravina adds, citing the Rani-Kareena episode where opinions of their male colleagues were aired on who the sexier of the two is. Johar also plays quiz master, hurling questions to guests on their preferences in a rapid-fire round.

 Fourteen episodes are in the bank as the show starts rolling on Friday. Ask Karan which episode he enjoyed most and he says: ?Kareena looked beautiful?? Is that a clue to his choice for the next film?

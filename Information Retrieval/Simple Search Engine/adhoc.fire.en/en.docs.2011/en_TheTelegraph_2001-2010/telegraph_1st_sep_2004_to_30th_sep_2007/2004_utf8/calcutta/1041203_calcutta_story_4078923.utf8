The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Food street fave at new address

 - Bar-B-Q stable grows with traditional fare plus beyond-boundaries cuisine

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The same succulent portions of the signature Prawn Kaseong and Wotib Babycorn. The familiar mouth-watering aroma of the tender Fish Peshawari and Chicken Malai Kebab? Nothing will change, but the address.

 For Bar-B-Q die-hards, there?s a new cuisine corner simmering to titillate taste-buds this Christmas. The Park Street eating house, which started off way back in 1960, is growing beyond the city?s traditional food street.

 After the steaming success of Flavours of China and One Step Up, the latest offering from the Kothari stable is Dalchini, an 80-cover Indian-Chinese restaurant on Camac Street, set to lay out its tables in the third week.

 With a spread culled from the most popular dishes of the Bar-B-Q kitchen, the new eatery almost coincides with the launch of the lounge bar Hideout in Flavours of China.

 ?The propensity to eat out is growing at a very fast clip in this city, and more the options, the merrier. Even though we are the largest restaurant on Park Street, seating 400 in our Chinese Room, Indian Room, Flavours and the ground-floor bar, we can?t always accommodate all our patrons. Hence, another restaurant,? explains S.S. ?Baba? Kothari, owner, and president of the Hotel amp; Restaurants Association of Eastern India.

 Bar-B-Q, which can lay claim to rolling out the ?multiplex restaurant? experience before Sourav?s took guard, has managed to fight off the Park Street slump by drawing more than 1,600 gourmands over the weekend.

 Yet, Baba Kothari, 67, knows Park Street is gradually getting ?saturated? and feels soon, there will be room ?only for the fittest?. Son Rajiv, masterminding Dalchini, is well aware of the constant need to reinvent.

 Experiments with culinary truths beyond boundaries could be a cornerstone of Dalchini. On the cards is a West Asian smattering to complement the handpicked Indian and Chinese fare. Inputs from elder brother Vivek, who manages an Indian restaurant chain (Mantra) in Tokyo, and elder sister Nandita, running Utsav, another Indian eatery on New York?s 6th Avenue, are ?most welcome?, says Rajiv.

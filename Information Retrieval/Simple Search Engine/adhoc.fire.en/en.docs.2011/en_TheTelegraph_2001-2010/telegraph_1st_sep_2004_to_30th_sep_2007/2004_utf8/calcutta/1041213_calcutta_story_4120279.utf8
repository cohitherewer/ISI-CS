Soulful songs and strains on the guitar that struck the right chord, a bit of bhangra and a feast of fusion that won friends on this side of the border.

 That, in a nutshell, was an evening of music on Saturday, featuring three acts that rocked Science City auditorium for two-and-a-half hours. 

 The hall was almost full to capacity, balcony down, with a crowd that drank in the music and soaked in the sights and sounds, from Rabbi to Josh and Fuzon, at Power FM Music Files 1, presented by Power 107.8 FM and Samsung, in association with The Telegraph. 

 First up was Rabbi, the Sikh singer who has turned into an overnight sensation with Bulla ki jana. Rabbi performed a purely unplugged set, with a little help from ?Tapan, a fellow Calcuttan? on the cello. And as someone in the audience declared: ?Your cello guy rocks.?

 Apart from performing Bulla ki jana twice ? the second by popular demand ? Rabbi sang two other numbers from his album, one about his ?true love? and another about ?the stupid sense of honour that my community shares, which has cost many young lives?. It mattered little that the lyrics were in Punjabi, it was the power and emotion in the singer?s voice that tugged at the heartstrings.

 The appreciation was in the form of applause, cheers and screams of ?We want Rabbi? even after he had left the stage.

 Saturday morning was hectic for Rabbi, the first to arrive in town, preparing for the concert and promoting his debut album. The man, whose fan list includes Amitabh Bachchan and who idolises Bruce Springsteen, has a simple ambition: ?world domination through music?.

 Overnight fame has left him slightly numbed. ?It feels good, there?s no denying that,? says Rabbi. ?But with all this touring it would take some time to sink in. Besides, I?m a very private person, and that side will not change.? Rabbi has sung for three films, Waisa Bhi Hota Hai, Let?s Enjoy and Boom, but playback singing isn?t something he enjoys much.

 ?All of them were very impersonal experiences. Maybe because I was singing someone else?s songs,? muses the singer who is named after the rabi crop, which ?needs a lot of water and care?.

 If Rabbi left the music-lover chanting ?more?, Josh, up next, was the dancer?s delight. The Canadian duo managed to bring almost half the hall to its feet and on the dance floor with its bhangra beats. Rup (Rupinder Magon) and Q (Qurram Hussain) began with their chart-topping collaboration on Nelly Furtado?s Powerless, and went on to perform songs they recorded with Apache Indian and Sukhbir. 

 ?Ladies man? Q had a bevy of schoolgirls singing and dancing with him up in front, leaving the youngsters star-struck and wide-eyed. Hit for the night ? Baan Farh Kay.

 though the programme started an hour late due to ?flight delay? ? Josh and Fuzon arrived in the city the morning after the MTV IMMIES in Mumbai on Friday night ? most were not willing to leave without tuning into Pakistani band Fuzon.

 And they were not disappointed ? Tere Bina, Mora Saiyaan, Ankhiyan?

 The three-member group comprises vocalist Shafqat, guitarist Shallum and keyboardist Imran, who is also the ?studio guy? when it comes to recording albums. While bass guitarist Russell Owen and drummer Fahad Khan are not Fuzon members, they?re regulars, and ?family?.

 Performing at the IMMIES on Friday and jamming in five cities, five nights in a row in Pakistan just before, took a toll on Shafqat?s vocal chords and audience expectations.

 For, it prevented Fuzon from performing Aankhon ke sagar. ?It?s too high a note, beginning with a raga, and Shafqat didn?t want to disappoint the audience,? admitted Shallum.

 But there was no dampening the Saturday night spirit at Science City. Even over-cautious security guards couldn?t keep the enthusiastic crowds at bay, as they poured in from all sides to stand, dance and clap in front of the stage. Shafqat joined in, till he was ushered back on stage. What had the crowd going completely wild, however, was not a rocking number, but a vocal rendition of the Bengali song Bhalobashi bolbona, by Shafqat.

 ?Please pardon my pronunciation,? he said, before singing four verses in unfaltering Bengali. The day after, recounting the ?amazing? experience, Shallum and Imran admitted it was a completely spontaneous gesture. ?I didn?t even know the song, so I could only strum the guitar,? recalls Shallum. But there is a Bengali connection ? ?one of Shafqat?s aunts is from Bengal?.

 For the grand finale, Rabbi, Josh and celebrity guest Usha Uthup joined Fuzon on stage, singing Yeh dosti, and then more of Ankhiyan. That, too, was spontaneous. It was a night to remember and Fuzon, for one, already has plans to be back here in March. Catch it if you can.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Action replay: some swim, some sink 

(From top) Renee ?Bridget Jones? Zellweger,

 It might have been put down as a feel-good chick flick, but the numbers at the box-office meant the makers of Bridget Jones Diary had the last laugh. And chances are, if you saw the movie, then there?s no missing the sequel, which hit theatres last Friday. Why? Because what happens next in Bridget?s diary is the million-dollar question that hasn?t ceased to mystify minds.

 The power of number two in the film industry might be a controversial issue, but its relevance has never been in doubt. Some don?t do as well as expected, but the curiosity factor always calls in the crowds. The Matrix fans might moan about the slump in the storyline, but hordes poured in for Reloaded and Revolutions, just to see what happened next to Neo and the gang. 

It?s not a formula that always works. In fact, in 

the case of trilogies, audience interest invariably fades by the time the third 

instalment arrives. But Hollywood remains undeterred in its quest to re-create 

some of the same magic. And often, it works. Although Charlie?s Angels 

was a bigger crowd-puller, Charlie?s Angels: Full Throttle had its fair 

share of screen success, thanks to the kick-ass, beautiful babes. Spider-Man 

2 broke its predecessor?s record, and Terminator 2 was oneof the highest-grossing 

films ever. Angelina Jolie was more popular as Lara Croft the first time round, 

but Bourne Supremacy is raking in more money than Bourne Identity and 

Mission Impossible 2 was equally impressive with action, special effects 

and gadgetry.

 It?s no secret that Shrek 2 and Toy Story 2 were even greater hits than the first films, but Exorcist: The Beginning, a prequel to the 1970s horror cult classic, wasn?t even close to achieving the status that The Exorcist continues to enjoy. Hannibal Lector is still terrifying audiences three films later, Austin Powers remains a comic success and the star status of Harry Potter, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings trilogy is undisputed in filmdom. 

 On the other hand, the second attempts to Home Alone, X-Men, Men In Black, Fast and Furious, Analyze This, The Lion King and Jurassic Park are just a few names in a slew of forgettable follow-ups. 

 There are three more sequels ? two already here and one yet to arrive ? that you could check out in town. The most high-profile, perhaps, is Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason. The scatty, 30-something British icon is back in action, pen and diary in hand. American actress Renee Zellweger once again dons the extra pounds and the garb of the character that made her famous. 

 Only this time, life with her wonderful, high-flying lawyer husband Darcy (Colin Firth) is not so rosy. He has a gorgeous intern that has Bridget all flustered. As if that weren?t enough, her two-timing former boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), is in the picture once again. Where does the story end...?

 Also playing is Resident Evil: Apocalypse, starring Ukrainian actress Milla Jovovich, made famous in another sci-fi film, The Sixth Element. She?s back as Alice, in the newest genre in Hollywood ? that of making films based on computer games. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider started it all, and the tradition is being continued by the likes of Resident Evil, with a niche but loyal fan-following. 

 In the latest offering, Alice is stuck in a city of the dead, trying to get out of the nightmare with a few survivors while a mutated creature will stop at nothing to kill them. For those familiar with the game, seeing the characters come to life is an experience.

 Arriving in halls next Friday is Ocean?s Twelve, with the star-studded cast of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and more. Once again, they?re up to no good, with the likes of Catherine Zeta-Jones adding extra glamour. They?re out to steal big bucks, so watch out. Even if you?re not a film-buff, there?s got to be at least one of your favourite actors on that list, thus ensuring the movie?s box-office success. 

 Proving that more of the same does work, coming soon is Meet the Fockers, the sequel to the hugely-successful comedy Meet the Parents. Robert De Niro playing a protective father rather than a mafia don worked the first time round, and with Dustin Hoffman joining the stellar cast, there isn?t much chance of going wrong.

 To make up your own mind on the success of sequels, buy a ticket and drop in.

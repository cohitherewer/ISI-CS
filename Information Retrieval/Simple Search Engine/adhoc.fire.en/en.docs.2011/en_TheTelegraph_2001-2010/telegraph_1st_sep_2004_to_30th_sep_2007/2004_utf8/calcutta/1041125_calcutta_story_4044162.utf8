 Class act: Needed, stress management to 

keep temper in check 

 The tragedy that has befallen the Shahs (Hounded, 

100 years on, October 28) can by no means be dismissed as a stray incident. Most 

residents of the city would probably feel that a similar incident can happen to 

them any day. 

 We must congratulate Prem Chand Shah and his son Ashish for refusing to succumb to the pressures of the local goons and the police. A gang of local youths had beaten up the father and the son and ransacked their store on Madan Chatterjee Lane. They were being ?punished? for their refusal to give away sherbet and sugar free from the shop to the goons. When the gang went on the rampage, a crowd gathered outside but not a single voice of protest was raised. 

 The most disturbing aspect of the incident is the repeated attempts by the police to protect the goons. The unholy nexus among the police, the politicians and the goons has put a question mark on the sense of security of every citizen. Most of us prefer to accept the diktats of the local dadas for fear that they might harm us. What we fail to realise is that the more we give in to their demands, the sooner will they reach a stage where it will become impossible to satisfy them. 

 Unless we take a united and determined stand, we will be hounded too, just like the Shahs. This will only be possible when we make a conscious effort to strengthen the societal bonds with our neighbours through regular interactions at different levels. Strangers can never be expected to come to our aid.

The report ?Patience tips for teachers?, October 25, reflects on how intolerant teachers have become towards their students. By all indications, this intolerance will only increase in the coming days. There are several reasons behind the trend. At present, innumerable teaching posts are lying vacant, thus putting tremendous pressure on those in the profession. The government unfortunately has not taken the initiative to fill up the posts. 

 The teacher-student ratio has always been lopsided here and it has only worsened in the past few years. The students too are suffering due to the inaction of the government. They are often punished severely for minor offences by irate teachers. 

 Teachers should immediately be provided with psychological training to help them get a grip on themselves and the classroom. It is shocking that a large number of teachers still believe in corporal punishment though this has rightly been banned.

It is interesting that the education department is 

planning a course to help teachers keep their cool. Loss of patience on the part 

of teachers may affect the development of students. Unfortunately, some teachers 

lack the mindset to teach, and the course might not help them much. 

Debaprasad Mukherjee, 

Nayapatty. 

It is a welcome move on the part of the government 

to consider ways to check the stress levels of teachers in government-aided schools. 

It?s doubtful how the introduction of a child-psychology module in the B.Ed course 

will help teachers. Most teachers have their own children and therefore, it may 

be assumed that they are more or less aware of child psychology. Any teacher violating 

the ban on corporal punishment should be hauled up.

 Apropos Hard Talk entitled ?Port to airport, two-hour ride?, October 25, in reply to a question on the autorickshaw problem on NSC Bose Road, district magistrate Vivek Kumar had said that steps would be taken against the guilty if written complaints were received. Residents of our locality have submitted several written complaints and reminders without any result. Last year, the chief minister?s attention was drawn to the problem during a phone-in-programme on a TV channel and despite his assurance, nothing has been done. 

Tanmoy Ghosh, 

Beleghata.

The report ?Hospital trouble follows death?, October 28, made me sad. Every day lots of patients die in the city hospitals due to negligence of the authorities. The government does not do anything to improve the situation, resulting in more such deaths. 

Atif Ayaz,

Serampore. 

Apropos the report ?Rasogolla for the records?, October 25, it is heartening that Manjulika Das, a great granddaughter of Nabin Chandra Das, has decided to pen the history of her great grandfather, who discovered rasogolla.

 Apropos the report ?Job abroad offer a fraud?, October 26, it is really sad that unemployed youths are being duped by fake advertisements in the city?s leading newspapers. Unemployed youths are easily cheated as they are the most vulnerable of targets. Police should be more vigilant against such rackets. 

Piyal Mukherjee,

Lake Town. 

Apropos the report ?Tout?s paradise to tourist?s delight?, October 25, Howrah station becomes a den of vice after 10 pm. Passengers often feel insecure at the station. Cases of tourist harassment are also on rise there due to the callousness of the administration. Unless the tout menace is rooted out, our tourism industry will not prosper. 

B.N. Bose, 

Dum Dum. 

Apropos ?Sorry, Mr chief minister, we women feel unsafe?, October 26, what could possibly be more embarrassing for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who claims his city is the safest for women and turns a blind eye to cases of molestation of tourists? It is high time he takes note of the situation. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road.

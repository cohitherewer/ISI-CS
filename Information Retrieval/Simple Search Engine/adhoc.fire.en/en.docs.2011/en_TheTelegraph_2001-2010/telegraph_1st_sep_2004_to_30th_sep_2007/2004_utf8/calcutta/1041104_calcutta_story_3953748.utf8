 Writer?s assets: ?Youth, good looks, fat advance?

 This may be Shashi Deshpande?s first literary trip to Calcutta, but Calcutta witnessed her birth as a writer. Over 25 years ago, her first creative foray ? The Legacy and Other Stories ? was published by Writer?s Workshop.

 On Tuesday, her mentor P. Lal was unable to attend the reading of her latest novel Moving On due to failing health, but the city at least was not deprived of a reading from the petite, unassuming writer.

 That she hasn?t been here before is indicative of how much the industry has changed over the years. ?I only started doing these promotional tours with my last novel, Small Remedies,? recalls the Bangalore-based Deshpande.

 Amit Chaudhuri formally unveiled the book at Oxford Bookstore, followed by a reading by the author and an interactive session at the Park Street store.

 Deshpande missed Lal, an early influence in her career. ?I owe him a lot? He was so encouraging in a quiet way,? explains the writer who picked up the pen ?not by design?. 

 Her father, a noted Kannada poet, suggested she contact Lal and in 1978, her first collection was published.

 With the ?great step forward? taken in the Indian publishing industry, the scenario has changed completely. Apart from the market being more receptive to Indian works, it has made books more accessible to readers, and print more accessible to writers.

 Apart from these up sides, there have been a number of added pressures as well. ?There is too much hype about some authors, and there is the need for constant promotion ? often self promotion,? regrets the salt-and-pepper-haired Deshpande. 

 ?With this comes the feeling that unless you are featured in the media, you are not important,? she adds. Writers now, are writing under pressure. ?You have to be young and good-looking to get that kind of publicity.? And with the rules of the game changing, even the down-to-earth Deshpande has had to learn how to speak to the media, as it is ?important for the book?.

 Fat advances are the other sure-shot way to get your name in the paper, stresses Deshpande. Big money gets big publicity, ?not based on the merit of the writer?. But Indian publishing houses, unlike their foreign counterparts, rarely give hefty advances.

 While Deshpande is known best for her novels exploring family spaces, she has written four children?s books as well, while her own children were young. 

 ?I didn?t want them to grow up reading just Enid Blyton. But unfortunately, by the time they were published, the kids had grown up!? laughs the 60-something writer has just finished work on a translation of her father?s works, for which she is on the lookout for a publisher.

 The woman who ?never gives advice, even to my own children? had a few words of guidance for aspiring novelists. ?Now everyone wants to be published,? she observes. ?Keep reading as much as you can,? is her best tip for a wannabe author. 

 And don?t hurry a thought. If it stays with you, it might be worth building on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Due south

If the ethnic weaves of south India attract you, the five-day exhibition that took off on Thursday at Genesis Art Gallery is where you ought to be. 

 Shilpi, a lifestyle store from Chennai, which houses saris, garments and household linen is now in Calcutta to showcase the best of south-Indian workmanship. Titled Southern Exotica, the collection consists of a range of silk and cotton handloom saris. 

 Run by Arundhati Menon and Bamini Narayanan, Shilpi is currently celebrating its 25th birthday and is striving to preserve some of the oldest forms and designs of sari weaving from south India, for instance the Korvai sari from Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu. The Korvai is the temple cotton and silk, produced using a complicated three-shuttle technique, which gives the saris contrasting borders, temple joints and a classic look. 

 Drapes like Telias from Andhra Pradesh, Mangalgiri kotas, Irkals from Karnataka, Uppadas from the Godavari and Kasavu saris from Kerala are on display as well.

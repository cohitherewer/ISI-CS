The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ego spar in pump pathway

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It took mayor Subrata Mukherjee one-and-a-half years to lay the 115 metre-long underground pipeline in Sadhu Tara Charan Lane; just six months less than it took him to demolish the fire-ravaged Star theatre and rebuild it. 

 According to sources, the delay in laying the pipeline was due to an ego clash between the mayor and a council member, Mala Roy, who is apparently being supported by a section of the Trinamul Congress to stymie Mukherjee.

 The 160-cusec Southern Avenue drainage pumping station, which was inaugurated by Mamata Banerjee with much fanfare on Wednesday, will directly benefit over 250,000 people in five adjacent wards covering an area of 4.5 sq km. Residents of Gariahat, Deshapriya Park, Gol Park, Southend Park, Triangular Park, Hindustan Road and parts of Dhakuria will be the chief beneficiaries.

 ?Waterlogging on Southern Avenue will now become a memory,? said Mamata Banerjee at the inauguration. The mayor concurred.

 The Rs 2.2-crore pumping station, fitted with British pumps, has been built by the state-run Mecon Limited on a turnkey basis.

 Earlier, the rain water that accumulated in the area used to be pumped out by the Ballygunge pumping station in Tiljala, 4.5 km away. 

 The pumping station, built on land provided by the CIT, was ready for operation by June 2003. 

 But it could not be commissioned as engineers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) were prevented from laying the tail-end segment of the pipeline to discharge water in the Tolly?s Nullah by mayoral-council member (drainage and sewerage) Mala Roy. 

 She demanded that the silt be cleared from Tolly?s Nullah (to prevent flooding) before the pipeline was laid under Bawali Mondol Lane, Chandra Mondol Lane and Sadhu Tara Charan Lane in her ward. The councillors of Chetla and Kalighat supported her. 

 Receiving no support from his party, the mayor had to allot Rs 2 crore for the excavation of silt from the 900-metre stretch of the Nullah, which belongs to the state irrigation department, between Kalighat and the Boat Canal.

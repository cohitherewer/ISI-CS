 Town Hall free for Santa Subrata ally

 OUR BUREAU

 With Christmas not far away, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has decided to play Santa Claus ? allowing political ally BJP a free run of the Town Hall, no less.

 Thanks to the munificent mayor, the state BJP unit will be able to hold its workers? convention on December 10, without paying a paisa for the historic venue.

 ?We are grateful to the mayor for giving us a venue like the Town Hall for free,? said state BJP general secretary Rahul Sinha.

 ?His gesture came after we had exhausted our search for a suitable venue for the convention, which will be addressed by our party president, L.K. Advani,? added Sinha.

 On Monday, Mukherjee spelt out why he had chosen to let out the Town Hall for the BJP convention but refused to be drawn into money talk: ?We let out the place for public programmes, so I see nothing wrong in allowing the BJP to hold a convention? After all, I am in need of money for Calcutta?s development.?

 But did the BJP pay the civic authorities Rs 3,000, the requisite fee for hiring the Town Hall for a day? No reply. Or maybe, don?t know/can?t say.

 The mayor remaining mum on the booking price has not stopped voices from being raised about the Town Hall doors being flung open to a political party.

 According to several members of the committee governing the Town Hall, the mayor?s gesture is unacceptable, as the city of Calcutta had spent over Rs 3 crore for reviving the heritage structure meant for hosting civic receptions and public meetings.

 ?I am a member of the Town Hall Society. The decision to allow a political party to use the auditorium for a workers? convention was not discussed,? said historian Barun De.

 ?During the Raj, a few political programmes might have been held at Town Hall. But ever since the hall has been declared a heritage structure, no political programme has been held there. Moreover, why should the hall be made available to any non-civic body for free?? demanded De.

 The present charter of the Town Hall, which can seat 1,500 in its auditorium, offers room for recovering the investment by letting out the premises for a fixed charge.

 ?His (the mayor?s) decision to make the Town Hall available to a political party goes against the character of a heritage structure,? asserted Atish Dasgupta, educationist and a member of the state heritage commission.

 Some members of the mayor?s council also toed the no-political-party-in-the-Town-Hall line.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Soul tunes of today

 Fun amp; Song: Another rocking evening. 

Pictures by Rashbehari Das

If you thought Calcutta had reached saturation point 

after a Bangla-Bengal show rocked Salt Lake stadium on October 2, Cactus and Lakkhichhara 

restored faith in the city?s love for Bangla bands last week. At Sunsilk Unish 

Kuri Parichay, singing to the packed Kala Mandir galleries, they swept everybody 

off their feet, witnessed Zeeshan Jawed.The aim of the programme organised 

by Bengali youth magazine Unish Kuri, in association with Sunsilk, was 

to make the debut of freshers in college a memorable one. Students from Presidency, 

Scottish Church, Lady Brabourne, Bijoygarh, Gokhale and several other colleges 

turned up to tune in. Here are some of the high points of the evening of song, 

dance and daring.

Lyrical language

 If Aashay aashay boshe achhi (the famous ?telephone song?) sung by Lakkhichhara touched an emotional chord, Ghure phire ek-i kotha set the entire auditorium swaying to the sound. But if the performance of the young lot was sheer madness, there was more method in the music of their seniors (Cactus), like Nil Nirjane, which kept the crowd enthralled with its repertoire of rhythm, and the sign-off, Phirbe na aar phirbe na. The common factor: the language of their music.

Chain reaction

 And the note hit home with the youngsters in the audience, judging by the thunderous applause and loud cheers. If the boom boxes on stage were blaring, they had stiff competition off stage from the all-too-vocal enthusiasts. Some decided to be proactive, forming a chain and doing the rounds of the hall.

Light bright 

 Going for a concert is not always about what you hope to hear, it is also about being seen. For once, cell phones were not the menace they have become infamous for. At the peak of the performance, everybody who owned one was seen waving it around like a torch, bright enough to create quite a glow.

Hen-pecked

 If master of ceremonies Mir had people practically rolling on the floor with his wacky comments, the willing contestants for the Mr Murga-Miss Murgi competition provided sufficient humour for the greedy-for-more gathering.

 In a bid to win the much-sought title, participants in pairs had to achieve the unbelievable. Like when the man with the mike asked two young men to play Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton. Another couple was asked to display its hair-tying skills.

 Shrimonti and Tapan from Scottish Church College bagged the prestigious prize, but every daring participant walked out of Kala Mandir with Unish Kuri T-shirts.

What's on your mind this week

Mad 

for music

The state of music, particularly western music, in 

Calcutta is pathetic. Nothing in this city caters to the needs of music-lovers 

like myself. Music stores are filled with junk from a bygone era that everyone 

seems to glorify. Rubbish like Led Zeppelin pollute the racks. This letter is 

a call to arms for every musician who feels that the music scene here needs a 

heavy dose of metal. Now, those reading this probably think metal is music for 

puberty. But how many even know what metal is? The power to take aggression, pain 

and rage and to perfect it into a tool of prolific song-writing has always been 

underrated in Calcutta. Musicians here prefer to take things easy and play covers 

for a living. It is something they are proud of. Where is the original music we 

were promised by bands like Skinny Alley? Calcutta (and India) severely lacks 

the talent and the thought needed to make good, tight, heavy metal music. It?s 

a shame that we have to depend on lackadaisical bands.

 Radio gaga

If you?re a music freak, you can?t have missed the 

FM onslaught. Over a year now, in cars or buses, taxis or the neighbourhood paan 

shop, or in happening city fests, FM has made a comeback with a loud bang and 

carved a niche in the hearts of the people. Most Calcuttans believe it is a modified 

form of the age-old source of entertainment, catering to a wide and varied audience. 

The different channels dish out some great music, combined with a host of interesting 

programmes like news and traffic updates, cooking shows, live discussions on unique 

topics and contests that give us an opportunity to win prizes. Besides, there 

are interviews with famous personalities and the chance to dedicate your favourite 

numbers to loved ones. Despite some criticism about not enough niche music and 

too many pop numbers, the rising popularity of FM is undeniable. It is a free 

and easily accessible mode of entertainment that makes us forget the trouble of 

traffic jams.

 Super spinner

I want to congratulate Anil Kumble, one of the best 

and most experienced spinners in the game today, for joining the elite 400 Test 

wickets club. He has given a lot to Team India in the past and is one of the assets 

of our squad. It is a great achievement.

 Course talk

Calcutta University (CU) started BBA (hons) courses 

from 2002. BBA is a professional graduation degree in business administration. 

It?s syllabus is based on business management and administration. This course 

is conducted by nine colleges, under CU. To be admitted, one has to get through 

CU?s common admission test. Since BBA is a self-financed course, it is far more 

expensive than the others (BA, B.Sc, B. Com). But BBA students do not enjoy any 

reservations for admission into MBA courses. They have to compete with others 

from various streams through CAT. Students of general courses need not compete 

with candidates from other streams for post-graduate degrees (for eg, MA is reserved 

for BA graduates, M.Sc is reserved for B.Sc passouts). BBA students are discriminated 

against. The injustice should be rectified.

The diary

Mirrors...

The smoke of my cigarette 

Dissolves in the subliming moon.

And, The glass of the moon 

Breaks into prisms. 

They rearrange in the ball of your eye.

?Thousand 

Concentric circles crack 

And, Burst into smaller eyes. 

Moon?s many eyes, 

Now, Float in your eye.

Confusion

Have I conceived the volley of eyes 

That gaze at me all day long 

Deceptive, though it might appear 

Inevitably they always peer 

Questioning my spiritual intuition. 

When all at once they pounce at my institutional calibre. 

Their entwining tentacles 

Produces an unfurling, surging barnacle 

When I realise, it has already passed into utter oblivion.

On Separation

With the pleasant blue sky, 

Soft green grass, 

To inspire every moment: 

It?s futile to shed tears 

For loved ones! 

But for that gourd plant 

Which by its fruitfulness 

Filled the heart! 

Or for that rose 

Which by its fragrance 

Filtered fresh emotions! 

Or for that nightingale 

Which by its music 

Rekindles the dying spirit every morn!

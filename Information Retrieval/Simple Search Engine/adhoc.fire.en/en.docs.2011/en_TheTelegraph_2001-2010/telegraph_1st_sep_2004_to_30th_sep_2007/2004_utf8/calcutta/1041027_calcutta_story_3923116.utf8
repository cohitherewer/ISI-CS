The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crime corridor beyond border

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AMP; PRONAB MONDAL 

 The chill in the Indo-Bangla ties notwithstanding, crimelords on both sides of the border are locked in a brotherly embrace. 

 And bearing the brunt of this camaraderie is Calcutta, where local gangsters are hiring criminals from Dhaka and elsewhere in Bangladesh for ?jobs? ranging from robbery and extortion to supari killings. 

 ?The new trend is one of the toughest challenges we have ever faced,? conceded a senior officer at Lalbazar.

 ?Once a Bangladeshi criminal leaves the city after committing a crime, it?s almost impossible for us to catch him,? he explained. 

 A probe by the special branch (SB) revealed that the alliance was forged three-four years ago. ?Initially, whenever we received information about the involvement of Bangladeshi goons in crimes in the city, we used to think that the incidents were isolated. But now we have realised that the crimes are outcomes of well-organised efforts,? said an SB officer. 

 Elaborating on the trend, the officer said the partnership in crime started taking shape after big-ticket criminals like Gabbar, Gudda and Sona fell into the police trap and others like one-armed Dilip and Gopal Tiwari went missing. 

 ?Most of these criminals were arrested in a two-month span, causing a vacuum in the underworld. At first, city criminals joined hands with their Mumbai counterparts. But soon the relation proved costly for them,? the officer said.

 The local gangsters then turned towards Bihar-based criminals. But this alliance too didn?t work out. The Bihar goons soon started attempting their own tricks.

 It was then that Bangladeshi criminals entered the scene. This relationship proved beneficial for both sides. 

 ?Dons from across the border are paid between Rs 10,000 and Rs 1 lakh, depending on the nature of the job assigned to them. On the other hand, city-based criminals facing police heat are fleeing to Bangladesh for refuge,? the officer elaborated. 

 He cited the instance of Sadaquat Ali, prime accused in the American Center attack, who had fled to Bangladesh after the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Port to airport, two-hour ride

 Vivek Kumar, district magistrate of South 24-Parganas, met readers of The Telegraph in his bungalow last week to answer their queries. Participants included Sandip Banerjee, Sanjana Basu, Saileswar Chakrabarty, Juthika Mukherjee, Ranajit Basu and Basudeb Chowdhury

Saileswar Chakrabarty: We hear the state government will lay a road connecting the proposed Kulpi port with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport. When does the project take off? 

 Construction of that road is, perhaps, one of the most important projects in the district. The road will connect Kulpi port with the northern parts of the state through national highways 34 and 35. The port is being developed as a joint venture of state government and a precondition to making the port functional is the construction of the road.

 It will carry cargo in and out of the port skirting the city traffic. This 130-km road, referred to as ?the eastern corridor?, will cost nearly Rs 1,600 crore. It will run from the port along its hinterland and connect with national highways 34 and 35 after passing through Raichak, Bantala, Kukrahati. Basanti and the wetlands in the eastern parts of the city. Once the road is ready, it will take hardly two hours to reach the airport from the port.

Sandip Banerjee: Autorickshaws plying between Tollygunge and Garia have become a menace. Can?t the administration stop this?

 This is a general complaint. And I believe the matter can only be tackled if union leaders interact with the traffic authorities. 

 If you have a specific charge against any autorickshaw, you can lodge a complaint with police. You can also write to senior police officers. Once we get a written complaint, we may take certain steps. Without written complaints, it is difficult to tackle the unionised autorickshaw drivers.

Ranajit Basu: Most areas in the district are crisscrossed by rivers and creeks. What is the scope for development of the river route?

 The district is spread over 9,000 sq km, of which nearly 60 per cent is connected with rivers. Hence, there is ample scope to develop the river route. In fact, the transport department is toying with the idea of exploiting these routes to connect them with the islands.

 We have already started constructing jetties. Both country and mechanised boats, as well as launch services, are in operation. 

 Ferry services on some routes have considerably increased and we have to issue regulatory notices in some parts of the district, restricting the number of boats as well as the routes.

Juthika Mukherjee: Fishery is one of the major thrust areas for development as there are many rivers in the district.

 Fishery is one of the prime industries in the district. Apart from a stress on the common fishery schemes, like prawn culture, we have also taken up some other projects. 

 One such ambitious project is crab development. Under the scheme, crabs are cultured in a controlled atmosphere and are subsequently reared. Then, they are sold to local markets and also supplied to exporters.

 Some varieties of crabs are much in demand in Southeast Asia. Apart from this, we also supply ornamental fish to several countries. 

 We have set up an ornamental fish development centre and have engaged rural women. This will help boost the rural economy.

Ranajit Basu : What about setting up a jetty at the Sagar Islands?

 There is such a proposal as navigability of the Calcutta port has declined. The rate of siltation in these rivers is very high and they have to be regularly dredged. Since the job demands a very high budget, the Centre has to assist the state for carrying out the operation. 

 We are considering some schemes for desilting parts of the Hooghly, especially the mouth of the river.

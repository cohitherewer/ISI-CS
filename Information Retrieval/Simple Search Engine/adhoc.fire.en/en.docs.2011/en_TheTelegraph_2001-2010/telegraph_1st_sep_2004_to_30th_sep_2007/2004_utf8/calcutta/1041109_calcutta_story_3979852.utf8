 Vagrant hurdle on clean-up route

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A spurt in the number of vagrants, streetchildren and pavement-dwellers is posing a threat to the city?s already stretched infrastructure, mayor Subrata Mukherjee said on Monday.

 ?We have decided to get the government?s view on the issue,? said Mukherjee. ?Both the state and the civic body want to beautify Calcutta and are facing similar problems in doing so. The swelling ranks of pavement-dwellers is a difficult problem because you cannot be harsh with them and at the same time you cannot let them get in your way.?

 Several councillors have written to the civic authorities as well as the government about the problem. Provakor Mondal, CPM councillor of ward 46 (Bentinck Street-Chandni Chowk-New Market area), is one of those who have petitioned the government and the mayor, demanding a drive against vagrants and pavement-dwellers. 

 ?Crimelords are believed to be using vagrants and pavement-dwellers for drug-peddling, theft, car lifting, vandalism and in the flesh trade, the root cause of the spread of AIDS,? said Mondol. 

 According to the civic conservancy department, the areas worst hit by the influx of vagrants include Strand Road, Colootolla Street, CR Avenue, Madan Street, Moulali and APC Roy Road. 

 The pavements around the civic headquarters and the stretch from Park Circus to Gariahat are also taken over by vagrants.

 There is an anti-vagrancy Act and a police department, headed by an officer-in-charge, for carrying out operations against vagrants.

 Dwelling on pavements is not allowed in the city, said the mayor. According to him, police inaction has encouraged poor and displaced people from the districts, neighbouring states and even Bangladesh to come and settle on the pavements of the city. 

 Police records show that despite having a department, there has been no drive against vagrants in the last 19 months.

 Two drives were undertaken in April last year, in which 90 men and eight women were detained by the enforcement branch of police, of which the vagrancy department is a part. 

 Of them, 57 men and seven women were sent to the state government-run homes in Liluah and Uttarpara. 

 Mayor-in-council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb said the total number of pavement-dwellers in the city runs into thousands.

 Swapan Mahapatra, assistant director (conservancy) pointed out that the number of shanty eateries and tea stalls in the city is also on the rise.

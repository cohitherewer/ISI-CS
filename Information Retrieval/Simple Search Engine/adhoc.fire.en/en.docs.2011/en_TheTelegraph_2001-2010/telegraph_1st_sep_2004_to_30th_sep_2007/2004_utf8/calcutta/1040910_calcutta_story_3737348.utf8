Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has called 

for meaningful partnerships with ?all sections of industry and trade? and sought 

support and advice from the chambers in the government?s bid to attract investment 

to the state. 

 Inaugurating the India International Mega Trade Fair 2004 on Thursday, he said: ?We welcome cooperation from all the chambers of commerce and other trade bodies to help business grow in Bengal.?

 The chief minister also said Calcutta would receive the maximum benefit of the trade agreement between India and Thailand, proximity between the two ports being the key factor. Highlighting the buoyancy in the IT sector, Bhattacharjee said Bengal?s growth rate was 130 per cent, compared with the national average of 35 per cent. 

 Bhattacharjee praised former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for opening up the Nathu-la, which would improve trade relations with China. He also announced plans for the construction of Milanmela, an international trade fair complex off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass behind ITC Sonar Bangla, with the civic body as partner.

 CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers? Association of India)-Bengal, which is putting up its real estate show Home Front 2004 as part of the mega expo, welcomed Bhattacharjee?s bullishness. ?This is the first time that the government is looking for such partnerships and advice. It reflects a major shift in mindset and we will be more than willing to help,? said Pradip Chopra, secretary of the developers forum.

 Acknowledging the employment-generating potential of real estate and retail, the chief minister pledged total support for both and promised to consider CREDAI-Bengal?s plea on 24x7 nod for retail establishments in the city. 

 N.R. Goenka, president, Bharat Chamber of Commerce, delivered the welcome address at the inauguration.

 This year?s fair has 40 per cent more participants than last year?s. ?We are expecting Rs 250 crore-worth of transactions in real estate and Rs 500 crore overall,? the forum secretary said. Representatives of builders? associations from neighbouring states, including Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa, are visiting the fair this time.

 The exposition will feature a string of seminars addressing the needs of various sectors. On September 15, state IT minister Manab Mukherjee will launch CREDAI-Bengal?s official website at the fair. The site will contain a vector map of all ongoing real estate projects with their details, and will serve as a complete guide to the city. Bookings, including for service apartments, rail and air tickets can all be made through the site.

 September 17 will see two conclaves ? one on home loans by HSBC and another on the importance of maintenance in real estate developments, while a fire-safety conclave is also lined up.

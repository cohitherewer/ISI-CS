The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Piracy bouncer on sports beam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sachin Tendulkar: Lost and found

 There was nothing sporting about the spat that broke out between a sports bouquet and the Bengal government on Sunday, even as Team India raced close to victory on Day III of the Dhaka Test and piracy beamed supreme in cable and satellite homes.

 ?This is state-sponsored piracy? The most shocking thing in eight years of ESPN STAR Sports in India,? R.C. Venkateish, managing director, ESPN Software India, told Metro from Delhi.

 ?The entire (administrative) machinery did not support us and turned a blind eye to rampant signal piracy across the city,? alleged Venkateish. ?If this is how the West Bengal government wants things to be, we are ready to move our business out from that part of the country.?

 The government refused to duck. ?The remarks are most unfortunate, but we don?t care,? was the reaction of principal secretary Arun Bhattacharya.

 ?Our primary concern is the consumer, in this case the viewer, and we will need to intervene in the interest of the people. Trai has specifically said the state government has a big role to play in case of the cable television industry and we feel the operators, multi-system operators (MSOs) and broadcasters cannot be allowed to go on doing whatever they please,? Bhattacharya added.

 Saturday saw an eight-and-a-half-hour meeting between local representatives of ESPN STAR Sports and officials of Indian Cable Net and Manthan, the two MSOs on whose network the sports channels have been switched off since November 21, yield no solution to the cable chaos. The meeting in the presence of deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Peeyush Pandey was held at Lalbazar.

 By Sunday morning, however, most of Calcutta ? officially or unofficially ? was ready to catch the cricket action. Sachin Tendulkar?s career-best score and Bangladesh?s collapse were beamed thanks to large-scale signal piracy.

 On some sets, a scroll, ?you are watching SitiCable?, ran across the ESPN screen, while on others was pasted a digital label screaming, ?you are watching ESPN?.

 ?We approached the police, but I?m sorry to say there was no support from their side at all,? Venkateish complained. ?In no other city have we faced such government intervention on a commercial matter.?

 Also alleging that its personnel had been manhandled at some master control rooms during anti-piracy raids on Sunday morning, ESPN STAR Sports officials threatened to move court.

 Wed a girl to sell her off

 - Killer married 20 minors, eight rescued from brothels

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Thirty-five-year old Tikas Saha, of Krishnagar, would marry, only to sell off his wife to a brothel in faraway Pune or Mumbai. And if any problem cropped up, threatening to land him in custody, he would not hesitate to kill the ?wife?.

 Saha?s saga came to light a few days ago, after officers from the detective department netted him in a Sealdah hotel on September 12. 

 Following up on the leads provided by Saha during interrogation, the cops rescued eight minor girls from brothels in Mumbai and Pune on Sunday. Raids are being carried out to trace the other victims of Saha, who had married 20 young or minor girls over the past one-and-a-half years.

 While grilling Saha, the sleuths came to know that he had married 22-year-old Jhuma last year and murdered her in a Mumbai brothel. ?We contacted our counterparts in that city. They, too, were looking for him. A team from Mumbai has come and taken custody of Saha,? said Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Detailing Saha?s modus operandi, an officer said: ?He used to target girls from economically-backward families. He had laid traps for them in several districts, including Murshidabad and North and South 24-Parganas. After marrying a girl, he would sell her at a price ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 40,000.? 

 Saha told police that he would introduce himself as a Mumbai-based trader to the girls? families. That would make a cross-check of his credentials virtually impossible. ?After getting married, I would go straight to Mumbai or Pune to sell off the girl,? he admitted to the cops. 

 But what made her kill Jhuma? Saha told the sleuths: ?I took her to the DV Marg police station area and returned here after selling her off. When I went to the brothel in December last year, Jhuma started screaming at me, threatening to inform police about my activities. I had no option but to kill her. I slit her throat with a kitchen knife.?

 Saha revealed that he had sold eight minors to Pune and Mumbai brothels recently. ?Four girls each were rescued from Pune and Mumbai. Saha had married them over the past eight months. One was from Murshidabad, while the rest were from South 24-Parganas,? said an officer.

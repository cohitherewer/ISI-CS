 Uncertain work hours, ever-growing stress, improper diet and lack of physical exercise. Crib causes for most Calcuttans shuttling between home and office and struggling to stay fit. Those stationed at home are hardly in any better shape, fighting obesity or heart ailments.

 The key to most of these problems is exercise. But for those unable to make the trip to a gymnasium far away, the latest trend is having fitness equipment at home. 

 ?It?s not possible for everyone to visit a gym,? explains Sampat Rai of K amp;K Healthcare, which launched the Euro Fitness range of equipment in the city on Monday. ?So, using the gear at home is the next best option.?

 ?People are becoming more aware today that they must remain healthy and that exercise must be made a part of the lifestyle,? feels Gagan Sachdev, director, Bodyline Sports, which deals in fitness equipment. Sachdev?s shop in Ballygunge has seen a growth of 300 per cent in the past three years, managing sales to the tune of Rs 3 crore.

 Business is good for commercial establishments. Attests Sanjay Tewari of Geospa Fitness Store at Forum: ?People of all ages, including teens and those almost touching 60, come in.? Though the five-month old store counts the more upwardly mobile in its prime membership, the overall fitness streak is encouraging. ?It?s also not about building muscles, as is the common idea associated with gyms, but keeping fit and staying healthy,? stresses Tewari.

 The R amp;D for the Euro Fitness range is done in England, while the equipment is manufactured in Taiwan. Treadmills, cycles and cross trainers comprise the line, with prices starting at Rs 4,000 and moving up to a lakh.

 Affordability is a key factor for most homeowners going for keep-fit gear. ?Thanks to lower import duties and competition among equipment manufacturers, prices are coming down significantly,? says Sachdev. A combination of up to three components serving the entire family can be around Rs 50,000.

 Instalment options and add-ons in the form of counselling by trainers further help impact the home segment, particularly the lower-income groups. ?Lack of space is really not a problem, since most of the equipment can be folded or dismantled when not in use,? adds Rai.

 With shops already in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi, and Surat and Bangalore on the post-Calcutta map, Euro Fitness plans to do business worth Rs 25 to 30 crore by the end of the current fiscal. Calcutta?s contribution in it is expected to be around Rs 5-6 crore.

 Free flying, control line combat, radio controlled aerobatics ? fancy flying manoeuvres mimicked by miniature models. That?s the essence of aeromodelling, which will be on display on December 5 at Behala Civil Airfield, for the 56th Annual East Zone Aeromodelling Rally. 

 Although the competition was discontinued for four years from 1999 for want of sponsorships, it began again, thanks to the efforts of a few die-hard enthusiasts. This year?s event, by The Society of Model Aeronautical Engineers of India (SMAEI), will be one to remember, promise the organisers.

 Practice is in full swing by the Calcutta participants at weekly sessions on the Maidan. This year, there will be over 200 National Cadet Corps (NCC) participants, who are taught aeromodelling as part of their training in the air wing. 

 Apart from two units from Calcutta, there will be five more from Bihar, Orissa, Assam and Andhra Pradesh. There will also be 30 civilians, including two women and two professional aeromodelling demonstrators.

 ?Since the cadets are supposed to participate in contests to compete for the governor?s cup, there are large numbers of them taking part. But this time, there will be more of them than usual,? says A.K. Mitra, secretary, SMAEI. 

 The show, open to all, will begin at 11 am and go on till 5 pm. It includes one event, toeline glider, just for the ladies. There are no engines or remote controls, just a string tied to a model, which the participant has to run with till the craft is in the air, when the string is snapped. 

 The mid-air acrobatics of the radio-controlled models are always the big draw among spectators. But another event that is popular, but only the NCC participants? domain, is control line combat. 

 ?It?s a dogfight between two planes, like in a real encounter. It can result in the crash and burn of the models, but is exciting for people to watch,? explains Mitra.

 ?Such contests are good for boosting the sport among youngsters and enthusiasts,? says Prashant Agarwal, an aeromodelling expert who has taken part before. 

 The small aircraft is available in Calcutta at India Hobby Centre, among a few places. But expenses and availability has driven down the popularity of the sport, feels Agarwal, a 30-year veteran in the field, who has even travelled abroad on exhibitions.

 The gliders are easier to get and operate. There are the electrical models and, the most expensive variety, the ones with engines. ?The price of these can run into thousands of rupees,? adds Siddharth Mitra, an amateur aeromodelling enthusiast. He flies his planes most Sunday mornings on the Maidan. He won?t be taking part in the contest this time, but will be watching. 

 ?We grew up when there was a romance and freedom to the sport. Nowadays, kids are born with other distractions. So, my son is not as keen as me,? feels Agarwal.

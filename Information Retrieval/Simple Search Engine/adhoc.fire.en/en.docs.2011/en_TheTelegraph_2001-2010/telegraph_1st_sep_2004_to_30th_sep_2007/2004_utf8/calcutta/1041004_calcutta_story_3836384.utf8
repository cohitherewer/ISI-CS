The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Code shift cry for swift verdict

 Naba Kumar Ghosh, public prosecutor and guest lecturer of law at Calcutta University, met readers of The Telegraph to answer their queries. Participants included Sandip Chakrabarty, Bandana Banerjee, Sandip Banerjee, Arun Mondal, Ashish Kumar Chatterjee, Kaushik Chowdhury, Bonakrishna Roychowdhury, Sujoy Guha Roy and Arunabha Guha

Sandip Chakrabarty: What exactly is meant by a speedy trial? 

 Theoretically, there is no definition of a speedy trial in the Constitution. But as far as the practical judiciary is concerned, judges explain speedy trial as an expedited legal process. According to them, this means sorting out the disputes brought before the court as quickly as possible, without compromising with the legal formalities and inquiries. In short, it implies no delay on the part of the judicial process, from accepting the case to delivering the verdict. 

Sandip Chakrabarty: But there are numerous cases that have been pending for a long time.

 The process can be revved up easily if we modify the Indian Penal Code and the Evidence Act. The laws that we follow were formulated by the British, but with some minor modifications. In order to cope with criminal activities in the present scenario, the laws need an overhaul. 

 Moreover, the court period should also be extended to have judgments passed quickly. Apart from this, the number of judges has to be increased and the processes of filing cases must be simplified. 

 In this context, I would like to mention another important factor that often holds up a trial: repeated appeals to higher courts. This process of appealing to higher courts should be restricted and allowed only in case of critical trials. In fact, the law ministry is looking at recommendations put forward by some institutions to bring about changes in the existing laws. 

Arunabha Guha: We hear that the government appoints a defence lawyer for individuals who cannot afford to engage one. How does one get such legal assistance?

 Yes, there is a provision to provide the poor with lawyers once they are held guilty. You can get the assistance in two ways. First, when the trial is being heard, the person who needs the lawyer may inform the judge about this condition and pray for one such counsel for his defence. The judge will instruct the appropriate authority to provide legal help. 

 Another way is for the accused or a bona fide member of his family to approach the chairman of the Legal Aids Services (in the building of the city civil and sessions court). The cell was set up by the state government to help people who need legal help but cannot afford it. The chairman, after receiving the application, which is to be made in a specified format, selects a lawyer empanelled on the list of the legal department to provide the service. The remuneration is borne by the state.

Arunabha Guha: How is the safety ensured of persons associated with the profession? I hear that defence lawyers and even some public prosecutors are threatened in some cases. 

 This is an age-old practice where any influential person under trial or his associates try to disrupt the judicial system by tampering with evidence or seeking to influence the witnesses. The lawyer for the defence or the state also is at the receiving end of threats. In all such cases, the lawyers can complain to the local police and seek protection. They may bring the matter to the notice of the judge during the hearing of the case. The judge, in turn, instructs police to ensure safety of the lawyers concerned. However, like police, we have to treat such threats as an occupational hazard.

Arunabha Guha: Sometimes the public prosecutor is accused of working in tandem with the defence lawyer. Is that when a special prosecutor is appointed?

 A special prosecutor is appointed when the case is mired in legal intricacies and some specialised skills are needed to handle it. The public prosecutors remain busy with several cases that come up for hearing every day. It so happens that he cannot put his undivided attention to a particular case. In such situations, the government appoints a special prosecutor to appear for the state. Sometimes, the judge, on the prayer of the opponent lawyer, too, can appoint a special prosecutor to oversee the functioning of the existing prosecutor. But all this in no way proves that the public prosecutor has joined hands with the opponent.

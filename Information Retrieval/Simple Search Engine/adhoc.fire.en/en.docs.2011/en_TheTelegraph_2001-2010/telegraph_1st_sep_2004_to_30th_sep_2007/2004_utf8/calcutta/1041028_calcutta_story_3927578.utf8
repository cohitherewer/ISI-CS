 The civic authorities demolished a huge gantry that came up during the Pujas on Gariahat Road, off Golpark, and seized over eight truckloads of steel structures on Tuesday night.

 The secretary, department of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), had given permission to Mumbai-based roadsign agency Brand amp; More MAPP to construct the structure to be let out for display. 

 But mayor Subrata Mukherjee ordered municipal commissioner Debasis Som to demolish it without informing the HRBC or the firm as it was illegally put up without the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)?s consent.

 A team of the civic demolition squad led by assistant director (conservancy) Swapan Mahapatra arrived at the site equipped with pay-loader, crane and trucks on Tuesday night and demolished the steel structure in four hours. 

 The operation started at 11pm and continued till 3 am on Wednesday. 

 ?We have taken a policy decision to demolish unauthorised structures in public places or on CMC land without serving prior notice to the offenders,? said Mukherjee on Wednesday.

 Municipal commissioner Som asked the civic estate department to pull down all illegal billboards put up during the Pujas. 

 An officer in the civic estate department said over 2,000 boards were displayed by different agencies during the Pujas and over 1,200 of them are still intact. ?We will start pulling them down from Monday unless the agencies remove them by then,? said member mayor-in-council (conservancy) Rajib Deb. 

 According to the mayor, Gariahat Road belongs to the CMC and the HRBC was only given the right to construct a flyover on it. They have no right to let out the road for commercial purposes, he asserted.

 ?We are newcomers in Calcutta and the mistake has been committed owing to our ignorance. We had no intention to ignore the civic authorities but nobody, including the HRBC, ever advised us to seek permission from the civic authorities,? said chief executive officer of Brand amp; More, Hazeeb Rahman Padiyaph. 

 ?I would have taken no time to dismantle the structure on my own if the civic authorities had allowed me to do so,? he added.

 Padiyaph met deputy chief municipal commissioner (revenue) Nandan Roy on Tuesday and apologised for his ignorance of civic rules. 

 The company with branches in Mumbai, Cochi and Ahmedabad, opened a branch in Calcutta 11 months ago. A senior HRBC official said the department secretary had given them permission on October 22. 

 This is the company?s first venture in Calcutta.

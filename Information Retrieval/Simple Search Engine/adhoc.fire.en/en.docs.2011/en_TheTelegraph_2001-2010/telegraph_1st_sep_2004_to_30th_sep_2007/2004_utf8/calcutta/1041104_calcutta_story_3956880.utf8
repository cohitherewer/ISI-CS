LO-CAL

Derek O?Brien

 To Calcutta goes the credit of hosting India?s first 

quiz contest, way back in 1967. Thirty-seven years on, the Eddie Hyde Memorial 

Quiz will be held at the same parish hall (Christ the King, Park Circus) where 

the first event was conducted. To make the show even more special, Neil O?Brien 

will be the quizmaster on November 13, 2004. The Father of Indian Quizzing, who 

was grandly inducted into The Telegraph Open-quiz Show (TOPS) Hall of Fame, had 

conducted the Eddie Hyde quiz in 1967 as a 33-year old.

 Spot registrations for four-member teams from 3 pm 

at the venue.

Music to string together cultures

 Music for a noble cause, and this year, it?s not just a journey beyond barriers, but beyond borders, too. 

 On December 23, the St Xavier?s College grounds will reverberate with the beats of Strings ? the duo of Faisal Kapadia and Bilal Maqsood from Pakistan, MTV veejay-turned-singer Sophiya and popstar Shibani.

 ?It?s an effort to bring together the two cultures through music,? explains Swati Gautam of St Xavier?s College Alumni Association, which is organising the event ? the sixth chapter of Beyond Barriers. 

 ?It?s the only ticketed show on the college campus and like every year, we would like to raise funds through this year?s programme as well,? adds Gautam.

 The association plans to raise ?at least Rs 15 lakh? through ticket sales, stalls and sponsors at Beyond Barriers. 

 It will be the first live performance in the city for Strings (though they have been to Calcutta before) as well as Sophiya, who is currently riding on the crest of the Indipop charts with her covers of old Bollywood hits.

 ?We were in Calcutta in June to launch an album and loved the city,? offers Strings? vocalist Faisal Kapadia from Karachi. ?The people, in general, are so inclined towards music and we have great regards for the musicians ? be it RD Burman or Kishore Kumar ? that the city has produced.? 

 The college?s efforts towards a cultural confluence is a ?very healthy step?, feels Kapadia. ?The sounds on both sides of the border are so similar, it?s high time something like this was done.?

 Sophiya shares Kapadia?s enthusiasm: ?I was born and brought up in London and have performed with Pakistani musicians there, including Junoon. I think Indians should also travel across and perform in Pakistan now.?

 And what better way to garner funds than through music? ?Beyond Barriers started as a cultural celebration and we never thought it would become a fundraiser,? admits Father P.C. Matthew, principal of St Xavier?s College. ?Seeing the response of the first few concerts, we thought, why not use it to raise money, too??

 The concert started in 1995 with the somewhat unusual line-up of Louiz Banks, Shivamani, Hariprasad Chaurasia and Shankar Mahadevan. ?We were the first to introduce fusion to Calcutta,? says Gautam. And it was fusion unlike any the city had seen. An album was subsequently released of the historic evening at the college grounds.

 In 1997 (the event was biennial initially, turning into an annual affair only recently) things got even better, with Colonial Cousins, the biggest act of the time, setting the winter evening alight. 

 Lucky Ali, Sukhbir and Mehnaaz were other artistes who performed at the event. Last year, Channel V?s supergroups Viva and Aasma both performed together for the first time at Beyond Barriers.

 A section of the funds raised through the evening will go to building the second St Xavier?s campus off the Bypass, near the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute. 

 ?With a college, school, hostel, computer centre and other courses, we have nearly 10,000 students on our present six-acre campus every day,? says Father Matthew. ?We badly need another campus.?

 The new campus, also on a six-acre plot, will have a media centre, post-graduate departments of biosciences, information amp; technology as well as a management centre. 

 ?We plan to introduce short courses in astrophysics, photography, business finance and export and import,? adds Fr Matthew.

 Though the entire project will require ?five to 10 years? to near completion, a portion of the basic foundation work should be ready by next year. 

 Beyond Barriers and the alumni association?s efforts can only help speed that up.

 - Businessmen victims drugged, fleeced of Rs 2 crore

 PRONAB MONDAL

 She is the archetypal black widow. Pretending to be a damsel in distress ? a divorcee with a child who?d fallen on hard times ? she would invite men over to her flat to share a cup of coffee with her.

 If they rose to her bait, the victims would slip into unconsciousness after a sip of the drugged beverage. Then, she would rob them of their valuables, take their photographs and blackmail them. At the end of it, while she would amass a fortune, her victims would be poorer by lakhs. 

 On Thursday, Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said his men were on the lookout for Madhu Jhawar, copies of whose photograph have been distributed to them. Madhu figures on the city police?s list of most wanted because she is believed to have garnered about Rs 2 crore by fleecing nearly two dozen men over the past three years. 

 In one case, a victim associated with a temple lost valuables and cash worth about Rs 9 lakh, a detective said. 

 Detectives sounded an alert after two victims mustered courage to lodge complaints naming Madhu with the detective department and Lake Town police station. Detectives claim she trapped an intended victim by telling him she lived alone in the city, after putting her child in boarding school. 

 Madhu would size up a victim?s worth from the car he rode and his accessories. ?No wonder, most of her victims are businessmen,? said a detective on the case.

 If the victims tried to get off the hook, she would silence them either by showing them a camera with which she claimed she had taken ?obscene? pictures of them, or by threatening to frame them in a rape case. 

 One victim, Narayan Das Daga, who lost about a lakh to her last year, said in his complaint that he had met her in front of a temple in Burrabazar and had believed her tale of woe. Another victim, Kailash Bihani, informed Lake Town police station that she had relieved him of cash and a diamond ring.

 A police raid last week on Madhu?s Lake Town flat yielded two dozen photographs of victims.

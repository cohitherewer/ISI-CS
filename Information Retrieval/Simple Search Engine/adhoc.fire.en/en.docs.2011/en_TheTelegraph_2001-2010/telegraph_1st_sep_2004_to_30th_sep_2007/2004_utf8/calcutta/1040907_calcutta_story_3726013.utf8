The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Arrest no check on tease

 - Policing alone cannot ward off molesters, say Salt Lake cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It is 5.25 pm, and the sun is just setting over the swimming pool area of Salt Lake on Monday. Five young men in a grey Tata Indica zip past a lone girl on a bicycle. 

 The stereo is blasting, the men shout out a lewd comment. She has no choice but to ignore it and hope they dont come back for a second shot.

 It is clear that the arrest of Shahnawaz Khan, son of Abdul Mannan Khan, inspector-general (enforcement branch), on charges of molestation at HA block, has changed nothing in the township.

 The short-staffed police force is struggling to deal with rising harassment of women in the area. The solution does not lie in their hands alone, they claim, as their efforts have so far been ineffective.

 Mere policing is not the remedy to the problem. During our regular rounds, we have observed that eve-teasers disappear from the scene when we appear, only to return after we have left the location, explained Humayun Kabir, sub-divisional police officer, Salt Lake.

 However, Kabir urges people with complaints to approach the police and provide the registration numbers of vehicles used by the offenders.

 Around 5.45 pm, back near the swimming pool, two young men, possibly in their mid-20s, cruise along the road, circling back and forth, scanning the crowd at the popular hangout zone. A few girls, clearly bothered by the unwanted gaze, walk away. The car moves on.

 The day after Shahnawaz Khans father reportedly urged the victims family to drop the charges, Amitava Nandy, CPM member of Parliament from Dum Dum, turned up at the victims house, along with other leaders, including local CPM councillor Tapan Talukdar.

 There is no question of withdrawing the case. Let the law take its course, said the victims businessman husband. He blamed the increase in harassment and snatching cases in the locality on the number of outsiders loitering around. The member of the HA Block Residents Forum also felt that though patrolling may have increased, it has made little impact.

 We have been forced on a few occasions to start community policing on our own because of the lack of effective action, said Ramen Das, secretary of the Bidhannagar Welfare Association. 

 Eve-teasers move around in cars and motorcycles rampantly after sunset and someone has to do something about it, he added.

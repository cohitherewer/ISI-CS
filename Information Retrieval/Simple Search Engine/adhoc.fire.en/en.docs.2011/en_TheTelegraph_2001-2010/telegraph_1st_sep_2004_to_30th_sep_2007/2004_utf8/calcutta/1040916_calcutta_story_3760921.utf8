The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bengal frown over green nod

 Delhi?s draft environmental policy, giving it the authority to clear industrial projects, may make it difficult for such parks to come up. A Telegraph picture

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has blown the battle bugle against the Centre?s proposed environment policy, which it thinks will ruin the prospects of the state emerging as an industrial hub.

 The draft policy seeks to make the Centre?s green clearance mandatory for setting up of, among others, knowledge parks, biotech parks, industrial estates/parks, export processing zones and special economic zones. 

 State environment and IT minister Manab Mukherjee has already voiced his reservations about the proposed policy at a recent conference of state environment ministers and secretaries and chairpersons of state pollution control boards in Delhi.

 The chief minister will soon write to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, requesting him to convene a meeting of the National Development Council to discuss the issue. 

 ?We are opposing the draft policy because it virtually gives the Centre a carte blanche in clearing industrial projects in states. Our stand is that the pollution control boards of states or their environment departments should be entrusted with the job, except for projects that have international, inter-state or strategic national implications,? minister Mukherjee told Metro. 

 ?The cardinal principles of modern governance ? decentralisation and transparency ? are not reflected in the proposed policy,? he explained.

 Drafted during the previous BJP-led regime, the policy proposes that big development projects that have the potential of causing environmental damage are to be cleared by the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF). 

 All 19 types of projects under Category A ? including asbestos, chemical fertilisers and common effluent treatment plants, industrial estates, export processing zones, special economic zones, thermal power plants of more than 500 MW capacity and knowledge parks ? will require the Centre?s clearance. 

 Only projects under Category B will come under the state?s purview.

 The draft policy also lists another 27 types of projects that will require to be scrutinised by the MoEF?s Screening and Scoping Expert Committee, before being placed in either of the categories.

 Presently, around 30 development projects, many of them clubbed under common headings in the proposed policy, require the MoEF?s nod after being cleared by state green boards. 

 ?If the draft policy is accepted in toto, the days of licence raj will be back. Promoters will have to run all the way to Delhi for clearance?, minister Mukherjee argued. 

 Countering the MoEF?s claim that the policy seeks to make the process of issuing environmental clearance more effective and time-bound, the minister asserted: ?The proposed procedure is more complicated and time-consuming. It will require at least six months to issue a clearance. In the present system, the state pollution control board completes most of the formalities in just two months.?

 Echoing the minister?s view, an environment department official said: ?It?s hard to understand why a knowledge or biotech park or relatively less-polluting units like that of paper and pulp will require the MoEF?s nod. The proposal of the proponent party conducting the public hearing is also questionable.?

 MoEF additional director Subrata Bhowmick, however, said: ?Nothing is final yet. The draft policy is being reviewed.?

 Some MoEF officials admitted that there are lot of reservations within the ministry about the proposed policy. ?The proposal of the proponent party undertaking public hearing is simply absurd,? said one of the officials.

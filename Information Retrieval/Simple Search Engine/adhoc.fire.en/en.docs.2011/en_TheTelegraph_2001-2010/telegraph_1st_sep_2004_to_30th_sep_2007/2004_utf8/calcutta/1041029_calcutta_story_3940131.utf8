The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Stage On amp; Off

Even at the 56th performance of her first play on 

Thursday, Mandira Bedi is only two plays old on stage. ?Laughing Wild was 

conceptualised three years ago and we?ve had so many shows all over India since,? 

Mandira told Metro from Chennai. ?But each time I do the play, some line or the 

other holds a new meaning for me.?

Produced by Raell Padamsee and directed by Vikrant 

Pawar, the small screen star loves to do the play so often because ?it?s just 

two people and the only props you need is a pack of Maggie?. The comfort level 

(?we hardly need to rehearse it these days?) and the way the play goes beyond 

the humour to include ?lots of home truths?, helps, too.

 ?Raell had approached me with some scripts to read,? Mandira recalled. ?When she and Vikrant liked the reading, Vikrant gave me the script for Laughing Wild.?

 Since then, the script has changed ?almost 60 to 70 per cent?, including localising the Christopher Durang play and taking out things that didn?t work. The result has not been disappointing. 

 ?I recently met a lady who had attended the first show,? said Mandira. ?After seeing a recent performance, she said the play had become much better.?

 The Calcutta experience was perhaps a little disappointing. ?It was? okay,? said Mandira about the GD Birla Sabhagar response last year. ?The venue was a little impersonal for a play like that,? she offered.

 Her new venture, Anything But Love, has a lot in common with Laughing Wild, including the producer and director. This, too, is a two-actor play with Sameer Soni paired with Mandira. ?But it?s very different from the first one,? assured the woman who has changed the face of cricket viewing in India.

 ?It?s about a few months in the lives of two individuals who were once married to each other. You get a lot of insight into who they are and where they are headed. It?s funny, but also a lot beyond that.? 

 The ?sharp repartee? between the pair is another highlight of the piece that had the working title of Double Act. Plans were drawn up before Mandira left for her anchoring stint at the Champions Trophy in England in September and rehearsals continued between other commitments. Anything But Love opens in Mumbai in the third week of November and has bookings till April next year. 

 The vibe with the audience is what attracts Mandira to the stage. ?Anything live is very exciting. You know immediately if the audience is liking it or not.? Compering shows and live events, thus, still hold a lot of importance for her. As far as acting styles are concerned, there are no influences. ?It?s completely my own style. The first play being so unconventional helped develop that.?

Fresh from wrapping up other projects ? the short 

film Bali to be aired on STAR One and her first south Indian film Manmadan 

? it?s back to the stage for the moment. With her schedule, will she manage more 

plays? ?I?ll try my best,? laughed Mandira.

He?s a big name now in the world of cinema, but he 

can scarcely forget his roots that run deep in the realm of theatre.

Stage is where Atul Kulkarni (left, in a still from 

the film Manasarovar) has always belonged to even as he explores the ?technical 

adjustments? of the moving camera. And so, despite bagging one plum Bollywood 

assignment after another, the National School of Drama graduate just can?t wait 

to get back to stage.

 ?I have done around 13 shows in the past 15 days of my new Marathi play, Samudra. It is about a mystery island in the Pacific Ocean and six scientists who go there. Then, all of them die and one of them goes missing. I play CBI inspector Sujay Acharya who investigates the case. He finds one of the scientists lying unconscious. What follows is a whole lot of twists and turns. It is not just a whodunit ? it turns out to be the story of every human being,? says Atul. 

 Apart from Samudra, Atul has also been performing the Hindi play Kharashein, an adaptation of Gulzar?s poems and stories.

 ?Theatre gives something to me which cinema never can, and that is repetition. I just love to repeat the same thing in front of different audiences,? he says.

 ?Every actor performs differently on different days and that is met with different responses from different crowds... There is such a difference between my first show of a play and my 150th show. I have grown so much by that time and the audience reaction tells you that,? sums up Atul.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Knocking on heaven?s door

Pilgrimage in the ?60s to playing ground in the late 

?90s. Nondon Bagchi in tribute to Park Street and its harmony hubs

Going to park street for us teenagers in the ?60s, 

particularly on Sundays, was like a pilgrimage. One simply had to be there. Three 

to 7 pm on Sundays was Jam Session time in about four or five places on Park Street 

and these sessions were the domain of the teen brigade, mainly. The best pop bands 

(most often called ?beat groups?) performed four 45-minute sets of the latest 

and most popular songs. The place to go for most of us was Trincas because The 

Cavaliers and then the Flinstones, two groups who had the edge over the others, 

performed there.

The place was worse than a can of sardines, specially 

the dance floor. Not that one belonged to the privileged bunch that got to dance. 

You had to have a date; partners were hard to find. The pretty girls had made 

promises to dance with eager young men even before proceedings began and the chances 

of someone saying ?yes? to someone only known as a regular face was next to nil. 

But if you had enough money to nurse a coke through four hours you had a right 

to hang in there and soak it all in.

Which we did, week after week. Till we knew every 

song backwards. Songs by the Beatles, The Monkees, Dane Clark Five, Swinging Blue 

Jeans, Herman?s Hermits, Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, the Beach Boys, Union 

Gap, Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck and towards the late ?60s the appearance 

of the Soul music of Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, the Motown sound and just a 

touch of British rock. And more often then not, I would be staring at the drummer. 

Excellent drummers they were, too. The Flinstones had Steven Booth and the Cavaliers 

had Robin Sen, and Later ?Fats? Kapoor.

Imagine the rush, then, when owing to some quirk in 

the cosmic sequence of events, I found myself, in December 1968, on the same stage, 

the very shrine to which so many pilgrimages had been made. Friends who had a 

band in Darjeeling boarding school were here for the winter vacation and they 

needed a drummer and that was it. We auditioned and were taken on for short spots 

on Thursday nights and Sunday mornings. We called ourselves Chequered Tricycle 

and though we did some pop, perhaps for the first time on Park Street, there was 

a lot of Rolling Stones, Cream, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors and other rock material.

We rehearsed from six in the morning till opening 

time that was just after 10 am, six days a week. Two glorious winters went by. 

We were up close with bands and musicians from other parts of the country, as 

well as some of Calcutta?s leading lights.

Usha Uthup (then Iyer) was there. Toto Wahlong (?The 

Golden voice from Shillong?) was there. Biddu Appaya (producer of the international 

No. 1 hit Kung Fu Fighting) was there. It was heady stuff. And we were 

hooked. 

Twenty-eight years passed before I played again on 

Park Street, though the music never stopped. We played concerts in auditoriums 

and dance gigs at clubs and did campus performances. Bands changed, the music 

changed and developed and thanks to the creativity of songwriters like John Brinnand 

and Dilip Balakrishnan (who were both part of Great Bear), and later in the band 

High, where Dilip was the driving force, we got seriously into original work.

The early ?80s was the time I got into playing jazz, 

with Carlton Kitto as my mentor, and this is still an ongoing thing. About the 

same time an alliance was formed with Gyan Singh and wife Jayashree (of Skinny 

Alley) where we got seriously into the tight discipline of classic pop, never 

a thing to be underestimated.

Old friend and bassist extraordinaire Lew Hilt was 

there in nearly all these scenarios. Drummers and bass players probably feed off 

each other more than any other combination and it has been a pleasure, a privilege 

and a learning experience being associated with this remarkable human being, with 

his great sense of humour, steeped in the romance of living life to the full, 

always ready with a word of guidance (?Hey, Non, maybe you can modify that bass 

drum pattern a little?).

In early ?97 a low-key meeting was held at The Park 

which was to have far-reaching results. I had been visiting the hotel quite frequently 

in the capacity of a food writer and had got to know the then F amp;B manager 

Abhijit Bose, a music buff. He had dreams and plans of reviving live music on 

Park Street, in particular at Someplace Else (SPE), the pub at the hotel which 

after 11 every evening got transformed into a disco with a good selection of recorded 

music and a substantial, well-heeled clientele. 

Abhijit asked for some inputs. I had one very simple 

one. ?Hire us,? I said. ?We?ll play the classic rock of the Woodstock era. Hendrix, 

Doors, Dylan, Stones? Apart from the younger crowd, you have many regulars in 

their late 30s and 40s who now have money to spend but grew up listening to exactly 

that in college. And even the younger crowd knows the music of these icons. Only, 

give it a healthy run before deciding whether it?s working or not.?

On the last Wednesday of March 1997, Hip Pocket started 

performing at Someplace Else. There was an understanding that there would be no 

unnecessary hype in trying to make this experiment work. The music would have 

to stand up and be counted for what it was worth. We were to rely purely on word-of-mouth 

for publicity, apart from the occasional insertion in the personal column of the 

newspapers.

It worked. Today, there is live music at SPE six nights 

a week; sometimes seven. It is a buzzword with the music fraternity and with the 

listening public, countrywide, and many well-known musicians have performed there, 

and many more will perform there. To say that it is a phenomenon which even pundits 

in the entertainment and hotel industries cannot quite fathom would not be off 

the mark.

In hindsight, there can be many theories. To my mind, 

two things count. One is that the music is sincere, no strings attached. All the 

bands are seriously committed to doing as genuine a job as possible and an audience 

can always smell that. The other is the wisdom of the management in letting things 

happen in the way that they have.

For Hip Pocket, it has been over seven years and I 

am enjoying every stroke and every note as if it was Day One.

A word about the audience. Fortunately, in this neck 

of the woods, we are not blas? and cynical? We are more open and willing to share 

and party together if the essential ingredients are there. 

There must have been times of uncertainty and amateurishness 

on stage during the initial period but the audience has borne with the musicians, 

and shared in the process of making things cook. Many thanks.

 Traffic fix for township

 - Rs 2-crore blueprint eyes more cops, signals at 26 junctions

 A STAFF REPORTER

 What the august presence of ministers, bureaucrats and members of the judiciary in Salt Lake could not accomplish in all these years, two accidents near the residence of former chief minister Jyoti Basu have ? the biggest overhaul of the traffic system in recent times.

 Rattled by Monday?s accident, that left one man dead and two injured, the traffic police have put in place a Rs 2-crore-plus plan to cut down on accidents and redefine traffic management in Salt Lake. 

 The plans have been cleared on an emergency basis ? unusual by the administration?s unhurried standards ? and work is likely to begin early next year, after central funds, meant for modernisation of the police force, reach the state coffers.

 As a first step, traffic police have convened a special training session for the 500-strong drivers? force of the township?s buses, minibuses and autorickshaws. The session will be conducted at the Salt Lake stadium on January 2. Traffic engineers from the transport department, too, will attend.

 According to the blueprint, the strength of traffic police manning Salt Lake roads will be increased to 120 from the existing 12, and synchronised traffic signals will be installed at 26 junctions, identified after inspecting the traffic management system. 

 ?With the New Town flyover in place and the load set to increase, the entire traffic engineering of Salt Lake needs to be overhauled,? said Tapan Chattopadhyay, additional director-general of police (traffic). ?Certain features, including movement along the right flank, have to be changed. Physical manning of traffic movement also needs to beefed up,? he added.

 Sections of roads, the ones with dividers, will be split into lanes with marked lines that will do away with U-turns. Besides, the lanes will be aligned to direct the traffic to take a left turn. Junctions with right turns will have synchronised signals to stop traffic at least 50 yards away before allowing a turn.

 A study of the recent accidents reveals that in most cases, there was either no signal or no traffic police to man junctions.

 Traffic police will ensure a speed limit of 50 kph. Any violator will be heavily penalised. The decision comes in the wake of a string of accidents, the most serious on July 31, when at least 21 schoolchildren were injured as their bus overturned near Karunamoyee.

Stitched splendour

Smita Roy Chowdhury drops in at 

Dipanwita Hazaris Central Avenue home to learn how to collect and display 

kantha

Glimpses: (From top)

 The entrance to the bar counter has a huge embroidered piece with floral 

motifs hanging from the ceiling. This not only looks striking, it also conceals 

two rods that jut out from the right wall. 

 The small round dining table boasts a cover made with fine kantha 

stitch on an old Dhakai Jamdani sari. This is part of a set with cushion covers 

to match. 

 Koels room is done up totally in blue right from the exquisitely-embroidered 

bedspread to the curtains, carpet and walls. 

 The bedroom is aesthetically decorated with embroidered wall-hangings and 

bedspreads, which are well-coordinated with the antique wood furniture.

 The colour theme for this room is black and white with one wall coloured 

in brick red that matches 

the terracotta pieces all over the room. There are three kantha wall hangings 

on the red wall. The kantha bedspread, pillow covers, doormat and the curtains 

are all in black and white. Terracotta lampshades, a table base and other artefacts 

enhance the ethnic effect. 

You don?t need to be the proud possessor of a sprawling 

bungalow or designer furniture to live fashionably. A stitch originally used to 

make a poor man?s quilt can deck up your home in real style, provided you can 

flaunt it aesthetically. That?s precisely what Dr Dipanwita Hazari has done at 

her Central Avenue address.

Dipanwita, a gynaecologist by profession, doubles 

as a designer during her free time. Her forte is kantha stitch, but she 

dabbles in all forms of embroidery. ?I combine kantha with other embroideries 

like herring bone, Kashmiri, half-cross, lazy daisy and other basic stitches. 

I don?t think it?s possible to build a story with kantha alone,? feels 

the multi-talented lady also into medical journalism, besides modelling for print 

and television ads.

Dipanwita doesn?t remember when she laid her hands 

on the needle for the first time. ?I picked up the hobby from my mother and aunts 

when I was very small. Now it?s a passion that I can?t do without,? she says. 

Her daughter Koel (in the picture above), a student of history and a professional 

Odissi dancer, shares her hobby.

And the results of their passion are littered all 

over the Hazari household. From bedspreads, table covers, quilts, throws, cushion 

covers, TV covers, key holders, mail holders to wall hangings of various shapes 

and sizes, there?s a touch of embroidery in everything.

?I like to apply my art for practical purposes. One 

can play around a lot by using embroidery to decorate the home,? says Dipanwita.

The mother-daughter duo has also opened a boutique 

called Sandhyarag at home. 

Ethnic elegance

 To decorate your home with embroidery work, you need 

to give the entire place an ethnic flavour. ?One has to look around a lot to do 

up a house tastefully. There are a few stores with excellent ethnic d?cor like 

Anokhi, Sasha, Weavers Studio and the shops in Swabhumi which I always visit to 

observe how they have decorated the place using fabrics. I try to learn from them 

and incorporate the elements in my house,? says Dipanwita.

 The embroidered linen and decorative items must have 

a ?rhythm? with the furniture and the walls. While deciding the colour scheme 

of the embroidered pieces, one has to keep in mind the colour of the walls and 

the furniture. ?The theme has to be followed throughout the house, in harmony 

with the rest of the d?cor,? she advises.

 Decorative wall hangings made with kantha 

or other embroidery can be put to good use in case you want to cover up certain 

irreparable flaws in the house. ?Sometimes it so happens that there are certain 

structures in the house which stick out and look very odd, especially in old houses. 

You can use decorative pieces to cover them up,? she says.

 The lady of the pretty house recommends the use of 

embroidery to embellish utility items. ?In our house, we have used embroidery 

to make small utility goods like pen holders, key holders, mail trays and various 

other things. This gives an aesthetic dimension to these otherwise prosaic things 

and enhances the effect of the whole house.? 

 For buying linen or home d?cor items with embroidery, 

one has to make sure that the quality of the fabric is good. ?Always buy such 

pieces from renowned designers and don?t go for very cheap stuff. Otherwise, the 

quality of the fabric and the threads can be sub-standard. And in that case it 

will either tear or fade very fast,? warns the expert, adding that it is also 

important to check that the stitches are smooth.

Mini Mathur: Friendly fundas

 She was with them when they were flying high. She was with them when they were down in the dumps. Host Mini Mathur turned out to be the best friend for the hordes of Indian Idol aspirants. ?Nothing in my six long years of anchoring countdowns to game shows prepared me for the sheer gamut of emotions that I have experienced as the presenter of Indian Idol. From the first day that I started interacting with contestants, I realised this was going to be a journey of self-discovery for me as much as it would be for them.?

 It is the sense of belonging that has made Mini the contestants? best friend. ?I was their friend and family, a confidante, an honest voice, an elder sister. They would trust and lean on me for support when they needed it most. I would crack up on their silly nervous jokes or lend them a shoulder to cry on.? 

 Now as the show enters its final stages, Mini is ready to change roles. ?As the country gets ready to vote for their first ever Indian Idol, I look forward to my changing role from a human handkerchief to the super-glue that will hold this show together.? Watch the new Mini every Thursday and Friday at 9.30 pm on Sony?s Indian Idol.

 Karan Johar with Rani and Kareena: Lots of cheese

 If the opening round of coffee was stimulating, round two promises to be steaming. After debuting with one of the greatest screen couples of our times, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, the second episode of Koffee with Karan brings together two of the most powerful actresses of Bollywood, the ravishing Rani Mukherjee and the glamorous Kareena Kapoor.

 Sharing screen space for the first time, the three exchange banter, gossip and emotions for 60 minutes of good television. At his wittiest best, Karan dissolves the wall of formality and gets the two guests to spill the beans, with Kareena admitting: ?We are not the best of friends but she (Rani) has always been there and plays a major role in my life.?

 The real show-stealer, as in the first episode, is the rapid-fire round where Karan fires a volley of questions at Rani and Kareena. This round throws up numerous tongue-in-cheek moments, especially when Kareena is asked to choose between Shahid and Shah Rukh and Rani asked to choose between Yash Chopra and Sanjay Leela Bhansali. 

 The costumes for the guests have been designed exclusively by ace designer Manish Malhotra and lending a stylish chic look to the sets is Bollywood?s leading production designer Sharmishta Roy. So Friday at 10 pm, catch the two future forces of Bollywood who appeared together in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and Yuva but could never fit into the same frame. 

 It?s been three years since the fateful September day when the Twin Towers crumbled in New York. A lot has happened from then on but what happened inside the American Airlines flights that crashed into the tower has remained the subject of conjecture. 

 Discovery Channel adds graphic details to the speculations with its show The Last Hour of Flight 11, that premieres on Tuesday at 9 pm. A pulse-pounding countdown recreates the voyage from the moment the passengers were boarding Flight 11, to the split-second before the plane hit the tower. 

 The minutes unfold from the perspectives of various key people involved, including the terrorists on the aircraft, the hostesses making the frantic phone calls to the ground, the ground control at Logan International airport trying to reach the craft? It?s an open invitation to relive the moments in midair, that shook the world?s most powerful nation.

 The Oscars may be in their 77th year but closer home, the BFJA Awards are into their 67th. And unlike the Academy Awards, here the winners have been declared beforehand and there is no such formality like a nomination. So after the Bachchan brigade and the Rani-Ajay celebrations last year who are the winners this year?

 There are no big surprises in the Tollywood list of the Hero honda BFJA Awards, with Prosenjit and Rituparna winning the Best Actor and Best Actress awards and the Best Film and Best Director being bagged by Abar Aranye. 

 The Bollywood section is a mixed bag with Sanjay Dutt expectedly winning the Best Actor award for Munnabhai MBBS but the Best Actress being given to Manisha Koirala for Escape To Taliban may raise a few eyebrows. 

 While Munnabhai also wins the Best Film, the year?s Best Director goes to Prakash Jha for Gangaajal. Arshad Warsi and Shabana Azmi are the winners in the supporting categories.

 As for the naacha-gaana at the Salt Lake stadium on November 27, it?s over to the Tolly trio of Koneenica, June and Locket Chatterjee who will present a special item in true Charlie?s Angels style. The musical tribute to Lifetime Achievement winner Gulzar will be given by the talented husband-wife duo of Roop Kumar Rathod and Sonali Rathod.

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You?re 

calm and composed, a thinker and a good organiser. Research is your forte. You 

have a sharp memory for faces. Check laziness. You?d want your spouse to assist 

you in professional work. You feel strongly for the weak and oppressed. Periodic 

introspection is necessary. ? Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Debut by elite cop corps

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Special Action Force, a new commando unit to combat terrorist threats, is all set to be added to the city police force. 

 The unit will start operations next week, after a formal inaugural programme, attended by commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee.

 The police brass decided to start the wing following the terrorist attack in front of American Center in 2001. 

 The force will comprise 66 policemen, who have recently returned from Haryana after National Security Guard (NSG) training.

 ?The commandos will wear grey uniforms, and will be armed with automatic and semi-automatic weapons. They have been trained to handle any sort of crisis created by terrorists,? said Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 The members of SAF will carry weapons like the 5.56 mm INSAS rifle, 7.62 mm SLR, sub-machine carbines and 9 mm pistols.

 ?The policemen in the wing have completed the 12-week Police Commando Instructors? Course and are now equipped to work in any field,? deputy commissioner Kumar said.

 Apart from elaborate weapons training, the members of the new unit have been instructed in field craft, assault, cordon and search, systemic patrolling, static and mobile duty at vital installations and VIP security.

 ?The force will be used whenever its services are required,? said a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters. ?Keeping an eye on terrorist attacks across the country in the recent past, we may use the force to provide security in the Assembly House area while it is in session.?

 Kumar said that the elite force would not be used for routine jobs.

 ?The unit will be kept ready round-the-clock at Police Training School. The moment we perceive any threat from terrorist outfits, it will be called in,? Kumar added. ?If necessary, we may escort a VIP?s convoy with the help of these men or deploy them in front of vital installations.?

 Elaborating on the SAF?s efficiency, another senior officer said: ?The unit members are sharp shooters. They will function differently from other policemen. 

 ?If terrorists enter an office building or school, the force will function as an NSG unit. They will cordon the area and strike. The men are specially trained to deal with hostage situations, and are equipped to rescue hostages from the clutches of terrorists while ensuring that the innocent are not harmed.?

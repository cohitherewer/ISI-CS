 New twist to quota seats

 - SC Notice to state

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The controversy over admission of medical students through the non-resident Indian (NRI) quota took a fresh turn on Monday, with the Supreme Court issuing a notice to state chief secretary Ashok Gupta.

 The notice has been issued on a petition seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against him for the alleged violation of the court order directing the state government to limit to 30 the NRI quota in SSKM Hospital and Midnapore Medical College.

 A bench, comprising Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justice P.P. Naolekar, issued the notice on a contempt petition after hearing counsel Sanjeeb Sen and Mukul Rohodgi for the petitioners ? a group of successful candidates of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), 2003. 

 When contacted on Monday evening, chief secretary Gupta said he had not received the contempt notice.

 The Supreme Court on October 29 had directed the state government to cut down the number of NRI-quota students from 50 per cent to 15 per cent of the total available seats.

 The two medical colleges set up by the state government, with a total of 200 seats, had admitted 104 students under the NRI quota and the state had even put up a plea before the high court, justifying the high fees charged on the grounds that it was to give some respite from the financial crisis faced by the state. 

 The 104 students, screened from 1,300 through an entrance test, had forked out Rs 9.24 lakh each for an MBBS seat under the NRI quota at SSKM Hospital or Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. 

 On September 29, however, Calcutta High Court nullified the entire process, instructing that the seats be allocated to successful JEE candidates of that year.

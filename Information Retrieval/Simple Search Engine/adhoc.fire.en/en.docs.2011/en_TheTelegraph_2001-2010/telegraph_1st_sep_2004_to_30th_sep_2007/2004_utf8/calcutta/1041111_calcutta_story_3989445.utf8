 Tradition of centuries, shaped by own hand

 With just two days to go before Kali puja, it was crisis time for the Basu family. Due to a squabble that year, one son had decided to hold the puja separately. With him, lay the goddess? falchion. So the other brother?s family was undecided how to carry out the animal sacrifice at its puja. ?The next morning, a stranger knocked at our door, saying he would do the job. He said he had seen our idol in a dream and had been searching around for our house for three days on his bicycle.?

 Debaprasad Basu turns to the six-foot idol, blood-red tongue gleaming against the blackness, in his Jadavpur house and touches his clasped hands to his forehead.

 The goddess at the Basu family is special, both for personal and historical reasons. 

 ?Our puja is about 550 years old. We were residents of Karapara village in Khulna district. My publisher-father (owner of Prakashmandir, at 3, College Row) had drawn a family tree by consulting history books that showed Raja Pratapaditya of Jessore, one of the 12 bhuniyas, to have married a daughter to one Bidyananda Kabiraj, our ancestor,? he rattles off without a pause.

 The 72-year-old has every reason to be tired, having spent the past few days giving the last touches to the idol that he shapes with his own hands. ?Not a single thing the Mother is wearing is bought from the market. The crown, the decorations ? he has done it all himself,? says neighbour Jayanti Ganguly, who comes over to lend a hand with the preparations.

 Kali has been Basu?s obsession since childhood. ?In our Khulna home, I used make a goddess, worship her and immerse the idol ? all by myself ? when neighbourhood boys would be busy with outdoor games.? 

 In 1949 an idol made by the 12-year-old Basu was worshipped for the first time in the family. ?My father and uncle had already crossed over to India. It was just me and my grandmother doing the puja.?

 Basu recalls his grandmother to have been an exceptional lady ?strong-willed and extremely devout. ?In those days, the Ansar Bahini (East Pakistan police) was a terror. Those men did not hesitate to undress women and loot their ornaments. My grandmother managed to hoodwink them and carry the falchion and the ghot all by herself across the border,? Basu says.

 These two are still used at the puja while the stranger who landed up at the doorstep years ago ? Nitai Mukherjee, a telephone exchange employee now superannuated ? still comes for the hatchet job.

 The priest who worships the goddess has to seek permission from the family guru, Swami Gahananandaji Maharaj of Ramakrishna Math and Mission. ?Only the guru or his representative can worship our idol.?

 This year, a Rudra Yagna will happen as well, since Basu has received such an order in a dream. ?This puja is famous here. So many people have gifted ornaments to the Mother. Five sacrifices will take place this time, of which three have been pledged by outsiders whose prayers have been answered,? says son Jyotirmoy.

 Rs 5.5 cr to restore Minerva 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) took over and reopened Star theatre, it?s now the state government?s turn to announce that it will spend Rs 5.5 crore to renovate and reopen another hall in north Calcutta ? Minerva theatre, on Beadon Street. 

 About six months ago, the state government had taken over the theatre through the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). Like Star theatre, Minerva, too, is a heritage building. 

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya held a meeting with senior officials of his department on Thursday and decided to reopen the theatre after renovating it. 

 Bhattacharya and mayor Subrata Mukherjee visited Minerva theatre on Thursday and inspected the hall, closed 10 years ago.

 Bhattacharya said at Writers? Buildings that the CMDA will spend Rs 1 crore to renovate the hall, while the CMC will provide Rs 1.05 crore to run its air-conditioning system. Local parliamentarian Sudhanshu Sil will contribute Rs 1 crore from his local area development (LAD) fund, and the remaining Rs 2 crore will be provided by the information and culture department of the state government.

 The minister said architect Dulal Mukherjee was being consulted for renovating the heritage hall.

 ?We are trying to get expert opinion by January and plan to start the renovation work by March. It will take a year to complete the project,? Bhattacharya signed off.

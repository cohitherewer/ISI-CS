A little after the guests had settled comfortably 

into their seats (or managed to find a place to stand in the crowd) and started 

feasting their eyes on the drama on the ramp, the much-awaited Satya Paul show 

came to an end!

The fashion extravaganza on the Taj Bengal lawns late 

on Wednesday lasted all of 30 minutes, packed with four collections of apparels 

and drapes paraded by some of the hottest pirouetting beauties in the land.

?We deliberately made the show as short as possible 

so that the guests leave with the feeling that they wanted to see some more,? 

said Anu Ahuja, choreographer of the show.

Organised by Marwar magazine in association 

with Emami and Jamin Jewellery Exports, To Kolkata With Love was the second Satya 

Paul showcase in the city in three months. After its hugely-applauded Think Pink 

show in October, the design house unveiled four of its latest lines on Wednesday 

night.

The classy do started off with celebrity hosts Shobhaa 

and Dilip De talking about their association with Calcutta. While Shobhaa spoke 

mostly in English with some Bengali words thrown in (like ?amaar swami Dilip)?, 

her husband recalled his experiences in the city in chaste Bengali. The duo even 

paid a tribute to Tagore by reciting poem no. 44 from Gitanjali.

The show, which according to designer Puneet Nanda 

paid a ?tribute to the incomparable Indian woman?, started with a line of very 

ornate lehngas and soon moved on to saris inspired by the paintings of 

European masters Pollock, Rothko, Gustav and Klimt.

A range of saris influenced by animal prints, also 

in lighter fabrics like georgettes and crepes, and the next collection with a 

dream-like effect in combinations of spartan whites with silver and black with 

golden, were the show stealers.

Short cocktail dresses, churidar with strapless 

kameez and saris in flowing fabrics followed the same theme. ?It?s couture, 

but very simple and elegant. The saris, dresses and salwars are ideal occasion 

wear for Indian women,? said Nanda.

Ornate heavily-embroidered lehngas in 

colours of gems were thrown in between the other collections throughout the show. 

Here the hues were vibrant ? ruby red, turquoise, emerald, topaz and much more.

The catwalkers who sashayed down the ramp included 

Noyonika Chatterjee Singh, Tapur Chatterjee, Jesse Randhawa, Shonal Rawat, Dippanita 

Sharma, Fleur Xavier, Gauhar Khan, Sayali Bhagat, Jyoti Brahmin, Sanjukta Das 

and Jessica Gomes.

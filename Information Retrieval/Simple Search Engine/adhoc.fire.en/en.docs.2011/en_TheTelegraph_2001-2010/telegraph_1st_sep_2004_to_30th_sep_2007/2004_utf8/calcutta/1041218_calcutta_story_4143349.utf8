 Fasting students fall ill, supporters caned

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nine agitating medical students of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research and Midnapore Medical College fell ill at SSKM Hospital on Friday as their indefinite hunger strike continued for the fourth day.

 ?We had to be admitted to SSKM?s Woodburn ward in the morning. We suffered abdominal pain, cramps, hypoglycaemia and dehydration,? said Garima Sarawgi. 

 Subrata Nag, who is still in a serious condition, has been put on intravenous drip. The rest opted for glucose.

 This development prompted the medical students to shift strategy and convert the hunger strike into a relay fast. ?From Thursday night, 15 more of us have started fasting. They will replace those of us who had to be hospitalised today,? Sarawgi added.

 The college authorities, however, shrugged off all responsibility for the agitation. 

 ?We have received no fresh directive from the state government on the agitating students. Nothing has been done to make them call off the hunger strike. Some of them are falling ill and are receiving due medical attention,? said SSKM campus institute director Prabir Kumar Sur. 

 Forms for the 69 vacated seats, which were being distributed from Thursday, will be made available to candidates after 2 pm on Saturday too, and the selection process will start from 3 pm, he added.

 ?There will be spot admissions and classes for the 69 new students will commence from Monday,? Sur said.

 A snap demonstration by Chhatra Parishad supporters in front of the north gate of the Assembly in the afternoon was lathicharged and dispersed by the police.

 The demonstrators were demanding the immediate reinstatement of the 69 NRI-quota students. Four of the demonstrators suffered head injuries and had to be treated at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, before being taken to the central lockup. 

 Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) said 22 activists, including two women, had been arrested, though he denied knowledge of the lathicharge.

 According to Chandrima Mukherjee, whose daughter Debarati is among the fasting students, some guardians met Congress MLA Atish Sinha and requested him to take up the matter in the Assembly.

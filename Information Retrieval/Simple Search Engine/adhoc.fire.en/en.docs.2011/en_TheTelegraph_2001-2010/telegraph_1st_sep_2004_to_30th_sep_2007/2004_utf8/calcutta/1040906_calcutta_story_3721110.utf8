The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Delay frown for flyover

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Either wind up the project by December or face the music.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya fired this salvo at the contractor building the Sonarpur flyover and officials of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), entrusted with supervising the project.

 On a prod from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the minister and a host of CMDA officials visited Sonarpur on Saturday to monitor the progress of work.

 The flyover, coming up near the railway station, was scheduled to be completed in June 2000. 

 The public works department had taken up the Rs 16-crore project in 1997, but could not make much progress. 

 The government then roped in the CMDA.

 Annoyed over the delay, the chief minister has asked Bhattacharya to personally monitor the work and ensure its completion by the year-end.

 A lot of hurdles were encountered, including problems in acquisition of land and the hazards of working in a congested area. Still, the project should have been over much earlier. We have taken some serious steps to complete it as soon as possible, minister Bhattacharya said.

 I have made it clear to the CMDA officials and the contractor that I will not hear any further excuse. I hope the deadline will be met, he added. 

 Bhattacharya also reviewed the state of drinking water supply in the area. The CMDA has taken up a project to augment supply.

 The population in and around Sonarpur has been rapidly increasing. Following the extension of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass to Sonarpur, an increasing number of people are opting to move into the area. We are taking all steps to provide the basic amenities to the people, the minister asserted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Puja smiles amp; scowls

 The best time of the year? The 

 five days that make up for the rest 360? The only thing 

 sad about it is that it?s too short? The Puja plaudits flow 

 thick and fast, from young and old, from up close and afar.

 Here are five of our favourite 

 things?

 Freedom

 Tell 

 your folks you?ll be back home at dawn and live to tell 

 the tale, with a smile. For, Lady Liberty rules during the 

 Pujas. Devi Durga brings with her freedom from the shackles 

 of limits and controls. There are no deadlines or curfews, 

 no school or college. Just friends, family, fun and frolic. 

 Staying out all night, just for this one week in the year 

 is the norm, not a no-no. Pandal or party-hopping, there 

 are very few questions asked, with adults too busy keeping 

 up with the activities on their own social calendars to 

 wonder what the youngsters are up to. So, be out from sunset 

 to sunrise, with midnight adda and sundry forbidden 

 pleasures tossed in.

 Food

 Phuchkas 

 at 2 am at Vivekananda Park, khichuri and payesh 

 at the para puja at 1 pm, luchi and kosha 

 mangsho at home at 6 pm, chilli chicken and chowmein 

 at Bagbazar at 11 pm? Anything, anytime, anywhere ? that?s 

 the fun munch menu during the Pujas. And for once, you don?t 

 have to go looking for junk food, junk food comes looking 

 for you. With pavements turning into five-night food courts, 

 there?s just no stopping this gravy train ? calorie count 

 and digestive dilemmas be damned.

 Fashion

 The 

 glitter of gold and the shimmer of silver, sexy in a sari 

 or trendy in trousers, spending is the name of the game, 

 with a licence to dress to kill (those who foot your fashion 

 bill) and thrill (your date, old or new).

 Come rain or shine, heat or humidity, there?s no stopping the shopping before the Pujas and no slowing down the fashion parade during the Pujas. The men in ethnic wear may steal some of their thunder, but the five days definitely belong to the women and their couture clout.

 Flirting

 The 

 first look, the furtive glance, the love track in the background, 

 the romance in the air? What?s festivity without your heart 

 being in it? So many have found their life partners at the 

 Puja mandap but so many more just have magical memories 

 of the five-day flame that burned so bright in the autumn 

 night. From Maddox Square to Laboni, Jodhpur Park to College 

 Square, a little bit of love is all around. Most last five 

 days, a few last a lifetime, but ?no flirting, no festivities? 

 remains the anthem for little hearts.

 Feel good

 The 

 city that goes to bed by 10 pm on a normal night is awash 

 in sight and sounds 24x5 during Durga Puja. The enthusiasm 

 is unputdownable, the energy levels astounding. As people 

 troop in from far and wide to glimpse the goddess and praise 

 the pandals, creativity is on an overdrive and camaraderie 

 at an all-year high. Strangers become friends and families 

 bond better than ever. Long live this feel-good factor!

 Wonderful though the Pujas may 

 be, the festive fiesta can be a real nuisance for some. 

 For those tormented souls among us, who also didn?t have 

 the foresight to plan a holiday and skip town, here are 

 our five pet peeves:

 Muscle power

 ?Chanda 

 na diley dekhe nebo?? The familiar line of fear plagues 

 several pockets of the city in the run-up to the Pujas. 

 Forced subscription from para clubs is a way of life 

 ? and even death ? in places with few willing to risk bonhomie 

 or bones by taking their complaint to the cops. Wanted: 

 festival without fear.

 Crowd crib

 Nothing, 

 just nothing, can make being jostled by all shapes and sizes 

 a pleasant experience. Nothing, just nothing, can compensate 

 for the hours spent stuck in traffic wherever you go. Leave 

 the solitude and safety of four walls, and WHAM! Cars, buses, 

 autos, ticking taxi metres, no-entry signs, and, worst of 

 all, the crowd. Which takes us to the next point.

 Teaser torment

 Crowds 

 wouldn?t be half as bad if they didn?t include so many people. 

 People who touch and feel and look and leer. Being crushed 

 between bodies ? whether it is at a pandal, or in a bus 

 or the Metro ? standing in serpentine queues, waiting in 

 endless jams, all add up to the perfect recipe for a little 

 bit of unwanted gaping and groping. No matter what you do 

 or where you are, there will be some men who just can?t 

 keep their hands to themselves or their foul mouths shut.

 Pothole peril

 If 

 navigating the city in the sea of celebration isn?t daunting 

 enough, the potholed splendour makes it all but non-negotiable. 

 Even judicial intervention could not change the ground reality 

 in cratered Calcutta, pre-Pujas. With the first set of ravaged 

 roads (CMDA-controlled) to be repaired only by end-October, 

 brace for a roller-coaster, bone-jarring, nerve-wracking 

 ride. Add to that the crumbling pavements and you have reason 

 enough to keep the first-aid kit handy to deal with bruises, 

 cuts and sprains.

 Emergency failure

 Cross 

 your fingers or pray (to the Devi, who else?) that no loved 

 one is taken ill during the festive days. From getting the 

 patient to hospital to getting him treated can be a trip 

 to hell and back as medical emergency takes a backseat. 

 Ambulances stuck in Ashtami traffic, nurse on Nabami leave, 

 doctors on Dashami ?duty?? Wanted: Durga Puja with a safety 

 net.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Save-green army vs space-jam cops 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Battleground: The 

Maidan. 

In Green corner: 

Indian Army. 

In Red corner: 

Calcutta Police.

 The army and police are bracing for a bruising showdown over the city?s most defining stretch of green.

 If Fort William is zealously trying to prevent a replay of last year, when 7,000 saplings were crushed by crowds and cars on the Maidan, Lalbazar is desperate for parking space on the green during major events on and off Red Road.

 The army has already erected a barbed wire fencing in the Maidan area to prevent police from allowing car parking and damaging the green.

 The pet police peeve: with no other space left for parking, how do we manage crowds during cricket matches at Eden Gardens and religious festivals in the area?

 Case in point: the India-Pakistan tie, when most cars with yellow stickers could not be given parking space near the Maidan.

 Sanjoy Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), all but threw up his hands when quizzed about the strained relationship between the two agencies.

 ?I have written three letters to the army (July 30, September 13 and November 9), but they have not bothered to reply to even one of them,? alleged Mukherjee.

 Senior army officers, however, refuted the charges, saying most of the barbed wires the police had objected to have been removed. The army had put up barbed wires on certain stretches of the Maidan after planting about 7,000 saplings.

 ?Even last year, all the flowering trees were trampled by people, who seemed to have no idea about environment and how precious the trees are on the Maidan. We were only doing our bit to save the city from further pollution,? observed an army spokesman.

 Despite removal of several barbed-wire fences by the army, police are left with no choice but to turn the entire stretch along Red Road into a huge parking lot for the India-South Africa Test match that gets underway from November 28 at Eden Gardens.

 On Thursday, around 100 cars had to be parked on Red Road as the barbed wires around the Mohun Bagan club forced Chhat puja devotees to walk all the way from Red Road to the Hooghly after crossing Strand Road. ?The problem will grow when the Ganga Sagar pilgrims start to camp in the area,? said a police officer.

 In end-October, the army allegedly delayed giving permission for Id prayers to be offered on Red Road, police said.

 The army spokesman said the letter seeking permission, that reached them on October 28, ?did not have any specific details of the requirements? and was not clear. ?When they clarified the points, we gave them the nod on November 3. Everything was then settled smoothly,? he added.

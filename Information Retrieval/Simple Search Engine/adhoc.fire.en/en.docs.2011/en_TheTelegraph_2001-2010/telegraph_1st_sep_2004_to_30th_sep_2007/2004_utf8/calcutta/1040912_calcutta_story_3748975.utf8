The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Next weekend you can be at... BORONTI

Imagine a lake, surrounded by hills covered with thick 

vegetation. If this is your idea of a retreat, then Boronti is the place to be. 

And it?s close enough to stop by for the weekend for some much-needed rest.

The best way to visit Boronti is to take a night train 

to Adra. From there, a local train will take you towards Asansol, through the 

rugged landscape of Purulia, past the towering cliffs of Jaichandi, to the sleepy 

station of Muradi. From Muradi, you can take a jeep or a leisurely but bumpy rickshaw 

ride to Boronti.

The rickshaw trundles through the village of Gangpur, 

past a craggy horizon dotted with hills. A blue line in the distance eventually 

turns out to be a large lake. The rickshaw passes over an embankment before finally 

dropping you off at the Akashmani Resort.

Nikhil Roy, the caretaker, will welcome you with hot 

cups of tea and you will soon be enjoying breakfast on the balcony of the bungalow 

enclosed on all sides by shegun, shishu, palash, mohua 

and other trees.

The resort has no electricity, so don?t expect luxury. 

After breakfast, you can take a stroll through the village. The road meanders 

past beautifully decorated mud houses. After a bath at the resort (the more adventurous 

can opt for a dip in the lake), dig into a wholesome meal of bhaat, dal 

and alu-posto. 

Evening is the perfect time to stroll along the embankment 

of the lake. Sunsets are spectacular as the fiery ball dips behind a hill on the 

western shores of the lake, streaking the water and sky with a riot of colours.

The lake is a haven for bird watchers and during winter 

(which is an ideal time to visit this pocket), several species of migratory birds 

can be spotted. Spring, too, is a good season, when the palash blooms, 

turning the entire region into a sea of red.

If you?re in the mood for solitude (or romance) then 

stick around to admire the natural splendour of the star-studded night sky. You 

can even spot the occasional meteorite, shooting through the entire length of 

the sky (giving you ample time to complete your wish).

Next morning, hike up Dandahit Hill with the help 

of a local guide. It overlooks the resort and is adorned with dense vegetation. 

There are several paths leading to the top and you could try different combinations 

by going up one way and coming down another. The hilltop offers a breathtaking 

view of the lake and the rugged landscape that surrounds it.

The evening can be spent by the lake, or if you are 

willing to walk some more, take a trip to the nearby village, famous for flower 

cultivation.

Next morning, it?s time to head home, back to the 

hustle and the bustle. But taking a break at Boronti could make the tedium more 

tolerable ? for a few weeks at least.

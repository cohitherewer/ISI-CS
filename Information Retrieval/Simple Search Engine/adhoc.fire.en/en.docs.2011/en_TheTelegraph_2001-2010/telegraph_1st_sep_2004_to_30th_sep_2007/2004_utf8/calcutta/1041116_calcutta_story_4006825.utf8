The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Perfect platform for a passion literary

 - Little 

magazine takes a big step

 RAJRUPA GHOSH

 Earlier, they wrote only about the drudgery of everyday life. Now, it?s all about Amlashol, war on terrorism or cinema.

 Earlier, the letter press was the only way out. Now, there?s a wonder called DTP.

 Earlier, someone who could draw would merely paint a picture. Now, there are graphic designers and layout artists.

 With changes and revolutions in a small way, the little magazine business is now all set to make it big. And the Annual Little Magazine Exhibition and Utsab, to be kicked off on November 18, will be the just-right platform to say it loud.

 ?Each year, this festival brings together special issues or Puja numbers from various districts of West Bengal and other states as well,? said Nabakumar Seal, secretary of Little Magazine Editors? Association, organisers of the event. 

 ?This year, we will have participants from 17 districts. Over 400 books have already been handed over to us for display at the exhibition at Nehru Children?s Museum,? he added.

 The four-day exhibition is like a mini book fair for the participants. ?There are many who travel long distances for the event. Though we cannot give them any money or reimburse their expenses, they never fail to turn up. It?s a meeting of similar minds, for whom literature is a passion,? explained Seal.

 The little magazine concept has been associated with much emotion and imagination, rather than sponsors or money. Fanatics have been known to sell off wedding rings and family jewellery to raise money for literary causes. 

 While they keep regular jobs ? in banks, government offices, schools and colleges ? they are loathe to abandon their passion.

 For, the quintessential intellectual babu, clutching his cha-er bhaar and dragging on his hand-made cigarette, would not be complete without a little magazine or two peeping out of his jhola. 

 ?We try our best, despite financial problems,? said Seal, optimistic about the way the passion is being refuelled these days.

 The little magazine movement draws its new energy from the changes sweeping over the social scenario. ?The movement was stagnating a decade ago. But now, we have a good crop of young writers, bubbling with creativity and contemporary ideas. Helping them are experienced people, some who have been associated with literature for the past 50 years. This healthy balance will take us far,? said a hopeful Seal.

 His eyes are focussed on making the festival a success and also drawing in mainstream audience. A day after the festival kicks off, a seminar on the relevance and responsibility of little magazines in contemporary literature will be organised. 

 The inauguration will be attended by poet Nirendranath Chakraborty and author Samaresh Majumdar, among others.

 Music recitals, kobita-gaan (music with strong roots in poetry), recitation, story-reading sessions are among the events lined up.

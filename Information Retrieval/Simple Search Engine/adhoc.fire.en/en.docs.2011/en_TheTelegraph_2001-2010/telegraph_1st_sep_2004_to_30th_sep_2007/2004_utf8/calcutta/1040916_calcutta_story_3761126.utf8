 Where the shoe pinches

 The poor and weaker sections of our society have always been an oppressed lot. Though we make lofty claims that our rural poor now have equal opportunities in life, the truth is far from this. Shohan?s play, Juto, directed by Anish Ghosh, poignantly bears out this unfortunate condition of the poverty-stricken, downtrodden classes. The play tells us the story of Katu, a poor villager, whose greatest wish is to possess a pair of expensive, fashionable shoes. After much difficulty, he finally manages to buy a pair, but at the cost of giving up his only valuable asset. However, his prized possession is snatched away from him by the so-called disciplinarians of society, the policeman and the zamindar, on the pretext that he is too lowly a man to wear such wonderful shoes. A satire blended with generous doses of humour, Juto clearly brings to focus the hypocrisy and utter callousness of the upper classes in cheating and exploiting the poor. Also being staged is Srutirangam?s Tumi Kaar, directed and performed by Paran Bandyopadhyay.

 New Year nite to remember

Shun the popular public haunts and bid 

04 goodbye in your own style, with fun tips from Sangita Sultania G. 

Roy

 Do 

 Decide on a theme for your bash so 

that it?s different from a regular party 

 Set up a barbecue on your terrace or lawns Make the lighting and decorations 

jazzy

 Don?t 

 Dish out an elaborate menu ? simple 

and light food that can be cooked fast should do 

 This is for those who have better sense than to pay four-figure cover charges to be herded into night haunts hawking New Year cheer. Add to that an F amp;B bill with a colossal mark-up and you end up trading your Christmas allowance for virtually non-existent leg ? and breathing ? space.

Why not take a break and conjure up just your own 

kind of do ? people, food, liquor, music, elbow room and more ? for a private 

party to remember well into the New Year? The trick is to do it differently from 

everybody else, but here are a few pointers to help you along?

 Theme for a dream

 It?s a brand new year you?ve gathered to cheer, so the party?s going to be different from a regular bash, right? A couple of movers and shakers in town are known to trade their virtuous New Year resolutions for rather sinful sojourns on the last day of the year, replete with exotic dancers and strip-tease shows.

 While raunchy numbers like a backless dress code may or may not go down well with every guest?s wardrobe wishlist, a masquerade dance party or mistletoe headgear as theme is the kind of harmless fun anybody with a sense of humour should dig. It?s all a part of the Christmas package, so if there are going to be little invitees to the party, there?s nothing like the host acting as the benevolent Santa with maybe the kids dressing up like huge stockings!

Your imagination may run riot, but relevant gear may 

be hard to come by. If the do-it spirit doesn?t burn as bright as that flamb? 

cocktail, you can take recourse to event managers like The Dream Merchants (9831039332) 

or scour the shops on Free School Street selling colourful birthday, Christmas 

and cartoon character decorations.

 Light and sound fury

 What?s a New Year?s party without all that jazz? If you?ve been able to hit upon a relevant theme, half your problem is taken care of.

 Next, electric shops of Park Circus, Beckbagan, Sarat Bose Road, Free School Street and Bhawanipore areas can be approached for hiring lights as well as the sound required for a rocking party. A. Khan amp; Co. in Beckbagan is one of the oldest sound-and-light stops in town. The basic gear of two top JBL or Peavey speakers for high-pitched sound, a low speaker for the bass, six par 64 basic lights, two effect lights, two strobes and one smoke machine will see you bid goodbye to a good Rs 15,000 and more.

 The same gear costs one-third the amount at other times of the year, but prices shoot up like crazy for Christmas and New Year. And size does matter. Something of the scale of the BTP party at Nalban would see you ending the year a good Rs 3/4 lakh lighter.

Roping in a DJ pal for a big bash or bullying the 

electronic geeks in the gang to do the needful are other ways to go about it.

Music mix

 ?This year was the year of Hindi remixes,? says DJ Saranjit of Incognito. If you go by popular verdict then Dhoom, Sajna ve sajna, It?s the time to disco and Bin tere sanam should rule your 31st night party. The friendly DJ advises a warm-up session with a retro set early in the evening as the guests start to trickle in. Lounge, classic rock, reggae and pop (Read: Clapton, Doors, Dire Straits, Bob Marley?) is also good to start off with.

 owly build up the tempo with hip-hop and some R amp;B, followed by remixes, before riding the high wave of techno, trance and house. Some disco and funk in between provide welcome relief.

 Again, this is the pattern they follow in the discos. It?s quite safe to stick to this if you have a large bash in mind, but for a small gathering with friends it would be more fun to trade the formula for your kind of funk.

If you still don?t know your rhythm, Turn me on 

by Kevin Little, Get busy by Shaun Paul, Where is the love by 

Black Eyed Peas, Sultans of swing by Dire Straits, Roadhouse blues and 

LA woman by Doors, One love, Waiting in vain, I shot the 

sheriff by Bob Marley, Layla by Clapton, Tarzan boy by Baltimora, 

Wherever whenever by Shakira, Naughty girl by Beyonce, Dirty 

by Christina Aguilera are some of the sure-shot party tracks. 

 Food faves

 If you haven?t yet had a barbecue this season, a New Year?s bash is a good excuse. If you are blessed with a terrace or a lawn, a sizzling bonfire is all you need to get things going. Blanched vegetables for salads and half-done kebabs to be roasted as and when required, are some of the staples.

 ?Food should be simple and light in a New Year?s party,? feels Navin Pai of Coffee Pai. He swears by Indian khana and recommends a roomali roti hand to warm things up. ?This should be accompanied by yellow dal instead of kali dal, as it is lighter,? stresses Navin.

 Peta bread with dips and lots of munchies in the form of fresh cucumbers and radishes is the way to avoid a hangover. The idea is to keep yourself hydrated. To ensure that the party is as enjoyable for the host as for the guests, you need to cook up a menu that requires as little preparation time as possible. You can always get a catering guy to do the needful, but then, it?s never the same.

Lots of exotic fruits and desserts like strawberries, 

kiwis and sponge cakes should be the last word in a delightful New Year?s spread. 

Here also, you can add that special touch by stuffing ice-cream in between two 

layers of sponge cake and serving it topped with a colourful fruit. 

 In high spirits

 The last day of the year is a good time to make the right first impression. Welcome your guests with small shots served in funky test tubes or khullars ? anything that helps make a style statement!

 There is plenty of room for innovation behind the bar, offers Irrfan. Live flamb?ed Irish and Jamaican coffees are good fun to start off with, but that, of course, requires the services of a professional bartender. On an average, a bartender for the 31st night will charge something between Rs 3,000 and 4,000. Intoxication (9339798148) is one such organisation you can approach if you want to hire the services of a bartender. But if you want to shake it up yourself, bartender Irrfan has some mixes up his sleeve. ?The idea is to do it in style. Sangrias or wine coolers served with fresh fruit juices in silver cups is bound to kick off the festive fervour if nothing else will,? he says.

 At the other end of the spectrum is mulled wine, which is served piping hot with whole garam masala, honey and a dash of lemon, quite apt for what promises to be a cold New Year?s Eve. Tequila shots, premium scotch, a good selection of cigars, a bottle of champagne and you have a bash as expansive as a star effort.

That?s not to say you can?t have fun on a tight budget. 

Conversations that dangle into the next year, friendships made or renewed, fun 

had in the right spirit? it can all add up to a 31st Nite to remember.

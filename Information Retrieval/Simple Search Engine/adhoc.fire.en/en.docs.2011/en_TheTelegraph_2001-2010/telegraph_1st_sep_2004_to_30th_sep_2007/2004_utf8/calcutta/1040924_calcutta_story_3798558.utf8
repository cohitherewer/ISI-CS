The main hurdle in staging The Vagina Monologues 

was to find the cast as many women shied away

 My vagina. A live, wet, watery village. My vagina, my hometown.

 Controversy is an appendage The Vagina Monologues carries wherever it goes. Early this year, it was banned in Chennai but was staged to packed houses in Mumbai and Delhi. It?s now Calcutta?s turn to host a local version of American author Eve Ensler?s (extreme left, with Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal and Marisa Tomei, in picture above) seminal play.

 Her Stories, conceived and directed by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee, is a collage of Ensler?s Monologues to be acted out by a seven-woman cast at Crossword on September 29.

 The team comprising Odissi dancer Alokananda Roy, stage actress Poonam Singh, film-makers Sudeshna Roy and Anindita Sarbadhicari, actresses Deboleena Dutta and June, and entrepreneur Renu Roy will read and enact seven well-knit monologues from the play, translated into 35 languages.

 With this production, the seven from Calcutta join the likes of Cate Blanchett, Brooke Shields, Oprah Winfrey, Susan Sarandon, Salma Hayek, Kylie Minogue and several others who have enacted the roles over the years across the globe. The Monologues was staged in Mumbai and Delhi in March 2004.

 Through her interviews with 200 women, Ensler recounts how women come to terms with their sexuality and also physical abuse. Sujoy?s script has touched upon varied themes like pubescent days, love, motherhood, rape and lesbianism. 

 ?The main hurdle in staging the Monologues was to find an appropriate cast as many women I had approached turned down the project,? says Sujoy, echoing the problem faced by Mody-Kotwal in Mumbai.

 But those who have taken the plunge are all excited about it. ?I will read about a woman who hated her vagina. Then she meets a man who makes her appreciate it and fall in love with it. I didn?t have a problem taking up the project. Often women pretend that some parts of their body do not exist,? says Anindita.

The founding members of Strings spoke on Calcutta, 

on making music, on cultural relations between India and Pakistan and more, before 

taking the St Xavier?s College stage...

The city

There is something about Calcutta. It?s filled with 

down-to-earth people. Be it a driver or a salesperson, they go out of their way 

to make you feel comfortable. It?s a very musical city as well that has produced 

so many legends.

The band

Strings was formed in 1989 with four members. We recorded 

two albums before disbanding in 1992 because we weren?t ready to take up music 

as a career. We were in college and it was just a hobby. After seven years we 

got back together again with Duur, but the two others couldn?t make it. 

No regrets, neither leaving it all and going away nor leaving other things and 

coming back.

Songwriting

We?re at our creative best when we?re touring. We 

record fragments of songs on our mobile phones (there must be at least a thousand 

stored). The album-making process requires great concentration and we go into 

complete hibernation. 

Before Dhaani, we went to a hill station outside 

Pakistan for 20 days. There was no contact with the outside world except a PCO 

from where we?d call our families to let them know ?sab khairiyat hai (everything 

is okay)?.

Stage or studio

Studio is much tougher. You have to get things just 

right. If you can?t get the perfect take of a song, it will stay for the rest 

of your life. Stage is great fun. We try to utilise the high of a concert and 

the energy from the audience.

Influences

None really. We?ve never been a cover band. In our 

first concert, we played five original songs. But we?re huge fans of Kishore Kumar 

and R.D. Burman. We also listen to classical music a lot. But as far as looking 

beyond is concerned, we look to U2, for the way they have managed to stay on as 

a band for decades and yet make great music together.

Border line

We?ve recorded songs with Indian artistes like Sagarika, 

Euphoria and Hariharan (the video featuring him should come out soon). 

The exchange that is happening currently is very healthy. 

Many film stars from India are travelling to Pakistan and there should be more 

Indian musicians doing the same.

Family

We?re usually travelling on weekends so we make sure 

to spend loads of time with the family during the week (Bilal is married for nine 

years, with two sons and a daughter, Faisal for seven years, with two sons).

What next

A lot of touring right now. We return to India again 

in January. Work on a new album should start by February 2005. We always try to 

maintain a gap of at least two years between albums. But if the material is ready 

and other things fall into place, then maybe we will release this one even earlier.

Just like starting over

Subhajit Banerjee tunes into a music 

industry reliving the John Lennon magic 24 years after his death

He would have turned 64 on October 9 this year. But five gunshots from a deranged 

fan?s revolver on the night of December 8, 1980, cut John Ono (formerly Winston) 

Lennon?s life short at 40. The dream, for millions of Lennon fans and music lovers 

alike, was over in seconds.

Cut to 24 years later, and the Lennon manufacturing 

unit shows no signs of shutting down, continuing to churn out an amazing volume 

of reissues, ?unreleased materials? and compilations from the artiste with a regularity 

that would put some of today?s most prolific acts to shame. And all this, under 

the guidance of Lennon?s widow, Yoko Ono.

As the birthday came and went, the flurry of Lennon-related 

activities stands testimony to the popularity of the icon. The best birthday gift, 

some feel, was the parole denial for killer Mark Chapman (his third since 2000) 

on October 6.

Lennon at your Feet was the mantra for Nike which 

launched a pair of sneakers featuring the singer?s self-portrait, signature and 

a few words from the classic Imagine. Giving peace a chance to earn profits, 

proceeds are to go to Empower Peace, a US-based charity.

The Lennon-worshipper might shudder at the very thought 

of wearing the idol on his feet, but for Ono, such blatant commercial exploitation 

of the Lennon brand is hardly new. Since 1980, there have been around 10 Lennon 

?albums? (including compilations) and several documentaries that fans have lapped 

up. The most notable ? in terms of volume, at least ? being The Lennon Anthology, 

a four-CD set of unreleased tracks, outtakes and live performances issued in 1998. 

The DVD, released this year, features all of Lennon?s music videos and other rare 

footage.

so in the offing are two Lennon albums in November. 

The first is a reissue of Rock ?? Roll, the 1975 attempt to get back to 

his roots with covers of rock ?? roll classics that shaped his formative years. 

The album is an important document in the Lennon discography, not only because 

it found him in his true element on a record after a long time, or because of 

its curiously long and winding history, but also because it followed a five-year 

self-imposed exile from music.

November 2004 will see a ?remastered and remixed? 

release of the album with four bonus songs and a selection of photos in the CD 

booklet. Making Beatle fans even more misty-eyed will be the track Just Because 

with an alternative ending and a Christmas message from Lennon to Paul, George, 

Ringo, Yoko and the British people.

Rock ?? Roll will accompany Acoustics, 

featuring unreleased material with only acoustic versions of Lennon songs, carrying 

the usual ?including never heard before versions? tag. But the material is mostly 

previously released, including Imagine, Love and the brutal Cold 

Turkey. Two early versions of Real Love also find inclusion.

That, coupled with royalty from The Beatles? 1995 

Anthology project ? the mega reunion spanning three double albums, a video docu 

and a monster book ? rakes in a lot of money for the Ono-owned John Lennon Estate, 

which fiercely controls every creative scrap of the late great.

But what is the reason for the continuing super stardom 

of John Lennon that sets cash registers ringing? ?He was one of the most popular 

rock poets who wrote meaningful songs,? offers actor-singer Anjan Dutt, who prefers 

Lennon?s solo work over his output with The Beatles. ?In his solo career, he came 

out as a more responsible human being and was more expressive about his concerns,? 

Dutt muses.

?He was a spokesperson for his generation,? feels 

musician Nondon Bagchi. ?You could also see that success hadn?t gone to his head 

and that he understood where he was coming from,? he adds.

But views on the use and need for remasters and reissues 

are divided. Bagchi feels that ?most of it is exploitation of the moments? while 

Dutt thinks there is a necessity of introducing the present generation to what 

came before the boy bands. And if the old wine needs to be served from a swank 

new bottle, so be it. ?I meet people for whom rock began with Deep Purple and 

Pink Floyd,? says Dutt. ?They must know about the masters who came before.?

More power, then, to fans of the working class hero.

Sound Scan

Peace tunes

Top musicians including Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, 

Sting and U2 feature in an album paying tribute to Nobel laureate and jailed Myanmarese 

leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The 27-track For the Lady, released this week, 

also has songs from Peter Gabriel, Coldplay, Avril Lavigne, Matchbox 20 and Travis, 

with unreleased material from REM and Pearl Jam.

?Aung San Suu Kyi is a real hero,? said U2?s Bono, 

before the launch of the compilation. ?Any time anyone inside Burma listens to 

my music, I want them to know that they are listening to an artiste that supports 

their freedom,? added Clapton.

New heights

There is much to be heard of and from U2 at the moment. 

Apart from the high-profile Apple tie-up, the new album How To Dismantle An 

Atomic Bomb has hit the racks with local fans still waiting to get their hands 

on it. There are four versions to look forward to. The standard CD release aside, 

a double-album CD/DVD packing in a documentary U2 and 3 Songs will also 

be out. For collectors, a limited-edition set including the CD, DVD, colour hardback 

book with extracts from notebooks, paintings, photos, quotes and stats is worth 

a look. There will even be an LP for traditionalists.

Ring ring

You can love it or hate it but it?s a rage. Call up 

any mobile number and chances are you will be treated to a song rather than a 

ring before the person picks up. Service provider Airtel ? which was the first 

in the country to start ? is calling it Hello Tunes, while Hutch?s service is 

termed Caller Tune. Be it Coffee house-er shei adda ta, Dhoom macha 

le or Staying Alive, the idea is the same ? welcome the caller with 

a tune of your choice.

Users can select from categories such as Bollywood, 

Bengali and International, with a mix of old and new, popular and nostalgic songs. 

Charges are on a monthly and per-song access basis.

 Egg farming to boost basket 

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Faced with a severe shortage of eggs in city markets, the government has decided to encourage egg farming on contract basis. Farmers and self-help groups will be identified and allotted day-old chicks, which the government will buy back and redistribute for egg-laying.

 The first batch of 4,000 chicks was distributed to farmers by the animal resources development department on Thursday. The government will pump Rs 4 crore from the Rashtriya Shram Vikas Yojna into the project in the current fiscal. 

 With this project, the government hopes to narrow the yawning supply-demand gap. Against an annual demand for 830 crore eggs in the state, the markets get a supply of only 282 crore. Calcutta consumes over 60 lakh eggs daily, more than half of the state?s daily consumption of 112 lakh.

 To make up for the shortfall, about 35 lakh eggs are procured every day from Andhra Pradesh, the country?s largest egg producer.

 ?A hen usually lays 60 eggs a year, but the chicks we?re distributing are of the high-yield variety. Each will lay around 240 eggs,? said a senior department official said. ?Even if only 1,000 of the 4,000 chicks distributed last week lay eggs, we will have about 2 lakh additional eggs in the first year,? he added.

 The project involves distribution of day-old chicks to self-help groups, that will rear them till they are a month old. After brooding, the department will buy back the chicks and re-allot them to families. A two-day programme will be organised to train farmers in the job. Initially, the scheme will be launched in Midnapore and South 24-Parganas. 

 ?For now, we?re focussing on production and not distribution. The supply-demand gap is so huge that the produce will automatically make its way to buyers in the city,? said a senior official of the animal resources development department. 

 Though the state?s demand for eggs has grown at a steady rate of 20 per cent over the last two years, growers prefer to raise poultry for meat only.

 ?Investment in the egg business is much higher than what is required for rearing broilers,? said S.S. Aggarwal, secretary of the East India Association of Poultry Industry and Farmers. 

 ?A broiler requires an investment of Rs 45 over six weeks to grow to its full size. In contrast, a grower has to invest Rs 100 for a chick over six months before it starts laying eggs. And the bird will lay a maximum of 300 eggs in its lifetime. Banks are averse to funding layer birds as the investment cycle is too long,? Aggarwal added.

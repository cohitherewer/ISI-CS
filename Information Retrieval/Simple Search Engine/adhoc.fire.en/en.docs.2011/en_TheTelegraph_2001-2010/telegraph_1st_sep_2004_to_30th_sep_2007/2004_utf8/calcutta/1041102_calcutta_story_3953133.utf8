 Govt eyes legal line in medical seat mess

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government is ready to appeal to the Supreme Court against the interim order to limit admission of NRI-quota students to 15 per cent of the total 200 allotted medical seats.

 Three days after the Supreme Court?s order to rework the selection of MBBS students at the two medical colleges at SSKM and Midnapore, the government decided to ?wait till Wednesday?, but only for the copy of the interim order to arrive. Then, ?legal opinion? would be sought and a revision plea filed in the apex court.

 The government has already admitted 99 students under the NRI quota in the two hospitals, but with the apex court ruling that only 15 per cent of total seats be reserved for NRI-quota students, more than 65 students regularly attending classes must now be shown the door.

 Anxious parents who have forked out Rs 5 lakh each to get their children admitted under the NRI quota met director of medical education C.R. Maiti on Monday. Maiti, along with director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee, later met health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra to chalk out the legal route ahead.

 At the other end of the classroom conflict, some students who have cleared Joint Entrance Examination 2003 and are waiting to replace the NRI-quota students have decided to assemble at the Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday. This would be the first move to step up pressure on the government to implement the apex court order.

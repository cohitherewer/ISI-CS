 The City Diary

 The ESPN STAR Sports channels made a return to multi-system operator (MSO) Manthan?s network on Thursday evening. The MSO had switched off the bouquet on Tuesday, after the broadcaster had run a scroll that the network was liable for disconnection owing to dues of around Rs 1 crore. Manthan said it had to block the channels as the message was ?tarnishing its reputation?. On Thursday, ESPN STAR Sports officials said the matter had been mutually resolved and that the scroll would be withdrawn. The switch-on, however, came a little too late for football-lovers, who missed out on crucial Champions League matches on Tuesday and Wednesday night.

 Relatives of 13-year-old Sweta Saha, who died at Peerless Hospital on Thursday, ransacked the premises after an argument with the authorities over the treatment bill. Six of the relatives have been arrested. Sweta, a resident of Bagha Jatin Rabindrapally, was admitted to the hospital on September 16 with kidney and lung problems. A relative alleged that the hospital authorities demanded full payment of the bill, which was over Rs 1 lakh, before releasing the body. The family members paid part of the amount and promised to pay the balance later. But the authorities refused to relent. 

 enying the allegation, hospital official Rupak Barua said no pressure was exerted on Sweta?s family to make the full payment before taking the body.

 The high court on Thursday turned down the petitions filed by shopowners on the premises of Star Theatre, challenging the civic body?s notification asking them to shift to another place. 

 The state government has approved mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s proposal for abolition of the height restriction for buildings that are on roads not less than 15 metre wide. The abolition has become necessary for the civic body to allow construction of highrises. The municipal affairs department approved the civic body?s proposed amendments to the building rules on Thursday. Some members of the mayor?s council, like Javed Ahmed Khan, have opposed the abolition of the height restriction. In case of a fire, they argued, residents of upper storeys will be beyond the reach of firemen?s ladder.

 The district sessions judge, at Alipore court, on Thursday granted bail to Sipra Das, who was arrested on September 2 in connection with the unnatural death of maidservant Bhagirathi Haldar at her Selimpur home. Bhagirathi was found hanging from the grille of the verandah on September 1. 

 Sumit Kumar Shee, 22, was found murdered on Coal Berth Road, in the South Port police station area, on Thursday morning. Shee used to drive a Tata Sumo for a travel agency.

A resident of K Road in Howrah?s Belgachhia, Sanhita called up her mother in the afternoon and said she would be late. There has been no word from her thereafter. A missing diary has been lodged at Liluah police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hail woman power in the days of Devi

 If you are one of those non-festive souls who prefers the great indoors to the bustling outdoors during the Pujas, there is one guaranteed way to leave all your troubles behind: with a stack of DVDs, a bowl of buttery popcorn and a big-screen television. Feel the stress of school or work and everyday routine fall away as you get ready for sheer escapism.

 Just in case you feel like paying homage to the mood of the season, there is one theme that naturally comes to mind. It is time to celebrate the spirit of womanhood. Two films for each day, Saptami to Dashami should whet every woman?s appetite for empowerment and should give all men some true insight. 

 Here are Metro?s choices of English, Hindi and Bengali films which pay tribute to fearless, fantastic femininity.

Saptami 

 Thelma and Louise 

Thelma amp; Louise

 Start the Puja with a bang, and literally. This 1991 film starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis is worth every minute spent on the couch. You won?t regret watching your friends and family leave without you as these two women on the run let their hair down and head cross-country. The Ridley Scott film, which also sees Brad Pitt in a brief but noteworthy role, has all eyes on the women, when, as events take a disastrous turn, the two (in Oscar-nominated performances) embark on a discovery of friendship and empowerment.

 Charulata

 Charulata

 From a chick action flick to an evening spent with a sensitive and stirring portrayal of a woman?s inner world. There are new things to discover every time you watch Madhabi Mukherjee and Soumitra Chatterjee fall in love during this Satyajit Ray classic. A natural choice on such a list, yesterday, today and tomorrow.

Ashtami

Pride and Prejudice

 After Ashtami anjali, say an emphatic no to celluloid corruption of a classic. If you have eight hours on hand, there can be no better way to spend it than watching the 1995 BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth. Though this might not be everyone?s idea of a power woman film, it packs in quite a feminist punch for a work of its time, a point Ms Balle Balle sadly missed (amongst many, many others).

 Dahan

 After that lovely romp through 18th Century England, turn your attention to 20th century Calcutta in one of Rituparno Ghosh?s finest films. And the theme of a woman fighting for justice against all odds goes well with the Devi at our doorstep.

Navami

Mrs Doubtfire

 After the overdose of serious cinema, begin Friday with a big laugh. Start with an ironic interpretation of your four-day theme of choice. See how the one-and-only Robin Williams adopts the spirit of femininity as he turns nanny (and female, of course) to get closer to his kids. Or if he isn?t your idea of the perfect woman, you can try Dustin Hoffman in the eminently superior Tootsie, instead.

 Chandni Bar

 Chandni Bar

 On the free-spirited Navami night, as you ride on Bacchus? pards, watch the gritty real tale of beer-bar girls in Mumbai. Adopting a quasi-documentary style, Madhur Bhandarkar delves deep into the lives of the much-abused womenfolk as they become just another cog in the cruel wheel of life.

Dashami

Mother India

 Return to your roots on the last day of the Puja. What better way to get your eyes all moist than by watching Nargis ride through this epic saga ? from a vulnerable rural belle to the very epitome of Indian womanhood. Celebrate the spirit of the Bharatiya nari through a film that became the country?s debut vehicle at the Oscars and brought the Dutts together.

Kill Bill Vols. 1 amp; 2

Round off the Puja by quashing the Miramax concept 

and watching the film(s) at a start-to-finish stretch, just like QT conceived 

it in the first place. From the blood-splattered bride to the Durga-like showdown 

at the House of Blue Leaves to the five-point punch in the last scene, watch Quentin 

Tarantino?s world collide with Hong Kong martial arts movies and the spaghetti 

Westerns. To top it all, the woman behind the roaring rampage of revenge is named 

after Ma Durga ? Uma Thurman.

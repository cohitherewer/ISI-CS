The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Recommends

 THE VCD 

 (MusicWorld, Rs 199) Get into the fortress. Get the general. Get out. This 

is the simple brief that sets up mission impossible for a band of soldiers. With 

Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood blazing away in this Alistair MacLean cliffhanger, 

the box-office proved a soft target. 

THE EVENT

 (Nandan II, 6.30 pm, September 7) The programme to mark Sunil Gangopadhyays 

70th birthday will feature Soumitra Chatterjee, Jogen Chowdhury, Nabaneeta Dev 

Sen, Nabakumar Basu, Mohan Singh Khangura and the writer himself. Bishnu Palchoudhurys 

documentary Alone and the Other will be screened. 

THE SOIREE

 (Nazrul 

Mancha, September 5, 5.30 pm) An evening of ghazals with maestros Ghulam Ali and 

Jagjit Singh (picture below), hosted by Calcutta Music Conference in aid of Sahanubhuti, 

an NGO for mentally challenged children.

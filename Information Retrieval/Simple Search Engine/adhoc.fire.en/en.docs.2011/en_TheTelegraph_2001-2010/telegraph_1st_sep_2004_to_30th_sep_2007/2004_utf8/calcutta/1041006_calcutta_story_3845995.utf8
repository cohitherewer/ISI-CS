 Puja body in CPM hands

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Officially godless, the ruling CPM appears to have captured the committee that organises the famous Durga puja at Sreebhumi, off Lake Town, by elbowing out former party member Sujit Bose and his associates from the organising body. For the first time in 13 years, Bose will be out of Sreebhumi Durga puja, considered a must-see of the festival.

 ?They (local CPM functionaries) convened a meeting of the puja committee immediately after the municipal polls on June 27 and reconstituted the puja sub-committee without me,? Bose said on Tuesday. ?Just imagine, I am general secretary of Sreebhumi Sporting Club, yet I am not in the picture after the Durga puja sub-committee was reconstituted. I have been treated shabbily,? said Bose, who, till last year, called the shots at Sreebhumi.

 The club hit the headlines in 1991 when the puja organised by it was chosen for Sharad Samman, a puja award. Hardly a year passes when this puja does not win an award. 

 But this year, the puja sub-committee has been reconstituted, with Jyotirmoy Bakshi, CPM functionary and member of the DYFI, the party?s youth wing, appointed general secretary.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, who has been chief patron of the puja since 1991, still holds the same position on the puja committee. Bose will boycott the puja to protest the move to oust him from the committee and will stay outside Calcutta during the festival. 

 Bakshi, newly-appointed general secretary of the puja sub-committee, admitted that he was an active CPM member. ?It is not true that we removed Bose from the new sub-committee. Bose was invited to attend the meeting thrice, but he did not turn up,? said Bakshi.

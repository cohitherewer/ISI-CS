The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Audible, visible mantra for Puja

 - Innovations amp; discounts, customer contact amp; culture fests propel retail

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Colas coming clean, hi-tech players going Bangali, a retail major ready to laugh it all off? the modern marketing mantra for the Pujas is as myriad as can be.

 Marketers agree that a depressed market condition and bottomline focus have forced them to be wise with spending, but they chorus that being both audible and visible during the Puja are mandatory. 

 The high-pitched billboard battle has given ground to retailers going big with above-the-line promotions, while cola giants concentrate on micro-level consumer connect.

 This autumn, Coca-Cola has blended an array of activities with corporate social responsibility to boost sales and improve image. ?Our focus is on activities that affect the various facets of the consumer?s life,? says Manu Talwar of Coca-Cola, referring to events like Kolkata Shopping Festival. Post-cola controversy, it is also time to tie up with the state pollution control board to ensure a clean Puja.

 Advocating local culture, activating ground-level activities and announcing a slew of sops are musts. ?The marketers are always in search of new media to reach out to the consumers. Riding on the local culture, the companies try to create excitement and generate sales,? explains Ranjan Das, professor of strategic management at IIM-Calcutta.

 Activities drawn up by Hutch and Airtel ? ranging from nightlong Bengali musical programmes to a host of value-added services capturing the Puja spirit ? support Das? argument. 

 ?Reaching out to the core interest of the customer is very important. Durga puja is closest to Bengali hearts and we are trying to capture the occasion and keep the user captivated,? says S. Murli of Hutch.

 Shoppers? Stop, the anchor store at Forum and City Centre, has resorted to laughter. The month-long Ha! Ha! Ha! Fest, starting Thursday, will ensure a hearty laugh for shoppers with clowns, mimics, caricatures, therapeutic impromptu laughter clubs, a masti corner and a host of special events on weekends.

 Innovations co-exist with the strategy of doling out benefits by way of discounts. ?When the market is competitive, one can?t afford to ignore the rules of the game,? said a shop-owner in Vardaan market.

 Not just private players, the state government (with Mahotsav 2004 to sell the state?s tourism potential) and one of the oldest chambers in the city (Kolkata Shopping Festival by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, together with West Bengal Tourism) have joined the marketing game.

 Calamity control address

 - Come rain, come shine, relief team always on the ready

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 After working out of a makeshift control room in the office of a joint secretary, which is made functional only ?during disasters?, the state relief department is now all set to open its own control room at Writers? Buildings. 

 The government is in the process of setting up a sophisticated control room with United Nations Development Programme funds on the third floor of the state administrative headquarters.

 ?This means that we are upgrading the existing control room. All this while, there was no permanent room, and we used to coordinate with the districts only during crises. So, the new arrangement will help better management of our programmes throughout the year,? state relief minister Hafiz Alam Sairani said on Sunday.

 Television sets, telephones, fax and photocopy machines are among the basic gadgets required to operate any control room. These will be installed there.

 ?We will keep updating ourselves on weather reports at regular intervals. If necessary, we will pass on information to the districts and expect the district headquarters, too, to report any relevant information to us,? Sairani added.

 Two four-digit numbers ? one for the districts and another for the headquarters ? are being made operational. 

 ?Our main focus, initially, is 10 districts and two cities ? Calcutta and Asansol ? which have been identified as earthquake-vulnerable zones,? the minister explained.

 ?After the warning from the Centre, we are taking special measures for these areas to make people aware of ways to deal with earthquake-related crises. There has been no major earthquake here, yet we still have to be alert,? he added. 

 Calcutta itself is vulnerable to disasters such as floods and the aftermath of Nor?westers. 

 ?Shanties in the slums have vulnerable roofs which may easily cave in, as they did last year. Roadside trees are often uprooted during such calamities and this might be dangerous. Even on such occasions, we coordinate with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, police and all other agencies concerned,? an official of the relief department said. 

 ?The government has to keep a strict vigil on the weather conditions for a large part of the year, till December 15,? the official elaborated.

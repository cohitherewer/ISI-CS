The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Multiplying mantra

Calcutta?s first multiplex is one year old. INOX Forum 

celebrated its first birthday bash with elan on Tuesday evening with a team from 

Tollywood (June, Saswata, Koneenica and Anindita in picture left by Pabitra Das) 

turning up to raise a toast. Even as the party reached its peak with the screening 

of Steven Spielberg?s The Terminal, some of the trends emerging after 365 

days of multiplex madness gives a fair glimpse of Calcutta?s cine-viewing style.

 There were two peak seasons for INOX Forum. If the festive period between October and December 2003 was only expected to call in the crowds, the June-August 2004 purple patch was surprisingly even bigger, with the multiplex smashing the national box-office record not once, but thrice. The success of this phase was largely due to big Bollywood releases including Main Hoon Na, Hum Tum and Dhoom. The dip between March and June was the worst, when the exam season coincided with the paucity of big releases.

 INOX scored big with its morning shows. With tickets priced at Rs 50 (less than half the usual), the morning drew in the college crowd while the afternoon and evening shows brought in the families.

 The film fare to rake in the most moolah at the multiplex was a healthy mix of English, Hindi and Bengali. Top grossers included Finding Nemo, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, The Lord of The Rings, Spider-Man, Bombaiyer Bombete, Chokher Bali, Kal Ho Naa Ho, Hum Tum, Main Hoon Na, Lakshya and Dhoom.

 There were several celebrities, too, who preferred to ?live the movie? while passing through Calcutta. Rahul Bose, Perizaad Zorabian, Virendra Sehwag, Celina Jaitley, Ajay Jadeja, Suniel Shetty, M.F. Husain, Soha Ali Khan, Javed Miandad, Neha Dhupia, Bipasha Basu ? all dropped in at INOX.

 Apart from the usual promotions surrounding a film, the multiplex held special events and contests to make movie-going even more exciting. From the Diwali kiddies? celebrations with Finding Nemo to the global premiere of The Matrix Revolutions to the Pachas Ka Do Lakh Bees contest and even a seminar on ?Advent of Multiplex Impact on Film Industry?, INOX was always happening.

 The city?s first four-screen multiplex also became the first Calcutta theatre to screen a Telugu film, with the April 2 release of the Venkatesh-Katrina Kaif starrer Malleswari, which went houseful on the first Sunday.

 And with the one-year celebrations comes the good news of INOX Forum audience count touching the one million mark. Last week, Shruti Gupta became customer number one million at the multiplex.

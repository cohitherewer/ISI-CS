 Laughing our vices away

 The temptation to succumb to corruption and vice was just as strong in the past as it is in the present day. This is what makes Adi Natya Drishtis farcical comedy Hasya Churamani relevant in the modern context. Though ostensibly light-hearted and funny in style, the play is thematically serious as it deals with exposing the dangerous and cruel tendencies of society. Despite its 12th century setting, it is also a reflection of our times, since youngsters nowadays, like the protagonist of Hasya Churamani, are more than eager to earn quick money, no matter whether the means to it are dishonest. What is interesting about this presentation, however, is that the moral degradation of the characters is viewed in a sympathetic manner and they are given an opportunity to redeem themselves. A total dramatic experience is also provided by a rich interplay of rhythm, rhetoric, song, dance and a subtle but eloquent body language. Direction: Robin Das. Hosted by EZCC as part of its multilingual theatre fest.

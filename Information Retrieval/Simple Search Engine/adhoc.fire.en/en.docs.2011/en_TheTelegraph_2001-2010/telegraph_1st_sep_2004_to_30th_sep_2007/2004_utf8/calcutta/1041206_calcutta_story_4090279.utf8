 The fierce rivalry between the Fraser and Heathland cottages for boys or Thorburn and Mansfield hostels for girls will be swept under the lush carpet at the St Paul?s Cathedral grounds on Friday.

 When the choir of Dr Graham?s Homes wades into Shout to the Lord to kick off their fifth sojourn from the Kalimpong hills, and renders the complex four-part harmony of In Dulci, it will herald a tinge of d?j? vu to tone the balmy winter evening.

 The kids, after all, will be returning from where they began their amazing pilgrimage in 2000. ?Calcutta has been a great learning curve for the children, giving them rare recognition in the hills and beyond,? says choirmaster Shane Saviel, who feels he himself is a ?changed person? for the experience.

 The troupe, which has swelled from a mere 30 to nearly 70-strong now, has been regaling city audiences at the CC amp;FC grounds for the past three years after the Millennium-year lung-opener on the Cathedral lawns. And now, foreign pastures beckon, as the UK committee of the Homes has committed to host the choir in Easter 2006.

 ?The children are likely to perform in England, Scotland and Ireland during the fund-raiser tour, which should have a huge impact on their lives,? observes Homes president M.J. Robertson. Saviel is being sent to the UK next Monday on a 45-day sponsored trip to ?study choral groups there?, preparatory to the Easter visit.

 The choirmaster feels they owe it all to Calcutta. ?Nobody knew about us before this warm-hearted city, which appreciates good music like none other, threw its arms wide open.? And Saviel?s wards have worked extra hard to make this winter?s date with the city the most memorable.

 ?This time, we have split the show into two legs. The St. Paul?s concert will feature lively gospel pop songs in the first half and serious Western classical Christmas music after the break, mostly set to arrangements by Sir David Wilcox,? says Kamal Upasak, the school?s music teacher.

 ?Pop and rock ?n? roll with a lot of punch? will mark Saturday evening?s CC amp;FC gig, which will open with their ?signature tune? Circle of life from Lion King. The eclectic set will also have contemporary chartbusters like Westlife?s Flying without wings and The Corrs? All the love, besides throwback hits like Billy Joel?s Uptown girl and Abba?s Dancing queen.

 ?We are all looking forward to belting out It?s the time to disco and Woh chali,? says Lindsay Cantopher, who feels ?much more confident? after last year?s smashing show in front of a sell-out congregation. ?We were all a touch nervous when we took the stage, since we had never sung before such a huge crowd. But once we warmed up, it was great fun,? recalls the 15-year-old.

 Lindsay, along with Ben Westley, Tseten Yang Lama, Clinton Francis and newcomers Fabian Rydquist, Hazel Monteiro and Tenzing Pelden, will form the core of the lead vocal ensemble, backed up by an enthusiastic chorus. ?While we will again do a piece from Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber?s Pharaoh?s Dream, the most challenging task before us was picking up A.R. Rahman?s Maa tujhe salaam,? signs off Saviel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Most old Calcutta buildings have leaking pipelines. The dirty water often falls 

on pedestrians walking past the buildings. Nothing can be more irritating than 

getting fresh clothes ruined in this manner on your way to office in the morning. 

The Calcutta Municipal Corporation should take action against building-owners 

who inconvenience others by ill-maintaining their property. 

 Chandan Ray, Sarsuna. 

 Many public vehicles still use dated air horns that cause unnecessary noise. 

Drivers often use the air horns at night, though traffic is at the minimum on 

the roads. My house is next to a busy thoroughfare and it is impossible to keep 

the doors and windows closed all the time to shut out the noise. It seems the 

law against sound pollution is seldom implemented. The authorities can take measures 

at least against private buses if they are caught using the horns excessively, 

especially in residential areas. Air horns must be totally banned.

 Rimli Datta, Salt Lake. 

 A few seats in private buses and minibuses should be reserved for senior citizens 

too. Except for a few new ones, all the other buses have seats reserved for the 

physically challenged persons and women only.

 Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bon Appetease

Victor Banerjee

If the doctor gives you five more minutes to live, 

you might as well spend it eating. After all, with heaven not known for its five-course 

meals, you might end up surviving for eternity on love and fresh air.

ternatively, if per chance youve paved the path to 

hell with good intentions, like I have, every damned thing that you might get 

there is certainly going to be cooked to a cinder. Therefore, lets hear it for 

gormandising right here, on planet earth.

With the clock counting down, do you order a takeaway 

Thai curry or have a cheesy Italian frisbee delivered to the door or would you 

rather settle for your paramours last supper after which he or she can throw 

himself or herself off the ninth floor balcony so his or her spirits can fly with 

you?

Talking about flying, I am reminded of a flight I 

recently took where the airline was offering you a credit card with what I thought 

was health insurance. It turned out to be an accident insurance policy that covered 

you for more if you were worth more, less if you were worthless.

What frightened me, however, was the realisation (at 

least as I interpreted it) that you had to swear you had no blood pressure problems, 

heart problems and were not HIV+ besides never having sprouted tumours or had 

a stroke, in order to qualify.

Another fascinating fact of life is that you have 

to be crazy if you think health insurance covers you for mental illnesses. If 

the pressures of modern life depress you, Prozac might help but take it to the 

point where you kill everyone around you and are declared insane, you alone end 

up paying for incarceration in a loony bin.

By the way, it is the Government of India that does 

not recognise autism, schizophrenia or manic depression as sound grounds for making 

a claim and has disclaimers to that effect in all their prose.

Now let us presume, very pessimistically, that you 

fall into one of the several categories that can make no claims. Consequently, 

you wish to terminate your life by either imitating the highly publicised modus 

operandi of Nata Mullick that was splashed in every daily around India with endorsements 

from our chief ministers wife or jumping off the terrace of a five-star hotel. 

Here is where I can step in, give you something different 

to do for the five minutes it takes you to contemplate suicide and perhaps let 

you live to pay your bills for many many more unhappy years to come. 

For vegetarians I recommend the bitter sweet methi 

and for the non-veggies I have a chicken and onion that that you can toss your 

cares away with.

So cheer up. And dont be at all surprised if these 

two five-minute life-savers assume a significant role in your reputation as a 

great mum or a fabulous cook.

Methi paneer 

 Ingredients: Fresh paneer (cut into 1 cubes) 

500 gm, onion (roughly sliced) 2 medium sized, kasoori methi 1 tbsp, oil 

2 tbsp, haldi 1/2 tsp, salt to taste 

 Method: Heat oil. Saute onions till glazed 

and slightly brown around the edges. Add the paneer, kasoori methi, haldi 

and salt. Toss together on high flame. Cook till all the water dries out. Serve 

hot. 

Chicken with crunchy onion

Ingredients: Chicken breast (boneless, each 

breast cut into 4 pcs) 500 gm, dahi 1 cup, ginger paste 1 tsp, garlic paste 

1 tsp, onion (sliced into rings) 2 large-sized, Tandoori chicken masala 2 

tsp, mint leaves 1 tbsp, oil 1 tbsp, salt to taste, chilli powder to taste.

 Method: Marinate the chicken in dahi, 

ginger paste and garlic paste for half-an-hour. Heat oil. Add the marinated chicken, 

Tandoori chicken masala and half the quantity of mint leaves. Stir well. 

When the chicken is cooked and the gravy is semi-dry (approximately five minutes), 

add the onion rings. Stir over high heat for two minutes and remove from flame. 

Garnish with the remaining mint leaves and serve hot with parathas or rice.

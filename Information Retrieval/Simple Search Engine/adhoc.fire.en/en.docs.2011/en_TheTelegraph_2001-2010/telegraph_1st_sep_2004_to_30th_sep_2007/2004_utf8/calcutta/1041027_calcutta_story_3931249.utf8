The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Can you imagine the cute and chubby Meg Ryan playing Vivian in Pretty Woman? Well, that?s what the production house Disney wanted before film-making began. You don?t need to worry about that visual aberration simply because you?ll get to see Julia Roberts all right when you catch the film on Wednesday at 9 pm on Star Movies. 

 One of the biggest movies of the 90s, Pretty Woman will be part of Star Movies? ?100 million dollar movies? bonanza. The charming fairytale boasts breakthrough performances from the lead actors, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. The blockbuster romantic comedy about a rich man hiring a beautiful prostitute only to fall in love, opened at 1,325 theatres and grossed a total box-office earning of $463,406,268 worldwide.

 The film sees Gere engaging Julia to decorate his arm for a series of social events to help seal a business deal. Shopping sprees, gifts and nights in five-star luxury lead to love, complications and heartache. 

 Try this for Pretty Woman trivia ? Julia?s head was superimposed on small-time actress Shelley Michelle?s body for the come-hither poster of the film. Gere?s hair is brown on the poster, but greying in the movie. The sequence where Gere plays the piano has the star also composing the piece of music that is played. Molly Ringwald was originally offered the role of Vivian but she turned it down. That?s bad luck for Molly and a jackpot for Julia?

Sonu Nigam: High on music

 They set out to look for a blend between Lata Mangeshkar and Madhubala and they feel they have done a decent job of that. Indian Idol, the big talent hunt show on Sony, kickstarts on Thursday after the three judges ? Farah Khan, Anu Malik and Sonu Nigam ? have travelled throughout the country looking for that magic voice which comes out of a dream visage. 

 And if Sonu?s experience of the judging process is anything to go by, the show promises to be quite a TRP topper. ?As I watched thousands of aspiring Indian Idols sing with everything they had in them, I couldn?t help but remember my earlier days in the industry. There was no great opportunity or platform such as this one back then. A lot of uncertainty, a lot of hard work and perseverance and finally the good breaks. 

 ?My fans have stood by me through all these years and I see this is as my opportunity to give back to them and the industry. Give them a new voice that will make the entire country sing with it.?

 Sonu?s stint with the contestants was anything but mundane. ?As I sat there listening to a blind girl from Jabalpur sing like a nightingale and a police constable in Delhi show up for the auditions, I realised that Indian Idol has achieved what its promise was ? to become a truly universal platform for people with talent to fulfill their dreams, irrespective of social status, caste, creed, physical shortcomings.? 

 But what happens if the ultimate Indian Idol becomes more popular than Sonu himself? ?True talent is something neither I nor anyone else in the world can or should hide. It is part of one?s identity and tomorrow I would be most happy to claim that I was one of those who helped discover the country?s first ever Indian Idol.?

Amrita Rao: Main hoon na

 Appearing in music videos has become a fad in Bollywood 

for some time now. Every known name in tinsel town has starred in some Indipop 

music video helping the track race up the countdown charts.

The three Khans have all jumped into the video bandwagon. 

Aamir did so for the Kaifi Azmi tribute, Shah Rukh for the Yash Chopra-directed 

and Vajpayee-penned Jagjit Singh video and Salman more recently for Honey honey. 

Jackie Shroff did the honours for DJ Aqeel?s video, Aryan Vaid fought with Keerthi 

Reddy for DJ Suketu?s mix of Bin Tere Sanam. 

 As for the actresses, Rani Mukherjee, Raveena Tandon, Namrata Shirodkar, Mahima Chaudhuri, Aarti Chhabria and Amisha Patel have all swung for Adnan Sami.

 And now, the buzz goes that DJ Aqeel has roped in brother-in-law Zayed Khan and the other young star from Main Hoon Na, Amrita Rao, for his new remix video. While Zayed is definitely appearing in the video, there is a question mark as far as Amrita goes.

When contacted, Amrita?s mother answered her cell 

phone and all she said was: ?Wrong news, wrong news! She is not doing the video 

as reported.? Will she or won?t she? Let?s wait and watch...

 An icon of the fashion world and an ultimate in conveyance comfort. The weekend is set for a tryst with the twain. The History Channel has set aside one hour of opulence and panache, luxury and extravagance in the series, Lifestyle.TV: The Legend of Style, that beams at 10 pm. 

 This Saturday, the show takes a look at how Giorgio Armani has been able to dominate the fickle world of fashion for more than 25 years. 

 With footage from his fantastic shows and shots of celebrities donning Armani creations, the programme follows the life that he has lived ? from his decision to give up medicine for the thrill of frills and the relationship with young architect Sergio Galeotti that launched his career. 

 This also includes interviews with Simon Doonan of Barney?s and film star Samuel L. Jackson, an Armani fan. 

 If Armani has been stretching the limits of imagination in the fashion world, it is limousines (beam time: Sunday, 10 pm) that have been doing the same with transport ? both in terms of size and interiors. 

 One can have a rolling disco, go for a rumble off-the-road in a monster truck limousine or take a direct hit in an armoured limo. Since cars started to roll, the rich and the famous have turned to limousines as their favourite way to cruise down the road in comfort. 

 It?s not just about how it makes them feel inside. It also has a lot to do with what it makes others feel outside!

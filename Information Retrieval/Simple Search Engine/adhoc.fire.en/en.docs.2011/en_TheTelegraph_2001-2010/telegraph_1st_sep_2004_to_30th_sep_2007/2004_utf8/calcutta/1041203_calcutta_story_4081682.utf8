 A crafty affair

 For centuries, metal casting has been the traditional craft of the nomadic adivasi tribes dwelling in the regions around the Vindhyas and the Eastern Ghats. Ritualistic in origin, this ancient folk craft, dokra (oldest), represents the culture and beliefs of these tribes and till today remains the most enduring aspect of their existence. Using a labour intensive, highly specialised technique called the lost-wax process, dokra works are made of brass, copper or zinc. Artisans? Art Works, the ongoing exhibition of dokra handicrafts, showcases an impressive array of novelties, artifacts and assorted utility items made by artisans of Bengal. Images of intricately designed and hand-crafted deities, human figures, animals and birds, apart from lamps, caskets and bowls, adorn this exhibition, which is an attempt to highlight and pay tribute to the skilled workmanship and delicate artistry of people who strive to keep alive a dying tradition amidst adverse circumstances.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Puja organisers in the city build pandals blocking narrow lanes every year. 

But it is often seen that they build the bamboo structures as early as a month 

before the Pujas. As it is, the city has limited road space when compared with 

other metropolitan cities. These road blocks add to the chaos. Organisers should 

put up the structures as late as possible to cause the least inconvenience to 

pedestrians and commuters.

 I applied for a SIM connection at the telephone exchange in Salt Lake on September 

9. SIM cards were not available then and I was asked to keep in touch with them. 

After a few weeks, I went to the BSNL office on Raja Dinendra Street where I was 

promptly supplied with a card. Why is there such a delay in replenishing the stock 

of SIM cards at a particular BSNL office (Salt Lake in this case)? Also, the application 

form for a SIM card should, along with other details, require the applicant to 

fill in his/her occupation as well. This will help BSNL categorise its customers 

(students, businessmen, service, home-maker etc) and help create specific packages 

with services catering to each segment.

 Madhabi Ghosh, Salt Lake. 

 The international day for the elderly was observed on October 1 but only in 

name. No constructive scheme for the elderly was launched. We get to see aged, 

ailing and helpless people, perhaps abandoned by their near and dear ones, on 

city streets. The government should consider schemes to provide them food, clothing 

and shelter. One of Swami Vivekananda?s main goals was to alleviate the sufferings 

of the aged. Along with the opening of Swamijis renovated ancestral 

house and dedication of a museum to him, something could also have been done for 

the homeless aged people. 

 Dalim Kumar Dutta, APC Road. 

 Recently, skipper Sourav Ganguly had announced his resolve to build an English-medium 

school in this city. However, Calcutta has enough of such schools. I request the 

Team India captain to try and construct the school in a rural area of Bengal where 

it is much more needed.

 Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia, Nadia. 

 I had sent a money-order from Champdani post office, in Hooghly, to Rafigunj, 

in Uttar Pradesh. But the MO didn?t reach the destination way past the expected 

time. The authorities should prevent such incidents.

 Mahesh Prasad, Baidyabati.

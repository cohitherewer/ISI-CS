The festive rush is on and every shop stop is busy 

putting its best ware forward. With time running out, here?s a breeze through 

of some glittering weekend displays:

 After Sally Holkar exhibited weaves from Chanderi and Maheshwar villages in Madhya Pradesh, at Weaver?s Studio earlier this week, Gallery Kanishka is following suit with a maheshwari and tussar weaves display.

 Delhi-based Karigar Weaves has brought along a collection of ethnic and formal wear for women, showcasing a range of block printed and textured fabric. Tussars with woven zari borders and maheshwaris with embossed prints are interesting options.

 Craving the younger brigade?s attention is Priyanka Jalan?s collection at Genesis Art Gallery. ?My collection spells comfort and style,? declares the Delhi-based designer about the bright colours, the smart Western cuts, the prints of Indian motifs, the sequins, beads and zari work, along with some funky accessories.

 From the Capital crowd to Rajasthan royalty. The Surana Jewellers of Jaipur date back to the very inception of the city in 1735, when Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh had invited them to promote their unique brand of jewellery-making. Royal patronage may be a thing of the past, but Kamal and Prem Surana continue to dazzle ? at the moment in Taj Bengal?s Mandarin Room ? with a blend of traditional and modern masterpieces in gold enamelled, kundan, diamond and precious stones.

 Browse the ornate chokers, earrings and bracelets combining stones set in 23-karat-gold frames with precious and semi-precious stones to know just why.

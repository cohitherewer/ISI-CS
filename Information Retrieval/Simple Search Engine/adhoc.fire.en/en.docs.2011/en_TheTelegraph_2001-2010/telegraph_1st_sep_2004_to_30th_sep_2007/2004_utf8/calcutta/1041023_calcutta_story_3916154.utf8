The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Raga razzmatazz on a roll

 One of them last came to the city for The Telegraph Food Guide do. The other was here just a week back for the Kaifi Azmi day. Together in the city to launch the music and promote the movie Morning Raga on Friday, Perizaad Zorabian and Shabana Azmi packed quite a punch as they visited music store, bookstore and pub to make the Mahanavami a starry affair. And giving the ladies company was screen debutant Prakash Rao.

 Perizaad, who?s just back from London after shooting for Lawrence Postma?s Exits and Entrances, was all excited about the Mahesh Dattani film. ?It?s about these three individuals who deal with the past issues of their lives. And it is through music that they get their redemption. It?s such a well-layered story with a whole lot of subtext. It?s the meeting of many worlds ? village and city, Carnatic and trance, and ultimately two generations of people.? 

 The Dattani tag doesn?t make the film arty, felt the cast. ?Morning Raga, if anything, is a bit too commercial,? says Shabana. ?So there is no question of clubbing it under art or serious cinema. If people go to the theatres they would know how commercial it is. The awareness about the film is important, though.?

 Prakash, for his part, was confident that the film should work at the box-office and was pleased with the Calcutta turnout at the promotions. ?Despite the festivities around, it?s good to see so much interest in the film. Hope it does well here, once it releases next Friday.?

 Perizaad, of course, can?t have enough of the city. ?In the recent past I have been here so many times but haven?t really got time to explore the place,? she said. ?It?s been like just that one long drive from the airport to the hotels and venues. It would be great if I could actually come here to work for a Bengali film. I met Rituda (Rituparno Ghosh) today and I told him that I would like to work with him. That?s the first time I have said something like that to a director. Hope something works out in the future.?

 All three were gaga about the 

 working comfort with the others. ?Shabanaji is quite 

 incredible. It does get intimidating when you stand up to 

 her in front of the camera but she completely breaks those 

 barriers and what follows is a great action-reaction exercise,? 

 said Perizaad.

 So the countdown?s on for the release of a film which, according to the trio, was ?emotionally engaging?.

 The 56th National Cadet Corps (NCC) Day celebrations were held at Brigade Parade Grounds on Sunday. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee inaugurated the day-long programme, in which 600 cadets from West Bengal and Sikkim took part.

 In the morning, outstanding cadets were awarded medals after the march-past. 

 A special feature this year was a platoon marching on stilts. The highlights of the day were microlight aircraft sorties and para-sailing by the cadets. There was also an aero-modelling show.

 There was a treat in store for the cadets, too, in the form of an impressive display of equipment used by the Indian armed forces. The celebrations ended with a cultural programme at the NCC Clubhouse on Park Street.

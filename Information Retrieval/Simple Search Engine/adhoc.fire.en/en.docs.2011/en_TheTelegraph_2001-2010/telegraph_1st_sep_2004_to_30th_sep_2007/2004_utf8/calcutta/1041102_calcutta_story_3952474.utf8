 Long leg of the law trips snatchers 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a rare display of physical fitness, two policemen chased down a couple of snatchers over a km-long stretch on AJC Bose Road and recovered Rs 80,000 on Monday afternoon. The money had been looted from a leather merchant. 

 Peeyush Pandey, deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said the duo, identified as Rafique and Siddique, had admitted to their crime.

 ?We called the businessman, who identified the snatchers,? he said.

 According to A.B. Majumdar, officer-in-charge of Taltala police station, the incident took place around 12.30 pm, near the Entally market bus stop. Tanveer Ibadullah, brother of Khalek Ibadullah, who contested the by-election from Entally with the Congress ticket, was waiting at the stop.

 ?Rafique and Siddique suddenly started beating him up. As he slumped to the ground, they snatched his bag, containing the money, and started running. Tanveer got to his feet and started shouting, ?chor, chor?,? stated Majumdar.

 Tanveer?s cries caught the attention of sub-inspector D. Karmakar and constable Nazrul Islam, who were patrolling the road. They spotted the duo running down AJC Bose Road and immediately ran after them.

 ?One of the policemen picked up a brick and threw it at the snatchers. The brick hit Rafique on his leg and he fell. Karmakar then caught him, while Islam pinned down Siddique,? informed Majumdar.

 The entire amount, in currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations, was seized from them. 

 ?During interrogation, both the snatchers confessed to their crime. They had come from Canning in South 24-Parganas. It seems that the two have criminal records. We are checking our records and contacting our counterparts in South 24-Parganas to know their criminal antecedents,? said Majumdar.

 In another incident, two constables of the same police station netted two snatchers from a crowded private bus on AJC Bose Road and recovered Rs 11,700.

 According to Majumdar, constables Madan Chowdhury and K.N. Rai had been asked to keep a close eye on the bus stops and travel in crowded buses in plain clothes following a spurt in the incidences of pickpocketing. 

 The policemen boarded a Sealdah-bound bus at Wellington after spotting two suspicious-looking youths in the bus. The two were later identified as Bimal Mandal and Mohammad Ujjwal Mian.

 They were held when they tried to get close to a passenger. When they failed to answer the policemen?s questions, they were searched and the money was found on them. 

 They later confessed to pickpocketing.

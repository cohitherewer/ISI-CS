The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Two architectural beauties of the British era ? the MacKinnon Mackenzie building 

and the Chartered Building ? are being neglected for long. Earlier, these buildings 

housed renowned offices as they are located in the hub of the city?s commercial 

district. Now, trees have grown in the creeks on the exterior walls of these structures. 

It seems neither the state government nor the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has 

any desire to ensure upkeep of buildings that are associated with Calcutta?s golden 

past. 

 Chandan Ray, Sarsuna. 

 A signboard on Red Road, near Fort William, says ?Keep left free?. But many 

vehicles block the left lane and don?t allow other vehicles to turn left at the 

traffic signal. Traffic police should see to it that the rule is strictly followed. 

If necessary, a fine could be slapped on errant drivers. Parking should also not 

be allowed on the left lane at any road intersection. I had noticed that on Gurusaday 

Road the left lane is supposed to be kept free for left-bound vehicles. However, 

private buses often block the left lane while waiting at the traffic signal to 

get a lead on buses on the same route. 

 Shiv Shanker Almal, Lower Rawdon Street. 

 Lady Ranu Mukherjee Manch at the Academy of Fine Arts has got only one exit. 

Programmes usually run to packed houses here. If, by any chance, a fire breaks 

out or any other mishap occurs during a show, the lack of a second exit may make 

the hall a death-trap. I request the authorities to take adequate safety measures. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia, Nadia. 

 The open urinal at the Phoolbagan crossing has become a nuisance to passersby. 

Whenever vehicles stop at the traffic signal, passengers are forced to bear the 

nauseating stench. The Corporation should either pull down the structure or relocate 

it to a proper place with a good drainage system. 

 Shyamal Kumar Ghosh, Salt Lake. 

 It is clearly written on all medicine covers that the maximum retail price 

should not exceed the price mentioned plus taxes applicable. However, some medical 

shops are duping the customers. Recently, while purchasing a strip of 10 Supradyn 

tablets a shop charged me Rs 14 while the same cost me Rs 13 at another shop. 

These variations in the price of medicines are inexcusable. The manufacturer should 

prescribe the maximum selling price inclusive of all taxes also on the cover so 

that consumers are not taken for a ride. 

 Debaprasad Mukherjee, Nayapatty Road.

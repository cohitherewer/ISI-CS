 Five minors brought back

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA 

 Five minor girls sold to brothels in Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi early this year were rescued in the past two months and brought back home.

 The girls revealed how a police-politician-pimp nexus is at work in trafficking minors.

 ?I was told by a cousin that I could earn a tidy sum as a maid in another city. My mother works in a brick kiln and my brother is a blood cancer patient. I badly needed money for his treatment,? said Mafusa Khatun (13).

 She was taken to a brothel in Mumbai and sold seven times to other brothels there. ?Her traffickers made at least Rs 60,000,? said Swapan Mukherjee, secretary of Centre For Communication and Development (CCD), an NGO that took an active role in the rescue. 

 ?As most of these girls are illiterate and shy, they can do very little to save themselves. This is only the tip of iceberg,? Mukherjee explained. ?The government should take immediate steps to control the trafficking,? he added.

 Like Mafusa, Rima Ghosh (13) of Gaighata, Anwara Khatun (17) of Haroa, Uma Sarkar (12) of Hadipur and Sabita Parui (16) of Berachampa, all in North 24-Parganas, were sold to brothels in Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi.

 ?In the Capital, some people get girls over from different areas of North and South 24-Parganas and sell them to local brothels,? alleged Sabita. She claimed even senior police officers of the cities concerned were hand-in-glove with the racketeers.

 The other girls narrated how they were beaten and tortured by the musclemen of the brothel keepers to induct them into the trade. ?Initially, when I refused to serve the clients, I would be slashed with a blade all over my body or singed with cigarette butts,? recounted Anwara, who was rescued from a brothel in Mumbai.

 Parveen Kumar, North 24-Parganas police superintendent, said: ?Whenever we receive a specific case of trafficking, we send out teams to rescue the girl. But often, the complaints are not with specific locations, making it difficult for us to trace the girl.?

 Top five Bengali films

 Tolly on telly: Mellow drama

The top five Bengali movies on the small screen between August 29 and September 4, as per the Television Audience Measurement (TAM) data, are as follows. 

Rakhi Purnima on ETV Bangla, 

telecast on Thursday, September 2, scored as low as 3.81 on the ratings scale, 

yet managed to come out on top.

 Ajana Path on Doordarshan, telecast on Sunday, August 29, scored 2.97 on the TRP scale and finished second best for the week

 Sabar Opore Maa on ETV Bangla, telecast on Wednesday, September 1, scored 2.81 making it third on the list.

 Jibon Niye Khela on ETV Bangla, telecast on Tuesday, August 31, came fourth with a score of 2.63.

 Jibon Jouban on ETV Bangla, telecast on Monday, August 30, scored 2.18 on the TRP scale, making it the fifth most watched Bengali film of the week.

 Mush and melodrama. That?s the story of this week?s chart. On the channel challenge front, an impressive four of the top five are from the ETV stable with a single offering from the national broadcaster. ETV seems to be blazing on all guns, with its programmes ? be it for children or soaps ? regularly making the top picks? list.

 The ratings prove the point that today?s crop of Bengali films actually have a viewership. That, despite evergreen Uttam-Suchitra starrers being regularly beamed on all regional channels.

 Morning-walker tormentor held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Morning-walkers in south Calcutta can breathe a sigh of relief. 

 Vijay Shahranier (23), the mastermind of a motorcycle-borne gang that would rob morning-walkers, fell into the police net around 5 pm on Friday, 12 hours after he targetted a woman in Tollygunge.

 Police recovered a gold bangle, which was snatched from the woman, and a loaded revolver from his possession.

 ?Vijay is from a well-to-do family in Sakherbazar, Behala. His two accomplices have been identified. They will be arrested soon,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 According to Sharma, the gang had started operations a few weeks ago, and within a short period had become the terror of morning-walkers in south Calcutta. 

 ?We came to know of their modus operandi after investigating a string of incidents across south Calcutta,? he said.

 Vijay and his associates looted four wealthy morning-walkers within a span of an hour ? 5.30 am to 6.30 am ? on October 16. The strikes were made at New Alipore, Maddox Square, Southern Avenue and at the intersection of Alipore Road and Burdwan Road.

 ?During the course of preliminary investigation, we went through all the complaints and found that the style of operation was similar. It proved that all the crimes were committed by the same gang,? said Sharma, adding: ?We activated our network of sources and gradually started getting information about the gang.?

 Police swung into action following Friday?s strike. ?The gang had intercepted a woman around 5.45 am on Nalini Ranjan Avenue, in the Tollygunge police station area, and snatched a bangle and a chain from her at gun-point. By 1 pm, we had identified the gang and chalked out a blueprint to arrest the members,? said an officer of the south division.

 ?On a tip-off that one of the gang members would be at the Taratala crossing around 4.30 pm, we deployed policemen in plain clothes in the area. Vijay came around 5.15 pm. As soon as we started moving towards him, he fled. But we chased him down,? said the official. 

 Vijay, who hails from a business family, confessed to carrying out a string of snatchings in October with his accomplices. He also said that he was a B.Com student in a college in south Calcutta.

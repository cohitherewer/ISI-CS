 Power back-up lack in most hospitals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If the death of at least two babies in BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children on Monday was because of a power cut and the absence of an alternative supply line, the tragedy is waiting to strike in other hospitals, too.

 Most hospitals, including a few ?top-bracket? private ones, don?t have a second line of defence to tackle power cuts. Some private hospitals fall back on generators. And among the government hospitals, a few are armed with hotline facilities, but for select departments only.

 ?If anyone applies for an alternative line, we definitely look into it,? said D.N. Majumdar, CESC executive director (distribution). According to the power utility officials, generators are the only means to salvage a BC Roy-like situation. 

 But hospitals such as RG Kar and National Medical do not have generators. ?We do have a separate phase, but that can help us run services in select departments only. We don?t have generator facilities, because it?s a huge (read costly) affair,? said Pradip Mitra, RG Kar superintendent. 

 On Tuesday, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra revealed that the government was planning to instal alternative power lines in all hospitals.

 There have been recent instances of patients being asked to leave the radiotherapy department of Medical College because of a prolonged power failure. ?We have emergency lines, but we don?t have generators,? said A. Biswas, deputy superintendent.

 In the wake of the BC Roy tragedy, most hospitals now feel the need to take fresh stock of the situation. ?Getting an alternative power line is definitely an option,? said S.B. Purokayastha, president of AMRI Hospitals. 

 Superintendent Pradip Mitra said the RG Kar authorities were considering applying for an alternative supply line and generator facilities for the operating theatre. ?We have already installed a generator at our blood bank,? he added. 

 Sajal Dutta, president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, said: ?If there?s a fault in a transformer, even alternative supply systems won?t work. Only generators can save us then.?

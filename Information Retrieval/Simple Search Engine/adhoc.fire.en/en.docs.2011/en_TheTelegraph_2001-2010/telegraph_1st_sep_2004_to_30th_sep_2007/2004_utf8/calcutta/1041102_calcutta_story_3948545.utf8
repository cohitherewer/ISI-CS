The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Woman power pack

The 

spirit of womanhood was celebrated with the right combo of beauty and brains at 

the Far Pavilion on Tollygunge Club on a star-studded Sunday evening. 

 Singer Usha Uthup and danseuse Tanusree Shankar regaled with a power-packed performance, while fashion designer Anamika Khanna provided the glitter and the glamour with the unveiling of her fall-winter collection. All elements combined to form Stree Shakti or the many facets of womanhood. 

 The show of strength was witnessed by audiences from 

different shores as well. Special American guests for the evening ? Terry George, 

Micheal Brandon and Thomas E. Bach ? MDs of Fortune 500 companies on a business 

trip to the city, looked visibly wowed by the cultural and fashion extravaganza. 

 ?The internationally renowned women of Calcutta got 

a truly international audience,? said Sanjay Budhia, chairman, export council, 

Confederation of Indian Industry, and one of the sponsors for the event.

Other attractions were provided by Piu Sarkar, who 

sketched her interpretation of Stree Shakti, June who spoke of her experiences 

as an actress, designers Mona and Pali who shared their own achievements as designers. 

 The guest list also included singer Swastika and curator Reshmi Chatterjee. Oindrilla Dutt, the co-ordinator for the evening, kept the show rolling with interesting anecdotes and free-flowing conversation with the leading ladies. 

 Wicked wink

 Smooching their partner in public was about as wicked as Calcutta got this Saturday night. And all thanks to MTV VJ Sophiya?s call to dare the do at the Get Wicked Seagram Fling night at Winning Streak, HHI. 

 Part of the country-wide Get Wicked tour to promote the flavoured vodka, in association with MTV, the evening saw a sporting crowd walk away with Fling bottles, T-shirts and even cameras as prizes. 

 The sultry VJ vibed with the party people to bring their naughty fantasies to the surface. ?What filmi dialogue would you use if you come home after a hard day?s work to find your wife smooching your best friend?? was her best effort of the evening, though. The prize to which went to a vengeful: ?Kutte mein tera khun pee jaunga!? 

 Daring the crowd to dance to item numbers was the high point of the evening one can?t fling out of the memory in a hurry!

 Castle crown

 They made castles in the night air about dating South African cricketers and did a salsa jig in happy anticipation. It all happened right here in Tantra, at the Castle Lager night, the second in the series organised by Shaw Wallace to build up the mood leading up to the daddy of all galas on November 26, where South African cricketers will be feted at a glittering party at Taj Bengal. 

 For the moment, the city grooved to a different beat at the disco and participated in the myriad competitions with gusto. Mayuri and Sanju emerged the lucky winners, who?ll get the entry permit to the hallowed party and the opportunity of a lifetime to interact with the cricketers, who?ll be in town for the forthcoming test series between India and South Africa. 

 The losers danced along in any case to pulsating Latino numbers like Volare and Bamboleo by Gypsy Kings, Rhythm?s Gonna Get You and Oye! by Gloria Estefan, Guantanamera by Wyclef Jean, Smooth and Corazon Espinado by Santana, churned out to perfection by the new house DJs ? Vishal, Abhishek, Oblix and Andy.

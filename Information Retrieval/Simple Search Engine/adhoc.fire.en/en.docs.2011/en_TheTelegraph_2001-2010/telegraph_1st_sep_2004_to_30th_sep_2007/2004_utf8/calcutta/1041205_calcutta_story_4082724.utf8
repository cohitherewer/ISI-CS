The Pomeranian puzzle

Nilanjanaa

Today, Pomeranians serve as a companion dog ideally 

suited to city and suburban households. Though not really a guard dog, they are 

very alert. The Pom?s sharp bark sounds a warning when strangers approach or anything 

unusual occurs. 

They are very intelligent and many have been successfully 

trained as hearing assistance and therapy dogs. Pomeranians thrive in a busy family 

atmosphere and love to be pampered. They make excellent companions for the elderly. 

Also, Poms can live in harmony with other pets.

Major concerns: Unstable temperaments. Most 

Poms are bred and sold by people who don?t have the slightest idea of how to breed 

good-tempered dogs. So one comes across lots of Poms with neurotic behaviour, 

including biting, extreme fearfulness and moodiness.

Socialisation: Without proper socialisation, 

Poms can become anxious and lack confidence. They need extensive exposure. Control 

barking from Day One so that your Pom doesn?t become sharp or shrill.

Training and grooming: The Pom is not a submissive 

breed. Through early training, show them that you mean what you say. Poms do not 

need a large amount of exercise. To keep their thick coat free of mats, Poms require 

regular brushing, combing, trimming and monthly bathing.

Health: Poms are a very healthy breed, living 

for 14 to 20 years. But like most toy breeds, they frequently lose most of their 

teeth at an early age. Counter this with regular brushing.

 In 1984, he had been part of probably the last contact party to a remote Andaman island, inhabited by a hostile vanishing tribe. For the short duration of the ?contact?, while anthropologists and scientists had tried to take in the habits of the little-known warriors on the North Sentinelese island, B.P. Maiti had clicked away at the shutters.

 ?We had to leave the deserted island in 15 minutes, as we were sure invisible eyes were watching us. And amazingly, within the next few moments, as we left the island and rowed back to the ship, the white beach started swarming with purplish-blue people armed with bows, arrows and rustic rafts,? remembers Maiti, a retired bank officer and passionate photographer, whose works, titled The Land and the People were exhibited at Gaganendra Pradarshashala recently.

 It has been a long journey for Maiti. A student and lecturer of history, he worked with State Bank of India for over 32 years before retiring in 2001 as deputy general manager. ?Photography has been my passion for around 25 years. My job took me all over the country and I did not miss any opportunity to take photographs,? said Maiti. And from the display at the exhibition, he seems to have been everywhere ? ?any place that has colour and the charm of a story of simple lives led on their own terms?. 

 Thus, there were pictures of vanishing tribes in the Andamans, Apatani women and children in remote Zero in Arunachal Pradesh, the exotic dance of headhunters in Nagaland, the walk of a Gujjari girl in the backdrop of the endless desert, the myriad hues of the Pushkar Mela of Rajasthan, the snake-boat race of Allepey, Ganesh and Durga immersion in Mumbai, the Goa Carnival in Panjim and many more.

 ?Each picture has a story to tell,? explained Maiti. Pointing at photos of Jarwa youth, he said, ?They came swimming to our lifeboat. We had won them over with pieces of red cloth and boiled rice. The women seemed more perceptive than the men. They attracted the men?s attention to my camera. The men then wanted to snatch my camera from me.?

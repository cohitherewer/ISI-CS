 Towering personality that Vidyasagar was, it would take a very major exhibition, indeed, to cover even one aspect of his life. 

 With very very limited resources at its disposal, Bangiya Sahitya Parishat has mounted an exhibition that highlights the publications, manuscripts, letters, portraits, and statues of the great social reformer and scholar. In spite of his severity, he had an inner core of tenderness that Michael Madhusudan Dutt had compared with a Bengali mother?s soft nature. 

 The exhibition is meant to mark the 185th birth anniversary of the man from Birsingha, who has touched the lives of all Bengali-speaking people.

 The Parishat itself has a remarkable clay likeness of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, complete with grave expression, that was executed by Jadunath Pal at the end of 19th Century and had been in the possession of the Tagores of Jorasanko. Gaganendranath had gifted it to the Parishat. 

 In 1899, Durga Mistri had carved another likeness out of marble that was installed in College Square. It was decapitated during the Naxalite movement. In 1907 an Italian had sculpted another statue that cannot be found any longer. 

 Vidyasagar Smritimandir possesses a full-length wooden likeness of Vidyasagar that was carved out of a single block of wood at the house of former chief minister Prafulla Chandra Sen. It was executed by Kshetromohan Bhaskar, who was provided with his bread and board in return. The photographs of all the statues are on display.

 There are besides, a series of prints by Annadaprasad Bagchi of Vidyasagar and his parents Bhagabati Debi and Thakurdas Bandopadhyay, and another of Vidyasagar at the burning ghat. We see the familiar photograph of the man taken by Bourne amp; Shepherd as reprinted by the studio of D. Ratan. There is a copy of a rare photograph taken by Manmatha Ghosh, which shows that Vidyasagar was justifiably famous for his large cranium.

 There are also the photographs of the many houses in Calcutta where Vidyasagar had lived from time to time? 13 Dayehata Street (Digambar Jain Temple Street), Hidaram Banerjee Lane, Sanskrit College, Amherst Street (where he had opened the Sanskrit Press and Depository after resigning from Sanskrit College), Sukeas Street (where the first widow remarriage ceremony took place), and his own house in Badurbagan, hideously rebuilt of late.

 Admirers of Vidyasagar?s writing can see the first editions of such publications as Betal Panchabingshati, Shakuntala, Bhrantibilas, Kathamala and Byakaran Koumudi. Reviews of his works form a part of the collection of contemporary publications on Vidyasagar. 

 The pages showing two letters of the Bengali alphabet (third and fourth) are displayed in his manuscript of Shabdasangraha. 

 Perhaps unwittingly, the exhibition reveals some human aspects of Vidyasagar?s personality. Here are photocopies of letters and extracts from diaries. His famous resignation letter to Rasomoy Datta, secretary of Sanskrit College, is here. 

 So is a letter to Chandramukhi, the first woman with a master?s degree, to whom he had gifted a copy of Shakespeare?s works.

 Though Vidyasagar was a pucca Bengali in his dress, he was a strict disciplinarian like many Englishmen of his time. But in an entry in his diary written in English, he shows he was quite a Bengali as well, obsessed with bowel movement. 

 It goes thus: After a restless and sleepless night, ??stools hard, large and dry, passed with difficulty and after much straining.? 

 He went on to describe the homoeopathic nostrums he took. Sahitya Parishat has in its possession the huge collection of Vidyasagar?s books, with tooled and engraved morocco covers. The public, at last, has access to these. 

 The Parishat has in its possession priceless treasures and canvases that are rotting away. The hall should be cleaned forthwith, and the art objects deserve to be displayed with befitting dignity.

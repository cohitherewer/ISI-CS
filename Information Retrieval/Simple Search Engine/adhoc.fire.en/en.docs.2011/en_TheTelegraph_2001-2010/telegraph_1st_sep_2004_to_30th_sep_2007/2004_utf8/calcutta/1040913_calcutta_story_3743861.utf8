The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Criminal activities have gone up in many pockets of the city where street lighting 

is not adequate. Especially, the areas near the Rabindra Sarobar Metro station 

and the local train tracks are crime hubs. It seems the police post set up here 

is no deterrent for a dozen youngsters who live in makeshift shanties near the 

flyover construction site. Local residents mistake them for daily wage-earners. 

The local police should verify their credentials and keep an eye on their activities.

 There are scores of youngsters who drop out of school because of financial 

constraints. Some are simply unable to cope up with studies. Instead of treating 

them as a burden to the society, the state should start job oriented courses in 

high schools for them. Courses in dress designing, soft-toy making and repairing 

of electronic goods can help them become financially independent.

 While most private buses display the fare chart, minibuses are avoiding the 

practice. Passengers are often unable to prove that the conductor is charging 

the wrong fare. The public vehicles department should issue a stricture to the 

minibus operators to put up the fare chart inside the buses.

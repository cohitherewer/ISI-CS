The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 September is the month of movies and money and a mix of them. Every Wednesday at 9 pm, Star Movies will be showing all those Hollywood biggies that grossed more than $100 million at the box-office. This special series has already got off to a flying start with blockbusters like Pearl Harbor and Ice Age beamed on consecutive Wednesdays.

 If you missed the two, don?t worry there?s much more coming your way. Next Wednesday, it?s Good Morning Vietnam, starring Robin Williams and Forest Whitaker. Considered to be Williams? breakthrough film, the movie is based on a true story about a non-conformist with a wicked sense of humour. The 1987 film had opened at the pole position in 785 cinemas and earned around $123.92 million.

 On September 22, it will be time again for a tryst with A Few Good Men. Catch Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) and Lieutenant Commander Jo Ann Galloway (Demi Moore) take on Colonel Nathan Jessep (Jack Nicholson) in a desperate bid to get to the truth behind Operation Code Red. The movie opened at no.1 in 1,925 cinemas and the total box-office collection equalled $141.34 million.

 And finally on the last Wednesday, it will be time for the Lucas look with Star Wars: Episode II ? Attack of the Clones. With superior special effects and great visuals (read Natalie Portman, in picture right), this is a good addition to the Star Wars saga. The box-office earnings for this film was $310.67 million and it opened as no.1 in 3,161 cinemas.

 Dia Mirza: Kiss Miss

 Let?s not deny it ? we have all seen her doing it in the telly trailers. The coy Dia Mirza locking lips with co-star Emraan Hashmi for their new film Tumsa Nahin Dekha, to release on September 24 in the city theatres and multiplexes. It is coming of age for the girl who could only be seen in her salwars and saris in the earlier releases like Rehnaa Hai Tere Dil Mein and Deewanapan. 

 ?Come on, it?s not really a sexual kiss,? protested Dia. ?This guy comes out of the car, gets attracted to this girl on the street and goes and kisses her. Obviously, he isn?t in his senses in the film. But the kiss was really important to the script as it actually triggers the journey between the two.?

 But the cameras didn?t roll quite so smoothly. ?I was damn scared and embarrassed. It was a busy Mumbai street and that too in broad daylight. There were more than 700 people watching us. I had never done something like this before,? recalled Dia.

 And it was her co-star Emraan who made things easier for her. ?I went up to him and said ?Emraan, please don?t do the proper kiss, kiss?. So he replied, ?Why don?t you keep your teeth clenched??. Which is exactly what I did. If you watch it properly, my teeth are clenched together when the kiss happens.?

 Don?t sweat Dia ? at least you and Emraan did better than real-life couples Vivek-Ash and Shahid-Kareena. Their on-screen kisses after all were nothing to go fida over (in fact, kyun, ho gaya kya... was the question to ask about the blink-and-you-miss liplocks).

Chopra and Preity: Rhythm rules

 All ears are tuned to September 19, when Yash Raj 

Music launches the album of Yash Chopra?s new film Veer-Zaara (starring 

Shah Rukh, Preity and Rani). Billed as the most melodious musical in years, the 

album features 11 songs composed by the late Madan Mohan. 

 The coming together of the three legends of Indian cinema in Chopra, Madan Mohan and Lata Mangeshkar is momentous enough. With lyrics by Javed Akhtar, the album also features singers like Udit Narayan, Sonu Nigam, Gurdas Mann, Roop Kumar Rathod and the Hussain brothers ? Ahmed and Mohammed. There is also a rare duet by Lata and Jagjit Singh.

 Even the music mix is quite impressive with two emotional songs, three love ballads, a folk number, a grand qawwali, a patriotic track and a youthful composition. There?s more music for the ears with the Veer-Zaara audio CD coming in a 2-CD pack, including a special disc featuring the making of the songs. 

 Who is the perfect man? Nominations will range from Brad Pitt to Hrithik Roshan. But there might be others closer home. In what is likely to be a morale-booster and an eye-opener for many a member of the male species, Discovery channel has started a reality show The Perfect Man that aims to turn near-Neanderthals into men that women will love. Nine guys and one teacher on an isolated retreat from where there is no escape is the setting for the date every Saturday, 8 pm.

 Taking three romance reprobates at a time, Kate Marlow, the coach, attempts to knock them into shape in just five days to face the brave new world of women. With her straight-forward approach and brutal humour, she probes their mind and unravels their failings so that they can progress from there on. Add to that communication classes, confidence-building exercises and soul-searching. If these prepare them mentally, fitness experts work on their appearance and skills. After all, the metrosexual man today needs to be clued in on styling and dancing as well. Surely, an hour of tips worth picking up.

 Here?s news for both Tolkien and history fans. After 

catching up all three films in the Lord of the Rings series on the big 

screen and applauding The Return of the King, the third, sweeping the Oscars 

this year, there?s something exciting on offer on the small screen as well. Hosted 

by John Rhys-Davies, who played Gimli in the trilogy, the programme uses the characters, 

events and themes of Tolkien?s stories of Middle Earth to explore some of human 

history?s great heroes and intriguing conflicts. Personalities like William Wallace, 

Queen Elizabeth I and Theodore Roosevelt, and events like the Battle of Britain, 

the American Civil War and the Battle of Agincourt are seen in new light. It is 

all a part of National Geographic?s blockbuster series called Beyond the Movies, 

Sunday, 10 pm.

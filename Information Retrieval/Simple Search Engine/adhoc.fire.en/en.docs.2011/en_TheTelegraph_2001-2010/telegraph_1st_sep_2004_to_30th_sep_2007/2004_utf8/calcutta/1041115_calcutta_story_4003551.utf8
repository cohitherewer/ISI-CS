Style stop

 It has only been open a few weeks, but CIMA Design is quickly establishing itself for the taste and quality of its collection of handicrafts, artefacts, jewellery and designer clothes.

 The ?design-centric store?, on the fourth floor of Forum, the Elgin Road mall, opened in August with its unique offering of finely-crafted artefacts and lifestyle products by rural artisans and designer names.

With the runaway success of Art in Life, an annual 

lifestyle exhibition and sale at CIMA Gallery in Ballygunge, Rakhi and Pratiti 

Basu Sarkar started this store to reach similar items to shoppers through the 

year (pictures by Pabitra Das).

Label count

 Designers Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Raghavendra Rathore, Sonam Dubal and Rajesh Pratap Singh were part of the inaugural collection at the store. The wearable yet unique clothes have been specially designed for CIMA. All garments ? whether Indian or India-influenced ? retain an ethnic touch.

 The selection will be constantly changed, and additions have already been made in the form of men?s wear by Sayon Mitra, with Nandita Basu?s collection to follow.

 Precious jewellery has been in focus this season, and Raj Mahtani, known for his own store Satramdas Dhalamal, has designed a ?lower-end line? for CIMA.

 In the home decor segment, Michael Aram, a US metalware designer with a workshop in Delhi, has gone down well with city buyers. Fresh stock of his classy, useful pieces ? including bowls, vases and candlesticks ? keeps rolling in. The fine finishing is what has been best received, feels chief administrator, CIMA, Pratiti Basu Sarkar.

 Master touch

 Attention to detail is what sets the store apart. It is not the place for buyers looking for bulk. Many of those whose works are displayed at CIMA Design are award-winning artisans. 

 The hand behind a Durga image in bronze is a National-Award winning one. The eight-and-a-half inch tall idol is striking for its detailing and superb finishing ? qualities often lost in the quest for affordability.

 Jamewar weaves have been revived on lighter fabrics to make them more wearable. Bringing back lost motifs required new looms to be made by weavers. The selection starts at Rs 16,000.

 There is a large selection of tribal artefacts to choose from. Silver jewellery from across the country, bags by a Kutch tribe, Sami quilts stitched by the snake charmers of another nomadic tribe, wall hangings from Lambada and Rabadi tribes, can all be found here.

 Often, the creations are sourced through NGOs working with the tribals, with raw materials provided by CIMA to ensure there are no problems with quality control.

Breeding ground

 New designers are also being given a platform by the design store. Wraps and bags by young talent share shelf space with their established counterparts. A range of zari bags from the Senoli label, the perfect accessory for a party, comes at under Rs 500.

 The store will also provide craftsmen a platform to interface with professionals, hope its owners. 

 ?Everyone bemoans the mediocre quality of products available on the market. We need to educate people about our long lineage of craft,? feels Pratiti Basu Sarkar.

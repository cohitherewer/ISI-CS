 Court passes quota buck 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday chose not to interfere in the contempt petition filed by students who have cleared the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) but have been denied medical seats, and left it to the Supreme Court to decide.

 The students had moved the high court in September, challenging the government?s decision to admit medical students from the NRI quota by depriving their candidature.

 On September 29, Justice Indira Banerjee of the high court had cancelled the NRI-quota admissions and directed the government to immediately admit candidates who had successfully cleared JEE 2003 to this year?s MBBS course at SSKM and Midnapore medical colleges.

 The government, however, moved a special leave petition before the Supreme Court, which modified the earlier order, allowing 15 per cent seats to be reserved for NRI-quota candidates.

 On Tuesday, the deprived students alleged before the court that the two court directives were not followed by the government. 

 They demanded contempt proceedings against C.R. Maiti, director of medical education, and Jayshree Mitra, chairman of the central selection committee and principal of Medical College and Hospital.

 Justice Banerjee stated in her order that since both the government and the quota candidates had moved the Supreme Court and since the apex court had modified the high court order, it would not be wise for her to hear the matter.

 By evening, the students had started making preparations to move a contempt plea before the apex court. 

 ?We are happy that the state government will have to listen to the apex court?s directive,? said Mridul Sarkar, their spokesman.

 The All Bengal Students? Action Forum and other healthcare agencies have decided to support their cause.

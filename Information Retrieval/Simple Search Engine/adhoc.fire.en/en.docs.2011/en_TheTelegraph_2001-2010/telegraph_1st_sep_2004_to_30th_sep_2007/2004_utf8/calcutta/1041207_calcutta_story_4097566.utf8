 Alanis Morissette: Thank you India

 Immienently watchable 

The theme is horror, in focus is music and the purpose 

is to honour all those who have wowed listeners with lyrics and tunes. Nope, it?s 

not a circus, it?s an award show. 

 MTV IMMIES 2004 will be telecast live on December 10 on the music channel, with a repeat on December 19. 

 The big draw this year is guaranteed to be Alanis Morissette, one of the two international artistes who will be performing at the event in Mumbai, the other being Darius. 

 The Canadian singer burst onto the music scene in 1995 with the album Jagged Little Pill. Seven Grammy Awards later, Alanis is going strong. 

 Always one for controversy, she ordained a minister earlier this year after completing an online course, just so she could marry off her gay friends, in defiance of the Bush administration?s attitude to same-sex unions. 

 Now, the 30-year-old, famous for hits like Ironic and Thank you, is all set to grace the Indian stage for the first time.

 Darius Danesh, on the other hand, is a newcomer, but has managed to build quite a formidable young fan following since the single Colourblind. The part-Persian Scotsman shot to fame in the TV programme Popstars, in the UK. 

 The 24-year-old subsequently signed up with a producer after appearing on another show, Pop Idol. He has scorched the screen in his music videos, and it?s time to catch him live in action. 

 Apart from the international attractions, adding a bit of desi glamour on centrestage will be the first lady of Indian cricket, Mandira Bedi. 

 Co-host MTV VJ Cyrus Broacha will no doubt liven up the proceedings with his unique brand of irreverent humour.

 The nominees have been announced, with the likes of Hrithik Roshan (Lakshya), Sanjay Dutt (Munnabhai MBBS), Mallika Sherawat (Murder) and Kareena Kapoor (Fida) on the lengthy list. 

 If you want to have your say, log on to www.mtvindia. com and check out the nominations in the popular categories, for the viewer?s choice vote.

 Simply SMS the name of your favourite artiste and ?IMMIES? to 6882 or dial 1250-122 (BSNL). And don?t forget to catch the show on Sony Entertainment Television.

Madhubala as Anarkali: Soul tune

 Theatres around town are now playing one of Indian cinema?s biggest blockbusters, Mughal-e-Azam. And now there?s good news for all those Madhubala fans who missed Mohabbat ki jhooti kahaani pe roye in the new-look film with Dolby sound. The dungeon dirge has been revived in the colour version, on popular viewer demand. 

 Featuring the leading lady manacled in chains, the song depicts her pain after Emperor Akbar (Prithviraj Kapoor) learns of the love between his son Salim (Dilip Kumar) and Anarkali (Madhubala). 

 India?s nightingale, Lata Mangeshkar, has lent her voice to the haunting melody of hurt set to Naushad?s music. The classic film in its new avatar is now featuring this additional song. 

 It?s the Nobel season (no, nothing to do with Santiniketan for a change!) and BBC World has a number of programmes lined up to celebrate the awarding of the highest honours in various fields.

 December 11 will see back-to-back programmes on the Nobel prize as well as some of its winners. 

 Nobel Winners is first off the list at 1.40 pm. Since 1901, the prize has celebrated outstanding achievements in various fields of academic and social work. Prizes presently awarded cover physics, chemistry, medicine, economics, literature and peace. In Nobel Winners, this year?s awardees and their achievements will be profiled.

 A special spotlight, like every year, is on the peace prize. At 5 pm, Nobel Peace will profile the 2004 winner for peace, Iranian lawyer Shirin Ebadi. 

 The prize was awarded to Ebadi ?for her efforts for democracy and human rights? and also for her special focus on ?the struggle for the rights of women and children?.

 At 5.40 pm, Nik Gowing will chair a debate from Stockholm (the home of the Nobel prize), in which this year?s winners gather to discuss their works, achievements and their relevance to some of the major issues of the time.

 If you can?t catch these programmes on December 11, tune in the next day for the repeats.

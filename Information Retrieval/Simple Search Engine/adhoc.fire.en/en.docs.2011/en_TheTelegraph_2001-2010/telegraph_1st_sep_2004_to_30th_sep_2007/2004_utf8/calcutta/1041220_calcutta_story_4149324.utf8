 HEALTHY SIGNS: Matri Bhavan, in south Calcutta, caters to the poorest of poor

 Sunita Guin, who lives in a south Calcutta slum, works as a maid to earn her livelihood. Manju, Sunita?s neighbour, sells paper packets to support her husband. 

 For the two women and hundreds of others like them, motherhood is going to be much more pleasant, thanks to a hospital run by the nuns of Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, Dakshineswar.

 The hospital, Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Matri Bhavan, is poised for a major upgrade. The authorities have earmarked over Rs 4 crore for the purpose. A community project is also being finalised to ensure that the poorest of the poor benefit from the hospital facilities.

 The Sree Mohan Lane hospital, near the Rashbehari crossing, has 15 neo-natal beds and 64 beds in the obstetrics and gynaecology wing.

 Two state-of-the-art operation theatres, a post-surgery observation room, a critical care unit for new mothers and a neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU) are to be added to the list of facilities on offer. Laparoscopic surgery and other facilities are also on the cards. 

 A new floor is being added to the two-storeyed building as part of the expansion project. ?We have plans to spend Rs 2.5 crore for introducing the new facilities,? said Pravrajika Bhaktiparna, vice-president of Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, and secretary of the hospital. 

 She said a new 15-bed gynaecology ward is also coming up at the hospital. ?We will renovate the sick-baby unit for setting up the NICU. We will instal centralised oxygen and nitrous oxide supply, and suction facilities,? she added. 

 The Matri Bhavan authorities also plan to start a free baby clinic, for which negotiations are on for a plot in the locality. Every year, 15,000 children are immunised at the hospital. With the number increasing, the need for a new building is being felt.

 ?We have 50 doctors and 36 nurses to take care of the additional patients who will come here for treatment after the facilities are upgraded,? a hospital official said. ?Once the project is complete, we hope to streamline the infrastructure and start work on the community project,? he added.

 As part of the project, volunteers will identify locals living below the poverty line and in need of treatment, and bring them to the hospital. Initially, a survey will be conducted to identify the below-poverty-line population in the area.

 ?We provide free treatment to 10 per cent of our patients. We will try to ensure that the patients who cannot afford treatment are served under the quota,? the official said. 

 In addition to the scheme, babies born at the hospital to poor mothers will be provided medicine, food supplements and specialised care free.

 The mission also promotes holistic care of the family through a range of community activities aimed at promoting self-reliance among mothers and children.

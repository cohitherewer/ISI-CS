 Coming to the rescue of birds and beasts 

 - Rising 

animal mortality rate

Three two-day old jungle cats were ?rescued? by 

an NGO from Narendrapur on the southern fringes of the city. The baby cats were 

unweaned and were apparently abandoned by their mothers. They died in the custody 

of the NGO.

 A baby monkey was found abandoned on a tree in Howrah. Local people reported this to an NGO. Its workers took it to their ?rescue centre?. A few days later, the baby monkey died. 

 Many such animals and birds ? injured, orphaned or abandoned ? die because the staff of social organisations that work for the welfare of birds and animals are inexperienced. Concerned at the growing rate of deaths of ?rescued? animals and birds, the government plans to train these NGOs on how to look after these creatures. The training programme will be held at Deer Park in Salt Lake?s AE block on Tuesday.

 ?We will train them on the methods of rescuing animals and birds, treating them and the laws to set up their own rescue centres,? V.K. Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden of state forest department, said on Sunday. 

 In the case of the baby jungle cats, lack of experience was the cause of their deaths, an official said. ?Their mother could have gone in search of food, leaving her babies behind. But local people and the NGO concerned thought that they were abandoned and so picked them up,? he said, adding that proper awareness will bring down the toll.

 ?Most NGOs setting up their own rescue centres are not aware of rules. They need the approval of the Central Zoo Authority for setting up such centres and must follow the guidelines,? the official said. In many cases, the NGOs do not feel confident about rescuing wild animals and they end up merely reporting the case to the forest department. ?In a number of cases, our personnel take time to reach the spot as it may be far from their rescue centre, causing mortal damage to the animal or bird,? the official said.

 According to officials, small birds, monkeys, langoors, jackals, civet cats, jungle cats and snakes are the most vulnerable animals which face a threat from both human beings and bigger animals. Often baby monkeys are kept as pets but after they grow up, they are abandoned. Afraid, these monkeys create problems in neighbourhoods, thereby coming under attack. Since January, the forest department has rescued 80 birds, 20 civets, 26 monkeys, one porcupine, one jungle cat and two fishing cats. 

 The department?s wildlife rescue centres are at: Deer Park in Salt Lake?s AE Block, Madari Hat near Jaldapara, Rajabhatkhawa near Buxa Tiger Reserve, Lataguri near Garumara National Park, Kurseong, Ramana Bagan in Burdwan, Jhargram Mini Zoo, wildlife sanctuary in Birbhum, Deer Park in Nadia and Garchumuk in Howrah.

 The forest department recently rescued a porcupine from Andul and a peacock from Hooghly. ?We were lucky to save these endangered animals and birds. But in many cases we are not so fortunate,? an official said.

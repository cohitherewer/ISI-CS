The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Madam in the middle

 Have they found her a suitable boy? No, not as yet. But her producers are trying their best, pairing her up with just about every screenworthy man in tinsel town ? from the boyish Jishu Sengupta to the cerebral Sabyasachi Chakraborty, the Mumbaiyya Sharad Kapoor to the Bangali Firdaus. Plus the latest import, Priyanshu Chatterjee. 

 Yet, the leading lady of Tollywood has only half her mind here ? Rituparna Sengupta is back chasing big dreams by the Arabian Sea.

 Conspicuously missing in action for the five festive days, when the rest of the Tolly brigade hopped around pandals picking the best pujas, the Bengali film industry?s most bankable heroine hopped into a morning flight to Mumbai armed with her Bollywood comeback ticket ? Chandan Arora?s Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh. 

 And Rituparna sure is aiming high ? with the UTV production having Sahara as producer, a director trained under Ram Gopal Varma and some seasoned co-actors. 

 Rituparna plays a beautiful wife to Rajpal Yadav who has a man (Kay Kay Menon) in his life in Arora?s second directorial venture after Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon. ?Chandan had seen some of my films and liked me very much. I loved the script as the subject is interesting and my character is different too. She is taller than her husband and has an impressive personality. It?s a very good team I have got to work with,? says she.

 Set in Lucknow, a large portion of Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh will be shot in the UP capital. The music is being composed by Silk Route while Shreya Ghosal and Sonu Nigam will sing playback. ?And I am taking lessons to bring a Bareilly touch to my Hindi,? adds Rituparna.

 Back home, eight Bengali ventures await her attention ? some to start shooting, several on the floors and a few ready for release. The leading man line-up reads like this: Jishu, Firdaus, Sharad Kapoor, Shilajit, Sabyasachi Chakraborty and Priyanshu Chatterjee.

 ?I really can?t think of anyone who can be a permanent hero. I am also surviving without a proper hero. So, I don?t understand when people talk about a one-man industry only. Am I not running a one-woman industry? I have done all sorts of roles, glamorous to the arthouse kind. Buddhadebda (Dasgupta) had offered me a role in his next film but I couldn?t take it for Chandan?s film. And I am trying to balance home and career,? asserts Rituparna, shuttling between Calcutta, Washington, Singapore and Bangalore, often along with husband Sanjay. 

 ?And I have to take care of my home production Prism Entertainment, which is rolling out our second film Bouma Zindabad after Aalo. Our house may work with Rituparno Ghosh and we are likely to be discussing that in the near future. But my hands are full now,? she adds with satisfaction.

 For now, it?s Bollywood Ho!

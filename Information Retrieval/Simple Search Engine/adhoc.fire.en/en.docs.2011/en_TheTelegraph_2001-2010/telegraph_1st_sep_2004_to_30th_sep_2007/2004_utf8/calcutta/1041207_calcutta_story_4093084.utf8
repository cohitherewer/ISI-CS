 In pursuit of creative excellence

 Excellence in art is an ever-receding horizon. What is remarkable about the paintings of R.K. Sharma is a consistent endeavour to touch this horizon and even surpass it. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by Sharma brings together a magnificent collection of classic art, heritage and prodigal talent, offering art enthusiasts an opportunity to witness what can best be described as studies in artistic excellence. Featuring miniature paintings and portraits on historical, ethnic and devotional themes, the exhibition illustrates a beautiful blend of art and craft through paintings embellished with precious stones and adorned with liquid and foil gold. Sharma?s paintings, following traditional methods and techniques using vegetable dyes and stone colours, add a unique lustre and brilliance to his works. His success in working with various media and on different surfaces, exploring subjects that reveal the artist?s personal and emotional attachment towards them, offers a wholly new dimension to his art.

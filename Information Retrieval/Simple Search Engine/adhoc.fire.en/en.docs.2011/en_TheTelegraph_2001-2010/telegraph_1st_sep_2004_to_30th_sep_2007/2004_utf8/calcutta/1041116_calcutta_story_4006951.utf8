The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Behind the bar

Vodka, the zero cool drink, in today?s context isn?t 

just something that says ?look at me? but ?gulp me down and sit back for a mind-blowing 

experience!? 

Its chameleon like nature makes it the most mixable 

of spirits that can be used in hundreds of ground-breaking blends. 

From the distillation of a fermented grain mash to 

the fiery liquid that can rip your thoughts of the words that describe them leaving 

them numb and naked, with vodka there are just no hang-ups! 

Versatile vodka is the ?one in a million? kind of 

alcohol that puts you in control. Have it the way you like it and don?t forget 

to say as the Russians would, ?Na Zdorovia!? We tried the recipes with Smirnoff 

vodka, but you can experiment with any of the brands available.

Tarbooz spiked with vodka ? Funnily Scrumptious!

Ingredients

1 large, ripe tarbooz/watermelon 

(smell and slap it to check ripeness), 1 bottle vodka

Method

Simply cut a hole in the top 

of the melon, wide and deep enough to insert a funnel. Pour vodka into the melon 

through the funnel, leave to sit for a day. The fruit will absorb the liquid. 

Pour in some more the next day until it becomes saturated. Slice up and savour 

the stimulating twist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Stage On amp; Off

We, the women

 June: Between the lines

A seven-woman cast read out excerpts from American 

author Eve Ensler?s seminal play to a room spilling over with people at Crossword 

Bookstore on Wednesday evening. Among the audience who were offered a seat ? and 

those who had jostled in thereafter ? were film-maker Aparna Sen, writer Nabaneeta 

Dev Sen and stage actress Dolly Basu. 

 Dressed in black with a hint of red, the select team of June, Anindita Sarbadhicari, Sudeshna Roy, Deboleena Dutta, Poonam Singh and Somini Sen Dua (replacement for Alokananda Roy) took the makeshift stage ? the second-floor coffee shop spread at the bookstore ? for an animated reading of some chapters from the Ensler play. 

 Titled Her Stories, the project was conceived and directed by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee. 

 The well-knit pieces touched upon themes as varied as pubescent days and same-sex love, rape and giving birth, first crush and coming to terms with one?s sexuality. 

 Where this version of The Vagina Monologues differed from the others was the live music recital by Dwitipriya Lahiri, which punctuated the readings. She rendered songs from the Sixties and Seventies to give a feel of Women?s Liberation of the tumultuous times. 

 Going by the spontaneous response from the weekday crowd, had Mumbai-based theatre actress Mahabanoo Mody-Kotwal taken the pain to travel down to Calcutta with her production of The Vagina Monologues, it would have been worth the effort.

Anindita?s last words seemed to sum it all up: ?I 

began to feel proud. Began to love my vagina. And Bob lost himself there and I 

was there with him, in my vagina, and we were gone...?

Doc drama

 These days, he picks the kind of films he wants to do and does a real good job of it. But it is primarily the stage where Dr Mohan Agashe?s heart lies. 

 After an extended acting career, which has seen him working with everyone from Satyajit Ray to Subhash Ghai to Pamela Rooks (he plays one of the main protagonists in her latest Dance Like A Man), Agashe is all set to take the stage for a one-man act.

 ?It?s adapted from a book titled Behind The Mask written by a surgeon,? Agashe told Metro from Pune. ?It is a collection of medical case histories and the incidents and experiences surrounding those cases. We will do the play in two language versions ? English and Marathi. It is basically meant for an intimate audience, a maximum of 200 people. The whole idea is to communicate directly with the audience and make them a part of the play. We would love to come to Calcutta but those plans can happen once the play actually goes on stage.?

 The solo act is meant to highlight the patient-doctor relationship and has Agashe enacting the doctor. ?The stage is more like our medical profession ? either perform or perish,? the thespian signed off.

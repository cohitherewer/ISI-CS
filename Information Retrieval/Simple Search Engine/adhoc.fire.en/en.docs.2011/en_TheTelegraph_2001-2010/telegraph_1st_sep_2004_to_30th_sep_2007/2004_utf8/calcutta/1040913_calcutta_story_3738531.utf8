The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

Bidding adieu to monsoon in style

The magic and the muck are fast running out and it?s 

your final chance to make a splash. If you?ve been holding on to the umbrella 

for dear life all this while, it?s time to put the Raj Kapoors and Nargis? to 

shame by seizing the moment as soon as the skies open up. Go overboard, take a 

boat ride at Outram Ghat or at Nalban. Then end the wet date on a steamy note 

with piping hot samosas and slurpy jalebis washed down with endless 

rounds of cha, from the bhar, of course.

Riding the crib carriage

The romance of the rains goes flying out of the car 

window when you go bumpity, bumpity bump down potholed streets. With the city 

roads half-eaten by the rains (the other half, of course, has perished to pipes 

or flyovers) rave and rant all you want, the deafening thundershowers notwithstanding. 

If you have more drive than that, take the pain to file a public interest litigation. 

It just might go down one of the countless open drains dotting the pathways but 

at least you can say you made an effort. Just brace for that next bump and blame 

it on all and sundry ? Writers? and CMC, apathy and atrocity.

Catching those men on their machines

 You don?t see the ?rat? for a greater part of the 

film. But once he is there on his ultra-fast two-wheeler, there?s no stopping 

John Abraham. Vroom, vroom and he goes Dhoom. With a jism to flaunt 

and a look that?s more menacing than his real-life jodidar, John is arguably 

the best thing about the biggest Bollywood hit of 2004. No wonder the girls can?t 

do without a good gawk despite going silent when he?s being bashed up by Abhishek 

Bachchan or going green when he?s being mud-wrestled by Tata Young while the credits 

roll.

Matching the mood of changing times

With the grey of monsoon giving way to the mellow 

tones of autumn, it might be the time to get rid of a few old favourites ? from 

sweet somethings like handing over your first doll to your sis, niece, whoever 

to dumping that bullying boyfriend. If you just want to rock the boat gently, 

this is the time of the year to test those flirting skills, on the sly!

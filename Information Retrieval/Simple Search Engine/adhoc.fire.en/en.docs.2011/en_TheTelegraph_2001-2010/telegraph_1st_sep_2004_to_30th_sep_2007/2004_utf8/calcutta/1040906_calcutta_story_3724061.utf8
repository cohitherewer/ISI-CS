The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Picturesque duet

 Creativity finds its best expression when born of the artists spontaneous vision. Such is the impression that awaits the audience at the ongoing exhibition of paintings and sculptures by the duo Gour Das and Nitai Das. Visitors will also be mesmerised by the sheer volume and variety of works on display; in forms, colours, themes and styles that bespeak the artists abundant capacity to bear in their art the influence of their life, customs, culture and ethos. A particularly interesting facet of their work is how deftly the artists imbibe elements of folk tradition into paintings that are essentially modern in style and substance. Gour Das collection of surreal images and Nitai Das (whose mythology-inspired painting appears above) hazy and subtle wash paintings truly make this exhibition a must-see for art lovers of the city.

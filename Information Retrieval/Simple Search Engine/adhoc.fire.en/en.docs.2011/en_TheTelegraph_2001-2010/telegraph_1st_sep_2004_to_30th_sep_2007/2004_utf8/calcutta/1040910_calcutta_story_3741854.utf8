 Mean machines

 Esha in Dhoom: Creating a stir 

Dhoom (U/A) 

 With a wafer-thin plot, the movie emphasises the wonders of good packaging. If man and machine are not your cup of tea, go on a romp with Esha for excitement and Rimii as a revelation.

 Catch it at: 89 Cinemas: 1.20 pm, 4 pm, 6.40 pm, 9.20 pm; Menoka 12 noon, 3 pm, 6 pm, 9 pm; Hind 12 noon, 3 pm, 6 pm, 9 pm Success story The ticket sales have been as brisk as the pace of the movie. The weekend collections at 89 Cinemas have been more than 90 per cent with repeat audiences trooping in. Why? This swift and sleek movie has caught the fancy of the young audience. The hunks are hot, the babes are hotter and the machines hottest. 

 Bike babe

Torque (A)

 The story of a gang of bikers, this movie introduces Joseph Kahn who was suited for the fast-paced action flick. But where is the storyline? Too much action, too little substance.

 Catch it at: Inox (Forum) 10.50 am, 9 pm; City Centre 10.40 pm, 9 pm; 89 Cinemas 12.20 pm, 4.35 pm.

 Flop factor: The hall- owners blame the distributors for low-key publicity and the distributor blames it on a reluctant public. The first weekend collection at 89 Cinemas was 30 per cent.

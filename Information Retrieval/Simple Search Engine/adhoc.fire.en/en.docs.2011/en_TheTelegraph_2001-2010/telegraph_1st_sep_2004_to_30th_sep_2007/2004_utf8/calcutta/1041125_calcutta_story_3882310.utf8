Swing on, 70s style

Plan a Party

 Zeeshan Jawed digs out ideas for 

some retro revelry this winter

 Get hold of some retro clothes bell-bottoms, 

hip huggers, large prints and polkas 

 Pink Floyd and the Beatles are a must to rock the party

 Leave out older friends and parents, they 

can help with inputs to recreate the old magic

Party animals are not born. They are created. And 

no other time managed to give birth to as many as the 70s. This was when flower 

power gave way to groove, Woodstock gave way to disco. And in India, western music 

made its mark on Bollywood tunes. Rock ruled and R.D. Burman reigned supreme. 

?Those were really wild times. If I was not listening to music at home, I would 

be partying hard at a friend?s place or at a night club,? reminisces 45-year-old 

Joyanto Ghosh, party animal-turned-English teacher. 

It?s the time to disco

With New Year?s Eve just over a month away, it is 

time to get set for a theme bash to break through the clutter of mad partying. 

A 70s do is a great platform to involve parents and older friends as well, recreating 

some of the old magic and getting their inputs about how to put it all together. 

Wardrobe wonders

This is the best way to show off your trendiest clothes 

too. Retro has ruled the ramp of late, and the bright colours and styling of three 

decades ago fits right into the scheme of things. Or, if your parents love to 

hang on to evidence of their youth, rummage through your father?s or mother?s 

closet. Bright hues and big patterns dominated the racks, with all things psychedelic 

(think Austin Powers, dude) being in fashion. Bellbottoms, hip huggers, colourful 

patches, hot pants, T-shirts were all the rage. Knits and denims were the fabrics 

of choice. That leaves ample choice to look your hottest.

Rock rocks

Without a doubt, the 70s rocked. There is no end to 

the groovy song list that you can line up for such an evening. ?I warm up with 

Pink Floyd and the Beatles at such dos. Once everybody is in the groove, I switch 

over to hard rock. The Doors, Rolling Stones and Deep Purple were the bands that 

ruled,? feels DJ Girish of Shisha. But if rock is not high on your agenda, plan 

a disco dhamaka. Bonny M, Abba and Bob Marley are sure to turn everybody 

into a disco deewane. Going desi calls for heavy doses of Panchamda. 

The younger crowd will feel at home, with R.D. Burman?s remixes still the most 

happening foot-tappers at night clubs.

Cool add-ons

If the 70s were all about attitude, you have to make 

sure to get the accessories right. Thick-rimmed retro glasses, like the ones Preity 

Zinta wore in Kal Ho Naa Ho, could work well. Sideburns are a strict yes-yes. 

And while you are at it, grow your tresses a little. For footwear, girls can pull 

out platforms and guys can try to find a pair of shoes with a sizeable lift for 

themselves, too. If you can pull it off, try to get a cool bike to ride to the 

venue. Post Dhoom, an Enfield or a Harley would be just the thing to impress.

Filmi funda

If you are looking for inspiration, there is plenty 

to be had on screen, small and big. Watch That 70s? Show intently before 

you take the party plunge. You can also draw inspiration from the Hindi classic 

on the 70s culture ? Hare Rama Hare Krishna (check out stills from the 

film left and below). Or rent Saturday Night Fever to catch John Travolta 

ladling out the style. If you can get your paws on a projector, make the most 

of a blank wall to screen some precious moments from the past.

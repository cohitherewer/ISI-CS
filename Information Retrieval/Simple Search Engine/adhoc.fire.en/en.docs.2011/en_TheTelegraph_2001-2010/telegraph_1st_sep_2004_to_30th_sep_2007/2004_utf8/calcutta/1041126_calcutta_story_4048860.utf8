The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ahead, the one-stop car shop

 SUBHRO SAHA

 From Jaguar to General Motors, Chrysler to Scania ? the secret behind that glint is about to be revealed in town soon. 

 Those who love to keep their cars in mint condition the year round can use the same expertise that grooms showpiece automobiles the world over, come next month.

 Glix Group of Companies, which gave the city AV Designs, the ?first firm in eastern India to deal with car modifications?, is revving up to unveil a ?one-stop shop for all car needs? of Calcuttans. 

To be located on the EM Bypass next to ITC Sonar Bangla 

Sheraton amp; Towers, the novel showroom will bring under one roof everything 

to do with cars ? from buying-selling to insurance cover, modification to finance, 

with special stress on grooming.

 ?The city doesn?t have a comprehensive car treatment station and we are bringing in Waxoyl AG of Switzerland as franchisee to take care of the grooming part,? says Vinay Daga, business head, who along with brothers Anand and Abhishek, is behind the venture. While the Bypass showroom doesn?t open before March, grooming work commences at AV Designs? Taratala Road workshop in December.

 The exhaustive grooming facilities, in collaboration with the Swiss major, will offer ?professional bumper-to-bumper inner-outer-under automobile preservation? to fight the forces that attack cars. ?Rust in cavities and underbody on new and used vehicles, spills and stains on upholstery, oxidation, industrial pollutants, UV sunrays and acid rain, our treatment centre will be equipped to handle all automobile conditions and requirements,? says Abhishek.

 As weathering of each car is different, all treatment provided at the grooming station will be customised. Protective therapy to ensure longer life of the vehicle will be another USP of the one-stop shop, claim the Brothers Daga. 

 ?At the onset, the cars exterior is prepared, restored to its original condition and then a long-term protective treatment applied,? explains Anand.

 The special paint sealant vitrifies into ?a clear, glass-like armour? and bonds to the original finish to seal out harmful UV rays and atmospheric pollutants. Other protection packages include exterior plastics, vinyl and rubber dressing to preserve the brand-new look of the car and an invisible barrier to prolong fabric, leather and vinyl life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Small Talk

Poopers will be pop party picks this weekend considering 

its been pretty downhill the world over through the week. India played sports 

spoiler through and through and a favourite holiday destination is in turmoil. 

However depressing, youve got to know the news nuggets to hold your own through 

that weekend dinner.

Blue boo

Dada has been a dud so far with not a miracle in sight 

from his blue-eyed boys of Indian cricket. The Wednesday batting debacle at Trent 

Bridge is a good excuse to demand no Sachin, no game and revive the cry for 

no win, lesser fees. The more sporty ones can go into raptures about newcomer 

Alex Wharf or giant Steve Harmison. Also, keep your fingers crossed for an Indian 

turnaround and know a tennis elbow when you see one (a sprain caused by or as 

by playing tennis).

Olympics angst

Still with sport and still down in the dumps you 

better know your silver from your gold when babbling about the bungle that was 

Olympics 2004, for India. Feel proud for sharpshooter Rajyavardhan Singh Rat-hore 

but let it rip when it comes to the rest of the pathetic performers and the doping 

dodos. Your heart might bleed for the Lee-Hesh medal miss, but dont jump the 

gun and say you expected Anju Bobby George to leap to glory.

Iraq line

Its all happening in Iraq but the tremors are being 

felt closer home. If Wednesdays mahamichhil for peace in Iraq played traffic-stopper 

for a few hours in the city, riots rocked a holiday destination beyond the border. 

So, if you have major travel plans to Kathmandu, spend this weekend discussing 

it with those in the Nepal know.

Inside out

Finally, cast a veil on the doom and gloom and watch 

that wispy veil over inner and outer wear lift tantalisingly. Night wear is becoming 

the cynosure of nightlife, at home and hot spot. If you havent been able to catch 

any of those haute nightwear fashion shows in the city yet, take our word for 

it that they have been all the rage lately. While the boys slurp over the slinky 

show at Dublin to push up Friday night fever, girls can go one up by bragging 

about that imported bra and even flaunting a sexy strap or two.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Screen On amp; Off

 Lovely long blonde locks, a sweet smile, sexy eyes and a body to die for ? Tara Reid (picture below) sure is a sight for sore eyes. These attributes, as well as a sunny personality, took the child star in advertisements from strength to strength, as she switched from one nondescript television show to another. But then she did get noticed and powered by a healthy dose of ambition, Tara was soon on her star trek to Hollywood.

 American Pie was her first bite into an international spotlight, and this 28-year-old quickly latched on to bigger things. Catch her in the 2003 comedy My Boss?s Daughter, also starring the very funny (and yummy) Ashton Kutcher, on Star Movies on September 15, at 12.15 pm. Fans of the blonde hunk can also catch him tickling the funny bone on That 70s Show on Star World, Monday nights.

 There?s plenty more of Tara in the not-too-distant future, in horror flicks and more comedies. Knots, out this year in the US, takes a look at contemporary relationships from a male point of view. In the post-production stage is Alone in the Dark, also starring Christian Slater, where she plays his ex-girlfriend, a genius anthropologist (defying the blonde myth) as they battle evil.

 Tara also makes an appearance in the fourth in The Crow series (the original had met an ill-fated end with the death of Brandon Lee, son of Bruce Lee). Wicked Player also has David Boreanz, as the leader of a satanic biker gang, a role reversal from his demon-slayer Angel in the series of the same name, which is aired on Thursday nights on Star World.

Shah Rukh Khan: Selling point

 After the success of Main Hoon Na worldwide, the core creative team of the film is back in action. This time, though, it?s not a three-hour melodramatic saga but a slick minute-long advertisement. Shah Rukh Khan, Farah Khan and Anu Malik teamed up recently for the advertisement of the new Hyundai car GETZ to be produced by SRK?s production company Red Chillies Entertainment.

 While King Khan has now become a veteran selling products on the telly, it is a first for both Farah and Anu. In the recent past another film-maker, Rohan Sippy of Kuch Na Kaho fame, had directed an advertisement in Bangkok for Panasonic with Bipasha Basu.

 And now it?s Farah. ?It was good fun to work amongst friends again,? said the choreographer-director who is currently touring the country for the auditions of the Sony talent hunt show Indian Idol. 

 And why did Anu Malik, who has been composing music for films for the ?past 27 years?, decide to go the jingle way? ?Usually ads want something peppy, something really short. But here they were looking for something melodious. And I loved doing it. In fact, the advertisement in totality has come out really well. It should be on air in about a week.?

 So after the big screen blitzkrieg, it will be time for SRK and Co. to say on the small screen: Main hoon na?

Priyanka Chopra: No objection

When the music of Aitraaz releases on September 

24, it will record a couple of firsts. 

 Two big guns have joined firepower and the result is the world?s biggest arsenal under one musical umbrella. Sony Music, which has announced its global merger with the Bertlesmann Music Group (better known as BMG), has acquired the music rights of the film. And the worldwide release will be the first project after the global merger of the two. This is also the first time that Sony Music has taken the music rights of a Mukta Arts film, to be presented by showman Subhas Ghai. 

 Aitraaz is being billed as a ?social thriller?. The compromises that today?s aggressive atmosphere demands to fulfil one?s ambitions, and the consequences one has to face after achieving one?s dreams forms the core of the story. This film revolves around three central characters and their relationships. Raj Malhotra, who is an executive in a multinational company, his wife Priya, who has given up the practice of law after marriage, and Sonia Sharma, an aspiring model with vaulting ambitions. 

 Directed by the ace duo Abbas-Mustaan, the film stars Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra (picture above) and Amrish Puri. 

 If the merger has added muscle to the music house, it also adds to its repertory. ?We will be marketing a wider array of artistes,? said Shridhar Subramanium, managing director of Sony Music, over telephone from Mumbai. That means the likes of Britney Spears from today and Elvis Presley from yesterday. 

 It?s a repeat of World Cup 2003. We?re not talking about the prospect of Team India entering a really big tournament on a low and finally going out on a high, but the ?alternative coverage? that cricket purists are likely to tune into.

 For those tuned off by SET Max?s eye-candy coverage of the ICC Champions Trophy, ESPN STAR Sports might have the antidote. Like the World Cup last year, cricket pundits led by the Wasim Akrams and Harsha Bhogles are camping in England during the tournament, providing useful insights, ?serious analysis? and more while the matches are on air on SET Max.

 Apart from segments featuring experts during important ties, some of ESPN STAR Sports? cricket shows and specials will also be beamed from British soil. With the channels? tie-up with the out-of-action Sachin Tendulkar and in-form Sourav Ganguly, count exclusive comments from the duo among the added attractions.

 The overs on MAX, between the overs on ESPN STAR Sports? Take your pick.

 When it comes to Indiana Jones, the small screen 

experience seems to be replicating the big screen one. Just as fans have been 

made to wait longer for the fourth episode of the adventure series after producer 

George Lucas shelved the project (pushing it back by at least another year, according 

to reports), the chance to visit the three films anew has also suffered a setback. 

Zee MGM, which was supposed to screen the trilogy, has postponed the telecast 

dates. Raiders of the Lost Ark has been replaced with The Freshman 

on September 16 at 9 pm, Temple of Doom with Jury Duty on September 

23 while Lethal Vows will be shown in place of The Last Crusade 

on September 30.

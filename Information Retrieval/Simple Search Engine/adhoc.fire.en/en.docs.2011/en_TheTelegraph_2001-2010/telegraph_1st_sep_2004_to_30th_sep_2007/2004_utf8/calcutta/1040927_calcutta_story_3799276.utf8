The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You can?t get through this week without

Marauding Mauritius

Visa power is out. Now all a trip to Mauritius requires is a humble passport, 

a five-figure holiday budget and a pretty date. The no-Visa travel to the island 

country valid from October 1 sure warrants a change in your holiday plans. Grab 

the chance to go where the Bollywood stars holiday and honeymoon before, during 

and after work. With the government rolling out the red carpet and even laying 

out a luncheon table at The Park, Mauritius must be right up there on your Puja 

getaway plans. For once, being marooned would be voluntary!

Throwing a private party

If you are tired of the regular revelry at the jammed nightclubs and bored with 

the routine rhythm churned out by the guy behind the console, give the disc a 

miss the coming weekend. Call over a few friends and have a blast at home. Let 

the booze flow free and unleash total mayhem with the music. The idea is to pick 

and choose your party people, wear exactly what you want to, have fun without 

a care in the world and not bother about being leered at when you lose control.

 Going mad about Madhoshi

They sizzled in Jism. They fizzled in Aetbaar. Can the John-Bipasha 

duo be third time lucky in Tanveer Khan?s directorial debut Madhoshi? They 

do have Priyanshu as the kebab mein haddi, though. But it is John who gets 

to do all the up-close-and-private scenes with real-life love Bipasha. Priyanshu 

and Bipasha hardly get the chance to say ?amra Bangali? and go all amorous. 

To sulk over how it?s all a western (the one by the Arabian Sea, yaar) 

conspiracy to not let two Bengalis get their act together, first be singed by 

the John-Bips hot number Ishq hai gunaah to gunaah karke dekhiye? Words 

of wisdom, that!

Crossing a line

Staying with Bips, it could be a good time to do an Ajnabee. But don?t 

go the whole hog. Swapping dates with your best buddy might be a cool idea, provided 

you keep things friendly rather than fresh, share thoughts rather than thongs. 

The plan is to have some harmless fun, and hey, you might end up being best friends 

with your best friend?s partner!

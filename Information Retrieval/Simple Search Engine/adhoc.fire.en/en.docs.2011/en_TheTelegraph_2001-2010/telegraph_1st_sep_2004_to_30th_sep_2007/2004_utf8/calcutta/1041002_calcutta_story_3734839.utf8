 Postman knock: blue in, khaki out 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The next time the postman comes calling, don?t slam the door on him if you don?t catch a glimpse of khaki. For, the man with the mailbag is shedding the colour he has donned for the past 150 years, to go true blue.

 Ever since the postal department was set up by the East India Company in October 1854, it has grown into a lifeline for the country, with a network of 1,53,454 post offices. To commemorate its 150th anniversary, among many other plans, the department has stitched together a sartorial switchover.

 ?The postmen (or women) and the postmasters are the most visible faces of the department. So, on the completion of 150 years of service, the department will introduce a new dress code for the field staff and Group-D employees. The aim is to impart a corporate image,? said P.M. Pal, director of postal services, West Bengal.

 The men will wear full-sleeved light blue shirts and dark blue trousers,while the women?s uniform will comprise light blue saris and navy-blue blouses. The uniform will have the department?s logo embossed on it.

 The department has a few more surprises up its sleeve. ?We are even planning to enforce a rule that everybody in the department ? from the secretary to the Group-D employee ? will wear the uniform at least once a week. But the plan is yet to be approved,? said an official.

 The news of the uniform switchover has drawn both relief and frowns from the field staff. The relief stems from the belief that blue will be more effective than khaki in beating the summer heat. 

 The frowners, on the other hand, find the change meaningless. The superiors, they allege, are mum about their persistent demands for better pay-scales and improved service conditions. ?Unless our grievances are addressed, there is no point in giving us a new set of clothes,? said Pranab Bhattacharya, secretary of the National Federation of Postal Employees.

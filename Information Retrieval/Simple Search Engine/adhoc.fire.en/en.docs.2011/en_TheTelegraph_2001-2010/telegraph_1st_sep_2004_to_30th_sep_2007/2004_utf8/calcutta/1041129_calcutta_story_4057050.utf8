Colour code

 Ekru, in theory, means the colour of unbleached fabric, material that is raw, ready to take on any dye. Set up in September 2000, the Rowland Row store has carved a niche for itself with wearable, yet unique, designs.

The name itself symbolises the joint efforts of sisters-in-law 

Ekta Jaipuria and Ruchira Kandhari. While Jaipuria completed her fashion studies 

from Saubhagya Academy, Nagpur, Kandhari did the same from the National Institute 

of Fashion Technology, Calcutta. Ekru is their platform to bring to the city a 

versatile range of Indo-western and western wear, from flowing skirts to bridal 

ensembles. (Pictures by Rashbehari Das)

 Ethnic Retake

 The boutique draws its inspiration from the traditional crafts of India and specialises in intricate forms of embroidery and patterns. Hence, fusion wear figures prominently on their agenda.

 The ethnic line is very extensive and comprises a wide range of salwar suits or kurtis, very Indian with Kutch embroidery patches and prints with Mughal art emblems. There are plenty of surface embellishments such as gota, thread work and mirror work, hand-painted motifs, block and khari prints. 

 Each of these have been created in vibrant colours with a touch of gold. Special emphasis has been laid on asymmetrical cuts and layered drapes, and churi pants and crushed kurtas give a stylish retro look. 

 ?Young girls who want to wear salwar suits on formal occasions and yet want to look trendy can find several things to suit their taste here. Everything has a contemporary feel to it,? says Kandhari.

 The Indo-western range re-interprets traditional styles and combines clean cuts with flowing silhouettes. A wide variety of linen knee-length kurtas with waist-high slits, georgette kantha shirts with silk panels, long crushed skirts with ethnic prints and coins as embellishments in a number of colours can be found here. ?The skirts are fun and can be teamed with anything ranging from a T-shirt to a heavily-embroidered silk shirt,? she adds.

 Ethnic lines from pret designers like Niki Mahajan, Sonali Mansingka, Priya Awasty and the label You can also be found here.

 Perfect Match

 Accessories like bags, sequinned shoes and some glitzy gems are another star attraction. Once more, imports from tradition are evident in exotic evening bags and jholas embellished with colourful sequins and beads. Glass work and embroidery have also been worked into the silk and linen bags.

 Sequinned and beaded jutis in a variety of colours, to mix and match with any ensemble, can be found here. 

 The jewellery section boasts some striking sterling silver items embellished with colourful gems like coral and turquoise, to go with conservative or trendy outfits.

Season Sales

 Ekru unveils new collections as per the season. While a profusion of summery and citrus shades with floral motifs ruled the summer months, Rajasthani prints marked the Diwali market.

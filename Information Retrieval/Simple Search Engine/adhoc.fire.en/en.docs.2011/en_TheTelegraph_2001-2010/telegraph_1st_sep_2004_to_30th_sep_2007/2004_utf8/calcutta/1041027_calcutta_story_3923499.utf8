 Art miscellaneous

 Art has the power to bring forth hidden depths of human emotions and sensibilities to arouse passions hitherto not felt, liberating the spirit from the festers and constraints of a materialistic life. Barisha Silpara Art Society?s ongoing exhibition of paintings, sculptures, graphics and drawings presents an assortment of works by a group of prominent and promising artists, whose works by virtue of their creative genius, offer an insight into the modern human psyche. Featuring works by Premangshu Mitra (one of his paintings appears alongside), Tapan Kumar Biswas, Partha Chakraborty, Sharmistha Acharjee, Abdul Salam, Amar Sarkar and others, the show is bound to captivate the imagination of art lovers simply by its sheer range, variety and amalgamation of colours. While sculptures in wood and bronze underline the fine, sophisticated craftsmanship of the sculptors, paintings and illustrations in media as diverse as oil, acrylic, chalk, linocut and pen and ink reveal the absolute mastery of the artists over their chosen medium.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings, sculptures, graphics and drawings

 When: Till November 1 (except today), 3 pm - 8 pm

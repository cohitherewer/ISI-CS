Till we meet again

Nelanjana Bhowmick

Losing a pet is painful. And coping with the loss 

 unimaginable. Its the loss of an integral part of you.

In the past five years of animal welfare work, I have 

had to see death from very close quarters. Some dogs had to be put down, others 

didnt survive accidents. Early this week, I lost Dushtu, a stray dog I had loved 

dearly. So, todays column is dedicated to the souls of our dear departed animals.

Bahnisikha Chatterjee lost 14-year-old Princy (Spitz) 

last year after a long battle against cancer. Her fondest memory of Princy every 

Thursday after Lakshmi puja he would wait patiently outside the puja room to get 

the first portion of the prasad.

Aparna Jaywants five-year old Mow, unlike other cats, 

loved going for drives, sprawled on the back seat of the car. Another one of Mows 

favourite pastime was pawing moving images on TV.

Kamalini Mazumdar got Chhutki home when she was a 

month old. At the tender age of two, Chhutki passed away allegedly because of 

the vets negligence. Kamalini remembers her first time away from Chhutki: For 

two days, Chhutki did not allow the main door of the house to be shut because 

she was expecting me to walk in anytime.

I believe, we all love our pets beyond death. While 

they are with us, we must make every moment happy and fulfilling so that we can 

look back and say: You are the best thing that happened to me. Till we meet again. 

Adios, pal.

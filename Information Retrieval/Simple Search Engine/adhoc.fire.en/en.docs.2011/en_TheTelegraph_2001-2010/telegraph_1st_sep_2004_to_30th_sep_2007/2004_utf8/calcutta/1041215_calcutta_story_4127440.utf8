 For years, feathered friends from afar have made Santragachhi jheel their home at this time of the year. This winter, they are conspicuous by their low turnout. The West Bengal Pollution Control Board believes the dirty water of the lake is keeping them away. 

 The board has recently received a number of complaints from residents and clubs of Santragachhi about the sorry state of the lake. On investigation, the complaints were found to be justified. It has been pointed out in the complaints that only a handful of migratory birds have come to the lake this winter, though they could be seen in large numbers in the previous years.

 The board has called Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC), Bally Municipality and South Eastern Railway (SER) for a meeting to discuss ways to clean up the dirty water. 

 ?We will work hard to find out ways and means to protect the lake from pollution. We have information that a number of shops have come up around the lake. Not only are the shop-owners dumping plastic bags in the lake, but some local residents have also started discharging dirty water into the lake from their drains. We will seek help from the SER and HMC to protect the lake when we meet on December 24,? said Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the board.

 Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee, however, denied that dirty water was being discharged into the lake. ?Since we have our own treatment plant, there is no need to discharge drainwater into the lake. Still, we are ready to cooperate with the board to protect the lake, for the sake of the birds,? he said.

 Chairman of Bally municipality Krishna Chandra Hazra said: ?Though we have no direct link with Santragachhi Lake, we are ready to attend the clean-up meeting.?

 An SER official said the lake was situated on railway land. ?We clean the lake every year, as we know that a large number of migratory birds flock here in winter. But we can?t prevent local residents from discharging dirty water into the lake,? he added.

 The official said a high-level meeting among the district police, forest and environment departments and the railway will be held on Wednesday to find ways to prevent the discharge of drain water into the lake.

 ?We used to allow fishing on the spot a couple of years ago. But we have stopped giving angling permits after the lake was declared a sanctuary,? he clarified.

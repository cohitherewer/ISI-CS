The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Star goes One up

It?s not an upmarket version of STAR Plus. Instead, 

the latest offering from the STAR stable takes off from where it?s most-watched 

channels ends. ?There are a lot of people who do not watch television simply because 

they don?t find the kind of content they are looking for,? Peter Mukerjea (picture 

below), CEO of STAR India.

 STAR One, targeted at the urban and upwardly mobile, aims to fill that gap and be ?everything STAR Plus isn?t?. ?We?re looking at the younger end of the family spectrum, the 25-35 age group,? explained Mukerjea at the launch on Tuesday. The channel will be formally on air from November 1.

Kicking off with 21 new shows, the programming mix 

has a fair share of action, comedy, drama and game shows. Primetime introduces 

viewers to new faces in Remix (friendship, rivalry and ambition among a 

group of teens) and some old ones like Ratna Pathak and Satish Shah in the comedy 

Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai. ?Battles of courtroom and conscience? feature in 

Siddhanth, while Family Business takes a look at the underworld. 

The highlight of the game shows includes the Shekhar Suman-hosted He Man, 

where the winner from among 10 men is chosen by ladies on the show. The search 

for love on a luxury liner plays out on Pyar Ki Kashti (picture above).

 Break from tradition comes in many ways for One, which was conceptualised last November. None of the programmes will run for more than one year. ?If we get very good ratings for a particular programme, we may bring it back for a second season,? said Dipak Saigal, head of content for the channel. There won?t be common programmes with any of STAR?s other Hindi channels either, including Plus, Gold and Utsav.

 Nothing also from the Ektaa Kapoor stable immediately. ?However, we are planning two shows with her in the second season,? added Saigal.

 STAR doesn?t feel launching One as a pay channel from the beginning, at Rs 10 per subscriber, will be a problem either. ?I think it?s reasonably priced,? feels Mukerjea. ?It?s also a step towards the realisation that you can?t be cheap and cheerful. Good content will have its price and we believe in our product.?

 But how risky was it to launch a niche channel at a time when mainstream channels are finding it hard to get a place on prime band? ?Though we are pushing the boundaries, I would not term One a niche channel,? offers Mukerjea. ?Any business proposition is risky, but we are trying to mitigate that risk with good programming.?

 A lot of emphasis has been put on the music, colour, graphics and casting. Title tracks have been recorded by the likes of Alka Yagnik, Abhijeet, Kumar Sanu and Usha Uthup and best production houses employed for the shows.

 Mukerjea expects the channel to break even in two years. ?One will also help us attract those advertisers who are not on our other Hindi channels because their profiles don?t match,? he added.

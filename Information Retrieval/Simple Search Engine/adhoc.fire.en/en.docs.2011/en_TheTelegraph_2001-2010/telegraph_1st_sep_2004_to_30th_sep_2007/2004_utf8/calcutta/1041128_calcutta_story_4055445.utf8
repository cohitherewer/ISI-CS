They might share on-pitch honours as teams to be reckoned with in the cricketing world, but there is little doubt about who is the off-field winner.

 The fresh new faces and old hands of the South African squad could all teach the Indians a lesson or two about how to play when not at play.

 First at the Videocon bash on the Terrace Gardens at Taj Bengal on Thursday night and then at the Castle Lager bash at The Park banquets on Friday evening, the Proteas were partying real hard.

Talking shop

 Thursday was the more formal of the two events with cricket being discussed above all else. John Wright and Sunil Gavaskar did veer towards golf for a change of pace, but only just.

 Sachin Tendulkar and Shaun Pollock discussed past encounters at some length, with South African skipper Graeme Smith joining in. Pacers Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan faced the Mongolian music as they sampled the country?s fiery cuisine.

 Team India captain Sourav Ganguly and his deputy Rahul Dravid made early exits even before the party had started to warm up.

 Harbhajan Singh, who?s quite a hit with the South Africans, discussed a turn trick or two with Makhaya Ntini and company. ?Bhajji, are you taking my boys for a ride?? asked a sceptical Pollock.

Model men

 Smith was also taking a tip or two from Sachin on going shopping in the city, with model girlfriend Minky desperate to take home some ethnic goodies.

 Minky ? who goes by the name Slinky Minky back home, largely because of her stint as a swimsuit model ?and Smith were declared the sexiest couple in the country, an answer to Britain?s Becks and Posh.

 Another face making the flashbulbs go wild was Cindy Nell, Jacques Kallis? girlfriend, a former Miss South Africa and a second runner-up at Miss Universe 2003.

 Even with a beauty queen on his arm, the formidable all-rounder admitted to having a soft spot for desi damsels.

 ?I find Indian women so beautiful. I have seen a lot of them on television and here on this trip of ours... The country has produced so many Miss Worlds and Miss Universes in recent years. What more can I say?? smiled Kallis.

 But the most bindaas of the lot must have been Pollock, Polly to his mates. Even as the rest of the squad had a blast on the floor, the tall opening bowler was busy behind the drums, trying to match beats with the DJ?s mix.

 ?We would have loved to have more fun but we?ve got a very strict schedule thanks to our coach and we have to make do with the little time we get off,? shrugged Pollock.

Turn it on

 Guess who is the ultimate woman?s man and the craziest party animal of the South African team? The man on the fastest track, Makhaya Ntini.

 While Thursday night forced the big man to be content with a steaming cup of tea, Friday was a different ball game altogether.

 With Channel [V] VJ Sarah Jane for company, Ntini showed that he alone could keep the floor scorching. Grooving to everything from Superstar to Turn me on, Ntini made all the right moves, even as Coyote Ugly-style girls tried to keep the bartop sizzling.

 Fierce competitors they may be but they do believe in a good game, too. And so, the return of the hometown hero was eagerly awaited. ?We had been hoping that Sourav Ganguly?s ban would be lifted,? was the common consensus.

Mellow mornings

 The days have been more mellow than the nights, but both the green and blue teams have been fairly easy to spot at the Taj Bengal, where they are all staying.

 l the cricketers have been heading to The Hub for a Continental breakfast. That has been the preferred lunch and dinner destination for the away team as well, playing it safe with pastas and pizzas. 

 The Indian stars have been a little more venturesome, trying out Sonargaon and Chinoiserie at times. Dravid and his wife, in fact, had a relaxed Indian dinner at the poolside barbecue on Friday.

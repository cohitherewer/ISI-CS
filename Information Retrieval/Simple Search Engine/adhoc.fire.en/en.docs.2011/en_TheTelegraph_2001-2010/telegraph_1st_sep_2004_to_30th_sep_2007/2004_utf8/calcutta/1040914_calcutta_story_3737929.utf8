The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Break for bread, farewell amp; welcome at five star

ZEESHAN JAWED, HIMIKA CHAUDHURI

Hyatt 

Regency will soon see a change of guard. General manager Praveen Chawla is heading 

to Delhi to take over as vice-president, marketing, at Asian Hotels, Hyatt?s Indian 

partner. Timothy Bruce is taking over as chief of the Calcutta property.

 The official farewell ? and welcome ? took place at the hotel last Friday night. Bruce, a hospitality industry veteran, comes to town after a five-year stint in Canberra, in charge of a Hyatt hotel there. With 30 years? experience across the world ? including Japan, Abu Dhabi, Malaysia and Belgium ? the UK-born naturalised Australian is set to take charge on September 15, after just a week in the city.

 While Bruce wishes to build on the foundation created over the past two years by his predecessor, the next couple of months are likely to see some changes at the Salt Lake premises. ?The most important change will probably be the start of the new Italian restaurant,? explains Bruce, who has worked with the Hilton group as well. By November, the speciality eatery should be up and dishing out authentic food from Italy. Calcutta got a preview of it, with live counters at the bash serving delicacies like Truffle Risotto with Porcini Mushrooms and Tuna Carpaccio.

 There had been apprehension, when Hyatt opened two years ago, about whether there was enough demand to justify more five-star rooms in the city. ITC Sonar Bangla was also set to open soon after. But the new manager is optimistic about the potential of the industry here. ?If you look at the growth in the market, it is encouraging. Royal Jordanian is now flying out of the city, and the increasing number of domestic flights is an indicator of growth as well,? he says.

 The lavish party played host to the city?s business and diplomatic communities. Apart from the Italian options, chefs catered to every gastronomic whim and fancy, by way of Swiss, Indian, Mexican and Asian live counters. Amongst the interesting choices was a counter serving Raclette, a Swiss cheese. A heating instrument slowly melts the cheese wheel. The creamy top layer is scraped off and served with bread or potatoes. The pungent cheese is surprisingly light on the tongue.

 The air of the ballroom was also heavy with smoke from Dom Diego cigars. The Dominican brand has been selling through the hotel for a few months now. They were liberally circulated at the bash.

 Kashmir call

 A trip to Kashmir may not be your idea of a stress-free holiday, but that doesn?t mean you have to miss out on a taste of its wondrous wealth.

 Pakwan, a city restaurant, claims to be offering authentic Kashmiri cuisine as part of an ongoing food promotion. Aab Gosh (mutton cooked in milk) or the fiery red Rishta (small mutton balls of finely pounded meat in spicy curry) and Palak Gadh (fish cooked in spinach) are a few of the dishes that can be sampled. 

 ?The Calcutta foodie has not yet been exposed to the cuisine much, so we thought of bringing the flavours of Kashmir to town,? said Soma Sharma of Pakwan.

 The menu, put together by Ishtaq Mir ? the vasta waaza (master chef) ? doesn?t quite boast of as many items as a traditional Kashmiri meal might (which often comprises as many as 36 courses). 

 But it does have enough options for starters, main course and dessert, to be washed down with a cup of kahwa or tea.

 Seekh kebabs, Khush Kukkur (dry chicken), Tabah Maaz (ribs cooked in gravy) or Chhanan Ruwagan (paneer cooked in tomato gravy) and Kashmiri Pulao are some dishes that deserve mention.

 There is a strong emphasis on the use of meat but improvisations have been necessary to placate local palates. ?Kashmiris are fond of mutton, but we have also included fish, chicken and some paneer to play it safe,? explained the chef. Most dishes are priced between Rs 50 and Rs 95.

Fresher bash

 Rain-soaked Saturday evening saw the Meghalaya Students? Association, Calcutta, throwing a freshers? bash at Meghalaya House for the new batch in town for higher studies from the hilly state.

 The welcome for 125 students also doubled as a congregation for the 400-odd community members in Calcutta.

 After a few words of encouragement from Meghalaya urban development minister Friday Lyngdoh, the evening started with a fashion show, where the pretty young things from the state displayed their prowess on the ramp. The men did their bit with a small concert, playing Bob Dylan and Elvis Presley covers, giving the crowd a chance to hit the floor.

 The congregation concluded with a dinner spread of traditional food from the region. Jadoh was one of the more exotic choices, made from rice cooked in chicken blood. Nakham, on the other hand, is a fried dish of pig head cut into small pieces.

 By the kids

 Trust kids to turn every place they visit into a party zone. On Sunday it was the turn of Oxford Bookstore, venue for A Forest Party. The play was performed by students of The Creative Arts, an informal theatre group.

 ?The play has been conceptualised by the kids themselves. They thought up the story and decided which characters each one of them will enact,? explained director Ramanjit Kaur. The play was written originally in 2002 but Sangeeta Bapuli revived the script for the performance at the Park Street store. 

 ?We hold various workshops from time to time with the aim of helping the students unleash their talent and inculcate independent thinking and creative abilities,? added Ramanjit. The group was formed three years ago, incorporating methods from drama, dance, music and the visual arts.

 The scene of action was the birthday party of Mowgli and Gowgli, upset because nobody turned up for their party. A series of hilarious events follow and the two friends are soon happy once more. 

 The play included a motley crew of characters ? jungle animals and birds to a DJ and a music band. It also featured children and adults working together, which, feels the director, is the USP of The Creative Arts.

 Ethnic chic

 Designer kurtas don?t necessarily come with a five-figure price tag. Ethnic chic now comes cheaper with a new range of Indian wear for men from Darshika, one of the few boutiques in Calcutta catering to this segment.

 Designed by the husband-wife duo of Rajesh and Shagun Agarwal, the kurtachuridar sets are embellished with detailing comprising zardosi, kantha work, kasab work, beads and stone work.

 The cuts are contemporary and the colours bright. Orange, electric blue and bright yellow are a few of the funky shades in vogue. Fabrics are chosen to lend a free flow to the garments. Cotton, silk, dupion and georgette are used to conjure up an elegant look at this Dover Lane address.

 Prices range between Rs 750 and Rs 3,500 for the regular variety but climbs a little higher in the trousseau section. A yellow georgette piece with heavy zari embellishment is the kind of gear a bridegroom can expect here. Dressy long jackets, to be thrown over a kurta, are also worth a look.

 Mother?s eyes in Ray film

 We are a multi-cultural family, with my father hailing from the North and my mother from Bengal. And so we celebrate all the festivals on the calendar ? from Holi to Diwali, Durga puja to Id ?in our own small way. Apart from these, I celebrate Raksha Bandhan by tying a small rakhi on the wrist of my brother (Saif Ali Khan).

 When my family is in Delhi, we usually visit some of our older friends who organise Durga pujas, but then, again, it?s more of a community affair. And my mother (Sharmila Tagore) makes some regional specialities, may be mithais, that we just love to gorge on.

 This Puja, I am in Mumbai and have some time in hand, having wrapped up the last day?s shooting of Anant Mahadevan?s Dil Maange More, in which I am cast opposite Shahid Kapur. There are some days to go before I start work on Rajshree Ojha?s English feature film Yatna. So, I will be going to Lokhandvala, where there?s a big puja on and offer anjali too.

 Apart from our homely celebrations, some films conjure up the images of Durga puja in a more subtle way. I have seen Devi, one of my mother?s first films directed by Satyajit Ray, where she plays the goddess. I remember her kohl-lined eyes and the expression on her face, something that has left a lasting impression.

 In fact, Bengal has so much film-making talent to offer and I myself have had the chance to work with some amazing scripts, directors and cinematographers like Rituparno (Ghosh), Aveek (Mukherjee) and Anjanda (Das) who understand the medium so well. I am motivated by films like these, which are made with a lot of passion.

 In Antarmahal (directed by Rituparno Ghosh), I don?t have anything to do in the scenes involving Durga puja. So there isn?t anything I could gather in terms of knowing something about the rituals. 

 I play a young oppressed housewife of Jackie Shroff, one who doesn?t have any freedom of choice. My character is very timid and is not at all like Durga. But I have been told that there is some resemblance between the goddess and my face, and so my eyes were highlighted?

 While working for Antarmahal, I stayed in Calcutta for around three weeks. My grandparents live here but I have no memories of ever spending any puja in this city. I will be breezing through town in November, too, for some post-production work. But I would love to be there during the festival? Calcutta must be really coming alive then.

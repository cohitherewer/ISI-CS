The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pitch for Delhi aid

 - Centre looks east, calcutta shines

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With the United Progressive Alliance looking eastward, Calcutta is tipped to get a makeover. 

 ?Calcutta will soon be the gateway to Asia if the Centre continues with its policy of looking towards the East,? urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Monday. 

 Making the most of its strength in Parliament, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is drawing up a Rs 1,000-crore project for improving road conditions, introducing drinking water schemes and augmenting the drainage system and other city infrastructure.

 ?We?ve asked the parliamentary standing committee on urban development to take special note of Calcutta when it comes to infrastructure development. Md Salim, who is the standing committee chairman, has been assigned the task of inviting to the city Union minister for urban development Ghulam Nabi Azad and urban employment and poverty alleviation minister Kumari Shailja,? Bhattacharya said. 

 The state will hold a convention for the two Union ministers, where they will be shown the areas where Central assistance is required.

 In a 90-minute slide show on Monday, the standing committee members from Bengal, Prasanta Chatterjee, Md Salim and Sudhanshu Sil, were briefed about the areas where Central assistance is urgently awaited. 

 These include demands for a policy change on some issues. The state is opposing the Centre?s bid to merge the Megacity and Metrocity projects, under which assistance is provided to urban towns. Bengal gets Rs 46 crore every year under the Megacity project, but this year it has received only Rs 15 crore so far. 

 The other demands include:

 A sanctioned 

amount for Rs 1.30 crore, comprising 40 per cent of the cost for preparation of 

a detailed project report on the East-West Metro Corridor project; 

 Execution 

of the loan agreement in the Italian-aided project for management of water supply 

and solid waste in 14 local bodies; 

 Early 

clearance for a pilot project in Bidhannagar Municipality for a feasibility study 

on public-private partnership of water supply and solid waste management with 

French aid.

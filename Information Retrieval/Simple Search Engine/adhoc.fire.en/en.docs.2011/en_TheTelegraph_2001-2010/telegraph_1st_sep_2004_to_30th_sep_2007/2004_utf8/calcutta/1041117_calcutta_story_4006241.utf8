Aqua effect for career call

Feng Shui Matters

Name of author

 According to Feng Shui, a waterbody in the 

northern sector of a house enhances the career prospects of its residents. It 

is advisable to have a small fountain in the north of the living room and switch 

it on three to four times a day. It is also important to add fresh water regularly 

to prevent stagnant water from circulating 

water power

Q: We have a small bathroom in the north 

of the house. It doesn?t have windows or any other kind of ventilation. We have 

heard that it is advisable to have a small tap there and let it drip all the time 

to enhance business. We have done this, but instead of matters improving, it is 

showing a downward trend. Is there anything wrong with this arrangement?

Drishti Seth

The Solution: A water body in the north side 

of the house is very powerful in enhancing the career luck of its residents. However, 

any kind of leakage in the taps, whether in the kitchen or the bathroom, is bad. 

An arrangement where the water drips continuously is a sure sign of depleting 

finances. Alternatively, you can have a small water fountain in the north of the 

living room. Add half a glass of fresh water every day to prevent stagnant water 

from circulating. Switch it on three to four times for half an hour everyday. 

Having a toilet in the north side of the house drains away career opportunities. 

Place a full-length mirror on the outside of the washroom door, making it apparently 

disappear from the house. Next, place a full-length mirror on any one wall so 

it reflects pictures of nature from the opposite wall.

Q: The wall opposite our bed has a huge 

cabinet that contains gadgets like television, a music system and a computer. 

In my daughter?s room all the electronic goods are on the same wall as her bed?s 

headboard. She also has an electric alarm clock on the bedside table. I have been 

told that it is bad for a person?s health to be surrounded by so many electronic 

items while sleeping. Please advise.

Sheetal Arora

The Solution: It?s not advisable to sleep in 

a room that has such a strong electromagnetic field created by appliances. At 

night, the body goes through a natural healing process and these electronic goods 

disturb the aura around the body. Electricity keeps flowing through the wiring 

of appliances even when they are switched off. So, it is best to cultivate the 

habit of unplugging everything in the bedroom before you go to sleep. You can 

also hang a soft curtain at night to cover the cabinet that houses the electronic 

appliances. Try to remove the gadgets that are too close to your daughter?s headboard 

and replace the electronic clock with one that runs on batteries.

Q: Very soon we are shifting to Bangalore 

permanently to set up our new business. Our son will take over the existing business 

in Calcutta. We are thinking of giving our present master bedroom to our son who 

is getting married shortly. Is this okay according to Feng Shui?

The Solution: It is not considered auspicious 

for parents to vacate their master bedroom and give it to their children. It is 

symbolic of uprooting themselves from the present position. Chose another room 

for him. In case you don?t have an option, it?s best to place your photos in the 

south-west of the room to stabilise your personal energy. Invite fresh energy 

with a new coat of paint, furnishings, upholstery and accessories. You must buy 

them a new mattress. 

Q: What is the significance of a horseshoe 

and Laughing Buddha in Feng Shui? Is it possible to enhance one?s luck by keeping 

them in the house? Also, what are the best directions to place them?

Raghav

The Solution: Horseshoes are considered very 

lucky in Feng Shui. They can be placed at the top of the entrance to a house. 

Care should be taken to see that the open ends of the horseshoe point upwards 

and not downwards. When placed with the open ends upward, it is believed to collect 

wealth and fortune while luck runs out if placed with the open ends downward. 

The Laughing Buddha is best placed facing the entrance of the house to welcome 

visitors and prosperity.

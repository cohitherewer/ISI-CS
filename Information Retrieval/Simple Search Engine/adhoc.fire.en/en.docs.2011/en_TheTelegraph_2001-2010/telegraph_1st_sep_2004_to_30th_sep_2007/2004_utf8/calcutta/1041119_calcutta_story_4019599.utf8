 Green carrot for builders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has decided to reward builders who conform to energy and environmental rules. 

 ?Builders who abide by energy and environmental norms will get incentives,? state housing development minister Goutam Deb said on Thursday, while inaugurating a national seminar on global trends in building services engineering.

 The government has formulated a set of guidelines for construction of buildings at New Town, in Rajarhat. According to officials of Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), those who follow the guidelines will get a discount on the development fee during sanction of building plans. 

 ?We have planned other incentives too,? an official said.

 The guidelines, touted as the first of their kind in the country, aim to make the buildings ?energy-efficient? and ?eco-friendly?. They have been formulated by Hidco, the nodal development agency for New Town, with assistance from the state-owned West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (Webreda), Tata Energy Research Institute and some academic institutions. 

 ?A typical home in New Town will utilise the available sunlight to the maximum extent. Traditional design techniques will be used, keeping in mind the climate and adopting solar-passive architecture,? a Hidco official said. 

 Webreda director S.P. Gan Chaudhuri said; ?Energy-efficient structures will cost around five per cent more than ordinary structures. But the government will give a 20 per cent rebate on the development fee. quot; 

 By the guidelines, a building should have a ?solid wall? on the west and the staircase, kitchen and toilet should be in the west and the east, so that ?the living part? of the building gets ?less sun?. Other recommendations include wall and roof insulation and use of double-glass windows.

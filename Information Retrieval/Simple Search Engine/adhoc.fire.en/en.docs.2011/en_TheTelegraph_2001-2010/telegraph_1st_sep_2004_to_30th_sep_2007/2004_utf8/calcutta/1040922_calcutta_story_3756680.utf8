Model maker mantra

STRIKE A POSE

Fashion promoter Prasad Bidapa lists 

the dos and donts for those who want to be in the business of model coordination

 Model 

coordination is now gaining prominence as a business option and it is the need 

of the hour to have honest coordinators. Many of the existing ones, particularly 

in Mumbai and Bangalore, have become very greedy and they are cheating the models 

very badly. In fact, I know of coordinators who take a cut of as much as 85 per 

cent of a model?s earning. This is really sad. The industry needs a crop of honest 

and efficient model agents.

 To make 

it big as a coordinator, you should have an eye for the trends of the future. 

The ability to look at an ordinary girl and judge her potential as a model is 

not an easy job. You have to have a feel of fashion, know what?s happening in 

the industry, what kind of look is in for a model and then you will realise what 

to watch out for.

 When 

you are forming your group of models, keep your eyes open always and try spotting 

fresh talent ? in the gym, on the streets, at restaurants ? just about everywhere. 

And if someone looks striking, be bold enough to go up and ask the person whether 

he or she would be interested in modelling.

 The most 

important thing is to be honest and responsible. When you are handling a person?s 

career, you have to be both. You have to make sure a model is not cheated or ill-treated 

by a client, that he or she is getting good rates. 

Also, you must have a very good head for business, 

your books of accounts must be clean. The industry norm is to take a cut of 15 

to 20 per cent of a model?s pay from an ad campaign and it is desirable that you 

abide by this. In this profession, a lot depends on your trustworthiness and reputation 

and it is easy to lose your name. And if that happens, no model will trust you.

You need to have very good public relations skills, because this profession is 

all about striking good deals. Keep a good rapport with designers, photographers, 

make-up artistes, choreographers, advertising agencies and all other professionals 

related to the industry. 

A coordinator must understand the requirement of the clients very well. If you 

are selecting a model for endorsing a jeans brand, you have to focus on the body 

type, whereas for a cosmetics company, the skin quality is important. All this 

has to be kept in mind. 

It helps a lot if a coordinator is multi-talented. He should have a sense of styling 

and know a bit about make-up, so he can do those jobs in an emergency. 

Lastly, I would like to say it is not a very glamorous profession. You will not 

be a part of the action after you have made the deal between the model and the 

client. But it is turning out to be a lucrative job now, especially for girls, 

since I feel women make better coordinators than men.

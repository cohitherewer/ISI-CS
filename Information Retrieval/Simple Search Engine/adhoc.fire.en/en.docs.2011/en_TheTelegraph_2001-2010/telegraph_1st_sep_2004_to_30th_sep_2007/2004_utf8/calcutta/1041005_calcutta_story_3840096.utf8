 Rolling out red carpets for the private sector or chanting the marketing mantra, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee never misses an opportunity to point out the changing stance of the Left government. 

 Speaking at the valedictory session of Food Tech India 2004 ? jointly organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), department of food processing and horticulture and Intech India ? Bhattacharjee on Monday elaborated on his new-found love: market mechanism and public-private partnership. 

 ?West Bengal has immense potential in the field of agriculture and food processing. But we do not have the proper market mechanism. From the government?s end, we are trying to create the necessary infrastructure and we want the private sector to come and join hands with us,? said the chief minister, bringing down the curtains on the four-day show on the Maidan. 

 Sailen Sarkar, minister for food processing and horticulture, was present. 

 ?We are very happy with the response to the fair. Seminars, business sessions and the one-to-one meetings have been of immense benefit to the exhibitors,? said Anup Singh, president, ICC. 

 Over 125 exhibitors, including food processing units, machinery suppliers and traders, from various parts of the country took part in the food fair, organised for the fifth time in the city. 

 ?The recent trends in the food processing industry are very encouraging. From just Rs 154 crore in 2001-02, the annual investment in the industry grew to Rs 327 crore last year. But there is a long way to go and we have to set up a proper market mechanism,? stressed Bhattacharjee.

 He said the state government was in talks with the Centre to lay down infrastructure, like cold chains, warehouses and dedicated agri-export zones. 

 Bhattacharjee added that the government was committed to creating research and development facilities ? at Kalyani and North Bengal universities ? to speed up growth of the industry.

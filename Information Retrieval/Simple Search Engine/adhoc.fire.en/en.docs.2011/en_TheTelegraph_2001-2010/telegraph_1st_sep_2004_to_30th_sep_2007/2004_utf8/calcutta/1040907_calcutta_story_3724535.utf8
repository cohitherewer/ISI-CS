 Party-poop shadow on missing girl 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A waiter at the hotel in Chandipur where Susmita Dhar was last seen nearly a decade ago has told the CID that the 22-year-old student of Jadavpur University may have objected to the conduct of some of her friends who had accompanied her on the trip to the Orissa resort. 

 Police are out to verify this statement by Purnachandra Das, a room boy at Shantinivas Lodge, where Susmita and her friends had put up. Das was arrested at Ramnagar, in Midnapore, on Saturday. 

 A day earlier, two managers of the hotel, Rajesh Das and Asish Das, were arrested in Chandipur and brought to Calcutta to facilitate the inquiry into the mysterious disappearance of Susmita. 

 She and her four university friends Rajib Chowdhury, Suparna Banerjee, Anindita Roy and Soma Samanta along with private tutor Debanjan Das, had reached Chandipur on May 13, 1995. 

 Susmita went missing two days later. Apart from the local police, other agencies, including the CID and the CBI, had conducted separate probes.

 The CID reopened the case a few months ago, on a plea from Susmitas father, Shyamal Dhar, to senior officials at Writers Buildings. 

 During the course of investigation, which revealed photographs of Susmitas blood-stained nightdress, detectives arrested Rajib, Debanjan and Suparna, as well as her father Sachin Banerjee. They are all in jail. While Anindita is dead, Soma lives abroad.

 Room boy Das has told the CID that during their brief stay at Chandipur, the friends had a great time in their hotel room, staying up till early in the morning. He said Susmita and Anindita rarely took part in the revelry and would, instead, spend their time in the garden.

 According to CID officials, Das told them that on the night before Susmita was reported missing, he had seen her in the garden, probably around midnight, all by herself. 

 Das told us it appeared to him that Susmita was crying, an official said. Maybe she had had a fight with her friends over what they were up to. It seems she did not like what was happening there. 

 CID officials said the two arrested managers made contradictory statements to the police. First they said it was impossible for anyone to slip out of the hotel unnoticed, as either of them would be present at the reception round-the-clock. But later they said both were asleep the night before Susmitas disappearance.

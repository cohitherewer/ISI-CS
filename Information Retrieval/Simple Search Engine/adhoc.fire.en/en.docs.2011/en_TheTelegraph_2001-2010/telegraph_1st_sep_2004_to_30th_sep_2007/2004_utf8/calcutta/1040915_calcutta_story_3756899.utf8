The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All that jazz, pop and disco

Ipsita Deb

When 

the Hawaiian tidal wave hit Indian shores, there was little chaos and much to 

smile about. Tsunami (literally meaning Tidal Wave), part of the Pacific Fleet 

Band, performed at the American Center on Monday night to the delight of a select 

audience of musicians and music-lovers.

 This dynamic eight-piece music ensemble surprised the audience with an extensive repertoire hailing from light jazz, pop, disco and the latest chartbusters. The visibly high-adrenaline performance seemed in contrast to their reputation of playing at a variety of solemn occasions, ranging from military and social functions, receptions and community events. 

 The evening began with the lead vocalist, Mallory Mckendry, wooing the audience with light, raspy jazz numbers. While she crooned songs in a typically sultry manner, each musician improvised on the theme with respective instruments in the true spirit of soloing. 

 Just as jazz lovers were getting into the groove and those unfazed by jazz music were beginning to twitch in their seats, country music in the form of Shania Twain?s You?re still the one invaded the musical arena. The sudden shift in music was almost startling. Soon, the strains of Van Morisson?s Brown-eyed girl wafted through the small enclosure and cleared all doubts about Tsunami?s diverse musical capabilities.

 Then followed dance scores which ensured that many were on their feet (to dance of course). With Tide is high, I will survive and We are family, the evening became so much more interactive than the usual staid concerts. Hands clapped, lips moved to lyrics, people danced and feet swayed while the band entertained the audience in true American style, making them wish the music had lasted longer and the cocktails started later.

 Under the operational control of Lieutenant K.C. Collins and direction of musician First Class Guy Greg, the band has performed at the Calcutta School of Music, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, the Marine Engineering and Research Institute and the Navy House. 

 On Tuesday morning, Tsunami conducted a musical workshop for the students of St James School (picture above by Pabitra Das). Part of the goodwill gesture between India and the United States, the navy band is sure to make its presence heard across geographical boundaries.

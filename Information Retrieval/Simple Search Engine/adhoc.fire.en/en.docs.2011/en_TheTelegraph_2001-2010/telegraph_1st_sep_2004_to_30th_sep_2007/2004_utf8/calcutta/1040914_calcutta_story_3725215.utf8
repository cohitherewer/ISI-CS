Behind the Bar

Shaun Kenworthy

Executive Chef, The Park

 I used to work for a restaurateur in London called 

Oliver Peyton. He was quite a successful self-made millionaire who started off 

promoting bands in the mid-80s. He went on to open a nightclub, then won a import 

licence for the first Japanese beer in the UK and then, against all odds, won 

another import licence for Absolut Vodka, where he made most of his money. The 

whole ad campaign belonged to him, thus indirectly making him the person who single-handedly 

put the flavoured vodka on the map.

The Polish had been flavouring theirs for years, but 

Absolut was the brand that really kicked it all off with great marketing and advertising. 

I used to be executive pastry chef for Peyton?s company, looking after five restaurants. 

One of them ?the Atlantic Bar and Grill in Piccadilly 

? had what was (and still is, more than likely), the best cocktail bar in London, 

if not the whole world, called Dick?s Bar. Once a year we used to have an in-house 

cocktail competition that was open to all the bar staff and cocktail barmen in 

the company. 

One year, I decided to have a go myself with a couple 

of cocktails inspired by desserts. Neither of them went any further than the first 

round, but it was good fun all the same. The brief was that you could make anything 

as long as it had two different flavours of Absolut in it. 

I?m going to give you the recipes to try out on your 

friends. Whatever happens, it can only be a blast.

 Absolut passion fruit pavalova

Ingredients: 1 large measure of lemon or regular 

vodka, 1 large measure of fresh cream, 1 small measure of passion fruit syrup

Method: Rim a Martini glass by dipping it into 

beaten egg white and then into sugar. Place some crushed ice into a cocktail shaker. 

Mix together all the ingredients well in a shaker. Pour a little extra passion 

fruit syrup into the glass, then strain the mixture into it. Sprinkle bits of 

meringue on the top.

 Chocolate and chilli aztec shooters

Ingredients: 1 ? measures of vodka, chocolate 

syrup, Tabasco, powdered cinnamon

Method: Pour the vodka into a shot glass. Squeeze 

a little chocolate syrup in from the top and it will settle at the bottom. Throw 

in a few splashes of Tabasco and sprinkle cinnamon on top.

Fruity fortune flavours 

Feng Shui Matters

Pinky Kapoor

 Just before you move into a new house, place 

a basketful of fruits, preferably oranges, so that it is the first thing you see 

once you enter. On the day you move in, every member of the family should carry 

fruits, flowers, fresh green plants or a treasure box. This is symbolic of abundance 

and prosperity in the new abode 

Q: We will soon be moving into our 

new house and will be conducting the relevant religious rituals. As we are avid 

followers of Feng Shui, we would also like to know whether we should do anything 

recommended by this science.

Meghana

The Solution: You should get the new house 

cleaned thoroughly and open all the windows for two days before you actually move 

in. Just before you move in, keep a basketful of fruits, preferably oranges, so 

it is the first thing you see on entering the new house. This is symbolic of abundance 

and prosperity in the new abode. On the day you are moving in, the owner should 

step into the house first, followed by the family. Nobody should enter the house 

empty-handed. Each and every member of the family should carry fruits or flowers 

or a treasure box that is full of valuable coins or fresh green plants into the 

house. Your friends may help move your belongings out of the old house but you 

and your family must move them into the new house. The first thing that is moved 

into the house should be the most valued belonging of the family. This could be 

the wealth box that contains cash, jewellery and asset documents. It is auspicious 

to move in the morning and avoid evenings.

Q: We have seen a plot of land to 

build a house. It is a long narrow plot at the dead end of a road. It is broad 

in the front and gets narrower. There are two high-rise buildings on either side 

of the plot. We plan to construct a three-storey house. While the location is 

good and we are getting a very good deal, we would like your opinion.

J. Banerjee 

The Solution: A road that runs straight into 

the building unchecked is like a poison arrow. It is detrimental to the health 

and prosperity of its residents. It is like a dagger pointing at the house, which 

can cause accidents for those living there. Energy flows straight in a long, narrow 

plot, which again is harmful. A lion-faced plot, which is broad in the front and 

then tapers, is not considered auspicious. Residents are more likely to suffer 

from mental and physical problems. Building a small house between two high-rise 

buildings is also not a good idea as the residents rarely make progress in life. 

In my opinion, it is best to avoid such plots and look for a square or rectangular 

one.

Q:My brother and I are building similar 

houses on adjacent plots with independent boundaries, compound gates and underground 

water tanks. My elder brother is insisting on a common water drainage that would 

flow into my site. Is this in accordance with Feng Shui?

M. Mukherjee

The Solution: The families should individually 

enjoy chi flowing in their environment, enhanced by architecture, landscapes, 

room layout and correct placement of furniture in all rooms. Fortunes are determined 

by the quality and strength of the cosmic energy that enters and circulates the 

atmosphere. Drainage water, a negative feature, should not be allowed into your 

plot at any cost from the adjoining house even if it happens to be your brother?s 

as it can cause conflicts, sufferings and sickness.

Q: I am a college girl and would 

like to teach painting to young kids in my spare time. Which part of the house 

should I convert into a small classroom? I would like to invest in a few tables 

as well. What shapes are productive for tables and what are the colours associated 

with the room?

Smita Arora

The Solution: The western sector of the house 

is connected with creativity and children?s fortune. According to Feng Shui, this 

the best area for creativity. Paint the room in bold yellow ochre or soft cream 

and beige shades with a combination of colours like silver, gold or bronze. Arrange 

circular tables with a round metal or an earthen pot placed in the centre.

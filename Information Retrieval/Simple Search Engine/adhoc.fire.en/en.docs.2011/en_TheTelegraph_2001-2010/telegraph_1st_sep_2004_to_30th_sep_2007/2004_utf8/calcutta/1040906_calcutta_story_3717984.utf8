 Rooks cooks up a dance drama

Rooks

 I cant possibly make a Bollywood film, shrieks Pamela Rooks, even as she checks out the nitty-gritties for the commercial release of her third feature film Dance Like A Man. Adapted from Mahesh Dattanis acclaimed play, the film has already bagged the National Award for Best English film and is set to release worldwide in end-September or early October.

 Pamelas previous film was an adaptation (Khushwant Singhs Train to Pakistan), but the film-maker feels that the source does not necessarily need to be a literary text. The subject has to move me first and only then do I choose to make it into cinema. I have written screenplays, which havent been made into films. I saw the play several years ago and I thought it could adapt very well cinematically. So I took the plunge.

 The plunge was more of a balancing act for Pamela. I knew I wouldnt shoot the film as a play because the two media are so different from each other. So I decided to use the Bharatanatyam dance in the play as the USP of my film. The locations accordingly got expanded and the characters extended.

 Interestingly, the Sahitya Akademi-winning playwright was involved at the scripting stage of the film. Says Pamela: After I finished my first draft, I showed the script to Mahesh and he worked on it and came up with ideas. I also sent my screenplay to the cast, who suggested changes and after all that was done, I started developing the screenplay into separate scenes.

 Mahesh Dattani

If for nothing else it is the cast which makes Dance Like A Man a must watch. Award-winning actress Shobhana returns to the big screen after her Mitr My Friend sojourn alongside the immensely talented Arif Zakaria.

 And making her acting debut is Anoushka Shankar, no less. The film also stars model-turned-actor Samir Soni and thespian Mohan Agashe.

 When I set out to pick my cast, everyone advised me to pick Lillete, recalls Pamela. I said, yes, she has been wonderful on stage but she doesnt know Bharatanatyam. Then I saw Shobhana in Mitr and she seemed perfect for the role Arif is a passionately devoted actor. As per the script he needed to be a competent dancer and not an expert one. So I asked him to go through a six-month training session.

 But it was Anoushka who turned out to be the surprise package. She has grown up with my son and I knew she was interested in acting. Then I came to learn that she has done her Bharatanatyam till the age of 12. So I knew if I gave her a set piece, she would be able to perform. And she has indeed come out very well. She is a complete natural and is extremely comfortable in front of the camera.

 Shobhana

Unlike many of her other contemporaries making English films in India, Pamela is not all that keen to tour the festival circuit. Unless there is a big actress taking the film with her, people pay very little attention to your film. What is more important is a well marketed commercial release. I am so happy that Shyam Shroff and his Shringar Films, who had earlier distributed Mr amp; Mrs Iyer, has taken it upon himself to ensure that Dance Like A Man gets a proper release everywhere.

 The Calcutta-born Pamela is not at all out of touch with Bengali cinema. I have seen Rituparnos and Buddhadebs recent films. What is good about the whole scenario is with the coming up of multiplexes and more television channels, their films are now accessible to everyone, unlike the masterpieces of the Satyajit Rays and Mrinal Sens, she says.

 After Dance Like A Man, Pamela may well go west. I am working on that particular script with Farrukh Dhondy. I am also working on several other scripts on gays, on the dowry system and even a thriller set in Mumbai.

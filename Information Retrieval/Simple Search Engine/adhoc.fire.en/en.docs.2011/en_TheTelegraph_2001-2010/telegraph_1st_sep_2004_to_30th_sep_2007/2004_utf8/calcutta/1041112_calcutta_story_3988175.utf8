 With the kurta-jeans combo becoming almost as popular with the yuppie crowd as the hallowed T-shirt, ethnic chic has flooded the men?s wear market. With the Diwali and wedding buyer in mind, there is ample choice of both casual and ornate kurtas to choose from. The Fab India-fuelled revolution has led to stores across the city jumping on the Dilli bandwagon with fashionable ease, and here is a look at what they are laying out:

Fab India

 Bright coloured kurtas in silk have been the couture call this season at the Hindusthan Road branch of the national chain. The kurtas have flown off the racks with the young and old equally attracted to ethnic wear this season. Trademark kurtas in khaddar and cotton start at Rs 408.

 Make a style statement by draping a fashionable uttariya around your neck (around Rs 200 onwards), which has been a rage of late. Churidars seem to be back in vogue. 

 ?Though the pyjamas have sold well, the churidars have been the real sell-out,? explains Pallabi Basu, store manager.

Gatha

 This Forum outlet might look small but on its racks is a little bit of everything. The second-floor store stocks the national brand, including sherwanis, Jodhpuris, embroidered kurtas, an extensive khadi section and a chic casual section for men. 

 ?Gatha has turned into a national brand in less than two years on the strength of our designs, quality and pricing,? says Raju Duggar, owner of the shop.

 Sherwanis in brocade, jamevar and tissue, embellished with threadwork and Swarovski, are at the high end, ranging from Rs 4,950 to Rs 50,000. The embroidered kurtas come in linen, tussar, moonga and Italian crepe, embellished with intricate thread and zardosi work. Sets come for between Rs 1,295 and Rs 9,000.

 If you are lying low this festive season, opt instead for a short kurta to go with denims. These come in various fabrics like linen, tussar and cotton. These are relatively more affordable, starting at Rs 495.

 For daily wear, the Gatha line of casuals is dominated by checks. Plain, herring bone and twill denim kurtas come for between Rs 585 and Rs 985. 

 Leave the store with the relevant accessories too, like mojris (Rs 295 to Rs 795), stoles, pagris and shawls (Rs 495 to Rs 2,000).

Orly

 Orly, the fashion store for men at 3B Upper Wood Street, has a special festive collection. Fine ethnic wear here includes sherwanis, kurta sets and other ethnic ensembles. The kurtas come in linen, silk, khadi and cotton. 

 The stylishly embroidered and classically styled kurtas come in plain and embroidered varieties. The simple ones start at Rs 350, while the embroidered sets are Rs 850 upwards. 

 The opulent and lavishly embellished sherwanis come for Rs 4,500 onwards. To beat the winter chill, go in for an authentic long jacket to add a touch of class as you keep warm, available both in cotton and silk. Ethnic shirts are also at hand, Rs 350 onwards.

Anokhi

 Anokhi in Forum has launched kurtastyle shirts, short kurtas and long kurtas for men. Design and fabrics are the strongest selling points, according to owner of the local branch Ameeta Raha. 

 The short kurtas cost Rs 650 onwards while the longer options set you back Rs 950 and more. The half-sleeved and full-sleeved casual shirts range between Rs 520 and Rs 630.

Diwan Saheb

 Value-for-money is the mantra at the Metro Plaza store. With embroidered synthetic-cotton blend kurtas selling for Rs 99, you wouldn?t think this shop would draw the big bucks, but the more expensive range is the one that has clicked. 

 ?The kurta set is still the hottest pick this season, with dark colours doing the best,? said a spokesperson for the shop.

 From Rs 500, prices go up to a few thousand. Machine or hand-embroidery on raw silk, crepe, dupion or georgette is just right for a formal occasion. 

 Wedding sets come with embellished jackets. Machine-embroidered pieces come for around Rs 1,200, the jacket sets for around Rs 2,190.

Darshika

 This men?s wear boutique on Dover Lane has just launched its new collection, which is both classy and easy on the pocket. Created by husband-wife duo Rajesh and Shagun Agarwal, the kurta-churidar sets range between Rs 750 and Rs 3,500. 

 Zardosi to kantha, all kinds of hand-embroidery can be found here. The colours of the season start from pale creams moving on to more daring orange, electric blue and bright yellow on cotton, silk, dupion and georgette. 

 Prices begin at Rs 700 for kurtas and go up to four figures for the more elaborate pieces.

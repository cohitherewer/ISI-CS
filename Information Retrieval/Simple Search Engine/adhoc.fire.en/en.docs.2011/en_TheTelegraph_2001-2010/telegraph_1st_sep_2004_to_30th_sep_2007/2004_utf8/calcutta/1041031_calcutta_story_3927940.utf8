 A date with dolphins

 Chandana

 My trip to Sentosa, Singapore?s 

 largest offshore island with its many attractions, packed 

 in quite a bit of action. Though a single day?s activity, 

 it?s too much to put into one column. So I shall do it in 

 two parts.

 The first big attraction at Sentosa 

 was the Dolphin Lagoon at Central Beach, where we were treated 

 to a special Meet the Dolphins show. The first of its kind 

 in Asia, the Dolphin Lagoon houses the Indo-Pacific Humpbacked 

 Dolphins, commonly known as pink dolphins for its coat of 

 ?bubbly? pink in contrast to the usual grey.

 Dolphin Lagoon, built at a cost 

 of approximately $3 million, was specially constructed to 

 simulate a natural environment similar to their original 

 habitat. It contains approximately 30 million litres of 

 filtered natural seawater and the lagoon has an undulating 

 sandy bottom to provide the dolphins with a variety of water 

 depths.

 Meet the Dolphin sessions aim 

 to increase public awareness and help understanding of dolphins. 

 Cheery-looking pink-bellied dolphins leapt in synchronisation, 

 swam, jumped through hoops, twiddled hoops on their snouts 

 and did other cute stuff.

 I watched them perform their natural 

 antics such as spy-hop, tail-flapping and vocalisations. 

 My most memorable moment was being allowed to wade into 

 the shallow waters (under guidance of the staff) and touch 

 and feed these wonderful and highly intelligent marine mammals.

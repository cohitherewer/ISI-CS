The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Behind the bar

Mixologist / Francis Lama

Cocktail drinking is picking up in Calcutta quite 

fast, though straight drinks still rule the roost. The knowledge about cocktails 

is still very limited. And not just that, very few people know the art of mixing 

good cocktails. There are many bartenders who even go wrong with the classics.

One such cocktail with which many people take liberties 

is the classic Bloody Mary. I have rarely seen this internationally-popular drink 

made in the authentic way anywhere in Calcutta. Most importantly, the Bloody Mary 

is supposed to be served in a tall glass and not a short one as commonly done. 

Also, there is no need to lace the rim of the glass with salt or celery salt.

The classic Bloody Mary was invented by Fernand Pete 

Petiot in Harrys New York Bar in Paris in 1921. The ingredients for this are 

a large shot of vodka, a glass of tomato juice, fresh juice of half a lemon, six 

dashes of Worcestershire sauce, three dashes of Tabasco and one pinch each of 

salt and pepper. The ingredients can be shaken or stirred. But no rimming the 

glass with salt.

Here are the recipes for two other popular cocktails, 

which are essentially party drinks. The Cosmopolitan is one of the most popular 

party cocktails. It can be had before or after a meal and in all kinds of weather. 

It was also invented in Harrys New York Bar. The other, Banana Mud Slide, is 

more popular with the ladies because of its sweet taste. It is an after-dinner 

drink and leaves one quite heavy in the stomach because of the creamy content.

Cosmopolitan

Ingredients: 60 ml vodka, 15 ml Triple Sec 

or Cointreau, 60 ml cranberry juice, 30 ml sour mix, orange twist and ice.

Method: Put all the ingredients in a shaker 

and mix well. Then put ice and shake again. Pour the drink into a Martini glass 

and garnish with an orange twist.

Banana mud slide

Ingredients: 15 ml vodka, 15 ml Kahlua, 15 

ml Baileys, 15 ml banana liqueur, 30 ml fresh cream, chocolate sauce and fresh 

banana slices.

Method: Blend all the ingredients well. Rim 

a Martini glass or a large cocktail glass with chocolate sauce. Use big slices 

of banana as garnish.

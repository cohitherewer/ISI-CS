 The City Diary

 Animal resources minister Anisur Rahman has ordered a probe into Monday?s incident at Belgachhia Central Dairy, where employees heckled additional milk commissioner Tushar Mukhopadhyay and brought dairy operations to a standstill. The city?s daily intake of milk from the dairy, around 80,000 litre, has been cut off since Tuesday. 

 If the employees have any grievances, they can approach the higher authorities or even come to me. But such activities are not desirable,? Rahman said on Wednesday, while announcing the probe. The minister, who was on tour when the incident took place, summoned Mukhopadhyay on Wednesday and heard his account of how he was driven out of office. ?In the complaint submitted to me, the additional milk commissioner has stated that he was abused and insulted by the staff,? the minister said. Rahman asked Mukhopadhyay, who has been operating from Writers? Buildings for two days, to resume office at the dairy. Adequate security will be arranged there, the official was assured. 

 enying that militant trade unionism was responsible for the incident, the minister blamed it on the current unrest on the polypack issue. ?We?ll continue to supply milk in lassi and other packets till we find a new polypack supplier,? he said.

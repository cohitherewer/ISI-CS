 George Clooney: House full

Clooney rides the waves

Durga puja is still on full throttle, but Diwali plans 

are already underway, in a big way. And to light up the small screen, HBO brings 

to you the Indian television premiere of the multi-starrer Ocean?s Eleven.

 If you are not interested in the rest of the playing XI, skipper Danny Ocean is enough to get you glued to your TV. The film is a remake of the 1960s hit starring Frank Sinatra in the title role, played with panache this time by George Clooney, with the Brad Pitts and Julia Roberts keeping him company.

 Wielding the directorial baton is Steven Soderbergh, famous for his Oscar-winners Traffic and Erin Brockovich. Soderbergh has gone ahead and almost completed the sequel, Ocean?s Twelve. While the cast remains almost the same (Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia and others) Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the star cast on a heist hop from Amsterdam to Rome to Paris.

 Clooney might also star as detective Guy Noir in a movie based on Garrison Keillor?s radio show A Prairie Home Companion. Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Lyle Lovett and Tom Waits are also expected to fill the screen for the Robert Altman film.

As for his own directorial venture after his critically 

acclaimed debut in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (Sam Rockwell, Drew 

Barrymore) Clooney is planning a film on the early days of American football. 

Here?s hoping director Clooney gives actor Clooney a bigger role this time.

 Reeves: With us, always

Brave words, brave deeds

 Superman is dead, long live Christopher Reeves. The man, perhaps a bigger superhero in his personal life and battles than the one he portrayed on the silver screen, passed away recently. The day he died, BBC World interrupted regular programming to air an interview with Reeves ? one of his last ? as a tribute to the hero.

 Those who were not able to catch it, can do so when the channel beams Talking Movies presenter Tom Brook?s chat with Reeves on October 22 at 1 pm and October 24 at 2 am.

 Recorded at the actor?s home in May this year, Reeves is candid about his life and discusses topics close to his heart, particularly the controversial issue of stem cell research.

 His clarity of thought and articulation is remarkable. Be it rattling off statistics on the opinion patterns of people regarding stem cell research, or pointing out flaws in President Bush?s arguments, it?s both touching and inspiring to hear Reeves. Seeing him put in significant amounts of physical effort just to speak at a stretch is sure to leave many Superman fans misty-eyed.

 Reeves? optimism also shines through. Despite the crippling accident, he believes he has been lucky to have a family and funds to carry him through the troubles. His lingering smile, even in the last frame of the interview, makes it one of the more poignant moments in the history of Talking Movies. Don?t miss it, for Superman?s sake!

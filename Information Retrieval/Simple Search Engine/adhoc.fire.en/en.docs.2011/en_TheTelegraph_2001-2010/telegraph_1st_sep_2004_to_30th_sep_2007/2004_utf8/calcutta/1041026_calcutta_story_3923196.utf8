The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Job abroad offer a fraud

 - Youths lured by newspaper ad cheated of thousands by firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Wanted, a degree-holder in hotel management; willingness to serve on passenger liners or in hotels abroad will be considered a plus point. Contact us at? 

 So runs an advertisement in a daily. Tempting enough for youngsters, but think twice before rushing in your CVs. The offer, which requires forking out a hefty sum, could well be a bait for fleecing money. 

 Following a string of complaints from hotel management students against a consultancy firm that had promised high-profile jobs in overseas hotels, the police have stumbled upon this new style of swindling youths. 

 A preliminary probe revealed that the firm had duped at least three students. 

 ?According to the complaints, the firm took money from the applicants in phases. A massive hunt is on to track the accused,? said an officer of Lake police station, where the complaints were lodged early this month.

 Saumitra Dutta, a victim from Malda, said: ?The firm, M/S Pacific Ship Management and Services Pvt Ltd, offered me a job abroad. It asked for Rs 80,000 as processing fee. I gave the money, but the promises turned out to be false.?

 Surojit Ghora from Kharagpur had a similar experience. ?They promised me a job in a Dubai hotel, at a monthly remuneration of dinar 2,000. In May, I submitted my educational certificates and passport. I was told that the process of confirming the job had been initiated,? Ghora recounted.

 He, indeed, received a call. ?They asked me to come with Rs 20,000 as visa fees. I gave them the money, after which they told me that I would have to shell out another Rs 50,000.? 

 Bankura?s Partha Sarathi Chatterjee, too, was offered a job in Dubai. 

 ?After paying Rs 20,000, they contacted me on July 1 and confirmed my visa. I was also told that the letter confirming my job would reach me soon. I went to their office on Sebak Baidya Street on July 5 and handed over Rs 50,000,? Chatterjee informed. 

 All three ? Dutta, Ghora and Chatterjee ? were told that they would leave for Dubai from Mumbai on July 8. But on July 7, the firm informed them that the journey date had been deferred to July 12. 

 The trio received another phone call, to be told that the date had been rescheduled again. The final date would be conveyed to them later.

 Sensing mischief, the three visited the firm?s office and demanded their money back. ?They handed over our passports and Rs 20,000 each. The assurance that the rest would be paid soon proved false. Those who ran the firm are at large,? said Ghora.

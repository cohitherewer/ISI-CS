 Party hue in hooch trade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A gang enjoying patronage of the ruling CPM is plying an illicit liquor trade in Kalidham, scene of the hooch tragedy on Friday night. The death toll in the latest liquor mishap has climbed to 10.

 On Tuesday, senior district police officers said they had conducted several raids last year on hooch dens in Dum Dum and arrested about 35 youths, all activists of various political parties. But ?political pressure? blocked the raids before the Lok Sabha polls.

 The Barrackpore-based gang gets the liquor in large plastic containers ferried in ladies? compartments of local trains to Dum Dum station, where its agents collect the consignment and organise retail sale of the liquor in plastic pouches from several dens.

 The entire operation is conducted by Gopali ? allegedly seen campaigning for the ruling CPM in the election ? who engages several operatives on commission to handle the distribution network.

 The gang is also engaged in smuggling of garments and electronic goods.

 District superintendent of police Parveen Kumar said 28 members of the gang, including a woman, have been arrested since Monday evening for their involvement in selling of illicit liquor in Kalidham and other adjoining areas of Dum Dum. Kumar also claimed that at least four hooch dens were busted.

 Ten hooch consumers, including two women, have died since Friday. It is learnt that they all had consumed illicit liquor supplied to them by Niva Pal and two of her sons, Tinku and Bishu. Niva and her sons live in Kalidham and have been selling illicit liquor in the area for the past three years, with local police turning a blind eye.

 ?I had told the chief minister about the functioning of the gang. But I don?t know what action Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s police had taken,? said Trinamul Congress MLA Arunabha Ghosh.

 Dum Dum MP Amitava Nandi of the CPM, however, denied the existence of any such gang involved in supplying of illicit liquor. 

 ?If police have any knowledge about such a gang, why are they not arresting the entire lot?? he asked.

 Nandi, however, came down heavily on the district police. ?No one has prevented police from taking these criminals into custody? Both police and the excise department are not doing their jobs properly,? he alleged.

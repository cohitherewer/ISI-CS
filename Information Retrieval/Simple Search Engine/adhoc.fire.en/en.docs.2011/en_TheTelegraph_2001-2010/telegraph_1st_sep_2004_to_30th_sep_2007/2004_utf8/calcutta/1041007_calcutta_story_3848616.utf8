Tour of town: A crowd surges towards a pandal

 The state tourism department?s plan to sell a five-day 

Puja package tour to domestic and international tourists, in association with 

private tour operators, is indeed a commendable effort (Puja package with private 

player, September 9). 

 The package might consist of meals, accommodation in a good hotel and transport, along with the cultural extravaganza on offer, but it is doubtful how many domestic travellers will be able to avail of the package at a cost of Rs 22,000 per head. 

 The foreign tourists may be able to afford the package price of $ 750. But it will not be wise on the part of the department to take it for granted that all tourists will have so much disposable money for sight-seeing. 

 If the idea is to project our city and culture, rituals and heritage, tourism minister Dinesh Dakua should re-consider the price for the package. Since this Puja tour package concept is at a nascent stage now and is being introduced for the first time, it will be better if the price is fixed on a ?no-profit-no-loss? basis. The package may be priced differently, keeping a profit margin, on the basis of the response that it gets. 

 Also, the price should be viable ? an amount which is less than what people would have to spend if they go pandal-hopping and sight-seeing on their own during the Puja days. 

 An option could also be offered to those who are travelling on shoe-string budgets. I have gathered from my experiences that tourists to Calcutta always look for a responsible tour operator who would offer a reasonably-priced package. A government-sponsored programme has an advantage in this regard.

The traffic congestion on Harish Mukherjee Road when the junior section of Gokhale Memorial Girls? School gives over at 2.40 pm is undoubtedly a serious cause for concern (Chaos street after class, September 10). The stretch in front of the school gets so badly clogged that the hapless youngsters remain stranded in the area for a long time. The guardians and passers-by also suffer because of this. 

 Such traffic snarls happen on a daily basis near South Point School in Ballygunge, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy in Alipore and other places as well. 

 It is heartening that Janasanjog Mancha has come forward to address the woes of the students and others who suffer due to the regular traffic disorder on Harish Mukherjee Road every afternoon.

The chaotic situation in front of Gokhale Memorial 

Girls? School on Harish Mukherjee Road after school hours has been plaguing the 

area for a long time now. Thanks to the NGO, maybe now the authorities will actually 

rise to the occasion and address the problem.

It was great to learn that the police have finally 

decided to initiate steps to clear traffic jams before and after school hours 

in front of city schools. Apart from the drivers of vehicles, I feel, sooner the 

school students learn to obey traffic rules, the better it will be for all.

Apropos the report ?Tankers on track till Puja-end?, September 10, it was interesting to note that transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has requested tanker-owners to call off their strike and wait till the end of the Pujas. The tankers? associations may pay heed to the request till the Pujas but the minister will have to think of something worthwhile before they change their mind and strike work again.

Kudos for highlighting the theft of manhole covers in ?10,000 manhole covers vanish?, September 7. It is evident that a big gang is behind these thefts. Drug addiction and snap lotteries may be forcing youths to indulge in such criminal activities, but putting innocent pedestrians in danger is a heinous offence. People may even lose their lives in the monsoon months, when the roads are waterlogged.

Apropos the report ?Biryani mouthful for Bengali palates?, September 7, it was interesting to note how the biryani of the Mughals has become a part and parcel of our lives. The huge increase in footfall in restaurants as well as street-corner shops selling biryani ratifies the belief. But it is pertinent to point out that there has been a marked deterioration in the quality of biryani being served at these outlets over the years.

 Apropos the report ?Lalbazar laurels for its honest men?, September 9 , the story evoked a hearty laugh. Aren?t all policemen expected to be honest and sincere in the first place? The award points a finger at how cops today are adjudged exceptional if they are honest.

Apropos the report ?A whiff of fresh air for the cops?, September 11, it is heartening to note that the Calcutta Police will be setting up 10 oxygen parlours at different traffic points in the city. It will be a real breather for the cops who have to live each day amidst tremendous vehicular pollution. But what about the residents of the city? 

Md. Ayub,

Bright Street. 

This is about the article ?Wed in high style at star address (October 2). At no point did I say that hotels in the city would not survive without weddings. The mainstay of all hotels are rooms. Banquets come much later, though they are important. This statement gives an incorrect picture of the Indian hotel industry and affects the entire hotel industry of Calcutta.

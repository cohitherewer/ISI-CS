The ?business of fashion? is a subject much-talked about in the style circuit. However, many of our city?s style divas would be put to shame at the kind of professionalism the young students of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) blend in with their creativity.

 Professionalism was indeed the keyword at Tantu, the graduating show of the students of the textile design department of NIFT, held at The Park on November 8. Thirty students showcased the collections they had worked on during their five-month stint with textile companies as part of their two-year post-graduate course. 

 ?This is the third year we hosted Tantu and the focus has always been on home furnishings. This is one area which is catching up fast in the international market,? informed Prosenjit Bhadra, assistant professor. quot;The students have been sponsored by various textile companies all over India. They have worked with these companies for five months and produced their final collections based on the specifications laid down by their respective companies,? he added

 The display on Monday evening was followed by the award ceremony. Surbhi Jain walked away with the best academic performance prize, while Neha Mishra and Ekta Kacker were feted for the best diploma projects. 

 The exhibition showcased some exquisite home furnishings including curtains, upholstery, cushions, cushion covers, blankets, duvets, quilts, table linen etc ,on various themes. Though broad guidelines were given to the students by their respective companies depending on international forecasts for the respective seasons and the market, they were also given creative independence. 

 But what excites the students more than the awards is the fact that a major part of their collection has already bagged orders from retail houses in Europe and the US. Said Neha Singhal, whose line has been selected by Marks amp; Spencer, ?All the lines I have done during my stint with Orient Craft in Gurgaon are targeted at the European and the US markets and two of my collections have already bagged orders.?

 Neha Mishra, who has worked with Earthen World in Delhi, has not only received big orders from Greece and Italy, she also won the first prize at the Indian Handicraft Gift Fair in Delhi last month.

 ?Almost all the students have received big international orders for their home furnishing lines. What?s more, many of them will get to participate in international textile fairs in Frankfurt, Brazil, Hong Kong etc. Apart from that, they will all be absorbed by those companies where they did their internship,? added Bhadra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : About Us

 Monday, December 20, 2004 

 Welcome to The Telegraph 

the largest circulated English daily in Eastern India.

The Telegraph was launched on the 7th July, 1982, published by the ABP group of 

publications. The Telegraph in its short life span of 25 years has become the 

largest circulated English daily in the eastern region published from Calcutta. 

 The Telegraph 

is the only English newspaper launched in post independent India which has overtaken 

the established market leader in the region. 

 The reason for this success can 

be attributed to constant value addition to the product. 

 In keeping with this philosophy The Telegraph has introduced a sixteen-page colour 

section called T2 devoted solely to entertainment and lifestyle. This appears from 

Monday to Saturday. The Telegraph also has a four-page colour section called Metro devoted to Calcutta and its people. This appears from Monday to Sunday.

 The Telegraph is also published from Guwahati ( to cater to the entire northeast), 

Siliguri ( for North Bengal and Sikkim), Jamshedpur, and Ranchi ( for Jharkhand).

 The Telegraph today offers, in addition to its extensive 

national, international, and business news a wide variety of reading material 

on special interests. 

 Monday : Knowhow A two page broadsheet on science, computers and health.

Tuesday : The Telegraph 

Jobs, a tabloid on jobs available, on how to approach interviews with interviews 

on those succeeded and those who take interviews. 

Wednesday : 

Telekids an exciting eight page colour tabloid for children.

Thursday : 

CareerGraph a special eight page colour guide for students and graduates on 

the lookout for jobs and career opportunities. 

Saturday : The Personal Telegraph a four page guide on gadgets, cars, travel, holding a party etc.

Sunday : Graphiti A thirty two page colour magazine.In addition there is 

a six page section called 7 Days and four pages of The Telegraph Classifieds in 

colour.

 This internet edition is a part of the ongoing exercise 

of trying to reach more people interested in India and specifically the eastern 

part of the country.

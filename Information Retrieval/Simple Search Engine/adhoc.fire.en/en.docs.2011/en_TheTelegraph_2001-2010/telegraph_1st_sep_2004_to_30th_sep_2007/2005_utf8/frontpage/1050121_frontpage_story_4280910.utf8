 Gunfire replay

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 20: An Indian Army position was fired at and shelled from across the Line of Control for the second time in three days, risking a failure of the 13-month ceasefire.

 Despite defence minister Pranab Mukherjee?s assertion that ?nothing will happen to heighten tension?, the Indian Army position at Gambhir post in Rajouri sector, immediately south of Poonch, was targeted. Army sources confirmed the post was fired at with universal machine guns and mortars.

 What is of immediate concern is that tonight?s firing can be construed as a geographical spread of the ceasefire violation.

 Enter, empire builder

 - The day after, Anil gets cracking 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Anil Ambani comes out of the Tirupati temple. (PTI) 

Mumbai, June 19: Six constructive Cs have replaced 

the three-C curse.

 The younger Reliance scion has got cracking to build his own empire ? Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises ? a day after the division of his fathers legacy.

 The regulation Tirupati thanksgiving over, Anil Ambani today put his money where his mouth is: he uncorked plans to shovel as much as Rs 3,000 crore of his personal wealth into Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital.

 After the thud of cash came the jangle of sound bites. 

 Six Cs will be his new corporate mantra: customer and customer care, corporate governance and corporate values and creativity and competitiveness.

 The other three Cs you already know. These are different, Anil added. Soon after the feud between the brothers had become public knowledge, Anil had said his father had always warned him to be wary of three Cs ? chamchas, chelas and cronies. Anils mention of the three Cs then was seen as a reference to big brother Mukeshs advisers.

 The closest of Mukeshs aides ? Anand Jain ? ceased to be a member of the Reliance Energy board from today. Jain ? whose daughter is getting married this week in Goa, where Mukesh is now as a guest ? had put in his papers as part of yesterdays deal to divide management control.

 But for the acceptance of the letter from Jain, Anil appeared keen to put a message across that let bygones be bygones. The best way to put it is that it is a new beginning, he said soon after he chaired the board meetings of Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital.

 I have never commented on family issues, Anil said, declining to react to questions involving his brother. 

 Mukesh will do extremely well. Both of us played an important role in building Reliance group with the towering leadership of our father Dhirubhai Ambani, the younger brother added. Anil spoke about the role his mother Kokilaben played in bringing about the settlement and reminisced about a small pillow she gave him many years ago. The pillow had a small inscription which said: Mothers hold their childrens hand for a while but their hearts forever.

 The message on the pillow was the same one he was trying to send to those involved with his two business babies ? Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital.

 Anil made it a point to underscore the fact that he does not hold any personal stake in the two companies at the moment. I am putting my personal resources and it shows my fiduciary duty and commitment to the companies I now own, he added.

 Of the Rs 3,000 crore he mentioned, Rs 2,000 crore will be earmarked for Reliance Capital. I intend to transform Reliance Capital to a full spectrum financial services powerhouse. 

 If regulations allow at a later stage, he will also get into banking and allied activities. The remaining Rs 1,000 crore will be invested in Reliance Energy.

 The energy plans include public-private partnership in generating nuclear power. For the moment, he will concentrate on the largest gas power project in a single location in Dadri in Uttar Pradesh and the biggest pit-head coal-powered power project in Orissa.

 Anil said he would take a shot at bidding for the two airports in NewDelhi and Mumbai. Trans-harbour links and mass rapid transit systems for commuters are also on his radar.

 The younger brother revealed that one of the major decisions taken by the board of Reliance Capital was to ask Reliance Industries tocompensate the company fully for the IPCL shares transferred some monthsago.

 Asked whether he will snap all ties with Reliance Industries ? he has resigned as vice-president and managing director of the flagship which will be run by Mukesh ? he said: I was, I am and I will always be a Reliance Industries shareholder. I can always go to the AGM (annual general meeting) as a shareholder to avail of the discount coupon and ice-cream.

 No headway in tea talks

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Dibrugarh, June 18: The seventh round of discussions between representatives of the Consultative Committee of Plantation Associations (CCPA), the Asom Chah Karmachari Sangha (ACKS) and the Asom Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS) ended here today without any significant breakthrough.

 A press communiqu? issued by the ACKS here today said the discussions remained inconclusive and the CCPA has agreed to hold the next rounds of discussions in the first week of July.

 The CCPA had sought a proposal on the revision of leave travel assistance pending since 2000. But we rejected it since revision of payscales is more important for us, said ACKS general secretary Girish Chandra Borpatra Gohain. The discussions with the ACMS today, too, did not bear any fruit. The CCPA is pressing for a productivity-linked incentive plan and the discussions were centred on it, said Madhusudhan Khandait, who led the ACMS delegation.

 Tea body rift: In a bid to avert a split in the All Assam Tea Tribes Students Association (ATTSA), former office-bearers of the union are meeting all the leaders of the students association here tomorrow, adds our Guwahati staff reporter. 

 The former office-bearers are of the view that a split in the AATSA would weaken the tea communitys welfare movement as the ATTSA has been working as an important pressure group. The AATSA has been on the verge of a split, with each faction accusing the other of betraying the communitys cause.

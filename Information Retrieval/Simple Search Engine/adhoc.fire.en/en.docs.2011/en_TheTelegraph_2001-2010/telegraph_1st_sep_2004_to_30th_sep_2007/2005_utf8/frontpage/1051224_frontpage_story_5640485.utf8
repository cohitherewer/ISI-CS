The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Recall buzz has some Pawar 

 - Speculation over two options for Sourav re-entry 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Chappell and Pawar: In 15 or 16?

 Calcutta, Dec. 23: The buzz suggests that Sourav Ganguly is going to be recalled for the three-Test series in Pakistan.

 However, till late tonight, it wasnt clear whether the former Team India captain will make it to the 15 on merit or, possibly, quietly be added as the 16th player when the squad is referred to Sharad Pawar for presidential clearance.

 Going by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) constitution, the secretary (Niranjan Shah, in this case) is duty-bound to get the presidents approval before announcing any squad heading overseas.

 Interestingly, when contacted by The Telegraph in Mumbai, Shah remarked no decision had been taken on numbers.

 Whether its 15 or 16 is to be known tomorrow only? Last time, 15 went to Pakistan, but were going to be guided by the requirements, he said.

 The senior national selectors (Kiran More, V.B. Chandrasekhar, Bhupinder Singh (Sr), Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal) meet at the Wankhede Stadium in a few hours.

 Also present will be captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell. Neither has a vote, but their influence isnt insignificant.

 Sourav, it may be recalled, got dropped after the recent Kotla Test despite a reasonable outing (40 and 39). 

 Chappell and Dravid didnt go on record, but Mores explanation that the selectors were looking to the future and that Sourav couldnt be slotted at No. 6 didnt cut much ice.

 Even Pawar expressed outrage ? albeit as a fan and not the BCCI president. He has been insisting there wont be interference in the selection process, but is understood to have given an assurance to some in high office.

 That Pawar met Sourav for an hour at his New Delhi residence, earlier this week, has been interpreted by many as a signal for More and Co.

 Others, though, have refused to read too much.

 In fact, some are linking Souravs fate with maestro Sachin Tendulkars one-on-one with Pawar at the CCI this evening, before the gradation committee met to discuss contracts.

 Sachin stays far away from anything even remotely controversial, but Pawar could have sought a neutral view (as a source put it) on Souravs problem with Chappell.

 Sourav, incidentally, is set to continue on a grade A retainership.

 Team India did win the just-ended Motera Test without Sourav (and Dravid, who was hospitalised), but Gautam Gambhir continued to fail and Mohammed Kaif (brought in for the indisposed captain) flopped in both innings.

 For Sourav to make the 15, one of them has to be dropped. But, then, he also has to fit into Dravid and Chappells first 11?.

 Its not confirmed, but if Sourav makes it straightaway, then a second wicketkeeper (Parthiv Patel is being talked about) can be the 16th player.

 Again, theres nothing official, but Zaheer Khan seems to be somewhat in the frame. The quick hasnt played after Zimbabwe, but may take Murali Kartiks place.

 An extra seamer is going to make sense.

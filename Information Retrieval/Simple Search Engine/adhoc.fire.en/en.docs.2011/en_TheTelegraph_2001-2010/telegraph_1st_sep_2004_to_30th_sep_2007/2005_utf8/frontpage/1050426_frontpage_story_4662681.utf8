 Terror jolt to Delhi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 25: Two suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba militants were shot dead in front of the Pragati Maidan trade fair grounds in the capital tonight.

 The encounter ? the first of its kind in the area ? occurred near the Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium where President Pervez Musharraf watched a one-dayer a little over a week ago.

 Police said ?voter identity cards? found on the two suggested that they were from Kashmir. The cards had the names of Manzoor Ahmed Wani and Mohammad Amin Bhatt but a diary mentioned Osama and Sabeer.

 Along with an AK-56 rifle and 2 kg of RDX, the two were also carrying detonators with timers ?that can be set for a period of about an year?, an officer said.

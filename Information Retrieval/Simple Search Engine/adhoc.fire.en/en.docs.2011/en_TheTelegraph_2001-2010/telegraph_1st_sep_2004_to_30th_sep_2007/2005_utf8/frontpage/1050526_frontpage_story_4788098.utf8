 Sachin: Injury break

 London, May 25: Sachin 

 Tendulkar has had surgery in London for his troubled tennis 

 elbow and will be out of action for four months.

 He was treated by consultant orthopaedic surgeon Andrew Wallace, a daredevil young Australian who goes to work on his superfast motorcycle, weaving in and out of heavy London traffic. 

 Given all the rules about client confidentiality, Wallace consulted Sachin and his family and then said today: Sachin Tendulkar was admitted to the Hospital of St. John amp; St. Elizabeth for treatment to his left elbow.

 Wallace, who is based at the St. John amp; St. Elizabeth Hospital in west London, added that the Indian batting superstar underwent a surgical procedure under local anaesthetic for a condition affecting the extensor tendons.

 In hospital, Sachin, who went as a private patient, probably found it reassuring that Wallace has treated other sportsmen.

 The procedure was successful and there were no complications, said Wallace. 

 He is expected to be discharged tomorrow and to make a full recovery. He should be fit to return to playing cricket in approximately 16 weeks.

 It is understood that Sachin, whose wifes family comes from the UK, was treated and discharged on Monday. 

 Sachin will miss a triangular one-day series against Sri Lanka and West Indies in August and his chances of touring Zimbabwe in September are slim. His availability for the Superseries in Australia in October could also come under a cloud.

 Sachin first suffered what was originally described as tennis elbow while at the nets in the Netherlands last August. 

 Wallace graduated from the medical school at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, before moving to Edinburgh to do postgraduate research on bone healing.

 In 2004, he was appointed consultant orthopaedic surgeon at St Marys Hospital.

 He seems to share Sachins craze for speed ? he rides a BMW 1150RT motorcycle, which is a risky venture in London.

 Delhi waits for Pak nod on LoC camps

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: The India-Pakistan diplomatic game over the debris of quake-struck villages on both sides of the Line of Control in Kashmir continues despite both New Delhi and Islamabad proposing to set up relief centres on the de-facto border.

 A team of senior officials from India will visit Pakistan shortly to work out the logistics of relief and Indian Army teams near the LoC are ready to set up camps though Delhi has not got a formal response from Islamabad on its proposal.

 Foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said today that the three relief centres proposed to be set up at Chakan da Bagh, Kaman and Teethwal could not be opened without Islamabads concurrence. India had proposed to open the centres from tomorrow in the proposal announced on Saturday.

 The spokesperson said there were also specific proposals from Pakistan and that they were being examined by the government. All the proposals will be discussed during the talks to be held by the Indian team when it visits Pakistan.

 Sarna said the announcement that the centres will be opened from October 25 (tomorrow) did not indicate a deadline but was just a statement of intent on the time India would take to be ready with the aid. 

 We needed the time (three days) to put the relief camps up but they can be operational once we have got Pakistans concurrence which is awaited, he said.

 India will be represented at a UN-convened meeting in Geneva on Wednesday that will discuss international assistance to Pakistan.

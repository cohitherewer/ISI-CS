 Kuki group seeks clarity in dialogue 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Feb. 4: The Kuki Students? Organisation (KSO) in Manipur has urged the Centre to be ?transparent? in dealing with the problems of various communities of the Northeast.

 ?There must be transparency, equity and justification in the government?s dealings with all communities (in the region),? a statement signed by KSO president Kamkhohao Khongsai and secretary general Lunkhosei Touthang said here today.

 The statement under the caption ?Statement of facts in the context of NSCN (I-M) and Indian government talks? was issued even as Naga leaders Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Chishi Swu resumed their peace talks with the Centre.

 Last week, a one-day convention attended by influential Kuki organisations, including a human rights group and women associations, called for safeguarding the territorial integrity of Manipur.

 Reacting to the NSCN (I-M) demand for integration of all Naga-inhabited areas under one administrative unit, the KSO cited historical facts claiming that Kukis were controlling the hills of Manipur. 

 The KSO leaders said the Kukis fought the British and even joined the Indian National Army. But the sudden ?aggression? by the NSCN (I-M) had shaken the Kukis? faith in India?s democratic polity.

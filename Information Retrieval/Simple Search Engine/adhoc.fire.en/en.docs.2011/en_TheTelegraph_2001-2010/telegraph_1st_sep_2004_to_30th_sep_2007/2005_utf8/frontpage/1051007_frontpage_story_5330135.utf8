 Air fares to go up 10 per cent 

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Jet and Sahara have decided to raise fares by 10 per cent from October 14 in the wake of rising prices of aviation fuel. Indian Airlines is expected to follow suit, reports our special correspondent.

 With the hike, regular one-way fares between Delhi and Calcutta will touch Rs 11,000 and Delhi-Mumbai Rs 9,700.

 Check-fares, available in three or four baskets in different sectors, and other promotional fares will also go up by 10 per cent.

 Air Sahara and Jet announced fare hikes this morning. IA sources confirmed that an internal meeting held late today had agreed to a fare hike, which has to be cleared by civil aviation minister Praful Patel.

 Patel is believed to be hesitant over a price increase just before Diwali but has privately admitted that it may be a necessity.

 He said the Centre would consider letting airlines hedge against aviation fuel prices to help them manage costs.

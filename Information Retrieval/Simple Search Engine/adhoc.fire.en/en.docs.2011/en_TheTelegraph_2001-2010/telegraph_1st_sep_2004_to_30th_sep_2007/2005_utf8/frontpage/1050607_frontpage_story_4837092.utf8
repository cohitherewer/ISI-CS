 Seats cut in colleges

 New Delhi, June 6: Screws have been tightened on self-financing private engineering and management institutes with a government-appointed watchdog deciding to abolish as many as 38,000 seats across the country this year, reports our special correspondent.

 The All India Council for Technical Education wielded the broom as part of its efforts to weed out institutes that have been mushrooming with neither the necessary faculty nor other resources.

 As many as 25,335 seats have been taken off engineering colleges found lacking in facilities, an official release said.

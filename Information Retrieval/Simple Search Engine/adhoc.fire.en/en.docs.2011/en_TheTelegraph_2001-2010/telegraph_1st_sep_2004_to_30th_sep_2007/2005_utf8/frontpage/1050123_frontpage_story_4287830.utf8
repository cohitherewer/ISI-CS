 Beta Anil reminds big brother of full family

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 22: A day after personal correspondence between the two warring Ambani brothers spilled into the public domain, Anil Ambani spurned overtures made by his elder brother Mukesh.

 Instead, he demanded a ?fair and equitable solution for all members of the Ambani family and millions of Reliance shareholders?.

 In a sharp attack against Mukesh?s close associates ? whom a statement dubbed ?chamchas, chelas and cronies? ? the Anil camp made it clear that any meeting between the two brothers should also include their mother Kokilaben and sisters Dipti and Nina. They would have to be involved in any settlement process, it said.

 Anil?s response came a day after it was revealed that elder brother Mukesh had been seeking a meeting with him since November 30 last year to resolve their differences. ?Beta, let us meet and discuss,? Mukesh was quoted as telling Anil over phone.

 In a tongue-in-cheek remark, a spokesperson for Anil said: ?Shri Mukesh Ambani went public on ownership issues on November 16, 2004, though he himself said these were issues in the private domain.?

 ?Within a few days of Mukesh Ambani?s statement, Anil left all decisions on these issues to his mother, Kokilaben Ambani,? the spokesperson for Anil said.

 Observers tracking the sibling rivalry said the statement seeks to suggest that it was Mukesh who put the private family matters in the public domain while the younger brother tried to settle the issues by asking their mother to intervene.

 ?For several weeks, and for their own selfish motives which are apparent to everyone, the 3 Cs ? chamchas, chelas and cronies ? through a sustained campaign of disinformation denied the existence of any family process to derail the process of finding an internal solution,? Anil?s spokesperson said.

 ?Not surprisingly, the 3 Cs have now done a volte-face, and finally confirmed by an avoidable publication by them of the family?s private and confidential communications to each other that there is a process underway, to resolve matters concerning the Reliance group and the Ambani family.?

 Appropriate meetings between Mukesh and Anil, with the involvement of their mother and two sisters, will take place as part of that process, they added.

 ?Anil is committed to maintaining a positive and constructive attitude, in the interests of arriving at a fair and equitable solution, for all members of the Ambani family and, above all, for millions of shareholders of the Reliance Group,? the spokesperson said.

 Earlier, Anil virtually turned down the request by the board of IPCL, a state-owned company acquired by the Reliance group, to reconsider his resignation as vice-chairman, saying various issues, including corporate governance and disclosure, needed to be resolved before he could rethink his decision.

 Romi and Kapil: House trouble 

 New Delhi, April 28: Cricket icon Kapil Dev?s wife Romi has found herself on a sticky wicket with a court ordering the sealing of a swank property housing her wedding-organiser business.

 The multi-storeyed building in south Delhi?s upscale Greater Kailash I ? which has Romi?s shop called This N That ? has come under the high court?s glare for commencing commercial operations without a completion certificate.

 The court had earlier directed that without a completion certificate from the civic body none from a list of 16 ? Romi?s property is located at B-41 ? should start business. 

 Justice Pradeep Nandrajog today asked the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to seal the property tomorrow by 10 am. The court also asked the Greater Kailash assistant commissioner of police to ensure that assistance was provided to the civic body by tomorrow morning to carry out the sealing.

 This N That is a joint venture between Romi and her cousin Meera Bhatia. Set up more than three years ago as a gift outlet, it grew into a business that organises big weddings. The operation has earned annual revenues of between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 1 crore since it forayed into weddings.

 While Meera takes care of the monetary aspect of the business, Romi looks after the creative part.

 Romi had created a flutter at one of Delhi?s showpiece wedding exhibitions by decorating a private jet with flowers and frills and decking up stewardesses in special saris. She had ferried a group of workers on the flight to finish the project mid-air so that the baraat could step into an all-set aircraft as soon as it landed.

 While giving the seal order, the court took note of an affidavit by an MCD executive engineer, R.B.S. Bansal, that the proprietor of This N That occupied the rear side of the property without getting the completion or occupancy certificate.

 MCD counsel Ashok Bhasin said the court had on December 17 directed the civic body and the police to ensure that the properties were not occupied or put to use till officials certified that ?the construction is completed strictly in conformity with the sanctioned building plan?.

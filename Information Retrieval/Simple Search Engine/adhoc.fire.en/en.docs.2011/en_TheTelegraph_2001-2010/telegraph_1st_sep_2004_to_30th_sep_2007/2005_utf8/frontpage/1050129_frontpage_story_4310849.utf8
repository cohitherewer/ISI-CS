P amp;G acquires razor edge

OUR BUREAU 

Jan. 28: Buy a pack of Pampers diapers and 

take two Duracell batteries free!

This wouldn?t have been possible until yesterday, 

but tomorrow ? who knows?

Procter amp; Gamble Co. is buying out Boston-based 

Gillette Company in a $57-billion deal that unites two iconic US producers of 

household goods from Pampers to Duracell.

Both are present in India and will now bring their 

combined impact to bear on competition, Hindustan Lever being the key rival.

Lever and P amp;G, a late entrant into India, have 

been locked in a price war in shampoos, detergents and personal care products.

Globally, the combined P amp;G-Gillette entity will 

boast more than $60 billion in annual revenues, overtaking Unilever NV as the 

world?s largest consumer products company.

The merger would be the largest acquisition in the 

US since J.P. Morgan Chase acquired Bank One for $60 billion last year. 

P amp;G will pay a premium of 18 per cent over prevailing 

market price for Gillette, best known for its razors. 

In India, Gillette India chairman Saroj Poddar said 

the deal had ?come as a total surprise?. Gillette Company of the US has a 52 per 

cent stake in the Indian arm, formed almost 20 years ago. 

A New York Times report said the overture for 

the deal had come from Gillette. If true, this means that Gillette had not kept 

Poddar in the loop while making the overture or during the talks. 

Shantanu Khosla, country manager of P amp;G India, 

said: ?It is early to predict the impact of the Gillette acquisition on the P amp;G 

India business.?

The deal has the support of billionaire investor Warren 

Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has a 9 per cent stake in Gillette. 

?This merger is going to create the greatest consumer 

product company in the world,? Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, said. ?It?s 

a dream deal.?

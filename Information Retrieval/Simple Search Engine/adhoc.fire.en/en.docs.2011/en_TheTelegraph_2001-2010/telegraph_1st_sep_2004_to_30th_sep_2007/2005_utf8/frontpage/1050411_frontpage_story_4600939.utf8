 Washington, April 10: India is stealing the spotlight in thousands of homes in America?s national capital area: not because K. Natwar Singh, P. Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal and Montek Singh Ahluwalia are promoting the country across the US this fortnight as the next global power ? or in spite of them. The Washington glitterati?s current peak interest in India is on account of Aishwarya Rai, Ashvin Kumar and Mughal-e-Azam. 

 On Wednesday, Filmfest DC, the 19th annual Washington DC International Film Festival will open with director Rituparno Ghosh?s Raincoat, an Aishwarya Rai-Ajay Devgan starrer set in Calcutta. The opening gala will be followed during the next 11 days by 10 Indian films. 

 In addition, a Bengali film, Songs of Mahulbani, has been entered for the festival?s ?Capital Focus Award?, a first-time, juried competition of selected films ?deserving increased recognition?. This Bengali film, set in the Santhal tribal village of Mahulbani, has already created considerable interest here in the run-up to the festival. 

 In these days when political correctness rules America, the film is controversial 

because of its focus on a young non-Santhal doctor who helps the villagers in 

the fight for their rights, and in the process, gets involved with a local married 

woman. 

 The films director, Sekhar Das, and heroine Rupa Ganguly will be here 

in person during the festival to discuss their work. Songs of Mahulbani will be 

shown here along with Ashvin Kumars 15-minute film, Little Terrorist, which 

was nominated for an Oscar this year in the short film category. 

 The festivals organisers are using the occasion to premiere to viewers 

here one of Bollywoods biggest extravaganzas ever, the 45-year-old Mughal-e-Azam. 

What Americans will get to see is the restored, colour version of the 178-minute 

epic, which was released in some American theatres in New York and Los Angeles 

a few days ago. 

In a celluloid mirror image of the handshake between Prime Ministers Manmohan 

Singh and Wen Jiabao in New Delhi, the theme of this years Filmfest DC will 

be From Beijing to Bollywood.

 The organisers have rationalised this choice on Americas current efforts 

to develop all-round relations with India and China. Festival director Tony Gittens 

believes that because of the initiative, hopefully, areas of culture previously 

unknown will be illuminated in new ways. 

 Gautam Bambawale, the counsellor for culture at the Indian embassy here, says 

Gittens and assistant festival director Shirin Ghareeb firmed up their decision 

to make India along with China the central focus of this years 

festival after they attended the 35th International Film Festival of India in 

Goa in December. He said a Gujarati folk dance troupe sponsored by the Indian 

Council for Cultural Relations will perform on the festivals opening night. 

 On their return from Goa, Gittens and Ghareeb asked Manjula Kumar, a director 

of the Smithsonian office of education and museum studies, to programme the choice 

of 10 Indian films for the festival. 

 We have selected works of celebrated contemporary filmmakers like Mani 

Ratnam, Rituparno Ghosh and Govind Nihalani and included the pioneering work of 

young, yet-to-be-discovered talent like Ligy Pullapally and Ashvin Kumar, 

she explained in a festival document.

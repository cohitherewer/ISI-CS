Calcutta, May 4: A gang of four walked into 

a cellphone shop off a busy road in south Calcutta this afternoon and shot dead 

the woman at the counter, in what police think is an extortion killing.

Reshmi Mahnot, 30, whose husband owns the Nokia outlet 

Elekrocrafts on Lake Terrace, off Lansdowne Road, was in the shop as usual with 

her father-in-law Dalpat Mahnot. 

A cellphone demonstrator, a Nokia serviceman and a 

bag supplier were also present when the four arrived at 2.15 pm, pretending to 

be customers, deputy commissioner of police (south) Anuj Sharma said.

?After asking Reshmi to show a cellphone, one of them 

brandished a revolver and opened fire. As (Dalpat) Mahnot tried to push away the 

revolver, another youth hit his hands with a bhojali,? said Salma Khatun, 

the cellphone demonstrator.

?One of the men who stood guard in front of the shop 

downed its shutter seconds before his associate pulled the trigger,? she added.

The gang then stepped out of the shop, located near 

National High School for Girls, and got away in a taxi.

Reshmi, who has a five-year-old son, and 62-year-old 

Dalpat were taken to the nearby Ramkrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan, where she 

battled for life for two hours. But the bullet had pierced her liver. She died 

at 4.30 pm. 

?On hearing a hue and cry, I rushed only to see the 

woman lying on the floor. Blood was oozing out from the wound on her abdomen. 

We immediately rushed her and Mahnot to the Ramkrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan,? 

said Bapi Bhaduri, a neighbour.

Reshmi?s husband Vishal was informed and he arrived 

at the hospital soon after. After she died, he went home to his son Yash. The 

family lives at Lake Gardens. When contacted, he said: ?I have no idea why it 

happened and who the attackers were.?

But during the investigation, police found that the 

Mahnots had received extortion calls. ?The Mahnot family had got possession of 

another shop on Lansdowne Road in March. They were supposed to open another cellphone 

outlet in August,? said an officer of the detective department?s homicide wing.

The first extortion call had come a few days ago, 

police said. ?The extortionists were asking for Rs 5 lakh from Vishal. But he 

refused,? said the officer. 

The police believe the extortionists were behind the 

murder. ?Those who witnessed the incident confirmed that the miscreants did not 

ask for money. And before fleeing, they showed no interest in cash and the cellphones 

kept in the showcase,? said another officer of the detective department, arguing 

that robbery could not be the motive.

The police are looking for a criminal, identified 

as Amit, and have detained four persons for questioning.

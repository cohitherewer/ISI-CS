 Hot seat kept warm for Sourav

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav and Rahul 

 Colombo, Aug. 8: Rahul Dravid is set to be a loser even if he leads Team India to victory (we hope he does) in tomorrows IndianOil Cup final against Sri Lanka.

 According to The Telegraphs sources, both here and in India, Sourav Ganguly will get back the captaincy for Zimbabwe. The formal announcement, though, cant be made before Friday when the selectors meet in Mumbai.

 Sourav lost the captaincy wholly because of the ban. As that chapter is over, hes going to get it back. In fact, the selectors had an understanding in Bangalore itself, last month, when Dravid got the tri-series captaincy, a well-placed source said.

 Another insisted any debate on the pros and cons of Sourav and Dravid was, at this point in time, of no relevance. In his opinion, a win will merely strengthen Dravids claims for full-time independent charge.

 But, yes, some are sceptical about Souravs consistency with the bat.

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India was to have emphasised that Dravids appointment was only for the tri-series. It wasnt properly conveyed in Bangalore or else nobody would be speculating on the captaincy.

 Incidentally, Sourav was captain when India won the DMC Cup in Toronto six years ago, but he didnt keep the job once Sachin Tendulkars injury-induced lay off ended.

 Whatever their feelings within, Dravid and Sourav have remained cool. The very private Dravids views arent known, but Sourav told a confidant that wanting the job full-time was a fair call from Dravid.

 Till the recent International Cricket Council-imposed ban, Sourav had been at the helm for over five years. Hes already Indias most successful Test captain.

 To talk of the morrows face-off, Sri Lanka has the advantage of home and form. It won both league matches (in Dambulla) with some degree of comfort.

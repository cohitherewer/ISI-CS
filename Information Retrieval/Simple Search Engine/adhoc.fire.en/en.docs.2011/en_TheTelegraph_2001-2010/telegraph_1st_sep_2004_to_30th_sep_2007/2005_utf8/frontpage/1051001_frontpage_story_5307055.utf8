 Iran buzz in Bush call

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: President George W. Bush gave the Prime Minister a tinkle this evening, setting tongues wagging on whether the call was to thank Manmohan Singh for voting with the US at Vienna.

 The foreign ministry said the leaders reviewed the joint Indo-US statement signed in July, but the timing of the call and the fact that it was initiated by the US side are being seen as significant.

 Much heat and dust was raised last week after India voted against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency meet in Vienna. Many saw a direct link between the vote and the July civilian nuclear deal.

 The foreign ministry statement was brief. There was a phone conversation between the PM and the US President earlier this evening, initiated by the US side.

 The two leaders reviewed the implementation of the July 18 India-US Joint Statement and other bilateral issues and touched on developments in the region.

 The call came on a day the Prime Minister gave the foreign ministry the go-ahead to propose amendments in visa and consular services to Pakistan. Foreign minister Natwar Singh leaves for Islamabad on Sunday.

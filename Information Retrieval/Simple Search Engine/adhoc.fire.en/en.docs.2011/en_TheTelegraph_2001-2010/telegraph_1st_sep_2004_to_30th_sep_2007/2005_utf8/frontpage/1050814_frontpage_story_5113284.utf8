Mumbai, Aug. 13: Two young Manipuri women enjoying an evening out at the Gateway of India today came under a knife attack that killed one of them.

 Lisa John, 25, was strolling on the stone promenade, balloons in hand, when Huzer Patel grabbed her neck from behind and slit her throat, police said. Johns companion, Naga Kuimi, 20, suffered gashes on her palms as she tried to stop the 28-year-old attacker.

 Patel, caught by eyewitnesses and being questioned by Colaba police, seemed mentally unstable and was incoherent, additional commissioner of police (south) S.P. Yadav said. 

 Our records show he also stabbed his father at their home in Jogeshwari at 11 this morning. We have registered a case against him.

 The Gateway of India, site of one of the August 2003 twin blasts, was crowded with tourists watching the sun go down when the knife attack took place around 5.45. Security has been tightened at the tourist spot.

 The officer said John, who died at GT hospital, and Kuimi worked at a five-star hotel. It is not clear if either woman knew Patel.

 Deputy commissioner (zone VII) Amitabh Gupta said Patel had attacked his father after being shouted at for his inability to find a job. He ran away after the crime. The father is grievously hurt and is being treated in hospital.

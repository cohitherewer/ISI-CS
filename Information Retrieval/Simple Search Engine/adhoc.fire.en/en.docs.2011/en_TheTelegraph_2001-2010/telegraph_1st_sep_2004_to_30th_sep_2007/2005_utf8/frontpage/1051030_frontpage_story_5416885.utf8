 Mumbai, Oct. 29: A high alert was flashed in the financial capitals 83 police stations and control rooms minutes after serial explosions rocked New Delhi, targeting Diwali shoppers in the citys crowded markets.

 Mumbai joint commissioner of police (law and order) Arup Patnaik said: At the outset, the Delhi explosions do not look like isolated incidents, but a kind of serial explosions. We have tightened security across the city.

 At the jewellery and wholesale markets in Zaveri Bazaar, Chira Bazaar and Kalbadevi, which are now crowded with Diwali shoppers, vigil has been stepped up. Additional police presence was ordered at the bigger shopping malls, like Orbit in Malad, Crossroads at Tardeo and other places where large numbers of shoppers are likely to congregate.

 Security was also stepped up at key installations like the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, the Bombay High, the airport, the stock exchange, the American consulate and the Siddhivinayak temple, senior police officials said. 

 The anti-terror squad, the Bombay Detection and Disposal Squad and the Rapid Action Force are on alert.

 Mumbai has been a soft target for terror groups and the underworld for over a decade. The city witnessed the countrys worst serial blasts on March 12, 1993, when the underworld triggered 13 explosions that killed 257 people and injured over 700 on a bloody Friday.

 Saif: Stitch in time

 Mumbai, Dec. 10: Saif Ali Khan can be a role model not only for Salman Khan but also his father, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi.

 The Salaam Namaste star took a 13-year-old to hospital on Friday evening after the Land Cruiser he was driving knocked down the boy. Saif later went on his own to police, who arrested him and released him on bail.

 Three years ago, Salmans Land Cruiser ran over a man sleeping on a pavement and injured four, but did not stop. The muscle-bound actor surrendered eight hours after the pre-dawn hit-and-run.

 If Salman fled, Pataudi senior hid.

 Booked under the wildlife act, the former cricket captain and one of the best known faces of royalty in the subcontinent thrice missed police deadlines for showing up. He did finally surrender, but nearly a fortnight after a police check revealed carcasses of a black buck and two rabbits in a vehicle that was accompanying his car.

 Pataudi and the other accused in the case appeared in a Haryana court today. Chief judicial magistrate H.S. Dahiya fixed January 14 for the next hearing. All the accused are on bail.

 At DN Nagar police station last night, an offence under sections of rash and negligent driving was registered against Saif. 

 A medical test was also conducted to find out if he had consumed alcohol beyond the permissible limit for sitting behind the wheel. The police said the report was negative.

 Saif was released on a bail of Rs 5,000 in the night and told to return to DN Nagar police station by Saturday afternoon for completing the legal formalities.

 Deputy commissioner Amitabh Gupta said the accident was minor. The boy has suffered a hairline fracture. He was discharged from the hospital this morning, he said.

 Shakeel Sheikh was crossing the road around 6 in the evening when Saifs Land Cruiser hit him. The actor was on his way back from a rehearsal for a music awards ceremony.

 After taking the boy to the hospital, Saif reached the police station around 9 pm. Once he was granted bail, he reached the music awards venue and performed before an audience that included his two children and the actors companion Rosa.

 I have paid the hospital bills and given Rs 15,000 to the family. I intend to give some more money which could help the family for the next few months, Saif said.

 Shakeel lives in the Janata Colony shanties of Andheri and his mother works as a domestic help. My son wont be able to walk for at least a month and a half. He (Saif) has promised us more money, she said at the police station, but refused to confirm the amount.

 Saif went to DN Nagar police station this evening to complete the paperwork. Earlier, the police had informed the Andheri metropolitan court about last evenings incident after the actor did not turn up till noon. The court fixed December 12 for the hearing.

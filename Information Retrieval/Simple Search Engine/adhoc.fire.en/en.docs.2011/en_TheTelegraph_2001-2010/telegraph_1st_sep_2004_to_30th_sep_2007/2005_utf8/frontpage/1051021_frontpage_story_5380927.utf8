 Wal-Mart

Calcutta, Oct. 20: Conquering Mamata Banerjee, 

with a little help from the rain god, is one thing, but his own party is another.

 A Wal-Mart team met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today, but the chief minister could not embrace the proposal to start a chain of stores from the US supermarket giant because the CPM opposes foreign investment in retail.

 Theyre willing to invest here, said an official present at the meeting.

 Well consider their proposal, but this is bound to take time, the chief minister said.

 This is bound to take time would normally mean expectation of a change of mind by the party sometime in the future.

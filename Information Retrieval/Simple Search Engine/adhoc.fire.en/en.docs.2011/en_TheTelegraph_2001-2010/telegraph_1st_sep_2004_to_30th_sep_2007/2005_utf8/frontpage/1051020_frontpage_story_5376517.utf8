Calcutta, Oct. 19: Heavy rain lashed Calcutta and some other parts of Bengal this evening with the Met office predicting more showers tomorrow.

 It issued a warning of heavy to very heavy rain in the city and the districts in Gangetic Bengal in the next 48 hours. 

 Calcutta received 112 mm rain till 8.30 am today. The weather conditions may deteriorate further during the next 24 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore.

 Debnath said low pressure had formed over southwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal off the Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh coast. Under its influence, there has been heavy incursion of moisture leading to development of a series of thunderclouds over Gangetic Bengal. So, we expect rainfall at many places for the next couple of days, he added.

 Met officials said columns of thunderclouds seven to eight km tall had formed over Calcutta from this afternoon and the sky began to darken from 4 pm, with heavy rain starting in about two hours. 

 Yesterday, a trough of low pressure lay over sub-Himalayan Bengal to southwest Bay of Bengal. Today, it shifted towards the east and weakened.

 Pawar out of BCCI committee 

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 14: Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar has quit the marketing committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India two days before it is to open bids for television rights.

 The decision triggered speculation about the truce with the Jagmohan Dalmiya faction falling apart as Pawar agreeing to become a member of the committee was thought to be a part of the deal worked out at the Calcutta annual general meeting last month to avoid further bitterness over the presidents election.

 In a letter to the board, Pawar said: I am grateful to the BCCI for nominating me in the marketing committee. But due to my official position (as minister) I wont be able to devote time to the committee. However, I will be happy to lend my support to the board, if needed.

 There was, however, no confirmation of rumours that another committee member ? and Pawar camp follower ? N. Srinivasan had quit.

 Pawar was set to contest the election for president against Dalmiya acolyte Ranbir Singh Mahendra, but after tit-for-tat suits in the court a compromise was reached.

 As a minister, Pawar could face conflict of interest because award of telecast rights involves a financial dealing.

 Trade bandh

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, March 21: A traders? lobby today called a three-day bandh in and outside Calcutta from March 30 in protest against the introduction of value-added tax from April 1.

 ?Bengal is a major importing or consuming state and it is going to be hit hard by VAT,? said the Federation of West Bengal Trade Associations, which called the bandh. 

 Mahesh Singhania, a spokesman, asked the government to defer VAT because some leading exporting states had decided not to implement it from April 1.

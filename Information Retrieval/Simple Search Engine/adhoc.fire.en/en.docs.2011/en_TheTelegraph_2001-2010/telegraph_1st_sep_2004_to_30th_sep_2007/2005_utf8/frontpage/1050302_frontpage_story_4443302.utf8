 Petrol price up from April 1

 New Delhi, March 1 (PTI): Petrol and diesel prices will go up by 50 paise a litre from April 1 because of the hike in the cess for road development from Rs 1.50 to Rs 2.

 Although the increase in cess will be passed on to consumers, oil companies are likely to bear the burden of the excise duty hike on the fuels. ?The additional cess would garner Rs 250 crore per month for the government,? an oil ministry official said.

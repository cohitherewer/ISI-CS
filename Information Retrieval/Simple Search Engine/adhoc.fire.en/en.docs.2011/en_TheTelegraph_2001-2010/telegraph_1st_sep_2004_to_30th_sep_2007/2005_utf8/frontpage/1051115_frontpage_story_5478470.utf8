The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Suri bid highest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: Lalit Suris Bharat Hotels has turned out to be the highest bidder for Great Eastern Hotel, sources said.

 The three financial bids for the hotel were opened today ? the two others are from Ramuk Scan AB and the Unitech Group.

 Although no official confirmation is available yet, Delhi-based Suri should bag Great Eastern after years of effort by the Left Front government to sell the hotel. 

 After the bids are evaluated and 

 the highest quote chosen, the cabinet has to endorse the 

 selection. It will be premature to declare the winner until 

 then.

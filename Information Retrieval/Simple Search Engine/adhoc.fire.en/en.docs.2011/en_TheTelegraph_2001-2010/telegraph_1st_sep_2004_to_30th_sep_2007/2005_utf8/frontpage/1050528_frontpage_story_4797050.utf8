 Gun salute to Advani Pak trip 

 - Delhi, Islamabad keen 

to make visit a success

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, May 27: The 

 man accused of scuttling the Agra summit is set to receive 

 a red-carpet welcome in Pakistan.

 L.K. Advanis second visit to the country of his birth, which starts on May 30, has acquired the trappings of a state visit. 

 The leader of the Opposition, who will be accompanied by a huge media team on the tour, today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for 20 minutes to be briefed on the peace process.

 The duo deliberated on the BJP leaders Pakistan agenda, which includes meetings with President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, Advani told reporters.

 For many years as the No. 2 in the BJP government, Advani had had little say in foreign policy, which was seen as Atal Bihari Vajpayees domain while internal security was his. The BJP had arranged things so that the two would not step on each others toes.

 But during Musharrafs visit to India for the Agra peace talks, Advani ? as home minister ? showed that his views also counted. 

 Since then, the Indian and Pakistani establishments have grudgingly acknowledged that a consensus on Kashmir and other issues impinging on Indo-Pak relations cannot exclude the standpoint of the BJP and, by implication, that of Advani, who is now party president.

 It is learnt that Islamabad is prepared to let bygones be bygones and make Advanis trip a success. 

 Post-Agra, Musharraf as well as others in the Pakistan establishment had insinuated that Advani had scuttled the emergence of a joint treaty. 

 There was no categorical rejection from the BJP. The episode strengthened Advanis image as a hardliner on Pakistan.

 BJP sources said Advani now wants to repair that image. He has apparently realised that hawkish politics on Ayodhya, Muslims and Pakistan would take neither him nor the BJP far in global politics, which has begun placing a huge premium on conflict resolution.

 After his meeting with Singh, Advani said he considered his trip an important link in the peace process begun by Vajpayee. 

 He was briefed by external affairs ministry officials. Sources said the Centre would not allow politics to come in the way of Advanis visit and was keen to see it go off without glitches. 

 The BJPs support, they said, was crucial at a time when the government was prepared to make minor concessions to the Hurriyat Conference.

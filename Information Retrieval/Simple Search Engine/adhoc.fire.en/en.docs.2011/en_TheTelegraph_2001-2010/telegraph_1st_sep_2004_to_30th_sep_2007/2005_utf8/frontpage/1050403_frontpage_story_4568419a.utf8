Vatican City, April 2 (Reuters): 

 Pope John Paul II died on Saturday, the Vatican announced.

 The 84-year-old Pontiff, who had 

 headed the Roman Catholic Church for 26 years, died at 9.37 

 p.m (1937 GMT), a statement said.

 quot;The Holy Father died this 

 evening at 21.37 in his private apartment, quot; the statement 

 said.

 The news was immediately announced to huge crowds gathered 

 in St Peter's Square.

 John Paul will be remembered for his role in the collapse 

 of communism in Europe and his unyielding defence of traditional 

 Vatican doctrines as leader of the world's 1.1 billion Catholics.

 Huge crowds had staged a tearful 

 vigil in St. Peter's Square, praying for a man already being 

 dubbed by some Catholics as quot;John Paul the Great quot;.

 The Pope's health had deteriorated 

 steadily over the past decade and earlier this year took 

 a sharp turn for the worse.

 The Pontiff, once a lithe athlete 

 and powerful speaker, was already racked by arthritis and 

 Parkinson's Disease, his voice often reduced to a raspy 

 whisper.

 He was rushed to hospital twice 

 in February and had to have a tracheotomy to ease serious 

 breathing problems. But he never regained his strength from 

 the operation and failed dramatically on two occasions to 

 address crowds at St. Peter's Square.

 On Wednesday doctors inserted 

 a feeding tube into his stomach to try boost his energy 

 levels. A day later he developed a urinary infection and 

 high fever that soon precipitated heart failure, kidney 

 problems and ultimately death.

 According to pre-written Church 

 rules, the Pontiff's mourning rites will last 9 days and 

 his body is likely to be laid to rest in the crypt underneath 

 St Peter's Basilica. 

 The conclave to elect a new Pope 

 will start in 15 to 20 days, with almost 120 cardinals from 

 around the world gathering in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel 

 to choose a successor.

 There is no favourite candidate to take over. Karol Wojtyla 

 was himself regarded as an outsider when he was elevated 

 to the papacy on Oct. 16, 1978.

 Few would have predicted then 

 that the first non-Italian Pope in 455 years would throw 

 off the stiff trappings of the papacy, travel the globe 

 and leave an indelible mark on history.

 In over a quarter century on the 

 world stage, he was both a champion of the downtrodden and 

 an often contested defender of orthodoxy within his own 

 church.

 Historians say one of the Pope's most lasting legacies will 

 be his role in the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 

 1989.

 quot;Behold the night is over, 

 day has dawned anew, quot; the Pope said during a triumphant 

 visit to Czechoslovakia in 1990.

 A decade after witnessing the 

 fall of communism, he fulfilled another of his dreams. He 

 visited the Holy Land in March 2000, and, praying at Jerusalem's 

 Western Wall, asked forgiveness for Catholic sins against 

 Jews over the centuries.

 But while many loved the man, 

 his message was less popular and he was a source of deep 

 division in his own church.

 Critics constantly attacked his 

 traditionalist stance on family issues, such as his condemnation 

 of contraception and homosexuality, and hope the next Pope 

 will be more liberal.

 However, he has appointed more 

 than 95 percent of the cardinals who will elect his successor, 

 thus stacking the odds that his controversial teachings 

 will not be tampered with.

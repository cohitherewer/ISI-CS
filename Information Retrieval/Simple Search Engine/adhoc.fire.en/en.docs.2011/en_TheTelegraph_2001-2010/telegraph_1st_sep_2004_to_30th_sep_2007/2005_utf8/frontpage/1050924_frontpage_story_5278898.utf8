 Greg keeps up charge

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 Calcutta/Harare, Sept. 23: A committee of the cricket board will discuss Greg Chappells comments against captain Sourav Ganguly in an e-mail as the coach dropped enough hints today that he was in no mood to let up.

 Ranbir Singh Mahendra, the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, said: I have received an e-mail from Greg Chappell. Its private and confidential. Whatever Ive to say I will tell the concerned committee of the board.

 In the mail to Mahendra, Chappell is reported to have described Sourav as physically and mentally unfit to be the captain.

 Speaking to PTI in Harare, Chappell made it clear that he was not about to ease the pressure on the captain, though he did not name Sourav. There are some things which are non-negotiable. Fielding and fitness are two of them. Unfortunately, players would not find it any easier. 

 Guys who are buying into it are going ahead and those who are not buying into it will find themselves by the wayside, he added.

 In the background of his calling Sourav unfit, its not difficult to figure out who he had in mind. There is also the recent history of his asking Sourav to step aside before the first Test in Zimbabwe.

 Chappells complaint along with Gangulys side of the story would be discussed at the (committees) meeting in Mumbai on September 27, BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said.

 The committee has former skippers Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri and Srinivas Venkatraghavan as members. 

 Sourav could not be reached for comment. A report said the team would arrive in Mumbai early tomorrow morning from Zimbabwe. Chappell returns on Sunday. 

 His mail, followed by the comments today, has torn apart the patch-up show before the second Test in Zimbabwe.

 Any discussion on selection from this point has to have in mind the 2007 World Cup, he said. It will take time to develop a team and I suppose a decision has to be taken on which of the senior players are most likely to last and be potent enough that long.

 We need to very carefully think about the balance of the side both in one-day cricket and Test cricket. The administrators, selectors, the coaching staff and myself will have some decisions to make soon.

 Former BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya was asked if he thought it was right for Sourav to continue as captain since he was his mentor. Why only Sourav? I have always lent a helping hand to all players, Dalmiya shot back.

 Salman takes voice test

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 17: Mumbai police today questioned Salman Khan and recorded his voice three days after the purported phone conversation between him and Aishwarya Rai was reported in the media.

 The police are likely to summon Rai, too, for questioning and collect her voice sample.

 Transcripts and audio clips of the conversation ? apparently tapped by the police and reported by the media ?show a man addressed as Salman Khan abusing and threatening a woman he refers to as Ash.

 To shield Salman from the media, which has been camping at the Crawford Market police headquarters, the police summoned him to the crime intelligence unit of the crime branch at Andheri today. 

 Officers refused to give any details of the three-hour grilling, but Khans lawyer Dipesh Mehta said, Salman completely cooperated with the police during the interrogation and gave his voice sample.

 The sample will be matched with the tapes played on television. The police have two days to tell deputy chief minister R.R. Patil, who holds the home portfolio, if the tape is genuine. Patil is likely to make a statement in the Assembly on July 20.

 Police sources revealed that the crime branch has tapes of Salmans conversations with various female actors, but none of any between him and the underworld dons mentioned in the controversial tape.

 The man in the tape says he works as pointsman for Dawood Ibrahim and knows Chhota Shakeel, Chhota Rajan, Guru Satam and Abu Salem. 

 He claims he had full information about every one of the bomb blasts, which some have linked to the March 12, 1993, serial explosions.

 The sources, however, refused to confirm if the tapping had been illegal.

 Under the law, a proposal to tap a mobile or landline phone must come from a deputy commissioner and be cleared by the joint commissioner, the police commissioner and the home department. 

 Officers can be punished for unauthorised tapping.

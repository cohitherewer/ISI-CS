 All plus-2 results by June 10

 - SC order to enforce 

discipline, nationwide

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Supreme Court today ordered all states and Union territories to declare 10+2 examination results by June 10 every year so that entrance tests for medical and other professional courses can be held on time.

 A bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal, D.M. Dharmadhikari and Tarun Chatterjee set June 15 as the deadline for bringing out marksheets and said heads of education boards would be personally liable if the directive is not followed. However, Bengal ? where plus-2 results were published on July 27 last year ? was exempted from following the deadline this year.

 The omnibus order laid down 15 guidelines to streamline admissions to medical colleges.

 The court said results of medical and dental entrance tests for the current academic year should be declared before June 15. The admission process, including counselling, should be over by July 25 and the correct vacancy position intimated by the chief secretary to the directorate general of health services by July 26. The head of the institution or the head of the health department of the state should also verify the vacancy position in each medical/dental college.

 By October 31, the states, through chief secretaries and health secretaries, would have to file a report on admissions to the DGHS with details about the adherence to the time schedule and admission granted according to the prescribed quotas, including those of the management, the state and the all-India quota. ?The recalcitrant states, particularly officers personally, will have to face the consequences for violation,? the order stressed.

 By January 31, 2005, a report on feasibility of conducting counselling through videoconferencing will have to be filed, the court said. It gave the DGHS three months to file a report on the ?aspect? of increasing the all-India quota ?from 15 to 20 per cent?.

 The court said if any private college exceeded its management quota in an academic year, its quota shall stand reduced for the next year.

 The judges ruled against ?mid-stream admissions?, admissions in excess of the total seats or carrying forward unfilled seats to the next academic year.

 The guidelines came on a petition that protested against the delay in conducting counselling by state governments which resulted in 15 per cent of all-India quota seats lapsing to the states? kitty almost every year.

 The court posted the matter for further hearing in the third week of January.

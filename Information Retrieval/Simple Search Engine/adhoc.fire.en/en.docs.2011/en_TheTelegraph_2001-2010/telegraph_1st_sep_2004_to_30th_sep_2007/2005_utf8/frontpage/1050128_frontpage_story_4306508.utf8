Heart satisfied, Left worries about soul

MONOBINA GUPTA 

New Delhi, Jan. 27: The government today sought 

to give a human face to the much-maligned divestment process, but the Left could 

not decide whether it liked the face.

Beginning April, the proceeds from divestment will 

go to a fund whose returns will finance social schemes in education, health and 

employment. 

The fund is part of the promises made in the common 

minimum programme (CMP). It also addresses a concern expressed by the Congress 

when it was in Opposition that the then BJP government was using the proceeds 

from divestment to reduce the fiscal deficit and paint a rosy economic picture 

to gain political mileage.

The noble objective and the political backdrop should 

have made the fund close to the Left?s heart.

It has. But the source of the money for the fund ? 

divestment ? is something that the Left has yet to digest.

In an ironical twist ? coincidental or otherwise ? 

the fund was announced on a day the government also decided to defer divestment 

in two big-ticket companies: Maruti Udyog Ltd and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd 

(Bhel). 

The cabinet decided to postpone a decision apparently 

under pressure from the Left, though CPI leader A.B. Bardhan said he could not 

recall having discussed Bhel with finance minister P. Chidambaram.

But CPM leader Prakash Karat had said that the divestment 

proposal was against the spirit of the CMP and would be ?strongly? opposed.

The Left leaders are now in a dilemma because without 

divestments in profit-making companies ? which they are opposed to ? there is 

little chance of the social fund drawing the huge amounts needed to bankroll the 

welfare projects.

The Left?s official stand is the fund should be filled 

with proceeds from the sale of sick PSUs ? considered unrealistic by many because 

such bankrupt companies cannot be expected to fetch high prices.

Left leaders said they do want the fund. ?But that 

does not justify the divestment of profit-making PSUs,? Bardhan said. ?The government 

can start the national investment fund by contributing to it from the sale of 

bankrupt PSUs.?

The Left will take up the matter at its pre-budget 

meeting with Chidambaram on February 1.

The CMP is not very specific on the issue. ?The UPA 

government believes there has to be a direct link between privatisation and social 

needs ? like using privatisation revenues for designated social sector schemes,? 

it says.

Chidambaram, however, feels that the government is 

adhering to the CMP. 

The finance minister insisted that the government 

is not violating a clause which says ?generally profit-making companies will not 

be privatised? because it will retain ownership control even after divesting 49 

per cent of shares.

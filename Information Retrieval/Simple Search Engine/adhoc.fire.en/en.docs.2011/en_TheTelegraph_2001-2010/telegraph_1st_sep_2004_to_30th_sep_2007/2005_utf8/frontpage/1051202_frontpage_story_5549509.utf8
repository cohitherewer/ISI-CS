 Chennai, Dec.1: Captain or not, every Sourav Ganguly move is being watched. 

 If anything, this constant scrutiny has added to the pressures associated with making a Team India comeback. No wonder, Sourav (overlooked in the last two ODI series) has a spare me, please look.

 He has been sporting that for the past two days.

 There was no change even after coach Greg Chappell broke his silence and declared, at a media conference ahead of the first Test against Sri Lanka, that Sourav had fitted well into the group and that the past couple of days had been good.

 The new Board of Control for Cricket in India president, Sharad Pawar, also had confidence-lifting words: Sourav has been one of our finest allrounders and a very good captain... Everybody has ups and downs, but the quality of a player doesnt diminish.

 Souravs biggest test since his first comeback (summer of 1996) will, of course, begin tomorrow. 

 Neither captain Rahul Dravid nor Chappell announced the XI, but The Telegraphs sources have revealed Sourav is playing.

 He had a century in his second 

 last Test innings (Bulawayo) and posted a fine 159 (Bengal 

 versus Maharashtra) in his last first-class outing ? less 

 than a week ago. Strong credentials, then, to retain his 

 Test berth.

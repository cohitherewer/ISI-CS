 Buck blow to Salman

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 Dec. 12: A Jodhpur court today issued a non-bailable warrant against actor Salman Khan in the black buck poaching cases after rejecting his plea for exemption from personal appearance because of ill health.

 However, actor Satish Shah, also accused in the case, appeared in the court, the counsel for the actors said over phone from Jodhpur. 

 The prosecution objected to Salmans repeated appeals for exemption, he said. 

 The hearing in the cases was adjourned till January 12.

 The forest department filed two cases of black buck poaching against the actors on October 11, 1998.

 Saif bail gets nod

 A metropolitan court in Mumbai today endorsed the bail granted by Mumbai police to actor Saif Ali Khan in a road accident case.

 Saif, who appeared in court, was also asked to furnish a surety of Rs 5,000 within a month. 

 The actor was at the head of his Land Cruiser SUV on Friday evening when the vehicle hit 13-year-old Shakil Sheikh in Andheri. The boy suffered a fracture. Saif took him to hospital and has promised the boys family that he would bear all medical expenses.

 Later, he reported the matter to the police, who arrested him and released him on bail.

 Fine for Sridevi case

 Madras High Court today quashed proceedings on a civil suit by one V. Ramakrishna Goud, who claimed that actor Sridevi was his wife. The court also directed him to pay Rs 1 lakh as cost to the Tamil Nadu Legal Services within three months. 

 Allowing the actors petition against a family courts order directing her to appear before it, the court observed that Goud, from Andhra Pradesh, had a habit of filing false cases against film and political personalities. In her petition, Sridevi said Gouds previous record showed he had filed similar cases against Priyanka Gandhi and Jaya Prada solely with the intention to gain cheap publicity.

 - Dravid Test captain, Sourav prepares for hard work

 Calcutta, Nov. 22: Rahul Dravid was preparing to head for the masseurs table at the Chepauk, in Chennai this afternoon, when the national selectors anointed him the Test captain as well.

 Hundreds of miles away, in Pune, Sourav Ganguly was readying to leave for nets with the Bengal squad when he learnt of his ouster.

 Apparently, from the TV.

 Quite remarkably, the contrast reflected exactly where they stand: Dravid can relax just a wee bit; Sourav needs to work harder than ever before.

 That Dravid would get the Test captaincy (for the series versus Sri Lanka), too, became more or less clear last month itself when the selectors placed him at the helm for back-to-back ODI engagements against Lanka and the ongoing series versus South Africa.

 That break with tradition was a signal and it coincided with Jagmohan Dalmiya being under choking pressure in intra-Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) politics.

 The selectors wouldnt have given Sourav the hot-potato treatment had Dalmiya still been on a strong wicket.

 According to The Telegraphs sources, the Test captaincy was put to vote and Easts Pranab Roy found himself isolated as the other selectors ?chairman Kiran More, Yashpal Sharma, Gopal Sharma and V.B.Chandrasekhar ? supported Dravid.

 The meeting at the Taj Coromandal didnt take much longer than half-an-hour.

 Those opposed to Sourav gave no weightage to his being Indias most successful Test captain. Absolutely no weightage was also given to the series win in Zimbabwe ? Souravs last assignment.

 If you dont win against teams like Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, then you shouldnt be playing, is what More told the media.

 He added: Were not happy with Souravs performance over the past couple of years. Rahul, on the other hand, has been performing consistently.

 Dravids consistency is definitely worthy of envy, yet in the past couple of years Sourav has only had one poor Test series --- versus Pakistan, at the end of last season.

 More, obviously, didnt do his homework.

 He did emphasise that Souravs spat with Greg Chappell didnt have a bearing, but the coach is bound to have conveyed his thoughts to him.

 Thanks to an e-mail which got leaked, its no secret that Chappell has strong reservations about Souravs presence in the dressing room.

 Chappell and More have reached a perfect understanding.

 Actually, the Sourav-Chappell truce --- brokered by the BCCI on September 27 --- isnt going to be put to test as one is now sans authority.

 As of late tonight, Sourav will figure in the squad for the first Test against Lanka (to be picked tomorrow), but being an ordinary player isnt the same as being the captain.

 Sourav declined to comment on his removal --- Right now, Im just looking forward to the Ranji match versus Maharashtra --- and Dravid didnt say much either.

 Chased by the media after the third ODI got abandoned without a ball being bowled, he merely said (at the team hotel and not the Chepauk): Im happy? Excited? Honoured?

 Sourav indicated he would either call Dravid or congratulate him via an SMS.

 He has already gone on record saying talk of his possibly having misgivings about playing under Dravid was without basis.

 Dravid has handled the Harbhajan Singhs superbly. However, a bigger man management role awaits him.

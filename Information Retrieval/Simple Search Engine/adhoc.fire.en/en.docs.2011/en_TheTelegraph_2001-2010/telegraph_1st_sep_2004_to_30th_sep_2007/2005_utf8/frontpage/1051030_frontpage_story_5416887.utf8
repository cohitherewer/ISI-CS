 Singh snips Calcutta trip

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Singh: Deeply distressed

 Calcutta, Oct. 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who landed in the city around 7.15 this evening, flew back to Delhi two-and-a-half hours later, shocked and deeply distressed. 

 No terrorist can win against India. India will win this battle against terrorism, Singh was quoted as saying. He urged the people to maintain calm.

 The target is clearly the innocent citizens. Efforts to spread chaos and disturb peace will not be allowed to succeed at any cost, he said.

 The Prime Ministers Sunday schedule in Calcutta has been cancelled. He was to unveil a statue of Swami Vivekananda at Gol Park, inaugurate a Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture annexe and deliver a speech there tomorrow morning. Later, he was to lay the foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research on the Salt Lake campus of the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics. 

 At Raj Bhavan, Singh had a brief meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who was at the airport earlier to receive him along with governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, and a state Congress delegation.

 After a quick dinner, he flew back at 9.45 pm. Human resource development minister Arjun Singh, who arrived today for the Indian Institute of Science programme, also left with the Prime Minister.

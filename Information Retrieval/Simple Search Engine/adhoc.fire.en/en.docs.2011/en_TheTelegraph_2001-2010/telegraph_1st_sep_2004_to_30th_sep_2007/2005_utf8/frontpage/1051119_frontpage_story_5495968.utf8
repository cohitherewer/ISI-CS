 US rejects 

extradition

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Nov. 18: The US department of justice has turned down Indias request to extradite Abu Salems first wife, Samira Jumani, on grounds of insufficient evidence of any crime by her.

 New Delhi is said to be gathering fresh evidence which could implicate her following the extradition of Salem to India, sources here said.

 Indian authorities approached the US state department in April last year seeking the womans extradition, charging her with conspiracy, cheating, forgery, use of forged documents and violation of the Passport Act.

 Details of a non-bailable warrant issued against her in Lucknow in December 1999 were also furnished to the US authorities, pointing out that she had absconded, as a result of which the warrant could not be executed.

 The Interpol issued a red corner notice against her in 2000.

 The state department referred Indias request to the department of justice, which examined the case in detail, but concluded that there was insufficient evidence of any crime by her.

 They asked India to produce more evidence, which New Delhi was unable to do. After waiting in vain for a response, the justice department here has now closed the file.

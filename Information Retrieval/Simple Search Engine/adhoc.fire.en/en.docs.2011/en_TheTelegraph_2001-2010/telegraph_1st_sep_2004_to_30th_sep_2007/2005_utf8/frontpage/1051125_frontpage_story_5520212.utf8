 CM appeal

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday appealed to the people of Calcutta to maintain peace on and off the field during the match at Eden Gardens. 

 Please uphold the shanti (peace), srinkhala (discipline) and aitijhya (tradition) of our state. Do not do anything that tarnishes the image of Bengal, he said.

 A keen Sourav Ganguly fan, the chief minister added that he would send his congratulatory message to the former India captain soon for his inclusion in the Test team.

 After Sourav got dropped from the one-day team, Bhattacharjee had said his comeback was inevitable.

 Often seen at the Eden during international matches, he refused to say if he would watch Fridays game. Asked what he had decided, the chief minister quoted Browning: Who knows but the world may end tonight.

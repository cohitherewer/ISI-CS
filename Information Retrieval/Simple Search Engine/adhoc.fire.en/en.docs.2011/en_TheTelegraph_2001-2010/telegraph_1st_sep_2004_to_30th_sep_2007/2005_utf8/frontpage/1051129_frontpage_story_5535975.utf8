 Board battle too close to call

Last-minute lift for Dalmiya camp

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 After being subjected to jeers in Calcutta, 

Rahul Dravid applauds the crowd in Mumbai where India won the last one-dayer. 

Dravids unbeaten 78 fetched him the Man of the Match award. At the presentation 

ceremony, provoked by Ravi Shastri who asked the captain, What do you have 

to say about the Mumbai crowd?, Dravid replied, Thank you, you have 

been the stars.(Reuters picture) 

Calcutta, Nov. 28: Instead of taking a special 

flight after the Mumbai one-dayer, Board of Control for Cricket in India presidential 

aspirant Sharad Pawar left for Calcutta during the break ? an acknowledgement 

that the elections will be a lot closer than expected.

 The elections are tomorrow, once the AGM is reconvened.

 Besides support from the Congress, the Pawar camp was banking on Supreme Court-appointed observer T.S. Krishnamurthy to debar Jagmohan Dalmiya supporters from representing Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, National Cricket Club and Uttar Pradesh. As also taking away the presidents vote as chairman of the AGM.

 The former chief election commissioner, though, only upheld objections against Himachal. His rulings, most significant being that president Ranbir Singh Mahendra would continue to have two votes (as chairman and the casting one), promptly lifted the Dalmiya groups morale.

 Simultaneously, it made the Pawar camp realise nothing could be taken for granted. Late tonight, there was talk that Krishnamurthy may reopen the Himachal issue as all documents ? including a stay order obtained by Dalmiya backer Anurag Mathur ? probably werent placed before him. 

 Should a fresh ruling favour Mathur (and not Rajendra Zar), the amended voters list is then going to have a 15-14 look in Pawars favour. With two floating votes, absolutely anything can happen.

Few, by the way, have forgotten that Dalmiyas casting vote stopped Pawar last year. 

 This has become Dalmiyas biggest fight ever. He began on the backfoot, but has recovered much ground. His group hasnt lost yet, a source, who has closely watched developments, said. 

 Pawar, who reached his camps hotel after 10 pm, asked the media to wait for 24 hours. Publicly, at least, he didnt give anything away to suggest Krishnamurthys rulings had upset him.

 Earlier, both Dalmiya and Inderjit Singh Bindra (the very public face of Pawars campaign) expressed confidence, but both cant be winners. Bindra, of course, was once Dalmiyas closest ally but much water has flowed between Chandigarh and Calcutta in the last eight years.

 Whatever the posturing within the region, Pawar has breached the East: Assam has been won over, thanks to his Congress connections. Andhra, too, may go the powerful Union ministers way.

 The Dalmiya group, however, has thwarted attempts to wean away Gujarat (headed by Congressman Narhari Amin) and Services. Apparently, a commitment has been received from Orissa.

 Incidentally, with everybody focused on Krishnamurthys rulings, word came that Pondicherry ? which is part of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association ? had moved the Supreme Court. The grounds couldnt be confirmed, but the apex court is unlikely to interfere till the election process has been completed.

 Asked if the results would be declared by the evening, Krishnamurthy said hopefully. He has been ducking the media (please understand my predicament), but promised to speak once the AGMs real business gets over.

 Meanwhile, the nominations have been on expected lines (Dalmiya group first): Mahendra versus Pawar; Goutam Das Gupta against Niranjan Shah (secretarys post); Brijesh Patel versus Mohinder Pandove (joint-secretary) and Jyoti Bajpai against N. Srinivasan (treasurer).

 Many fingers will be kept crossed overnight.

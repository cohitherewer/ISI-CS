 Sourav a call away from Colombo

 - Ban scaled down; Dravid says Gangulys very welcome to join team

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Back in the reckoning: Sourav Ganguly

Colombo, July 28: It was a formality, but the International Cricket Council (ICC) has accepted arbiter Justice Albie Sachss recommendation that former Team India captain Sourav Gangulys six-ODI ban be reduced by one-third.

 Its a landmark award ? middle path, most would say ? for never before has such punishment reached arbitration.

 However, Justice Sachs upheld the process which saw Sourav banned after the Ahmedabad ODI against Pakistan. He was made to pay for the bowlers being three overs short.

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had challenged the process adopted by match referee Chris Broad and commissioner Michael Beloff, who rejected Souravs appeal.

 As the former captain has already missed two ODIs, hes eligible for the second half of the season-launching tri-series. 

 The tournament begins in Dambulla on Saturday.

 Given that ICC president Ehsan Mani has conveyed the acceptance through a media statement tonight, the BCCI is expected to quickly finalise Souravs travel plans.

 He is the provisional 16th member.

 Late tonight, there was talk Sourav could arrive on August 1, ahead of the third league match ? versus Sri Lanka, on August 3.

 Dambulla is hosting the first three matches, with Colombo staging the last.

 Despite the excellent news, Sourav didnt go overboard when reached for a comment in Calcutta.

 I havent yet heard anything from the BCCI... But, yes, returning to international cricket will be nice... Beyond that, right now, I have nothing to say, he maintained.

 Incidentally, this Sourav development was conveyed to Rahul Dravid by The Telegraph. Speaking from Dambulla, he said: Im happy for Sourav... I dont know when hes coming, but hes very welcome to join the team.

 Coach Greg Chappells response, too, was as enthusiastic as the captains.

 Justice Sachs has shown Solomons wisdom... The award comes as a bonus as we didnt have Sourav in our plans... Now, we have his experience to look forward to... Its a positive development on many fronts, he observed.

 Significantly, during a tele-conference from London, Justice Sachs held that too much weightage was given to Sourav having been warned about the slow over-rate in the previous ODI (Jamshedpur).

 A captain remains responsible... In this case, the small shortfall and the question of whether the captain actually acted deliberately wasnt given much weightage... Thats why I recommended a reduction... he pointed out.

 In Justice Sachss view, the principles applied needed refinement and changes to the ICCs Code of Conduct have been suggested.

 He signed off hoping the ICC and the BCCI would work together without being affected by what obviously became a terribly contentious issue.

 Sangh salt in BJP wound 

 June 12: The RSS kept the Jinnah pot boiling by questioning L.K. Advanis decision to withdraw his resignation and attacking the BJP for allowing him to do so.

 The BJP leadership should have accepted his resignation. But they? rejected his papers. This clearly showed that whatever views Advani has expressed in Pakistan, the BJP leaders are in total agreement with him, RSS leader M.G. Vaidya, considered close to K.S. Sudarshan and Murli Manohar Joshi, wrote in a Marathi daily.

 Criticising Advani for withdrawing 

 his resignation, he said: It was not expected from 

 Advani since he is a matured party activist and sticks to 

 his words.

 Railway fee hike planned

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 14: The cost of food served at railway stations and parking fees could go up in the next two months.

 Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav has ordered an increase in licence fees of permanent catering units, vehicle parking stands and public call booths at railway stations. 

 The Left has opposed the plan, fearing that the hike would be passed on to consumers. 

 If Laloo Prasad pushes through the proposal, the licence fees are expected to go up by five to six times at major stations. Catering units at big stations now pay a licence fee of Rs 730 a year while parking lots pay Rs 1 to 3 crore for two to three years.

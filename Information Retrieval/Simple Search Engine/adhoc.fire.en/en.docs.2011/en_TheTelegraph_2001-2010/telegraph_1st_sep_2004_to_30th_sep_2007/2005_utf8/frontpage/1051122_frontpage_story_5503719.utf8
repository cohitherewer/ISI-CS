 Yearning for yesterday once more

Tongue Twister

 From a start in the rocking 60s to 

 the current expanse of BBs the third-generation 

 Puris sure know how to pamper the Calcutta palate just right, 

 feels musician and foodie Nondon Bagchi

 Anand Puri samples 

 the fare at BBs in Salt Lake; a band in performance

 In 1959, Mr Ellis Joshua and Mr 

 Om Prakash Puri became business partners when they bought 

 a property by the name of Trincas on Park Street. They were 

 familiar with the hospitality industry having met up while 

 working for the Oberois and through the 60s mid into 

 the early 70s when Park Street was in its prime, Trincas 

 was arguably the most happening place on this incredible 

 thoroughfare, setting enviable standards of entertainment 

 and becoming a Mecca for musicians from all over the country. 

 Apart from music there was cabaret, 

 ventriloquism and comedy. There were magicians and fire 

 eaters and one guy who actually ate stuff like ball bearings, 

 car tyres, glass bulbs and other nutritious substances right 

 there on stage while people wined and dined in an ambience 

 that was elegant and cultured. 

 Sunday afternoons were for the 

 teen brigade. From 4 pm to 7 pm, there was just about enough 

 room to breathe. The music of The Beatles, The Monkees, 

 Dave Clark Five, The Swinging Blue Jeans, Sam the Sham, 

 Hermans Hermits, The 1910 Fruitgum Company and many 

 others was our staple diet and the band that had the longest 

 and most successful run during these jam sessions 

 or Gaylords sessions as they were called 

 was the Flinstones. 

 Several people who performed in 

 Trincas in those days went on to win national and international 

 acclaim and the names of Usha Uthup (then Iyer) and Biddu 

 Appaya come most readily to mind. Biddu came with a band 

 called The Trojans and later returned to Trincas as a solo 

 performer calling himself the Lone Trojan. He made headlines 

 when he produced the worldwide hit by Carl Douglas called 

 Kung-fu Fighting, and in late the 70s came again 

 to Trincas when a documentary film on him was being shot.

 When nightlife on Park Street 

 ? entertainment wise ? came to a virtual standstill, Trincas 

 was the only place that never stopped playing live music. 

 Not for a single day. Things are picking up again and although 

 the magic of the 60s cannot be recaptured, one never knows 

 what the future holds. 

 In terms of food, we were too 

 busy soaking up the atmosphere to remember much, but their 

 sizzlers were a trademark, as was a seriously fiery dish 

 called Chimoo Aunty Curry and Rice, which I think was a 

 lunchtime special. 

 Forty-six years down the line 

 the grandson of Mr Om Prakash Puri, Anand Puri, has set 

 up a place in Salt Lake called BBs. Like many restaurants 

 in our part of the world, BBs offers different styles 

 of cuisine, but is unique because of the combination they 

 have chosen. North Indian, Oriental, Italian and South Indian 

 has to be a first for the city. 

 Situated on the ground floor of 

 the Millennium City Building, DN 52 Sector V Salt Lake, 

 BBs is a well and practically designed place with 

 interesting posters on the walls, a glass-fronted kitchen 

 where guests can see the Italian, South Indian and North 

 Indian fare being cooked up (the Oriental kitchen is in 

 a separate area) and, true to tradition, a small stage at 

 the far end of the restaurant where there is bound to be 

 some live entertainment sooner rather than later. 

 The menu is extensive and diners 

 are spoilt for choice. I have tried items from the Italian 

 and Oriental selection and the food is wholesome and positively 

 good to eat. Konjee Crispy lamb, a popular starter in many 

 Calcutta restaurants, is done well here. Finely shredded 

 mutton is seasoned with salt and pepper and marinated in 

 the egg-corn flour batter with which it will be coated when 

 fried. It is fried and kept and when an order is placed 

 it is fried again to make it extra crisp. 

 The light Thai soup ? Tom Yam 

 (I had the one with prawns) is also clean-tasting and goes 

 down well, though it could do with a bit more body. The 

 Satay Chicken served with peanut sauce and the flat Pad 

 Thai noodles with seafood, chicken and whole peanuts were 

 other enjoyable items. Pizzas and pastas constitute the 

 main part of the Continental menu, and there are some nice 

 temptations under Starters, Salads and Light Bites such 

 as Potato Corn Salad, Cheesy Corn on Bread, Mixed Mediterranean 

 Vegetables and Spanish Rice. I tried the pizza topped with 

 jalapeno chillies and olives and it was light and tasty, 

 not at all doughy, with a good blend of cheeses that they 

 do. 

 The north Indian selection is 

 also extensive, with many items over and above what one 

 would normally expect such as Chicken Cheese Kabab, Saag 

 Corn, Prawn Malai Curry (the lone Bengali item) and Fish 

 Achari. 

 The most compact selection is 

 the south Indian one with about half a dozen dosas, 

 three or four kinds of uttapam, idlis, vadas 

 and uppama. The attractive feature of BBs is 

 the pricing. For the quality that you get and the understanding 

 of food that they have, which is not surprising given Anand 

 Puris lineage, the prices are reasonable indeed.

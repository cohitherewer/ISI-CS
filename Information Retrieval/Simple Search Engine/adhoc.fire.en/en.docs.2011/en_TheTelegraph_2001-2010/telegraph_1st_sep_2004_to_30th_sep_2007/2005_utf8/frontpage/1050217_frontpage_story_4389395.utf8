 Liquid steel spill toll climbs to three

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bokaro, Feb. 16: Two persons scalded by hot liquid steel yesterday at the Bokaro Steel Plant died of burn injuries today, raising the toll to three.

 Assistant manager P.P. Gupta and crane operator Nirmal Mahto died early this morning at the Bokaro hospital, where they were treated along with three others. 

 The condition of deputy general manager K. Murlidhar continues to be critical. However, the condition of crane operator S.C. Mandal and chargeman B. Prasad is said to be stable.

 The liquid steel was being carried in a laddle when the rope snapped around 2.30 pm yesterday. The liquid steel, scorching hot at 1,500 degrees Celsius, spilled out from a height of 40 feet in the ingot mould factory, instantly killing a labourer, K. Ansari, who was standing on the ground. The heat generated was such that the DGM and the assistant manager, both sitting in their offices some 25 feet away, received serious burn injuries. 

 Bokaro Steel has requisitioned the services of burn specialist Girija Shankar Sahu from Rourkela Steel Plant for better treatment of the three others still undergoing treatment. 

 The five-member inquiry committee set up yesterday has now been expanded to eight and will be headed by executive director (materials) K.M. Bhatt. 

 Hospital sources said the condition of assistant manager Gupta and Mahto started deteriorating after midnight.

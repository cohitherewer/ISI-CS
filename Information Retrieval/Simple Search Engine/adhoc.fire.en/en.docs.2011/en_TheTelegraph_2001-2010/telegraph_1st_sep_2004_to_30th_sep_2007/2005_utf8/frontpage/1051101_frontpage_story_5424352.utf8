Pak-based groups

 Singh to Musharraf: Action, not words 

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: India today held Pakistan-based terrorist groups responsible for Saturdays serial blasts in Delhi, but gave General Pervez Musharraf the benefit of the doubt.

 India expects Pakistan to act against terrorism directed at India, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told Musharraf when the Pakistan President called him this evening to convey his condolences for those who lost their lives in the bomb attacks in Delhi on Saturday.

 Singh demanded immediate action from Musharraf against those who were responsible for the terrorist act.

 Earlier in the day, Musharraf had offered to help in the investigation. We would like to join the investigation with India?. Pakistan would act on the results of the probe.

 Pakistan fully condoles with the government of India as well as with the families of the victims of the dastardly terrorist attack, he said. 

 The Prime Ministers remarks to Musharraf indicated that India was looking for action against terrorists.

 We continue to be disturbed and dismayed at indications of the external linkages of terrorist groups with the October 29 bombing, Singh told Musharraf during the 10-minute conversation.

 It means India believes the group that carried out the attacks in Delhi, killing 59 people, had connections beyond the border. 

 Islamabad asked Delhi to provide evidence of involvement of a Pakistan-based group.

 The Prime Minister said violence against civilians can never be justified and terrorists would never be able to weaken Indias resolve or its commitment to the countrys unity and territorial integrity.

 The Indian response suggests two messages ? one, the obvious warning that acts of terrorism like the blasts could hinder the normalisation process and two, Delhi is not willing yet to hold Musharraf responsible for these attacks.

 Rather, it is ready to give the Pakistan President room to show his resolve to end terrorist activities directed against India.

 The blasts have occurred as the two countries take bold steps to open up the Line of Control to allow Kashmiris from the two sides to work together to rebuild lives after the earthquake.

 Reports from Pakistan said Musharraf expressed happiness over the agreement reached to open five relief centres along the LoC for quake victims.

 I am all for going beyond it. If any Kashmiri wants to come this side or go to the other side, they are welcome to take part in the reconstruction process, he said.

 Musharraf suggested demilitarisation of Kashmir.

 Calcutta, June 5: Forty-eight hours after being spotted at Mughalsarai station, the bridegroom who had vanished two days before his wedding returned to the city to be whisked away to hospital.

 As soon as the Amritsar Mail rolled into Howrah station around 8.30 am, a special police team threw a security cordon around Rajiv Bhattacharya, the London-based IBM executive.

 Before the eyes of relatives and journalists, they escorted him to a red jeep and drove to the Calcutta Medical Research Institute at Ekbalpore, some 18 km from the Salt Lake house where his parents waited for his arrival.

 His condition is such that he cant even talk. We are in no hurry. Let him recover, then well talk to him, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner.

 In an off-white kurta and pyjama, Rajiv, who had gone missing from Ultadanga on June 1, looked a nervous wreck as flashbulbs popped around him at Howrah station. He seemed barely able to walk but somehow dragged himself to the jeep between two rows of onlookers.

 At the hospital, the 31-year-old underwent a series of blood tests and X-ray and CT scans before being admitted to cabin 702 under the care of Dr Bimal Khetawat.

 The patient is suffering from both internal and external pain, Dr Khetawat said. There are injuries to his arms, legs, in the pelvic region and all over. I am not sure about the internal injuries. He will take time to recover.

 Lying on his hospital bed, Rajiv began to sob as he met his parents, sister and brother-in-law, family sources said. 

 He is still in trauma. He showed us the wounds (apparently inflicted by abductors), said Partha Bannerjee, his brother-in-law.

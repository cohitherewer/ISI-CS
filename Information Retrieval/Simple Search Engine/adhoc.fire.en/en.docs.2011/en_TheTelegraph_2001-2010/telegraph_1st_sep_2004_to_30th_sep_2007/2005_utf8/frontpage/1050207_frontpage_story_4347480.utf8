 Politics on pitch, Pak ball in Delhi court 

 OUR BUREAU

Feb. 6: Politics has again invaded the India-Pakistan 

cricket pitch.

Pakistan today made it clear that political 

reasons, not security concerns, were behind its reluctance to play in Ahmedabad, 

one of the worst-hit places in Gujarat during the riots of 2002.

In India, too, the political leadership will now decide 

the future course of action.

As the first step, the Manmohan Singh government is expected to request Pakistan 

to reconsider the reservations about playing in Ahmedabad. 

The external affairs ministry will take up the 

matter with Pakistans foreign ministry and ask it to reconsider the decision, 

a source said in Delhi. The government said it is committed to providing 

full security and did not envisage any problem with the match being played in 

Ahmedabad, he added.

Chennai, Pakistans favourite venue after its 

victorious team was treated to a rare standing ovation in 1999, is on the drawing 

board as an alternative venue. 

The BCCI will meet on February 16 to finalise the 

schedule for Pakistans tour of India the first in six years. The 

tour, slated to begin on February 25, involves three Tests and five one-dayers.

The Centre prefers sticking to the original plan because 

it feels that a Pakistan match in Gujarat will go a long way in sending the signal 

that the country has put the riots behind it.

Such compulsions are playing on Pakistans mind, 

too. We do not want to do anything that will affect the goodwill generated 

by Indias tour of Pakistan last year. However, if we play in Gujarat, it 

will be construed by hardliners in our country as a gesture that condones the 

riots. We are helpless, a Pakistani diplomatic source said.

Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan today 

indicated as much. Yes, we have expressed our inability and our reservations 

are based on political reasons, he told PTI in Karachi.

Since our objections are politically based, 

we thought it better to completely ignore the centre (in Ahmedabad), instead of 

agreeing to play a shorter version of the game there, the former diplomat 

said.

India had security concerns and not political 

concerns about Peshawar and Karachi (in 2004). Therefore, it was mutually agreed 

that limited over internationals could be played at these centres.

Jagmohan Dalmiya, the BCCIs immediate past president, 

told The Telegraph that the board would be guided by what New Delhi says.

He pointed out that when security concerns had cropped 

up in the run-up to Indias tour of Pakistan last year, the board had taken 

the same stand and referred the matter to the Centre. The government has 

to decide, Dalmiya added.

 Sachin, gift-wrapped for Sania

 - One sports icon turns 19 today, another 16

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sania

 Hyderabad, Nov. 14: Its 

 not known what Sania Mirzas parents intend gifting 

 her, but on the eve of turning 19, she described hero Sachin 

 Tendulkars presence in her city as the greatest 

 birthday gift.

 It embarrassed Sachin, who was sharing the Hyderabad 10K Run platform with her this evening, but the applause at the Taj Residencys Raaga hall was near deafening. Incidentally, the morrow will be special for Sachin as well ? its going to mark the completion of 16 years of international cricket.

 A birthday with a difference, really, and the attention wont be on Sania alone. First, though, more on her.

 Asked by The Telegraph whether sitting alongside Sachin had been a first, Sania flashed that billion-watt smile: Yeah... I cant remember any previous instance.? It has been a special occasion.

 Sachin, of course, has been invited by the Mirzas to grace the small birthday party, as mother Naseema put it, but its not clear whether our biggest sporting icon will actually head for Sanias Jubilee Hills residence. 

 The first ODI against South Africa is on Wednesday and Sachin usually stays away from media-attracting events in the lead-up to a big match. Sania, by the way, wont be in Hyderabad that day.

 Ive got work in New Delhi and, unfortunately, it cant be rescheduled.? Ive got no choice but to watch whatever little I can on the TV, she said, smiling yet again.

 Sachin, it may be recalled, was into tennis in a big way till the 1983 World Cup. Thats when he took to Shivaji Park full-time and skipped the hardcourts. Yet, he followed the careers of John McEnroe, Steffi Graf and Pete Sampras with huge interest.

 He has already gone on record applauding Sanias fighting spirit and the example she has set for youngsters.

 In fact, Sachin and Sania (as also 2001 All-England badminton champion Pullela Gopichand who, sadly, got ignored) set an off-the-playing-arena example by coming together to promote the 10K Run, scheduled for November 27.

 The funds collected, largely through sponsorships, are to go towards charitable causes. The organisers contributed a handsome Rs 20 lakh towards the chief ministers fund for Save a Childs Heart from the second edition last year.

 Im happy that the Run has been bringing a smile to children who have problems of one kind or the other.... Were involved with sports, but there are larger issues ? like saving the lives of (underprivileged) children, Sachin, who is associated with the Mumbai-based Apnalaya, remarked.

 Sania spoke on much the same lines: Were in a position to influence society and Ive been doing what I can?. Hopefully, its going to be more when I reach Sachins age (32)?. Words cant describe the satisfaction on lending a hand to charitable causes.?

 Both urged sponsors to come forward more generously.

 The last word, not surprisingly, rested with Sachin. When someone asked just how much he himself ran to keep fit, he responded laughing: I was telling Gopi that I dont like running unless its for runs!

 Well, to avoid getting mobbed, Sachin had to make an exception once the Hyderabad 10K Run promotional got over, Such was the frenzy ? in Sanias presence, mind you ? that he had to exit through the hotels kitchen.

 The chefs, a couple of whom promptly took out their camera phones, didnt mind.

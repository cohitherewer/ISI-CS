 Small-town surge in HS

 - No arts topper from Cotton

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, June 7: Students of relatively unknown institutions tasted unprecedented success in the Assam higher secondary arts examination, the results of which were declared today, along with those of the plus-two commerce examination.

 Guwahati institutions, including Cotton College, shocked many by drawing a blank in the arts roll of honour. The top two positions were earned by Ankur Pratim Saikia of Titabor and Hiramani Patgiri of Bajali, who aggregated 419 and 417. 

 Ankur studied at Pragjyotika Junior College, which opened in 2000, but sat for the examination from Mihiram Saikia Higher Secondary School in Titabor because his alma mater has yet to be recognised by the Assam Higher Secondary Education Council (AHSEC). 

 Hiramani, who attended classes at Bajali Academy of Excellence Junior College, appeared for the examination from Bajali Vidyapeeth for the same reason.

 Crazy about cricket and a fan of singer Zubeen Garg, Ankur is the son of college teachers Ram Krishna and Inu Saikia. He intends to study in Delhi University to fulfil my dream, which is to become an administrator.

 In the commerce stream, Gauhati Commerce College kept its flag flying by producing the top two ? Pulkit Agarwal and Pramod Agarwal. 

 Pulkit, who wants to become a chartered accountant, described his success as the culmination of his sustained efforts. I would like to complete my studies here because the city has the requisite infrastructure to nurture talent.

 AHSEC chairman Dilip Kumar Kakati said it was probably the first time that the arts merit list had no student from Guwahati. 

 The overall arts pass percentage increased by three per cent to reach 57.08 per cent. As many as 4,420 students got first-division marks, while 21,051 and 49,492 passed the examination in the second and third divisions. 

 Apart from Ankur and Hiramani, the arts merit list includes Putumani Thakuria of B.H. College in Howli and Ranjumani Dutta of Bezera Higher Secondary School (both 3rd), Kakali Das of Tihu College (4th), Joyshree Buragohain of North Lakhimpur College (5th), Abhijit Borah of North Lakhimpur College (6th), Pallabi Nath of Saraighat College (7th), Kukil Bora of Kolongpar Vidyapith (8th), Rumi Saikia of Nowgong College and Sangita Devi of Tihu College (9th). The 10th position was shared by Ashraful Islam of Madhab Choudhury College, Purabi Thakuria of B.H. College, Rekha Moni Borah of Kaliabor Girls Higher Secondary School and Rahul Gogoi of Sonari College.

 The commerce pass percentage (64.8 per cent) increased marginally by 0.1 per cent over last years figure. 

 Sumit Kumar Bhansali of B.H. College in Howli, Munmee Barman (Shankar Madhav Junior College) and Rahul Dutta of Gauhati Commerce College earned the 3rd, 4th and 5th positions.

 Video watch in varsity

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, May 28: Next time a hand snakes out of a moving car to touch a girl, chances are the offender will be captured live.

 From June 1, when Delhi University opens its doors for admissions, video cameras will keep watch from different points on the campus. 

 This is the first time cameras are being used in the run-up to admissions, that too outdoors. So far, the cameras have kept watch inside rooms and in corridors in some colleges.

 Delhi police, left groping in the dark earlier this month after car-borne rapists abducted an undergraduate student before dropping her off two hours later, have decided to install the cameras. 

 The idea is to catch not only men with evil intentions but also those who black-market admission forms.

 The video cameras will be used to ensure there is no untoward incident on the campus. They will be installed as per the requirement. For instance, we have approached Delhi University to have the cameras installed at the 15 admission form centres on the campus, said deputy commissioner, North District, Anurag Kumar. Depending on the locations, we will also be using mobile cameras.

 Police officers, who are being helped in their efforts by the university students union, said several girls have complained of harassment, particularly from moving cars, on the campus.

 The police usually stepped up security during admission time when ragging is anticipated. This time they are taking early precautions.

 Colleges like Kirori Mal and Sri Venkateshwara have already installed closed-circuit TVs to check ragging. There are 32 cameras on the campus, said A.S. Reddy, principal of Sri Venkateshwara College. While 18 are in the library to check pilferage of books, the rest are in the corridors and canteen.

 For students like Rita Mathur, the cameras will bring a sense of security. There have been so many incidents of late that anything can happen, she said. 

 It is not possible for my parents to go with me all the time.

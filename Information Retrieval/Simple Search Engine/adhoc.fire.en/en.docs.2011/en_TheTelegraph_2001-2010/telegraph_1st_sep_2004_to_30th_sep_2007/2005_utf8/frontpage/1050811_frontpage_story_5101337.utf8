 Sao Paulo, Aug. 10: A gang in 

 Brazil has pulled off one of historys biggest bank 

 robberies after tunnelling into the vault of a central bank 

 building and making off with an estimated ?38 million. 

 Officials are still working out 

 how much money was taken after the gang tunnelled 80 metres 

 under neighbouring houses and a high street to come up under 

 the vault of a regional Brazilian central bank office in 

 Fortaleza, Brazils fifth-biggest city.

 Once under the vault, the gang 

 cut a hole through the 1.1-metre-thick steel and reinforced 

 concrete floor of the 500 square metre strongbox.

 Officials found the hole in their 

 vault when the office was opened on Monday morning after 

 having been shut all weekend. Five containers in the safe 

 had been opened and emptied of about 3 million banknotes.

 The haul weighed about 3 tonnes 

 and was composed of used 50 real (Brazilian currency) banknotes, 

 worth about ?12.50 each.

 Despite the huge amount of money 

 involved, the robbers got away cleanly as no alarm went 

 off and no hostages were taken during the raid. Police have 

 already extended their search for the gang beyond Ceara, 

 the northeastern state of which Fortaleza is the capital.

 The money taken had been withdrawn 

 from circulation for testing and the bank planned to destroy 

 notes in poor condition and put the rest back into circulation. 

 Made up of used, non-sequential 

 and commonly accepted banknotes, the robbers haul 

 is virtually untraceable.

 Police and an internal bank investigation 

 will focus on how the gang managed to bypass the banks 

 alarm system and the movement sensors in the vault. Cameras 

 in the bank are said to have recorded nothing unusual after 

 the office closed at 6 pm on Friday. 

 The police will also examine if 

 the gang received inside information from someone connected 

 to the bank.

 The tunnel used by the gang was 

 traced by police back to a house one street away from the 

 bank. The house had been rented since April to several men 

 who had set up and run a landscape gardening company from 

 it. 

 Called Synthetic Lawns and supposedly 

 specialising in natural and artificial garden lawns, the 

 company acted as a front for the mens activities in 

 the house. 

 The police suspect that the gang 

 chose a landscaping business to help to explain the movement 

 of large amounts of earth from the property. The tunnel 

 running from the house was 4 metres below street level, 

 had 70 cm of headroom and was propped up with wooden supports 

 and sandbags.

 It was also fitted out with plastic 

 sheeting, electric light and air conditioning for the comfort 

 of the tunnellers. The robbers left behind cutters, an electric 

 saw, drills and a blow torch.

 Up to 10 men who are believed 

 to have frequented the rented house are being sought in 

 connection with the raid.

 Local residents said the men had 

 been friendly and several of them used to have lunch and 

 after-work drinks in local bars in the months leading up 

 to the robbery.

 They added that they did not believe 

 that the men were from the Fortaleza region, with people 

 saying the mens accents indicated they were possibly 

 from Rio de Janeiro. 

 In recent years assaults on Brazilian 

 banks have fallen because of improved security and many 

 bank robbers instead turned to kidnapping as a less lucrative 

 but less riskier option.

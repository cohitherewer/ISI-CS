The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Guard pays, not system 

 A person carrying a walkie-talkie (only police 

or security personnel 

are allowed to use it) is stopping a cart-puller

The person is directing the cart-puller towards 

a point

Another person is directing a cart-puller

with two cart-pullers standing by

On Saturday night, while trying to escape the clutches 

of a bribe-seeking constable, a truck climbed the pavement and killed two boys. 

After a shot-gun inquiry, the police authorities declared that no policeman had 

sought bribe leading to the accident. Yesterday, The Telegraph published 

pictures of a home guard accepting what looked like bribes. The pictures were 

meant to point out to the police that since the practice was so rampant, they 

might have acted in haste while giving the constable a clean chit, if only because 

two boys, four and six years old, had died.

 The authorities have acted fast. They have ?demobilised? the home guard ? he will not get work. Home guards are paid a daily wage of Rs 130.

The Telegraph went back yesterday to the spot 

where the home guard?s pictures were shot and found something strange going on.

The person carrying the walkie-talkie and the man 

in the check shirt never talk but the process is repeated over and over. If theres 

a pattern in their movements, its for the reader to decide.

The home guard has been punished but is the system 

still very much in place? Its an answer only the police can give. This 

case of the home guard apparently accepting bribes is not isolated, said 

C.V. Murlidhar, joint commissioner of police, traffic. If photographs are 

published of constables and sergeants taking money, action will be taken against 

them, he added. On Saturday, when the two boys died, no photographer was 

present.

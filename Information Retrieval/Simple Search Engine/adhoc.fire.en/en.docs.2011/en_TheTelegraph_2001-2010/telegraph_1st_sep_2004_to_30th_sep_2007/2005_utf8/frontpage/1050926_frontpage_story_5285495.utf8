The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Cricket spins on vicious track

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Exactly a day after Sourav Ganguly asked the media to keep Team India out of his row with Greg Chappell, Harbhajan Singh unleashed his most lethal doosra.

 If the coachs e-mail to Board of Control for Cricket in India president Ranbir Singh Mahendra tore Sourav to pieces, Harbhajan savaged Chappell in hometown Jalandhar this afternoon.

 The captain, of course, received his unequivocal backing.

 Already on the backfoot after the e-mail got leaked, board mandarins were praying they wouldnt have to contend with another explosion before Tuesdays review meeting in Mumbai.

 They hadnt reckoned with the sardar, though. Late tonight, the board gagged everybody who went to Zimbabwe, but the damage seems beyond repair.

 The season thus far is to be reviewed by three officials ?Jagmohan Dalmiya, Mahendra and S.K. Nair ? and as many former captains (Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri).

 Incidentally, theyre the ones who selected Chappell, four months ago.

 Chappell was the lone invitee when the meeting was called. However, after the captaincy episode in Bulawayo and the e-mail, Sourav will also be there.

 One neednt guess whats going to dominate and Harbhajan has made Chappells position almost untenable.

 Among other things, he has accused Chappell of creating fear and insecurity and slammed him for trying to cause a rift between him and vice-captain Rahul Dravid.

 Sure, the coach may also have much to say, but you cant have a dressing room where theres such mistrust and rancour.

 It appears worse than the infighting in Pakistan dressing rooms when an Imran Khan wouldnt be around.

 In fact, those across the border must be having a nice laugh and coach Bob Woolmer would be chuckling. With all this tamasha, his job is bound to become easy when India tours Pakistan from January. 

 God, its terrible? Reeks somewhat of groupism and points to terrible man management, said a board official.

 Chappell, who returned late last night, refused to take calls and, unusually, didnt respond to an SMS either after Harbhajan went ballistic.

 The star off-spinners assault confirms a September 19 report (Problem goes beyond Big 2 equation) in The Telegraph that Sourav wasnt the only one having a problem with the coach.

 Sources in the team have revealed that Sourav actually went the distance to ensure Harbhajan and Zaheer Khan, two among the four who had differences with Chappell in the season-launching tri-series in Sri Lanka, didnt give cause for complaint in Zimbabwe.

 Going by Harbhajans tone, the coach obviously didnt reciprocate. 

 The captain asked Bhajji and Zak to meet every demand ? even if it meant bowling six overs at midnight! the sources pointed out.

 So much for Chappells accusation that Sourav was dividing the team. 

 Sourav also received a boost when, speaking exclusively from Mumbai, Amitabh Choudhary (manager on the Zimbabwe tour) brushed aside Chappells most damning indictment: That in his desperation to keep the job, the captain was effecting a schism.

 I was with the boys for a month and at no time did I notice any overt attempt (by Sourav) to cause a divide, he said.

 Choudhary added: At this point, I dont wish to say anything else? My report will have it all.

 Earlier, in an interview to a TV network, hed dismissed another Chappell allegation ? that Sourav skipped practice sessions.

 Theres a suggestion that Choudhary, too, be called for the review.

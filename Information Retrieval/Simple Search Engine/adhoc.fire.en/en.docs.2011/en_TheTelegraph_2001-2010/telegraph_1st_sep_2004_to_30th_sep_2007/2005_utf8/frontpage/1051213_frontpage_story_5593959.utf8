 Absent Mini target of abuse

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: Mini Kanoria, who allegedly faked her abduction only to be rescued while she was having tea on Sunday morning with kidnapper and alleged husband Mohit Srivastava, has left her Howrah home with her parents.

 With Mini not around to tell her side of the story, the families of the two men, one that she was about to marry and one that she apparently did marry, heaped abuse on her.

 Dont talk about that woman, exploded Hari Om Srivastava, father of Mohit who is now lodged in Presidency Jail charged with the abduction of Mini with the help of two friends from the side of her would-be groom Vikas Khaitan on Vidyasagar Setu on Saturday evening.

 That woman has ruined my son, hurt our family pride. We always thought she was bad news for Mohit, he cried.

 Neither Mini nor any member of her family was available for comment on the abduction that ? police continued to assert ? never was.

 Their room is locked. I havent seen them ever since the so-called abduction on Saturday, said Biren Ram Singh, the caretaker of the apartment where Mini and Mohit lived on the fifth and the first floor, respectively.

 It is not surprising that Minis family has taken her out of sight in apprehension of the social censure that would have inevitably followed the 24-year-old girl, marking her out for life.

 Yesterday, the chief judicial magistrates court released Mini on a Rs 500-bail after she denied that she had secretly registered last month her marriage with Mohit, her alleged lover of five years. 

 However, the police in their report submitted to Bankshal court said the two ? originally thought to be kidnapper and victim ? were found 12 hours later in a Burrabazar address as man and wife.

 After her release, Mini and her family did not return home, neighbours said. 

 The Srivastavas claimed that Mohit was repenting for not listening to the familys objection to his affair with Mini. Today, his mother and sister went to meet him. He told them that Mini had called him up and asked him to take her away from the clutches of the Khaitans. But later ditched him in court, Hari Om said.

 He added that he learnt of the affair two months ago. I tried my best to persuade him not to continue with the relationship. But he wouldnt listen.

 The Khaitans, who chose Mini as their prospective daughter-in-law and fixed the marriage for December 15, blamed her and her family. We had no idea there was this fellow Mohit waiting in the background, said Sashi Khaitan, Vikass mother. 

 You cant imagine how badly shaken up my son is. He says he will never marry. We dont know what the future has in store for him. Let things settle, we will try to get him married to a decent girl.

 What does Vikas say of Minis vehement denial of her marriage to Mohit in the court? Vikas kya bolega? (Vikas has no say). He will do what we tell him to do, Sashi said.

 Tutor Chappell takes India lessons 

 - New coach watches Monsoon Wedding with wife to soak in culture

 Bangalore, June 16: Greg Chappell made 161 appearances (87 of them in Tests) for Australia, but didnt play in India. He did, of course, make the occasional trip before being appointed coach last month.

 Chappell wasnt picked for the 1969-70 tour when Bill Lawry was captain. A decade later, owing to the Packer fallout, he couldnt make it under Kim Hughes either. By the next tour, Chappell had retired. 

 So, given limited exposure to the culture in these parts, Chappell and his wife of 34 years, Judith, spent much of the past four weeks learning about India.

 That enriching exercise included viewing Mira Nairs acclaimed Monsoon Wedding and a New Delhi-specific programme, both on the small screen back in Adelaide.

 We enjoyed the movie and were enthralled by the stuff on New Delhi, telecast by a channel which has slots for ethnic minorities?. It helped in our homework, Chappell told The Telegraph this evening.

 John Wrights successor did India-related reading as well: I dont read for fun, but to learn?. I get ideas and, often, see if they can be implemented in cricket.

 Well, Chappell is different.

 The Chappells arrived late last night and this city will be their India home for two years, at least. Apartment-hunting is on the agenda, but a hitch is that nobody seems inclined to offer anything on lease.

 Thats Judiths portfolio?. Let her choose and, then, the BCCI gets into the picture?. Ive got more important work to do, Chappell said, grinning.

 He added: I do feel Ive taken up this job at the right time?. In every sphere, after all, the boom has either set in or is about to happen?. 

 The economy is growing, industry is getting bigger...and, yes, India has the potential to dominate cricket..., he said.

 Clearly, a poor ODI ranking hasnt dampened the enthusiasm of one who swears by that classic quotation mounted on the National Cricket Academy walls here: Falling down doesnt make you a failure, but staying down does.

 Chappell, who has already announced he expects nothing less than a commitment to excellence from everybody, didnt miss it on his Academy tour earlier in the day.

 Incidentally, hes going to have a room at the hi-tech Academy.

 Im not prescribing a formula, but its important to persist and persevere?. Cricket isnt only about having the skills, for much of sport today is mental?. Those most successful are the ones with the toughest minds, Chappell explained.

 Theres speculation whether he will ask for a vote at selection committee meetings. However, his mind isnt made up: Let me first talk to the selectors?. We need to work towards a common goal?. Im not sure whether a formal vote is necessary.

 Whats not in doubt is that Chappell wants a core group of 15-20 players to be quickly identified. Understandably, hes looking for team-players and not stars. 

 Chappell has been insisting he doesnt possess all the knowledge, but whatever he knows should impact hugely once the business-end of his (24x7) appointment begins with next months tri-series in Sri Lanka.

 By then, Judith would have perfected the namaste.

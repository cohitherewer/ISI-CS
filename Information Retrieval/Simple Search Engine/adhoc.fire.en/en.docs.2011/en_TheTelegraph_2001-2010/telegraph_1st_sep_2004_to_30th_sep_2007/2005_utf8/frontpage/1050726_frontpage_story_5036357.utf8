The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 DD versus the rest

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcutta, July 25: Cricket broadcasters Ten Sports, ESPN STAR, Zee Sports and Sony have sunk their customary feuding to form a partnership against big brother Doordarshan for repeatedly grabbing a slice of their revenue in the name of public interest.

 Ten Sports holds the telecast rights for the tri-series involving India, Sri Lanka and West Indies that starts this Saturday, but DD has asked it to share the broadcast.

 Tomorrow, the four channels will appeal to the information and broadcasting ministry to stop the national broadcaster from routinely arm-twisting them.

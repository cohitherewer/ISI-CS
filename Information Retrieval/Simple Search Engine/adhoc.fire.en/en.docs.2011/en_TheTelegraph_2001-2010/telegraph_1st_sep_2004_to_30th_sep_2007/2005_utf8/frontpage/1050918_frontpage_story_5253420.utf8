 Seal on IIT format

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 17: The new selection procedure for the IIT Joint Entrance Examination and a question paper format to reduce stress on students was finalised today.

 The Joint Admissions Board of the Indian Institutes of Technology met to iron out certain kinks in the recommendations made by a task force to overhaul the exam system.

 Starting next year, students wanting to take the JEE will have to secure 60 per cent marks or a first division in the Class XII board exam (55 per cent for SC/STs). They will be allowed only two attempts to clear the exam.

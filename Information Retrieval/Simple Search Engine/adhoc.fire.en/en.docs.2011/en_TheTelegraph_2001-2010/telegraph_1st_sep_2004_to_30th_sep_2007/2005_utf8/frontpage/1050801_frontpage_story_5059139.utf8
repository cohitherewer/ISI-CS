 Death at altar of education

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 31: The burden of acquiring a bright future proved too heavy for 20-year-old Tamosha Sil to bear.

 The student of chartered accountancy was found hanging in the bedroom of her rented flat in Alipore today.

 Unable to cope with the pressure of educating herself ? she was also pursuing a parallel course in computers ? Tamosha killed herself with a dupatta tied round her neck, police said. Officers from Alipore police station said the girl probably died sometime yesterday.

 The elder daughter of a deputy manager in the Durgapur Steel Plant, Tamosha used to live alone in her D.L. Khan Road flat.

 There is no suicide note, said Nanda Dulal Pal, the officer-in-charge of Alipore police station. But certain entries in her personal diary which we retrieved from a drawer throw light on her frame of mind and sense of dejection.

 According to the police, the diary reveals how Tamosha was struggling to carry on with the two courses. She also despaired over an unsatisfactory performance despite her parents spending a fortune on her education. Besides, she added, having failed in a CA examination last May, it pained her to attend classes with students junior to her.

 I guess it was a wrong decision on my part to have enrolled in two courses at a time, Tamosha wrote. The pages also document the girls anguish about failing to make it to a reputable college in spite of scoring 81 per cent in her Plus-Two exams.

 Tamoshas uncles came to her flat this afternoon at the request of her mother, who had been trying to contact her on her cellphone all of yesterday, and found the doors locked from inside. The police arrived and broke open the door and found her hanging from the ceiling of the bedroom.

 Going by the state of her body when it was brought down ? it had completely stiffened ? the police believe the death occurred last evening.

 In all her writings, there is no hint of her parents being responsible for her plight. But it appears that the frustration had been building up for quite some time and she just couldnt take it anymore, said Pal.

 After clearing her CBSE Plus-Two exams, Tamosha had come to Calcutta a few years ago. She graduated in commerce and enrolled in the CA foundation course, which she cleared in 2003. 

 The following year, down with fever, Tamosha could not appear for one of the CA exams and slipped into a bout of depression. Her parents helped her cope and she took admission to a diploma course in computers.

 She lived by herself, rarely talking to anyone except a girl who, too, hailed from Durgapur and lived next to her. Occasionally, she would visit her aunt, said a neighbour.

 Tamoshas parents have been informed and her body has been sent for post-mortem.

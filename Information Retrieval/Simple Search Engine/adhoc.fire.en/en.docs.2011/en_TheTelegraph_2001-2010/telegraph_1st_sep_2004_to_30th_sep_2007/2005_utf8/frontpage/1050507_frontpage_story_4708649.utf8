 Horror night for officer

 JOY SENGUPTA

 Ranchi, May 6: A senior Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited (TVNL) officer was severely assaulted while being driven round the city in a shocking incident that has engulfed some officials in the power utility.

 TVNL joint secretary Kavindra Ram (32) was dragged into a car around 11 pm yesterday as he was about to enter his Shukla Colony home. 

 Ram was mercilessly beaten inside the vehicle by three men as the driver circled the city. After almost three hours, the men, thinking him to be dead, dumped him on a drain near Kantatoli Chowk. Around 2.45 am, Ram somehow got back his senses and made a call to his house.

 Police acted fast and he was immediately picked up and shifted to Raj Hospital.

 Ram blames office politics for the attack and has suspected the involvement of some of his colleagues. Late tonight, a named FIR was lodged at the Doranda police station against joint director (technical) Kaleshwar Mahto, executive engineer Prabhat Kumar, assistant personal officer, Sukhdeo Mahto, clerk Yogendra Thakur and senior engineers Vidyasagar Singh and Shailesh Choudhury.

 The police are yet to find out the reason behind the assault. Ranchi senior superintendent of police Anurag Gupta said: ?We dont have any idea about the reason for this attack. But we believe the criminals wanted to kill him. They took him for dead and dumped him.?

 Speaking from his hospital bed, Ram said as soon as he was pulled into the car, his face was wrapped in a wet towel. They beat him mercilessly and jabbed him with a knife. Then they started choking him with a nylon rope, which was when he lost consciousness. That probably saved him.

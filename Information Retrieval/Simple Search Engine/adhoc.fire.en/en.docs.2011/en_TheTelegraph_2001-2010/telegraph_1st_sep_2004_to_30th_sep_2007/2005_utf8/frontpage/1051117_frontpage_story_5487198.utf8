 Suri gets hotel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 16: Great Eastern Hotel was today handed over to Lalit Suris Bharat Hotels by the Bengal government.

 The deal was clinched after the hotelier-turned-Rajya Sabha MP offered to pay Rs 52 crore for the 90 per cent government stake and spend another Rs 120 crore to renovate the 165-year-old hotel.

Suri told The Telegraph from London that he 

was very glad things had clicked. He said he would rechristen the 

hotel Grand Great Eastern Hotel and position it as a premium heritage property.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 A park saved

 A park is to play on and not to hold fairs, after all. Never mind what the mayor thinks.

 Thanks are due to the khadi board, which decided on Monday to postpone indefinitely the mela that was proposed to be held at Deshapriya Park in south Calcutta.

 The mela would have stopped all sporting activity in the peak cricket season for almost a month, but for the protests organised by the local people under councillor Debasish Kumar who went on a hunger strike from Friday.

 For the past five days, The Telegraph has been campaigning against holding the fair at the park. 

 We have decided to defer the fair for the time being, Braja Mukherjee, the chairman of the Khadi amp; Village Board, the fair organiser, said. 

 Kumar thanked the khadi board, saying: This is a victory for the common people.

 Sheriff Chuni Goswami, who had played a lot of cricket at the park, added: Im glad good sense has prevailed and cricket can be played at Deshapriya Park once again.

 Only mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who had said sporting activities were not desirable at parks, insisted: We will give the green signal every time a similar organisation approaches us. Parks, after all, are meant for events like this (mela) only.

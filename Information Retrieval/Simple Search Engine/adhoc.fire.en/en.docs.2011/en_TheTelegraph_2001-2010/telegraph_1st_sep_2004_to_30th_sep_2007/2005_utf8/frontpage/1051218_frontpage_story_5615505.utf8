The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Appeal against unrest

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta, Dec. 17: Despite the pressure, Sourav Ganguly has conducted himself admirably, post-Zimbabwe. 

 The former Team India captain didnt say anything much even after being dropped earlier this week, but with his exclusion reverberating in Parliament and a bandh called in the state, he chose to issue an appeal this evening.

 The third and final Test (against Sri Lanka) begins tomorrow and I wouldnt like anything untoward to happen because of me. Thats why the appeal, Sourav told The Telegraph.

 My concern isnt only about fans here, but somebody may choose to do something in Ahmedabad or (neighbouring) Motera?. Moreover, at this point, the team needs to be supported ? not an individual, he added.

 Asked whether the emotional outpouring of support took him by surprise, Sourav replied grinning: Frankly, today, nothing surprises me.

 His appeal included: Whatever has happened, I respect the selectors decision. Im sure, with my performances, Ill again get the opportunity to play?

 Any bandh is going to jeopardise public life, which is not right.

 Besides the concern, Sourav must have realised that if protests continued and Tuesdays bandh (called by a hitherto little-known organisation) received sentiment-driven support, the Establishment wouldnt take to it too kindly.

 In any case, Board of Control for Cricket in India president Sharad Pawar has been critical of the Sourav issue reaching Parliament.

 Meanwhile, according to an agency report from Mumbai, Pawar has communicated to Jagmohan Dalmiya that it wouldnt be proper for him (Pawar) to interfere in the selection process.

 Pawar claims to have responded to Dalmiyas call for Souravs reinstatement for the final Test (not that it was anything more than a pressure tactic ahead of the Pakistan selection), but Dalmiya insisted he hadnt received anything.

 Its 11.30 pm now, but I havent got a reply? If I have to react, it will be after Ive heard from Pawar, he maintained.

 Going by the report, Pawar has taken a swipe at Dalmiya (whose casting vote defeated him in the 2004 elections) by saying predecessor Ranbir Singh Mahendra hadnt intervened when Sourav was overlooked earlier in the season.

 Mahendra, as is known, was propped up by Dalmiya.

 Footnote: The Orissa Cricket Association has flayed Souravs omission from the team. Ironically, association president Ranjib Biswal is Easts man on the selection committee!

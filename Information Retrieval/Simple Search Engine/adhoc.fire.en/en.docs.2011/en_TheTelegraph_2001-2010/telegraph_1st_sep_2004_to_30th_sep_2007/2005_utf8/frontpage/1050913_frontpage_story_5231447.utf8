 BJP two make up to fight bigger battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Khurana: Back 

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: The crisis in the BJP ended according to the script written yesterday as Madan Lal Khurana apologised, Lal Krishna Advani rescinded his expulsion and Atal Bihari Vajpayee smacked his lips before resuming the wait to collect Narendra Modis scalp.

 Khurana apologised to BJP president Advani in a letter for the statements he had made against him, leading to the expulsion and the unprecedented open show of its condemnation by Vajpayee. 

 Within hours of the letter reaching Advani, Khuranas expulsion was revoked and his primary membership restored.

 At the end of the drama involving the BJPs Big Two, Vajpayee showed he still had the authority to call the shots in the party by virtue of his stature and strategic position where Advani has to depend on his support.

 If Vajpayee had not criticised the expulsion, Khurana would have been consigned to the rubbish bin forever.

 Khuranas letter was penned this afternoon and vetted by general secretary Pramod Mahajan before it was handed over to Advani. He admitted that he had publicly uttered statements he should not have because they had caused immense damage to the party and inflicted mental hurt on you (Advani). 

 Expressing regret, Khurana said he would recant and requested Advani to give him a chance to serve the nation through the party.

 The BJP chief convened a meeting of his general secretaries and vice-presidents ? M. Venkaiah Naidu and Bal Apte. Jaswant Singh and Sushma Swaraj were also invited.

 Mahajan said Khuranas letter was discussed and the consensus was that he should be asked to return. The general secretary (organisation), Sanjay Joshi, drafted a letter on Advanis behalf informing Khurana that his expulsion had been rescinded.

 Asked what caused the change ? Vajpayees statement or Khuranas apology ?Mahajan said: Vajpayee is our tallest leader and we honour every wish of his.

 Modi: Atal target

 He added that the former Prime Minister had an impact on every policy and decision taken by the party.

 It was the denial of this influence, rather than admiration for Khurana, in Advanis decision to order expulsion without taking Vajpayees consent that provoked the crisis.

 Trouble in the BJP is by no means over, though, as Vajpayee might still insist on getting rid of Modi. Some observers believe Vajpayees letter opposing Khuranas expulsion was also prompted by Advanis reluctance to act against Modi.

 Jaswant Singh in the main and Mahajan and Rajnath Singh acted as mediators in resolving the crisis. Sources said Jaswant was the key emissary because of his proximity to his political guru, Vajpayee, and acceptability to Advani.

 The BJP chief may seem to be the loser in the episode, but in the bargain he gets Vajpayees continuing support in the bigger battle against the Sangh which wants him out.

 This is the second occasion in recent times the BJP has taken disciplinary action and revoked it after an expression of regret ? earlier it was Uma Bharti. Asked if this had become a routine, Mahajan said: I share your concern.

 The partys national executive will now meet in Chennai as scheduled from Friday.

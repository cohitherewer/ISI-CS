 Operation off, troops to stay

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Sept. 27: Mounting 

 pressure today forced the army to call off its assault on 

 Ulfa militants in the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, but 

 the announcement came with a victory cry and a clarification 

 that troops would remain there to stop a fresh incursion.

 The end of Operation Balwan capped a day of multiple developments, including Gauhati High Courts directive to Dispur to ensure that residents of areas in the vicinity of the park were not inconvenienced by the flushout operation.

 The army, which started feeling the heat after Ulfa constituted a Peoples Consultative Group to do the spadework for its proposed talks with Delhi, insisted that the operation had been called off only because no militants were left in Dibru-Saikhowa. 

 Officially, five Ulfa militants were killed in the operation. The operation was called off at 4 pm because the area has been cleaned up, a senior army officer, Col Ajay Kumar Pandey, said.

 He claimed that the purpose of Operation Balwan had been achieved, but the army would maintain its presence in the area to make sure that militants did not enter the park again. They were carrying out their operations from the forest, but it is over now. 

 Col Pandey had briefed governor Lt. Gen (retd) Ajai Singh and chief secretary S. Kabilan on the operation earlier in the day. It was routine, he said. 

 The chief secretary heads the decision-making caucus of the Unified Command, a three-tier counter-insurgency structure comprising the army, police and paramilitary forces. 

 Sources said the armys decision to call off the operation was hastened by chief minister Tarun Gogois appeals to Delhi and the Congress high command.

 Yes, there was pressure from the state government but not directly on us. It was at the ministry level. We came to know that the chief minister had requested the UPA government and the Congress leadership to convince the ministry of defence to call off the operation, said a senior officer of the armys 4 Corps, headquartered in Tezpur.

 Several organisations, mainly the Peoples Consultative Group, had been pressuring Dispur to act fast to create a conducive atmosphere for the peace process.

 The Peoples Committee for Peace Initiative, a conglomerate of 21 organisations, announced a 12-hour statewide bandh on Thursday against the army operation and police highhandedness during a democratic protest in Guwahati.

 Dilip Patgiri, a member of both the new committee and Ulfas team of mediators, accused the police of preventing a demonstration. 

 Earlier in the day, the AGP moved the National Human Rights Commission to put an end to the warlike situation in Dibru-Saikhowa.

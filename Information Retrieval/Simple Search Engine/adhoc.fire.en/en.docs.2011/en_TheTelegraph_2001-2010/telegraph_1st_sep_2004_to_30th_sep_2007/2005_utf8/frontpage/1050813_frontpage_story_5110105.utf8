 Slang, bang, Sourav

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: Sourav Gangulys return as the Team India captain (for Zimbabwe), today, was preceded by a slanging match between the one-time openers on the senior selection committee ? easts Pranab Roy and V.B. Chandrasekhar of south.

 The tour of Zimbabwe, which begins later this month, features a tri-series (New Zealand being the third team) and two Tests.

 That Sourav is going to be back as captain was reported by The Telegraph, from Colombo, on Tuesday itself.

 According to well-placed sources in Mumbai, where the five-member selection committee met for around 100 minutes late in the afternoon, Chandrasekhar wanted Rahul Dravid retained and challenged the arguments put forward by Roy.

 Dravid captained India in the recent tri-series, in Sri Lanka, as there was uncertainty over Souravs availability owing to a six-ODI ban. Eventually, the punishment got reduced and Sourav played the last three matches there under Dravid.

 Roy, one learns, received complete support from the two Sharmas ? norths Yashpal and Gopal of central.

 Chief selector Kiran More (west) gave Roy and Chandrasekhar freedom to express their views and, then, advocated that the captaincy be handed back to Sourav as the majority favoured just that.

 The captaincy issue wasnt put to vote, or else Chandrasekhar would have formally dissented.

 Realising he was in a losing battle, Chandrasekhar even floated the (absurd and team spirit-threatening) idea of two captains: Sourav for the ODIs, Dravid in Tests.

 It fell on Roy to knock that for a six.

 Roy highlighted Souravs record as captain (hes the most successful in Tests, with a 50-plus win percentage in ODIs) and the passion he brings to the job, while Chandrasekhar argued Dravid shouldnt be removed after only one outing with independent charge. 

 Given that Chandrasekhar is Tamil Nadus nominee, one isnt sure whether he fought out of conviction or opposed Sourav because hes from Jagmohan Dalmiyas Bengal.

 In intra-Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) politics, Tamil Nadu and Bengal are at opposite ends.

 Whatever, Sourav has to regain consistency with the bat ? and in both forms. Indeed, going by Chandrasekhars vehement opposition, he cant take anything for granted.

 Its too early, then, to say whether Souravs second innings in the hottest seat after the Prime Ministers will continue till the 2007 World Cup. 

 Significantly, coach Greg Chappell (who briefed BCCI secretary S.K. Nair and More before the selection meeting) maintained he was neutral on the captaincy issue.

 However, Chappell probably also did say he was happy with Dravid in Sri Lanka. That was his maiden assignment.

 Sourav, captain for over five years till the International Cricket Council-imposed ban in April, began the day keeping fingers crossed. 

 Much later, on learning of his appointment (from the TV, incidentally), he said: Im happy? It feels good, but Im thinking about the team and not myself?.

 Sourav added: We need to improve and Im looking forward to a partnership with Greg and, of course, Rahul.

 Asked whether he had plans to celebrate, Sourav replied: Id rather wait for us to win the tri-series and the Tests?

 Sourav leaves for Mumbai in the morning to be present when the tri-series and Test squads are picked in the afternoon. Tomorrows selection, by the way, is going to be this committees last. 

 Its to be seen whether all five selectors retain their own berths after next months AGM.

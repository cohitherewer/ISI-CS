 Spy witness backs off

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 4: A Pakistani who had testified against Sarabjit Singh says he was forced by police to lie in court.

 Salim Shaukats father, Shaukat Jaan, was killed in a blast outside Lahores Malik Cinema on May 18, 1990. Salim was produced as prime witness by the prosecution to prove that Sarabjit, whom it identified as Manjit Singh, was involved.

 In an exclusive interview to STAR News, Salim has said he was taken to the court by the police and forced to make false statements against the accused.

 I am not sure if he is responsible for the blasts, Salim said. You know that the police can make you say anything.

 Asked whether he was tutored by prosecution lawyers, Salim said: I was told by the lawyer that I should identify Sarabjit as the main culprit for the serial blasts, and I did it.

 Salim admitted that Sarabjit had contested his claim.

 The moment I identified him as (the) culprit, Sarabjit asked me to swear by the Quran. But I declined to do so.

 Sarabjit was looking at me after my testimony, but I was helpless as I was under the influence of (the) law enforcement agencies.

 Salims latest statement is expected to be included as additional evidence when Sarabjits Pakistani lawyer files a petition before the countrys Supreme Court, requesting a review of the death sentence on the Indian.

 The witnesss retraction comes after Pakistani officials repeatedly claimed that Sarabjit got a fair trial and was convicted on the basis of the strongest possible evidence.

 A year after Sarabjits arrest in Pakistan in 1990, an anti-terrorist court sentenced him to death on the charge of carrying out serial blasts on behalf of Indias Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). The sentence was recently upheld by the Pakistan Supreme Court, triggering a public outcry in India for Sarabjits release.

 His family in Punjab insists that Sarabjit was never known as Manjit, had never worked for RAW and had stumbled across the border in a drunken state.

 The surge in public sentiment has prompted Delhi to request Pakistan to look into the familys claims and treat Sarabjits case on humanitarian grounds.

 Salim today echoed the sentiment, saying: I feel that Sarabjit Singh should be let off whether or not he was involved in the crime.

 Sarabjits lawyer, Rana Abdul Hamid, has cited many legal discrepancies in the way the Indian was prosecuted.

 A statement of confession Sarabjit apparently made but denied during trial was presented before the court; but it mentioned neither the case number nor the FIR number. It did not say where and how Sarabjit was arrested.

 Lawyer and human rights activist Asma Jehangir, too, has said the Indian was tried on the basis of a blind FIR that did not mention the name of the accused.

 In one of the cases ? the Chowk Bhatti Gate blast case ? the prosecution had submitted a list of 89 witnesses but only 18 testified.

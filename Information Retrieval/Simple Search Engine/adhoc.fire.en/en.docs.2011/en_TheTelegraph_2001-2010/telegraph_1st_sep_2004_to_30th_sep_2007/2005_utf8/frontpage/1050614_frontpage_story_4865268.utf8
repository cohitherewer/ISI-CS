 Spat over spit in posh school

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, June 13: When a student spits, its time to spit fire at the teachers.

 A student who spat on the car of a parent for backing onto him has prompted one of Delhis most expensive schools to launch a purge that is fanning whispers of a racial conspiracy.

 A part of the top management at The British School has been removed after news of the indiscipline reached the board of governors.

 The senior management team ? deputy director Shalini Advani, business manager Anuja Bansal and International Baccalaureate coordinator Maya Norula ? has been replaced citing lack of competence. The deputy director is also the principal of the secondary division.

 However, a section of parents ? they have a big say in running the school whose annual fee ranges from Rs 87,000 to Rs 160,000 ? has questioned the move to discipline the teachers.

 Some parents are smelling a plan to replace the faculty with white members. 

 If the school was so badly run, why is it that only the Asian members have been sacked? Why is the Australian director (principal) Ian Bayly still continuing in his post? a parent asked.

 That the board took the decision at the fag end of its tenure is also adding fuel to the fire. What was the need to sack them in a hurry? The school will reopen only in August when a new board and chairman would be in place, another parent said.

 The British School is governed by a society founded by the parents. 

 The board of governors is elected from among the parents and it includes two representatives nominated by the British high commissioner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 Amitabh rests, industry waits 

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Calcutta, Nov. 29: In 1982, it was Bangalores St Philomenas hospital and Mumbais Breach Candy hospital. In 2005, its Escorts in Delhi and Leelavati in Mumbai.

 The patient is the same, so is the concern.

 This time, Amitabh Bachchan is not fighting for his life like he did 23 years ago after being punched in the abdomen on the sets of Coolie. But the abdomen is the bother again.

 If the pain in stomach is being put down to an irritation of the intestine or colitis, the stretchered look could have more to do with nine months of non-stop action, according to the medical team tending to the superstar.

 The medical shackles have been able to keep the actor down but Bachchan is apparently restless to return to the sets of Kaun Banega Crorepati 2.

 He was slated to shoot with us for KBC from November 30 till December 3, take a break on December 4 and then again shoot on 5th and 6th. 

 Just before being admitted to the Delhi hospital, he told us he was going in for some tests and he could only take a decision when the reports were out. Since he has been advised bed rest, shooting from Wednesday is ruled out, said Deepak Segal, executive vice-president, content, STAR India. 

 The last time KBC shoots got cancelled ? for the July 26 Mumbai rains ? Bachchan had shot an extra episode a day to make up for lost time.

 We have software till the middle of December and we really dont need to panic, revealed another STAR spokesperson.

 On the film front, Bachchan was scheduled to start shooting for Ravi Chopras Babul from December 10. We are all set to start. But if he cant shoot right away, thats not a problem, Chopra said. 

 Whatevers happened to him is because of fatigue and if some rest helps him, nothing like it. We will adjust the dates.

 Before that, on December 9, the latest Bachchan-starrer, Ek Ajnabee, will hit theatres worldwide. Trade analysts feel that the renewed buzz around Bachchan would give an additional lift to the movie.

 A week ago, Bachchan had told The Telegraph: I am very fortunate that this year has gone so well and am really thankful that at 64 roles are being written for me.

 Now, till hes back on his feet, shooting rosters will be rewritten for him.

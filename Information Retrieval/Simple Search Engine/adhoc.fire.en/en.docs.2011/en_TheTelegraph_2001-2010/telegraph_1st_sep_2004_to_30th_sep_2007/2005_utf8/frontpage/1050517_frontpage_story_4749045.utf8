 India arms Hollywood

 Mumbai, May 16 (Reuters): Next time you see a Hollywood actor brandishing a sword or an axe in a period film, chances are that some of those weapons might have come from India.

 The worlds movie capital is the latest to join a growing list of US producers to outsource products and services to India to rein in ballooning costs.

 Kingdom of Heaven, a Crusades epic from Gladiator director Ridley Scott, features combat gear made by a small firm in Dehra Dun.

 Windlass Steelcrafts, which set up shop in 1943 to supply daggers to the British Army in India, also made weapons and costumes for Troy, Lord of the Rings and The Mummy Returns.

 There are many more big-budget period films being made that we will supply to, as our firm is now well-known to Hollywood studios, said I.K. Chadha, a senior official of the company.

 Kingdom of Heaven has struck a chord in the Arab world, where cinemagoers say it has challenged the Hollywood stereotype of Arabs and Muslims as terrorists.

 Windlass is one of several Indian firms looking to benefit as US studios ship out more functions to cut costs.

 Indian animation firms, which provide cartoon film footage and animated computer images for television, cinema and the Internet, have taken advantage of low costs to grab work from Europe and North America.

 India is also encouraging US studios to shoot films in its more exotic locations and use its studios and low-cost workforce for production work.

 Most recently, parts of The Bourne Supremacy and Oliver Stones Alexander were shot in India.

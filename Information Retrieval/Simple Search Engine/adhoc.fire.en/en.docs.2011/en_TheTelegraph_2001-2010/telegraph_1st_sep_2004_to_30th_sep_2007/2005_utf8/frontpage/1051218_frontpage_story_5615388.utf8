 Salem custody extended

 Mumbai, Dec. 17 (PTI): An anti-terror court today extended the police custody of Abu Salem in the Pradeep Jain murder case on a plea by the anti-terrorist squad of Mumbai police.

 The squad said it needed to investigate whether the weapons used in the murder were part of the arms consignment smuggled into the country for the 1993 Bombay blasts.

 Designated judge P.V. Bavkar extended police custody of the extradited don till January 3.

 Seeking Salems custody, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said Salem had revealed during interroga-tion that arrested co-accused Riaz Siddique had accompanied him to the residence of film actor Sanjay Dutt to hand over arms before the 1993 blasts.

 However, defence lawyer Ashok Sarogi opposed the demand, saying the anti-terrorist squad had got all the information it needed from Salem and there was no need to extend his police custody.

 Nikam alleged that defence lawyers were trying to sabotage the investigations by making false allegations against the squad. 

 He referred to allegations that Salem was under pressure not to sign his bail petition. 

 Nikam argued that the defence lawyers should be restrained from meeting the don.

 Budget facts with Mallika figures

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA 

 Mallika: Stats fundas

 Mumbai, Feb. 26: Perhaps, there is no better symbol than her when it comes to vital statistics.

 This year, the budget will also be on MTV. The channel is going to air a session on the annual event that it has more or less bypassed in previous years ? and Mallika Sherawat will be one of the panellists. 

 Sharing the platform with her on the show, called MTV and CNBC Budget Fundas, will be industrialist Adi Godrej. 

 Mallika?s colleague from the entertainment world Zayed Khan and new-age Congress MP Milind Deora will give them company on the one-hour session to be aired on March 3.

 The channel is also talking to actor Fardeen Khan and director Farhan Akhtar to drop in.

 But what made MTV choose Mallika who shot to fame with 17 kisses in one film and topped it up in Murder by disclosing her personal assets in innerwear? 

 The youth, says the channel.

 ?It?s not as if the young people have come and asked us for a budget programme. But they are far more focused on money than before. Many of them are multi-taskers. They work, they study, they earn,? says Vikram Raizada, vice-president, MTV Networks.

 ?This is the first time we are airing a special session on the budget,? he adds. 

 The channel warns that though funnyman Cyrus Broacha will co-host the show, it is not going to be ?fully faltoo?. 

 ?We are inviting a group of young people to interact with the panel on the show, which will be shot after the budget. They are expected to raise questions on every issue related to youth. It could be about mobile phones and films, but also about education and career and what the budget has to offer to them,? says Raizada. 

 ?From our interaction with them, we have found that the youth ask about clothes and cellphones, as well as informed questions about education and tax cuts,? says an MTV spokesperson.

 What insight can the audience expect on the budget from Mallika? ?We don?t expect her to be an expert. But she, like the other panellists from the entertainment world, is young and an achiever. They will be expected to bring a fresh perspective,? says the spokesperson.

 Yo!

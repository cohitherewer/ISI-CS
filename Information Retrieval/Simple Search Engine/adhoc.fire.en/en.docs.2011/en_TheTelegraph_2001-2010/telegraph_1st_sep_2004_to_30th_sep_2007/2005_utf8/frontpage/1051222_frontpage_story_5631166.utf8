 Bid to open Nepal door

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The chief of the Indian Army has invited the chief of the Royal Nepal Army to visit India, a move that conveys to Kathmandu Delhis willingness to pick up the threads of a military relationship despite the diplomatic frostiness after King Gyanendras coup of February 1.

 The invitation ? if accepted ? is a diplomatic move through the military channel. Last week, foreign secretary Shyam Saran visited Kathmandu.

 India is now watching when the RNA chief will fit a trip to India into his schedule after successive visits to China and Pakistan.

 County relief for captain

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav: Excited

 Calcutta, May 25: Sourav Gangulys summer of 2000 stint with Lancashire didnt exactly ignite Old Trafford, but the regular Team India captain is hoping his two-month contract with reigning one-day champions Glamorgan impacts significantly.

 Sourav signed up with the (Division 1) Welsh county late last evening and heads for Cardiff tomorrow ? thus far, Ravi Shastri is the only Indian to have worn the Glamorgan colours.

 As the county has lost the first five Championship matches, Sourav will be under pressure to deliver straightaway.

 Australian Matthew Elliott is the other overseas pro. Last summer, he had compatriots Michael Kasprowicz and Nick Lewis for company. 

 Yes, theres a bit of excitement? I havent played for over a month-and-a-half and now have an excellent opportunity to get back into quality cricket, Sourav told The Telegraph.

 Speaking from London shortly after Glamorgan chief executive Mike Fatkin announced the signing, Sourav added: Ive been itching to get onto the park and didnt think twice when the county contacted me yesterday morning?.

 The contract may get extended if the ICC doesnt relent on the six-ODI ban slapped last month. 

 If it remains, then Sourav is out of the tri-series in Sri Lanka and can extend his stay in Cardiff by a fortnight.

 Sourav, for his part, didnt wish to talk about the ban. Look, I cant appeal afresh and have left it to the BCCI? Today, my priority is to quickly settle down in Cardiff, he said.

 Wife Dona and daughter Sana are with him and they, too, head for Glamorgans HQ and a county-provided flat at the crack of dawn.

 Given that Sourav gets embroiled in controversies, its no surprise both BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra and secretary S.K.Nair have insisted theyre in the dark.

 Fact is Sourav telephoned immediate 

 past president Jagmohan Dalmiya for advice and 

 was asked to quickly address a formal request for an okay 

 to Mahendra. There appears to have been a communication 

 gap somewhere.

 Rape on Marine Drive

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, April 21: A 17-year-old college girl was raped inside a police post by a drunk constable on Marine Drive?s famous promenade bustling with evening walkers.

 Krishna Kujmar Tiwari, who, too, was taking a stroll, heard the screams of the girl emanating from the small wooden structure and rushed to her rescue with other passersby. 

 In the crowd were three teenage boys who were accompanying the girl when the constable took her in for ?questioning?. 

 Police said the girl, from Chembur in the northeast suburbs, had appeared for her first year junior college exams and was walking with her friends at sunset.

 The constable, Sunil Atmaram More, went over to the group and asked why they were loitering. He called the girl to the police post and asked the three boys to wait outside. 

 When Tiwari heard the screams and forced open the door, the shocked girl said the constable had raped her. The 30-year-old man was in a state of undress and a bottle of liquor was lying inside.

 Police sources said More had a history of alcoholism and had been warned.

 Shaken by incident that dented Mumbai?s reputation as a safe city for women, police commissioner Anami Roy said: ?Our first priority is to ensure that legal procedures are correctly followed to ensure the case results in a conviction.?

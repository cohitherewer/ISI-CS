JU not out of trouble 

Calcutta, June 30: A day after a settlement 

was reached between students and teachers in Jadavpur University, a fresh agitation 

is brewing.

Unless the administration provides a satisfactory 

explanation for the June 10 police crackdown by next week, the faculty of 

engineering and technology students union (Fetsu) is threatening unrest, 

once more. 

This time, however, the movement will take a more 

peaceful form, minus boycotts, Fetsu leaders said. 

Despite student demands, the five-member probe team 

refused to hold a discussion on the police action in yesterdays meeting.

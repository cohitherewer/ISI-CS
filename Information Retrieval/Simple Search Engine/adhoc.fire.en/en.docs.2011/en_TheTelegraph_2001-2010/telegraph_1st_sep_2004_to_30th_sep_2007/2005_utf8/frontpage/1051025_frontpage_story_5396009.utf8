 Dark caution on bright day

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 24: Sunshine after six days of rain brought a smile to most faces, except of those at the Met office.

 They warned of another round of wet weather two to three days from now with the formation of a cyclonic upper air circulation over southwest Bay of Bengal off the Tamil Nadu coast.

 The system has the potential to organise further. If it intensifies, rainfall may occur in Calcutta and the coastal districts after two or three days, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.

 Around 2 pm, the first rays of the sun pierced through the cloud cover that had enveloped the city since Wednesday, true to the forecast the Met office had made yesterday.

 But weather officials remained glued to the radar watching the cyclonic circulation that swirled over the sea in the early hours of Monday. 

 The cyclonic circulation is likely to develop into a low pressure and move up towards the Bengal delta like the previous one. We are very worried, an official said.

 Officials, however, did not expect heavy rain in Calcutta in the next 24 hours. The weather office recorded only 2.7 mm rain between 5.30 pm on Sunday and 5.30 pm today.

 The trough of low pressure (which had spanned the entire eastern coast) has shifted, causing improvement in weather conditions in Calcutta and rest of Bengal, said an official.

 The moisture that accumulated over the city and the districts for the past five-six days could still cause rain in the next 24 hours.

 We expect the sky to remain cloudy and light to moderate rain in coastal districts in Gangetic Bengal, including Calcutta, said Debnath.

 Bahree jobless, father cries foul 

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, June 25: Kkaran Bahree was sacked by Infinity eSearch today for allegedly selling personal data of customers of British banks, but his father said he had been framed.

 S.K. Bahree alleged his son was set up by Sameer Asim, a call centre worker and associate of The Sun reporter Oliver Harvey, who did the sting operation on Kkaran.

 Infinity eSearch said it had dismissed Kkaran, who used to earn Rs 10,000 a month, to help the law take its course and had provided all the information to Haryana police.

 We held an emergency meeting of our board today and have decided to terminate the services of Kkaran Bahree. We do not need to give him any notice period since he was on probation, company legal counsel Deepak Masih said.

 The Bahrees modest, second-storey flat in Delhis Dilshad Garden was dark with all the curtains drawn. S.K. Bahree, insisting that Kkaran was not home, wouldnt open the iron meshed door but spoke to The Telegraph through it.

 TT: Can I speak to Kkaran?

 Bahree: What is it?

 TT: Is he at home?

 Bahree: No, he has gone out. May I know who you are?

 TT: I am a reporter.

 Bahree: We dont want to speak to reporters. Please leave us alone.

 TT: Dont you want to give your version?

 Bahree: My son has been framed. He is innocent.

 TT: Who framed him?

 Bahree: The reporter like you and his acquaintance.

 TT: Who is Sameer?

 Bahree: An acquaintance of not more than a few days.

 TT: Dont you feel it would be good if Kkaran can tell me that? We can present his version.

 Bahree: Leave your phone number and address. I will ask him to call you.

 TT: Have police from Delhi or Haryana visited your house?

 Bahree: No. But has a case been filed?

 TT: I dont know. But London police have said they do not have jurisdiction to arrest a person in India. So Indian police have to take action.

 Bahree: Can you give me a written statement of London police? Please courier me the information. Please do?.

 Cyber law expert Pawan Duggal said: Kkaran Bahree can be charged under Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, and under the Indian Penal Code for theft, criminal breach of trust and cheating. He could perhaps also be charged with conspiracy.

 Kkaran was a quiet person and would be either home or in the shop behind the building that sells mobile phones, a neighbour said.

 He used to meet many people at the mobile phone shop and discuss technical matters with them, added the local grocer.

 He would ask for peoples phone numbers and copy them on another mobile.

 Bathless for 72 hours

 Amitabh Bachchan couldnt have a bath for 72 hours, wife Jaya complained on Friday. Her husband and son Abhishek were stuck at their Juhu home, Prateeksha, without power and drinking water, she added. 

 Five-feet water gushed into the ground floor and basement. Water level rose up to the dining table. It took eight hours to pump out water from the basement and ground floor.

 Soccer soars above game

 - Liverpool back from wilderness with miracle at Istanbul

 May 26: Back in India it 

 was well past midnight, eyes were sleep-laden and the match 

 on the telly was dissipating into a no-contest. Hernan Crespo, 

 the Argentine forward, had just coolly slotted home the 

 second goal for AC Milan.

 Its not known on which side Indias sympathies lay, but no matter how much the admiration for the evergreen Paolo Maldini or amazement at the Brazilian Kakas midfield brilliance, a fair number would have been silently praying for the underdogs in red, Liverpool.

 Until the second goal. For many that was the time to hit the bed and for most a few minutes later when Crespo struck the third in the Champions League final that decides the best team in Europe. Maldini had opened the score with the fastest goal in a European Cup final with a volley in the first minute.

 At halftime, some Liverpool fans were crying but there were some who sang: Were gonna win 4-3.

 No one believed them. So while most of India was sleeping, an English club ? not yet sold to a Russian, like Chelsea, or an American, like Manchester United ? performed miracles thrice, 3-1, 3-2 and 3-3, within six minutes and then went another step in Istanbul.

 Playing its first European Cup final in two decades, Liverpool survived a torrid half-hour of extra time and won on penalties, coming back from the dead not in this match alone but as a footballing power. It has gone 15 years without winning the domestic league after having dominated European football in the late 1970s and 80s.

 A measure of that domination was in evidence last night when Liverpool took home the trophy, having won it five times.

 Who would have known? Least of all Michael Owen, the baby-faced Liverpool and England forward who went to Real Madrid this season, hoping to end years of watching fellow English teams, Man U, Arsenal and Chelsea, play in Europes top tournament on the telly in the team dressing room and contemplating the future.

 Steven Gerrard, now the Liverpool captain, was in that crowd of watchers, too. He stayed, Owen didnt. The millions more Owen is earning at Real will not buy him a touch of the European Cup Gerrard was softly kissing last night after leading the unheard-of second-half fightback with Liverpools first goal and setting up the third by winning a penalty. 

 Real, Europes star team, went out of the championship as Liverpool, the team from an English port town that had fallen on bad times from the position of a thriving industrial centre, journeyed quietly through the rounds to enter the quarters and then the semifinals.

 The Reds met the Blues ? Chelsea, the English league champions which cost its Russian owner millions of sterling pounds.

 When Liverpool won that, too, its fans were not heard singing Money cant buy you football glory, but they could well have, taking inspiration from their citys most famous quartet. Money cant buy me love, the Beatles had sung.

 If further evidence were needed, look no farther than Gerrard, who said he felt on top of the world. Both Chelsea and Real are apparently interested in signing him, but after the victory, he said: Im going to talk very soon with the chairman and the manager but its looking good.

 The match and its aftermath are overlaid with irony. Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, who saved two penalties in the shoot-out and was very much the hero after Gerrard, will be leaving at the end of the season.

 On the other side, for Maldini, at 36 ? though he still looks as if he could carry on in Milans defence for some years ? last nights could well be the last Champions League final. In the end, Milans defence was made to appear a trifle too slow before a Liverpool that threw at it more than just football skill.

 And then the final irony, after a heroic night. European footballs governing body said Liverpool would not get to defend their title because they do not even qualify for the Champions League next year.

 Liverpool finished fifth in the English Premier League and England is allowed to send only the top four teams to the European tournament.

 Tonight, however, that will not be on Liverpool citys mind when their champion team parades through the streets on an open-top bus.

 Some are saying the victory mirrors the rebirth of the city following decades of high unemployment and urban decay. Northern England has reinvented itself as a destination for tourists and innovative business after struggling when its old industries started dying during the 1980s.

 And the city that produced the Beatles believes its latest stunning sporting success will aid its own recovery.

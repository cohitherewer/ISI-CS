 Talks on Pak tour

 Islamabad, Feb. 8: The Pakistan Cricket Board today confirmed a meeting between its chairman Shaharyar Khan and BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla but denied this had anything to do with the rejection of Ahmedabad as a Test venue.

 Shukla, in Lahore to attend a wedding, however, told PTI over phone: ?We have held positive talks. I am hopeful that Pakistan will play in Ahmedabad.?

 BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said ?we will be flexible? and try to ?accommodate? the visiting team?s concerns. ?We are discussing the issue with PCB officials. We have to find a solution that is acceptable to everyone,? he said from Thiruvananthapuram.

 Wedding bells for lost groom

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 10: Rajiv Bhattacharya, the 31-year-old groom who disappeared two days before his marriage, is tying the knot after all.

 The marriage has been fixed for Sunday, June 12, his father Saroj Bhattacharya said today. 

 The London-based IBM employee went missing on June 1 from Ultadanga ? sparking fears that he had been kidnapped ? and turned up at Mughalsarai on June 3, the day of the wedding. 

 Bruised and appearing disoriented, Bhattacharya claimed he had been abducted, drugged and beaten up. But police were not convinced. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee even made a public announcement on Monday that this was not a kidnapping at all.

 Rajiv has recovered sufficiently and has expressed his willingness to marry before he leaves for London, his father said. Family sources added the reception would be held in a hotel in the Park Street area.

 Till then, he will stay at home. Rajiv will not go out of the house till Sunday, said cousin Partha Chakraborty. He is still recovering and is mentally and physically extremely tired and needs complete rest.

 Bhattacharya was scheduled to return to London on June 13, but family members said the date is likely to be deferred. We are yet to decide on that, his father said. 

 The bride, Suparna Chakraborty, will not accompany him to London. Earlier, too, it was decided that she would join him later in London as it would take some time to organise the visa, a family member said.

 Bhattacharya had arrived in Calcutta from London on May 29 to get married to Suparna. The match was fixed in February. 

 Mystery shrouds the grooms disappearance, which led to the arrest of his driver, but police are not pressing any charges. Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police, eastern suburban division, said Rajiv is a free man. 

 We wish him all the best.

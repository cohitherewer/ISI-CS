 US bid to split 

India team

 - American games on UN reform

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, June 17: Even 

 as national security adviser M.K. Narayanan arrived here 

 yesterday for crucial talks with the Americans, the Bush 

 administration has hatched a diabolical plot to split the 

 Group of Four (G4) seeking the expansion of the UN Security 

 Council and wean India and Japan away to its side.

 Feigning American help in getting India into the Security Council, Nicholas Burns, the new US under-secretary of state for political affairs, yesterday announced that the Bush administration would likely support adding two or so new permanent members to the council, based on (a) set of criteria. 

 Listing the criteria, he said the size of a countrys economy is important, the size of its population, its military capacity, its potential to contribute militarily to UN peacekeeping missions... its commitment to democracy and human rights, its financial contributions to the UN system, its record and commitment on counter-terrorism, its record and commitment on non-proliferation and we have to look, of course, at the geographic balance, overall, of how the Security Council is constituted.

 The US representative to the UN, Anne Patterson, will expand on these criteria and speak on Tuesday at the UN General Assemblys general debate on reforming the world body.

 Yesterdays news conference by Burns has given the impression that the Bush administration supports Indias claim for a permanent seat in the Security Council, a commitment American officials have repeatedly refused to make in public.

 To what extent the administration comes out openly in support of India on Tuesday will very much depend on its talks with Narayanan today and on Monday. What the White House and the state department are looking for is to delay the G4 resolution on Security Council expansion, which is to be tabled next week in the UN General Assembly as soon as Nirupam Sen, Indias permanent representative to the UN, returns to New York from Doha, where he is lobbying Third World leaders at the South Summit for Indias case at the UNs high table.

 Yesterday, as latest assessments in New York concluded that the G4 resolution had a fair chance of passing in the General Assembly with a two-thirds majority, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice made another desperate call to Japans foreign minister, Nobutaka Machimura.

 Burns said Rices call was to tell him that we very much support the candidacy of Japan to become a member ? a permanent member of the Security Council.

 He did not say that Rice asked Machimura for the second time this month to delay tabling the G4 resolution.

 Japan has stood its ground. I think they (Americans) threw a difficult curve ball that at first glance looks favourable yet also problematic, Machimura said later.

 We cannot say thats right and jump on to the US proposal as we have been in the G4 campaign, he added.

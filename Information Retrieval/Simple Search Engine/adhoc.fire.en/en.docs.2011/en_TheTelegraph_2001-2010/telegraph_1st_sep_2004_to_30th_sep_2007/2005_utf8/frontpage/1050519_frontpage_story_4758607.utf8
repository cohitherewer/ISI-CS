 Result relief in city

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 18: The verdict is out and the anxious wait over for more than 40,000 teenagers in the city.

 Calcutta has a pass percentage of nearly 96 in ICSE and ISC examinations, according to the results announced today.

 Officials of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations said in New Delhi that Calcutta figured on the list of the top seven cities that had the highest performers in the Indian School Certificate (ISC) examination.

 Calcutta also accounted for the maximum number of examinees who appeared for the Indian Certificate for Secondary Education (ICSE) examination from a city.

 The eastern region, comprising Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Assam, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Tripura and Sikkim, has notched a pass per cent of 92.8 vis-?-vis the national percentage of 94.24 for the ICSE examination. The corresponding pass per cent figure for the eastern region for the ISC examination is 92.69 per cent vis-?-vis the national 93.57 per cent, said the councils education officer, Meera Agarwal, from New Delhi.

 J.K. Sen, the principal of Julien Day School and general secretary of the Association of Anglo Indian Schools, said: Most of the reputed schools are located within Calcutta, so Calcuttas performance is much better than the rest of the eastern region.

 Girls have fared better than boys in Calcutta and throughout the country. There has been a marked improvement in the girl-boy ratio with an increase in the number of girls appearing for both the examinations. There are also fewer dropouts among girls than boys this year, Agarwal added.

 Principals of city schools expressed satisfaction with the results. Our students have done very well and we have a pass percentage of 100 in both the ICSE and the ISC. We are working out the details, said Hilda Peacock, the principal of La Martiniere for Girls.

 A quick tally with the principals revealed that the students performed extremely well in humanities.

 The information we have received from various city schools till late evening shows students have scored good marks in English. Most girls schools have performed very well, said Gillian Rosemary Hart, a council member and the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School.

 But some science students were disappointed. In the science subjects, it was somewhat disappointing for the brighter ones who have not lived up to expectations, said Sister Ursula Darcy, the principal of Loreto House.

The father of an ISC student from Don Bosco, Park 

Circus, said his sons marks in mathematics and chemistry were too low.

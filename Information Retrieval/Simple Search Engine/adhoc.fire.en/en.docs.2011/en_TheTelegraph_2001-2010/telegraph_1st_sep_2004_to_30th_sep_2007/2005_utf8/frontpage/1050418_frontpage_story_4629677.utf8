 Gifts for all shades 

 Not many will agree that the best gift India gave Pervez Musharraf was the cricket win, but it was a day of presents all right.

Manmohan Singh handed him a painting of Naharwali 

Haveli in Old Delhi where Musharraf spent his early childhood.

The Prime Minister also gave the Pakistan President 

his birth certificate and of his elder brother and sister, all of whom were born 

in Delhi. The papers were bound in leather .

In return, Musharraf presented Singh with a silver 

engraving of Lahore enclosed in a wooden box .

 Musharraf had an unusual gift for L.K. Advani. He brought along an album of photographs from Advani?s school days in Pakistan. 

 Advani said it was a ?precious? gift. Both had studied at Karachi?s St Patrick, about which they chatted for a while. 

 Sources said Advani is likely to send a return gift tomorrow.

 Longer run for tech teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The All India Council of Technical Education has allowed faculty members at engineering and management institutes under its wing to teach till they are 70. Till now, the retirement age used to be 60.

 Barring the IIMs and IITs, government as well as private engineering and management institutes are governed by guidelines set by the AICTE.

 The council sanctioned 211 new institutions for 2005-06, creating 23,651 seats. It also restored 31,945 of the 39,540 seats slashed in colleges that failed to meet norms. 

 CBSE exam reforms

 The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has become the first council to formally approve a timetable for examination reforms intended at reducing stress.

 Grades will replace marks for students appearing for the Class X board examination in 2008. From next year, students will get more time to go through the question paper.

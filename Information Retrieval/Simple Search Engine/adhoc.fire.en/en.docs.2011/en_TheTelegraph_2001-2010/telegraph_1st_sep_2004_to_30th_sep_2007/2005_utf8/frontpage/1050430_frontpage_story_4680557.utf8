 Ranchi/Jamshedpur, April 29: Unhappy with the management accounting paper, students appearing for their B.Com (Part III) examinations today went on the rampage in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, tearing up answersheets and preventing others from writing the test. 

 The students alleged that the question papers had been changed all of a sudden in violation of both the syllabus and the pattern without any prior warning.

 In Jamshedpur, trouble started around 2.30 pm in Karim City College, where students from Cooperative College and ABM College were taking the test. As soon as they were handed out the question papers, the students demanded a re-examination. 

 The college authorities tried to reason with them but the students went berserk and tore off the papers. The students then reached Jamshedpur Women?s College and forced the candidates from Graduate School College for Women to boycott the exam. 

 ?It has been a fixed pattern when it comes to the management accounting paper. According to the set pattern, there are five theory questions and as many practical questions. Usually, the students opt for the practical questions as they fetch more marks. Today when the question paper was given to us, we found that of the 10 questions, eight were theory and only two were practical. Moreover, many questions were out of the syllabus,? said a student who was among the first to storm out. 

 The agitation soon spilled over to Graduate School College for Women as another section of students from Jamshedpur Co-operative College tried to disrupt the test. 

 The college campus turned into a battlefield as girl students ran for cover, some of them jumping over the main gate to escape. In the melee, the college gate was broken. 

 Police wielded lathis, injuring 15 students.

 In Ranchi, trouble erupted in similar fashion at Women?s College, where students of Gossner College were writing their test. As soon as the question papers were distributed, some students walked out. 

 The agitated students went to St Xavier?s College to swell their ranks. Soon they were joined by their counterparts from J.N. College, Dhurwa. ?They barged into the college and forcibly entered the examination hall. They began snatching papers from the students writing the examination. When the invigilators tried to intervene, they were thrashed,? said city deputy superintendent of police Kumar Ravishankar. 

 Ranchi University vice-chancellor S.S. Kushwaha said there was no question of a re-examination. ?There is no question of a re-examination. We accept that the pattern has changed. But the students have got nothing to do with this. There are no questions that have appeared out of syllabus. The students want a short cut to success,? he said.

 Kushwaha has set up a two-member committee to probe into the violence.

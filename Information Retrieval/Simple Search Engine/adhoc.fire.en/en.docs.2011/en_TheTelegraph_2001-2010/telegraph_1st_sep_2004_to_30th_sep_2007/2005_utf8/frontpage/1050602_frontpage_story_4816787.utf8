 Indian hero in Gohars sights

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, June 1: Gohar Ayub Khan, who claims a brigadier sold plans for Indias 1965 war to his father for Rs 20,000, is trying to point the needle of suspicion at one of two war heroes ? one commanded a crucial formation in the war and the other is a legend.

 The former foreign minister of Pakistan is saying that one of these two officers was a traitor. This is the severest of charges that anyone can level against a soldier.

 Serving and retired officers are surprised at the alacrity with which defence minister Pranab Mukherjee directed army headquarters to investigate the allegation made by a hawk who infamously claimed in 1998 that Pakistan can win a war against India in two hours.

 The government has already directed an investigation. The army is doing an in-house verification on whether there is any authenticity or truth in the allegation. We will wait for more information to come from the author. It is not correct to jump to conclusions or to speculate, army chief General Joginder Jaswant Singh said today.

 Gohar Ayub had claimed that he would reveal the year the officer passed out of the Indian Military Academy and the regiment he belonged to. Quizzed this evening by The Telegraph with the year of passing and the regiment of one officer, Gohar Ayub said: I am not saying anything now. I have put it down in my manuscript and my book will be out in December.

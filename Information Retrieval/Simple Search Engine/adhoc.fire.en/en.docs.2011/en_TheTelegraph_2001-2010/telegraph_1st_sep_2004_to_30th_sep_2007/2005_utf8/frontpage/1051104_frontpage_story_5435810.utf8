 War games protest

 Nov. 3: Indian and US air force personnel today began inducting aircraft, equipment and crew at Kalaikunda in Bengal for two weeks of war games in the face of protests from the Left Front, which is unhappy with India-US military ties.

 The Left has announced that activists will protest outside the Kalaikunda air force station on November 7, the day the drill begins. CPM MP Amitabha Nandi today led a demonstration at Calcutta airport where aircraft were landing to prepare for the exercise. 

 Two IAF aircraft have landed at the airport in the last 24 hours, an official said, dismissing reports that a US aircraft could not land because of the CPMs protests. ( )

 DM plays Holi, on fire-tender 

 - Bhagalpur officer uses vehicle for celebrations

 A Holi reveller

 Bhagalpur, March 28: He wanted a big sprinkler for the festival and what bigger than a fire tender.

 Bhagalpur district magistrate Mihir Kumar Singh has triggered howls of protest from residents of this water-starved town by asking for a fire tender in which to play Holi on Saturday. 

 Sources said Singh called for a fire-tender at his official residence on the morning of March 26. Firefighters from the local unit were summoned and asked to pour colour into the water reservoirs of the vehicles. The pipes used to spray water were used to sprinkle coloured water by the revellers. 

 ?DM sahib asked us to pour colours inside the water reservoir of the fire-tender. He climbed onto the roof of the vehicle and asked us to use the pipes (which are used as fire extinguishers) as sprinklers,? said Rohon Yadav and Md. Sazlum, the two firemen assigned to do the ?colourful? job. 

 The colours in place, Singh went on a welcome tour greeting senior officials such as divisional commissioner Ajoy Nayak, inspector-general of police, Bhagalpur range, N.C. Dhondial, deputy inspector-general of police Rajesh Chandra, superintendent of police Rabindran Shankeran and the district and sessions judge, Bhagalpur, Parmanand Panday. 

 Singh was not available for comment. But a junior official in his office told The Telegraph: ?There is no need to make a hue and cry over it. We are also human beings and have the right to enjoy.?

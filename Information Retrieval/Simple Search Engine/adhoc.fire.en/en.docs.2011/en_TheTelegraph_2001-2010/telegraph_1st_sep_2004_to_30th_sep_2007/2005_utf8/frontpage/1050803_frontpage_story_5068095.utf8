 Provogue owner in drug net

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: Mumbai police today arrested the high-profile co-owner and promoter of popular night spot Provogue Lounge, swivelling the spotlight back on drug abuse in celebrity circles.

 Police say they have sufficient evidence of Salil Chaturvedis role in the drugs supply at the lounge bar ? frequented by Bollywood whos who ? that doubles as an apparel showroom during daytime.

 He will be produced at the Andheri metropolitan court tomorrow morning, additional commissioner Parambir Singh said. This is the ninth arrest in the case.

 On January 26, the police had detained Provogue employee Allwyn Sequeira, who was carrying vials of a powder in a parcel to be delivered at a Chennai address. The police suspected the powder could be cocaine.

 The Chennai address belonged to Vishal Maghnani, then an executive with Provogue Lounge. Maghnani, after dodging the police for months, was arrested on June 23.

 He told the police that drugs were freely available at several Mumbai night spots, including Provogue Lounge. He named as his clients a Bollywood actor previously booked in a cocaine bust, a music video director-turned-film-maker, a leading stockbroker and a media personality.

 Asked if the police will move against the celebrities named by Maghnani, an officer said: We will take action only on the basis of evidence.

 Provogues brand ambassador is actor Fardeen Khan, who was arrested for possessing cocaine in 2001.

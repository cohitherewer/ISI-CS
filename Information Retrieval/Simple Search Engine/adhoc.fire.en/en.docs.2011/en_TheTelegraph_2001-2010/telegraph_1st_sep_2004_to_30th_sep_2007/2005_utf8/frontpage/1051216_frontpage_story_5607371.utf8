The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage

 I am not quitting: Sourav

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 15: Sourav Ganguly may have been at the receiving end of a sledgehammer blow yesterday, but has recovered somewhat.

 The former Team India captain spent much of the day at home ? many hours, in fact, were taken up by the Satyanarayan puja. Later, he met Jagmohan Dalmiya for around half an hour.

 Theres plenty of tough cricket coming up? Im not quitting and Ill be working towards a comeback, Sourav told The Telegraph.

 He declined to say anything else, but has been touched by the moral support extended by fans across the country.

 Dalmiya, for his part, assured Sourav that the Cricket Association of Bengal would continue backing him to the hilt. Apparently, Dalmiya also said that while the recent board elections had reduced his clout, Sourav shouldnt feel he has been orphaned.

 Schoolboy murdered in flat 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 18: A Class XII student of a reputed English medium school in north Calcutta was found murdered in his second-floor apartment near College Street this evening, hands and feet tied, gagged and throat slit.

 The murder comes close on the heels of the killing of a widow who was living alone on Bishop Lefroy Road.

 Police said Ajay Agarwal was murdered between 1 and 2 pm when the 19-year-old was alone in his Surya Sen Street flat in the heart of the city.

 Three youths were found entering the house by a worker in a shop on the ground floor of the building and the police suspect the victim may have known his killers.

 Barun Mallik, the deputy commissioner of police, north division, said it appears to be a murder for gain. The killers had taken about Rs 1.30 lakh from the flat and some gold ornaments. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

 The police are quizzing the victims father, Anil, as he was the first person to detect the murder this evening when he returned home. No one has been arrested yet in connection with the killing.

 The Agarwal family has been living in the rented flat for the past 25 years.

 Anil, the deceaseds father, today called his son over telephone a number of times from his Burrabazar shop, but did not get any response. He called for the last time about 5.30 pm but this time, too, there was no response. 

 Anil returned home around 7.45 pm. The main entrance to the second-floor flat was open and the almirahs and other furniture in the house had been ransacked, said Jogesh Bhat, a next-door neighbour.

 Ajay, the only son of the hardware businessman, had gone to their Amritsar residence on June 2 with his mother and elder sister Mahek.

 He returned alone on June 15 to help his father run the family business.

 This morning, he left home at 7.45 am for tuitions and returned about 11.

 Ajay was last seen about 12 noon when some political party workers came to his house to give the family voters slips. Ajay himself had received the slips from the party workers and closed the door from inside, said Bhat.

 This is the second time in a fortnight that killers have struck when their victim was alone at home.

 On June 9, Laxmi Sundaram, a 71-year-old widow, was found dead in her Bishop Lefroy Road residence, her hands and feet tied and strangulation marks on her neck. No arrests have been in the widow murder case but the police have said the assailants may have been known to the victim.

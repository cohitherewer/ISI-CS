 India bar on private colleges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Centre has decided to crack down on the misuse of the label Indian by private educational institutions.

 Names such as the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, one of several high-profile new generation business schools, could be at risk.

 It has come to notice that several institutions are using the word Indian prefixed to the name, which is not permitted in terms of Section 3 of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1950, a government communication said. 

 The communication was sent to the All India Council of Technical Education and the University Grants Commission by the human resource development ministry.

 No person shall use or continue to use any name which may suggest or be calculated to suggest the patronage of the government of India or the state governments for trade or profession without the permission of the Centre, the act says.

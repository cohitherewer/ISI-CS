 - Former skipper makes Test team but did not figure on Chappells original list

 Calcutta, Nov. 23: Sourav Ganguly has retained his Test berth, for the first match against Sri Lanka, but as an allrounder and not a specialist batsman.

 Its a crushing demotion for somebody with over 5,000 Test runs and yet another signal from the national selectors that Sourav must perform big if he has his sights on the remainder of the 2005-06 season and beyond.

 Predictably, the former Team India captains fate dominated the nearly four-hour meeting ? a record by itself ? in Chennai today.

 The selectors (chairman Kiran More, Yashpal Sharma, Pranab Roy, Gopal Sharma and V.B. Chandrasekhar) as also coach Greg Chappell and captain Rahul Dravid began with a general discussion before taking a break for snacks.

 That done, the real business started with the selection of the 15 for the last two ODIs versus South Africa. As expected, no changes were effected.

 Then began the over two-hour discussion on the 15 for the seasons first home Test.

 According to The Telegraphs sources, Sourav didnt figure in the squad drawn up by Chappell ? hed left one slot, which eventually went to Sourav, for any fast bowler.

 The coach isnt just focusing on the 2007 World Cup, but is concerned about Test cricket. Left to him, Sourav wouldnt fit anywhere.

 Dravid, one understands, kept himself away from the Sourav-specific discussion. He told the selectors: Ill be happy with whoever you choose.

 At some point, though, Dravid is bound to get firm. After all, in India or elsewhere, the captains neck is on the line.

 Apparently, Sourav didnt make any of the seven slots earmarked for batsmen. A suggestion was then made that he be considered as an allrounder.

 That ate up time with More (rightly) pointing out that all along Sourav had been picked as a specialist batsman. One other selector held a similar view.

 Slotting Sourav, therefore, became a headache with those not favourably disposed towards him being reminded that somebody with a hundred in his second-last Test innings ought not to be dropped faster than a hot potato.

 Eventually, even Chappell went along with the majority view. Had a vote been taken, a 3-2 verdict (in Souravs favour) was assured if not a 3-1 with one abstention.

 The captain and coach dont have a vote, but their views are respected. Thats how it should be.

 Sourav may have won a battle ? with behind-the-scenes help from backers within the Board of Control for Cricket in India ? but the war is far from over.

 Its anybodys guess whether the deposed captain actually has the mental strength to overcome the pressure thats bound to grow by the day ? till he scripts a memorable performance.

 Moreover, he has to share the dressing room with Chappell ? quite clearly the boss now. Its to be seen how the bitterness of Zimbabwe is forgotten.

 Not that it influenced the selectors (they werent in the know till after the meeting), but Sourav took five for 64 in Maharashtras first innings in Pune.

 That would have given some satisfaction, but being retained as an allrounder seems to have left him depressed. 

 Asked to react, he told the local media: Im not giving any positive or negative reaction. Please allow me to play (the Ranji match).

 More, of course, emphasised more than once that Sourav had been selected as an allrounder and that his inclusion meant (quick) Zaheer Khan couldnt make it.

 Till not too long ago, Sourav was hailed as Indias most successful Test captain. Now, he has to fight with prot?g? Zaheer for a berth.

 Its bizarre.

 The selectors, by the way, deserve kudos for continuing with dashing wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and promising quick Rudra Pratap Singh.

 Theyre the only rookies in the Test 15.

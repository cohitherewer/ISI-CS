 Police raid Pataudi houses 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 June 10: Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudis houses were raided today after he failed to present himself before Haryana police by the 5 pm deadline in the black buck poaching case.

 Hours after the deadline expired, the former cricket captains bungalow in the capitals upscale Vasant Vihar and his ancestral homes at Pataudi in Haryana and Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh were raided.

 An FIR had been filed against Pataudi and seven others by Haryana police after carcasses of a black buck ? an endangered animal ? and two rabbits were found in their vehicle during a routine highway check at Jhajjar, 65 km from Delhi, last Friday. 

 The Vasant Vihar residence of another accused, Sashi Singh, was also searched, the Haryana police inspector heading the six-member team to Delhi, Swatantra Singh, said.

 A servant at the Pataudi home could give no clue to his whereabouts, Singh added.

 Search parties have also been sent to Bhopal, Hyderabad and Gurgaon.

 Jhajjar district police chief Hanif Qureshi said the accused had been given enough time. 

 Although they were caught with the carcasses, the accused had been allowed to go after they assured the police that as responsible citizens, they would cooperate in the investigations as and when required, he said.

 Even after extension of the deadline, no one has come. It is only their lawyer who is here, he said.

 Pataudis lawyer Shyam Sunder Goyal said it was unlikely the former captain would present himself now. 

 He will move court for anticipatory bail. That is his right, he said. He might approach the environment court at Faridabad tomorrow, Goyal added. There were also reports that he could move Haryana High Court.

 Shashi Singh had applied for anticipatory bail in the Jhajjar court on Thursday, but was told the application could be filed only in Faridabad.

 One accused, Madan Singh, has been arrested.

 Killing a black buck is punishable with a minimum prison term of three years, that can go up to seven years.

 The police had earlier this week recovered the blue Maruti Gypsy in which Pataudi was caught with the carcasses from his Delhi residence.

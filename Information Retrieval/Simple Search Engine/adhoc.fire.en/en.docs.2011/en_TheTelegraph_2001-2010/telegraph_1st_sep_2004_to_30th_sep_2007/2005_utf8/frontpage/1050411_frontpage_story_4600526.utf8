 Asian century knocks

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, April 10: When two pagodas ? one for hardware and one for software ? come together, the Asian century is born.

 ?If india and China cooperate in the IT industry, we will be able to lead the world IT industry and when the particular day comes, it will signify the coming of the Asian century of the IT industry,? Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said here.

 Although a dissident Tibetan breached security and climbed a tower of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in protest against the Premier?s visit, Wen?s trip to Bangalore will be known for his vision of India and China ruling the world of information technology and science.

 All day, Wen chanted the mantra of partnership.

 At Tata Consultancy Services, he said cooperation between the two countries could be ?just like two pagodas ? one hardware and one software ? and combined, we can take the leadership position in the world?.

 Although a trip to India?s technology capital has become customary for visiting dignitaries, Wen?s words made his nearly as important as the political part of his engagements that began in Delhi this evening.

 Even that appeared to be going well with national security adviser M.K. Narayanan telling STAR News tonight that ties between the two countries were poised for a ?great leap forward? with the two sides agreeing on a three-tier process to resolve the boundary dispute.

 Narayanan said he had a ?very good meeting? with the special representative of China, Dai Bingguo.

 China wants to take relations beyond simply resolving the boundary dispute with hugely expanded economic cooperation.

 ?If we believe that the development of the IT industry symbolises the future of science and technology and the economy, then the cooperation between our countries to develop the IT industry will symbolise the prosperity of our two nations in the future. That day will come,? he said.

 Wen spoke of collaboration again ? suggesting a joint committee for science and technology ? at a meeting with directors of India?s six science institutes at the IISc.

 ?He gave us an impression that China and India could use science and technology to bridge the relationship between the two countries. He suggested a joint steering committee on S amp;T and continuous exchange of students,? Goverdhan Mehta, director of IISc, said.

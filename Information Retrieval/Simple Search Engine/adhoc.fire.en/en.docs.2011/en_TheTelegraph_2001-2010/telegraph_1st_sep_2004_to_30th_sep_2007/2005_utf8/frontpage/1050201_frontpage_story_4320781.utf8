 Law students assault principal

 SHIV CHARAN SINGH

 Ranchi, Jan. 31: Law examinees went on rampage on Monday afternoon, severely assaulting the principal of Sanjay Gandhi Memorial College, Pandra, 11 km from here. They broke the furniture and manhandled other college employees after the principal expelled two examinees for ?cheating? and refused to revoke the decision.

 Around 458 examinees of the Chotanagpur Law College were appearing for paper V of the first semester examination. The university promptly cancelled tomorrow?s examination and announced that the examination venue was being shifted to Ranchi College, where exams would resume on February 5.

 The university also declared that there would be no re-examination for the abandoned paper and each examinee will be awarded zero mark for their unruly behaviour.

 A shocked vice-chancellor, S.S. Kushwaha, refused to meet a delegation of students and said that he was ashamed. He also bitterly complained of non-cooperation by district officials, who, despite prior information, had made no provision for security at the centre.

 College authorities have lodged a named FIR against four students at the Sukhdeo Nagar police station.

 The shaken SGMC principal, B. Mahato, recalled that he had personally caught the two examinees cheating and decided to expel them. One of them demanded to be spared as he was the son of an under-secretary. ?I told him that the rules were the same for everyone, at which they began to shout and scream.?

 While the principal tried to leave the examination hall, the examinees dragged him back and started assaulting him. When he managed to escape and ran outside, they chased him there too before the college staff rescued him.

 Other examinees, meanwhile, started breaking the furniture. They abused the staff, manhandled even women and snatched blank answer sheets. Both the police and the university were alerted but while the police arrived after an hour, nobody turned up from the university, the principal complained. ?Finally, we had to go to the university office and report to the VC,? Mahato said.

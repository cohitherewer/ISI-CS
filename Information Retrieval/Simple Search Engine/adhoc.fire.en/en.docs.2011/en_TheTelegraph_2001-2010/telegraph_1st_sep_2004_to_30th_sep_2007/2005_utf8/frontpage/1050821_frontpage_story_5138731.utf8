 New Delhi, Aug. 20: Rolls- Royce Motors, which has returned to India after 50 years, launched its super luxury sedan ? Phantom ? in the capital today.

 The price tag, ranging between Rs 3.5 and 4 crore, makes the car cheaper than the Rs 5-crore-plus Maybach, launched by DaimlerChrysler in India in 2004. 

 The Phantom, which can be made to order from nearly 4,500 colours, was launched in Mumbai earlier this year.

 Rolls-Royce is also considering the launch of a convertible model of the sedan in the near future. The RR02 convertible model should be ready for a worldwide release in 2007, said Colin Kelly, Rolls-Royce director, Asia Pacific. 

 Equipped with a six-speed transmission, the car is powered by a custom-made 6.75-litre V12 engine with 48 valves, which offer huge torque, propelling the Phantom effortlessly from 0-100 km per hour in a mere 5.9 seconds.

 The luxury car maker, which until now had sold only one Phantom in India, targets to sell 10-12 units this year. Across the globe, Rolls-Royce Motors is represented by 70 dealers in 25 countries. 

 Rolls-Royce sells nearly 800 cars a year all over the world.

 The Phantom made its international debut in January 2003. It is manufactured at Rolls-Royce Motors new head office and manufacturing plant in Goodwood, West Sussex, England.

 The car maker has an old association with India and until 1955 around 730 Rolls- Royce cars had been sold to Indian customers. 

 Among other standard features found in most luxury cars, this sedan is also equipped with a four-wheel anti-lock braking system and a GPS navigation aid with a full map and voice information system. 

 The manufacturers of this premium luxury car began work on the Phantom in 1998 after the Rolls-Royce brand moved into the BMW fold. 

 Depending on the level of customisation sought, there will be a waiting period of up to six months for the Phantom, said Kelly.

 In India, the company has appointed Navnit Motors as its exclusive dealer in Mumbai.

 Recently, many luxury car makers have shown interest in the Indian automobile market for the huge potential it holds. DaimlerChrysler already has a plant in India for its Mercedes brand while it also sells the Maybach. 

 Audi is all set to enter the Indian market and Bentley is already here. 

 BMW has also shown interest in setting up a manufacturing facility in India.

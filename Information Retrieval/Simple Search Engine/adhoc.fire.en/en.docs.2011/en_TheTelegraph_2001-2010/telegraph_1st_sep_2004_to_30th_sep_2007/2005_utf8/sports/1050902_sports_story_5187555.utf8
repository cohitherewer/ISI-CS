The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kartik may have some role

 - Kaif set to retain No. 3 position; No move to promote Dhoni 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Murali Kartik

Calcutta: With top gun Virender Sehwag fit, Yalaka Venugopal Rao has to be out of the Team India XI during Fridays return tri-series match against New Zealand. 

However, The Telegraph learns that despite failing in successive matches, Venugopal could still be accommodated as the super sub and may get one more innings. 

Venugopal was the (very first) super sub in the disastrous match versus New Zealand, last Friday, and figured in the XI against Zimbabwe on Monday. 

Hes a youngster and, as important, doesnt lack character. For example, he didnt mind opening the other day. So, if an opportunity can be given, he wont be denied, a well-placed source pointed out from Harare. 

The other super sub contender ? and a strong one ? is left-arm spinner Murali Kartik. 

Apparently, he will get that slot if Sourav Gangulys mind is made up on batting first. Of course, to be in a position to choose, the captain has to win the toss. 

Souravs mind, though, isnt going to be clear till just before the coin is spun. He will wholly be guided by the conditions prevailing then. 

Meanwhile, its not confirmed, but it seems Mohammed Kaif is going to retain the No.3 position. 

Vice-captain Rahul Dravid took guard there in the tri-series opener, with Kaif getting promoted on Monday. 

Kaif took his time, but top-scored with 65. 

Right now, theres no move to promote Mahendra Singh Dhoni and the innings will be launched by Sourav and Sehwag. 

Like Sehwag, the captain was under the weather for the past couple of days, but has recovered to take on Stephen Fleming and Co. 

Beating Zimbabwe isnt a big deal, defeating New Zealand is whats going to count. 

THE INDIAN LINE-UP 

Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Mohammed Kaif, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ajit Agarkar, Irfan Pathan, Jai Prakash Yadav, Harbhajan Singh, Ashish Nehra. Super sub: Murali Kartik/Yalaka Venugopal Rao.

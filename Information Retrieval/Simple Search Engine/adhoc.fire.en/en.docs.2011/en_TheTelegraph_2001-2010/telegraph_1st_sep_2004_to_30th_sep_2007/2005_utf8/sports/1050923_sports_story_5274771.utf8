 Jeev cards par round 

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh was brilliant with the putter, but little else worked for him as he came back with a par round of 71 despite needing just 24 putts in the first round of Yen 120 million Acom International Golf Tournament on Thursday. 

At the Ishioka Golf Club, Jeev slotted as many as six birdies and six bogeys, three of both on either nine of the course to be tied 53rd. 

The leader was New Zealands David Smail, who had a flawless seven-under 64 with four birdies on back nine after starting from tenth and three on the front nine of the course. 

Jeev putted like a dream with 11 single putts, but he managed just 44 per cent greens in regulation. He did manage 10 of the 14 fairways, but his iron play let him down. 

Three players, Yeh Wei Tze, Yoshikazu Haku and Mamo Osani were tied for second at six-under. (PTI)

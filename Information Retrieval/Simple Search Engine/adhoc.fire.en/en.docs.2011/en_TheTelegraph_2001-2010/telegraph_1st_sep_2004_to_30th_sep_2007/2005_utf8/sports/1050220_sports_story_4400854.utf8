 IN THE CITY

 Compton Dutta was present during Mohun Bagan?s practice session on Saturday morning but Pradip Chowdhury didn?t drop in. Both, however, said that they won?t offer coach Subrata Bhattacharya any advice unless he seeks any. Dutta and Chowdhury were on Friday issued letters by club officials requesting them to serve as advisors to the team management.

 Chowdhury didn?t come to the ground because he was not clear about the role he was expected to play. Chuni Goswami, another pure Mohun Bagan loyalist, didn?t get any letter from the club but still made an appearance to offer some pep-talk. 

 BBYS beat Xaverians 62-48 in a first division state basketball league match on Saturday. Satinder Singh netted 21 points for BBYS , Vikas Agarwal an identical tally for the losers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sharapova loses 0-6, 0-6

Indian Wells: Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova was buried 0-6, 0-6 by top ranked Lindsay Davenport in the semi-finals of the women?s Pacific Life Open on Friday. 

Kim Clijsters continued her remarkable comeback from wrist surgery with a crushing 6-4, 6-2 victory over fourth seed Elena Dementieva. 

Third seed Andy Roddick earned an Australian Open re-match with Lleyton Hewitt, beating Carlos Moya 6-7, 6-4, 6-1 in the quarter finals. 

Roddick, who will face Hewitt after the Australian received a walkover when Andre Agassi withdrew from their quarter final with a swollen toe, blew a 4-1 lead in the first set tiebreaker, before he seized control of the match. 

?I felt good even after I lost the first set?, said Roddick, after his huge serve, precision volleying and impressive groundstrokes won him the match. ?I was hitting the ball well and I?m glad I stuck it out.? Hewitt beat Roddick in the 2005 Australian Open semi-finals and the American is looking for revenge. 

?It will be a blast, Roddick said. (REUTERS)

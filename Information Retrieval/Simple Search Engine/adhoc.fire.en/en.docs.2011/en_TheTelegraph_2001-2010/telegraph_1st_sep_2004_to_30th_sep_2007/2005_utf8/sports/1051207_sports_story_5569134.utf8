Chennai: Greg Chappell is not worried about Indias pathetic batting performance in the opening Test of the series against Sri Lanka. 

The Sri Lankans bowled well and the conditions were difficult for batting. I am not worried about the batsmens failure. We shouldnt read too much into it. Weve learnt our lessons and should work hard at them, the Team India coach said at the post match media conference on Tuesday. 

We have to look at getting more runs on the board. I hope the conditions will be better in Delhi, said Chappell. 

In the one-dayers too we came back after losing the opening match against South Africa. Theres no reason why we cant improve from here, he added. 

Chappell reiterated that Virender Sehwag not getting big scores doesnt worry him. Its not a big issue. Hes been getting the starts. He will get the big one somewhere in this series. He, though, remains the highest scorer among the Indians, he remarked, laughing. 

Maravan Atapattu was pleased with the performance. We needed a good start badly. We had lot of discussions back home after the one-day loss. Things have now fallen into place and hopefully it will continue. 

The conditions were not best suited for batsmen. The ball was keeping a bit low. We were more disciplined in our bowling. In the end, we were satisfied, said Atapattu, who is better after spraining his ankle Monday. 

We had some plans in place and it is working. This was a much-needed showing. It will give us the confidence going into the series, the Lankan captain added. 

On Muttiah Muralidharans show, Atapattu said: We expect Murali to bowl well on any wicket. But Im more happy with leg-spinner Malinga Bandaras performance. 

Hes got a wicket after seven years. It shows how tough and cruel this game can be, he said.

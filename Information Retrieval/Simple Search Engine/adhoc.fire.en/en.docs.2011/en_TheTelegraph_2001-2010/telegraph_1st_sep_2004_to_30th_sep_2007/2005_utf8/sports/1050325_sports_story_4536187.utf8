 Ferrari new car in Bahrain

London: Formula One champions Ferrari have decided to bring forward the race debut of their new car to Bahrain on April 3 after Renault ran away with the first two Grand Prix of the season. 

?We?ll take two new cars to Bahrain,? said a Ferrari spokesman after a meeting at the Maranello factory Thursday. 

Ferrari had planned to debut the F2005 in Spain in May, the fifth round of the season, after starting with a modified version of the title-winning F2004 that triumphed in 15 of 18 races last year. 

Renault?s early season form and the F2004?s obvious lack of relative pace forced their hand, with champion Michael Schumacher testing the car for the first time at the Mugello circuit on Wednesday. Renault lead the constructors? championship with 26 points while Ferrari have 10. (Reuters)

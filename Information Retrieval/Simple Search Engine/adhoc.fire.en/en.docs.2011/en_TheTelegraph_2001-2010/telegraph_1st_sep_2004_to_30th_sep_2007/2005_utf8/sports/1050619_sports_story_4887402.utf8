 Titles for Gasquet, Clijsters 

Nottingham: Fourth seed Richard Gasquet celebrated his 19th birthday by winning his first ATP Tour title with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Max Mirnyi in the final of the Nottingham Open on Saturday. 

The French teenager, who was treated to a rendition of Happy Birthday To You by Mirnyi and the centre court crowd, follows in the footsteps of compatriot and world No. 26 Sebastien Grosjean. 

Meanwhile, in Eastbourne, former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters completed a happy comeback from injury when she beat Russian qualifier Vera Douchevina 7-5, 6-0 in the final of the Eastbourne WTA tournament. 

Belgian Clijsters, who missed most of last year with a wrist problem and then suffered a knee injury soon after her first comeback in March, picked up a prize of $93,000 in the Wimbledon warm-up.

 India stay put

New Delhi: India shared the 135th spot with tiny European nation Andorra, who moved up three places, in the latest Fifa rankings. India havent budged from their May standing. 

While India were held to a 1-1 draw by 175th ranked Pakistan last week, Andorra were thrashed 1-8 by world No. 2 ranked Czech Republic on June 4 in a World Cup qualifier. The Indian footballers take on Pakistan in the second match of the National Bank series in Peshawar Thursday.

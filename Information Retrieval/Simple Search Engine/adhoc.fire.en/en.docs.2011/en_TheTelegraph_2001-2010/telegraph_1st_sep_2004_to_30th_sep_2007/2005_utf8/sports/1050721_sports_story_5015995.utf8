 Ronaldo may quit after World Cup 

Los Angeles: Star striker Ronaldo says he could call it a day for Brazil after the 2006 World Cup in Germany. 

Itll be my fourth World Cup and I have to let younger players take their chance, said the 28 year-old who won the Cup in 1994 and 2002 but lost in the 1998 final to France. 

Ive four more years on my contract with Real Madrid and then Ill finish my career. 

Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira agreed with his striker. I respect his decision. I think hes right. If he does go he will go when hes at his peak, said the coach, who is looking forward to guiding Brazil to a sixth World Cup and second under his management after the 1994 triumph.

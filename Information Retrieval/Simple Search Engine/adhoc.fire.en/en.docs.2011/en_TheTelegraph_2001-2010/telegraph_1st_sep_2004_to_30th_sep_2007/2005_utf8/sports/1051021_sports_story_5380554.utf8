 Spin duo routs South Zone

 Ramesh Powar took 4/78 

Vadodara: South Zone were bundled out for a meagre 219 runs in only 82.4 overs but hit back to reduce West Zone to 4 for two on the opening day of the four-day Duleep Trophy match at Motibaug Palace Ground on Thursday. 

The main wreckers of Souths first innings were the Wests spin duo ? Mumbai off-spinner Ramesh Powar (four for 78) and leg-spinner and skipper Sairaj Bahutule (2 for 65), who now plays for Maharashtra. 

Pace bowler Zaheer Khan gave West an early breakthrough with the wicket of South opener S. Asnodkar (0) in the third over of the innings before South captain V.V.S. Laxmans prize wicket was claimed by Munaf Patel. 

South were reduced to 54 for three by the 25th over after being asked to bat first by Bahutule. 

They recovered through a stubborn 81-run stand for the fourth wicket between Tamil Nadu left handers Sridharan Sriram, who made a painstaking 43 in 250 minutes off 167 balls, and Hemang Badani (42 in 156 minutes off 109 balls). 

Both were dismissed by Bahutule. Sriram was brilliantly caught by Satyajit Parab while Badani was trapped in front by the leggie. 

India Test stumper Dinesh Karthik propped up the lower order by making a quick-fire 34 off 40 balls with a six and two fours before Powar sent him back and mopped up the tail. 

Brief scores 

South Zone 219 in 82.4 ovs (S. Sriram 43, H. Badani 42, D. Karthik 34; R. Powar 4/78, S. Bahutule 2/65). West Zone 4/2 (L. Balaji 2/3).

 It hurts, says Shaun Pollock

 Ricky Ponting in Melbourne on Wednesday 

Melbourne: World XI captain Shaun Pollock said pride would inspire his side to perform better in the second ODI against Australia following their 93-run loss in the first match on Wednesday. 

Chasing 256 for victory, the star-studded World XI line-up collapsed to 162 all out with seven of the top nine batsmen failing to reach double digits. 

Its disappointing, Pollock told a news conference. We spent a long time discussing our roles and responsibilities and we didnt get it right tonight. 

I have to say that its now a challenge and we are going to have to play like one hell of a team to come back from 0-1 down. There is a lot of pride in this team and they are hurting in the dressing room right now. 

Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara (64) and Andrew Flintoff (38) were the only ones to provide any resistance to a four-pronged Australian attack that was led superbly by Glenn McGrath (two for 13 off seven overs) and Shane Watson (three for 43). 

These guys are proud cricketers and no one likes to go down like that. We arent here for the crowd or the media, were here for ourselves and everyone wants to win, Pollock said. 

Australian captain Ricky Ponting said the manner of his sides victory proved they were still the best in the world despite losing the Ashes to England last month. 

If you read the newspapers, all of the World XI guys have been saying that we are still the best side in the world, Ponting said. 

We have copped quite a lot since we got back (from England). Some was fair and some was unfair and I thought we showed what we can do tonight and that we are still a very good cricket team. 

We came up against a very good side and we outplayed them. 

Ponting said he didnt have to specially motivate his team for the match, merely reminding the players it was the perfect opportunity to show the Australian public what they could do. 

Everyone was up for the challenge and the motivation was there for us that this was the first chance for us to go out and express ourselves, and thats what we did, he said.

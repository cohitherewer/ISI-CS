 Sania bows out

New Delhi: Sania Mirzas Wimbledon preparations faced a set back when she bowed out of the DFS Classic meet in Birmingham in the second round on Tuesday, losing to third seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia Montenegro in straight sets. 

The 18-year-old Indian failed to avenge her loss to Jankovic, who had defeated her in the Dubai Open earlier this year, as she lost 1-6, 5-7 in one hour and nine minutes, according to information received here. 

Sania had her chances in the first set but failed to convert as many as three break points, while Jankovic broke her opponents serve thrice in four chances that came her way. 

After losing the first set, Sania came back strongly with two breaks and led 4-3 at one stage in the second set. 

But the Hyderabad Open winner soon surrendered her advantage as Jankovic broke back to make it 4-4 and then threatened to take the match when she had four match points in the 10th game. 

Sania made it 5-5, but Jankovic again hit back, forcing two more match points in the 12th game. (PTI)

 How cricket changed Enamul

London: A decade ago life changed completely for Enamul Haque. 

In 1995 the Bangladesh left-arm spinner, one of his countrys primary attacking weapons in the first Test against England at Lords this Thursday, lost his father and discovered cricket. 

All my life I have had to struggle, Haque, 18, said in an interview this week. 

My father died when I was young and it changed everything. He was a businessman in Dubai and one day news came that he had suffered a stroke. It was so sudden. 

Then I became the man of the house and my mother, sister and I had to rely on a lot of help from our relatives to get by. After that I had to lead a very disciplined life, I couldnt ask for anything and had to do everything my mother asked. 

In the same year an elder boy Enamul considers a virtual brother, took him along to play in a local cricket match. 

They used to have these tennis ball cricket tournaments and I went along one day and really liked it. I had had little to do with cricket before then, but I decided I would become a spinner. 

Events moved fast as Enamuls friend Imon, a wicketkeeper in a Sylhet division team, introduced him to league cricket. When England toured Bangladesh in 2003, Enamul, who idolises New Zealands Daniel Vettori, distinguished himself with a five-wicket haul in a practice match. (REUTERS)

 Chingoka, Bvute arrested

Harare: Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) chairman Peter Chingoka and managing director Osias Bvute has been arrested and placed in custody, police said on Tuesday. 

They have been charged with contravening sections of the Exchange Control Act and will appear in court soon, chief superintendent of police Oliver Mandipaka said. 

Chingoka and Bvute went with their lawyer to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in central Harare on Monday and after questioning, were taken into custody. 

It was their third visit to the Reserve Bank in the last two weeks. 

The ZC office bearers are being represented by Wilton Manashe, who was unavailable for comment. 

Asked who would be running ZC in the absence of Chingoka and Bvute, media manager Lovemore Banda said: I have no idea. 

ZC vice chairman Justice Ahmed Ebrahim, who will now stand in as chairman, was unavailable for comment. He is due to chair a meeting on Wednesday of all national players, several directors, provincial chairmen and other stakeholders.

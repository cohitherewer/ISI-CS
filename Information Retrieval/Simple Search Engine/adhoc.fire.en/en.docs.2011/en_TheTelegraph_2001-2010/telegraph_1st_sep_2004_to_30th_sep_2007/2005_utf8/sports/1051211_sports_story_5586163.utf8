 Sachin made full use of talent: Kambli

President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam led the nation in congratulating Sachin Tendulkar on achieving the world record of 35 Test centuries. In a message from the Rashtrapathi Bhawan, the President wished him success and strength to achieve many more such feats. Here are a few of other messages: 

JAGMOHAN DALMIYA (EX-BCCI PRESIDENT): My heartiest congratulations to Sachin for creating the world record of most number of centuries in Tests. What pleases me most is that an Indian has created history by surpassing the world record of another Indian great. Like the entire country, I am proud of Sachin. 

VINOD KAMBLI (FORMER INDIA PLAYER): I am very happy Sachin broke Gavaskars record, and I want him to score so many centuries in his Test career that the record remains unconquered. I am happy hes reached the milestone at last. 

He must have been feeling the pressure. Sachins very strong mentally and has made full use of his talent. Thats what differentiates him (from the rest). His approach to the game has remained unchanged all these years. 

SHARAD PAWAR (BCCI PRESIDENT): This spectacular achievement would do every Indian, especially cricket lovers, proud. Hopefully, this feat will put to rest apprehensions about his performance. Sachin is the only player who has scored more than 10,000 runs in both the versions of the game. 

MANMOHAN SINGH (PRIME MINISTER): For many Sachins fans in India and world over, this is a long awaited and happy event. The entire nation hopes he will continue to delight with his sporting talents in the years ahead. We look forward to witnessing many more such records being rewritten in his sparkling career.

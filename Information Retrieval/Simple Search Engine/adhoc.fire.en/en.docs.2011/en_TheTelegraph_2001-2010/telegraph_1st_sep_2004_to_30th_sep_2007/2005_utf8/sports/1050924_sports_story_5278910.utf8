 Boxer dies of injuries 

New York: Former world lightweight champion Leavander Johnson died in hospital on Thursday, five days after suffering brain damage in a title bout in Las Vegas. 

The 35-year-old American collapsed while heading to his dressing room after he was stopped in the 11th round of a failed IBF lightweight title defence against Mexicos Jesus Chavez on Saturday. 

Johnson was rushed to hospital with bleeding on the brain, where doctors performed surgery, but he never regained consciousness from a medically-induced coma. His kidneys had failed and his heart had stopped beating when it was decided to remove him from life support.

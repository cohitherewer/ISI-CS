 Arjun Atwal tied 5th

Endicott (New York): Arjun Atwal carded a four-under 68 and stayed within striking distance of the leaders after the second round of the $ 3 million BC Open at the short-and-narrow En-Joie Golf Club course. 

The Indian, who was seventh after his seven-under in first round, spoilt his second nine with two bogeys and ended with a four-under 68 that gave him a two-day total of 11-under 133 to be tied fifth. 

The leader was a 49-year-old veteran David Edwards, playing only his sixth event of the year. Edwards had a nine-under 63 to follow up his first round 66 for a 15-under 129 total. He was one shot ahead of first-round co-leader Matt Hendrix, who shot a 67. 

Atwal started on the tenth and slotted birdies on the 13th, 15th, 16th to turn in three-under and at that was tied for the lead. He added one more on first, and seemed poised for another fine round. 

But two bogeys on sixth and seventh derailed Atwals plans before he made up with birdies on eighth and ninth to end four-under.

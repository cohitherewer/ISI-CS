 Fleming considers boycott

 Stephen Fleming 

Wellington: New Zealand cricket captain Stephen Fleming on Thursday said he was prepared to boycott the tour of Zimbabwe later this year if he felt it would make a difference. 

But he said the decision would not be a hasty one as there were three months to consider the moral issues. 

?If the information that I read suggests it?s probably not wise to go and that will make a difference, then that?s something I?ll consider,? Fleming said after leading New Zealand to an innings and 38-run victory over Sri Lanka in the second Test here. 

?Like the other players I?ll be reading a lot, watching the situation closely and trying to educate myself on what impact the tour will have. 

?The players will take a lot of care over the decision and make sure it?s the right one in their mind for the right reasons.? 

New Zealand Cricket (NZC) chief executive Martin Snedden has said the player would not be penalised if they individually decided not to tour as a protest against President Robert Mugabe?s government.

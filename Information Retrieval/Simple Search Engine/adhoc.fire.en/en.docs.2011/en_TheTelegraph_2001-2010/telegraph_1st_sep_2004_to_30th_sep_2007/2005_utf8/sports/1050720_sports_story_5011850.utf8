 Gagan Ajit, Kanwalpreet back in the limelight

 - Eight-Nation Meet Junior World Cuppers rested 

 Camp will decide Gagan Ajits fate, says coach 

New Delhi: Striker Gagan Ajit Singh is back from almost a year in the wilderness. On Tuesday he was named among the probables for next months eight-nation hockey tournament in the Netherlands. 

Gagan Ajit was out of favour following Indias disastrous show at the Athens Olympics. He was also suspended for three months for his unsportsman-like behaviour during the mens nationals in Hyderabad in March. 

The Punjab striker was named as one of the 26 campers announced by the Indian Hockey Federation. Those who represented India in the recent Junior World Cup were not considered for selection, because the selectors decided to give them a rest after a hectic tournament. 

The camp starts in Chandigarh Wednesday and continues till August 10. The August 14-21 tournament ?also comprising Pakistan, Germany, Spain, Australia, Holland, Korea and England ? will be held in Amstelveen. 

Like Gagan Ajit, his statemate Kanwalpreet Singh also made a comeback after being dropped following the Olympics. Kanwalpreet was also banned for two years after being found guilty of hitting Deepak Thakur with his stick during the Ranjit Singh hockey meet in February. But his ban was revoked last month by the IHF. 

The duos return was likely to give a boost to the Indians, who are all set to play in the eight-nation team with an under-strength side, as they did in the Azlan Shah Cup in Malaysia earlier this year. The juniors then were at the World Cup, and several new faces had represented India at the seven-nation meet in Kuala Lumpur. India finished fifth. 

Dependable mid-fielder Viren Rasquinha, who missed the Azlan Shah through injury, is also back. 

And there are several unheralded players, like Raghunathan and Gurtejpreet Singh. But coach Rajinder Singh Junior said over phone from Chandigarh: They are good players and I hope they will do well in the camp. 

On Gagan Ajit, though, Rajinder said: Its a good thing that he is back in the camp. But the camp will determine which player is selected for the Netherlands tournament. One has to perform well in the camp for getting a place in the team. Mere reputation wont help. 

On the absence of the juniors Rajinder said: I have been given a pool of probables by the selectors. I am not worried about who is there and who is not there. I will try to get the best result out of the players. 

However, Rajinder said in the absence of an expert drag-flicker ?both Sandeep Singh and Len Aiyappa have been rested ? he will try out new players in the camp to perfect the art of converting penalty corners. 

We have identified two-three players. Deedar Singh and Raghunath are likely to do the role in the tournament if they are selected. We have to think beyond Sandeep Singh and Len Aiyappa. We need a back up who can do the job. What if Sandeep got injured? 

The tournament, a warm-up for this years Champions Trophy in Chennai, has arch-rivals India and Pakistan in the same pool. 

The Asian giants share the pool a with European powerhouses Germany, the world champions, and Spain, the Champions Trophy winners. 

Olympic champions Australia are in pool B with hosts Holland, Asian Games champions Korea and England.

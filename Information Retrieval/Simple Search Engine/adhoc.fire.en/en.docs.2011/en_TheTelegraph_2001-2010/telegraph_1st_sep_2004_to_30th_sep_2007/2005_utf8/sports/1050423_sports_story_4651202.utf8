 Sasikiran slips to joint third

Copenhagen: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran missed out on his chances and could salvage a draw with GM Jonny Hector of Sweden in the sixth round of the Sigeman amp; Co. chess tournament, which has shifted here after completion of five rounds in Malmo. 

Dutch GM Jan Timman continued with his great form and defeated GM Viorel Iordachescu of Moldova to maintain his sole lead with five points out of a possible six. 

Following the draw, Sasikiran slipped to joint third with 4 points where he now has company of GM Curt Hansen of Denmark while Iordachescu is sole fifth on 3.5 points. 

Sasikiran failed to capitalise on his chances and conceded a draw after attaining a clearly superior endgame. 

Fortunes continued to favour Timman who proved too strong against Iordachecu. Playing Pirc defence as black, Timman found Iordachescu completely off-guard as the latter allowed black to get the dynamic balance he was looking for. (PTI)

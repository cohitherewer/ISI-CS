 Fewer playing hours to affect Tests: Inzy

 - England under pressure, claims Mushtaq 

 We have asked for well-balanced pitches, says Inzamam 

Lahore: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq fears that the outcome of the Test series against England will be affected by loss of overs owing to fewer playing hours. 

The weather will be a problem in Tests and a lot of overs are likely to be lost which will have a bearing on the results, Inzamam said on Monday. 

The Pakistan cricket Board (PCB) has scheduled all three Tests in the eastern province of Punjab in the cities of Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore owing to security concerns expressed by England about playing at other venues. 

The winter season, which has started in Punjab, may lead to reduced playing hours owing to early morning fog, dew and murky light before sunset. 

The first two Tests of the series have a starting time of 9.30 am (Pakistan time) and the final one in Lahore is 30 minutes later, but Inzamam expressed reservations that despite these measures, the teams would not be able to manage the scheduled minimum overs. 

The light gets bad 15 to 20 minutes before the scheduled sunset time in these cities. I also dont think a 9.30 start would be feasible because the early morning dew leaves the ground wet, he said. 

He also ruled out the possibility of spinners dominating the Tests to increase the chances of keeping up with over rates. It is a misconception that we are going to have totally spinning tracks for the Tests. I have not seen the pitch for the first Test but we have asked for well-balanced tracks, he added. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan leg spinner Mushtaq Ahmed has said Englands poor form with the bat has put them under pressure in the run-up to Saturdays first Test. 

England are a very strong and well-knit side at the moment. But they have struggled in Pakistan and it shows they are fallible, Mushtaq, who is back in the Pakistan team after a two-year absence, said. 

The 35-year-old, with 185 Test and 161 one-day wickets, said England batsmen were finding it difficult to adjust to the pace and bounce of Pakistani pitches. 

They will go into the first Test under some pressure after their batting problems, he said. We should take advantage and do well. 

Mushtaq, who plays for Sussex, said he was also under pressure on his comeback to Test cricket. 

Obviously it is not easy, you do feel the heat, he said. But I am confident I can make a strong comeback. I know their batsmen and that is an advantage. 

It will be interesting to see how England fare against us. They played Shane Warne well in the Ashes, it remains to be seen how they play us. 

In another development, the PCB is keen to host a Twenty20 match against England to raise funds for the earthquake victims.

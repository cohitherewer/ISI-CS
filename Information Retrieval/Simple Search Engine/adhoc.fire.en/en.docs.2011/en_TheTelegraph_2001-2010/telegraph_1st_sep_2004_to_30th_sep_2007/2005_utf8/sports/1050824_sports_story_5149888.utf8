The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Team India get down to business 

 - Greg organises workout soon after reaching Harare 

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

Calcutta: Team India got down to business immediately after landing in Harare on Tuesday. According to information received here, the players reached the Zimbabwean capital via Johannesburg around 5.30 pm IST and, within three hours, coach Greg Chappell had organised a workout for the entire lot. 

The players will be in Harare till Thursday morning, when they go to Bulawayo ahead of their tri-series opener versus New Zealand on Friday. 

It was learnt that captain Sourav Ganguly was not informed about a pre-departure press conference at 6 pm in Mumbai on Monday, so he planned accordingly and landed around 9 pm. 

The press conference had to be later rescheduled for 9 pm. Though it began with Chappell doing most of the talking, Sourav, too, fielded questions once he reached the venue at 9.15 pm. 

BCCI expresses unhappiness 

Agencies add: The chaotic departure of the Indian team, with some players reaching the hotel late Monday night, has upset the BCCI and coach Greg Chappell. 

The board is not happy with the (casual) attitude of some players. We are seriously thinking how to set this right, said BCCI secretary S.K. Nair. 

Mohammed Kaif and Harbhajan Singh checked into the hotel at around 8 pm. 

Also making a very late entry was Ajit Agarkar, despite being a Mumbaikar. 

Nair, meanwhile, explained that the BCCI wanted a short preparatory camp for the Zimbabwe-bound squad either in Bangalore or Mumbai, but had to drop the idea because of difficulties. 

This issue was discussed after the selection (on August 13). In Bangalore the stadium was not available because of the Twenty20 tournament. The Mumbai Cricket Association informed that due to rains no pitches were available for practice, Nair said.

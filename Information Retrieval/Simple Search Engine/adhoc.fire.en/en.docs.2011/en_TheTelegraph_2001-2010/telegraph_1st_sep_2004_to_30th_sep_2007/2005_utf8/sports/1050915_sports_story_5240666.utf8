Bulawayo: The stylish V.V.S. Laxman slammed a sparkling century as India put themselves on course for a mammoth first innings total and take control of the first Test against Zimbabwe on Wednesday. 

Laxman not only notched up his eighth century but also became the 10th Indian to aggregate 4000 Test runs as the visitors cruised to a comfortable 325 for three at close on the second day at the Queens Club ground. 

The Indians made amends for an insipid opening day show as they polished off Zimbabwes first innings for just 279, an addition of just 14 runs from their overnight score of 265 for seven. 

Paceman Irfan Pathan needed just 17 balls to snare up the three remaining Zimbabwean wickets to finish with an impressive five for 58, his fourth five-wicket haul in his brief Test career. 

The Indians then launched a blistering assault on the hapless Zimbabwe bowlers and maintained the momentum right through the day with Rahul Dravid (77), Virender Sehwag (46) and Gautam Gambhir (44) being the other notable contributors. 

Laxman, unbeaten on 125, had two important stands of 130 and 97 runs with Rahul Dravid (77) and Sourav Ganguly (23 batting) as India made the most of perfect batting conditions. 

Laxman arrived at the crease soon after lunch after opener Ghambir became the second Indian wicket to fall for 46. 

The genial batsman batted with uncommon caution till tea during which he only aimed to play in the V and cut out on his wristy strokes. 

Indeed it was Dravid who seemed in sublime form as he drove, cut and flicked with the stamp of a batsman who is regarded one of the best in the world. 

But Dravid departed after tea, cutting a ball too close on him to lone slip Brendon Taylor, having batted for 117 balls and hit 10 fours. 

But it was the signal which Laxman needed to shift a couple of gears in his batting effortlessly. 

Laxman took a heavy toll of Zimbabwe debutant off-spinner Gavin Ewing whom he pulled and lofted on the onside for boundaries but there were also sumptuous flicks off fast bowlers on the onside. 

Laxman finally reached his century with a cover driven four against Blignaut in the final hour and pumped his fist as if to show how much the innings mattered to him. 

Laxman is now the highest scorer for India in Zimbabwe, getting past Dravids 118. 

Sourav was cautious to start with but two fours off Heath Streak in one over also put him in course for a substantial innings. 

Zimbabwe opted for the second new ball with two overs remaining for the day but it didnt bring any cheers. 

So far Laxman has batted for 242 minutes and faced 186 balls hitting 18 fours. 

Earlier, Virender Sehwag had begun in his customary attacking fashion but his dismissal was also similar in the sense that a good start had been wasted. 

Sehwag had smashed six fours and a six from 48 balls on his way to 44 before a delivery from Blessing Mahwire sneaked between his bat and pad to hit the stumps. 

Gambhir too wasted a confident start when he flashed lordly from his position at a delivery from Mahwire and was plucked brilliantly by Brendon Taylor in the slips. 

Umpire Daryl Harper left the field midway through the second session and third umpire Russell Tiffin took his place in the centre. 

Harper wasnt to return for the rest of the day.

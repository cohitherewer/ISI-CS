Bangalore: Indias top 15 fast bowlers will be joined here on Tuesday by another group of probables for physical conditioning, ahead of the tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

The speedsters completed a week-long camp, which focused on their fitness, at the National Cricket Academy. From Tuesday till July 12, they will continue with their physical conditioning along with new entrants Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh, V V S Laxman, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Y Venugopala Rao, Neeraj Patel, Dheeraj Jadhav, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Dinesh Karthik, Parthiv Patel, Anil Kumble, Murali Kartik, Sridharan Sriram and Hemang Badani. 

Sourav Ganguly, Dinesh Mongia, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan, who are busy playing County cricket, are slated to join this expanded group on July 13 when the final phase commences focusing on cricket skills. This camp will run up till July 22. 

The pacers took a day off on Monday but not before interacting with noted dietician Lisa Sarah John. Charles Krebs has already interacted with some top bowlers. Krebs is working with the bowlers in the realm of mental and physical make-up. 

He is a specialist across the board of human performance, India coach Greg Chappell said. 

The pacers went through the paces for an entire week ? undergoing physical tests and other drills, swimming and an interaction with Australian pace guru Dennis Lillee over the weekend. 

Former India speedster Jawagal Srinath, who was also involved in the camp, was all praise for krebs. What he has been doing is fantastic. This will give multi-length perspective towards the game, which is good for the fast bowlers, we need them.

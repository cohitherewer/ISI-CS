 Chelsea mete out painful punishment

 - Liverpool coach pays for picking up a fight with the biggest bully 

Matt Dickinson

 Terry and Lampard at Anfield on Sunday 

Rafael Benitezs suggestion in midweek that Chelsea might be afraid of Liverpool sounded unusually boastful at the time. By the end of a torrid Sunday afternoon, his remark could be described as wishful thinking (if you were being kind) or, bluntly, as utterly ludicrous. 

Benitez and his players had picked a fight with the biggest bully in the playground and, at Anfield, Chelsea meted out painful punishment. They did not outplay them ? they rarely do ? but they totally overwhelmed them in the end; first with goals, then with their celebrations and, lastly, with a barrage of statistics. 

Gerrard, Gerrard, whats the score? the Chelsea fans sang, throwing some humiliation into the mix. 

The goals came from Frank Lampard, from the penalty spot, Damien Duff, Joe Cole and Geremi. The celebrations involved every one of Jose Mourinhos players as they demonstrated the value of an eighth consecutive victory in the Barclays Premiership by gathering in a huddle in the centre circle. Their delight was not just in putting Liverpool back in their place (currently below Newcastle United) but in retaining one of their biggest weapons, the air of invincibility. 

As for the statistics, Mourinho deploys them like Didier Drogba to batter his teams opponents. This was their 37th league match unbeaten (of which 31 have been won) and they remain on course to match the best ever start to a top-flight campaign of 11 consecutive victories. 

We have more points, more victories, more goals than anybody else, the Chelsea manager said. What more do people want? 

The question was, presumably, rhetorical so do not tell Mourinho that the country will not have been swooning at his teams performance. 

They will have admired the ceaseless endeavour of the midfield, in which Michael Essien threatens to make even Frank Lampard and Claude Makelele look like slouches. They will have been impressed by the bravery of John Terry who, even at 3-1, was using his head to win tackles against other peoples feet. 

They will even have conceded that Didier Drogba can, despite appearances, turn games with moments of deftness but they will also have pointed out that this was another low-quality game between the English and European champions ? worse on the eye, indeed, than the goalless draw in the Champions League in midweek ? and one that was decided as much by Liverpools mistakes as by Chelseas ability. 

You did not have to be a perfectionist to find flaws in a Liverpool team whose European Cup triumph is becoming even more extraordinary with every mediocre performance.

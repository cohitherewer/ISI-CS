 Sehwag: Lead of around 250 will be enough

Chandigarh: Virender Sehwag believes a lead of around 250 will be enough to put Pakistan under pressure and that patience will be the key for the Indian bowlers. 

?I think we are in a good position. We will now aim to raise the run-rate in the morning session tomorrow. A lead of around 250 will be enough to put Pakistan under pressure,? Sehwag said after stumps on the third day. India are already ahead by 135 runs. 

He felt the pitch was good to bat on. ?It?s still a good pitch, the ball is coming on to the bat well. Our bowlers won?t get as much help from it in the second innings as they did in the first... They will need to bowl a good line and length, and patience will be the key. It will be tough for Pakistan to survive two days.? 

Sehwag, who completed his ninth Test hundred Thursday, failed to bat the whole day as he had wished after the second day. ?Our aim was to play out time, and I?m glad we did that. It was in the team?s interest to just stay at the crease? 

?The dismissal was disappointing, but it?s part of the game. If you play your natural game, you?re bound to get a ball at one stage that will get you out.? 

He also elaborated on the slow approach after his dismissal. ?We were careful because we did not want to lose all our top-order batsmen. We wanted someone to be there who could accelerate tomorrow. Then, they took the new ball after 120 overs, and the old ball being softer, it becomes difficult to score.? 

Sachin?s failure to get to his world record 35th hundred had made the team sad. ?We were all waiting for him to get to his century. We were unhappy when he got out? So was he.?

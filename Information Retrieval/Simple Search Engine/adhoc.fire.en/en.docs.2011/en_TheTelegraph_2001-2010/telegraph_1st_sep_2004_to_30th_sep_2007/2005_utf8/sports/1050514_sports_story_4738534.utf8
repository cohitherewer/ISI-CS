 India lose to Poland 

 Trupti pulled one back for India

Beijing: Indian shuttlers failed to raise their game when it mattered the most and went down to Poland 1-3 in the play-off for promotion to the higher group in the world mixed team badminton championship for the Sudirman Cup here on Friday. 

The Indians, who had topped group 3B with an all win record, had to defeat Poland to secure a spot in group 2 in the 2007 edition of the event but their attempt for a maiden entry in the second-best bunch of eight teams was halted by the much stronger Polish squad. 

It was a bad start for the Indians as their mixed doubles pair of V. Diju and Jwala Gutta went down 12-15, 5-15 in just 31 minutes to Robert Mateusiak and Nadiezda Kostiuczyk. 

National champion Anup Sridhar then lost 8-15, 12-15 to Przemyslaw Wacha. 

Trupti Murgunde, shouldering the responsibility of womens singles in the absence of national champion Aparna Popat, pulled one back as she put behind an indifferent start to beat Kamila Augustyn 8-11, 11-3, 11-3. 

Thereafter, the world No. 18 pair of Mateusiak and Michael Logosz warded off some stiff resistance from top Indian doubles pair of Sanave Thomas and Rupesh Kumar to win 15-12, 15-6. 

Meanwhile, Malaysia defeated Japan to book their berth in the top group for 2007 while Sweden was relegated after losing to Thailand in the play-offs. Wales was relegated to group IV after losing to Bulgaria 2-3.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Aussies put off selection by a day

Sydney: Injuries have forced Australia?s selectors to delay naming their one-day squad for the tour of New Zealand which starts next week. 

The party was due to be announced on Wednesday but was put back a day because allrounder Shane Watson had been ruled out with a side strain and batsman Darren Lehmann injured his ankle against Pakistan last Sunday. 

Lehmann was expected to recover to win a place in the squad and there was more good news for the world champions when all rounder Andrew Symonds, Australia?s one-day Cricketer of the Year, was cleared to play. 

Symonds missed the match against Pakistan with an Achilles problem but has been passed fit for the New Zealand tour which begins with a Twenty20 international in Auckland on February 17. 

Selector Allan Border said the panel had decided to scrap the controversial rotation policy and choose the best available team for every match. 

Australia have been chopping and changing their one-day side for the past few seasons to give players more time to rest. (Reuters)

 Yakubu jolt for Mahindra 

 Churchill have asked transfer fees from Mahindra for Yakubu 

Margao: Mahindra United received a setback ahead of their Federation Cup match against JCT after Churchill Brothers refused to issue the no-objection certificate to Yusif Yakubu to play for them. 

In a complaint to Goa Football Association (GFA) two days ago, Churchill Brothers said they had signed Yakubu from El Haly Football Club of Egypt, paying the club a big amount as transfer fees. 

We do not mind Yakubu moving over to another club, but the transfer fee has to be settled, Churchill Brothers manager Denzil Ferrao said here on Wednesday. 

The GFA, in turn, has referred the matter to AIFF, which would put it before the Players Status Committee, to decide the issue. 

Yakubus absence has upset the plans of Mahindras coach Derrick Perreira, and in the changed scenario, Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto, who had joined the Mumbai outfit a few days ago, is sure to play a key role. 

Incidentally, Churchill will start their campaign against Tollygunge Agragami in the second match on Thursday. They have signed two Nigerians ? defender Abbas Muritala and striker Tony Ngozi, but as a unit, they are struggling in the Goa Professional League. 

Tollygunge, on the other hand, are the lone team without any foreigner. 

Tollygunge coach Krishnendu Roy, however, believed that his team would be able make it to the next round. 

We have played Churchill in the National Football League and we know they are a good side? Plus they will have the home advantage, Roy admitted, but hastened to add that Its a knock-out tournament and everything depends on how are you playing on a particular day... Anything can happen tomorrow. 

Roy should have a number of backers after HAL knocked defending champions Dempo out in the tournament-opener on Wednesday. 

Despite clouds over Yakubus availability, Perreira, however, is confident that his team will win against JCT on Thursday. We have a strong line-up and good bench strength. Our boys have been playing well as a team. Hope they settle down quickly as we cannot afford to make mistakes since the Federation Cup is a knockout tournament, he said. 

JCT, on the other hand, have made changes in the team. The experience of Marcos Perreira, Rennedy Singh, Kalyan Chowbey, Sunil Chettri and Pravin Kumar will be assets to the team looking to win the Cup as they prepare for the National League, asserted coach Sukhwinder Singh. (PTI)

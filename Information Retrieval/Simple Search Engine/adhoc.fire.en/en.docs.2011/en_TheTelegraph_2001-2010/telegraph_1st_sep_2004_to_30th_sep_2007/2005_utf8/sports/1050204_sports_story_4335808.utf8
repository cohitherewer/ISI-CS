The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Narain signs up formally

 London: Jordan confirmed Narain Karthikeyan as India?s first Formula One driver on Thursday alongside Portugal?s Tiago Monteiro. 

?My aim has always been to compete in F1, it is where no Indian driver has been before,? said Karthikeyan in a team announcement. 

?I?ve got the hopes of a nation behind me so I?ve no choice but to succeed now,? added the 28-year-old Coimbatore racer. ?I?m going to give it everything I?ve got so I?m confident that this is going to be a good year for me.? 

The new line-up leaves Jordan, taken over last week by the Midland Group of Russian-born Canadian businessman Alex Shnaider, with two drivers who have never raced in Formula One. 

It also gives India, an attractive business market for sponsors with its enormous potential audience, a Formula One focal point after a stalled attempt to host a race in the country. 

The drivers can expect a tough debut in Australia on March 6, with Jordan due to run their new Toyota-powered car for the first time at Silverstone on Monday. 

The team finished ninth out of 10 last year. (Reuters)

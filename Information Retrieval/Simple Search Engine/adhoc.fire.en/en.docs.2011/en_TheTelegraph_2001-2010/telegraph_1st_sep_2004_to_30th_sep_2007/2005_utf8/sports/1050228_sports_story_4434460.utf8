 Sourav tips for Ranadeb

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal mediumpacers Ranadeb Bose and Shib Shankar Paul, who have made it to the Board President?s XI to play against Pakistan in a three-dayer from Thursday in Dharmasala, will leave the city on Tuesday morning. 

For Ranadeb, it will be his maiden appearance in the Board President?s XI side, while Paul will be doing duty a second time. 

Ranadeb spoke to Team India captain Sourav Ganguly on Sunday morning. ?I spoke to Maharajda this morning and will also ask a few more things tomorrow,? Ranadeb said. 

The mediumpacer, who has taken 66 wickets this season, feels that he is up against the biggest hurdle. ?Though I have bowled well and got wickets, my aim will be to bowl in the right spots against the Pakistan batsmen,? he said. 

According to Ranadeb, Sourav?s tips on how to bowl against the Pakistani batsmen would help him a lot. ?He told me about the strengths and weaknesses of each and every Pakistani batsman and I will follow his advice,? he said.

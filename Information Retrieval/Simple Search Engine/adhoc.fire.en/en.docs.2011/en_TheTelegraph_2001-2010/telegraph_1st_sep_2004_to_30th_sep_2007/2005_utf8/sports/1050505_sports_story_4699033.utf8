 Court order on SLC

Colombo: A Sri Lankan court on Wednesday ordered that a government-appointed committee will remain in control of the Sri Lankan cricket board offices, rather than the recently elected committee. 

The order, by a two-judge bench, came a day after police raided the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) premises, seizing the building and handing it over to the government-appointed panel. 

?The court will hear the case again on Monday, until then the status quo will be maintained,? solicitor general CR de Silva said after the court order. 

Sri Lanka?s cricket has been in crisis since sports minister Jeevan Kumaratunga last month suspended the registration of the elected cricket governing board and appointed an interim committee to run the sport instead. 

Kumaratunga accused the administration of mismanaging funds and disregarding ministerial orders ? claims denied by the board. 

Justifying Tuesday?s seizure of the SLC building ? during which about 50 policemen carrying AK-56 rifles entered the premises ? De Silva said under Sri Lankan sports laws, the minister has the right to suspend, replace or dissolve any sports body. 

?The interim (government-appointed) committee has the legal right to run the affairs of the board and they can?t function under tamarind trees,? De Silva said. 

The apparent aim of Tuesday?s police raid was to remove Thilanga Sumathipala, a controversial figure who was elected SLC president for his fourth one-year term in March. 

The sports minister didn?t recognise the election and refused to allow Sumathipala to run cricket affairs. 

Sumathipala, who was present in the court, said he will wait until Monday when the court is expected to rule whether the sports minister acted within his powers by suspending the elected committee and replacing it by a hand-picked one.

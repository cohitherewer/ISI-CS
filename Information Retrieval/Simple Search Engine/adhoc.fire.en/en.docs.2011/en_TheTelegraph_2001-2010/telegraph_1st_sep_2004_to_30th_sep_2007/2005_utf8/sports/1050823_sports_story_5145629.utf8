 Fit Blignaut drafted in

 Blignaut missed the Test series vs New Zealand 

Bulawayo: Fit-again Andy Blignaut was included in the Zimbabwe squad named on Monday for the triangular series involving India and New Zealand. 

The allrounder missed Zimbabwes Test series against New Zealand because of injuries to his bowling shoulder and elbow. New Zealand won both Tests by an innings, the first in two days and the second in three. 

Blignaut, who should help make Zimbabwe more competitive in the one-day series, was captaining the Zimbabwe Boards XI in Mondays tour match against the New Zealanders. 

The only uncapped player in the squad is 18-year-old allrounder Chamunorwa Chibhabha. 

Also included was left-arm spinner Keith Dabengwa, who made his Test debut in the second Test in Bulawayo last week but has yet to play a one-day International. 

Zimbabwe and New Zealand will play the first match in the tournament in Bulawayo on Wednesday.

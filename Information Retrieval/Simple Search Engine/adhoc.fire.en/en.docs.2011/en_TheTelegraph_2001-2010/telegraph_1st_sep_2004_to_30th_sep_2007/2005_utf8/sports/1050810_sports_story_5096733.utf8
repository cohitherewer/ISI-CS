The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India fail to cash in on blazing Sehwag start, lose another final

 - Jayasuriya fourth into 10000 club

 - Ashish Nehras 6/59 goes in vain 

 Mahela Jayawardene acknowledges applause after being dismissed for 83 on Tuesday 

Colombo: India failed to break a long-standing jinx as they blew away a solid start before crashing to a 18-run loss against Sri Lanka in the IndianOil Cup triangular one-day series final here on Tuesday. 

A new captain in Rahul Dravid and a new coach in Greg Chappell made no difference to Indias fortunes as the side slumped once more in the final of a multi-national contest. The last title for them came in 2002 when they beat England in the final of the NatWest Trophy at Lords. 

 The Indians had themselves to blame for the defeat as they were cruising along comfortably at 186 for two before Yuvraj Singhs dismissal turned the tide in favour of the hosts in a day-night encounter at the Premadasa Stadium. 

Once Sri Lanka made 281 for nine in 50 overs after electing to bat, it was never going to be easy for India who despite a fantastic start were restricted to 263 for nine. 

The loss was Indias third 

 in succession against Sri Lanka in the series having lost 

 both the league matches in Dambulla last week. 

Sri Lanka posted the highest score of the tournament with Sanath Jayasuriya becoming the fourth player in one-day history after Sachin Tendulkar, Inzamam-ul Haq and Sourav Ganguly to join the 10,000 run club during his aggressive knock of 67. 

Mahela Jayawardene proved his class once again making a classy 83 while Russell Arnold contributed a valuable 64. 

 India made a solid start to their 

 reply with Virender Sehwag blasting a 22-ball 48 with 26 

 of them coming off one over from Dilhara Lokuhettige. 

Even after his dismissal in the seventh over, the visitors were in with a good chance when they were 186 for two in the 36th over and captain Rahul Dravid (69) and Yuvraj (42) were firmly entrenched. 

But then Yuvraj holed out in the deep, Dravid was run-out and the return of Muttiah Muralidharan (two for 35) for his second spell blanked out the Indians. 

The Indians set off for the target in great style when Sehwag clobbered the Sri Lankan bowlers and raised 62 runs for the first wicket in only 6.2 overs. 

Sehwag was particularly harsh on Lokuhettige whom he punished for 26 runs in one over which included five fours and a six. 

But he then played on Chaminda Vaas on to his stumps to waste a great chance of building an innings and keeping India in the hunt. 

Sourav looked in good touch and reached 26 from 45 balls with two fours before being adjudged leg before wicket to Tillekeratne Dilshan at 102 for two in the 17th over. 

Dravid and Yuvraj then raised visions of a win with calculated batting, running their singles hard and pushing Sri Lanka on the backfoot all the while. 

But once the two were out, Sri Lanka were able to close down on India with great skill and discipline. 

Yuvraj made his 42 from 58 balls with two fours while Dravid reached 69 from 99 balls with three hits to the fence. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni fell leg before wicket to Upul Chandana and Harbhajan Singh was run out as India slipped into a bigger hole. Zaheer Khan and Mohammad Kaif holed out in the deep and it was all over for the indians. 

Earlier Ashish Nehra distinguished himself in the Sri Lanka innings with figures of six for 59 but half centuries from Jayasuriya, Jayawardene and Arnold carried the hosts to total of 281 for nine. 

Jayasuriya hogged attention from the moment he walked to the crease. First he raised his 10,000 runs with a thumping four, then survived two chances in the slips from slashing cuts, and galloped to 67 from 77 balls with nine fours before Harbhajans sharp throw from third man found him short of crease. 

Jayasuriya was dropped on 19 and 28 off Irfan Pathan and Zaheer Khan but his dominating presence set Sri Lanka on course for the big total. 

Nehra did his best, claiming three wickets in his first spell of six overs and adding three more when he returned, which at least stopped Sri Lanka from topping 300 runs. 

Nehra, brought on in only the sixth over, accounted for Maravan Atapattu (11), Dilhara Lokuhettige (9) and Kumar Sangakkara (8) in his first spell as India recovered the lost ground of early overs. 

Atapattu was clean bowled playing the wrong line and Lokuhettige was out leg before after he briefly suggested his promotion up the order would come off for Lanka. 

Sangakkara was held by Sehwag at short point position which was one of the many imaginative moves captain Dravid made in the field. 

However, Sri Lanka now enjoyed the best part of their innings when the fourth wicket pair of Jayasuriya and Jayawardene put on 55 runs, followed by the sensible yet fast-scoring fifth wicket stand of 117 runs. 

Jayasuriya first neutralised the Anil Kumble factor by slamming him for three fours in one over and racing to his half century from only 61 balls with eight boundaries. 

His dismissal at 122 for four gave India a sniff of chance but then Jayawardene and Arnold stayed till the 46th over to completely demoralise the visitors. 

The two turned the heat on their rivals between the 30-40 overs stretch when they raised 56 runs and shut out the threat of Kumble and Harbhajan, operating in tandem. 

Jayawardene was the first to reach his half century from 71 balls and Arnold was even quicker (50 off 53 balls) as they pushed the flat-footed Indians into making numerous mistakes in the field.

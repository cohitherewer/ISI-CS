 Woods best of the year

Jacksonville (Florida): With seven weeks left in the season, Tiger Woods clinched the PGA Player of the Year, a points-based award handed out by the USPGA since 1948. 

Woods won the award for the seventh time in nine years. Earlier, Tom Watson had won it six times during an eight-year span. 

The PGA Player of the Year award gives 30 points for Majors, 20 points for the Players Championship and 10 points for all other US PGA Tour victories. It also awards as many as 20 points depending on where a player finishes on the money list and in scoring average. Woods cannot be caught because he won two Majors, which carries a 50-point bonus.

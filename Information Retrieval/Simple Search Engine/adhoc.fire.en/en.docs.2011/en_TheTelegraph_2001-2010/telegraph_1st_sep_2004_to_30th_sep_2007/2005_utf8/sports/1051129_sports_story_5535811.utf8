The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Observer allows Jharkhand to vote

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Supreme Court-appointed observer T.S. Krishnamurthy on Monday resolved the disputed cases over representation of a few units in the BCCI AGM. 

Jharkhand, National Cricket Club and Uttar Pradesh will be represented by Amitabh Choudhary, K.P. Kajaria and Jyoti Bajpai, respectively. All are known to be Dalmiya loyalists. 

Helping Dalmiyas case further, president Ranbit Singh Mahendra will have two votes ? as a chairman and casting vote, in case of a tie. 

The good news for the opposition camp came in the form of green signal given to Rajendra Zar to attend the meeting as representative of Himachal Pradesh, instead of Dalmiya loyalist Anurag Mathur. The observer also cleared Lalit Modi to represent Rajasthan. 

Ruling specific to Jharkhand and Bihar is as follows: 

At the Chennai meeting on November 23 on the basis of the representation made by the Bihar Cricket Association it was stated that there was no clarity about including the Bihar Cricket Association (1935) in place of Bihar Cricket Association and that in view of the provision in the BCCI Rules only the Bihar Cricket Association (Original) continued to be a member. In the circumstances, a direction was given to the effect that any contrary documentary evidence in favour of the Bihar Cricket Association (1935) and its subsequent change of names to Jharkhand State Cricket Association as a replacement to Bihar Cricket Association could be produced on November 27, 2005 to verify the legality of Jharkhand State Cricket Association as a member of BCCI. Minutes of the Working Committee Meeting on November 26, 2001 and subsequent Special General Meeting on September 12, 2004 were produced to point out that the expression Bihar Cricket Association (1935) was used only to refer to the Original Bihar Cricket Association with its headquarters at Jamshedpur since the Bihar Cricket Association now in existence is a new association registered at Patna. It was also stated at Chennai on November 23, 2005 that the minutes of the Special General Meeting held at Chennai on September 12, 2004 approving the change in the name of Bihar Cricket Association to Jharkhand State Cricket Association were not confirmed at the subsequent Annual General Meeting at Calcutta on September 26, 2004. A careful perusal of the minutes of the AGM at Calcutta on September 26, 2004 however shows that the minutes relating to the change in the name of Bihar Cricket Association to Jharkhand State Cricket Association were also confirmed. The decision at the Special General Meeting on September 12 was to approve the change in the name and also to carry out the consequential amendments in the relevant clauses in the Memorandum and Rules and Regulations of the Board. The minutes of the September 26, 2004 AGM show that minutes of the Special General Meeting of the Board held on September 12, 2004 at Taj Coromandel, Chennai at 2.30 pm with regard to the amendments to the Rules and Regulations of the Board were confirmed. Thus, the decision allowing the change in name of Bihar Cricket Association to Jharkhand State Cricket Association taken by the special General Meeting on September 12, 2004 appears to have been duly ratified by the AGM on September 26, 2004. I am fortified in my above view by the fact that at the last AGM held on September 26, 2004 it was the representative of Jharkhand State Cricket Association who was allowed to participate and vote for the elections to the posts of Office Bearers. Accordingly, the authorised representative of the Jharkhand State Cricket Association shall be eligible to participate and vote at the adjourned AGM on November 29 and 30, 2005. 

Mr Kirti Azad, representing Cricket Control Association of Bihar requested first that his association should be given Associate Member status for Bihar. Later on he filed a representation to the effect that he should be allowed to vote for Bihar Cricket Association. As far as Associate membership is concerned it is not within my purview of conducting the elections of BCCI. It is for the AGM to consider his application. His request for the right to vote for the Bihar Cricket Association does not subsist in the light of above. 

 Choudhary relieved 

Amitabh Choudhary on Monday said he was relieved after being allowed to represent Jharkhand State Cricket Association by the observer, who set aside Bihar Cricket Associations case. We always thought that if the facts were properly placed before the observer, we would get a favourable verdict, he said. 

 Choudhary also thanked Kirti Azad 

 for speaking the truth about the state of affairs 

 in Bihar.

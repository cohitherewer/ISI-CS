The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gerrard a complex, confused individual

This time, it was not the heart that told Steven Gerrard he was making a mistake in severing his ties with Liverpool. Nor was it his head. It was the sudden rush of fear through his body, as he sat at home discussing his options with his agent on Tuesday night, that made him realise he could not go through with it. He did not know if it was a panic attack, a bout of anxiety or a belated recognition of what he would be leaving behind, but it was enough to make him realise he was making a huge mistake. 

Gerrard knew that he needed to speak to Rick Parry, the clubs chief executive who, in a television interview, had confirmed that the captain feels he can do better elsewhere, almost certainly Chelsea, adding, with a note of weary defiance, that our job now is to prove him wrong. 

That struck a chord with Gerrard, but he was so driven by anxiety that he could not pick up the phone. Instead, he asked Struan Marshall, his agent, to make the call to Parry while he, in the background, asked for assurances ? like are you sure you want me?, if I came back, would I be welcome? ? to which the answer, delivered via Marshall every time, was an unequivocal yes. Placated by those simple assurances, Gerrard called several friends and relatives for advice and in the early hours of Wednesday, by now leaning back towards Liverpool, he decided to sleep on the matter. 

Parry left his home just outside Chester on Wednesday morning feeling more optimistic than he had when facing the cameras the previous evening, yet the call ? when it came as he was driving to Anfield shortly after 8 am ? came as a pleasant surprise. Again the voice on the other end of the line was Marshalls, rather than Gerrards, but the message, was the one that he was waiting for. Stevies made his mind up, Marshall said. He wants to stay. 

And that was that.

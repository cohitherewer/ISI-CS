London: It is rare that Manchester United and Arsenal get to this stage of the season with all realistic hopes of silverware resting on the FA Cup. 

United manager Alex Ferguson will be protecting a 100 per cent record in the semi-finals when the holders take on Newcastle United in Cardiff on Sunday. 

Ferguson has lifted the trophy a record five times and led United to victories at this stage of the competition in 1990, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999 and 2004. 

The Millennium Stadium is also the venue for Arsenal?s semi-final against Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. 

This season the two heavyweights of English soccer, who between them have won the Premier League for the last nine years, have been outpointed by runaway leaders Chelsea. The Stamford Bridge club has also reached the Champions League semi-finals and won the League Cup. 

Most neutral fans hope Manchester United and Arsenal can set up a dream FA Cup final on May 21. The last United versus Arsenal final was in 1979 when the London side won 3-2. 

The Gunners? hopes of lifting at least one trophy this season were, however, dealt a huge blow when Thierry Henry was ruled out of Saturday?s game due to a groin injury. The Frenchman is the Premier League?s top scorer with 25 goals. Arsenal will also be without England centre-back Sol Campbell who has failed to recover from an ankle injury in time. 

?Henry is out with a groin problem,? Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said at Arsenal?s training ground on Friday. ?It is an inflammation of his groin. We have to check that by scan today to find out how long he will be out. 

?He could be out for a few weeks, he could be out for a few days. It could be quite serious. 

?It is a big blow. We wanted Thierry with us but on the other hand we have to focus on the strengths we have and make sure we have enough to go through.? 

Campbell, Arsenal?s defensive rock, has not played since February 1 due to an ankle injury. Wenger said: ?Campbell practises and is close to full, full competitive fitness, but he is not involved.? 

Ivory Coast international Kolo Toure and Swiss Philippe Senderos are likely to play in central defence. 

Wenger will be able to select Swedish midfielder Freddie Ljungberg, who has happy memories of Cardiff after scoring a spectacular goal in Arsenal?s 2002 FA Cup final win over Chelsea. He has shaken off a hip problem. 

Spanish striker Jose Antonio Reyes and Brazilian midfielder Edu have recovered from knocks although goalkeeper Manuel Almunia has a groin injury and full-back Gael Clichy is out after foot surgery. 

Wenger, who has reached seven FA Cup semis in his nine years at Highbury, said this season was always in danger of ending in disappointment after the defending champions completed an unbeaten top-flight campaign in 2003-04. ?When you have won the Premiership without losing a game you cannot better that, you can only do worse,? Wenger said. 

Nine-time winners Arsenal have a proud tradition in the FA Cup ? only Manchester United?s 11 victories possess a better record ? and French midfielder Robert Pires says winning the trophy would provide a great finish to the season. 

?We may not be in the Champions League but there is at least one other trophy we can win,? said Pires. ?We can still be a success. ?It is not a consolation prize. We want to win all the time and we all know how important the FA Cup is to our supporters.? 

Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher said captain Roy Keane?s harsh criticism of his teammates this week could galvanise the holders against Newcastle. 

?Roy Keane has been vocal in the press. We all knew about that as he is vocal in the dressing room before going to the press,? said Fletcher. ?It does spur you on. If he can get an extra bit out of us for Sunday, which he is obviously trying to do, that?s great.? 

Manchester United are definitely without striker Louis Saha (calf injury) and have described winger Ryan Giggs (hamstring) as very doubtful. Sunday?s tie brings back memories of Manchester United?s treble-winning year in 1999 when Ferguson?s men beat Newcastle in the final at Wembley a few days before lifting the European Cup in Barcelona.

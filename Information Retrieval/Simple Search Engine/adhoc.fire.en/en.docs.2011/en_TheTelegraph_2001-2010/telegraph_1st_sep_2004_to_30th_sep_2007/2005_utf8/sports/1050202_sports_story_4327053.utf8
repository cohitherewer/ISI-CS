Sydney: Yousuf Youhana scored a match-winning century as Pakistan defeated the West Indies by 30 runs on Tuesday to join Australia in the one-day tri-series final. 

Youhana blasted 105 off 100 balls and Inzamam-ul Haq made a whirlwind 74 off 67, to help Pakistan post a formidable 307 for eight at the WACA in Perth. 

West Indies were then bowled out for 277 in the 49th over, despite good efforts from Ramnaresh Sarwan (87) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (58). 

The pair helped their side to 194 for three in the 33rd over, but with their departure the West Indian innings folded up, the last seven wickets falling for just 83. 

Paceman Rana Naved-ul-Hasan mopped up the tail to finish with four for 29. 

?I thought we were very well placed, with Sarwan and Chanderpaul,? West Indies captain Brian Lara said. ?That?s the point when the game started to change.? 

West Indies won the toss and made a reasonable start, reducing Pakistan to 90 for three in the 23rd over when the momentum suddenly changed as Youhana and Inzamam added 134 off 119 balls for the fourth wicket. 

Inzamam smashed 10 fours before he was bowled by Dwayne Bravo with the total on 224. 

Man of the match Youhana was more patient but no less effective. He managed nine boundaries but was more content to accumulate his runs through singles and twos. 

He reached his 11th one-day International hundred off 95 deliveries but departed three balls from the end when he was caught short of his ground trying to scamper home for a second run. 

Ian Bradshaw was the pick of the bowlers, capturing three wickets for 47 off 10 overs. 

In reply, West Indies lost Chris Gayle for a duck but still looked to be in with a chance of an unlikely victory when Sarwan and Chanderpaul added 95 for the fourth wicket. 

The West Indian lower order had staged a late fightback to win last year?s ICC Champions Trophy final against England but there were no heroics this time. 

Pakistan will now play Australia in the best-of-three finals series. 

The opening match will be played at Melbourne on Friday with the second match in Sydney on Sunday. A third match, if required, will be held in Adelaide next Tuesday.

 Anand to take part in world meet

New Delhi: In a bid to clear the haze around the world chess title, former champion Viswanathan Anand gave an expected nod to participate in the world championship to be held in San Luis, Argentina, later this year. 

The tournament, however, might not end the ongoing dispute over the world title as Classical champion Vladimir Kramnik has already made it clear that he will not participate in the meet and has, instead, proposed to play the winner of this event to unify the chess world. 

Anand, however, hoped that the tournament to be organised on the lines of a similar event ? held in 1948 in The Hague and Moscow and won by Russian Mikhail Botvinnik ? would end a lot of ambiguity about the world champion. 

?In general, I think this is the best solution. I think this will chose the world champion and hopefully, that will be the end to a lot of ambiguity,? he said about the $1 million event. 

Anand was not a part of the original reunification treaty charted out by Fide in 2002 in Prague but since then, after a few hitches in carrying out the plans, the world body finally decided to go ahead with a new format that includes the top eight players in the world. 

As a result, Garri Kasparov of Russia, Kramnik, Hungarian Peter Leko, Brit Michael Adams, Bulgarian Veselin Topalov, Uzbek Rustam Kasimdzhanov, and Russian Alexander Morozevich were invited to take part in the event, which will be held on a double round robin basis. 

However, with Kasparovs retirement in March and Kramniks withdrawal, through a press release a few weeks back, there are already two vacancies and as per rules the candidates will be chosen by the average ELO rating between July 2004 and January 2005.

 Fransa hold EB to goalless draw

 - National Football League

 Rajat Ghosh Dastidar helped East Bengal avoid defeat 

Margao: Defending champions East Bengal survived a scare from debutant Fransa Sports Club before holding on for a goalless draw in a second round match of the ninth National Football League played at Nehru Stadium here Thursday. 

Fransa made two changes, bringing in two foreigners ? Ghanian Benjamin Owusuansah and Nigerian Joseph Ogor to give more teeth to their attack and both did not let their team down as they kept the rival defence under pressure, particularly in the second half. 

It was East Bengal?s goalkeeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar who brought off two brilliant saves off Sebastiao Endro to deny Fransa a victory. 

Bhaichung Bhutia, who was mostly kept quiet by Man-of-the-Match Louis Aniweta, managed to elude his marker once, but failed to net the ball. 

Fransa, after beating Vasco in their first match, now have four points from two outings while East Bengal, who have drawn both their engagements, have two. Fransa?s coach Norbert Gonsalves was satisfied with the draw. 

?It is morale boosting draw as our boys matched the fancied rival and came close to beat them,? Norbert said. 

East Bengal?s coach Subhas Bhowmick blamed Bhutia for not converting the two chances that came his way. ?A draw is a good result and we hope to play better in our next match,? Bhowmick said.

Calcutta: Helped by a brace each from Yusif Yakubu and Marcos Perreira Churchill Brothers defeated Tollygunge Agragami 4-2 in a 16th round National Football League duel for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

The Tollygunge players? body language was negative from the start. They seemed to be expecting the defeat that finally came. They suffered a blow before the match, when their first-choice goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh fell ill, threw up and had to be replaced at the last moment. Sudip Sarkar replaced him. 

Churchill shot into the lead in the seventh minute when Marcos Parriera, in full control, lobbed it inside the box for Yakubu, who beat the defenders and jabbed the ball home. Even after conceding the goal Tollygunge showed no urgency. On the contrary, they went into a shell. That helped the Goan team take charge of the proceedings. 

After more anxious moments, Tollygunge ultimately conceded another just a minute from the breather by converting a spot kick. It seemed a bit lucky for the Goan outfit to get the penalty when Suman Dutta brought Marcos down inside the box. Yakubu scored from the penalty. 

Just after the lemon break, Churchill went 3-0 up when Marcos, after getting the ball from Roque Barreto, put the ball home from inside the box in the 52nd minute. But after four minutes, Tollygunge pulled one back when they earned a free-kick as Surajit Bose was tripped from behind by Osumanu Husseini. Man of the Match Saumik Dey unleashed a brilliant right-footer to make it 3-1. 

Tollygunge reduced the margin further in the 83rd minute, when a Pankaj Basak shot off a melee was intercepted by Akeem Abolanle who passed it for unmarked Tarif Ahmed just outside the six-yard box. Tarif made no mistake putting the ball in the right slot. 

Tollygunge finally looked an enthused lot, and then pressed hard for the equaliser. Even Suley Musah himself started moving up to the box for the equaliser. However, this created gaps in the Tollygunge defence, and Marcos sealed the fate of the match when he put one home in the dying moments. 

With both teams hovering round in the relegation zone, the victory gave Churchill three vital points promoting the Goans to the joint eighth spot with Mohun Bagan in the league standing with 17 points from 16 matches. Tollygunge slipped a slot from the ninth spot as they remained with 15 points from 16 games.

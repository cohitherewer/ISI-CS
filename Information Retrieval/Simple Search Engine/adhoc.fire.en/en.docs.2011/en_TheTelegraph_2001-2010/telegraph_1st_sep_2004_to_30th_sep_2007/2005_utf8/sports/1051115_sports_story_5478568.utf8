 BMW Sauber the new name

Munich: German car makers BMW revealed on Monday that their new Formula One team will be called BMW Sauber for 2006. 

BMW bought Sauber earlier this year after ending their six-year partnership with Williams and had no hesitation in including the Swiss team in their new team name. 

Choosing the team name was not a difficult decision, admitted BMW motorsport director Mario Theissen. 

It reflects the facts: on one hand the team is run by BMW, but on the other almost 300 Sauber employees form the core.. 

Germanys Nick Heidfeld is the only confirmed driver for BMW Sauber in 2006 with Canadas former world champion Jacques Villeneuve and promising Finn Heikki Kovalainen said to be the main candidates for the other spot.

Sydney: The six national captains who attended the International Cricket Council (ICC)-convened summit on Wednesday have suggested that the world body look at extending the existing three-and-half hours permitted to bowl the 50 overs in each innings of an ODI. 

Three of the ten Test-playing nations (England, India and New Zealand) were represented by nominees and not the captains themselves. Nobody turned up from the West Indies as Brian Lara, who was nominated by his Board, declined to attend the annual meeting. 

A (controversial) former captain, Lara gave no reason for not representing the West Indies. Currently in the hot seat is Shivnarine Chanderpaul. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the captains contended that with teams now regularly posting much bigger totals, the demands on the bowlers and the person at the helm was just too much. 

One has to change fields more often and, at the same time, confer with the bowlers a lot more... It takes time and nobody resorts to an intentional delay, one of the captains pointed out, during a chat at the (official) Four Seasons Hotel. 

The captains, of course, have had to pay dearly for delays. Sourav Ganguly, for one, will vouch for that. 

Apparently, the ICC didnt react, but did tell the captains that their views would be discussed at the next cricket committee meeting. 

The captains, one understands, also suggested that the experimental one-day rule be modified to allow for the naming of the super sub after the toss. Right now, it has to be done before the coin is flipped. 

The ICC, though, is unlikely to consider that favourably as it wants allrounders slotted as super subs and not a specialist batsman/bowler ? as is being done by the teams. 

Everybody, it seems, isnt happy with the power play provision as well. 

The captains, meanwhile, have been informed that the strategic use (misuse, actually) of normal substitutes has to stop. Indeed, the umpires have been directed to step in if theyre convinced that a substitute has come on only because hes outstanding in the field and somebody needs to be protected. 

Specifically, anybody going off either to the toilet or for a change of shirt/trouser cant remain in the dressing room for more than two overs. If theres a breach, the fourth umpire could investigate. 

The summit, which got diluted because of the absence of almost half the regular captains, lasted over an hour.

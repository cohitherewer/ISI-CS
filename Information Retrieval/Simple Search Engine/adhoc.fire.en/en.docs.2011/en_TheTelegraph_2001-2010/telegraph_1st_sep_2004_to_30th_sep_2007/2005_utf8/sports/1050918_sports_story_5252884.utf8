 Shiv Kapur slips down leaderboard

Taipei: Shiv Kapur and Arjun Singh shot par rounds in the third round to slip down the leaderboard, while Gaurav Ghei was also languishing with a three-over 75 at the $300,000 Taiwan Open on the Asian Tour. 

Kapur is now tied for 20th at five-under 211, while Singh and Ghei are tied 32nd and Ghei 57th, respectively, at the Chang Gung Golf Club. 

Australian Scott strange fired a course-record equalling eight-under-par 64 to seize a one-stroke lead over Thai newcomer Chapchai Nirat. 

Scott, winner of the Myanmar Open in February, was in sizzling form, shooting eight birdies for a three-day total of 13-under-par 203 to give himself a shot at a second Asian Tour title this season. He matched a long-standing course record set by Yu Chin-Han of Chinese Taipei in 1987. 

Kapur had 16 pars and just one each of birdie and bogey as he had a frustrating day with the putter. He bogeyed the second, which was a par-four and then got back that shot with a birdie on par-five 12th.

New York: Lleyton Hewitt hurried through to the US Open second round with a breezy 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 victory over former French Open champion Albert Costa on Wednesday. 

Serving superbly, the Australian third seed was unruffled by the windy conditions and outplayed his Spanish opponent from start to finish on Arthur Ashe Court. 

Hewitt, who lost in last years final to Roger Federer, wrapped up victory over the world No. 104 in one hour 20 minutes with a crunching backhand service return winner. 

The 2001 US Open champion has benefited from the late withdrawal through injury of Marat Safin, the Russian who beat him in this years Australian Open final. 

Following the exit of British 12th seed Tim Henman on Tuesday, Slovakian 15th seed Dominik Hrbaty is the highest seed left in Hewitts quarter of the draw. He could, however, face top seed Federer in the semi-finals. 

Meanwhile, a little-known lefthander from Luxembourg destroyed the US Open dream of American Andy Roddick on Tuesday. 

Gilles Muller, a 22-year-old playing at Flushing Meadow for the first time, produced the tennis of his life to beat the 2003 champion and fourth seed 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (10-8), 7-6 (7-1) in a huge first round upset on Roddicks 23rd birthday. 

Representing a nation with a population of less than half a million, Muller brutally exposed the weakness of Roddicks backhand and repelled his 150mph serve with a remarkable 65 outright winners ? this after trailing 2-5 in the first set. 

It left the American flummoxed, forlorn and dumbfounded in front of an expectant crowd at the Arthur Ashe Court. 

After Briton Tim Henmans painful exit, compatriot Greg Rusedski also lost but a third Briton, teenager Andy Murray, progressed despite throwing up on court during his five-set win. 

Rusedski, the 28th seed, was beaten 5-7, 6-7 (3-7). 3-6 by in-form American James Blake, the winner at New Haven on Sunday. 

Murray bravely overcame Romanian Andrei Pavel 6-3, 3-6, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, having thrown up apparently from exhaustion early in the fifth set. 

Pavel, ranked 83 places above the 18-year-old, was later penalised a point for swearing at the umpire following an overrule. 

Russian sixth seed Nikolay Davydenko beat Czech Tomas Zib 6-2, 6-0, 6-4, while former French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten earned only his third tournament win of 2005 with a four-set victory over American Paul Goldstein, the Brazilian serving 35 aces in the process. 

However, another ex-Roland Garros champion Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain, seeded 20, lost 7-5, 7-5, 6-1 to Frenchman Arnaud Clement. 

Argentine 11th seed David Nalbandian, the 2003 semi-finalist, came through in three sets against Alex Bogomolov of the U.S. 

Womens second seed Lindsay Davenport, third seed Amelie Mauresmo and French Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne also advanced to the second round without dropping a set. 

World No. 1 Davenport had to work hard for a 6-4, 6-4 win over a determined Li Na of China in the first evening session match. 

It was a good first match to get under my belt, she is a very good player, Davenport said. I just hope I can get better as the tournament goes on. 

Frenchwoman Mauresmo, still looking for a Grand Slam title, was too strong for Roberta Vinci, beating the Italian 6-3, 6-2. 

 Mauresmo faces a tricky second-round opponent, however, in Bulgarian 16-year-old Sesil Karatantcheva. 

Seventh seed Henin-Hardenne ensured there was no repeat of her shock first round exit at Wimbledon in June with an impressive 6-3, 6-0 win over Czech Zuzana Ondraskova. 

Russian sixth seed Elena Dementieva, the runner-up last year, recovered from a slow start to quell another Czech, Lucie Safarova, 7-5, 6-3. 

Earlier, defending champion Roger Federer hammered out a warning to his rivals for the US Open title, beating Czech Ivo Minar 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 on Tuesday to reach the second round in just over an hour. 

Federer rattled through the first two sets in 36 minutes. The Czech put up a little more resistance in the third set until the fourth game when he dropped his serve and the champion romped to victory. 

Britains Tim Henman slumped to a dismal first-round defeat, beaten 4-6, 2-6, 2-6 by Spains Fernando Verdasco. The 12th seed, a semi-finalist last year, looked sluggish and error-prone on Louis Armstrong Court and the loss means he is likely to tumble down the mens rankings. 

Henman has been suffering from a back problem and Verdasco, ranked 48, swept through the first two sets before the Briton lost his temper in the third set. 

Henman has been suffering with a back problem and he said it affected his movement. 

I knew my back wasnt great but after the practice I had for three-quarters of an hour on Sunday and then a bit longer yesterday, I felt like it was moving in the right direction, he told reporters. 

Youve got to go after shots a bit more. It was just pretty much in my second service game that it tightened up. Then, if anything, its just going to get tighter and tighter as the match goes on.

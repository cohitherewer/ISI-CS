 Batsmen must look for 250-plus runs

 - Tri-Series

 We?re heading in the right direction, says Lara

Hobart: The West Indies batsmen must look for innings totals of 250 and more to be successful in this month?s triangular one-day series with Australia and Pakistan, skipper Brian Lara said Sunday. 

The West Indies exploited pacer-friendly conditions on their way to a surprise victory over England in the ICC Champions Trophy final in England last September. 

But the flat, hard Australian tracks present an altogether different prospect. 

?We worked really hard in our camp in Barbados in December, but I don?t think it?s enough,? Lara said. 

?I?ve still seen a lot of loopholes in our fielding and our bowling ? it?s not the ICC tournament, it?s not September in England where conditions favour our fast bowlers. ?We?ve got to understand that it?s going to be 250-plus the majority of the time and our batters have got to understand that we?ve got to get those totals. 

?If you?re batting first or if you?re chasing, you?ve got to overcome that.? 

The West Indies look set to rely on a long batting line-up for the triangular one-day series, starting against Australia in Melbourne on Friday. 

?This is Australia and it?s nice to have a long batting order. But if you don?t want to be chasing 300 plus, you?ve got to have bowlers who are capable of limiting the opposition,? he remarked. 

?So it?s going to be tough between sacrificing a bat and playing the extra bowler or lengthening the batting.? 

Lara looks in good touch after his unbeaten 116 off 86 balls in Saturday?s first of two one-dayers against Australia A here. 

If Lara needs any further advice on Australian conditions, he need look no further than the new coaching staff headed by former Queensland and Australian academy head coach Bennett King. 

?We?ve got a new coaching staff, new ideas and a new work ethic and I think we?re heading in the right direction,? Lara observed. 

?We?re taking a more professional approach and I?ve just got to wish Bennett and his camp all the best. 

?We?ve always had the players, but it?s about harnessing the talent and getting it working cohesively towards winning. Hopefully he?ll be able to do it. 

?We have come here to win,? he added. ?We know we?re playing against the world champions Australia, while Pakistan is a very good outfit, although unpredictable at times. 

?But we came here to win and we?d be disappointed if we don?t.?

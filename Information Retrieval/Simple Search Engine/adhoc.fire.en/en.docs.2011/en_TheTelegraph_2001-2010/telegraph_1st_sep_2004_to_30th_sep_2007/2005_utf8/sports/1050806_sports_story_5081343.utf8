Birmingham: Left-arm spinner Ashley Giles answered his critics in the best possible fashion on Friday as England took control of the second Ashes Test at Edgbaston. Giles, roundly criticised after Englands first Test defeat, took three wickets on his home ground as the world champions were bowled out for 308 on the second day. 

Englands delight with a 99-run first-innings lead, however, was marred by leg-spinner Shane Warne in the final over of the day. 

Andrew Strauss, failing to cover his stumps, was bowled by an extraordinary ripper, the delivery turning from way outside off to hit leg. Warne will doubtless produce more of the same on the third day. 

England ended on 25 for one, for an overall lead of 124, with Marcus Trescothick 19 not out and nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard yet to score. 

Fast bowler Simon Jones, who took two wickets, and allrounder Andrew Flintoff, with three, were Englands other top performers. 

Jones produced a fine display of reverse swing which included Englands ball of the day to dismiss Australias top-scorer Justin Langer for 82 while Flintoff wrapped up the innings with two consecutive inswinging yorkers. 

Giles, though, removed Australias two in-form batsmen ? Ricky Ponting for 61 and Michael Clarke for 40 ? before Australia lost their last five wickets for 46 runs. 

Giles, who failed to take a wicket at Lords, finished with three for 78 to Flintoffs three for 52. Adam Gilchrist was left stranded on 49. 

The first day of the Test had been a carnival. England, put in on a benign surface, blazed away in the absence of injured Glenn McGrath for a total of 407, scored at more than five an over.

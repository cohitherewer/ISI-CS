 Sania-Mahesh to take on Shikha-Krajicek

New Delhi: Sania Mirza will mark her return to the courts with a celebrity mixed doubles match, with Mahesh Bhupathi, against Shikha Uberoi and former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek on the sidelines of a mens event on Sunday. 

Shikha will also play a singles match against Krajiceks sister Michaela on the sidelines of the ABN-Amro Tennis Challenge on December 3-4, organisers Globosports said. 

Sania, who last played seven weeks ago, had suffered a back strain and pulled out of a WTA event in Thailand in the first week of October. She still has a slight strain in her lower back but began practice two days ago in Hyderabad. 

The mens singles will feature Bhupathi and Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion. (PTI)

 Crespo saves Chelsea

London: Argentine substitute Hernan Crespo scored an injury-time winner to give champions Chelsea a dramatic 1-0 victory at promoted Wigan Athletic on Sunday. 

Wigan, playing their first game in the top flight, looked set for at least a fully-deserved draw or even a sensational win in the closing stages before Crespo smashed a heartbreaking shot in the 93rd minute. 

Arsenal needed late goals to beat 10-man Newcastle United 2-0 in the early game, captain Thierry Henry converting an 81st minute penalty and substitute Robin van Persie sealing a laboured win. 

But the real excitement was at the JJB Stadium, where Wigan played some fine attacking football and showed determination against a Chelsea side who won the title last season at a canter. 

Chelsea, whose owner Roman Abramovich has lavished ?330 million on the club, deployed all their attacking force on a team who rolled with the punches and hit back in style. 

Unable to get into their stride, Chelsea threatened little at the other end and it was no surprise when Jose Mourinho threw on new winger Shaun Wright-Phillips and Joe Cole for Arjen Robben and Eidur Gudjohnsen after the break. (Reuters)

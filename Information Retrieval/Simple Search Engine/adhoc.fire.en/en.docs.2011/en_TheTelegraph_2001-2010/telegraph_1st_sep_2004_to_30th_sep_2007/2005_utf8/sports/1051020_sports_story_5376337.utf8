 Pak unveil new pacer

Lahore: Pakistan, searching long and hard for fast bowlers nationwide to tame England in their forthcoming home series, has stumbled on a six-foot six-inch tearaway, coach Bob Woolmer said here on Wednesday. 

Mohammed Shafiq is an exciting talent and although he is very raw, with his height he can help our batsmen prepare for tall England fast bowlers like Steve Harmison, he said. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) launched the hunt for pacers in 10 cities across the country and picked up six fast bowlers for the national camp for the upcoming England series. 

England arrive in Pakistan on October 26 and play two three-day side matches before the first Test starts in Multan from November 12. 

The five-match one-day series follows the three-match Tests. Pakistan have also summoned a few left-arm spinners to the camp to match England spinner Ashley Giles who, with 17 wickets in three Tests, helped England win 1-0 on their last tour to Pakistan in 2000. (AFP)

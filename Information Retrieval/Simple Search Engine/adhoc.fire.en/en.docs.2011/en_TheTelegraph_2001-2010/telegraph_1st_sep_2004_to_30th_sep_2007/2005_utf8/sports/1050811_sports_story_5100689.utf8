The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB get Dias shock 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Salgaocar player John Dias dropped a bombshell at the AIFF Players Status Committee meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday. 

The defender, during his hearing in the committee, admitted to wrong-doing in signing the papers for East Bengal and instead, opted to play for Dempo. 

East Bengal officials, who took him to the capital, were clueless in Dias revelation. Its now highly likely that the club may cough up a big fine for the fiasco around Dias. 

The committee, however, has cleared Keralas K.P. Zubair to play for Mohammedan Sporting. Mohun Bagan had also claimed to have roped in Zubair. The committee fined him Rs 10,000. 

The Big Three put up their proposals to the national body and these would be taken up at AIFFs executive committee meeting.

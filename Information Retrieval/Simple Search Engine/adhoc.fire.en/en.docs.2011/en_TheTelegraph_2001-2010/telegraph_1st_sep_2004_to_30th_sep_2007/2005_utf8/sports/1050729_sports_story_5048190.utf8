 Malik reminded of life ban

Karachi: After being left red-faced following Salim Maliks appearance in a one-day friendly, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Thursday it had reminded the disgraced former captain of the life ban that barred him from playing cricket at any level. 

The instructions came after the former middle-order batsman played in a friendly between a PCB XI and Punjab Governors XI on July 17. 

We have reminded Salim Malik that he is under life ban and is not allowed to play cricket. Naturally, we cannot ban him from playing in streets or in his home but will certainly keep a close eye on his cricketing activities in matches involving celebrities, said Saleem Altaf, PCBs director cricket operations. 

Malik played for a team led by former PCB chief Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia ? the man who slapped him with a life-ban on the recommendation of Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum. 

Altaf said the PCB was stunned to hear that Malik had played at the Gaddafi Stadium. 

The ground was provided because we had received a request from the governors house that there will be a match involving Governors XI and Tauqir Zia XI. At no stage we were told that Malik would be playing in that match, he said. 

Malik has been linked to a Pakistan veterans team due to tour India in September. The veterans tour is being coordinated by former Test opener-turned-actor Mohsin Khan. 

We have heard rumours but until something concrete surfaces, we are not in a position to make a move, said another PCB official.

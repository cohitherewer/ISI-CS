The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Malik hopeful of ICC relook

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Shoaib Malik is hopeful the ICC will consider his plea for bowling again. 

The Pakistan allrounder ? who has been advised to undergo remedial work on his action after it was rendered illegal ? called on the ICC president, Ehsan Mani, at the team hotel on Saturday. 

?I?m hopeful things will be sorted out soon,? Malik told The Telegraph, minutes before leaving for Bangalore on Sunday. 

Confirming the meeting, Mani said Malik?s reports have been re-sent to Australia. 

?He?s had a muscular problem with his bowling hand and hence it?s bending involuntarily. We?re looking into it,? Mani said. 

It may be recalled that Bruce Elliot, the bio-mechanic expert at the University of Western Australia, had conducted tests on Malik?s bowling action and concluded that his off-break and doosra deliveries were illegal.

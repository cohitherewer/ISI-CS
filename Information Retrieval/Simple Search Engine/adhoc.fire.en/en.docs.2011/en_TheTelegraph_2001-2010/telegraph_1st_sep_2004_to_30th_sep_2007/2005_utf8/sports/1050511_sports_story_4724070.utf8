 Sri Lankas interim body wants Ranatunga to go

 - Aravinda de Silva asked not to attend ICC meeting 

 Arjuna Ranatunga 

 Colombo: Two of Sri Lankas greatest players, 

 Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva, were on Tuesday 

 caught in a crossfire between rival factions in the countrys 

 crisis-ridden cricket establishment. 

The interim committee appointed by the government to run Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) wants De Silva, vice-president of the previous board, removed from the high-profile ICC Cricket Committee and replaced by Ranatunga. 

De Silva, who was preparing to attend the Cricket Committee meeting in Dubai on May 16 and 17, said he was told by SLC officials he may not be needed to make the trip. 

?I got a call from Duleep Mendis (SLCs paid chief executive) saying the interim committee wants to send Arjuna (Ranatunga) for the meeting,? De Silva said. 

?A newspaper quoted one of the members, Tryphon Mirando, as saying that I had told him I was not interested in remaining in the Cricket Committee. This is entirely untrue since I have not spoken to Mirando. It is disgusting how these officials can twist facts to suit their convenience. 

 Aravinda de Silva

?I have received papers from the ICC about the meeting and was preparing to go to Dubai. But if my own board does not want me to attend the meeting I will not go. 

?I have nothing against Arjuna or anyone who represents Sri Lanka. But the interim committee is obviously up to dirty tricks.? 

The Cricket Committee, headed by Sunil Gavaskar, comprises former players from member countries who advise the sports world governing body on cricketing matters. 

Sri Lankas elected board, headed by Thilanga Sumathipala, was suspended by the countrys sports ministry in March citing financial mismanagement and replaced by an interim committee. 

Ranatunga, an outspoken critic of Sumathipala and a junior minister of tourism in the present government, was captain when the island nation won the World Cup in 1996. 

 De Silva, Ranatungas long-time deputy, was regarded 

 as one of the worlds finest batsmen till he retired 

 in 2003.

Perth: Australia have recalled fast bowler Nathan Bracken for the opening Test against South Africa on Friday while the tourists wait to see if their leading batsman Jacques Kallis will be available. 

Bracken replaces leg-spinner Stuart MacGill in the only change to the side who crushed West Indies in Adelaide last month as the Australians predictably turned to their pacemen on the notoriously bouncy WACA pitch. 

The tourists, who have never won a series in Australia and struggled in their warm-up matches, were forced to delay naming their team because of lingering concerns about Kallis. 

Im not a betting man but its 50-50 whether hell play or not, South African captain Graeme Smith told a news conference on Thursday. 

Itll be a mutual decision whether he feels he can handle the pain or whether we think itll be beneficial for him to miss the first game and have him ready for the next two Tests. 

It would be a big blow for any team but were a confident team and we feel weve got enough guys in the team environment who can go and win games for us. 

Bracken will join Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee in a three-man pace attack after getting the nod ahead of the uncapped Stuart Clark. 

Conditions here will be fairly similar to Brisbane. I think the ball will swing a little bit for him here, and hes bowled very well in the nets over the last couple of days, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. 

Despite the WACAs reputation as a fast bowlers paradise, Smith the tourists were still wary about the dangers posed by Australias premier wrist spinner Shane Warne. 

Warne needs only two more wickets to break Dennis Lillees world record of 85 wickets in a calendar year. 

Hes a big cog in their wheel, not only does he take wickets but he bowls a lot of overs and holds up ends for a long time, Smith said.Our ability to play him is going to be crucial.

 Atwal charts Woods path in title quest

New Delhi: Arjun Atwal has adopted the training methods of world No.1 Tiger Woods in his quest to claim a maiden PGA Tour title in 2006. 

Atwal, 32, became the first Indian to qualify for the US-PGA Tour in 2004 and claimed four top 10 finishes this season. 

He secured his full card for next year after winning almost $1 million in prize money to be 79th on the money list, despite a conditional card assuring him only a limited number of starts. 

It has been good. I played solid all year, more consistent than I have done in any other year, he said. I wish I had won a tournament but I think that will happen next year. 

It was disappointing because in three of those (tournaments) I had a good chance. It is an experience which you learn by and go ahead and try again next year. 

Atwals rise has boosted Indian golf leading to a spurt in sponsorship and more youngsters taking up the game. 

Atwal, compatriot Jyoti Randhawa, the 2002 Asian Tour Order of Merit winner, and Thailands current Asian Tour leader Thaworn Wiratchant are playing in the Indian Open which started in the Indian capital on Thursday. 

Atwal said he planned to emulate Woods by undertaking heavy off-season work. 

Its just a matter of working hard at home and not killing yourself in a tournament. You dont want to tire yourself when you are playing. 

Atwal said travelling with his wife and son had calmed him. There have been no real pressures on me to do anything. 

Randhawa, 33, praised Atwal for setting a high standard. I want to follow Arjuns route. He is also aiming to win there (US) and that is what I want to do eventually. 

The 2004 Volvo Masters champion failed to qualify in 2001 and 2004, but hopes to make it through the European Tour after securing a card for the coming season.

 Kotla in space crunch 

New Delhi: There will be a big scramble for tickets of the ODI between India and Pakistan at the Kotla as it could have space for only 30,000 spectators, including around five thousand seats reserved for Pakistani visitors. 

The ongoing work in the stadium, which after completion could accommodate 50,000 spectators, will have to be halted by the end of this month to give finishing touches to make it ready for the match on April 17, Delhi District Cricket Association president Arun Jaitley said on Saturday. (PTI)

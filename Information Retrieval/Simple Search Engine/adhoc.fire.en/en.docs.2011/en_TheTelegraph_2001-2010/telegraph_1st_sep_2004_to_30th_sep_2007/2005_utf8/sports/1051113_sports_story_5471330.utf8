 Dhoni closer to realising biggest dream

 - My chances (of a Test call-up) have improved 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Vadodara: Man-of-the-Series Mahendra Singh Dhoni has, understandably, become more confident of earning his first Test call-up. 

Look, Im ready... I agree that my chances have improved... Today, Im more confident of realising my biggest dream ? playing Test cricket, Dhoni told The Telegraph as he prepared to leave for New Delhi. 

Given the tight schedule and hometown Ranchis rather poor air connectivity, Dhoni wont have time to call on his family before the next series. Its disappointing, but its beyond my control, he said. 

Dhoni, who totalled the highest (346 runs at an average of 115-plus), received much praise from captain Rahul Dravid: He accepted the challenges thrown at him and never gave the impression of being under pressure (because of the challenges). 

 If Dinesh Karthick is having sleepless 

 nights, well, one can only sympathise.

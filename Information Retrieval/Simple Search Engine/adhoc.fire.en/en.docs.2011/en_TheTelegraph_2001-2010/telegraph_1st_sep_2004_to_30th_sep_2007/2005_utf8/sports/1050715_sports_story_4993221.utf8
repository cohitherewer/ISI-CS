 Win for Moncoutie, Armstrong still ahead

Digne-les-Bains (France): David Moncoutie celebrated Bastille Day by handing the host country its first stage victory in this years Tour de France on Thursday. 

The Cofidis rider, winner of a stage in Figeac last year, broke clear on the main climb of the 187-km 12th stage between Briancon and Digne-les-Bains. 

Its fabulous. I was really bad in the Alps and I wanted to take my revenge in this stage, the 30-year-old French climber said. 

I wanted it so badly to salvage my Tour. To win on July 14 is just great. Im so happy. 

Another Frenchman, Sandy Casar, was second and Spains Angel Vicioso was third. 

Moncoutie belonged to a group of 13 riders, who had received permission to have their day by six-time champion and overall leader Lance Armstrong. 

The American finished in the main bunch, more than ten minutes behind Moncoutie as he and his main rivals relaxed a bit after two stages in the Alps. 

Armstrong retained his 38-second lead over Dane Michael Rasmussen in the overall standings. 

Frances Christophe Moreau is third, 2:34 behind.

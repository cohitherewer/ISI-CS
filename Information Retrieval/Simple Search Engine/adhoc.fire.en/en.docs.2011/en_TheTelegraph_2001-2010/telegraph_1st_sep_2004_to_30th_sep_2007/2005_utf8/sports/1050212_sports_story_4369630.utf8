The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Lee admits to putting pressure

 - A clash of star views 

 Brett Lee

Sydney: Fast bowler Brett Lee on Friday admitted that vigorous appeals, that the Australian team indulges in, were aimed at influencing the umpires. Lee was responding to Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer?s charge this week that the world champions intimidated the umpires so much that 29 of 34 close decisions in Pakistan?s recent tour Down Under, had gone the hosts? way. 

?Hopefully, being a bowler you can sway the umpire to give him out?, Lee replied, when asked if Australia?s appeals and the country?s vocal crowd could affect umpires? decisions. 

But the fast bowler denied allegations that the Australian team has taken the matter too far. ?I have not seen a problem with the way the Australian cricket team has been appealing and we only appeal when we think it should be out. 

There has been a lot written about it and sure umpires make mistakes, they?re only human. 

?But it is pretty hard for them when he only gets a split second to make a judgement, people get to watch it 15 times at home on replay. I think we should give them a pat on the back because they have done a pretty good job.? (AFP)

 Hari finishes sixth 

 Teimour Radjabov clinched crown 

Dos Hermanas: World junior champion Grandmaster P. Harikrishna finished sixth following a draw with Lenier Dominguez of Cuba in the ninth and final round while Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan won the title in the category-16 Dos Hermanas international chess tournament here. 

Radjabov settled for a quick draw with Russian Oleg Korneev and annexed the crown and euros 6000 following some favourable results in the final-round game, tallying 5.5 points out of a possible 9. 

He was half a point clear of nearest contenders Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia, Ruben Felgaer of Argentina and Russians Alexey Dreev and Alexander Rustemov. 

Harikrishna tied for the sixth spot along with Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine while Miguel Illescas Cordoba of Spain, Korneev and Dominguez finished tied eighth on 3.5 points apiece. 

At the end of the event, Harikrishna slightly bettered his expected score of 4.41 which was enough to maintain the elo rating. 

However, the spate of draws right till the end of the event did not come in handy for the Indian, who was looking forward to adding a few important elo points to his present rating. 

For the record, Harikrishna drew seven games out of nine, scoring his lone victory over Cordoba and suffering one defeat at the hands of Ruben Felgaer. 

Radjabov showcased his opening preparation once again. Playing white, Korneev faced the Sicilian Sveshnikov that is slowly gaining in reputation as an opening that guarantees black sufficient play.

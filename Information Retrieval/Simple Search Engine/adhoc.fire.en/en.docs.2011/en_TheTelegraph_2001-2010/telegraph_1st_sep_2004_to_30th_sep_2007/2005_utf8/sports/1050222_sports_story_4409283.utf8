The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pak pacemen hold the key

 - This can be a make-or-break tour for wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal 

 Rashid Latif

 Inzamam and Shoaib should sit together 

 and sort their differences

Fast bowlers would hold the key for Pakistan in the forthcoming Indo-Pak series, which will see cricket at its competitive and festive best. Keeping in mind the Ashes series, no contest can match the battle between the sub-continental neighbours. 

Most Pakistani and Indian players are good friends. But the pressure created by thousands in the stands and millions in front of television, has its own effect. 

Some players tend to raise their levels and provide cherished memories. The incredible run-feast at Karachi set the tone for the last series. The triple hundreds of Virender Sehwag and double by Rahul Dravid are like badges of honour. 

When Australia visited India at the start of the season, their fast bowling trio of Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath and Michael Kasprowicz got 43 wickets (63 per cent) while Michael Clarke, Nathan Hauritz and Shane Warne had 25 scalps (37 per cent). In the last series between India and Pakistan, 21 wickets (66 per cent) were claimed by Pakistani pacers. 

Indeed, fast bowlers would hold the key for Pakistan. Mohammed Sami is a match-winner but he needs a show of confidence from the captain and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Waqar Younis as the bowling coach will start with an advantage, since he has seen all these bowlers from close quarters in Australia. 

I feel both sides have equal chance of winning the Test and one-day series. The team which shows better nerves and plays as a well-knit unit will come out in flying colours. It will indeed be a close encounter. 

Pakistan have left behind Abdul Rauf, Shahid Nazir and Mohammad Irshad from the touring party and they are all worthy youngsters. I would have preferred Mohammad Irshad as he is genuinely quick and along with Sami, his pace could have been disconcerting. 

The fast bowlers of course will be assisted by the SG balls, to be used in the series instead of the Kookaburra ones. 

SG balls in India are quite hard with a high-up seam. The first 20 overs with these balls by genuinely fast bowlers can daunt any batting line-up of the world. These balls have good graze resistance, hardness and thus are able to retain their shape longer. They also help good spinners. Since these tend to reverse swing a lot, batting line-ups can suffer sudden collapses. 

If Sami amp; Co. can play havoc with the batting line-up, high-action leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, with the harder ball, can play a crucial role with quick wickets at critical stages. Arshad Khan will be a very good spinning foil. 

Pakistan unfortunately does not have quality left-arm spinners and it could tell in the series as you need bowlers to exploit the roughs on the fourth and fifth day. 

Shahid Afridi was a spinner reborn in Australia. He is an automatic starter in one-dayers but if Pakistan find an under-prepared wicket in Tests, Afridi should be an automatic choice. He also can score quickly which could be telling in a low-scoring encounter. 

Pakistan need a left-right batting combination at the top of the order to counter the left-arm pacers of India. Thus Yasir Hameed and Salman Butt should be the first-choice openers. Hameed needs confidence from team management. He is a very good, aggressive player and well-suited to all conditions. 

Younis Khan is one of the bravest players in the team and has a record better than Mohammed Kaif or Yuvraj Singh. He should come at one-down. Number four and five are preserves of Inzamam-ul Haq and Yusuf Youhana. At their best, they easily match the brilliance of Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar. 

Asim Kamal should make the number six spot his own. Technically speaking, Asim is one of the best going around. 

Kamran Akmal has been preferred ahead of Moin Khan and it could be a make-or-break tour for him. A wicketkeeper will find the spotlight particularly harsh. 

Arshad, at number eight, can bat well and his off-spinners could trouble the left-handers in the Indian line-up. Sami is developing as a reliable No.9. Although Naved-ul Hasan Rana played with infectious zeal in Australia, he is more suited to one-dayers like my good friend Shoaib Malik. 

Coming to Shoaib Akhtar and his pull-out, controversy could have played a part in it. 

Why does it always involve Shoaib Akhtar? It is because the team management for the last two years has been weak. One cannot be strict and lax at the same time. Management too needs to be consistent. Shoaib is a gem and it depends on the leader where and how to use him. 

Shoaib and Inzamam need to sit together and sort out their differences. Both of them want to do well for Pakistan. They are the flagships of Pakistan?s cricket. They might have different views on taking Pakistan forward. Honest dialogue between them, carefully facilitated by the PCB, can bring about a common vision. If both play together with pride and passion, Pakistan can beat any team in the world.

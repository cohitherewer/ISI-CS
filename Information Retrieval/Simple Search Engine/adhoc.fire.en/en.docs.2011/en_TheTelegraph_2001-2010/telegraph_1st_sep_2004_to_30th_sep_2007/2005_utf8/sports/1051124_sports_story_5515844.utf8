Calcutta: Team India captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappells Dhoni is special endorsement helped Mahendra Singh get his maiden Test call-up. 

He has displaced Dinesh Karthik and made the 15 for the first Test against Sri Lanka, in Chennai, from December 2. 

What was a dream till the other day, has been realised. 

In fact, Dhoni is just days away from becoming Jharkhands first Test cricketer and his state association (headed by Amitabh Choudhary) is sure to celebrate big. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, Dhonis selection was near unanimous with only South Zones V.B. Chandrasekhar apparently asking his colleagues to give Karthik one more chance. 

Karthik wore the big gloves (in Tests) for a year. 

 Chandrasekhars plea was understandable ? after all, given the way the national selection committee is structured, the zonal representative has to speak up for somebody from his region. 

Parthiv Patels name, too, cropped up during Wednesdays selection committee meeting in Chennai but he wasnt anywhere close to challenging Dhoni. 

The dasher from Ranchi, meanwhile, remarked he was expecting the call and that he would look at the positives and not get weighed down by pressure. 

Speaking exclusively on landing here late on Wednesday, he said: Right now, Im focused on the two ODIs that remain (versus South Africa)? Both are important and each of us needs to do well? The Test comes later. 

Dhoni, it may be recalled, was Man-of-the-Series in the recent ODIs against Lanka. At the Chepauk, then, he will be starting with the psychological advantage and more.

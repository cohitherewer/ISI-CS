Siliguri: A Valentine?s Day victory confirmed India Under-19 team?s love for winning against their English counterparts Monday when they wrapped up the one-day series here 4-1. 

Set to score 229, the Indian teenagers made easy weather of the task with a four-wicket win and 77 balls to spare, spearheaded by a breezy 143 in 113 by Anirudh Srikkanth. 

The visitors won the toss and mustered a mediocre score on a good batting wicket, helped largely by three 40-plus scores from Gifford, Mullaney and Smith. Tight bowling by Rohit Sharma (10-3-23-2) helped the Indians restrict England. A. Rajan and P. Chawla also bagged two wickets each. 

The sizeable crowd at the Kanchenjungha Stadium enjoyed every moment of Srikkanth?s innings. He started from where he had left off in the fourth one-dayer. 

The fireworks from Srikkant?s bat right from the start set the mood and the pace for the afternoon. The young Srikkanth (Krishnamachari?s son) raced to his century in 73 balls with 14 fours and four sixes, regaling the spectators, mostly youth enjoying the opportunity to see international cricket. 

There was no doubt over the Man of the Match selection. The award was handed over by minister Asok Bhattacharya, who was instrumental in converting the tie to a tsunami fund collection drive. 

The venue came in for praise from national selector Dilip Vengsarkar. ?The pitch and outfield are good. More international matches can be played here.?

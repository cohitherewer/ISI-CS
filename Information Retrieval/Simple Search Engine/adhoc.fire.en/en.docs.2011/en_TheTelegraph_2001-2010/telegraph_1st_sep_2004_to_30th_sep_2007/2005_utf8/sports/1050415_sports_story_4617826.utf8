 Hariharan 2nd Indian to officiate at Lord?s

NILESH BHATTACHARYA

Kanpur: Krishna Hariharan will be taking a giant step towards emulating Srinivas Venkatraghavan. The ICC has selected Hariharan and the Australian Daryl Harper as the umpires for the first Test between England and Bangladesh, starting at Lord?s from May 16. He is the second Indian after Venkatraghavan to officiate a Test match at Lord?s. 

?It?s a great achievement. And I hardly imagine that first overseas assignment will be at Lord?s,? Hariharan, who will officiate fifth ODI between India and Pakistan here told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

This is going to be a stepping stone for the Indian umpire to move into the prestigious ICC Elite Panel after Venkatraghavan. But he is not looking that far. 

?The ICC has selected me on the basis of my domestic performance. It means I am very much into their notice,? he pointed out. 

Describing the Lord?s? assignment as ?an extremely tough challenge?, Hariharan has already started doing his homework ?the ball swings viciously in England. Chris Broad (Match Referee of current India-Pakistan series) is helping me brush up my knowledge about the English weather. I will also seek advice from Venkatraghavan and other senior pros in the circuit once the current series gets over,? he said. 

Hariharan will officiate a County match ? between Leicestershire and Derbyshire ? to get a first hand experience of the English conditions before the May 26 Test.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Saturday, October 15, 2005 

 Paris: French midfielder Christian Karembeu, who was a part of the 1998 World Cup winning team and the 2000 European championship, has announced his retirement.

 ?I have no regrets,? said the 34-year-old midfielder, who has been without a club, since the end of last season. ?I want to take care of myself and my family,? said Karembeu. ?I?ve been playing football for 17 years. It?s time for a change?.

 Karembeu, who was born in the French Pacific archipelago of New Caledonia, won 53 caps for France, scoring one goal.

 Karembeu was a French champion with Nantes in 1995 and was a member of the Real Madrid team who won the Champions League in 1998. He also won two Greek titles with Olympiakos.

 London: Arsenal left back Ashley Cole will be out of action for up to eight weeks with his fractured foot, manager Arsene Wenger told the club?s website on Thursday. Cole has undergone surgery on a stress fracture in his right foot and is unlikely to return before the end of November.

 Central defender Sol Campbell suffered a hamstring injury playing for England on Saturday but the damage is not as serious as first thought. He could be fit for Tuesday, when Arsenal play Sparta Prague in the Champions League.

 Bogota: Colombias footballers are going on strike, the players announced the day after their national team failed to qualify for next year?s World Cup finals.

 The strike will begin on Saturday for players at 14 of the 18 first division clubs, the Colombian Association of Professional Footballers told reporters on Thursday.

 The players at the other four clubs in the championship are not taking part in the stoppage.

 The association wants the implementation of formal working contracts for its members and the clubs to pay health and pension contributions. 

 London: French Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne has withdrawn from next week?s Zurich WTA tournament because of a hamstring injury. The Belgian said on her website she wanted to give her leg more time to heal before returning to action. 

 Henin has been dogged by illness and injury over the past two years but returned to win her second French Open title in June.

 The Zurich tournament is the last top-tier event of the season before the year-ending WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles next month. 

 Beijing: The 2008 Beijing Olympics will have wushu, a traditional Chinese sport, as a competitive event for the first time though medals awarded will not be counted in the official tally, the state media reported on Friday.

 This was announced by IOC president Jacques Rogge at the opening ceremony of the sixth art exhibition of sports in China in Nanjing.

 Melbourne: Australia?s Olympic canoeing double silver medalist Nathan Baggaley said on Friday he did not knowingly take banned steroids after testing positive in an out-of-competition test in September. 

 Baggaley tested positive for stanozolol and methandienone.

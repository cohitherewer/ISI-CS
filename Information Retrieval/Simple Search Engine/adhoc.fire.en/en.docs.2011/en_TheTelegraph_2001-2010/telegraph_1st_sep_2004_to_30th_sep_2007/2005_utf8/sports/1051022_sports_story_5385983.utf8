 Harikrishna No. 2 seed

Hoogeveen (The Netherlands): World junior champion P. Harikrishna has been seeded second and will have to fight it out against an elite field in the Essent chess tournament here. 

Grandmaster Ivan Sokolov (rated 2696) of Holland starts as the top seed and hot favourite for the winners purse of euro 4,000 in a total prize pool of 10,000 euros. 

The inconsistent but often brilliant former world junior champion Emil Sutovsky of Israel has been given the third billing in the crown group. 

The four-player double round tournament will see womens world champion Antoaneta Stefanova (rated 2494) of Bulgaria in action as the lowest seed.

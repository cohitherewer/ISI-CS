Madrid: Ronaldo maintained his brilliant record against Atletico Madrid when he struck twice to lead Real Madrid to a 3-0 victory at the Calderon that sent them top of the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

The Brazilian opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the eighth minute after Atletico Madrid defender Antonio Lopez was sent off for a foul on Raul and grabbed his second with a pinpoint finish after the break. 

A miserable night for Atletico ended when defender Luis Perea turned a Robinho cross into his own net as Ronaldo bore down on him in injury time. 

Ronaldo is doubtful for the Champions League match against Rosenborg on Wednesday after twisting his left ankle. 

The Brazilian was carried off on a stretcher in the dying minutes at the Calderon after sustaining the injury when he put pressure on Atletico defender Luis Perea to turn the ball into his own net. 

Real said the damage did not appear to be serious but added that Ronaldo is doubtful for the group F match at the Bernabeu. 

Reals victory put them top with 15 points from seven games, one ahead of Getafe who can reclaim the lead if they win a tough away match at Real Betis on Sunday. 

The game of the night, though, came at the Riazor where a late strike from substitute Ruben Castro earned Deportivo Coruna an exciting 3-3 draw at home to Barcelona. 

The draw kept Barcelona in fifth place, level on 10 points with Deportivo and five adrift of Real. 

Serie A leaders Juventus maintained their 100 per cent winning start to the season with a 1-0 victory at home to Messina in Serie A on Saturday. Alessandro Del Piero scored the goal. (Reuters)

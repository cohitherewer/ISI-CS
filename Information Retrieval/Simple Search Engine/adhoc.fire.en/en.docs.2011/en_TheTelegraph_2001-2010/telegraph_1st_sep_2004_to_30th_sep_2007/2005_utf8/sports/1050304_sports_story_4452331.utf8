Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar, recuperating from a hamstring injury, is likely to play the final Test against India later this month as well as the ODI series that follows. 

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan said the panel of doctors working on the bowler will submit the report on Friday when a clearer picture is expected to emerge. 

Of course Shoaib, currently training in Lahore under the supervision of Grant Compton, will have to prove his match-fitness in the ongoing Patron?s Trophy. 

?He (Shoaib) will only be considered for selection once he proves his fitness in the ongoing domestic first-class season,? Shaharyar said. 

When pointed out that Shoaib?s team (Khan Research Laboratory) was unlikely to reach the semi-finals of the Patron?s Trophy and its campaign would anyway end next week, Shaharyar said: ?We would relax tournament rules and try to help Shoaib to represent any other department so that he can prove his fitness.? The message was clear. 

The bowler, on his part, is giving himself another three weeks to recover from the injury which forced him to pull out of the Test series which begins in Mohali on Tuesday. The second Test will be held in Calcutta from March 16 and the third in Bangalore from March 24. 

?It is so disappointing to be sitting in Lahore while the team is preparing for the Test series in India. 

?But there is nothing much I can do about the injury except to try and regain my fitness as soon as possible,? Shoaib told a local daily. 

?I have been training regularly with Compton and he says I should be fit in two-and-a-half weeks. As soon as I am fit, I?ll play in a match to test my fitness before making myself available. 

?I don?t want to miss the one-dayers as it would be very frustrating if I am not able to make the Indian tour at all,? added the 29-year old fast bowler. 

The six-match ODI series begins on April 2.

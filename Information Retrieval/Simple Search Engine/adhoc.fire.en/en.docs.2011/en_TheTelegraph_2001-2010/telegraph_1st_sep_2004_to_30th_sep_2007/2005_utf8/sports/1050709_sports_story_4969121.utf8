 Trescothick had final word

 - Its ironic that Hussey, a man in fine touch, is not in the Australian Test squad

 Marcus Trescothick celebrates with Michael Vaughan on reaching his century at Headingley on Thursday 

In the off-field sledging that has accompanied Englands recent besting of Australia, the home sides top-order had been singled out for treatment by Australias coach John Buchanan. At Headingley on Thursday, in a match where substitutes were seen but not much heard, their retort was pure Harvey Smith as they romped home by nine wickets, their largest ever margin of victory against the old enemy in one-day cricket. 

Marcus Trescothick, whose bat-dangling habit attracted the brunt of Buchanans criticism after the coach admitted being encouraged by signs of weakness among Englands top three batsmen, made an unbeaten 104 in Englands 221 for one. After a summer of bullying Bangladesh he will be delighted with this hundred, his first in any form of cricket against Australia. 

On a pitch helping the bowlers until a sunny afternoon quietened it down, Trescothick played with authority as he and Andrew Strauss added 101 for the first wicket. An early warning, after he was caught off a no-ball when five, simply served to stiffen his resolve and scarcely a false stroke was made thereafter. Towards the end, when he and Michael Vaughan had the game all but won, he even went down the track to Brett Lee, arguably the worlds fastest bowler. At Lords on Saturday, Lee had almost decapitated him with a beamer and this was a moment of defiance. 

With Trescothick on 81 and with England still needing 70 to win, Australia felt they had him caught behind by Adam Gilchrist as he tried to run Andrew Symonds medium pacers down to third man. TV replays suggested the ball had run off the face of the bat. 

It was not the only incident to go Englands way, as the advantage of toss and with it, the conditions, fell into their lap. Even though England did not utilise their super-sub Vikram Solanki in any meaningful way, winning the toss would have helped that too. 

Afterwards, Australias captain Ricky Ponting said it was the most challenging pitch he had ever played a one-day International on. Lucky he was not about in the 1980s when Headingley really vexed batsmen, and while the pitch certainly helped bowlers more in the morning, an advantage Englands did not exactly grasp, a whingeing captain adds to the impression that this Aussie side are rattled. 

For Australia to take one wicket, and that by Brad Hogg, their spinner and super-sub, is humiliation, especially after Pontings comments about the pitch. Ironically, it was at Headingley that Jason Gillespie first came to prominence eight years ago. But eight years is a long time in fast bowling terms. 

With England fielding first, it was Simon Jones who had the dubious honour of being the first player substituted in international cricket after he had completed his 10 overs. He will want greater accolades than that. Jones should succeed too, though not if he bowls as carelessly as he did in his first spell, when he failed to take advantage of fertile conditions for seam and swing. 

He was not the only offender as Australias batsmen, nearly always more comfortable on the back foot, were not dragged forward enough. When Headingley is shrouded in cloud, as it was during Australias innings, you need to pitch the ball up and hit the seam, something only Collingwood did often enough to reap proper reward. 

Collingwood is becoming as much a banker with ball as bat these days, and this was his third four-wicket haul for England. He bowled full and straight, qualities sufficient for Australians unaccustomed to Headingleys skittish side. 

Only Ponting, his first victim, brooked that trend, when he slapped a short ball to deep midwicket, where Kevin Pietersen, slow to see the ball against a packed Western Terrace, eventually swallowed the chance by his bootlaces. 

The most worrying thing for Ponting is that he normally nails anything short of a good length. If his own form is a worry ahead of the Tests which start on July 21, the ironic blow for Ponting is that Mike Hussey, a man in fine touch, is not in the Test squad and returns to Durham after the final NatWest Challenge game on Tuesday. 

Hussey has certainly looked more convincing than Michael Clarke at the crease, making an unbeaten 46 as he and Lee added 51 runs off the last five overs with some big shots finally unleashed. 

The tough batting conditions meant little grey matter was required to work out when to take the Powerplays as the England and Wales Cricket Board is calling the three periods where only two men are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. With the first 10 overs of each innings compulsory, both sides used their five-over Powerplays successively after the opening 10 overs. They had no discernible effect on the game, though that will change once the bat dominates.

 Inzy hopes to be third time lucky

 - Tour Of West Indies - Controlling Laras form will be the key, says 

 Pak captain 

 Inzamam is aiming to be the first Pakistan captain to win a series in West Indies 

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq hopes it will be third time lucky for him as he prepares to achieve what no other Pakistan captain has done before ? win a Test series in the Caribbean. 

?It will be my third tour to the West Indies. The first one helped me to be recognised as a Test batsman? I hope the third tour would provide me an opportunity to become the first Pakistan captain to win a Test series there,? Inzamam said on the eve of the squads departure for the West Indies where they will play two Tests and three ODIs. 

Inzamam, who burst into the international scene after his heroics in the 1992 World Cup semi-final and final, was recognised as a world-class Test batsman after he scored first of his 21 Test centuries in St Johns in 1993. 

Seven years and 54 Tests later, when he returned to the West Indies in 2000, he scored 135 in Georgetown. 

?Of course, I would like to add another century on this tour but most importantly I am targeting a series win because that means a lot more to the people of Pakistan than my 22nd century?, he said. 

?And frankly speaking, I think we have an excellent opportunity to end the 48-year wait because confidence is sky-high. Of course, we have to keep (Brian) Lara in check. 

?All we need to do is stick to the basics, concentrate harder and realise that after this series there will be a five-month break so why not go on vacations on a high,? Inzamam said. 

It will be Pakistans sixth tour of the West Indies since Abdul Hafeez Kardar took the team there in 1957-58. 

Moin Khan in 2000 was the only captain who came close to winning the series, only to be denied by a matchwinning innings by Jimmy Adams and some poor umpiring by Billy Doctrove in the third Test. 

Doctrove adjudged Courtney Walsh not out off Saqlain Mushtaq but television replays confirmed the ball had taken the inside-edge en route to the close-in fielders hands. Adams and Walsh went on to add 19 for the unbroken last wicket to guide the West Indies to a series-clinching one-wicket victory. 

Imran Khan, in 1988, was the only Pakistan captain to draw a series in the Caribbean. The three-Test series ended 1-1. 

Inzamam, however, will be watching the first Test in Bridgetown only from the sidelines as he is under suspension for slow over-rate during the series in India. 

Younis Khan will be at the helm there, while Inzamam will get the opportunity to seal history at Jamaicas Sabina Park. 

?That (watching from the sidelines) would be tough, my heart and soul will be in the field,? Inzamam said. 

?The series in India provided us the belief that we have the capability to outshine any opponent. I am sure if we could handle the Indian pressure, we can sustain any pressure. 

?We just need to keep our heads down, our feet on the ground and forget the Indian heroics because that tour has now gone into the record books. 

The West Indies tour is a fresh assignment and we are expected to produce fresh results. 

?I think this is a great opportunity for Pakistan to establish itself as a team capable of producing consistent performances,? Inzamam said. 

On the Lara factor, the stylish middle-order batsman said: ?Lara is the key to how we perform. We have to control his form. 

?Lara has been one of the finest batters against spin bowlers including (Muttiah) Muralidharan and (Shane) Warne and on this tour we are banking on spinners in the absence of our main fast bowlers,? Inzamam said. 

?We definitely will have to bowl to a plan against him.? 

Inzamam said his side would be greatly benefited after Shoaib Maliks bowling action was cleared by bio-mechanical experts in South Africa. 

?Having Shoaibs services as a bowler, our team looks stronger and well balanced,? Inzamam said. 

He added with the clearance, Shoaib, who has 80 one-day wickets besides eight in Test matches, could be used in the Test series against the West Indies. (Agencies)

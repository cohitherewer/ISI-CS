The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Third-place play-off today

 - federation cup 

 Osumanu 

Margao: Salgaocar will clash with Churchill Brothers in the third place play-off tie of the Federation Cup on Saturday. 

Salgaocar beat Punjab Police and Vasco before losing to Sporting Clube de Goa in the semi-finals. 

Churchill Brothers got the better of Tollygunge and upset Calcutta giants East Bengal before they were knocked out by Mahindra United in the semi-finals. 

Both teams are equally balanced. Salgaocar keeper Sangram Mukherjee nearly snatched victory against Sporting Clube de Goa by bringing off several saves before Chidi Edeh equalised. They will need another good performance from him on Saturday if they harbour hopes of winning. 

The defence, which was stretched to its limit, would be strengthened by the return of Remus Gomes who was rested after suffering a fall and was unconscious for some time against Vasco. 

Churchill will have to play a disciplined game if they are to win. Osumanu Hussein leads the defence while they have a reliable keeper in Vinay Singh. 

Churchill letter 

Meanwhile, Churchill have demanded a replay of their semi-final with Mahindra, but there is little chance of their protest being trated seriously. In a letter to the AIFF, Churhcill Brothers patron Churchill Alemao took exception to the casual approach of the referee. Their contention is that Surkumar Singh Singhs equaliser shouldnt have been allowed. (PTI)

 Wright: Sachin will score 100 centuries

New Delhi: Former Team India coach John Wright feels batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar still has it in him to score 100 international centuries. 

With many doubting the 32-year-olds ability to reach the dizzy heights of past in the wake of a career-threatening injury, Wright, in an interview to a magazine, said: I am convinced theres another level waiting for Sachin. 

I thought it was going to be this season but the elbow was a real problem. I believe he is capable of scoring 100 international hundreds, the New Zealander maintained. 

Wright also paid rich tributes to the great sporting icon. 

He is the first truly great sportsperson Ive worked with... His humility and friendship have been very special, he said. (PTI)

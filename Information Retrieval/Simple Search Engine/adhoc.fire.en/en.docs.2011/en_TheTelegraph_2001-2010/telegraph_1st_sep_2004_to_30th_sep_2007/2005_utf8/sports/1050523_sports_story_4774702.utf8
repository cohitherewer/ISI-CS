The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Weve only ourselves to blame, says Ferguson

 Arsene Wenger celebrates after Arsenal won the FA Cup at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 

Cardiff: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson believes the missed chances which cost his side victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup final on Saturday sum up their trophyless season. 

Determined to retain the Cup, United dominated and created a string of chances, only to be denied by the woodwork, a disallowed effort and keeper Jens Lehmann as the match ended goalless and Arsenal won the penalty shootout. 

My team played very well, played some great football and created a lot of chances. And you have you take one, Ferguson said later. 

So in that respect, weve only got ourselves to blame with the chances weve had. It tells the story of our whole season really ? weve missed too many chances. 

Uniteds main striker Ruud van Nistelrooy saw his best chance headed on to the crossbar by an Arsenal defender. 

It summed up a frustrating season for the usually prolific Dutchman, who has suffered from injury and loss of form. 

Most of our players are decent finishers, over the years theyve been good, Ferguson said. 

Who knows, its may be just one of those seasons for them. Certainly they know themselves they want to improve that and its the nature of this club to do that. 

Ferguson is convinced United will bounce back from the disappointment of finishing third in the league behind Arsenal and champions Chelsea. 

The test of any manager and player is how they handle adversity, he said. I think our clubs handled that well over the years ? and well do so again. 

Theres a good character in the club... they dont like losing and they will help themselves. Theyre a good bunch. 

Its certainly disappointing to lose games but in Cup football you need a wee break and we didnt get it. Its not a nice experience, but its one you have to accept and get on with. 

Ferguson singled out his young striker Wayne Rooney and winger Cristiano Ronaldo for particular praise. You could toss a coin who was Man of the Match out of Rooney and Ronaldo, theres a great future for those boys, he said. I was proud of them today, they didnt deserve what happened to them. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said good fortune and mental toughness were behind his teams triumph. 

We were fortunate not to concede in the second half because United played well and created three or four great chances, Wenger said. We played a bit more not to lose, rather than to win, and we didnt create enough going forward. 

Wenger believes, however, that United will bounce back next season, telling reporters: I wouldnt write them off. Its certainly a big blow for them but they will come back, they have good players and they will come back next year to challenge for everything. 

If we had lost, it would have been a huge blow because you fight hard to get into the final and you know at the end you have not won anything (over the season). 

Of course, I can have sympathy for United because they played very well and it is difficult to lose games like that when you have the chances. But its part of the game.

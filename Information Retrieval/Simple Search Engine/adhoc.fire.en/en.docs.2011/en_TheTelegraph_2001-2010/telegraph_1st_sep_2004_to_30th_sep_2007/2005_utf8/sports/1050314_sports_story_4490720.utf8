Madrid: Barcelona shook off the disappointment of their Champions League defeat by Chelsea to extend their lead in the Primera Liga to 11 points with a 2-0 defeat of Athletic Bilbao at the Nou Camp on Saturday. 

First-half strikes from Portugal midfielder Deco and French winger Ludovic Giuly dispelled any doubts about a possible crisis of confidence following their 2-4 defeat at Stamford Bridge. 

?It?s been a hard week for us and it was important to win this one,? Barcelona skipper Carles Puyol said. ?We now depend on ourselves, but we need to keep focusing on one game at a time.? 

The victory puts the pressure on second-placed Real Madrid, who also went out of the Champions League in midweek after a 0-2 extra-time defeat at Juventus. Real make the short trip across the Spanish capital to play modest neighbours Getafe, a game they must win if they are to keep alive any hopes of overhauling their arch-rivals. 

Real Betis moved up to fourth in the standings, level on points with Espanyol but nine behind Real Madrid, after a 2-1 win away to Malaga in Saturday?s late match. 

Early strikes from centre-back Juanito and midfielder Edu set the visitors on their way to an important win that kept them in the hunt for the Champions League places. 

Barcelona made a nervous start, failing to settle into their fluent passing game in the face of the pressure from the visitors. 

It was the Basque side which carried the greater threat in the first quarter of an hour, causing problems for the Barcelona defence from a succession of corners and two free-kicks. 

Barcelona eventually sprang into life in the 16th minute when Ronaldinho threaded a perfect through ball into the path of Giuly who drew the ?keeper and laid off a pass to Samuel Eto?o, but the African Player of the Year tripped over the ball and wasted a golden opportunity to open the scoring. 

Eto?o?s wastefulness was quickly forgotten when Deco gave the Catalans the lead after the Bilbao defence had backed off as he approached the area four minutes later. 

The Portugal midfielder tried his luck from 20 metres and Aranzubia was left stranded when his drive deflected off Prieto. 

Barca took complete control following the goal and had several chances to extend their lead before Giuly scored with a superb strike six minutes before the break. 

Frank Rijkaard?s side eased up in the second half but ?keeper Victor Valdes made sharp saves to twice deny Joseba Etxeberria just after the hour and snuff out any hopes of a fightback. 

A point salvaged 

In Serie A, Inter Milan came back for a 1-1 draw at Lazio on Saturday, while Fiorentina earned a 2-2 draw at Lecce and picked up a useful point in their relegation struggle. 

Inter?s 17th draw of the season moved them up to third place and level with Sampdoria, who face AC Milan at the San Siro on Sunday, after a battling display against a Lazio side forced to play most of the second half with 10 men. Midfielder Giuliano Giannichedda was expelled in the 56th minute. 

Brazilian striker Adriano thought he had put Inter ahead on the half-hour but his effort was ruled out for hand ball and Lazio picked up the pace after the scare. 

The Rome side went ahead on the stroke of half-time when the Filippini twins combined with Emanuele crossing for Antonio to bullet a header past Inter ?keeper Francesco Toldo. 

Giannichedda was sent off after a hand ball led to his second yellow card and from then on Lazio had their backs to the wall with Inter attacking with real determination. 

The equaliser came in the 70th minute when Brazilian Ze Maria?s cross was met with a firm and well-directed header from Argentine striker Julio Ricardo Cruz. 

Inter almost snatched all three points in injury time when their former Lazio midfielder Dejan Stankovic struck the bar with powerful drive. 

Dino Zoff?s Fiorentina fell behind in the 28th minute to a thundering free-kick from former Chelsea midfielder Sam Dalla Bona which rattled in off the inside of the post. 

Serbian Mirko Vucinic made it 2-0 for Lecce three minutes later when he showed excellent control to bring down a long pass from Cristian Ledesma and then a cool finish to beat Fiorentina ?keeper Cristiano Lupatelli. 

Danish winger Martin Jorgensen pulled one back for the Florence side just two minutes after the restart and then four minutes from the end Christian Maggio took advantage of poor Lecce defending to slot home a late equaliser. 

Lecce are in ninth place, while Fiorentina are six places behind them in the 20-team Serie A.

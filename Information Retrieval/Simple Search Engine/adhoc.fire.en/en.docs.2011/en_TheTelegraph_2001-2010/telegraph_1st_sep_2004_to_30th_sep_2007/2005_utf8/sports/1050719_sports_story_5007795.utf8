The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greg keeping options open

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Coach Greg Chappell is keeping options open on who will launch the Team India innings with Virender Sehwag in the forthcoming tri-series. 

A problem has arisen as Sachin Tendulkar is recovering from surgery and Sourav Ganguly wont travel to Sri Lanka unless cleared by Justice Albie Sachs. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, Chappell told the selectors that either Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh or even V.V.S. Laxman could partner Sehwag. 

Thats flexibility.

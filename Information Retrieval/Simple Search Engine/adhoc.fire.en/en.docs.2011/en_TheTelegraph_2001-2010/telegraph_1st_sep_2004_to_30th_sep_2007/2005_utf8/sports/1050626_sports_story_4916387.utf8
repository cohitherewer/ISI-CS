The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bachers guidance sought 

 - 2007 World Cup build-up in West Indies 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Four of the eight island nations hosting the 2007 World Cup have sought Dr Ali Bachers guidance in the build-up to the biggest cricket event in the Caribbean. 

Its hardly a surprise, though. 

Dr Bacher, who did a fantastic job as executive director of the 2003 World Cup (staged by Africa), has already visited Barbados, Jamaica, St Lucia and Trinidad amp; Tobago. 

The remaining hosts are: Antigua amp; Barbuda, Grenada, Guyana and St Kitts amp; Nevis. 

It does feel good? However, my contribution has only been as a consultant? Im not involved in an official capacity, Dr Bacher told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Johannesburg, the 63-year-old former South African captain and Board managing director added: At this stage, I cant say whether the other island nations are also going to use my experience? Lets see? 

Dr Bacher, in fact, has been travelling to the Caribbean for a year now. Unusually, though, he has kept a low profile. 

Much of my interaction has been specific to preventing ambush marketing, security and the benefits for tourism? All three are significant, he pointed out. 

Dr Bacher, who currently runs two consultancies, informed he would be deputing two key members of his 2003 World Cup team ? lawyer Clifford Green and security expert Ben van Deventer ? to St Lucia before the month-end. 

Both are extremely competent and will give the appropriate inputs, he said. 

Dr Bacher, whose biography (released 14 months ago) has done exceedingly well in South Africa, is into fund-raising as well. 

Its for my Alma Mater, Witwatersrand University? Im just trying to give something back to a great institution? The funds are to be utilised for scholarships, research and more? he signed off. 

Given Dr Bachers track record, the fund-raising exercise should be a mega hit.

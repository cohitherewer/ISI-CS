Rajkot: Yuvraj Singh hit his way out of a form slump to amass a scintillating half century as India returned to winning ways with a bang, thrashing Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the sixth one-dayer here on Wednesday. 

After restricting the visitors for 196 in 42.5 overs with a disciplined bowling performance, Yuvraj stole the show with a 67-ball unbeaten 79 to steer Team India home with 15.1 overs to spare and give the hosts a 5-1 lead in the seven-match Videocon Cup series. 

While Yuvraj shined with the bat by notching up his 19th ODI half century, young pacer Rudra Pratap Singh returned with career-best figures of four for 35 to wreck the tourists on a good batting strip at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground. 

Mohammed Kaif, back after sitting out the first five matches owing to an injury, showed no signs of rustiness as he coasted to an unbeaten 38 while Gautam Gambhir (28), Virender Sehwag (22) and Sachin Tendulkar (19) failed to convert the starts. 

Yuvraj, having collected only 45 runs in four innings so far in the series, answered his critics with an unbeaten 79 comprising three sixes and nine fours. He added 105 runs with Kaif for the fourth wicket. 

Earlier, Lankan batting did them in again. Only three batsmen went past 20 and more than seven overs of their quota went unutilised. 

The visitors innings revolved around a defiant half-century from Tillekeratne Dilshan. The middle-order batsman, Man of the Match in Ahmedabad, stroked his way to a fine 59 from only 63 balls with nine fours. 

Upul Chandana hit a valuable 30 and then added 29 runs for the eighth wicket with Dilshan. 

Gautam Gambhir once again helped India to get off the starting blocks with a quickfire 28 off 27 balls. Although Sachin (19) and Sehwag (22) failed, Yuvraj and Kaif ensured that the momentum never slackens. 

The sudden drop in Lankan batting form was inexplicable. Although there was a hint of uneven bounce in the first hour, the pitch that resembled a shiny marble soon evened out. 

When the tourists came on to bowl, they struggled to check the Indian scoring rate. The absence of star off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan added to their woes. 

The Indians experimented again with Gautam Gambhir walking out with Sachin Tendulkar to open the innings. 

Sehwag has played 110 of his 130 one-day innings as an opener and scored 90 per cent of his career runs at that position. All his seven hundreds came at the top of the order whereas in other positions he has averaged 16.10 for 322 runs with one half-century. 

Gambhir, rewarded for his century in Ahmedabad, went with his natural shotmaking instinct to provide a brisk start. 

He made his intentions clear with an uppish square drive off Vaas in the first over and then collected two fours off successive balls from Dilhara Fernando. 

Fernando, however, had the last laugh when the lefthander played on to his stumps. Gambhirs 28 came off 27 balls with six fours. 

Tendulkar found the fence for the first time with a rasping cut off Vaas in the seventh over. In the bowlers next over, he stamped his class with an off-drive and an on-drive, piercing the infield. 

But then he mistimed an on-drive off Fernando in the following over for a simple catch to mid-on, his 19 coming off 30 balls and including three fours. 

But there was no let up in scoring as Sehwag took the baton and sprinted at frenetic pace. 

His first boundary was a pull to backward square leg off Fernando which was followed by two scorchers through the point region off Fervez Maharoof. 

Sehwags belligerence, however, came to a premature end when he tried to turn Upul Chandana to the on side only managing a leading edge to short extra-cover. His run-a-ball 22 contained four fours. 

Mohammed Kaif, playing his first match in five weeks, continued to press the accelerator for India with a cover drive off Fernando. 

But Yuvraj soon took charge as he played his strokes fluently. 

He clubbed Fernando for a four and a six in an over as India galloped towards victory.

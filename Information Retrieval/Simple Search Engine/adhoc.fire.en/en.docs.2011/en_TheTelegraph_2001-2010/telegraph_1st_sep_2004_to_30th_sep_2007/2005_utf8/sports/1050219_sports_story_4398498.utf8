 Aleksei may win ?Million? 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Nearly 25 lakh will be disbursed in Saturday?s seven-event card, which includes the juvenile derby, the 1,600m Nanoli Stud Calcutta Million.

There are six aspiring for the trophy and the winner?s 

purse of about Rs 7.7 lakh but the focus will be on Aleksei and Retained Asset. 

The two horses last clashed in the 1,400m Champagne Stakes which was an easy pick 

for Aleksei who was at a significant weight advantage of 5-1/2 kg. At the level 

terms, Aleksei has a task at hand, yet the Vijay Singh-trainee may triumph in 

view of an additional 200m galloping course. Mallesh Narredu partners the Razeen-Remembren 

son.

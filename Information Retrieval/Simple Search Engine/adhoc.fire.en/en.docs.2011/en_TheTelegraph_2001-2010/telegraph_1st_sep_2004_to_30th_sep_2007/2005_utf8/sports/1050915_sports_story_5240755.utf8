 Mahato to run in New York

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The dreams of Bimal Mahato, back-to-back winner of Calcutta Marathon, is coming true. 

Come November 6, the 36-year-old will be one among 40,000 participants to vie for top honours in the New York City Marathon. He, thus, is going to be the first athlete from the state to participate in any international marathon overseas. 

Announcing this on Wednesday, former India coach Sudhir Pal, who is accompanying the athlete to New York, said: He clocked 2::23:11 in the Calcutta Marathon. Going by his timing, he would have finished at the 20th place in New York last year. Hes the first Indian to have got a direct entry there and his entry No. is 22867, Pal said. 

Im going well with my training. Ill try to make Bengal and India proud by putting up a good show. I want to see my father feel proud of me, said Bimal, an RPF additional sub-inspector (Kharagpur). 

On the day of his winning the Calcutta Marathon on March 13, Bimals father succumbed to over-excitement, suffering a cardiac arrest. Bimal swore not to run any race again. He was subsequently taken to a psychiatrist and persuaded to run. 

Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is backing him with a special fund. Singapore Airlines has already handed over to him and Pal free ticket to New York while Nike is sponsoring his full kit. 

Bimal is reaching New York on October 20 to get well acclimatised before the big event. 

We are also aware of Soma Biswas and Sushmita Singha Roys success in the Asian Athletics Championships. Were planning to sponsor them, CII chairman, eastern region, Ravi Poddar, said.

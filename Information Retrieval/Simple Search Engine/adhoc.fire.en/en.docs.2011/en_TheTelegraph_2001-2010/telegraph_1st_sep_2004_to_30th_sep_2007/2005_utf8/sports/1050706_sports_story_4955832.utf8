 Mysore: Take Control, Hero Worship and Al Habib are the three horses likely to be involved at the finish of the 1,200m Anekal Plate, here in Wednesdays six-event card.

 The three horses have been doing well in their morning workouts but the one who enjoys a thin edge over the rest is the Tharun Thimmaiah-ward Take Control. Apprentice M. Mark partners the five-year-old.

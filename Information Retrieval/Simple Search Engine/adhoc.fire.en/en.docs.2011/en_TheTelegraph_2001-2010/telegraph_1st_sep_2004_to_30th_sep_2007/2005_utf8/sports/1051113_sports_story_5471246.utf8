 Indians predictable, says Smith

Mumbai: South Africa captain Graeme Smith on Saturday said he was not unduly bothered with the recent resurgence of the Indian team which has been enjoying a winning streak against Sri Lanka. 

The Indians have played well against the Sri Lankans. But our job is to adapt to the conditions here. We are a very confident team at the moment, Smith said here. 

Stating that India were predictable, he said, the Indian team seems to stick to pretty much the same combination in big games. 

The South Africans arrived here early Saturday morning from Johannesburg, accompanied by a 10-member management staff. 

They will play five one-dayers, the first slated in Hyderabad on Wednesday. 

Smiths confidence is emanating from the fact that his team has been unbeaten in 19 one-dayers in a row (the fourth one-dayer against New Zealand was washed out). Asked if by November 29, the figure would read as 24 unbeaten wins, Smith said, I would love to see that happen. 

We are looking forward to the series. There are good crowds and we have good vibes. Asked if Indian spinners would pose a problem, Smith said: Thats the challenge. It is like you coming to South Africa and saying fast bowlers are a problem. It (Indian spinners) is something we have discussed. We have got players who can handle them. 

The side now has a bunch of talented youngsters. Sachin is also back. (PTI)

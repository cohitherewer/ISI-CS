 Mickelson finally out of the rough

 Mickelson thinks he is in the form of his life 

London: After waiting 12 years to win his first major at Augusta National last April, US Masters champion Phil Mickelson has targeted the next six seasons to apply the finishing touches to his career. 

The 34-year-old American, winner of the last two events on the PGA Tour, believes he is in the form of his life and wants to make that count while in his golfing prime. 

?For the next six years until I?m 40, I?m going to play and practise as hard as I can to get as much out of this game and my career as I can ? to win many more majors,? the left-hander told a US Masters teleconference on Tuesday. 

?I am working hard even on my weeks off. When I?m 40, I?ll analyse what I want to do next. The last thing on my mind right now is the total of number of wins I?ve had or trying to get into the Hall of Fame.? 

Mickelson, who held off a charging Ernie Els to clinch last year?s Green Jacket at Augusta by a shot, came desperately close to winning the next two majors of 2004. 

He led by a shot with two holes to play in the US Open at Shinnecock Hills, before being overhauled by South Africa?s Retief Goosen, and was in contention for the British Open at Royal Troon in July before having to settle for third place. 

He then tied for sixth in the US PGA Championship at Whistling Straits the following month. 

?After having gone such a long period of time ? 12 years ? without winning as major, I now appreciate the major championships a lot more and want them to come a lot quicker,? Mickelson added. 

?After those three close calls after last year?s Masters, it made me believe I?m very, very close to breaking through and having an exceptional career in the majors.? 

The world No. 4, who produced 17 top-10 finishes in 46 major starts before his breakthrough at last year?s Masters, is excited by the venues for this year?s Grand Slam events. 

The US Open will be played at Pinehurst, where he was edged out by Payne Stewart in 1999, the British Open at St Andrews and the US PGA Championship at Baltusrol.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?The Board should close the zone-wise 

 selectors? chapter?

 A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE - John Wright 

 speaks just hours before ending his innings as Team India 

 coach

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 New Delhi: Come Sunday 

 and John Wright?s career as the Team India coach ends. The 

 former New Zealand captain takes to the sixth and final 

 ODI, against Pakistan, with a 68-55 (six abandonments) record. 

 In Tests, it stands at 21-15 (16 draws). Despite a million 

 things on his mind, Wright spoke to The Telegraph 

 for around 45 minutes at the Taj Palace on Saturday afternoon.

 The following are excerpts

 Q Today, what are your emotions?

 A (Grins) At this moment, 

 the desire to win tomorrow overrides everything... I?ve 

 never been able to accept defeats and I would hate to bow 

 out with a loss... Defeats leave an emptiness... Leave you 

 angry, frustrated.

 This last assignment has 

 been tough...

 Yeah... Always knew it would be 

 so, but I?m very disappointed we couldn?t force a win in 

 Mohali (first Test) and allowed Pakistan to get 316 in the 

 fourth ODI (Motera)... We had our moments, but... Some of 

 the results have left me frustrated... Indeed, winning positions 

 against a good opposition have to be made use of.

 But, surely, you?ve had 

 some time to reflect on your innings with Team India...

 There has been so much travelling... 

 But, yes, while driving to Kanpur (from Lucknow) the other 

 day, it did cross my mind there will be people whom I may 

 never meet again... I hope I do, but I?m soon going to be 

 thousands of miles away... Life, though, will go on... I 

 left Kent to coach India and, really, never regretted the 

 move.

 When did you decide to give 

 it up?

 I first thought about leaving 

 after the series in Pakistan (2003-04), but Mr Jagmohan 

 Dalmiya convinced me to stay... Also, I wanted to have a 

 role in another face-off with Australia and Pakistan... 

 I?m going to miss coaching India, but I couldn?t have continued 

 till the 2007 World Cup. My children ? Harry (13) and Georgie 

 (11) need me at home.

 Does a coach have a shelf 

 life?

 Yes... There?s that ?use by...? 

 element.

 What were your thoughts 

 when you took up the job (November 2000)?

 Frankly, I didn?t know how long 

 I would last! I remember quite a few former players weren?t 

 in favour of a foreigner getting the job and... Fortunately, 

 that great series versus Australia took place just months 

 later, otherwise you and I probably wouldn?t have been talking 

 this afternoon... (After a pause) I was hungry to 

 succeed and, more than anything else, wanted to prove to 

 myself I could coach an international team... Of course, 

 I was determined to try and make a difference.

 Did that ?welcome? put you 

 off?

 It strengthened my determination. 

 As you know, I can be quite persistent.

 You introduced a new work 

 ethic... Attitude became important...

 Well, I believe in hard work and 

 I believe you?ve got to be passionate... Moreover, the Indian 

 public deserves a good cricket team. The journey, however, 

 hasn?t finished... Hopefully, the person who succeeds me 

 will continue pushing towards an even better work ethic.

 What?s the first change 

 you brought about?

 Removing chairs from the nets 

 area and stopping the serving of tea and biscuits. At times, 

 small acts make a big difference.

 How long did it take you 

 to settle down?

 Not too long... The camp in Chennai 

 ahead of that 2001 series against Australia helped me and 

 the boys... They got a good feel of what I was all about... 

 Equally, I got to know them better.

 Off the field, what was 

 the turning point?

 Adrian le Roux?s appointment as 

 trainer in early 2002... His presence created a different 

 environment and took us a step further.

 Did you, at any time, feel 

 cramped?

 (After a pause) If I had 

 the job all over again, I would ask for a vote at selection 

 meetings... I would like the freedom to say I talked to 

 X a month back, but he hasn?t improved and, so, must be 

 dropped... Performance is most important, but the attitude 

 factor is there as well.

 Shouldn?t the zone-wise 

 representation of selectors be stopped?

 Absolutely... I appreciate they 

 come under pressure, but only the best team must be picked... 

 I can?t say the Australian or the model followed by England 

 is ideal, but the Board should close the zone-wise selectors? 

 chapter. It may have been useful, but isn?t so now.

 What are the challenges 

 facing Team India?

 Working out the No. 7 slot in 

 ODIs is right at the top... You must have someone who is 

 able to bowl his ten overs... I would look at Irfan Pathan, 

 Dinesh Mongia and Sridharan Sriram... It could even be somebody 

 else. Then, generally, the fielding has to improve... India 

 could also do with a genuine quick.

 Looking back, what has been 

 the biggest change?

 The belief that wins can be recorded 

 overseas... This team has the potential to do very well 

 and a new voice in the form of the new coach is definitely 

 going to have a positive influence.

 Did Sunil Gavaskar?s appointment 

 as consultant, just hours before the series versus Australia, 

 upset you?

 For both of us, it was an unusual 

 situation... He needed time to get used to me and vice-versa... 

 In the end, we ?managed? each other for the two series (the 

 second being the face-off with South Africa)...

 Are you in favour of consultants/specialist 

 coaches or does the regular coach?s position then get diluted?

 Depends on what the main coach 

 wants. For example, Bruce Reid did a terrific job with our 

 bowlers on the 2003-04 tour of Australia... At the same 

 time, having too many people around leads to too many shoulders 

 to cry on... Left to me, I would like to have a say in any 

 support staff-appointment... If the coach doesn?t have a 

 working relationship with somebody on the support staff, 

 then he may get compromised.

 Shouldn?t there be more 

 interaction with the Sandy Gordons?

 Yes, but Sandy is very busy... 

 Also, it?s not necessary that every player needs a pro motivator... 

 Sandy, to my mind, made the team appreciate the importance 

 of having a goal for every series or tournament... The captain 

 and the next coach are the ones to decide whether the interaction 

 has to be more frequent.

 What has been your philosophy 

 as coach?

 For me, the captain is most important... 

 A coach can have vision and set direction, but he?s not 

 the boss.

 There were whispers you 

 were often soft...

 Surely, none of the boys said 

 that... I wasn?t... Had I been so, I probably wouldn?t have 

 been around for four-and-half years. Often, perceptions 

 are misleading.

 Why did you scrap fines 

 for no-balls?

 (Laughs again) Because 

 that didn?t work! The fines didn?t seem to make a difference... 

 Actually, the bowlers have to themselves realise no-balls 

 hurt the team. An honest answer to a simple question ? what 

 is best for the team? ? will solve problems.

 Except a few Tests and some 

 ODIs, you worked with Sourav Ganguly as captain. How did 

 the experience go?

 In some ways, Sourav and I were 

 quite different. Yet, both of us were very passionate about 

 the team and complemented each other... Obviously, the chemistry 

 between the captain and coach has to be right... Sourav 

 gave his style of leadership and I did my role... There 

 were days when we differed, but the bottomline is we always 

 looked at what was best for the team. That we?ve had an 

 excellent group of senior players made things easy. I couldn?t 

 have asked for a better leadership group... (After a 

 pause) Here, I would like to add Anil Kumble has always 

 come through as captaincy material... Potentially, the best... 

 Has all the qualities... Only, he has just led in one ODI.

 Till the other day, Sourav 

 was hounded...

 Captaining India is tough and, 

 in my opinion, Sourav has handled things beautifully... 

 Scrutiny by the Media and everything else goes with the 

 job though... At times, captaincy hasn?t helped his batting; 

 on other occasions, it has... Sourav has injected passion 

 and worked hard at moulding this team. It?s a fact he?s 

 going through a tough time, but it?s also a fact he has 

 to perform.

 How would you describe working 

 with Sachin Tendulkar?

 I?ve been privileged... His humility... 

 Strength of character... His class as a cricketer... It 

 has been a wonderful experience.

 Today, what do you pick 

 as your top disappointment and the No. 1 achievement?

 Losing the 2003 World Cup final... 

 Not being able to win the Sydney Test last year... Starting 

 this season on a poor note (Asia Cup)... As for the highs, 

 beating Australia in that great series (2001) and defeating 

 Pakistan in Pakistan last year... Also, winning the 2002 

 NatWest final, when we chased 326.

 The final question: What 

 are your immediate plans?

 (Emotionally) Going home 

 (Christchurch) and easing off for a month or two... People 

 have suggested I write a book, but I?m first going to assess 

 what I?ve learnt... I?ll clear my mind... I?m going to miss 

 the passion of cricket in India, but I?ve got to honour 

 my commitment to my children.

 Nistelrooy return a boost for United

Manchester: Manchester United are banking on the return of striker Ruud van Nistelrooy to give them the edge in Wednesday?s heavyweight Champions League match against AC Milan at Old Trafford. 

While the Italian champions must cope without their top forward Andriy Shevchenko, Van Nistelrooy has recovered from injury and will bid to improve his astonishing record of 36 goals in 37 Champions League matches for the English side. 

?You see his record in Europe, it?s the best,? United manager Alex Ferguson said before the first knockout round first-leg match. ?He?s a different animal in Europe.? 

Van Nistelrooy scored eight goals in five Champions League games this season before being sidelined for three months with an Achilles injury. 

?We?d have loved him to have games under his belt but we don?t have any concern. We may put him in cold but if he plays in Europe you know he?ll score,? Ferguson said. 

Van Nistelrooy is likely to start alongside Wayne Rooney who has carried his side?s attack recently with Louis Saha and Alan Smith also on the injured list. 

Ferguson?s men are in terrific form, notching up their eighth victory in nine matches in an FA Cup fifth-round tie at Everton on Saturday. 

Milan are also confident after moving atop Serie A. Serginho?s late winner against Cagliari on Saturday lifted the Milan side above Turin rivals Juventus on goal difference. 

The absence of European Footballer of the Year Shevchenko reduces coach Carlo Ancelotti?s attacking options but he still has quality to call on, with Dane Jon Dahl Tomasson likely to partner Argentine Hernan Crespo in front of Brazilian Kaka. 

Milan?s midfield fulcrum Andrea Pirlo is fit again after suffering a knee injury playing for Italy and defender Alessandro Nesta has recovered from flu. 

The Italy international is expected to start in central defence alongside Dutchman Jaap Stam who makes his first return to Old Trafford since leaving United in controversial circumstances in 2001. 

Porto face Inter 

In Lisbon, suspension-hit holders Porto expect to face a packed Inter Milan defence in their first leg tie on Wednesday. 

?It will be a very difficult game,? Porto coach Jose Couceiro said. ?From what I?ve seen, the Italian team is counting on resolving the tie in the second leg. (They?re) coming to Porto to play cautious defence and not concede any goals, aiming for a draw.? 

Inter Milan midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron suggested otherwise. 

?It won?t be an easy match but we are going there to win and to try and have as few problems as possible for the second leg,? the Argentine said. 

Porto were in danger of not making the knockout phase but their 2-1 win over Chelsea in December ensured they squeezed through. The victory against former manager Jose Mourinho?s team was one of the few highlights of their European campaign. 

On Wednesday they will be without suspended captain Jorge Costa in defence and Brazilian playmaker Diego. In addition Brazilians Ibson, Leo Lima and Leandro are ineligible. 

Inter coach Roberto Mancini Mancini made a surprise decision in leaving Uruguayan forward Alvaro Recoba and Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids out of his travelling party. (Reuters)

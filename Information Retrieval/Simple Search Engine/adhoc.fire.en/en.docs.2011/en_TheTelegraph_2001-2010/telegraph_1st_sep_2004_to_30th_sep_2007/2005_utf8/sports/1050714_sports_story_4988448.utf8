 Fit horses may rule on Day I 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainers Daniel David and Errol Bhungard have a combined presence of 27 runners in a total of 43 horses entered in Thursdays six-event card. The opening day of the season may therefore see a complete dominance of the duo. 

 The noticeable absentees on Day I will be Singh brothers ? Vijay and Bharath. By their sheer presence, they could have brought about some balance in the betting and the ring odds. Therefore, under the prevailing conditions, watch out for the last minute wagerings.

 In any case, fitter horses are going to be the key factor and jockey G. Ross, doing duty on the Daniels and Errols runners, may find himself at an advantage on most of his six rides who have been doing well in workouts.

 However, in the two trophy events on the cards ? the Alcalde Cup and the Zipper Cup ? Ross may not have a calkwalk on either of his rides ? Royal Valour and Magical Strike. Royal Valour has not shown any worthwhile form in his winter starts. Magical Strike, on the other hand, encounters a strong opponent in El Cid who is not only impressive in his workouts but the T. N. Jaiswal-trainee is also looking well despite his advancing age.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

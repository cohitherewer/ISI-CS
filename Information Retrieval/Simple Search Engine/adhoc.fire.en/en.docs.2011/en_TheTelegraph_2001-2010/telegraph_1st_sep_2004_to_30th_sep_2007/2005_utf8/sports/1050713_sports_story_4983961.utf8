 Harendra blames it on poor umpiring

New Delhi: Advocating introduction of third umpire in hockey, coach of the junior team Harendra Singh Tuesday said human errors cost India a podium finish in the recently concluded World Cup in Rotterdam. 

We had worked hard for four years for the tournament, but we were done in by some poor umpiring. 

I think its high time that the third umpire be introduced in hockey as human errors can spoil a teams chances like it happened to us in the World Cup, Harendra said here. 

The Indian team failed to retain their title which they had won in Australia in 2001 and finished fourth in the Rotterdam event won by Argentina. 

Harendra, who returned home with the players early in the morning, said the Indians were affected by poor umpiring in the semi-finals against Australia which spoilt their chances. 

He said he was very disappointed with the results since it did not reflect the true potential of the team. 

I feel sorry that we could not retain the title. I am disappointed about not finishing on the podium. 

I am satisfied with the performance of the team, but certainly not with the results. 

Harendra said despite the fourth-place finish, the team played very well throughout the tournament though they needed to be a little more consistent. 

Worlds leading coaches like (Paul) Lissek, Richard (Charlesworth) all seemed quite impressed with the way the Indians played in the competition, Harendra said. 

I must give credit to the players as despite their loss to Spain in the league stage, they pulled their socks up and played brilliantly. 

The team never choked under pressure though it made some silly mistakes against Australia. We dominated the match for most part but still lost. 

Harendra said the team benefited from the experience of seven to nine players who have played for the Indian senior team. 

The coach said the boys played as a unit in the World Cup and praised drag-flicker Sandeep Singhs performance in the tournament. 

Sandeep is not only a match-winner, he is a tournament winner. The boy scored 12 goals from 23 penalty corners. 

His performance is one of the satisfying areas for the team. 

When asked why Sandeep had not been so effective while playing for the national team, he said he has always delivered under me. 

May be some other coaches do not know how to use him. 

Harendra said he would be submitting his report to Indian Hockey Federation president K. P. S. Gill in a day or two.

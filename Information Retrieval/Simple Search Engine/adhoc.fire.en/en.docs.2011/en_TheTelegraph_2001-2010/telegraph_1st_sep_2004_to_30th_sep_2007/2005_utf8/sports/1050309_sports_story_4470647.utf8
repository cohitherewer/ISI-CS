 London: Thailand?s Thongchai Jaidee has been named the European Tour?s player of the month for February after retaining the Malaysian Open last month. The 35-year-old led from start to finish at Kuala Lumpur, carding a 21-under par 267 to win by three strokes from India?s Jyoti Randhawa.

 Thongchai held off competition from Swede Niclas Fasth, who won the New Zealand Open for his first title in five years and Australia?s Adam Scott, a member of the European Tour who captured the rain-shortened Nissan Open on the US PGA Tour.

 A panel comprising European Tour players and journalists choose the award. 

 London: World marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe will not take part in the world cross country championships this month in order to concentrate on her training for the London Marathon on April 17.

 A statement from UK Athletics on Tuesday said the twice long distance champion had decided not to compete in the championships in St Etienne, France, on March 19-20.

 ?(She) has decided she dare not risk compromising her marathon preparations by curtailing her heavy training in the week prior to the cross country race,? the statement said. 

 Lagos: The Nigerian Football Association has sacked five key officials and accepted the resignation of its secretary general following a probe into corruption, NFA chairman Ibrahim Galadima said on Monday. The changes at the top of the footballing body will be seen as a victory for the government, which had been threatened with an international ban by Fifa when it tried to sack the same officials last year.

 Taiwo Ogunjobi?s resignation and the sackings were endorsed last week by the NFA board at a meeting which reviewed the report of a panel that looked into alleged misappropriation of funds by the top officials, Galadima said.

 An interim team would run the NFA, which has trimmed its workforce to around 50 from 125, until replacements for the six officials are found, Galadima said. 

 London: Arsenal midfielder Jermaine Pennant has dropped his appeal against a three-month jail sentence for drink driving, court staff said on Tuesday.

 Pennant pleaded guilty to drink-driving and driving while banned after police caught him driving a Mercedes with a lamp post dragging underneath. At the time, he was already serving a 16-month driving ban for an earlier drink-driving offence.

 Bucharest: Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan?s retirement has lasted just one month with the player saying on Tuesday that he had signed a contract to play with Romanian first division side Politehnica Timisoara.

 The 32-year-old international retired on February 7 after his Swiss club Servette went bankrupt. 

 Lake Buena Vista: Olympic champion swimmer Michael Phelps and Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart are among the finalists for the 2004 Sullivan Award, which is given annually to the nation?s top amateur athlete.

 Phelps won the award in 2003 and was selected as a finalist for this year?s honour after Athens Olympics when he captured a record eight medals.

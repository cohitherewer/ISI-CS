 Were on the right track: Pekerman

Nuremberg: Coach Jose Pekerman was left purring at Argentinas second-half display in a 2-2 draw with Confederations Cup hosts Germany on Tuesday. 

The draw meant Argentina had to settle for second place in group A but that minor setback did nothing to dampen Pekermans enthusiasm after his team twice came from behind. 

The way we played in the second half has got me convinced that were on the way to having a very strong team, the coach said. In the first half we didnt do well, while Germany were in charge, but in the second we were just excellent. We have to be content with that. It was a very good level of football. 

Both sides had already qualified for this weekends semi-finals. Argentina will go on to play the winners of group B, while Germany will face the group B runners-up. 

Pekermans priority is to build a team capable of coming back to Germany to win the World Cup next year rather than to challenge for the Confederations Cup title. 

But he was pleased to see his side survive the first-half grilling from the hosts. 

Really, my view is that we can be satisfied by the performance in both halves, Pekerman said. 

Germany showed how dangerous they can be in the first half. We then showed that we can play football like this against a very difficult rival. That leaves me convinced that were on the right track. 

Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann, who opted to rest Michael Ballack, was glad to see his team taking the game to Argentina even without the influence of their skipper. 

We showed were still strong without the captain, Klinsmann said. We only got one point but we can be satisfied with that. The team is learning tactically, as we showed with our movement across midfield. That was good to see. 

The draw means Germany have still not beaten a top-rank international side since their 1-0 win over England in October 2000. 

Some people may like to go on about that statistic but I prefer to say that its now been years since we lost to a major team, Klinsmann said.

 Australians pin hopes on Hewitt

Sydney: Australia are pinning their hopes on Lleyton Hewitt and Wayne Arthurs forming an instant winning combination to give them an edge over Argentina in their Davis Cup quarter final starting on Friday. 

With Mark Philippoussis unavailable through injury and Todd Woodbridge retired, the threadbare Australians have been forced to place a heavy workload on the countrys two top-ranked players. 

Hewitt will open against Guillermo Coria in the first singles match before Arthurs faces David Nalbandian. 

The Australians will then pair up for Saturdays doubles against Nalbandian and Mariano Puerta before Hewitt faces Nalbandian and Arthurs meets Coria in Sundays concluding reverse singles. 

Everything points to a classic tie and if the rankings are any guide, the singles may well finish 2-2. Hewitt is ranked two in the world and Arthurs 76 while Nalbandian stands 10th, five places above Coria, leaving the doubles as the decisive match. 

The doubles is absolutely pivotal, non-playing captain John Fitzgerald said after Thursdays draw. 

No point in the singles or doubles is more important but if youre 1-1 or 2-0 (down) after the first day, then the doubles is crucial. 

Hewitt and Arthurs have never played Davis Cup doubles together before but Fitzgerald said he had no reservations about uniting them at short notice. We have a lot of respect for the opposition and while were absolutely not over-confident we are quietly confident even though we know theres a big job ahead.

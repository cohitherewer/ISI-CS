 Fit Sania raring to go

Hyderabad: Another wild card has been confirmed for Sania Mirza, and this time, it will be next week?s Nasdaq-100 Open in Miami. For a change, the teenager will be going into a tournament injury-free. 

Having been bothered by an ankle since the Australian Open two months ago, Sania had been playing in pain. And getting good results too ? a third-round showing at the Australian Open, followed by the winning run at the Hyderabad Open and quarter finals at Dubai Open. 

Now the ankle is fine. ?My injury is okay and the ankle is much better. I will be going to this tournament as an injury-free player,? Sania said. 

Sania will be leaving for the US on Saturday. (PTI)

 Yadav wrecks North Zone

 - 14 wkts tumble on Day I 

 Yadav bagged five for 26 

Nagpur: Central Zone medium-pacer Jai Prakash Yadav wrecked North Zone on the opening day of the Duleep Trophy final at the VCA Stadium here on Tuesday. 

The 30-year-old bagged five for 26 as North were bundled out for 104 in overcast conditions. Left-arm medium-pacer Rudra Pratap Singh and left-arm spinner Murali Kartik took two wickets apiece as North collapsed in 50.3 overs after being asked to bat first. 

Central reached 94 for four at stumps, riding a valuable half-century by Naman Ojha (55). On a day which saw a rain stoppage, Reetinder Singh Sodhi was the lone North batsman to show some resistance against the persistent and penetrative Central attack. Sodhi made only 27 but it was worth much more since the track was bowler-friendly. 

North, in fact, made the worst possible start as they slid to 14 for three and, then, 34 for five as Yadav amp; Co. swung the ball around menacingly. Former Test opener Akash Chopra, skipper Dinesh Mongia and Mithun Manhas all failed to get the better of the conditions. (PTI)

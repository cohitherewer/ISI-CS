 Leander Paes cannot resist 

 a challenge

India, languishing for some years now in the Asian/Oceania Group I of the Davis Cup, take on Uzbekistan in Jaipur on Friday for a place in the play-offs for the World Group of 16. 

The old faithful of Indian tennis, Leander Paes, now with shorn ponytail, is accompanied in the battle by Harsh Mankad (ranked 245) and Prakash Amritraj (ranked 293), and his old partner Mahesh Bhupathi who has not made himself available for the singles. 

The well-known Uzbek resolve and fighting spirit will have to try and overcome the testing playing conditions on grasscourts and the blistering heat of Jaipur. The grasscourts in Jaipur, resurrected after ten years of disuse, are reported to be pock-marked with brown patches, with a low uneven bounce. 

These are trying conditions for Uzbeks who play mostly from the baseline and rely on their ground stroke strength and consistency. For Leander, with his great athleticism and cut and thrust style of play, such conditions make him a nightmare for his opponents. 

In view of this, Leander?s decision to nominate himself for the singles along with Prakash, instead of the higher-ranked Harsh, is understandable. On hard courts or other surfaces one would have to select Harsh instead of Prakash. 

But on grasscourts, such as the ones in Jaipur, Prakash?s aggressive serve and volley game will be more effective. A high percentage of first serves followed by a volleying attack could give Prakash an edge over the Uzbeks. 

Though Leander has not played singles for a long time, I do not envision any difficulty for him to adapt to singles. It is imperative in top level doubles to have a high percentage of deep first serves in court and also a consistent return of serve, this also pays dividends in singles. 

 Prakash Amritraj rsquo;s game will be more effective in Jaipur

His recent victories in two consecutive high level tournaments confirm that he is top form. When I spoke to him over the phone, Leander told me that both the Uzbek players Denis Istomin and Farrukh Dustov are tall and strong with big serves and lethal double handed backhands. ?They are very tough, never give up and keep coming back at you. Players from that region are known for their grit.? 

If Prakash fails to click, then as in the past Leander will have to win the doubles. On past performance they seem to be home and dry. Mahesh has stated that inspite of not playing together for so long, the pair enjoys a special chemistry which puts them in top gear straight away. One hopes that the chemicals keep reacting as in the past. 

After talking to Leander, a tie that one thought was in the bag, seems to be a tough proposition. For Prakash, this tie could be described as the moment of truth. He just has to come good and deliver or else with Leander getting on in years Indian Davis Cup hopes will be becalmed in the waters of the Asia/Oceanic zone. In brief, India seems to have an edge in the tie, the balance tilting in India?s favour due to our superiority in doubles. 

One cannot conclude without paying a tribute to Leander. In an age where personal fortune and interest override all other considerations including one?s country, Leander has in typical fashion charged to the firing line risking his livelihood. He seems to be heading for a vintage year with his new doubles partner and clearly it is foolish to risk injury by playing three best-of-five set matches on consecutive days in the blistering heat of Jaipur. 

An injury could set him back many hundreds of thousands of dollars. But, Leander is very special. He cannot resist a challenge, especially when national pride is at stake. We have all seen him dive to bring of a volley, regardless of danger to life and limb. For Indian tennis he has given his all, and deserves a glided accolade.

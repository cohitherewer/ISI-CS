 Aleksei?s case deserved punitive action 

 STAR RACER

 Three fixtures in eight days, and without compromising with the quality of fields, certainly beat early apprehensions about the fate of the season. One cannot help but compliment RCTC stewards for raising hope for survival, and with dignity. One would have also appreciated if the race supervision was raised by a few notches. It would have definitely sent alarming signals to those fooling around with hot-favourites and escaping with lame excuses. Punishments could also be deferred when ?grave doubts? given to the errant professionals are proved.

 The hottest case in point could be Aleksei?s running in two events ? his wretched debut run as a prime-favourite, about three weeks ago, and his subsequent victory, last Saturday in the Indian Champagne Stakes, when the horse simply cantered home. Not denying that three-year-olds do raise their level of performance with an outing benefit but Aleksei?s handling in his first start appeared to be outrageous considering the competence of a champion jockey like C. Alford. He not only needed to be hauled up but also deserved a severe disciplinary action. Stipes, however, did not pursue the matter after giving the benefit of grave doubt to the jockey. 

 Saturday afternoon also witnessed a scintillating performance of a nine-year-old horse Allodium who justified that his 1,600m Gold Cup victory over his much younger rival Calorific was no flash in the pan. On identical terms, the Bharath Singh-trainee handed a more convincing beating to Calorific over an extended course of 2,000m to bag the Indian Champion Cup.

 A correct equipment on a horse strikes a right balance. It did not, therefore, come as a surprise when Magical Strike drew maximum benefit with the support of blinkers as he romped home with the Tambourine Man Handicap. On January 18, the Daniel David-ward had gone down fighting to A?Ma Jaju. 

 Great Ambition and Annotate were the two horses who registered a brace of wins between the three January 15-22 meetings. The latter, a discard from Deepak Khaitan?s yard, put in an amazing performance in the 2,000m Star Contender Handicap when he handsomely beat his previous owner?s property Corvino. Four days earlier the Richard Alford-trainee had accounted for a good field in the 1,600m Fire Flash Handicap.

 Seven-year-old Star Magic?s performance in the 1,200m Calcutta Champions? Sprint Trophy was simply smashing. Favoured heavily by the terms of the race, the Harvinder Singh Bath-trainee scored his third victory in-a-row and earned his ticket for the star sprint event in the country?s racing calendar, the Sprinters? Trophy, billed for the first Saturday of March during the Indian Turf Invitation weekend in Chennai.

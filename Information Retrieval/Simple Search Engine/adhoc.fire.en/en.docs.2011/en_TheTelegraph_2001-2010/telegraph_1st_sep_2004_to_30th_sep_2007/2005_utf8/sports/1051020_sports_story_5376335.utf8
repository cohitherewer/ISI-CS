 Inzy plans spin ambush for England

 - Pakistan may unleash Kaneria, Mushtaq on turning tracks 

 SIMON BRIGGS 

 Long break is a cause of worry for Inzy 

Perhaps the Super Series was not a complete waste of time after all. For Andrew Flintoff, the experience of facing a pair of leg-spinners on a crumbling pitch in Sydney could turn out to be the perfect preparation for his forthcoming tour of Pakistan. 

Inzamam-ul Haq, the Pakistan captain, made it clear on Tuesday that he saw spin-friendly conditions as the best way to go against England. 

The home team has only one advantage, the wickets you play on, Inzamam said. Danish Kaneria has been our main bowler for the past year and we intend giving him wickets which will offer assistance. 

Since Bob Woolmer became Pakistan coach last year, the team has used Shahid Afridi, the irrepressible leg-spinning allrounder, as a foil for Kaneria. But there may be a change of policy on its way, judging by the selection of old-stager Mushtaq Ahmed for the practice match between Pakistan and the Rest of Pakistan next week. 

Pakistan have not taken the field since early June and the season started only last weekend. 

The break we have had is a worry for me, Inzamam said. A lay-off for four to five months is unthinkable nowadays. 

I think England start favourites. We must play positively to dent their confidence. More importantly, all XI have to contribute; one or two players will not be able to swing it for us. But if Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami and Shabbir Ahmed are fit and available, then our opening attack will not be without teeth. 

Inzamam also admitted the possibility that Mushtaq might return. While he has not played for Pakistan for two years, and is now on the wrong side of 35, Mushtaqs 80 victims for Sussex last summer made him the leading wicket-taker in county cricket. 

Mushtaq has plenty of experience, Inzamam said. I am not in favour of blooding anyone in a series of such pressure. 

Neither of the two Pakistanis selected for the Super Test managed to enhance their reputations greatly. 

After whingeing about his absence from the original squad Inzamam contributed just one run to a match that earned him ?13,500. With his expanding waistline and greying beard, he is beginning to look like a cross between W.G. Grace and Santa Claus. 

Shoaib, meanwhile, had run out of puff during the first two one-day games in Melbourne, and was never seriously considered for selection. 

He responded by failing to appear at the ground. In the end, team coach John Wright had to cover for him, muttering a list of medical excuses that included ear and throat problems as well as food poisoning. 

Inzamam and Shoaib have been painted as mortal enemies since they had a major fallout in Rawalpindi 18 months ago. After India inflicted a series-clinching innings victory, Inzamam suggested that Shoaib had feigned a wrist injury to get out of bowling. 

But Inzamam was keen to challenge the rumours. Let me clarify that I dont have a problem with Shoaib, he said. 

If he is fit, it is in my interest to have him in the XI. He looks fit and bowled reasonably well in Melbourne. However, he has to return home and play first class matches. 

Pausing for breath, Inzamam signed off with an almost comic conclusion. I dont see myself as being bigger than anybody simply because I am captain, he said. 

That wasnt the first reason that came to mind...

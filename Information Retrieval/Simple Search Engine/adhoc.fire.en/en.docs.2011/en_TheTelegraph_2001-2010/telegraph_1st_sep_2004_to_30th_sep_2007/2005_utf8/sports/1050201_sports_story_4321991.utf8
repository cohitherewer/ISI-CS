The Telegraph - Calcutta

 SBT hope to match EB

Kozhikode: A sell-out crowd of over 30,000 promises a festive mood and a keen tussle at the renovated Corporation Stadium, which will be hosting a National League match after a gap of over seven years. 

Local side State Bank of Travancore (SBT) will take on defending champions East Bengal in the fifth round of the ninth National League for the ONGC Cup on Tuesday. 

?There is an overwhelming response to the match and we expect a full house. But we are praying that rain do not play spoilsport at the eleventh hour,? Kozhikode District Football Association sources said. 

Notwithstanding overcast conditions and intermittent downpour since Sunday, soccer fans from across the Malabar region had come to purchase tickets to witness the match. 

With eight points in four rounds, the red and gold outfit, aiming for a hattrick of titles, are certainly hot favourites, but SBT, with only four points in as many rounds, is likely to play with the home ground advantage. 

?No doubt, we are the underdogs but our boys will play an attacking game from the word go to put pressure on the rivals,? SBT coach Mohammed Najeeb said. (PTI)

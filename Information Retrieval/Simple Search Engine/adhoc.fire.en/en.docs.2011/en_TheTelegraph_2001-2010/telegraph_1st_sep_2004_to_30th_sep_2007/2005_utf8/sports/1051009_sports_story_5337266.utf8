 Jeev shares 13th spot

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh never recovered from his poor start of two bogeys in first three holes and ended two-over 74 for the day. He slipped to tied 13th at the end of three rounds in the 120 million yen Coca Cola Tokai Golf Classic here Saturday. 

Jeev, who had rounds of 65 and 71 and was tied second overnight after the first two days, struggled through the day and managed just one birdie against three bogeys. 

The leader was Young Eun Yang, who shot a brilliant 65 which had two eagles.

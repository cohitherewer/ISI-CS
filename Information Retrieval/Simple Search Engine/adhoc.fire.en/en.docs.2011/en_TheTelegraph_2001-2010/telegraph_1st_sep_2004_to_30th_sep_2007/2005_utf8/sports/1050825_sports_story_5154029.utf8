 Subhas: EB my top priority 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is likely to name a new coach of the national team on September 20, when its executive committee sits to discuss the possible replacements of Sukhwinder Singh. 

The current India coach has apparently lost the federations confidence following Indias disastrous tours of Pakistan (1-1 draw) and Fiji (0-3 loss, including one against a local club side). 

It has been learnt that Indias performance in the post-Stephen Constantine period was brought in briefly for discussion during the AIFF technical committee meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday and the issue of any change in the hot seat was subsequently referred to the executive committee. 

East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, who has suddenly pitchforked into the race for the national post, however, has refused comment till the AIFF intimation to this effect reached him. 

Nobody from the AIFF has told me that Im in the race as of now? Ill give it a thought only when I get any intimation from the federation. But make no mistake, I feel proud to coach East Bengal and the club will be my top priority, Bhowmick remarked on Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, I.M. Vijayan feels Bhowmick should get the post since hes No. 1, well-conversed with the modern techniques? In fact, he should have been appointed to the post much earlier. 

Its no surprise that Bhowmick is banking on the veteran striker. 

Vijayan is still another name for quality and technique? he has still about two-three years of football left in him. the coach said. 

Meanwhile, Mike Okoro is set to land on Saturday.

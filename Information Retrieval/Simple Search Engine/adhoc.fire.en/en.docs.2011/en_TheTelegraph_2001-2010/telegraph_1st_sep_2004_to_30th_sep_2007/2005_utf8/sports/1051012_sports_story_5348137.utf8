 Happy with my show so far: Neelotpal

 - ASIAN CHESS 

 Neelotpal is aiming for third GM norm 

Hyderabad: Zhang Zhong and Li Shilong of China emerged joint leaders with 4.5 points after five rounds in the Asian Chess Championship here. 

However, youngsters and Grandmaster title aspirants Neelotpal Das and Sundararajan Kidambi raised Indias hopes in the elite competition. 

Before the rest day on Tuesday, Neelotpal registered three straight wins (all against Indians) in the first three rounds and split the point in the next two against higher rated foreign opponents. 

The bespectacled Calcuttan defeated International Masters Sunil Mokal Prathamesh, Valay Parik and fellow ONGC player Lanka Ravi in the first three rounds to share joint lead with the Chinese. 

The GM aspirant, who requires one more norm, says he is satisfied with his performance so far. 

Im happy with my performance so far. I defeated three Indians and held much higher rated Grandmasters in the next two rounds, he said. 

He was, however, a bit shaky in the fifth game against Susanto Megaranto of Indonesia, appearing uncomfortable in the middle game. 

Yes, I could not go for a win due to positional disadvantage and had to sign the peace, Neelotpal said. 

A full point could have placed him in joint lead for the top slot. 

With four more rounds remaining, Neelotpal remains noncommittal on his chances of winning the title. Im aiming my third GM norm, the Calcuttan said. 

S. Kidambi created a flutter in the tournament when he drew with second seed Darmen in the second game and thrashed top seed Krishnan Sasikiran in the fifth round. 

Top billed Sasikiran ? who lost to Zhao Jun of China and Kidambi ? would have to cover a lot of ground to bounce back into contention, while Koneru Humpy, after losing her first game to Himansu Sharma, remains in contention with 4 points.

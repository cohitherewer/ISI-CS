 Athens: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) hailed the 2004 Athens Olympics as a marketing success. ?The Athens 2004 marketing report heralds the success of Olympic marketing programmes and the power of Olympic partnership,? IOC president Jacques Rogge said in the document?s introduction on Friday.

 According to the document, 3.58 million tickets were sold in the August 13-29 games ? more than in Barcelona 1992 and Atlanta 1996 Games but short of the 6.7 million tickets of the Sydney Olympics in 2000.

 Ticket sales generated revenues of 202.5 million euros ($260 million) compared with initial forecasts of 183 million euros. The IOC qualified the Games? licensing programmes as a ?tremendous success? as licence fees reached 86 million euros, beating forecasts by 26 per cent. 

 Wilmington (USA): Jennifer Capriati has been sidelined from the WTA Tour indefinitely after undergoing successful arthroscopic surgery here to repair a torn labrum in her right shoulder.

 There was no indication when the 28-year-old American would be able to return to the global women?s tennis circuit.

 Capriati won the 2001 and 2002 Australian Open titles as well as the 2001 French Open. But the injury kept her from playing at this year?s Australian Open and the surgery could keep her out for months more.

 Islamabad: With the tour of India barely a month away, diplomat-turned Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan has come out with a book which draws on his experience as team manager for the 1999 trip to India and the 2003 World Cup.

 Titled A bridge of peace, the book was launched by Wasim Akram and leader of the India-Pakistan Peace Forum, Dr Mubashir Hasan in Karachi on Friday. The book is based on the diaries maintained by him during the Pakistan team?s eventful tour of India and the disappointing trip to South Africa for the World Cup which saw the team being ousted prematurely.

 New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa blew his chances after carding a two-over 74 in the third round of the $1 million Caltex Masters golf in Singapore on Saturday.

 Randhawa was in a bunch of 13 who had a score of 215, 12 strokes behind Nick Dougherty of England. Amandeep Johl had two under 70 but his overall 216 was less better than Randhawa?s.

 Dougherty birdied the final three holes for a four-under-par 68 and take a two-shot lead over the duo into the final round of the Asian Tour event jointly sanctioned by the European tour.

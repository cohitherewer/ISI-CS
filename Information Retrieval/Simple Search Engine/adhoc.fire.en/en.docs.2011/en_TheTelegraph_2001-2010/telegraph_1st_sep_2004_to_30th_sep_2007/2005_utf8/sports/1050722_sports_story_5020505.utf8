 Lleyton ties the knot with Bec

Sydney: Australian tennis ace Lleyton Hewitt and his pregnant soap star fianc?e Bec Cartwright completed their love match on Thursday ? tying the knot in a lavish ceremony at the landmark Sydney Opera House. 

The former Wimbledon and US Open champion, the worlds No. 2 ranked player, proposed to Cartwright ? a long-time cast member of Australian soap opera Home and Away ? just hours after losing the Australian Open final to Russian Marat Safin at Melbourne Park in January. 

The couple had been dating for six weeks before Hewitt proposed. Hewitt, 24, had been engaged to Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters until last October. 

Hewitt and Cartwright, 21, have bought a multimillion dollar home on one of Sydneys northern beaches and are expecting their first child later this year. 

Hundreds of fans gathered outside the Opera House missed seeing the couple, as Hewitt and Cartwright arrived separately and were driven directly into a car park beneath the venue. 

 John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Todd Woodbridge and Wayne Arthurs, Hewitts former Davis Cup mentors or teammates, were among the estimated 180 guests. 

After the ceremony, the newlyweds reportedly were to take a cruise across Sydney Harbour before being serenaded at their reception in the citys Taronga Park Zoo by Aussie vocalist John Farnham. (AP)

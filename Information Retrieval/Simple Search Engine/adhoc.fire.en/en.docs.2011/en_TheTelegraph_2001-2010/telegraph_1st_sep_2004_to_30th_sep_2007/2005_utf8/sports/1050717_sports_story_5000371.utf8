 Botham: Pietersen key to stopping McGrath

 - ASHES SERIES 

 Pietersen believes he has ticked all the right boxes for selection 

London: Kevin Pietersen is set to make his Test debut in next weeks Ashes opener against Australia with many people adamant he is representing the wrong country. But if the unorthodox batsman helps England win the Ashes for the first time in nearly 20 years, few home fans will care he was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. 

If he fails there will be those wondering, just as they did 20 years ago in the case of Zola Budd ? the South African-turned British athlete ? why a nation of 60 million people is relying on overseas-raised talent. 

Pietersen, 25, who qualifies for England on account of his mother Pennys birth, rejected the South Africans because he feared a racial quota selection policy was restricting his chances of selection. 

It was a bold move but one in keeping with the character of Pietersen, whose supreme self-confidence is reminiscent of South African-born all-rounder Tony Greig, Englands captain in the mid-1970s but later branded not English through and through when he defected to Kerry Packers rebel World Series Cricket. 

Pietersen made his name in England at Nottinghamshire before leaving under acrimonious circumstances last year and moving to Hampshire where in his new captain, Australian leg-spin great Shane Warne, he found a kindred spirit. 

Unlike many English cricketers, Pietersen is not afflicted by absurd modesty as was proved when, after cementing his place in the Test squad with a rapid 74 world champions Australia in an eight-wicket defeat at The Oval on Tuesday, he said he thought hed done enough and ticked all the right boxes. 

But to those who thought he was all mouth, Pietersen responded during Englands one-day series in South Africa earlier this year by scoring 454 runs at an average of 151.33 including the fastest century by an England batsman in a limited-overs international, off 69 balls, at East London. 

It was in South Africa that the cricket world as a whole became aware of Pietersens extraordinary eye and ability to manoeuvre the ball for runs into unusual areas, particularly on the leg-side. 

After being left out of the two home Tests against Bangladesh, Pietersen scored 91 not out in just 65 balls to set-up an unlikely three-wicket win over Australia in a one-day International in Bristol last month ? an innings labelled genius-like by England captain Michael Vaughan. 

In selecting him for Lords ahead of 100-cap veteran Graham Thorpe, at 35 ten years Pietersens senior ? the selectors were making a statement of intent. Attritional innings of the kind the Surrey left-hander specialises in are unlikely to be enough to unsettle Australias quicks. 

Although there are those who believe Pietersen will have his technique exposed in the Test arena, England great Ian Botham said he was well worth his place. England will need to stop Glenn McGrath from settling into a metronomic rhythm outside off-stump. Pietersens unorthodox approach might be the key. 

Pietersen, who admitted he had big shoes to fill in replacing Thorpe, insisted he would not allow the hype to distract him and added that nothing sledging-masters Australia said to him could possibly compare to the verbal abuse he received in South Africa. 

I am going to play my natural game and if it comes off it comes off. I think me coming into cricket against the country I turned my back on, there was loads of pressure there and I came out OK. (AFP)

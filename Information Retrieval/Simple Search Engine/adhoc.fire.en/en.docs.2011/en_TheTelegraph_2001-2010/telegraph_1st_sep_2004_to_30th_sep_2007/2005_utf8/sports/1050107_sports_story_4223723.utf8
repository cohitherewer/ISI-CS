The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Devang is Bengal captain

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Middle-order batsman Devang Gandhi was, as expected, named Bengal captain and would lead the side in the forthcoming East Zone one-day tournament commencing at the Eden Gardens Tuesday. 

Gandhi, who has the experience of leading the side earlier, succeeded Rohan Gavaskar, who stepped down from captaincy in the face of criticism over Bengal?s poor performance this season. 

Devang edged teammate Laxmi Ratan Shukla for the captain?s post. The squad will be selected on Friday. 

The squad might see a few changes from the one that played the Ranji Trophy. Under-19 wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha might replace Deep Dasgupta.

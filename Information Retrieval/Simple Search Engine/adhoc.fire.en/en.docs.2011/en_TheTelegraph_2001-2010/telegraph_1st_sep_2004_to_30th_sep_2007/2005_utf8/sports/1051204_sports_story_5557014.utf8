The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sunday, December 04, 2005 

 London: Harry Redknapp has quit as manager of Southampton, club chairman Rupert Lowe told the club?s website on Saturday.

 Lowe said: ?He told me that he regarded his employment with the club as being at an end and that he would deal with the necessary paperwork at the beginning of next week.?

 Redknapp has been strongly linked with a return to Premier League Portsmouth, a club he left a year ago.

 Portsmouth, third from bottom of the league with only two wins in 14 matches, sacked French manager Alain Perrin last week.

 Redknapp walked out on Portsmouth after differences with chairman Milan Mandaric, angering many of their fans two weeks later by joining bitter south coast rivals Southampton.

 Madrid: Spain coach Luis Aragones says the injuries to Barcelona midfielder Xavi and Real Madrid striker Raul are a major blow to his plans ahead of the World Cup finals in Germany next year.

 ?They are very important players. They are fixtures in the side who are difficult to replace and I would prefer both of them to be there,? Aragones said on Saturday. ?All we can do now is wait and see if they are able to return in time.?

 Two weeks ago Spain captain Raul suffered a partial ligament tear in his left knee which will keep him out of action for at least two months.

 Xavi, 25, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during training on Friday. The club expect him to be laid low for six months.

 Tokyo: Gamba Osaka won 4-2 at Kawasaki Frontale on Saturday to become Japanese champions for the first time as city rivals Cerezo suffered final day heartbreak.

 Gamba began the day a point behind Cerezo Osaka but Cerezo were stunned by a last-minute equaliser in a 2-2 home draw with FC Tokyo.

 Gamba finished the season with 60 points from 34 games with four teams on 59 in the closest title race since the J-League was launched in 1993.

 Melbourne: A nervous Jelena Dokic arrived back in Australia for the first time in almost five years on Saturday.

 Dokic, who left Australia in 2001 after her father and coach Damir accused Australian Open officials of rigging the draw against her, has chosen to abandon her native Serbia-Montenegro to return to her former adopted homeland.

 The 22-year-old, who emigrated to Australia with her family in 1994 and played for the country in the Fed Cup and at the Sydney Olympics, now has little contact with her father.

 ?I was a little bit nervous coming here,? Dokic said on arrival in Melbourne.?I?m even happier with my decision now.

 ?It will be tough, not everyone will agree with my decision. I?m really excited about coming here.?

 Dokic, who will attend a Tennis Australia camp at Melbourne Park next week, is chasing a wildcard entry for next month?s Australian Open. Her world ranking has slumped to 349.

 Lake Louise: Italian Elena Fanchini earned her maiden World Cup win in the opening downhill of the season on Friday.

 Fanchini, world championship silver medallist, clocked 1:49.33 to beat Austria?s World Cup super-G champion Michaela Dorfmeister by 0.10 seconds. Austrian Alexandra Meissnitzer was third in 1:49.61. Overall World Cup champion Anja Paerson pulled up early on her run and did not complete the course.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sachin calls on Dalmiya

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sachin Tendulkar at the Eden on Saturday 

Calcutta: Maestro Sachin Tendulkar, in the news over the past few days for joining the 10,000 Test runs? club and being wrongly given out, made a ?courtesy call? on Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) strongman Jagmohan Dalmiya on Saturday. 

Sachin met Dalmiya, the BCCI?s immediate past president, for around ?25 minutes? in the morning. Apparently, BCCI joint-secretary Goutam Das Gupta too was present. 

It was learnt by The Telegraph that the Steve Bucknor error, which stopped the maestro on 52 on the third day, was ?strictly informally? talked about. 

Dalmiya is a former ICC president as well and it won?t surprise if he uses his influence within the world body (headed by good friend Ehsan Mani) to ensure the umpires? performances get reviewed even more stringently. 

Sachin, one understands, also spoke of the sightscreen at the Eden?s Club House end which had to be extended at his request in the Indian second innings. 

This was the first Dalmiya-Sachin meeting in quite a while.

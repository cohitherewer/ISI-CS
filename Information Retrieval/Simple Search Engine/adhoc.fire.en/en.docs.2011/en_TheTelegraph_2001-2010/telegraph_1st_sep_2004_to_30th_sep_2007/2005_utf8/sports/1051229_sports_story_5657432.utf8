 Virtual walkover for Princess 

 STAR RACER

 Supreme Princess had migrated from south with a specific goal ? the Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks ? which she achieved last Saturday in the hands of jockey B. Prakash.

 However, trainer Daniel David may not have thought in his wildest dream that the Ladies Derby would be a virtual walkover for her. With Romantic Liaison already departed from the scene for greener pasture in western India, Sanskara was always going to be a tough customer for the Princess. 

 But not all has been well with the Bharath Singh-trainee since winning the Monsoon Derby. A bout of fever, early in the month had perhaps much to do with her newly acquired high-stung nature, which caused her last minute withdrawal from a mock race, and the also from the Oaks field.

 Nevertheless, the 2,400m race was left with three runners ? the 6-10 hot-favourite Princess, her stablemate, Star Memories, and the Vijay Singhs hopeful Ardennes who, unfortunately, burst blood vessels during the race.

 Therefore, the Princess had the battle half-won before the start and there is no point getting into the nitty gritty of race running, excepting that Star Memories showed Supreme Princess the way till the top of the final turn before the favourite took over and cruised for a five-length-plus victory.

 There were thrills aplenty otherwise in the eight-event card, which also witnessed a scintillating victory of Daniels Best Of The Blues in the hands of Prakash.

 The Warrshan-Briar Creek speedster won the 1,100m Breeders Cup, relegating a heavily fancied Whistler to a non-entity. However, Whistler may have done better had the debutante maintained a straight course.

 Daniels Proud Native was simply smashing in the 1,600m Darbhanga Cup in which the three-year-old made mockery of Vijays an equally fancied and seasoned Absolute Luxury, despite losing a favourable position at the start. The Flitch-Issabelle son is destined more wins this season.

 Daniel also had the satisfaction of seeing his trainee, Retained Asset, bouncing into the form in the 1,400m T.N. Banerjea Cup, which the Warrshan-Autumn Affair three-year-old won with a degree of comfort from a late finishing Cameo Role.

 Both, Proud Native and Retained Asset were jockey G. Ross winning rides for Daniel, who had a haul of four winners on the day.

 Pacific Beauty, in the 1,200 Star Precision Handicap, produced a sizzling gallop in the stretch run to present trainer Farley Rodrigues his first winner for MAM Ramaswamy since he acquired a sizeable string of horses from the baron about six months ago.

 Prakash, literally has to do nothing specific while guiding the Mazilier-filly to victory.

 Robin Corners Melodramatics transition ? from a sprint to a staying trip ? was no experiment but it was a matter of confidence, which the even-money ring odds of the filly substantiated. She complemented the trainer by winning the 2,000m Silver Handicap far more comfortably than the official verdict of a length and-a-half.

 However, Aliventis debut drubbing of a seasoned campaigner, Hunters Paradise, was incredible. The Warrshan-Anodyne daughter now leaves for Mumbai where she may also score.

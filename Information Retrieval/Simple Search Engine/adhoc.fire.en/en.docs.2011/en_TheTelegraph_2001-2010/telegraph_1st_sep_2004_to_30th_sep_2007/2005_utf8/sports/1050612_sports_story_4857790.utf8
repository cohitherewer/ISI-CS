 Dinesh Mongia unimpressive

London: Dinesh Mongia failed to shine with the bat, making just 21 as his side Leicestershire slumped to a huge 95-run defeat against the visiting Australians in a limited-overs cricket match in Leicester on Saturday. 

Mongia, coming in to bat when Leicestershire were 51 for two in reply to Australias mammoth 321 for four in 50 overs, accumulated his runs from 23 balls before being dismissed by Brad Hogg. 

The left-arm spinner was the pick of the Australian bowlers, returning figures of three for 56, as the home side managed 226 for eight in their allotted 50 overs. Otis Gibson top-scored for the losers with 50. 

Earlier, the visitors plundered 321 runs with Mathew Hayden slamming a 96-ball 107, that included 13 boundaries and two sixes. 

Mongia, who had eight overs of slow left-arm spin, gave away 49 runs without claiming any wicket. 

The Indian, however, had a hand in the dismissals of Hayden and Australian captain Ricky Ponting (7) as he latched on to their catches off the bowling of David Masters and Darren Maddy, respectively. 

Meanwhile, the Surrey-Middlesex match at Lords ended in a draw with Harbhajan Singh picking up one wicket, as Middlesex declared their second innings at 353 for six. Harbhajan bowled 10 overs, conceding 37 runs including a couple of maidens.

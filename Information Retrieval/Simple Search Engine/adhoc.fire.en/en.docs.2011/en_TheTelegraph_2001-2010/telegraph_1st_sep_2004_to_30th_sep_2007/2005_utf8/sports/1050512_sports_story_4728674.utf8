 London: United States tennis chiefs have splashed out on a new $650,000 men?s tournament to act as a warm-up for the US Open.

 The event, owned by the United States Tennis Association (USTA), will be staged at the Connecticut Tennis Center at Yale University the week before the August 29-September 11 Grand Slam.

 It will be played alongside the existing WTA Pilot Pen Tennis tournament creating the first combined men?s and women?s summer tournament leading into the final Slam of the year.

 The tournament replaces the $675,000 TD Waterhouse Cup at Long Island that had been the traditional men?s warm-up event for Flushing Meadow.

 Santiago: Union Espanola goalkeeper Ignacio Gonzalez has been given a 22-match ban for punching a referee and knocking him to the ground during Sunday?s Chilean championship match at San Felipe.

 The ban effectively rules him out of soccer for the rest of this year and possibly the start of 2006. It was imposed by a disciplinary tribunal on Tuesday, the Chilean football league said on their official website.

 The incident took place in the 40th minute of San Felipe?s 2-1 win after the 33-year-old Argentine, who joined Union at the start of this year, became enraged over the award of a free kick on the edge of his penalty area.

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil?s 1970 World Cup winning coach Mario Zagallo has undergone a four-hour operation for an intestinal problem, hospital officials said on Tuesday.

 ?The doctors managed to unblock the patient?s duodenum,? said a statement issued by the Samaritano hospital in Rio de Janeiro, where Zagallo has been for a week. ?The operation was considered a success.?

 Zagallo, who also won the 1958 and 1962 World Cups as a player and coached his country at the 1974 and 1998 World Cups, currently has a role as Brazils technical advisor.

 It was not known when the 73-year-old would be discharged.

 Rio de Janeiro: Former Argentina captain and coach Daniel Passarella was fired by Corinthians on Tuesday after only 15 matches in charge of the Brazilian club. He was the second coach to lose his job at the newly-rich club since they signed a controversial multi-million dollar partnership with London-based Media Sports Investments at the end of last year.

 Corinthians have already been knocked out of the Copa Brasil and have failed to win any of their first three matches in the Brazilian championship.

 Madrid: Real Madrid are close to completing their first official feature film called Real, The Movie which will be presented in several countries during their international tour this summer.

 ?The film has been shot on location in New York, Tokyo, Caracas, Senegal and Madrid and shows five part-fiction, part-reality stories, all linked to Real Madrid,? an official press release from the club said on Tuesday.

 New Delhi: ESPN-STAR Sports will telecast live the Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament to be held in Kuala Lumpur from May 26 to June 5. The channel will show 23 matches of the tournament for the Indian audiences for the first time, a press release said on Wednesday.

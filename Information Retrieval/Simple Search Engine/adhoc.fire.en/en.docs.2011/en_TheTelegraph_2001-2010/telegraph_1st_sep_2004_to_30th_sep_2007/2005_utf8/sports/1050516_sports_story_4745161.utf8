Sofia: Viswanathan Anand drew his third straight game, signing peace with former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine in quick time in the third round of the MTel masters chess meet here. 

In a real thriller on another board, Briton Michael Adams defeated Russian Vladimir Kramnik to jump into sole lead with two points out of a possible three, while the other game of this category-20 double round-robin tournament between Hungarian Judit Polgar and local star Veselin Topalov also ended in a deadlock. 

As things stand now, Anand, Polgar, Kramnik and Topalov are right behind the leaders on 1.5 points, while Ponomariov is a not-so-distant last with one point in his bag. 

Interestingly enough, the rules that prevent draw offers in this tournament have failed so far to have any effect with two games out of nine ending decisively. 

The Petroff defence is steadily and surely getting into the repertoire of every top player of the world these days and it came as no surprise when Ponomariov employed it with his black pieces against Anand. 

Going for a topical variation, Anand apparently had some advantage after a pawn sacrifice in the resulting middle game but Ponomariov kept himself on guard to find the correct resources and steered the game to a draw with repetition of moves. 

Well it is modern classical chess, people play tough openings and than check it on the computers. I understood that I had some advantage with my central pawns but did not know how to maintain it that way for long. At first I thought I was better and the danger came when Ponomariov expanded on the king side. I think that the draw was a just result, Anand said after the game. 

Kramnik was the big loser of the day. 

The Russian is often ridiculed for his dry style of chess but herein he is the only one involved in both decisive games so far ? a victory that came easy against Ponomariov in round one and a loss Saturday that was disastrous! 

Kramnik, as if taking a cue from Anand in the previous round, also ventured along the Petroff defence but was in for a rude shock in one of the most popular variations these days. 

Adams, to his credit, parted with his queen for three pieces and soon after started pocketing those extra pawns of Kramnik that promised some counter play. 

Kramnik was far from his best in working out the counteractive measures and went down tamely amidst complexities in only 41 moves. 

I was lucky to win it like this, was how Adams summed up his days play. 

Polgar, like Anand, drew her third game in a row too as her opponent Topalov came up with early surprise in form of the Berlin defence with black pieces. Polgar did quite well to get a lasting advantage out of a queen-less middle game typical of the opening and later almost forced an exchange sacrifice that offered her some winning chances. 

Topalov, however, had worked on his plans quite well and even as the pieces kept disappearing, his extra pawns in compensation for the lost material ensured him sufficient counter play. The draw was agreed to after 60 moves.

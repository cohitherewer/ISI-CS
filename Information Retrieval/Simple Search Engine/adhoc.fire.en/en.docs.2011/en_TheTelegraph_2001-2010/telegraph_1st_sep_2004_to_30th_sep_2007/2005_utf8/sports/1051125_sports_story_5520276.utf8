 Taibu severs ties with ZC

Durban: Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu cut all ties with cricket in his home country on Thursday. 

Ive resigned from Zimbabwe cricket as a whole, Taibu said from Harare on Thursday. 

Ive had problems with the way Zimbabwe cricket is being run for the past few years, said the 22-year-old, the youngest captain in Test cricket history when he took over in May 2004. 

Thats probably 80 per cent of the reason for my decision, the other 20 per cent is the way the contracts have been dealt with. 

Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) offered contracts in August that were heavily based on incentives and incorporated much smaller basic salaries than the players had been paid in the past. 

Taibu, who played 24 Tests for Zimbabwe and captained them in 10, said he hoped to continue his playing career in England. 

Taibu aims to play English club cricket next year ? Zimbabwes recently fired coach, phil simmons, is oganizing the move ? and will practice privately with family and friends in the meantime. 

Taibu, with the support of most of his national team and Zimbabwes provincial chairman, has called for zimbabwe cricket chairman Peter Chingoka and managing director stand down. 

The Zimbabwe reserve bank has since investigated the financial activities of Chingoka and Bvute. 

Arrangements are being made by Phil Simmons and we are sorting out the details, Taibu said. (REUTERS)

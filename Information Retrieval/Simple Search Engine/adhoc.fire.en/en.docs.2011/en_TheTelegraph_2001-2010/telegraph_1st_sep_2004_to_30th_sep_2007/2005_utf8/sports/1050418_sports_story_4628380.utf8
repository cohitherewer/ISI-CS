New Delhi: A resurgent Pakistan crushed India by 159 runs in the sixth and final one-dayer on Sunday to clinch the series 4-2 in a match marred by crowd trouble after a ceremonious start in the presence of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

Pakistan, who had conceded the Test and one-day series to India back home last year and managed to draw the three-match Test series here, made amends winning the one-day series for Pepsi Cup. 

Pakistan put on a superb all-round display, rattling up 303 for eight after captain Inzamam-ul Haq elected to bat and then dismissing the hosts for 144 on a slow Kotla pitch. 

Shoaib Malik top-scored with 72, his third fifty of the series, and Inzamam made a run-a-ball 68 as Pakistan, who were leading 3-2 in the series, set India a challenging total. 

Inzamam shared in a 91-run fifth wicket partnership with his deputy Younis Khan (40) off just 78 balls after Malik and Yousuf Youhana put in a 85-run third wicket stand. The partnership finally came to an end courtesy a controversial run out handed by third umpire Hariharan which brought an end to Youhana?s 59-ball 50. 

India, who needed to show strong character in squaring up the series, faltered at the beginning of their chase after both openers Virender Sehwag (21) and Sachin Tendulkar (9) fell inside the first 10 overs and stand-in captain Rahul Dravid (19) was run out, reducing the innings to 64 for three. 

It was Pakistan?s eighth victory in the last 10 games against India. It was a new low for the hosts as they suffered their biggest defeat in terms of runs and the biggest in any one-dayer against Pakistan. The visitors? 143-run victory in Jaipur in 1989-90 was their previous best victory margin against India. 

Play was held up for about 16 minutes immediately after the dismissal of Mohammad Kaif (with India sliding to 94 for six) as a section of the crowd hurled plastic bottles onto the ground, forcing the players to return to the dressing room. 

Security men and Delhi and District Cricket Association officials got into the act as they went about trying to restore order in the galleries. Play eventually resumed after security was tightened in the troubled areas. 

Malik was adjudged Man of the Match while Naved-ul Hasan picked up the Man of the Series award. (Agencies)

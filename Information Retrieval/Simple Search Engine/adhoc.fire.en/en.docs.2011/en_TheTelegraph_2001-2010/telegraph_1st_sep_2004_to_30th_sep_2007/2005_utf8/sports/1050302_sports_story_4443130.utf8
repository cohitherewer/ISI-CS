Wellington: Australia crushed New Zealand by seven wickets with nearly 16 overs to spare in their fourth one-day International in Wellington on Tuesday. 

The world champions hardly broke into a sweat as they cruised to victory in the 35th over after dismissing the Black Caps for 233, to snatch a 4-0 lead in their five-match series. 

Damien Martyn top-scored for Australia with an unbeaten 65 while stand-in captain Adam Gilchrist (54), Andrew Symonds (48) and Simon Katich (43) also got among the runs as the tourists cantered to their target for the loss of just three wickets. 

?It was a great team effort,? said Gilchrist, who was promoted to lead after Ricky Ponting was ruled out with a leg injury. 

?Even though we had already won the series, we were determined to come out and play aggressively.? 

New Zealand, currently second in the world rankings behind Australia, had threatened to post a big total when captain Stephen Fleming and Nathan Astle laid the platform for a good innings by piling on 84 for the first wicket in 17 overs. 

However, when both men departed for 37 runs each, the home side?s batting fell apart. 

Craig McMillan added 35 off 36 balls and Chris Cairns hit 36 off 35 deliveries, including two boundaries and a pair of sixes, but no one was able to help the hosts regain the initiative. 

Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie took two wickets each for Australia while Michael Kasprowicz, Michael Clarke and debutant James Hopes collected one apiece. 

?We just didn?t put enough pressure on them... and once again they demolished us,? Fleming said. ?We?re getting a drubbing and we?ve got to learn from this.? 

Katich, opening the innings in the absence of Matthew Hayden, got the Australian innings off to a fast start with a brisk 43 off 41 balls before Gilchrist swung into action, striking eight fours and a six to reach his first half-century of the series. 

Both were caught after chancing their arms but their departures did not stem the flow of runs. 

Symonds belted three sixes in his 48 off just 37 deliveries while Martyn plundered eight boundaries in his unbeaten 65. 

The final match in the series will be played at Napier on Saturday. 

 Lehmann out of reckoning 

A shoulder injury has forced Darren Lehmann out of the reckoning for a place in the Australian Test team to tour New Zealand, adds another report from Sydney. 

Lehmann lost his spot in the one-day side after a barren run with the bat this summer, but was hoping to remain in the Test squad, which will be announced later this week. 

However, he announced on Tuesday he was unavailable for the three-Test tour because he needed a shoulder operation. 

?The shoulder would not stand up to the rigors of three international Test matches,? Lehmann said in a statement. 

?I want to get the shoulder right so that I am fit and ready for selection for the Ashes later in the year,? he said. 

Australia?s chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said: ?Whilst it is disappointing for Darren that he is unavailable for selection to tour New Zealand, it is important that he has this surgery to enable him to continue his cricketing career in the future.? 

New Zealand opening batsman Nathan Astle joined his team?s mounting injury toll when he damaged his shoulder attempting a catch in Tuesday?s match in Wellington. 

Astle was ruled out of Saturday?s final one-dayer in Napier but is still expected to play in the first Test starting March 10.

 Rach quits, Egypt bound

New Delhi: Under attack over a string of failures, India?s chief hockey coach Gerhard Rach has quit his job. 

The German-born Rach, whose future was hanging in the balance following a string of poor performances by the team, has taken up a new assignment with the national team of Egypt, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) said on Wednesday. 

IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran said Rach had telephoned IHF president K.P.S. Gill last night to inform him about his decision. 

?Rach called up Gill last night to tell him about his decision. IHF wished him all the best ,? Jyothikumaran said. 

Rach became the first foreign coach of the hockey team when he was appointed to the top job just a few days before the Olympics. He will officially take over as the coach of Egypt on January 25. 

On the appointment of new coach, Jyothikumaran said ?we have enough time to think on this aspect. Mr. Gill and other office bearers of the IHF will take a decision on this at the appropriate time.? 

?At the moment we are now fully focussed on National Junior Development Programme which will be held simultaneously with the Premier Hockey League.? 

Asked whether the IHF would opt only for a foreign coach, the IHF secretary did not give a direct reply but said ?as our chief has informed already, the IHF will cross the bridge when we come to it?.

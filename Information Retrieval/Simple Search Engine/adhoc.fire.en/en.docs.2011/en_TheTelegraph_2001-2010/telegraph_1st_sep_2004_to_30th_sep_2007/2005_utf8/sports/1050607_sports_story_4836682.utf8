The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Easy work could backfire on England

 - Hosts got no preparation time 

DEREK PRINGLE IN CHESTER-LE-STREET

 Matthew Hoggard 

For the second Test in succession, England pulverised Bangladesh in less than seven sessions of playing time, winning the match by an innings and 27 runs at Chester-le-Street Sunday. 

Easy job well done, you might think, except that with seven of Michael Vaughans team here playing nothing but one-day cricket until the Ashes start on July 21, they may yet regret not making these matches last longer so more players could have a bat. 

Modern players are more used to shorter preparation times than their predecessors of 10 years ago, but six-and-half weeks without playing first-class cricket is a long stretch to be away from the rhythms and cadences of the longer game. 

As Bangladeshs batsmen revealed in this series, one-day mentality and one-day strokes do not sit well in Tests and Ricky Ponting wasted no time Sunday pointing out that he felt Australia had the better preparation ahead of the Ashes. 

Without going down the Lions route of having a separate side for less important matches (England could easily pick a separate XI to play Bangladesh), a solution is not easy. Even those not involved in the NatWest Series are hardly going to be swamped with County cricket. 

With Twenty20 in full flow for the last half of June, Graham Thorpe will have the possibility of six first-class innings, Ian Bell four, while bowlers like Matthew Hoggard and Gareth Batty will have two and three matches, respectively, in which to bowl with slips and short-legs. 

Hoggard, somewhat surprisingly named Man-of-the-Match here (his response was to admit on live radio that Ian Bell had been robbed), could play in the Roses match for Yorkshire this Wednesday, though only if an ankle niggle has cleared up. In his case though, especially with his no-ball problem (he bowled eight here to go with the 15 he sent down at Lords), a stint in Twenty20 may be more helpful in sorting out the problem. 

With two runs given plus a free hit for the batsmen, they become a luxury no team can afford. It was Hoggard, bustling in from the Northern End, who polished off the last two wickets Sunday to finish with five for 73, and a total of 14 wickets in the series. Such figures flatter in a way Bells 162 on Saturday did not. 

Neither was up against anything much, but Bell simply looked impressive, and in control. Englands most consistent bowler in the series, as he has been for the last18 months, has been Andrew Flintoff. Over the weekend, former Somerset captain Peter Roebuck voiced concerns over Flintoffs action in a column he writes for an Australian newspaper. 

Roebuck, who also pointed out the flaws in Brett Lees action, felt Flintoffs open-chested style betrays him whenever he searches for that extra yard of pace or goes around the wicket. With a wrist that twists and a wide angle of delivery, Flintoff is not unlike the West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh. 

Although there is definitely flexion at the elbow ? random filming of him during the ICC Trophy last year suggests it was between 8-11 degrees ? it is well within the 15-degree tolerance level allowed by the International Cricket Council. Certainly, he has never been reported by either an umpire or Match Referee ? usually the first sign that a bowler is attracting suspicion. 

Although not quite the emphatic welcome note with which Vaughan wanted to greet Australia on their arrival Sunday (the captain admitting that the team had striven for a two-day win), victory did bring England their fifth successive Test series win. 

Although they came close to achieving five in-a-row under Nasser Hussain, the feat has not been matched since 1969-71, when Raymond Illingworth captained England to successes over West Indies, New Zealand, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan. 

Some belated fight from Bangladesh in their second innings, which gave them their highest total against England, meant the home side had to work for their wickets, something that took many by surprise. The Daily Telegraph

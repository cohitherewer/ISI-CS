 Nadal overcomes fighting Ginepri 

Madrid: Rafael Nadal reached his fifth Masters Series final of the year when he overcame fierce resistance from American Robby Ginepri to win 7-5, 7-6 in a high-octane contest on Saturday. 

The 19-year old Spaniard, bidding to equal Roger Federers record of four Masters crowns this year, will face either fifth-seeded Argentine David Nalbandian or eighth seed Ivan Ljubicic in Sundays final. 

Earlier, Nadal brushed past the challenge of Radek Stepanek with a 7-6 (11-9), 6-4 win to set up the semi-final date with Ginepri. 

Im delighted, said the world number two after his victory over the 16th seeded American. Its incredible to be in another final and even more special to do it here in Madrid in front of my fans. 

Nadals victory was his 78th of the year, one more than world number one Roger Federer and the most by a teenager since Mats Wilander won 82 in 1983. 

The two powerfully built players spent the opening games sizing each other up. 

Nadal soon warmed to the task and forced errors from the US Open semi-finalist as the two players slugged it out. 

The young Mallorcan retrieved a seemingly impossible drop shot and responded with a magnificent winning pass in the opening point of the seventh game and went on to earn himself a break to lead 4-3. 

But Ginepri, who won in Indianapolis in July, broke straight back and blasted through another service game to go 5-4 up. 

Nadal rose to the challenge and broke again in the 11th after forcing two successive errors from his opponent. He then served out to clinch the set.

 Injury forces Holmes out 

London: Two-time Olympic gold medallist Kelly Holmes will miss next months world championships due to an Achilles injury. 

Holmes, who won the 800m and 1,500m in Athens last August, has been battling the recurring injury for most of the season. 

She has competed in only one race on the track, winning the 1,500m in Glasgow on June 5. 

Holmes said on Wednesday that she was pulling out of Fridays Crystal Palace meet in London and the August 6-14 worlds in Helsinki. 

For the past week i have been doing everything to get over my Achilles problem and although Ive been getting intense physio, I just cant race on it, she told the BBC. My physio and I have decided I need to stop pushing myself to recover. 

Meanwhile, Olympic and world triple jump champion Christian Olsson wont defend his title at the world championships, adds a report from Stockholm. Olsson said on he wont have enough time to recover from foot surgery earlier this year to be a his best. 

The Swede had ankle surgery in March and last month doctors removed a piece of bone from his right foot. Olsson said his foot had healed, but he didnt want to take any unnecessary risks.

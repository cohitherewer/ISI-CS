 Sharapova wants to be No. 1 for long

 - To claim top spot for a week doesnt mean anything

Carson: From Melbourne to Paris to Wimbledon, there was a recurring thought this year whenever Maria Sharapova walked into an interview room or strode onto a tennis court. 

Had Sharapova gotten taller or was everyone else just shrinking? 

The mystery was solved on Monday. Listed at 6 feet in the WTA Tour media guide, Sharapova said she was 6-2, having grown a few more centimetres, which may have contributed to her back problems in 2005. 

Does this height come from her rarely seen mother, Yelena, or some great-grandfather? Well, Yelena is 5-7, and Sharapova dismissed the other theory. She, too, is curious. 

No, I would know. Ive been asking, Sharapova said, laughing. 

The 18-year-old Sharapova is poised and shows an impressive ability to stay on message. But every so often, there is a glimpse of the teenager, as opposed to the global brand, when she giggles. 

Her biggest burst of laughter came when she talked about doing something else when she was 30, guaranteeing she would not be playing tennis, speaking about fashion, possibly working as an intern for a designer, and eventually starting a family. 

I dont want to be 35 and not have a family, you know, she said. 

That statement took seconds to sink in, hitting her as rather premature, as she looked at the handful of reporters sitting around her in the Stadium Club at the Home Depot Centre. 

Im 18 and talking about a family with you guys, she said. Theres more to life ? I just feel like I want to explore so many more things in life than tennis. I love fashion, and I cant go to fashion school. 

There are a few more things on her to-do list before it reaches that stage. The No. 1 ranking, for one, but most assuredly, there is not the word urgent written in red capital letters next to it. The JP Morgan Chase Open, which started Monday here, is Sharapovas first event since failing to defend her Wimbledon title in July. 

But since Sharapova is a few strokes away from overtaking No. 1-ranked Lindsay Davenport ? she needs to reach the semi-finals in Carson and pick up some bonus points to do so ? there were far more questions about the ranking than about her loss to Venus Williams at Wimbledon in the semi-finals. 

She would become the first Russian female to reach No. 1, and it would be the second time in three years that a change at the top occurred at this tournament. In August 2003, Kim Clijsters of Belgium supplanted Serena Williams at No. 1. 

Its very important, but if I wanted to be No. 1, I would have played San Diego with a tight back, said Sharapova, who added that she was fine now. Lindsay pulled out, and I would have had a good chance then. I want to make sure whenever I become No. 1, Im healthy and ready to stay at No. 1. 

For me to become No. 1 and keep it for one week doesnt mean anything. ... Im not working toward No. 1 and then falling down the steps. 

Sharapova came close to the top spot earlier this year but said she wasnt in a rush to get there. In 2005, she has reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open and Wimbledon and the quarter finals of the French Open, losing to the eventual winner at all three Grand Slams. 

She said that she was in severe pain during the Australian Open and that she thought the most recent mini-growth spurt might have been the culprit. It was nothing like her growth spurt two years ago, a surge of about three inches in a few months.

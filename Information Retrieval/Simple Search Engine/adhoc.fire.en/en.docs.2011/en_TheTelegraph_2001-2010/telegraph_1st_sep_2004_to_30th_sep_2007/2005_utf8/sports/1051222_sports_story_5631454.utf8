 AIFF to meet clubs over schedule

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) will meet the representatives of the ten clubs ?? that will compete in the premier National Football League (NFL) ?? on Thursday to finalise the schedule and venues for the competition that kicks off early next year. 

The agenda for the meeting includes a draw of lots for the schedule, finalising dates and venues for the 10th edition of the NFL. 

Earlier, the AIFF had rejected the requests of teams that were relegated last season for expanding the league. At its annual general meeting, the federation decided to stick to its decision of restricting the NFL to 10 sides. 

AIFF president Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi is expected to attend the meeting along with secretary, Alberto Colaco.

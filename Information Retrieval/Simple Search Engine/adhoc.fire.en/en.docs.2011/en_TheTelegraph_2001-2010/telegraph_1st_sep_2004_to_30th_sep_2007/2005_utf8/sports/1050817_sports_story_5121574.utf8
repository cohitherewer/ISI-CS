 Heat will be a problem: Narain

 - I relied on some computer games to get a feel of the track 

New Delhi: Fresh from a break, Narain Karthikeyan, along with other members of Team Jordan, is moving to Turkey for this weekends Turkish Grand Prix. 

Istanbul will host its first Formula One race at the end of the week with an impressive brand new circuit, designed by German architect Herman Tilke, who had also designed Sepang, Bahrain and Shanghai circuits. 

For the first time this season, all drivers will be racing on equal terms, learning the layout of the track in a short period. Karthikeyan and Portuguese teammate Tiago Monteiro will also need to be well prepared for a very hot race again at the racetrack, which runs anti-clockwise like the San Marino and Brazilian races. 

Narain said he was again keen to burn the rubber after spending some valuable time back home. 

I went to India after a gap of four months. I did a lot of work for my sponsors there, so I have been very busy for the first 10 days. I have also spent some time with my family, which was very nice. 

The fastest Indian also said he relied on some computer games to get a feel of the new track in Turkey. 

I have done some computer games of the new Turkish circuit, so I could at least learn what its like. I have also trained a lot, as again it will be a very hot race. 

The good thing is that from now on ? apart from Turkey which will be new for everybody ? I know the next four circuits and I hope to do well, he said in a Jordan press release on Tuesday. 

Monteiro vowed that he will do all he can to finish another race in his debut season. 

After Budapest, I went to Portugal to see my family for a few days but also to do a lot of promotions for my sponsors. I only had may be three days off in the whole two weeks, so even though we could not test the car, I have been very busy off the track. 

We know it is going to be a very difficult race as the weather conditions will be once again very hot, but I will do my best to finish it, he said. 

Teams sporting director Adrian Burgess was expecting a few surprises on the brand new track and hoped his team will be motivated to meet the challenge.

 Harbhajan let off with reprimand

 - Off-spinner asked to concentrate on game 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mohali: Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, the only player to publicly back Sourav Ganguly, was reprimanded by the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) on Thursday and advised against speaking his mind on controversial matters pertaining to the Indian team. 

Harbhajan had backed his captain, crediting him for the success of the team while accusing Greg Chappell of creating fear and insecurity among teammates. 

Harbhajan, who appeared before the administrative committee of the PCA to explain his conduct, was asked to concentrate on his game. The off-spinner was barred from speaking to the media. 

PCA president I. S. Bindra said Harbhajans conduct was not in accordance with the associations and BCCI code. 

As a family member we have advised him to only concentrate on his game and try to repeat his performance of 31 wickets in three Test matches, Bindra said. 

We have called our son and listened to what he had to say and given our advice. We now treat the matter as closed after advising him to exercise caution, Bindra added. 

He (Harbhajan) said that in hindsight he has realised he should have avoided airing his views the way he did in public, a note issued by the PCA said. 

PCA sources, however, said that Harbhajan continued to support his captain and even provided examples on the field to back his belief. 

It is an individuals personal likes and dislikes. There is nothing wrong in that. But he apologised profusely for going to the media and said he would not make the mistake in the future as it could affect the morale of the team. 

Bindra, also a former BCCI president said, It would have been better if this (Chappell-Sourav spat) was controlled on the first or second day. 

I am very happy that the review committee has sorted out the issue, he said.

 Use yorkers as a surprise weapon

 -Thinking positively all the time helps 

Cricket Online 

 Ravi Shastri 

 I have a strange problem. I always put my individual performance above the teams interest. As a result the team often suffers. How do I get rid of this habit? 

 (Tapas Roy, Calcutta-41)

 Cricket is a team game where the real enjoyment comes in winning. If you play for yourself, it will not give you any job satisfaction and make you hugely unpopular among your teammates. 

 A thousand skipping a day, 2 km of running and various other free hand exercises --- are they good enough to improve footwork and batting? 

 (Disha Sheth, 26, Calcutta-20) 

 Yes, skipping in particular. 

 How can one improve temperament and mental toughness? 

 (Bapi Bagdi, 21, Bardhaman) 

 Physical fitness leads to mental fitness. Thinking positively all the time does help. 

 I am a righthanded batsman and prefer opening. But my coach insists I come down the order. It leads to problems of adjustment. What do I do?

 (Rajib Roy, 19 Calcutta-84) 

 If you are asked to bat down in the interests of your team, you should do it.Think positively. It will take a little while to adjust.Treat it as a challenge. 

 I am a right-handed batsman. Often after surviving a chance I get a bit jittery and shaky. This leads to my dismissal within the space of a few balls. Please help. 

 (Ranjit Gupta, 22, Calcutta-16) 

 Put the chance behind you. Focus on the ball to be bowled. Think that you are destined to make a score and that luck is with you and you got to make the most of it. 

 I am a medium pacer. My yorkers are often picked up early by the batsmen and converted into full tosses. Please help. 

 (Andrew Rodrigues, 19, Calcutta-16) 

 It should be used sparingly and as a surprise weapon.Also work on your pace. 

 I am a righthanded batsman. While trying to cut, I end up getting caught in the slips. Please help.

 (Ram Gupta, 18, Calcutta-21) 

 You are obviously picking the wrong ball to cut. It may be a ball too close to the body where you cannot free your arms. 

 I am a righthanded batsman. Very often while driving I hit the ball from the top of the bat, resulting in the ball ballooning up. Please help.

 (Rajat Bhowmick, 19, Agartala) 

 Get close to the pitch of the ball with your head down. 

 I am a mediumpacer. How does one study a batsmans strength? 

 (Sayan Nag, 18, Siliguri)

 Watch his footwork and grip.It will give you an indication as to which shots he likes to play. 

 I am a mediumpacer. How does one bowl the off and leg cutters? 

 (Sujoy Sen, 17, SIliguri)

 By rolling your fingers accross the seam clock and anti clockwise.

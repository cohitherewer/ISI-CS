The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Nation?s longest rally will be high-tech

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Calcutta leg of the Airtel One India Challenge car rally will pick up participants at the Clown Town on the May Day. 

Announcing this at a press conference on Wednesday, the organisers said that this will be a pretty high-tech rally with Global Positioning System trackers installed on each car. This will be monitored by satellites giving the position of any car at any given time. 

Hence, the traditional procedure of time controls (even though this is a time-speed-distance rally) will be done away with. There will only be two passage controls. 

The qualification process ? some of the 23 venues have already completed it ? will see 50 participants to be selected each for four metros. The rallyists then move via the Nagpur-bound leg and from there on, they will vie for top honours by driving towards New Delhi, covering a distance of 1300 km. 

The rally ? the longest in the country in terms of the total distance covered ? is being held in association with the FMSCI and offers an overall prize money of Rs 1 crore. The top three winners will get Rs. 30 lakh, Rs 15 lakh and Rs 8 lakh, respectively. 

The participants for the Calcutta leg have to be 21-year plus and three-year driving licence and their vehicles need to be Euro II compliant and a minimum 980 cc car. They will have to drive a distance of 25 km within one hour, during which the drivers ? a three-member team ? will have to answer 50 questions as to the various landmarks on the way. 

The FMSCI will, however, not provide any service vehicle anywhere during the rally, but keeps the option open that one of the three participating members can be a mechanic. 

For a rally this long, though, this could pose a big problem, especially for the rookies in the race. The established pros are always able to garner enough funds to set up a service team, which they may even share. But for a long trek, the newcomers could be left high and dry. 

The organisers said there will be two ambulances available for the rally. Speeds afre to be kept to an average of around 50-55 kmph on a route mainly involving highways. 

This rally will become an annual feature.

 Nicky Boje wants Indian assurance 

Durban: South African vice-captain Nicky Boje, in an interview to a South African daily, has made it clear that he would tour India later this year only if he is assured that he will not be prosecuted on charges of match-fixing. 

The spinners reaction comes after reports that the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) had asked the South African high commission in New Delhi to obtain assurance from the Indian police that Boje and Herschelle Gibbs would not be arrested or questioned on the match-fixing scandal. 

UCBSA chief executive officer Gerald Majola said that if they do not receive the undertaking, the players themselves would have to decide whether they want to travel to India in November to participate in a five-match one-day International series.

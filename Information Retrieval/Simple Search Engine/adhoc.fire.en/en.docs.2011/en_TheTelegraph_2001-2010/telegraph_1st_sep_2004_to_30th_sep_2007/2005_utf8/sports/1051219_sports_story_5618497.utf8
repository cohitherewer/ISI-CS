 Aussies regain title

 The Aussie players with the Champions Trophy in Chennai on Sunday after beating The Netherlands 3-1 

Chennai: Olympic champions Australia ended their five-year long wait and regained the title outplaying the Netherlands 3-1 in the rain-marred final of the 27th Champions Trophy here on Sunday. 

In the summit clash, a repeat final of the 2004 Athens Olympics, Australia completely dominated the proceedings to win their eighth trophy, which also helped them equal Germanys record for most number of titles. 

The win also helped Australia, who topped the league with four wins and just a draw against Pakistan, to avenge their defeat in the final to the Netherlands in 2003. 

Australia, who last won the title in 1999, skipped last edition in Lahore on security grounds. 

Matthew Wells hoisted Australia into the lead in the 21st minute and Liam de Young increased the margin in the 36th minute, just before a heavy downpour forced a 20-minute interruption. 

Jamie Dwyer, whose golden goal had helped Australia beat the Dutch 2-1 in the Olympics, sealed the fate of the Netherlands with a superb goal in the 62nd minute. Veteran Taeke Taekema scored the consolation goal for the losers. 

Dwyer was adjudged the man-of-the-match while Bevan George was declared the man-of-the tournament. Spain got the Fair Play award. 

In another match, Spain exhibited an allround hockey to outplay a youthful Germany 5-2 to salvage some pride by claiming the bronze medal. 

Spain, the title winners in Lahore last year, rode on a superb display of attacking game and a brace each by star striker Santi Frexia and veteran Pablo Amat to deny Germany the medal. 

For Spain, Frexia (13th, 69th), Alex Fabregas (22nd) and Amat (41st and 57th) sounded the board while Moritz Furste (28th) and Matthias Witthaus (59th) scored for Germany. 

In fact, this is the first time Germany has failed in their seven appearances in the bronze medal play-off. (PTI)

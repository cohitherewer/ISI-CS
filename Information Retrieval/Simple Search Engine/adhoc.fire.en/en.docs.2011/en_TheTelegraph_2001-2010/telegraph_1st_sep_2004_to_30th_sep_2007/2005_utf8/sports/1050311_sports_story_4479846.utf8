 SA look for an encore

Centurion: South Africa would replicate the intensity and ruthlessness that were displayed in their comprehensive first Test victory over Zimbabwe when the second Test begins on Friday, captain Graeme Smith said on Thursday. 

?We?ll certainly be concentrating on getting the same intensity and the same will to win and ruthlessness,? Smith said of the first Test that lasted just two days. ?It will be difficult to re-enact a two-day win, but it will be superb if we can.? 

South Africa go into the second Test without opening bowlers Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini. Andre Nel, Charl Langeveldt and Monde Zondeki will spearhead the attack. 

?We?ll be looking for them to excel in their three different fields. Andre Nel is back and he looked really good in the nets. He?s big and strong and gets pace and bounce. 

?Charl Langeveldt is coming back from injury and it?s important he gets long spells out in the middle. He might not have the same pace as the other two, but he swings the ball. 

?Monde Zondeki has also had an up and down time this season with injury, but he?s always had the talent and the pace. His pace is his strength and it?s important for him to hit good areas and create chances.? 

?We want to provide stability in the batting order so we don?t want to chop and change. There?s no benefit to it. Herschelle Gibbs or Ashwell Prince would love an opportunity, but sometimes Test cricket is about getting used to waiting a bit.?

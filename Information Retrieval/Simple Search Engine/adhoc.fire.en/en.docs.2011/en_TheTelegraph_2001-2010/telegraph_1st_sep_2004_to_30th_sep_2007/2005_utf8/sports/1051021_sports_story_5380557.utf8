 Wright warned Shoaib, says report

 Shoaib 

Islamabad: Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtars level of commitment proved too much for World XI coach John Wright, who had to issue a written warning to the pacer during the ICC Super Test, a Pakistani newspaper said on Thursday. 

Shoaib did not show up at the ground on the first day of the Test and stayed put at his hotel. Wright then warned him through a letter that if he failed to show up at the ground on the second day as well, he would be sent back home on the first available flight, a well-informed source was quoted as saying by a Pakistan daily. 

Shoaib, who was dropped from the playing XI, remained absent during practice on the first day but showed up the next day and also took drinks out onto the field. 

The Rawalpindi Express also had issues with the New Zealander during the three-match one-day International series against Australia. 

Apparently, during one of the limited-overs games, Shoaib violated curfew hours and next day Wright told him that he was not pleased with his level of commitment, the source said. 

The newspaper also said that World XI ODI captain Shaun Pollock and Test skipper Graeme Smith were also unimpressed with the Pakistan star. (PTI)

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan played magnanimous hosts at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday, gifting relegation-threatened Vasco their first win in the National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup. 

The Goan outfit came to Calcutta with absolutely no expectations, having managed two points from eight games. No wonder coach Derick Perreira?s boys were pleasantly surprised after collecting three more, thanks to a 25th-minute strike by the seasoned Alex Ambrose. 

For three-time champions Mohun Bagan, it was yet another firm step down a slippery ladder. Their fourth loss (third at home) in nine games and a tally of 11 points wiped out the green-and-maroons? faintest title hopes and left diehards wondering whether the team will slip into Vasco?s shoes in the weeks to come. 

A clutch of advisors, pep-talk from former players? Nothing seems to be working for Subrata Bhattacharya?s beleaguered side. 

Not for the first time this season, Mohun Bagan enjoyed the lion?s share of exchanges and much of the better chances in the 90-minute duel only to finish on the wrong end of the scoreline. 

Basudeb Mondal, Jerry Zirsanga and Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? ensured a steady flow of passes in the first half, opening up the well-manned Vasco defence quite regularly. But with Man-of-the-Match Virender Singh having an outstanding afternoon under the bar, the hosts couldn?t guide the ball to the desired destination. 

Negotiating aerial balls was clearly Virender?s strength. Yet, the Mohun Bagan medios and side-backs kept floating crosses into the striking zone, hoping someone would get a free header in. That didn?t materialise, as Agnelo Colaco and Vinu Jose easily outjumped the likes of Ashim Biswas and his replacement Sunil Chhetri. 

Beto, who showed some fine touches, did manage a smart glancing header off a Dulal Biswas cross but Virender was not to be fooled. The tall Coelho, easily Mohun Bagan?s best header, saw his 76th-minute effort rebound off the sidepost. 

The three best chances came Jerry, Rennedy and Ashim?s way ? all in the opening session. A delectable Beto back-heel was picked up by Jerry whose powerful right-footer bulged the outer netting. Rennedy, put through by Jerry, stabbed the ball straight to Virender from eight yards out. Then Ashim, fed by Beto, pushed the ball a foot off target with Virender off position. 

Not surprisingly, Vasco were defence-minded, especially after having got a goal. They often had 10 men in their zone and relied on the counters. It was one such move that spelt doom for Mohun Bagan. 

Sushant Mathew lobbed one from the middle of the park, finding Dennis Cabral on the right. Left-back Manas Das was not in position and the rest of the defence stood frozen, hoping to see the off-side flag pop up. The Vasco midfielder took his chance, making a move and stroking the ball forward for the opportunistic Ambrose to push it past Prasanta Dora. 

As the minutes ticked by, Mohun Bagan got desperate and more error-prone. Most players looked unfit for a 90-minute game, in stark contrast to their traditional Maidan rivals.

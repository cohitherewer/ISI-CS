 Molik falters in comeback

Bali: Alicia Moliks comeback from illness faltered on Thursday when Ukrainian Alyona Bondarenko beat her in the second round of the Bali International meet. 

The third-seeded Australian, who missed several months after suffering a virus that upset her balance, was beaten 4-6, 2-6. 

Fifth seed Anna-Lena Groenefeld from Germany also lost, going down 3-6, 6-1, 1-6 to Japans Aiko Nakamura who now faces second seed Patty Schnyder. 

Molik, who has played only five matches since April while claiming just one victory, clearly lacked match fitness against a consistent if unspectacular opponent. Schnyder overcame Spains Virginia Ruano-Pascual 6-2, 6-3 but it was an untidy match with little rhythm. (REUTERS)

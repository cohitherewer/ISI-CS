 IFA set to introduce under-16 league

 - Need to pluck talent from interior regions: Manna 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA) is planning to introduce an under-16 league from next season. 

Announcing this during the associations annual prize distribution ceremony, held at Mahajati Sadan on Saturday, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta urged all local clubs to form the under-16 teams to make the new league a success. 

The IFA is the only state association to have a nursery league (under-13) in place. The new league will, thus, help these young players to carry on in competitive football once they attain the age of 14, Dutta said. 

Speaking on the occasion, Padmashree Sailen Manna stressed on the need to pluck talent from interior regions. 

According to the veteran international, the IFA should send scouts in rural Bengal in search of promising youngsters. 

Once such talents are identified, the IFA should pick and nurture them properly. In this way the game in the state will be benefited, felt the 79-year-old Manna. 

East Bengal club secretary Kalyan Majumdar arrived only rather late for the prize distribution. East Bengal got their Super Division winners trophy and a cheque of Rs 2 lakh. Mohun Bagan, who emerged the runners-up, took home Rs 1 lakh.

Osasuna returned to the top of the Primera Liga with a 2-0 home win over Espanyol on Sunday, while the inspirational Ronaldinho helped push champions Barcelona up to second after a 5-0 rout of Real Sociedad. 

Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho scored twice after setting up Dutch midfielder Mark van Bommel for the opening goal. 

Carles Puyol and Swedish striker Henrik Larsson were also on target at the Nou Camp. Sociedad had striker Gari Uranga sent off after 69 minutes. 

Osasuna lead with 21 points, two clear of Barcelona and three ahead of Real Madrid who beat Real Betis 2-0 on Saturday. 

Fourth-placed Getafe lost 1-0 at Deportivo Coruna, Diego Tristan netting after 25 minutes. They are level with Celta Vigo on 17 points but have a superior goal difference. 

Ronaldinho picked out Van Bommels late run to the edge of the area after 18 minutes and the Dutchman rifled a volley into the corner of the net. The Brazilian doubled the lead in the 36th minute, playing a one-two with Van Bommel before firing a vicious low shot inside the post. 

Ronaldinho put the game beyond Sociedad with a free kick from the edge of the area on 60 minutes. 

Uranga earned his second yellow card before Puyol headed in the fourth goal following a corner. 

Second-half substitute Larsson made it 5-0 near the end after Silvinhos cross was allowed to bounce in the area, leaving him free to score at the far post. 

In Serie A, third-placed Fiorentina moved within five points of leaders Juventus after Danish winger Martin Jorgensen struck an 82nd minute winner in the 2-1 victory over Cagliari on Sunday. 

Juventus, who lost 1-3 to AC Milan on Saturday, lead on 27 points with Milan two points behind them and Fiorentina third on 22 points. 

French defender Philippe Mexes headed an injury time winner for 10-man Roma who beat Ascoli 2-1 despite having Romanian defender Cristian Chivu sent off. 

Lazio fell to a 0-1 defeat at lowly Reggina ? an own goal from Luciano Zauri deciding the game ? while Livorno move up to fifth place thanks to a 2-0 victory over Parma. 

Fiorentina had to fight back from a goal down to get the three points against Cagliari and once again it was Italy striker Luca Toni who was the key figure for Cesare Prandellis team. 

Honduran striker David Suazo put Cagliari ahead in the 23rd minute after taking advantage of sloppy defending from Fiorentinas Marco Di Loreto. 

Toni brought Fiorentina level eight minutes into the second half, finishing off a superb defence-splitting pass from Stefano Fiore. 

The striker then turned provider when he put over a low cross, while being harried by two defenders, which Jorgensen confidently converted. 

Cagliaris disappointment was enhanced by two late dismissals ? Daniele Conti and Michele Canini both being handed red cards in the final stages of the game. 

Toni, currently Italy coach Marcello Lippis first choice striker, remains the top scorer in Serie A with 12 goals from 10 matches. (REUTERS)

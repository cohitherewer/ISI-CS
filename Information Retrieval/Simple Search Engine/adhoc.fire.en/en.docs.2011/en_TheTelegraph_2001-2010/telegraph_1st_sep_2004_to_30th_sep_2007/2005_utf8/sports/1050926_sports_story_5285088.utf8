 Bjorkman pulls up ATP leadership

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

New Delhi: Jonas Bjorkman feels the legal muddle the ATP has landed itself in, vis-?-vis the doubles issue, is due to some bad leadership. 

The senior pro in the Swedish Davis Cup team does not agree with the ATP view that doubles has no future unless some rule changes are introduced. I wouldnt like to play five games in a set, thats a bit too much, Bjorkman said during an interaction with The Telegraph on a rainy Saturday afternoon. 

The point Bjorkman made was a valid one: Any decision concerning rule changes should be taken after consulting the players. In this case, the ATP Players Council voted 9-0 against the proposed changes at the meeting during Wimbledon. How can the ATP overrule such a mandate and announce the changes? 

A clutch of top doubles players, including Mahesh Bhupathi, has filed a suit in an US court with the intention of stopping the ATP from bringing in the proposed rule changes in doubles. I am very much part of it, but wasnt around when the legal papers were being signed, informed Bjorkman. 

We are doing this to put pressure on the ATP? there needs to be a change in leadership. The vested interests of different tournament directors is also a factor? Most of them see the doubles event as an additional cost, they dont want to find ways to turn it into a profitable venture, he said. 

I would definitely like to see all players take part in both singles and doubles regularly, as the ATP wants. The doubles specialists, at least, can play more singles. Too many guys are satisfied with what they are earning from doubles.

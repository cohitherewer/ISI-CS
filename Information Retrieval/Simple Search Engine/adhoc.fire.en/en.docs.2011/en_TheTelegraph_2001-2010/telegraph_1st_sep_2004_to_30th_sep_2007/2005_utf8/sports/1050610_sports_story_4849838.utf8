 Greece now need a miracle

Paris: Greece coach Otto Rehhagel worked a miracle in guiding his unheralded side to the Euro 2004 title, but after a 0-1 home defeat to Ukraine on Wednesday, he will need to pull off an even greater achievement if they are to make even the play-offs for the 2006 World Cup finals. 

A late goal by Andreiy Uhsin gave Ukraine victory and move to within two points of qualifying automatically as group II winners. Greece slipped to third, a point behind bitter rivals Turkey, who slammed pointless Kazakhstan 6-0 away. 

However, the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists are still seven points behind Ukraine with both having just three matches to play and it is conceivable that the Ukrainians could wrap it up on September 3 when they travel to second-from-bottom Georgia. 

Denmark will fancy their chances of claiming second spot after a 3-1 home success over Albania lifted them to within four points of Turkey with a game in hand and they have still a match apiece against the Turks (away) and at home to Greece. 

Spain almost suffered the same fate as Greece as they trailed 0-1 at home to Bosnia and Herzegovina in their group VII clash until the fifth minute of injury-time saw Carlos Marchena save their blushes with an equaliser. 

However, Spain have only a one-point lead over Serbia and Montenegro with their rivals having a game in hand. 

Group I remains too close to call as leaders Holland recorded a 4-0 win away against Finland. Three late goals, including one by veteran Philippe Cocu, ensured the big win after Ruud van Nistelrooy had given them the lead in the 37th minute. 

However, the Dutch will not be able to rest easy as their perennial rivals the Czech Republic racked up another massive win with a 6-1 thrashing of Macedonia, and that after they had gone behind to the visitors. 

Four goals from giant striker Jan Koller formed the backbone to their victory while Liverpool striker Milan Baros got one ? in front of French champions Lyon coach Gerard Houllier who wants him to sign for them ? as the Euro 2004 semi-finalists took their tally to 14 in two matches having seen off Andorra 8-1 last Saturday. 

Barring slip-ups by either side, the crucial match will be on October 8 when the Czechs host the Dutch in what should prove to be one of the matches of the qualifying process. 

Romania just about kept in touch of the leading two by winning 3-0 at home to Armenia but are still five points adrift of the Czechs and have played a game more than both the other sides. 

British Isles sides had differing nights with the Republic of Ireland gaining a hard-fought 2-0 victory over the Faroe Islands which nevertheless sent them top of group IV, a point ahead of Switzerland, who have a game in hand. 

However, Scotlands hopes of at least securing second place suffered a blow with a 0-0 draw in Belarus. 

Greece could have scored at least four goals but neither Yannis Goumas nor Stelios Giannakopoulos could push the ball into the net from close range. 

It was so unlucky, defender Goumas said. I hesitated for a split second thinking I was off side and then only managed to shoot at the keeper. 

Greece did put the ball into the net twice but Giannakopoulos and Angelos Haristeas were ruled off side. 

We had many chances, especially in the first half but we just could not score a goal, captain Theodoros Zagorakis said. This defeat was not the best thing that could happen to us but it would be disastrous to give up now. 

Zagorakis said the deciding match would be against Denmark in October. 

This is the crucial game against a team which I consider better than both Ukraine and Turkey. 

Coach Otto Rehhagel said his teams defence was good but the European champions were struggling for goals. 

Again we faced the same problem of not being able to score easily. That is our main weakness, he said.

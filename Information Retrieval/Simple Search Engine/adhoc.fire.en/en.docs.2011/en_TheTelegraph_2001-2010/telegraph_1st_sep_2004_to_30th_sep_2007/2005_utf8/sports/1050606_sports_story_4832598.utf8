The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Glamorgan tie washed out

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Glamorgans National League limited-overs match against Nottinghamshire was abandoned on Sunday without a ball being bowled. According to information received here, showers in the morning which continued through the afternoon, prevented any play in Swansea. 

This would have been regular Team India captain Sourav Gangulys second match for Glamorgan. His debut, in the County Championship game against Sussex, wasnt a memorable one. Sourav scored a duck and 15 not out as Glamorgan drew with Sussex. 

Glamorgans next engagement is a County Championship game versus Kent, beginning at Sophia Gardens on Wednesday.

 India clinch series 4-1

New Delhi: Indian colts defeated Australia under-19 side by 31 runs in the fifth and final one-day match to clinch the series 4-1 at the Kotla on Wednesday. 

Electing to bat, the Indians were dismissed for a paltry 196 in 45.4 overs but came back strongly to wrap up the tourists for 165 in 38.1 overs underlining their domination in the series. 

Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla and left-arm tweaker Pragyan Ojha were the wreckers-in-chief taking three wickets each. 

They used their guile, variations and change of pace to good effect keeping the youngsters from Down Under at bay after they started on a brisk note. Losing wickets at regular intervals they were 66 for four after 10 overs. 

The Uttar Pradesh leggie was especially impressive as he displayed his full repertoire of skills - the leg-break, googly and flipper to keep the batsmen at tenterhooks. 

A 64-run partnership for the fifth wicket between tom cooper (45; 5x4, 1x6) and David Warner (73; 5x4, 3x6) appeared to put the Aussies firmly on the victory path but the former was caught at deep mid-wicket going for a big hit with the team total on 119. 

Earlier, the less-than-impressive Indian batting had its most of the top order getting starts but failing to convert them to big scores. 

Aniruddh Srikkanath, son of former India captain K. Srikkanth, got the home side to a quick start with his 29 (5x4, 1x6), but he, along with other major batsmen, failed to come to terms with the pitch and was sent to the pavilion when seemingly set. 

 BRIEF SCORES 

India 196 (Aniruddh Srikkanth 29; M. Henriques 3/42). Australia 165 (D. Warner 73, T. Cooper 45; Piyush Chawla 3/31, P. Ojha 3/25). India won by 31 runs.

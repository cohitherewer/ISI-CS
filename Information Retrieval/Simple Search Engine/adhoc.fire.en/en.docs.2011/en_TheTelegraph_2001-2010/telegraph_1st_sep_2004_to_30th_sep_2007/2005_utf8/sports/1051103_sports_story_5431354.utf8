London: Real Madrid and Olympique Lyon became the first teams to qualify for the last-16 of the Champions League on Tuesday while European champions Liverpool took a giant stride towards joining them. 

Seemingly omnipotent Chelsea, however, crashed to their first defeat of the season in regular time losing 0-1 at Real Betis in one of the nights two upsets, the other coming in The Netherlands where PSV Eindhoven beat AC Milan by the same score. 

Inter Milan, though, had a far better night than their neighbours, coming from behind to beat Porto 2-1. 

Real brushed aisde Rosenborg 2-0 in Trondheim. The victory came courtesy of a Mikael Dorsin own goal after 26 minutes and a second from Guti four minutes before the break. 

There were no more goals in the second half but those strikes were enough to give Real victory and nine points from four games, leaving them second behind Lyon in group F. 

The French champions were in fine form in Greece where they thumped Olympiakos Pireaus 4-1 with all their goals coming in 16 minutes on either side of half-time. 

Haruna Babangida put the Greeks ahead after only three minutes but Lyon stormed back with goals from Juninho Pernambucano four minutes before the break, followed by two from John Carew (44th and 57th) and one from Mahamadou Diarra (55). 

Liverpool also gave a performance worthy of their status as European champions with a 3-0 home win over Anderlecht at Anfield where the Belgians stretched their unwanted record of successive Champions League defeats to 11 matches. 

Liverpool, who tend to reserve their best form for Europe, moved to the brink of qualification for the knockout stage from group G with goals from Fernando Morientes (34th), Luis Garcia (61st) and Djibril Cisse (89th). 

Chelseas last defeat in regular playing time was 18 matches ago when they lost at Liverpool in the second leg of last seasons Champions League semi-final. 

They therefore started as firm favourites to beat Betis following their 4-0 victory over the Spaniards in London two weeks ago. But Betis gave a vastly improved performance, battling for every ball as well as riding their luck. 

Their perseverance paid off when substitute Dani scored after 28 minutes and, although Chelsea went close to an equaliser 20 minutes from time when Michael Essien saw a shot hit both posts, Betis held on for three vital points. 

The other surprise came at PSV where the home side beat Milan 1-0 for their second home win over the Italians this year. 

Jefferson Farfan scored the only goal after 12 minutes which lifted PSV up from third to top on seven points. 

Milan are second with five points, the same as Schalke 04 who beat nine-man Fenerbahce 2-0 in Germany. The Turks slipped from second to fourth. 

While Milan were losing, their arch-rivals and neighbours Inter came from behind to beat Porto 2-1 with two late goals from Julio Cruz to stay top of group H. Artmedia twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with Rangers in Bratislava.

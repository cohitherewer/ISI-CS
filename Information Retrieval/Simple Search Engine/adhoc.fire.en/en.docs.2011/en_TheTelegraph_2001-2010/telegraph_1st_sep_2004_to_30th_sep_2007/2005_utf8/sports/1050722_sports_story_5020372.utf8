 New York: Jennifer Capriati will miss the US Open with a shoulder injury, making her the only woman tennis player with a Grand Slam title in the past five years not on the tournament entry list released on Wednesday.

 Sisters Serena and Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, Lindsay Davenport, Justine Henin-Hardenne, Anastasia Myskina and reigning champion Svetlana Kuznetsova head the women?s field.

 Capriati hasn?t played since she was injured in November and had surgery on her right shoulder in January. The year?s final Grand Slam runs from August 29 through September 11.

 New Delhi: Delhi will be host to an international marathon which will be held on December 4, organisers told a press conference here on Thursday. Some of the world?s top marathoners likely to be roped in include Stephen Cheptot (Kenya), John Nada Saya (Tanzania) and Semeretu Alemayehu (Ethiopia).

 Although the event is yet to get AAFI sanction, organisers are hopeful of things working out in time.

 Races will be held in three categories ? the Great India Run (42.195km), the Great Delhi Run (21.098km) and the Great Tiranga Run (7 km) ? and proceeds from the event would go to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. The prize money for the winner will be $55,000, while the best Indian will receive $5,000.

 Ramesh wins

New Delhi: The participants of the National B chess, which opened here Wednesday, did not have to fight out only against their respective opponents but the oppressive heat as well in the absence of proper facilities at the venue, the Bapu Samaj Sewa Kendra. 

R. B. Ramesh won his first round game against Standrik Colaso. 

 IMs Lanka Ravi and Subrajit Saha draw with much lower ranked opponents. 

On top boards, IM Deepan Chakravarthy defeated Hemant Sharma with white pieces in 26 moves. 

On the other boards, Suvrajit Saha drew with Sanjeev Biswas while Santanu Borpatra Gohain held Lanka Ravi. WGM Nisha Mohota scored a full point against V. Venugopalan. (PTI)

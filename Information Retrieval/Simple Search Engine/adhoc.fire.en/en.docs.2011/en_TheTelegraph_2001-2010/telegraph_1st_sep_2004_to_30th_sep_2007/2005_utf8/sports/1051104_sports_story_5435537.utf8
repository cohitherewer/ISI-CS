Paris: Rafael Nadal had offered to make a day trip to the BNP Paribas Masters on Wednesday to apologise in person for not being fit enough to play. The tournament organisers declined the Spaniards suggestion, believing that it would draw further attention to the fact that their event has been downgraded by a level of absenteeism they would prefer to overlook. 

Rather than a dismal attempt at damage limitation, the French could have used Nadals upbeat personality to polish tenniss image. 

Turning Nadal away exacerbates the fact that the last 16 of the final Masters Series event this year involves only three Grand Slam champions and a supporting cast of extremely decent rather than exceptional players. 

Nadal meeting and greeting the public would, surely, have enhanced the day ? more important for the sport than rubbing against a few over-sensitive egos. 

Of the players left in contention for the ?300,000 first prize here, only Andy Roddick is assured of his place in the Masters Cup in Shanghai, starting on Sunday week. 

Of those who did not venture to the Palais Omnisports, Marat Safin, the 2004 champion, confirmed that he will not be fit for China and Lleyton Hewitt remains so mum about his prospects, it looks increasingly likely he will stay at home in Sydney with his pregnant wife. 

That leaves more to play for than the seven with a statistical chance will have appreciated when this week started.Thomas Johansson, the 2002 Australian Open champion, is at the bottom of the list and his third-round match on Thursday against Ivan Ljubicic, the in-form Croat, will have enormous consequences for both. 

Gaston Gaudio, of Argentina, attempting to reach his second consecutive Masters Cup, raised his hopes with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over Fabrice Santoro, the French veteran. 

The tournament may prefer we do not report that he was one of two French players who forfeited their spots on Wednesday but Santoro and Arnaud Clement were rather too quickly eliminated. The loss through injury of Gael Monfils and Richard Gasquet before a ball was struck has merely aggravated raw Parisian woes. 

But there is always Roddick to enliven proceedings, although he spent rather too much time enlivening and not enough playing in the confident manner expected of a No. 1 seed. 

That is easier said than done when Taylor Dent is in full, committed flow and it is nigh on impossible to get a fix on where his serve is going to land and how well he is going to volley. 

Dent won 82 percent of the points when his first serve went in and it was all that Roddick could do to stay with him. 

Indeed, at 4-4 in the third and deciding set, when he had two break points, Dent was gifted a backhand passing shot he would have made nine times out of ten, but he fluffed it. 

Roddick made him pay with a 6-4, 6-7, 7-5 victory, striking his two best forehand returns of the match in the twelfth game of the final set, the last point of which was a double fault. 

So Roddick, who won the indoor title in Lyons last week, faces Dominik Hrbaty, the No. 16 seed from Slovakia, for a place in the quarter finals and may yet have a decisive say in who follows him on the Shanghai trail. 

There are so many ifs, ands and buts in the qualification maze that there is plenty to play for in the last four days of this event. 

It is a real pity that Nadals offer to share a few hours in their company could not have been more warmly received.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Prabhjot, Deepak among probables

New Delhi: Continuing with its game of hide and seek with the media, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) cancelled its plans on Thursday to introduce the newly appointed chief coach Rajinder Singh (Jr) though it released a list of 35 probables for the Azlan Shah Cup scheduled to be held in Malaysia next month. 

A press conference to introduce the chief coach and his deputy Narinder Pal Singh was scheduled in the afternoon but was cancelled at the last minute with IHF claiming in a release that it was postponed due to ?unavoidable reasons.? 

?The fresh dates would be intimated to all very shortly,? IHF said in the release. 

The federation was yet to officially announce the names of the coaches for the seven-nation event, to be held in Kuala Lumpur from May 26 to June 5, though the newly-appointed persons have already taken up their duties by turning up at the camp at the National Stadium. 

The camp was to begin Wednesday, but could not start with almost all the players failing to report in time. Only 15 of the 35 players attended it this morning. 

Chief coach Rajinder Singh (Jr), keen to prove his mettle at the highest level, was in the stadium in the afternoon session waiting for the 20 probables who have so far reached the city for the camp. 

After days of waiting, IHF, meanwhile, released a list of 35 probables for the Malaysia meet with Prabhjot Singh and Deepak Thakur getting back into reckoning since being left in the cold after the Athens Olympics. 

Gagan Ajit Singh, another player dropped after the Olympics, was not considered as he was serving a three-month ban for being involved in a brawl with an opposition player during the Senior Nationals in Hyderabad recently. 

Adrian D?souza, who had an impressive Olympics, and penalty corner expert Sandeep Singh did not figure in the list since the two are part of the ongoing camp in Hyderabad for the junior World Cup.

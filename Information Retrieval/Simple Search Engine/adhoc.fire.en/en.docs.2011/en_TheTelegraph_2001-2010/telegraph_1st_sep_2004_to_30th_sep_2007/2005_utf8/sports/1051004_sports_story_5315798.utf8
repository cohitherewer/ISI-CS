 New Delhi: The prestigious $300,000 Indian Open golf championship has bagged a three-year sponsorship deal with two-wheeler major Hero Honda, capping the uncertainty that had been lingering over the event for quite some time.

 The deal, signed between Hero Honda and tournament promoter World Sport Group, ensures that the flagship event is ensconced safely in the calendar till 2007.

 The championship was in danger of being scrapped altogether after running into problems with promoters IMG with which it had a contract.

 London: Arsenal?s Sol Campbell and Manchester United?s Alan Smith were named in the England squad on Sunday for the decisive World Cup qualifiers against Austria and Poland.

 England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson recalled centre back Campbell as expected following his recovery from a long-term injury.

 Smith has impressed in a midfield role for United this season, although his usual position is as a striker.

 England face Austria at Old Trafford in Manchester on Saturday before playing Group Six leaders Poland at the same venue the following Wednesday.

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazilian referee Edilson Pereira de Carvalho admitted in a television interview on Sunday that he accepted money to influence the results of matches and said he had been corrupted.

 Carvalho, who spent five days in police custody last week on allegations that he accepted money from an illegal gambling ring to fix results, said he had been seduced by the idea of earning easy money.

 The interview came on the same day as a Brazilian sporting tribunal decided to annul the results of all 11 matches in which he officiated in this year?s domestic championship.

 The decision knocked Internacional, whose 3-2 win over Coritiba was refereed by Carvalho, off the top of the table, where they were replaced by Corinthians.

 Moscow: Australian Open champion Marat Safin has pulled out of next week?s Kremlin Cup, tournament organisers said on Monday.

 Safin has not fully recovered from a ligament tear in his left knee that has troubled him since Wimbledon and forced him to withdraw from the US Open.

 The world No. 5 said on his official website that he would not resume playing until the St Petersburg Open, which starts later this month, followed by the Paribas Masters in Bercy and then the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai.

 Maria Sharapova is also doubtful for the annual Moscow tournament after the world No. 1 injured her chest muscle at last month?s China Open. 

 Paris: Frenchman Sebastien Loeb, who retained his world rally championship crown in Japan on Sunday, says his second title proved the first was no fluke.

 Loeb joined Finnish drivers Juha Kankkunen (1986-1987) and Tommi Makinen (1996-1999) and Italian Massimo Biasion (1988-1989) in winning consecutive titles.

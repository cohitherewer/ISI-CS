The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sultans open with 1-0 win

Hyderabad: Striker Sameer Dad scored the lone goal as Hyderabad Sultans edged past Sher-E-Jalandhar 1-0 in the opening Premier Hockey League match here Thursday. 

With both the teams locked goalless in the first two quarters, the Hyderabad Sultans stepped up the tempo in the third, constantly raiding the opponent?s citadel from both wings. 

The move paid off as Dad latched on to the rebound from Sher-e-Jalandhar custodian and made no mistake in slating home the winner. 

Playing without the services of world record goalscorer and penalty corner specialist Sohail Abbas, the home team played cautiously and concentrated on counter attacks. 

Led by the reliable Dilip Tirkey, the Sultans kept Gagan Ajit Singh and Daljit Singh under tight leash. 

The Sher-e-Jalandhar players took some time to settle down in the first quarter, but once they came into their groove, they launched some scathing attacks. 

The best chance of the quarter came when Gagan Ajit ran through the defence and unleashed a cracking shot only for Wasim Ahmed to make a diving stop. 

Both teams failed to convert any of the penalty corners that came their way. 

Second quarter passed off without much ado as both sides failed to create any openings.. 

With Sultans taking the lead, Sher-e-Jalandhar went for the kill in the final quarter, but Tirkey and his men held fort.

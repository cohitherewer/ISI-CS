 Federer loses cool, wins match

Bangkok: Roger Federers customary cool slipped for a second as the Swiss world No. 1 hurled his racket during a hard-fought first-round victory over Brazilian Marcos Daniel 7-6, 6-4. 

I was told he likes to get the rhythm and hes pretty slow from the baseline, and I get a guy serve and volleying at me, the world No. 1 said. 

Its not so easy to adjust, plus on top of that I feel a little rusty coming from clay, but in the end I played some good shots when I needed them. 

There was some frustration here and there. It shouldnt have happened, but it did. 

Lleyton Hewitt also struggled to overcome a dogged opponent before reaching the second round with a 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 win over Czech Lukas Dlouhy. 

The Australian appeared set for a runaway victory as he swept to a 4-1 lead in the opening set, but once Dlouhy settled he offered a real challenge.

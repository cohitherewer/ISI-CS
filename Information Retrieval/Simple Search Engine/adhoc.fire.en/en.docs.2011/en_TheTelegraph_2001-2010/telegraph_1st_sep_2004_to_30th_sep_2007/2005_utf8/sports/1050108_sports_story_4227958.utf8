 Lagos: Nigerian sports minister Musa Mohammed has reversed two appointments he made to his country?s football association (NFA) to avert a potential ban by Fifa. Soccer?s world governing body had threatened to ban Nigeria from all international football activities if the appointments were not withdrawn by Friday. ?I have decided to rescind my decisions on the appointment of the secretary-general of the NFA and that of the secretary of league implementation board as demanded by Fifa,? Mohammed said in a statement on Friday.

 Beijing: Liaoning goalkeeper Liu Jiansheng has been suspended for two years and fined 50,000 yuan ($6,000) after testing positive for recreational drugs, state press said Friday. Liu tested positive for common ingredients in methamphetamines and marijuana, the China Daily reported. 

 Gulfport: Three-time world boxing champion Hector ?Macho? Camacho has been arrested in connection with the burglary of a gulfport business last November. Gulfport police chief said Camacho, 42, was being held in Harrison County jail in lieu of $50,000 bail.

 London: Former world indoor 200m champion Michelle Collins has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against an eight-year doping ban. 

 The 33-year-old American was the first athlete suspended in the Balco scandal without a positive test or an admission of drug use. 

 A statement on the CAS website said that the tainted athlete had made an appeal to the independent Lausanne-based tribunal to over-rule last month?s decision by the American Arbitration Association (AAA).

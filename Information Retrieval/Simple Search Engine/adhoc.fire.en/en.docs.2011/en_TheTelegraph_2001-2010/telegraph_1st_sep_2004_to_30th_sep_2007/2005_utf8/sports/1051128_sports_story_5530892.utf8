 Warring groups meet observer Krishnamurthy

 - Kirti Azad adds twist to Jharkhand controversy 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: The dispute surrounding the representation of four of the 30 affiliates ? Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand/Bihar ? at the reconvened annual general meeting of the BCCI stole the limelight on Sunday. All the warring groups of the affiliates made their representation to observer T. S. Krishnamurthy. 

The case of Jharkhand/Bihar was of much interest to the rival factions. 

The special general body of the Board unanimously approved the change of name of the erstwhile Bihar Cricket Association to Jharkhand State Cricket Association in September 2004. 

The supporters of the old Bihar Cricket Association, established in 1935, and now led by Lalu Prasad, claim they have the right to vote. 

JSCA president Amitabh Choudhary and secretary B. N. Singh met Krishnamurthy during the day and argued their cases. 

A further twist was added when former India cricketer Kirti Azad, who is Cricket Control Association of Bihar (CCAB) president, met Krishnamurthy and demanded that his organisation be given associate membership by de-recognising the Lalu-led BCA. 

We have explained the facts and circumstances to Krishnamurthy, said Choudhary. We had applied for a change of name of the BCA and the Board collectively acted upon our request. I have been a working committee member for one full year. How can the BCA suddenly come into the frame now? he argued. 

We have total faith in Krishnamurthy. The way the elections are being held this time leaves no scope for complaints, Inderjit Singh Bindra said. 

Former Board treasurer Kishore Rungta was also in the city and met Krishnamurthy. He apprised the observer of the court cases and alleged criminal background of current RCA president Lalit Modi. 

Jagmohan Dalmiya also met Krishnamurthy with documents to prove that the NCC had submitted returns till 2004 and kept the members aware of the happenings. 

However, two other members submitted affidavits claiming no AGM had been held since 1998.

 Bindra makes stand clear

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mohali: Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) president would not commit to saying whether or not the PCA intentionally avoided inviting former Pakistani captain Asif Iqbal for the first Test here, but he surely made his association?s position on this clear. 

Reacting to Asif?s claim that keeping him out was a plan (primarily by the ICC), Bindra said Saturday that it was ?entirely the PCA?s prerogative who we want to invite.? 

In a rather diplomatic aside, Bindra added: ?I find no reason why Asif has to react because we have never said anything concerning him.?

 The Polynesian poised to win 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainers Denial David and Errol Bhungard gear up for another big haul of winners in Wednesdays seven-event race card. But it is the fellow-schooler Bharath Singh who may call the shots in the main event, the INS Netaji Subhas Cup over 1,400 metres.

 Bharaths The Polynesian is not only well in at the weights, the Young Senor-One Up six-year-old has also been working well since long. Malcom Maseyk partners the topweighted horse.

 The 1,100m Eastern Naval Command Cup may, however, see Errols Generous Gesture coming good. The Always A Rainbow-Respecting four-year-old badly needed his last run and he may strike in the hands of jockey S. Tamang.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

Dambulla: Sanath Jayasuriya proved to be Indias nemesis yet again as he defied a painful shoulder to steer Sri Lanka to a three-wicket victory in the opening match of the Indian Oil Cup tri-series here on Saturday. 

After restricting India to 205 for nine on a difficult track, the hosts were gasping at 140 for seven before Jayasuriya (43 not out) guided the team home with ten balls to spare in an absorbing floodlit encounter. 

The flamboyant left-hander, coming out to bat at No. 6 with a dislocated right shoulder, showed no signs of discomfort as he tilted the balance in favour of the home team in the low-scoring game. 

The Indians, desperate to launch the new season on a winning note, put up a spirited fight with captain Rahul Dravid employing an attacking field right through. But they ran out of steam towards the end. 

Indias batting woes in the Emerald Isles came to the fore again with Dravid having to nurse a depleted line-up after the side had slipped to 64 for five. 

Dravid, who top-scored with 54, led the recovery process through a 58-run sixth partnership with debutant Y. Venugopala Rao. 

Raos steady innings of 38, particularly the way he handled off-spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan, was a bright note for the Indians after the inept performance of the top order. 

Irfan Pathan (21), Harbhajan Singh (20 not out) and Zaheer Khan (20) provided the late spark that propelled the Indian score past the once-improbable looking 200-mark. 

Muralidharan blew holes in the myth that the Indians are better players of spin bowling as he repeatedly deceived them with his variations. 

The off-spinner claimed three for 33. Right-arm pacer Ferveez Mahroof was another bowler who troubled the Indians with disconcerting bounce. 

The Indians day began on a disappointing note as V.V.S. Laxman was ruled unfit for the game. His back strain did not subside as expected. 

The hosts, without experienced pacer Chaminda Vaas, also had their share of worries when Sanath Jayasuriya injured his right shoulder trying to stop a shot and came off the field in visible pain. That he braved a minor dislocation to bat and play a matchwinning unbeaten 43 is another story. 

The Indians began in a blaze. Virender Sehwag shot off the blocks as only he can before Maharoof bowled him with a perfect leg-cutter in the third over. Sehwag made 14. 

It signalled a procession of wickets in which newcomer Dilhara Lokuhettige played a key role.

 Bangalore Hi-Fliers edge past Chennai Veerans 

Hyderabad: Bangalore Hi-Fliers displayed a fine blend of free-flowing and aggressive hockey as they outplayed Chennai Veerans 3-2 in the tier I match of the Premier Hockey League on Sunday. 

Though the final scoreline did not reflect the domination of the Hi-Fliers throughout the 70-minute period, the Arjun Halappa-led side must be satisfied with the display they gave in the field after the demoralising defeat to Sher-E-Jalandhar on Saturday. 

Sandeep Michael opened the account of the winners in the ninth minute, finishing off a brilliant move from the right and penalty corner expert Len Aiyappa made it 2-0 two minutes before half-time with a clean strike. 

The Hi-Fliers looked like running away with the game when Amar Aiyamma scored the third goal in the 40th minutes, capping off a counter attack started by his skipper. 

William Xalxo (45th) and Sandeep Singh (69th) then found the net for the Veerans, but it was too little too late. 

The under-pressure Veerans got a chance to stage a comeback when they were awarded a penalty stroke following a melee in the striking circle. Xalxo made no mistake in beating custodian Bharat Chetri, who had already committed towards his left. 

Drag-flicker Sandeep, who had a pretty ordinary day, finally came into his own when he sent the ball in the net one minute from time. 

In the tier II matches, Chandigarh Dynamos thrashed Imphal Rangers 5-2 while Delhi Dazzlers made it three wins in a row beating Lucknow Nawabs blanking them 2-0. Penalty-corner expert Jugraj Singh, who is making a comeback after an injury, scored a brace for the Dynamos as his side dominated the proceeding for the entire 70 minutes. 

In the other match, the Dazzlers lived dangerously but managed to come away unscathed, thanks to two late strikes from Gurcharan Singh (60th minute) and Raju (69th) in the last ten minutes. 

The Dazzlers are now on top of the league with nine points. (PTI)

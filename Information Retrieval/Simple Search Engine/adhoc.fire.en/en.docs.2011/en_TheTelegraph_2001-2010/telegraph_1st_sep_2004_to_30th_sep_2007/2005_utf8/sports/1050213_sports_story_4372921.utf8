Pebble Beach: Phil Mickelson kept up his inspired form at the $5.3 million Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in California on Friday, carding a five-under 67 to take a four-stroke lead over fellow left-hander Mike Weir after Round II. 

World No. 4 Mickelson, who began the day with a three-shot advantage after opening with a tournament record 10-under 62, continued to shine in steady drizzle at the Poppy Hills Golf Club, one of three courses being used this week. 

Paul Goydos, Kevin Sutherland and Andrew Magee were two shots further back on nine-under 135 while Britain?s Darren Clarke, playing here for the first time, headed a group of five on eight-under. 

Kent Jones had the day?s top round, a seven-under 65, to vault up the leaderboard and join Clarke, Arjun Atwal, Charles Howell III and Britain?s Greg Owen on 136. Atwal carded a successive four-under 68. 

It was another frustrating day for defending champion Vijai Singh, who struggled to a second successive one-over 73. The lanky Fijian will have to produce a much better effort on Saturday or he will be in danger of missing the cut. (REUTERS)

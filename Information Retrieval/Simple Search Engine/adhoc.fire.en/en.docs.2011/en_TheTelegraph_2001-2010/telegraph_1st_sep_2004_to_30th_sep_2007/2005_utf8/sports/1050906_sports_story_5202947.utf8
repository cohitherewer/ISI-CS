A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar hopes Sourav Ganguly will be back in his commanding self in Tuesdays tri-series final against New Zealand in Zimbabwe. 

Hes too good a batsman to be out of runs for long. He has quality, he has a big-match temperament? Im hopeful hell come good tomorrow, Vengsarkar, who currently holds the chairmans post of BCCIs talent and research development programme, said here on Monday. 

May be, hes having some problems with the acclimatisation. But Sourav should attempt hooks more often, Vengsarkar observed. 

Asked about Suresh Rainas potential, he felt that hes talented... hell get his chances on a regular basis in due course of time.

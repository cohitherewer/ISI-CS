 Pakistan can win without me, says Shoaib

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar Sunday expressed frustration at having to skip the Indian tour due to injury, but dismissed claims that he pulled out of the high-profile series for fear of failure. 

The Rawalpindi Express, who cited a hamstring injury as reason for not playing in the series, said he had missed out on a great opportunity to earn a name for himself. 

?That was such an opportunity. You do something and you make yourself a big name,? the maverick 29-year-old fast bowler said but added, ?If you don?t do it, you get a bad name.? 

?I always look for the bigger tours and bigger games to perform,? he stated. 

Less than 24 hours before withdrawing from the tour of India, Shoaib, who has missed 30 of Pakistan?s 66 Tests since making his debut in 1997, was fined $500 and reprimanded for indiscipline. 

The speedster said he needed rest, which might cast a shadow on his participation in the one-dayers as well. So far he has said that he will be skipping the Test series and should be back for the one-dayers. The one-day series starts in Kochi on April 2. 

?I?m there to serve my country as best as I can. But if I?m fully fit I can do a better job,? said the pacer, the only bowler in history to have twice broken the 100-mile barrier. I had a good chat with my consultant and doctors and they asked me to rest because hamstring problems always take a bit longer to heal than you think.? 

Shoaib admitted that he was half-fit during the recent tour of Australia where Pakistan lost in all three Tests. 

?We always take chances, we always play with niggles and injuries. I don?t know a fast bowler who doesn?t. But what people don?t understand is a fast bowler can?t play every game because it?s too hard to do that. The amount of cricket we are playing nowadays is not easy at all.? 

Shoaib said even without him, Pakistan have the capacity to beat India in the forthcoming series. ?We have great players and if they put it together we have a great chance to win. Our team is a strong unit and we have learnt a lot from the Australian tour,? he added. (PTI)

 Lifters ban reduced

New Delhi: Lifetime doping bans imposed on three women weightlifters last year have been reduced to two years to comply with international guidelines, a WFI official said on Thursday. 

The IOA wrote to us last week and said that in deference to the rules of WADA and the international federation, we can impose only two year bans, a WFI official said. Both WADA and the IWF stipulate two-year bans for first-time offenders although Bhatia said that two of the weightlifters, Pratima Kumari and Sanamacha Chanu, had tested positive earlier. 

Kumari tested positive for anabolic steroids while Chanu, fourth in the 53 kg in Athens, tested positive for the diuretic furosemide. (Reuters)

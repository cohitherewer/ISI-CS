 Its back to roots for Hewitt

Sydney: Adelaide-born Lleyton Hewitt is going back to his roots in a bid to become the first home player to win the Australian Open since Mark Edmondson in 1976. 

The world No. 4 is hoping a nostalgic trip down memory lane will help him go one step further next year than he did in February when he was beaten in the final by Russian Marat Safin. 

Hewitt, whose actress wife Bec Cartwright is expecting the couples first child later this year, has already begun wearing the same black and white headbands donned by his childhood hero Pat Cash. 

Now he plans to return to his birthplace to launch his 2006 season at the same event where his professional career began. 

Hewitt was just 16 and still at school when he won the 1998 Australian hardcourt title at Adelaides Memorial Drive, becoming the second youngest winner of an ATP event. 

He never went back to school as he started out on the road to fame and fortune, establishing himself as one of the finest players of his generation. 

Hewitt lost to Thomas Enqvist in the 1999 Adelaide final but beat the Swede to reclaim the title 12 months later. 

The feisty Australian reached the quarter finals in 2001 but did not return for another four years as his career really took off. 

Hewitt won the US Open in 2001, then Wimbledon the following season to finish both years ranked number one in the world before his career started to go into decline. 

He has not won a Grand Slam since although he has not been far away ? reaching the 2004 US Open final as well as in Melbourne this year ? but is desperate to win another major. 

Now 24, Hewitt returned to Adelaide this year and while he did not win the tournament, his success in reaching the final at Melbourne Park convinced him to go back home again next year. 

I love coming back to Adelaide and always enjoy fantastic support from the fans at Memorial Drive, he said in a statement. 

As I found earlier this year, (Adelaide) set me up for a great summer and hopefully next year I can go on to do even better. 

On Wednesday in Cincinnati, Hewitt, the third seed, rallied to beat Greg Rusedski 1-6, 7-5, 6-4. 

Having been forced to withdraw from his opening match in Montreal last week because of a virus, the third-seeded Australian looked out of sorts as Rusedski romped through the opening set in 20 minutes. 

But Hewitt snatched a break each in the second and third sets to set up a meeting with Mario Ancic.

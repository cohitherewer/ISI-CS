 Akram sees English resurgence

 Akram doesn?t think Australia?s over-dominance has stagnated the game 

Karachi: England have been given an even chance of reclaiming the Ashes from Australia this year by former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram. 

?For the first time in eight years I can see a side which can compete on even terms with Australia,? Akram said on Sunday. 

The left-arm fast bowler, who retired after the 2003 World Cup with a haul of 414 Test and 502 one-day international wickets, said England had formed a very good team and can win the Ashes this summer at home. 

?I tell you it is going to be one hell of an interesting series. Australia obviously is the best these days. But guys like Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison and Andrew Strauss are mature players and have made England a very competitive and dangerous outfit.? 

While Australia completed five Test series wins last year including a first win in India in 35 years, England won 11 matches and drew two in the same period. 

The Australians have also won the last two World Cups in 1999 and 2003. 

Akram, who played for 10 years with English county side Lancashire, said the Australians were a first-rate side at absorbing pressure and were mentally very strong. ?And England is also getting there. That is why the Ashes this time could go either way,? he added. 

Akram, now a commentator, said the Ashes rubber would be a big boost for the sport. ?I don?t agree with the argument that cricket has stagnated due to the complete dominance of the Australians. They have set a benchmark for other teams and it is intriguing waiting to see which side dethrones them.? 

He also felt there should be no surprise over Pakistan being outclassed by Australia in the ongoing Test series. ?I don?t know why people are so surprised. Pakistan went to Australia with a very inexperienced batting line-up?, he said.

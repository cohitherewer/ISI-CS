 Tiger out to defend title

 - WGC MEET 

 Tiger Woods 

Toronto: A possible return to the top of the rankings will provide added incentive for Tiger Woods when he defends his title at this week?s World Golf Championships (WGC) matchplay event. 

With the exception of No. 3 Ernie Els of South Africa, 64 of the 65 top-ranked players will travel to the La Costa Resort and Spa in rainy southern California hoping to stop Woods going back to No. 1 in the world. 

That is a daunting task given the 29-year-old American?s early-season form and complete mastery of the matchplay format. 

A fearless competitor who thrives on head-to-head competition, Woods has dominated this event since it began six years ago, claiming back-to-back wins in 2003 and 2004 and finishing runner-up in 2000. 

He has a sparkling 20-3 record in the tournament and will carry a 12-match unbeaten run into Wednesday?s first-round tussle with Nick Price of Zimbabwe. 

?Any time you play matchplay it is really tough on your mind,? said world No. 2 Woods. ?It?s just an emotional rollercoaster you go through each and every match. It?s just fun going head-to-head against somebody and always has been. Just look them eyeball-to-eyeball and say, ?let?s go?.? 

For the first time, Woods will arrive in Carlsbad not seeded No. 1 but will fully expect to leave with the title of the world?s best player he surrendered to Vijai Singh last season. 

The knockout format leaves open the possibility of a mouth-watering final showdown on Sunday between Woods and Singh.

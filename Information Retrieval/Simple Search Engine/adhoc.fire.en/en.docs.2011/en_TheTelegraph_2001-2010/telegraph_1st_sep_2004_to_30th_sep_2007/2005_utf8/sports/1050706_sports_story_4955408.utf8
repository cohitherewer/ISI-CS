 Narain hopes to satisfy fans 

Silverstone: After having to cope up with high temperatures in Asia, unfamiliar tracks in North America and a heartbreaking gearbox failure in the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours, Narain Karthikeyan now has only one aim ? not to disappoint Jordan fans on their home track this Sunday. 

The rookie Indian driver is once again at a familiar track where he tasted his first success in Formula 3. 

I have good memories of Silverstone as it was here that I had my first podium when I was racing in Formula 3. Usually I always go well at Silverstone and this is a circuit I know quite well, he said. 

I like Silverstone, especially the Becketts complex, where the car goes so fast you can really feel the speed of the car. At that special corner, you go as fast as 220 kmph, so there is a lot of g-force. I hope we will be able to finish the race, particularly there in front of Jordan home crowd, he said. 

Following another positive two-car finish in Magny-Cours last weekend, Jordan is looking forward to racing at Silverstone, its home race circuit with its factory just across the road. Although the track is familiar to the three drivers before they entered Formula One and from several test sessions, it still remains a challenge for them and the car due to the mix of high and low speed corners with some long straights making it quite physically demanding. 

Robert Doornbos will once again be driving the new ej15b car on Friday for further development and adding mileage.The second Jordan driver, Tiago Monteiro, said the circuit would be the toughest for the Jordan cars. 

Silverstone is a very important race for Jordan because of the proximity of its factory. A lot of guests will be there and we will need to perform well. It is a very demanding and difficult track, he said. 

It will probably be one of the hardest for our car. We are also starting a very long month so we should stay in good shape and focused on everything. I am definitely looking forward to the weekend. 

Sporting director Adrian Burgess urged the team to do really well in their home Grand Prix. 

We are all looking forward to racing at Silverstone our home Grand Prix. We would like to do especially well here with the presence of our factory-based staff, sponsors, guests and fans, who will support us throughout the weekend, he said.

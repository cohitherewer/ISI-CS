 Six birdies put Mukesh on lead

Gurgaon: Mukesh Kumar had a dream back nine as he converted six birdies and soared into the lead at the end of the half-way stage of the Rs 25 lakh Vipul Indian Masters, the 10th leg of the Amby Valley PGAI Tour at the Jack Nicklaus designed Classic Golf Resort here on Wednesday. 

With the event being played on the modified stableford format, Mukesh, who also made an eagle on his front nine, garnered +16 points to take his 36-hole tally to +26 points, three points ahead of the first day leader C. Muniyappa. 

The Bangalore-lad could not retain his form, carding +5 points on the second day. 

S. S. P. Chowrasia was third at +20, while Digvijay Singh and Uttam Singh Mundy were tied for the fourth spot at +19. Shamim Khan and Naman Dawar shared the sixth place at +16. 

As many as 61 professionals made it to the money making rounds after the cut was applied at +1. Joining them was D. S. Kullar, the lone amateur to make the professional cut. 

Money list leader on the Tour, Mukesh Kumar began his journey with an eagle on the 562-yard par-five third that fetched him +5 points. 

After two good shots, the pro chipped in from 40 yards for an eagle-two. 

Despite being aggressive, the 38-year-old was not able to convert any more birdies, missing a couple of them from short distances. 

In trying for another eagle on the par-five ninth, Mukesh over-drove and lost a stroke and with it a point too.

 Zaheer fit and raring to go

Chennai: Indian strike bowler Zaheer Khan claims he is ready to achieve best results in the coming season as I am now very fit and ready to go in for the kill. 

As of today, things are looking good, both in fitness and bowling? I am doing well. I feel happy over being able to bend the ball back and am doing all the right things in preparation, the mediumpacer said at the MRF Pace Academy here, where Team India physio John Gloster is scheduled to put him through the paces. 

Zaheer is presently training under fitness expert Ramji Srinivasan, who is co-ordinating his progress with national team trainer, Gregory Allen King. 

The paceman said he was honoured to be termed as the best bowler in the country by Jawagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad. Zaheer, however, differed from Srinaths suggestion that fast bowlers should be rotated on a regular basis. (PTI)

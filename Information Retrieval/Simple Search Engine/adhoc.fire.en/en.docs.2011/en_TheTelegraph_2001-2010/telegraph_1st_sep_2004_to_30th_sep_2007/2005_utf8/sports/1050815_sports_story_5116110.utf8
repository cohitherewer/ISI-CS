 Australians rattled by English aggression

 Guest Column - Ian Chappell 

 Vaughan rsquo;s batting style is based 

 on a proactive approach

Its abmazing how quickly things change in cricket. A couple of weeks ago, Australia had a double celebration; first it was Glenn McGraths 500th Test wicket and then victory at Lords. 

They would have been expecting a similar celebration at Old Trafford but the only joy so far has been Shane Warnes 600th Test wicket; one minute the blond bamboozler is toiling for a milestone and the next hes trawling for runs. The turnaround, inspired by Andrew Flintoff and overseen by captain Michael Vaughan, has been amazing. 

Englands greatest achievement in this series has been to alter the way the Australians bat; this has given them the advantage in the battle of wills. 

Where the Australians have bullied other sides with their aggressive stroke play, since the second innings at Lords, England have gradually forced the batsmen to re-think their policy of all-out aggression. This psychological advantage has resulted from Englands own brand of aggressive batting complemented by attacking bowling and imaginative captaincy. 

On the other hand, Australia have been forced into a corner since Ricky Ponting blundered by inserting the opposition at Edgbaston. With the momentum going Australias way, Ponting either seriously misjudged the pitch or was lulled into a false sense of security after the Lords win and felt this is the same old England. 

Whatever Pontings reasoning, that will be the defining decision if the Ashes are lost. 

England wrenched the initiative from Australia with that thunderous first innings at Edgbaston. 

Australia almost regained it when the bowlers took them to within three runs of victory but they quickly surrendered it again at Old Trafford. 

In this absorbing tug-of-war England have succeeded in pulling the Australians weight off their heels and they are in serious danger of toppling over the line. 

The decision to rush McGrath back into the side was an indication that the Australians were rattled by the Edgbaston onslaught. 

Apart from his initial spell on each of the first two days, McGrath struggled to exert his usual control over the England batsmen. 

Pontings problems were then exacerbated by Jason Gillespie offering more handouts than the Salvation Army and hes had to rely heavily on Warne to curb the run scoring and Brett Lee to act as the battering ram. 

In the past Australia have been able to bore, badger and bully the opposition into capitulation. McGrath did the boring, Warne the badgering and the batsmen finished the job by bullying into surrender all but the strongest opponents. 

As a result of their aggression, England have shown Ponting can be made to back off quickly with his field placements and once this important headland has been conceded its difficult to recover. 

With McGrath and Warne at their best it can be done. And if Australia can re-establish their favoured mode of batting it can also be achieved but this is the more difficult of the two options. 

Pontings captaincy is in the mould of his predecessor Steve Waugh; full of aggression when on top but inclined to conservatism when the opposition press. 

Vaughan reminds me of Mark Taylor, Circa 1997. Despite his troubles as a batsman Taylor remained in control as a captain and his leadership helped to retain the Ashes. 

Vaughan struggled as a batsman in his first four innings, being bowled three times. Even at the start of his Old Trafford innings he shuffled more than Bret Maverick but eventually his footwork steadied, his timing followed and the runs flowed. 

Throughout all his batting struggles he looked in control on the field and his authority remained intact; appearance is important for a captain and Vaughan hasnt once portrayed any insecurity. 

He isnt one to let an innings just roll along; a good captain is proactive and Vaughan is generally ahead of the game and relies on his gut feel for inspiration. This has shown up in the number of times hes managed a breakthrough immediately after implementing a bowling change. He is a bit magnanimous in the way he allows easy singles but this is now a trend among modern leaders. 

Vaughans batting style is based on a similar proactive approach; he doesnt like just to accumulate runs. 

Once he was in at Old Trafford he attacked unmercifully and while this approach had a downside ? holing out to a part-timer when he had Australia at his mercy ? it is the classic style of a No.3 in a successful side. 

It also sets a good example for match-winners like Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen who need to bat unencumbered by any thought they might be admonished by the captain for an ambitious shot. 

This trio, with their aggressive stroke play, have plundered the bowling and made possible two big first-innings totals in smart time. These totals allowed the bowlers to attack the Australian batsmen and force them to re-think their style of play. 

Not only has Englands turn-around been quick it has also been exciting. So quick, in fact, that if they finish what they have started at Old Trafford, it will be the Australians contemplating new personnel. 

Ill bet they werent thinking about drastic changes while they were toasting McGrath?

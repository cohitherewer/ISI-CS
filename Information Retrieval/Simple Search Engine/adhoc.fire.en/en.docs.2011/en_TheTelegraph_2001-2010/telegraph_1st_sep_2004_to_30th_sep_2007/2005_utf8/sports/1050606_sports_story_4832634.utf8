 PCB eyes joint bid 

Karachi: The PCB Sunday said it preferred a joint bid for the 2011 World Cup as it would make for a unique event hosted by four equal partners including India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 

India have 27 international standard grounds while we have no more than five and Sri Lanka have almost the same. Bangladesh also have a handful of stadia, PCB chairman Saharyar Khan said. We would definitely like to be equal partners. (Agencies)

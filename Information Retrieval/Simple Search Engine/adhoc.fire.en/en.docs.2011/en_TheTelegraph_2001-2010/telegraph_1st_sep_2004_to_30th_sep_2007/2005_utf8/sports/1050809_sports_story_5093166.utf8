The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India cant afford to take feet 

 off pedal

Straight Talk 

Arjuna Ranatunga

 Virender Sehwag is now a matter 

 of concern for the Indians. Nobody doubts him but that does 

 not translate into runs and the Indians need that badly. 

 He will have one more chance to atone in the final of the 

 tri-series against Sri Lanka on Tuesday.

 You do wonder if the status of 

 a senior member of the side, as well as being vice-captain, 

 has made him conscious of his role. Sehwag is best when 

 he is carefree. He has not looked normal. May be he is consciously 

 trying to bat 50 overs: maybe he does not want to go for 

 booming shots early in the innings. But the Indians are 

 feeling the pinch.

 Suggestions that the new coach 

 may be fiddling with Sehwags technique are a whole 

 lot of nonsense. You do not change his technique just as 

 you do not ask Sanath Jayasuriya to bat different to his 

 nature. But Sehwag can do a lot if he can just walk in without 

 a care in the world.

 V.V.S. Laxman is another story. 

 He is struggling badly. He is one of the most senior members 

 of the side, but is still finding his feet in one-day cricket. 

 He does not inspire confidence enough to be part of the 

 Indian XI in the final. He does not have that sense of urgency 

 that India presently need.

 The injury to Sourav Ganguly off 

 a short-pitched delivery will once again raise the old bogey 

 of his weakness. But then the wickets in the sub-continent 

 could help fast bowlers with its own vagaries. 

 Unlike Australia or South Africa 

 where the ball comes in at even pace and height, the ones 

 in the sub-continent are generally not true. I still carry 

 the image of the Sourav of previous years when he was good 

 at hooking and pulling. Maybe he should start doing it more 

 often once again.

 Unlike these seniors, Anil Kumble 

 had reasons to be happy with his first one-day match of 

 the new season. He bowled excellently with results to show. 

 He was fired up and now it will be difficult to keep him 

 out of the fray. Harbhajan too does not deserve to sit in 

 the shade. I would not be surprised if both the spinners 

 are picked for the final. Both are top-quality spin bowlers 

 and can create pressure in tandem.

 The Indians need to address quite 

 a few issues if they want to seriously become a force in 

 one-day cricket. To me they look extremely ordinary in the 

 field. The pick-ups are not clean and pure and throws from 

 the outfield are weak. They are still not at their best 

 and struggling. 

 Yuvraj, we all know, is extremely 

 talented but for a variety of reasons he has not been consistent. 

 His hundred against the West Indies on Monday showed how 

 very annoyed he was with his own form. Some of his shots 

 were breathtaking and dispirited the West Indies. 

 The Sri Lankans are in the final 

 as a matter of routine and it would take an inspired performance 

 by the Indians to stop them in their tracks. One thing that 

 the Indians should try to take advantage of is the Sri Lankan 

 top-order that has not really clicked.

 The Indians should target the 

 first four batsmen and keep the pressure on the rest. One 

 thing is for sure, they cannot afford to take their feet 

 off the gas pedal. (PTI)

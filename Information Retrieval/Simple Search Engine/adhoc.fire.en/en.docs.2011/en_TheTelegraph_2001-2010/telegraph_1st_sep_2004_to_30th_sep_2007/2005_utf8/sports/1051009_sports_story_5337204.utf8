Tokyo: Sania Mirzas brilliant run in the $170,000 Japan Open came to an end in the semi-final on Saturday when she lost to Frances Tatiana Golovin in straight sets. 

Sanias fine form in the tournament eluded her against the third seed as she went down 2-6, 4-6 in the Tier III ATP-WTA tournament. 

Tatiana set up a summit clash with Czech Republics Nicole Vaidisova who beat Russias Maria Kirilenko 6-4, 6-2. 

The Indian tennis star made a brave comeback from 0-5 down in the second set after being swept away in the first but unforced errors once again came back to haunt her. 

An off-colour Sania, who upset Vera Zvonareva of Russia in a thrilling three-setter Friday, ran out of steam in the first set as the Frenchwoman breezed through the first set. 

Egged by the cheering crowd, the 37-ranked Sania rallied from behind to give a scare to her oponnent in the second set. Im really happy... its going to be really exciting tomorrow, the 17-year-old Golovin said. 

The eighth-seeded Mirza looked out of sorts in the gusty conditions despite vociferous crowd support. A strong wind made conditions tricky but Golovin kept her cool while Mirzas more attack-minded tactics were out of sync with the conditions. 

The wind affected both of us but I think I dealt with it a little better, Golovin said. 

Moscow-born Golovin ended the first set with a stunning drive from outside the right tramlines and streaked into a 5-0 lead in the second set. 

With the fans noisily supporting the Indian, Mirza rallied to 5-2 before rain forced the Centre Court roof to be closed. The Indian superstar quickly put two more games on the scoreboard, but despite loud chants of Mirza Mirza, she surrendered another service game and with it the match. 

Its always good to have the crowd behind you, Sania said. Im sorry if I let them down. I just wanted to get a game, and then I saw an opening. At 5-4, it could have gone either way. 

Sundays final will be repeat of a first-round match in last years competition when Golovin was the second seed. Vaidisova, then only 15, won the match 6-3, 6-4. 

The mens final will see Mario Ancic of Croatia face Jarkko Nieminen of Finland.

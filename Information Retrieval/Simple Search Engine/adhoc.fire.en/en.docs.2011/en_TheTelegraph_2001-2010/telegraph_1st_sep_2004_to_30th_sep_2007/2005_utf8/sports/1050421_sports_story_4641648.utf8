 Czechs in 2nd spot, India 135th 

London: The Czech Republic have moved up to second place in the Fifa world rankings following their two World Cup qualifying wins last month. 

Victories over Finland and Andorra have kept the Euro 2004 semi-finalists well-placed in European zone group I and lifted them to their highest position for six years in the latest rankings published on Wednesday. 

France, who continue to struggle in their qualifying group, slipped two places to fourth. 

India with 357 points also moved down by one place to 135 and they now lie in between St Vincent and Grenadines and Fiji. 

World champions Brazil remain in top spot, with Argentina, currently leading the South American qualifying competition for the 2006 World Cup, still in third.

 McEwen wins fifth stage

 - TOUR DE FRANCE 

 Robbie McEwen celebrates after crossing the finish line of the fifth stage of the Tour de France on Wednesday 

Montargis: Australias Robbie McEwen outsprinted Belgian Tom Boonen to win the Tour de Frances fifth stage with a spirit of revenge on Wednesday. 

Winner of the points classification last year, the Australian champion beat Boonen on the line at Montargis to claim the sixth Tour stage of his career. 

Boonen, who dominated the previous two mass sprint finishes in the second and third stages, was first into action in the finish. But he ran out of gas close to the line and a last-gasp kick was enough for the Davitamon Lotto leader to overtake him. 

Victory was all the sweeter for McEwen as he had been disqualified two days earlier after being involved in a brawl with compatriot Stuart Grady. 

Norways Thor Hushovd was third in the same time, while six-times winner and overall race leader Lance Armstrong finished back in the peloton. 

Today I timed it just right, said McEwen after winning a stage at the third attempt since the weekend. 

The first time, I started too far down. The second I was disqualified. This time Im the fastest. 

Its a sort of revenge as I was really frustrated after the disqualification. 

The peloton came close to covering the 183 km from the spectacular Chambord castle without a rider in the leaders yellow jersey as Armstrong at first decided not to wear it as a tribute to previous leader David Zabriskie. (Reuters)

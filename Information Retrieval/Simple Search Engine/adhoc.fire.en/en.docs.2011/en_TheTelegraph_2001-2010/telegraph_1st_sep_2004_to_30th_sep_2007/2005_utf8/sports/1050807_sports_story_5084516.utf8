 10-man Bayern start with win

Munich: Down to 10 men for the entire second half, champions Bayern Munich began their German title defence with a 3-0 victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday. 

Dutchman Roy Makaay settled the tie with two goals in the 86th and 89th minutes of a match which Bayern had dominated in their new stadium. 

A turbulent first half had produced a well-taken Owen Hargreaves goal from a Roque Santa Cruz lay-back in the 28th minute and a second yellow card for new signing Valerien Ismael two minutes from half-time. 

Ismael, a new arrival from Werder Bremen, was deservedly booked for his first challenge, but the French central defender was unlucky to get his marching orders later after a light pull on Moenchengladbach striker Oliver Neuvilles shirt. 

Outnumbered Bayern pressed in the second half and Hargreaves found Santa Cruz free, but the Paraguayan struck the post. (Reuters)

 Bagan rally to beat Churchill

 - NFL - JCT outgun Salgaocar 3-1 

 Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? scored Bagan?s winner 

Margao: Former champions Mohun Bagan rallied from behind to beat Churchill Brothers 2-1 in the fourth round of the ninth ONCG National Football League on Saturday. 

Bagan?s Brazilian striker Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? scored the winner after substitute Sunil Chhetri cancelled Yusif Yakubu?s strike in the first half. 

With this win, Bagan have collected seven points from four matches while Churchill, who suffered their third defeat, have one point from four matches. Defender Eduardo Coelho of Bagan was declared the Man of the Match. 

Churchil, knowing well that any slip-up would further dent their morale, played with determination. Vanlal Rova, who played his first match, was perfect foil for Yakubu as they troubled the rival defence and took lead in the 19th minute. A combined move between Rova and Roque Baretto from the middle saw the latter push a pass which deflected off a rival defender to Yakubu. Yakubu?s right-footer found the far end of the netting. 

Bagan, unperturbed, regrouped and attacked despite stiff resistance from defenders. Two Beto Attempts were saved by ?keeper Vinay Singh and off target. 

Bagan pressed more after change of ends, with Chhetri (a replacement for Jerry Zirsanga) being rewarded in the 51st minute, heading in a free-kick by Dharamjit Singh from the right. 

Churchill brought in I. M. Vijayan in the closing stages, but failed to guard their goal. That was when Mehtab Hussein found space on the left to lay a pass to Beto. Beto placed the winner past ?keeper Singh. 

In Ludhiana, JCT Mills beat Salgaocar Sports Club 3-1 at the Guru Nanak Stadium. 

JCT?s Hardeep Gill opened the account in the 54th minute and 20 minutes later Sukhjinder Singh increased the lead. 

In the 86th minute, Salgaocar reduced the margin through Bernard Pires who scored from a penalty. JCT increased the lead further through Surjit. (PTI)

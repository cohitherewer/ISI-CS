The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 AIFF gives in to pressure

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The foreign players will be reintroduced in the second division National Football League (NFL) from this season. 

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) further decided in its executive committee meeting, held in New Delhi on Wednesday, that foreigners will also be allowed to feature in domestic leagues including the Calcutta Super League. 

Last season, the foreigners were not allwed in the NFL second division. 

IFA secretary Subrata Dutta, who led the rally against AIFFs ban-foreigners (in local meets) move, was visibly happy. 

It was an unanimous decision in the meeting. We were able to convince the president (Priya Ranjan Das Munshi) that such move is actually detrimental to the larger interests of the game in the country. Were happy that he had listened to us and agreed to maintain the status quo, Dutta, who also attended the meeting, told The Telegraph from New Delhi. 

In the NFL second division, each team, however, can register two foreigners and field both. The same is applicable to local leagues as well. Thus the Super Division teams can have only two foreigners and not three, on their roster. 

The teams in the NFL top tier, however, will be able register three foreigners and play two. 

Meanwhile, a task force to turn the NFL into a professional meet in 2006-2007 season has been set up. Dutta is one of the members of this task force.

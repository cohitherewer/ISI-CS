 Randhawa moves to tied sixth

Shenzhen (China): Jyoti Randhawa shot a five-under 67 to tally 138 and move to tied sixth place at the midway stage of the $1.3m Volvo China Open at the Shenzhen Golf Club here on Friday. Another Indian, Shiv Kapur, with his two-under 70 in the second round climbed to tied eighth place. 

In all four Indians made the cut. Gaurav Ghei was tied 25th with rounds of 72 and 70, while Rahil Gangjee was tied 41st after rounds of 71 and 72. Amandeep Johl and Harmeet Kahlon missed out as the cut came at even par. 

Overnight co-leader chawalit plaphol followed his first round 65 with a 67 to open up a huge three-shot lead over Francois Delamontagne and Oliver Wilson, who were at nine-under. 

Simon Yates was lying fourth at eight-under 136 and Ross Fisher was one shot further behind. 

Randhawa was disappointed with his late bogeys. He had a four-under back nine as he started from tenth and then had three birdies between first and further. Just then he dropped a shot each on sixth and ninth to close at 67. I didnt like the bogey on the last hole (the ninth). 

I was in the middle of the fairway with an eight iron. I was thinking of birdie and hurried my shot and got into the bunker, he said.

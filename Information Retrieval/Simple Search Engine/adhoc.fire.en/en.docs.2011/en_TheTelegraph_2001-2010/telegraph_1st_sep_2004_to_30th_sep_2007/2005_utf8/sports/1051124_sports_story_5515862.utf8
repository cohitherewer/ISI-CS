The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Harper 

missing Sourav 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Australians have a love-hate relationship with Sourav Ganguly. However, for Daryl Harper, the former India captain is a strong character and a good friend. More importantly, the Australian is missing him. 

I consider him a to be good friend. Last time when I came to Calcutta (for officiating the India-South Africa Test match in December), we once bumped into each other at the hotel. He shook my hands and wished me well. Its a nice gesture, and I still cherish that moment, Harper, who is going to be the on-field umpire for Fridays day-nighter along with A.V. Jayaprakash, said on Wednesday. 

Are you missing him and his on-the-field aggression? Of course, I am, pat came the reply from the Australian. Hes a good player. I also know that hes the most successful captain in India? its been a wonderful achievement in Indian cricket. Im hoping to see him again, Harper said. 

The International Cricket Council (ICC) elite panel umpire, however, is bracing up for the challenge of officiating at the Eden. 

Umpiring in the subcontinent is the most challenging. There are so many people, so much noise that you can never take your eyes off the ball, he said. 

So how is he preparing for the Eden engagement? When its difficult to hear the nicks, you need to depend on the players body language and other related things, he remarked. 

Harper, however, doesnt think that the new changes in one-dayer rules ? power play and super sub ? have changed the game dramatically. 

The new changes have made the game more interesting, was his view. 

Talking about dependence on technology, he felt cricket is evolving? but it has to be a good mixture of technology and human endeavour.

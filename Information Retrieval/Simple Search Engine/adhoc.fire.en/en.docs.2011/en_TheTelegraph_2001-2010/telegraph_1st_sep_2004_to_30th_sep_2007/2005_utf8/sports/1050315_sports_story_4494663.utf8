The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kaneria up with Warne and Kumble: Woolmer

Calcutta: A lot of hype preceded Danish Kaneria 

to India. His achievements in Mohali have only accentuated this. And Pakistan 

coach Bob Woolmer too is singing the same tune. 

Describing the leggie as a ?jewel,? Woolmer thinks he?s ?up with Shane Warne and Anil Kumble.? 

?Danish is like a diamond ring, something one doesn?t want to lose. He?s a jewel in our attack,? the Pakistan coach felt about the bowler. 

When asked to compare him with current stalwarts like Warne and Kumble, Woolmer was quick to add that ?Danish is now one of the leading leg-spinners in the world and he?s certainly up with the duo.? 

Kaneria, however, wore an embarrassed look when he came to learn about his coach?s profuse eulogy. ?I?ll certainly try to live up to his expectation at the Eden,? Pakistan?s main bowling hope said later at the team hotel. 

Kaneria, incidentally, paid a visit to the Kalighat temple in the evening and prayed for success here. 

?I?m in the habit of visiting temples wherever I go. I?ve heard a lot about this temple and didn?t want to miss the opportunity of going there on my maiden visit to the city,? Kaneria said. 

?In the temple, I offered puja for my newly-born daughter (Parisa). Also I prayed for my team?s success,? he remarked.

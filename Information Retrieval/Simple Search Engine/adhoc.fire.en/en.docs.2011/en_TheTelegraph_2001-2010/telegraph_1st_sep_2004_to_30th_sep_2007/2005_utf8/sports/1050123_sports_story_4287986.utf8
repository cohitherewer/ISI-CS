 Salgaocar thrash Tolly 

Margao: Two early goals helped Salgaocar to break Tollygunge?s stubborn defence to score a resounding 5-1 victory in the third round of the ninth National Football League on Saturday. 

Salgaocar, who led 3-1 at half time, scored through Jyothi Kumar (17th), Felix Ibrebru (20th, 53rd), Francis Andrade (42nd) and Bernard Pires (69th). Tollygunge reduced the margin through Suley Musah in the 25th minute. The win took Salgaocar?s tally to six points from three matches. Tollygugne who lost their first match have four points from three matches. 

Salgaocar took the lead in the 17th minute when Jyothi Kumar scored on the rebound after rival custodian Sudip Sarkar fumbled the shot by Felix Ibrebru. Ibrebru doubled the lead, who struck after a combined move by Rocus Lamare and Samson Singh. 

Tollygunge reduced the margin when Salgaocar ?keeper Juje Siddi charged out to intercept a lob from Gouranga Dutta which eluded his outstretched hands for Suley Musah to score an opportunistic goal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Record by Antara

Chennai: Andhra Pradeshs P. Thrinadh stole the limlelight with his second national record of the meet to win the boys U-20 800m event while Bengals Antana Khatun also set a new mark in the U-16 girls pentathlon on the penultimate day of the SRM National Junior Athletics Championship here on Monday. 

Thrinadh, who had won the 1,500m with a national record on the first day of the championship, remained the only athlete to score a golden double on a day when two national and as many meet records were set in the 24 finals. 

In pentathlon, all three medal winners came up with scintillating performances bettering the ten-year old previous mark. 

Antana accumulated 3,285 points, while Keralas Joseph sisters, Niksy (3218 pts) and Liksy (3211) settled for silver and bronze medals. The feats by these three eclipsed the old mark set by N. Mithili of South Zone (3042 pts) in New Delhi. 

Antana finished first in the 100m and high jump. Liksy, despite winning the last two events, had to settle for bronze. Niksy, on her part, came first in shot put throwing the iron to a distance of 8.32m while Antana and Niksy could not cross the eight metre mark. 

In the boys U-20 javelin final, Uttar Pradeshs Anuj Kumar achieved the meet record of 70.53m in his fifth try to erase the previous mark set by Ramandeep Singh of Punjab (69m) in Nagercoil in 1992. 

Maharasthras Don DSilva won the 2000m steeplechase in a record time of 6 mins 03.28. (PTI)

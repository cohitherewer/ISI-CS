 Indians share second spot

 - WORLD CUP of GOLF 

 Arjun Atwal in Vilamoura on Friday 

Vilamoura (Portugal): Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa were perfectly placed to give Indian golf another boost as they finished the opening day of the $ 4million World Cup of Golf in tied second place, just one shot off leaders England. 

Playing their first ever World Cup, the Indian pair shot 10 birdies and an eagle to card 12-under 60 and were tied second along with Australians Mark Hensby and Peter Lonard at the Arnold-Palmer designed Victoria Clube de Golfe in Villamoura, in the Algarve region. 

Englands Luke Donald and David Howell, last weeks winner in the HSBC Champions tournament in Shanghai, rallied in the second half to take a one-shot lead. 

Donald holed an eight-footer for a birdie on last to take sole lead after being tied with India and Australia. 

Wales and Sweden were sharing the fourth place with 61 each. 

The Indian pair began in a glorious manner with three birdies followed by two more to be five-under after six. 

Two pars and one more birdie meant the turn came in at six-under. 

There was more to come as the next four holes saw three birdies and an eagle and suddenly the Indian duo was contending for the lead at 11-under after 13 holes. 

Towards the end, however, they slowed down and managed only one birdie in last five holes, and were clubhouse leaders with Australia. (PTI)

Madrid: Villarreal strengthened their hold on a Champions League place after a convincing 3-1 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday moved them up to third in Primera Liga. They now have 50 points and a game in hand on second-placed Real Madrid, who are seven points ahead of them. 

Two goals from striker Jose Mari and a third from Uruguay striker Diego Forlan, his 18th of the season, were too much for Athletic, who had levelled the scores at 1-1 through striker Santi Ezquerro. 

Valencia missed out on the chance to move into the Champions League places despite staging a fightback from 0-2 down to earn a point against Real Zaragoza. 

Substitute Bernardo Corradi pounced on a defensive error to pull a goal back for the visitors in the 81st minute before defender Marco Caneira stroked home the leveller soon after. Caneira was later dismissed for a second yellow card. 

Zaragoza had taken the lead against the run of play when David Generelo scored with a 30m shot before the break. 

Valencia?s David Albelda headed Savio?s inswinging cross into his own net after 50 minutes but Zaragoza failed to build on their two-goal advantage. 

Two goals in three minutes from Gari Uranga and Valery Karpin all but guaranteed Real Sociedad?s Primera Liga survival as they swept aside struggling Osasuna 2-0. 

In the French Ligue 1, Matt Moussilou scored four goals, including a four-minute hattrick, as Lille reclaimed second place with an 8-0 thrashing of bottom club Istres on Saturday. 

Leaders Lyon satisfied themselves with a 1-0 home win against mid-table RC Lens. Brazilian midfielder Juninho scored the winner 10 minutes into the second half, blasting a shot into the corner of the net after a cross from Pierre-Alain Frau. 

Lyon extended their lead at the top to 13 points. They have 65 points from 31 matches with Lille on 52. Third-placed Olympique Marseille are a point further back. 

Lille ended a run of eight matches without a win in style, earning their first victory since they defeated Lyon 2-1 on January 23. 

Moussilou grabbed a remarkable hattrick between the 14th and 18th minutes with Mathieu Bodmer and Philippe Brunel making it 5-0 at halftime. 

Moussilou scored his fourth after 56 minutes, Brunel grabbed his second 10 minutes later and Brahim Thiam added to Istres? misery with an own goal. 

Monaco slipped to fourth after crashing 3-0 at lowly AC Ajaccio but still have a four-point advantage over AJ Auxerre and Toulouse. 

Auxerre came back from behind to defeat Nantes 2-1 and maintain their unbeaten home record. 

Nantes ended the game with nine men after defender Nicolas Savinaud was handed a second yellow card for a dangerous tackle on Philippe Violeau in the 85th minute before midfielder Emerse Fae received his marching orders in stoppage time. 

Toulouse won 1-0 at Metz thanks to a first-half goal from midfielder Francois Sirieix. 

In the English Premier League on Saturday, Chelsea maintained their charge towards a first title for 50 years as a deflected Frank Lampard free kick and two Eider Gudjohnsen goals gave them a 3-1 win at Southampton that took them to 80 points. (Reuters)

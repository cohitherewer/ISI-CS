 Super Series

London: Centuries from Brian Lara and Ramnaresh Sarwan on their return to the West Indies team against South Africa in Trinidad, have reinforced their case for inclusion in the Johnnie Walker ICC Super Series pool of 30 Test and ODI players to be announced next month. 

Former West Indies captain and one of the Super Series selectors Clive Lloyd said that the return of the pair, along with opener Chris Gayle and young allrounder Dwayne Bravo allowed the selectors to choose from the widest array of talent outside Australia. 

?As a selection panel it?s important to be able to pick from the best players in the game, so it?s good to see the West Indies resolving their contractual issues and allowing all players to be available for the national team,? Lloyd said. (PTI)

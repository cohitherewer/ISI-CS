 Jeev Milkha hangs on to second spot

Phuket: Jeev Milkha Singh hung in there in the second spot even as Australian Scott Barr kept up his bogey-free golf to remain in lead for the second day in-a-row in the $500,000 Thailand Open. 

Jeev, who bogeyed 11th and 13th, recovered with birdies on 14th and 18th to close in on Barr, leading at 11-under for two days. 

?I had a bad bogey on 11 with a poor bunker shot. I let it go in mid-round but I finished nicely,? said Singh. 

Indians had a lot to cheer as apart from Jeev, Shiv Kapur was tied fourth with a total of six-under and Harmeet Kahlon was tied sixth at five-under for two days. Kapur shot rounds of 70 and 68, while Kahlon shot 70 and 70. 

Gaurav Ghei, despite failing to build on his first round 71, made the cut that was drawn at three-over. He shot rounds of 71 and 76. 

Rahil Gangjee paid dearly for his last hole bogey and ended at four-over with rounds of 74 and 74. Amandeep Johl was out of sorts with a second round of five-over 77 after his first round 74. He missed the cut. 

The 32-year-old Singapore-based Barr produced another masterful performance, shooting a four-under-par 68 at the Blue Canyon country club to be at 11-under. 

Jeev stayed in touch with a second round 69 while the in-form Scott Strange of Australia was a further stroke back following a 67 where he recovered from two early bogeys.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I badly wanted to win: Sprem

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Seventh seed Karolina Sprem defeated Australian Evie Dominikovic 6-4, 7-5 in her opening singles match to reach the pre-quarter finals on Wednesday. 

After the match, she said, I am relieved to get through the first round. I have lost in the first rounds in the last five tournaments and wanted to win here very badly. Now that I have done it, I feel more confident. 

In the second set, Karolina lost concentration and fell back 2-5 before equalising 5-5 and going on to win. 

The Croatian said, I am happy to have been able to come back from down 2-5. 

2003-04 had been an excellent year for Karolina. Not so 2005. But she is putting more pressure on herself and hoping for a turnaround. 

For Karolina, Goran Ivanisevic has undoubtedly been a major influence. 

Hes a great player. He won Wimbledon on a wildcard when it was least expected. I was so happy for him.

 Alonso: We have to keep it up

London: Fernando Alonso has long been held up by Renault team boss Flavio Briatore as Michael Schumacher?s heir apparent as Formula One champion. 

In Bahrain on Sunday, the 23-year-old Spaniard, every bit as impressive on the track as he is unassuming off it, drove further down the road to greatness. 

It is still way too early to declare his second win in a row, and Renault?s third in three races, as the start of a new era after years of domination by Ferrari and seven-times champion Schumacher. 

With 19 races, the season is a marathon ? the longest yet ? and plenty can happen between now and the last round in China on October 16 to prevent Alonso adding the mantle of youngest champion to youngest race winner. 

Ferrari, constructors? champions since 1999, will want to remind their fans that in 1994 Schumacher won the first four races for Benetton but Williams still took the title. 

Renault might equally well point out that 1994 remains the only occasion, out of nine examples over the years, where a team winning the first three races has failed to take the championship. 

What is certain is that Renault have the best all-round package at the moment and Schumacher, in 14 years in Formula One, has never started a season this poorly. Alonso leads the championship with 26 points while Schumacher has two. Ferrari and tyre suppliers Bridgestone need to get their act together fast. They expect to do that. 

?They showed us that they have improved and that they will be able to fight for victories again,? said Alonso in Bahrain.?But at the moment we don?t have to be too worried. We won the first two races and, during the last two especially, Toyota was our main competitor.? 

The Spaniard made it clear that Renault will have to keep up their momentum. 

?The championship is very long. We started in the best way possible and we have to keep it up like this,? he said. ?For this race we had a bit of aerodynamic improvements and maybe that was the key to being competitive here again.? (Reuters)

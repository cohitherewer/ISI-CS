 Laxman, 

Harbhajan, 

Pathan out 

London: Four Indian cricketers, including Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were on Saturday named in the ICC World XI squads for the Super Series against Australia to be held in October. 

While Tendulkar, Sehwag and Rahul Dravid figured in both the one-day and Test squads of 20 players, leg spinner Anil Kumble has been included in the Test squad only. 

Its significant that the selectors have retained Sachin even though he is unlikely to be back in action before the end of September. The maestro, it may be recalled, underwent elbow surgery around six weeks back. 

The ICC World XI ODI team will play three matches against world champions Australia in Melbourne on October 5, 7 and 9. The ICC Test team will play a six-day super Test in Sydney from October 14 to 19. 

The Indians, who were included in the 30 Test probables list announced in May but failed to make the cut are: V.V.S. Laxman, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan. 

Harbhajan and Pathan also missed out on ODI XI berths, despite being named in the probables list for ODIs.

 PCB names bowlers 

Islamabad: PCB have named the three pacers who will be sent to the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai, to acquire world class skills under Australian great Dennis Lillee. 

The plan to send young fast bowlers to train at the academy would be limited to the period former Australian pace-bowling legend Lillee remains present there to supervise their training. 

Our information is that Lillee is available from June 26 to July 5. We plan to send our bowlers to the academy during this period only, a senior PCB official was quoted as saying by a daily. 

The PCB has recently confirmed that it intended to send three pace bowlers ? Mohammed Asif, Mohammad Irshad and Najaf Shah ? to train at the academy, where Lillee also makes regular visits to coach the bowlers.

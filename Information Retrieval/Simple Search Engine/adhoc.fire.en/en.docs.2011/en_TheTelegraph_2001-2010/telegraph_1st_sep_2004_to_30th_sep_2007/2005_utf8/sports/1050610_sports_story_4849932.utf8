 Narain vents ire over accusation

 - Indian driver says he didnt block Villeneuve 

Montreal: Narain Karthikeyan is so enraged with former world champion Jacques Villeneuve, who accused the Indian of blocking his way in the European Formula One Grand Prix, that he says he would not mind repeating his act in future if needed, media reports said here Thursday. 

Canadian Villeneuve had confronted Karthikeyan after the European Grand Prix, accusing Indias first F-1 driver of blocking him. 

Karthikeyan insisted he did nothing wrong. 

I didnt block ? maybe once on a straight ? but he thought differently. I was angry, the 28-year-old Jordan driver was quoted as saying by the local media. 

You dont expect him to (confront) like that. Well see. Im here to race and Ill do the same next time. 

Karthikeyan justified his tactics in the race where he finished 16th, three places behind the 1997 world champion Villeneuve, whose best performance this season was fourth at the San Marino Grand Prix. 

You need to race, especially if you have half a chance, the Indian said. 

Villeneuves car wasnt two seconds faster than mine. I thought I was doing the right thing and I still think so. 

Karthikeyan, however, suggested that he and Villeneuve should talk it over now. (PTI)

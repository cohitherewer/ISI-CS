Kandy: Chaminda Vaas hit back with four for 17 to leave West Indies on 92 for five in reply to Sri Lankas 150 all out at close on the first day of the second Test on Friday. 

Vaas shook off flu to claim the wickets of Xavier Marshall (4), Runako Morton (1), Shivnarine Chanderpaul (13) and Sylvester Joseph (18) either side of the tea interval. 

At close, the West Indies trailed by 58 runs with Narsingh Deonarine unbeaten on 36 and wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin batting on eight. 

Sri Lanka won the first Test in Colombo by six wickets. Jamaican fast bowler Daren Powell had starred for the tourists earlier on Friday, taking a career-best five for 25 as Sri Lanka were bowled out in just 46.1 overs, justifying his teams decision to bowl first on a dry, grassless pitch. 

Powell bowled two lively bursts either side of lunch and was well supported by Tino Best, the first change support seamer, who finished with three for 50 from 10 fiery overs. 

The only substantial resistance from the hosts came from Tillakaratne Dilshan (36) and Thilan Samaraweera (37) who fought back after their team had slumped to 42 for four. 

The fifth-wicket pair added 56 in 76 balls before Best grabbed back the initiative in the last over before lunch with an athletic chase-and-throw off his own bowling to run out Dilshan with a direct hit. 

In the first hour, opener Sanath Jayasuriya had survived an early scare when hit on the arm guard just above his gloves, but went soon after for two, when he was dubiously adjudged to have been caught behind off Powell.

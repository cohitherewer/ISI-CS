 Bengal open with draw

 - SANTOSH TROPHY

 Mascarenhas hattrick in Goas 7-0 win 

 Bengal scorers Dipendu Biswas and Syed Rahim Nabi 

Thiruvananthapuram: Bengal started their Santosh Trophy campaign with a 2-2 draw with Nagaland in cluster VIII on Saturday. 

The verdict will sure disappoint coach Aloke Mukherjee in that his side were in the lead twice, but on both occasions, failed to keep the momentum going. 

Bengal started aggressively and soon went ahead in the 12th minute through Dipendu Biswas. But as the match progressed towards the breather, Bengal defence was caught napping, allowing Tenjen to equalise for the north-east state with a minute to go for the first-half whistle. 

However, Syed Rahim Nabi ? who played as Diepndus partner upfront, instead of his right-back position in East Bengal ? restored the lead within seconds, giving finishing touch to a sharp offensive. 

Nagaland upped their tempo after the break and didnt allow Bengal to play their natural game. That made Bengal frustrated as they went after scoring too frequently. 

The loopholes at the back were not adequately attended to as Nagaland again spoiled Bengals party with Vizoru drawing the parity. 

The earlier match between Andhra Pradesh and Mizoram in the same cluster also saw a 2-2 truce. 

Meanwhile, K. Kulothungans brace helped Tamil Nadu overcome Gujarat 2-0 in a cluster VIII match. Kulathungan found the targets in the 44th and 66th minutes. 

In the other cluster matches played in Kozhikode, star-studded Goa thrashed Rajasthan 7-0. 

Freddy Mascarnhas scored a brilliant hattrick (36th, 59th, 78th) while Antony Perreira (26th), Climax Lawrence (52nd), Mahesh Gawli (60th) and Joaqim Abranjes (injury time) were the other scorers. 

Formiddable Karnataka, led by national captain S. Venkatesh, defeated Chandigarh 1-0. Venkatesh netted the all-important goal in the first half.

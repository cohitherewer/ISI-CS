Calcutta: Just over a fortnight ago, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tried his hand at tennis while inaugurating the WTA Sunfeast Open at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

On Wednesday evening, he took to a different sport: cricket. He first received an innocuous delivery from Team India captain Sourav Ganguly and then, enthusiastically, bowled one at him too. That double act marked the inauguration of the Videocon School of Cricket. 

The school will start operations on October 15. 

With the states two biggest names in action at Salt Lakes Central Park (adjacent to the international bus terminus), lensmen had a field day. They made sure chaos reigned supreme, forcing the chief minister to ask them on at least two occasions: Apni ki chan? 

The CM was patient enough to oblige them both times, posing with Sourav, whom he admires enormously. 

The glamour element to the hourlong function was provided by Bollywood starlets Celina Jaitley and Tanushree Dutta, neither of whom was on unfamiliar turf. 

Among past and present cricketers present were Pranab Roy, Moloy Banerjee, Arun Lal, Sambaran Banerjee, I.B. Roy, Sujan Mukherjee, Devang Gandhi, Satinder Singh, Joydeep Mukherjee, Sanjay Das and, of course, Souravs elder brother Snehasish. Also present was state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya. 

The CM thanked Sourav for agreeing to take responsibility in grooming young talents. We want cricket to become more popular. We want more players from the state to make it to the highest level, Bhattacharjee said. 

But one fine morning, a youngster cant become a cricketer. For that he needs good training and practice facilities. I know that because I wanted to become a cricketer but could not, the CM revealed. 

The academy will have 700 trainees and 20 coaches to start with. Ten of the coaches, all former Bengal players, have already been recruited. 

Sourav thanked the CM for taking the initiative and said he was happy such a school has come up in the city with world-class facilities. 

Whenever I get time, I will be here to help the youngsters along with the other coaches, Sourav promised. The trainees will be divided into three age groups ? 8-12 years, 13-16 and 17-19 ? with provision for special training to those who are found to be exceptionally talented. 

The academy will have a state-of-the-art gymnasium and several practice pitches. 

According to Snehasish, two-three coaches from the academy will be sent to Australia for training by December. We will also send one or two promising cricketers abroad every year, he said. 

Venugopal N. Dhoot, chairman, Videocon Group, termed this academy as the pride of Bengal. When the chief minister requested us to support this project, we thought it would be an ideal gift to the people of the state, Dhoot said.

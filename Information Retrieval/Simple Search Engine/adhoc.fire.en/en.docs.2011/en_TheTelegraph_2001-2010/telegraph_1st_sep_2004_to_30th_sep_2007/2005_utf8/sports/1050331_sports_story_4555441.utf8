 Karthik should have been retained: Patil

 Dinesh Karthik 

Mumbai: Former India A coach and Test cricketer Sandeep Patil hit out at the national selectors for not keeping faith in wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik for the one-day International series against Pakistan, commencing on April 2. 

?Karthik is a devastating one-day batsman and should have been retained for the ODIs too. He should have been an automatic choice,? Patil said here on Tuesday night. 

?I am not against Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who is a good ?keeper-batsman. But my point is Dinesh should have been given sufficient chances to come good and only if he had failed, the selectors should have opted for Dhoni,? the former dashing batsman told reporters at the Cricket Club of India. 

Patil was the coach for the India A team which visited Kenya and Zimbabwe last season and the squad included both Karthik, who did duty for India in the three-Test series against Pakistan, and Dhoni, who has replaced the former for the best-of-six limited over international series. 

Patil, who has taken up the job of guiding Oman into the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, is all set to take up his new assignment in the 12-team ICC Trophy meet in July. 

The eighth ICC Trophy will see 42 matches held at a record 25 venues across northern and southern Ireland, beginning on July 1 and concluding with the final at Clontarf on July 13.

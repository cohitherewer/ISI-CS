 Hari stays sole leader

Taiyuan: World junior champion P. Harikrishna continued with his top form to outsmart Grandmaster Luke McShane of England and remain in sole lead in the second Sanjin Hotel Cup Grandmasters chess tournament here. 

With his third win on the trot, Harikrishna remained half a point clear of nearest contender Tigran Petrosian of Armenia who accounted for tailender Woman Grandmaster Zhoa in the category-15 round-robin event. The Chinese duo of Wang Hao and Bu Xiangzhi are in joint third spot with two points each. 

Following them with 1.5 points is former Russian champion Alexander Motylev, who however has an extra game in hand. McShane and Wang Yue of China are also on 1.5 points, but from three games. 

In the game against Harikrishna, McShane, playing white, started with the Berlin defence. McShane obtained a superior position soon in the middle game with absolute control of light squares. 

It was time to work on the counter-active measures for Harikrishna, and he executed a fine plan to get some play in the centre. McShane could have forced a draw by repetition but the Englishman started pressing hard. Harikrishna was quite up to the task too. A flurry of exchanges led to an endgame wherein Harikrishnas skills yet again came to fore and he wrapped the issue in 80 moves. 

Petrosian defeated former world junior girls champion Xue, who did not know what hit her in the middle game arising out of a tarrasch defense. With a thematic exchange sacrifice, Petrosian gained a direct attack against the king and romped home in 44 moves. 

Wang Hao got the better of his higher-rated compatriot Zhang Zhong in a keenly contested game. Playing the black side of a relatively less played variation in the French defence, Hao capitalised on an endgame mistake to register victory in 49 moves.

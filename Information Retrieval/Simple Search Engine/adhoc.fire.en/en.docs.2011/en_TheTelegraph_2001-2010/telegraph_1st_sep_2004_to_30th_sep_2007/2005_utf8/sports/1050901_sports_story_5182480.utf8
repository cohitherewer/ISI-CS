The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Will century No. 35 be for World XI?

 - Super Series may mark Sachins big-stage comeback 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: With Sachin Tendulkar becoming incommunicado (till late on Wednesday, at least), it couldnt be confirmed whether the October 5-19 Super Series in Australia will mark his big-stage comeback. 

It should, though. 

Sachin is the World vice-captain for the three ODIs against Australia ? in Melbourne on October 5, 7 and 9 ? and is in the Graeme Smith-captained squad for the October 14-19 Super Test in Sydney. 

Assuming Sachin does head for Australia in a shade over a month, the possibility of a record-setting 35th Test century being scored for the World XI and not India is going to be talked about. 

Much as Sachin would prefer the attention to be low key, the limelight is bound to be on him if he does take guard at the hallowed SCG. He already has two Test centuries there. 

Significantly, Sachin scored an unbeaten 241 (his highest till the 248 not out in Dhaka last December) and an unbeaten 60 in his last Test appearance at the SCG ? January 2004. 

Sachin has gone through six innings since equalling Sunil Gavaskars record of 34 centuries. The closest he came to the 35th was 94 in his only innings in Mohali, versus Pakistan, in March. 

Despite knowing he would have to wait till September (and the two Tests in Zimbabwe) for another go, Sachin was far from impatient when The Telegraph spoke to him at the end of last season. 

Cricket isnt about records and life wont be different because I didnt get that century (in the series against Pakistan)? I tend to believe special things in life have their own timing. 

?Theres more to cricket and my life than a 35th Test century? Bottomline is I need to do the right thing at the right time. 

Obviously, for now, the right thing for Sachin was to extend his post-surgery lay-off. 

It has extended the wait for century No.35 as well.

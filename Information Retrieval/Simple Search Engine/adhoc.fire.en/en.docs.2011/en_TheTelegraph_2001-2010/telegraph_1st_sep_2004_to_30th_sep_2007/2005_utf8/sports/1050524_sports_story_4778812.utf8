Calcutta: The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) elections are over. The office bearers remain pretty much the same, it was learnt, but in between, Narinder Batra pushed the process into a redo when he claimed that some of the ballots had indicators pointing towards K.P.S. Gill, president. 

Sixty per cent of the ballots had been counted by then, in the first phase of the elections, when the process had to be redone. 

Other than Batra, Jammu and Kashmirs Jagjit Singh and Gurdeep Singh of Universities threw a challenge to the official panel resulting in elections for almost all the key posts. 

That didnt really change anything, but, as Batra later said: This was a victory for democracy. At least our voice is being heard in the IHF. We are doing all this for the players. 

He also said that the elections were free, fair and friendly. 

Those, incidentally, were also the words used by Gill, in the brief press conference that he held after the elections (the result of the elections cannot be disclosed till further instructions, as per a Delhi High Court order). He, too, said that he was happy that the elections were held fairly. He refused to comment on the Batra issue. 

He said the AGM had adopted a resolution amending the present constitution in a bid to ensure free and fair elections. 

This victory allows Gill a fourth term in office. 

The extent of Batras defeat is not known, but the winners lead, sources said, was big. 

For the eight posts for vice-presidency, there were nine candidates, for the eight executive committee members posts there were ten candidates, and for the three joint secretary posts there were five candidates. 

The sub-committees were also supposed to be formed the same day, but this court order intervening, it was decided that this business would be taken up at a later date. 

Thirty six of the 40 constituents were present at the elections. Absent were Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Services.

 Show against Australia crucial: Sunny

London: Powerful individual performances around the world has seen several players stake early claims for inclusion in the initial World XI squads for the ICC Super Series in Australia, according to Sunil Gavaskar, chairman of the selection panel. 

?Although the selectors will look at players? records over the past year, there?s no doubt that eye-catching and match-winning performances are bound to attract our attention before we meet as a panel for the first time,? Gavaskar said. 

?It?s important that all players outside Australia realise they are in contention for places in the ICC World XI Test and one-day squads that will be selected for these prestigious games. 

?Proven players like Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, Virender Sehwag, Inzamam-ul Haq and Younis Khan were outstanding in the recent Indo-Pak Test series. And so were emerging players like Danish Kaneria, Shahid Afridi, and Lakshimipathy Balaji,? Gavaskar was quoted as saying in an ICC release here. 

?One of the factors we?ll be looking at is how players have performed against Australia. So obviously individuals who caught the eye in the recent series between New Zealand and Australia like Hamish Marshall with his first Test century, Daniel Vettori, who bowled and batted well against them, and Nathan Astle with runs in the top order, will be pushing to stake a claim,? he added. 

The six-man selection panel of former greats headed by the ex-India captain includes Mike Atherton, Richard Hadlee, Clive Lloyd, Jonty Rhodes and Aravinda de Silva. (PTI)

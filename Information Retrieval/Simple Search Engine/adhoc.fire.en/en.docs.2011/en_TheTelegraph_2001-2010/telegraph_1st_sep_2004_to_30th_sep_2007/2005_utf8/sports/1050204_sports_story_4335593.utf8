 Pujara cracks double ton

 Manoj Tewari scored 109 off 151 balls 

Jamshedpur: Helped by opener Cheteshwar Pujara?s 211 and captain Manoj Tewari?s 109, India under-19s posted a mammoth 472 for four before restricting England under-19s to 189 for four at the close of the second day of the third and final ?Test? at the Keenan Stadium in Jamshedpur on Thursday. 

After the hosts declared their innings, the bowlers took charge of the proceedings and restricted England to 189 for four at close. Ben Harmison and Steven Mullaney were at the crease on 40 and three, respectively. The visitors need another 133 runs to avoid follow-on. 

Pujara, who was unbeaten on 162 the other day finished on 211 after facing 352 balls with 26 hits to the fence. Tewari, on the other hand, scored his 109 off 151 balls including 12 fours and a couple of sixes. Pujara and Tewari added 217 runs for the third wicket. 

England started well as openers Michael O?Shea and Joseph Denly shared 81 runs (100 balls) for the opening stand. The openers treated the new ball attack of Y. Mahesh and Harsh Gautam with respect. Denly, being the best of the lot, knew his responsibility and played to a plan. 

The youngster?s shot selection was perfect as he put his head down to give England a fair start. He got good support from O?Shea, who seemed more enterprising in strokeplay. Just when it seemed that the English openers have settled, leg-spinner Piyush Chawla evicted O?Shea with one that went straight off the arm. The batsman ultimately, succeeded in edging it to wicketkeeper Rahul Keni. 

O?Shea scored 46 (off 49 balls) with eight boundaries. Much was expected from skipper Steven Davies but was run out after scoring four. Denly, who in the meantime reached his 50 (86 balls, 5x4, 1x6), was ably assisted by Ben Harmison. 

The two went for the repair job and added valuable 74 runs for the fourth wicket. Denly and Harmison concentrated on the singles and didn?t try anything funny. 

But England got a major jolt when Denly was shown the door by Chawla in a soft dismissal. He played an early shot and ended up giving a straight forward catch to the bowlers after a well-made 81.

 Chingoka, Bvute released

Durban: Peter Chingoka and Ozias Bvute, the chairman and managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC), were released from police custody on Wednesday after being questioned about their foreign exchange dealings. 

We were released without charge and without restriction this morning, Bvute said from Harare. The pair had been arrested on Monday under the Exchange Control Act. 

A crisis meeting of Zimbabwe Cricket stakeholders, to discuss Chingokas position, was scheduled to resume in Harare at 12:15 GMT on Wednesday. 

Bvute, who along with Chingoka missed the first session of the meeting on Monday, said he would not attend. How can I attend meetings I havent been invited to? he said. I do have a bit of etiquette.

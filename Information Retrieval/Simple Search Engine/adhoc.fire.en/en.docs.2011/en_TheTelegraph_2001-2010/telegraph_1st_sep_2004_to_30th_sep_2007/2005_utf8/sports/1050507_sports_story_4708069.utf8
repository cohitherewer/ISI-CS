Barcelona: Sundays Spanish GP will not be the same without the excluded BAR team and Briton Jenson Button, according to Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. 

?Competition is always nice so its just a pity to see that the competition here will not be the one that could have been,? said the German on Thursday, without commenting on the circumstances of the BAR ban. 

McLaren test driver De la Rosa set the best morning time of 1:15.675 and was fastest again in the afternoon at 1:15.062 during free practice on Friday. Schumacher was fourth and 13th fastest, respectively. Narain Karthikeyan finished 17th in the afternoon. 

McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya crashed heavily. The Colombian clambered from his wrecked car after smashing into the tyre wall at turn nine at the end of the second session. 

Honda-powered BAR, cleared of cheating, were dealt a two-race suspension for a breach of regulations following a check of their cars fuel tank and weight at the last San Marino GP. 

Button set an unofficial lap record in testing at the circuit recently and BAR had fancied their chances in the fifth round of the season. 

Schumacher is chasing a record-equalling fifth Spanish win in a row. 

Another victory, his seventh at the Circuit de Catalunya, would equal the late Brazilian Ayrton Sennas run of five successive Monaco Grand Prix victories from 1989 to 1993. The German was more focused on soccer on Thursday, however. (REUTERS)

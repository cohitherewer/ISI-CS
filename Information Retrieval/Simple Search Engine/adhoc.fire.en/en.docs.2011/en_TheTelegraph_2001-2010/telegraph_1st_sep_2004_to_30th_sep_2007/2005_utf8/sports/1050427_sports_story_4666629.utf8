 Curtail backlift to keep out yorkers

 Avoid reverse sweep till you have enough experience

 I am a right-handed batsman and often fall prey to the yorker. Why does this happen?

 (Satrajit, 13, Calcutta-6; Diptanshu, 16, Patna; Deepayan Dutta, 13, Bardhaman)

 Watch the ball closely and curtail your backlift.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer and often change my action to suit my needs. Can it pose problems to my bowling?

 (Siddharth Maloo, 16, Howrah)

 Yes it can. Do that every now and then as a variation. Even then, it?s better to get the variations going with a similar action.

 I am a right-handed batsman. When it comes to hitting, I am comfortable on the on-side and straight over the bowler, but I find it difficult to hit on the off-side. Why does this happen?

 (Anirban Banerjee, 15, Calcutta-91)

 It?s good to be hitting straight. You can develop the shot over mid-off at practice. Picking the right line is important.

 I am a right-handed batsman and would like to know the right way to play the reverse sweep. Also please advise on the selection of ball for executing the stroke.

 (Ronit Das, 17, Calcutta-89)

 Demands a lot of practice. Not advised till you have the necessary experience.

 What is the difference between a googly and a top-spinner?

 (Ahesh Kanta Sahoo, 19, Howrah)

 Googly comes out of the back of the hand and spins back in to the right-hander. The top-spinner goes straight through and bounces a little bit more after pitching.

 I am a right-handed batsman and would like to know the secret behind batting well under pressure. Also, how can one get mentally stronger?

 (Santosh Mandal, 17, Birbhum)

 Have the self-belief that you can do it, whatever the circumstances. Also be careful with your shot selection in a tight situation.

 While attempting the cut, I try to keep the ball down but often end up giving a catch to gully. Please help.

 (Shreyas Grover, 14, Calcutta-34)

 Make sure you roll your wrists at the time of contact so that the face of the bat points to the ground and sends the ball in that direction. Also don?t close the face of the bat too early.

 What is the right way to play the cover drive. What should be the position of the feet?

 (Anshu Sharma, 16, Kharagpur)

 The feet should point in the direction of cover when playing the shot and the ball should ideally be just outside off stump.

 I am a right-handed batsman and very weak on the leg side against leg-spinners. Please help.

 (Devdutta Pathak, 17, Midnapore)?

 Get your feet in the right position and also check your grip.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. When striving for pace, I often end up bowling wide. Please help.

 (Kausheek Dutta, 13, Guwahati)

 Your head obviously falls away at the time of delivery and hence pushes the ball wide.

 Sehwag angry despite victory

Mumbai: Discarded India Test wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik stroked his way to a superb unbeaten 98 even as Tamil Nadu were poised to concede a huge first innings lead to Mumbai on the second day of their Ranji Trophy Elite A match on Monday. 

Karthik, ignored for the upcoming tour of Pakistan, struck form with the bat for the first time in the season to help the visitors end the day at 208 for eight. 

Meanwhile, despite Delhis seven-wicket win against defending champions Railways, captain Virender Sehwag blasted the track at Karnail Singh Stadium, saying It is not a good track. This is an unprepared pitch. I will be sending my report to the BCCI. Earlier, Railways Murali Kartik added three more scalps to return with a Ranji best of eight for 40.

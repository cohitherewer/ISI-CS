 Defiant Smith sets up SA win

Port Elizabeth: A full year after they last beat recognised opposition, South Africa finally put an end to their one-day drought Friday with a three-wicket win.It was fitting that Graeme Smith, a captain who has taken a barrage of criticism in recent weeks, should have set his side up with a defiant maiden hundred (as reported in Saturday?s Late City edition). 

On the notoriously paceless Port Elizabeth pitch, it was a mighty effort to chase down a target of 268 ? especially in view of the selection controversies that have afflicted the team. The previous record for a successful chase under the St George?s Park lights was just 232. 

But Smith is not easily put off. This is the man who initiated contact with Minki van der Westhuizen, his swimsuit-model girlfriend, by telephoning one of the magazines she appeared in and demanding to be given her number. 

Friday was the first time Smith had reached three figures on the whole tour ? a welcome release of tension for a player who has suffered badly at the hands of Matthew Hoggard. There was a rumour that the selectors had wanted Smith to drop down to No. 5 in this series, to strengthen the middle-order and to let A.B. de Villiers into the side. 

But Smith supposedly refused, because he did not want it to look as if he was shying away from his running battle with Hoggard. Smith started boldly Friday but became increasingly scratchy in the middle of his innings. He should have been dismissed twice in the fifties, firstly when Marcus Trescothick put down a simple lobbed catch, and secondly when Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones somehow contrived to mess up a clear-cut run-out chance. 

The key moment came soon after, when Hoggard returned for one over and Smith drove, cut and pulled him for three boundaries. You could feel the momentum swing as Smith took on his nemesis and faced him down. 

Just as in Wednesday?s tie, a late clatter of wickets brought a feeling of desperation to South Africa?s lower-order. But this time they clung on, bringing up the win via a boundary from the dogged Ashwell Prince. 

Mark Boucher hit the ball better than anyone at the death. It may have helped that the umpires changed the ball at the end of the 44th over, apparently giving him a harder object to swing at. 

Once again Boucher could not see out the chase, falling leg before to Darren Gough with two overs to go. But his 33 from 21 balls bought time for his teammates, who were able to nudge the ball around in those final stages. 

England went into the game without their captain, Michael Vaughan, and came out without a win. But they are still playing some solid cricket. Although their highest score Friday was only 66 from Vikram Solanki, who replaced the flu-stricken Vaughan, consistent batting down the order brought them an above par total of 267. 

Known for his coruscating strokeplay, Solanki was unusually circumspect Friday on a pitch which rarely lends itself to big shots. His flashing wrists did make an appearance on a couple of lofted drives but mostly this was a mature innings of accumulation. 

Solanki has left England with a difficult decision to make for Sunday?s match at Cape Town. His last two innings have now been 66 here and 100 in Bulawayo two months ago, which should be good enough to keep his place intact. 

The man to drop out will probably be Ian Bell. Coming in with six overs to go Friday, and five in Bloemfontein, Bell has been little more than an extra on the England scene. He was still muttering when he reached the gate Friday, having miscued a full-toss. 

Vaughan is pretty sure to be fit for Sunday?s game in Cape Town, and Steve Harmison is also available.

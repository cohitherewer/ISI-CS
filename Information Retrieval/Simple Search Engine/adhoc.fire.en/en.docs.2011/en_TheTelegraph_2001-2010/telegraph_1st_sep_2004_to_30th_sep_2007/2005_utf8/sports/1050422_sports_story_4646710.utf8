 Chanderpaul, Lara in rescue act

Bridgetown: Brian Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul rescued West Indies from the loss of three early wickets as they reached 60 for three at lunch on the opening day of the third Test against South Africa on Thursday. 

The experienced lefthanders, both unbeaten on 23 at the interval, dug in after South Africa fast bowlers Andre Nel and Makhaya Ntini had reduced the hosts, who won the toss, to 12 for three. 

Nel struck with the fifth ball of the match when lefthander Chris Gayle edged an angled delivery to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher for a duck. 

Wavell Hinds, on one, pushed forward more decisively at a delivery from Ntini five overs later, only to steer it to Graeme Smith at first slip. 

Ramnaresh Sarwan seemed to settle early, driving Ntini sweetly off the back foot through the covers for four but he fell for 10 when he cut loosely at a wide delivery from Nel and sent a looping catch to Ashwell Prince at point.

Sydney: Michael Clarke scored an unbeaten century to guide Australia to a nine-wicket win over Pakistan in their one-day International at the Sydney Cricket Ground Sunday. 

Clarke hit the winning runs with a boundary in the 37th over to finish 103 not out as Australia raced past Pakistan?s dismal total of 163. 

Inzamam-ul-Haq top-scored for Pakistan with 50 and Shahid Afridi chipped in with 48, but no-one else made 20 as the world champions bowled and fielded superbly. 

Australia, unbeaten in the tri-series after four matches, made light work of their run chase even though their innings was disrupted by rain. 

Clarke, promoted to open the batting after Adam Gilchrist was rested, smashed 14 fours and a six in a freewheeling innings that lasted just 107 balls, though he almost made a mess of achieving his century. 

He had a let-off on 85 when Shoaib Malik appeared to have taken a clean catch at cover but referred the matter to the third umpire who gave Clarke the benefit of the doubt. 

He got another lucky escape on 97 when Mohammed Hafeez dropped a straight-forward catch at long-on. 

Australian captain Ricky Ponting also helped, by blocking the ball and refusing to take runs as the target drew closer. ?That was some dreadful batting there by myself so I have to thank Ricky,? a relieved Clarke said. ?I don?t know what I was thinking.? 

The start of the match was delayed by almost an hour but still finished early after Pakistans innings came to a halt in the 40th over. 

Left-arm spinner Darren Lehmann captured three wickets to mop up the tail after Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee ripped through the top-order. 

McGrath trapped Salman Butt lbw for a duck in the third over then bowled Shoaib Malik for eight, while Lee shattered Kamran Akmal?s stumps when the opener was on two. 

Inzamam steadied the innings with a half century off 61 balls but could not prevent the wickets from tumbling. 

Afridi struck three sixes and three boundaries in his attempt to save the innings but ran out of partners and was stumped by Brad Haddin.

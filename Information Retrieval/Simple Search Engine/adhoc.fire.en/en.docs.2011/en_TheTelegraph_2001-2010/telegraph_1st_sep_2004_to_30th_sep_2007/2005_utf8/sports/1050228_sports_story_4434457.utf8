Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Rana Naved-ul Hasan hopes that the tour of India will help him mature as a cricketer besides assisting him in cementing his place in the Test team. 

?It will be a big tour for me and I am eagerly looking forward to it. I am confident that this tour will help me mature as a cricketer and I will be able to permanently cement my place as a genuine fast bowler in the Test team,? the 27-year-old said from Lahore as Pakistan prepared to leave for India on their first tour in six years. 

Naved burst into international scene with his one-day debut against Sri Lanka in Sharjah immediately after the World Cup when Pakistan dropped eight players after the first round exit. 

He has also played two Tests but more importantly has been given a lead role in the absence of fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar who is down with hamstring injury. 

?India will be a great learning place because I will be playing against the best from whom I have an excellent opportunity to learn. The wickets will make me think and push me to keep trying something different,? Naved, who has taken 33 wickets in 22 one-day Internationals said. 

?I can say that the wickets will have low bounce and they will be slow. It will be a different experience because I will be coming after bowling in bouncy and quicker Australian tracks.? 

?In Australia, I wished I would get Brian Lara and my dream came true. Now I am praying to get a few top Indian batsmen?s wickets, including Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar,? Naved said. 

?Rahul is my favourite batsmen while Sachin is a great batsman. It would be a personal satisfaction if I manage to get their wickets.? 

The Sheikhupura-born Naved, respected in Pakistan cricket circles because of his commitment and dedication, said he was delighted to be bestowed with the responsibility of sharing the new ball in India. 

?Shoaib Akhtar?s loss has been my gain and I am delighted with the prospects of sharing the new ball in India. Opening the bowling for Pakistan means a lot of responsibility on my shoulders besides the honour of being bracketed in history with legends like Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Sarfraz Nawaz who have opened the Pakistan attack with the new cherry.

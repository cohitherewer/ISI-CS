Mutare: Team Indias dented reputation suffered a further blow on Thursday after an unbeaten 163 by Dion Ebrahim allowed a Zimbabwe Board XI to gain the upper hand on the first day of their tour match. 

India, whose six-wicket defeat by New Zealand on Tuesday meant they had lost 16 out of 21 one-day finals since March 1999, failed to stop the hosts from scoring 265 for seven in the three-day contest. 

Having amassed just 10 runs in his four innings during the two-Test series against New Zealand last month, Ebrahim enjoyed a return to form and struck 28 fours and a six. 

Fast bowler Zaheer Khan and spinner Anil Kumble (three for 42) had earlier reduced the Zimbabwe Board XI to 91 for six but the visitors failed to maintain the momentum. 

Ebrahim first bailed the hosts out of that tight spot with a 94-run sixth wicket stand with Sean Williams who made only 10. Then, Ebrahim and Keith Dabengwa (40 not out) added an unbeaten 80 for the eighth wicket. 

Ebrahims innings included 251 balls and 28 boundaries and a six. The diminutive batsman walked in at 16 for two. 

There was a bit of tomfoolery in the match as 12 players represented the Indian side and the hosts fielded 13. It, thus, reduced the match to the status of a warm-up tie. 

Indian medium-pacers were frustrated by the slowness of the track and Zaheer, came in for some harsh treatment giving away 107 runs in 20 overs before picking two top-order wickets. 

He along with Lakshmipathy Balaji got the bulk of the days overs, but Kumble was the pick of the bowlers . 

Zimbabwe coach Kevin Curran, who watched the proceedings from the sidelines, gave a thumbs up to Ebrahim and said an in-form batsman would be always be in the reckoning for a berth in the Test XI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Greg Chappell wants his presentation to do talking

 - I dont wish to run a campaign... through the Media 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: During his playing days, Greg Chappell 

 never consciously worked towards getting noticed: His bat 

 did the talking and, consequently, the arc lights never 

 quite left him. 

 Over two decades after bidding cricket farewell (with 

 7,110 Test runs, including a century on debut and in his 

 last game), the former Australian captain wants his coaching-specific 

 presentation to now do the talking. 

Thats going to be placed before the Boards specially constituted six-member selection committee. 

 ?I dont wish to run a campaign 

 for the Indian coachs job through the Media? I hope 

 you will appreciate my sentiments,? Chappell told The Telegraph 

 on Tuesday evening. 

One of four shortlisted for an interview, Chappell received the Boards formal invitation (by e-mail) earlier in the day. 

?Ive been honoured by this call? Beyond that, though, I wouldnt like to say anything,? he maintained, when contacted on his cellphone. 

The invitation hasnt specified the interview date, but Chappell can (if required) make it to India at short notice. 

The maestro, it may be recalled, first heard about his shortlisting from this newspaper. 

 As of now, Mohinder Amarnath, Sandeep Patil and Tom 

 Moody are the others whom the committee is going to interview. 

 Chappell hasnt coached a national team, but 

 handled South Australia for five years. Also, some 12 months 

 ago, Pakistan took him on board as a general consultant. 

 Should Chappell be John Wrights successor, a 

 face-off with Pakistan will come very early in his India 

 innings.

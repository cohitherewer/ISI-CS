 Pak propose early start 

Karachi: Pakistan have proposed early starts to the Tests and one-dayers against India to help deal with the winter weather and short days. 

The weather is a problem. But we have to deal with it because this is the only time we can hold our international home season, a PCB official said on Monday. 

Pakistan have proposed the Tests start half an hour to 15 minutes earlier than the normal time of 10 am so that six hours of playing time and minimum 90 overs are possible. (Reuters)

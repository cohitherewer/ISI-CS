 Tania slips

Istanbul: Woman Grandmaster Tania Sachdev split a point with Alina Motoc of Romania and slipped to joint second spot after the fourth round of the World Junior Chess Championship here. 

Playing her second black on the trot, Tania had little difficulty in holding Motoc in the Nimzo Indian Defence game. 

Tania, with 3.5 points in her kitty, shared the second spot with Motoc. 

In the boys championship, favourite Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan shot into sole lead with a thumping victory over Kirill Kuderinov of Kazakstan.

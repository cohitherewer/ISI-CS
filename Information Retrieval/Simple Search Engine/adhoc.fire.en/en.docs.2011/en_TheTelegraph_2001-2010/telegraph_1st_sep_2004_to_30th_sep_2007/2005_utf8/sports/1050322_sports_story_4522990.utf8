The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dravid climbs to the top 

London: India vice-captain Rahul Dravid?s twin centuries against Pakistan in the Calcutta Test have moved him to the top of the LG ICC Test rankings. 

Dravid, who made 109 and 135 in the two innings of the match which India won Sunday, reclaimed the position of leading Test batsman from South African Jacques Kallis. 

Dravid now has 892 points, the highest of his career, compared to Kallis on 886, ICC said in a release Monday. 

Anil Kumble?s success in the match, in which he took 10 wickets, has moved him up a place into fourth on the Test bowler rankings, moving ahead of the injured Pakistan pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar. 

Inzamam-ul Haq was the highest-rated Pakistan batsman at 14th, while Danish Kaneria held on to 13th spot. (PTI)

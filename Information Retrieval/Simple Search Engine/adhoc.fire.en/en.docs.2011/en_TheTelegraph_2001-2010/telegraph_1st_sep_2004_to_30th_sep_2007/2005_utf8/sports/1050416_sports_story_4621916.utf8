 Jerusalem: Brazilian superstar Ronaldo has joined the ranks of celebrities working to bring about peace in the west Asia.

 Ronaldo will visit the region early next month to participate in a Peres Centre for Peace sponsored project that brings around 800 Israeli and Palestinian children from low economic status to participate in an educational programme that promotes peace and co-operation through sports, a media report said on Friday.

 Portuguese soccer coach Jose Mourinho, who has led British club Chelsea to the Champions League semi-finals, also agreed to serve as a special envoy for the centre during a recent visit. 

 Athens: Champions Panathinaikos have been ordered to play their last two home games of the season behind closed doors by the Greek Football Federation following crowd trouble at last Sunday?s derby with Olympiakos Piraeus.

 League leaders Panathinaikos were also fined 40,000 euros ($51,340) after fans broke seats, set off firecrackers, Molotov cocktails and smoke bombs and attacked police before and during the match. 

 Madrid: Espanyol coach Miguel Angel Lotina says Spain boss Luis Aragones should have resigned after making racist comments about France striker Thierry Henry last year.

 ?Luis made a mistake and his remarks had major repercussions both within Spain and in Europe,? Lotina was quoted as saying in the Spanish media on Friday. ?That?s why I think it would have been right for him to resign.?

 Aragones was fined 3,000 euros ($3,851) by the Spanish Football Federation after referring to Henry as ?that black shit?.

 Oakland: Serena Williams is expected to recover from an ankle injury to join Lindsay Davenport in the singles when the US take on Belgium in the Fed Cup quarter finals later this month.

 Doubles player Corina Morariu and Venus Williams complete the line-up for the tie on April 23 and 24 in Delray Beach in Florida.

 US captain Zina Garrison said, ?Lindsay and Serena are my singles players,? adding that Davenport and Morariu were due to play the doubles.?Venus agreed to come, but knows she might not be playing. She?s a team player.?

 Belgium will be without top players Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin-Hardenne. Their team will consist of Ells Callens, Kirsten Flipkens and Leslie Butkiewicz and Evelyne Van Hyfte. 

 Madrid: Spanish cyclist Efrain Gutierrez was recovering in hospital on Friday after suffering serious injuries following an accident during the Tour of Aragon.

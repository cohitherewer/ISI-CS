 Olonga to join anti-tour move

 Olonga will campaign for the Green Party 

Wellington: Zimbabwes first black Test cricketer, Henry Olonga, is to join a campaign here aimed at stopping New Zealands cricket tour of his homeland, Green Party co-leader Rod Donald said on Sunday. 

Olonga fled Zimbabwe in 2003 after wearing a black armband during a World Cup match to mourn what he called the death of democracy in his country. 

Donald said he would take Olonga on a speaking tour to turn up the heat on the government. 

We want Henry to give the government, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) and the people, the message loud and clear that the Black Caps should not be touring Zimbabwe, he said. 

The government should be doing everything in its power to get the Black Caps off the hook, and needs to match its tough talk with decisive action. 

The governments position is that it does not want the team to tour, but will not stop it because that would need legislation authorising the removal of passports. 

Foreign minister Phil Goff last week announced a diplomatic offensive against all sporting contacts with Zimbabwe, and is urging the International Cricket Council to waive financial penalties that would be imposed if the tour does not go ahead. 

Goff has said the government will refuse to issue visas to the Zimbabwe team for a return tour to New Zealand scheduled in December. 

NZCs chief executive Martin Snedden said his association has no alternative but to go on tour or face crippling fines, believed to be at least $ 2 million. 

Donald drafted a bill that would allow the government to stop the tour, but it has been vetoed on the grounds that it would cut across New Zealands human rights laws. 

We hope Henrys visit will lead to public pressure increasing on the government to stop the tour, he said. 

The Greens are bringing Olonga to New Zealand, and he will speak at public meetings in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland this week.

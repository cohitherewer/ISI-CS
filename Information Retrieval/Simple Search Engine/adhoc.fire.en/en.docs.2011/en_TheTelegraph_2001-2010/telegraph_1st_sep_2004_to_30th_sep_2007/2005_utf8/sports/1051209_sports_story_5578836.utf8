 Schedule change draws coaches ire

Chennai: The change in schedule just a few days before the Champions Trophy hockey meet here has drawn sharp criticism from the coaches. 

To suit live telecast of matches by Doordarshan, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) made a few changes to the schedule on Wednesday. Accordingly, matches involving India would now start at 6.30 pm instead of 8 pm. 

Also, the main attraction at the league stage ? clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan ? has been advanced to December 11 from December 14. 

This is nothing short of a joke, I cannot still believe something like this has actually happened, German coach Bernhard Peters said after getting to know that his side will now play Olympic gold medallists Australia instead of defending champions Spain in the opening match. 

Now, Spain will meet hosts India in their opening game. 

Spanish coach Maurits Hendricks said FIH has no respect for players. 

We had spent months training and preparing for our first two matches as per original schedule. We agreed to play a practice match with India on Thursday because we were to take them on only at the end of the tournament. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Mohammad Saqlain has been allowed to play in all the matches of the meet in view of an appeal by the PHF to the jury of appeal of the FIH.

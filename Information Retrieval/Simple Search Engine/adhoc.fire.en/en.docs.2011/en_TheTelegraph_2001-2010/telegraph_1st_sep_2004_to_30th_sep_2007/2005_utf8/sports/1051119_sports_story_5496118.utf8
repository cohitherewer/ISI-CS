The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shabbir unlikely to play

Faisalabad: Bob Woolmer believes his side has an even chance in the second Test against England beginning Sunday. 

Both teams start at 50-50 chance. Every new Test is like an unwritten script. The book is new and as soon as it is opened it is the individuals who start writing the script, Woolmer said. 

Pakistan won the first Test in Multan by 22 runs and Woolmer said for much of the Test it was improbable that Pakistan would win. 

Woolmer admitted that bowlers Shabbir Ahmed and Shoaib Malik being reported for their action after the first Test had affected preparations for the second Test. 

It affects in the sense that it puts a cloud over Shabbir. Certainly in Shoaibs case it is not that serious. 

The two bowlers were reported by umpires Billy Bowden and Simon Taufel to Match Referee Roshan Mahanama. 

Inzamam-ul Haq, meanwhile, has said Shabbir is unlikely to play in the second Test. Shabbir bowled well in the first Test but after his suspect bowling action, its difficult for us to give him a chance, the Pakistan captain said. 

Definitely it disturbs the balance of the winning side, Inzamam said. They have objected on two to three deliveries of Malik, but its not dangerous like Shabbirs action, Inzamam said. 

Inzamam said if they opt to rest Shabbir, Rana Naved-ul Hasan has a chance of making it to the team. 

Woolmer said that having another seamer join the team before the second Test had also been discussed after the ICC report. 

Kaneria ploy 

Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria went back to the drawing board to plot Englands downfall in the first Test. Kaneria took four wickets in Englands second innings score of 175 to pilot Pakistan to an improbable win. 

In Multan after the first innings when I got just one wicket I went back to the basics, he said. I viewed a lot of footage of their batsmen to find out where I had gone wrong. It helped a lot second time around. (Agencies)

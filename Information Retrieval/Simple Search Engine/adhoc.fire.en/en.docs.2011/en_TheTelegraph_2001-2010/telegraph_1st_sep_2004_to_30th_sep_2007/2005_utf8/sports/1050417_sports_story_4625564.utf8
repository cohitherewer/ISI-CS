 Ferguson deserves better, despite the deficiencies

PAUL HAYWARD

This week?s heated chit-chat about Sir Alex Ferguson?s ability to go ?on and on? like Margaret Thatcher has given vent to some seriously warped opinions. The best justification for summoning the guillotine is the suggestion that Fergie would already be out on his ear at an Italian or Spanish club. 

From the hustings a cry of ?one more term!? is heard. The candidate is a great statesman beset by turbulence. Goals are down, blood pressure is up. 

But the dynamics of power are universal. No empire is eternal. Trophies and medals are made of metal. So is the dagger that ends it all. 

At Carrow Road, Ferguson blanks even the club?s own TV channel, MUTV. In Prada, probably, Ferdinand ?bumps into? Peter Kenyon, the Chelsea chief executive, at a London restaurant where black and white Hollywood photos are the favoured, and appropriate, decor. If you join the dots one way, the word ?crisis? starts to form on the page. 

The expulsion of the press from the club?s training ground provided another few spots of ink. As the ultimate justification for the debate, we have the United chief executive, David Gill, conceding live on radio that United?s most successful manager is ?sackable?. Certainly Ferguson has left himself open to cross-examination this year: the 4-5-1 formation, the Champions League demise, the shortage of goals, Rooney being played out of position and the failure by many recent acquisitions to reach the high standards demanded at Old Trafford (Tim Howard, Roy Carroll, David Bellion, Louis Saha, Kleberson, Eric Djemba-Djemba and the like). 

Old glories are no defence against valid criticism. But the mind recoils when the mob overturns the table of sensible analysis. The deficiencies are not hard to spot. They need an A-list goalkeeper. They need fresh impetus in midfield. They need to start scoring again. For United to have struck 25 fewer goals than Arsenal and 14 fewer than Chelsea is baffling, given the potential potency of Rooney, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Alan Smith and Saha. 

United have ceased to look like Manchester United recently, and it?s a decent bet that the old swashbuckling, expressive spirit will be restored for next season?s campaign. Chess is not the club?s natural game. But Ferguson deserves better than to be tossed the scrap of ?one more year.? From some of the grumbling, you would think his men were grappling with City for 11th place. The Daily Telegraph

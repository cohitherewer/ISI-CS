 Atwal makes cut

Reno (Nevada): Arj-un Atwal fired in two late birdies over the last five holes to make his 13th cut of the season at the end of the second round of the $3 million Reno-Tahoe Open at the Montreux Golf and Country Club. 

Barring last weeks PGA Championships, Atwal has made the cut in each of his tournament starts. 

Atwal, who started the day at two-over after a first round 74, had four birdies and two bogeys as he moved from tied 76th to tied 67th. 

The Asian Tour No. 1 began the day on the third hole and birdied it. He, however, bogeyed the fifth and turned at even par. 

On the back nine, he birdied the 11th, but bogeyed the next hole. He then birdied the par-4 14th and the par-3 10th to come out two-under for the day and even par. 

That cut was set at even par. Daniel Chopra, however, missed the cut with a two-over 74 after a first-day six-over 78. 

Defending champion Vaug-hn Taylor shot a 67 to stay in the lead with a meet record 13-under par 131 for 36 holes. 

Bill Glasson, with two eagles, shot a course record 10-under 62. Todd Fischer birdied his first five holes for a 67 and was in second place at 12-under. (PTI)

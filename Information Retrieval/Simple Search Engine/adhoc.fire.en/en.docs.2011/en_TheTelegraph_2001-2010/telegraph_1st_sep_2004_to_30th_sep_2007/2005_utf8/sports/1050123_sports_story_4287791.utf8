 New York: World No. 1 Vijai Singh topped the list of 33 golfers nominated for entry into the World Golf Hall of Fame on Friday.

 Last year, the Fijian produced one of the finest seasons in golf history, claiming nine events, over $10 million in prize money and the top ranking from Tiger Woods.

 He has carried over his form into the current campaign, winning the Sony Open in Honolulu last weekend to take his career tour wins tally to 25, including the 2000 US Masters and US PGA Championship in 1998 and 2004. Also included on the ballot are Americans Davis Love III, the 1997 PGA champion, Fred Couples, Lee Janzen and Mark O?Meara.

 International players on the ballot include European Ryder Cup hero Colin Montgomerie, Ian Woosnam, Sandy Lyle and Japans Ayako Okamoto also appear on the ballot. 

 Rio de Janerio: Veteran star Romario has signed a three-month contract with Vasco da Gama, returning to the club where his professional career started and is likely to finish. Romario, who will be 39 next month, was without a team since Vasco rival Fluminense abruptly ended the striker?s contract last October.

 He had been practising with the Rio de Janeiro club this week, but finalised the deal on Friday, Vasco said on its website.

 Local media reported the striker was expected to retire after the Rio de Janeiro state championship, a three-month-long competition. 

 Madrid: Atletico Madrid have released Serbian striker Veljko Paunovic from his contract, the club announced on Saturday.

 Paunovic, whose deal with Atletico was due to expire in 2006, has struggled to make the first team this season. Sports newspaper Marca said the player, signed in 1997, had received offers from several German clubs.

 Atletico lie mid-table in Spain?s Primera Liga, 19 points adrift of leaders Barcelona.

 New York: The US Soccer Federation (USSF) reached an agreement with the players? union of the national team on Friday, ending a threat by senior squad members to boycott next month?s World Cup qualifiers.

 Without a contract since December 2002 and demanding increase appearance fees and bonuses, US men?s national team players association (USMNTPA) accepted a 38 per cent pay increase in exchange for a no-strike, no lockout provision through to the end of this year.

 ?We?re very pleased the union has accepted our latest proposal and given us the assurance that there will be no strikes for any US soccer activity through the duration of the year,? US Soccer president Dr S. Robert Contiguglia said in statement. 

 ?This certainty allows us to confidently begin calling players into camp and to continue preparing for our participation in the final round of World Cup qualifying play. This is a clear win for both the fans and the sport of soccer in the US.?

 The 11th-hour agreement avoids a potential World Cup disaster for the US, who open the final round of CONCACAF regional qualification away to Trinidad and Tobago on February 9. 

 Houston: Roger Clemens put off retirement for at least another year on Friday, although this time he did not come cheap.

 Clemens signed a one-year, $18 million contract with his hometown Houston Astros, making him the highest-paid pitcher in baseball history. He said he still plans to go on his annual two-week desert vacation, except that now nonstop golf will be replaced by gruelling twice-a-day workout sessions.

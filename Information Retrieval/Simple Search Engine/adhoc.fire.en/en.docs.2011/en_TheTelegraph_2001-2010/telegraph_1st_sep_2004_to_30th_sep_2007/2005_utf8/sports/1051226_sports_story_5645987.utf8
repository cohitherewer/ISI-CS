Calcutta: Asian under-12 girls champion, Padmini Routs dream run ended on Sunday as she went down to Hemant Sharma of Delhi the sixth round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Alekhine Chess Club in Gorky Sadan. 

Padmini decided to go for a kingside attack but Hemant launched a swift counter-attack on the queenside, which proved decisive. With the win Hemant emerged as the joint leader with city boy Satyajit Kundu of Vivekananda Mission School with 6 points each. 

This 11 round Swiss League tournament is being presented by Linc and Bata being the co-sponsor. 

City-based Satyajit Kundu capitalised on the end-game slip-up of Rama Kumari of Jharkhand whose inaccurate handling of the rook and pawn versus rook and pawn ending proved catastrophic for her. Satyajit now meets Hemant Sharma in the next round, which is likely to throw up a sole leader. Closely following them are Bitan Banerjee of Baruipur HS and Avi Bagdi tied second with 5.5 points each. 

British U-14 champion, Ankush Khandelwal paid a heavy price for his optimism, trying desperately, to win a drawn endgame by a suicidal piece sacrifice against Avi Bagdi of Madhya Pradesh. 

Bitan however had little difficulty in getting the better of Arghyadip Das of Kendriya Vidyalaya in a Slav defence. Bitans two bishops and active development of his pieces ensured a win for him. 

Antarip Roy of St. Pauls Mission School and Abhratanu Dutta of St James School agreed to a quick draw in a French defence in 23 moves. Second seed, Debatiya Sinha Biswas of Salt Lake Point School checkmated Swarup Dey Sarkar of Nava Nalanda in 62 moves in a Queens pawn game.

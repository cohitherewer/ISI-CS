 PCA hearing on Sept. 29

Chandigarh: The Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) on Monday summoned Harbhajan Singh for a hearing on Thursday following the off-spinners outburst against coach Greg Chappell. 

Harbhajan rang me up after this thing came in the media. We have asked him to come and meet us to give his version of what has been coming in the media, PCA secretary M P Pandove said. 

He said Harbhajan had been called on Thursday, the day PCAs administrative committee is to meet to review arrangements for the forthcoming Challenger Trophy. 

Asked what Harbhajan had to say when he called up, Pandove said, he told me that he will present his side when he meets us. 

Harbhajan is registered with PCA and is a part of the Indian team. The administrative committee has taken note of and considered the statements made by him. 

Only after talking to him, we would be able to put things in right perspective, Pandove said. 

Harbhajan had backed captain Sourav Ganguly, crediting him for the success of the team while accusing Chappell of creating fear and insecurity among the players. (PTI)

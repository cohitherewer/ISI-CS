 Favourite wins ?Grand National? 

Liverpool (Reuters): Irish raider Hedgehunter, the 7-1 favourite ridden by Ruby Walsh, romped to a 14-length victory in the Aintree Grand National on Saturday. Second place in the 40-strong field went to Royal Auclair (40-1) with Simply Gifted (66-1) in third. ?It is absolutely brilliant, he is a proper horse,? Walsh said.

 The unlucky horse of the race was Tony McCoy?s mount Clan Royal who was hampered by two loose horses when leading at Bechers Brook on the second circuit and was forced out of the race. Hedgehunter, who fell at the last fence last year, took over after Clan Royal?s exit and galloped clear from the last fence. Carrie Ford, bidding to become the first woman to win the race, finished a gallant fifth on Forest Gunner. It was a second National success for Walsh who won in 2000 on Papillon.

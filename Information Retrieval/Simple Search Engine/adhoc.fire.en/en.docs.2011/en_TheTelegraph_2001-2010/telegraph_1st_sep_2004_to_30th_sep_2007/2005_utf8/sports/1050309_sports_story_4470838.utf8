 No solution after 7-hr meeting

- Progress has been made, says Grenada PM 

 Brian Lara 

St George?s (Grenada): West Indian cricket authorities failed to resolve a dispute that could keep players such as Brian Lara and Chris Gayle from competing in tours by South Africa and Pakistan, but Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell said progress was made. 

?We can?t say we?ve had a complete solution but we have made some considerable progress,? said Mitchell, who mediated the nearly seven-hour discussion between the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the players association on Monday. 

It was not immediately clear if the two sides would meet again, but Mitchell said he would contact both before Thursday. 

The WICB on Saturday announced a 22-member squad that did not include Lara, Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Fidel Edwards, Dwayne Bravo and Dwayne Smith for a six-day training camp starting in Barbados on March 23. 

The camp is preparation for South Africa?s four-Test, five ODI tour in April-May. Pakistan are scheduled to come for two Tests and three ODIs in May-June. 

Lara and the other five have personal contracts with British telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless, the major regional rival of the WICB?s title sponsor, Irish-owned Digicel. 

The dispute first erupted before January?s tour of Australia, when the WICB refused to take any player who had personal endorsement deals with rivals of the WICB?s main sponsors. The dispute was temporarily resolved when both sides agreed to binding arbitration. 

But WICB president Teddy Griffith said in a televised broadcast on Saturday that the board cannot jeopardise cricket in the region as a result of individual contracts that will profit a few players. 

Mitchell, whose last-minute intervention saved the Australia tour, subsequently called Monday?s emergency meeting. 

Among others at the meeting were Griffith, players? association president Dinanath Ramnarine, Digicel chairman Denis O?Brien and Cable and Wireless regional executive vice-president Paul Aspin. 

The South Africa visit is the first home series under Digicel?s five-year, $20 million contract. 

The WICB selected a group of players headed by Shivnarine Chanderpaul, vice captain to Lara in the recent Australia series. Called by selectors for the first time were opening batsman Ryan Ramdass of Guyana, who has three centuries in the regional Carib Beer series; and Jamaican Donovan Pagon, who performed consistently well in the regional series. 

Two surprise omissions were experienced fast bowler Mervyn Dillon and batsman Marlon Samuels, who both toured Australia. (AP)

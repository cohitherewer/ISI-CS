 London: Chelsea on Tuesday denied they were seeking to sign Rio Ferdinand after reports emerged that the club?s chief executive Peter Kenyon met the Manchester United defender in a London restaurant. The Premier League leaders, aware that the meeting would feature in newspapers, made a statement stressing the two had run into each other by chance.

 ?We have made it absolutely clear to Manchester United that we have no interest in signing Rio Ferdinand and there is absolutely no significance in Peter Kenyon seeing Rio in a busy London restaurant,? the statement said. 

 New Delhi: India were clubbed in group A along with hosts South Korea for the first Asian Football Confederation U-17 women?s championship which will kick off in an island near Busan in South Korea Saturday. The other teams in group A were Indonesia and Thailand. 

 The tournament which will be on till April 27 is part of the AFC?s development programme under the Vision Asia umbrella to promote, develop and elevate women?s football in Asia.

 Manchester: Manchester United captain Roy Keane says the clubs recent performances have not been up to scratch and not all of his teammates have been giving 100 per cent. ?We can all make excuses but people are probably sick of excuses,? Keane said. ?Generally, our performances have been very poor. They havent been good enough.?

 Keane missed last weekends defeat at Norwich City to ensure he would be able to play on Sunday against Newcastle United in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. ?The most important thing is you have to look at yourself,? said the Irishman. ?You have to ask yourself ?are you giving 100 per cent to the club for the manager and for the fans?I am not sure that every player can say they are.?

 New Delhi: Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore had to be content with the fifth place in double trap event in the World Cup shooting in Changwon, South Korea. The Indian tallied a total of 172 points to finish behind Walton Eller of US (180 points), Daniele di Spigno of Italy (179) and Binyuan Hu of China (177) who won the gold, silver and bronze medals respectively, according to information received here on Wednesday.

 Athens Olympic gold medallist Ahmed Almaktoum of UAE took the fourth spot with a score of 176. The sixth place went to Australia?s Thomas Turner who shot 171. 

 Bangalore: Established long-distance runners from Kenya and Ethiopia are expected to feature in the inaugural Lipton Bangalore Marathon on May 15. 

 ?We have four to six leading runners from Kenya and Ethiopia who have confirmed participation,? said an organising official. Other overseas participants will be from Tanzania, France, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. 

 Madrid: Sete Gibernau has confirmed that he will race in Sunday?s Portuguese GP despite injuring his shoulder in last weekend?s season-opener at Jerez.

 ?I don?t think I will be 100 per cent for the race, and this bothers me, but I will definitely be in Estoril this weekend,? the Catalan told a sports daily on Wednesday.

 Lanark may win in Mysore 

 WILLIAM TELL

Mysore: Romantic Count and Lanark, who are showing out during their workouts, look best in the field of 12 to fight it out for the 1,400m Udhagamandalam Cup, here on Thursday. 

The Z. Darashah-ward Lanark, however, has the benefit of a run, where he was unlucky to have gone down in a close contest. 

 Now that he is enjoying a sizeable advantage at the weights, the Glory Of Dancer-Baloustar four-year-old is expected to be driven home a winner by jockey Gnaneshwar.

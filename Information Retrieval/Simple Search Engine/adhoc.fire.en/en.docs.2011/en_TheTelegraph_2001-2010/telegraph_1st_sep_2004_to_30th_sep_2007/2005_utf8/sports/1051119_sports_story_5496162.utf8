Shanghai: Argentine Gaston Gaudio clawed his way back from the brink of defeat to beat Chiles Fernando Gonzalez on Friday, setting up a semi-final clash with Roger Federer at the season-ending Masters Cup. 

Gaudio saved three match points in a pulsating 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 win and now has the daunting task of halting world No. 1 Federers charge for a third straight Masters title on Saturday. 

Russias Nikolay Davydenko plays Argentine David Nalbandian in the other semi-final at the $4.45 million Shanghai tournament. 

Davydenko crushed Argentinas Mariano Puerta 6-3, 6-2 to finish at the top of the Gold Group with a perfect 3-0 record in his first Masters Cup appearance. 

In the doubles matches, third seeded Zimbabweans Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett defeated the Swede-Belgian pair of Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 to set up a semi-final clash with fifth seeded Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic. 

Sixth seeded Michael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro of France defeated Stephen Huss and Wesley Moodie ? who were forced to retire due to Huss knee injury ? 6-4, 4-1 and will face top seed Americans Bob and Mike Bryan in the other semi-final.

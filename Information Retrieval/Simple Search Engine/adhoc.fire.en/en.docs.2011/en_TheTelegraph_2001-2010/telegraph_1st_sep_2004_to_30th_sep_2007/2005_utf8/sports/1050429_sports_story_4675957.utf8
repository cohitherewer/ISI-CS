 Romario fires in final match

Sao Paulo: Brazil striker Romario celebrated his international farewell with a goal as the world champions beat Guatemala 3-0 in an international friendly on Wednesday. 

The 39-year-old, who was brought back for a one-off game four years after his making last appearance for Brazil, headed into an empty net in the 17th minute after Ricardinho pounced on a poor clearance by goalkeeper Miguel Klee, who was left stranded. 

The former PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona and Valencia player was then booked for removing his shirt as he celebrated. 

Romario was substituted in the 38th minute by Grafite and escorted off the field by Rai, Branco, Viola and several other team-mates from Brazil?s 1994 World Cup-winning team, when he spearheaded the attack and scored five goals. 

He then completed a lap of honour at the Pacaembu Stadium, holding up play for several minutes. 

?Unfortunately, it?s over, but I?m very happy with everything I?ve conquered,? said Romario, who wept through the Brazilian national anthem before the kick-off. 

Romario, whose international career began in a friendly away to the Republic of Ireland in 1987, will continue his club career with Vasco da Gama at least until the end of the year. 

Brazil, fielding a team of home-based players for the game that was arranged to celebrate the 40th anniversary of a television station, went ahead when defender Anderson beat Klee to Cicinho?s cross and headed home after five minutes. 

Romario, who scored Brazil?s goal when the teams drew 1-1 in their only previous meeting in 1998, was twice close to opening his account before his goal. He also had a goal disallowed for offside in the 26th minute. 

Grafite, one of 11 Brazilian players to make their international debuts, scored the third in the 65th minute. 

Guatemala, missing five first-team regulars, gained in confidence after Robinho and Romario were taken off.

 Ambrosini doubtful 

 Ambrosini suffered thigh injury during Sundays Serie A match versus Lecce 

Carnago (Italy): AC Milan midfielder Massimo Ambrosini is a major doubt for the Champions League final against Liverpool next week. 

The Italy international suffered a thigh injury in Sundays 2-2 Serie A draw at Lecce. 

It will be difficult for him to recover, said Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti on Tuesday, adding that he had no other injury problems. 

Ambrosini has been restricted to the bench for much of this season but is frequently used as a substitute during the second half of games. 

His absence would be a setback for Milan who have little quality cover in midfield for the hard-tackling Gennaro Gattuso. 

Should Ambrosini be missing Frenchman Vikash Dhorasoo and Italian Cristian Brocchi would be in contention for places on the bench in Istanbul on May 25. 

Ancelotti hinted that striker Filippo Inzaghi, who has missed the bulk of this season through injury, was in with a strong chance of featuring against Liverpool. 

Inzaghi is fine and he is available. In fact, he is one of the freshest players in the squad given that he has not played many games this season, said Ancelotti.

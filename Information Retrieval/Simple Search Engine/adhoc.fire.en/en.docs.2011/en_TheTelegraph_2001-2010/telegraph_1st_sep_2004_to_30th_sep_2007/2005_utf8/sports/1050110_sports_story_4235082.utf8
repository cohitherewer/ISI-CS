The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I can be effective in ODIs too, says Kaneria 

 Kaneria fears being branded as a Test bowler 

Karachi: Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria fears he could be branded as a Test bowler after being omitted from the squad for the one-day series in Australia. 

The 24-year-old was dropped for this month?s triangular tournament, also featuring West Indies, despite bagging 15 wickets in Pakistan?s 3-0 Test series defeat to Australia. 

?It is disappointing not to be retained for the one-dayers because I think I can be effective in limited overs cricket as well,? Kaneria said on Sunday after returning from Australia. 

?I don?t want to carry this tag of being a Test bowler for long. Having bowled to the world?s best batsmen I have gained a lot in confidence and ideas. But the team management told me I needed to rest before the tour to India in February.? 

Kaneria has a haul of 102 wickets from 23 Tests and although he has played in just 10 one-day Internationals, he is targeting a place in the one-day squad on the India tour. 

?Leg spinners have played an effective role in one-dayers in the past. Shane Warne, Anil Kumble... they all won matches for their country, he added. 

?I will just have to work harder to convince everyone they can rely upon me in limited overs cricket.? 

Pakistan tour India from February 25 to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals.

Kuala Lumpur: Defending champion Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand spoilt Thomas Bjorn?s 34th birthday celebrations with three late birdies to finish two strokes clear in the Malaysian Open second round on Friday. 

Thongchai again showed his liking for the Saujana course in Kuala Lumpur with a six-under-par round of 66 to move to 14 under in the co-sanctioned Asian and European Tour event. 

Bjorn, seeking his eighth tour victory, fired nine birdies in an eight-under-par 64. 

Thailand?s Prom Meesawat (65) and Sweden?s Henrik Stenson (64) were next best on 11 under par, with Spain?s Miguel Angel Jimenez (67) and Sweden?s Peter Gustafsson (65) tied in fifth spot on nine under, two ahead of Ireland?s Padraig Harrington and Gary Murphy. 

Thongchai sealed his victory last year when he aced the 16th and birdied the last hole and the 34-year virtually repeated that effort on day two. 

?I saw Thomas Bjorn before I teed off and I congratulated him on his score but then I had to play my own game, which is always fairways, greens and putts,? Thongchai told reporters.

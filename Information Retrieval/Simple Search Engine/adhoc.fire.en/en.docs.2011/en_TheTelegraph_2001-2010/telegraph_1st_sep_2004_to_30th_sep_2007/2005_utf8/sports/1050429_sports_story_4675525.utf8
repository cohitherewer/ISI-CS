The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Super selectors meet on May 9

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) super selectors will meet in Mumbai on May 9 to pick 30 players for the World Test XI and as many for the World ODI XI. They are to feature in the Super Series face-off against Australia in October. 

The selectors, with Sunil Gavaskar in the chair, are going to prune the list to 20 in July. The final 14 will be picked in August. 

That the Super Selectors are expected to meet in India by May 10 was reported by The Telegraph last week.

 Sixth title for Mary Kom

Jamshedpur: Haryana bagged the team championship pushing behind last years winner Kerala in the 6th Senior Womens National Boxing Championship at the J. R. D. Tata Sports Complex here on Saturday. 

Haryana secured 33 points to claim the team championship title, while Kerala bagged 30 points. Last years runner-up Manipur slipped down to third spot. World champion, M. C. Mary Kom of Manipur outscored Keralas Swapana V. K. in the final to retain the title in the 46kg category for the sixth consecutive year. 

Mary Kom, who had two gold and one silver medal in the World Championship last month, did not allow any room for her southern rival to surge ahead, and kept on mounting pressure on Swapana, who conceded the match in the second round. 

Asian gold medallist and national champion Aruna Mishra (SPSB) proved the better of Sikkims Pratima in the 66kg as the referee had to stop the contest in the second round.

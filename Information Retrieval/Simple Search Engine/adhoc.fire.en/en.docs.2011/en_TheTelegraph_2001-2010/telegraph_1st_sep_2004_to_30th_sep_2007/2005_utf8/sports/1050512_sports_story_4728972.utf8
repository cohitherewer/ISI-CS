 Stewart faces ouster from BRDC

 - EGM could see ex-F1 world champion voted out as president 

 Jackie Stewart 

London: Jackie Stewart has seen friends killed at race tracks and received death threats for his campaigning efforts to improve Formula One safety. He left school at 15, considered stupid because of undiagnosed dyslexia. 

Yet in all his remarkable life, the three-time world champion says he has never had to face a situation quite like the one that comes to a head at Silverstone circuit on Thursday. 

An extraordinary general meeting of the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) has been called for a vote that could oust the 65-year-old Scot as president and board member. 

On the face of it the dispute might appear little more than a parochial dispute, a clash of egos among the tie-and-blazer brigade. Stewart, who became president in 2000 after being asked by his dying Formula One mentor Ken Tyrrell to take the job, disagrees. 

There was a campaign started which has been totally aimed at, as I see it, my credibility and my integrity, he told reporters gathered at his house set in acres of rolling countryside last week. 

A very vicious campaign that started off with only two or three people but was networked on to a level which has grown to be extraordinary... The misinformation and disinformation has been colossal. 

My motor racing fight for safety was a tough one, tough because organisers and track owners didnt want to spend money and the racetracks were a disaster, said Stewart, open scrapbooks on a nearby table testifying to a career always in the limelight. 

Thursdays meeting marks the closing stages of a dispute that flared up last year during on-off negotiations with Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone to secure the future of the British Grand Prix at BRDC-owned Silverstone. (Reuters)

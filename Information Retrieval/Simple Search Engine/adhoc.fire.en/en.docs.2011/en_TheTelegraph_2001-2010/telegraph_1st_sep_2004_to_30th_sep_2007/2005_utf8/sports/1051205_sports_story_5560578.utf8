The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Money matters for Chandhok

 - World Series the target 

SREEMOY TALUKDAR

Chennai: Hes enjoying his moment under the sun, but Team Indias A1 GP driver Karun Chandhok is not a satisfied man. 

Taking part in the championship, which spans six continents and has been touted as the World Cup of Motorsport with drivers fighting for countrys pride, should have been the pinnacle of ambition for most drivers, but not Chandhok. 

The Chennai lad is still busy searching for the Holy Grail (in this case, funds) to fulfil his destiny ? that of participating in Formula One. 

Of course, its still my dream? No doubt about it, the 21-year-old told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the National Racing Championship on Sunday. 

A1 is a terrific concept, I mean, it pits a nation against another nation on the race track and captures the imagination of the janata, said Chandhok, adding it brings the racing out of the personal sphere into the public sphere. 

And the Team India driver is preparing well. To begin with, he wants to hone his skills in a proper World Series, which starts from April and goes on till October. 

The World Series winner will get a test drive with the Renault team in Formula One? That got me going, said the 21-year-old. 

I want to compete in all the legs in the World Series and roughly, it would cost me around Rs 3.6 crores. I missed the first two practice sessions owing to lack of funds but hope to catch up when the third one begins, said Chandhok. 

Acknowledging the contribution made by Narain Karthikeyan in popularising the sport in the sub-continent, Karun, however, feels unless more manufacturers step in with a proper programme in place, motorsports wont thrive in this cricket-mad nation. 

We also need a racetrack in North, for instance in Gurgaon or Delhi. I have been asked many times why Narain, myself or Armaan (Ebrahim) are all from South. Well, the infrastructure was there to begin with. This, coupled with a manufacturer with a vision, should put us on track, Chandhok signed off. 

He doesnt lack a vision.

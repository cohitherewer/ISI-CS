Vadodara: Mahendra Singh Dhoni slammed a swashbuckling half-century as India beat Sri Lanka by five wickets to win the Videocon Cup 6-1 on Saturday. 

Chasing a target of 245, Dhoni unleashed an array of breathtaking shots to score a 73-ball 80 and steer the team home with 10.3 overs to spare in what turned out to be yet another lop-sided encounter. 

The Indians again outplayed the hapless visitors in all departments of the game to bag the series with one of the biggest victory margins in recent times, staging a dramatic turnaround in their fortunes after a prolonged period of indifferent outings in one-dayers. 

The hosts relied on fine bowling performances by the young Rudra Pratap Singh (three for 33) and local hero Irfan Pathan (three for 38) to restrict Sri Lanka to 244 for nine and then rattled up the required runs without much sweat to end on a rousing note. 

 Captain Rahul Dravid brought the victory with a delectable boundary off Chaminda Vaas, sending the capacity crowd at the stadium into a frenzy. It also marked Dravids first series win as captain. The Indian run chase began with a flourish as Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar attacked the Sri Lankan bowlers from the word go. 

The pair put on 53 runs in quick time before Sehwag perished for a 25-ball 35, once again failing to make most of a good start. 

Pathan, promoted to No. 3 for the second time in the series, scoring a quick-fire 35 studded with four fours and two sixes. He was declared the Man of the Match. 

It was the turn of Dhoni, Man of the Series, to take the centrestage. Batting at No. 4, his knock included 8 fours and three sixes. 

 Poor Media facilities 

There are quite a few centres in India which will stake a claim to offering terrible Media facilities, but the IPCL Cricket Stadium Press box took the cake. 

Even the basic facilities were absent and if the Baroda Cricket Association cant provide the bare minimum, then it shouldnt be hosting international matches.

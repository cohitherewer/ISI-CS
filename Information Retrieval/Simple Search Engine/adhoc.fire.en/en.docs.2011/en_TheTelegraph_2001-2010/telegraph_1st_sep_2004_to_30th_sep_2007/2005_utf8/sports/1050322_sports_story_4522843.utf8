Madrid: Real Madrid kept the Primera Liga title race alive by beating Malaga 1-0 in the Bernabeu on Sunday, reducing Barcelona?s lead at the top to 11 points. 

Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos drilled a 20 metre shot low into the corner on the hour, but Real were made to work hard for their victory by a resilient Malaga, and a demanding crowd who whistled every error. 

With midfielder Thomas Gravesen suspended, Guti returned to Real?s starting line-up, as did Michel Salgado who made an early return from a knee injury. 

Real were unable to make much headway in the first period and as Malaga soaked up the pressure, the crowd grew ever more frustrated. Vanderlei Luxemburgo;s side were whistled off at half time after hardly troubling Francesc Arnau?s goal. 

Malaga defender Fernando Sanz almost silenced the Bernabeu with a diving header but his effort skimmed over the bar. Roberto Carlos finally found a gap on the edge of the area and angled a low shot into the far corner of Arnau?s goal to settle the home side. 

Meanwhile, Ronaldo apologised for throwing a plastic water battle into the crowd after being abused by fans on Sunday. 

The incident occurred when the Brazilian international was being substituted five minutes from time and had to endure a barrage of whistles as he walked off the field. 

?When I got close to the bench two young lads shouted racist insults against me and my mother. I reacted in the wrong way, but the insults were very bad...It was nothing, really,? Ronaldo told reporters after the game. 

Valencia made short work of Getafe as they strolled to a 3-1 win that put them up to fifth and back in the hunt for the European places. Francisco Rufete, Marco Di Vaio and Mista all scored for Valencia before Mariano Pernia pulled one back for the visitors. 

Sevilla striker Julio Baptista ended his sides five-match winless run from the penalty spot, then got sent off, as the Andalucians beat struggling Real Mallorca 1-0. 

Milan win 2-0 

Argentine Hernan Crespo struck again as AC Milan won 2-0 at Roma on Sunday to keep level at the top of Serie A with Juventus, add reports from Milan. 

After Juventus beat Reggina 1-0 on Saturday, to move to 66 points, the pressure was on Milan and they responded with a second half Crespo header and an Andrea Pirlo penalty to ensure their eighth successive league win. 

It was a grim debut for Roma coach Bruno Conti who saw defender Christian Panucci sent off in the 70th minute and then skipper Francesco Totti was given the red card. 

After an evenly balanced first 45 minutes, Milan went in front after Crespo rose above Panucci at the back post to head home a superb cross from Kakha Kaladze. 

Milan doubled their lead when Panucci handled a Crespo header inside the area and was dismissed before Pirlo slotted home the penalty. 

Third-placed Inter Milan, 16 points behind the leaders, held out for a 3-2 victory over Fiorentina at the San Siro but had their Brazilian striker Adriano stretchered off with a knee injury in the first half. 

Inter went ahead in the 27th minute with a fine volley from Argentine midfielder Esteban Cambiasso. But they were pegged back five minutes before the break when Giampaolo Pazzini netted with an acrobatic effort. 

Another Argentine, Juan Sebastian Veron fired Inter back in front eight minutes after the restart with a thundering shot from 20 metres and the game looked over when Colombian Ivan Cordoba scored in the 65th minute. 

Inter were given a late scare three minutes from the end, Cordoba turning a low cross from Fiorentina?s Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata into his own net. 

In the Premier League, Liverpool boosted their hopes of qualifying for next season?s Champions League with a 2-1 victory over Everton in a passionate Merseyside derby on Sunday (as reported in Monday?s Late City edition). 

Liverpool led through first-half goals by captain Steven Gerrard and Spanish playmaker Luis Garcia before a 77th-minute red card for their Czech striker Milan Baros threw Everton a lifeline at Anfield. 

Everton?s Australian midfielder Tim Cahill capitalised with a fine strike on 82 minutes but Liverpool held on during a thrilling finale for a priceless win in the race to finish fourth. They now trail Everton by only four points.

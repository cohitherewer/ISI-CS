 Bowlers hold sway

 Sachin Tendulkar is bowled by Kumble for four runs in Hyderabad on Wednesday 

Hyderabad: West Zone captain Sachin Tendulkar failed with the bat in his comeback match even though his side managed to take a 20-run first innings lead against South Zone in a Duleep Trophy match here on Wednesday. 

South, who were bowled out for 187 in the first innings, found themselves in disarray again as they were reduced to 141 for five in the second innings at stumps on the second day at the Viskaha Stadium here today. Tendulkar, resuming action after an injury enforced lay-off, hit an exquisite four off the very first ball he faced, but three balls later misread the line of an Anil Kumble delivery to be clean bowled ? much to the disappointment of a big crowd which had hoped to see the maestro in full flow. 

Resuming at overnight score of 71 for three, West Zone reached 207 with the help of some rear guard action by Neeraj Patel (43) and Parthiv Patel, who scored an elegant 25. Ramesh Powar, who wrecked South?s first innings, scored 15 runs as the team coasted to 207 with Anil Kumble and Vinay Kumar claiming four wickets each. 

Starting with a deficit of 20 runs, South Zone batting failed to meet the expectations again with V.V.S. Laxman (13) and Rahul Dravid (5) getting out rather cheaply. Opener Robin Uthappa scored 40 with four hits to the fence. South?s second innings was built around valuable knocks by Y Venugopala Rao (47 n.o.) and S Sriram (23) who put on a 56-run partnership for the fifth wicket.

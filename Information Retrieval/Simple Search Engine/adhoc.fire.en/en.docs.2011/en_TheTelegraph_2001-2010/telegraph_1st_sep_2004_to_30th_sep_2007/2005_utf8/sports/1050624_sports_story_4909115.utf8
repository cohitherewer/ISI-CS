 Tremlett finds mentor in Warne

Nottingham: Shane Warne, ever since bowling Mike Gatting with the ball of the century back in 1993, has been a thorn in Englands side. 

But in his role as Hampshire captain the leg-spin great has helped his countrys oldest opponents by playing a leading role in the development of England pace prospect Chris Tremlett, injecting some Aussie steel into the six-foot 7-inch gentle giant. 

Now the 23-year-old quick wants to repay the Australia star by letting loose a few bouncers at Ricky Pontings men during the Ashes Test series which starts in July. 

Last weekend Tremlett, a member of Englands development squad, was on the fringe of national selection. But a decision to rest Simon Jones because of a knee injury saw him called into the one-day series party and Tremlett responded by taking four for 32 on debut in Tuesdays 168-run victory over Bangladesh at Trent Bridge. 

Indeed, only the most outrageous fluke denied Tremlett a hattrick when Mohammad Ashraful played the ball onto the top of the bails only to see them stay put. 

But Tremlett, whose grandfather Maurice played for England in the years after World War II and whose father Tim, an England A representative, was a mainstay of the Hampshire attack during the 1980, told reporters in Nottingham Wednesday that had it not been for Warne he might be a county also-ran. 

Shane Warne has been brilliant. In the last couple of years he has probably been my biggest influence. He has made me play my cricket with great positive intent, the whole Hampshire team really, he said. 

He has taken me in and told me how to bowl and just backed me 100 per cent with everything Ive done and I think the success over the last couple of years is down to Shane, Tremlett said. 

I think he has tried to put a bit more aggression and ruthlessness into me. People see me as being a gentle giant and I am naturally not aggressive, Tremlett admitted. 

Indeed such has been Warnes influence on the softly-spoken Tremlett he almost sounds more like a young Dennis Lillee, rather than the son of a reliable fast-medium bowler, in his reaction to seeing batsmen in trouble against his bouncers. 

What do I feel when I hit a batsman? I quite enjoy it. I hit Alistair Brown on the head in a game against Surrey and that gave me quite a lot of pleasure. It is nice to be able to bowl fast. Its a gift that youve got and you may as well use it so, if you can scare a few batsmen, thats your job. 

But Tremlett said Warnes influence had run far deeper than just giving him the belief to bowl short. 

I remember when Shane said I need you to step up to the mark and have a match-winning performance when we set Nottinghamshire a decent run chase, also at Trent Bridge earlier this month, and I managed to get a hattrick. He has confidence in you. 

Tremlett, whose career has several times been interrupted by broken bones in his feet, was still savouring his England debut. It was a bit of a shock to be in the side ? on Saturday I was sat at home when Simon Jones got injured.

 Lillee trains WI bowler in Chennai

Chennai: MRF Pace Foundation, renowned academy for bowlers since 1987, has added another feather to its cap with Hank Hall of West Indies becoming the first player from the land of fast bowling to train here. 

The 19-year-old Hall, a budding star from St Vincent, is training here under former Australian speedster Dennis Lillee and will complete a stint of three weeks, which began on Jaunary 15. 

The city-based academy, which went international in 1992, had so far trained bowlers from all the full members of the International Cricket Council, including Australian Brett Lee. 

The academy remains the only institution that specialises in rehabilitation of injured international fast bowlers and both Zaheer Khan and Laxmipathy Balaji underwent training and corrective measures for three weeks under Lillee?s guidance. 

During Lillee?s visit this time from January 15 to February 3, many international bowlers honed their skills. (PTI)

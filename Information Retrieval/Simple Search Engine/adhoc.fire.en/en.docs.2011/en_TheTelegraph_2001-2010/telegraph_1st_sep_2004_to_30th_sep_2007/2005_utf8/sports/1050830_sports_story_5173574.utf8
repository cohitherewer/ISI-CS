 Compassionate brought good luck to Javed 

 STAR RACER

 JavedChisty

 Punters could not have complained last Friday. All the six winners were favourites and most of them were available at attractive odds. The mood was reflected by the tote returns, particularly the jackpot dividends, which paid off Rs 323 on each of the numerous winning tickets. It was the visiting jockey Imran Chistys day. he steered four of them to winners enclosures, also to the delight of trainers Errol Bhungard and Daniel David.

 Daniels share in the quadruple of wins was a significant three. However, the trainer who rued most on the day was Bharath Singh. The crafty schooler not only witnessed his ward Accuser perform wretch-edly in the race won by Compa-ssionate, he also had to empty half of his stable. His leading patron, Deepak Khaitan, and his close associates, issued marching orders to a contingent of 22 horses. They were transferred to the adjacent Javed Khans yard.

 Accusers poor performance on the day was not the sole reason behind the drastic decision but things have definitely not been going right between the two for quite sometime, according to those close to the heavyweight owner. Bharath, on the other hand, was philosophic about the development, and he puts it as a common hazard in the profession.

 Coming back to Compassionate, the mare had the form and look by her side, compared to Accuser who had performed in a similar manner in their previous clash. Therefore, Compassionates even-money odds in the 1,800m Roubaix Cup had all the logic while Accuser attracting support at 6-4 surprised all. 

 Agreed, Accuser is known to push the level of his performance to a great extent in the back-to-back outings but nothing of that kind happened on this day. The Twist And Turn-Arisen son raised some hope till the final turn but faded out from the scene quickly to finish last in a four-horse field.

 Compassionate, on the other hand, proved too good for the opposition despite losing about seven lengths at the start. 

 Of the four winners Chisty booted home, it was Native Son who gave the jockey an armchair ride in the 1,200m Own Ability Handicap. The Daniel-ward was ridden off the pace behind Common Spirit, One For Me and Nominate till the final turn. However, Chisty waited till about the distance-post to pass the final hurdle, Common Spirit.

 Daniels Generous Gift made every post of the 1,800m Treasure Land Cup a winning one. Expected to be suspect over the trip, the Steinbeck-Tick Tock four-year-old defied such logic as he travelled double-handful throughout the trip.

 Wayward King was fully stret-ched by Flossy and the last-stride victory of the Daniel-ward must have kept his backers on the edge of their seats in the Tangiers Handicap. However, the close contest in the opener, the Flying Glance Handicap, between Bhungards Trojan Desert and Bhar-aths Seeker, was unnecessary. Chisty eased up the Desert 100m from the post when comfortably ahead, and D. Singh tried to catch the seasoned jockey napping.

 Another one who impressed in her debut win was Vijay Sin-ghs Knowledgeable who, in the Alvarada Handicap, made it from pillar-to-post. The Tecorno-Knowing filly may strike again.

 Tevez hattrick

Rio de Janeiro: Argentina forward Carlos Tevez has been voted Latin Americas Footballer of the Year for the third year running in a poll by an Uruguayan newspaper. 

The 21-year-old, who won the vote in 2003 and 2004 thanks to his performances with Boca Juniors, this year topped the poll after leading Corinthians to the Brazilian championship title in his first season with the club. (Reuters)

 Sehwag waiting for big innings 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: Virender Sehwag hopes the big knock that has eluded him so far in the series is around the corner. 

I am just waiting for the big one. I need to spend more time in the middle. However, I am not worried about it since the team management is happy with my contribution and my role. Everyone has been assigned a specific role and we are trying to fulfil it to perfection, the vice-captain said on Saturday. 

But what is that specific role he is talking about? If we are batting first, my job is to stay in the middle for at least 20 overs. That will make others task easy. 

Coach Greg Chappell, who was sitting next to him at the media conference, nodded and said he considered Sehwag an allrounder. He is vital to our plans. His bowling helps us to rework strategies. I consider him an allrounder. 

Sehwag also explained the reasons for his frequent dismissals in the 30s and 40s. Youve got to be too much positive in one-dayers. You just cant let any opportunity go. The situation is different in Test matches where you can take some time to get used to the conditions and wait for the bad deliveries. Anyway, I hope to play a big innings tomorrow.

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has told his players to leave their egos at home when they attempt to win their sixth World Cup in Germany next year. ?If we can?t control the egos of these players, then Brazil will certainly not win the Hexa (sixth world title),? he said on Tuesday. ?This is our big challenge, to bring together players who are international stars and convince them to work towards this common target.?

 Parreira also warned against the dangers of being considered hot favourites. ?A lot of favourites didn?t win the title, such as Hungary in 1954 and The Netherlands in 1974,? he said. ?It will be 14 European teams against Brazil and Argentina. Everyone will especially be against Brazil because if we win a sixth title, thats going to put a big difference between us and the rest and theyll need 200 or 300 years to catch up.? 

 Madrid: Atletico Madrid say they are taken aback by local council plans to demolish their Vicente Calderon Stadium and create a riverside park. ?It?s the first I?ve heard of the idea,? Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo told a radio station.

 ?If the local council is planning to demolish the stadium, then I imagine that they would consult us.?

 Madrid mayor Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon revealed on Tuesday the winning proposal to regenerate the area around the city?s Manzanares river which suggests the 39-year-old stadium should be demolished. Ruiz-Gallardon said, however, that the plan was likely to be modified and depended on agreement with the club.

 Melbourne: The Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) has abandoned its traditional World Cup qualifying tournament in favour of home and away qualifiers following Australia?s switch to Asia. Earlier this month, Australia edged Uruguay on penalties to secure a berth at the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany from Oceania, but they had already committed to qualifying through Asia for the following tournament in South Africa.

 Lausanne: Fifa and WADA have taken their dispute over minimum doping bans to world sport?s highest tribunal. The Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport said it had received requests from both sides to provide an advisory opinion on Fifa?s unwillingness to adopt WADA?s recommended two-year ban for first-time drug offences. CAS said a decision is expected before February?s 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. 

 New Delhi: A list of 200 probables will be released by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) for next years Manchester Commonwealth Games and Doha Asian Games. quot;The list of about 200 probables will be released in a day or two, quot; AFI secretary general Lalit Bhanot said. 

 London: Scuderia Toro Rosso made their Formula One test debut with a version of the car raced by Red Bull?s other team this year. The team said Italian Vitantonio Liuzzi tested at Barcelona?s Circuit de Catalunya in an RB1 car powered by a restricted Cosworth V10 engine and Michelin tyres.

 Australian cricket to woo Indians 

Sydney: Indians to Australias rescue in cricket? 

With the local youngsters drifting away from the game to other sports, cricket bosses in the country are making a serious effort to woo the children of the Indian community into the sport. 

Cricket New South Wales (Cricket NSW) is launching a television campaign aimed at getting more children into the sport, particularly the thriving Indian community. 

We really want to tap into the ethnic communities in that area, said Cricket NSWs chief executive, David Gilbert. 

We really want the Indian community feeling as if theyre part of it. Thats a real focus for us, to try and be a lot more welcoming and give them more opportunities. 

The same goes for Sydneys Sudanese population in the Blacktown. These guys are six foot seven, skinny as rakes, but theyve got the height, Gilbert said. There is potential to find ourselves a Curtly Ambrose rather than those guys going to basketball, he was quoted as saying by a local newspaper. (PTI)

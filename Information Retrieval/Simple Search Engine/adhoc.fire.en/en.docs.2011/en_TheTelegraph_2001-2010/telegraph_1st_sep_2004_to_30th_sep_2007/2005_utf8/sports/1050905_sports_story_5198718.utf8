London: Ukraine qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time on Saturday while the United States booked their place for the fifth time in a row. 

Ukraine appeared to have been denied a place early in the evening after conceding a goal a minute from time to draw 1-1 behind closed doors in Georgia. 

An 89th-minute goal from Georgi Gakhokidze cancelled out Ruslan Rotans 44th-minute strike for Ukraine and it seemed they would have to wait for Wednesdays match with Turkey to go through. 

Their dream came back to life later however, when Denmark scored early in Turkey, flickered out again as the Turks fought back to lead 2-1 only to burst into actuality as the Danes scored an injury time equaliser. 

That result meant that neither Turkey or Denmark can match Ukraines total of 24 points, and although European champions Greece, who did not play on Saturday, can still do so, they have an inferior head to head record. 

So Ukraine, who have missed out on three previous tournaments via the playoffs, join the hosts and Asian qualifiers Japan, Iran, South Korea and Saudi Arabia and the US in the mix for Germany. 

The US beat arch-rivals Mexico 2-0. The Netherlands guaranteed themselves a place in the playoffs at worse with a 1-0 Group One win in Armenia 

Romania beat the Czech Republic 2-0 in Bucharest. Poland, England, Croatia and Sweden also all won to maintain their close battles in their two groups. (Reuters)

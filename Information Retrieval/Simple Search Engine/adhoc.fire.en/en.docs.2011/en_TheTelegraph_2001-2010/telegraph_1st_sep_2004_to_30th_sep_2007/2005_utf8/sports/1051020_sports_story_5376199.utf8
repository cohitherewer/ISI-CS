 Carlisle retires

Dubai: A day after Zimbabwe pacer Heath Streak hung his boots, compatriot Stuart Carlisle also announced retirement from cricket citing the infighting in the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) as the reason. 

I have now officially retired from the game. I was fed up by what is happening and I just walked away. Im tired of the politics. Id rather be away from them, Carlisle said.

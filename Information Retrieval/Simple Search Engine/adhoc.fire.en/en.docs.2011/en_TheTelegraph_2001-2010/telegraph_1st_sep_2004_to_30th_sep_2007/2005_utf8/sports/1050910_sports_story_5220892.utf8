 UCI: No action against Armstrong

Paris: International Cycling Union (UCI) chief Hein Verbruggen said on Friday that no action would be taken against Lance Armstrong following the recent allegations of doping against the American. 

Armstrong, who retired after his seventh consecutive Tour de France victory in July, has been accused of using EPO (erythropoietin) by a French newspaper. An article published in the paper two weeks ago showed details of 1999 drug tests. 

Armstrong has vehemently denied the allegations, saying that he is prepared to make a comeback just to spite the French organisers of the worlds toughest bike race. 

Verbruggen, known to be close to Armstrong, meanwhile said that the UCI could not sanction the 33-year-old Texan, and instead seemed more intent on pointing the finger at whoever ordered the tests of the 1999 samples to be carried out. 

He even blamed WADA chief Dick Pound for his handling of the affair. 

Asked whether the UCI would impose any sanction on Armstrong, Verbruggen said: The normal sanction ? if you can prove that someone has tested positive (two years). But what we have here can not be used as proof. 

Its not wise to condemn someone who hasnt tested positive in a legal sense. 

The French paper had printed details of test results from 1999 ? leaked from a Paris laboratory ? which suggested that out of the 12 positive tests that year, six belonged to Armstrong. 

However, since retroactive testing has no legal basis ? the 1999 samples only began to be analysed in 2004 ? it seems unlikely that Armstrong could be sanctioned. (AFP)

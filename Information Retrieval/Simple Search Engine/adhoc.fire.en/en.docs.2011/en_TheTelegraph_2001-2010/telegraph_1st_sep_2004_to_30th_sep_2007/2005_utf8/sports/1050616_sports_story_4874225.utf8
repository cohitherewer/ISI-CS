 Sheer agony for Agassi as age catches up

Mark Hodgkinson

Andre Agassi almost certainly has played his final match on Centre Court at Wimbledon after withdrawing from next week?s tournament because of injury, believed to be the recurring sciatic nerve problem that has troubled him this season. 

The Las Vegan, so famously the champion at the All England Club in 1992, has been suffering the effects of his ageing body for much of the year. He is the oldest man on the tour at 35, and has required cortisone injections to ease the discomfort he is feeling from the sciatic nerve. 

Agassi has not played since losing to a qualifier in the first round of the French Open last month, when the pain from the nerve became so bad that, by the closing stages of the match, he was almost unable to walk along the baseline between points. He was tearful and disorientated at Roland Garros, so much so that he did not perform his usual goodbye after a Grand Slam defeat, kisses and bows to all sides of the stadium. 

It is increasingly unlikely that Agassi will continue playing beyond the end of this season, and many within the tennis world suspect that he will finish his career at the US Open in New York, the fourth major of the year. His appearance at the French Open was the 58th Grand Slam event of his career, a record in the Open era. 

It has been known for some time that Agassi was in danger of missing Wimbledon, and there was no great surprise when he faxed the All England Club Tuesday to inform them that he had been forced to withdraw from The Championships. 

A statement from the referee?s office read: ?Andre Agassi regrets he will have to withdraw from the gentlemen?s singles due to injury. He says that it is a regrettable decision and he will miss playing in the most prestigious tournament in the world.? 

Agassi has won eight Grand Slam titles during his career, and is one of only five men to have won all four of the majors, but he has not been his usual self this year. There has not always been the freedom and the speed of movement that he needs. He has always said that he would continue playing tennis for as long as he felt that he was a contender. 

Agassi first played at Wimbledon in 1987, losing in the first round, and then opted to miss the next three years, only returning in 1991, when he reached the quarter-finals. A year later, he was at the peak of his powers with his service return and he defeated Goran Ivanisevic, the fast-serving Croat, to win his Wimbledon title. At the moment of victory, he collapsed on to the Centre Court grass. It was the first Grand Slam title of his career. Much of the interest in those early years focused on what Agassi, who was then known for his colourful and flamboyant dress sense, would wear to the All England Club, who have a ?predominantly white? rule.

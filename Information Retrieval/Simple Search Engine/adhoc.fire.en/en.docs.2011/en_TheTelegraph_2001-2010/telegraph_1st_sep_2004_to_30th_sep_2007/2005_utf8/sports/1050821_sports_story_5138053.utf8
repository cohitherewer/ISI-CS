 Wenger eyes win in game No. 500

 - Arsenal manager hopes to conquer Chelsea today 

GARY JACOB 

 Arsene Wenger 

It is all but forgotten that Arsene Wenger is yet to lose a Premiership match to Chelsea, but the pressure will be on the Arsenal manager during his 500th game in charge. Wenger and Jose Mourinho, the Chelsea manager, have been sniping at each other for months, offering proof of their mutual aversion, but the spurious battle will be replaced by a more inflicting, damaging encounter at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. 

Keeping within reach of Chelsea at the top of the table is the best that many expect for Arsenal this season, but Wenger, in a relaxed mood, was quick to cast aside the defeatist chatter on Friday. 

To get a big result, you first need to believe and I will do everything possible I can to strengthen that belief before the game because I just feel that this team has the quality to do well at Chelsea and to win the game, Wenger said. We did well against Newcastle, had a good focus and a strong belief. We have the character ? that is not a problem. 

Chelsea have not beaten Arsenal in 18 Premiership matches since 1995, but Mourinhos team hold the upper hand. Seemingly imperious, Arsenal have never fully regained their confidence since the defeat by United in the Battle of the Buffet at Old Trafford last year. 

It is a massive game [Sunday], Wenger, who has declared an interest in Rene Adler, the Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper, said. We want to win the championship and at the end of the season, these points will count double. Your strengths, dominance, in the league is about how well you do in these games. When you look at a season, where you win the title, you reflect and say ah, we did not lose against United, Chelsea or Liverpool and it is no coincidence you win the league. 

Wengers recent remarks that the Barclays Premiership champions depend on the long ball only highlighted his teams weakness in dealing with the aerial demands. Philippe Senderos, the Arsenal defender, can only look back at the way that Didier Drogba, the Chelsea forward, dominated him with ease in the FA Community Shield match two weeks ago. 

I dont fear for him [Senderos] at all at Chelsea, Wenger said. You have to accept he had an average game against Chelsea and he did very well against Newcastle. The important game is the next one and he had an excellent game against [Alan] Shearer. That was a test for Philippe. 

Since arriving as manager in 1996, Wenger has helped to end Uniteds dominance of English football, but shifting an extravagant Chelsea from the zenith will be an even sterner, if not impossible, task. THE TIMES, LONDON

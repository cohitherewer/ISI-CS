 Consolation for England

 Inzamam with the trophy on Wednesday 

Rawalpindi: England rounded off a disappointing tour of Pakistan with a six-run win in the fifth and final one-day International on Wednesday. 

Paceman James Anderson (4/48) and allrounder Ian Blackwell (3/29) led the way after Englands batsmen totalled a modest 206 for nine in their 50 overs. 

Blackwell took the key wickets of Mohammed Yousuf (54), Younis Khan (15) and Shoaib Malik (8). Anderson wiped up the lower order with Pakistan finishing on 200 for nine. 

Pakistan, who won the Test series 2-0, took the one-dayers 3-2 but it was not enough to go second in the ODI world rankings. They remain third behind Australia and South Africa. 

Blackwell played a major role in derailing Pakistan after they reached a comfortable 152 for three. The home side lost six wickets for 48 in the last 11 overs. 

In the final over, Pakistan needed 11 for victory and it proved beyond the last pair of Arshad Khan (12) and Danish Kaneria (2). 

Englands innings revolved around Vikram Solanki (49), Andrew Flintoff (39) and Paul Collingwood (33). 

Liam Plunkett hit two fours and a six off the last three balls from Abdul Razzaq to finish with 24 from 12 balls. 

Pakistan rested Inzamam-ul Haq, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami, giving a chance to Yasir Hameed, top scorer with 57 in his first ODI since June, and debutant Mohammed Asif who finished with two for 14 from seven overs. 

England captain Marcus Trescothick said: The boys showed true character and spirit. It is satisfying that we were able to defend a low total. But it was a good score on this sort of a pitch. 

We were 20 to 30 runs short of what we should have scored, but we bowled well to achieve this victory. 

Inzamam said: It was not an easy wicket to bat on. We needed to buckle down. We didnt do that. England deserved to win, they fought hard.

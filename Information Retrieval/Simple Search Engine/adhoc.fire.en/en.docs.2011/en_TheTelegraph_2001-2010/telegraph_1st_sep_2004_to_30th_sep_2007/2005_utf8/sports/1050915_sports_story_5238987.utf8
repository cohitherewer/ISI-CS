 Its Leanders call, says AITA

New Delhi: Rohan Bopannas selection as fourth member of the Davis Cup team, at Harsh Mankads expense, has stunned the Indian fraternity. 

The 25-year-old Mankad is the highest-ranked Indian on the ATP rankings list at 240. Yet, he has been named as the fifth member for the World Group play-off tie versus Sweden. 

The AITA has put the ball in captain Leander Paes court. The selection committee picked a squad of five, although according to rules only four members make up the team. This was done because the captain has always felt that he could select his best players based on their performance in training, AITA secretary Anil Khanna said. 

It will be the captains decision 100 per cent (on who to field as fourth member). It is Leanders call.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 An end less sad than Alis

 - Mike Tyson ruled first by skill and malevolence and, then, by fear 

[+uc('PAUL HAYWARD in WASHINGTON 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH')+]

 Kevin McBride gets the measure of Mike Tyson on Saturday 

On the gravestone of the fighter to whom Mike Tyson feels closest, there is a simple inscription: Sonny Liston ? A Man. In Washington on Saturday night, Tyson finally stopped being the monster of popular mythology and became what Liston was when they stripped away his power to intimidate and terrify: a man, without the will or the means to purge the ring with blood, as Iron Mike once promised. 

The impressionable and the blind will reel when they learn that Tyson quit on his stool at the end of the sixth round against Kevin McBride in the home of American power, and recoil when they read his candid post-fight admission: I dont have the guts to be in this sport any more. I dont want to disrespect the sport I love. My heart isnt into this any more. Im sorry for the fans who paid for this. I wish I could have done better. Its time to move on with my life and be a father, take care of my children. 

With that, the now middle-aged Baddest Man on the Planet resigned the role of Public Enemy, or rabid dog, as one American boxing commentator once called him. Before he was given a savage beating by Lennox Lewis in Memphis three summers ago, Tyson had on his bookshelf in a chalet in Hawaii, The Ultimate Encyclopaedia of Mythology, in which the second phase of his turbulent career will surely now rate a place. 

Though the hucksters have kept the circus in noise for the full 20 years of his professional career, his reign as one of the great heavyweights ended in 1992 with his six-year sentence for rape, two years after James Buster Douglas had clubbed him to the floor in Tokyo. Not even the two 10 million dollar cheques Tyson was holding when he left the Indiana Youth Centre in 1995 could buy what he had lost: dedication, appetite, speed, agility, youth. From that day, Tyson reverted to the art that got him sent to the Tryon School for Boys in upstate New York. As an expert purse-snatcher, Tyson was always adept at creating an illusion for material gain. 

The hard truth of his last 15 years in the ring is that the once-invincible threshing machine who won the world heavyweight title at 20 years, four months and 22 days has been knocked round the ring with vicious intent by Douglas, Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. McBride and Britains Danny Williams merely walked through the ghost of an opponent who had already been broken in Tokyo, Las Vegas and Memphis, and was gloving up solely to keep the taxman off his back. 

Though pity will be the first response of his last die-hard fans, his end is much less sad than Muhammad Alis shuffling defeats to Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick, or Joe Louis being knocked through the ropes by Rocky Marciano. At least Tyson went out at the bottom, not in denial but with wisdom on his tongue. I was just fighting to pay off the bills, admitted the man who is still around dollars 30 million in debt. Im not an animal any more. 

To anyone who was listening, Tyson raised the white flag three years back ? in Tennessee, where he knocked out the less than robust Clifford Etienne in 49 seconds. In those days the industry was trying to force him back into the ring for Lewis-Tyson II, but it was obvious that the victim in the first contest had no wish to be humiliated again. Conclusions might have been drawn when Tyson reached down to help Etienne back up (how Trevor Berbick or Michael Spinks would have valued such compassion back in the 1980s) but what really confirmed the change in mood was the winners press conference soliloquy. 

Boxings cool, but Ive got some serious, serious demons Im fighting, Tyson said, when asked whether he would be chasing Lewis for revenge. I dont know if I can love anyone. And I definitely dont believe anyone can love me. Ive been doing this for probably 23 or 25 years. I havent received any dignity from it. Ive received a lot of pain from it. Its made me not like Mike Tyson very much. 

This was not the street warrior who had promised to purge the ring with Etiennes blood. Nor was it the showman who told McBrides corner: Im going to gut him like a fish. 

Tyson now has neither the urge nor the capacity to destroy other men for the sake of the entertainment industry. Thats not to say he would make the ideal opponent in an argument over a spilt drink in a bar. Oh, no. The volatility and the persecution complex are still there. But not even the hot pursuit of the taxman, the alimony lawyer and the bankruptcy court can make him want to climb through those ropes. 

I wish I could be Mike who gets an endorsement, but you cant make a lie and a truth go together, Tyson said in Hawaii a few weeks before the Lewis fight. The time spent with him in that beachside suite was the most darkly compelling of my 20 years in newspapers. He talked of Machiavelli and Hemingway and Voltaire and Arthur Ashe. His self-image was half manufactured, half rooted in truth: Im the guy who makes everybody want to say, Hes the bad *****. He enjoyed the apocalyptic theatre of his own voice: Who am I? What am I? I dont even know. Im just a dumb child whos been abused and robbed by lawyers. Im just a fool who thinks hes someone. 

Unlike many, who recover privately, without causing collateral damage to others, Tyson has caused much hurt to innocent bystanders along the way. It may yet be that he re-emerges in some freak show, some affront to boxing, but for now its safe to say that the prize-fighter inside Mike Tyson has left his body to take up a place in the pantheon below the true greats ? Ali, Louis, Marciano, Frazier, Foreman, Holmes, Lewis and the rest ? but certainly among the most destructive heavyweight punchers of the last hundred years. Tyson ruled first by skill and malevolence and then, for a much longer period, by fear ? the last refuge of all tyrants.

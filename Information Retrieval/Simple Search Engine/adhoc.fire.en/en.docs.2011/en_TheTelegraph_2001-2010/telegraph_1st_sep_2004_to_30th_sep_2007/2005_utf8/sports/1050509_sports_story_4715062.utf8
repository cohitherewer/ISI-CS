 Juventus get past Milan

 Trezeguet after netting the winner 

Milan: Juventus took a big step towards a 28th Italian league title with a 1-0 victory over rivals AC Milan which moves them three points clear with three games remaining. 

A 28th minute header from French forward David Trezeguet, who glanced home an acrobatic overhead kick from Alessandro Del Piero, gave Juventus a deserved victory over the defending champions at the San Siro on Sunday. 

Juventus, coached by former Milan boss Fabio Capello, lead on 79 points with Milan on 76. 

Milan, who will face Liverpool in the Champions League final on May 25, were second best for large parts of the game but were furious that referee Pierluigi Collina turned down an appeal for a penalty in the 75th minute when Cafu appeared to be pulled down by Gianluca Zambrotta. 

Third-placed Inter Milan won 3-0 at lowly Brescia with two goals from Nigerian Obafemi Martins but the battle for the fourth Champions League qualification slot remains tight with Udinese and Sampdoria winning to remain level on 59 points. 

Sampdoria beat Lecce 3-0 in Genoa while a Vincenzo Iaquinta goal gave Udinese a 1-0 win away to Lazio. 

Parmas battle against the drop was boosted with a 2-1 victory over Roma which moves them to four points clear of the relegation zone ? level with crumbling Roma on 40 points.

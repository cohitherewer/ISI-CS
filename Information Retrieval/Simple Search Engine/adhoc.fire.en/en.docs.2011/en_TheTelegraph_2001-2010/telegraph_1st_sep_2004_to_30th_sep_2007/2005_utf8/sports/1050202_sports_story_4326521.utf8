 Ahmedabad worries Pak

Karachi: Pakistan have asked India for changes to the proposed itinerary of next month?s Test and one-day series in India. 

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan did not elaborate on the proposed changes to reporters but a source within the PCB said there were concerns over Ahmedabad hosting the second Test. 

Pakistan are due to tour India from February 25, playing three Tests and five one-day Internationals. 

?Playing in Ahmedabad will bring political overtones to the tour,? the source remarked on condition of anonymity. 

Khan met former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya in Dubai on Monday on the sidelines of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) meeting. The other proposed Test venues are Mohali and Bangalore.

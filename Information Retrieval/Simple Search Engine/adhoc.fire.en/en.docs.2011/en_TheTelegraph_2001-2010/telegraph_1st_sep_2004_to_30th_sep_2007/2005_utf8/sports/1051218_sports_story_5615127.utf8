London: Manchester United slashed Chelseas Premier League lead to six points on Saturday with a 2-0 victory at Aston Villa. 

With the champions facing a tough trip to London rivals Arsenal on Sunday, United needed to keep up the pressure with a win and a goal in each half by strikers Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney ensured they did so. 

Chelsea have 43 points from 16 games with United on 37 points from 17 matches. Third-placed Liverpool, on 31 points, are in Japan taking part in the Club World Championship. 

United quickly took control of the first half at Villa Park and almost opened the scoring when South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung fired against the post. 

Two minutes later Van Nistelrooy put them in front when he collected a Darren Fletcher pass, shrugged off his marker and lifted the ball over Villa goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen. 

Rooney added a second with an emphatic finish from Parks pass five minutes into the second half. 

Villas best effort came 10 minutes later when Czech striker Milan Baros struck the bar after a neat cross from substitute striker Juan Pablo Angel. 

United, though, finished the match in exhibition mode with Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo producing some party tricks to provide a cross that Van Nistelrooy ought to have headed in, not wide. 

The victory was a further morale-boost to Alex Fergusons side after their costly Champions League exit. On Wednesday they thrashed Wigan Athletic 4-0. 

It was great performance today, Van Nistelrooy said. We are just getting momentum. When you win confidence grows. We want to continue our form and the run that were making now. Then, who knows what will happen. Weve done our job, thats the most important thing. 

The only thing I do know is that Arsenal have a great record against Chelsea at home and their home record has been good this year, Ferguson maintained. 

Were nine points behind Chelsea if they win their game (at Arsenal) tomorrow. Its a long way, but what we can do is to make sure we win our games and if we do and if Chelsea slip up hopefully we will be the team nearest to them. 

Villa boss David Leary gave a brutally honest assessment of his sides defeat. I just thought we were outplayed, outclassed by a team thats flying, he said. (Reuters)

 Collingwood in the reckoning

 - Second Ashes Test 

 Collingwood may come at the expense of Tremlett 

London: England will announce their squad on Sunday for the second Test against Australia with the players who lost the Ashes opener at Lords by 239 runs likely to be given a chance to redeem themselves at Edgbaston. 

Consistency of selection has been the guiding phrase behind Englands rise to second in the world Test rankings behind Australia and the perils of the opposite approach are clear enough. 

England have lost the last eight Ashes campaigns, a run that started in 1989 when an astonishing 29 players were used during the series. 

Mike Gatting, the last England captain to win the Ashes back in 1986-87, said: I wouldnt make any changes. That would be a knee-jerk reaction at this stage. England must now regroup and get some runs. 

Since Lords, the only player outside the squad to have advanced his case for inclusion is Paul Collingwood, best known as a one-day specialist. 

The allrounder, whose only two Test appearances to date came in Sri Lanka two years ago, scored 190 and 181 for Durham in the County Championship against Derbyshire and Somerset, respectively. 

Collingwood could well find himself in the 12-man squad Sunday at the expense of uncapped Hampshire fast bowler Chris Tremlett. 

But for Collingwood to play, England would have to drop one of their Lords bowlers, with left-arm spinner Ashley Giles and Matthew Hoggard the likely candidates. 

Replacing Giles with Collingwood is a risky move as it would leave England without a specialist slow bowler although it would strengthen the fielding of a side that dropped seven catches at Lords. 

Probable squad 

Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan (captain), Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones (wicketkeeper), Ashley Giles, Matthew Hoggard, Stephen Harmison, Simon Jones, Paul Collingwood.

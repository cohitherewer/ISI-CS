 Beckham on a mission to win over America

 - Everywhere we go, hes ten times bigger than anyone else: Eriksson

Singing from the same New York song sheet as Frank Sinatra, David Beckham believes that if he can make it here, he can make it anywhere. The Beckham charm machine rolled into the Big Apple Sunday on a whistle-stop tour to promote Brand Beckham, as well as taking in an England match against Colombia. 

A crowd of 500 noisy schoolchildren, many in football boots, scampered into Giants Stadium to watch Beckham train Monday, the fans rushing behind one goal when he lined up to fire free-kicks at Robert Green. The Norwich City goalkeeper proved a resilient human wall before Beckham found his range, drawing whoops and hollers from the admiring throng as his shots curled into the back of the net. 

Real Madrids No. 23 is big box-office over here. The success of the film Bend It Like Beckham propelled his name in the consciousness of Uncle Sams children. Even when thousands of miles away, Beckhams presence could be felt here. 

His marriage to Victoria Adams, aka Posh Spice, raised his profile further. New Yorks Daily News, a publication more obsessed with slam-dunks, home runs, touchdowns and power plays, are so interested in Beckham that they mocked up a full-page photo of him in the kit of the New York MetroStars, the local Major League Soccer franchise. They even mooted the idea of his moving to the MLS before retiring, a slightly ambitious suggestion, particularly with MLS clubs having a salary cap of $280,000 a year. Beckham rakes that in every fortnight with Real Madrid. 

Americas fascination with Englands glamorous captain has not gone unnoticed by his squad-mates. He is such a world star, said Phil Neville, his old Manchester United colleague. You can be a star in England but when you come to America you can be lost. But with David it is a different ball-game. He is known throughout the world. 

As an individual I think it is very difficult (to become recognised in America). You have some of the best pop stars try and break America and they struggle. It is such a huge country. 

Beckham has never shied away from a challenge, particularly when it comes to using his personal charm to woo a foreign land. No other English footballer has ever really made it big over here, he said. 

Id love to be well-known in America. Id love to be recognised over here. 

The American people are so patriotic about their teams and their sports ? more so than anywhere else in the world. I like the way the people are, the way they look up to Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. I am sure they criticise, but not to the extent that they put their own people and their own stars down. That is what is nice. 

Beckham appreciates the size of the task facing those trying to make football flourish in America. The United States Soccer Federation even had to pay the broadcasters to screen Englands friendly with the US in Chicago on Saturday. 

It will be hard, Beckham told a magazine. The American people love basketball, baseball, ice hockey and American football. Football isnt one of their major sports. I am surprised, because the facilities over in America are amazing and their womens team does really well, but I dont see why in the future it cant change. Its just another challenge for me to try to get noticed over here. 

Beckhams courtship of America was assisted Sunday by his greatest advocate, Sven-Goran Eriksson, who invited the local media to breakfast and expounded his views on his favourite player. For me, he is one of the best footballers in the world, the England manager said. 

David is the most famous football player you will find in the world. But when he is on the field he is precisely the same as the others ? working hard. He is no diva. My friends in Spain were extremely surprised by how professional was his approach to football. 

Such a comment will hardly be greeted with smiles of delight or nods of agreement by certain members of Erikssons team. Beckham remains a huge star but others are on the rise, and are eclipsing him on the field. Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard are more central, figuratively as well as tactically, to Englands ambitions going into a World Cup year than the famous figure to their right. 

Beckhams free-kicks will be important in Germany in 2006, but the men driving England are now Lampard and Gerrard. Despite the presence of other potential captains in the side, Eriksson remains resolute in his support of Beckham. 

The idea that I would think about changing captains is fairly silly, he stressed. 

I have other players who could be captain but, for me, David is the perfect captain. And on the field you cant find another right foot like this: corner-kicks, free-kicks, and crosses. 

As Green was discovering, that right foot is a venomous weapon. Whether Beckham can bend America around his little finger remains to be seen.

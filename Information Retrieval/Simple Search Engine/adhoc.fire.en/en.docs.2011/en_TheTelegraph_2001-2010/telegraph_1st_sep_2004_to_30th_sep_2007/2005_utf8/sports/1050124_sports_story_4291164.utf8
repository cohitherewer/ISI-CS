Madrid: Barcelona extended their lead over second-placed Real Madrid to 10 points in the Primera Liga with a 3-0 home win over Racing Santander on Saturday. 

Barca took the lead after just eight minutes when Cameroon striker Samuel Eto?o raced on to a pass from midfielder Xavi and coolly slotted the ball through the legs of goalkeeper Dudu. 

Despite dominating the early possession Barcelona failed to press home their advantage against a defensively-minded Racing side languishing near the bottom of the table. Mexican midfielder Rafael Marquez and 2004 World Player of the Year Ronaldinho both squandered clear opportunities. 

However, the Brazilian, playing his 50th game for the club, soon produced a bit of magic to notch their second in the 75th minute when he created the space to drill a long-range strike into the bottom right corner beyond the outstretched Dudu. 

The third goal came courtesy of another shot from distance, this time by Portugal midfielder Deco whose effort looped over the stranded Dudu after taking a deflection off a defender. 

Their comfortable victory at the Nou Camp stretched Barcelona?s unbeaten run at home to a year. 

In Saturday?s late game, Athletic Bilbao came from 0-3 down to secure a dramatic 4-3 home victory over mid-table rivals Osasuna, who are also chasing a UEFA Cup spot. 

Osasuna took the lead, thanks to a curling shot by Uruguayan midfielder Pablo Garcia in the 15th minute and looked to have the game won after the break with a header from Pierre Achille Webo and a thundering 30-metre free kick by Francisco Punal. 

But Athletic?s inspirational Spanish playmaker Francisco Yeste dragged them back into the match by notching two goals in four minutes just after the hour, including a curling 25-metre free kick that sailed into the top right hand corner of the net. 

Tiko equalised after 84 minutes before late substitute Julen Guerrero secured the unlikeliest of victories five minutes later with a deft volley to the delight of the San Mames crowd. 

The win takes Athletic up one place to eighth in the standings, while Osasuna slip to ninth. 

In Serie A action, Inter Milan preserved their unbeaten record this season as they came from behind to draw 1-1 with Chievo Verona at the San Siro on Saturday. 

Inter?s run of 19 games without defeat seemed on the verge of ending when Chievo defender Davide Mandelli volleyed the visitors into the lead from a corner in the 73rd minute. Ten minutes later, however, 20-year-old striker Obafemi Martins equalised when he fired home from close range after Alvaro Recoba?s long-range effort bounced loose in the box. 

The result, which was Inter?s 14th draw in 20 games, meant the Italian giants remained fourth in the table on 32 points, 12 behind leaders Juventus. 

Despite starting with a strike trio of Christian Vieri, Martins and Recoba, Inter struggled to threaten the Chievo goal in a sterile first half. 

Their clearest chance arrived on the stroke of halftime, when Recoba curled a free kick against the post and teammate Dejan Stankovic blasted the rebound over an open goal. 

Vieri did put the ball in the net shortly after the restart but it was ruled offside and it was Chievo who took the lead through Mandelli?s fine strike. 

Martins? equaliser raised the possibility of another Inter comeback like that against Sampdoria earlier this month, when they overturned a 0-2 deficit in the 88th minute to win 3-2. 

Instead, it was Chievo who almost netted a late winner when ex-Inter winger Luciano hit the post five minutes from time. 

Earlier, Bologna rose to ninth with a 1-0 win over Cagliari in a match they dominated, with striker Claudio Bellucci forcing Gennaro Iezza into reflex saves twice before halftime. 

Cagliari started the second half more brightly but in the 70th minute midfielder Leonardo Colucci found Bellucci unmarked on the left of the area and he blasted the winner past Iezza. 

In the French Ligue 1, Monaco outclassed a weak RC Lens 2-0 on Saturday to put pressure on second-placed Lille. First-half goals by Javier Saviola and Maicon were enough for the principality team to join Lille on 39 points. 

Monaco will overtake their northern rivals if Lille lose at home to champions Lyon, the only unbeaten team in top flight. (Reuters)

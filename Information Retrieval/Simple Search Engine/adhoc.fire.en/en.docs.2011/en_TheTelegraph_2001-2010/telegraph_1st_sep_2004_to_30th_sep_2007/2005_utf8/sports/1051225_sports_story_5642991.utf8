Calcutta: As the news broke out, the hundred-odd fans who gathered in front of his Behala residence, leapt in joy and smeared each other with vermillion. They danced, distributed sweets, capturing a scene that was only a small part of bigger celebrations across the state. 

Incidentally, the man in question, Sourav Ganguly, was not at home when the the BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah announced his name as one of Team Indias 16 members for the Test series against Pakistan. He, however, soon returned, to a heros welcome, to the chanting of long live Sourav. 

Sourav smiled before being brought inside the house. He later came out to say that he was happy, to be part of Team India again. 

I am very happy to be back in the side just like any other player in a similar situation, he said, addressing the waiting media. He deftly ducked the query whether this comeback was in any way similar to the one he had made in 1996. 

 But the man, who led the team to a triumphant march in both ODI and Test series during the last Pakistan tour, quickly got into business, maintaining that the team would also fare well this time around. 

Last time when we had toured Pakistan we won against them and this time also, I hope we will do well, Sourav said.

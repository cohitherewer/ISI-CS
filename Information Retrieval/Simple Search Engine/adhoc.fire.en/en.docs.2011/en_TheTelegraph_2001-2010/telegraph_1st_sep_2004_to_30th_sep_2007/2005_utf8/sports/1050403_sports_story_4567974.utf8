 Al-Hussein land with full strength 

Margao: Jordan?s Al-Hussein club arrived here Saturday morning with a full-strength team to play their AFC Cup away match against Federation Cup champions Dempo Wednesday. 

Talking to reporters on arrival, Al-Hussein team manager Fahmi Roshan Bahram Naimi said his team was confident of winning over Dempo although they needed just a draw to top the table at the end of the first leg. 

?We know Dempo inside out as we had sent our coach Osama Ahmed Alsheikh Qasem to Beirut to watch Dempo?s match vs Al Ahed which Dempo lost 0-1,? he said. 

?Our aim is to collect full points and we have come four days in advance to get a feel of the climatic condition as it is very humid and hot here compared to the climate back home which is very cool,? Naimi said. 

When asked if they would try to win with a big margin, Naimi said: ?We cannot expect to win all the time with a big margin and Dempo are considered a good side.? 

Al-Hussein have three foreigners in their rank, Egyptian defenders Ibrahim Sedki and Ahmed Hassan Abdalla and Iraqi Mazin Mushen (midfielder). They were ranked third in the ongoing national league behind Al-Wihdat and Al-Faysal. (PTI)

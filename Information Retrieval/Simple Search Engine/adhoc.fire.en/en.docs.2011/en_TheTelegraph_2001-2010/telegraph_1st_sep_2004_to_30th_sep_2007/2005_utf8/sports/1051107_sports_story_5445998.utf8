The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Suresh Raina focusing on consistency

 - I dont allow expectations to weigh me down 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Ahmedabad: Suresh Raina hadnt done much to hit the headlines before the Pune one-dayer, but his match-winning unbeaten 39 made a lot of people sit up and take notice on Thursday. The new kid on the block showed maturity beyond his years to pull off the series win along with Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

So impressed was Rahul Dravid that he described them as the future of Indian batting. Sri Lankan coach Tom Moody went a step further, saying Raina played better in the unbroken 82-run partnership. 

The 18-year-old from Uttar Pradesh, however, does not wish to read much into it and feels the journey has just begun. I still have a lot to learn. I am working hard on my fitness as well as the other technical aspects of the game. I need to perform consistently to prosper, Raina told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

The left-hander, who made his debut in the tri-series in Sri Lanka this year, does not wish to pick the Pune effort as his best. Ive hardly done anything of note to term it as memorable? My best is yet to come. Ive just started my career and theres still lot of cricket left. 

Im happy to have contributed to the teams cause. It was a great feeling and I enjoyed the occasion. Weve had a good beginning to the series and should try and continue in the same vein, the modest Raina remarked. 

Dhoni should take a lot of the credit for the partnership. He guided me throughout and I was just content to play the supporting role. We kept rotating the strike and it worked, he added. 

The youngest of four brothers and one sister, Rainas parents are now settled in Ghaziabad. Life hasnt changed much? Everything is the same except that I am travelling a lot. Everyone is happy with my success and feel honoured that Sonu (pet name) is representing the country, he said. 

With expectations bound to rise every time he walks out to bat, is he feeling the pressure? I dont allow expectations to weigh me down. I always concentrate on the next game and forget what happened previously, he said. 

How does he prepare himself before a game? I focus on the match and think positively. I also set targets and try to fulfil them. I also make it a point to go off to bed early. 

Raina is grateful to Greg Chappell for his guidance. Hes been an inspiration and has helped me immensely? I owe a lot to him.

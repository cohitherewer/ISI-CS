Yokohoma: Athens Olympic gold-medallist Justin Gatlin defended his 100m title while Allyson Felix won the womens event to make it an American sprint double at the Yokohama track and field meet on Monday. 

Gatlin clocked 10.04 seconds to beat Olusoji Fasuba of Nigeria to second and Christopher Williams of Jamaica to third place with the two in a photo-finish at 10.13. 

World 200m champion Felix won the womens 100m in 11.05, beating her compatriot Melisa Barber and Julia Chermoshanskaiya of Russia. 

My hamstring was a little bit tight about 20 metres to the finishing line, but it was a good race, I think my performance was good, the competition was great, said the 23-year-old American. 

Gatlin, also the 100m and 200m world champion, had travelled from Shanghai after winning the inaugural Grand Prix on Saturday but appeared satisfied with his performance at the end of the season. 

Im very pleased with my season this year. I think this season is even better than 2004, said Gatlin. Chinas world silver-medallist Liu Xiang and other world champions duly won their events, but pole vault queen Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia failed to clear 4.50 metres. 

I was so tired. I had a lot of competition, I won the summer and winter world championships, I set new world records, and I tried to do my best today, but couldnt, said Isinbayeva, who also travelled from Shanghai. 

Tatiana Grigorieva of Australia won the pole vault with a mark of 4.10m. (AFP)

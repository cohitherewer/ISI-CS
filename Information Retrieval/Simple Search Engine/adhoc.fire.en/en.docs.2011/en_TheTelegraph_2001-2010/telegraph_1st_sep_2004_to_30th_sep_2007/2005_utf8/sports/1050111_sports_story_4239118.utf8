 Inzamam, Shoaib face fitness race 

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Melbourne: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and leading paceman Shoaib Akhtar are both doubtful for Sunday?s triangular one-day series match against Australia owing to back injuries, Inzamam said on Monday. 

Shoaib has had pain-killing injections for back and hamstring complaints and would miss the two midweek warm-up matches against Australia A, Inzamam told reporters in Adelaide. 

Australia will open the one-day series against the West Indies in Melbourne on Friday, ahead of Sunday?s game in Hobart. 

?He (Shoaib) has gone to the doctor and he?s taken injections today,? Inzamam said on Monday. ?Hopefully, with 72 hours rest, after that he is feeling well. 

?He had an epidural in the back, hopefully he?s alright in the first game.? 

The 34-year-old Inzamam said he would play in Wednesday?s 50-overs per side game and Thursday?s Twenty20 match against Australia A in Adelaide before making a decision on his fitness for the triangular clash. 

?We?re playing two practice games and we?ll try really hard to win both games because winning is a habit,? Inzamam said. ?After the Test series we were really disappointed, but I think that is in the past now. 

?It?s a new thing, it?s different to Test matches, the one-day game and hopefully the boys really come hard on Wednesday.? 

Pakistan was also waiting to see whether allrounder Shoaib Malik would be cleared to bowl in the series. Malik is currently doing remedial work in Perth, after twice being reported in matches last year for having a suspect action, and will miss the games against Australia A.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We have firepower to rattle India

 Straight Talk

 Arjuna Ranatunga

 I read with interest that Rahul 

 Dravid wants a quickish pitch at Kotla for the second Test. 

 It is a legitimate concern for an under-prepared spinning 

 track could well play into Muralis hands. It is a 

 Test, not a one-dayer, and Murali would not be too concerned 

 about wides or the number of overs he can bowl. He can keep 

 as many fielders around the bat as he wants.

 Even in the one-dayers, which 

 not only brought a loss of face to the Sri Lankans but a 

 slip in rankings as well, Murali was a shining exception. 

 He was rarely clobbered, not even in Jaipur where Mahendra 

 Singh Dhoni scripted that career-defining 180-odd. It is 

 not easy to hit him for fours, more so when the ball is 

 turning square.

 The champion in Murali would like 

 to leave his mark on the tour. The 1-6 mauling in the one-day 

 series must have hurt his pride and he knows he wont 

 have too many India tours after this one. His bowling average 

 against the Indians, too, does not match with his superlative 

 figures against the rest.

 I guess he would imagine its 

 time for redemption. He could not ask for more than a spinning 

 pitch where it is difficult for batsmen to attack off the 

 backfoot.

 If I am allowed to linger on Murali 

 a little longer, I must say he is the best spinner I have 

 come across in my career. It is not a slight to Shane Warne 

 and the rest, but just a personal opinion. One, he has done 

 it in such a short time and secondly, I believe umpires 

 in England and Australia give a batsman out leg-before even 

 when he is playing on the frontfoot. In our sub-continent 

 conditions, spinners are rarely rewarded thus.

 There is also little flashy or 

 uppish about the man. He is innocent to a fault and a smile 

 never leaves his face. He is a man with a big heart and 

 transparent honesty. The piercing eyes at the top of his 

 bowling run-up is not an effort to intimidate a batsman 

 but just to focus his energies on the job ahead. He also 

 never sledges which cannot be said about the likes of Warne 

 and others.

 I believe Sri Lankans have the 

 firepower to rattle the Indians in Delhi. Vaas, Murali and 

 Fernando are all matchwinners. But they must stick to their 

 attacking style of play rather than bowl defensively. In 

 Chennai, they concentrated on keeping the ball on the stumps 

 and took the pace off their deliveries which was sensible 

 since the ball was keeping low and batsmen could only show 

 the full face of the bat.

 Skipper Maravan Atapattus 

 insistence to come down the order could well be an attempt 

 to shore up the middle and lower order. However, as I said 

 earlier, the better way to ensure the well-being of the 

 middle order is to provide stability at the top and it is 

 a job which Atapattu has done with distinction all these 

 years.

 A few superstars are close to 

 personal landmarks: Anil Kumble and Murali are nearing 100 

 Tests, Vaas within striking distance of 300 scalps and Sachin 

 Tendulkar whom everyone is egging on to go for his 35th 

 Test century.

 I dont remember having played 

 a Test in Delhi, though the 1996 World Cup ODI was a special 

 one. It was a defining moment of our graph as we stunned 

 the Indians, despite a superlative century from Tendulkar. 

 One hopes when the Lankans move on from the capital, they 

 have a similar sense of deja vu. (PTI)

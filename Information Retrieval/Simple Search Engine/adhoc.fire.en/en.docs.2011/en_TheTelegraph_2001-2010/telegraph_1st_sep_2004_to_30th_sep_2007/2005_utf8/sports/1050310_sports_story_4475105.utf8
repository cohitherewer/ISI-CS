 Dravid my favourite: Sharmila

 Sharmila 

Mohali: Rahul Dravid is the current favourite of Sharmila Tagore, the former first lady of Indian cricket. 

?I was an M.L. Jaisimha fan in my younger days. Now, my favourite cricketer is Dravid,? said the actress-wife of Mansur Ali Khan Pat -audi. 

?I come from Bengal where they are mad about this game, in fact, every sport? I loved cricket much before I got married to Tiger. I especially like the Test format,? Sharmila said on the sidelines of the first India versus Pakistan Test here at the PCA Stadium. (PTI)

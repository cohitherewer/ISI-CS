 Im taking a big risk, says Leander Paes

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

Such an injury normally takes two-three months to heal, but Im lucky? But I have to be very, very careful. I cant dive, I cant stretch too much, said Paes. As of now, Im playing mens doubles? will decide about the mixed after reaching there this weekend. 

Meanwhile, mens runner-up Andy Roddick was promoted from his ranking of four Wednesday to be named second seed. American Roddick was elevated above 2002 winner and world number two Lleyton Hewitt.

 Lara return boosts Windies

Port-of-Spain: West Indies, buoyed by their performance in the first Test and the return of four key players, will be looking to go the full distance and win the second Test against South Africa that starts Friday. 

And with Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Chris Gayle and Dwayne Bravo back after settling their sponsorship dispute, West Indies will be hoping to for victory. 

?We went in as underdogs and we nearly pulled off a victory and that?s a big positive,? said Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who has been appointed West Indies captain for the remainder of the series against the South Africa and Pakistan to follow. 

West Indies have retained Pedro Collins, Daren Powell and Reon King, the same fast bowling personnel they played at Georgetown, but Bravo with his up-tempo medium-pace, Gayle with his off-spin darts, and Sarwan with his leg-spin floaters offer Chanderpaul a bit more variety, if not penetration. 

The home team will however, miss the steady left-arm spin bowling of Ryan Hinds, who fell ill Wednesday and has been replaced by Test newcomer Donovon Pagon. 

South Africa will again be without veteran fast bowler Shaun Pollock. The selectors have asked him to prove his fitness in a domestic match before dispatching him to the Caribbean, but there are adequate bowling choices for smith with Makhaya Ntini and Andre Nel to lead the way.

 Langer, Hayden complete centuries

 - England made to toil on another rain-marred day

London: Openers Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden scored centuries in the deciding fifth Ashes Test but Australias hopes of ramming home their advantage were hit by the weather on Saturday. 

The world champions, replying to Englands 373 and needing to win at The Oval to level the series 2-2 and retain the Ashes, took their score from 112 without loss to 277 for two, still 96 behind. 

Repeated downpours followed by bad light reduced the day to just 45.4 of the scheduled 98 overs of play. Hayden was unbeaten on 110 at close with Damien Martyn batting on nine. 

Langer and Hayden underlined their reputation as one of the great Test opening partners with a 185-run stand, surpassing their previous best of 58 in the series. 

It was the sixth time the two had scored centuries in the same Test, an unrivalled feat. For Hayden, it was a dramatic return to form. His position was under threat after failing to score a century in his last 30 Test innings. 

Langer was the first to reach three figures but he fell immediately afterwards for 105 after being peppered by a volley of short balls from Steve Harmison. 

Ricky Ponting then added 79 with Hayden before falling for 35, caught in the gully after being surprised by the bounce as Andrew Flintoff returned to the attack deep into the final session. 

Langer had reversed roles with the big-hitting Hayden by taking the initiative from the start of the innings. He took four hours to reach his 22nd Test century, striking 11 fours and two sixes, both off left-arm spinner Ashley Giles. 

Hayden salvaged his wretched tour by replacing aggression with caution for a 21st Test century. It took him 76 balls more and around 50 minutes longer than his partner. The weather may have been against the Australians ? each of the three sessions was hit by rain or bad light ? but they had more than their share of luck out in the middle 

Matthew Hoggard, indeed, thought he had got Langer lbw with the first ball of the day but the batsman was given benefit of the doubt.

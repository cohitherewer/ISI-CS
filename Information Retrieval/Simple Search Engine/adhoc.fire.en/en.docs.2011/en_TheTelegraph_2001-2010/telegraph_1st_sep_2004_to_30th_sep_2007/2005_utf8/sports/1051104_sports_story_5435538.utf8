 Frankfurt: Some 150,000 of the best seats at the 2006 World Cup, including tickets for the final, remain unsold and are available for public purchase. But fans wishing to jump the queue and guarantee tickets ahead of the next sales lottery should check their credit ratings carefully.

 Prices start at 1,900 euros ($2,281) plus sales tax for a package that will get you into three early-round games, and go up to 336,000 euros ($403,300) for a 20-person box at all six matches in Berlin?s Olympic Stadium, including the final. A Swiss-based company holds the rights to sell a total of 346,950 tickets in a variety of hospitality packages following a public tender from Fifa.

 Paris: Nicolas Anelka earned a surprise recall by France for their friendly internationals against Costa Rica on November 9 in Martinique and Germany three days later at the Stade de France. Anelka, who had said he ruled out an international return under coach Raymond Domenech, was in the squad for the two friendlies announced by Domenech on Thursday.

 The Fenerbahce striker has not played for France since he rejected a late call-up from former coach Jacques Santini for a friendly against Yugoslavia in Paris in November 2002. 

 Madrid: Real Madrid centre back Ivan Helguera will be out of action for two to three weeks with a muscle strain in his right leg, club doctors said on Wednesday.

 Helguera suffered the injury in training on the eve of Tuesday?s Champions League match at Rosenborg Trondheim and faces a race against time to play in the Primera Liga game with arch-rivals Barcelona on November 19.

 Helguera?s injury means Englishman Jonathan Woodgate is likely to retain his place in the starting line-up for this weekend?s league match at home to Real Zaragoza. 

 London: US broadcasters ABC/ESPN and Univision have agreed a record $425m deal to secure the US TV rights for all Fifa events between 2007 and 2014, world soccer?s governing body said on Wednesday.

 Fifa said the agreement, which incorporates coverage of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup tournaments, was the biggest TV deal with a single country in its history.

 Berlin: Promising German driver Nico Rosberg, the son of ex-Formula one champion Keke, will follow in his father?s footsteps and drive for Williams next season, the English team confirmed on Thursday.

 The 20-year-old Rosberg, winner of this year?s GP2 series championship, will join Mark Webber at Williams after impressing as a test driver.

 ?Rosberg has agreed a long term contract with the team,? said a Williams press release.

 Rosberg, who was born in Germany but lives in Monaco, became the youngest driver in Formula One history in 2002 when he did a one-off test for Williams as a raw 17-year-old.

 Rosberg has a lot to live up to with his Finnish father Keke winning the 1982 Formula One World Championship with the Williams team. 

 Boston: More than a year after the Athens Olympics, the Games? chief organiser says Greece is still reaping benefits from hosting the event despite its huge cost.

 ?I do believe the games paid off for Greece and Athens,? Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said in an interview on Wednesday. ?There have been so many changes for the better.?

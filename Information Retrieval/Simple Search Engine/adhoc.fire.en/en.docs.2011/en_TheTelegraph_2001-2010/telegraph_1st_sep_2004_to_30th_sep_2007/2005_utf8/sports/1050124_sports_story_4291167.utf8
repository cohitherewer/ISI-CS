The Telegraph - Calcutta

 10-man EB notch up maiden win

 - Malsawmtluanga, D?Cunha score against Churchill 

 Alvito had mixed fortunes in the match, scoring a goal and then receiving marching orders 

Margao: Defending champions East Bengal utilised the gaps provided by the Churchill Brothers defence to notch up their first win in the ninth National Football League (NFL) here on Sunday. Shylo Malsawmtluanga and Alvito D? Cunha found the nets for the holders. 

The 2-0 win took East Bengal to five points from three matches. Churchill Brothers suffered their second defeat and have just one point to show for after three outings. 

The visitors played the last 40 minutes with 10 men as Alvito D?Cunha was sent off after handling the ball. It was his second yellow card offence of the match. 

Churchill controlled the match for most of the 90 minutes, having more of the ball possession and scoring chances. But their strikers continued to miss one opportunity after other. They also failed to utilise their one-man advantage due to lack of proper planning. 

Churchill coach Shabbir Ali brought in veteran striker I.M. Vijayan and Mohammed Najeeb but even these changes did not bear fruit. 

The hosts started in right earnest and had a glorious chance to surge ahead but Yusif Yakubu failed to get past East Bengal custodian Rajat Ghosh Dastidar in the fifth minute. 

East Bengal celebrated the escape with a goal as Malsawmtlunga, who broke through the defence from the right got the better of defender Ryan D?Souza and unleashed a powerful right footer from inside the box to beat goalie Mark Mascranehas. 

Churchill, who pushed more men in the attack allowed space in the defence and East Bengal punished them as Climax Lawerence, who was adjudged the Man of the Match, slipped a through pass to Alvito on the left. Alvito beat a rival defender and showed deft placement to find the far corner of the net. 

Bhaichung Bhutia, who was well marked by Churchill defenders, had a chance on either side of the half time but saw his first attempt hit the upright in the dying minutes. 

The striker, meanwhile, collided with Churchill goalie, who was hurt on his head, had to be rushed to the hospital for medical attention. 

Mahindra confident 

Meanwhile, buoyed by their stunning 1-0 win over Mohun Bagan, Mahindra United will be looking for their second win when they take on Dempo Sport Club, Goa, at the Cooperage on Monday. 

Mahindra, who could just manage a draw in their opening match of the season against Churchill Brothers, will be further strengthened by the inclusion of their two foreign imports Brazilian Calisto Rodrigues and Nigerian Mike Okoro.

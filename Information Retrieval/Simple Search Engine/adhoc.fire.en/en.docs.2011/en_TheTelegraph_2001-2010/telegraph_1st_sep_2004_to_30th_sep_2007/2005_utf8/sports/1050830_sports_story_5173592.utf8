 NZ coach to return home

Harare: Coach John Bracewell is to return home from New Zealands tour of Zimbabwe following the death of his mother-in-law, team management said on Monday. 

Bracewell will leave Zimbabwe on Tuesday and will not be replaced. 

We feel we have the experience and skill within the squad to cope while John is away, New Zealand manager Lindsay Crocker said. 

The Black Caps play matches against Zimbabwe and India in Harare this week and are likely to qualify for next Tuesdays final. 

Bracewell will rejoin the squad in time for their tour of South Africa which starts in October.

 Jestrovic defends himself

Brussels: Anderlecht striker Nenad Jestrovic has vigorously defended himself against allegations that he racially abused Liverpools Momo Sissoko during the Champions League match at Anfield on Tuesday. 

Uefas Control and Disciplinary Body will hear the case on Monday after Danish referee Kim Milton Nielsen recorded an alleged incident of racial abuse in his official match report. 

Jestrovic had only been on the pitch five minutes when he was dismissed by Nielsen following a clash with Sissoko in which he allegedly racially abused the Liverpool player. 

In an interview, Jestrovic said he was willing to go to court to clear his name and accused Mali international Sissoko of changing his story and abusing him.What Sissoko has been saying in all the papers is not what he said after the game, the 29-year-old said. I have video evidence that will show him abusing me. 

Jestrovic said he was not a racist and described the red card as stupid. 

I have many black friends and black teammates. Sure, my strike partner is Mbo Mpenza and he is black, Jestrovic said. (REUTERS)

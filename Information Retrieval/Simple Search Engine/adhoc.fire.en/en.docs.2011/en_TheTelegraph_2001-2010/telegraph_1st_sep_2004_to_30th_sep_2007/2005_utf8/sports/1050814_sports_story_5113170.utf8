The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhanot at a loss to explain scandal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Athletics Federation of India (AFI) secretary Lalit Bhanot was at a loss for words trying to explain the Neelam Singh doping scandal. 

Had it been a junior athlete, I would have thought it was her inexperience and lack of education resulting in such a lapse? but Neelam is such a senior athlete who has competed in dozens of international meets and won so many medals too, Bhanot told The Telegraph from New Delhi. 

Being ranked in the top-20 or 30 for so many years, she has been tested at least 25 times all over the world as well as in Patiala and Ludhiana. Shes never tested positive, how come she did it now really beats me, said Bhanot. 

As far as the AFI is concerned, Neelam stands suspended though she will be given a chance to defend herself. Let her come back, well see what she has to say? But it the report is correct, shell get no mercy, Bhanot said. 

The AFI secretary refused to admit that the federation is not doing enough to control drugs abuse. We are doing everything that needs to be done? but maybe this is a lesson that we have to intensify our efforts, said Bhanot.

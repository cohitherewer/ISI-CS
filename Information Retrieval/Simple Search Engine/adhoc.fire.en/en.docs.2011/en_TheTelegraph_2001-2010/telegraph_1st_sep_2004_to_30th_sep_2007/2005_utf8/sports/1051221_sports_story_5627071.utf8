 - My game is all about improvisation, says Brazilian star

Ronaldinho rounded off a memorable year as he was named Fifas World Player of the Year for the second successive year in Zurich on Monday night. The award follows the Barcelona forwards selection as European Footballer of the Year. 

[He is the third Brazilian to win the world and European player awards in the same year after Ronaldo in 1997 and 2002, and Rivaldo in 1999, adds Reuters. 

Ronaldinho picked up 956 points to comfortably beat Chelseas England midfielder Frank Lampard (306) in the Fifa vote by national coaches and captains around the world. The Brazilians Barcelona teammate Samuel Eto of Cameroon finished in third place with 190 points.] 

Few would argue that Ronaldinho is the best player in the world, the Brazil international at times seeming to have re-invented football with his breathtaking skills, making the seemingly impossible appear straightforward. 

At a training session with Barcelona, Ronaldinho once struck the crossbar with four consecutive volleys. It was not poor finishing ? that was his intention. 

Occasionally he will play a one-two off the legs of a hapless opponent, while he has almost perfected running at a player, looking one way and passing the other. 

Im ugly but Ive got charm, he jokes, but when countryman Pele called football the beautiful game he could have had Ronaldinho in mind. 

My game is all about improvisation, said the master of the art. A striker must improvise all the time, which is why I am always attempting new dribbles. I work in training and try things. 

Barcelonas training sessions must be as entertaining as watching the Spanish champions on match days. Coach Frank Rijkaard gives Ronaldinho a free rein, not restricting him with complicated tactical instructions. 

When youre lucky enough to have a player like that in your team, you give him complete freedom to do what he wants, Rijkaard said. Its up to him whether he wants to go left, right or down the middle. He hasnt let me down and just amazes me game after game. 

Chelsea managed to overcome Ronaldinho and Barcelona in last seasons Champions League and the meeting of possibly Europes best defence and finest attack has football lovers counting the days until Februarys first-leg showdown at the Nou Camp. 

Whatever the bitterness between the clubs sparked by comments from Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho last season, Ronaldinho will surely be applauded by the Stamford Bridge faithful as he was in the Bernabeu after he scored two goals in a virtuoso performance as Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-0. 

On Monday night, after being named runner-up, Lampard called for last seasons fractious encounter between Chelsea and Barcelona not to overshadow the re-run. 

It will be two of the best teams in Europe playing against each other in Europe and that should be what matters, not what happens off the pitch, he said. 

We are desperate to win. We have lost in the semi-finals two years running and we know Barcelona will be one of the toughest teams we could meet. 

Ronaldinho described the games as the match of the year, adding: Everyone who loves football should enjoy two great matches. 

Eto believed neither side could be regarded as favourites. They have their style of playing football and we have a different way. I just hope our home ground will be in our favour.

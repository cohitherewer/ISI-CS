 Flintoffs knock was better than Strauss

 Pietersen rsquo;s hubris seems to be getting the better of him

Apart from Andrew Strauss and Andrew Flintoff, the batting was very disappointing on Thursday and there is no doubt it was not a good day for England. 

They won the toss on a dry pitch with the sun shining and had the perfect opportunity to bat well and control the Test. 

Australia will be over the moon with what has happened on the first day. Ive always said that winning the toss is no good unless you bat well, and as a team, England have let the opportunity slip away. 

Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen played poor shots. Vaughan chipped to mid-wicket playing against the spin and Pietersen played across the line. Before arriving at the crease they had plenty of opportunity to see Shane Warne bowling and spinning the ball. 

When it is turning, playing against the spin is fraught with danger and they brought about their own downfall. Paul Collingwood got a bad decision. The ball hit him more than five inches outside off stump and he was playing a shot, but the Aussies have had some stinkers in previous Test matches. 

Ian Bell, for all his good looking technique, doesnt give me the impression that he is going to make many runs or spend long at the crease. Im not confident that he is picking Warne. 

Collingwoods selection was always a gamble because he has only played in two Tests before this and he has not appeared for two years. 

He has not been able to force his way into the side and other players have jumped ahead of him such as Bell, Rob Key and Pietersen. As a one-day player he is excellent but Test cricket is a completely different game. 

Pietersens hubris seems to be getting the better of him. He wants to be the superstar, he wants the acclaim and the adulation but he has not yet put in the performances to back up that attitude. 

He should not change his batting but he should have a good look at the way he gets out and he has got to start playing straighter in Test cricket. One can get away with playing against the spin occasionally but with that tactic, I know who I would back in most situations and that is the bloke with more than 600 Test wickets. 

Warne probably goes to bed at night dreaming about batsmen playing against his leg-spin. 

So far more than 80 England wickets have fallen in this series and Warne has got nearly half of them. Through the stump microphone we could hear him goading Strauss about how much he was playing and missing. 

Strauss will be happy to play and miss if it means he is going to get a hundred. Strangely enough, I thought Flintoffs was the better knock. He hardly played a false shot and he came to the crease with his side under real pressure but he played with great composure. 

Strauss best shots were using the pace of the quick bowlers and back-cutting them through gully. When you get a fast bouncy pitch such as here at the Oval or the one at Perth you are better off hitting the ball late and using the pace of the fast bowlers rather than trying to hit it too square. 

I thought the Aussie fast bowlers missed a trick or two. They did not pitch the ball up enough to Strauss. He was allowed to score runs square of the wicket off the back foot. He teased the bowlers all day long by trying to drive outside off stump and they should have kept bowling to that weakness. 

But Strauss showed resilience to carry on when he played and missed. He just forgot about it and played the next ball. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

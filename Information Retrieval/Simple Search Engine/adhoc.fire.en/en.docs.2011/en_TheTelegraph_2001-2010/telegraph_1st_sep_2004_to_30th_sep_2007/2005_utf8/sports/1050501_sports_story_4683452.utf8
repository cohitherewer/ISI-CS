 Sami robbed

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Mohammed Sami was robbed of nearly Rs 1.5 million (approximately Rs 10 lakh) in an early-morning dacoity, police officials said. 

?Mohammed Sami?s elder brother has lodged a first information report (FIR) in which they have reported that four masked dacoits broke the locks (of their house) early on Saturday morning and robbed them. The exact amount has not been mentioned in the FIR,? a police officer said. 

When contacted, Sami said: ?We estimate that the robbers took away nearly Rs 1.5 million worth of prize bonds, defence saving certificates, American dollars and jewellery.? 

Earlier this week, team physiotherapist Eric Johnson was robbed of nearly Rs 1 million in a daylight heist during which his family was held hostage.

 Dempo coach points finger at own player 

 - NATIONAL LEAGUE- Visitors paid penalty for under-estimating us, feels Bhowmick

Calcutta: Dempo coach Armando Colaco was understandably dejected after Mondays 1-2 loss to East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Winning the National League is no longer solely in their hands now. Sporting Clube de Goa will walk away with the honours if they beat Mahindra United on Friday, irrespective of what Dempo or East Bengal do in their last matches. 

While admitting at the very outset that East Bengal played better football and he had no excuse to offer, Colaco actually ended up offering quite a few. One of them, in fact, amounted to a serious charge against one of his players (Clifford Miranda). 

Clifford is almost sure of joining East Bengal next season. Hes one of my best players but looked a total stranger today? he didnt take any risk, the coach observed, hinting that the medio didnt deliberately produce his best. 

East Bengal officials came under attack as well. With the championship issue still open, they (East Bengal) have been talking to our players for next seasons recruitment. This is not done. I and my club could have done the same thing? said an angry Colaco. 

But why did he field Miranda in the first place? I dont have enough replacements, he said less than convincingly, adding that his players are not mature enough to handle such pressures. 

Returning to the match proper, the Dempo coach said weather conditions affected his players. It was too humid, maybe that was a factor. 

Both East Bengal goals, felt Colaco, were gifted by his defence. Also, the early injury to Riston (Rodrigues) was a blow. He controls our midfield, we couldnt compensate for his absence. 

Colaco noted that East Bengal are usually uneasy playing against Dempo, but that didnt mean his team had under-estimated the Calcutta side. How can we take them lightly, especially when they are playing at home? No team in the NFL is weak. 

Subhas Bhowmick maintained that Dempo had paid the penalty for under-estimating East Bengal. 

We gave them a pinch today? they were talking too big. They must have realised its not easy to come to Calcutta and beat teams like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. 

The East Bengal coach thanked his players for rising to the occasion. I am really grateful to my boys. I had asked for three goals, and should have got those, said Bhowmick. 

Having denied first-phase hattrick hero Ranty Martins a goal at Salt Lake Stadium, Bhowmick said: He was being a loudmouth, but now he will know how difficult its to score in both matches against us. Even someone like Jose Ramirez Barreto couldnt do that.

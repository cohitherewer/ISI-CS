Calcutta: Around 30 budding chess aspirants learnt the intricacies of the game from Grandmaster P. Harikrishna, who took them on simultaneously in Tata Steel all-India Open rapid chess meet here at The Regency on Friday. 

Four GMs, one WGM and 15 IMs are participating in the highest-ever prize money rapid meet in India, organised by the Chess Players Association of India (CPAI). 

Almost all the star players won their first round games with ease, apart from IM P. Konguvel, who went down to city-based Atanu Chakraborty. 

Meanwhile, the CPAI has decided to formally approach the AICF for recognition. It has also demanded that the mens and womens champions in the national A meets be co-opted in the AICF central committee for a particular year with voting rights. The CPAI AGM held on Friday saw Barua being unanimously re-elected president, and GM P Harikrishna secretary.

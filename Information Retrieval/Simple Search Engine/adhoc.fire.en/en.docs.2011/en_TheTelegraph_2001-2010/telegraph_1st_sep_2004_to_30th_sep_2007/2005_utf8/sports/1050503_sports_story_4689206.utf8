 Record victory for Els

 Ernie Els on Monday 

Shanghai: Jeev Milkha Singh faltered on the tough and demanding final back-nine and barely managed a top-10 finish though he was looking good for a better show at the storm-affected $1.5 million BMW Asian Open. 

Jeev Milkha dropped a bogey on 14th and a double bogey on 16th to end up with a two-over 74 for the day and a total of seven-under 281 when play concluded Monday after darkness had forced stoppage at the Pudong golf course on Sunday. 

Though he was disappointed, this was Jeev Milkha?s fifth top-10 finish in 11 starts since the Volvo Masters of Asia in mid-December. In 2005, he has had three top-10s. 

Jyoti Randhawa, who looked like getting into top-10, dropped crucial shots on 15th and 17th and ended tied 16th. 

Even as others struggled, world No. 3 Ernie Els returned seven-under 65 in the final round to claim his third title in Asia this year. Els led from the opening day and completed 72 holes in a tournament-record 26-under-par 262 to win by 13 strokes. 

His margin of victory was a new Asian Tour record and the second largest in an event sanctioned by the European Tour behind the 15-shot win posted by Tiger Woods at the 2000 US Open. Els had earlier won after the Dubai Classic and the Qatar Masters. 

Briton Simon Wakefield was a distant second totalling 275 and Dane Thomas Bjorn with 276. Jean-Francois Lucquin and Korea-born Kiwi Eddie Lee tied for fourth, while Luke Donald and Stuart Little with birdies on two closing holes, tied for sixth. (Agencies)

 Randhawa tied 36th 

San Francisco: Jyoti Randhawa played a steady par round of 70 to be tied at 36th place after the second round of the American Express Championship at the par-70 Harding Park course here. 

The 2002 Asian Tour No. 1 carded three birdies against as many bogeys in the second round of the elite 71-man field battling for a total purse of $7.5 million. Randhawas two-day total of 140 is seven shots behind halfway leader Colin Montgomerie, who added a 69 to his opening 64. 

Montgomerie who led by three overnight is now the leader by one from Englands David Howell and John Daly of the US while world No. 1 Tiger Woods is a further stroke back in fourth place after a 68. 

Randhawa had birdies on fourth, tenth and 15th holes and he dropped shots on the first, sixth and 17th. 

His driving accuracy let him down, managing just 50 per cent and he reached 56 per cent greens in regulation. 

Asian Tour member Simon Yates of Scotland, who gained entry into the event after finishing third in last years Order of Merit, bounced back with a superb 68 in a round that included five birdies. (PTI)

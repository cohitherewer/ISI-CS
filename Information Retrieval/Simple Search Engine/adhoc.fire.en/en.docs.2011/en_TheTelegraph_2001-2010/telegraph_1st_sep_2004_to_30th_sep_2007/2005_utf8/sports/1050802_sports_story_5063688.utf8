The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indians failed to impress

Straight Talk 

Arjuna Ranatunga

 Indias reshuffled batting 

 order for the second match of the tri-series was the talk 

 of the evening in Dambulla on Sunday. With the exception 

 of Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid, it seemed anybody could 

 walk in into the middle. 

 While the guessing game has its 

 own merit in a boring game, I still am not impressed with 

 the Indian tactics. To me, it looked like they panicked.

 When a team is selected, selectors, 

 coach and captain thrash out the details behind closed doors 

 and the first thing they do is to look at the balance of 

 the side. 

 They decide who two should open 

 the innings, who should occupy the middle order, the wicketkeeper, 

 bowlers, and so on. But here it was a lottery. 

 I felt happy for Mohammed Kaif 

 that he was tried out in the openers slot. But the 

 balance of the line-up was awry.

 The Indian youngsters are loaded 

 with potential but you must not throw them into the deep 

 end when they do not know how to swim. Ideally, the batting 

 slots should have a mix of experience and youth, the balancing 

 factor must never be overlooked.

 Sehwag and Dhoni as openers; Dravid 

 at No. 3 to shepherd in the young Raina at No. 4; Kaif to 

 go with Venugopal Rao and Yuvraj Singh to follow ? that 

 is the kind of blend Indians should have opted for. 

 In the end, it appeared easy but 

 we would never know the outcome of this experiment if Raina 

 was held on the off-side while still waiting to open his 

 account.

 The other thing which caught my 

 eye in the evening will gladden Indian hearts. They should 

 rejoice at the presence of their three left-arm pacemen. 

 These three were terrific and could form one of the most 

 potent bowling attacks in the next World Cup. 

 It does not matter they do not 

 offer variety. Cricket always advocates that your best bowlers 

 should play. If they are all left-armers, so be it. You 

 do not have to bring a right-armer in just for the heck 

 of it and pay at leisure later. 

 Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan and 

 Ashish Nehra, for two days running, showed exemplary control. 

 They did not allow Sri Lanka to break free and the inexperienced 

 West Indies were never a safe bet to take them on. 

 Indias left-arm pacemen 

 are from the top drawer. If they retain fitness and form, 

 they will be counted at the time of the 2007 World Cup.

 Anil Kumble was again not played 

 and that is a mistake. You do not bring him to Sri Lanka 

 and not play him. If he was there on Saturday night and 

 I was the opposition captain, I would have never asked my 

 batsmen to take chances against him. That is the kind of 

 respect he commands in batsmens minds. It must be 

 made use of.

 That brings me to the issue of 

 Sourav Ganguly. Now that he is in Sri Lanka, speculation 

 would be rife on his relationship with his former deputy 

 and now leader, Dravid. 

 Frankly, I do not foresee any 

 trouble. I know Sourav well and am aware he has a raging 

 fire for the good of Indian cricket. He is a gutsy combative 

 character and I respect him a lot. He would give the personal 

 equation a secondary role. 

 These men, cricketers like Sourav, 

 Dravid, Tendulkar and Kumble, are not the ones who worry 

 about their positions. They are the ones who are only concerned 

 about the good of the team. They are shining examples in 

 model conduct for youngsters. 

 Dravid is also not a fool who 

 would look out to slight Sourav. He would do his best to 

 make use of the former captains experience and class; 

 the same that he himself proffered when he was deputy to 

 the left-hander.

 Besides, the presence of Greg 

 Chappell would always be around to douse any fire from spreading.

 Sourav has a lot to offer by way 

 of everything. It must be conveyed to him that he is wanted. 

 I remember when Murali was no-balled 

 in Australia for the first time, he did not want to go to 

 the ground. I told him he would be around, he was needed. 

 Even if it was to be in the role of 12th man.

 I still feel that Sri Lanka is 

 the strongest team in the competition. But I am not sure 

 if they are playing their best cricket. India, on the other 

 hand, are beginning to warm up. I would not be surprised 

 if they end up the winners and that the Man of the Series 

 is none other than Sourav.

 For he is that sort of man.

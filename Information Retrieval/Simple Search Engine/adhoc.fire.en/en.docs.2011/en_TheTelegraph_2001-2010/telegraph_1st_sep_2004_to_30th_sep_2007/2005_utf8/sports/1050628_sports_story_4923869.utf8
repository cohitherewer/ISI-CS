 Sachin: Plenty of planning needed

Mumbai: It will not be a standard one-day game following the introduction of new experimental rules from next month and teams and captains will have to chalk out new plans, batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar said on Monday. 

It will not be a standard one-day game with the new rules, the ace batsman said here during a promotional campaign. 

I dont know how different it will be, but captains and teams will have to sit down and chalk out plans to introduce an element of surprise. Plenty of planning would be needed, Sachin said on Monday. 

We will have to play a couple of games (before gauging the exact impact), said the batsman, who is recuperating from an elbow surgery.

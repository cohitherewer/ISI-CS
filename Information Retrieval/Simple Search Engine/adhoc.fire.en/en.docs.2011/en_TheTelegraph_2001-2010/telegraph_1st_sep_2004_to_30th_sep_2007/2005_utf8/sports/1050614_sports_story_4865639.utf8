 Sasikiran holds Korchnoi

 - HUNGARY CHESS 

Paks (Hungary): Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran started his campaign with a hard-fought draw against legendary GM Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland in the first round of the third Marx Georgy Memorial Grandmasters chess tournament here. 

The six-player category-15 event had a rather sedate start as the other two games of the day were also drawn with top seed Emil Sutovsky of Israel signing peace with Zoltan Almasi and former world junior champion Peter Acs of Hungary getting the same result with compatriot Ferenc Berkes. 

The event is being played under classical time control with two hours to both players for the first 40 moves followed by one hour each for the entire game. There are 10 rounds in all. Sasikiran gave Korchnoi a scare before the players agreed to a draw. 

It was a trendy Nimzo Indian defence that caught the fancy of Korchnoi, a feared player who was a world championship contender before Sasikiran was even born. 

Playing his pet Capablanca variation, Sasikiran got the dynamic balance he was looking for in the middle game and even a slight advantage, thanks to better control of vital squares but Korchnoi worked out his counter play very swiftly. 

Sasikiran sacrificed an exchange towards the end of the game to retain some chances but in the end his space advantage did not prove much. The game lasted 51 moves. 

Earlier, Emil Sutovsky had it easy against Almasi, the strongest Hungarian player after Peter Leko and Judit Polgar. 

Playing white, Sutovsky embarked on the Ruy Lopez and faced the fashionable Marshall Gambit threat. 

Getting only a miniscule opening advantage, Sutovsky first went for a direct kingside attack but quickly realised that it would not work. The result was a repetition of position and the draw was agreed to in just 24 moves. 

Peter Acs tried hard to beat youngest participant Berkes, who played black. It was another nimzo indian of the day with some fireworks thrown in. 

The middle game featured some fine display by Acs and once the dust subsided he had an extra knight for three pawns ? generally considered adequate compensation for the piece. 

Berkes proved it right too in quick time as his king marched forward along with the pawns and Acs was forced to take a draw by allowing perpetual checks after 43 moves.

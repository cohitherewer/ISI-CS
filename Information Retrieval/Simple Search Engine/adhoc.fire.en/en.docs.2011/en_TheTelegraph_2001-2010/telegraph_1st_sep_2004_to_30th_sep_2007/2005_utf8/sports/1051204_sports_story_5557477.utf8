The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I want to be more consistent, accurate

 - Balaji hopes to be back at nets in 10 days 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Chennai: Lakshmipathy Balaji isnt losing hope. He is focused on staging another comeback. The Pakistan tour is round the corner and hes optimistic that his previous experience there will put him back in the reckoning. 

His 12 wickets in three Tests in the 2004 series had helped him find a foothold in the team. The high point was his four for 63 in the Rawalpindi Test where he played a big role in Indias series victory. His megawatt smile that endeared him to the masses. But all that is now part of history. 

Having been overlooked by the national selectors after the tri-series in Sri Lanka at the start of the season, the mediumpacer has been laid low by a side strain recently that has kept him out of the Tamil Nadu Ranji Trophy side. 

 Its more of a niggle that has been bothering me. But its getting better and I should be back at nets in another ten days, Balaji told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Balajis rehab is being monitored by Team India physio John Gloster. I met him (Gloster) during the ongoing Test and he said theres nothing to worry. He is satisfied with my condition and has suggested a few things which I am following, he added. 

Injuries arent new to Balaji. He was laid low by a career-threatening lower abdominal muscle injury during the 2004 Champions Trophy in England that kept him out of action for more than four months. A combination of abdominal muscle tear, inflammation in the adductor region and a major inflammation on the cartilage of the pelvic bone made the recovery process a complicated and sensitive one. 

But he was back with a bang. Operating with increasing rhythm at a lively pace, he returned with a nine-wicket haul, including his career-best five for 76 in the first innings, against Pakistan in Mohali. But it was rough sailing in the one-day series that followed. 

Balaji, though, is determined to put all that behind him. He bagged eight wickets in the two Duleep games this season and hopes the Ranji matches will help him get back in shape. He is thankful to the MRF Pace Foundation for the support and guidance. The season-launching pacers camp in Bangalore under Greg Chappell was also of great help. 

But does the increased competition in the side worry him? Its good for Indian cricket that there are so many bowlers to choose from. The competition only eggs me to perform better. I want to be more consistent and accurate, among other things. 

In keeping with the modern trend he has added yoga and meditation to his training schedule. I always look forward to challenges and go head-on to achieve it. If I am not head-on, my performance will go down. 

His career graph may denote a typical volatile day on Dalal Street but he is determined to set the record straight.

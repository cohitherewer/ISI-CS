 Paes-Zimonjic in title round

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic have hit a purple patch. After winning the Monte Carlo Masters Series crown last week, they are one win away from another title. 

According to information received here, the second seeds beat Simon Aspelin (Sweden) and Todd Perry (Australia) 6-3, 6-4 in Saturday?s semi-final of the Barcelona Open. The Indo-Serbian team will meet Spaniards Feliciano Lopez and Rafael Nadal, who edged past Czech pair Cyril Suk and Pavel Vizner 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6). 

Paes, India?s Davis Cup captain, can now join his teammates for next weekend?s Davis Cup tie versus Uzbekistan only late on Monday or early Tuesday. 

The Asia-Oceania zone group I second-round tie starts on Friday.

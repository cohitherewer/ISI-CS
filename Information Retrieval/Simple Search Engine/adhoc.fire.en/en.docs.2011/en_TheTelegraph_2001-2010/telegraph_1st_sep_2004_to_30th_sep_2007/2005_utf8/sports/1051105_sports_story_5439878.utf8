 Jeev slips to tied 37th

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh, who played a brilliant round of four-under 68 in the first round, faltered in the second with a one-over 73 to slip to tied 37th in the Asahiryokuken Yomiuri Memorial golf meet at Asoiizuka Golf Club here on Friday. 

Jeev, who was placed seventh after the first round, was three-under 141 after 36 holes to slip down the leaderboard. 

The leader was the seasoned Shingo Katayama with a total of 134 with rounds of 65 and 69. N. Kawahara was a stroke behind at second along with S. Hirota. Hidemi Kase and Dinesh Chand shared the fifth spot at eight-under 136. 

Jeev, who has been concentrating on the Japan Tour for the entire year barring some forays into the Asian Tour, started on the back nine and had two birdies on the 11th and 18th as he turned in two-under and indicated a good positioning in the second round. 

However, he lost concentration and shot two successive bogeys on the first and second, and then followed it with a birdie on the third. But he went on to double bogey the fourth and then parred the remaining five holes to finish at one-over 73.

 Paes-Zimonjic climbs to No. 5

 - HAMBURG MASTERS 

 Federer sets up rematch with Gasquet 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Paes and his partner scalped world No. 1 pair Bob and Mike Bryan before falling to Mikael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro 

Calcutta: Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic avenged last weeks defeat at the hands of Bob and Mike Bryan to move up to world No. 5 in the ATP team rankings. The Indo-Serbian pair subsequently went down in the semis of the Hamburg Masters to Frenchmen Mikael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro. 

According to information received here, the sixth-seeded Indo-Serbian pair rallied to oust the world No. 1 team 3-6,7-6 (7-5), 7-5 on Friday. The Bryan twins had won a tight three-setter against the same rivals at the Rome Masters last week. 

On Saturday, Paes and Zimonjic lost 3-6, 2-6 to No. 8 seeds Llodra-Santoro. 

The 50 points they earned assured Paes and Zimonjic of the No. 5 slot in next ATP Team Race list which will be issued on Monday. They will move up from the current No. 7 position, past Wayne Arthurs-Paul Hanley and Simon Aspelin-Todd Perry. 

Paes and Zimonjic, who won back-to-back Tour titles before the Rome meet, thus have an 11-2 record in four claycourt tournaments ? a decent build-up to the French Open which starts on May 23. 

Reuters adds from Hamburg: Top seed Roger Federer shrugged off a sleepy start to reach the singles final with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Russian Nikolay Davydenko on Saturday. 

The defending champion lost the first two games and saved break-points to avoid going 0-3 down at the Rothenbaum before rousing himself to outplay the world No. 20 with a beguiling mix of fierce groundstrokes and deft drop shots. 

Federer will play Richard Gasquet, the French teenager who upset him in the Monte Carlo Masters quarter-finals last month. Gasquet thrashed Belgian Christophe Rochus 6-1, 6-1 to reach his second ATP Tour final. 

World No. 1 Federer also made a poor start in his quarter-final win over Guillermo Coria on Friday and he admitted it was habit he needed to break with the French Open, the sole Grand Slam he has yet to win, just over a week away. 

Such a start is always a handicap, its not good, he said. I almost gave him two breaks and thats dangerous. My serve and my forehand let me down and I need to think about why that was the case. 

The Swiss, who has now won 40 of his 42 matches this year, added: I was able to turn it around, but I didnt feel right in the beginning. I cant explain. He took advantage of that, then I started to use my all-round game to destabilise him. 

The Russian double-faulted to lose serve early in the second set and Federer took full advantage, confirming victory with a crunching forehand winner after 71 minutes on centre court. 

The 23-year-old has yet to drop a set in Hamburg, a tournament he won in 2002 and 2004. He will be attempting to win his sixth ATP Tour title of the season on Sunday. 

Like Rochus, Gasquet had to qualify for the event but that was where the similarity ended. The 18-year-old, who lost to Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the Monte Carlo semis after his win over Federer, clubbed his lightweight Belgian opponent into submission in a 56-minute exhibition of power tennis. 

Federer had three match-points before losing to the teenager 7-6, 2-6, 6-7 in Monte Carlo. Its nice to have a second chance to get him, Federer said. Hes a very all-round player, similar to me. But it will be a best-of-five match which will be better for me. Im more used to that than him.

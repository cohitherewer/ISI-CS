 Pak face uphill task: Miandad

Karachi: Blaming Pakistan?s drubbing at the hands of Australia on ?poor strategy?, former Pakistan captain and coach Javed Miandad said low-on-confidence Pakistan team would face an uphill task to have any impact on the tour of India. 

?There have been some good individual performances here and there but overall, the Australian tour has been disappointing. The boys must be suffering from low-confidence after losing the Test and one-day series,? Miandad said here on Monday. 

?It is up to the boys to lift their confidence and motivate themselves for the tour (of India) ahead. 

?It?s going to be tough because if victory can take your confidence sky-high, it touches its lowest ebb in case of defeat, particularly when the margins are so big,? said Miandad, who was the coach of the Wasim Akram-led team on their last tour to India in 1999.

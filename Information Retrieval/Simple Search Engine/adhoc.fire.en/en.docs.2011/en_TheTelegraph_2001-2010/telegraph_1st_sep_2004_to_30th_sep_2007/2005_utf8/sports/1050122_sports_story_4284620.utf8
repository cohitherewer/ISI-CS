 Justine has only herself to blame: Martina

 Martina Navratilova in Melbourne on Friday 

Melbourne: Tennis legend Martina Navratilova believes the fitness problems of former world number one Justine Henin-Hardenne could have been self-inflicted. 

Navratilova, speaking after teaming with Daniela Hantuchova to record a 6-2, 6-0 second round doubles victory over Australia?s Trudi Musgrave and Christina Wheeler, voiced alarm over injury problems affecting the women?s game. 

The 48-year-old is a firm believer that the top women are playing too many meets and not getting enough rest, suffering premature burnout as a result. 

But she believes reigning Australian Open champion Henin-Hardenne who was forced to pull out with a knee injury could have paid the price for working too hard in training. 

?When I saw Justin training, I thought, ?my God, that woman works very, very hard,? and I was wondering how long she can keep it up. And there?s your answer,? Navratilova said. ?You see the result. She?s in her prime physically. Obviously she overdid it and she knows that, and she?ll probably pull back the reins a little bit.? (AFP)

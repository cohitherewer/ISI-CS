 Connivance fancied to lift main event 

 HONKY DORY

 Connivance and Flavius Victor may fight out the issue in the 2,400m Gen. Obaidullah Khan Trophy, the main event at the Mumbai races on Thursday. Although Flavius Victor won his last start over 2,000m in a very convincing manner, the extended trip may help Connivance demonstrate her staying prowess and win the trophy. Y. Srinath partners the M. Irani-trained six-year-old mare by Placerville out of Nauvka.

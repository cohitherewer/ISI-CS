 Romario tells Pele to shut up

Rio de Janeiro: Romario told Pele to put a shoe in his mouth on Friday after he suggested the 38-year-old should retire. 

?When Pele?s quiet, he?s a poet,? the 1994 World Cup winner said. ?But he just talks shit. He was the greatest player in history, he was our king. But he should put a shoe in his mouth. 

?I don?t stick my nose into his affairs, so he shouldn?t stick his into mine.?(Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Warne, Murali to visit Galle

 - Ranatunga plans to ?settle? differences with leg-spinner 

 Warne says he is proud to be brothers-in-arms with Murali for such a cause 

Sydney: Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne is putting aside his spin rivalry with Muttiah Muralidharan to provide aid to victims of the tsunami disaster in Sri Lanka. 

Warne will join Muralidharan in a visit to Galle in southern Sri Lanka to see where he can direct funding from his charity for the rebuilding program following the tsunami?s devastation. 

Warne and Muralidharan, long time rivals on the cricket field, have exchanged the record for most wickets in Tests over the last 12 months. 

Warne leads the standings now, while Muralidharan is second on the all-time list. 

The Shane Warne Foundation usually raises money for underprivileged children in Australia, but Warne said he wanted to channel funds for tsunami relief effort in Lanka. 

This ?tragedy has thrown us together and no doubt it has brought us closer,? Warne, writing in a column for Sydney?s Daily Telegraph, said of his friendship with Muralidharan. 

?I just want to help. Our head-to-head battle for the world Test wickets records is a terrific joust on the sporting field, but on this issue I?m proud for us to be brothers-in-arms for such a cause.? 

Cricketer-turned-politician Arjuna Ranatunga is planning to meet Warne during the leg-spinner?s tour of Sri Lanka in an attempt to end one of cricket?s most bitter feuds. 

Ranatunga, who had called for a life suspension for the Australian leg-spinner for taking a banned diuretic, said he would try to meet Warne and broker a truce during his week-long visit. 

?Murali spoke to me last night and I will be catching up with (Warne) for sure,? Ranatunga was quoted as saying in the Australian media. 

?We have had our differences over the years, but at a time like this, I am sure we will be able to make things good. 

?When we played against each other, he played very hard and I played very hard. 

?When all the boys get together this time, I don?t think there will be any more problems.?

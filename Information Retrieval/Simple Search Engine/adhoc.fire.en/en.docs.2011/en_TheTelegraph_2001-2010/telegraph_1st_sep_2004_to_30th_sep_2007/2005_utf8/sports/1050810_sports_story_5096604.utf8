The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vijayan not allowed to train with EB

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: I.M. Vijayan has finally landed in the city but there is no assurance from Subhas Bhowmick on whether he will get to wear the red-and-gold jersey. 

Soon after arriving here on Monday night, the former India captain got in touch with Bhowmick. Vijayan explained that the sudden death of a family member forced him to stay home in Kerala longer than expected. 

Bhowmick didnt seem impressed, refusing to let Vijayan practise with the team. 

Im not going to practise with the East Bengal players. The coach wants me to train separately and somewhere else. Im hopeful of playing for East Bengal, Vijayan said on Tuesday. 

Bhowmick, it has been learnt, is peeved at Vijayan missing out on the pre-season training under Peter McKnight.

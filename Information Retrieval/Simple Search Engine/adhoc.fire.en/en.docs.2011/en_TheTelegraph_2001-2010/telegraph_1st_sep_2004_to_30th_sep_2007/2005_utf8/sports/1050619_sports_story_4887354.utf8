The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Session with Prasanna impresses Greg

 - Team India coach to meet BCCI brass tomorrow 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Erapalli Prasanna 

Bangalore: Ian Chappell has always rated Erapalli Prasanna very highly (the best off-spinner I played against or have seen anywhere). On Saturday, after a session with him here, Greg came away as impressed, if not more. 

Pras spoke about getting batsmen out? Talked of different angles, variations? He was positive and I found his thoughts quite fascinating, Greg told The Telegraph. 

So, nobody should be surprised if the new Team India coach decides to involve Prasanna at some point during his two-year tenure. It could be sooner rather than later. 

Generally, the expertise available in the country is mind-boggling and Greg is all too aware of that. 

Greg, meanwhile, is meeting the BCCI brass on Monday to ink his contract and finalise the three camps he intends having in the lead-up to the 2005-06 season-launching tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

That done, Gregs interaction with Kiran More and Co. (later next week) will provide the national selectors an insight into his vision. 

Greg, by the way, is making notes on a daily basis. Thats done in the evenings as the mornings, among other things, feature a trip to the National Cricket Academy. 

Incidentally, wife Judith was in discomfort during the day owing to the accumulation of fluid in her legs ? the result of the long haul from Adelaide. 

 Medical advice, though, has been taken.

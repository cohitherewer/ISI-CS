Wellington: Adam Gilchrist and Damien Martyn?s devastating partnership left Australia in complete control of the second Test against New Zealand on Sunday. 

Martyn made a career-best 165 while vice-captain Gilchrist belted 162 ? his third consecutive century ? to help Australia post a first innings total of 570 for eight declared. 

New Zealand crashed to 122 for four in reply at stumps on the third day. 

Glenn McGrath did the early damage with the ball, trapping New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming leg before for a golden duck, then dismissing Hamish Marshall for 18, caught by Jason Gillespie at long leg after a mistimed pull shot. (Reuters)

 ?Win an achievement to savour?

 - Former captain and Bangladesh?s first Test centurion Aminul Islam Bulbul feels the country?s journey has just begun

Melbourne: Monday?s Test win in Chittagong has given Bangladeshis everywhere one good reason to celebrate. Among those most happy is former captain Aminul Islam Bulbul. 

Aminul, who led Bangladesh in the 1999 World Cup and scored a century in their maiden Test (against India, November 2000), is currently in Sydney. 

?This first win is an achievement to savour... Now, those who have been questioning Bangladesh?s presence in the Test club should keep quiet... I agree circumstances have weakened Zimbabwe, but that?s not our fault,? he told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Sydney on Tuesday, Aminul added: ?However, once this rejoicing ends, the Board must pay attention to the domestic structure. There?s a need to revamp and expand, besides encouraging schools to take up cricket in a big way.? 

Turning a bit emotional, he remarked: ?Bangladesh?s journey has just begun... Habibul (Bashar) and the boys had an opportunity and they grabbed it with both hands... The road ahead, though, is very long...? 

Aminul hasn?t formally retired, but his last Bangladesh appearance was a couple of years ago. Of course, he still plays cricket and is South Sydney?s vice-captain. 

?I?m working towards becoming a cricket analyst and have already completed a Cricket Australia level-1 coaching course besides an on-line offering from the Victoria Institute of Sports,? Aminul, who turns 37 next month, informed. 

Aminul and his family (wife Shamima and two kids) left Bangladesh exactly a year ago and landed in Melbourne. They shifted to Sydney once Shamima got a job with a premier multinational as a business analyst. 

Incidentally, the former captain is looking forward to soon visiting London and the Lord?s museum where his historic century-making bat has been put on display. He parted with it last August. 

Only two others, by the way, have scored a century on debut in their country?s maiden Test: Charles Bannerman for Australia (versus England, 1877) and Zimbabwe?s Dave Houghton (against India, 1992). 

Aminul, therefore, is in a truly elite club.

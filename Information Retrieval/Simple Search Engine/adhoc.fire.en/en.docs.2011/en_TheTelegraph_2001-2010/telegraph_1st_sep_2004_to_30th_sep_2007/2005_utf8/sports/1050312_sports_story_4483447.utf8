The Telegraph - Calcutta

 East Bengal show-cause Juliano 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal have issued a letter to Juliano Martins asking him to show cause for misbehaving with Subhas Bhowmick during East Bengal?s AFC Cup match against Muktijoddha on Wednesday. 

Apparently, the Brazilian striker ? who joined the red-and-golds last month only ? wasn?t happy when the coach told him at half-time in the dressing-room that he would be replaced in the second session. Juliano made his displeasure clear, making unethical gestures at the coach in front of players and officials. 

Juliano has been asked to reply within 24 hours, but till late Friday, had not received the letter. 

That virtually rules him out of the AFC Cup trip to Turkmenistan. Unless, as an official pointed out, he receives the letter Saturday morning and sends a quick reply which satisfies the management. 

East Bengal leave for Delhi Saturday night and fly off to Turkmenistan the next morning. With Dipak Mondal already ruled out by an injury, Martins? absence would leave East Bengal with a squad of 18.

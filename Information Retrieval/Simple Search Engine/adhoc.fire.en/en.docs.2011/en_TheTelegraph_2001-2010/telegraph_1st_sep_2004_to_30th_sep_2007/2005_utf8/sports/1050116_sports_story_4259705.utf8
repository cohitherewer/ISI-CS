 Anand starts with draw

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): World rapid chess champion Viswanathan Anand started his campaign with a quick and easy draw with Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk of Russia in the first round of the category-19 Corus chess tournament here Saturday. 

All the other games of round one were still in progress when Grischuk proposed the draw after making his 22nd move. 

Apparently, the Russian star was taken aback by Anand?s choice of the Ruy Lopez Open as black and probably had not had a good look at this variation while preparing for the game. 

Interestingly, Anand had once reached the final position of this game in his match against Spanish Alexei Shirov in their duel of world champions clash during the chess classics in Mainz in mid 2004. (PTI)

 Sanyal, Paul help East fight back vs Central

 - Pacers call the shots on lively track 

 Sanjib Sanyal (62 n.o.) top-scored for East 

Gwalior: East Zone failed to take advantage of winning the toss and were bundled out for 194 on the opening day of their Duleep Trophy tie against Central Zone on Tuesday. Jai Prakash Yadav claimed five wickets. In reply, Central were reduced to 74 for four at stumps after Shib Shankar Paul claimed three wickets. 

East openers Shiv Sundar Das and Arindam Das were off a good start, putting on 66 runs, but the middle-order failed miserably. The only exception was Sanjib Sanyal who scored an unbeaten 62. 

The seamers ? Yadav, Harvinder Singh and Rudra Pratap Singh ? extracted disconcerting bounce from the lively pitch. 

Yadav took five for 29, and accounted for Shiv Sundar (34), Arindam (31), Mahendra Singh Dhoni (5), Sanjay Satpathy (21) and Ranadeb Bose (0). 

When Central batted, Paul bowled with fire removing the openers in quick succession. Paul, who was in the Indian squad for the Bangladesh tour, has failed to create much of an impression in the Ranji Trophy this season. Today, though, he seemed to return to his creative ways, getting to move the ball off the seam. 

Paul received good support from Ranadeb Bose. Paul took the most important wicket of Mohammed Kaif. (Agencies)

Bangalore: In time, the Team India support staff may see additions, but new coach Greg Chappell has begun interacting with physio John Gloster and trainer Greg King. 

That, too, within hours of landing here. 

Chappell met both for almost an hour at the National Cricket Academy on Thursday afternoon and, then, had a session at the Taj West End as well. 

Weve got similar goals and ideas... Obviously, weve got to talk at length, but were on the right track, Gloster, who succeeded Andrew Leipus earlier this year, told The Telegraph. 

King, who has been around for much longer, said much the same thing. 

Asked if either he or Gloster was a bit overawed, King laughed: Look, a coach is a coach... One doesnt have to be disrespectful, nor get overawed. But, yes, I realise Chappell can be different from John Wright... 

Chappell, by the way, has requested the BCCI to organise three camps (all in this city) for the probables ahead of the 2005-06 season-launching tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

The first, in all probability from June 28 to July 3, will exclusively be for the pacers. The next, possibly between July 4 and 10, is going to focus on conditioning. The final one, probably from July 12 to 22, will be cricket-specific. 

As of now, the last camp has to be attended by all the probables. 

Meanwhile, Gloster informed that Irfan Pathans shoulder problem got more attention than it ought to have. It was plain stiffness and nobody should have worried, he insisted. 

Gloster has been in contact with Pathan, who is on a short-term contract with Middlesex.

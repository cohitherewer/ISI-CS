The Telegraph - Calcutta

 England yet to recover from Bangalore loss

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The England under-19 cricketers are still reeling under the shock of the 293-run thrashing they got from their Indian counterparts in the first ?Test? in Bangalore. 

The four-day match ended well before stumps on Day 3 with the English boys managing just 112 and 129 in their two innings. Vice-captain Manoj Tewari tied them in knots with a match-haul of eight wickets. It left the visitors confused and shattered. 

?It was a huge turner, our boys hadn?t played on anything like that before,? said coach Andy Pick at the Eden on Tuesday, 48 hours before the second ?Test? gets underway. 

After the Bangalore experience, the team has just one wish: a true, sporting wicket. 

?It will be a typical Eden wicket? good for batting and should favour spinners from the third day,? said local boy Tewari.

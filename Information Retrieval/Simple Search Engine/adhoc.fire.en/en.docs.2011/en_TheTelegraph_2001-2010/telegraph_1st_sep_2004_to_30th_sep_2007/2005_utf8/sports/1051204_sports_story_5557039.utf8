 A memorable win: Inzy

Lahore: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq described the 2-0 Test series win over England as one of the biggest of his career on Saturday. 

It is one of the most memorable and biggest wins of my career. This win was more satisfying because we outplayed them, he said. 

Pakistan won the final Test by an innings and 100 runs and took the first Test in Multan by 22 runs. Also because lot of people before the series had written us off. But I was quietly confident we were well prepared and had the advantage of playing in home conditions. 

Inzamam said England had played well despite their defeat. They are definitely a strong side and their six straight series wins including in the Ashes are testimony to their strength. 

Inzamam said Pakistans success was a team effort. 

I would not single out any one player. They all really worked hard and at the right times we performed in the series. In all three tests our bowlers put up their best efforts, Shoaib, Rana, Sami and Kaneria and got us crucial wickets on not so conducive pitches, he said. 

Inzamam has now won three Test series as captain against South Africa, New Zealand and England. 

He said coach Bob Woolmer has played a key role in teams win. This is his first series win and he has helped us improve in all departments. If any player needs his help he can go to Bob talk to him and get it resolved. His contribution is crucial. 

Shoaib Akhtar, who finished with 17 wickets in the series, said he wanted his performance to cheer the victims of the October 8 earthquake. 

The devastation caused by the earthquake was on our minds when we started this series and we wanted to do something special for them. I wanted to do something to make them smile, he said.Shoaib, 30, said the victory over England was special and he was happy that he could dedicate something memorable to the earthquake victims.

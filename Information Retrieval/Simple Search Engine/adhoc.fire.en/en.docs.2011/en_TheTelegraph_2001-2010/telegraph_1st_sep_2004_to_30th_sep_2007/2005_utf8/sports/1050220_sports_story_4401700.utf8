 Sarfraz: We?ve lost the series before start

 Shoaib?s withdrawal is a body blow, feels Sarfraz 

Karachi: Paceman Shoaib Akhtar?s withdrawal from the Indian Test series less than 24 hours after being fined and reprimanded for indiscipline has triggered off a heated debate in this cricket-mad country. 

Experts, former players and followers of the game have come up with all possible conspiracy theories as the Pakistan team?s first full tour of India in six years continues to be dogged by controversies. 

?Shoaib Akhtar?s withdrawal is a body blow for Pakistan. The Indians must be celebrating. Pakistan, I think, have lost the series even before it has started,? former Test fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz said from Islamabad. 

?In a nutshell, it is a clear case of mishandling a star player. I don?t think the PCB had sent out positive vibes by first slapping a show-cause notice and then making Shoaib appear before disciplinary committee. 

?At a time when the player needed support and confidence-boosting, the PCB put unnecessary pressure on him from right, left and centre,? he said. 

Sarfraz, who helped Shoaib improve his bowling action, recalled last year?s episode when India toured Pakistan and said Shoaib was humiliated that time also. 

?If you remember, Shoaib underwent tremendous strain and tension when the PCB constituted a medical commission to probe if the fast bowler had deliberately under-performed citing fitness during the Rawalpindi Test,? Sarfaraz said.

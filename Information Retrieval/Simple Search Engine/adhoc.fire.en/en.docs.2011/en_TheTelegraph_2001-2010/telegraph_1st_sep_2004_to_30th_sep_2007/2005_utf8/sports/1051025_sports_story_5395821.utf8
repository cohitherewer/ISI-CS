The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shoaib a matchwinner if fit and firing: 

 Woolmer

 Ivo Tennant 

 Shoaib needs to 

 be a proper cricketer, says Woolmer 

 Pakistans coach has attempted 

 to deflate the England cricket teams bubble of confidence 

 on the eve of their departure for the subcontinent. Bob 

 Woolmer said on Sunday that he thought England would struggle 

 to get back to work after six weeks of post-Ashes euphoria.

 Mentally Im wondering 

 can England get up again after such a fantastic effort? 

 Woolmer said. That will be a telling point because 

 sometimes its very hard when youve been on such 

 a high for a long time.

 Such comments would once have 

 unsettled England. But they are not the mentally frail side 

 they used to be, having survived plenty of digs from Australians 

 over the summer. David Graveney, the chairman of Englands 

 selectors, responded with his own assertion that England 

 should be regarded as the best side in the world if they 

 beat Pakistan and India this winter.

 We are halfway there, having 

 won the Ashes, he said. The mark of a good team 

 is to beat Australia, anywhere, and also to win on the subcontinent.

 Despite his confidence, Woolmer 

 faces substantial difficulty in attempting to turn Pakistan 

 into a disciplined side. This was encapsulated on Sunday 

 when Shoaib Akhtar arrived two days late for a training 

 camp in Lahore. Shoaib will be told that he has to put the 

 interests of the team first if he is to play any part in 

 the series.

 Shoaib sa ys he told me 

 during the summer that he would not be back until October 

 23, but I do not remember him saying that, Woolmer 

 said. He says he attended a charity dinner to raise 

 funds for the earthquake appeal and is bringing money back 

 with him for that, which is a clever political ploy. How 

 can I fight him over that? If we give him enough rope, he 

 will either hang himself or he will get fit.

 I need him to be a proper 

 cricketer, not a man who is going to do his own thing, because 

 if he is fit and firing, he is a match-winner. I need him 

 to prevent England from recapturing the heights they reached 

 in winning the Ashes. 

 When not grappling with elements 

 of the Pakistani media who resent an outsider coaching the 

 national side Woolmer, 57, is working on methods of stifling 

 key England players. He also wants the ICC to utilise more 

 technical aids for Tests ? ideally in time for the first 

 Test.

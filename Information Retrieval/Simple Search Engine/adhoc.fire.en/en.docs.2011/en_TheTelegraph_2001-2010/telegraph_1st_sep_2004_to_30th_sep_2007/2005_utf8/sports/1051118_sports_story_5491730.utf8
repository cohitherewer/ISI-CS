 Goa to take on Punjab in last 4

Kochi: Title aspirants Goa set up a semi-final clash with Punjab after forcing former champions Manipur to a 1-1 draw in a quarter final match in the Air India Express National Football Championship for Santosh Trophy on Thursday. The draw helped Goa enter the semi-finals on a better goal difference. Earlier, last year runners-up Punjab too qualified for the semi-final on better goal margin after defeating Tamil Nadu 2-0. 

Tomba Singh struck the goal for Manipur in the 86th minute and Goas Climax Lawrence found the equaliser a minute later. 

Meanwhile, former champions Maharashtra will be pinning their hopes on Abhishek Yadav and Soccor Velho upfront and Steven Dias in the midfield in their semi-final clash against Kerala. 

Keralas main worry will be their striker ? Mohammed Rafi and Abdul Hakkim, who have been off-colour. Rafi had impressed with his speed but lacks accuracy, while Hakkim is yet to play to his potential. (PTI)

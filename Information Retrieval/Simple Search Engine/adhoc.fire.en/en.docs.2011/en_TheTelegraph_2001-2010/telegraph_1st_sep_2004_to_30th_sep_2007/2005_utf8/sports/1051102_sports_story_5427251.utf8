Calcutta: It was the story of a few close calls last season. Come new calendar and you can expect the city star to lay his hands on one of those coveted trophies on the US PGA Tour. 

Yes, Arjun Atwal is determined to translate his proverbial so-near-yet-so-far tales into reality in the coming season. 

Thats going to be my main target? Winning a tournament on the Tour, the 32-year-old pro said on Tuesday ? relaxing and perhaps regrouping himself for the challenges ahead in his Alipore residence. 

While analysing my performances last season, it emerged that I was not just consistent at the weekends. I made cuts easily but I struggled with my form thereafter. This is one area Ill seriously try to improve upon? I just want to finish off the tournament with a bang, Atwal, who finished tied 11th in the just-concluded Hero Honda Indian Open in New Delhi, explained. 

The first Indian to qualify for the US PGA Tour in 2004, Atwal ? now based in Florida ? claimed four top-10 finishes this season and secured his full card for next year as well. 

The highlight of his trudge on the greens in the US PGA was a joint-second finish in a five-man play-off in the $5-million BellSouth Classic in April. If all this points to a gritty character in the pro, the charming man in him was all joy, having managed to spend Diwali with family members in the city. 

I really cant recall when I was in Calcutta last time during Diwali, he said, grinning. 

Dont you miss such moments while on Tour? Absolutely, pat came the reply. 

People often say that since I have a house in Florida, I should feel like an American citizen. But I must tell you that I am an Indian at heart and nothing can change it. Both in failures and successes, I always miss Calcutta and its spectacular ambience, he said.

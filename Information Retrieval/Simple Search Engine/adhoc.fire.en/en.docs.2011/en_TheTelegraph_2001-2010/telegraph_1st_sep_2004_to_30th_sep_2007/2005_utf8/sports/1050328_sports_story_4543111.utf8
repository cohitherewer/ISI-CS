 Thanou to run again

Athens: Greek sprinter Katerina Thanou, who was acquitted last week of charges of missing three doping tests including one on the eve of the Athens Olympics, said on Sunday she would race again. Thanou and fellow-sprinter Costas Kenteris had faced maximum two-year bans if found guilty of avoiding the tests. 

Their case, hours before the Athens Games? opening ceremony last summer, cast a cloud over the Olympics and embarrassed the host nation. 

?If I get the green light, yes (I will race again),? the 30-year-old said in an interview. ?This is what I am waiting for to start again. I?m ready for as many battles as I need. 

?I want to run again,? she said. (Reuters)

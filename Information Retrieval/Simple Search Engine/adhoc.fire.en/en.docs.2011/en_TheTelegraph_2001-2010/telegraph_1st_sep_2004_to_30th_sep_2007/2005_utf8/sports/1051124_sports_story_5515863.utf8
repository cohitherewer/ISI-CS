 Observer hints at changes in nomination 

Chennai: T. N. Krishnamurthy, the special observer appointed by the Supreme Court to oversee Board elections, indicated on Wednesday that certain changes would be made in the nomination process. 

The indication came after representatives of 13 units affiliated to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) met the former Chief Election Commissioner to apprise him of their concerns about the BCCI polls to be held on November 29 and 30. 

A communication to this effect would be sent to all member associations on Thursday. (PTI)

 Sohail hammers hattrick 

Hyderabad: Powered by Sohail Abbas? hattrick, Hyderabad Sultans defeated Maratha Warriors 4-2 to post their second straight win and leap to the top of the Premier Hockey League standings with 15 points here Sunday night. 

The genius from Pakistan sounded the board in the 17th, 34th and 40th minutes and Indrajeet Singh scored the fourth in the 56th minute as Warriors surrendered, scoring only two goals through Kashif Jawad (seventh) and Shivendra Singh (46th). 

The Marathas took the lead though Jawad, but Abbas restored parity within ten minutes before the end of the first quarter. He struck again just before the close of second quarter to give the hosts a 2-1 lead. Abbas then completed his hattrick in the third quarter to put Sultans on top at 3-1. 

A penalty corner conversion by Shivendra Singh infused tempo into the game as the Warriors narrowed the gap to 2-3 but then a brilliant reverse hit by Indrajeet sealed the fate of Warriors in the final quarter. 

 The opening goal of the match saw Dhanraj Pillay doing the spadework which was neatly finished by Jawad, collecting a brilliant pass from Sunil Yadav. Sohail then used his patent drag-flick past Maratha custodian Baljeet Singh towards the close of the first quarter as the two teams went level 1-1 at the break. He again struck at the end of the second quarter through another conversion and this time his powerful flick tore open the netting and scooted out as the home crowd erupted in joy. 

He completed his hat-trick in the 40th minute.

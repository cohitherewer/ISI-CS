 Mourinho-Wenger row rumbles on

 Wenger is in defiant mood 

London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has vowed that he will not back down from his row with Jose Mourinho, although he denied calling the Chelsea manager stupid, as had been widely reported. 

The Football Association (FA) has called on the pair to cool their war of words, but, speaking after his side had qualified for the knockout stage of the Champions League with a 3-0 victory over Sparta Prague, the Arsenal manager was far from conciliatory. 

I dont know what the FA want, Wenger said following Wednesdays 3-0 home win in Highbury. 

I dont know what I have done wrong. I dont know what they intend to do. I do not want to offend anybody. If somebody asks me a question and I dont answer I feel I am offending them. But Ive seen some quotes today that I did not say. I never said he (Mourinho) is stupid. 

Wenger, though, was sufficiently enraged by Mourinhos claim that he was a voyeur, that he did not rule out what he mysteriously referred to as action against him. 

We have some games and then we have a break, Wenger added. Then well think about our options. I love football and what is important is to focus on the game but, if I am attacked, I will respond if I feel its not right.

 Safin falls to Ginepri

 - CINCINNATI MASTERS 

Cincinnati: World No. 1 Roger Federer rolled into the semi-finals of the Cincinnati Masters on Friday, while fourth seed Marat Safin was dumped by American wild card Robby Ginepri. 

Fifth seed Andy Roddick battled past Russian Mikhail Youznhy 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 and now plays third seed Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, who saw off sixth-seeded Russian Nikolay Davydenko 6-2, 6-3. 

Top seed Federer let slip an early lead in the first set when his Argentine opponent Jose Acasuso recovered from 0-3 down to 3-3. 

But once the Swiss, in his first event since winning a third consecutive Wimbledon, had taken the first set it was plain sailing as he clinched a 6-4, 6-3 victory. 

Federer will meet Ginepri in the last four after Safin, who had impressed in his victory over Dominik Hrbaty in the previous round, was dumped out 2-6, 3-6 in 56 minutes. 

With Ginepri cutting down on the unforced errors, Safin self-destructed, smashing a ball out of the stadium and throwing his racket in disgust at his performance 

Safin, who is still struggling with a left knee injury, said he had half-expected a bad performance. I woke up this morning and didnt have any energy, he said. 

Roddick had not lost his service on the way to the last eight, but he was broken twice as Youzhny stormed through the first set. 

But the former US Open champion became more aggressive and that paid off as he levelled the match and then broke in the fifth game of the decider on the way to victory. 

I think it started getting better when I began to serve better, Roddick said. The crowd helped me the other night against (Juan Carlos) Ferrero and they helped me again tonight. 

The Australian, runner-up to Andre Agassi last year, pro-ved too consistent for Davydenko, breaking early in the first set to cruise into the last four. (REUTERS)

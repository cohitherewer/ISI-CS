 Rohan century in drawn tie

 - RANJI TROPHY 

Mumbai: Rohan Gavaskar completed his century for Bengal before their four-day Ranji Trophy Elite Division group A match against hosts Mumbai petered out into a tame draw at the Wankhede Stadium here on Monday. 

Southpaw Gavaskar, batting on 71 in Bengals overnight second innings score of 220 for four, duly reached his century this morning before being sixth out for 154 after a stay of 386 minutes with 17 hits to the fence. 

Bengal, who were content to play out a draw after having conceded a 73-run first innings lead, were dismissed for 382, 100 minutes into the second session, leaving Mumbai the improbable task of scoring 310 for an outright victory. The hosts finished at 81 for one in 34 overs before the match was called off after the eighth of 15 mandatory overs in the last hour of play. 

Apart from Gavaskars century, in which he faced 259 balls, the other highlight of the Bengal second innings was the seven-wicket haul by Mumbai captain and left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni.

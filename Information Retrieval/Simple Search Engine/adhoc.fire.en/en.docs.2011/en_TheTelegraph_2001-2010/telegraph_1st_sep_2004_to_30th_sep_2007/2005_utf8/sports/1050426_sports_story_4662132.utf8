 Back-to-back titles for Paes-Zimonjic

A STAFF REPORTER

 This is Paes? 33rd career title 

Calcutta: Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic won back-to-back titles when they lifted the $850,000 Barcelona Open doubles crown on Sunday. 

According to information received here, the second-seed made short work of the potentially strong Spanish pair of Rafael Nadal and Feliciano Lopez. The Indo-Serbian combine won 6-3, 6-3. Last week, they had won the Monte Carlo Masters Series title after the Bryan brothers conceded the final following an injury suffered by Mike. 

This is Paes? 33rd career doubles title, and his third with Zimonjic. The two are No. 7 on the ATP teams? rankings list. In the individual list, Paes is No. 11 (one spot behind Mahesh Bhupathi) and Zimonjic No. 7. 

Nadal had earlier on Sunday won the singles title beating countryman Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. 

Agencies add: Nadal clai-med his fourth ATP title of the year, following on from Monte Carlo last week when he became the youngest winner of a Masters Series event in 15 years. 

Ferrero, in his first final since losing to Lleyton Hewitt in Rotterdam in February 2004, put up some stiff opposition in the second set but Nadal was in irresistible form.

 Indian to be hockey coach

Chennai: Following a miserable experience with its first ever foreign recruit, the Indian Hockey Federation has now made up its mind to appoint a countryman as the coach of its senior national team and will make the announcement next week, according to IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran. 

The Indian hockey team has been without a coach since German Gerhard Rach resigned in January. 

?IHF president K. P. S. Gill is seized of the matter of nominating the coach for our senior team. He is likely to announce the name next week,? Jyothikumaran said Sunday. 

With an eye on the Champions Trophy in Chennai in December, the IHF has already zeroed in on the shortlist of probable players for the event and the coach. The probables were announced at the end of the Hyderabad nationals. 

The IHF secretary, however, did not discount the possibility of seeking the assistance of a foreigner in the future. (PTI)

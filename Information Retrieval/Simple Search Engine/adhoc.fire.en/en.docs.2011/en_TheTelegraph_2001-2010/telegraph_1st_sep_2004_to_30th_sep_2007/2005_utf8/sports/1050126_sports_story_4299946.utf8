The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Weather a worry for Windies

Adelaide: The West Indies head into Wednesday?s tri-series match against Australia fearful that foul weather might again thwart their chances of earning a crucial victory. 

Captain Brian Lara said the match was a do-or-die fixture for his side, who are seeking to overcome Pakistan and gain a place in the finals of the limited overs competition against Australia. 

Lara said his bowlers needed to repeat their wicket-taking feat from the previous encounter between the two sides in Brisbane last Friday. 

?It?s important that we try to maintain that focus and make sure we get early wickets,? Lara said. 

TEAMS 

Australia: Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden, Michael Clarke, Darren Lehmann, Andrew Symonds, Simon Katich, Brad Haddin, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath. 

West Indies (from): Brian Lara, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Christopher Gayle, Wavell Hinds, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Bravo, Ryan Hinds, Courtney Browne, Ian Bradshaw, Pedro Collins, Mervyn Dillon, Reon King, Xavier Marshall.

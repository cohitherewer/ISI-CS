The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. overcome Hindustan FC 2-0 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Jamshedpur: Mohammedan Sporting took a giant step towards advancing to the next round, when they beat Hindustan FC 2-0 in the second division group B National Football League at the Keenan Stadium on Tuesday. The win helped Mohammedan Sporting so far garner seven points from three matches. 

Though, Hindustan FC did display some fighting qualities but they lacked necessary punch in the forwardline to off-set the balance of Mohammedan Sporting. Things turned to the black-and-white brigades advantage after the barren first half when forward Raman Vijayan converted a Zaheer Abbas cross from the right in the 72nd minute. Vijayan dodged Hindustan FC defenders before shooting into the open net. 

The experience of the Calcutta outfit finally bore fruit again in the 88th minute thanks to Zubair KP. A crisp cross from Prakash Kolay found Zubair right outside the penalty area. All he had to do was to head home from a perfect position and he did it with precision. 

Mohammedan Sporting could have also scored in the first half had some of the players shots been accurate.

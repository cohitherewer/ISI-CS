 Sachin opens India Room

London: Sachin Tendulkar Monday inaugurated the India Room in the new stand at The Oval here. 

Tendulkar, who was here to also offer his support to the Twenty20 tsunami fundraiser between Asia XI and International XI, was thrilled to open the new room at the refurbished stand. 

[That Sachin would inaugurate the India Room was reported by The Telegraph on June 9.] 

It is great honour. Surrey is my favourite ground where I played my hundredth Test. It was a special moment for me, Tendulkar said. 

Leading UK based industrialists raised ?500,000 for the India Room. Offering his full support of cricketers to all fund raising activities to help tsunami victims, Tendulkar said, from the cricketing fraternity whatever you are doing for tsunami victims is very very special. All the cricketers are with you. Hopefully I will get to play a part in future fund-rasiers. 

Tendulkar, who was to feature in both the Lords match held on June 14 and Mondays game at The Oval, had to pull out after undergoing an elbow surgery in London. 

Talking about his fitness, Tendulkar said: I am making steady progress. 

In January Tendulkar had travelled to Melbourne for the officially sanctioned fund raiser between Asia XI versus ICC XI. Several other India stars had also taken part in that match which was a huge success. 

He will return to Mumbai Tuesday.

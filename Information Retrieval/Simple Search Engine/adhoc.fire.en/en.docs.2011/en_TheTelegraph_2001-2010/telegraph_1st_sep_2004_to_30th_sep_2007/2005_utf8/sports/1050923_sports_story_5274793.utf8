 Kartik shines for Lancashire 

London: Murali Kartik continued with his demolition act as he scalped four for 43 to help Lancashire bundle out Leicestershire for 165 on Day I of the Frizzell County Championship Division II match at Old Trafford. 

Lancashire closed the day at 61 for two in 25 overs on Wednesday. 

The left-arm spinner removed opener John Maunders (40) leg before wicket and then took three successive wickets in the space of 23 runs. 

The Indian had his second leg-before victim in Paul Nixon (11) while Ottis Gibson (2) fell cheaply when he was stumped by Gareth Cross. Kartik got H.D. Ackerman caught by Stuart Law when he was just two short of his half century. 

Another Indian, Dinesh Mongia, failed with the bat as he was dismissed for two for Leicestershire.

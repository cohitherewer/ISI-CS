The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mahesh-Sania to hit the roads in Bangalore 

Bangalore: Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza will play a fun-filled tennis on the street game here on Monday as part of a build-up for the Sunfeast Open WTA meet to be held in Calcutta from September 19-23. 

The game will be played in front of the Vidhana Soudha, the state secretariat building, according to a press release from the organisers. 

The Tier III event, with a prize-money of $170,000, will feature top Indian duo Sania and Shikha Uberoi besides a clutch of top international players. The tournament is being organised jointly by Bhupathis company Globosport and the West Bengal state government. 

Meanwhile, Sania said she had played her best and put in 200 per cent at Wimbledon, where she lost a close three-setter to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the second round. 

I gave what I had and I played my best. Winning and losing is all part of the game. I gave it my 200 per cent, Sania said. 

It does not really matter whether you are playing against the fifth seeded or are 75th seeded, what matters is putting in all your best.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sania confirmed

Hyderabad: Sania Mirza?s direct entry into the French Open women?s singles main draw has been confirmed, her father said on Friday. 

?Sania got the entry into the main draw by virtue of her current ranking (73) and she will be playing the claycourt Grand Slam, but fitness is top of her priority list?, Imran Mirza said. The French Open begins at the Roland Garros in Paris on May 23. 

He added that John Gloster, the physio of the Indian cricket team, had a look at Sania?s ankle injury and all the reports. ?Gloster said he will be giving his advice only after the reassessment tests are done after the prescribed 12-day period of rest,? Mirza senior said. (PTI)

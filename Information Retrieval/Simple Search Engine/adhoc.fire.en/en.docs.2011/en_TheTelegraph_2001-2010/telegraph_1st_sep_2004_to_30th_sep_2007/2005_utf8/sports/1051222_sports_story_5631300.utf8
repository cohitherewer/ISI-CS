Ahmedabad: Greg Chappell on Wednesday said the failure of the top-order, especially the openers, is a cause for concern ahead of the tour to Pakistan. 

 It is a cause for concern. The opposition opening bowlers unfortunately seem to be quite good in getting our openers. But the middle-order and lower-order have done well. Its been an opportunity for them, said the Team India coach. 

Gautam Gambhirs failures havent been too pleasing for Chappell, but he hasnt run out of favour either. There were some good signs, but Gautam needs to spend more time in the middle. Thats the case with all batsmen. You are never going to have all six batsmen scoring runs in one match. So Im not overly concerned. 

The tail-enders getting runs have worked to Indias advantage. Weve worked on different aspects, from technique to footwork to talking about batting. Its a combination of many events, one of which is opportunity. 

Chappell said his thoughts hadnt yet turned to Pakistan. No mate, we havent won this game yet. We wish to finish and then focus elsewhere. 

He also informed there wont be any conditioning camp before the tour which begins next month. We wont have a long-duration camp. Weve had a lot of cricket, so well just get together the day before we leave. We have a preparatory game and that should help us to work on various aspects. 

Chappell also took the opportunity to reflect on the recent performances. Im happy with most aspects of what weve done. We can always get better. The big thing is the patience and perseverance weve shown. These havent been the easiest wickets to bowl sides out on. There are a lot of things weve learnt about ourselves, and we need to keep working on all aspects. 

The way the third Test has unfolded has left him happy. We would have liked to finish it today (Wednesday) but that doesnt always happen. It is a five-day game and we arent doing too badly if we finish it on the fifth day. The Sri Lankans batted well. 

He also explained the rationale behind delaying the declaration on the fourth morning. We wanted to make sure the dew dried out and didnt have to bowl with a wet ball. 

What was the reason behind opening with Harbhajan Singh? The new ball tends to bounce a little more. We have worked out that about 40 overs is the period for it... Its more to do with the conditions. 

Chappell also said playing against Sri Lanka in the one-dayers helped him plan for the Test series. We learnt certain things about them in the ODIs which we could exploit and put pressure on later. They had a brief moment in Chennai but weve largely dominated.

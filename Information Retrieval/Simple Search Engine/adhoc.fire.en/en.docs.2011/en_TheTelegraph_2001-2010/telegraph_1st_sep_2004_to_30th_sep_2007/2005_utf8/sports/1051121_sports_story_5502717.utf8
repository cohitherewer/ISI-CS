The Indian tallied one-under 287 to finish tied seventh at the Chi Linh Star Golf and Country Club. 

Amandeep Johl (71) ended tied 12th, while Mukesh Kumar, looking good for a top-five finish, faltered in the closing stages dropping three shots in two holes ? the 15th and 16th ? and ended tied 14th. 

Thailands Thaworn Wiratchant, who has looked amazingly good in the second half of the season, added another title to his kitty, his fourth this year, with a cautious one-under 71, that saw him finish at seven-under 281 and two clear of the second placed Chris Rodgers, with whom he shared the top spot overnight.

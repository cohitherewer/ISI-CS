The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Paes heaps praise on Prakash

Jaipur: Davis Cup captain Leander Paes on Friday heaped praise on Prakash Amritraj, saying his stupendous performance against Uzbekistan was a pointer that Indian tennis was heading in the right direction. 

Paes said Amritraj and Harsh Mankad have provided the team with more options for the singles, and the former in particular has the potential of turning into a very good doubles player. 

?It is just a thought, and not definitely for this tie. He has a strong double-handed backhand and that could make him a very good doubles player,? he said. ?He is sure a player who can take over from me.? 

?We are definitely going in the right direction. We have more options now. In Prakash and Harsh we have two solid singles players,? Paes said after India took a 2-0 lead over Uzbekistan in the Asia-Oceania group I second round tie at the Jai Club courts here on Friday. 

?For the first time since Ramesh Krishnan we have a singles player whom we can look up to. Prakash has made a big jump in his performance. 

?Though I had given the team a 1-0 lead, he had to play good tennis. The first set was important and he came out in flying colours,? said Paes. 

Paes also showed high regard for Mankad who had to give way to his captain in the singles. ?It is a tough decision to ask your No.1 player to sit down, particularly when he is coming from reaching a semi-final of a tournament,? he said. (PTI)

 Bangla beat India 2-0

New Delhi: The Indian under-20 football team went down 0-2 to Bangladesh under-23 on Monday in their last league encounter of the Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Yangon, Myanmar. 

This is Indias third loss in the tournament. The Indians, who took this tournament as a preparation for the Asian U-20 qualifiers, gave a dismal show by scoring one goal and conceding 16 in three matches. 

Myanmar and China played out a goalless draw in the other match of the day. The hosts will take on Bangladesh in the final on November 2.

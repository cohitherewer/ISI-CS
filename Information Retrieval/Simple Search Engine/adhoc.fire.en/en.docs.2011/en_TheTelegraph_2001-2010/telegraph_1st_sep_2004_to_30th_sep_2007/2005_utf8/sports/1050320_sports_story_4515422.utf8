The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan sack Subrata, bring in Amal

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan sacked coach Subrata 

Bhattacharya on Saturday and asked Amal Dutta to take charge. 

Mohun Bagan officials held an emergency meeting with the special officers in the evening and quickly decided to oust Bhattacharya. Dutta was contacted straightaway and he agreed to take charge from Sunday. 

Shyamal Sen, one of the special officers, had a late night meeting with Dutta to explain what was expected of him. It is learnt that Dutta has been asked to guide Mohun Bagan for their nine remaining National League matches and try and haul them out of possible relegation. 

Bhattacharya?s fate was virtually sealed following back-to-back defeats in Goa, against Fransa and Salgaocar. 

Mohun Bagan, who have just 15 points from 13 games, are struggling to stay in the elite tier of the competition. 

Bhattacharya, sacked two seasons back, was brought 

back last year at Aloke Mukherjee?s expense. The team was facing relegation then 

and Bhattacharya did manage to pull the team out of hot waters.

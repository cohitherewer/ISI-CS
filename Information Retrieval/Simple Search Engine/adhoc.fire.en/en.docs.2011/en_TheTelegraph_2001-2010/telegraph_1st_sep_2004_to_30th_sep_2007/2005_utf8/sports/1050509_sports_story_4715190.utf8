 Lanka propose 5-ODI tour of India

Colombo: India and Sri Lanka will clash in at least eight one-day Internationals in August, according to a proposal drawn up by Sri Lankas government-run cricket board. 

India will join the West Indies and the hosts in a tri-series from August 2-14 before Sri Lanka travel to India two days later for five more one-dayers, an official said on Sunday. 

The five matches in India are to make up for the one-day series in April that was cancelled due to the reluctance of Indian players to take part soon after a gruelling tour by Pakistan. 

?We are confident the Indian board will accept our proposal,? Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief-executive Duleep Mendis said. 

?It was the Indians who postponed our five one-dayers in April. We have now proposed to them that we can tour in August.? 

The Indian board has not yet reacted to the proposal. 

The interim committee appointed by Sri Lankas sports ministry in March to run the SLC has devised a busy schedule for the national team. 

 The West Indies will tour the island nation for two Test matches in July followed by the tri-series with India where each team plays the other twice in the league before the final. 

After the proposed five-match series in India, the Sri Lankans will return home to face Bangladesh in two Tests and three one-dayers in September. 

 India will tour Zimbabwe in the same period for two Tests and a tri-series also featuring New Zealand. 

 India will clock a minimum of 13 one-dayers ? a maximum of 15 if they reach the final in both Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. 

Sri Lanka is also scheduled to tour India in November for three Test matches, according to the 10-year programme drawn up the International Cricket Council. (AFP)

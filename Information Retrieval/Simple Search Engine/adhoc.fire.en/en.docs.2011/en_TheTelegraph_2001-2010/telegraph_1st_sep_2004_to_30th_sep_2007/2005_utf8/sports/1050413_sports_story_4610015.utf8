The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Army XI look to end drought

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Army XI are drawing inspiration from their win over Indian Oil as they seek to end a 12-year drought when they take on BSF in the 110th Beighton Cup final on Wednesday. 

?The players are really pumped up after the way they had triumphed over Indian Oil on Monday. We are looking forward to carry that momentum to the final,? Army XI coach Gopal Chand said on the eve of the summit clash. 

Army XI, who lost to Punjab and Sind Bank in the final last year, did not lay hands on the century-old crown since 1993 ? the year they had completed the hattrick of titles. 

BSF, however, hold a slight edge over Ignace Tirkey?s team in that their experience in playing on grass may come in handy on the CC amp;FC turf. 

BSF notched up a convincing 3-0 win over Punjab Police. Their in-form strikers Marianus Lakra and Devender Kumar are in good form and coach Bhupinder Singh is banking a lot on the duo. 

If BSF can boast of having more experience, they might see the opponents? emotion something of a difficult hurdle to cross. 

?We know their spirits will be high, but we are ready for the challenge,? Bhupinder added. 

Chand, on the other hand, believed it was the performance on the day that would decide the winners.

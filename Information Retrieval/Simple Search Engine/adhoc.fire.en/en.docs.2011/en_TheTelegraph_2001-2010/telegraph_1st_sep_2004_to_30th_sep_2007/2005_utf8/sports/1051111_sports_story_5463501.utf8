The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kerala all set to defend crown

 - Curtain goes up on quarter final stage today 

 Veteran I.M. Vijayan can still be key to Keralas ambitions 

Kochi: A soccer feast awaits the football crazy fans of Kerala when the curtain goes up for the quarter-final league matches in the national football championship for Santosh Trophy at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium on Friday. 

In the inaugural match, hosts and defending champions Kerala will take on cluster I qualifier Uttar Pradesh and in the second match, formidable Maharashtra will cross swords with Services. 

Besides Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Assam, Karnataka and Goa have joined last years semi-finalists ? Kerala, Punjab, Services and Manipur, who are seeded direct into the quarter-final league. 

On the merits and demerits of the team, the onus of course will be on Kerala, seeking their second consecutive win in the prestigious tournament after their triumph in New Delhi in the last edition. 

With players like mercurial striker I.M. Vijayan and Asif Saheer, and brilliant medios Abdul Naushad and Sylvester Ignatious, the team looks better equipped in all departments of the game. 

Kochi has proved lucky for Kerala when they had won the title in 1973 defeating Railways 3-2 in the final and again in 1993, with a 2-0 win over Maharashtra. 

Three-time champion Goa, the cynosure of all eyes during the preliminary stages, where they scored 32 goals in three matches without conceding any, will be a threat to Keralas aspirations. 

Goans star striker Freddy Mascrenhas has proved unstoppable in the preliminary matches, scoring 10 goals from three matches including a hattrick against Rajasthan. Climax Lawrence, who had also scored a hattrick against Sikkim, and Antony Perreira would prove an able ally to Freddy. 

Twenty nine-time winners Bengal, without star striker Bhaichung Bhutia in their ranks, did not perform up to expectations in the preliminary matches, but are expected to play to their potential. 

Nayeem stance 

Known for his tough training regimen, India coach Syed Nayeemuddin on Thursday stressed the need for working hard. Work hard and harder to do well was his mantra for success, Nayeemuddin ? appointed for the third time in the post recently ? told reporters on the eve of the quarter-final league stage of the Santosh Trophy. 

If Santosh Trophy is played on a zonal basis, like the National Football League, it would give the players more exposure, he pointed out. 

On the likelihood of star striker I.M. Vijayan finding a place in the coaching camp under him, Nayeemuddin said: He is a fine player. If he is selected, the boys can learn a lot from him. Even if he is not selected, the boys can seek his advice, he said. 

On Bhaichung Bhutia, the coach said: He is a good player and is my old student. (PTI)

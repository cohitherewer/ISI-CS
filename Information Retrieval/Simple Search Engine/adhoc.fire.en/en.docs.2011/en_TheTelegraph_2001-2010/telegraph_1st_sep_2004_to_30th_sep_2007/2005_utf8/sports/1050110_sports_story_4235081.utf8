 IHF chief says Gagan Ajit, Pillay worth little today

 Gagan Ajit needs to get the basics right, feels Gill 

New Delhi: IHF president K.P.S. Gill has not only cast doubts over the current talent of once top players of the country like Gagan Ajit Singh and Dhanraj Pillay, he also reacted to criticism on his chopping and changing of the team, saying: ?I don?t consider the comment of those who played in the Olympics after 1966 as valid. They are not Olympians, they are losers.? 

Gill said that said that Dhanraj Pillay?s playing days are over and Gagan Ajit Singh needs to go back to the basics if he wants to make a comeback. That, at least, is the stance of the Indian Hockey Federation vis-?-vis the two most popular faces of the game in the country. 

After a lot of ambiguity over whether Punjab forward Gagan Ajit was dropped on form or discipline, Gill said the striker had lost his basic hockey sense. ?Gagan did not have a good season. He needs to redo his hockey, get the basics right. In the Olympics, he even missed straight passes. Now that he has been dropped, it should serve as an eye-opener for him,? Gill said in an interview here. 

?I am sorry (if players like Gagan), are not in the Indian team. I know his value goes down (if he is not in the team). All the endorsements are going into the head of Gagan. Sponsors are planting stories to bring him back into the team,? he said. 

On Pillay, the IHF chief said the 36-year-old was a spent force now. ?Pillay?s playing days for the country are over, although it is good that he has decided to play in the Premier Hockey League,? Gill said. 

Asked to comment on the criticism by ex-Olympians that constant changing and chopping was affecting the team?s performance, he said he did not consider their comments as ?valid?. 

?I don?t consider the comment of those who played in the Olympics after 1966 as valid. They are not Olympians, they are losers. They got a gold in the (boycott-marred) 1980 Olympics against very weak opposition. I don?t consider them as Olympians, they have vested interests,? Gill said. (PTI)

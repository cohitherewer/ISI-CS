 Mahindra ease into title round

 Barreto once again netted two out of Mahindras four goals 

Margao: Churchill Brothers defence found too hot to handle Jose Ramirez Barreto, as his clinical double strike in the second half guided Mahindra United to a resounding 4-1 win to enter the finals of the Federation Cup at Nehru stadium on Wednesday. 

After Mahindras Surkumar Singh equalised Tony Geemudu Ngozi strike in the first half, his teammate Barreto scored twice in the 52nd and 55th minute to kill Churchills hope of comeback in the match. 

Substitute Abhishek Yadav than rounded off the tally in the stoppage time to give Mahindras a comfortable win. 

Mahindra will meet the winner of Thursdays semi-finals between Sporting Clube de Goa and Salgaocar in the final on Saturday. 

Baretto was adjudged as the man-of-the-match. Referee K Shankar showed yellow card to Churchills Syed Hussain.

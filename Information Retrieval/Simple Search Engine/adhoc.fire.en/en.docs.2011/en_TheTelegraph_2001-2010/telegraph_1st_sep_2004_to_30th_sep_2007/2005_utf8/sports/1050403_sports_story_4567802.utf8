The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pat Cash to visit city in mid-May

A STAFF REPORTER

 Cash will meet trainees at the BTA junior programme 

Calcutta: Aspiring tennis champions will get the chance to interact with Pat Cash when the 1987 Wimbledon champion visits the city in mid-May. 

Cash, who runs his own academy in Gold Coast, is scheduled for a three-day visit (May 15, 16, 17) during which he will meet advanced and semi-advanced students of the Bengal Tennis Association?s junior training programme. 

The Aussie?s visit may be followed by some of the most talented local students going over to his academy. 

Announcing this at a press conference on Saturday, BTA secretary Hironmoy Chatterjee also informed that junior Davis Cup team member Rupesh Roy has finally got his visa and will leave for the Bosse Foundation (Boston) on Saturday. 

Rupesh, who has been granted a five-year visa, has a three-year renewable contract with Bosse Foundation which will manage the talented Indian?s career. 

Rupesh was originally due to travel to the US in early January but his trip got delayed due to a delay in obtaining the visa. His ranking having dropped because of non-participation in higher category meets, Bosse Foundation has redrawn Rupesh?s tournament schedule. 

The Indian will train for a fortnight in Boston before playing in ITF level 5 meets (in Lousiana and Florida) followed by two Futures events in Florida. 

He won?t make the cut for the junior French Open and Wimbledon, but the foundation has identified the US Open boys? event as a possible target for Rupesh. His progress will be evaluated after each tournament. He will be allowed to participate in events in India also. 

Meanwhile, Abhishek Mukherjee, a white badge ITF official, will officiate at Wimbledon this year.

 Deep named vice-captain

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Deep Dasgupta was on Thursday chosen vice-captain for the forthcoming Ranji Trophy season. As expected, Sourav Ganguly was named captain. Bengal open their campaign against Maharashtra in Pune from Wednesday. 

Devang Gandhi had taken charge in one-dayers once Rohan Gavaskar quit after the match versus Madhya Pradesh last season. But Devang wasnt considered this time because selectors felt he needed to be more consistent. 

THE SQUAD 

Sourav Ganguly (captain), Deep Dasgupta (vice-captain) Arindam Das, Subhomoy Das, Devang Gandhi, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul, Sourashish Lahiri, Shib Sagar Singh, Manoj Tewari, Sanjib Sanyal, Wriddiman Saha.

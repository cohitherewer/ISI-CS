 Prabhakar backs Mohinder

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India allrounder Manoj Prabhakar feels Mohinder Amarnath is best suited for being the Team India coach. 

His (Amarnaths) performance speaks for itself. Anybody can learn a lot under him, as I have. I consider him my guru. 

Prabhakar wants Jawagal Srinath as bowling coach. India definitely needs a bowling coach. Bowlers need to be motivated not only on the field, but also off it, Prabhakar said. 

I will back Srinath for his experience, fighting ability and knowledge. 

Prabhakar described Team India captain Sourav Gangulys six-match ban as harsh. Why should only the captain be hauled up? He is not the only culprit if the team bowls slowly. This is not fair.

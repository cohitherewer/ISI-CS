The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Inzy hasn?t got best out of his players?

 - The Shoaib affair has been totally mishandled by PCB and team management, feels Sohail 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Woolmer and Inzamam on Wednesday 

Chandigarh: Aamer Sohail doesn?t mince words. He is not amused by Pakistan?s poor performance in the recent past and doesn?t foresee a bright future for the side either. 

In a free-wheeling interview to The Telegraph on Wednesday, the former captain and selector spoke on a wide range of topics featuring Pakistan cricket. 

Following are excerpts 

On how Pakistan have fared so far in the opening Test 

I thought the Pakistan players did a very good job on the first day. They didn?t get a good start, yet they managed to reach 312. It shows they have the resources in batting. But as far as bowling goes, I had my doubts and it was vindicated on Wednesday. 

You can?t go into a Test with three bowlers and Inzamam-ul Haq has done just that. There is Abdul Razzaq, but he is an allrounder and you can?t expect him to pick five wickets. I don?t think this Pakistan attack is capable of taking 20 wickets. 

On the way the openers played 

I think Taufeeq Umar did well. He was making a comeback after almost a year. The last Test he played was against India. The conditions weren?t easy here. Considering the circumstances, he batted well. The problem was with the middle-order. Playing Younis Khan at No. 3 wasn?t a good decision. 

On whether he was happy with the way Inzamam-ul Haq has been leading the side 

No. Simply because Inzamam has allowed so much of chopping and changing in the side. The team had been doing so well a couple of years, in New Zealand. Then suddenly there were reports of differences within the team, Shoaib Akhtar turning out to be a rebellious figure. 

There have been so many changes... the opening combination kept changing. There has been too much experimentation. If a certain player is important to me I will not allow him to be replaced. I will sit with the selectors and convince them to retain him? You have to give him a chance, if not for a whole series, then for a few matches at least. I will always try to pick my players. I don?t think Inzamam has been able to get the best out of the players. 

On the Shoaib Akhtar saga 

He has been totally mishandled. Let?s face it, he is a star. Wherever he goes, he will attract people, the endorsements will flow his way. As a teammate, you should be proud of him rather than starting to envy him. I know him very well? he is a sort of a person who, if you sit down with and ask him to do a certain thing, will go out of his way to accommodate you. 

But if you try and stamp your authority on him, he will retaliate. People at this level have to understand man-management? The team management has to understand the psyche of each and every individual. The Shoaib affair has been mishandled in a big way. 

On who was responsible for the whole affair, the PCB or the team management 

Both will have to share the blame. The PCB chairman is the ultimate authority for a player, he is like the Supreme Court. After what happened in Australia, the chairman met Shoaib and then asked him to go to a disciplinary committee. Why did the chairman meet him then? He should have just sat down with him and sorted out the differences? Simple? Matter ends there. 

 Sohail fails to understand why the vice-captaincy 

was taken away from Youhana

On how he would have handled the whole thing if he was the captain 

I was the one who took Shoaib to South Africa in 1997. There were so many reports of his going to nightclubs when he went to England with the Pakistan A squad just before the South Africa trip. 

Look, everybody does that? it?s no big deal. I just sat with him for five minutes during one of our flights. I told him, look you know you are in the side because of me. I have taken a risk, you have got to help me out. There were no further complaints for three- and-a-half months on that tour. You?ve got to know how to handle players. 

On Bob Woolmer as coach 

I don?t think he was the right choice. Mind you, I?m not talking about how good he is. My simple point is, does he speak the same language as the players? There comes a time when a player would be better placed to express himself to a coach who speaks the same language. There are not many players who speak English in this Pakistan side, and yet, we have an English-speaking foreigner as coach. You expect players to give off their best when nobody understands him! 

India having a foreigner as coach makes sense because the literacy rate is high over here. But it?s not the same in Pakistan. Very few can speak English? how can Woolmer make a difference in such circumstances. Wrong selection. Period. 

On Yousuf Youhana being dropped as vice-captain 

That was a shock for me. Somebody who was good enough to lead in Inzamam?s absence against South Africa at home was suddenly demoted. Moreover, he was scoring runs which proved responsibility didn?t burden him. It proved he could handle the pressure. I don?t see any reason for such a change. 

Younis Khan doesn?t have an assured place in the one-day side. I don?t know why he was given the vice-captaincy.

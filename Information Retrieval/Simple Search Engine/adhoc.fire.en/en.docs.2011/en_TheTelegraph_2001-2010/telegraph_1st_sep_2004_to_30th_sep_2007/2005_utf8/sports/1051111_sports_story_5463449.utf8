The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid will be back tomorrow

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Vadodara: Rahul Dravid will be back at the helm in Saturdays seventh (and final) ODI against Sri Lanka. The Team India captain rested in Rajkot and Virender Sehwag sat in the hot seat. 

Dravid is going to lead... There shouldnt be any speculation, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Thursday evening. India are ahead 5-1. 

Meanwhile, Ajit Agarkar is much better. He missed match No.6 owing to flu and a sore throat, but is hopeful of being available for selection here. 

The support staff, incidentally, has (for now) increased with the arrival of Dr Charles Krebs.

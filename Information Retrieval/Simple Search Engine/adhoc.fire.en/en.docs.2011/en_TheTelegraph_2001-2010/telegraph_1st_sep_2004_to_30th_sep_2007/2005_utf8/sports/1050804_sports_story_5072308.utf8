 Barcelona blank Chinese champions 9-0

Macau: Barcelona put on a masterclass for their Asian fans on Wednesday with a 9-0 humiliation of Chinese champions Shenzhen Jianlibao in a pre-season friendly here. 

African player of the year Samuel Eto sent out a warning to his Primera Liga rivals with a brace while 18-year-old Argentinian sensation Lionel Messi also grabbed two in sweltering conditions at the Macau Stadium. 

World player of the year Ronaldinho cut Shenzhen to ribbons in the first half as the spanish title-holders strolled to a 3-0 lead by the break. 

Spanish striker Iniesta tapped in after a four-man move involving Henrik Larsson with 23 minutes gone. 

The Swede, on his way back from a months-long injury lay-off, was on hand to double the lead 14 minutes later, although there was a strong hint of own goal as he was challenged at the near post. 

Frenchman Ludovic Giuly then got on the end of a long, high ball from the back before rounding the keeper to make it 3-0 at half-time.

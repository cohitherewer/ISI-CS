 Big gap between Anand and us: Sasi

New Delhi: Admitting that there was still a big gap between Viswanathan Anand and the lot following him in the country, Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran said on Thursday the players lacked the consistency and great opening preparation skills of the champion. 

?There is still a big gap between Anand and rest of us. We are working at it and trying to get to that 2700 Elo rating level. But to achieve that we need to be more consistent and learn the great opening preparations of Anand,? said Sasikiran, who recently won the Sigmen chess title jointly with GM Jan Timman of The Netherlands. 

Sasikiran, who was here to receive the elite sportsman award for the year 2003-04 at the PSPB?s Silver Jubilee award function, said most of them were working with some top players in the world to improve these aspects of their game but admitted that there was a long way to go. 

On the personal front, Sasikiran said he was trying to sort out his opening problems and have been achieving some success in the recent past. 

?I am trying to sort it out. And I am quite comfortable off late. But sometimes it just goes out of control.? 

Sasikiran said his immediately goal was to improve his rating, which has dipped after he lost important points at the Aeroflot Open and other events. 

The 24-year-old player, who would be participating in a chess meet in Hungary in June, said that the game was just not demanding mentally but also physically and stressed the need on working on that aspect as well. 

?Good stamina is required to concentrate for long hours. In the Sigmen event I made a blunder in the seventh round against hector only because I was tired physically,? he said. 

On whether machine could be superior to man in this game, Sasikiran replied in the negative saying a machine could not think ahead as a human being could do and hence it could never be superior.

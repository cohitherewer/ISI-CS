 London: Formula One?s governing body has published rules for 2008 to tackle what it sees as the ?financial profligacy? of manufacturers determined to win at whatever cost.

 Measures include allowing teams to sell parts or even complete cars to each other, a single tyre supplier and engines made to last for three races.

 The international automobile federation (FIA) said the aim was to reduce significantly the cost of competing in the first season after the expiry of the sport?s existing commercial agreement.

 ?The rules must discourage financial profligacy and ensure that an independent team with ordinary commercial sponsorship... can compete with a car manufacturer prepared to spend in excess of $300 million (a year),? the FIA said in a statement. It said an acceptable budget was about $100 million.

 Paris: FIA chairman Max Mosley believes the new knock-out qualifying system imposed in Formula One will make the pre-race sessions confusing for public. ?The qualifying system for 2006 is going to be very tough to understand,? Mosley was quoted as saying on Thursday by a sports daily.

 ?I think that the public is going to be just like me when I watch an American football game. I can watch it. It?s a great show but I don?t have the slightest idea about what?s happening,? he said.

 ?It?s very annoying. I knew that qualification based on the fastest lap were not much fun for the public in the stands. But on television it was really good. You knew exactly what was going on,? he said.

 Stockholm: Olympic triple jump champion Christian Olsson is set to miss the 2006 indoor season including the World Championships after keyhole surgery on his right foot. ?It?s more or less decided that he won?t have an indoor season,? the Swede?s coach Yannick Tregaro said.

 ?Should something out of the ordinary happen there is a tiny, tiny chance that he?ll do a few competitions at the end of the indoor season, but that?s not our goal.? The World Indoors take place in Moscow in March. The 25-year-old Olsson hurt his foot when he won gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics and has since struggled with the injury.

 He has not competed this year, skipping the world championships in Helsinki in August where he would have been the title holder.

 Madrid: Cameroon striker Samuel Eto?o is mulling over whether to join up with his country in January for the African Nations Cup or to continue playing with Barcelona in the Primera Liga.

 ?I still have time to make a decision,? the 24-year-old told a Spanish daily. ?When I make my decision it will be good for everyone. There is no point in saying anything now.?

 Eto?o, who is likely to decide after the Spanish league?s winter break, has been in prolific form with Barcelona scoring 17 goals in 17 games to fire the champions to the top of the table.

 The two-time African Footballer of the Year is short-listed for a record-equalling third award for 2005.

 Madrid: Italian striker Marco Di Vaio has agreed a loan move from Valencia to Monaco until the end of the season, the player said on Thursday.

 ?I wanted a place where I would be able to play. I spoke to the coach and with Monaco, and am very pleased with the outcome,? Di Vaio told a news conference. ?They are a good side where I hope I will get to play more than I have been doing.?

 The French club have an option to buy the player in June next year.

 ?I don?t think I will return to Valencia. If the club had wanted me they would have given me the opportunity,? the international added.

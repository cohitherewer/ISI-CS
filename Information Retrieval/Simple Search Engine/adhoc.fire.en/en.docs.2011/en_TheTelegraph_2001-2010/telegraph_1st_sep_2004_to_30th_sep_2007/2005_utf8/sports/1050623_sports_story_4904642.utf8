 Brazil colts, Germany in last-8 showdown

Enschede (Netherlands): Defending champions Brazil beat Syria 1-0 and Germany edged China 3-2 to set up a clash of soccer giants in the quarter finals of the world youth championship. 

Italy will meet Mexico in another quarter final on Friday. Italy beat the United States, burdened by a hapless Freddy Adu, 3-1 and Morocco squeezed past Japan 1-0 with an injury-time goal. 

Adu missed his second penalty of the tournament and never lived up to the hype that he was to be the star of the tournament as the Americans disintegrated in the second half on Tuesday. 

The worst tournament I ever played, personally, said the 16-year-old Adu. It is a huge disappointment. 

US coach Sigi Schmid said Adus lack of presence made it feel like they were a man down in the round-of-16 match. 

I didnt think he showed up today, Schmid said. He was not an impact on the game, he needs to be an impact on the game. 

Attention now turns to the Brazil versus Germany clash, a junior version of the 2002 World Cup final which Brazil won 2-0. 

Germany only qualified as a lucky third-placed finisher and now hope to continue winning. I hope that we also have chances in our next match, Germany coach Michael Skibbe said. Brazil have one of the best teams in the tournament. (AP)

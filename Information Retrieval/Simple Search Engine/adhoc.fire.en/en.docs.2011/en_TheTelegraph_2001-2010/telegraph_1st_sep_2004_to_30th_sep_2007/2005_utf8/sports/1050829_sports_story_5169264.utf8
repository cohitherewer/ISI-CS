 India no match for China

New Delhi: Indias challenge in the team championships ended after they lost tamely to China in the quarter finals of the 17th Asian Table Tennis Championship in Jeju Island (South Korea) on Sunday. 

Title favourites China blanked India 3-0 in both mens and womens team events, according to information received here on Sunday. 

Sharath Kamal went down in straight sets to world No. 1 Wang Liqin in the opening match. Soumyadeep Roy was also handed a three-game drubbing by Chinas Wang Hao. 

The last match saw Subhajit Saha putting up some fight against Chen Qi. The Indian won the second game but ultimately went down 5-11, 12-10, 7-11, 4-11. 

While the Chinese men took less than an hour to reach the semis, their womens team had an even easier outing against India. 

Earlier, the Indian men registered a 3-0 win against Turkmenistan and Thailand to reach the quarter finals. 

In the womens section, India lost to Japan but defeated Macau and Malaysia to set up a meeting with China.

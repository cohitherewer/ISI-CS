 WADA to make sure Games are clean

Montreal: The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will work with China to insure its national anti-doping measures are sufficient to weed out drug cheats before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, WADA president Dick Pound said Monday. 

Well work with the Chinese to make sure their anti-doping apparatus is adequate, Pound said. We know the Chinese dont want to be embarrassed by having cheats at their own Games. 

Pounds comments came during the 11th world swimming championships sanctioned by international aquatics federation FINA ? which was rocked by a series of drugs scandals in the 1990s involving China. 

Seven swimmers tested positive for the steroid dihydrotestosterone at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, which so decimated the squad that China won only one swimming gold at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. 

The decline was only temporary and by 1998 Chinas women were rising back to the top ? until four more positive tests and the discovery of human growth hormone in a leading swimmers luggage before that years world championships in Perth. 

In April 2002, Ying Shan, a member of Chinas world record-setting 4x100m freestyle team from 1997 world short course championships and compatriot Jiawei Zhou tested positive for an anabolic steroid. 

Pound said FINAs response to the Chinese cases, and to a sprinkling of high profile cases from other countries, had made it harder to cheat in swimming. 

But Pound reiterated the impossibility of weeding out 100 percent of the cheaters. Im kind of cynical about these things, he said. In many cases, if you havent tested positive, that only means you havent tested positive... (AFP)

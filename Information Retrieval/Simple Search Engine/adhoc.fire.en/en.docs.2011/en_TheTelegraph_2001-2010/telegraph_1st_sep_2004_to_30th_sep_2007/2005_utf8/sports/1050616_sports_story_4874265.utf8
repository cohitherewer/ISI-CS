The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 What a shock, says Montgomery

Los Angeles: Former world 100m record holder Tim Montgomery said he was stunned at the news that Jamaicas Asafa Powell had broken his record by running 9.77s in Athens. 

What a shock! said Montgomery, whose girlfriend Marion Jones has been implicated, along with him, in the Balco laboratory drugs scandal. 

For me, its a real surprise. I am surprised for several reasons. Firstly, that we are at the beginning of the season and normally these sort of times comes at the end of the campaign (Montgomery set his mark in September, in 2002). 

Then it appears that he ran alone, by which I mean he did not have athletes of a similar level to push him. It is always easier with decent rivals (Montgomery was pushed by subsequently disgraced British European 100m champion Dwain Chambers). 

Before we were used to seeing the names of Montgomery or (Maurice) Greene (the previous record holder but who was sitting in the stands when Montgomery broke his record) and now there is the arrival of Asafa, it is good for the sport. 

He runs well. The records are there to be broken. 

However, the former wannabe American footballer, who opted for athletics after breaking his arm, vowed he would try and regain his mark, despite never nearing it since he set the record. 

I tell you that I am really going to work hard to regain my record, he said. (AFP)

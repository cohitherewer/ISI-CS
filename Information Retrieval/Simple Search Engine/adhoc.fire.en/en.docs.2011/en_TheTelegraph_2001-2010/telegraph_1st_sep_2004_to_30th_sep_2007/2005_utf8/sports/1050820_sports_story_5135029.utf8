 Big-headed seniors should quit: Rajinder 

Amstelveen: A furious Indian hockey coach, Rajinder Singh (Jr), has asked some of the big-headed seniors to quit the game after the side finished the league engagements in the RaboBank Trophy here without a point. 

Yet another insipid show against Pakistan on Thursday saw India crashing to their third defeat on the trot in the eight-nation championship, prompting the coach to blame the seniors for the debacle. The defeat meant that India would be playing England on Saturday to avoid the wooden spoon. 

Giving vent to his feelings, Rajinder, in an apparent reference to players like strikers Gagan Ajit Singh, Deepak Thakur and Prabhjot Singh, ridiculed these big-headed seniors with over six years experience at the highest level. He said these players failed in the basics like ball trapping and made several blind mispasses. 

I cannot teach them all this in the camps. If they cant do this, they should voluntarily stop playing, he said. (PTI)

Bangalore: The national selectors Tuesday named a list of 36 probables for the upcoming triangular series in Sri Lanka after a meeting that lasted over three hours. 

Railway pacer Harvinder Singh staged a comeback to national reckoning after a four-year gap while all the other established players, barring Sachin Tendulkar, found a place in the list announced by BCCI secretary S. K. Nair here. 

Talented Uttar Pradesh allrounder Suresh Raina and left-hand Gujarat batsman Neeraj Patel have been included along with Bengal pacers Ranadeb Bose and Shib Shankar Paul. Rohan Gavaskar, though, does not find a place. 

Tendulkar, who recently had a surgery on a troublesome elbow, has been ruled out of action for 14 weeks and was therefore not considered for the camps to be held at the National Cricket Academy here in three phases. 

However, Tendulkar, who was undergoing rehabilitation, would be present in Bangalore on the first few days of the last camp. He will interact with the coach, who wants him to be here, Nair informed. 

Nair said the first camp to deal with physical conditioning of the fast bowlers would be held from June 27 to July 4. It would be followed by a conditioning camp for the probables from July 5 to 12 before a final cricket camp from July 13 to 22. 

Nair said the players, doing duty for various English counties, have been exempted from attending the first two camps. 

He said the final squad for the tri-series, also involving hosts Sri Lanka and the West Indies, would be announced on July 18. The team was expected to leave on July 24. The 18-year-old Raina and stylish left-handed batsman Patel were rewarded for their consistent performances in the domestic circuit. Both were in the India A side that played against Pakistan in a three-day match in Dharmshala in March. 

Harvinder, in the wilderness for close to four years, forced his way back into reckoning with a rich scalp of wickets in domestic matches. The 27-year-old pacer had played his last one-day against Kenya in Port Elizabeth, South Africa in 2001. 

Pacers S Sreeshanth (Kerala), Siddharth Trivedi (Gujarat) and Jesuraj (Tamil Nadu) were some of the other new faces in the probables list.

 London: India?s left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan was chosen as the International Sports Personality of the Year 2004 at a glittering awards ceremony here. Former flamboyant batsman and wicketkeeper Farokh Engineer was conferred the ?Lifetime Achievement Award? instituted by Sony Entertainment Television. Pathan outvoted Sri Lanka?s Muttiah Muralidharan and world No. 1 golfer Fiji?s Vijai Singh in a keen contest. Pathan, though, was not present.

 ?After exceptional performances against Australia and Pakistan, Irfan Pathan celebrated winning the Young Player of the Year award at the ICC awards here in summer. He ended 2004 by achieving personal best figures of 11 for 96 against Bangladesh in Dhaka,? the award citation said.

 Frankfurt: A German referee suspected of possibly manipulating the result of a German Cup match and betting on it has resigned, the German football association (DFB) said on Saturday. Robert Hoyzer, 25, was under investigation by the DFB for suspected betting on the result of the first round tie between SC Paderborn and Hamburg SV last August. The DFB said in a statement that he had resigned on Friday evening.

 Paderborn pulled off a surprise 4-2 victory over the first division team in the game in August 2004. Hoyzer sent off Hamburg striker Emile Mpenza in the first half for insulting him and awarded two penalties to Paderborn. The DFB said it suspected Hoyzer had sought to influence the result of the game and was considering bringing a charge of unsporting conduct against him.

 Bastia (Corsica): Switzerland defender Bernt Haas has joined Bastia on a six-month contract from West Bromwich Albion, the French Ligue 1 club said on Saturday. The 26-year-old was put on the transfer list this month by manager Bryan Robson who said he could not guarantee the Swiss player first team football.

 Miami: Former heavyweight boxer Shannon Briggs was ordered to pay $2 million to former University of Miami lineman Brian Stinson for breaking his eye socket during a nightclub fight in 2001. Jurors on Friday sided with Stinson, who said his football career was cut short because of the injuries. 

 ?This was not a fight,? said Stinson?s lawyer. ?This was a brutal beating.?

 A doctor testified that Stinson has limited vision in his left eye. The player was forced to miss scouting camps and now works as a counselor at a university in Washington. Briggs said he would appeal. ?I am a big target and people think I have big pockets,? he said. 

 ?It was a football party and I was a boxer. I shouldn?t have been there.?

 Cotonou: Benin have qualified for the world youth championships later this year just a week after their goalkeeper was killed at the African championships in Cotonou. 

 A 3-3 draw with Mali on Saturday meant Benin?s under-20 team finished second behind Nigeria in their group to reach the semi-finals of the African youth championships, which they are hosting. 

 The top four finishers at the tournament qualify for the world youth championships in the Netherlands in June.

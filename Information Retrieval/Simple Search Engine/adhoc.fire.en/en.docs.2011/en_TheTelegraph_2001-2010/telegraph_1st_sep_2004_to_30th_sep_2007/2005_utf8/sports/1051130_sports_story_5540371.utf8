Adelaide: Australia cruised to a seven-wicket victory on Tuesday to complete a 3-0 sweep of the Test series versus the West Indies. 

Chasing 182, the Australians raced to victory 16 minutes into the middle session of the final day at Adelaide Oval after resuming on 76 for two. 

Opener Matthew Hayden finished 87 not out, narrowly missing the chance to become the third player in Test history to make hundreds in five successive Tests. First-innings centurion Mike Hussey hit the winning run to finish unbeaten on 30. 

I think we played some very good cricket, theres no doubt about that, Australian captain Ricky Ponting said. 

Australia lost one wicket on the last day with Brad Hodge dismissed for 23. 

Meanwhile, Shane Warne was found not guilty of dissent. Warne was ordered to appear before Match Referee Mike Procter on Monday after being reported by umpires Billy Bowden, Aleem Dar and third umpire Steve Davis.

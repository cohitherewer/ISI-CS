Johannesburg: Herschelle Gibbs punished struggling England with his first century for a year to keep South Africa in the hunt after the third day of the fourth Test in Johannesburg on Saturday. 

Gibbs, dropped off the penultimate ball of the day, was unbeaten on 136 at stumps, with South Africa 306 for six in reply to England?s first innings of 411 for eight declared. 

Gibbs batted for seven hours, facing 272 balls and hitting 20 fours. It was his 14th Test hundred. 

Wicketkeeper Mark Boucher, left out of South Africa?s last five Tests, scored 64 in a sixth-wicket stand of 120. 

England, hoping for the same damp, overcast conditions of the previous day, had declared on their overnight score, with captain Michael Vaughan on 82 not out. 

But their attack, deprived for much of the day of injured strike bowler Steve Harmison and with James Anderson badly out of touch, wilted badly as the sun shone throughout the day. 

Two of their bowlers also made visits to hospital during the day. 

Seamer Matthew Hoggard carried most of the workload, taking four for 101 including that of dangerman Jacques Kallis. Kallis, with two centuries and two half-centuries in the first three matches, played on for 33. 

The five-match series is level at 1-1. 

Gibbs? last century was the 192 he scored against the West Indies at Centurion last January. 

He and fellow opener Graeme Smith had scored freely early on against some poor bowling, Harmison sending down just two overs with the new ball before making way for swing bowler Anderson. 

But in the 16th over after a stand of 64, Hoggard struck Smith below the knee and plumb in front to dismiss him leg-before for 29, Smith?s embarrassment complete as he collapsed to the ground after missing the ball. 

South Africa were 75 for two when Jacques Rudolph, on four, slashed a drive off Hoggard to Ashley Giles in the gully. The left-arm spinner dislocated his right thumb but returned to the field after a precautionary X-ray. 

Gibbs and Kallis batted steadily to add 63 more for the third wicket before, midway through the second session, Kallis leapt off the ground to play a lifter from Hoggard and edged it onto his leg stump. 

Boeta Dippenaar then edged a full delivery from Andrew Flintoff low to Marcus Trescothick at first slip to be dismissed without scoring and AB de Villiers top-edged a hook off Hoggard to go for 19 and make it 184 for five. 

Gibbs went to his century with a swept four off Giles during the final session and he and Boucher took the fight to the bowlers in an increasingly dominant partnership. 

It was ended seven balls before the close when Boucher slapped a wide delivery uppishly to backward point. He batted for more than two hours, faced 90 balls and hit 11 fours. 

England?s misery was complete when wicketkeeper Geraint Jones, diving across first slip, dropped Gibbs off Flintoff with the penultimate ball of the day?s play. 

Harmison left the field with an injured left calf 45 minutes before tea. His leg was scanned and he returned to the fray in the final session but was not risked as a bowler. 

Bad light and rain restricted Friday?s play to 38.2 overs, and the start of Saturday?s play was delayed for 20 minutes by overnight rain.

 President wont be elected: HC 

 - Mohun Bagan polls on schedule 

OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta: A division bench of the Calcutta High Court, comprising Justice P. Samanta and Justice M. Sinha, declined on Tuesday to change the schedule of the election to the Mohun Bagan executive committee. The election will be held on September 18. 

The court, however, said in its order that there would no election for the posts of one president and five vice-presidents of the club. 

The elected executive committee members will select the president and vice-presidents as per the exiting rule of the club, the division bench observed. 

The bench directed the three special officers ? S.P. Roy Chowdhury, Jayanta Mitra and Rabilal Moitra ? to issue a corrigendum announcing that there would be no election to the posts of the club president and vice-presidents along with the election of executive committee members before casting of votes. 

Members, who have already filed their nomination paper seeking election to the posts of the president and vice-presidents, will have the right to fight the election as a candidate for the post of executive committee members. The special officers will have the liberty to extend the date for filing of nomination for these candidates, the court order said. 

The court orders followed a petition by a club member challenging the special officers decision to hold election to the posts of president and vice-presidents. 

Three special officers appointed by the court to hold the club election were present in the court during the hearing of the case. 

Meanwhile, the court also appointed an inspector to scrutinise the voters list of the East Bengal club. The rival faction of the club, who lost in the election held last year, alleged, in a petition in the court, that a number of false voters had voted in favour of the ruling group.

 London: Second row forward Liam Botham has retired from professional rugby after suffering a series of neck injuries. The son of former England cricketer Ian Botham concluded that family life must take precedence and announced his retirement aged just 27.

 ?I had a scan and saw a neuro-specialist? he said give it a rest,? Liam was quoted as saying on his club Wigan Warriors? website on Wednesday. ?You have to weigh the options up... I have children to think about and I have put myself first for once.

 ?I could have played for another year and maybe fingers crossed I wouldn?t get another knock but you can?t play this sport if you are not 100 per cent.? Liam started his sporting career as a professional cricketer for Hampshire. He switched to rugby in 1996 with West Hartlepool to avoid inevitable comparison with his famous father. Two years ago we were seen as streets paved with gold. That is over. Chelsea is now being run properly. The club is being run as a business,? chief executive Peter Kenyon said.

We have been drawn home in the next round, and it would be great for the local community to host an FA Cup game at Mile End Stadium.?Sporting Bengal United was established in 1996 to push forward Asian football in England, and was awarded senior status in 2003.

 Another rider, Amy Gillett, was killed instantly. The other injured women ? Kate Nichols, Katie Brown and Lorian Graham ? were treated in hospital for their injuries and have already returned to Australia.

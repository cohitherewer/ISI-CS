The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Hoping I would be recalled kept me going?

 - I would have quit had the selectors overlooked me for India: Arshad Khan 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lahore: Had off-spinner Arshad Khan not got 

a call-up for the tour of India, he would have quit at the end of this season. 

Khan, who turns 34 next month, made his last Pakistan appearance in November 2000. 

?Yes, that?s a long time back... Hoping that I would 

be recalled is what kept me going each season. However, I would have quit had 

the selectors overlooked me for India as well,? Khan told The Telegraph. 

Speaking at the Gaddafi on Friday morning, he added: ?Of course, it?s great to be back... What?s comforting is that I?ve toured India and the conditions won?t be very different from Pakistan.? 

Asked whether the pressure of bowling to arguably the finest players of spin could get to him, Khan replied: ?The pressure, I feel, won?t last more than 10-15 minutes... In any case, I?ll have to back myself.? 

The Peshawar-based Khan has played eight Tests (30 

wickets) and 48 ODIs (44 wickets). Over the next few weeks, though, he?s going 

to have opportunities to improve his CV.

 Batting failures dont worry Vaughan

 - It was not an ideal subcontinent wicket

Rawalpindi: England captain Michael Vaughan is not worried about Englands batting failures in their opening tour match in Pakistan. 

No, it is not a worry. This was a practice match and it was not played in a Test match environment. We have the mental resolve for Test cricket, he told at a press conference after England conjured a 52-run victory against PCB Patrons XI. 

Englands only stand-out batting performance in the low-scoring game came from opener Marcus Trescothick who scored 124 and 38, when batting at nine, without being dismissed. 

Reserve wicketkeeper Mattthew Prior also made 50 in the first innings. Vaughan said on Wednesday, he was not happy with his own batting in the match. He collected just nine runs and said he would spend a lot of time in the nets. 

You have to say some of their guys were decent bowlers who put the ball in the right places and had good pace, said Vaughan. 

England were bowled out for 112 in the second innings before uncapped pacer Liam Plunkett took four wickets, and 7/57 in the match, to dismiss the Patrons XI for 105. 

Vaughan said Plunkett had a lot of potential. But it is too early to say if he will be in the Test squad. 

The first Test begins in Multan on November 12 after a three-day match against Pakistan A. 

We will be happy if they have a similar pitch in Multan because our bowlers are used to bowling on such seaming tracks. But I doubt that will happen. 

We would have liked to have got more batting practice, spend more time out in the middle. We didnt get many runs but the bowlers got a good workout in the game, Vaughan said. 

England will be joined by all-rounder Andrew Flintoff and fast bowler Steve Harmison in Lahore against Pakistan A. 

We will probably play our so-called Test XI in the second practice match in Lahore. But we havent established our Test XI as yet. 

Vaughan also raised his doubts that the wickets prepared for the upcoming Test series will aid his seam bowling attack. 

The wicket was not an ideal subcontinent wicket, Vaughan said. I very much doubt, that we will get that type of wicket in the Test matches in a couple of weeks time. 

If we get such wicket in the Test matches well be happy because our seamers are used to bowling on such tracks, he added.

 Sanskaras was a gutsy win 

 STAR RACER

 Although trainer Daniel David and Vijay Singh dominated last Fridays eight-event card, they missed out what mattered most ? the Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes. It was trainer Bharath Singh who had the pleasure of seeing his hard work pay off when his filly triumphed handsomely.

 Sanskaras easy victory was also an answer to Bharaths critics who, of late, were questioning his primitive training methods. Patience is the name of the game, according to the crafty trainer. Bharath had lost about half of his string to Javed Khans stable about two months ago.

 Coming back to the Derby; Sanskara did face strong resistance from the 7-10 course favourite, Rasalas, in the final furlong of the race but the Dont Forget Me-Shiseido daughter bravely countered it as her jockey Suraj Narredu maintained his composure till the end.

 It was a fast run race, yet Sanskara found the going slow prompting Suraj to push the filly into the lead passing the half-way mark. The jockey never eased up the pressure on Sanskara even in the final stretch and the strategy paid off when Rasalas drew alongside and threatened to sail pass. Sanskara, however, changed gear and went beyond Rasalas and his jockey B. Prakashs reach for a two-length victory ? a gutsy win.

 Daniel, nevertheless, led in four winners, including Bold Raider who completed a back-to-back win, albeit hardly in a convincing manner to bag the Prince Blossom Cup. A handy second till top of the home turn, jockey Imran Chisty sent Bold Raider into a two-length lead but he never pushed the 6-10 favourite hard enough to draw away from the field. As a result of this, a quietly fancied Magic Mantra inched his way up in the last 150m and nearly caused the damage. Steinlen was a good third and the one for the notebook.

 Earlier in the afternoon, Chisty had partnered Daniels Regal Empress to victory over Javed Khans Express Rose who was trying to win from the start but found the winner a hard nut to crack.

 Prakash did have a winner on the day ? Young Warrior in the Best Of All Handicap. But it was Daniel who bore the brunt of the Warriors victory in view of the wretched record of the horse in the past.

 An enquiry ordered into the improved performance of the Warrior prompted stewards to fine the trainer Rs 10,000 and also warned him against repetition of such practice ? a narrow escape.

 Jockey G. Ross completed Daniels tally of four after Wayward King, too, had a narrow escape in the Alamito Handicap. Ross was lucky that it was a weak jockey, Som Singh, in the opposition, otherwise Javeds Actuary would have emerged victorious in stead of going down by a short neck.

 Vijays treble gained through Alcalde, Aleksei and Clockwork can be summed up in a sentence ? all three won almost from the start and at short odds. However, Aleksei could have been a worrying factor had he injured himself in the paddock. The prized three-year-old was unruly, unseated his jockey C. Alford and bolted. The horse also hit the barricade bar but was brave enough to overcome everything ? at least his six-length victory in the 1,400m Star Of Italy Cup never indicated any discomfiture.

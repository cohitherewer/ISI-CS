 - We hope to continue making progress: Moody

Mumbai: Sri Lankan coach Tom Moody said on Friday that he did not believe the visitors had an advantage over the home team in the forthcoming seven-match series after the recent changes in the Indian side. Rahul Dravid has taken over from Sourav Ganguly as captain for the series. 

I dont think so. The Indian batting still has a lot of depth and they are a very good side, Moody said at a media conference after his teams first net session at the Cricket Club of India here after reaching Mumbai last night. 

Obviously India are playing on home soil and in familiar surrounds and Sri Lanka are coming here after 7-8 years. But that does not stop us from going into the contest with a lot of confidence, the former Australian cricketer said. 

Moody said the tour offered them a huge challenge with seven matches in a row but at the same time allowed the squad to gel. 

We have made some progress and hope to continue to do so. This tour gives us a good opportunity to gel together. We are looking forward to the challenge of playing seven ODIs in a row and its a big challenge for both teams, he said. 

Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu expressed surprise that it took six years (Sri Lankas last visit to India was in 1998-99 for the tri-series also featuring Pakistan) for them to come here while India have visited the emerald island quite a few times in the intervening period. 

Its a long time since we have come here though India have visited Sri Lanka more than a couple of times during this period, he said. 

The Lankans are to play a warm-up match here against a MCA Presidents XI before the one-day series begins in Nagpur on Tuesday. 

Asked about veteran Sanath Jayasuriyas freak shoulder injury which he sustained while playing waterpolo during the camp back home, Atapattu said the left-handed batsman would not be handicapped while batting due to the injured shoulder. 

It will not affect his batting, but we have to wait and see whether he would be able to bowl during the series, he said. Atapattu added that Jayasuriya would definitely be playing Saturdays warm-up game as he has been out of match practice. 

We have almost finalised (the team) we want to play in Nagpur, and barring giving a chance to one or two youngsters and resting those who have been playing regularly of late, we would go with our best team tomorrow, he said.

East London: Kevin Pietersen scored the fastest century by an England player in one-day cricket against South Africa in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday and then drew praise from both captains for his achievement. 

South Africa won the fifth one-day International by seven runs to take a 3-1 lead in the seven-match series but Pietersen stole the home side?s thunder by smashing the last ball over the mid-wicket boundary for six to reach his second century. 

South African-born Pietersen was 100 not out off 69 balls, and had the consolation of pulling a six off the last ball from Andre Nel to reach his century. Vaughan looked forward to the day when Pietersen and allrounder Andrew Flintoff, who has returned home for ankle surgery, are able to play in the same team. 

?It?s going to be quite something when we get him and Freddie Flintoff in the middle order together,? Vaughan said. 

Smith, who scored an unbeaten 115 ? his second century in three matches ? also paid tribute to Pietersen?s run of form. ?We gave him too many chances, if we got him early we could have won by 60 runs.? (REUTERS)

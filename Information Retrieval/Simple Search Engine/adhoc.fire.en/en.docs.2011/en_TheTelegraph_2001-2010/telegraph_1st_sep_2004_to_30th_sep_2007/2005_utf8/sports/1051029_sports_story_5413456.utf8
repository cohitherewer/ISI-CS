 Cricket not all about boundaries, sixes

I am a right-handed batsman. I have a weakness against inswinging deliveries, and as a result I often get bowled. Please help. 

(Abhishek Gupta, 17, Baripada) 

Watch your balance. Make sure you dont fall over with your front foot or get too far across with the front foot. Also ensure your bat comes down nice and straight. 

I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try to sweep I end up getting bowled round my legs. Please help. 

(Tamajit Patra, Durgapur) 

You are obviously getting yourself into a wrong position. Watch the line of the ball closely and adjust front foot accordingly. 

I am not very comfortable playing strokes on the front foot. How do I improve? 

 (Rohit Agarwal, 15, Tinsukia) 

Through practice. When you are knocking, make sure you ask the bowler to pitch up so that you can play shots on the front foot. 

I am a right-handed batsman. I make runs very slowly and that often leads to trouble within the team. The problem is that I am afraid to play big strokes. 

What do I do? (Ripan Datta, Dhanbad) 

Look to work the balls in the gaps. This game is not all about boundaries and sixes. Ones and twos are equally important. 

I am a right-handed batsman. I had a long lay-off because of injury and since then I have struggled to get my rhythm back. Please help. 

(Sayan Roy, 17, Calcutta-42) 

Its a common problem, so dont worry. You need to spend a lot of time in the nets. 

How does one improve slip catching? Will only practice help? 

(Ravi Sharma, 21, Calcutta-84) 

Yes. Also watch the ball come into your hands as closely as possible. Plus, work with your coach on the right techniques. 

I am a wicketkeeper and weak on the leg-side. I always try and follow the ball coming out of the bowlers hand but the problem on the leg side persists. How can I improve? 

(Suvam Mishra, 19, Bhubaneswar) 

Work on your footwork movement sideways. 

I have a huge backlift and my coach says it will cause problems when facing genuine quick bowlers. Is it true? Should I try and reduce the backlift? 

(S. Mohan, 19, Calcutta) 

Your coach should know. Follow the advice and see how you feel. 

I am a right-handed batsman. I often get caught at square leg when attempting to flick. Please help. 

(Ranajay Bhattacharjee, 17, Agartala) 

Play as late as possible with your weight on top of the ball. At the moment you are reaching for the ball and playing it early. 

I am a graduate and want to be a commentator? How does one go about it? 

(Brajendra Mishra, 21, Calcutta-34) 

Listen as much as you can to radio and TV and try to understand the discipline first. Also try and increase your vocabulary.

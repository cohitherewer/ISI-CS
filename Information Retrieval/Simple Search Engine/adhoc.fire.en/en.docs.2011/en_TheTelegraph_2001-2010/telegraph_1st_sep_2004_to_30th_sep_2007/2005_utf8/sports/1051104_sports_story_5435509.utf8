The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Another chance for Sourav to impress

Mumbai: All the attention would be centred on Sourav Ganguly when he leads East Zone in the four-day Duleep Trophy league tie against Zimbabwe Presidents XI beginning at the Cricket Club of India on Friday. 

After being ignored for the third to fifth ODI against Sri Lanka despite scoring a century against North Zone in Rajkot, the Bengal southpaw would try to make another big impression on the five wise men with a big knock against the African outfit. 

Sourav, who arrived here on Thursday evening, did not show any signs of his elbow trouble in scoring a ton against the North attack as east powered to victory riding on his innings. 

Another encore from the former India captain here, although against a team that was routed inside three days by North last week, would only strengthen his chances of a recall to the national team which is on a triumphant run against Lanka. 

It was learnt that East Zone may have one change from the team that played against North Zone in Rajkot. If the wicket is found to be a slow turner, offie Sourashish Lahiri might get look in in place of S.S. Rao. An outright win for East would propel them into the November 12-16 final in Ahmedabad. 

THE TEAMS 

East Zone: Sourav Ganguly (captain), Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Arindam Das, Rohan Gavaskar, Shib Shankar Paul, Ranadeb Bose, Shiv Sundar Das, Deep Dasgupta, Shiv Shankar Rao/Sourashish Lahiri, Shahbaz Nadeem, Vasanth Saravanan. 

Zimbabwe Presidents XI (from): Hamilton Masakadza (captain), Andy Blignaut, Neil Ferreira, Terry Duffin, Keith Dabengwa, Charles Coventry, Vusimuzi Sibananda, Brendan Taylor, Dion Ebrahim, Waddington Mwayenga, Blessing Mahwire, Prosper Utseya, Graeme Cremer, Anthony Ireland. 

Umpires: B. A. Jamula and S. D. Ranade. 

Fit Kaif the Central figure 

Meanwhile, in Aurangabad, bBuoyed by the presence of Mohammed Kaif, Central Zone will look to prop their performance as they take on West Zone. Kaif, who was nursing a hamstring injury, will try to impress the selectors who will pick the national squad for the last two matches against Lankans on November 6. (Agencies)

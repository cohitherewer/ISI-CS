 Digvijay clinches Gurgaon title

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Digvijay Singh broke a year-long title-drought to annex the Rs 25 lakh Airtel Masters at the par 72 Classic Golf Resort in Gurgaon. 

Digvijay?s first Amby Valley PGAI Tour title win of the season came courtesy a tournament tally of 18-under 270 which was aided by a final round of five-under 67. The winner pocketed a whopping Rs 4.05 lakh for his effort, according to information reaching here. 

Shiv Kapur who had a terrible start to his round fought back in style to return three-under 69 for sole second position at 12-under 276. 

Promising Chandigarh golfer Harinder Gupta, a rookie like Shiv, finished third at ten-under 278 bringing back the day?s best card at 66, while the quartet of Dinesh Kumar, Gaurav Ghei, Vijay Kumar and Vishal Singh finished tied-fourth at 280. 

Ashok Kumar also fired 66 to finish tied-eighth with Sandeep Syal who at one point of time today occupied the sole second position behind Digvijay Singh. Jeev Milkha Singh returned a second successive under-par effort.

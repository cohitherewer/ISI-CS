 Borgetti makes up for penalty mess

Hanover: Jared Borgetti turned from villain to hero as his goal gave Mexico a stunning 1-0 win over world champions Brazil to seal a place in the semi-finals of the Confederations Cup Sunday. 

Borgetti, who failed to score in the first half despite taking a penalty three times, emerged as Mexicos match-winner by glancing home a 59th-minute header when he escaped his marker Kaka and left goalkeeper Dida stranded (reported briefly in the Late City edition of Monday). 

Mexico, who defended superbly and in goalkeeper Oswaldo Sanchez had the Man of the Match, are now unbeaten in 19 matches since Brazil beat them 4-0 in the Copa America last July. 

Mexico join Germany and Argentina in the semi-finals, after they qualified from Group A on Saturday. Brazil will meet Japan in Cologne, on Wednesday, to decide who take the remaining place in the last four. 

Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who according to some records was in charge of his 100th international, said: They made it a very difficult match for us. They are in excepttional physical condition and they have very good co-ordination on the ball as well. Very good ball skills. 

At the same time we had several opportunities that could have been converted and changed the game but we simply didnt convert them. 

It was special for me, a very special goal and I celebrated it with more enthusiasm than I might have done otherwise, said Borgetti. 

Both teams had plenty of chances with a total of 27 shots or headers on goal but while Mexico found the net the Brazilians squandered all of their 19 goal attempts. They were unfortunate to be denied an equaliser after 68 minutes, though, when Adriano was ruled just offside after powering in a header from a Kaka cross. 

Ronaldinho, who tried to inspire his team without much reward, summed up their night afterwards. We created lots of chances but they took advantage of a set piece and scored. We have to train hard to avoid making the same mistakes again. 

Mexico were awarded a penalty by the referee Roberto Rosetti in the 30 th minute after Roque Junior clumsily bundled Borgetti over. Borgetti slammed the penalty past goalkeeper Dida but Rosetti ruled that Mexicos Francisco Fonseca had encroached on the kick and ordered a re-take. 

Borgetti now slammed his spot kick against the bar. Rosetti again signalled a re-take because Dida had moved off his line. Dida, however, saved this time by diving high to his right.

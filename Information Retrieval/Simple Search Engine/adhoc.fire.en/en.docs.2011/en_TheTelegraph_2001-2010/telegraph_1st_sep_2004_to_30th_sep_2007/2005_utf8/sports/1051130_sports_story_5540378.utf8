The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No end of road for Dalmiya, says Abdullah

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: As expected, the designated hotel for the BCCI elections was a beehive of activity from the early hours of Tuesday. The process got underway shortly after 11.30 am and it was minutes after 1 pm that the Sharad Pawar group was celebrating victory. 

Heres what some of the leading figures had to say on the outcome: 

Dr Farooq Abdullah: There was need for a change and it took place in a healthy way. Like the several elections I have fought in, this was held in a democratic manner. Last year, I felt like running away from Calcutta. 

This will be seen as a rebirth of Jagmohan Dalmiya, a more cooperative and supportive Dalmiya. There is no end of the road for a good horse. He has served as president of the ICC? I dont think Dalmiya is finished. 

Inderjit Singh Bindra: The win is not a surprise for us. It turned out just as we expected it to. 

Raj Singh Dungarpur: We won and it was an easy one. But there are lots of challenges ahead of us. We will try to bring more transparency, professionalism and honesty in the Board. The coach and captain should be given voting rights. 

What has Jagmohan Dalmiya done for the game in the country? There should be a CEO to run the Board. Even countries like Zimbabwe and Bangladesh have such a post. 

Ranbir Singh Mahendra: Himachals vote was taken away from us. Everything went against us. The Indian team played well during my tenure as President? If they continue with my policies, they will emerge champions in the 2007 World Cup. 

Niranjan Shah: The election process has been completed smoothly. We need three to four days to settle down. 

A decision on the Chappell finger issue, players contracts, sponsorship and marketing rights can only be taken after we go through all the papers? It would take some time.

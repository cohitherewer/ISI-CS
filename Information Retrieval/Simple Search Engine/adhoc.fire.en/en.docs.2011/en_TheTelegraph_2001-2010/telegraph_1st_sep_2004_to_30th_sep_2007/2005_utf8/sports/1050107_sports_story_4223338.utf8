The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Our next tennis star will be a woman: Bhupathi

 - ?Shikha, Neha and Sania can take India to a different level? 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

Chennai: Winning doubles matches is an art Mahesh Bhupathi mastered more than a decade ago. He has managed to maintain his position of being one of the world?s top five doubles players over a considerable period of time. Now, in a span of three years, he has established himself as a successful businessman, utilising his star status. 

Busy meeting corporates when not practising tennis or playing matches, time is always at a premium when Bhupathi is in India. The country?s first Grand Slam champion still agreed to spare half an hour for The Telegraph Thursday morning to discuss sport and business. 

The following are excerpts 

 Q What guides you while looking for a 

 new doubles partner? 

 A I look for basically two things. Someone 

 who can play well from the forehand court because I prefer 

 the left court. Also, someone who has got the experience 

 of winning Grand Slams and Masters Series meets as my aim 

 is to win as many of these big tournaments as possible. 

 So Todd Woodbridge fits the bill perfectly? 

 I was keen on playing with Leander (Paes) 

 this year? we discussed it a couple of times but finally 

 it didn?t work out. Considering that I didn?t have a partner 

 (for 2005) till the end of November, I would say this is 

 a good arrangement. But Todd wasn?t my first choice. 

 Why do you say that? Woodbridge is one of the 

 most successful doubles players of all time with heaps of 

 big titles under his belt? 

 True, be we haven?t done well as a team. 

 We?ve played thrice but not won a single title yet. We have 

 to work hard to cultivate our partnership. 

 Leander feels someone over 30 who has been on 

 the Tour for 10-15 years, should ideally have a younger 

 partner?

 I don?t agree with that theory. I think 

 experience counts more than age. 

 You have been backing women?s tennis a lot. 

 Any particular reason?

 I believe India?s next tennis star will 

 be a woman. We?ve got three exciting talents right now in 

 Sania (Mirza) and the Uberoi sisters (Shikha and Neha). 

 Sania?s already beaten a top-100 player, Shikha won around 

 at the US Open after coming through the qualifiers, Neha?s 

 got huge potential too. The two (US-based) sisters have 

 got the permission to play for India and once they start 

 winning matches donning Indian colours, people will know 

 how good they are. They have the ability to take Indian 

 tennis to a different level. 

 You are not optimistic about our next generation 

 of male players? 

 From what we?ve seen this week, there?s 

 a big gap between Indian men and women potential-wise. It?s 

 not that our system produced champions consistently over 

 the years. A Vijay Amritraj and a Ramesh Krishnan surfaced 

 from nowhere, then a Leander Paes or a Mahesh Bhupathi. 

 I just hope another world-class player emerges sooner than 

 later. 

 You are an active player, a businessman and 

 a family man. How do you balance the three roles?

 It?s not easy, for sure. My first love 

 is tennis, I just love the game, love travelling. My wife 

 (Shweta) travels with me extensively, so family life is 

 taken care of. Yes, I have to put in a lot of extra work 

 for my company, which normally I wouldn?t have to do. But 

 I have grown to like it. After all, this is something, which 

 will sustain me for the next 20 years. 

 You?ve said there?s still three-four years of 

 tennis left in you. Don?t you think a time might come in 

 that period when your company work will affect your tennis? 

 See, ATP cut down prize-money in doubles 

 two years ago. The focus for me is now mainly on the four 

 Grand Slams, nine Masters Series meets and three-four World 

 Series events like this one in Chennai. So we are talking 

 of 20-22 weeks a year. The rest of the year I?m free to 

 pursue my other interests. 

 Say, for example, you have a big final coming 

 up in Paris and you get a call about an important business 

 meeting or a financial deal? 

 Most of the corporates/clients I deal with 

 understand how important tennis is for me. Even if such 

 a clash comes up, I know they will wait for my tennis to 

 finish. Shweta has been extremely supportive and very much 

 hands-on with company work. She?s the one who put the company 

 policies in place and handles the finances as well. I?m 

 also lucky to have some young people working for the company 

 who are very committed and efficient. 

 You?ve brought two WTA meets to India, what 

 next? Do you have an ATP event in mind? 

 I am done for 2005 but yes, an ATP meet 

 is in my thoughts for the future. It?s very difficult to 

 get a new event scheduled in the calendar, unless some regular 

 meet gives up its slot or agrees to sell it to a second 

 party. It?s actually tougher getting a slot in the ATP calendar 

 than convincing sponsors to back the event. 

 You are making inroads into the entertainment 

 industry too? 

 Yes, we have two divisions. Globosport 

 manages and promotes sportspersons and events, while Grapevine 

 takes care of the entertainment side. We have just signed 

 up actor Saif Ali Khan. In a month or two, we?ll finalise 

 deals with two more film stars. 

 Why not something more for sport? 

 Apart from tennis players, we manage cricketers. 

 I am also in the process of setting up a champions? trust 

 which will help fund young talents to train abroad for five 

 years. After every Olympics, we hear people abusing sportspersons 

 for returning empty-handed. Everyone says this should be 

 done and that should be rectified, but tell me, does anyone 

 actually do anything constructive? Once the funds are mobilised, 

 I plan to send 15-20 kids from different disciplines for 

 long-term foreign training. Let?s face it, we can?t produce 

 champions training our sportspersons in India, they have 

 to go abroad. 

 Finally, do you see yourself as a pioneer? 

 I don?t know whether I?m a pioneer or not. 

 The Indian economy is booming or should I say flying. I?m 

 glad I came in at the right time. What I?m doing benefits 

 me as well as a host of others.

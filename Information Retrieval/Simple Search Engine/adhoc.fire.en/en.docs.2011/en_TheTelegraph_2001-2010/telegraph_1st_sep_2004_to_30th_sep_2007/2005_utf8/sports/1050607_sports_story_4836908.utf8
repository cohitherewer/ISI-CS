 Scripting beautiful things in tennis, the Nadal way

 - Hes going to become a legend ? I think he has the mental strength to beat records: Puerta

Paris: Rafael Nadal is the French Open champion, no? 

Well, yes. 

No became yes ? or si, that is ? on a cloudy afternoon at Roland Garros. The question became an emphatic answer when the fourth-seeded Nadal of Spain fulfilled his destiny and vast expectations, defeating unseeded Mariano Puerta of Argentina, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 6-1, 7-5 in the French Open final Sunday. 

Nadal celebrated, again, as he did after defeating Roger Federer of Switzerland in the semi-finals, by wearing clay on his back, dropping to the dirt when Puerta finally succumbed after three hours 24 minutes by pushing a forehand wide. He won the title in his first attempt, matching the feat of Mats Wilander, who also needed four sets in defeating Guillermo Vilas in the 1982 final. 

Is one of the best moments in my career, no? Nadal said, continuing his habit of putting the word no at the end of most sentences. 

The significance of his accomplishment was underlined when the first spectator to personally congratulate the 19-year-old from Mallorca was King Juan Carlos of Spain. Real Madrid soccer star and Frenchman Zinedine Zidane was on hand to present the trophy to Nadal and the youngster held it tightly, looking as if he had no intention of letting it go. 

 That day may not come for some time. A summation of his abilities and nod to Nadals future came from the person best equipped to do so, the other left-hander on the court, Puerta. 

Puerta sounded as though this would be the first of many Grand Slam titles for Nadal, who will be No. 3 in the world when the mens rankings are released Monday. 

I think we are talking about someone who is going to write a page in the history of tennis, Puerta said. He already wrote that page in the history of tennis. Personally, I think hes going to do beautiful things in tennis, like (Michael) Chang did in his own time, or (Andre) Agassi. 

Hes going to become a legend of tennis. I think he has the mental strength to beat records. 

The opening page in the first chapter was compelling. 

 It had dramatic shot-making, the threat of rain and Nadals animated sense of self. Just as important, he had a great foil across the net. 

Puerta, 26, who had never advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam event, was an unexpected opponent but a worthy one. An early injury timeout to have his upper right leg taped seemed to release Puertas nerves, after he had trailed, 1-3. And he took advantage of Nadals late first-set tentativeness, grabbing the tiebreaker with some poised shot-making. 

Teenage tension on such an important occasion was only natural, said Nadals uncle and coach Toni. If you are not nervous before a Roland Garros final, you must be on [something], Toni Nadal said in Spanish. 

On this day of so many firsts, there was one more for Nadal when he climbed into the stands to greet his parents and other family members, including his uncles Toni and former Spanish international soccer star Miguel Angel Nadal. 

For the first time, I cried after winning a match, Nadal said. It never happened before. ... I didnt think I was going to cry, but my whole family was very emotional.

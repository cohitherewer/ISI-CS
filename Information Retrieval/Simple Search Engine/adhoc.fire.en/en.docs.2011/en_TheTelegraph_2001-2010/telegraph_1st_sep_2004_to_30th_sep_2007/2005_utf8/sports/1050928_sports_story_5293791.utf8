 Ginepri up

Bangkok: Third seed Robby Ginepri was given a scare in the first round of the Thailand Open on Tuesday before beating home player Danai Udomchoke 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. 

Thai fans did have something to cheer about later, however, as seventh seed Paradorn Srichaphan beat Taiwanese qualifier Ti Chen 6-3, 6-4. 

Britains Andy Murray, who needs one more victory to realise his ambition this year of breaking into the worlds top 100, overcame George Bastl of Switzerland 6-2, 6-4 while Mark Philippoussis served for victory at 5-4 in the final set of his match but was beaten 6-7, 6-2, 5-7 by Gilles Muller.

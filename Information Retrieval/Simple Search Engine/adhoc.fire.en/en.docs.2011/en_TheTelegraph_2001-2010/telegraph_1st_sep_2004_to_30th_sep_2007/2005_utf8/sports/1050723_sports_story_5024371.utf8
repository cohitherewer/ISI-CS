 Guerini claims 19th stage

Le Puy-en-Velay (France): Italian Giuseppe Guerini clinched his second Tour de France win when he claimed the 19th stage over 153.5 km from Issoire to Le Puy-en-Velay on Friday. 

Guerini, a winner at LAlpe dHuez in 1999, beat second-placed Frenchman Sandy Casar and Italian Franco Pellizotti, who came home third. 

Six-time champion Lance Armstrong, who finished with the main pack four-and-a-half minutes behind Guerini, retained his 2:46 overall lead over Italian Ivan Basso. 

Guerinis victory was the second in this years Tour for T-Mobile, who had already won in Briancon with Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov. 

Guerini, 35, was the least likely rider in the break to win here as he is essentially a climber. But he attacked 1.5 km from the finish and caught his companions off guard.

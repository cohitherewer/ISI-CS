 Too early to decide on Gibbs, Boje: UCBSA

 - TOUR OF INDIA

Durban: The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) said it had so far not selected its team for the tour of India in November and it was too early to speculate whether Nicky Boje and Herschelle Gibbs would be part of the squad. However, the duo didnt tour India last year. 

The names of the players selected for the Indian tour would only be announced sometime late in October, UCBSA spokesperson Moabi Litheko said. 

Both Boje and Gibbs are apprehensive to tour India as the Indian authorities have not given them any assurance that they would not be arrested in connection with match-fixing scandal in 2000. 

Litheko said the board had written to Indian authorities in June on the issue but had not heard anything so far. 

The two players did not tour last year because they were concerned about their status in India. We had written a letter to the Indian authorities through our high commission in New Delhi in June this year about their status but have not yet heard anything, he said. 

Litheko said they were currently preparing for the visit of New Zealand who would play five one-day Internationals in October. 

South Africa will play five one-day Internationals against India in November. 

The two players were allegedly involved with late former South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje in match-fixing during South Africas tour to India in 2000.

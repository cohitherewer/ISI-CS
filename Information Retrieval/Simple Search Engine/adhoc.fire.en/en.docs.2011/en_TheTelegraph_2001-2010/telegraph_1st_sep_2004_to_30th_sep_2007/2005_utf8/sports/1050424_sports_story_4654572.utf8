 Paes-Zimonjic duo in semis

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic entered the semi-finals of the $850,000 Barcelona Open claycourt meet on Friday. According to information received here, the second seeds overcame Czechs Frantisek Cermak and Leos Friedl 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. 

Paes and Zimonjic will meet Simon Aspelin (Sweden) and Todd Perry (Australia) next. The Indo-Serbian team had got a first-round bye. 

Meanwhile, Harsh Mankad had a great run at the $25,000 Nottingham Challenger this week. The Indian Davis Cupper scalped two higher-ranked players ? world No. 130 and third seed Ivo Heuberger (Switzerland) and Swede Filip Prpic (No. 260) ? before falling to Czech Robin Vik in the last four. 

The 22 points Mankad earned should take him inside the top-250 when next week?s ATP rankings are released. The 25-year-old son of former Test batsman Ashok Mankad has garnered 98 points since January when he did well to qualify for the Chennai Open. 

Mankad?s teammate Prakash Amritraj won a couple of rounds in Nottingham before losing to American Justin Gimelstob.

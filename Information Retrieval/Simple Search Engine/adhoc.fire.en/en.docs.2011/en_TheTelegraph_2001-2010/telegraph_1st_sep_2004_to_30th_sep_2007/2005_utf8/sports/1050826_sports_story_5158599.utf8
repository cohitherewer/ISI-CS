 Pakistan board miffed at Inzamams exclusion

 - Sachin rsquo;s inclusion contradicts selectors rsquo; logic of picking 

 fit players: Zaheer

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has expressed its disappointment over the exclusion of Inzamam-ul Haq from the World XI team for the Super Series against Australia but said that it would not take the matter to the International Cricket Council (ICC). 

PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said that he was personally disappointed about Inzamams exclusion. 

As the chairman of PCB, I am disappointed because Inzamam is a class act and a proven performer and deserved to be in the team. But while saying this, I add that I respect and accept the selection process and would not take the matter to the ICC, said Shaharyar. 

The selectors have their own criteria? They must have taken an overview of every player, including present and past performances against Australia in Australia. 

Inzamam led Asia in last weeks Afro-Asian series. He averages 94 in Tests and 52 in one day Internationals this year. However against the world champions he has an averages of 34 in Tests and 32 in the ODIs. 

Interestingly, the selectors have appointed Graeme Smith as World XIs Test captain despite the fact that he has not played any Test in Australia. Likewise, Shaun Pollock has been appointed ODI captain although the South African board sacked him after the 2003 World Cup. 

In contrast to Shaharyars stand, former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas demanded that PCB should inquire on what grounds the selectors picked an unfit Sachin Tendulkar but overlooked a much fitter and seasoned Inzamam. 

The ICC should investigate and dig out the facts, its their job. I think Inzamams exclusion proves that PCB once again failed to lobby to get its deserving demand accepted. 

While I am surprised at Inzamams exclusion, I am equally surprised at Sachins selection. No doubt he is a world-class player, but Sachins inclusion contradicts selection committees logic of picking players on fitness and form, said Zaheer.

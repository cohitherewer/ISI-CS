 The ? 800m question

 - Why Glazer is persisting with his bid for United 

Andrew Murray-Watson 

 Malcolm Glazer 

Malcolm Glazer, the billionaire US sports tycoon, has become the fairytale big bad wolf to Manchester United and its legions of devoted fans. Last week, for the third time in a year, Glazer huffed and puffed and threatened to blow the house down if Manchester United?s board didn?t back his ?800m takeover proposal for the club. 

Late on Friday, Manchester United released a statement rejecting Glazer?s latest proposal at 300p a share. The board argued that the structure of the deal, which includes ?300m of debt, could put undue strain on the club?s finances. The board went so far as to say that if a formal offer did emerge, it would be unlikely to be able to recommend it. 

However, Glazer gained a tiny bit of encouragement. For the first time the Manchester United board acknowledged that 300p per share did indeed represent ?fair value? for the club. Meanwhile, Manchester United grudgingly admitted that it was obliged to allow Glazer and his advisers to look at its books. 

And now JP McManus and John Magnier, the Irish billionaires who own 29 percent of United, have decided that 300p per share does not do justice to the club?s long-term potential. Their decision is a severe blow to Glazer, but he may not be ready to go away. There is even speculation that he could call an emergency meeting to try to oust the entire board. 

But why is anyone prepared to pay ?800m for a club that analysts believe is massively overvalued at its current price of 270.25p per share, let alone 300p? And why do McManus and Magnier believe the club is worth even more than that in the long term? 

Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein say Manchester United is worth no more than 240p a share. For the first half of this year, the club is expected to post a pre-tax profit of ? 16.9m ? a 36.9 per cent fall on the ? 26.9m for the first half of 2004. 

Even stripping out the increased amount spent on new players (most notably the ? 27m paid for Wayne Rooney), underlying pre-tax profit is expected to be ? 29.9m, a fall of 20.1 per cent on the ? 37.4m recorded in the first half of 2004. Pre-tax profit for the whole of 2005 is expected tobe ? 38.5m, compared with ? 52.7m in 2004. 

Even if in 2005 United succeeds spectacularly on the pitch and matches its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) in 2004 of ? 58.2m, a ? 800m takeover of United would value the club at a price to earnings ratio of over 27.8. This compares with an average for the leisure sector of 16.5. 

But of course, Manchester United is not a straightforward acquisition. It is, by market capitalisation and profitability, the largest football (or ?soccer? if you are Glazer) club in the world, as well as the most powerful sporting brand on the planet. 

The intriguing issue is whether Glazer and McManus and Mangier have identified areas in which they can squeeze more revenue out of the club. Glazer and his advisers are thought to have closely studied the club?s income from media rights. 

Currently, United gets a share of the collective TV rights negotiated by the Premiership with broadcasters ?worth ?1.6bn over three years. Of that sum, ?1.024bn is paid by BSkyB for domestic rights, while the BBC chips in ? 105m and mobile and ?near live? broadcasters contribute a further ? 100m. Overseas media rights to 195 countries are worth ?320m and are split equally between the 20 Premiership clubs. 

In 2004, United picked up ? 62.5m in media revenues and will pocket a similar amount this year if the team reaches the final of the Champions League and wins the Premiership. When the media rights come up for renegotiation in two years, United could break from the pack and attempt to negotiate directly with broadcasters. 

In order to do this, United would have to convince the European Commission that the ?collective selling? approach used by the Premiership is illegal for competition reasons. A less disruptive approach for the club would be to further promote United TV, its own channel, and internet broadcasting rights in overseas markets. 

The club can already broadcast matches from its website at midnight the day after a match, but this brings in annual revenues of only ? 1.5m. Analysts believe that United?s brand power and overseas fan base are responsible for bringing in about half the value of the Premiership?s international media rights. 

So there is the chance that if it could secure a proportionate share of those rights, it would pocket ?50m a year rather than the current ?5m. Suddenly the ?800m price tag starts to look less expensive. 

United have lucrative, long-term marketing and sponsorship deals with Vodafone and Nike and it is hard to see what Glazer could add. However, rather than sell and lease back Old Trafford, as many fans fear, Glazer could follow Arsenal?s lead and seek a sponsor for its stadium, although the US sports tycoon has not given any indication that such a plan forms part of his thinking. 

Emirates paid ?100m to sponsor the London clubs new stadium for the next 15 years. Old Trafford, which will have more seats than Ashburton Grove, could command a similar sponsorship sum. Fans, led by Shareholders United, are still concerned that the club?s revenues will be drained as Glazer needs to pay off the debt used to fund a bid. 

Last year, United paid out ? 7m in dividends to shareholders, but this is outweighed by the estimated ?20m that Glazer would have to pay out per year in interest on his ?300m loan from JP Morgan. 

However, most private equity type deals come with significant tax advantages and it is likely that if Glazer buys United, he will be able to reduce the club?s ? 8.5m tax bill in 2004.

 Sachin can score 100 tons: Steve

Dubai: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh believes Sachin Tendulkar could become the first batsman to score 100 centuries in international cricket. 

?If anyone can score 100 centuries in international cricket, it will be Sachin Tendulkar,? said Waugh, who is on a business visit here. 

?Tendulkar has already got 71 hundreds from Tests and one-dayers. He has it in him to score another 30 more provided his body supports him,? Waugh was quoted as saying by Gulf News. 

Waugh, who has most number of wins as a captain but failed to win a series in India, also said Sourav Ganguly?s men were catching up with the world champions. 

?India is closing up. England is also emerging pretty well and so is South Africa,? he said. 

?Pakistan has amazing talent and coach Bob Woolmer could mould them into a good team soon.? 

Waugh said he was close to completing his book that he has been writing since his retirement in 2004 January. 

?I have already written 150,000 words. It takes a look back at my career. 

?I?ve been doing a lot of research and hopefully it should be ready by November,? he said.

 Villeneuve hopes to make amends

 Villeneuve says his Monaco manoeuvre was misjudged 

London: Former champion Jacques Villeneuve hopes to make amends to Sauber at the Nuerburgring on Sunday after costing the Formula One team a fistful of points in Monaco last weekend. 

I look forward to making up for the bad race in Monaco, the Canadian said in his website. 

We are a third of the way through the season already and I think we now have a good working pace with the team so we must be able to build on this. 

Peter Sauber described his drivers performance in Monaco as the most depressing thing that a team can experience after Villeneuve tried to overtake Brazilian teammate Felipe Massa and instead took them both out of the points. 

They were running sixth and seventh at the time. 

Both Villeneuve and Massa were summoned to the teams Hinwil factory to discuss what happened. 

I have told both drivers that I dont want to discuss this issue with them in the paddock, because there are too many emotions at the surface at the moment, the website quoted Sauber as saying after the race. 

So we will meet in Hinwil this week to discuss the situation. They dont normally come to the factory after the races but this was a very serious situation and we have to speak together. 

A team spokesman said there would be no further comment from Sauber about the incident and would not confirm whether the meeting had happened. Its a family affair and has to be discussed within the family, he added. 

Villeneuve said he had spoken to Massa after the race and explained what had happened. 

He completely understood and confirmed to me that his tyres could not hold the same pace as mine at this point, said the Canadian, who had tried to go past Massa at Ste Devote but braked too late and forced the Brazilian down an escape road. 

Villeneuve, who damaged his front wing when he hit the barriers and had to pit for a replacement, acknowledged that his manoeuvre had been misjudged. 

BMW silent 

Meanwhile, BMW has declined to comment on a newspaper report on Tuesday that it may buy the Swiss Formula One team Sauber, another report adds from Munich. 

Citing F1 sources, a German newspaper reported that BMW was considering buying the Sauber team as a way to boost its racing profile. The report added that such a deal would cost BMW at least 150 million euros ($190 million). 

The fact is that we are negotiating with Sauber about providing motors from 2006. Everything else is speculation on which we dont comment, a BMW spokesman said. 

He said the motor talks should take a few more weeks. BMW said they should wrap up by the end of June. 

Speculation has swirled for weeks that BMW may change its Formula One focus because of the disappointing performance of its Williams team. However, the team took second through Nick Heidfeld and third (Mark Webber) in Sundays Monaco GP.

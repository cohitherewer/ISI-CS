 Search on for John Dyson replacement

Colombo: Sri Lanka will start the hunt for a new cricket coach next week after the completion of John Dyson?s 20-month contract. 

The new government-appointed committee in charge of Sri Lanka Cricket, headed by businessman Jayantha Dharmadasa, is due to meet officially to discuss the issue Monday, although preliminary talks have already taken place. 

?As John Dysons contract has now expired the recruitment of a new coach is a very high priority and will be discussed in the coming week,? board secretary Tryphon Mirando said. ?We want to recruit a new coach as soon as possible for at least a two-year tenure so we can start our thinking and planning for the future.? 

A fresh contract for Australian Dyson is a possibility with the board due to contact him this week to discuss what his terms would be for an extension. 

?We want to talk to as many possible good candidates that are interested before making our final decision,? Mirando added. 

Former Sri Lanka coach Dav Whatmore, who left Sri Lanka after the 2003 World Cup to take up a two-year assignment with Bangladesh, is one name that will be discussed. 

Whatmore is in the frame for the India job, available after John Wright?s departure, and has been offered a contract extension by Bangladesh. 

Former Australia captain Steve Waugh has also been linked with the Sri Lanka job. 

Sri Lanka made steady progress during Dyson?s tenure but failed to achieve great success overseas, winning only against a weak Zimbabwe team last year. 

Dyson made a farewell speech to the team after the second Test defeat against New Zealand last week before returning home to Sydney but indicated he might consider staying on.

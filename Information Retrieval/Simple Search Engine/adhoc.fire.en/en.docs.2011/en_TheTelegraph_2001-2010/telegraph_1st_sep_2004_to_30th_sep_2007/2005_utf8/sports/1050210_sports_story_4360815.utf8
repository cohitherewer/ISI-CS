Hyderabad: Sania Mirza scored an upset victory over Chinese fourth seed Jie Zheng to storm into the quarter finals of the $140,000 Hyderabad Open women?s tennis tournament on Wednesday. 

The 18-year-old Indian sensation overcame mid-match blues to oust Zheng 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 in an exciting centre court action at the Sports Authoritity of Andhra Pradesh Sports Complex in the tier 4 WTA Tour event. 

Late into the evening, the legendary Martina Navratilova and German Anna-Lena Graenefeld had little trouble in beating Japanese Shiho Hisamatsu and Remi Tezuku 6-2, 6-1 in Round I. 

The 48-year-old Navratilova, playing for the first time on the Indian soil, was delighted with her performance. ?I?m very excited. It was pretty good. 6-2, 6-1.... Hope more matches will be like that,? she laughed. ?It was fun; it was a learning experience.? 

Paying tribute to the noisy crowd, Navratilova said: ?It?a an intimate stadium. It?s fantastic. Court plays well. No complaints. It?s a first-class tournament.? 

Sania, fresh from her exploits at the Australian Open, virtually set the stands on fire with her superlative performance. This would be her first quarter final appearance at this level of an event. 

In the first two editions, she had been knocked out in the first round. 

The Hyderabad lass now faces a comparatively easier opponent in Israel?s Tzipora Obziler, the world No. 115 and unseeded here, who earlier in the day brushed aside Evie Dominikovic of Australia 6-3, 6-2 to reach the last eight stage. 

Sixth seed and former champion Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand was shown the door by China?s Tian Tian Sun. The Chinese won 6-2, 6-1 to storm into the quarter finals. 

The 23-year-old from Beijing, who had won the doubles gold at last year?s Olympics giving her country the first-ever tennis medal, had no difficulty in disposing off world No. 67 Tanasugarn, who failed to put her acts together in what turned to be surprisingly a one-sided encounter. 

Sun was in total command and never allowed her opponent, the winner of the first edition here in 2003, to stage a come-back. 

Sun, ranked 138 in the world and unseeded here, will now meet second seeded Anna-Lena Groaenfeld of Germany, the doubles partner of tennis legend Martina Navratilova. 

The German, who was finalist at the Volvo Open in Thailand, where Conchita Martinez emerged victorious, won 6-3, 6-2 against Slovakian qualifier Jarmila Gajdosova. 

Unseeded Tzipora Obziler of Israel also cruised into the last eight stage with an identical 6-3, 6-2 win over Evie Dominikovic of Australia. 

Alyona Bondarenko from Ukraine scored a hard-fought 6-3, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4 win over Hungary?s Melinda Czink to enter the quarter finals. 

After pocketing the first set easily, world No. 107 Bondarenko was challenged in the second set by Czink, who rallied remarkably. (PTI)

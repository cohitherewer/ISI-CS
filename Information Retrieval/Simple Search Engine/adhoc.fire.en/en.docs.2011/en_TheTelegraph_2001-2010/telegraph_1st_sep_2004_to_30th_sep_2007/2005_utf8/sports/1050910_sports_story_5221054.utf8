Calcutta: Mohammed Azlan Iskandar of Malaysia and Shahier Razik Canada moved to into the title-decider with contrasting semi-final wins at the Calcutta International Squash Championship at the Calcutta Racket Club courts on Friday. 

Top seed Iskandar routed the challenge of Pakistani qualifier Khayal Muhammad Khan 11-4, 11-7, 11-0 but the second semi-final was stretched to five games with Razik edging past Cameron Pillay of Australia 11-8, 9-11, 11-8, 5-11, 11-8 in a 90-minute battle. 

The match tilted in Raziks favour in the decider when Pilley was leading 7-0 and looked comfortably poised to win. All of a sudden, the second seed started cramping and found it difficult to negotiate the powerful forehand of Razik. 

Razik lost serve just once at 4-7 and then didnt look back winning it 11-8. Earlier, Azlan had an easy outing as Khayal went down without any resistance. The first semi-final lasted only 24 minutes. 

The final will be held on Saturday.

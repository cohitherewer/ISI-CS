The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. held in Durand

New Delhi: Both Durand Cup quarter final league matches ended inconclusively on Thursday. Two late goals ensured Tata Football Academy (TFA) split points with fancied Sporting Clube de Goa while Assam Rifles needed a penalty to draw with Calcuttas Mohammedan Sporting. 

Sporting Clube had only themselves to blame for missing out on full three points. They could have even ended without any points as their custodian Luis Barreto saved a penalty by Naoba Singh. 

The Goan club went ahead in the sixth minute, through skipper Dudu. He was at it again, scoring off a Welton Gomes pass in the 59th minute. 

In the 81st minute, Vimal Pariyar ran through the Sporting defence before chipping over Barreto. Lalampuia got a spectacular equaliser with a minute to go. 

The other match was also a dramatic affair with Mohammedan Sporting feeling aggrieved with some of the decisions of referee Deepak Bisht. They were particularly angry about Liberian Okonji Patrick sent off for violent conduct in a challenge with Thaiba Singh and the denial of a penalty for a hand ball. 

The Calcutta outfit took the lead through Patrick who headed in a corner from Bijen Singh in the 16th minute. The Assam team restored parity when Ajit K. Singh converted a penalty in the 73rd. (PTI)

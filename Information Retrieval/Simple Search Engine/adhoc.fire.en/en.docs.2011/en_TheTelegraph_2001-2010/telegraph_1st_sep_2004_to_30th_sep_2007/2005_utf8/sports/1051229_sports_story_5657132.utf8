 Dhoni eager to face Shoaib

Ranchi: Flamboyant wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni may not have played Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar before, but is confident that he will be able to handle the Rawalpindi Express the way he has tackled some of the best fast bowlers in the world. 

I have not played against him, but I have played a couple of really good international fast bowlers ... I am looking forward to the Pakistan series where I will put in 100 per cent, Dhoni said on Wednesday. 

Dhoni hit 169 against Pakistan in a one-day International in Visakhapattanam, but Akhtar was missing from the touring party for that series. 

Asked whether he was working on any weakness to plug gaps in his technique, Dhoni said no cricketer was perfect, but was committed to constantly improve his game. 

Asked about his feelings watching Sachin Tendulkar bat at the other end, Dhoni said, It is a great feeling to play and watch Sachin from close quarters. He is such a great player that one can analyse cricket just watching him. 

When asked about Parthiv Patel, who is going to Pakistan as the second wicketkeeper, Dhoni said that he was in a positive frame of mind and wanted to perform well in the coming series and sustain it in the years to come. (PTI)

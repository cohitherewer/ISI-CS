 Beckham mocked

 - Spitting allegation 

Tokyo: English superstar David Beckham was mocked here Tuesday for accusing a Japanese player of spitting in his face as Real Madrid were humiliated before their Asian fans by a lowly J-League team. 

Beckham enraged! two Japanese tabloids blared in identical headlines with pictures of the English captain pointing an accusatory finger at Tokyo Verdy player Kazuyuki Toda. 

Beckham accused Tuesday of spitting at him during Mondays friendly match, in which the Spanish powerhouses were inflicted a shock 0-3 defeat at the hands of a team struggling in 17th position in the J-League. 

For real? Real Madrid, the Galacticos, humiliated in public in Japan, a daily said in a caption. Another daily said the entire Real Madrid squad lost their natural selves over the alleged spitting incident. The prince was infuriated, the it said. They wanted revenge rather than to win the game. They were totally different from the usual Galacticos, it said. 

Real Madrid coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo after the match accused Toda of trying to provoke Beckham, saying the Japanese player also kicked the English sensation. 

Toda denied the allegations ? and said it was Beckham who was to blame. Its he who kicked me, Toda said, as quoted by a tabloid. Some spit flew and I think thats why he was angry, but its not me. 

One daily said that Real Madrid were too weak and that their legions of fans here sighed for the full 90 minutes of the game. The prince... was in confusion over the unexpectedly tough game and decided to drop the bombshell allegations, it said.

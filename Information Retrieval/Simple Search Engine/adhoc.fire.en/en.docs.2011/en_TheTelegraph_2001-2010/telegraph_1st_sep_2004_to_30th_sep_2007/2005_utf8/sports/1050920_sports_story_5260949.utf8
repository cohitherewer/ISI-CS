The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Review in Mumbai on Sept. 27

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ranbir Singh Mahendra

Calcutta: The review of Team Indias performance thus far in the 2005-06 season will be held in Mumbai on September 27. 

While announcing the date and venue, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Ranbir Singh Mahendra couldnt confirm who all are going to feature in that review. 

All concerned will be there. At this moment, though, I cant be specific, Mahendra told The Telegraph soon after reaching the city on Monday night. 

That he (and his men) first need to get re-elected at the AGM, scheduled to be held here on Thursday-Friday, could be the reason why he didnt go into details. 

Earlier, Mahendra had announced that three former captains (Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri) would interact with coach Greg Chappell. 

Much, of course, has changed since that announcement and it wont be a bad idea if the BCCI mandarins had a separate one-on-one with at least all the senior Team India members. 

As of now, Sourav Ganguly and Co. should arrive in Mumbai (from Harare) on September 26. 

Besides the tour of Zimbabwe, the review is going to include the short visit to Sri Lanka as well.

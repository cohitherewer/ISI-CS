The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Team likely to remain unchanged 

 - IHF ELECTIONS

 Batra factor may cause the only flutter 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Gill is oozing the familiar confidence 

Calcutta: Elections belongs to the unparliamentary section of the language, as far as the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) goes. And democracy never really belonged to the real world of Indian hockey. 

Hence the activity in the city surrounding the elections, Monday, to a number of key posts suddenly gathers importance, simply because that word elections happens to be involved. So far, the posts that can logically be contested are for the president, the secretary general, eight vice-presidents, five joint secretaries and a treasurer, as well as eight executive committee members. 

Nobody is really talking of new office-bearers, but senior vice-president Narinder Batra (representing Jammu and Kashmir, as he has said) wishes to contest not only the presidents post (where supercop K.P. S. Gill is seeking re-election from Himachal Pradesh), but also the secretary generals post (where the incumbent is K. Jyothikumaran from Tamil Nadu). 

That hat in the ring (Batra reached the city rather late in the evening) isnt worth anything more than a token protest as of now, it seems. The scales are heavily tipped in favour of the Gill faction, if the overwhelming majority can be called that. With rumours of Union minister for civil aviation Praful Patels entering the fray being quickly shot down by the man himself, there remains only two points of interest. 

The first is democracy. 

Will the IHF have it, ever? Look, we are a democratic set-up, and will remain so, said Jyothikumaran to The Telegraph. I am sure the elections will be held democratically. I will not comment about the elections proper, because of this Delhi High Court order (though the court has allowed elections to be held, reacting to a petition, it has ordered that the results of the same cannot be disclosed), but I am confident that the right people will win. 

According to the federations constitution, nominations can be made on the floor (proposing and seconding) of the house. Withdrawals too. 

In case that sounds democratic enough, there is this other point of interest. The office-bearers numbers. 

Eight vice-presidents are allowed by the federations constitution. There are ten now ? not counting Gursewak Singh (of Patiala), who died last year, creating a vacancy ? and the court would not like that. Hence an in-faction election could see the numbers pruned. 

There are six joint secretaries. That number has to go down as well. The executive committee is unlikely to see a sea change. But since the various sub-committees are also to be constituted the same day, there would be a lot of appeasement procedures on. 

Elections seem likely only if such procedures fail. 

The annual general meeting of the federation is being hosted by the Bengal Hockey Association, and two Indian Olympic Association representatives ? BOA chief Ashoke Ghosh and Harish Sharma ? will oversee it, because the IHF happens to be under that apex bodys banner. 

The probes will be in the questions that could fly, embarrassing the head honchos. Batra asks for a limit of eight years (two terms) for office-bearers ? he is also miffed that bringing the elections forward by nearly 11 months reduces his own term by almost a year ? but the Union government isnt too worried about such undemocratic shackles. The IHF is in the clear on that. 

Then there is the issue of the appointment of German coach Gerhard Rach, following the sacking of Rajinder Singh. Both contentious. And the appointment of Rajinder Singh (jr) for just a month. 

Batra has also said that he has objections over the way the money is being spent, but unless he can prove things on the floor of the house, it will be thrown out in a jiffy. 

Gill, as usual, isnt talking, but he oozes the usual confidence, looking ahead to support from the 40-odd constituents (which includes Universities, Railways, Indian Airlines, and Services.) 

As a source put it: Unlikely any change in the team.

 How Indians are in frame

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former stars Mohinder Amarnath and Sandeep Patil are the only two Indians shortlisted by the BCCI for the coachs post. 

BCCI president and chairman of the committee to choose John Wrights successor, Ranbir Singh Mahendra, said neither Amarnath nor Patil had applied, but the Board decided to call them ?keeping in mind their past record as coach?. 

It was learnt that Roger Binny is also likely to be called for the interview. 

A few other former India players, who had completed coaching stints, were also considered during Sundays meeting. 

The candidates would be called for the interview, the date of which would be finalised after considering their availability.

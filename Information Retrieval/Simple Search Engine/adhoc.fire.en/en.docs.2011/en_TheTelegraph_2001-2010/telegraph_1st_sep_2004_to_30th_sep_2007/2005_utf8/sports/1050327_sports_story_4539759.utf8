 Atwal, Kapur tied ninth

Jakarta: Arjun Atwal and Shiv Kapur were tied ninth to keep the Indian challenge going even in the face of some terrible weather which forced an early stop on Day III of the Jakarta Standard Chartered Indonesia Open Saturday. 

Atwal was two-under for his 10 holes and Kapur was also two-under for his 11 holes of the third round. Gaurav Ghei, Harmeet Kahlon and Amandeep Johl made the cut while Rahil Gangjee missed it. 

Thailand?s Thaworn Wiratchant was hanging on to a one-stroke lead. (PTI)

Monte Carlo: Marat Safin breezed into the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters on Tuesday with a 6-0, 7-5 victory over South Korea?s Lee Hyung-taik. 

Third seed Tim Henman became the biggest casualty so far, losing to Argentine Mariano Zabaleta 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 in a match held over from Monday. 

Twice former champion Gustavo Kuerten lost 7-5, 6-2 to Croatian 13th seed Mario Ancic. 

Second seed Safin, who resides just down the road from the Country Club, was making his first appearance on clay this year and quickly got into his stride against a player ranked 59th in the world. 

The Russian needed just 21 minutes to take the first set and although the Korean offered more resistance in the second, Safin had far too much in his armoury, breaking serve just once to set up a second-round meeting with Frenchman Cyril Saulnier. 

?I was able to try a few things out, experiment a little,? said Australian Open champion Safin, who rates clay as his favourite surface. ?It?s a big transition coming from hard courts, the points are longer, but I was pretty happy with how it went today. I?m glad to be back on clay after losing a bit of confidence.? 

Henman, who reached the semi-final of the French Open last year, trailed 6-4, 2-1 to Zabaleta when play was suspended on Monday night because of rain. However, with conditions much more in his favour on Tuesday the Briton started strongly and levelled the match. 

The 30-year-old had chances to break serve early in the decider but failed to capitalise and he was made to pay as Zabaleta raised his level to clinch a fourth claycourt win against Henman. 

?You?ve got to be realistic,? said Henman. ?To make such an adjustment is difficult but after yesterday, when the conditions were really tough, I felt that my game was okay today. 

?He is very comfortable on this surface. I was just hoping to get through so that I could have another match on it.? 

Kuerten, a big favourite in Monte Carlo after his titles in 1999 and 2001, looked rusty in only his third match back on the circuit after six-months out following hip surgery. 

The triple French Open champion dropped serve at 5-6 in the first set, and then slipped a break behind early in the second as his challenge withered in one hour 32 minutes. He was able to take some positives from defeat. 

?I?m just happy to be back playing without pain,? the 28-year-old said. ?I?m probably only at about 65 percent but hopefully, by Roland Garros, my level will be nearer 80 percent which is more than I could have expected.? 

In other matches, eighth seed Ivan Ljubicic failed to get out of first gear on a cool morning as he was bundled out 6-2, 6-2 by Olivier Rochus of Belgium. 

Germany?s Florian Mayer booked a possible second-round meeting with former champion Carlos Moya after a 6-3, 6-3 defeat of French qualifier Julien Benneteau.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vijayan praise for Rodrigue

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: I.M. Vijayan doesnt want to see himself as East Bengals reply to Mohun Bagans new sensation Gley Yao Rodrigue. Because he feels that scoring goals for East Bengal will be his top priority, not any sort of competition with the Togolese World Cupper. 

He (Rodrigue) is a very good player. His striking ability is excellent. But I dont consider myself as a competitor against him, Vijayan, who scored a brace in East Bengals 4-0 win over Eastern Railway on Tuesday, said. 

The legend also refuses to set any target for him. Bus goal karna? this is my target, he pointed out, smilingly. 

Vijayan, however, admitted his both goals against Eastern Railway were gifted by the rival goalkeeper. I was surprised when he gifted the ball to me, he said of the first goal. He (Surabuddin) was close to me, but I was allowed to take the header unchallenged, he said of the second. 

He was, however, all praise for Alvito DCunhas goal ? a brilliantly-taken free-kick from the top box. It was a well-judged shot? a beautiful goal, he said. 

Meanwhile, Mike Okoro is likely to land here on Wednesday. It has been learnt that Okoro has already communicated with the AIFF and the club about his arrival this week. 

Coach Subhas Bhowmick is likely to leave on his foreign trip after the September 3 return-leg match versus Mohun Bagan. 

In another CFL Premier Division clash, Ever-Ready drew goalless with Calcutta Port Trust at the Kalyani Stadium.

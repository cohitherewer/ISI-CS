The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ghosh 3rd

Coimbatore: Rayomand Banajee, Ayub Khan and Ameya Walavalkar scored ?doubles? in their respective categories in the first leg of the eighth JK Tyre National Racing Championship, which kicked off at the Kari Motor Speedway here Sunday. 

Pole leader Banajee got a tremendous start from lead one in the first race in the FISSME category and his astonishing pace in the opening laps, with the fastest on third, saw him build a healthy cushion by lap six in the 15-lap race. 

Gaurav Dalal and Amittrajit Ghosh were in a keen contest for second place which was the highlight of the race with both trading places a couple of times. The former finished second. 

The minor spots were fought between Sunny Sidhu, Amman Ahluwalia and Karna Kadur.

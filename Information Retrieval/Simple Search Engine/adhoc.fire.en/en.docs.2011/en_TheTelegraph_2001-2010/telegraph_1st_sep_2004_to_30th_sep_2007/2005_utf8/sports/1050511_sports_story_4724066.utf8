 Warwickshire keeper banned 

London: The career of Warwickshire wicketkeeper Keith Piper is hanging by a thread after he was suspended for failing a drugs test. 

Warwickshire confirmed the suspension on Monday, which follows the news last week that he had tested positive during their championship match against Hampshire at Edgbaston last month. 

The 35-year-old Piper will appear before an ECB disciplinary panel after testing positive for a recreational drug. 

A statement from Warwickshire declared: ?The club is now in a position to confirm that the ECB has received formal notification from UK Sport that Keith Piper has provided a positive test sample for a banned substance. 

?The player will attend an ECB hearing on Thursday. The player has been suspended pending the outcome of the hearing? (AFP)

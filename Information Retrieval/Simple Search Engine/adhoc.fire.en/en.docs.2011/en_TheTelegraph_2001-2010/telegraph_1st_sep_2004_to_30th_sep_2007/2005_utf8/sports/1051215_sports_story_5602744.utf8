 Sourav exclusion sad: Yuvraj

OUR CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Sourav Ganguly-Yuvraj Singh story proved to be a classic tale of irony on Wednesday when one player had to keep his place in the team at the expense of other, who was his saviour not many days ago. 

Sourav ? after having been stripped of captaincy and a place in the ODI squad ? was in a battle with Yuvraj for the middle-order slot in Tests. But the selectors decided to favour the latter because of the age factor. 

When The Telegraph caught Yuvraj at the time of his checking out of the team hotel ? following a thumping 188-run win over Sri Lanka at the Kotla ? he said the former captains exclusion was a sad incident. 

Yes, it is sad. He is a senior player and a former captain. But I cant say more than this, please, the Punjab batsman, who will play at No. 6 batsman in the third Test, said. 

Sachin Tendulkar, however, was in no mood to entertain any query on Souravs sudden omission from the squad. We have won a Test match and its a hugely satisfying moment... lets concentrate on it, he said, before leaving for Mumbai.

 ICC warns India again

New Delhi: The ICC on Wednesday warned India to sort out the tax exemption issue immediately if the country does not want to lose the chance of hosting next year?s Champions Trophy. 

ICC president Ehsan Mani, who had discussed the issue with Union finance P. Chidambaram and sports minister Sunil Dutt during his visit to Delhi last month, said there had been no response from the Indian government yet. 

The ICC wants the Indian government to waive tax on income from the Champions Trophy. 

?ICC gets tax exemption for every event it holds in any part of the world. If we don?t get the tax clarification in the next few days, we may have to take a decision on whether to stage the tournament in India within a week,? Mani said on the eve of ICC?s two-day executive board meeting here. 

The ICC will consider a report on recent developments in Kenyan cricket ? the government?s decision to derecognise the Kenyan Cricket Association (KCA), the creation of Cricket Kenya, the legal issues that have arisen as a result of these moves and the decision to withhold ICC funding to the KCA pending the resolution of these issues.

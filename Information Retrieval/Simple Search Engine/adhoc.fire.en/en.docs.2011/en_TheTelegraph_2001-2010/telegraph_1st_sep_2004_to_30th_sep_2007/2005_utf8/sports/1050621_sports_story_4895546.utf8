 Narain happy with points

Indianapolis: Narain Karthikeyan missed a life-time opportunity of a podium finish in the United States Grand Prix, but he did not rue it, saying he was happy to score his first championship points for Jordan. 

Karthikeyan finished fourth among six drivers as seven teams, using Michelin tyres, pulled out of the Grand Prix at the last moment over tyre concerns. Only Ferrari, Minardi and Jordan, all of whom use Bridgetone, contested the race (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

Scoring points under the strangest circumstances ever seen in Grand Prix history still feels great, the 28-year-old Jordan driver said. 

These are my first championship points in Formula One and it does not really matter how they come. Points are points. This is the first time an Indian driver has scored points in Formula One. So I am happy, he said. 

Karthikeyan said even if the field was depleted it was important to finish the 73-lap race and he was pleased that his car was reliable this weekend. 

The Indian rookie, who earned five valuable points for his team, had his best ever classification of the year on Sunday even as his Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro of Portugal finished third, taking the team tally to 11 world championship points. 

Karthikeyan said he was very happy for Monteiros first podium finish and that the results were beyond his expectations. It had lifted his teams spirits, he said.

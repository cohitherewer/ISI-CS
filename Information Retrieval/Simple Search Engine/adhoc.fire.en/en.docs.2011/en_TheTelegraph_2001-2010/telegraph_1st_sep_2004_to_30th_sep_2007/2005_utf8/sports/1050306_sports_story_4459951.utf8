 Jyoti keeps hopes alive

Dubai: A determined and adventurous comeback on the back nine by Jyoti Randhawa kept alive his hopes of a good finish inside top-20 at this prestigious European tour tournament in the $2.2 million Dubai Desert Classic meet. 

Randhawa, the lone Indian ranger after the exit of Arjun Atwal at the midway stage of the tournament, began with a birdie on the second, but the lapse between the fourth and eighth holes, as he dropped three shots in that period, proved dear. 

Then he made four birdies between 10th and 16th and finally ended at five-under for three days and in tied 32nd. 

?I just missed too many par putts,? said Randhawa. 

Miguel Angel Jimenez continued his vigil on top of the leaderboard, but his overnight lead was cut down from two to one, as Ernie Els played amazingly after four-putting from 15 feet for a double bogey on the opening hole, and ending the day a five-under 67 to be at 15-under 201. 

Randhawa finished his front nine at two-over for the day, but then turned in some aggressive play on the back journey. He birdied the par-5 tenth and then missed one on the 11th. (PTI)

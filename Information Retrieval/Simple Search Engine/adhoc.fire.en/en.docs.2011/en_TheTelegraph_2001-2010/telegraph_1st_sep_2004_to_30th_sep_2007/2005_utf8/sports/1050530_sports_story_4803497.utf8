 Johl finishes tied 15th 

Seoul: Amandeep Johl finished tied 15th as he ended with a three-over round of 75 on the final day of the $500,000 Maekyung Open at the Nam Seoul Country Club here Sunday. 

Johl was tied fifth and looked set for a good finish but his putter failed him on the last day. Korean veteran Choi Sang-Ho thwarted a brave bid by Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand to lift title by three strokes. 

Overnight leader Choi completed his sensational wire-to-wire triumph with a final round of two-under-par 70, which gave him a four-day winning aggregate of 10-under-par 278. 

Johl opened the day at three-under for three rounds. He shot bogeys on the second and fourth and never recovered. He made up a little with a birdie on the seventh, and then again bogeyed the 11th, 13th and 14th holes. A birdie on the 16th was not enough to undo all the damage as he finished with 75, his worst during the week.

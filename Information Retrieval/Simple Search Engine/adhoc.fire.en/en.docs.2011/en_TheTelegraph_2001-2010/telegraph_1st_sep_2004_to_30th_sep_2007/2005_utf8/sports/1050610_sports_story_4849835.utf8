 Zagreb: Former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic complained that the investments he has made in construction business in his homeland Croatia financially ruined him.

 ?Unfortunately, my investments sunk like the Titanic,? Ivanisevic told a weekly on Wednesday. ?From the beginning everything went wrong. Every single investment that I have made in Croatia has failed.? However, Ivanisevic, who earned $19.8 million in carrier prize money emphasised that thanks to tournaments that he is still playing he would not go bankrupt. 

 Chennai: Three players emerged in joint lead in the boys? section of the Indian Bank VEL?s national under-9 chess championship after the sixth round here on Thursday, even as Bengal?s Sayantan Das (4.5) was beaten by Karnataka?s Girish A Koushik (5.5).

 Girish was among the leaders, the others being S. Koushik (Tamil Nadu) and G. V. Sai Krishna (Andhra Pradesh). Shiven Kolsa, Y. V. K. Chakraborthy (both Andhra) are behind the leaders with 5 points each.

 A.R. Priya of Andhra with six points emerged as the sole leader in the girls? section. K. Deepika (Andhra), Uma Bharathy (Tamil Nadu) and Sweety Patil (Gujarat) are following her on five points each. 

 London: Briton Darren Clarke has pulled out of next week?s US Open to spend time with his wife Heather who has cancer. ?It is more important for me to be here with my family,? the world No. 15 said in a statement on Thursday. ?Hopefully, Heather will be out of hospital soon and I will be able to return to the game, but there are more important issues to be dealt with at the moment than swinging a golf club.?

 The 36-year-old Northern Irishman has not missed a major championship since 1998. The US Open will be held at Pinehurst in North Carolina from June 16-19.

 Rome: Hundreds of fans gathered at Capodichino airport in Naples on Thursday to welcome back Diego Maradona, 14 years after he last set foot in the city. The 44-year-old former World Cup winner was returning to the scene of some of his greatest triumphs to appear at a farewell match in honour of former Napoli teammate Ciro Ferrara. The match pits a selection of his former Napoli teammates against past and present Juventus players.

 Rome: Italian Pierluigi Collina, widely regarded as the best referee in the world, will take charge of his last match in the second leg of the Serie A relegation play-off between Bologna and Parma on June 18. Italian referees must retire at the age of 45 and Collina, who reached that age in February, has not received the necessary exemption fto continue next season. 

 Jerusalem: Two former Israeli referees have been jailed for a year after a Tel Aviv judge reversed an earlier decision to reduce their sentences to community service.

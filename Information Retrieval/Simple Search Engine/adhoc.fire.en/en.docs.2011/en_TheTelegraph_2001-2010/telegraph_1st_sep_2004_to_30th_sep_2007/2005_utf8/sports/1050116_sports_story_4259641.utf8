The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tolly hold Sporting 3-3

 - NATIONAL LEAGUE 

 - Musah, Akeem score in injury time 

 Brilliant Suley Musah led Tollygunge fightback 

Margao: Tollygunge Agragami came from behind to hold Sporting Clube de Goa 3-3 in the ninth National Football League (NFL) match at Nehru Stadium here on Saturday. 

Sporting led 1-0 at half-time through Wilton Gomes? goal in the 22nd minute. Edeh Chidi (52nd) and Rajesh Meetei (78th) scored the other two goals. 

But Tollygunge fought their way in the second half and scored through Surajit Bose (63rd), Suley Musah and Akeem Abalonle in injury time to level the scores. 

Sporting Clube went into the offensive from the start with Dudu and Edeh Chidi combining well upfront. They made repeated forays into the rival half but were thwarted by the Tollygunge defenders. 

Kabijit Khotel, Deb Kumar Shasmal and Isiaka defended well till the 22nd minute when Dudu made his way from the right flank and centered a low cross for Wilton Gomes inside the box to do the rest. 

Sporting had a chance to increase the lead in injury time of the first half but Dudu?s header off a Joseph corner missed the mark narrowly. 

Tollygunge, who made occasional forays into the rival half, had their chances too but Akeem and Surajit were erratic with their shooting. 

Sporting increased the lead in the 52nd minute through Chidi off an Adabayo pass. 

Tollygunge came off with counter moves and reduced the margin through Surajit off a Musah pass. 

Sporting again piled up the pressure and scored through Meetei off Wilton Gomes? pass. 

Sporting, who were sitting pretty on their two-goal lead, however, took things lightly as Tollygunge took advantage to score goals in injury time through Musah and Akeem to draw parity. (PTI)

 Hayden vows to be ruthless

 - ASHES SERIES 

 - Im hungry to score runs 

 Hayden says hes looking forward to tackle the seaming ball in England 

Brisbane: When Matthew Hayden concedes he hasnt scored a Test hundred in England, what he really means is that hes yet to score one. 

The burly Australian opener, one of the leading batsmen of his generation, isnt guaranteeing hell post an Ashes century in England when the five-Test series starts at Lords on July 21. But hes promising hell be ruthless. 

And when hes ruthless, he scores runs. Lots of runs. 

Hayden said he made the mistake of placing too much emphasis on his Ashes campaign in 2001 because of the traditionally high stakes of the series and because he hadnt established himself in the Australian line-up. 

Im going to take a lot of that out this time. Im not making it emotional ? I just want to be ruthless, he said in an interview from Australias training camp in Brisbane. 

Im not going to attach any extra importance to (the Ashes) and Im not going to build it up too much, he added. His 234 runs at an average of 34 in Australias 4-1 series win was a relative flat spot in a year when he posted 1,391 in 14 Test matches. 

I dont know really why ? without looking too far back ? I felt different, like I was really fighting for my spot the whole time, he said. I was looking forward to playing against them here (the next Ashes series) so I could perform like I knew I could against them. 

It was really satisfying to perform against them out here, so the challenge is to keep performing against them on their turf as well. 

I was oblivious to any statistics. And Im at that same point again ? (statistics) dont concern me. One thing that was consistent was just straight-out hunger to score runs. Im hungry to score runs. Game on! 

Hayden, who has played county cricket in England for Hampshire and Nottinghamshire, said the conditions in England made it difficult but rewarding for opening batsmen. 

Its a great challenge for an opening batsman. The ball does seam and swing. Its something that JL (fellow opener Justin Langer) and I are really looking forward to doing together. (AP)

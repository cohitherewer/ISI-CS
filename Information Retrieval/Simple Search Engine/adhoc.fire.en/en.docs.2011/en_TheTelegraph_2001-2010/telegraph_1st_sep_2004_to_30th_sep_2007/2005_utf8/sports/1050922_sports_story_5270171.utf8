 Australia beat India to draw level

Mohali: Riding on a century opening stand, Australia levelled the five-match series 1-1, defeating India by six wickets in the second one-dayer played here on Wednesday. 

Chasing a modest target of 231, the Australian under-19 opening pair of Graeme Skennar and Tom Cooper stitched a 118-run stand for the first wicket. 

While Skennar scored a quickfire 64 of just 45 balls, studded with seven fours and four sixes, Coopers 62 was a more patient effort but still included eight fours and two sixes. 

Barring their captain Aaron Finch, who fell cheaply (4), David Warner (34 ..) and Moises Henriques (42) maintained a cool head to achieve the target on an excellent batting strip at Mohali. 

The Indians even failed to play out their overs, getting dismissed in 48.3 overs. Jackson Bird was the most successful bowler, taking three wickets.

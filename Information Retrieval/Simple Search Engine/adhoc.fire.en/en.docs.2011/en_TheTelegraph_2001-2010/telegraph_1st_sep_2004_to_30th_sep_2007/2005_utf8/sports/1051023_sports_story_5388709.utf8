 3rd umpire to be introduced

New Delhi: Two new concepts ? introduction of the third umpire system and best of three finals ? will add flavour to the next edition of the Premier Hockey League (PHL) scheduled to be held at Chandigarh. 

The other attraction of the event to be held from January 5 to February 1 will be the participation of more foreign players apart from a new team, Rourkela Steelers, in the Tier II of the league. 

The new team Rourkela Steelers have been introduced keeping in mind the huge following of the sport in Orissa and Jharkhand 

As many as 50 foreign players will take part in the PHL. But it has not been decided that how many players from which countries will be invited, IHF president K. P. S. Gill said at a press conference here on Saturday. 

We have decided to rest Bengal Tigers after a lacklustre performance last year. Rourkela Steelers will take their place in Tier II, the IHF supremo said.

 One must grow with the game: Hingis

Melbourne: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis has conceded she has no hope of surviving on the womens circuit unless she improves her serve and increases her all-round power. 

Swiss Hingis, 25, who retired three years ago with foot and ankle injuries, announced her comeback to tennis this month. 

If I want to play the tennis I played three years ago I would not survive, Hingis told newsmen in Gold Coast on Friday. I know that. You have to grow with the game and you have to get better physically and tennis wise. 

Ive been trying to work on my whole game, baseline and serve. You have to have a serve to be able to survive today and well see if I can bring it on, like the saying says. 

Hingis will be making her Grand Slam return at next months Australian Open after playing warm-up tournmaments in Gold Coast next week and in Sydney the week after. The five-time Grand Slam champion said she had no goals other than to compete at the elite level although she added she would not have made a comeback if she did not think she could win more Grand Slam titles. 

You have to believe that down deep, otherwise I wouldnt come back. I dont want to set myself into a kind of frame where I would be disappointed or reach over the top, she said. 

Hingis said she was inspired to come back for a variety of reasons, including watching Lindsay Davenports rise to world No. 1 and the revival of Mary Pierce, who made the finals of the French and US Open this year. 

Ive had a very nice quiet life back home without the stress and travel but I missed playing. I missed the game, she said. (Reuters)

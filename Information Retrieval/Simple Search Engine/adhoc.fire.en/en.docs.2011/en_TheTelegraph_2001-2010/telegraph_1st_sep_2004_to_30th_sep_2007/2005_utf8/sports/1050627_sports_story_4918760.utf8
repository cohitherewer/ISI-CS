 Argentina make it

Hanover: Argentina made the Confederations Cup final beating Mexico 7-6 (1-1) after a sudden death penalty shootout on Sunday evening. 

The scheduled 90 minutes of the second semi-final produced two red cards ? Argentine Javier Saviola was sent off in the last minute and Mexicoan Rafael Marquez in stoppage time ? and no goals. 

Mexico broke the deadlock just before the end of first half extra-time, through Carlos Salcido. The equaliser came through Luciano Figueroa, after 110 minutes. 

Much before the drama unfolded in Hanover, the spotlight had shifted to security in Germany. A Spanish man tackled by security in front of Germanys goal on Saturday was the fourth spectator to slip past authorities and dash onto the pitch during the tournament over the last two weeks. 

Putting an unwelcome spotlight on security gaps inside the stadiums one year before Germany hosts the World Cup, the man wearing a shirt bearing advertising for an online casino sprinted in from the side and got to the penalty spot before being brought down hard. 

Its annoying and a nuisance, said Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann. Its an issue the organising committee has to deal with. Something like that naturally has to be stopped. 

The 27-year-old Spaniard, whose knee was injured when he was tackled by security, was released after posting bail of 400 euros, according to German media. 

He was reportedly paid by a nightclub owner in Barcelona for his action that brought the match to a halt in the seventh minute with the score at 0-0. Brazil ended up winning 3-2. 

The man, who continued to struggle with security as he was dragged into detention beneath the stadium amid a chorus of boos from the crowd, faces a lifetime ban in German stadiums. Prosecutors plan to charge him with disturbing the peace. 

But German authorities said there was no scope for a more draconian punishment or lawsuit that could serve as deterrent. 

There is no legal justification in Germany for that, said Gerd Graus, a spokesman for Germanys 2006 organising committee. 

While no players were injured during the four incidents of spectators running onto the pitch ? most of which were prompted by wagers ? Graus said the organising committee will redouble efforts to prevent lapses in security inside stadiums. 

The stewards will be specially trained for these situations, he said. 

Germany has seen far more sinister attacks in the past. In 1993, an obsessed fan of German tennis champion Steffi Graf stabbed Monica Seles, her only rival as the best womens player in the world, in the back during a break in a match in Hamburg. 

The attack sidelined Seles, who had won 32 singles titles in four years, for two years and derailed her career.

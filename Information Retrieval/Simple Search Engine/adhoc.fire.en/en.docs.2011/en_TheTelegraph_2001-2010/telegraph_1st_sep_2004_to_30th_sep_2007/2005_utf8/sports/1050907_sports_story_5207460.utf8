New York: Jarkko Nieminen became the first player from Finland to reach the singles quarter finals of a Grand Slam by beating Fernando Verdasco of Spain 6-2, 7-6, 6-3 in the fourth round of the US Open on Tuesday. 

Nieminen stretched out on his back to savour the moment after Verdasco sent a forehand wide to end the battle between the two left-handers. 

Nieminen, who benefited from the injury withdrawal of fifth-seeded Russian Marat Safin, his likely second-round opponent, took advantage of Verdascos erratic play ? the Spaniard committed 66 unforced errors to only 14 by the Finn. 

In Monday night session action, Mary Pierce avenged the most painful defeat of her career when she surprised Belgian seventh seed Justine Henin-Hardenne 6-3, 6-4 to enter the quarter finals. 

Three months ago the 30-year-old Frenchwoman sobbed uncontrollably after collapsing 6-1, 6-1 to the Belgian in the French Open final but on Monday a wide grin replaced the tears under the glistening lights on Arthur Ashe Court. 

Plagued by double-faults, 2003 champion Henin-Hardenne looked a shadow of her usual self and Pierce controlled her fragile temperament sufficiently to set up an all-French quarter final with third seed Amelie Mauresmo.

Resilience was the by-word on Labour Day at Flushing Meadow. US seventh seed Andre Agassi and number eight Guillermo Coria of Argentina came through five-setters (as reported in Tuesdays late City edition). Wild card James Blake recovered from a set and 5-2 down to win. 

Pierces nerve has failed her so often in the past but never as badly as in Paris, when she apologised to the crowd for her abject display. 

On Monday, though, she ripped into a 5-0 lead with some clubbed forehands and despite some customary wobbles towards the end, drew the decisive error out of the under-par Belgian on her fourth match point. 

It was her first win in five meetings with 23-year-old Henin-Hardenne and she said: I just gave everything I had tonight, I fought and I didnt give up. 

US seventh seed Agassi delved into his 20 years of experience at Flushing Meadow and plucked out a 6-3, 6-4, 6-7, 4-6, 6-2 victory over belligerent Belgian Xavier Malisse. 

It was hard work for the 35-year-old twice former champion who reached the quarter finals for the fifth straight year. 

In the last eight he will face compatriot Blake, who recovered superbly to upset Spanish 19th seed Tommy Robredo 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3. 

Guillermo Coria also showed great resilience to win a bad-tempered five-set encounter with Nicolas Massu of Chile. The two were involved in heated verbal exchanges before the Argentine prevailed 6-4, 2-6, 6-7, 6-2 6-2 in over four and a half hours to reach the quarter finals. 

Olympic champion Massu was infuriated after Coria requested treatment for damaged toe-nails. Coria later described the incident as a misunderstanding. 

In contrast to the men, womens second and third seeds, Lindsay Davenport and Mauresmo, enjoyed a holiday stroll into the quarter finals. Davenport thrashed Nathalie Dechy of France 6-0 6-3. 

In the quarter finals Davenport faces Elena Dementieva who beat Patty Schnyder 6-4, 6-3. Mauresmo was a 6-1, 6-4 winner over Russian 19th seed Elena Likhovtseva. (Reuters)

 In pursuit of high-flying Federer

Melbourne: Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt knew they needed to do something drastic to close the gap between Roger Federer and rest of men?s tennis. 

Agassi tuned his 34-year-old body like never before, looking to gain whatever edge he could when he next meets the top-ranked Swiss. Agassi, however, hurt his hip during a tune-up match against Roddick and it?s unclear if he will play when the Australian open begins Monday at Melbourne Park. 

Roddick, ranked No.2, switched coaches. He ended an 18-month association with Brad Gilbert that had produced his first major title, joining former US Davis cup coach Dean Goldfine and overhauling his practice regimen. 

Hewitt, ranked No.3, bulked up his upper body, hoping it might help him end a six-match losing streak to Federer that included the finals of the US Open and season-ending Masters Cup. 

?Roger has taken the game to a new level,? said Hewitt, the former US Open and Wimbledon champion who at one time led Federer 6-1 in head-to-head meetings. 

Federer won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open among his 11 titles in 2004, becoming the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988 to capture three of the four majors in one season. 

Adding another title in Qatar ? his 23rd ? he improved his winning streak in tour finals to 14 and stretched his winning run to 21 consecutive matches. 

?To finish No. 1 and the way he did it is an incredible effort, but it?s also become the standard that everybody is trying to push for,? said Agassi, an eight-time major champion. 

The Swiss is flattered by the attention, but he?s not letting it distract him from his goal for 2005 ? start with an Australian Open title and finish with the No. 1 ranking. ?In a way, I enjoy it, to get so many compliments,? Federer said. ?I had such a great season last year ? I guess like nobody had in 15 or 20 years ? so it?s normal that everybody compares me to the all-time greats. Now it?s up to me to be up there for a long time.? 

To remain on top, Federer decided he also needed to change. He worked with a coach for the first time in a year, spending two weeks with Tony Roche. He thinks a few tweaks already have improved his game. 

That?s probably not what Agassi and company wanted to hear. After shedding 4 1/2 kilos to drop into the mid-70s and building his strength and conditioning, Agassi was primed for a shot at a fifth Australian title. Now he?s at risk of having to join an injured list that includes Mark Philippoussis and three of the top 10 women. (AP)

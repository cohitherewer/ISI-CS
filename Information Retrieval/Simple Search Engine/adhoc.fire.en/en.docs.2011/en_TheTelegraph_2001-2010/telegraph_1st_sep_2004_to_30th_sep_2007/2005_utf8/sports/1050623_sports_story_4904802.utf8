Nottingham: Paul Collingwood became the first man in one-day Internationals to score a century and take six wickets as England beat Bangladesh by 168 runs in Tuesdays eventful tri-series match. 

The batting allrounder made 112 not out to Andrew Strauss 152 as the home side just missed out on a world record total, making 391 for four after winning the toss. 

Collingwood, bowling slow-medium, then took six for 31. Bangladesh, who had upset Australia at the weekend, were dismissed for 223 in 45.2. overs. 

Debutant Chris Tremlett took four for 32. Mohammad Ashraful, just 20 years old and who made a century against the world champions, walloped a 52-ball 94 in a losing cause. 

The world record innings total for an ODI is held by Sri Lanka, who made 398 for five against Kenya at Kandy in the 1996 World Cup. 

The game offered rich entertainment to the Trent Bridge crowd, including some scintillating batting and one extraordinary hattrick that never was from Tremlett. 

Marcus Trescothick set the tone with a blazing 85 off 65 balls out of a 141-run opening stand with Strauss. 

The English total looked impossible but Ashraful certainly entertained after a huge let-off first ball. 

Tremlett, six-foot-seven and bowling fast-medium, bowled Shahriar Nafees off an inside edge for 10 and had Tushar Imran caught-behind next ball to make it 30 for two. 

Ashraful played the hattrick ball into the ground and it bounced back on top of the bails without dislodging them. (Reuters)

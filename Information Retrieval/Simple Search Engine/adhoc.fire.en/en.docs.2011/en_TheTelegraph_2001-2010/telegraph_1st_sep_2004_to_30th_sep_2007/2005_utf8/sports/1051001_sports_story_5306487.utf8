 Wait for Sachin to end in Mohali

 - It is almost certain that Sourav, too, will play 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar will play in the N. K. P. Salve Challenger Series in Mohali, following the green signal from Team India physio John Gloster. 

Tendulkar is playing in the Challenger Series. I also spoke to John Gloster who has said he can play, said national senior selection committee chairman Kiran More from Vadodara. 

Though the Challenger clashes with the captains conclave in Sydney, it is almost certain that Sourav Ganguly will go to Mohali instead of Sydney. 

The three teams for the meet will be chosen on Saturday in Delhi. 

The BCCIs international panel umpire I. Shivram of Hyderabad, alongwith Madan R. Singh of Mumbai and T. K. Handu of Maharashtra have been chosen to officiate in the tournament. 

Meanwhile, the BCCI will put in place a fresh set of players contracts by November and work on the modalities will begin soon. 

Like last year BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra will form a committee which will have in it the selection committee chairman and coach Greg Chappell. There would be discussions with some senior players too, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said. The contracts would be put in place in November like last year.

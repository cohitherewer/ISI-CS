 Paes-Zimonjic out in Round I

New Delhi: Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic bowed out in the first round of the Paris Masters, losing a hard-fought encounter against the Israeli pair of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram. 

According to information received here, Paes and Zimonjic went down 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 2-6. The defeat didnt hurt the Indo-Serbian pair much as the two have already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai later this month. 

Only the top eight teams in the ATP Doubles Race make the cut for this prestigious event.

 Shivraj shifted to Mumbai

Jaipur: Ace polo player Shivraj Singh, who remained in coma after suffering a serious head injury during a match last week, was airlifted to Mumbai on Monday. 

The 27-year-old, the only son of the erstwhile royal family of Jodhpur, was shifted this morning for treatment in the Tata Hospital in Mumbai in a special aircraft, hospital sources said. 

A team of doctors from Mumbai also accompanied the ailing player in the flight. 

Shivraj fell from his horse while playing in the Birla Cup in the Ram Bagh polo ground here last Friday. (PTI)

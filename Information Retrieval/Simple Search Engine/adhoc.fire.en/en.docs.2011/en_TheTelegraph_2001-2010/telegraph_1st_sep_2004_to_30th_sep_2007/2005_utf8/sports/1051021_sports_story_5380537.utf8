 Bracken: I was merely joking

Sydney: Australian paceman Nathan Bracken apologised on Thursday for insinuating that England bowlers doctored the ball to clinch the Ashes series. 

Bracken, a fringe Test player who took no part in the Ashes series, clarified that he was joking when he suggested English bowlers polished the ball with breath-freshening mints to achieve the reverse swing that bamboozled Australian batsmen. 

The New South Wales bowler offered his apologies to Simon Jones, who was quoted in British papers angrily denouncing the sweet-cheating claim as sour grapes. 

I thought it would come across as a joke and its come across the wrong way, Bracken told reporters. 

Ive sent my apologies to Simon and Im making an effort to contact him and sort things out so that everythings perfectly fine and I can make sure that no offence is taken. 

Bracken said he had never seen English bowlers doctor the ball with mints, backing down from his comments on Wednesday that the practice was commonplace when he played for Gloucester in 2003. 

When I was playing at Gloucester a couple of years ago, as soon as we needed the ball to go Irish the captain would call and they would bring out some of these mints and it would work, he had told a radio station. (AFP)

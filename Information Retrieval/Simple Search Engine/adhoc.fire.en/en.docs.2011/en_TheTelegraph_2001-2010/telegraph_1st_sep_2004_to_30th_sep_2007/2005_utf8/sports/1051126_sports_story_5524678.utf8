 Cristiano wont face charges

London: Scotland Yard has said that Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo will not face rape charges due to insufficient evidence. 

The 20-year-old Portugal international was arrested on October 19 on allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in a penthouse suite at the Sanderson Hotel in central London on October 2. 

We have been informed today by the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) that there is insufficient evidence to charge, a Scotland Yard spokesman said on Thursday. As such, the two men arrested during the course of this investigation will face no further action by police in connection with this matter.

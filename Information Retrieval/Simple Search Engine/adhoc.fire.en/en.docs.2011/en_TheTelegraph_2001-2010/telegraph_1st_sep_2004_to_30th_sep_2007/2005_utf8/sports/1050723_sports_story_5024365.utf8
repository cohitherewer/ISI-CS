 Arjun Atwal tied 37th 

Milwaukee: Arjun Atwal played a one-under 69 on the first day of the Milwaukee Championship on the US PGA Tour on Thursday. 

Atwal was tied 37th, even as 93 of the 156 golfers had not completed their rounds because of thunderstorms, and many of them had not even begun on the par-70 course that is one of the shortest on the Tour. 

Atwal started from the tenth and had birdies on the 11th, 14th and 18th, but also back-to-back bogeys on 16th and 17th. On his second nine, he dropped a shot on the fourth to be even par for the day before picking up a birdie on the sixth to finish the day at one-under.

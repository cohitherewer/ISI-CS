Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami are eyeing full points from their match against Fransa Sports Club in the fifth round of the National Football League for the ONGC Cup. 

Tollygunge have five points, courtesy a win, two draws and a loss, while newly promoted Fransa are on seven. 

?We need three points,? Tollygunge coach Biswajit Das said on Monday. ?We defeated Fransa 3-1 in the Federation Cup, but this is another match. However, we are not thinking of anything but a win.? 

The coach is a bit worried on the injury front. Key players like Akeem Abolanle and Gouranga Dutta are doubtful starters, while Surajit Bose too has a problem. 

For the Goan outfit, this is their first away outing in the league and goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey is keeping his fingers crossed. ?Our?s is a new team and the boys are mostly juniors. We have played the last four matches at home. So we?ll have to be a bit cautious. 

?We can?t take Tollygunge lightly,? he said.

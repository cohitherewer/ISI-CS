 IN THE CITY

 His departure to the US having been delayed due to a visa problem, Rupesh Roy is taking the opportunity to earn some points by playing in the ONGC-ITF junior meet beginning at the DKS on Monday. Since he hadn?t originally entered the meet, Rupesh needed a wild card to get into the main draw. And thanks to his ranking of 51 in the ITF juniors? list, he will be top seed in boys? singles. Junior Davis Cup teammates Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan (No. 73) and Sanam K. Singh (87) will be the second and third seeds, respectively. In the girls? event, Sandhya Nagaraj (122) will get pride of place, followed by German Dominice Ripoll (176) and Chinese Li He Wen Fei (205).

 The Bengal versus Orissa C.K. Nayudu Trophy (under-22) match petered out into a predictable draw but the hosts earned two points courtesy their 39-run first-innings lead. Rakesh Mohanty?s century wasn?t enough to take Orissa past Bengal?s first-innings tally of 296. 

 Brief scores

 Bengal 296 and 158/4 (Subhajit Banerjee 49). Orissa 257 (Rakesh Mohanty 114). Match drawn. Bengal 2 pts.

 Shanker Roy drew his final-round game with Laltu Chatterjee to emerge champion in the 5th WBCA Fide-rating meet on Friday tallying nine points. D.P. Singh and Rahul Sangma also finished with nine, but Shanker triumphed because of better progressive score. Singh, who beat D. Ravishankar, finished second.

 The champion received a cheque for Rs 30,000 and the runner-up Rs 18,000.

 Sanskara set to strike 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Barring Sanskara, in Fridays feature event, the 1,400m Harry The Horse Cup, there is hardly anything to look forward to. The Dont Forget Me-Shisheido daughter has not done anything wrong since winning the Nanoli Stud Million and she is trainer Bharath Singhs major hope for the monsoon and the winter Classics.

 The rest of the card looks to be a teaser. It is because Regal Empress, also a Classic aspirant, may need the outing and the same could be said about the debutant Alcinia ? in their respective events, the Replicate Handicap and the Aladancer Plate, both 1,200m sprints.

 Exotic Strides and Regal Successor, on the other hand, are hardly reliable customers. It may not come as a surprise if they start as favourites, in their respective events, and also bring about disappointments.

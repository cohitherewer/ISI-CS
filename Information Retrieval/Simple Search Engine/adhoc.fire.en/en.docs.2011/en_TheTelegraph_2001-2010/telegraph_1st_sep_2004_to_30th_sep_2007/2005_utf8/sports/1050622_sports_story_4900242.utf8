 England score 391 for four

Nottingham: Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood hit centuries as England just missed out on the world ODI record by scoring 391 for four in their tri-series match against Bangladesh Tuesday. 

Strauss finished on 152 from 128 balls while Collingwood made 112 not out from 86 at Trent Bridge. The world record innings total is held by Sri Lanka, 398 for five against Kenya in the 1996 World Cup.

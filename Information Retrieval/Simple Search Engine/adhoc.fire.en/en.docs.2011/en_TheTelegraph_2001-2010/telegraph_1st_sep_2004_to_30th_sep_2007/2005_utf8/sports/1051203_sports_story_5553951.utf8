Calcutta: Despite playing with 10 men for 53 minutes, Mohammedan Sporting put up a valiant show to restrict the European giants Bayern Munich to draw the first blood till the 82 nd minute. But in a change of script in last 10 minutes, the Calcutta outfit conceded two goals to make exit from the 111 th IFA Shield Tournament at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. 

Bayern, who were playing their opening match of the meet (in semi-final), scored through Stephan Furstner (82 nd minute) and Michael Gorlitz (89 th minute) to set up a title clash with Ever-Ready Association at the same venue on Sunday. 

The black-and-whites tried their hearts out, but the Bayern defence thwarted every move created one after other. They remained unsuccessful till the 82 nd minute owing to poor striking ability. 

It was Matthius Zimmermann, the key player in the first session, who created lot of chances for his forwards, but all were squandered from close quarters. The Mohammedan Sporting goalie Gopal Das though had a good day under the bar saving at least three goals for his side. 

The first such effort denied the visitors from taking the lead in the eighth minute, when a Stefan Maierhofer header was fisted out brilliantly by diving Gopal, which ultimately crossed the touchline after a slight deflection from the post. 

The Bayern side managed lot of flag-kicks and free-kicks yielding no result, especially because of Nigerian Suley Musah and Bijoy Basfore, who took charge in the defence. Another foreign recruit, Okonji Patrick also made forays several times into the rival defence but lack of support from teammates up front poured water in his huge enthusiasm. 

Fabian Muller was another in the Bayern rank, who kept the black-and-white shirts by his deceptive speed and thrust. Both the teams went into the lemon break with blank scoresheet. That was, indeed, a lot of worry for the fancied side, who started looking different after the change of sides. 

Most of the attacks were hurled down the right where Rhem Phillip was operating nicely and making it uncomfortable for Basfore and Wajid Ali. Hosts receive the real jolt when defender Palash Karmakar was given the marching orders (after he got the second yellow card of the match). 

The complexion changed a lot after the introduction of Stephan Furstner up front for the German club. Furstners fresh pair of legs made it difficult for the Mohammedan Sporting players to fight with one-man down. 

Once in the 77 th minute, Patrick, getting a ball from Suman Dutta almost scored, but his (Patricks) firm right footer was no way near the target. 

Then it was all-Bayern show. Eight minutes from time, Furstners curling right footer went home giving Gopal absolutely no chance to move from his position. A minute from the long whistle, another substitute Gortlitz sealed the fate of the match when he played square passes with Zimmermann outside the box, and slotted the ball to the left of the goalie. This time also Gopal cannot be blamed.

 Jeev tied 7th

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh birdied the last two holes to complete the second round in two-under 70 to be in the tied seventh place at the midway stage of the ?200 million Ana Open on the Japan Tour on Friday. 

Jeev shares the second place with seven others at the par-72 course in the Sapporo Golf Club. 

He is now seven-under and three shots off the leader, Keiichiro Fukabori, whose 10-under 62 helped him to a total of 10-under for two days after a first round of par 72. 

Starting on the tenth, Jeev bogeyed the 11th, paring the rest of the holes on the back nine. He birdied the first with a chip-in but then bogeyed the next. On the fifth, he landed his second eagle in as many days. He again dropped a shot on the sixth to be par with three holes to go. 

Jeev missed just four fairways and required 31 putts as he missed quite a few birdie putts after getting to the greens in regulation.

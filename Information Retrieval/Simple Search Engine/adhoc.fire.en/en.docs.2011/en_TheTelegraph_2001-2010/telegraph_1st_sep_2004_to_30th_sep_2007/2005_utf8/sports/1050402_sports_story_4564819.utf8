 Shoaib available for rest of tour

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar on Friday made himself available for the Indian tour, but emphasised that his selection was subject to the opinion of his trainer. 

?I am feeling good but the final decision on my fitness and comeback will be made by Grant Compton, who, I believe, will submit his report to the Pakistan Cricket Board and national selectors by Monday,? Shoaib said. 

The 29-year-old fast bowler bowled four overs against Leicestershire in a Twenty20 match that the PCB XI won by 53 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium. (PTI)

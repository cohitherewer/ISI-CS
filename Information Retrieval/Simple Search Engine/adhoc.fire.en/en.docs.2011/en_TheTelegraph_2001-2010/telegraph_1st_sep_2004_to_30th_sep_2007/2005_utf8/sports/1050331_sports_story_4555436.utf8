The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bob Woolmer warns against complacency

Hyderabad: Having managed to level the Test series with a resounding victory in Bangalore, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has warned his players to guard against complacency in the one-day series, saying success in the shorter version of the game depend mostly on performance on that particular day. 

?It was team work which gave us a good boost at Bangalore and we could defeat India to square the series 1-1, but the one-day series is a different ball game and the dynamics are different,? Woolmer said on the sidelines of the one-day warm-up match between Pakistan and India A at the Visakha Stadium here on Wednesday. 

The South Africa-born Englishman said he was confident Pakistan would do well in the ODIs as well, and so they were taking the practice match seriously. 

?We are doing well and hope to do better in the matches as India is a strong side and we have a few newcomers. 

Asked why five of the top order players were rested in this crucial warm up match ahead of the one day series, the coach said ?they opted out on valid reasons.? 

?Three of the players are down with flu while two were actually rested,? he informed. 

Inzamam-ul Haq, Yousuf Youhana and Younis Khan were among those who did not take part in the warm-up match. 

On whether the tight schedule of six one-dayers would hamper the performance of the players, he said, ?to a certain extent, yes. The schedule is tight. But we have to adjust to it?.

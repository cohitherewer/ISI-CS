Bangalore: A three-day camp for Team India ahead of the upcoming one-day series against Sri Lanka and South Africa commences on Wednesday. 

Coach Greg Chappell, trainer Gregory King and bio-mechanics expert Ian Frazer were closeted at the National Cricket Academy here Tuesday to finalise the schedule for the conclave aimed at preparing the players for the twin series. 

The first days action will be indoors, followed by nets in the next two days. 

All the 15 members of the squad named for the first two games of the series against Sri Lanka are expected to attend the camp. 

Dravid, appointed captain for the two series, and vice-captain Sehwag ? who were part of the World XI for the Super Series against Australia ? will, however, not be present at the start of the camp but will join the rest of the team members later. 

Besides Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, who has returned to the team after a long injury layoff, and Kerala speedster S. Sreesanth, the lone new face in the squad, are expected to be in the spotlight. 

The one-day series against Sri Lanka begins on October 25 in Nagpur and consists seven one-dayers, while the five-match series against South Africa commences November 16. 

Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan squad will arrive here on Thursday night, via Chennai, adds a report from Mumbai. 

The Lankans will have a practice session on Friday before playing a warm-up game against the MCA Presidents XI at the Wankhede the day after, a BCCI media release said. 

The 15-strong squad will leave for Nagpur on Sunday evening for the first ODI. (PTI)

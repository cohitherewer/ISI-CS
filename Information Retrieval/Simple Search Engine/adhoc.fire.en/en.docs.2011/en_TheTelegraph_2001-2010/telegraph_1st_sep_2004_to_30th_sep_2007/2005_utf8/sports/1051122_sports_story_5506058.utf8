Milan: Italy international Luca Toni scored twice to earn Fiorentina a hugely impressive 3-1 win over AC Milan which left the clubs level in second place in Serie A on Sunday. 

Leaders and champions Juventus, who won 4-1 at AS Roma on Saturday, have 33 points, five ahead of Milan and Fiorentina. 

Inter Milan are fourth, a further five points adrift, after beating Parma 2-0 at the San Siro with goals from former World Player of the Year Luis Figo and Argentine Esteban Cambiasso. Surprise packages Livorno are fifth following a 2-0 win over Empoli. 

Toni, Serie As top scorer, headed Fiorentina in front in the 10th minute when he was left unattended by the Milan defence to nod in a Manuel Pasqual free kick at the back post. 

Milan, who had won their previous eight Serie A matches, fought back 15 minutes later when Alberto Gilardinos glancing header from Serginhos cross sent them in level at the break. 

Just 35 seconds after the restart Martin Jorgensen restored Fiorentinas lead after Milans Italy international defender Alessandro Nesta failed to deal with a cross from Pasqual and the Dane slid the ball home. 

Milan thought they had grabbed an 85th-minute equaliser through Gilardino but the strikers effort was ruled out for a foul on Marco Di Loreto and two minutes later the game was over. 

Toni struck with another stooping header, his 15th goal of the season, to give Fiorentina, who only avoided relegation on the last day of the season, a win that raises hopes of a return to the Champions League. 

Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti was left angered by the Gilardinos disallowed effort which would have made it 2-2. 

Inter struggled to break down Parma in a poor game but relief came in the 68th minute when Portuguese forward Figo cut in from the right and beat Parma goalkeeper Luca Bucci with a low drive into the far corner of the net. 

Cambiasso then made it 2-0, Bucci diving bravely at the feet of Adriano but the ball was cleared only as far as the Inter midfielder who chipped into the unguarded goal. 

Aimo Diana and Francesco Flachi earned Sampdoria a 2-0 win over Lazio, and Palermo fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Treviso. 

In Primera Liga, Celta Vigo climbed to third on Sunday after resisting Atletico Madrids late charge to earn a 2-1 home win. 

Champions Barcelona are top on goal difference from Osasuna, both sides having 25 points, while Celta have 23. 

Real Madrid slipped to fourth on 21 points after being demolished by Barca 3-0 in the Bernabeu on Saturday. 

Celta took the lead against Atletico through Brazilian striker Fernando Baiano after 27 minutes, when he capitalised on a defensive mix-up to score his sixth goal of the season. 

Uruguayan midfielder Fabian Canobbio extended the lead in the 53rd minute, curling a glorious free kick over the wall into the top corner. 

Atletico fought back as defender Antonio Lopez drilled in a header from a corner on the hour mark, and Celta had keeper Jose Manuel Pinto to thank for some fine saves that saw them home. 

Villarreal, who drew 0-0 with Real Zaragoza, are fifth and Deportivo joined them on 20 points in sixth, after securing a flattering 3-0 win at Racing Santander. 

Seventh-placed Sevilla also have 20 points after beating city rivals Real Betis 1-0 in a bad tempered derby, while 10-man Valencia (19) edged into eighth with a 1-0 win over Cadiz. Alaves beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in a match between the bottom two to register a first win in the San Mames stadium, spoiling Javier Clementes first home game back in charge. 

Clemente, who led Bilbao to their last league title in 1984, took over from Jose Luis Mendilibar three weeks ago to try and haul the Basque side off the foot of the table. 

But goals from Brazilian midfielder Nene after seven minutes and striker Rodolfo Bodipo in the 90th left Clemente with one point from his first two games. 

The home sides Fran Yeste put a penalty over the bar with seven minutes remaining. 

Bilbao, without a win in 11 games, are three points adrift at the bottom with seven points. Betis are now one place above them with 10 points while Alaves climbed to 18th on 11.

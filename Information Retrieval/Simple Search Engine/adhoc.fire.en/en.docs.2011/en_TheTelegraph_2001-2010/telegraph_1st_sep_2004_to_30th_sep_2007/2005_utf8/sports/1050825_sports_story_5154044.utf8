 Linetskaya was taken to hospital after suffering a cut 

The father of a teenaged Russian tennis pro was arrested on suspicion of battery after an alleged altercation with his daughter during a tournament earlier this month in Carlsbad (California). 

Evgenia Linetskaya, 18, was treated by paramedics and taken to a hospital on August 5 after suffering a cut on the back of her head ? which needed stitches ? and mouth bruises, according to an individual familiar with the case, speaking on condition of anonymity. 

Her father, who also serves as her manager, was identified in the Carlsbad police report as Semen Linetsky, 49, said Carlsbad policeman Lt Bill Rowland. He is identified in the WTA Tour media guide as Simon Linetsky. 

Linetsky was taken to the Vista jail in North San Diego County and released on bond. Rowland and officials from the San Diego County district attorneys office said no charges had been filed. Linetskaya did not want to press charges, Rowland said. 

It is her desire not to follow up, Rowland said on Monday. At this point, she doesnt want to move forward. 

Linetskaya, through an intermediary, declined to comment. Her fathers whereabouts could not be determined on Tuesday. 

The police apparently spoke with her on phone during last weeks Tour stop in Toronto. Linetskaya, ranked No. 44 in the world, had been scheduled to play this week at New Haven, but withdrew before the draw was made citing illness. 

Tour officials stepped up security at the meet that followed Carlsbad, the JP Morgan Chase Open. 

The father was not to be issued a credential or sold a ticket, and his picture was put up in the box office, said an employee at the Home Depot Centre, speaking on condition of anonymity. Linetskaya was accompanied by an extra security person when she went out on the court. 

The alleged incident at Carlsbads Acura Classic came with the Russian teenager in the midst of a prolonged slump. She has won one match on the Tour since the Italian Open in May, losing her opening match in the last five meets. 

The report was taken early in the morning on August 5, after officers were summoned to the tournament site. Rowland said the report detailed an argument between father and daughter, which at first appeared to be about the prize money. Linetsky told police that the confrontation later turned into an issue over his daughter wanting to drive his car.

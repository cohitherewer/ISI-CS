 Vaughan gets a month off

 Vaughan 

London: England captain Michael Vaughan will miss the first month of the 2005 English domestic season, which starts in April, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced here. 

The 30-year-old Yorkshire batsman is being given a break following his efforts in leading England throughout their gruelling Test and one-day series in South Africa where games came thick and fast. 

Vaughan will sit out of all competitive cricket until May 6 when he will be available for Yorkshire?s County championship home contest with Northamptonshire. 

He will then have a second four-day match, versus Leicestershire, to prepare himself for the opening Test of two against Bangladesh, which begins at Lord?s on May 26.

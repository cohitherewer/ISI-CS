 Belgrade: Ten people were reported injured in a violent Belgrade derby between Serbia and Montenegro champions Red Star and league leaders Partizan after rival fans clashed with each other and with the police on Saturday.

 Belgrade?s B 92 radio said six fans, three police officers and a security steward were injured after fans ripped plastic seats and pelted each other during the match and then fought running battles with riot police after the game.

 The game ended in a 1-1 draw and kept Partizan five points ahead of their bitter rivals in a two-horse title race with six matches remaining. 

 Milan: AC Milan?s Dutch defender Jaap Stam is struggling to be fit for Tuesday?s Champions League semi-final, first-leg against PSV Eindhoven.

 The former Manchester United defender picked up a right thigh injury during Milan?s 3-0 win over Parma on Saturday and had to be substituted.

 Stam?s absence would be a major setback for Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti who is already without centre half Alessandro Nesta who is suspended.

 Milan also have a doubt over midfielder Andrea Pirlo who has been sidelined with a knee injury. 

 Hyderabad: Delhi won the all-India veterans cricket meet, beating Saurashtra by two wickets in the final here on Sunday.

 A 50-run partnership for the third wicket between Kamlesh Diva (51) and Bimal Jadeja (49) enabled Saurashtra notch up 185 for seven in the stipulated 40 overs. For Delhi, Amir Singh (46) and Suresh Kohli (35) added 42 runs for the third wicket. Anil Rana then hit a breezy unbeaten 24 off 19 balls to guide Delhi to victory in the last over with four balls to spare.

 Toronto: Tom Danielson powered up Brasstown Bald to claim a stage win and the overall lead in the Tour de Georgia on Saturday, while Lance Armstrong finally made his presence felt, coming home in third.

 While the 182km fifth stage was won by a member of the Discovery Channel team, defending champion and six-time Tour de France winner Armstrong was the rider spectators expected to see in the leader?s jersey at the end of the day.

 Danielson grabbed victory when he attacked on the final climb to the 1,458-metre summit of the snow-dusted Brasstown Bald, Georgia?s highest peak, crossing 15 seconds ahead of breakaway partner and fellow American Levi Leipheimer.

 Armstrong, who has been in disappointing form during the six-stage Tour, finally made an impression on the race with his third place ahead of compatriot Floyd Landis, who surrendered the yellow jersey.

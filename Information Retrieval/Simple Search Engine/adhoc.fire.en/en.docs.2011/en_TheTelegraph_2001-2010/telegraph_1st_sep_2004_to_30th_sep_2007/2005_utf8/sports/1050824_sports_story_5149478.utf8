The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Arjuna golfer appeals for help

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sheikh Jamshed Ali, the first Arjuna award winner in golf, who is suffering from cancer Tuesday made an appeal to prominent citizens of the state ? especially actors, singers and sportsmen ? to contribute generously to the cost of his treatment. 

Ali now lives in abject poverty. His wife and youngest daughter work as domestic help while his only son earns Rs 50 per day as a caddie at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. The dreaded disease has affected Alis throat, almost robbing him of the ability to speak. 

After reviewing my case, doctors said that the disease is at an advanced stage. But I have firm belief that proper medical treatment can add some more years to my life. But the cost of that will run into lakhs, he said in a written appeal. 

In 1992, the Union sports ministry sanctioned a monthly pension of Rs 2000 for me. But the pension stopped after only 16 months. 

After a long gap of 11 years, the ministry sent me a cheque for Rs 24,000 as 12 months arrears. Since then, I have not received even a paisa from the ministry. I am clueless as to why they are treating me this way, he added. 

Ali hopes prominent golfers, the Professional Golfers Association of India and Indian Golf Union would come to his support, though there has been negligible response from them till now.

Bratislava: Slovakian No. 2 Karol Beck was saddled with the daunting task of trying to stop Croatias Ivan Ljubicic when the draw for the Davis Cup final was made on Thursday. 

Beck, who had been doubtful for the final with a nagging knee injury, will take on Ljubicic, winner of nine out of nine matches in his countrys march to the final, in the opening singles in the Sibamac Arena on Friday. 

Both unseeded nations are appearing in the final for the first time, although the form of Ljubicic has made Croatia firm favourites despite playing in a venue where Slovakia have beaten holders Spain, the Netherlands and Argentina. 

He holds a 5-0 career record over Slovakias number one Dominik Hrbaty and a 3-1 record over world number 57 Beck. 

Apart from his painful knee, Becks preparations have not been helped by rumours circulating that he has failed a doping test. On Thursday he denied having done so. 

Slovakias number one Hrbaty will take on Mario Ancic in the second singles. 

Ancic and Ljubicic will play Beck and Michal Mertinak in Saturdays doubles with both pairs protecting unbeaten runs through to the final. 

Sundays first reverse singles will be between Hrbaty and Ljubicic with Ancic scheduled to face Beck in the fifth rubber. 

Ljubicic, who ended the year inside the worlds top 10 for the first time after consecutive titles in Metz and Vienna and reaching finals at the Madrid and Paris Masters, can match John McEnroes 1982 record if he wins all three rubbers in the final. 

McEnroe claimed 12 out of 12 victories to inspire the US to the title, culminating in victory over France in Grenoble. 

Croatia captain Niki Pilic resisted any temptation to include former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic in his line-up. 

The 34-year old Ivanisevic, selected as the fourth member of the squad, is Croatias most successful Davis Cup player. 

We came here to win, it doesnt matter if I play or not, said Ivanisevic.This is a big pleasure for me and I thank the guys for inviting me.

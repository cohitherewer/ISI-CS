 Ansah brace in Fransa win

Margao: Ghana recruit Benjamin Ansah?s double strike in the first half guided Fransa FC to their eighth win, as they went up 2-1 over Churchill Brothers in a National Football League match for the ONGC Cup at the Nehru Stadium on Tuesday. 

Fransa dictated terms and scored both goals through Man of the Match Benjamin in third and 20th minutes. 

Churchill lacked firepower and direction to score, but reduced the margin five minutes before close through Marcos Parreira, who beat Fransa substitute ?keeper Kalyan Choubey.

 Karthikeyan finishes 11th

Spa-Francorchamps: Jordan drivers stole the show, thanks to some brilliant race strategy and sensible driving by Tiago Monteiro and Narain Karthikeyan at the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday. 

Monteiro benefited from a car that was quicker than his teammates but the 28-year old Indian made up for the difference in speed with some daredevil racing. 

Karthikeyan was pushed on to the grass after being blocked by former world champion Jacques Villeneuve when the Indian tried to pass him at a right hand turn from the outside. 

But the Chennai lad showed great control as he refused to take the foot off the accelerator and still emerged ahead of Villeneuve. 

But more than Karthikeyans brave move, his Jordan crew will be pleased by the fact that their new EJ15B was quicker than Sauber, though they were racing on wet tyres. 

This equalled Karthikeyans best finish in a race featuring a full field. He also finished 11th at the Malaysian Grand Prix. 

At the controversial US Grand Prix, the Indian came fourth in a truncated field of six drivers, after the rest pulled out because of tyre problems.

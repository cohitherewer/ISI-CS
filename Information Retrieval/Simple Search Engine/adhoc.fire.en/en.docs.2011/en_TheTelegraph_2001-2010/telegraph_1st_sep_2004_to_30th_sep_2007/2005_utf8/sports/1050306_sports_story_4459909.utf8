 ?Regent? may do it again 

 TITAN BOY

 Stage is set to decide the 2005 champion of champions at the Guindy racecourse in Chennai on Sunday. The best of the regional four-year-olds will be seen in action for the crown of the year, the 2,400m Indian Turf Invitation Cup, shortly after 4.15 pm. There are a dozen hopefuls in the super Derby line-up but the the winner of the Indian Derby invariably confirms his superiority in the Invitation Cup. However, there have been exceptions like Ministerial, Zurbaran, Simply Supreme and few more who tossed the Indian Derby winners aside in this variety of the classic race. Therefore, those who value records could look for anything but Southern Regent, a comfortable winner of the Indian Derby. 

 However, Southern Regent is a gutsy horse who likes to produce his best under trying conditions. Otherwise the Razeen-Allinda son could not have collected four regional Derbies in a shade over six months. Reports are that the Ganapathy-ward has travelled well from Mumbai, and is in good condition too.

 The challenge to the the MAM Ramaswamy-property could come from Andreyan who was given a poor ride by C. Alford in the Indian Derby. The Rashid Byramji-trainee was kept on the wide out of a big field throughout the Derby trip and he still finished a good fourth. Another one who may trouble the Regent could be Venus Arising, the failed-favourite in the Mumbai Derby which came a week too early for the runaway winner of the Okas.

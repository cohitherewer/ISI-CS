 New Delhi: Women cueists will, for the first time, participate in any mutli-discipline event when they compete for two gold medals on offer at the 2006 Doha Asian Games.

 The Asian Games Cue Sports Organising Committee has decided to hold medal competitions for women in the 8-ball pool singles and 9-ball pool singles for the first time in the history of the Games.

 The irony is that there are no pool competitions for women in the country. The BSFI said, however, that the first-ever 8-ball and 9-ball pool nationals for women will be held in July.

 Berlin: All 28 Olympic sports will face a vote to remain on the Games programme for 2012, the IOC said on Wednesday. The sports will face the vote one by one and must win a majority from IOC members at a session in July.

 If a sport is dropped, the IOC executive board will select a replacement from a list of five applicants ? rugby, squash, roller sports, golf and karate. The vote for the 28 sports will take place in Singapore on July 8. The last sport to be removed from was polo in 1936.

 London: England captain Martin Corry has been banned for three weeks for striking fellow-British and Irish Lions loose forward Richard Hill with his elbow in Leicester?s 17-19 loss to Saracens on Sunday. Corry, who admitted his guilt when he appeared before a three-man Rugby Football Union hearing on Tuesday evening, will miss Leicester?s Heineken Cup semi-final against Toulouse on Sunday.

 London: Frenchman Olivier Jacque will replace injured German rider Alex Hofmann for the next two rounds of the MotoGP World Championship in China and France, the Kawasaki team said on Wednesday.

 Hofmann cracked his wrist in an embarrassing fall during a demonstration ride to promote last weekend?s Portuguese Grand Prix and complications have ruled him out at least until the Italian round of the series in Mugello on June 5.

 Bucharest: Players at troubled club Universitatea Craiova will have to pay their own way for Saturday?s trip to Romanian first division rivals Cluj. 

 Craiova owner Dinel Staicu offered the club to the city council for free last weekend but the mayor rejected the proposition saying there was no money in city hall?s budget to support the team.

 Craiova have won just three of their 20 games so far this season and are likely to be relegated from the top flight for the first time in their history. 

 London: Blackburn Rovers defender Andy Todd has been charged with violent conduct by the FA after appearing to elbow two-goal Robin van Persie in Arsenal?s 3-0 win in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. Todd?s case will be heard on Thursday, the FA said on its website on Tuesday. Van Persie was caught by Todd after peeling away to celebrate scoring Arsenal?s third goal in stoppage time in Cardiff. He needed treatment after bleeding from his mouth. 

 Rio de Janeiro: Former Brazil goalkeeper and coach Emerson Leao has resigned as boss of Sao Paulo five days before the start of the Brazilian championship. Sao Paulo said on their official website on Tuesday that the coach had accepted an offer to take over Japanese club Vissel Kobe.

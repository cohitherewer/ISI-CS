 Mauresmo eyes Big W

 Amelies best performances have come away from home 

London: Although the pressure cooker atmosphere of Roland Garros looms next week, Frances Amelie Mauresmo is already looking towards Wimbledon as she seeks a first Grand Slam crown. 

Despite having reached the world No. 1 spot last year, the 25-year-old has yet to win one of tennis four major tournaments in more than a decade on the Tour. 

The pressure at the French Open has always proved too much for her and her best performances have come away from home. 

A runner-up in the Australian Open in 1999, she has reserved her best results in recent years for Wimbledon, reaching the semis twice in the past three years. 

Her powerful, attacking game is well suited to the slick lawns of the All England Club and the world No. 3 has opted to follow a tried and tested preparation schedule, signing up to fine tune her grasscourt game at Eastbourne. 

I had a great week last year, the Frenchwoman said. It was a great way to prepare for Wimbledon... the courts were in many ways better than Wimbledons and very nice to play on. 

A semi-finalist at Devonshire Park last year, Mauresmo said: I am looking forward to trying to win the trophy this year. 

It is always a strong tournament, with excellent players and it will be tough to win, but I am playing well and will give it a good go. (Reuters)

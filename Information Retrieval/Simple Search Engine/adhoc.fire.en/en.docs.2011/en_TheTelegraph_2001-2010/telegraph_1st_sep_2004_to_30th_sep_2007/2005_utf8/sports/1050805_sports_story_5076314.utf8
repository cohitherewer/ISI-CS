 Owen can be key to World Cup dream

 - If he joined United, and trained every day with Rooney, it will benefit England: Eriksson 

HENRY WINTER in LONDON

 Eriksson feels Owen is better than Ronaldo as a goalscorer, or at least in the same class 

Sven-Goran Eriksson sat on Wednesday in a modest East London pavilion, a short free-kick away from the tundra of council pitches where Ashley Cole, John Terry and Jermain Defoe honed their schoolboy skills, a dead-ball strike away from where David Beckham began bending balls, and talked of his belief in his England players and their World Cup dream. 

If Eriksson continues to discard the caution that has held England back, Beckham amp; Co. will head to Germany next June with no fear, and no excuses. 

Were one of the teams who can win the World Cup, Eriksson said. We will have a lot of respect for other countries. But scared? No. If we are all fit, we know we can compete with any team. 

When the other teams look at our players like Beckham, Owen, Rooney, Gerrard, Lampard and Terry, they have a lot of respect for us. Of course there are other teams. Brazil impressed enormously in the Confederations Cup. In the final they were incredible, and that was without Ronaldo! I dont know where they are going to fit him in! 

Argentina will have a better, stronger team than they did this summer. Then there is Germany, the host nation, Italy ? you never know with them ? and France, if they qualify, but I am sure they will. But we have a very good chance. Its the best squad I have had here. 

England must qualify first, which is why Eriksson will use the August 17 friendly with Denmark to assess Defoe alongside Wayne Rooney as Michael Owen is suspended for the World Cup tie against Wales on September 3. 

My plan is to pick Michael in the squad for Denmark, and give him a game in the second half, Eriksson revealed. 

Defoe will relish the starting chance, although Erikssons long-term commitment to Owen will not waver, even during the uncertainty over the Real Madrid strikers future. Whether Owen sticks at the Bernabeu or does the Premiership twist, Eriksson detects only positives. 

If he joined Manchester United, and trained every day with Rooney, it will benefit England, he said. If he stays at Real, Michael is still the best goalscorer they have. He is better than Ronaldo, or at least in the same class. I would not be worried if he stayed in Spain. At some stage he would play ? and he would be fresh for the World Cup. 

Eriksson almost worships Owen, the only Englishman he sought to buy during his club coaching career. We discussed signing Owen when I was at Lazio six years ago, the Swede said. At the time, Sergio Cragnotti [Lazios president] was in good health financially. He could have paid a lot of money for Owen. 

The fee is lower now. At ?12 million, if that is the price, I do not believe Michael is that expensive, Eriksson said. Wherever Michael goes he will score. 

As well as players, Eriksson was focusing on coaches on Wednesday as he backed McDonalds campaign to create 8,000 new grassroots coaches by the time he leads his 23 players out to Germany. 

By then, all English eyes will be on one coach, one squad and one dream.

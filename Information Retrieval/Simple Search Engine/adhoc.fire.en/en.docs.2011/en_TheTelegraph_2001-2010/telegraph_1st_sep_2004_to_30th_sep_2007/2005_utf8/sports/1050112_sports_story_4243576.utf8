 Derby day pool was all-time high

 City?s sporting fraternity must have enjoyed the exciting 

 contests on Sunday, the Derby day. It?s in the records and 

 the RCTC big-wigs had reason to bask in the exuberance of 

 a huge turn out that pushed the totalisator to an all-time 

 high of Rs 88 lakh. Never before the Derby day crowd had 

 matched the January 1 attendance at the racecourse. 

 If the mixture of favourites and less fancied winners brought about jubilations among their backers, the club?s official were equally delighted for whetting out the appetite for money spinners. Surprisingly, even-money failures were aplenty in the eight-event card but only the odds-on sure-shots like Rasalas, Pure Valour and Serrafina kept their appointment with the winning-post.

 The reason for all this to happen was the star fixture in the race card, the 2,400m Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes, sponsored by Eveready Industries. The outcome of the Derby may have taken most by surprise as the victor Aperitivo, and Formal Invitation who occupied the second slot, were not much popular names in the Derby line-up. The likes of Star Angels, Moon Emperors and Exclusive Affairs got preferential treatment in the betting with the first named going to the start as a 7-4 favourite. But Aperitivo had no respect for popular odds. The 5-1 shot from trainer Vijay Singh?s yard left them struggling by the way side in his Derby triumph. 

 Compliments to jockey C. Alford for following his trainer?s instructions in toto. He was advised a short nap in the dead-end of the field and to wake up only after the decibel level of crowd shoots up. In fact, Formal Invitation, too, was ridden in an identical manner and he was the first one to cut favourites to size below the distance-post. He looked like going strongly till challenged by Aperitivo 150m from winning post.

 The other one who produced a near mind-boggling performance was Daniel David?s Pure Valour. The Conquering Hero-Moon Spell son carried a double penalty against maidens to three-length-plus victory, and virtually from the start. Three wins in four weeks takes a toll on a youngster and if he holds on in training he will be the horse to watch next season. He beat a well-bred juvenile in Raging Tide who needs to be watched over a slightly extended course.

 Adderly, Apprise and Rasalas, too, were impressive in their winning efforts. Adderly looked good because of returning to his winning ways nearly after a winter. Apprise because of his fifth win in-a-row, and without much of a fuss. And finally, Rasalas impressed in his runaway debut win. Serrafina?s back-to-back victory was equally eye-catching. The well-bred daughter of Razeen-Passed So Fast looks good for a hattrick of wins.

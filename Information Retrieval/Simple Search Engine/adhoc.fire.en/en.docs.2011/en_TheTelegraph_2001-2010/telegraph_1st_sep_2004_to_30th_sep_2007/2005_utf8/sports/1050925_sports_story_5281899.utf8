The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Inside view of the resurgence

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Voskoboeva 

Calcutta: Much has been written about the rapid strides made in womens tennis by the Russians. 

A look at the WTA rankings makes the reason evident: Six Russians occupy places in the top 20 ? Maria Sharapova (world No. 1), Elena Dementieva (No. 8), Anastasia Myskina (12), Svetlana Kuznetsova (13), Elena Likhovtseva (16) and Vera Zvonareva (20). Hence all the talk of the Russian rule can hardly be termed an exaggeration. 

Galina Voskoboeva, thus, has a lot of role models, enough motivation. This twenty-year-old, ranked 131 in the world, was in the city to take part in the Sunfeast Open. Her progress was nipped in the bud, as she went down to countrywoman Myskina in the very first round. 

But that did not dampen her enthusiasm, nor her desire to reach for the stars. And she was all too willing to talk to The Telegraph about Russian tennis and herself. 

All the Russian girls in the top 20 have their distinct style, each as different as chalk from cheese. But it is Sharapovas style which appeals to her the most. And why is that? 

Maria plays active tennis, which I admire. Dementieva is another favourite, for she is a fighter ? and that is what I hope to be too. She wins good points, moves well and is generally aggressive on court, says Voskoboeva. 

What has been the single most important factor causing this resurgence in Russia? According to Voskoboeva, it was the opportunity to travel more which opened up the world before them. 

Moving experience 

Elena Likhovtseva and Melinda Czink visited the Mother House and the Nirmala Shishu Bhavan on Saturday. The stars spent a considerable amount of time with the orphans of Shishu Bhavan and were visibly moved. Goodies were handed over for distribution to the children. A different experience, was all that Likhovtseva was willing to say after an emotional experience. 

Sprem-time 

Karolina Sprem entered the final on Saturday. Shortly afterwards she was at the Sunfeast counter, signing autographs. Quite an enthusiastic crowd queued up to secure her signature.

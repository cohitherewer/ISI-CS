 IHF permits six to play 

New Delhi: The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) on Wednesday cleared the participation of six players for Pakistans inaugural Super League scheduled in Karachi under floodlights from September 8 to 18. 

The IHF has thus reciprocated Pakistan Hockey Federations gesture of releasing their top players for Indias Premier Hockey League (PHL), the inaugural edition of which was held in Hyderabad last year. 

Following IHFs go-ahead, captain Dilip Tirkey, goalkeeper Adrian Dsouza, striker Gagan Ajit Singh, drag flicker Sandeep Singh, midfielder Viren Rasquinha and forward Arjun Halappa would leave for Pakistan on September 5. 

The participation of the Indians was under a cloud after IHF said it wanted its players to concentrate on preparations for the Champions Trophy to be held in Chennai from December 8 to 18. 

But IHF did not want to upset Pakistan which had sent top players including Sohail Abbas for the League. Also, there was the fear that if Indian players were not released, Pakistan could retaliate by not sending its players for the second edition of the PHL, sources said. 

However, the IHF is yet to take a decision on whether to release Gagan Ajit Singh and Dileep Tirkey for the Dutch league which kicks off on September 28. 

The duo is keen on playing for top Dutch club Klien Zwitzerland, which also boasts of some of the biggest names of the Netherlands, including penalty corner expert Taeke Taekma. (PTI)

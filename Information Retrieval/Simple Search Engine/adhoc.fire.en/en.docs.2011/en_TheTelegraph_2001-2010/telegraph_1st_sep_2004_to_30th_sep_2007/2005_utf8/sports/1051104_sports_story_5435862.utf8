Brisbane: Ricky Ponting rescued Australia from an early collapse with a defiant century on Day I of the first Test against the West Indies on Thursday. 

Ponting produced a perfect captains knock of 149 after Australias new-look batting line-up had crumbled, guiding his team out of danger to a respectable 340 for seven at stumps. 

Corey Collymore led the attack and ripped through Australias struggling middle-order to finish the day with four for 47. 

His fellow pacemen Daren Powell, Fidel Edwards and Jermaine Lawson captured one wicket each, vindicating Shivnarine Chanderpauls surprising decision to field first in the opening Test of a three-match series. 

Vice-captain Adam Gilchrist made a typically brisk 44 during a 104-run partnership with Ponting while opener Matthew Hayden chipped in with 37 in a 92-run stand with his skipper, but none of the other batsmen made a meaningful contribution.

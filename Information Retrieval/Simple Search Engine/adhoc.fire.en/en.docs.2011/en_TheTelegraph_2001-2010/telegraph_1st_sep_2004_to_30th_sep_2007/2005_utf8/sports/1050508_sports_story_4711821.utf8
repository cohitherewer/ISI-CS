London: Premier League champions Chelsea needed a last-minute strike by Claude Makelele to celebrate their first championship in 50 years with a 1-0 win over Charlton Athletic on Saturday. 

Chelsea were awarded a 90th-minute penalty and although Makeleles spot-kick was parried by Charlton keeper Stephan Andersen, the French midfielder knocked in the rebound to score his first goal for the club in their last home game of the season. 

Victory rounded off a bitter-sweet week for Jose Mourinhos men, who secured the title last Saturday with a 2-0 win at Bolton Wanderers but were knocked out of the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday by Liverpool. 

They are top of the table on 91 points, followed by Arsenal on 77 and Manchester United on 73.

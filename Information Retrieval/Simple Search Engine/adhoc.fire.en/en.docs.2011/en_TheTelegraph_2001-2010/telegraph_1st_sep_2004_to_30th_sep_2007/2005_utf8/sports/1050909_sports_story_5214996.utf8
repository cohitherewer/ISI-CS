 Martina slams proposed changes

New York: Martina Navratilova has slammed the impending rule changes to mens doubles, saying they will hurt the sport of tennis as a whole. The worlds top male doubles players have launched a legal fight against their ruling body, the ATP, to prevent it from implementing scoring changes aimed at shortening matches. 

They are also contesting the qualifying rules, which the players said would eventually eliminate doubles specialists. 

I think the (ATP) is just trying to get rid of doubles and theyre doing it slowly, Navratilova said on Wednesday after reaching the womens doubles semi-finals at the US Open with Germanys Anna-Lena Groenfeld. 

I think theyre going at it completely the wrong way. I completely agree with the players because they had no say in the matter. 

The players are against it. The fans are against it. They want to see doubles. Its just a very near-sighted decision by the tournament promoters. 

The 48-year-old, who has won 40 grand slam doubles titles, said it was an integral part of the sport. 

You become a better tennis player if you play doubles, she said. You would be missing out on a big part of the game by getting rid of it. Ive always been a proponent of doubles. Singles helps your doubles, and doubles helps your singles. 

The scoring changes will be tried in six tournaments beginning the week after the US Open. The system for qualifying for ATP doubles events is planned to be pegged to singles rankings only by the year 2008. 

Aimed at limiting doubles matches to 80 minutes, sets would be abbreviated to the first team to win five games, with no changeover breaks and a sudden-death point taking the place of deuce.

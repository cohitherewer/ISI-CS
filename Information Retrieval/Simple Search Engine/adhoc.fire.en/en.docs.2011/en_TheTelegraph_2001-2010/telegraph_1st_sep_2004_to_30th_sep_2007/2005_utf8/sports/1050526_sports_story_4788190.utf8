The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 He is expected to be on the ball from the first day

 - Sourav has associated himself with a very fine County, says Ravi Shastri 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly 

 hasnt yet called Ravi Shastri, but if he does, the 

 only Indian (thus far) to have played for Welsh County Glamorgan 

 will have simple advice. Sourav should just make 

 the most of this opportunity and set the (summer of 2000) 

 record straight? Surely, he has learnt from the past, 

 Shastri told The Telegraph. 

The former Indian captain was with Glamorgan for five years from 1987 ? of course, he couldnt play in 1990 owing to our tour of England. 

Speaking from New Delhi, on Wednesday evening, Shastri added: From what I understand, the County has a young team and Sourav must show what hes capable of? After all, hes a senior pro. 

Asked whether the rather cold Welsh weather could (initially) pose a problem, Shastri responded: No? As a pro, Sourav is expected to be on the ball from the first day? I mean, Greg Chappell should then be worrying about the heat in India! 

He signed off saying Sourav has associated himself with a very fine County. 

Glamorgan, incidentally, is led by off-spinner Robert Croft (rated very highly, at one time, by Chappell) and coached by John Derrick. 

Souravs debut is going to be against Sussex ? once captained by Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi ? in Swansea, from June 1. 

The June 15-18 face-off versus Middlesex will pit Sourav against Irfan Pathan.

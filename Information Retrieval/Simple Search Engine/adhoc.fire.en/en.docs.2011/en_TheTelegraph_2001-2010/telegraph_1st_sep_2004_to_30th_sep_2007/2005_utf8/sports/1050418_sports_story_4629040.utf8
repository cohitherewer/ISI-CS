 CA?s 4-yr MoU with ACA

 - Boon reappointed selector for two more years 

Melbourne: The board of Cricket Australia (CA) said on Sunday that it has endorsed a proposed four-year memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Australian Cricketers? Association (ACA). 

CA chairman Bob Merriman said the proposed memorandum, after months of negotiations, represented an agreement that was fair to all parties. 

?It pays Australian elite cricket players well, it encourages young, up-and-coming athletes to choose cricket as their professional sporting career option and it offers Australian cricket improved ability to more aggressively drive participation in the game at a community level,? Merriman said in a statement. 

?Above all, it is an agreement which allows all Australian cricket stakeholders to continue to work together to ensure cricket retains its position as Australias favourite sport.? 

CA said the next step was to document the proposed agreement. 

The head body said once it was finalised, a joint CA/ACA communication programme will ensure international and state players, national and state administrators, media and other stakeholders understand the detail of how the new agreement will operate from July 1 this year. 

CA directors also discussed at a meeting issues relating to the next southern summer?s Australian cricket programme, which will feature tours by South Africa and the West Indies. 

It expected touring details to be finalised shortly and announced within the next month. 

The meeting also endorsed targets for a new four-year Australian cricket strategy, developed in close consultation with state cricket associations and others during the last nine months, designed to ensure cricket continues to be Australia?s favourite sport. 

The board endorsed David Boon?s reappointment as a selector for a further two years. Current selectors Trevor Hohns and Andrew Hilditch were appointed for two-year terms last year.

Hanover: Injury-hit Australia must decide whether to gamble on the fitness of Mark Viduka when they play for their Confederations Cup future with group A favourites Argentina in Nuremberg on Saturday. 

Australia coach Frank Farina opted to play John Aloisi as a lone striker in Wednesdays unlucky 3-4 defeat to hosts Germany and the Osasuna forward responded with two well-taken goals. 

Viduka, itching to make a comeback after six months of injury problems, was left on the bench but Farina is likely to call on his top striker as Australia bid for the win they need to stand a chance of making the semi-finals. 

Mark is keen to play and hes looking good in training but we werent sure about him for that intense first match, Farina said. 

Well give him the extra training sessions before the next game and possibly use him off the bench. 

Farina will definitely have to find a replacement for defender Tony Popovic, who is out of the tournament after suffering an ankle injury against Germany. John McKain should be the man to come in. 

Germany know they were lucky to escape with a win against Australia after their comical defending and captain Michael Ballack is demanding an improved performance against Tunisia. 

If we keep conceding what are effectively own-goals were going to continue having problems, said Ballack. 

Per Mertesacker, who blasted in Germanys second goal, should recover from a slight knock to play but Juergen Klinsmann is due to make at least one change, with Jens Lehmann coming in to replace Oliver Kahn in goal as part of his rotation policy. 

Meanwhile, Australia have lodged a formal complaint with Fifa over the Bastian Schweinsteiger tackle that has ended Popovics involvement in the meet.

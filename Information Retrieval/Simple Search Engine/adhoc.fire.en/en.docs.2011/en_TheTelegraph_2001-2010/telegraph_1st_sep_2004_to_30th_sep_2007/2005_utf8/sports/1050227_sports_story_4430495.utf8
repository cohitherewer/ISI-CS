The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Inaugural PHL a success, despite a 

 few kinks 

Stickwork 

Gurbux Singh

 Barring a few organisational snags 

 that always will be, I will call the Premier Hockey League 

 a success. I qualify this ?success? in the sense that all 

 top players of the country got an opportunity to play against 

 each other in more or less similar-strength teams and also 

 with some top international players from Pakistan, Spain 

 and Malaysia. 

 Maybe the hockey witnessed was 

 not of the highest order, but the competition was keen. 

 That could be because many of the players were playing for 

 the first time together in this tournament, there being 

 no club sides. Players were brought together from different 

 units and put in a team and they didn?t get enough time 

 to combine. 

 That was except the Punjab Shers, 

 players of which were mainly from the Punjab Police and 

 Punjab Sind Bank. 

 Hyderabad Sultans got their strength 

 not from local players, but from two of the best Pakistani 

 payers, Sohail Abbas and their Wasim Ahmed. And, of course, 

 Dilip Tirkey. 

 The weakest tier I team probably 

 were Chennai Veerans. This disparity, though, had to be. 

 It can be ironed out in future meets.

 Another point to note from this 

 tournament was the coaching. When the tourney began, I was 

 really disappointed with the nature of coaching being imparted 

 by some of the top-most coaches of the country ? we even 

 had former national coach Rajinder Singh, Ramandeep Singh 

 and the likes in the ranks. I found that the time they got 

 was not being utilised properly. The coaches picked up slowly, 

 and later, it was smooth sailing.

 If you can at all call it a fault, 

 it lies in the inertia of regular hockey. New rules, new 

 four-quarter break-ups were not really the natural thing 

 for a coach to use. Initially, whenever time-out was taken 

 I used to find only a few players coming out to listen to 

 the coach. Later, and slowly, other players joined in. 

 The entire tournament was a learning 

 process. That was the way it had to happen, I guess, the 

 players and the coaches becoming receptive to the needs.

 Sometimes I found that when one 

 team asks for a time-out, the other team would not react 

 and laze around on the field. This is basically a basketball 

 approach. You use even the time for which the rival team?s 

 coach has asked for. That way you get twice the rest and 

 consultation time. That part was also ironed out later, 

 with both teams, players coming out for consultations.

 More importantly, though, I saw 

 some of the senior players starting to consult the coaches, 

 starting to offer their own views. That was another good 

 development.

 While the standard of hockey was 

 generally good, I found only a few matches which attained 

 international standard... only a few good goals, one or 

 two by Sameer Dad, which were really good. Some good penalty 

 corner goals came, not only from experts like Sohail, but 

 also from the developing Indian drag-flicker Sandeep Singh. 

 Sandeep, of course, has to cement his place in the team 

 first.

 Wasim Ahmed was surely 

 the best player on view 

 The format is very modern. It 

 is on record that the FIH is serious about it. In its meeting 

 it was seriously discussed. It was already in the air to 

 bring in four quarters, because this helps in television 

 coverage. I think this format may one day become popular, 

 like one-day cricket.

 I was sceptical earlier, when 

 it was mooted a year and-a-half back. But when I sat down 

 to think of it, I found that like basketball, rolling substitution 

 was already there, and the rest of the changes were only 

 natural. Call it an evolutionary process.

 On the technical part in organisation, 

 maybe some fine-tuning will be needed. Often I found odd 

 sequences like this: a side asks for a time-out and it is 

 granted, but that was while a goal was being scored on the 

 other side! I have given my input on this, and I believe 

 such small kinks will easily be avoided in future.

 With this tournament, another 

 part of hockey has benefited, and will benefit. That is 

 the umpiring. With continuous television coverage, and because 

 of the involvement of such top quality players, a lot of 

 new umpires will come which will help Indian hockey. Here, 

 an umpire is totally exposed, and closely watched.

 I believe that the format, if 

 dealt with properly, can so become the format of the national 

 league, quite like our National Football League, with home-and-away 

 matches.

 Talent-wise, I think, it was a 

 bit of a disappointment. Overall, it was mostly a show of 

 the already established, known players. A few older faces, 

 like Sameer Dad, Baljeet Singh Saini, and Barla, again showed 

 up, but the younger lot disappointed. There were the odd 

 ones like Inderjeet Singh, but the list probably ends there.

 I was really disappointed with 

 the Bengal Tigers? display, but it was really obvious that 

 the weakest teams in the whole set-up were Manipur Rangers 

 and Bengal Tigers. Manipur have an astroturf. Bengal Tigers 

 were a rag-tag combination, selected on the recommendation 

 of three states, Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa, assembling 

 a day before the meet and starting to play as a team. 

 Last but not the least, I must 

 talk of Wasim Ahmed of Pakistan. He was surely the best 

 player on view in the tournament. He was a real treat to 

 watch. Just above five feet, but a bundle of energy. 

 I was open to this experiment 

 and I was right in that the experiment will fetch development. 

 From what I came to know from the sponsors, they are even 

 willing to help the players, the teams, and the states, 

 with software for improving hockey. All that is good. Ultimately 

 the sport will get a boost.

 Let?s wait for the outcome. The 

 more, the merrier.

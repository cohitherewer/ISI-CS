Dhaka: Bangladesh won their first Test series on Tuesday when the second match against Zimbabwe petered out to a tame draw. 

Set 378 to win, Bangladesh resumed on 98 for no loss, but never realistically chased the target and finished on 285 for five with Nafis Iqbal scoring 121, his maiden Test century. 

Rajin Saleh finished on an unbeaten 56, while Khaled Mashud was on 28 to ensure the hosts won their first series since being granted Test status in 2000. 

Bangladesh won the first Test in Chittagong by 226 runs, their first Test win in 35 matches. 

Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu, who scored his maiden Test century in the second innings, was named Man of the Match. 

?We are disappointed because bowling over 140 overs we should be able to get them out,? said Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu. ?Their spinners are more consistent than our spinners.? 

Taibu has been the mainstay of Zimbabwe?s batting, scoring 92 in the first Test and 85 not out in the first innings in Dhaka. He was the series? highest run-scorer with 330 and had an average of 110. 

Bangladesh left-arm spinner Enam-ul Haq Jr finished with match figures of twelve for 200 and was the series? highest wicket taker with 18, at an average of 16.66. 

The hosts had begun the final session on 196 for three and lost Iqbal shortly after the break without adding to the score, while Aftab Ahmed fell 10 runs later to give the visitors a sniff. 

Saleh and wicketkeeper Mashud, however, dug in to ensure they held on for the draw and series victory. 

?The innings of Nafis Iqbal brought the match into our direction,? said Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar. ?But the fall of successive wickets put us on the back foot again, (so) we headed for a draw.? 

Zimbabwe have just returned from suspension after the International Cricket Council ruled the team was too weak to play Test cricket.

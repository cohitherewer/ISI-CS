 Randhawa tied 12th, Jeev 27th

 Jyoti Randhawa 

Chiba: Jyoti Randhawa, returning to Japan Tour after five months, made a good start with a three-under 69 on the opening day of the Bridgestone Open at the par-72 Sodegaura Country Club. 

Randhawa, who has played only three events in Japan this year, is now lying tied 12th and could well have been inside top-10 but for a late bogey on par-three 17th hole. 

Jeev Milkha Singh had a roller-coaster round with four birdies and eagle and four bogeys for a two-under 70 that placed him tied 27th. 

Jeev kept alternating between bogeys and birdies and was one-over after 15. He then shot an eagle on 16th and a birdie on 18th to come under par. 

Jyoti was one-under for front nine and then had three birdies and one bogeys on the back journey. 

The sole leader is Jong Duck-Kim, who shot a seven-under 65. Kim had a perfect round of five birdies and an eagle and no bogeys. David Smail and K. Tomori were one shot behind at 66 each. 

Both Jyoti and Jeev putted well and needed just 27 putts each for the round.

 India missed Kumble vs Lanka

Straight Talk 

Arjuna Ranatunga

 India will always wonder if Anil 

 Kumble could have made the difference. The tourists did 

 not have Sachin Tendulkar or Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman 

 pulled out in the morning. It was a side low on experience 

 and crying for some cool heads.

 Besides, it is too obvious that 

 three left-arm seamers is not the best way to have variety 

 in your attack. A batsman is best confronted when he has 

 different angles, line and lengths and field positions to 

 contend with.

 Kumble, in all the years I have 

 known, is a master in creating pressure. He would have made 

 good use of batsmens defensive mindset and who knows, 

 with a few fielders breathing down their neck, it could 

 have told on the Sri Lankan team.

 At no stage am I running down 

 the inclusion of two debutants in Suresh Raina and Venugopala 

 Rao.

 I would love to see Raina more 

 in this tournament as I liked the way he walked into the 

 middle for his first international game. There are some 

 things about a cricketer which reveal his entire character.

 Unfortunately, Raina faced the 

 first ball of his career like nothing he would have ever 

 faced in his life. (Muttiah) Muralidharans wrong un 

 completely did him in.

 Murali presently is at the top 

 of his form. His googlies are turning four or five feet, 

 which do not allow batsmen to pre-judge him. In this form, 

 it will be difficult to hit him for boundaries. I could 

 remember only two from this game and one of them went dangerously 

 close to first slip.

 Rao, in his first international, 

 has taken a huge step forward. He can hope for a career 

 at this level.

 His performance acquires extra 

 dimension on two counts: one, the side was close to being 

 wiped out at the half-way stage and two, Murali had tasted 

 blood.

 He virtually saw through Muralis 

 first spell, which is no mean feat. Admittedly luck favoured 

 him a couple of times but then the pitfalls of facing Murali 

 is a road which has never been without potholes.

 Sri Lanka too had a youngster 

 who shone through in his opening game.

 Dilhara Lokhuttige bowled a miserly 

 and productive spell and his 21 runs in the middle was a 

 critical contribution. I liked the way he and Farveez Mahroof 

 shared the new-ball burden in the absence of Chaminda Vaas 

 and Nuwan Zoysa.

 I can also offer words of encouragement 

 to Dilhara Fernando even though his figures reflect him 

 to be the most expensive bowler from Saturdays game.

 He went for 61 runs but from Sri 

 Lankans point of view, it is good that he is back. 

 He has that pace and bounce which on good day will win Sri 

 Lanka many a games.

 When you are missing top players, 

 the best of the rest need to put their hands up. India needed 

 Virender Sehwag to bat for long. But personally I would 

 not like Sehwag to curb his natural style. He is best suited 

 to play his own brand of cricket and tampering it might 

 not work.

 Still, if an idea or two comes 

 in his mind watching Sanath Jayasuriya bat, it would not 

 hurt him or Indian cricket at all!

 Jayasuriya too is a blaster who 

 over the years has learnt to shift gears. His batting with 

 dislocated shoulders just can not be measured by runs alone.

 There was a heroism in his act, 

 an act of courage and a raging desire to win the game for 

 his nation. It reminded me of my own knock in a Test in 

 Pakistan when I had four fractures in the thumb but guided 

 my team for those final 60-odd runs with the help of tailenders.

 Dravid, in his first full assignment 

 as captain, handled the side very well. But he missed the 

 presence of a fifth bowler. I would also criticise him for 

 the choice of Yuvraj Singh at number three. I think Yuvraj 

 is best suited at number five or six.

 To suggest that he was asked to 

 come in at three to protect him against the spinners in 

 the middle overs is kind of offering him crutches when he 

 should be walking alone.

 If Dravid did not want to bat 

 at three, Mohammed Kaif could have come at the fall of the 

 first wicket for he has better technique against pace.

 Sri Lanka too have come out of 

 the park with the feeling that not everything is right with 

 their batting line-up. The likes of Maravan Atapattu and 

 Mahela Jayawardene have still not been able to spend time 

 in the middle. It is taking them some time to wipe off the 

 rustiness of a long break from the game.

 They need a good pool of batsmen 

 who can cover up some poor form or injury, like the one 

 we are confronted with on the count of Jayasuriya.

 India, despite the defeat, will 

 take some positives from the game. It is not easy to balance 

 a side when two or three top players are missing from the 

 line-up.

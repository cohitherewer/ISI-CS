 Mumbai ride Muzumdars 105

 - RANJI TIE vs BENGAL 

Mumbai: A carefully crafted 105 by Amol Muzumdar and his 122-run partnership with a free-stroking Nishit Shetty helped Mumbai gain first-innings lead against Bengal on the second day of their four-day Ranji trophy Elite Division group A tie here on Saturday. 

The slightly built played a responsible knock of 105, strung in 380 minutes and hit 13 fours in 254 balls. He stitched an invaluable stand with the left handed Shetty (63) to help Mumbai reach 244 in reply to Bengals 171. 

Mumbai lost their last seven wickets for just 51 runs. 

Bengal mediumpacer Ashok Dinda was the most successful, returning a haul of five for 80 on a wicket that had eased out considerably after being pretty lively on Friday.

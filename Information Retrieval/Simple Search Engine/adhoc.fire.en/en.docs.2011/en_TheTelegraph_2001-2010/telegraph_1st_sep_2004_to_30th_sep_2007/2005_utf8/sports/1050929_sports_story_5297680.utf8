 Ricky Ponting eager to reassert supremacy

 - Super series battle: Australia vs World XI 

 Ricky Ponting in Melbourne on Wednesday

Melbourne: A long Ashes campaign that ended in a demoralising defeat for Australia has not diminished captain Ricky Pontings passion for the game. 

It feels like its been too long (since we last played), Ponting said on Wednesday, a week ahead of the first of the three limited-over matches in Melbourne against the World XI side. 

After the disappointments of our last tour, weve come back and all copped a bit over the last few weeks. Cricket is our way to be able to show everybody that we are very good players. 

The October 5 opener at Telstra Dome in Melbourne comes just 23 days after England reclaimed the Ashes with a 2-1 win over Australia in the five-Test series. 

England batting and bowling hero Andrew Flintoff will be a key member of the World XI for the limited-over matches in Melbourne and the six-day Test in Sydney from October 14. 

Flintoff will be joined by countrymen Kevin Pietersen for the one-dayers and Steve Harmison for the Test. 

Most of the World XI players, including one-day captain Shaun Pollock of South Africa, will arrive here on Thursday. 

World XI coach John Wright said: Lets hope that its successful because, from a viewers and a public perspective, I imagine it is an exciting prospect to see a World XI. 

Wright said that the World XI players would obviously take personal pride in their individual performances, but he also wanted to foster team spirit. (Agencies)

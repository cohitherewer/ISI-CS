 Racing festival from today 

 HONKY DORY

 Mumbai: Stake money has been doubled in each of Saturdays nine events to give a further boost to the weekend racing featuring the Indian Derby on Sunday. The Western India Turf Club calls it ?Festival of racing? therefore, mammoth fields and long drawn nine event cards on each day do not surprise many.

 Nevertheless, the 1,200m Nanoli Stud Trophy may see Acindar emerging triumphant, though the Cooji Katrak-ward may face strong opposition from Pesi Shroffs Sea Spray and S. Padmanabhan?s Rafaga. In his debut run over 1,000m Acindar was surprised by Iberian, but the Storm Trooper-Sea Wind three-year-old seems to have come out well since. The added furlong may also work to his advantage. Mallesh Narredu partners the horse.

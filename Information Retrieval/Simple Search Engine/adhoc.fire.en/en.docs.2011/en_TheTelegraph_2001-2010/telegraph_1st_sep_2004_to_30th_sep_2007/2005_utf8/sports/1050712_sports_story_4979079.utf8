Bangalore: Indias top cricketers wound up a fitness camp here Monday ahead of a hectic international schedule but they will assemble here again on Wednesday for a shortened skill-specific conclave that will see new coach Greg Chappell in full flow. 

Yoga, fitness drills, exercises and other onfield activities aimed towards preparing them for the rigours of season ahead were part of the camp that saw the cricketers sweat out in morning and afternoon sessions. 

Trainer Gregory King and physio John Gloster had a major say in this camp for obvious reasons but now it is the turn of the 56-year-old former Australian captain to take centrestage as the final phase of the camp unfolds. 

The cricketers, who attended the camp at the National Cricket Academy, said the last few days had been fulfilling and they had been able to raise the bar vis-a-vis fitness levels. 

Australian pace guru Dennis Lillee and kinesiologist Charles Krebs also held some sessions with the cricketers, mainly fast bowlers. 

Meanwhile, the duration of the cricket skills camp has been cut short by three days and it would now conclude on July 19. 

According to sources, the cricketers would be closetted with Chappell on Wednesday and on the morning of Thursday when he is slated to give a lecture on cricket skills and interact with them. 

Chappell will also tell them about their shortcomings during the recent series against Pakistan and Australia, the sources said. 

The cricketers will also have nets on Thursday. 

The probables are also playing two practice matches on July 16 and July 19 besides a benefit match ? a day-night affair ? for David Johnson. The two teams for these matches would be drawn from among the probables. 

After the camp concludes on July 19, members of the Indian team would assemble here on July 22 to proceed to Sri Lanka to take part in the tri-series, which has the West Indies as the third team, beginning on July 30. 

Meanwhile, Andrew Leipus says Sachin Tendulkars arm is healing very well but the batsman, who underwent surgery for an elbow injury recently, would have to work hard to attain match fitness. 

The arm is looking like it is healing very well, said Leipus, who is here as a consultant to NCA for a brief period. He had met Tendulkar in Mumbai before coming to the city.

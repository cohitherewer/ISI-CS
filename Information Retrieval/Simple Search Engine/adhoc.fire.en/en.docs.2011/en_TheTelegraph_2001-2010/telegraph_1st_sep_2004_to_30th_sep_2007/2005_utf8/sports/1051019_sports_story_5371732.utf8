 Ebrahims options open

 Armaan Ebrahim 

Chennai: Indias new racing sensation Armaan Ebrahim does not have a licence to drive on Indian roads, but seems to be headed for more laurels in the sport after having proved his critics wrong with his exploits in the Formula BMW Asia recently. 

The 16-year-old Chennai boy, who was felicitated on Tuesday at a function here for ending the season with a runner-up finish at Shanghai on Sunday, said he had to choose amongst various options, including competing in F-3, for the coming season but it depended on the budget. 

I have proved the critics wrong with my performance in the FBMW season on my debut and have qualified for the world finals to be held in Bahrain on December 16, he told the media. 

 He said he was leaving on Tuesday for Portugal for the A1. 

Talking about his role model Narain Karthikeyan, Ebrahim said, I had spent the weekend with him. Everything said and done, he is the best Indian. It was unfortunate that he met with an accident after being in the 12th spot in Shanghai.

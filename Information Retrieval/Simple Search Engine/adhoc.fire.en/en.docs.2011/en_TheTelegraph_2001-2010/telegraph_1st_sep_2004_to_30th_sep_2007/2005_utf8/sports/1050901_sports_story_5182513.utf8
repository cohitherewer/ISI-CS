Harare: New Zealand secured a place in the final of the triangular series with a 27-run win over Zimbabwe in Harare on Wednesday. The Black Caps scored 238 and dismissed the hosts for 211 in 49 overs. 

Zimbabwes third consecutive defeat in the tournament has virtually confirmed India as New Zealands opponents in Tuesdays final. 

New Zealand, however, had a wake-up call as Zimbabwe redeemed themselves with a brave performance. Allrounder Andy Blignaut flew the flag high for the beleaguered hosts as he first broke the back of the Black Caps line-up with four for 46 and followed it up with a fighting half-century. 

Blignauts valiant 50 came from 47 balls and contained two sixes including one slashed over third man off fast bowler Shane Bond in the closing stages of the innings as he took the fight to the rival camp. 

Bond returned with figures of four for 17 while Kyle Mills (two for 34) and Daniel Vettori (two for 46) shared the spoils. 

However, the New Zealands fragile top-order remained a concern for Stephen Fleming. 

They had to rely on a 62-run fifth-wicket stand between Nathan Astle (61) and Scott Styris (63) to bail them out of a precarious 67 for four. 

Fleming opted for the brave course of giving his batsmen the first use of the wicket but the conditions were largely overwhelming for his batsmen. 

It all started from the first over when Lou Vincent was caught behind the wicket off Heath Streak. But Astle and Styris eked out important stands of 62 and 79 runs for the fifth and eighth wicket and with a valuable cameo of 47 from 47 balls from Vettori, New Zealand were able to bat till the last over of the innings. 

Apart from Blignaut, Gavin Ewing (three for 31) and Anthony Ireland (two for 61) played good supporting hands. 

Zimbabwe in reply lost Brendon Taylor (0) and Chibabha (0) with only five on the board but then there were moments at the crease which kept the vocal crowd at the Harare Sports Club interested. 

Vusi Sibanda (21 off 30 balls) was looking extremely good before he foolishly went for a second run and Jacob Oram from the off-side sweepers position caught him short of the crease. 

Tatenda Taibu (16) was done in by an armer from Vettori and when Stuart Carlisle, after a rather painful stay of 30 from 81 balls, was bowled out to debutant Jatin Patel, Zimbabwe were 87 for five. 

Streak (18) became Vettoris second victim when he was stumped yards down the track to leave Zimbabwe gasping at 93 for six. 

Coventry and Blignaut had an entertaining seventh-wicket stand of 63 from 42 balls which was highlighted by formers two successive sixes off Patel.

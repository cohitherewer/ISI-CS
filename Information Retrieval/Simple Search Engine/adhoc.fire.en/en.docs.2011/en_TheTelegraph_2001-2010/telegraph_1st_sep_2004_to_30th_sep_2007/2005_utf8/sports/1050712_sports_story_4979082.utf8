Calcutta: They picked up a racket for the first time the same day, they have common hobbies (painting and swimming), they share the same classroom. Meet Methodist Schools two-member table tennis army ? twins Soumy and Sayani Ghosh. 

Daughters of badminton-playing parents Susanta and Swapna, the duo was the cynosure on the final day of the Patterson Memorial inter-school meet. Class VIII students Soumy and Sayani, who turned 13 on Saturday, gave themselves a belated birthday gift by winning the girls team championship. 

Like most twins, Soumy and Sayani love hunting together ? representing their school, pairing up in doubles whenever the opportunity presents itself and practising together. 

Finding good practice partners is often a problem, but in our case its so simple? we just have to pick up our rackets and make the trip to Kishore Mahal (club in Dum Dum where they practise), said Soumy, the elder sister by three minutes. 

Going by results, Sayani is the better player. She won the womens singles title in a meet in Purulia earlier this year. But Soumy is the better student, she always gets 80 per cent, Sayani pointed out. 

They took to the game late, getting their first lessons when they were in Class V. But why table tennis and not badminton, a sport their parents played at the state level? There wasnt any badminton courts around our place (in Bally), we were never attracted to that game, said Soumy.

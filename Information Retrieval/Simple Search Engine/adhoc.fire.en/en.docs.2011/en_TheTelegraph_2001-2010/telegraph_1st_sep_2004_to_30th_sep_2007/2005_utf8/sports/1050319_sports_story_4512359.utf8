The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I could have done better: Harbhajan

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Harbhajan Singh at the Eden on Friday, the third day of the second Test against Pakistan 

Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh, who returned figures 

of two for 94 (at the Eden) in his first Team India appearance since having his 

action cleared by the International Cricket Council, said he could have ?done 

better.? 

The off-spinner came under a cloud (for the second 

time in his seven-year career) when he was reported to the world body during last 

December?s tour of Bangladesh. 

?Theek gaya, lekin I could have done better. 

Some spells were good, but at times, I bowled short at Pakistan,? Harbhajan, who 

has a hattrick here, told The Telegraph on Friday evening. 

Asked whether he was somewhat nervous when Sourav Ganguly gave him the ball on the second afternoon, Harbhajan replied: ?Not at all? I wasn?t under additional pressure either?? 

Incidentally, he has now become India?s most successful off-spinner, overtaking Erapalli Prasanna?s tally of 189. His reads 191. 

Looking ahead to the two days that remain in the second Test, Harbhajan observed: ?The final day is going to be interesting if we get big runs tomorrow? We will then be able to attack?? 

However, he agreed the wicket was ?playing very well.?

Mumbai: Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar, who returned here early on Monday from London, said he wants to meet newly-appointed Team India coach Greg Chappell before making any comments about him. 

I need to meet him first, said the champion player, who is set to miss the triangular series in Sri Lanka in July-August. 

Sachin said he will need 14 to 16 weeks to return to competitive cricket after undergoing an elbow surgery. 

It (recovery process) is progressing quite well and I will need 14 to 16 weeks to return to competitive cricket, he said on his return at the Mumbai airport. 

I have been given a programme to follow. I will go back to London to consult the doctor again, said the ace batsman. (PTI)

 ?I?d have given Sourav a 4-match ban?

 - Viswanath?s innings as Match Referee is over 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Gundappa Viswanath 

Calcutta: Gundappa Viswanath believes that the ICC?s six-ODI ban on Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly has been a ?bit harsh?, but he also points out that the ?ban was certainly on, following the ICC Code.? 

?Look, it isn?t that Sourav wasn?t warned about the slow over-rate; he was,? said Viswanath Monday, in the city to impart batting training to the East Zone National Cricket Academy (NCA) students. ?But I guess the extent of the ban could have been different. If I were the Match Referee there, I would have handed him a four-match ban. 

?You must understand that these punishments will vary only marginally with different referees, because we had to go by the written Code,? said Viswanath who completed his assignment in the ICC elite panel of Match Referee in April after a three-year stint. His last assignment as Match Referee was last summer?s tri-series in England, involving the West Indies and New Zealand, besides the hosts. 

On Sourav?s current form, he said: ?There isn?t really any sense in believing that a player?s lean form is temporary and that this lean patch will go automatically. It is necessary for him to go to the nets and work out, study his own videos and work on his deficiencies. That is the only way for a player to regain form.? 

Viswanath, who is now going around the NCA centres as batting consultant ? he said he was only doing so after being asked to, though he had no idea whether it is for a long term or a short term ? felt that while there was no harm in Team India having an Indian as coach. ?I don?t see anybody of any stature who is free for the job at the moment. The top people are busy. Also, as is being said, a foreigner is better in that he cannot be influenced by anybody with anything.? 

When asked if he was ready to take up the coaching job if offered, he said it was a possibility, but that ?at this point of time I would like to spend some time with my son Daibik, who is just about learning the game, and with my family.? 

When asked if the Indian team needed a psychologist for the motivation, he said ?yes, the team has done well with a psychologist before and it will only be good to have one. He, though, does not need to be on the payroll constantly, but before a series or such, and in every preparatory phase.? 

Viswanath will be in the city till Thursday morning.

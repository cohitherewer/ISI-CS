The Telegraph - Calcutta

 SBT beat Churchill 3-1

Kozhikode: Riding on a second half brace by striker Abdul Hakkim, State Bank of Travancore (SBT) went on to register a convincing 3-1 win over Churchill Brothers, Goa, in a National Football League tie for the ONGC Cup at the Corporation Stadium here on Friday. 

Both the teams, going for an all-out win to retain their place in the league, were goalless at half-time. 

Three minutes into the second half, Hakkim came up with a powerful strike from a clever pass from Sylvester Ignatius to move SBT ahead. 

Breaking the rival defence at will, Man-of-the-Match Hakkim netted the second goal in 67th minute after neatly collecting a push from Mohammed Aslam. 

With the Goan team resorting to an attacking game, one of the three foreigners and their star striker, Yusif Yakubu of Ghana scored in the 75th minute, raising hopes of an unlikely comeback for the visitors. 

Even as Churchill tried hard to bring in the equaliser in the closing stages, SBT?s Abdul Noushad beat opponent?s custodian, Marc Mascarenhas, by successfully guiding a cross from Hakkim in the 80th minute to seal the issue in SBT?s favour. (PTI)

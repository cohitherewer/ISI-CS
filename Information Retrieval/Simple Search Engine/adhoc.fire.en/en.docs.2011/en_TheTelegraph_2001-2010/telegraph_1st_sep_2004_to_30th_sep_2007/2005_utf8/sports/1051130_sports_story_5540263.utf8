 Rooney can achieve anything he wants, feels Beckham

 - Ronaldinho the biggest threat to me personally to win something? 

Matt Hughes

As David Beckham surveyed his new state-of-the-art football academy in East London that he hopes will deliver the superstars of the future, it was ironic that he should reserve most of his praise for the last of the backstreet footballers. At the tender age of 20, Wayne Rooney is only just too old to enrol, but such a precocious talent has never needed any coaching. 

Beckham believes that the Manchester United forward can achieve anything he wants to in the sport, comparing him favourably with legends past and present such as George Best and Ronaldinho, although the most insightful comparison was with his own son. Like eight-year-old Brooklyn Beckham, Rooney goes on to the pitch simply seeking to enjoy himself, with the result often bringing equal pleasure to millions more. 

Wayne goes out on to the pitch not worrying about anything, like my son would go out into the garden to play and have fun, Beckham said. He just goes out on to the pitch and tries to do different things. Thats why hes a great player and people love him so much because he tries different things every time he plays. Is he still young enough to come here? 

After orchestrating Manchester Uniteds 2-1 win over West Ham United at the weekend, Rooney revealed his ambition to be remembered in the same way as Best, and Beckham feels that he is well on the way. The England captain praised his teammates ability to win games single-handedly, which he may have to do if Sven-Goran Erikssons team are to triumph at next summers World Cup finals in Germany. 

Wayne is proving what a great player he is week in, week out, Beckam said. Hes talked about as a young player, but hes winning games for Manchester United. He has a lot of good players with him, but singlehandedly hes performing in a way that George Best would be proud of. 

Wayne is getting better every game. Hes learning more, performing and his confidence is high. When youre confidence is high you believe you can do anything you want which is what George Best was like. He goes into games believing he can do anything. 

People will always pin a lot on great players and its the same with Ronaldinho at Barcelona. People talk about him winning games week in, week out and its the same with Wayne. Thats the expectations of football these days and the way great players are. 

Beckham knows all about the expectations that surround Ronaldinho, though unfortunately for him the Brazil player tends to fulfil them. After being crowned as European Footballer of the Year on Monday, Ronaldinho is aiming to retain La Liga with Barcelona and the World Cup with Brazil, with Beckham coming to regard him as his nemesis. 

Ronaldinho is definitely the biggest threat to me personally to win something, but Ill never get fed up of him, he said. Barcelona are a strong team with great togetherness and Brazil have got five or six other players like him so will be a huge threat at the World Cup. 

With no sign of a trophy in two and a half years at Real Madrid, Beckhams reign in Spain has not proved as regal as he would have hoped and with the club sixth in La Liga, he said that its all going off at the club at the moment. 

Despite the turmoil Beckham wants to end his career at the Bernabeu but concedes they need to strengthen, with Thierry Henry and Roy Keane top of his personal shopping list. It would be amazing if Thierry Henry came to Madrid, he said. Roy Keane is a great player and I would love to see him there. He definitely has got a few more years left in him yet. 

It may not be long before Real make a bid for Rooney.

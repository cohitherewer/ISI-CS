 Shoaib should have been picked: Akram

Karachi: Former Test captain Wasim Akram believes Pakistan will struggle on their Caribbean tour without Shoaib Akhtar. 

Shoaib was not selected on fitness grounds after he pulled out of the tour of India earlier this year with a hamstring injury. 

?Shoaib should have been picked for this series,? Wasim said. ?Without him and Mohammed Sami, the Pakistan bowling will struggle on the West Indian pitches. 

Sami is injured and will miss the three ODIs and two Tests in the Caribbean, but Shoaib had declared himself fit to tour. 

?I dont think he should have been discarded in this manner,? said Akram. ?If he has disciplinary problems, it is up to the board and the captain to sort it out.

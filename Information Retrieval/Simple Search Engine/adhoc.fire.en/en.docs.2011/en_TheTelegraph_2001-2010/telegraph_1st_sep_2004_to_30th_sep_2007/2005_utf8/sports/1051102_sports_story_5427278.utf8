 Shoaib key to Pak success

 - Mushtaq no threat to England, feels Sarfraz 

Rawalpindi: Recalled Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed is unlikely to pose a threat to the England batsmen, former pace bowler Sarfraz Nawaz said on Tuesday. 

Mushtaq, 35, was included in the Pakistan squad for the first time in two years after being displaced by Danesh Kaneria. 

I dont think Mushtaq will be a threat to the England batsmen. He is not the same bowler he used to be, Nawaz said. 

He is slow in the air and his ball now spins slowly. He should not pose any threat to them. 

Their batsmen have come here after playing a quality spinner like (Australias) Shane Warne very well, added Nawaz, who took 177 wickets in 55 Tests for Pakistan and had a best of nine for 86 in an innings against Australia in 1979. 

Mushtaq, who has taken 185 wickets in 52 Tests, is one of five spinners, along with Kaneria, in the 16-man squad for the first two Tests. 

Pakistani selectors said they had recalled him for his experience after a successful season with English county Sussex. 

To me (fast bowler) Shoaib Akhtar is the key to their success. They should concentrate on ensuring he lasts out the series. I pray he (Akhtar) stays fit, Nawaz told reporters. 

Akhtar, dubbed the Rawalpindi Express, represented the Rest of Pakistan in a four-day practice match against Pakistan last week, and grabbed four wickets in the game. 

Akhtar has a history of breaking down either midway into a series or just before the start of international matches. 

He returned home from Australia early this year after injuring his groin during a triangular series that also featured the West Indies. 

Later he missed Pakistans tour of India and the West Indies because he could not recover from the injury. 

England will be without ashes star medium-fast bowler Simon Jones, who is nursing a knee injury back home. Nawaz said Jones absence would be a big blow for the visitors. 

On dry wickets, Jones can reverse swing the cricket ball very effectively and England will definitely miss him, Nawaz said.

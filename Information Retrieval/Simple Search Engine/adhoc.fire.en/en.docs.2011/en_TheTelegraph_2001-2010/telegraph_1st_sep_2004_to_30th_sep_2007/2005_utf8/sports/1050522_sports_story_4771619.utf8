 Flashing Star for Million 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: The 1,400m Karnataka Juvenile Million, the main event here on Sunday, appears to be a straight contest between Flashing Star and Caprese. However, on his Mumbai form, the S. Ganapathy-trainee seems to have a thick edge over the local filly from J. Dhariwals yard. P. Prakash partners the Razeen-Altitude three-year-old horse.

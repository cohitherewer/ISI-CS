 Wish Owen remains at Real: Beckham

Copenhagen: England captain David Beckham admitted Michael Owen faces a tough career decision but that he hoped his teammate will stay at Real Madrid this season. 

Owen could be fourth or fifth-choice striker at the Bernabeu following the summer signings of Robinho and Julio Baptista, with Raul and Ronaldo already at the club, he said on Tuesday. 

And with interest from Newcastle and potentially Liverpool to consider, Owen may decide he needs regular club games in the season ahead of the World Cup finals. 

Obviously he needs to be happy and to be playing football. That will be his decision and its a hard decision to make, said Beckham. I hope he stays at Real Madrid as hes a good friend and one of the best strikers in the world. 

When he plays, he scores goals and his record speaks for itself. Even last season, when he didnt play as many games, he still looked sharper than Id seen him for a long time. 

Hes at one of the biggest clubs in the world, if not the biggest. Hes got some of the best strikers in the world around him and its a hard team to get into. 

Id obviously hate being on the bench, its very hard when youre not in the team as a footballer. 

I wouldnt say hes concerned, he just wants to play his football. Thats what Michael Owen is all about ? playing football and scoring goals, he does that better than a lot of other strikers around the world, Beckham said.

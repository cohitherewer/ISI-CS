 India to open vs Australia 

New Delhi: India have a tough opening tie, against Olympic champions Australia, in the Champions Trophy hockey tournament to be held in Chennai this December. 

The December 10-18 meet will have five of the top six teams from last years Athens Olympic Games ? Australia, Holland, Germany, Spain and Pakistan ? besides hosts India. 

New Zealand, who finished sixth in the last edition in Lahore, have been replaced by Australia. 

The Athens gold medallists did not compete in Lahore last December due to security fears but are expected to take part in their first major tournament, in Chennai, since their breakthrough Olympic win last August. 

According to the draw released by the International Hockey Federation, India would play australia on the opening day on December 10, which will also see Holland taking on Pakistan in the tournament-opener and Germany facing the defending champions Spain. 

India will play Germany on December 11, Holland on December 13, Pakistan on December 14 and Spain on December 16. 

An Olympic final rematch between Australia and Holland will be played on the final day of round robin matches ? on December 16. 

Germany hold the record for the most Champions Trophy victories with eight, followed by Holland and Australia with seven each. 

Of the other competing teams, all teams except India have lifted the trophy at least once. India have only claimed one bronze medal (1982) in 11 appearances but will use the fervent home support in an attempt to win a spot on the podium. 

It is the second time that the Champions Trophy is being held in India, with the only other occasion resulting a Dutch victory in 1996, also in Chennai.

 Arizza fancied in Bangalore 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: The two of the six runners who are expected to fight it out for the 2000m Jog Cup, Fridays main attraction, are Perfect Mover and Arizza. Both are working brilliantly and have also crossed swords during the Bangalore summer over 1800 metres. Going by that run and their current weights, the one who may come out with a slight advantage is the Jaggy Dhariwal trainee Arizza, partnered by Mark Gallagher.

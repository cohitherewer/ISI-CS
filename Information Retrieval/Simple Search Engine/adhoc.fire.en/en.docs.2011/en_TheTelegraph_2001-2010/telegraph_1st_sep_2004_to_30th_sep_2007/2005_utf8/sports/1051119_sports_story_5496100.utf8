 United bid adieu to Keane

Manchester: Captain Roy Keane shocked English soccer on Friday by leaving Manchester United in mid-season after more than 12 years at the former champions. 

Midfielder Keane, 34, joined United in 1993 from Nottingham Forest for a then British record fee of ?3.75 million ($6.43 million) and has been the lynchpin of Britains most famous club for a decade. 

Keane helped United win the Premier League seven times as well as the league and FA Cup double in 1994, 1996 and 1999 when United also won the European Cup. 

He was the on-field mirror image of United manager Alex Ferguson ? tough, uncompromising and interested only in winning ? and the Irishmans departure after 326 league games for United signals the end of the most successful era at Old Trafford. 

Keane, who has not played since September 14 because of injury, recently criticised teammates for lack of effort in a club TV interview which was never shown, and earned a public rebuke from Ferguson. 

On Friday, Ferguson said Keane has been a fantastic servant for the club. 

The best midfield player in the world of his generation, he is already one of the great figures in our clubs illustrious history, Ferguson said. 

Roy has been central to the success of the club in the last 12 and a half years and everyone at Old Trafford wishes him well in the rest of his career and beyond. 

United achieved a treble in 1999, including the clubs second European Cup, but, having been instrumental in leading them to the Champions League final in Barcelona, Keane missed the dramatic 2-1 victory over Bayern Munich through suspension. 

In September, Keane said he was likely to leave at the end of the season when his United contract ran out. Media reports say United have been actively pursuing Bayern Munich playmaker Michael Ballack to take Keanes place. 

Earlier on Friday, United announced that winger Cristiano Ronaldo had agreed a two-year contract extension that will keep him at Old Trafford until 2010. 

The 20-year-old and has become a first-team regular in attack alongside Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney.

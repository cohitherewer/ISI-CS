 Sydney: Australian cyclist Mark French has had a two-year doping ban overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said on Tuesday.

 The 20-year-old former junior world champion was handed the suspension last year after being found guilty by the CAS of seven violations in the biggest doping scandal to hit Australian sport.

 French denied any wrongdoing and lodged a successful appeal, which overturned the ban on Tuesday due to a lack of evidence.

 The AOC had also imposed a lifetime Olympic suspension on the cyclist but the organisation?s president, John Coates, said the ban would also be lifted following the court ruling, allowing French to compete at the 2008 Beijing Games if selected.

 Khalil will also work with Lillee 

Chennai: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has confirmed that three Test bowlers besides a under-19 player would be joining for training under former Australian speedster Dennis Lillee at the MRF Pace Foundation here. 

The PCB confirmed by a fax message to the foundation on Wednesday that Mohammed Khalil accompanied by Mohammed Asif, Riaz Afridi and under-19 bowler Mohammed Irshad would join the academy here for training under Lillee from June 25 to July 6, TA Sekar, chief coach of the foundation said. 

Our management has always welcomed youngsters in India and abroad to learn the art under Lillee, considered the professor emeritus of fast bowling, he said. 

With Pakistan, despite boasting of the calibre of bowlers like Imran Khan, Safraz Nawaz, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, to name a few, deciding to send their bowlers here for training, the academy has become a force to reckon with, Sekar said. 

According to Sekar, during the Indo-Pak Test match in Bangalore in March this year, the PCB president Sharayar Khan had expressed his desire to send bowlers to the academy. 

Left-arm pacer Khalil had claimed five for 144 in three one-dayers against the Australians this year but went wicketless in the two Tests against Australia and India. 

Meanwhile, another report from Islamabad adds that the PCB is negotiating with a specialist from Australia for taking up the fielding coachs job. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said: I have already consulted Bob Woolmer in this regard... He (the fielding coach) is a specialist trainer of baseball and cricket players. (PTI)

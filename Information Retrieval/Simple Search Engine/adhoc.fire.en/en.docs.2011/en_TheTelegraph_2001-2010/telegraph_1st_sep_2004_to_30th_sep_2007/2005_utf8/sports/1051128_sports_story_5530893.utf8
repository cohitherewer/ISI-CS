 Younis bereaved, to miss 3rd Test

 - SERIES vs ENGLAND 

Lahore: Senior batsman Younis Khan will miss Pakistans final Test against England to attend the funeral of his brother. He flew home to Mardan in the North-West Frontier Province on Sunday after the death of his elder brother, who had been living in Ukraine. 

Younis will miss the Test as he has to attend the burial of his brother, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq said. 

Younis absence is a big loss for us as we are already without Shahid (Afridi) in this Test. But we have to make the most of the situation and ensure we hold our lead and try to build on it in the final Test. 

Inzamam said Pakistan were considering calling up a cover for Younis for the Lahore Test, which starts on Tuesday, and several players who had been doing well on the domestic circuit were under consideration. 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said Khans absence is a major blow to his side. 

Younis Khans absence is a major blow to us because he bats at a vital number three position, Woolmer said. 

Discarded batsman Yasir Hameed and uncapped Rifatullah Momand are being considered but the Pakistan squad already includes two middle-order batsmen, Asim Kamal and Hasan Raza, who did not play in the second Test. 

Pakistan lead the three-match series 1-0.

 ICC may look into six-day Tests in Pak

Lahore: The ICC is willing to consider six-day Tests in Pakistan to ensure completion of the regulatory 450 overs during the winter season. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said on Wednesday that the ICC would be keen to look at such a proposal to beat the problem of reduced overs in Tests in Pakistan. 

The series between Pakistan and England has been badly affected by bad light. As many as 32 overs were lost on the first two days of the ongoing third and final Test in Lahore. 

It is something we have to look at because getting a full quota of overs in a Test is the main priority for us, he said. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan said Pakistan would be approaching the ICC to look at the prospect of allowing six-day Tests in winter. 

Meanwhile, the PCB has asked the new office-bearers of the BCCI to confirm the itinerary for Indias tour of Pakistan early next year.

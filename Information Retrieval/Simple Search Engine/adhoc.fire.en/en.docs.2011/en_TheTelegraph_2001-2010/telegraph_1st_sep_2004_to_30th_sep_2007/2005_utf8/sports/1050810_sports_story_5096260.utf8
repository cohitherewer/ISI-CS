The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ever-Ready beat Tolly

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Ever-Ready rode Habib Alis second-half goal to beat Tollygunge Agragami in their CFL Premier Division match at the Kalyani municipality ground on Tuesday. 

Habib, who missed quite a few chances, eventually scored the matchwinner 12 minutes into the second session when he headed home off a cross from the left-wing. 

Nigerian Eugene Gray, who signed for Ever-Ready only on the previous day, was the one who made all the difference. 

He was involved in almost all attacks for Ever-Ready. This was Tollygunges third loss in four matches.

 PCB seeks Woolmer?s comments

Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sought the exact comments made by coach Bob Woolmer against umpiring decisions in Australia, which may lead to a fine or a ban, officials said on Friday. 

?Yes, we have sought Woolmer?s comments after the International Cricket Council (ICC) drew our attention,? PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said. 

The ICC said on Thursday that Woolmer was being reported for comments made about the umpires during Pakistan?s series in Australia. 

?Apparently his comments are not severe, but we would see it once we get it,? said Khan.

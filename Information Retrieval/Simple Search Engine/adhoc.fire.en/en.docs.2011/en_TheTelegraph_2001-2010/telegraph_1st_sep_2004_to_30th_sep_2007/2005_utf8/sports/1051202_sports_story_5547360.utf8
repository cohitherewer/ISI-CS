The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kaiser sees Germany in semis 

Stockholm: Gerd Muller said it in Calcutta on Wednesday. And its now Franz Beckenbauers turn to do the guess work, saying that Germany could reach the World Cup semi-finals with a bit of luck when they host the tournament next year. 

We have a young team and if (coach Juergen) Klismann finds his style and his way to handle the team I think he will (succeed), Beckenbauer told reporters on Wednesday. 

He has enough time to prepare the team for the World Cup and they have the home advantage, added the head of Germanys World Cup organising committee. 

At the moment, they havent made a very good performance but they showed at the Confederations Cup what they are able to do, he said, referring to their run to this years semi-finals. 

Im very optimistic. If they (Germany) are lucky they can reach the semi-finals, said Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as a player in 1974 and as national coach in 1990. 

I think there are maybe eight, ten countries that could win the World Cup ? if they beat Brazil, he added. 

Brazil at the moment and the way they played in the Confederations Cup, its very, very impressive.

Calcutta: Pullela Gopichand feels badmintons existing system in the country is still in the primitive stages and needs immediate transformation to help translate available talent into true champions. 

Everything going in the name of developing and running the game is all jumbled up, feels the former All-England champion, insisting that India should follow the path of either Indonesia or China. 

The problem with our system is that we are neither totally government-run nor a club-based one like in Europe, which is financially supported by corporate houses. We have a system which the government supports, but not all the way. So theres a big difference between what the government is doing and what is required. The system may have improved from the 15-20 years ago, but its still in primitive stages Gopichand told a press conference on Thursday. 

Following a stint with trainees at the Badminton Players Association (West Bengal)-nurtured coaching clinic at the SAI, Eastern Centre, Gopichand highlighted that poor quality of courts at the SAI, lack of allied infrastructure and irregular supply of shuttles were hindering progress of the game in the country. 

Meanwhile, the BPA,WB is planning a local league of clubs. The Badminton Association of India of India has been informed of this, said Hirak Sengupta, BPA,WB secretary, and we are waiting for a green signal. 

Calcutta is the right place to start the league. It has good club base like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. Talent is also here. But what I really want to see out of this is that similar leagues start coming up from various provinces. Then we can have a zonal league and finally a national one, where the zonal champions will take part, said the 31-year old from Hyderabad. 

He said his vision sprouted from his stint in the German league. I played the league in Germany for four years. It immensely benefited me. 

Gopichand, however, hasnt set any goal for himself on his return to the court after the injury.

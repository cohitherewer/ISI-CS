Calcutta: The Russians ruled at the Netaji Indoor Stadium as Anastasia Myskina and Elena Likhovtseva moved into the quarter finals of the WTA Sunfeast Open with straight set wins on Thursday. 

While top seed Myskina sailed into the last eight with a swift 6-0, 6-1 triumph over countrywoman Galina Voskoboeva, No. 2 Likhovtseva went through with an uninspiring 6-3, 6-1 win over Sunitha Rao of the US. 

Sunithas campaign ended when she and partner Villmarie Castellvi of Puerto Rico were thrashed by third seeds Sania Mirza and Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-1, 6-3. 

Voskoboeva wasnt given the chance to hold serve even once in the entire match, getting on to the scoreboard, ironically, by breaking the former French Open champion. 

Myskina will now meet Shikha Uberoi, the only Indian left in the draw, in the quarters, while Likhovtseva faces Swede Sofia Arvidsson. 

The Swede accounted for fifth Antonella Serra Zanetti of Italy on Court No.2. 6-2, 6-1 earlier in the day. 

Zanetti was the fourth seed to fall after No. 8 Rika Fujiwara, who was ousted on Wednesday by Shikha. 

Number three Sania Mirza of India went out on Wednesday, while Laura Pous Tio of Spain, the sixth seed, fell in the first round on Monday. 

The Indian got the better of Fujiwara once again on Thursday, when she and sister Neha defeated the Japanese and her partner, Chia Jung Chuang, 6-4, 6-2 to be the first to move into the doubles semi-finals. 

In the first set, the Indian duo looked down and out at 1-4, but fought their way back to 4-4, broke to take a 5-4 lead and then held their set to take the set. 

In the second, a double break was all they needed to take the match. 

Earlier on Centre Court, Karolina Sprem outlasted Puerto Rican Villmarie Castellvi 7-5, 3-6, 6-1. The seventh-seeded Croatian now meets up with Czink, Sanias conqueror, in the last eight. 

The pair traded serves in the first set before Sprem managed to nose ahead 6-5 with a break of serve and then held.

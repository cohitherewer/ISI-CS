 Years worst performance: Bhowmick 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Siliguri: Down, he may be, but he definitely is not out. Or, that is the impression East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmik sought to give after his teams disappointing end to the National League campaign. 

Talking to reporters after East Bengals loss, Bhowmik said that his continuing with the red-and-gold outfit depends entirely on the management. 

On Saturdays match, he said that that this was his teams worst performance this year, but refused to blame the players. The planning was bad, and for that, I take the responsibility, he admitted. 

He even refused to blame the condition of the ground, which he had criticised on Friday, for his teams sorry performance. 

Asked to point the turning point of this years campaign, Bhowmik said: I feel the game against Mahindra United was crucial. Had we performed well against them, we could have been in a better position (to win the league). 

The victorious Vasco coach, Mathew DCosta, on the other hand, refused to single out any one player for the days win. Yes, the Brazilians (Fabio Sores and Sidney Rodrigues) performed well, but they were well supported by their mates, DCosta said.

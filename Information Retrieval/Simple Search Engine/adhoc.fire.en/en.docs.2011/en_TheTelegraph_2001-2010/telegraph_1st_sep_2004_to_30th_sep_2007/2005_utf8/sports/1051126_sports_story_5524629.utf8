 Mumbai bowlers put Delhi on mat

New Delhi: Mumbai bowlers provided crucial breakthroughs at right times to tighten the noose around Delhi on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy elite group A match at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground here on Friday. 

When play was stopped due to bad light on the third day, Delhi were 241 for six in their first innings, needing 160 more to avoid follow-on. 

Resuming at 40 for no loss, Delhi made a sound start by putting up 72 runs for the first wicket. 

In another match at Agartala, Sourastra defeated Tripura by eight wickets to gain full four points. 

Resuming at the overnight score of 182 for five, Saurastra could not make much headway, collapsing at 194 in the second innings. 

But host Tripura failed to capitalise on its success with bowling when three of its star batsmen fell for just 25 runs. Bappa Das first went at the individual score of just two. Ritesh Jaiswal followed for a duck, and Subal Choudhury fell for just five. Tripura ultimately were out for 119. Sourastra, though losing two quick wickets of S. H. Kotak and J. N. Shah, easily scored the required runs to win the match on the third day on Friday. 

In Dibrugarh, Assam were bundled out for 169 but then gave two early jolts to leave Kerala at 58 for two at the end of the third days play of their Ranji Trophy match. 

Resuming at 101 for four, Assam batsmen failed to tackle the Kerala bowlers as wickets kept tumbling in quick succession. 

Meanwhile in Margao, a patient knock of 118 by Pravanian Mallick and his fifth wicket partnership of 169 runs with Niranjan Behra helped Orissa take a 98 run first innings lead over host Goa on the third day of the plate A match, played at the MCC ground here. 

Resuming at their overnight score of 220 for four, Orissa were all out for 333 in 135.1 overs.

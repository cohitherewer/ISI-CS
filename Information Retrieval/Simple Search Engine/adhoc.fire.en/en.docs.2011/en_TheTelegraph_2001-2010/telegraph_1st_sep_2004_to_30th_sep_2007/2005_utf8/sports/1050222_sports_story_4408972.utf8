Calcutta: Douglas da Silva is praying for a speedy recovery to his injury and hoping to come back into action with more intensity and commitment to the game. 

?I?m really looking forward to the day when I?ll be able to return and do what I love most on the field,? Douglas, recuperating in a city hospital, said on Monday. 

?It?s something unusual for me, sitting in a hospital bed while the team is playing elsewhere. I hope I recover and join the team soon,? the Brazilian remarked. 

Douglas broke his right shin bone during the National Football League match against Mahindra United at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday and was operated upon the next day. 

The East Bengal midfielder, however, has ruled out seeking treatment elsewhere. ?I?m quite happy with the facilities here. Also my heartiest thanks to the club for its support in times of crisis,? Douglas said. 

He walked on crutches Monday, but it was just a beginning to a long arduous rehab. ?According to the doctors, I need at least 8-12 weeks for the fracture to heal. Then physiotherapy and the gradual process of acclimatisation will come into picture. I know it?s not an overnight effort,? he maintained. 

Douglas, though, thinks his absence won?t affect East Bengal?s NFL title-defence and the journey in the AFC Cup. ?It?s true that the coach plays me in a vital position. But Debjit (Ghosh) and Madhab (Das) are there and they will surely fill in,? he added. 

Douglas has mostly been used by Subhas Bhowmick as a vital link between the East Bengal defence and midfield and his goal-scoring instincts from set-piece moves scripted quite a few crucial wins for the team. 

Bhowmick described Douglas? injury as ?a big blow? to his team, while other players, including Bhaichung Bhutia, thought it?s not easy to replace Douglas with somebody else. 

The Brazilian, however, believed in the team?s resources. 

?As the team will play in Goa, my heart will always be with it. And I?m confident the team will get into groove without me and put up a good show in Goa. 

?I?m pretty sure we?ll be the (NFL) champions,? the Brazilian signed off.

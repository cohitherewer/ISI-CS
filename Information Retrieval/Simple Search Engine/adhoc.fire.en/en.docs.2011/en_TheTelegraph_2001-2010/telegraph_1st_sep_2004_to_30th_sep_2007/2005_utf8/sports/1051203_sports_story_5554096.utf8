Lahore: England faced a big battle to save the third and final Test against Pakistan after Mohammed Yousuf (223) and Kamran Akmal (154) featured in a record-breaking partnership on the fourth day on Friday. 

Pakistan went on the rampage in the morning, adding 190 in just over 28 overs as Yousuf scored his third double hundred. Akmal got his second hundred of the year and Inzamam resumed his innings to pass the 8,000 run milestone before falling three runs short of his 25th Test hundred. 

The pakistan captain added 97 to continue his golden run of form. He reached 1,000 runs in the year in eight Tests and became the 14th player to surpass 8,000 runs. 

Ian Bell with an unbeaten 60 and Paul Collingwood on 37 not out steered England to 121 for two at close after Pakistan declared on 636 for eight in reply to Englands first innings of 288. 

England trail Pakistan by 227 and need to bat out the final day to avoid a 2-0 defeat in the three-match series. 

Bell and Collingwood settled into a fighting stand of 91 after Shoaib Akhtar trapped Marcus Trescothick leg before for a duck and then caught and bowled Michael Vaughan (13).

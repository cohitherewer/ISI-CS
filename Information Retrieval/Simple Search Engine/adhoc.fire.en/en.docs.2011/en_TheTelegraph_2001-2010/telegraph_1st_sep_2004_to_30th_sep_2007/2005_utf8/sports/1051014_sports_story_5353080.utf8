 Sania Mirza retires hurt 

Bangkok: Indian tennis sensation Sania Mirzas glorious run was cut short on Thursday when she retired hurt in the second round of $200,000 WTA Thailand Open here. 

The fifth seed Indian was trailing 5-7 against Meng Yuan of China when she suffered lower back strain and threw in the towel before the start of the second set. 

The Indian climbed up to her career-best 31st rank in the latest WTA singles list after reaching the semi-finals of a WTA event in Tokyo last week where she lost to third-seeded Tatiana Golovin of France 2-6, 4-6. 

The Bangkok tour was Sanias last assignment before her scheduled break of around a month. 

The 18-year-old had defeated Slovakias Henrieta Nagyova 6-1, 4-6, 6-0 in the first round on Tuesday. 

Earlier on Wednesday, Sania, partnering Sahar Peer of Israel, made it to the second round of the doubles after beating the US duo of Carly Gullickson and Abigail Spears 6-2, 7-6 (5-3).

 Court order against dissolving SLC

Colombo: An appeals court has issued an interim order preventing the sports minister from dissolving Sri Lanka Cricket, an official said on Tuesday. 

Sports minister Jeevan Kumaratunga last month suspended the government registration of the cricket board and appointed an interim committee to run the sport. He charged that the administration has mismanaged funds and disregarded ministerial orders. 

Kumaratunga was mainly displeased over the board sending Thilanga Sumathipala, a controversial official facing fraud and passport forgery charges, for international cricket conferences. 

Sumathipala was elected SLC president despite the suspension and he has challenged the minister in court. 

Judges S. Sriskandaraja and Sisira de Abrew ordered on Monday that Kumaratunga cannot dissolve the board until a final order is given, a cricket official said on condition of anonymity. (AP)

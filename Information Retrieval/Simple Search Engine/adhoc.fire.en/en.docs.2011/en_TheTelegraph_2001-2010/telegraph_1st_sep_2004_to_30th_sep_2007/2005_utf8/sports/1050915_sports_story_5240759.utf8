 Gagan Ajit slams hattrick in Dynamos victory

 - PAK HOCKEY LEAGUE 

 Halappa-inspired Cavaliers stun Qalanders 

 Gagan Ajit 

Karachi: Indian striker Gagan Ajit Singh and Shahid Rabbani set the hockey club of Pakistan alight with magical hattricks that guided Capital Dynamos to a stunning 7-4 victory over Shan-e-Punjab on the fifth evening of the Super Hockey League tie on Wednesday. 

Gagan Ajit, who struggled earlier on for cohesion and understanding with his new colleagues, was at his best when he outran and outsmarted a formidable Shan-e-Punjab defence that included Pakistan captain Mohammed Saqlain and Indian teammate Sandeep Singh to pump in goals in the 14th, 30th and 58th minute. 

Gagan Ajit not only proved to be an opportunist by making optimum use of the opportunities that came his way, he was there to bolster the defence when it mattered most. 

In an another thrilling contest of the evening, Arjun Halappa-inspired Northern Cavaliers came back from three goals down to upset the applecart of Sindh Qalanders 4-3, thanks to a splendid hattrick by new Pakistan penalty corner executioner Mohammed Imran. 

Sindh Qalanders, enjoying the services of Indian captain Dileep Turkey, looked to be cruising for a comfortable victory when they developed a 3-0 lead after 25 minutes with Kashif Jawwad putting the home team ahead in the fifth minute and Mohammed Shabbir scoring twice in the 18th and 25 minutes. 

But Imran converted three penalty corners in a space of 12 minutes to not only complete a hattrick but to also level the match. (PTI)

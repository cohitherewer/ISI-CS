Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA) is yet to get a no-objection certificate from its Sikkimese counterpart on Bhaichung Bhutias chance of wearing Bengal jersey in the Santosh Trophy. 

The Indian striker, however, made a surprise visit to the ongoing Bengal camp on Monday. 

Bengal coach Aloke Mukherjee was surprised when the Indian striker ? who was undergoing some physical training under Ranadeep Moitra nearby ? asked him whether he could join the practice at SAI. 

Bhaichung played for a little over an hour in the practice match. 

The IFA is planning to include some outstation players in the Santosh Trophy squad if they are not considered by their respective states. 

JCT goalkeeper Kalyan Chowbey, Mohammedan Sporting defender Madhab Das and Sankha Roy Chowdhury of Ever-Ready joined the camp on Saturday. 

But Aloke is so peeved with East Bengals Sasthi Duley, who is yet to show up, that hes learnt to have brought the matter to IFA secretary Subrata Duttas notice. 

The Santosh Trophy squad is likely to be picked on Friday. Bengals first match is against Nagaland on November 5. 

Later, Aloke said that his team would go to Kerala with a new responsibility. 

Its very disappointing that no Bengal team is in the Federation Cup semi-finals. My boys will have some extra responsibility to prove a point or two in Kerala, Aloke said. 

Meanwhile, Gautam Sarkar has been appointed as the Bengal teams observer in the Santosh Trophy.

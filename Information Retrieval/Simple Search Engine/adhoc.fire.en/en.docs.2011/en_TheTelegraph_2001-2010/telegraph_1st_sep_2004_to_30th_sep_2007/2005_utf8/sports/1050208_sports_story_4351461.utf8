 I experienced a lot at first hand: Hoyzer

Berlin: German referee Robert Hoyzer, who has admitted to match-fixing, said on Monday he had first-hand experience of wrongdoing from those he has implicated in the scandal. 

Hoyzer is now co-operating with prosecutors after admitting he fixed seven matches last year. 

?I experienced a lot at first hand and also heard a lot from the key people involved,? Hoyzer told a German magazine in reply to a question about the basis of his allegations against other referees. 

?I would really like to be able to say: ?It was just me and now you can get back to normalcy with your whole caboodle?,? he added. 

Hoyzer said he could not provide further details about the information at this point because of pending legal action. 

Hoyzer stands at the heart of Germany?s biggest sports betting scandal in 30 years, which has tarnished the country?s image in the year before it hosts the World Cup. He admitted fixing several matches from the German Cup and second division. 

Hoyzer told the magazine he was saddened that the children of a former colleague he has implicated were being victimised at school. 

?It hurts when I hear that children are being spat upon,? said Hoyzer, 25, who is staying at an undisclosed location. 

?But I will nevertheless continue giving prosecutors and my lawyers all the information that I have.? 

Hoyzer, who is scheduled to appear in a television interview on Tuesday evening, said he had never bet on any matches he influenced ? an important point as far as possible criminal charges are concerned.

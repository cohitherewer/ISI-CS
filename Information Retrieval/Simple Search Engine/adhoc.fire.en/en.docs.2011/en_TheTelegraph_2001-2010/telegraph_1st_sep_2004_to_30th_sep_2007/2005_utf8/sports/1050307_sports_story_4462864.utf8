 Thumping win for Southern Regent 

 TITAN BOY

Southern Regent, the 11-4 favourite, confirmed his class on way to a thumping victory in the mother of all classic battles, the 2,400m Indian Turf Invitation Cup, the star attraction at the Guindy racecourse in Chennai on Sunday. The fluent McDowell Indian Derby winner early last month, Southern Regent handed RCTC-challenger Aperitivo a defeat of a shade over three lengths, while Elite Zone and Andreyan finished third and fourth, respectively, in a race that was run at a fast pace. The S. Ganapathy-ward was ridden to victory by B. Prakash for owner MAM Ramaswamy.

 MAM was in total control during the weekend, winning four of the five Invitational races to underwrite his authority in his own backyard. He had claimed the Stayers? Cup on Saturday, and mopped up three more ?Terms? races on Sunday, including the Invitation Cup. The Maj. P. K.Mehra Memorial Super Mile and the SAK Japan Trophy were the other events MAM?s runners had claimed during the two-day racing festival.

 MAM could not have hoped for Southern Regent winning in such a facile manner after watching owner D. Khaitan?s Andreyan run in the Indian Derby. On that occasion, the Rashid Byramji?s ward was given a poor ride by C. Alford. So he was expected to produce a much improved performance on Sunday. It was Khaitan?s other runner, Aperitivo, who in the hands of Alford, produced the form that had won him the Calcutta Derby.

 Spectacular Quest?s victory in the Super Mile was equally brilliant. The easy winner of the Bangalore Colts? Stakes and the Mysore 2,000 Guineas was always considered to be one of the finest milers in the country.

 Anand slips to 3rd after shock loss

 Kasimdzhanov caught Anand napping 

San Luis (Argentina): Defending champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov handed Viswanathan Anand a shock defeat in the fourth round of the World Chess Championship here on Saturday. 

The loss proved quite expensive as Anand nosedived from two-way lead to third spot in the $1 million event being played on a double round robin basis among eight players. 

In a day when every game produced a result, Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria made most of his opportunities to beat Michael Adams of England, emerging as the sole leader with 3.5 points from four games. 

Had the Bulgarian not squandered a strong position against Anand in round two, his scoreline would have read an awesome 4/4, something almost unheard of in elite chess circles against such extraordinary opposition in recent times. 

Russian Peter Svidler made sure Topalov did not get a runaway lead in this 14-round contest with his second straight victory in the event. The modest Russian was a bit lucky to beat compatriot Alexander Morozevich in a topsy-turvy game. 

Also ending on the winning side was Peter Leko who had it easy against Judit Polgar, his Hungarian compatriot. 

With Topalov in command, Svidler took his tally to three points out of a possible four with Anand at sole third with 2.5 points. 

Kasimdzhanov improved his situation after beating the Indian ace to stand sole fourth on two points, while the Hungarian duo Judit Polgar and Peter Leko are next in line with 1.5 points apiece. 

Alexander Morozevich and Adams are currently at the bottom of the tables on one point. 

For Anand it turned out to be a bad day at the office when nothing worked. 

The World No.2 started off with the Nazdorf variation and faced the English attack wherein Kasimdzhanov got the imbalance he was looking for. 

The Uzbek, the lowest-ranked player in the tournament, got an advantage in the middle game when Anand went for an erroneous plan and slowly built his attack against a slightly weakened king of the Indian reaping rich dividends. 

Anand fell prey to some brilliant combative ideas in the end and gave in when he was just a move away from getting checkmated. 

Topalov, considered Anands main rival here, continued with his demolition act and recorded another swift victory. Adams, for the second day running, fell prey to some fine tactics well complemented with excellent calculations. 

Morozevich is the other player struggling to make an impact here and was yet again tested by Svidler who came on top from a position arising out of a Kings Indian Defence. 

Peter Leko eventually showed his mettle against Polgar in another Sicilian of the day. Going for the kill right from the beginning of this 25-move encounter, Leko made sure he did everything right.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

Plan is to stay out of trouble

 Overdrive 

Narain Karthikeyan

Its round six and we are at Monaco, the jewel 

of the F1 circuit. The season so far has been very good and encouraging and I 

have been getting positive feedbacks from both the team as well as the paddock. 

I was especially happy with my performance in Australia 

and Imola but there is no doubt that the last race at Catalunya, Spain, was my 

worst of the season.

I had both engine and tyre problem which saw me finish 

thirteenth. However, having said that, we still remain positive and hopeful of 

good results in races ahead.

In the past two weeks, except for the practice sessions, 

we have done no track testing. I have spent most of my time at the gym in preparation 

for this race and for the season ahead. In a sport like Formula One, fitness is 

a very important factor and I have been training hard for the same.

Monaco is a street circuit and is very narrow. I am 

the only driver this season who hasnt been at Monaco before and thats 

a big disadvantage.

Its a very challenging circuit, Monaco, and 

definitely the toughest of the lot. Its very bumpy and slippery with manhole 

covers in the middle of the track. Its more of a mentally tiring circuit 

rather than a physically tiring one.

Its very easy to brush the barriers here and 

be out of the race. I had one such incident on Thursday morning and since then 

I have had to play catch up. Going in speeds of around 300 kmph in such a narrow 

circuit is a challenge on its own.

Another challenging thing about the circuit is the 

long sweeping tunnel. It is the only track in the entire F1 fixture which has 

this feature, and though it is very well lit, there is still a huge contrast in 

lighting.

The turns are a lot more sharper inside the tunnel 

in real then they actually appear on TV and we have to constantly control the 

steering wheel.

In the last race at Spain, I had a few friends who 

dropped in to support and encourage me, but here in Monaco its much quieter. 

The Renaults and the McLarens are again looking really 

strong, but the same cannot be said for Ferrari. It will be very difficult for 

them to turn the tables around but then again anything can happen in Formula 1.

The plan for Sunday will be to stay out of trouble 

and finish the race. This track traditionally has lot of retirements and non-finishes, 

which means that if I deliver a strong performance I might finish at a good position.

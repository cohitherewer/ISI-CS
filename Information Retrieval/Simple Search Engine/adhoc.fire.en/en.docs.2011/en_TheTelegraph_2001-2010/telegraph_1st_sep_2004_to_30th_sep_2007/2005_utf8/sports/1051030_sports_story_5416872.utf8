 Vijai Singh misses cut

 World No. 2 Vijai Singh missed the cut for the second straight week 

Palm Harbour (Florida): Defending champion Vijai Singh missed the cut on Friday at the Chrysler Championship, where Steve Lowery seized the second-round lead with a five-under-par 66. 

Singh, ranked No. 2 in the world, missed the cut for a second straight week. A four-time winner on the US Tour this year, Singh followed up his first-round 74 with a 71, missing the cut which fell at 144 by one stroke. The Fijian, who claimed his ninth title of 2004 here last year, had hoped to rebound after missing his third cut of the season at last weeks Funai Classic. While Singh struggled, Lowery was storming up the leaderboard. 

He carded a birdie and a bogey on the front nine, but came home with a blistering 30 that included five birdies as he completed 36 holes in eight-under 134. Lowery started the back nine with three consecutive birdies and added birdies at 14 and 16 to take two-shot lead over Bo Van Pelt. 

A 31-foot birdie putt at the 10th launched Lowerys run. He followed it up on the par-five 11th with a birdie from two feet after blasting out of a bunker, and he stuck a nine-iron to 15 feet on 12 and converted for another. At the par-five 14th, he two-putted for birdie from 35 feet, and a 25-foot birdie putt on 16 capped his run. 

Van Pelt posted a six-under 65 for 136. He carded a bogey-free round with three birdies on each side. Davis Love (69), Germanys Bernhard Langer (69), Tom Pernice (66) and Swedens Carl Pettersson (68) shared third on five-under.

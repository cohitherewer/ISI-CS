 ICC confirms Dubai shift

London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday confirmed moving its headquarters from London to Dubai in August this year, after finding operations in the England capital ?not in the best interests of its members?. 

ICC president Ehsan Mani also announced shifting of cricket?s governing body?s commercial and financial office in Monaco to the Gulf city. 

?Over recent years the ICC has operated from split headquarters, with the cricket administrative and anti-corruption elements in London and the commercial and financial operations in Monaco,? Mani said. (PTI)

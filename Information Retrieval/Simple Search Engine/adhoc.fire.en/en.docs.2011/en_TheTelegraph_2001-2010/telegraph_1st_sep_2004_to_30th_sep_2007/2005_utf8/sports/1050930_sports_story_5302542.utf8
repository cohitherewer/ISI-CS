 Nadal for Chennai

New Delhi: French Open champion Rafael Nadal will open his 2006 season at the $400,000 Chennai Open starting on January 2, organisers said on Thursday. 

The 19-year-old world No. 2 endured mixed fortunes in his last appearance in Chennai, losing his opening singles match before claiming the doubles title with fellow-Spaniard Tommy Robredo. 

The Chennai meet is a great event and the enthusiasm of the crowds is very encouraging, he said in a statement.

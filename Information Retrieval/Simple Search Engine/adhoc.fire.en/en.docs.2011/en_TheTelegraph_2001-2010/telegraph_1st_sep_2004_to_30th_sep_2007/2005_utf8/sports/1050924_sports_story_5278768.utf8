The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Drama over, but the show is on 

 - More-headed selection committee remains unchanged for time being 

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

Calcutta: The anticipation for something dramatic didnt materialise as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s annual general meeting was adjourned on Friday. The AGM will have to be reconvened before November 30. 

The reconvened AGM may not necessarily take place in Calcutta. For now, all the committees, including the selection committees, will continue. Nevertheless, it was another day spent amid hope and mounting tension. 

The following are excerpts from what the principal characters had to say: 

FAROOQ ABDULLAH: 

I am happy that a consensus (on an adjournment) has been reached, but not at all happy that two of the observers had to leave because of a court order. 

INDERJIT SINGH BINDRA: 

Its a good beginning and weve to build on it. Its nice that we have arrived at a consensus and that is important to bring about transparency in holding elections and in matters related to running the Board. Im happy with the developments. I hope the two months will be utilised in the same spirit we attended the meeting. 

JAGMOHAN DALMIYA: 

Theres no question of any moral victory. Whatever is happening is just not right? Court cases surrounding the BCCI is not the ideal situation and show bankruptcy of administration. 

To put a full stop to the process of acrimony, I had to execute the handbrake. Were back to square one? The meeting ended in the right spirit as Id been telling people to come together and discuss. What had happened in the last two days was not good for cricket. 

It is unfair to waste so much time and money. But we have arrived at something and it is a smart beginning. 

RAJ SINGH DUNGARPUR: 

The decision of adjourning the meeting was absolutely right. Mr Dalmiya proposed and our leader Mr Pawar agreed after consultations. We are not at a disadvantage after the AGM was adjourned as our voters are not commodities who can be bought. 

On Friday, our number was 19 out of 30 and by delaying the process, it can only go up as few others in their camp may get frustrated and fall back on us. Since two full days were wasted, all of us were tired and had prior commitments? we have to go back to our respective places. Some of our members have other engagements, which need to be met. So it was very sensible to defer the meeting for the time being. 

There should be no speculation on Mr Pawars presence in the next meeting. He will definitely take out another couple of days of his busy schedule and be at the meeting. Now we will go by the honourable court orders. 

RANBIR SINGH MAHENDRA:

 All matters of importance and the ones, which need immediate attention, were taken up today. The Challenger Trophy hosts have been asked to make their own arrangements regarding TV and sponsorship in case the Board failed to finalise them. 

It was also decided that TV subsidy would be distributed among the various associations within ten days. 

LALIT MODI: 

The move for adjournment came from Dalmiya as he wants to have control over the TV rights. 

SHARAD PAWAR: 

 I agreed to the meeting being adjourned because seven members had to leave Calcutta this evening. Three of them are booked on overseas flights Saturday morning. Moreover, all of us were tired at the end of the day. So? I dont foresee any problems if the AGM is held later on. 

Im totally against associations moving court to settle disputes. It shouldnt have happened last year also. 

I wanted N. Srinivasan in the marketing committee since he has been sidelined for long. At the same time, the members wanted me to be there, so I agreed grudgingly. 

I raised the issue regarding TV subsidy as the postponement would affect state associations. Mr Dalmiya then assured it would be distributed within the next 10 days. 

 I also requested him not to take any major financial decision before November 30.

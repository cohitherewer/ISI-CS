 Sourav has some years of cricket left: Jonty 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes feels that Sourav Ganguly still has some amount of cricket left in him. 

Sourav is a great player and I believe that he has still some years of cricket left in him, Rhodes said. 

Considered one of the worlds best fielder ever, Rhodes was of opinion that excluding Sourav from the ODI squad is a bit too harsh on him, though it was their (Indian thinktank) internal matter. He can come up with a brilliant match winning innings any day, Rhodes was frank in admitting. 

Rhodes is of the opinion that Souravs presence at this venue would have changed the atmosphere. 

Reverting back to the topic of the Indian team managements line of thought, the South African idol was straight forward. 

 I think they are experimenting a bit too much, but (Greg) Chappell has his way of thinking and he knows better what to do and what not to do, Rhodes remarked. 

Rhodes became nostalgic about the Eden when reminded of his playing days at this very ground. It is really a good experience to play at the Eden where one lakh people cheer when you hit a boundary or dive to prevent a boundary, he said. 

According to Rhodes, the Indian team has been playing really well in the recent past and the youngsters have really stood up to perform and earn India victories from difficult situations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Joint bid by Asias big four a certainty

 - 2011 WORLD CUP Host-issue not on ICCs June 28 annual general meeting agenda 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Captains of the 12 competing nations pose at Eden Gardens in the lead-up to the 1996 World Cup, the last time the tournament was hosted by Asia. The event was jointly staged by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka 

Calcutta: The impression that the 2011 World Cup host is going to be identified at the forthcoming AGM of the International Cricket Council (ICC) is wrong. 

In fact, the host-issue isnt even on the agenda of the last AGM at Lords, on June 28. Later this year, the ICC shifts base to glitzy Dubai. 

Its not scheduled to be discussed. Even if a member nation wishes to have it added, its too late now, ICC general manager (corporate affairs) Brendan McClements told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from London, on Tuesday afternoon, he added: As of now, the earliest that the host-issue can be discussed is next year? 

Given that the money (as also the biggest chunk of TV viewership) is in the sub-continent, a joint bid by all four Asian Test-playing nations ? India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh ? is certain. 

For India, the temptation to go it alone may surface, but political considerations (within the ICC) point only to a collective effort. 

 The 

 ICC Meetings 

 June 24, 25: Chief executives 

 meeting in London.

 June 26: Associate Members meeting in London.

 June 27: Executive Board meeting in London.

 June 28: AGM in London.

 June 29: IDI Board meeting in Dublin.

In 1987, India and Pakistan were the co-hosts; in 1996, the World Cup was jointly staged by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 

The ICC has sold the rights till the 2007 edition and the completion of that tournament, in the West Indies, will mean nine of the ten Test-playing nations (the exception being Bangladesh) have hosted the World Cup at least once. 

Theres talk that the one in 2011 be awarded to Australia-New Zealand as the others have staged/set to host the tournament after the two collaborated in 1992, but Asia is opposed to such a move. 

Its not insignificant that the Asian Cricket Council president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, has already gone on record questioning the push in favour of Australia-New Zealand. 

His point is Asia should have two slots in the so-called rotation policy, not one. The continent, after all, has four Test-playing nations. 

As important, pots of cash too.

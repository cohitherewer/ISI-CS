 Uppal sets up title clash with Bopanna

New Delhi: Vishal Uppal knocked out Karan Rastogi in the semi-finals of the mens singles of the State Bank of Saurashtra National Grasscourt Championships on Friday. 

Uppal beat the 19-year-old second seed 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to set up a clash with top seed Rohan Bopanna in the Rs. 8.36 lakh event. 

Bopanna blazed his way to a 6-1, 6-1 mauling of Vishnu Vardhan. 

Sanaa Bhambri staged a brilliant comeback from one set and 2-0 down but second seed Isha Lakhani, playing an event on grass for the first time, pulled her socks up in time to win 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 and move into the finals. 

Isha will play top seed Rushmi Chakravarthy who faced a stiff challenge from Punam Reddy before winning 6-4, 7-5. 

The semi-finals and finals were moved to the DLTA Complex. 

Except for the eighth game in the first set, where he made two doubles faults and touched the net while going for a smash to drop serve, Uppal was the better player. 

Rastogi was a victim of the new syndrome that has been bugging Indian tennis in recent times. This week last year, the teenager had ranked 1005 on the ATP list. His current ranking 356 makes him the fourth highest ranked Indian in the world and 170 places above his experienced rival. 

The Mumbaikar had also beat Bopanna and Harsh Mankad in the ABN Amro Tennis Challenge earlier this month to win a qualifying wild card to the indoor event in Rotterdam next season. 

But, like many upcoming youngsters, he was found wanting on grass. 

Rastogi tried to keep up with the former Davis Cupper but had no answers to Uppals serving variety or accurate returns. He tried to come up to the net and adapt, but was found inadequate as Uppal lobbed or passed him easily. 

Maybe I should have stuck to my game, but to play from the baseline was difficult. Maybe I should practice more on grass, play two-three weeks a year. With the Davis Cup (at home) being played on grass, it is worth it, Rastogi said after the match. (PTI)

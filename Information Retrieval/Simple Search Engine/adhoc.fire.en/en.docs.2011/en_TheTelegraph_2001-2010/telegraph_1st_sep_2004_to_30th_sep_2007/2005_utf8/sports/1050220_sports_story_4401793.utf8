Brussels: Top seed Amelie Mauresmo of France beat Australian Alicia Molik 6-3, 7-6 (7-2) on Saturday to reach the final of the Antwerp Open. She will meet Anastasia Myskina of Russia or Venus Williams. 

Mauresmo served 14 aces and dominated at the net against Molik who was slow to pick up pace. 

Venus, in the quarter finals, made light work of local favourite and former world number one Kim Clijsters. The third seeded American, seeking her third title in Antwerp, won 6-2, 6-3 to end the Belgian?s run in a tournament she entered to make her latest comeback from a serious wrist injury. 

?I did not play well,? said Clijsters, who had been sidelined since last October. ?But the most important thing to me was to have no trouble at all with my left wrist this week. And it was the case. I did not suffer from it at all. I am sure that my game will fall into place in the future.? 

Williams, however, was quick to praise Clijsters?s performance. ?I found Kim incredible. She is such a great competitor. But I know her game well and that was an advantage. It is so nice to see her again. It is hard to comeback ... I am sure that she will be her old self soon.? 

French Open champion Myskina was stretched in the first set of her quarter-final before overcoming unseeded Slovenian Katarina Srebotnik 7-6, 6-2 in the final match of Friday. 

Earlier, Mauresmo fought back to beat Switzerland?s Patty Schnyder 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the quarters. 

World No. 2 Mauresmo started sluggishly but eventually imposed her power-based game on Schnyder, sealing victory on her second match point with a volley that the Swiss could only net. 

Fourth seed Molik was an impressive winner over Koukalova. A single break was enough for her to clinch the first set and she was quickly 5-1 up in the second. 

Koukalova fought back to 5-4 before Molik wrapped up victory on serve.

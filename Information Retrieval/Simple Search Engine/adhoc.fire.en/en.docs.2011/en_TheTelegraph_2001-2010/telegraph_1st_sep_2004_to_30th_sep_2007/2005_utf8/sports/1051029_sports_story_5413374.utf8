The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A captains voice is stronger if he himself delivers

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE - Former Pakistan skipper and coach Intikhab Alam 

 on what makes leaders tick 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mohali: Former Pakistan 

 captain and coach Intikhab Alam is back in Punjab for his 

 second season as the states chief coach. His debut, 

 in 2004-05, saw Punjab reach the Ranji final. This time, 

 he is focussing on the districts and expects the state to 

 produce quite a few Internationals in the next couple of 

 years. Intikhab spoke to The Telegraph in his suite 

 at the beautiful PCA Stadiums Club House here on Friday 

 morning.

 Following are excerpts

 On who will start favourites 

 in the Pakistan versus England series

 England. For two reasons: After 

 the Ashes, their confidence is high and, then, we havent 

 played international cricket since June... Frankly, our 

 best chance is for Shoaib Akhtar to effect early dismissals. 

 Otherwise, baat nahin banegi.

 On the England team

 Its balanced 

 and they bat deep. Half the job is done when the balance 

 is spot-on.

 On Pakistans problem 

 area

 The opening 

 combination. In fact, Ive lost count of the number 

 of pairs tried out by coach Bob Woolmer. Such uncertainty 

 at the very top is never encouraging. Also, I cant 

 understand why Inzy (Inzamam-ul Haq) is reluctant to bat 

 at No. 3. Hes best suited for that position and can 

 control the innings from there.

 On Mushtaq Ahmed being pulled 

 out of the wilderness

 A nice move 

 and Im looking forward to seeing two leggies (the 

 other being Danish Kaneria) bowl in tandem. The Englishmen 

 are, as you know, vulnerable against leg-spin.

 On Imran Khan being unhappy 

 with Pakistanis themselves accepting that England start 

 favourites

 Look, as a Pakistani, 

 I would like our team to win. However, one must be realistic. 

 I believe confidence wins more matches than ability and 

 Englands confidence is high.

 On whether the series is actually 

 going to be a contest between Woolmer and Duncan Fletcher

 No... Their 

 role will be limited unless somebody has plotted an ambush. 

 At best, a coach is expected to put the pieces in place 

 on the equivalent of a chess board. The captain takes over 

 from there.

 On Michael Vaughans captaincy

 He doesnt 

 get flustered and handled the pressure situations in the 

 Ashes very well. Hes respected by teammates and, given 

 that he himself performs, is able to speak with greater 

 authority. A captains voice is stronger if he himself 

 delivers. Problems arise when, over a period of time, a 

 captain doesnt perform.

 On Inzamam as captain

 Under pressure, 

 there have been moments when he has looked not being fully 

 there, but he led well in India earlier this year... Im 

 sure he has learnt a lot from that one trip alone and, in 

 time, we may look back on that series as being the defining 

 moment for his captaincy.

 On Fletcher

 Obviously, hes 

 a terrific man manager. At the highest level, a coachs 

 role is largely to manage the dressing room and get the 

 best out of his players... Fletcher talks little, but is 

 effective where it matters.

 On Woolmer

 Ive got 

 nothing against the nationality of a coach, but Woolmers 

 failure to identify the most suited opening combination 

 is disappointing... Theres a limit to experimenting... 

 Moreover, it seems he has a problem with Shoaib.

 On Shoaib

 I really cant 

 put a finger on whats wrong, but it appears he has 

 a problem with both the coach and the captain... Egos have 

 come into play, lekin mulk ke liye pehle sochna chahiye. 

 I met Shoaib in Pakistan recently and he insisted fitness 

 wasnt an issue.

 On Shoaib being unhappy at 

 being asked by Woolmer to shorten his run-up

 Shoaib needs 

 a long run-up to get into rhythm... Woolmer shouldnt 

 have asked him to cut it down... A coach has to understand 

 what makes his players comfortable.

 On whether he had a one-on-one 

 with Shoaib

 (Laughs) 

 I did and I suggested that he not be bothered by the criticism 

 in the Media and elsewhere and simply concentrate on taking 

 wickets. I impressed upon him that the best way of silencing 

 critics was to perform.

 On Sourav Ganguly losing the 

 Team India captaincy

 (After a 

 pause) His record speaks for itself, but I understand 

 form became an issue. Then, it didnt help that he 

 confirmed having been asked to step down by the coach (Greg 

 Chappell) in Zimbabwe... Such things must never get out 

 of the dressing room... That and the leaked e-mail took 

 things to such a situation that one had to go... As Ive 

 said, a captains voice gets stronger if he himself 

 performs... From what Ive heard, John Wright would 

 compromise... Chappell isnt the sort to do so.

 On whether the coach should 

 be the boss

 No, a strong 

 captain is needed... A captain cant keep running to 

 the coach when things get out of hand... He has to think... 

 Out in the middle, he alone has to review strategy...

 On whether Imran, with whom 

 he had a successful partnership, would be the finest captain 

 of the last 25 years

 This is a tough one? Perhaps, 

 I would go for Imran and Steve Waugh. Both were leaders, 

 not merely captains.

 Finally, on whether Punjab 

 is going to do one better than last season

 Of course, Im 

 hopeful. However, the BCCI must schedule the Ranji semis 

 and final in such a way that the dates dont clash 

 with international commitments... I knew I wouldnt 

 have Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh) and Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) for 

 most of the season, but I even lost my captain ? Dinesh 

 Mongia... The countrys premier tournament has to be 

 accorded top priority. Incidentally, the BCCI should look 

 at reviewing the points structure. Points must only be given 

 for wins and a bonus awarded for winning by an innings. 

 Also, all Ranji matches ought to be played over five days 

 ? captaincy skills will be tested as also the temperament 

 of batsmen. Additionally, spinners are going to be a force.

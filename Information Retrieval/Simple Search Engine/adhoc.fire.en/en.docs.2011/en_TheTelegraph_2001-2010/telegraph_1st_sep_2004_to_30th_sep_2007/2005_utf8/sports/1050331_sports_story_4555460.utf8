 Anand homing in on 4th title

 - MONACO CHESS 

 Anand cruised past Van Wely 

Monaco: Viswanathan Anand cruised past Dutch Grandmaster Loek van Wely with a 1.5-0.5 victory in the ninth round of the Amber blindfold and rapid chess meet now underway here at Monte Carlo Grand. 

Winning his blindfold game and drawing the rapid, Anand is now almost assured of his fourth title, after taking his lead to whopping three points with just two rounds remaining in this unique event. 

The Indian ace now needs just 1.5 points in the remaining four rounds for his fourth solo title, played on a round robin basis with one blindfold and one rapid game in each round. 

With his seventh victory in the nine mini-matches here so far, Anand also stepped closer to victory in all the three events ? rapid, blindfold and combined ? which he continued to lead solely after the ninth round. 

Anand now has 13.5 points under his belt and the closest rival is last year?s joint-winner Alexander Morozevich of Russia, who is three points behind. 

In joint third spot are Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, Peter Leko of Hungary and former Russian champion Peter Svidler, with 10 points each in their kitty. 

In the blindfold, Anand continues to enjoy a lead of 1.5 points over Morozevich and Francisco Pons Vallejo of Spain, while in the rapid section, the Indian GM stretched his lead to a full point following favourable results in other games. (PTI)

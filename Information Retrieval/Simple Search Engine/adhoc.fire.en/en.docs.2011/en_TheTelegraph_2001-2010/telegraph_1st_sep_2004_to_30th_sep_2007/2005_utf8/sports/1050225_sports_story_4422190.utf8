 Bangla fans oppose move

Dhaka: Several cricket fans held a noisy protest in the capital on Thursday against a government decision to shift a historic venue. 

The government has moved the venue to Sher-e-Bangla Stadium at Mirpur 10 kms from the Bangabandhu National Stadium at the heart of the capital. 

?All Test and one-day Internationals will now be played at Sher-e-Bangla Stadium,? an official of the Bangladesh sports council said.

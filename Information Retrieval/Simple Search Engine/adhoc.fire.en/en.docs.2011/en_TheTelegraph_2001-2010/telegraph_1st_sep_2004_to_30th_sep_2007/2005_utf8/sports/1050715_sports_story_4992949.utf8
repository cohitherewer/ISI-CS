The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Viral attack puts Sachin on return flight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sachin (seen observing activity at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday) probably contacted the fever from son Arjun 

Bangalore: Even though coach Greg Chappell wanted Sachin Tendulkar to only attend the first two days of the final camp for the Team India probables, which got underway Wednesday, the former captain himself intended staying till the end ? July 19. 

However, a severe viral attack is forcing Sachin to leave for Mumbai on Friday morning itself. 

Ive been struggling for the past two days... I would have remained, but Im in bad shape, he told The Telegraph late on Thursday. 

In any case recovering from elbow surgery, Sachin added: My son (Arjun) recently had a similar attack and, it seems, Ive caught it from him... 

Despite being unwell, the maestro hasnt stayed put in his hotel room. In fact, he even went to the Chinnaswamy for nets in the afternoon. Its another matter that heavy rain played spoilsport. 

Sachins comeback, at any level, is unlikely to be before October.

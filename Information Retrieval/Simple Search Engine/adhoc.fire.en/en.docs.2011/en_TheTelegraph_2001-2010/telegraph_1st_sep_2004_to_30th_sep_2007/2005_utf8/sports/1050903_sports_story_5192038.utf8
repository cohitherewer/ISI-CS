 Soma Biswas

Calcutta: When Sushmita Singha Roy clinched the heptathlon title in last months National Combined Championships in Chennai, many in the athletics fraternity thought the time had finally come for Soma Biswas to pass on the legacy to the new champion. 

But the lanky 28-year-old athlete never let anybody peep into her mind. On Friday, we finally got a glimpse of her fighting spirit when Soma pipped Sushmita to the gold at the Asian Athletics Championships. 

It was not the best of her performances but certainly a timely statement that the champion in her is not going to die soon. After all, this is her first international medal since her 4x400 gold and heptathlon silver at the Busan Asian Games. 

I needed this win to prove myself, an elated Soma told The Telegraph from Incheon City on Friday. 

I was not performing well this season... it was frustrating, but I also knew a win was around the corner. Thank God, it came today finally, and its hugely satisfying the Bengal girl said. 

Soma, however, admitted that after Thursdays progress she was doubtful about her chances in the event. In the hurdles I finished at the last place and in the high jump, I only managed 1.59m. Sushmita came second after the first days action. So when I started afresh today, I had to pocket maximum points from my strong fortes like long jump and 800m, she revealed. 

Incidentally, both the Bengal girls shared the same room in the Incheon City hotel and it was Somas tips that eventually helped Sushmita return with the silver. 

Sushmita agreed: The way she came from behind and claimed gold was a great learning experience for every aspiring heptathlete. It was a great experience sharing the top-two places on the podium with her.

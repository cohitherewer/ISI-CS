 IOC move for Kim expulsion

Turin: The IOC?s executive board has decided to urge members to expel vice-president Kim Un-yong ? jailed in South Korea after being found guilty on corruption charges. The vote will be taken at the IOC session in Singapore in July. It needs two-thirds of the 120-odd members to back the call to throw out the 74-year-old. 

The executive board accepted the ethics commission?s decision that Kim had ?seriously tarnished the reputation of the Olympic movement.? 

Late last month Kim?s daughter Helen wrote a personal plea to IOC president Jacques Rogge, claiming that the guilty findings against her father in Korea were a travesty of justice. 

Last month the Korean supreme court turned down Kim?s last appeal against the guilty verdict. 

?I urge you and your associates to consider the matter very carefully and ? in fairness ? act to maintain Dr Kim?s standing in the IOC. To do otherwise would pile one more injustice upon those which he has already suffered, not just to the discredit of Dr Kim but to the IOC itself,? wrote Helen Kim. 

But the plea failed to move the executive board which was unanimous in its decision to accept the ethics commission?s report calling for Kim?s expulsion. 

Shortly before the Korean supreme court verdict, Kim issued a statement denying all the charges. ?I affirm my innocence of all charges... The charges were baseless and politically motivated,? he wrote. 

Rogge and his executive board know they are taking a major gamble in attempting to expel Kim.

 Seven golfing queries for new year

 Vijai Singh has to start from scratch 

Kapalua (Hawaii): Everyone anticipates a blockbuster season on the PGA tour. 

Vijai Singh starts the year at No. 1 for the first time in his career. 

?You?ve just got to get in front as quick as possible and see if you can stay there. That?s the way I?ve always thought, and hopefully I?m going to start that way again,? Singh said this week. And that leads to seven questions about the 2005 season: 

 What does Singh do for an encore? 

Singh is curious how he will handle the expectations, although they won?t be as great as when Woods tried to follow up on his nine-win season of 2000. Odds are against him winning nine times again, although if he plays the same schedule there is no reason he can?t win a half-dozen times. 

 Was the end of the year a mirage for Tiger? 

Woods gained renewed optimism by winning his final two tournaments of the year with a game that looked vaguely familiar. Still, no one will take the Dunlop Phoenix (Japan) or the target world challenge (silly season) too seriously. Still, it was enough to raise expectations. 

The real test will be the Majors. If Woods fails to win the masters, it will be the longest stretch without a Major in his career. 

 Will the Majors haunt the big easy? 

Ernie Els will remember 2004 as the year the majors got away all four of them. He may have found the secret to getting sharp for the four biggest weeks of the year, but four close calls in one year creates a lot of scar tissue. His best bet might be the PGA championship at Baltusrol, which should feel like a US Open. 

 What will Mickelson do next? 

That 20-centimetre vertical leap at national is a vivid reminder that Phil Mickelson no longer is the best player to never win a Major. Still, his magical year ended after the PGA meet. Memories being short, he?ll probably have to prove himself again. 

 Will anyone in their 20s emerge as a star? 

Australian Adam Scott became the youngest winner (23) of the players championship, but the best bet is Sergio Garcia. He already has won five times on tour and, unlike Scott, is becoming a regular contender in the Majors. 

 What about the old guys? 

Tom Kite once advised Jay Haas to keep playing on the PGA Tour as long as he could, because once someone goes to the Champions Tour, it?s hard to go back to regular golf. Haas has made the tour championship the last two years, and at 51 will be trying to make the Presidents Cup team. 

 Can Tim Finchem work magic on another TV deal? 

No one will be pulling harder for Woods than the PGA Tour Commissioner, who will start negotiating the next television contract this year. It?s all about timing. And the tour is positioned to provide some drama that will have everyone watching. (AP)

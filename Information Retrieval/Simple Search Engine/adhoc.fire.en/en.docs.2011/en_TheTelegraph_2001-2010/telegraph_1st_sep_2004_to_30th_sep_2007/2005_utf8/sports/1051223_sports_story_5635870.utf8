The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 If Sourav is selected, I wont have a problem 

Calcutta: Raj Singh Dungarpur, the manager-designate for the forthcoming tour of Pakistan, said on Thursday that he would welcome Sourav Ganguly if he was picked in the Team India squad. 

[That Dungarpur, a known Sourav-baiter, was set to go as manager was reported by The Telegraph on Wednesday.] 

I cant say whether he (Sourav) will be in the team. Its for the selectors to decide. But if he is selected, I wont have a problem. I will welcome him in the team, Dungarpur maintained. 

Dungarpur, it may be recalled, supported the selectors decision to keep the former Team India captain out of the squad for the Ahmedabad Test. He also insisted that it was not proper for BCCI president Sharad Pawar to intervene in selection matters. 

I did say that presidential intervention in selection matters is wrong. But then Sharad Pawar has made it clear that it was for the selectors to choose the team and he will not intervene, Dungarpur, himself a former BCCI president, said. 

Dungarpur informed that Pawar himself had told him that he would be the Team India manager of the Pakistan-bound squad. 

On Virender Sehwags captaincy in the Ahmedabad Test, Dungarpur said: He is not an experienced captain. But he handled the team well. And I must also say that this side is so good, so cohesive that the captains job is not that difficult. 

He added that both the coach and captain should have voting rights in selection committee meetings. 

The Test squad will be picked in Mumbai on Saturday and indications are that Sourav is going to make it.

 New York: Former US Masters champion George Archer, considered one of the best putters in the games history, has died after a year-long battle with lymphoma.

 American Archer, who won the 1969 Masters by a stroke, was 65.

 A 12-time winner on the PGA Tour, Archer died at his home in Incline Village, Nevada, on Sunday.

 At six feet 5-1/2 inches (1.98 metres), he became the tallest player to win the Masters by holding off the challenge of Billy Casper, George Knudson and Tom Weiskopf at Augusta National in 1969.

 His daughter, Elizabeth, became the first female caddie in Masters history when she carried his bag at the 1983 tournament.

 Chennai: India went down to Japan 17-25, 23-25, 34-36 in the semi-finals of the 13th Asian Senior Men?s Volleyball Championship in Thailand on Monday. Though the Indians lost the first set, they bounced back in the second, taking the fight to the rival camp in the third, which they were leading initially before losing it and the match. Earlier, on Sunday, the Indian men created history when they stormed into the semi-finals for the first time in the 30-year history of the championship.

 Belgrade: Greece beat Germany 78-62 on Sunday to clinch the gold medal and their second European Basketball Championship title. Roared on by more than 10,000 fans who made the trip to Belgrade, the 1987 winners sank a tired-looking German team with a barrage of three-pointers and rock solid defence, forcing their rivals to commit 21 turnovers.

 Guard Theodoros Papaloukas was instrumental with 22 points for Greece. He scored eight points in a row, including two long-range efforts behind the arc, to give his side a 50-36 lead early in the third period.

 Earlier, France crushed Spain 98-68 to claim third place.

 Frankfurt: Matthias Sammer has turned down an offer to coach Bayer Leverkusen and instead plans a study tour of Europe.

 ?The offer from Leverkusen was an honour,? Sammer told a German paper. ?I really considered it but it came too soon after the Stuttgart situation.?

 Sammer lost his job as Stuttgart coach at the end of last season after the club drifted out of the Champions League places to finish fifth. He was favourite to take over at Leverkusen following the dismissal of Klaus Augenthaler on September 16 but wants to hone his coaching skills before taking on another job.

 Rio de Janeiro: Corinthians fired coach Marcio Bittencourt on Sunday despite moving into second place in the Brazilian championship with a 3-1 win away at Flamengo.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Odds favour home assignment

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: For the fifth time in six years, India have advanced to the penultimate stage in their quest to rejoin the World Group of the Davis Cup. The last time they were part of the elite group of 16 was way back in 1997 but have, since then, come across heavyweight hurdles in the play-off stage and tripped. 

The draw for the World Group play-off round takes place at ITF?s London office on Tuesday and it goes without saying that Leander Paes? team will be pitted against another strong outfit. The prayer on Indian tennis fans? lips is: let us at least be ?blessed? with a home tie ? unlike the last five times when we had to play in Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, the US and Australia. 

Nothing but the luck factor will decide India?s September 23-25 opponents but the chances of playing at ho me are more than 50 per cent. As one of the unseeded zonal qualifiers, India will be drawn against one of the eight seeded teams, most of whom were humbled in this year?s first-round World Group play. This list includes the US, Sweden, Spain, Czech Republic and Austria ? all of whom will have to visit India if they draw Paes amp; Co. 

Italy, a zonal winner, is another candidate to make the seedings list and they are also due to travel to India. The three countries India must ?avoid? to ensure a home assignment are Switzerland, Chile and Germany. So till Tuesday, fingers crossed.

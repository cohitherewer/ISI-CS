The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Malik has hurt himself in the long run too

 - The allrounder will have to carry the stigma of a captain who conspired to beat his own team 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Shoaib Malik 

New Delhi: In the lead-up to the tour of India, allrounder Shoaib Malik was talked about as the next vice-captain, replacing Yousuf Youhana. Obviously, he was also seen as being suitable for the captaincy at some point in time. 

The vice-captaincy, though, went to Younis Khan largely because confusion over Maliks off-spin didnt make him a certainty for the three-Test series. 

As it turned out, the 23-year-old didnt figure in any of the Test XIs, but played a handsome hand in Pakistans remarkable 4-2 win in the ODIs. 

Younis, for his part, was outstanding in the Tests and contributed in the ODIs as well. That meant he wouldnt just keep the vice-captaincy (for the West Indies), but actually even become a firm contender for the seat occupied by Inzamam-ul Haq. 

Of course, only when the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and its selectors decided to look beyond Inzamam. 

If Younis India-show hurt Maliks long-term prospects, his own despicable Twenty20 performance a fortnight or so ago ? stonewalling so that his team (Sialkot Stallions) lost to Karachi Zebras ? has ensured the PCB wont ever look at him for any position of responsibility. 

Sadly, Malik has felled himself? Whatever the level of the game, no captain can kill his teams chances, is what somebody closely connected with cricket in Pakistan told The Telegraph. 

Following the International Cricket Councils Code of Conduct, the PCB banned Malik for one Test (the first in the West Indies), but he will have to carry the stigma of a captain who conspired to beat his own team. 

Malik didnt throw the match to oblige bookies ? in an act of revenge, he wanted to knock Lahore Eagles out of the inaugural competition ? but, then, that wasnt cricket. 

Surely, Malik is going to regret much more when possibly players with less of a cricket mind get into the captaincy-frame.

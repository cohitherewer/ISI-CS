The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nadal expects a complicated match

 - MENS FINAL - Unseeded Puerta hopes to do a Gaudio 

Paris: Rafael Nadals furious charge towards his first Grand Slam title will reach a successful conclusion on Sunday if he beats Argentine Mariano Puerta in the French Open final. 

The powerful Spanish left-hander pummelled world No. 1 Roger Federer 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 on his 19th birthday on Friday and will start as clear favourite to lift the trophy at his first attempt. 

If Nadal overcomes the unseeded Puerta, he will become the first man to be crowned champion on debut at Roland Garros since Swede Mats Wilander in 1982. 

Three consecutive claycourt titles in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Rome marked Nadal as the pre-tournament favourite. 

Far from being a weight on his broad shoulders, however, the Mallorcan has revelled in the spotlight, dropping only two sets on way to the final. 

After beating Federer he oozed confidence, realising this is where he belonged. 

I dont think Ill be especially nervous on the day of the final, Nadal said. True, Ive never been in a final of a Grand Slam, but Ive played lots of finals this year. Then the Davis Cup final last year, you cant get any more pressure than that. 

Puerta will be difficult, hes been playing very good tennis to get in the final. It will be a very complicated match and Ill have to play my best tennis if I am to win. 

Puerta, also a left-hander, will prove a tough adversary for Nadal. 

The 26-year-old Argentine, who 10 months ago was ranked 440th in the world after completing a nine-month ban for failing a drugs test, comes from the mould of classical south American claycourt specialists. 

Like Nadal, he owns a huge top-spin forehand. Similarly, Puerta competes for every point as if his life depends on it. 

With Nadal it will be a big battle, were both left-handers, we both have the same sort of strokes, said Puerta, who names 1977 champion Guillermo Vilas as his inspiration. 

Were both going to arrive at the final with huge self-confidence, its going to be a good match to play. 

Puerta will be hoping to emulate last years champion Gaston Gaudio, who also came through unseeded to lift the title. (Reuters)

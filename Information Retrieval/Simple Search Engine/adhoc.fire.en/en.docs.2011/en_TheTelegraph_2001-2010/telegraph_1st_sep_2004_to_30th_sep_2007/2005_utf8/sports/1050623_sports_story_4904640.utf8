 Canas in doping net

Buenos Aires: World No. 8 Guillermo Canas has told Argentine media that he is being investigated by the ATP over a positive doping test. 

Canas, in an interview published by local papers, said he was pulling out of the Davis Cup tie against Australia next month because of the investigation. He said he was innocent. 

Im being investigated by the ATP for doping, he told a daily, adding that ATP rules had stopped him from speaking on the matter before. 

Ive been over everything Ive taken with my team and there is nothing that is prohibited. I trust the system. I hope its a mistake and nothing more. 

Ive never looked to take anything extra or anything which isnt permitted to gain an advantage in tennis, added Canas who has also withdrawn from Wimbledon. 

Both newspapers said that the alleged positive test happened during the Acapulco ATP tournament in February in Mexico. The ATP said on Wednesday it could not confirm or deny the test. 

Ive kept quiet for a long time because the ATP didnt allow me to speak. I dont know how the rumours started... Now, Ive got chance to speak and I want people to know from my own mouth. (Reuters)

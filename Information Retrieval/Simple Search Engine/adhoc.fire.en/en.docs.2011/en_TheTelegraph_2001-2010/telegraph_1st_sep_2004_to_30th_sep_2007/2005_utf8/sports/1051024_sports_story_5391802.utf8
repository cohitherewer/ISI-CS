 Nadal battles to title

 - Madrid masters Paes-Zimonjic comes second best yet again 

 Rafael Nadal reacts during the final on Sunday 

Madrid: World number two Rafael Nadal staged a heroic fightback from two sets down to clinch his fourth Masters title of the year with a thrilling 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 victory over Ivan Ljubicic in Madrid on Sunday. 

The 19-year old Spaniard appeared to be on the brink of defeat when he trailed the in-form Croatian and struggled to hold his own serve. 

But the top seed, roared on by a 10,000 strong crowd, turned the tide to claim a famous victory. 

It was an incredibly difficult victory, an ecstatic Nadal said. 

The only reason why I can explain that I managed to turn the game around was the support of the fans here in Madrid. 

They have 80 per cent of the responsibility for the victory. 

Nadals victory meant he equalled world number one Roger Federers feat of winning 11 ATP titles this season. The pair have also mopped up all eight of this years Masters Series crowns. 

Leander Paes and Nenad Zimonjic came out second-best for the second straight week when they lost in the final of the Madrid Masters on Sunday. Paes and Zimonjic made a brilliant start against third seeds Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor before losing 6-3, 3-6, 2-6. 

Knowles (Bahamas) and Nestor (Canada), one of the most successful teams of the last two seasons, thus retained their Madrid title. 

The Indo-Serbian pair, which won two titles on claycourt earlier this season, had tripped at the final hurdle last week in Stockholm when they lost to Ausssies Paul Hanley and Wayne Arthurs. 

Meanwhile, top seed Lindsay Davenport defeated Switzerlands Patty Schnyder 7-6, 6-3 to win the Zurich Open on Sunday. 

The Americans tally put her in second place this year, behind the eight titles of Belgian Kim Clijsters. Sundays victory is her third tournament win in six weeks after triumphs in Bali and Filderstadt. 

Davenports victory also continued her remarkable run at this event. She has now claimed four Zurich titles and in her six appearances has never failed to reach the final.

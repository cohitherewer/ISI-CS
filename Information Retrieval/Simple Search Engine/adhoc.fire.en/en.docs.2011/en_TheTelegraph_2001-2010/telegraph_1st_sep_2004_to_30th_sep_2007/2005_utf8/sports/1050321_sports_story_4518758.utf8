 Tactical error cost Pak, says Imran

Karachi: Former captain Imran Khan on Sunday said Pakistan lost the Eden Test because they made the ?tactical blunder? of playing an extra seamer, besides lacking technical capabilities in batting. 

?I think they made a tactical blunder when they played an extra seamer instead of off-spinner Arshad Khan. If Mohammed Khalil had been an outstanding bowler, they would have been justified. But playing three seamers in hot and humid conditions was a tactical error,? Imran said after Pakistan lost the second Test by 195 runs. 

?By technical capabilities, I mean Pakistan batsmen lack proper defensive technique that brings consistency,? he said. 

?India won the Test because they played with a better combination. But we need to understand that the hosts are a better and more experienced side than Pakistan and the result should not upset us.?

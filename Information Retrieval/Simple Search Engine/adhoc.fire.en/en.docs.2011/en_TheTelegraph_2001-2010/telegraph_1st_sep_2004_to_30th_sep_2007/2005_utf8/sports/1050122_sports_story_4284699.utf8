 Vijay likely to rule 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh?s Aleksei and 

Approved are the two highly-rated horses who are expected to lift their respective 

events ? the Indian Champagne Stakes and the Indian Champion Cup ? on Saturday.

 In his last run, Aleksei was left to do a lot in the home stretch after his jockey C. Alford failed to settle the Razeen- Remembren son early in the race.

Approved, on the other hand, is in great form. A winner 

of four ?handicap? races from five starts, the Excalibur?s Lake-Our Fantasy son 

has also brushed shoulders with the top Classic contenders in the 1,600m Guineas. 

However, Approved being more comfortable over middle distances, he may have the 

measure of Moon Emperor ? a mile specialist. C. Alford partners both ? Aleksei 

and Approved.

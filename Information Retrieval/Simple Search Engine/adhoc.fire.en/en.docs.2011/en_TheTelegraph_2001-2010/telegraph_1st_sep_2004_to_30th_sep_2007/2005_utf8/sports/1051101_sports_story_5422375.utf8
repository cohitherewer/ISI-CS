 Pettersson claims maiden title

Toronto: Swedens Carl Pettersson battled his way to an even-par 71 to beat American Chad Campbell by one stroke at the Chrysler Championship in Tampa Bay on Sunday to claim his maiden PGA Tour win. 

The 28-year-old from Gothenburg held his nerve to sink a tricky four-foot par putt at the last for a nine-under total of 275. 

Pettersson, who collected a first prize of $954,000 plus a new car, became the 12th first-time winner on the Tour this season, and the third in as many weeks following Lucas Glover (Funai Classic) and Wes Short Jr (Las Vegas Championship). 

Its fantastic, Pettersson told reporters after becoming the third Swede to triumph on the tour. 

Pettersson began the day tied for the lead with American Steve Lowery and played steadily, carding one birdie and one bogey while most of his challengers faltered. 

Lowerys hopes of registering his first victory in five years disappeared after a triple bogey at the par-three eighth. 

He eventually returned a closing four-over 75 to finish in a seven-way tie for third place.

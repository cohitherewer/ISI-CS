 Langer falls one short of century 

Adelaide: West Indian batsman Brian Lara broke Allan Borders world record for the most Test runs on Saturday on a dramatic Day II of the third and final Test ended with Australian opener Justin Langer dismissed for 99. 

Lara finished with 226 in the West Indian first innings total of 405 to pass Borders long-standing record of 11,174 runs in Test cricket. 

Australia reached 229 for three at close of play, with Langer falling one short of a hundred. 

Langer looked certain to register his 23rd Test hundred as he cruised to 99. He was stayed on the score for 20 minutes before gloving a catch to keeper Ramdin Denesh. 

Langer had shared a 131-run partnership with skipper Ricky Ponting. 

When play ended, Australia were 176 runs behind with Brad Hodge unbeaten on 13 and Mike Hussey yet to score. 

Lara passed Borders record in the first half hour of play. He became the first player since Gary Sobers to simultaneously hold the world record for most Test runs and highest Test score (400 not out).

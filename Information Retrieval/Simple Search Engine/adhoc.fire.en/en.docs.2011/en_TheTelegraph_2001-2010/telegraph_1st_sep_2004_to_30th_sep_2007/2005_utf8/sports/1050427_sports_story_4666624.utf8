 Sami doubtful after surgery

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Sami is doubtful for next month?s tour of the West Indies after having surgery to remove a cyst in his right heel. 

?Sami had the operation on Monday night and has been advised two-and-a-half to three weeks? rest before he is cleared to start bowling again,? Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director of cricket affairs Saleem Altaf said on Tuesday. 

?Right now we are not sure if he would be fit in time to be considered for the West Indies tour,? he added. 

The 24-year-old Sami took 10 wickets in the recent three-Test series in India and four in the one-day Internationals before breaking down in the fourth match with the heel injury. 

Pakistan are due to play three one-day Internationals and two Tests in the West Indies, with the first ODI on May 18. 

The squad will be finalised after reports on the fitness of pace bowlers Shoaib Akhtar, Shabbir Ahmed and Umar Gul, who have all been out injured.

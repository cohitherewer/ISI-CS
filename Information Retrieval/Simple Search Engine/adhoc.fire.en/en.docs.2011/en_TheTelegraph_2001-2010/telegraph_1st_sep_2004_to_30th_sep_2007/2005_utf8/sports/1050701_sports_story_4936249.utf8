 India move into second round

 - JR HOCKEY Korea upset Spain 3-1 

Rotterdam: Defending champions India clung to a slender lead and posted a 3-2 win over Poland to advance to the second round of the junior World Cup on a rain-swept evening here Thursday. 

The Indians revelled in the bitingly cold conditions to chalk up their second straight win in pool D while the Poles, who had lost 0-6 to the Netherlands Wednesday, will now have to beat Egypt on Saturday to advance. Indias next game is on Saturday against the Dutch with Friday being a rest day. 

Goals by Hari Prasad (22nd), Birendra Lakra (43rd) and Sandeep Singh (56th) helped India to keep their nose in front in the face of a spirited challenge by Poland for whom Krol Szyplik converted two penalty corners in the 37th and 66th. 

India were the better team on the days showing as they displayed good combination in the midfield and attack, although at the finish, they wasted a few chances. They wove an intricate web around the Polish team with a mix of short and long passes, while the individual skills of the Indians earned them a round of applause. 

Earlier, Korea and Pakistan scored hard fought victories in their respective league matches to join Australia in the second round. 

Korea authored the tournaments biggest upset by scoring a 3-1 win over Spain, the overwhelming favourites and ranked No.1 among the 16 participating nations. 

It was Koreas second consecutive win in pool A following their 11-0 drubbing of Mexico Wednesday. The defeat notwithstanding, Spain, who beat England 1-0 Wednesday night, are certain to qualify for the next round as they have to play lowly Mexico on Saturday and are expected to win comfortably. 

Meanwhile, Pakistans struggle to find their form and rhythm continued as they scored an unimpressive 2-1 win over Chile for their second success in pool C following their 3-1 result against Belgium Wednesday. 

 Australia recorded their second consecutive win in pool C beating Belgium 7-1. (PTI)

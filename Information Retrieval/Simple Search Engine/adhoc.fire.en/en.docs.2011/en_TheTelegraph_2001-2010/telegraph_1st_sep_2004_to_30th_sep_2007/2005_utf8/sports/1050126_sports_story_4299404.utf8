 New Delhi: India?s top squash player Ritwik Bhattacharya continued his fine run in the satellite circuit winning his fourth PSA title at the Rochester Pro-Am championship in New York.

 The Indian defeated Englishman Sam Miller 11-8, 11-9, 9-11, 12-10 in the final on Sunday to claim his second title in a fortnight, according to a statement issued by his sponsors JCT Limited.

 Ritwik had won his third PSA title in Barcelona, while his earlier two titles came in August 2003 when he won two tournaments in consecutive weeks in New Zealand.

 London: English champions Arsenal have been fined ?10,000 by the Football Association (FA) here after admitting using an unlicensed agent in the transfer of teenage striker Quincy Owusu-Abeyie from Ajax. 

 Arsenal received a warning as to its future conduct and was given a suspended transfer ban.

 The ban has been suspended for a period of two years from February 1, 2005, and will be ?activated in the event of a further proven breach of the players? agents regulations before Fifa or the Football Association?, said an FA statement on Monday.

 Owusu-Abeyie, now 18, arrived at Highbury in 2002. However, he is yet to play in the Premier League.

 Milan: Former Italy coach Dino Zoff has ended a spell of over three years out of the game by taking over at Serie A club Fiorentina. Zoff has been out of the game since he was sacked as Lazio coach in September 2001.

 Fiorentina said in a statement on Monday that 62-year-old Zoff had replaced Sergio Buso and would take immediate charge of the side for Wednesday?s Italian Cup quarter final against AS Roma.

 Zoff, captain of Italy?s 1982 World Cup winning team, becomes Fiorentina?s third coach of the season after Buso replaced the sacked Emiliano Mondonico in October.

 Milan: AC Milan won five of the nine honours handed out at Italy?s annual player?s association awards ceremony.

 Brazil midfielder Kaka, who scored 10 goals in his first season in the Serie A and directed the team?s attack, won both the overall best player award for 2004 and top foreigner honours.

 Other members of the defending champions honoured were captain Paolo Maldini for best defender, Carlo Ancelotti in the coaching category and striker Andriy Shevchenko for the best goal of 2004, scored against Parma last January.

 The awards are voted on by all of the players in Italy?s top division.

 London: Arsenal defender Kolo Toure was charged with violent conduct by the FA on Tuesday following a clash with Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer during Sunday?s Premier League match at Highbury.

 In an incident missed by the referee but shown repeatedly on television, the Ivory Coast international appeared to bring his elbow down on Shearer?s back.

 Under the FA?s new fast track disciplinary system, Toure is required to respond to the charge by 1800 GMT on Wednesday.

 If he accepts the charge, the automatic penalty is a three-match suspension with immediate effect. If he denies the charge, the case will be heard at a disciplinary commission on January 27.

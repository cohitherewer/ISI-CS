The Telegraph - Calcutta

 WI no worry for Aussies

Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting says the world champions are paying little attention to ICC Champions Trophy winners West Indies ahead of Friday?s triangular one-day series opener between the two sides. 

?We are not really worried too much about opposition teams, or focus too much on them,? Ponting told a news conference at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday. 

?If we look after our own skills and plans tomorrow, then everything should fall into place.? Ponting led his country to World Cup glory in March 2003 and two months later Australia beat West Indies in a one-day tournament in the Caribbean. 

?The last time we played them, we won the first four games of the seven-game series and they won the last three,? said Ponting. ?Their batting in particular is very dangerous.... their big problem has been their bowling.? 

The Australian skipper said Michael Clarke had recovered from a foot injury and was likely to open the batting with Adam Gilchrist in the absence of Matthew Hayden, who has been rested.

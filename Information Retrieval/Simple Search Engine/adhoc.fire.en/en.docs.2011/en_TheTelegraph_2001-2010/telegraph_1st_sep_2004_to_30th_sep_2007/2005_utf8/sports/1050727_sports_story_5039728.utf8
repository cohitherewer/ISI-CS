 Al Habib fancied on last day 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: The 1,200m Narmada Plate, here on Wednesday, the concluding day of the season, may provide a keen finish as each of the eight runners has a fair chance of landing the spoils. However, the two who have the edge at weights are Al Habib and Speed Mistress.

 Both horses are in good form and it is the G. Sandhu-ward Al Habib, with M. Reuben in the saddle, who is tipped to win.

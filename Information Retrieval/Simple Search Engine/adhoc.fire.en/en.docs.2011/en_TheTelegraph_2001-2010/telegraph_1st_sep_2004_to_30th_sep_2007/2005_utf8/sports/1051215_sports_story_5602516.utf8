 Kallis hopeful of playing

Sydney: South Africas Jacques Kallis is still hopeful of playing in the first Test against Australia starting in Perth on Friday despite being troubled by an elbow injury. 

A team spokesman said the allrounder would be given right up until the start of the match to prove his fitness despite lingering concerns about the injury. 

The worlds number one ranked batsman sustained the injury in India recently and missed all three warm-up matches in Australia. 

He joined his teammates in a practice session at the WACA nets on Wednesday but was restricted to a few overs of medium pace bowling and did not bat. Australia opening batsman Matthew Hayden said it would be disappointing for both teams if Kallis was ruled out. 

Its obviously a huge loss if Kallis doesnt play, and a huge loss for our competition as well because its great to play him, Hayden told reporters on Wednesday. 

Hes been in super form over a long period of time now and were looking forward to facing the challenge of Kallis. 

Australia are overwhelming favourites to win the opening Test but Hayden said the world champions were wary about the dangers posed by South Africas fast bowlers on the notoriously bouncy WACA pitch. 

Hayden, who has made four centuries and an unbeaten 87 in his past five Tests, regards the South African attack as their best in a decade. 

I really rate them highly, Hayden said. We are going to have our work cut out. 

Its just an opportunity for us to really baton down the hatches in a lot of ways. 

Hayden also dismissed concerns about South Africas scratchy form in their warm-up games, of which they won just one. 

Theres a different intensity to a tour game to what there is in a Test match. I expect them to come out firing on all cylinders come the first day of the Test match here, Hayden said. 

Having the experience of playing out here as well is a good one for them. It is a game of adjustment here so theyll be more experienced for that opportunity. (Reuters)

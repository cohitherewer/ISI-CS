 Vijay, Richard strike it rich 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: As expected, trainers Vijay Singh and Richard Alford called the shots in Fridays six-event race card. The two professionals picked up five events between themselves with Vijay taking the lions share, including the two trophy events ? the 1,400m Hilliard Cup and the Legal Steps Cup over 1,200 metres. Jockey C.Alford was associated with all of Vijays winners.

 The piping-hot favourite Romantic Liaison opened Vijays account in the Hilliard Cup which the Classic aspirant won the way she liked. 

 Another of Vijays strongly fancied runner, Serrafina, was, however, fully stretched by stablemate Exclusive Affair in the other trophy event. 

 Stables highly rated debutante, Magical Romance, too, was severely tested by Wild Flowers in the Lomabrd Handicap. The well-bred Razeen-Cedar Point filly led comfortably from the start but she survived the threatening challenge from Daniel Davids ward.

 Daniels Renegade, however, won the Quincy Handicap, and also spoiled Richards chances of landing a treble when the three-year-old managed to stop Over The Rainbow from winning.

 Ridden by Shane Domingo, Richards Arrayal and Serengetti, nevertheless, returned comfortable winners in their respective events. Serengetti opened up a long lead and maintained it till the winning post. In her last run, when ridden by Rutherford Alford, he had come to a grinding halt which led to the jockeys suspension.

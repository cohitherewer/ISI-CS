The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dalmiya clear frontrunner

 - CAB elections

 Contest likely for one of the joint secretarys posts 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya appears clear favourite to be re-elected as president of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) at its annual general meeting on Wednesday. Dinesh Vajpai is contesting Dalmiya. 

For the two joint secretarys posts, Amitava Banerjee of the ruling faction is sure to have a cakewalk while Saradindu Pal will face stiff competition from Samar Paul. Pal queered his pitch recently after reportedly admitting to his role in match-fixing in local cricket. 

The CAB has 121 affiliated units. Polls will not be needed for the four posts of vice-presidents. 

Match-fixing, in fact, is one of the issues the Vajpai camp has been harping on. The former city police commissioner and director general of police feels this issue-based campaign will pay rich dividends. 

I am confident we will garner sufficient votes to get elected. A lot of people from various walks of life have pledged their support. 

The Dalmiya camp showed commendable restraint in not getting involved in a slanging match. I dont want to say anything. This is not a political affair, elections to a sports body should not be a war of words, Dalmiya said. 

Dalmiya also did not wish to get involved in the controversy surrounding Vajpais nomination as raised by Indian Hockey Federation vice-president Narinder Batra. 

I can only say that as per CAB rules, Vajpai is eligible to contest, he said. 

Vajpai felt the Dalmiya camps no comment on the issues raised by him are a positive sign. The fact that they are not answering (to these issues) is a clear indication that they are conceding their mistakes, he remarked. 

The AGM begins at 6 pm.

 Both Dalmiya, Pawar camps confident

Calcutta: The BCCI AGM remained shrouded in an air of suspense on the eve of the elections on Monday, but both the ruling and rival camps sounded upbeat about their chances. 

If the build-up to the elections had indicated a swing in favour of the Sharad Pawar group, the scenario changed dramatically on Monday when four of the five disputed cases were ruled in favour of the Dalmiya camp by the Supreme Court-appointed observer T.S. Krishnamuthy. 

When asked if he still held the view that the opposition camp was weak in mathematics, Dalmiya nodded smilingly and said: We are full of confidence and youll see tomorrow (Tuesday) how much of it gets transferred to the elections. 

Former BCCI president and key Pawar-backer Inderjit Singh Bindra has taken such turnarounds in his stride. This is the umpires decision and well follow it, Bindra said calmly. 

The numbers are with us, Bindra stated calmly. 

Last time we had 15 votes and this time around we are expecting three more ? Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra, Bindra claimed. 

Dalmiya, meanwhile, had a strong reservation against the authorisation given to Rajendra Zar as representative of Himachal Pradedsh Cricket Association. 

Stating that he was satisfied with the voters list, Dalmiya added: But one person has been given voting right whom we have not seen attending any AGM before? hes unknown to the board. 

 Sharad Pawar, seen checking 

 into a city hotel on Monday night, said the BCCI polls 

 would be free and fair this time under the supervision 

 of observer T.S. Krishnamurthy. Last year, Pawar said, 

 the umpiring wasn't fair. Pictures by Santosh

He also didnt rule out the possibility of taking up the matter on December 12, the date set by the Supreme Court to hear the election process. 

The Pawar camp, on the other hand, is not contemplating any legal action about the decision to cancel Bihar Cricket Associations representation in the elections. 

We are absolutely sure that were going to win the elections. After that we will settle such contentious issues among ourselves, Bindra announced. 

Dalmiya, incidentally, hailed the system of coming out with a voters list a day before the elections as a healthy precedence. 

For 75 years, the BCCI has been running with a system and I dont know if anything was wrong with it. But since we have come to this (new system), let us make a new beginning. 

Asked to comment about the observers views on the ambiguity over the presidents voting power, Dalmiya said such matters should be referred to the Supreme Court during its hearing of the election process.

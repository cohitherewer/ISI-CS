 Aussie coach calls for unity

Kuala Lumpur: Australian coach Barry Dancer has called for unity in his squad for this weeks Sultan Azlan Shah Cup in Malaysia following the recent sacking of top player Troy Elder. 

Elder was suspended by Hockey Australia for 12 months for choosing to stay with his Dutch club Orange and Black instead of playing in Kuala Lumpur, where the Kookaburras are defending champions. 

Elder played a key role in helping Australia to the Olympic gold in Athens last year and his absence has raised a few eyebrows among the 18-strong squad, who kick off their campaign against hosts Malaysia on Thursday. 

It is a potentially divisive issue, Dancer said before arriving in Kuala Lumpur. 

There is potential for the group to be divided between players and management because it is about the interests of an individual player versus the national squads interests. 

We will discuss it fully. We have to work out a strategy to make sure we dont have more problems. 

The seven-team tournament features Australia, India, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa playing a round-robin format with the top two teams contesting the final on June 5 at the National Hockey Stadium. 

The Australian squad includes 11 players who played in Athens. Making their debuts are David Guest, Eli Matheson and Luke Doerner, the latter along with Jamie Dwyer excused themselves from their Dutch clubs to play in the tournament. 

We are giving these three players a chance so they can get some international exposure with an eye on the Champions Trophy in Chennai (this December), said Dancer on Tuesday. 

Last years runners-up Pakistan have also lost an influential player to Dutch club hockey. Sohail Abbas, who has scored 278 international goals, was excluded from the Pakistani squad for failing to attend training sessions. 

Abbas retired last year but said he would be available for selected tournaments. But Pakistani officials insisted he attend training sessions with the rest of the squad. 

Pakistan will be captained by 28-year-old Mohammad Saqlain, who was dropped for the Olympics on disciplinary grounds, but who has since matured. (AFP)

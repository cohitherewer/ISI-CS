 BCCI marketing committee to meet tomorrow 

Thiruvananthapuram: An emergency meeting of the marketing committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will be held in Mumbai on Saturday. 

Apart from the BCCI office-bearers, Arun Jaitley, I. S. Bindra and Jagmohan Dalmiya are expected to participate in the meeting. Union minister Sharad Pawar and N. Srinivasan, who were inducted into the committee at the adjourned Calcutta AGM last month, are also expected to take part. 

However, Srinivasan is currently abroad and sources in Chennai said he would return only on October 19. 

The Delhi high court had, on August 22, issued notices to the centre and the BCCI on Zee Telefilms petition, seeking quashing of BCCIs invitation to tender for telecast and broadcast rights for the next four years, alleging that the eligibility conditions were framed to oust Indian bidders. The Board assured the Delhi high court on August 31 that it would not decide on bids for grant of cricket telecast and broadcast rights in India for the next four years till September 8, when the hearing on Zees petition challenging the eligibility conditions would resume. 

On October 4, a division bench comprising acting Chief Justice B. A. Khan and Justice M. B. Lokur which allowed BCCI to open the technical bids to decide the eligibility of the bidders including Zee, asked the Board not to disclose the outcome. (PTI)

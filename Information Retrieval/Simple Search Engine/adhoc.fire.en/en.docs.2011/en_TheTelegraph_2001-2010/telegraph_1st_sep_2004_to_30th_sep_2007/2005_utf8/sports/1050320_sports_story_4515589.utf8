Wellington: Damien Martyn completed his 12th Test century on Saturday to put Australia in control of the second Test against New Zealand. 

Martyn scored an unbeaten 106 and shared an unbroken 90-run partnership with Adam Gilchrist to guide Australia to 337 for five in their first innings when play ended on Day II. 

Gilchrist finished the day on 45 from 47 balls and is eyeing another big score after his blazing first century in the first game. 

With the first day washed out due to rain, the Australians were keen to make up for lost time after being sent in to bat by Stephen Fleming. 

?We?ve shown before that we can tough it out, and Gilly?s there now which makes it easier to post a big score tomorrow and then try bowl them out,? Martyn said. 

?There was definitely something there for their bowlers and luck probably didn?t go their way today. 

?A couple of catches went down and we played and missed a lot. It could easily have been a different day.? 

Opener Justin Langer struck six boundaries in a quickfire 46 to get the innings off to a flying start. Matthew Hayden (61) then kept the scoreboard ticking with his 20th Test half-century. 

New Zealand briefly pegged Australia back with three quick wickets after lunch but Martyn put the visitors back in control with his hundred.Martyn, who scored six Test centuries last year, was on 24 at tea before he accelerated his scoring in the final session, bringing up his century off 173 balls with his 16th boundary. 

Martyn shared an 84-run stand with Simon Katich who made 35 then 90 with Gilchrist who helped himself to seven fours and a six as the Australians piled on 163 runs in the last session. 

The New Zealand bowlers failed to make the most of the conditions after getting first chance to bowl on a wicket that had been covered for two days. 

Left-arm seamer James Franklin captured two wickets but the pick of the bunch was left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori, who took two for 74 from 29 overs. 

?There was plenty in the wicket and we are disappointed,? Vettori said. 

?We had a number of chances, then after the second session we were very happy with our position... but we let it slip a little too easily.? 

Vettori made the breakthrough before lunch when he had Langer caught behind with the total on 82 and then claimed Australian skipper Ricky Ponting for nine after the re-start, trapping him leg before wicket with a ball that straightened. 

Hayden, who was unusually cautious, passed his 50 after lunch but fell with the total on 146 when he hit an easy catch to Lou Vincent at cover, giving Franklin his first success. 

Michael Clarke was also subdued, making eight off 32 balls, before he was caught in the slips off Nathan Astle before tea. Franklin dismissed Katich after tea, but that was New Zealand?s last positive note of the day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhupathi all praise for Sania

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

Calcutta: In between blazing Steffi Graf-like forehand winners, Sania Mirza missed some elementary shots at the net and netted a few overheads which made her look silly at the Armstrong Stadium court on Wednesday afternoon (New York time). She seemed to be hit by a lack of consistency. 

But, as Mahesh Bhupathi pointed out, she achieved the most important thing: win the second-round match Italian Maria Elena Camerin. 

I was watching the match from the stands, I can tell you the conditions were very, very tough out there, Bhupathi told The Telegraph on Thursday. Winds were blowing at 50mph, it wasnt at all easy to control shots. 

 One must remember this is her first US Open and there are bound to be some nerves, she must have felt them some time or the other. 

Despite all that, she battled hard both days and came through. Shes handled the pressure really, really well. Thats where I give her credit. 

Its not just on-court pressure Bhupathi is talking about. Everyone in New York seems to be talking about her... the American people, the American media and, of course, the Indians here, he said.Besides being featured prominently in two leading local dailies, Sania was adjudged player of the day (Wednesday) by the official website. 

Like Sania, Bhupathi is loathe to look ahead to a possible clash with Maria Sharapova in the round-of-16. 

Let her get past the next hurdle first? (Marion) Bartoli is a tough customer, she was in the top-20 a few months ago, Bhupathi remarked. 

He didnt sound bothered by some minor injuries Sania was bothered by. I think she can handle that. 

Bhupathi didnt agree that playing doubles was an unwise idea for Sania. I believe its always makes sense for singles players to play doubles? for instance, instead of practising today (Thursday), she will play a doubles match which will sharpen her up for the third round singles, was Bhupathis argument.

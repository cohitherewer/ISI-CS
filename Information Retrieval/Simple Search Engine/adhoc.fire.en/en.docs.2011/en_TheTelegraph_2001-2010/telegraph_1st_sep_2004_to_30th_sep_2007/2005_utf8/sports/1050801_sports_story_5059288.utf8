 England name unchanged squad 

London: England named an unchanged 12-man squad on Sunday to face Australia in the second Ashes Test starting at Edgbaston, Birmingham on Thursday. 

Michael Vaughans side trail the five-match series 0-1 after losing by 239 runs at Lords. 

The selectors met on the Monday after the Lords Test and looked at the way we played and identified the obvious plus points including bowling Australia out twice, (Stephen) Harmisons bowling, and (Kevin) Pietersens batting, said England chairman of selectors David Graveney. 

Australia have won the last eight Ashes series.

 Harikrishna among leaders

Pamplona (Spain): Grandmaster P. Harikrishna scored a thumping victory over Andorran GM Oscar de la Vira Aguado to emerge joint leader after the second round of the 15th Ciudad De Pamplona international chess tournament here. 

After an exciting draw with Dutch GM Jan Timman in the first round, Harikrishna, playing black, had his task cut against Aguado and he performed in exemplary fashion to win in just 27 moves. 

The second day of the 8-player category-16 round-robin event also provided more sparks than the first round since as many as three out of four games ended decisively compared to only one in the previous round. 

Ending up as winners were former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine who defeated Izoria Zviad of Georgia and Laurent Fressinet of France who defeated Timman. 

The other game of the day was drawn after Ivan Cheparinov of Bulgaria failed to press home his advantage against Sergei Tivakov of Holland. 

In view of these results, Harikrishna emerged joint leader along with Cheparinov, Fressinet and Ponomariov on 1.5 points each. Tiviakov was on fifth spot with one point while Zviad and Timman had half a point apiece. It was Aguados second loss in as many games. 

Harikrishnas success against Aguado came easy. The Caro Kann defence is a recent addition in Harikrishnas now-wide repertoire and it came good when Aguado overestimated his position in the ensuing middle game arising out of an advance variation. 

Harikrishna was quick to pounce on an opportunity to win a sacrificed pawn and thereafter no matter how Aguado worked on his counter-play bid, the Indian always had the right answers. The queens got traded on the 24th move and just three moves later Harikrishna won another pawn to force resignation. 

Ponomariov was extremely impressive in handing Zviad a stunning defeat in another Caro Kann defence of the day wherein the former played white. 

Playing the classical system, the Ukrainian sacrificed a pawn early in the middle game to get a huge lead in development and slowly exerted pressure along the centre to gobble an extra pawn in return. The game lasted 35 moves. 

Fressinet was in his tactical elements against Timman who employed the reti opening as white. The Frenchman sacrificed a pawn temporarily on the queen side in the middle game to open files and got heavy dividends when Timman overlooked a piece sacrifice resulting in a lost endgame for him. Fressinet won after 43 moves.

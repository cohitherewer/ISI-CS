 London: Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes revealed on Sunday that she may have to quit athletics in three weeks? time because of a recurring achilles injury.

 The 35-year-old Briton, who won the 800m and 1,500m at the Athens Olympics, had planned to retire after the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next March.

 But she is struggling to overcome an achilles tendon injury and is ready to call it a day if there is not sufficient improvement when she has further scans next month. ?I have another MRI scan in three weeks? time,? Holmes said on Sunday. ?It might say it has nearly healed, but if it shows that we cant get rid of the injury and that it needs an operation, then it?s not worth thinking about the Commonwealth Games.

 ?You are just putting pressure on yourself, spending all your time on the physio bed and I have had enough of that.?

Calcutta: Having barely managed to save relegation from the Ranji Trophy Elite group, Bengal will now hope to perform better when they face Jharkhand in their opening East Zone National one-dayers, at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. 

While the hosts will be able to field a full-strength side, there?s doubt in the opposition camp on whether Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be fit to wear the big gloves. 

?Dhoni will surely play tomorrow but if he is found unfit, he will play as a batsman while Subrata Ghosh will ?keep,? captain Sumit Panda said on the eve of the match. 

Bengal are planning to go in with two left-arm spinners and two medium pacers. 

?We will pick either of the two from Anirban Chatterjee, Murtaza Lodhgar and Sourashish Lahiri in the final XI,? Karsan Ghavri told The Telegraph on Monday. 

But, according to a team source, offie Lahiri may have sit out as the opponent has a number of right handers in their line-up. 

Subhomoy Das is likely to partner Arindam Das at the top of the batting order for the hosts. Captain Devang Gandhi will come at No. 3 followed by ex-captain Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Deep Dasgupta and Sanjib Sanyal. 

Meanwhile, the visitors seem to be in no tension and will hope to spring a surprise on their fancied opponents. 

?I was not in good touch at the start of the season but I came back to form in the last match versus Himachal Pradesh. I hope to carry on that form in the one-dayers,? said Panda, who had earlier played for Bengal. 

 TEAMS 

Bengal (likely): Subhomoy Das, Arindam Das, Devang Gandhi, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sanjib Sanyal, Deep Dasgupta, Anirban Chatterjee, Murtaza Lodhgar, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul. 

Jharkhand (from): Manish Vardhan, Subrata Ghosh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sumit Panda, Rajeev Raja, Manish Kumar, C.M. Ojha, Mihir Diwakar, Shahbaz Nadeem, Shahid Khan, Anshuman Raj, Santosh Lal, Pramod Kumar, S.S. Rao, Kundan Kumar.

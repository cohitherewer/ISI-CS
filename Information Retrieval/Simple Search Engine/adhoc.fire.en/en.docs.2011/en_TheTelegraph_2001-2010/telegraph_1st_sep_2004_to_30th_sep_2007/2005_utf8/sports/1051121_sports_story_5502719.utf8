 Jeev fails to make cut

Florida: Jeev Milkha Singh ended his four-day campaign in the USPGA qualifying school second stage with the weeks best card of two-under 70, but that still left him five short of the last qualifying spot at Bayonet Club Golf Course. 

Jeev had five birdies, one bogey and a double bogey in his fourth round. 

He scored 76, 73, 75 and 70 for a total of 294 to end tied 33rd. His final round of 70 was the best in the field, matched by six others. 

Asian Tours Lin Wen-Tang of Chinese Taipei overcame the tension of a last hole bogey as he grabbed one of the 19 spots at Oak Valley Golf Course. 

Lin had rounds of 73, 74, 69 and 73 and was right on the cut line at one-over which tied for 14th with five other players. 

The top 35 and ties will get full PGA Tour cards for 2006. 

Also at Bayonet Golf Course, Charlie Wi, who has won many tournaments on the Asian Tour, missed out narrowly on a place in the next stage, as he bogeyed twice on the back nine. 

Also crashing out was former Asian Tour No.1 Thongchai Jaidee at Lake Jovita. His final round of three-under 69 went in vain, as he ended tied 47 after rounds of 76, 73, 71 and 69. (PTI)

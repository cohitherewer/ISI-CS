 Sania can revolutionise Asian tennis, says Krajicek

New Delhi: Former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek said on Friday that Sania Mirza can trigger an Asian revolution in tennis with the sport looking to grow beyond its traditional base. 

Yes, Asia can be a new, big market for tennis. What you need is a start. Someone like Sania can provide that local start, then the game can become big, said the Dutchman. 

Sania can help other players. She has just turned 19, and has already reached No. 31. Everyone needs a role model, needs someone to look up to. Sania can provide that. 

Krajicek, the only Dutchman to win at the All England Club, said tennis in Europe did not enjoy the corporate support it did a few years ago, and that the growing economies of Asia like India and China could provide the game that support. 

Krajicek was in city to promote the $15,000 ABN Amro Tennis Challenge mens event to be played here on December 3-4. 

He felt Roger Federer has an edge over Pete Sampras. Federer probably is better than Sampras, but you cant really compare, Krajicek said. Federer has an all-round game while Sampras was a big serve-and-volleyer and had a great second serve. (PTI)

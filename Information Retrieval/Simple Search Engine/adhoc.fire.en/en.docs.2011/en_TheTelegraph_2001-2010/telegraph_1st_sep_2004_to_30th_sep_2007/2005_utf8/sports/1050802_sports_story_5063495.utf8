 Montreal: The Melbourne 

 Park Centre Court, venue for the Australian Open, will be 

 transformed into a swimming pool to stage the 2007 Fina 

 World Championships, organisers said on Sunday. 

 The 12th World Championships was originally scheduled 

 to take place at Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre, built 

 for next years Commonwealth Games, but organisers 

 have decided to switch the venue to the Rod Laver Arena. 

 Victorian state sports minister 

 Justin Madden said the tennis centre could accommodate 12,500 

 spectators, 2,500 more than the aquatic centre which will 

 instead be used for diving and water polo. (Reuters)

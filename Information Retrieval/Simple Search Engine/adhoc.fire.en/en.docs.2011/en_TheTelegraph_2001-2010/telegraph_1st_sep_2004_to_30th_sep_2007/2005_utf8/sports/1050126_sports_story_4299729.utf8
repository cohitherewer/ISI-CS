 ?Elegance? for Derby 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: Full Speed and Forever Elegance may battle it out for the 2,400m Poonawalla Bangalore Derby here on Wednesday. 

 If Full Speed served notice of his credentials with two wins over shorter Classics ? the Guineas (Mysore and Bangalore), Forever Elegance walks into the reckoning following her 2,400m Oaks victory after she claimed the 1,000 Guineas. 

 Both are in the pink of health and stand way above their rivals in the 11-horse field. However, the one who is given preference to land the spoils is Forever Elegance, the S. Ganapathy-ward whose dazzling turn of foot helped her win the two Classics. B. Prakash partners the Placerville-Salute Her daughter.

 Off to another record yellow jersey

 - 2005 Tour de france begins today: Armstrong will be riding for seventh title

Challans (France): Look, Lance Armstrong says, he is not riding the 2005 Tour de France to finish second. 

If his enthusiasm for racing 2,226 miles over 22 days did not start burning hot until this spring, if his training has been less lengthy, if he seems distracted from the painfully boring matters of weighing his food by the ounce, of rising at dawn to ride hills over and over, of living an ascetic life devoted to wearing a bright, yellow jersey on July 24, it doesnt mean Armstrong is vulnerable. 

Hopefully, Ill go out with a victory, leaving the impression perhaps that I can do another one if I really wanted to, he said. Im not concerned about the impression I leave with others or with the media but for my own good, for whatever reason, I would like to leave that impression with myself. 

It is with a different motivation that Armstrong begins this Tour with Saturdays 11-mile time trial between Fromentine and Noirmoutier-en-Ille on the Atlantic coast. 

The 33-year-old Texan and father of three announced in April that he would retire after finishing this Tour de France on July 24. He already owns a record that most cycling experts expect to stand for decades: winning six consecutive Tours. If he wins a seventh it will be special for another reason. 

My kids werent there last year, a real bummer for me, Armstrong said. They will be there this year and they are old enough to understand what dad does for a living. They understand that when I put the bike clothes on, Im going to work. 

So for them to come over here, its to come to my office. I would love for them to see me in the yellow jersey and that alone is plenty of motivation. 

When I left home my son said, When will I see you again? I said, Hopefully when Im wearing the yellow shirt. And Luke said, Dont you get to wear what you want to wear? Yeah, I guess during the last few years sometimes. I want them to see dad in the yellow jersey one last time. 

Armstrong piled most of his serious training into the last three months. He hasnt won anything ? no races, no stages ? and even rode to assist young teammate Tom Danielson during the final days of the Tour de Georgia. 

He has adjusted to a new team. Discovery Channel took over sponsorship from United States Postal Service of the only US team that competes internationally. The teams uniforms are no longer red, white and blue but more blue, grey and white. And two stalwart members of last years USPS squad, American Floyd Landis and Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov, are missing. Landis defected to Swiss team Phonak and is considered a possible Armstrong challenger. Ekimov, Eki as he is known, is injured and sitting out Armstrongs final ride. 

 Armstrong showed up Thursday for a news conference sporting a cut above his right eyebrow and a nasty red streak of road rash on his arm, courtesy of a training crash last week near Nice. 

It wasnt serious, Armstrong said. It was a silly crash I cant even begin to describe, at a low speed. The unfortunate thing was that I hit my head and cracked my helmet in two. I went out straight over the handle bars. 

Before the 2003 Tour, where Armstrong struggled throughout and won over Jan Ullrich by little more than 60 seconds, he also had a serious crash at the Dauphine, a Tour warm-up race. 

It was in 2003 that Armstrong also was bothered when the race progressed in severe heat. Another heat wave has kept temperatures around 90 degrees lately in many parts of France. 

Theres a big difference, Armstrong said. The Dauphine crash really affected the way I felt on my bike, the way I pedalled. Along the back of my spine it did not feel normal after that. I feel just as fluid as I was before this crash. Its just an issue of road rash on my knees and hands. 

As for those who hope he will melt again in the heat, Armstrong had a prediction. 

I guess the scuttlebutt in cycling is that I dont like the heat, that I dont perform well in the heat and they all use 2003 as an example of that, said Armstrong, who was reared in steamy Dallas. 

But perhaps the heat is not as big a problem as people make it out to be. I gotta think growing up in heat hotter than this, spending my sporting career working out in heat like this, I dont think the heat will be something that will cause me to lose the Tour.

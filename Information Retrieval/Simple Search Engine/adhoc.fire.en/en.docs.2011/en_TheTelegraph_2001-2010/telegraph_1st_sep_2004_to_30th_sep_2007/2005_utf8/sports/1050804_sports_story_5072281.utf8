 Another bombing could end Ashes tour: Gillespie

Sydney: Australias cricket team could decide to abandon the Ashes tour if there are more terrorist bombings in England, fast bowler Jason Gillespie said in remarks reported Wednesday. 

If another bomb did go off here in England, there would be serious questions asked, I think, about the tour because I know a lot of the guys are quite nervous, Gillespie was quoted as telling a Melbourne radio station. 

A lot of guys have got their families and wives here and its not so much us, its them as well, he said. A full-time security consultant had been with the team. 

Gillespie said another bombing could be the final straw. If something else did happen, we (would have) to start questioning why we are here, he said. (AFP)

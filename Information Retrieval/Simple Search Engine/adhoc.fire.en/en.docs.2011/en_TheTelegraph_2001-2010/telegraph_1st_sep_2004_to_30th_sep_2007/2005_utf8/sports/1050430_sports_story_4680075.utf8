 Frankfurt: The German football association (DFB) banned referee Robert Hoyzer for life on Friday for his central role in the country?s biggest match-rigging scandal in over 30 years.

 Hoyzer has admitted fixing and attempting to fix a series of matches after receiving bribes of 67,000 euros ($86,590) from a betting gang.

 The DFB said that Hoyzer had agreed to the punishment, which will also prevent him from ever holding office at a club.

 The DFB this week dropped a call for a 50,000 euro ($64,620) fine for Hoyzer but on Friday the sport?s governing body in Germany said the former referee could yet face a civil claim for damages. 

 Rome: Juventus will play two friendly matches in Japan after the Serie A season has ended, the Turin club has announced.

 The 27-time Italian champions, who will receive a million euros for each game, will take on Yokohama F-Marinos at the Yokohama Stadium on June 1 before facing FC Tokyo at the Ajinomoto Stadium on June 7.

 Apart from the two matches in Japan, Juventus are also trying to arrange a match in Hong Kong on June 4. 

 Asuncion: Two weeks after Brazilian police arrested an Argentine player on the pitch for an alleged racial incident, the South American football confederation (CSF) said it opposed outside interference in the sport.

 Leandro Desabato, who plays for Argentine club Quilmes, was arrested after a Libertadores Cup match against Sao Paulo and held for 40 hours after being accused of racially insulting an opponent.

 ?The (CSF) emphasises a fundamental principal of the Fifa statutes and its own statutes,? it said in a statement. ?Events which take place in a sporting arena should be dealt with by the sporting authorities.?

 Rome: Juventus striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss his club?s Serie A title showdown with AC Milan next month after a two-match suspension was confirmed on Thursday.

 Juventus launched an appeal after the Sweden international was banned using television evidence. The cameras appeared to show Ibrahimovic elbowing Inter Milan?s Ivan Cordoba earlier this month. A Serie A disciplinary committee upheld the suspension. 

 Mumbai: Keeping in view the huge viewer interest in India?s Sania Mirza, TEN Sports has made special arrangements with the French tennis federation to ensure that all her matches would be shown live.

 This follows the signing by TEN Sports of a new multi-year agreement with the French federation, thus acquiring the exclusive rights of the French Open, a media release said on Friday. The French Open will be played from May 23 to June 5. 

 London: England fly-half Jonny Wilkinson has signed a new three-year contract with the Newcastle Falcons, the English Premiership club said on Thursday.

 Wilkinson, who has been with the Falcons since 1997, will make his first start against London Irish on Saturday since aggravating a knee injury on his comeback from shoulder problems on March 13. The 25-year-old is out to prove his fitness for a place on the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand.

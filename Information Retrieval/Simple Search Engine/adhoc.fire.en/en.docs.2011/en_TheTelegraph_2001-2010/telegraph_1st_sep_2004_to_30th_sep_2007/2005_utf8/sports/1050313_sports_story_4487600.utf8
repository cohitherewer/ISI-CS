 Stockholm: Anders Frisk has decided to retire immediately from refereeing following a number of threats aimed at him and his family, the Swedish news agency TT reported on Friday.

 ?I don?t want to go into the details, Anders will have to talk about that. But the threats have been serious enough,? said Bo Karlsson, chairman of Sweden?s football referees? association. ?We have spoken and I can confirm that he is quitting.?

 Frisk had been scheduled to referee the World Cup qualifying match between Estonia and Slovakia in Tallinn on March 26.

 The 1994 World Cup winner is the second high-profile Brazilian international coaxed to the club by owner Simon Clifford.

 Bengal scrape into quarters

 - SANTOSH TROPHY

 Maharashtra, Karnataka, TN and Goa also reach last eight 

Thiruvananthapuram: Twenty-nine-time champions Bengal entered the quarter finals of the 60th Santosh Trophy here on Wednesday despite being held 1-1 by Mizoram in a crucial cluster VIII match. Although both the teams have four points each, the former made it to the last eight riding on a better goal average. 

Though Bengal had the better of the exchanges, their forwards failed to convert the chances that came their way. Raman Vijayan netted in the 58th minute, booting home a Chandan Das throw from the left. P. C. Lalawmpuia of Mizoram equalled in the 74th minute. Bengal are placed in the group III quarter final league, along with Services and Maharashtra. 

In another match, Tamil Nadu held Jharkhand 1-1 in the three-team cluster V match. Tamil Nadu topped the cluster with six points, followed by Jharkhand on two points. The third team, Gujarat, lost the two matches that it played. 

Tamil Nadu had the better of the exchanges during the first half, but missed six chances. On the other hand, Jharkhand successfully converted the only chance that came their way in the 38th minute when Vimal Pariyars shot rebounded from the hands of Tamil Nadus goalkeeper Dougles Ponraju and Mirja Besra scored through a fine header. 

In the second half, Tamil Nadus James Singh, Kulothungan and Jegan fought to restore parity and the equaliser came in the 88th minute when Jegan scored. 

Earlier, Maharashtra blanked Orissa 4-0. 

Meanwhile in Kozhikode, formidable Goa also entered the quarter finals after registering a 10-0 demolition of Sikkim, their third straight win in cluster VII. 

The three-time champions have scored 33 goals in three matches without conceding any, and will now fancy their chances for the title. 

Assam and Uttar Pradesh have already qualified for the next round. 

Anthony Pereira started the scoring in the eighth minute off a Nickolas Rodrigues pass after Sikkim missed a golden opportunity to score in the opening minute when Bir Bahadur Singh misjudged a pass from Milan Lepcha. 

From then onwards, there was no looking back for the Goans as they netted goals at will scoring five in each half, including a hattrick from Climax Lawrence (36th, 45th and 85th) and a brace from Joaquim Abranches (66th, 83rd) ? who substituted Freddy Mascarenhas ? probably to give him sufficient rest ahead of the hectic schedule in Kochi. 

The 35-yard freekick from Rodrigues (32nd) was the most impressive of the goals scored. 

Even as Sikkims Anil Pradhan was booked for tackling Clifford Miranda five minutes before the breather, Steve Lepcha was red carded for slamming the ball at Miranda, who neatly hit the resultant penalty kick. 

Nicholau Borges (48th) smashed a cross from captain Samir Naik who himself came on to score one in the 76th. 

Meanwhile, former champion Maharashtra and Karnataka won their respective matches to advance to the quarter final on Wednesday.

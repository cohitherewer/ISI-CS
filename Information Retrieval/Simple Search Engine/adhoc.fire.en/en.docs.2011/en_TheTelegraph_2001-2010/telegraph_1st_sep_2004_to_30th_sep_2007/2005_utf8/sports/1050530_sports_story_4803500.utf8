 ICC clarifies okay as conditional 

London: Team India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has been given a conditional go-ahead to play in international cricket by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The decision is based on the report of bio-mechanist Mark Portus, who conducted a further analysis of Harbhajans action following a report by match officials during the recently concluded India-Pakistan series, an ICC press release said. 

That Harbhajan had been cleared by the ICC was confirmed by Ranbir Singh Mahendra on Saturday, but the BCCI president didnt say that the clearance was conditional. 

According to the release, Portus report had found out differences in Harbhajans actions during the match against Pakistan and that, analysed at the University of Western Australia in February. 

 However, Harbhajan has been given the go-ahead by ICC as Portus could not reach a conclusive decision because of differences in the footage quality and the camera angles. 

There is no doubt that the action analysed in Australia showed Harbhajan with an action that is in with accordance with the regulations, the release, quoting ICC general manager (cricket), David Richardson, said. 

The analysis of the action, used during the Pakistan match, identifies some differences including the position of the feet and the speed of the delivery. However, Portus was unable to reach a definitive conclusion on the action used against Pakistan because of the quality of the footage and the camera angles used, he said. 

On this basis, ICC has advised the BCCI that Harbhajan is able to bowl in international cricket provided his action is consistent with that used in the laboratory. 

Should his action deteriorate, it is possible that the Match Referees would again report him and this would raise the prospect of further bio-mechanical analysis. 

The off-spinner, who underwent corrective measures in late 1998, was reported in December after the second Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong and again in March in the second Test against Pakistan in Calcutta. 

It made Harbhajan the first bowler to be reported under ICCs new regulations dealing with suspect bowling actions. (PTI)

 Pressure is on England, says Warne

 Warne feels he is now bowling with more variety 

Southampton: Shane Warne has insisted it will be England who will be under pressure when the Ashes Series against Ricky Ponting?s Australian tourists gets underway in July. 

Australia have won the last eight Ashes Series dating back to 1989 and though England are now ranked second in the world, Michael Vaughan?s men will be outsiders to break the sequence. 

Legendary Australia leg-spinner Warne is already in England where he will captain Hampshire in the first division of the County Championship after helping them to promotion last season before joining the Ashes squad in July. 

?The pressure is on England. Everyone expects them to compete or to have a good Ashes and there are those who say they can win. I am sure England are up for the battle and we are looking forward to the competition. 

?I?ve heard people say before that it?s the best chance for England to win the Ashes, but there?s so much that can happen between now and then,? he also said at Hampshire?s Rose Bowl Base here Monday. 

?The best I ever bowled was in 1993 and 1998 before my operations but in the last three or four years I have been bowling with a far greater variety of deliveries,? he said. 

?Sometimes I even outsmart myself but if you look at my statistics the last 30 Tests have been the most successful of my career.

 Bowyer, Dyer face risk of criminal prosecution

 - Newcastle brawl a disgrace: Shearer

 Lee Bowyer has been fined six weeks? wages 

Newcastle teammates Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer face the risk of criminal prosecution following their mid-pitch fight, a shameful episode that the club?s chairman, Freddy Shepherd, said Sunday was responsible for the worst day of his chairmanship. 

Officers from Northumbria Police will Monday begin preliminary investigations into the bust-up between the two players. 

[The club fined Bowyer six weeks? wages on Monday for his part in the incident, but confirmed both players would remain at the club, adds a Reuters report from London. 

[In a statement Newcastle described the fine as the maximum allowed, estimated by local media to total around ?250,000, after the ugly incident minutes from the end of their 0-3 home defeat by Aston Villa at St James? Park. 

[Newcastle said it was the highest fine the club had ever handed out. 

[Former Leeds United and England midfielder Bowyer, 28, was also ?severely censured? and warned as to his future conduct for what the club described as ?his attack on Kieron Dyer.?] 

?Our officers will be liasing with the football club throughout the week to discuss the matter further and if they raise any issues we will review the situation,? Northumbria Police communications supervisor Martin Murray said. ?But at this moment no one has come forward to make an official complaint as regards the incident, that is any of the parties involved on the pitch or any third parties, and that could mean fans or witnesses.? 

In scenes unprecedented at St James? Park, Bowyer and Dyer were sent off by referee Barry Knight after fighting one another. They publicly apologised for their conduct in a televised post-match news conference as a damage-limitation exercise swung into action. 

?I couldn?t believe what my eyes were telling me; I never thought I would see two of our own players fighting each other,? Shepherd said. Without doubt it was the worst day of my chairmanship. 

The players face automatic three-match bans, which means they will miss the FA Cup semi-final with Manchester United at Cardiff?s Millennium Stadium a week on Sunday. 

The referee?s report will by studied by FA disciplinary officials at Soho Square and a misconduct charge could accompany the suspensions. 

Bowyer and Dyer, meanwhile, are no strangers to controversy. Bowyer was fined ?4,500 in 1996 for admitting affray at a McDonald?s in London and was cleared in a high-profile court case in 2001 after allegedly assaulting an Asian student in Leeds. 

He was once suspended for six games by Uefa for stamping on a Malaga player during his Leeds days. 

Dyer, a current England international, also has a string of minor misdemeanours to his credit and was once escorted to a police station by Souness for urinating in public. 

[Meanwhile, Newcastle captain Alan Shearer has described the brawl as ?a disgrace? that has dragged the club?s name through dirt, adds another report. 

[Shearer, who on Friday gave the club a boost by agreeing to play on for another season, told The Sun newspaper Monday: ?Once again the good name of Newcastle United is being dragged through the dirt. What happened was a disgrace to the name of Newcastle United and to our loyal supporters. There is no defence for it and I made my feelings known in the dressing room. Our dirty linen has been hung out for the country to witness yet again.?]

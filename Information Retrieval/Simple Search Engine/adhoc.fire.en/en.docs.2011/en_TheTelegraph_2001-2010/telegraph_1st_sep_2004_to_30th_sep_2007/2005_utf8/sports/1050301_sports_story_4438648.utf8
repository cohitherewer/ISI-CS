The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Central eye final berth

New Delhi: Following their drubbing at the hands of East Zone, Bangladesh would be hoping to restore some pride when they take on Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy league match here on Tuesday. 

The visitors, only the second international team after England A to participate in the domestic event, would be hoping to put up a much improved show in the next four days, though a win against their in-form opponents look most unlikely. 

On the other hand, Central can afford to play for a draw and book their berth in the finals to be played in Nagpur from March 8 as they have defeated East in their opening league encounter in Gwalior. 

The hosts would be missing the services of skipper Mohammed Kaif as he has been entrusted with the responsibility of leading the Board President?s XI against Pakistan in Dharamsala in a three-day tour match starting Thursday. 

In his absence, allrounder J.P. Yadav would lead the team which boasts the likes of Murali Kartik, Harvinder Singh and others. 

Bangladesh squad arrived in the capital Sunday morning and held a training session at the Karnail Singh Stadium while the Central Zone team members came together only this morning. (PTI)

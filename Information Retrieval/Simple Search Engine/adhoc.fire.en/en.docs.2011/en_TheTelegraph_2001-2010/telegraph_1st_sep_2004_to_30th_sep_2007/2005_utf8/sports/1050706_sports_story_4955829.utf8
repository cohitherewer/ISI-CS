 Australia in semis

Rotterdam: Australia became the first team to enter the semi-finals of the junior World Cup hockey tournament when they crushed four-time champions Germany 7-1 in a pool F league match Tuesday. 

With three wins and a draw, the Aussies have 10 points, followed by Argentina (8) Germany (6) and Pakistan (4). 

In a one-sided encounter, the Aussies, barring a brief spell in the second-half when the Germans applied pressure, were right on top against a team that appeared flat-footed in comparison. 

Using the long balls and one-touch moves, the Aussies ripped open the German defence after gaining the upper hand in the midfield.

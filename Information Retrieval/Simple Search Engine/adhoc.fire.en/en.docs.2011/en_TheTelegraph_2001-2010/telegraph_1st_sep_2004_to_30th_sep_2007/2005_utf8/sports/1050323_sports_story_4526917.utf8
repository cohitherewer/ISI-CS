 United want format changed

London: Manchester United would like the format of the Champions League changed to help more big name clubs survive into the last eight. 

United were knocked out in this month?s first knockout round by AC Milan and chief executive David Gill on Tuesday put forward the idea of a seeding system for the last 16. 

Gill said there would be discussions between clubs and Uefa, European soccer?s governing body, to see whether changes were necessary although he did not expect any for the next two years. 

?It?s not good for the big clubs, not good for TV and sponsors if no Spanish club is in the quarter-finals,? Gill said after unveiling sharply lower interim profits at United. 

This season, nine times winners Real Madrid, Barcelona, United and English champions Arsenal have failed to reach the quarter finals. 

Gill said he talked with AC Milan officials before their recent tie and they had discussed a seeding system after the group stage whereby the team seeded top ? based on past performance ? play the 16th seed, the second the 15th and so on. (Reuters)

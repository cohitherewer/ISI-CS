 Im relieved to be among runs, says Gilchrist

Melbourne: Adam Gilchrist was just pleased to get among runs after smashing the fastest ODI century by an Aussie in the 55-run victory over the World XI on Friday. 

Gilchrist, who brought up his 12th ODI century off just 73 balls ? five fewer than the record he jointly held with Allan Border ? was the chief architect of Australias mammoth 328 for four. 

The World XI were then bowled out for 273. Im certainly relieved to be getting runs, he said. Like everyone who came back from England, I had a bit to think about and some hard work to do. 

I dont think I needed to change some major things, I just needed to clear my head and get in some really hard practice. 

The net sessions and training here have been great and we have just been doing some hard work. I think if you work hard enough and long enough, itll turn around. 

Gilchrist, who shared a 110-run opening partnership with Simon Katich to lay the foundation for the huge total, was unaware he had broken the record. 

I didnt know how many balls I had faced at any stage of the innings except the first ball, Gilchrist said. I knew I faced that. I didnt feel like I got off to a flier at the start. At the middle I knew the tempo was going all right. 

Its all about the start we get for the team and fortunately Kato and I have had a couple of good launching pads for the team and the guys then came in and cashed in on that. 

World XI captain Shaun Pollock said the destructive Gilchrist had ensured his composite side was under pressure from the outset. 

It was pretty difficult, said Pollock. He is a lethal player up front and really can do some damage. It was a good deck and he took advantage. 

To get a start like that and set a foundation at such a rate of knots really does put you on the back foot. He was superb and set the game up for them.

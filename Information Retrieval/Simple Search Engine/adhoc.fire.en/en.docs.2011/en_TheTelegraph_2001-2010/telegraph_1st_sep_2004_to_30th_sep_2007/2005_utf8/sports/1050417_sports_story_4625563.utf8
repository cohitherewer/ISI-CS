The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Johl leads Asia ahead of Japan

 - Indian?s eight birdies puts him and Srirot on top 

 Johl made up for Friday?s slip-up with Randhawa 

Shenzhen: India?s Amandeep Johl put behind him a disappointing opening round to turn in the performance of the day in the four-ball matches of Visa Dynasty Cup Saturday. 

Johl fired eight birdies over the World Cup course at Mission Hills Golf Club, helping him and his partner Thammanoon Srirot of Thailand to a 3 amp; 2 victory over Japan?s Katsumasa Miyamoto and Hiroyuki Fujita. 

The point helped Asia take a one-point lead over Japan going into Sunday?s singles. The Indian?s round was in stark contrast to his first day foursomes match where he and compatriot Jyoti Randhawa lost 2 amp; 3 to the same Japanese pair. 

?It?s nice to get an interview! I made eight birdies which was great. I?ve been playing good. 

?Yesterday, we were a little confused with each other. We were feeling sorry for each other (with Jyoti Randhawa) but today with Thammanoon (Srirot) we had a good combination going. Holed almost everything,? said Johl. 

Johl began the second day with a birdie on the first hole, made three birdies on the trot from the sixth and helped close out his match with birdies on 11, 13, 15 and 16. 

At the first Dynasty Cup two years Johl attended the event working as a commentator for television but this time round he is in the heat of the action. 

?I was rooting for Asia back then and now I have a bigger role. It?s obviously better to be playing in this event this year, no doubt about that,? said Johl. 

Thammanoon was full of praise for his playing partner. Said the Thai: ?Johl just played unbelievably well. He made the putts and even had one chip in birdie on the eighth. I was enjoying myself watching him play.? 

The other Asian debutants at the Dynasty Cup also enjoyed memorable days. Filipino Angelo Que and Korea?s Mo Joong-kyung provided Asia with another inspirational display and was unlucky to not earn a big win over Japan?s Shigeki Maruyama and Keiichiro Fukabori. 

One down with two to play, Que birdied the 17th hole to level the tie and had a match winning putt on 18 from 15 feet which agonisingly slid by the edge of the hole. 

?This is too tough!? said Mo. ?I wasn?t hitting it great on the front nine and Angelo played great on the front to keep it going. 

?We are happy with this. Maruyama and Fukabori are world-class players. We tried to beat them but getting a half is okay.? 

Que was relishing the opportunity of taking on the world?s number 24. ?Surprisingly, I wasn?t feeling any pressure going into the last three holes. 

?We were having fun out there. Yesterday, we birdied 16 and 17 and we did the same again today to stay in. We are pleased to get the half again against two top players. So far we haven?t lost a match and hopefully tomorrow we can get a win. 

?This time I had a better chance to hole the birdie putt on 18. I thought I had made that putt after hitting it but it wasn?t meant to be,? said the 27-year-old Filipino. 

?But we?ve shown to Japan that the Asian Tour is a tough tour to beat.? (PTI)

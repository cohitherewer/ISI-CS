London: Arjen Robben?s seventh league goal of the season and Petr Cech?s penalty save sealed a gritty 1-0 victory for league leaders Chelsea at Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday. 

The Londoners, far from their fluent best in a prickly encounter at Ewood Park, scrapped to an eighth consecutive league victory to move 11 points clear of Manchester United. 

With 13 games remaining, Chelsea have 64 points, United 53 and Arsenal, who lost 2-4 at home to United on Tuesday, are a distant third on 51. 

Elsewhere, fourth-placed Everton maintained their quest for Champions League football with a 1-0 victory over Norwich City, Birmingham City beat Southampton 2-1 and Manchester City drew 1-1 with Newcastle United. 

Aston Villa?s Colombian striker Juan Pablo Angel scored one goal and missed two penalties as his side drew 1-1 at Fulham. 

After the fireworks at Highbury 24 hours earlier, Chelsea relied on old fashioned hard graft to overcome Blackburn, who provided an intimidating physical test. 

Cech, who beat former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel?s Premier League record of 694 minutes without conceding a goal, proved the hero after Robben had given them the lead after five minutes. The Dutch winger raced on to Frank Lampard?s long pass and drove a shot through ?keeper Brad Friedel from a tight angle before limping off following a heavy tackle by Aaron Mokoena. 

Rovers were awarded a penalty after 34 minutes when Paulo Ferreira brought down Robbie Savage, but Cech dived low to his left to keep out Paul Dickov?s firm spot-kick. 

The last goal the Czech international conceded was in the 2-2 draw at Arsenal in December. 

Alan Shearer blasted his 250th Premier League goal to give Newcastle United an early lead at Manchester City, for whom another former England striker, Robbie Fowler, equalised from the penalty spot. 

In Italy, AC Milan cut Juventus?s lead at the top of Serie A to five points when they won 4-1 at Messina and Juve lost 0-1 at home to Sampdoria on Wednesday. 

Juventus? second Serie A defeat of the season left them on 50 points from 22 matches with champions Milan on 45 from the same number of games. 

Inter Milan held on to third place with a 1-0 home win over bottom club Atalanta. Fourth-placed Udinese ended a run of three defeats with a comfortable 3-0 victory against Chievo Verona. 

AS Roma?s charge for a Champions League place stumbled as a late goal by Lecce?s Mirko Vucinic cancelled out an earlier own goal by defender Guillermo Giacomazzi in a 1-1 draw. (Reuters)

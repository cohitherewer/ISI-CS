 Warriors win via Dhanraj golden goal

Hyderabad: Mercurial forward Dhanraj Pillay scored the golden goal as Maratha Warriors defeated Chennai Veerans 3-2 in the Premier Hockey League (PHL) here on Saturday. 

After the teams were locked 2-2 at regulation time, the match was extended to extra-time when Pillay deflected in the free hit from outside by Kashif Jawad. 

The win gave Warriors two points while Chennai got one for taking the match into extra time. Jawad gave Maratha Warriors the lead in the 25th minute, while Chennai skipper Ignace Tirkey drew parity in the 32nd minute. 

Sandeep Singh?s 49th minute strike made the scoreline 2-1 in favour of the Veerans, but the Warriors equalised through Pakistan?s Ali Raza, who converted a penalty corner in the 58th minute. 

Veerans draw level just before completion of the second quarter. Ignace Tirkey shot hard from a narrow angle in the right flank and the ball caressed the pads of goalkeeper Baljit Singh before entering the cage. With today?s point, Chennai Veerans moved to three from six matches while Maratha Warriors were on seven points from six matches.

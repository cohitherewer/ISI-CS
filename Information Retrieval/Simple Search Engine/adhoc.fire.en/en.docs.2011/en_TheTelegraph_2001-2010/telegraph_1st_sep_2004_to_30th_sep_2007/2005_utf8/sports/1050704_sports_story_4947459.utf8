The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Monday, July 04, 2005 

 London: Former Olympic champion Haile Gebrselassie was a runaway winner of the British 10 km London run on Sunday in 28: 12. The world record-holder and double Olympic champion for the distance was never under pressure as he coasted to victory around the capital?s historic landmarks.

 There were pre-event hopes that the Ethiopian star might challenge the UK all-comers? record of 27:25 he set at the Bupa Great Manchester Run in May. But he spreadeagled the field from the beginning of the race and was never tested.

 Robert Cheboror of Kenya was a distant second in 29:06 with Thembalina Zola from South Africa clocking 29:36 for third place.

 Singapore: The IOC on Sunday stripped show jumper Cian O?Connor of Ireland?s only gold medal from last year?s Athens Olympics after his horse Waterford Crystal failed a dope test.

 ?The period for appeal is now over,? IOC director Giselle Davies said. ?O?Connor is now officially disqualified from the event and the medals will be redistributed accordingly.?

 The gold medal now goes to Brazil?s Rodrigo Pessoa on Baloubet du Rouet. Chris Kappler of the US on Royal Kaliber gets silver and German Marco Kutscher on Montender was elevated to bronze. 

 Singapore: Detailed results of this week?s vote to decide which sports will be kicked off the programme for the 2012 Olympics will remain secret, the IOC said on Sunday. Each of the 28 sports contested at the 2004 Athens Games will be put to a vote in Singapore on Friday and any sport failing to win a majority of votes will be dropped for the 2012 Games.

 Exact results of the electronic vote will not be divulged, IOC director Giselle Davies said. Sports will learn only if they are in or out. The call for secrecy is designed to avoid any embarrassment for sports that score poorly or only just remain in the Games.

 Manchester: Manchester United will not sell England striker Wayne Rooney despite acquiring debts of ?500 million ($890 million) since the take-over by Malcolm Glazer, chief executive David Gill said on Sunday.

 Most of the ?790 million ($1.4 billion) that Glazer ? owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL team ? used in the buyout was borrowed money, and Reds fans fear that the club may need to sell its best players to pay off the debt.

 ?Wayne Rooney will definitely not be sold,? Gill told BBC Radio Five Live on Sunday. ?We fought long and hard to get Wayne last summer and we are delighted with the purchase.?

 Glazer put his three sons on the board of directors a month ago. He has since bought out all but two per cent of the shareholding, taking the club off the stock market and turning it back into a privately owned firm.

 Zagreb: A car used by Dinamo Zagreb coach Josip Kuze was destroyed in an arson attack early on Saturday, police said.

 ?It is evident that the fire was started intentionally. We found out that the car window had been broken and an inflammable liquid had been thrown in,? a senior Zagreb police officer Dubravko Novak told state television.

 Kuze told police the car was owned by his 26-year old son.

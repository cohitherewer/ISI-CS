 Atwal to take part

New Delhi: US PGA star Arjun Atwal will participate in the $300,000 Hero Honda Indian Open to be played at the Delhi Golf Club from October 27 to 30. This will be Atwals first meet in India since enjoying his breakthrough season on the PGA Tour. 

Having comfortably secured his US PGA card for next year, the 32-year-old has confirmed that he will play in the event. Atwal won the Indian Open in Calcutta in 1999 to claim his maiden victory on the Asian Tour. 

I still feel that was the most important win of my career. I had come close to winning on a number of occasions, but that was the first and gave me the confidence to realise I could win at that level. So to take part in this event, especially after the year I had in the US, is special, Atwal said on Monday. 

After that 1999 win, the Indian star went on the claim another five Asian Tour titles, including the Hero Honda Masters in 2000 and 2003, the latter coming at Delhi Golf Club. Atwal has been on holiday for the last few weeks at his residence in Orlando, so he would be very fresh when he tees-off at the DGC. (PTI)

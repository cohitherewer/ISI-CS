 Bagan, SBT draw 1-1

Kozhikode: Mohun Bagan were held to a 1-1 draw by State Bank of Travancore (SBT) in the National Football League for ONGC Cup tie here on Tuesday. 

Placed at the bottom of the table, SBT came up with a much improved performance in the first half and was first to find the target in the 19th minute when forward Abdul Hakkim neatly converted a Naushad pass. 

However, the bankmen gradually lost control over the game in the second half. Brazilian Eduardo Coelho finally scored the equaliser for the visitors through a header in the 69th minute. 

Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Subrata Pal was adjudged Man-of-the-Match for his excellent show under the bar.

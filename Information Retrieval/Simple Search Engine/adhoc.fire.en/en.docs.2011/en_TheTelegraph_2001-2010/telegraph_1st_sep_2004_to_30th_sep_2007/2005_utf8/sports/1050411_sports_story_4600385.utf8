The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Baroda surge too late

Mumbai: Tamil Nadu staved off a late fightback by Baroda to carve out a comfortable 30-run victory, and enter the semi-finals of the inter state one-day all India knock out meet at the Wankhede Stadium here on Sunday. 

Tamil Nadu posted a healthy-looking 274 for eight in 50 overs, thanks mainly to an anchoring 68-run effort by S. Badrinath. 

In reply, Baroda lost two wickets in the first over before recovering through Yusuf Pathan?s belligerent 19-ball 34 with six fours and a six. 

But the dismissal of Yusuf and opener Satyajit Parab in quick succession put the brakes on Baroda, who recovered to 122 before another slump saw them tottering at 138 for six. 

BRIEF SCORES: Tamil Nadu 274/8 in 50 ovs (S Badrinath 68). Baroda 244 in 46.2 ovs (A. Bhoite 62; Suresh 4/60). Tamil Nadu won by 30 runs. (PTI)

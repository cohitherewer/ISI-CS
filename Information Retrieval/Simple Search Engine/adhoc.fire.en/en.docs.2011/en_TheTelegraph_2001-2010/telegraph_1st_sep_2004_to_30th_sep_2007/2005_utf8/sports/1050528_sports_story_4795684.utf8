 ANC youth wing wants Ntini to lead

Durban: The youth wing of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) has called for the appointment of Makhaya Ntini as captain of the South Africa team. 

The Youth League made the call in the backdrop of the appointment of Mickey Arthur as the new coach. 

The organisation said 11 years after the introduction of democracy, cricket and all other national teams should be representative of the people of the country. 

Ntini, 27, said he was not prepared to get involved in such matters. 

I dont want to involve myself in those issues, thats absolutely out of my league, said Ntini. (PTI)

 Faction rivalry leads to cancelled tie

Dharamshala: The tussle between the two rival factions of the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) ? headed by Anurag Thakur and Rajinder Zar ? took its toll on the Ranji Trophy Plate match between Himachal and Tripura. The tie had to be called off owing to watering of the pitch, for which the rival bodies blamed each other. 

The warring groups wanted to field their own teams for the match scheduled to begin on Thursday, but the BCCI directed the umpires to entertain the HPCA team fielded by Zar. 

The Anurag faction objected to it saying that the team, which had already played the first round match, could not be changed midway. 

Amid the confusion, the pitch was profusely watered. The umpires later called off the match. (PTI)

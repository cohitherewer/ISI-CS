The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IFA, GFA decide to defy AIFF fiat

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA) and the Goa Football Association (GFA) on Saturday formally decided to keep the foreigners in their respective premier leagues, in a virtual defiance of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) fiat against it. 

The IFAs governing body met here in an emergent meeting, attended by, among others, representatives of East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting and passed a unanimous resolution in favour of foreign players participation. 

Late Friday, in Margao, the GFA, in a meeting with the professional league clubs, formally decided that foreign players should continue to play in the local league if not domestic football. 

The two association had earlier expressed their difference of opinion with the AIFF dictat. The IFA will have foreigners play in the local Super Division League as well as tournaments like the IFA Shield and in its teams for the Durand Cup. 

The IFA has decided to ban foreigners from all other divisions of the Calcutta league. 

The clubs playing in Goas professional league have directed GFA secretary Savio Messias to inform the AIFF that there should be no change of rules right now. 

If at all they want to change rules, they should consult all the clubs before taking a decision on banning the foreign players as some of the clubs have contracted the foreign players for the current season, Messias said. 

Clubs also sought to remind the AIFF of a regulation 

Requiring to sign all foreign players for a minimum of six months while the National Football League runs for only three months. 

Foreign players playing in domestic league will not hinder the progress of local player. On the contrary it will help to improve the standard of the local players playing alongside foreign players, Messias said.

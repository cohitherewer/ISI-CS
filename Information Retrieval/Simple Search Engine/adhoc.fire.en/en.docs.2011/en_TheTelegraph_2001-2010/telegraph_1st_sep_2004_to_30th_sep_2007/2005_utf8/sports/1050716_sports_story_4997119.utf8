 NZ govt not to declare trip illegal

Sydney: New Zealand will not declare next months tour of Zimbabwe illegal over human rights abuses but will call on South Africa to help it isolate Zimbabwe. 

It is not the New Zealand governments intention to legislate and prevent the tour, New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff said on Friday, citing the right of individuals and organisations from New Zealand to travel freely. 

New Zealand is leading an international push to have Zimbabwe banned from the cricket tour schedule over concerns of abuses under President Robert Mugabe. New Zealand had asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change its policy requiring teams to tour Zimbabwe. 

The games ruling body said this week the tour should go ahead unless the New Zealand government ruled it illegal. New Zealand has already said it will not provide visas for a reciprocal tour it is due to host late this year.

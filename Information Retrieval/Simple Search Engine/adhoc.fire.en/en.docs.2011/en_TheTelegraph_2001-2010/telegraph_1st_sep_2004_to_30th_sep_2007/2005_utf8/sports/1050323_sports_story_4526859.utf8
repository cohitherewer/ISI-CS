Bangalore: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer Tuesday said not all was over for his team after the defeat in the second Test and that his players would bounce back and square the series. 

?We have to be optimistic. I don?t think it was a disaster (Calcutta Test)... I am expecting them to bounce back. That?s the whole team effort?, Woolmer said ahead of the third and final Test starting here on Thursday. 

Woolmer said Pakistan let the match out of their grasp when they failed to gain a sizeable first innings lead. 

?There was some very good leg spin bowling display by Anil Kumble. We lost on the third day (itself). It was a tough wicket to bat on,? he said. 

?We have to put that behind. We have to get stuck into this match (third Test). We are very positive, going into this match.? 

Woolmer said he was not satisfied by Pakistan?s performance in the series so far. ?In order to beat India, which is a very good side, we need to bowl and bat a lot better. We had certain glimpses of that in both matches (first and second Tests). Now we have to put the whole package together for this match.? 

He admitted that Pakistan missed fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar. ?Any team will miss a bowler of his pace,? he said. ?It?s going to be a difference. If he is not fit and can?t play, what do I do?? 

In a lighter vein, he said, ?I can?t get another Shoaib. I can?t do that, unfortunately. Cloning of human beings is banned.? 

Woolmer said the ICC needed to take a relook at the issue of doosra, which he described as a ?new skill?. 

?I don?t think it (doosra) is a throw. It?s not a genuine throw. It?s a new skill,? Woolmer said. 

?The ICC have to look at whether they accept this new skill and to what level they are going to accept this new skill. 

?Cricket is undergoing a metamorphic change. Bowling actions are changing because batsmen play spin so much better.? 

Woolmer said the doosra was pioneered by Saqlain Mushtaq and other bowlers followed the suit. In order to bowl a doosra, one had to change the wrist specifically with an element of elbow in it, he said. 

Asked if Pakistan will have a psychological advantage in case Harbhajan Singh did not bowl doosra in the third test, Woolmer said: ?It (if Harbhajan does not bowl doosra) might make a difference.? 

Indian coach John Wright insisted Harbhajan would continue to bowl his doosra in the third Test. ?We expect Harbhajan to carry on with the way he had been bowling in the last 40-odd Tests,? Wright said. 

The BCCI has, meanwhile, promised to take up the matter with the ICC. 

On captain Sourav Ganguly?s poor form, Wright said: ?You can go through such situations (lean patches). But I am sure he would get runs and get them quickly. Batting conditions are good here. He is a top player.? (PTI)

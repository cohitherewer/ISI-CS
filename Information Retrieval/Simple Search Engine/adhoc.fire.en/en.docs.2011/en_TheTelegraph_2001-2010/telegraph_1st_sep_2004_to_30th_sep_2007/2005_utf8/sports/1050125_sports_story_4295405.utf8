 PCB: Allegation a closed chapter

 - Musharraf stresses on discipline 

Islamabad: Declaring allegations that a member of the Pakistani cricket team had raped a woman in Australia as a ?closed chapter?, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday said there would be no probe into it. 

The PCB could not go by ?one report in one tabloid? and conduct an inquiry into an incident, which, it said, had never happened. 

?The chapter is closed as far as PCB is concerned. Based on one story in one tabloid, we cannot conduct a probe,? PCB spokesman Abbas Zaidi said. 

?If we do that we would add credence to such reports which aim at demeaning Pakistani cricket.? 

Zaidi said the PCB believes no rape had taken place as alleged in Australian media reports, which said a woman had complained to a sexual abuse centre of being raped by a Pakistani cricketer in Melbourne during the Boxing Day Test. 

?That?s exactly the situation (that no rape took place). If something like that had happened, the hotel staff or security or someone would have got to know. It could not have gone unnoticed. 

?Also, it is very intriguing that the so-called incident happened three or four weeks ago and still no police complaint has been made as yet,? he said. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan?s poor recent performances in Australia have earned the disapproval of the country?s military ruler President Pervez Musharraf. 

Musharraf, chief patron of the PCB, told its chairman Shaharyar Khan on Monday he was concerned about the team, who were crushed 0-3 in the Test series with none of the three matches lasting into the fifth day. 

Pakistan have now won only one of their first three games in a one-day tournament against the hosts and the West Indies. 

?The President expressed his concern to the PCB chairman on the poor performance of the team in Australia and on the reports of alleged indiscipline by some players,? Zaidi said. 

?The President has made it clear that the board should lay stress on maintaining discipline in the team and any player found guilty of violating the code of conduct should be given stringent punishment,? the PCB spokesman added. 

Shaharyar also briefed Musharraf on the proposed schedule for Pakistan?s tour of India, which is due to start next month.

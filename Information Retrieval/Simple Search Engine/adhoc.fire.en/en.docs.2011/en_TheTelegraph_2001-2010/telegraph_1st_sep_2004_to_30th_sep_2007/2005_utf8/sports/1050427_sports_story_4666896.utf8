 BCCI, PCB to discuss excessive cricket

Islamabad: The revival of Indo-Pak cricketing ties may have generated a lot of interest, but the two boards are concerned that excessive action between the two countries may result in the public losing interest in the traditional rivalry. 

Concerned officials of the BCCI and PCB will discuss the issue during India?s tour of Pakistan next year. 

?After India complete their tour of Pakistan sometime in January-February next, the two boards will discuss this issue,? PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan was quoted as saying by a local daily. 

?We feel perhaps Pakistan and India are playing too much cricket against each other since the revival of cricket ties and we need to reach a bilateral agreement on how much we should play against each other in, say, a five-year cycle,? he explained. 

Since the Indian government allowed its team to tour Pakistan last year in March-April after a four-year freeze in bilateral cricket ties, the two teams have played 15 ODIs and six Tests against each other. And early next year, India are due to tour Pakistan for three Tests and five ODIs. Sometime in March-April 2006, they will clash again in the Asia Cup in Pakistan. 

?We don?t want a situation where people will become tired of watching Pakistan-India matches. We don?t want an excess of these games at any point of time. We have a played a lot against each other in a year?s time,? Shaharyar argued. 

Shaharyar disclosed that the PCB was considering the appointment of a specialist fielding coach for the senior team as part of its preparations for the 2007 World Cup. 

?Fielding and running between wickets remain areas in which we have to improve and keeping the World Cup in mind, we are looking at the possibility of having a professional,? he stated. (PTI)

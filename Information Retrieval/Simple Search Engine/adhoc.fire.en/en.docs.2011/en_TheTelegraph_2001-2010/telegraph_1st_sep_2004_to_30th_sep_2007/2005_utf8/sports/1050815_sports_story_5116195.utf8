 India go down to Spain

Amstelveen: India paid the price for a sloppy show in the first half to go down to strong contenders Spain 0-1 in their opening match of the eight-nation Rabobank Trophy Hockey Tournament for the Mini World Cup on Sunday. 

Spain scored through Pol Amat in the 25th minute in the Pool A match. 

The Indians put up a much improved show after the lemon break but the Champions Trophy holders proved a tough nut to crack and held on to their slender lead to gain three points from the match played at the wagner stadium. 

Earlier, Asian Games champions South Korea comprehensively beat England 5-1. 

Spain started the game with a purpose and caught the Indian defence napping on several occasions. 

One such lapse by the Indians saw the Maurits Hendriks-coached team surge into lead when Amat slammed in a powerful shot from the right of the goal post after Ignace Tirkey lost the ball in the middle.

 Pawar surprises Dungarpur

New Delhi: Former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungapur Friday said that Sharad Pawars proposed move to speak to the national selectors for dropping Sourav Ganguly from the third Test squad would set a bad precedent. 

Dungapur said that when a team was announced it always had the approval of the president and pulling up the selectors for any decision was not cricket. 

Obviously and unfortunately, it is (a bad precedent). I am surprised by the statement from a man of his stature and experience, Dungarpur, who backed Pawar in the recent board elections, said. 

I have been the president and chairman of selectors. The decision of the selection committee is conveyed by the secretary to the president for his approval. And once that is done, there are no questions to be asked, the former BCCI chief told a news channel. 

On Pawars reported remarks that he would use the forum when the president was required to approve teams for international tours to discuss the issue with the selectors, Dungarpur said: The process is the same. President has to be informed before the press. 

Asked if it was Pawars way to soften the wide spread outrage over Souravs exclusion, Dungarpur said, perhaps, a politician is more susceptible. 

Perhaps he wants to clear the air by saying that he would speak to the selectors. But it is not a good precedent. It is not cricket, he said. 

Dungarpur said such a move would undermine the fair process of selection. 

We had a similar situation way back in 1975. We five of us said if we are asked to explain, we will quit, he said.

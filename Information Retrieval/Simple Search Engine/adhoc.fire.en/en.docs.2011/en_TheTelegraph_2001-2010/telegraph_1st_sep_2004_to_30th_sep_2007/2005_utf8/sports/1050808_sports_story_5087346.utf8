The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The best dont look to avoid the best, but wish to compete against them 

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE - Greg Chappell talks about his younger days and 

 some memories that still linger 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Colombo: With the janatas expectations sky high, the pressure isnt only on the Rahul Dravids, but Greg Chappell as well. The coachs body language, though, doesnt give anything away. Chappell, who recently spoke to The Telegraph for well over an hour, was candid (and passionate) about every point he made. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q Everybodys 

 familiar with Greg Chappell the batsman and, now, people 

 are getting used to you as coach. Yet, few know you as a 

 person... 

 A Im pretty intense about cricket... 

 Other than that, I enjoy reading... Read more for information 

 than fun... Fact is I enjoy learning and am game for anything 

 that will help me develop further... Im particularly 

 fascinated by the power of the mind... Ideas applicable 

 elsewhere could, after all, be as effective in cricket. 

 You did quite a bit of reading 

 on India before taking charge, didnt you? 

 Absolutely... I didnt, for 

 example, know Goa was liberated from the Portuguese as recently 

 as 1961... The process of learning is going to continue. 

 Did Judith need to be persuaded 

 about shifting to India? 

 No... At some point or the other, 

 she wanted to live overseas... She came to India in 1997, 

 when I was a commentator for one of the tournaments, and 

 returned fascinated. She has supported all my endeavours 

 and weve come to India at a time when the country 

 is in the midst of exciting times. 

 Is there something you may 

 not now be able to do too frequently? 

 Playing golf, perhaps... 

 Have you had a favourite golfer? 

 Jack Nicklaus... Ive admired him for mental 

 toughness, not just an extraordinary level of skill... Im 

 also a fan of Tiger Woods and Vijai Singh. 

 Has Australian Rules Football 

 influenced you? 

 Yes, particularly the strategies 

 adopted by coaches. 

 What are the ingredients of 

 success? 

 (Grins) All the successful people Ive 

 met and read about have gone through a process... Its 

 not only talent, but understanding the sport or business 

 and following a process which allows one to be more successful 

 than the others. If you focus on the process, the outcome 

 will take care of itself. However, if you focus on the outcome 

 and forget the process, you wont get anywhere. There 

 has to be a commitment to the process and a desire to excel. 

 How do you measure success? 

 Runs scored? Millions made? 

 Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, 

 too, have to be regarded as successful... Mother Teresa 

 as well... Even the Dalai Lama... One has to study the process 

 they went through and, as important, their attitude. Indeed, 

 the attitude you bring to whatever you do is critical to 

 the outcome. Alexander Graham Bell... The Wright brothers... 

 They persisted and their perseverance paid off. The mindset 

 makes the difference. Theres no point being 

 the brightest star which quickly crashes. 

 You came from a fairly privileged 

 background... 

 (Interrupting) We were 

 very middle class... But, yes, privileged in that our parents 

 (Martin and Jeanne) loved us, provided for us and gave us 

 opportunities to grow as cricketers. Of course, we did have 

 sporting genes, especially from mothers side. 

 Today, which is the one childhood 

 memory which comes instantly to mind? 

 Gosh, thats tough... Regularly 

 playing one sport or the other... Thats the one instant 

 memory... 

 So, there was no pressure 

 to concentrate on studies? 

 No... The pressure was to realise 

 our dream ? playing for Australia. 

 Lets hear something 

 about the rivalry between the three brothers... 

 Ian is five years older to me 

 and Im about as many years older to Trevor... One 

 grew up individually, but I had Ian as an example... He 

 became a mentor of sorts, even though he probably didnt 

 want to be one... I must have been nine when Ian began seeing 

 me as an opponent in our backyard Ashes Tests... 

 He challenged me by treating me like an equal, not somebody 

 five years younger. I learnt to compete and got my mental 

 toughness from those backyard battles... One should know 

 how to compete and one must love competition. The best dont 

 look to avoid the best, but wish to compete against them. 

 A Glenn McGrath backs himself to get the best out. Equally, 

 a Sachin Tendulkar backs himself versus the best bowler... 

 Cricket is about the battles within a battle, like Sachin 

 against Shane Warne in the 1997-98 series in India... 

 Given the success Ian and 

 you had, did younger brother Trevor develop a complex? 

 It was much harder for him... 

 Also, Trevor didnt have the advantage of his school 

 participating in the local B grade competition in Adelaide... 

 Ian played the men from an early age and it was the same 

 with me till, in my last year, the school was asked to compete 

 at the inter-school level and not beyond... Trevor, therefore, 

 didnt get to play the men from the age of 13-14... 

 At a critical time in his development, he didnt get 

 the advantage Ian and I had. That Trevor had two major accidents, 

 one on the field, also impacted on his progress. A combination 

 of events conspired to... 

 What has cricket taught you? 

 Everything... There are good and 

 bad days and its how you deal with them that determines 

 how successful youre going to be. Everybody has setbacks 

 ? learning from them is important. Sure I went to school, 

 but my education was through cricket. 

 How much of an influence did 

 your father have? 

 He was my first idol... He wasnt 

 perfect and did make mistakes, but I admired his tenacity... 

 My next idol was Ian and I followed him around like a puppy... 

 Till I was nine, he didnt want me to be a part of 

 anything he did. Yet, suddenly ? perhaps because he ran 

 out of friends or ran out of friends he could beat ? I was 

 given the competitors status. Later, my wife became 

 the most important person in my life... Weve been 

 married for 34 years... Of all the partnerships, the one 

 with Judith has been the best! 

 Do idols and icons get weighed 

 down by their image? 

 Youve got to be the best 

 person you can be and youve got to give as much as 

 possible... If youre in a position to use power or 

 influence, do so wisely. Being generous doesnt necessarily 

 have to be in terms of money and people should appreciate 

 that some dont have the tools to be generous. 

 Have you been conscious about 

 being Greg Chappell? 

 Ive always been Greg Chappell... 

 Ive never felt I couldnt do this or that because 

 Im Greg Chappell... If anything, opportunities got 

 enhanced... Ive been involved with charities, particularly 

 the Royal Childrens Hospital in Brisbane... The Leukaemia 

 Foundation, of which Im patron in South Australia... 

 One of the hardest things was visiting the cancer ward of 

 the Hospital in early December, aware that some of the children 

 wouldnt celebrate Christmas... 

 Did the visits drain you emotionally? 

 Found them uplifting... I used 

 to dread going there... It was difficult accepting I would 

 be in the midst of dying children... Yet, once I reached 

 the Hospital, the strength of the human spirit ? of the 

 parents, the children themselves and the staff ? gave me 

 strength... The children knew they were dying, but they 

 still found a way to be happy... They joked, played pranks 

 on each other... Ill never forget my experiences at 

 the Hospital. (After a pause) During my years in 

 Brisbane, I also went to the Xavier Home for children with 

 special needs... I played an annual cricket match there 

 and would also take along my children ? just to make them 

 realise how lucky they were... That the things they complained 

 about, a headache or sore legs, werent important when 

 compared to the illnesses at the Home. Indeed, Im 

 never going to forget Raymond, a cot-ridden child obsessed 

 with cricket... He was 14 when I met him and he became an 

 inspiration... For all his problems, he wasnt angry 

 with the world... Believe me, I used to walk away feeling 

 ten feet tall... (Again, after a pause) I never went 

 to the Hospital or the Home trying to feel sorry for the 

 children... Never tried to patronise... I thank God, too, 

 for the strength I got. 

 Its amazing... 

 Well, Ive never publicised 

 the visits... I remember when I got vilified for the underarm-bowling 

 incident, the nuns from the Xavier Home wrote to one of 

 the newspapers and portrayed a different picture of me... 

 They did it on their own. 

 As an achievement, where would 

 you place the smiles you brought to the faces of so many 

 children? 

 Mate, those visits are more important 

 than anything I ever did in cricket... Money wouldnt 

 have made the children happy, my presence did. Im 

 fortunate that, being Greg Chappell, I could do my bit to 

 make their lives a little more enjoyable. 

 But some records must still 

 be very special to you? 

 (Grins again) The records 

 mean I havent wasted my life... I do feel proud of 

 my achievements, but the records dont necessarily 

 make me better than what youve achieved as a journalist... 

 Like other pros, I did my job to the best of my ability. 

 Thats a nice bottomline to live with. 

 Is there an achievement you 

 recall straightaway? 

 Things we achieved as a team... 

 The collective success... The times we beat the West Indies... 

 When we beat England... I also remember the great time in 

 the dressing room with terrific mates like Dennis Lillee 

 and Rodney Marsh. 

 Surely, there were occasions 

 when you had to push yourself? 

 Thats part of life... Some 

 days you wake up not feeling as good as you did the previous 

 day... You learn to get over that, find the mechanism to 

 cope with such situations. 

 You werent only a great 

 batsman, but a very fine captain. Somehow, people dont 

 remember that... 

 I cant worry about what 

 others think... Youre in trouble if youre living 

 for recognition... In the circumstances, I did the best 

 I could... Given another chance, with the benefit of experience, 

 I may do it better... To be honest, I spend very little 

 time looking back. 

 Are captains born 

 or can they be made? 

 Inherently, some have more leadership 

 material... Allan Border was a reluctant leader when he 

 began captaining Australia, yet was a very fine captain 

 by the time he finished (93 Tests)... Our lives are influenced 

 by others and Border learnt from others... 

 Do captains have a shelf life? 

 Border stretched the realms of 

 possibility, but theres definitely an X number of 

 matches for a captain... If you do the job with passion, 

 there has to be a limit... Having said that, if you keep 

 reinventing yourself and are flexible, then... Speaking 

 of myself, I hadnt lost any passion, but ran out of 

 steam by the end of my years as captain (48 Tests). The 

 mental energy had been expended. 

 Wasnt it unfair for 

 the Establishment to have called you all mercenaries when 

 Packer exploded in the late Seventies? 

 Packer had less to do with money 

 and more with respect. I was involved and, so, know exactly 

 what happened. The administrators werent respecting 

 the players, werent respecting what we had to offer... 

 We stood up for our rights and what we did became the catalyst 

 for modern-day cricket. 

 One isnt talking of 

 your generation, but why is it that most older cricketers 

 grudge the monetary well-being of the present lot? 

 I wouldnt like to comment... 

 All I wish to say is that I was happy playing in the era 

 I did. Sure, todays cricketers get paid a lot more, 

 but I was well paid for what I did... Theres no point 

 regretting anything... Cricket gave opportunities to do 

 business and I was able to use my skills. 

 Your international career 

 spanned around a decade-and-half. Wasnt it difficult 

 suddenly getting out of the limelight? 

 If I missed anything, it was the 

 camaraderie... Id played enough cricket to last three 

 lifetimes... I finished with no regrets. 

 Except getting Trevor to bowl 

 underarm... 

 It happened for a reason, happened 

 in those circumstances... Perhaps, it was supposed to teach 

 me a lesson... Humility or something else... I dont 

 regret it as it taught me something important. 

 Are you religious? 

 Im not a regular church-goer, 

 but Im a spiritual person... I have faith in something 

 bigger than myself. 

 Finally, what do you tell 

 emerging cricketers? 

 Follow your dreams... The happiest 

 people Ive ever met are the ones doing what they like... 

 They may not be the highest paid in their profession, but 

 arent short on personal satisfaction. My take is that 

 money alone hasnt ever made anybody happy... If youre 

 doing something just for money, think again.

 Gunners building for the future

 - Arsenal desperately need Henry to stay 

HENRY WINTER

 Thierry Henry is irreplaceable 

These are uncertain times at Highbury, but not apocalyptic ones. Trailing in the Premier League with doubts swirling over the future of important players, Arsenal are far from crisis country, yet they would give anything to guarantee starting at their splendid Ashburton Grove home next season with Thierry Henry in attack and Champions League football assured. 

After three successive Premiership defeats, Arsenal returned to winning ways on Boxing Day with a 1-0 victory at troubled Charlton Athletic. The push to reclaim one of the Champions League berths should continue. 

Arsene Wenger, Arsenals manager, credited last weeks penalties escape against Doncaster Rovers in the Carling Cup as reminding his squad of their battling qualities. Showing a more relaxed streak after recent travails, Wenger laughed when Doncasters huge dog mascot presented him with a large Christmas card. Wenger appreciated the humour of the gesture in the wake of his well-publicised spat with his Chelsea counterpart, Jose Mourinho. 

Positive events involving the fringe players at Belle Vue and more familiar faces at the Valley have lifted the spirits of Wengers men. 

Freddie Ljungberg even refused to accept Chelsea were over the Premiership horizon. Of course we are a lot of points behind Chelsea but the mentality in the dressing room is that we are winners, said the Swedish midfielder. We will try to win the league. 

It felt great to win against Charlton. They have been quite difficult games ? Bolton and Newcastle away and Chelsea at home are not easy ? but its below our standards to lose three in a row. So it was a massive win. We need to build on it. 

Building is the key word at Arsenal, building a winning run, building Ashburton Grove, and rebuilding the team. 

As well as the need for a high-class central midfielder, the future of three individuals fills Wengers mind. It seems increasingly accepted that Ashley Cole will leave for Real Madrid next summer as Roberto Carlos successor, preferably with his transfer fee enhanced by an eye-catching World Cup. At least Wenger has an obvious understudy in Gael Clichy, though the young Frenchman lacks Coles all-round excellence. 

Henry, though, is irreplaceable. Wenger will attempt to weave his magic in the market, turning an under-achiever into a trophy-winner, but such bargains are increasingly rare, particularly with Roman Abramovichs billions distorting parts of the player bazaar (in fees and wages). Arsenal desperately need the talismanic Henry to stay, although Barcelona hover covetously. 

As for Robert Pires, Wenger will sit down with the midfielder in the new year to discuss a new contract. Pires current deal runs out next summer and the 33-year-old can talk to other clubs from January 1. 

Pires has articulated his desire to stay, but the stumbling block may prove the boards unwillingness to offer anything more than a one-year deal, club policy for players advancing through their 30s. Up to now, yes, said Wenger of the rule, but you can always have exceptions.

 Calcutta Police to organise state boxing

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: For the first time in the state boxing history, local policemen will be seen doing something other than maintaining law and order. This time around, Calcutta Police will be the organisers of the 52nd state boxing championships. 

Announcing this at a press conference on Tuesday, Zulfikar Hassan, joint commissioner (AP), said that their move was aimed at generating interest among the police personnel as well as backing a sport which often complains about lack of sponsors. 

The championships (which also includes sub-junior and senior womens meets as well) will be held from Thursday to Tuesday next at Bodyguard Lines, Alipore. The Bengal Amateur Boxing Federation (BABF) will collaborate with the city police in organising the meet. 

Interestingly, Raj Kumar Singh, a sergeant, and his two daughters will participate in the meet. 

The best boxer awards in the senior and sub-junior categories will be named after Ronnie Moore and Shankar Sil, while the trophy in the womens section will be dedicated to former champion Robin Bhatt, who recently died of a heart attack.

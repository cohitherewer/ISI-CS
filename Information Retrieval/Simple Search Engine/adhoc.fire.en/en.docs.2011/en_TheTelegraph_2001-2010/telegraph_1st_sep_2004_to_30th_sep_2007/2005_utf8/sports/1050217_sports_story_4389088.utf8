 Shoaib Akhtar gets manager?s clean chit 

 Rashid has cleared Shoaib of disciplinary charges 

Islamabad: In a major relief to Shoaib Akhtar, who faces a disciplinary hearing on Thursday, Pakistan team manager Haroon Rashid has cleared the fast bowler of off-field disciplinary charges levelled against him during the team?s recent tour of Australia. 

Haroon submitted his report to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in which he has given his comments on Shoaib?s behaviour during the tour and separately also to the inquiry committee, constituted by the board to probe into charges that he violated four clauses of his central contract. 

The inquiry committee specifically asked Haroon for his comments on Shoaib. 

The fast bowler has been charged with visiting nightclubs, giving press statements without permission and reporting late to the board after returning from Australia. 

Haroon sent a letter to the inquiry committee outlining clearly that except for one occasion when Shoaib was fined for coming late to a practice session, he had not been involved in any other act of indiscipline in Australia, a local daily reported on Wednesday. 

?As far as I am concerned Shoaib was prompt in attending all team meetings, he followed the team dress code, attended all team dinners and official receptions,? Haroon was quoted as saying by the newspaper. 

?There was no case of him being involved in any misbehaviour off the field.? 

?As far as my domain is concerned, there were no problems with any player. But if there were instances of Shoaib not bowling at the nets or not taking part in some training session, that comes under the preview of the captain and coach and not the manager,? Haroon said. 

The inquiry committee, which includes PCB director (media) Abbas Zaidi, legal advisor Syed Asghar Haider and former Test player Imtiaz Ahmed, has now referred Shoaib?s case to the board?s disciplinary committee.

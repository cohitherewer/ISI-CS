Margao: Churchill Brothers, played their hearts out, especially in the second half, to score a convincing 4-2 win over Tollygunge Agragami and sail into the quarter finals of the 27th Federation Cup on Thursday.

Churchill started in positive note by taking a lead in the fourth minute through Fredy Mascarenhas. Tollygunge found the equaliser in the stoppage time of the first half through Ayan Chakraborty. 

The change of ends saw Churchill dictating terms with Fredy Mascarenhas and Osuman Husseini striking two goals within a span of two minutes. 

Thockchom Singh set Mascarenhas inside the box who dogged past two rival defenders and advancing goalie to slot the ball into the empty net in the 68th minute. 

In the next minute, an unmarked Tony Obemudu Ngozi on the right got the better of the goalkeeper and shot home as rival defender tried to clear the ball without success. 

Tollygunge managed to reduce the margin through Surajit Chakraboty whose goal-bound cross was misdirected by defender Villroy D Cruz into his own goal in the 73rd minute.

The all important goal was scored in the 27th minute by defender NS Manju who headed home a flag kick by Steven Dias from the right. 

However, JCT had to blame themselves for the defeat as they missed out on two clear chances. The culprit on both the occasions was Marcos Pereira. 

NS Manju was declared the man of the match. Mahindra will now play against HASC in the quarter finals on October 23. 

Both the teams played some attacking soccer and matched each other evenly. Mahindras initially looked sharper in attack found the net first through Jose Ramirez Barreto but was ruled off side by referee Benjamin D Silva.

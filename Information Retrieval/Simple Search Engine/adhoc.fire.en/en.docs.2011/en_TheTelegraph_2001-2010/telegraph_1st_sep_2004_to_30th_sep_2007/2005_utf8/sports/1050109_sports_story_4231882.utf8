Chittagong: Skipper Tatenda Taibu hit 92 and Elton Chigumbura 71 to steer Zimbabwe past the follow-on mark in the first Test against Bangladesh on Saturday. 

At the close of the third day, Zimbabwe were 308 for eight, still 180 runs behind on the first innings. 

Taibu capitalised on three missed catching chances to dampen Bangladesh?s hopes of a first Test victory in their 35th match. 

The skipper shared a stand of 119 for the seventh wicket with Chigumbura, who hit 10 boundaries and a six before being caught behind by Khaled Mashud off Mohammed Rafique. 

Taibu, having guided Zimbabwe past the follow-on target of 289, fell eight runs short of a first century when he was trapped by Rafique, who finished with four for 64. 

Zimbabwe, who started the day on a precarious 84 for four, reached 154 for six at lunch after pace bowler Mashrafee Murtaza claimed two wickets. 

Zimbabwe are playing their first Test since they were suspended by the ICC last June for fielding a weakened team after a dispute between their board and several leading white players. 

Taibu expressed disappointment at missing his first century. 

?Obviously I am disappointed because I would love to score a 100 and to carry on the score to 150. But it was not to be,? he said. ?We managed to achieve our target to avoid the follow-on. Tomorrow well try to add a couple of runs.? 

Zimbabwe coach Phil Simmons praised his team?s performance. 

?I think we showed a lot of character in the way the captain and Chigumbura played. It showed that there is a lot of fight in the team,? Simmons said. (REUTERS)

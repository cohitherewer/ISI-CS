 Corporation block for Kotla tie

New Delhi: The sixth and final one-dayer between India and Pakistan, scheduled here next month, has hit a road block with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) threatening to refuse permission for it till Kotla ground is ?fully ready?. 

The stadium at Kotla, one of the oldest venues in the country, is under construction to host the match on April 17. Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf is scheduled to watch the contest between the arch rivals. 

Though the Delhi and District Cricket Association officials were racing against time to make the stadium ready for the high-profile match, MCD has said it would not issue any temporary occupancy certificate until the construction works were completed. 

?No temporary occupancy certificate can be issued unless the work is completed,? MCD chairmam Rakesh Mehta said. 

The MCD chief made it clear that even if construction was not completed till April 17, date of the match, MCD would not issue any certificate.

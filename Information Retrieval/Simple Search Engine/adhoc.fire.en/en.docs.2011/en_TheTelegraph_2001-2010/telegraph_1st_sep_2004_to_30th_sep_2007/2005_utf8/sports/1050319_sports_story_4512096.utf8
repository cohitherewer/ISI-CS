 ?Power? fancied 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: Supreme Power, from Darius Byramji?s yard with C. Alford in the saddle, looks good to lift the 1,200m Hemavathi Cup here on Saturday.

 The Razeen-Divine Colours gelding, who looks in fine fettle, may face stiff opposition from speedster Gem, heading for his third straight win.

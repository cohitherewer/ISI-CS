The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhutia-EB meeting today

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Indian football captain Bhaichung Bhutia is back in the city, bubbling and dying to get into practice mode. 

The problem seems to have gone forever, and I have also regained quite a bit of weight. I hope Ill start practising within Wednesday, he said, soon after reaching the city Sunday. 

Bhaichung, it may be recalled, was diagnosed with some thyroid abnormalities and has been recuperating at his home town in Sikkim. 

Im feeling much better now. You may say Im ready for practice, he pointed out. 

The peerless striker is slated to sit with East Bengal officials across the board on Monday for a new contract. 

Nothing has been finalised yet (about my contract). But East Bengal officials have told me they want to sit with me tomorrow? Lets see, Im looking forward to the meeting, he maintained. 

Its been learnt that East Bengal are keen to enter a long-term deal with him. 

The clubs British physical trainer Peter McKnight, who is already in the second week of his six-week stint with the red-and-gold brigade, has, however, said he may chart out a special training regime for Bhaichung.

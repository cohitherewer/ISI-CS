 Milan: Inter Milan won the Italian Cup final at the San Siro, beating Roma 1-0 in the second leg to wrap up a 3-0 aggregate victory and bring a positive end to a disappointing season.

 Serbian dead-ball specialist Sinisa Mihajlovic, who spent two seasons at Roma, put the knife into his former club with a 52nd strike that killed the game off.

 Despite playing without the injured Christian Vieri and Brazilian Adriano ? on duty with his national squad in the Confederations Cup ? Inter dominated a poor Roma side and never left victory in doubt.

 Roberto Mancini?s players ensured a territorial domination that allowed them an easy path to a fourth Cup win after successes in 1939, 1978 and 1982.

 London: Newcastle United manager Graeme Souness was fined ?20,000 ($36,450) and handed a suspended two-match touchline ban by the FA on Thursday for bringing the game into disrepute.

 The Scot had denied the disciplinary charge for comments he made about referee Barry Knight following a 2-0 defeat at Everton on May 7.

 Souness criticised Knight for his handling of the game at Goodison Park. The touchline ban is suspended for 12 months. 

 Tokyo: European champions Liverpool have cancelled two pre-season friendlies in Japan next month because of a fixture pile-up, match organisers said on Thursday.

 The games against J-League clubs Shimizu S-Pulse on July 27 and Kashima Antlers on July 30 were shelved as they clash with next season?s European Champions League qualifying competition.

 London: Former African Player of the Year El Hadji Diouf has made his loan move from European champions Liverpool to Bolton Wanderers permanent, Bolton said on Thursday.

 The Senegal striker, who joined Liverpool for ?10 pounds ($18.10 million) in 2002, spent last season on loan at the Reebok Stadium and scored nine goals to help Bolton finish sixth in the Premier League and qualify for the Uefa Cup.

 The 24-year-old signed a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

 Metz: Joel Muller has been appointed Metz coach in place of Jean Fernandez, the Ligue 1 club said on Thursday.

 Muller, who was sacked by Racing Lens in January after a series of poor results, has signed a two-year contract to return to the team he coached from 1989 to 2000. Fernandez was named Marseille coach on Tuesday in place of Philippe Troussier. 

 Madrid: Portugal midfielder Deco has signed a contract extension that will keep him at Barcelona until 2010, the club said on Thursday.

 The 27-year-old is the third player to sign a new contract since Barca won the Primera Liga title last month, following Damia Abella and Spain midfielder Xavi. The Brazilian-born Deco joined Barcelona from Porto on a four-year contract last July and had an outstanding first season at the Nou Camp 

 Hissar: The Wrestling Federation of India has selected a seven-member women?s team for the Commonwealth wrestling championships to be held in Cape Town from June 30 to July 2.

 Das lucky 13 river trysts

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Rabindra Nath Das never lets his dreams get submerged in the daily struggle for livelihood. 

A labour contractor by profession, Das is an ambitious swimmer by an equal degree of desire. The 23-year-old has embarked on a mission to conquer 13 rivers and come September, hes planning to make splashes in three of them, in Bangladesh. 

Im not educated, nor am I a business tycoon. But I want to leave a mark before dying? I cant be Rabindra Nath Tagore, but I can be remembered as Rabindra Nath Das for my feat. Thats my dream, the resident of Baidyabati, in Hooghly district, who didnt continue study after passing Class X, told The Telegraph. 

But isnt No. 13 unlucky? Das smiled and said no. Bula Chowdhury is my inspiration. I hope Ill be successful in becoming the first Indian to conquer 13 rivers, he insisted. 

Das has already crossed the Brahmaputra (in 2000), Ganges (2002) and Narmada (2003). In Bangladesh, hes planning to swim in the Padma, Yamuna and Budiganga. 

State food minister Naren Dey has already promised him Rs 10,000. But I need at least Rs 65,000 for my trip. Im looking forward to helps from all quarters, he signed off.

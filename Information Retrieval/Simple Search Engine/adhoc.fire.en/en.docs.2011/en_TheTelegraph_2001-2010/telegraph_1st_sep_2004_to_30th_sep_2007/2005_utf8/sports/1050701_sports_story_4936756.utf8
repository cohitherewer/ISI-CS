 Brazil now World Cup favourites: Parreira

 - Argentina suffer biggest loss to arch-rivals in 37 years 

Frankfurt: Brazil will defend the World Cup next year as clear favourites after they crushed Argentina 4-1 in the Confederations Cup final on Wednesday, according to coach Carlos Alberto Parreira. 

Parreira said Brazil had not been favourites for many years and he contrasted the teams current form with the way they scraped into the 2002 finals, only to win the title. 

We are going in as an absolute favourite, Parreira said. We will have to work on it. We must ensure the role of favourite does not affect us. 

We had the chance to test players. Its not just a title for us, Parreira said. We were defending well and very fast touching the ball. If we play that way we will be successful. 

Parreira also offered his thoughts on the leading challengers Brazil could face, assuming they return to Germany next year. 

The home team will have a wonderful World Cup. I fancy Holland. The Czech Republic are strong. England and Portugal have improved a lot, he said. Parreira also rated Argentina as one of the top teams, with little currently separating the two South American powerhouses despite Wednesdays result. 

Argentina coach Jose Pekerman insisted the loss was no cause for panic. According to him, fate had been on Brazils side in the final. 

I believe Argentina played well...but sometimes there are matches that are part of destiny, Pekerman said after two goals from Adriano and one apiece from Kaka and Ronaldinho saw Brazil take the title with a flourish. This is their biggest win over Argentina in 37 years. 

Brazil, who coped with the cold night air, emulated France by winning the Cup for the second time following their previous success in the inaugural tournament in 1997.

 Indians to visit Fiji 

in August 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India have a busy schedule next season, throwing open the chances of staging some of the major domestic football tournaments getting either advanced or deferred. 

According to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) release, which has reached the IFA office, apart from playing three international friendlies in Pakistan, India will make another exposure trip to Fiji, slated for August 8 to 20. Both trips will be held keeping in view the Asian Games and the Olympic qualifiers. 

However, the medical and fitness test, which was held here last year, will take place either in Bangalore or New Delhi in July. 

The city, however, may host the under-23 camp for Asian Games and the Olympic qualifiers in September as well as the camp for Asian Cup qualifiers early next year. 

Meanwhile, the IFA is planning to hold the IFA Shield before the national camp for SAFF meet gets underway in November. 

IFA stand 

In another move, IFA has moved against the proposal of banning the foreigners participation in domestic meets, saving major leagues. 

In a letter to the AIFF, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta has maintained that since the local league here and in other parts of the nation is seen by the clubs as preparatory ground for the National League, foreigners play a huge role in helping the clubs earn trophies as well as drawing crowd. 

Besides, as Dutta has reasoned, the foreigners are supposed to have a minimum six-month contract with a club in India. Since the AIFF is planning to trim the spanning of the NFL to three months, the foreigners may end up getting extra three-months salary, without any service. 

The fourth division of the Calcutta league is going to start on June 8.

Toronto: American Lucas Glover produced a miraculous hole-out birdie from a bunker on the 18th to claim his first US PGA Tour title with a one-shot victory over compatriot Tom Pernice Jr at the Funai Classic on Sunday. 

With Hurricane Wilma steaming towards Florida, Glover fired a final round seven-under 65 at Walt Disney World Resorts Magnolia Golf Club in Orlando for a winning total of 23-under 265. 

You always see someone tapping in to win or making a 12 footer for birdie and going nuts, said Glover. I was trying to make par. 

For it to happen that way, it was a lucky shot and everyone can say that because its true. When its your time, its your time. 

Pernice finished with a flawless three-under 69 but after a birdie on the par-five 10th, he stalled and closed his round with eight straight pars for a 22-under 266 total. 

Briton Justin Rose (68), Australias Geoff Ogilvy (69) and Americans defending champion Ryan Palmer (64), Harrison Frazar (68) and 2002 PGA champion Rich Beem (70) all finished two shots adrift in a tie for third on 21-under 267. 

Taking advantage of ideal scoring conditions, Glover mixed one bogey with eight birdies, including a sensational three on the par-four 18th when he holed out from a greenside bunker to seal victory at the $4.4 million event. 

Almost forgotten was Glovers 35-foot birdie on 17 that put the 25-year-old in position to go for the win. 

Pernice, playing in the final group, had a chance to force a play-off but failed on a 15-foot birdie attempt at the last. 

That bunker shot went in and Ive been four feet off the ground ever since, said Glover, who earned $792,000 and a two-year exemption for the win. 

Its just great. A long time coming. A major goal and I just realised it. Its nice. 

My bunker game has been horrendous this week, and pretty much all year, to be honest. Ive been short all week. So I squared the club face up a little bit more, give it a little bit more, and it went in.

 Old lifestyle would kill me: Maradona 

 - Daughters got me out of the situation 

 Maradona at a press conference in Buenos Aires on Monday 

Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona said on Monday that if he returned to his old lifestyle, he would die. I cant go back to that, it would kill me, he told a news conference shortly after returning from a trip to Spain and Cuba. 

Maradona, who last year spent 10 days in intensive care with heart and breathing problems, said his daughters had brought him to his senses. 

My daughters got me out of a really ugly situation, said the former Argentina captain. I no longer live for the night and I sleep in my parents home. 

Before, I had lots of money and I didnt have any time. Today, I have less money but I have more time for my daughters. 

Maradona, 44, underwent a drugs rehabilitation programme in Argentina and then Cuba after leaving hospital last year and also had a stomach stapling operation in Colombia in March. 

He did not want to commit himself on whether he would accept an offer to take charge of the youth division at Boca Juniors. We have to keep talking, he said. Its a complex contract, not something to sign immediately. If I dont fix up something with Boca, Ill go back to Cuba.

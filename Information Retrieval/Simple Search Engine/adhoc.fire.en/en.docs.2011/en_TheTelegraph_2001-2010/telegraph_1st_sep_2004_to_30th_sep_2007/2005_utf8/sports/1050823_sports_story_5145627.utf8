Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will not ask India to play a one-day match in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir next year, Board chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Monday. India are due to tour Pakistan from January next year, playing three Tests and five one-day Internationals. 

Last Week, Dewan Ali Chughtai, the sports minister of Pakistan occupied Kashmir had said that a request had been made to the PCB to play a match in the capital, Muzaffarabad.

 Chelsea on brink of title

London: Chelsea moved to the brink of their first league title for 50 years with a workmanlike 3-1 victory over Fulham in the west London derby on Saturday. 

The Premier League trophy will belong to Chelsea on Monday if champions Arsenal fail to win their north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur, or next Saturday if Chelsea beat Bolton Wanderers. 

Chelsea are top of the table on 85 points with four games left, followed by Arsenal on 71 and Manchester United, who host Newcastle United at Old Trafford on Sunday, on 67. 

In other action, Everton stayed on course for a fourth-place finish, worth a Champions League qualifying place, despite only scraping a late 1-1 draw with Birmingham City. 

Crystal Palace moved out of the relegation zone on goal difference with a 1-0 upset win over Liverpool ? leaving behind Norwich City, who beat Charlton Athletic 1-0, West Bromwich Albion, who were trounced 4-0 at Middlesbrough, and Southampton. 

Day?s main focus, however, was at Stamford Bridge, where Jose Mourinho?s debut season in English football continued to go from strength to strength for the League Cup winners. 

Joe Cole put Chelsea ahead on 17 minutes, Collins John levelled for Fulham before half-time and Frank Lampard restored the lead on 64 minutes with their 100th goal of the season. (REUTERS)

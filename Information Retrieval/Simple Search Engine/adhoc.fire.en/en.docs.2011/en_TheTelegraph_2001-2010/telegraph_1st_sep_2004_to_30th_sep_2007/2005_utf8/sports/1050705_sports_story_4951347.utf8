 Boonen confirms fastest sprinter status

Tours: Belgian Tom Boonen confirmed he was the fastest sprinter in the Tour de France this year with his second stage win in succession on Monday. 

The Paris-Roubaix and Tour of Flanders winner surged ahead with 50m left to beat Austrian Peter Wrolich and Australian Stuart Grady at the finish of the 212.5-km third stage between La Chataigneraie and Tours. 

American David Zabriskie retained his two-second overall lead over six-time champion Lance Armstrong, who could claim back his favoured yellow jersey in Tuesdays team time trial to Blois. 

Winner of two stages last year, Boonen has already done as well after only three days in the Tour and will be hard to beat for the points classification green jersey.

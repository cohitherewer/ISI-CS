 ?Exclusive? all set to win main event 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Exclusive Affair is all set to complete the formality of winning the 2,200m Pearson Surita Memorial Cup, the main event in Tuesday?s race card.

 Vijay Singh-trainee had placed fourth in the Derby, relegating the second favourite, Moon Emperor, to the fifth slot. There is no denying that the Alnasr Alwasheek-Baro-que Pearl son would have given a tough time to the Derby winner had his educational runs begun earlier than six weeks when he made his debut. C. Alford partners the horse.

Vijay?s Aptitude, too, is fancied to lift the juvenile 

race, the 1,100m Irma La Douce Plate. The horse possesses speed but his baptism 

over a 1,400m race brought about his downfall. The San Francisco-Tirolean Gold 

son may, however, face stiff challenge from Star Stature whose gate manners are, 

however, questionable.

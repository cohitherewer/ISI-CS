 Harikrishna downs top seed

 Harikrishna outwitted Sokolov 

Hoogeveen: World junior champion P. Harikrishna outwitted top seed Grandmaster Ivan Sokolov of the Netherlands in the third round of the crown group of Essent International Chess Tournament here. 

With his second successive victory, Harikrishna took his tally to 2.5 points out of a possible 3 and is now a full point ahead of nearest rivals Sokolov and Emil Sutovsky of Israel. 

Sutovsky defeated womens world champion Antoaneta Stefanova in the other game of the four-player double round robin event. 

As things stand now, 1.5 points should be enough from the remaining three games for Harikrishna to notch another major victory of the year. He recently won the Sanjin Hotel Cup in China. 

It was a fortunate victory alright but I was not as much worse as many might have believed, Harikrishna said after the game. 

His blunder came as a surprise to me but I was already ok by then. I think he should have looked for a draw instead of trying to win. 

In the fifth round of the open section, Parimarjan Negi again missed out on scoring over a much higher rated opponent and drew with GM-elect Erwin Lami of the Netherlands. 

It was in the final position of the game that Negi failed to spot the winning sequence. Grandmaster Vladimir Baklan of Ukraine emerged as the sole leader in this section on 4.5 points.

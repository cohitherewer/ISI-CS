 Reiffel in panel 

Melbourne: Former Test pacer Paul Reiffel was on Thursday included on Australian cricket umpires panel. 

Cricket Australia (CA) said Reiffel and another former first-class player, Rodney Tucker, had served a three-season apprenticeship on its project panel before making the grade. 

Meanwhile, David Shepherd is to retire as an international umpire in July after 40 years in the game. His last Test, his 92nd, will be the second between West Indies and Pakistan, the ICC said. (AFP)

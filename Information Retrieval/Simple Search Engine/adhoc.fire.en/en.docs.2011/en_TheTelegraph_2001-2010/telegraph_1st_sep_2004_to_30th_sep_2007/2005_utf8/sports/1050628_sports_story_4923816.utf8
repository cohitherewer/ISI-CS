 London: FIA president Max Mosley has dismissed fears that Formula One teams could boycott more races after this month?s US Grand Prix fiasco.

 In an interview on Monday, the head of the sport?s governing body also poured scorn on some of those team bosses who have blamed him for the events at Indianapolis. ?The governing body will always win,? he said. ?So I?m not concerned if they (the teams) take an antagonistic line. What are they going to do? If they go on strike, they?re simply cutting off their nose to spite their face. That won?t happen.? 

 New Delhi: The Indian juniors gave a creditable performance on debut, finishing 12th in the world junior golf team championship at the Chukyo Golf Club in Ken, Japan.

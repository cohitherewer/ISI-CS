 Simon Jones uncertain for Pakistan tour

London: England seamer Simon Jones is rated 50 per cent fit for the upcoming tour of Pakistan. The Glamorgan pacer missed the final Ashes Test at The Oval with an ankle injury and faces a scan on the problem on Friday. 

England physio Kirk Russell was quoted by a London daily as: It is very much 50-50 with him. We have a training camp on October 17 and 18 at Loughborough and he needs to be bowling then for him to be declared fit to tour Pakistan. 

If things continue to progress well, we will look to increase the amount of weight the ankle is bearing before Simon starts running again. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indian Oil held by BSF

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Indian Oil were held to a 1-1 draw by BSF (Jalandhar) in the quarter final group league match at the CC amp;FC on Friday. The fancied Indian Oil team, without star Indian strikers Deepak Thakur and Prabhjot Singh (both busy appearing for their graduation exams) was down by a 12th minute goal before they levelled in the 32nd minute. 

The oil company team had better share of proceedings and despite not having played in grass ?for a couple of years?, as captain Viren Rasquinha put it, they moved the ball well and laced it with good interchanging of positions. But lack of quality strikers let them down. 

Marianus Lakra scored a field goal to give the Jalandhar side the lead before Roshan Minz equalised for Indian Oil off a penalty corner. 

In another match at the same venue, Tamil Nadu XI edged Bombay XI by a Balsingh Alfred Aseer-goal in 39th minute. He converted a penalty corner. 

Corps of Signals and Karnataka XI also played a 1-1 draw at the Mohammedan Sporting ground. Ghanashyam Das put Signals ahead. Ronald Kiran restored parity.

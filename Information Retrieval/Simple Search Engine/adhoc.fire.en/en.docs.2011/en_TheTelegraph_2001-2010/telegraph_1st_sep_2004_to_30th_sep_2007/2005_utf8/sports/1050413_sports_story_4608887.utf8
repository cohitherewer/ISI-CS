The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Gerrard doubtful for tie vs Juventus

 - Champions League quarter finals, second leg 

Liverpool: Striker Djibril Cisse and midfielder Xabi Alonso are in Liverpool?s squad for Wednesday?s Champions League quarter final second leg match against Juventus in Turin. 

France international Cisse has been out of action since he broke his leg in two places against Blackburn Rovers in October. Spaniard Alonso has only played in one reserve game since breaking his ankle against Chelsea on New Year?s Day. 

?He (Cisse) is a very powerful player and was a top scorer in all his years in France,? Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez told a news conference at the club?s training ground on Tuesday. 

?He could be important for us at the end of the game. If you have a problem at the end he is a good option. 

?Xabi can play, his ankle?s not a problem. But he may not have the physical condition to play at this level. 

?He is a good passer and can control a game and we have to decide whether he plays from the start or just the second half.? 

Liverpool travel to Turin without inspirational captain Steven Gerrard, who has a groin injury. They beat Juventus 2-1 in the first leg at Anfield last Tuesday but the Italian side won their three home group games 1-0. 

Meanwhile, PSV Eindhoven are one clean sheet away from their first semi-final in Europe?s premier club competition since 1988 when they host French champions Olympique Lyon on Wednesday at the Philips Stadium. 

However, keeping the French side out for 90 minutes will be no easy task as they are the leading scorers in the Champions League to date, having hit 28 goals in their nine matches so far. 

Still, PSV do have the advantage of an away goal from the 1-1 draw in the first leg of their quarter final last week and Lyon will have to take the game to the Dutch side. 

Whoever wins this tie will face either AC Milan or Inter Milan in the semis at the end of the month and in early May, and while PSV do have some past experience to fall back on, Lyon are attempting to sail on into uncharted waters. 

Their only previous appearance in the last four of a European competition came in 1964 when they reached the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners Cup and lost a play-off to Sporting Lisbon. 

Of more immediate relevance however is their 2-2 draw with Nantes in the French League on Saturday ? a result that pleased coach Paul Le Guen who fielded a largely reserve side. Le Guen knows Wednesday?s match is ?do-or-die? and has promised the Dutch champions a tough challenge with his team at full strength and their confidence high. 

Le Guen also believes their away form gives them reason to be optimistic having won at Sparta Prague (2-1), Fenerbahce (3-1) and Werder Bremen (3-0) in the last round, with their only away defeat coming at Manchester United (1-2) last November.

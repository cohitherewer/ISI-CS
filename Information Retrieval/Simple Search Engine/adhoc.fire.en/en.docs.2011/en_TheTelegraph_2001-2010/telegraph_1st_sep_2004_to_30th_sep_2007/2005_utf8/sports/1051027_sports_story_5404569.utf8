The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its advantage Sporting

 - Federation Cup 

 Chidi would be looking to add to his tally of three 

Margao: A close contest is in the offing when Super Cup champions Sporting Clube de Goa take on Salgaocar in the second semi-final of the Alchemist Federation Cup to be played at the Nehru Stadium here on Thursday. 

One Goan team is assured of a berth in the finals to be held on October 30. 

However, Sporting, who play possession football coupled with a sharp attacking game, hold an edge over Salgaocar. 

Salgaocar raised their level of performance in the win against Vasco on Tuesday and would have to play to their potential if they are to upset their rivals, who have not lost to them for the last two years. 

Sporting striker Edeh Chidi, who has scored three goals in the tournament so far, would be looking to increase his tally for the highest scorers award. Chidi has linked well with Dudu Omagbemi. The Salgaocar defence, which looked shaky at times, would have to adopt a strategy to keep them at bay. 

Sporting president Peter Vaz is confident that his team would beat Salgaocar and qualify for the final. 

We have beaten them eight times on the trot and there is no reason why we should not be able to beat them now, Vaz said. Our only fear is complacency, which should not creep into our boys, he added. 

Salgaocar coach Shabir Ali said, our boys have really played well against Vasco in their last match and that should motivate them to play to their potential. The only problem is our strikers, who need to convert the chances that come their way. 

After our performance in the professional leage, no one gave us any chance of going this far and no one had thought that Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Dempo would go out of the Federation Cup early, Ali said, adding, it all depends on the team performance on the given day.

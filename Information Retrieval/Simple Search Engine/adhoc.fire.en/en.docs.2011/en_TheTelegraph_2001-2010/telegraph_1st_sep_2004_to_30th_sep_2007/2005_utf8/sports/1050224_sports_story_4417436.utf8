 ICC ranking to form seedings base 

London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Wednesday said that the official LG ICC one-day championship table on April 1, 2005 will form the basis of seedings for the 2007 World Cup. 

The World Cup in the West Indies will involve a record 16 teams to be split initially into four groups of four. The top two from each group will progress to the Super-Eight stage from which four will qualify for the semi-finals. 

Australia, England, India and the West Indies were pre-seeded into separate groups in July 2004 to ensure that transport, accommodation and other logistical issues in the Caribbean could be managed. 

Subject to this pre-seeding, the 11 teams with current one-day International status will be seeded in the four groups according to their official position in the ODI championship on April 1, the ICC said in a press release. (PTI)

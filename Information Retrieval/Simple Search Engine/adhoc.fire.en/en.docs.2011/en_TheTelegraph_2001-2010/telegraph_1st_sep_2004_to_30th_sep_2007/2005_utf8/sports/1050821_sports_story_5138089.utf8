Istanbul: McLarens Kimi Raikkonen seized pole position for Sundays inaugural Turkish Grand Prix and swept Renaults championship leader Fernando Alonso off the front row. 

The Finn, Alonsos chief rival in the Formula One title race, lapped the Istanbul circuit in 1:26.797 on Saturday to pip Renaults Italian Giancarlo Fisichella by 0.242 of a second. 

It was Raikkonens fifth pole of the season and eighth of his career. 

Spaniard Alonso, who has won six times this season and leads Raikkonen by 26 points with six races left, was third and starts alongside the Finns Colombian teammate Juan Pablo Montoya. 

Indias Narain Karthikeyan was laid low by engine problems and failed to complete the qualifying session. 

The 28-year-old Indian experienced two engine changes in the morning sessions which prevented him from completing any lap. 

Karthikeyan experienced an engine failure because of a defective valve. After the engine was replaced, the second engine also experienced a failure of a different type. 

Karthikeyans teammate Tiago Monteiro was 15th in 1:30.710. 

This time the engine blew and I felt something funny in the first installation lap. Then when I did the timed lap, I heard the engine go... I just could not believe this nor how unlucky I have been this race, Karthikeyan said. 

Starting yesterday with gearbox problems and then consecutive engine problems in the morning? I have not been able to complete any running. It is really a pity, as I needed more laps to continue learning the track and doing more work on the car set-up. 

Raikkonen said, Coming into the last part I ran a little bit wide and locked the rear end so I lost some time but I knew I was quick enough on the first part. 

Yesterday was not perfect but... overnight we changed the car and straightaway it was good and I did a good lap time before the qualifying so we were quite confident. 

But on new circuits you never know really how qualifying is going to be because its quite dusty. Im very happy with the car and how things have gone. 

Alonso was relaxed about the looming battle between McLaren and Renault, who are 12 points clear in the standings, and happy with his lap. 

I think tomorrow we have a good chance to be on the podium and hopefully fighting for the win, he said. We are in a perfect position to do a good result. 

Toyotas Jarno Trulli and Williams Nick Heidfeld filled the third row. 

Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher had a miserable afternoon, spinning off on his timed lap and failing to set a time. Schumacher needed just one more pole position to equal Brazilian Ayrton Sennas record of 65 but that never looked likely after the German struggled in practice. 

BARs Jenson Button, who had been consistently fast in practice, qualified 13th after running wide at turn eight ? a sweeping left-hander that caught Raikkonen out in practice and has proved tricky for all. 

Buttons Japanese teammate Takuma Sato made a similar mistake but compounded his error by dawdling while slowing-down and being overtaken by the Williams of Australian Mark Webber who was on his qualifying lap and was seventh fastest. 

Fisichella said there had been a strong wind on the start/finish line. 

I was a little bit conservative on the first and second part but went very well on the final sector, he said. 

Former champion Jacques Villeneuve spun his Sauber and failed to set a time. Neither did Minardis Dutch driver Robert Doornbos, who pulled over with flames from his rear brakes. (Agencies)

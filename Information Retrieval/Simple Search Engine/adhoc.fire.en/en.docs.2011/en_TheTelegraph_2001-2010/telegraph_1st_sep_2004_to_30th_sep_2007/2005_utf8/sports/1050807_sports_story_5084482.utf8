 Birmingham: Andrew Flintoff outshone Shane Warne to take England to the brink of a series-levelling victory in the second Test over Australia following an enthralling day at Edgbaston on Saturday. 

The world champions, set 282 to win after Warnes six wickets had helped restrict the English second innings to 182, battled to stay in the game until a late clatter of wickets left the home side firmly in control after day three. 

At stumps, Ricky Pontings side, 1-0 up in the five-match series, had struggled to 175 for eight on an increasingly two-paced and uneven Edgbaston pitch. 

Warne, still defiant after sweeping two sixes, was batting on 20. Flintoff, after salvaging Englands innings earlier in the day, took three for 34. 

Warne (6/46) seemed to have set Australia on course for an unlikely victory ? they had been 99 runs behind after the first innings ? as he completed a 10-wicket match haul, his ninth in 125 Tests, to leave him on 599 for his career. 

But all rounder Flintoff restored Englands hopes with a vital 73 runs ? no other home batsman got past 21 ? then produced a lion-hearted performance which included an over to remember. 

England, resuming on 25 for one and with an overall lead of 124, began the morning on top. By lunch they were 95 for six and the game had flipped on its head. 

Strike bowler Brett Lee, who ended with four for 82, made the early inroads with a vitriolic burst of three wickets for four runs in 11 deliveries. 

Enter Flintoff. He and Giles added 30 for the eighth wicket but when Warne got rid of his partner and Harmison with consecutive deliveries boldness replaced caution. 

Australia began confidently before Flintoffs wonder over. 

Brought on with 47 on the board, he induced Justin Langer (28) to edge into his stumps, then softened Ricky Ponting up with a series of booming inswingers and lbw shouts before shaping the ball away. 

Australia needed an anchor but Damien Martyn failed to get a hold, chipping a Hoggard half-volley to Bell at midwicket.

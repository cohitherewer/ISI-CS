 Atwal finishes tied-fifth

 - Ex-pizza delivery boy Petrovic tops 

Avondale (Louisiana): Arjun Atwal carded 73 in last round to end up tied fifth, his second best finish of the season, at the $5.5 million Zurich Classic of New Orleans meet on Sunday. 

The second top-five finish in about a month has put Atwal firmly back on road to ensuring a full PGA Tour card for 2006. 

The 32-year-old, who led the tournament at the midway stage, returned 73 and 73 in the last two rounds even as Tim Petrovic, a former pizza delivery man, beat rookie James Driscoll in a play-off to win his maiden title worth $990,000, after both were tied at 13-under for four rounds. 

With scoring not being easy, Daniel Chopra, putting extremely well on the last two days to rise to his first top-10 finish of the season, ending up tied ninth. 

Chopra ? with rounds of 71, 70, 68 and 71 ? finished at eight-under 280, just one stroke behind his practice partner Atwal. 

Defending champion Vijai Singh tumbled down the ladder with rounds of 67, 71, 73 and 72 to finish five-under 283 in the tied 21st place. 

Atwal received a cheque for $200,000 to cross the $630,000-mark in just five starts. He will need about $750,000 to keep his card and his current form should see him race to that comfortably. 

Atwal finished at one-over and aggregated 279 for a four-way tie with J.J. Henry, Woody Austin and Bo van Pelt. Lucas Glover and Chris DiMarco tied for third, at 12-under. 

The Indian, who was finish at tied second at the Bellsouth Classic four weeks ago, played 26 holes on a long Sunday. He was then placed at 10-under and finished the remainder of the round at even par with one birdie and one bogey. That still kept him in the picture for the final round, which he played in the second group. 

In the final round, Atwal began with two bogeys on first and third and added a third on the sixth, as he looked to be slipping. But a mid-round rally with birdies on seventh, 10th and 11th saw him back at level for the day, before a bogey blotted his book again on par-4 15th. 

Petrovic, who took 14 years to earn a spot on the PGA Tour and used to deliver pizzas to help pay the bills early in his career, holed a 4-foot par putt to beat rookie Driscoll on the first hole of a playoff and became the fourth first-time winner this season.

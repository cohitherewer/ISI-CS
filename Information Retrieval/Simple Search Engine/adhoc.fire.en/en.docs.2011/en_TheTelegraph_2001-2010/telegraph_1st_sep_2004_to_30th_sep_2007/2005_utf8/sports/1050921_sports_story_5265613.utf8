 Raj Singh wants Sunny as CEO

Calcutta: Flaying the BCCI for functioning in what he termed as an unprofessional way on and off the ground, former BCCI chief Raj Singh Dungarpur on Tuesday called for appointing batting legend Sunil Gavaskar as its chief executive officer. 

How can a Board in 2005 run without a CEO? Even Bangladesh and Zimbabwe boards have it, said Dungarpur, who arrived in the city for the BCCIs annual general meeting. 

Drawing instances of unprofessional functioning of the Board in matters related to selling television rights to the recent spat between Sourav Ganguly and Greg Chappell, he said somebody like Sunil Gavaskar should be appointed as the CEO of BCCI. 

Three selectors 

Meanwhile Brijesh Patel of KSCA said that KSCA will bring in a resolution at the AGM for replacing the five-member selection committee with a three-member one. (PTI)

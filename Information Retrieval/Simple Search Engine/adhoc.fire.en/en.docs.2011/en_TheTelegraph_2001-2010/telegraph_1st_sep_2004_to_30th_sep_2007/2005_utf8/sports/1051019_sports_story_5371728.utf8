 New womens body formed

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Ladies Cricket Federation of Bengal (LCFB) has been formed in an attempt to regain the lost glory of womens cricket in the state. Bulbul Gayen, who resigned as West Bengal Womens Cricket Association president recently, has taken over as president of the new body. 

At a press conference on Tuesday, Gayen said that LCFB would not attempt to seek recognition from the national body right now, but would instead focus on building and nurturing talented players. 

Runa Basu is the vice-president of LCFB while Sandhya Majumder and Banusree Das are the joint secretaries. Keya Roy is the treasurer. 

Coaching camps for youngsters are already on at Girish Avenue, Chetla Agrani CCC and East Calcutta District Sports Council. 

The body is also planning to have camps in several districts of the state to unearth hidden talent.

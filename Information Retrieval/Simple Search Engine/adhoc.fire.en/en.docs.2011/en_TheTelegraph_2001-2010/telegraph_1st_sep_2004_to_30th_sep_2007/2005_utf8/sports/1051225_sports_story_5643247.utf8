 Mehra, Rai in title clash 

 - EAST INDIA AMATEUR MEET 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sanjeev Mehras late charge brought him roaring back to a win over Gaganjeet Bhullar to set up title clash with Himmat S. Rai, who defeated Simarjeet Singh in the semi-finals of the Goodricke East India Amateur meet at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club here on Saturday. 

Mehra and Rai won by identical scores of 2-up. 

Mehra has been in sensational form in this tournament. Bhullar too had been showing fine form, but it was not good enough on Saturday. Bhullar began by going 1-up on the first hole, as he parred and Mehra bogeyed, but a birdie on the fourth brought Mehra level. He won the 14th, 15th, 16th and 18th, to reach the final. 

Himmat Rai too came from behind as Simarjeet took the third, but birdies on the fourth and sixth, and a par on the eighth put Himmat two-up. Simarjeet came back winning the ninth and 10th holes to come all square, Himmat went ahead again, winning the 12th but the 13th went to Simarjeet. 

On the decisive 18th hole, Himmat went close to the rough with his tee shot, but a good second landed within four feet of the pin. Simarjeet was in the bunker after his second, leaving him no option but to concede the hole.

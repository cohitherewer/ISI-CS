 Crucial test for Chappell amp; Co. 

 - Toss-up between Kartik and Agarkar for super sub berth Jayasuriya fit 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Jayasuriya in Nagpur on Monday 

Nagpur: The names Chappell, Greg Chappell and I have the license to call the shots in Indian cricket. This silent message has already been conveyed to the Indian cricketers in no uncertain terms. Daniel Craig could take a lesson or two before making his 007 debut. 

Much like James Bond, there are very few problems the Australian cannot handle, even if it means dumping the most successful of Indian captains and taking on the Sri Lankans with an inexperienced side. 

His pride, though, will be put to the sternest test during the Videocon Cup. As Ashok Malhotra said the other day, Chappell has to deliver. A winning start to the seven-match series will be the ideal platform to launch his vision for the 2007 World Cup. The notion that Indian cricket has chosen its men for the future will have to pass the scanner. 

While having to deal with Rahul Dravid is certain to give Chappell more leeway, he will also have the opportunity to work with Sachin Tendulkar. He has already spoken of redefining the Master Blasters role. It remains to be seen how soon Sachin returns to form and how he fits into Chappells scheme of things. 

Understandably, Sachin looked rusty in the Challenger Trophy. But the international scene has always had the adrenaline flowing in him. Having missed the Sri Lanka tri-series and the tour of Zimbabwe after an operation on his troublesome elbow, it is only natural that he will take time to get back the timing and poise. 

Sachins presence is related to the team composition. It is very positive for us that he is back, said captain Dravid. 

It is in the current context that the juniors role will be crucial. How best they can handle the pressure and deliver will determine their future. 

If records are anything to go by, Sri Lanka certainly have the advantage. The visitors are placed second in the ICC rankings while the Indians are seventh. The islanders recent record is encouraging, having defeated India thrice in the recently concluded tri-series at home. 

Dravid, however, does not wish to read too much into those facts. Its hard to label Lankans as favourites, though statistics will say that. Theyve won on most occasions of late, but we will be playing at home. Whoever plays better on a given day will have the advantage, the Team India captain said. 

 Maravan Atapattu ? captain of the Lankan side, which arrived late on Sunday night following a delayed flight from Mumbai ? also wants to play it safe. It will be a closely-fought series. Its nice to have victories under your belt. Lets not worry too much about the oppositions strengths. There are few newcomers in the Indian side and theres a challenge in competing against players about whom you dont know much. But we are a bunch who want to improve everyday. 

Coach Tom Moody was more positive. Were going in with a lot of confidence. Weve come here with a flexible squad. The development of Fervez Maharoof has been exciting, Dilhara Fernando is also getting back into stride. But how they adapt to the conditions will determine their future, explained Moody. 

The Indians have left out Gautam Gambhir and Rudra Pratap Singh from the 15-member squad. It is likely that Sachin will open with Virender Sehwag, though theres talk of pushing Irfan Pathan up the order. The dry nature of the pitch has prompted Murali Kartiks inclusion. The moisture on the wicket may prompt some lateral movement in the early part but things will ease out as the day progresses. The dryness is sure to cause some turn in the second session. 

The contest for the super sub will be between Kartik and Ajit Agarkar, unless the conditions force a change of plans in the morning. Till late on Monday night, S. Sreesanth is set to make his debut. 

Atapattu felt irrespective of the conditions, the toss was important because of the super sub rule. He informed Sanath Jayasuriya was ready to start and dismissed talk of an injury to Muttiah Muralidharan. 

Its the Jayasuriya factor that the inexperienced Indian attack will have to contend with. The homework must have been thorough after Chappell and Co. had a close first-hand look at the Lankans in July-August. Or else?

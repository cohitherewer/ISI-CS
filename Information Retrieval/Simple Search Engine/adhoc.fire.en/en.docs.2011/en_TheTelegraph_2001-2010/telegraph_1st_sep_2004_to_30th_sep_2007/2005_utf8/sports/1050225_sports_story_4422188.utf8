The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Inzy should always look a leader?

 - Sourav is the finest Indian captain: Mushtaq Mohammed 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mushtaq Mohammed 

Lahore: In former captain Mushtaq Mohammed?s 

opinion, Inzamam-ul Haq?s body language is going to have a bearing on the about-to-begin 

India versus Pakistan face-off. 

Mushtaq, it may be recalled, was at the helm during Revival Series No.1 ? back in 1978-79, when India (under Bishan Singh Bedi) got thrashed across Pakistan. 

?Captaincy isn?t only about going for the toss and 

changing the field... A captain has to be a leader on and off the field... Believe 

me, there?s a difference between a plain captain and a captain-leader... Captains 

are many, leaders few,? he told The Telegraph. 

Speaking at the Gaddafi Thursday afternoon, Mushtaq added: ?Inzy?s body language, therefore, will be crucial... He?s carrying an inexperienced team and the youngsters are going to look up to him.... He should always look a leader.? 

Mushtaq, who was himself an astute captain, admitted India was ?blessed? with somebody outstanding ? Sourav Ganguly. ?I have no hesitation in saying he?s the finest Indian captain... Sourav is passionate, is respected... As a leader, he?s ahead (of Inzy)....? 

It?s apparent Mushtaq isn?t too impressed by Inzy?s captaincy.. He isn?t too impressed by the squad picked for the three-Test series as well. 

?In batting, the top three positions are largely unsettled and the less said about our bowling the better... I know many are screaming about Shoaib (Akhtar) but, in my view, it?s probably a blessing that he isn?t going... 

?I say so because I share (Glenn) McGrath?s opinion about Shoaib ? more of a showman and less of a bowler... However, I?m disappointed the selectors have ignored the in-form Shahid Nazir... I don?t see the Mohammed Khalils making an impression,? he pointed out. 

Pakistan, Mushtaq felt, must ?steel? themselves if Team India is to be run close. ?We have a good one-day team, but not so for Tests... Given that, the commitment and determination has to be much higher than seen in Australia...? 

Mushtaq, by the way, is also a former Pakistan coach (he wore that hat when the 1999 World Cup final was reached). Asked if Bob Woolmer was on track, he replied: ?From what I learn, most of his time is going in putting a system in place, not so much working with the boys... He needs time to deliver...? 

The Birmingham-based Mushtaq is in Lahore as coach 

of Pakistan Customs. ?I?m now a freelancer... I?m in Pakistan every winter and, 

for the last two years, have been with the Customs team... I can?t stay away from 

the game,? he signed off.

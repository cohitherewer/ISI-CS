 IN THE CITY

 Two prominent politicians figure in the ruling faction?s panel for the forthcoming Mohun Bagan elections. It was the last day for filing nominations for the September 18 polls.

 Ajit Panja and Subrata Mukherjee were named as candidates for vice-presidents? posts on Wednesday. Neither will have to ?fight? for the posts as, according to a High Court order, there will be no elections for the posts of a president and five vice-presidents. Incumbent president Swapan Sadhan Bose will remain president and Anjan Mitra secretary if the ruling faction wins. The rival panel includes politician Ambika Banerjee, actor Chinmoy Roy, former cricketer Tapan Jyoti Banerjee and former footballer Compton Dutta as candidates for the executive committee. Balaram Chowdhury will fight for the post of general secretary, while the presidential candidate will be decided later.

 Tollygunge Agragami beat George Telegraph 2-0 in a CFL Premier Division match at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Wednesday. Abdul Rauf Khan netted both goals, in the 15th and 70th minutes.

 Tollygunge Agragami ended the first leg with seven points.

 George Telegraph, who remained pointless in seven games, could have avoided that embarrassment had two penalties not been missed. Francis and Anup Biswas were the culprits.

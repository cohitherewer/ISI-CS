The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Finally, a win for England colts

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: England colts finally managed to end their losing streak on this tour defeating their Indian counterparts by five wickets in the third one-dayer at Eden Gardens on Friday. The visitors, who had lost the ?Test? series 0-3, now trail 1-2 in the five-match one-day series. 

England coach Andy Pick was all smiles after the match while admitting there was ?still a long way to go?. Venkatesh Prasad felt a few fielding lapses cost them dear and that they also needed to improve their running between the wickets. 

?If the boys had managed to hold onto a few chances and improved their ground fielding, things could have been different,? lamented Prasad. 

Electing to bat, India lost early wickets putting the middle-order under unnecessary pressure. Manoj Tewari and M. Tehlan were run out needlessly, adding to the confusion. It took a 89-run partnership between Ravi Kant Shukla (85 off 93 balls, 8x4, 2x6) and A.G. Pradeep (34) to steady the innings. 

Ravi Kant was enterprising in his effort, repeatedly using his feet against the slow bowlers and never hesitating to play the lofted shots. The England bowlers seemed lost as he launched into the attack. It was mainly due to his efforts that 65 runs came off the last ten overs. 

England, refused to take any risks. Captain Steve Davies (82 off 115 balls, 8x4) and Joseph Denly (71 off 126 balls, 7x4) put on 160 runs in an opening stand that was sure to put the Indians on the defensive. 

But leg-spinner Piyush Chawla raised visions of an improbable victory picking three wickets in one over. 

However, that was not to be as England batsmen pulled it off in the closing stages. 

Man of the Match Davies, one of the two players in the side from the Academy ? the other being Adam Harrison ? played with a straight bat, picking the gaps. He, though, was lucky to survive once.

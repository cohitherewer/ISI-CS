 No logic behind omission: Borde

 - SOURAV CAN COME BACK, FEEL EX-TEST PLAYERS

Sourav Gangulys hometown continued to boil in the wake of his stunning exclusion from the Ahmedabad Test squad. 

The widespread protests apart, there was a call for the CAB to convene an immediate emergency meeting to condemn the decision taken by the Kiran More-headed selection committee. It came from Sultan Ahmed, a CAB working committee member and former MLA. 

Meanwhile, former Test players continued to flay the selectors, agreeing that the countrys most successful captain did not deserve to be humiliated in such a manner. 

Here is what the former stars had to say: 

MOHINDER AMARNATH: You dont disgrace a senior player like this. Things will change only with a smaller selection panel and there should be no honorary jobs. Selectors should be paid, so that eminent people take it up. 

CHANDU BORDE: This is not the way to treat a person who has done so much for the country as captain and player. First they dropped him from the ODIs? they were forced to take him in the Test squad after he scored heavily in domestic cricket and now they have dumped him despite he performing well in the Test. This is not done. They have dropped Ganguly, a middle-order batsman, and brought in an opener (Wasim Jaffer). Wheres the logic? They called him a batting allrounder and he did not bowl a single over at the Kotla. Can you explain this? If it was done with the future of Indian cricket in mind, the same logic needs to be applied to others too. Why only Sourav?. 

SABA KARIM: They (the selectors) must decide the composition of the squad on the basis of performance. I dont know what prompted them to drop him. Its a shocker. He scored a hundred in Zimbabwe three months ago. In Chennai, everybody including him failed. He batted well in both innings of the Delhi Test and also was involved in two good partnerships. 

S. MADANLAL: It is a very wrong way of expelling him. He should have been given one chance, he should have been allowed to play in the third Test. He should take it boldly and not give up if he still has the ambition of playing for India. He is capable of that and will bounce back. 

SANDEEP PATIL: Its a bold, and at the same time, a tough decision taken by the selection committee. Like in life you have to go forward in cricket too. I feel sorry for Sourav as I have gone through a similar experience. I dont know what exactly were discussed at the meeting among the selectors, coach Greg Chappell and captain Rahul Dravid, but it would have been better had the chairman told the media much more than what he said on why such a decision was taken involving a senior cricketer who had performed well. At the same time, it should be kept in mind that there are players like (Mohammed) Kaif and (Suresh) Raina who are waiting for their chances. Theres lot of competition for middle-order places which is a brilliant sign. But if they talk about the future, why should the rules apply to only one person and not others like V.V.S. Laxman and even Virender Sehwag who fails consistently? Sourav can certainly make a comeback. 

DILIP VENGSARKAR: I dont understand why he has been dropped. He scored runs in both innings of the Kotla Test. I guess the reasons are something other than cricket.

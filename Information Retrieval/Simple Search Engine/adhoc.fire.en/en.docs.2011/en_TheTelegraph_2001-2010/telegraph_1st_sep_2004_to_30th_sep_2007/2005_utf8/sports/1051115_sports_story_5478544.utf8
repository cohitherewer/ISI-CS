 Mamsa passes away

Mumbai: Former Test umpire A. M. Mamsa, who officiated in six Tests between 1964 and 1973, died here at a local hospital on Sunday after a prolonged illness. 

He was 87 and single. 

Mamsa, who also umpired in 80 first class matches, made his debut at the Test level at the Brabourne Stadium here in 1964 when the English team led by M. J. K. Smith visited India to take on Mansur Ali Khan Pataudis home team. 

His last Test was also during an England teams tour, during the 1972-73 visit by the Tony Lewis-led side, in Chennai. Mamsa was also a cricket coach recognised by the Mumbai Cricket Association and had trained several umpires who later officiated in Tests. 

Mamsas benefit match, approved by the Indian cricket board and played between Sunil Gavaskar XI and Dilip Vengsarkar XI, was organised in January 1994 in Bhoisar near Mumbai. (PTI)

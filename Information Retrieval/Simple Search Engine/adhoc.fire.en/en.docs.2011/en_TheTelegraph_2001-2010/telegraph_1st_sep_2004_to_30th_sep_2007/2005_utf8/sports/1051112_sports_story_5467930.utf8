The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Young pool bearing fruit, feels Amre 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The infusion of young blood in Team India, is seen as a step in the right direction keeping in mind the World Cup 2007, feels Praveen Amre, the chairman of the Boards junior selection committee. According to Amre, it is due to the combined efforts of all the junior selectors and the Talent Reserve Development Officers (TRDOs). 

At a press conference at the Eden on Friday, the former Test player said: I am very lucky to have a big batch of talented players, who have the potential to serve India for a long time. Irfan (Pathan), (Suresh) Raina, (Piyush) Chawla, R. P. Singh, Vikram Rajvir Singh, are great talents. 

Getting skilled players who can handle the pressure is very important. Today there is lot of pressure, and in the past also some good players have crumbled under pressure at the top level of the game. For this we have regular session of meditation classes at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). 

Amre, who is in the city for the selection of the under-19 team for the Afro-Asian meet commencing on November 19 in Visakhapatnam. We have a big pool of 25 players whom we can try, out in this tournament. The guys have performed well against the visiting Australian under-19 team in September, where we won 4-1.

 Venus rising from Serenas shadow

 SUE MOTT AT WIMBLEDON 

 Mary Pierce is what you might call a slow starter. For the first set of her quarter-final against the twice former champion, Venus Williams, she moved around the court like an underwater diving bell. Not that fast actually. 

Michelangelos David had more chance of returning Williamss first serve and the result was a very reflective 6-0 set to the American in 21 locomotive minutes. 

A chill wind blew around the Centre Court, part weather, part embarrassment. Womens tennis ought to have outgrown this one-sidedness. 

Pierce stopped performing as though stuck in a pool of aspic and fought all the way to an entrancing 22-point tie-break. By the time she surrendered the match 0-6, 6-7 (10-12) to the elder Williams sister, a genuine contest of traded groundstrokes had been enjoyed by the cheering auditorium. 

A surprising Williams sister now faces Maria Sharapova in the semi-final. Those of an analytical bent might guess that Serenas loss has been Venuss gain. 

As long as the sister was garnering all the titles, the elder was hamstrung by a version of sibling rivalry. There was certainly a look of liberation on the face of the triumphant Williams as she waved to the crowd to receive adulation muted by their traditional rooting for the underdog. 

Venus does less bling than her sister and that includes Grand Slam trophies. Not since the US Open 2001 has she laid hands on the silverware and it seemed her career had gone into free-fall once the youngest scion of the family took over. But now she is out of mental retirement, albeit vastly helped by the Frenchwomans industrial go-slow. 

It was an inexplicably statuesque performance from Pierce in the early stages, with the emphasis on statue. 

It would be unfair to call 30-year-old Pierce a basket case. She is too elegant for that. She is more like a Prada handbag case, after all the family and injury traumas she has suffered, not to mention the battering she received from Justin Henin-Hardenne in the French Open final. 

No pudding for her then but at least she came out fighting for her slice in the second set, despite Williams barking at her like a tigress with a fur ball lodged in its throat. 

You can see that something has happened to Venus. She has awoken as though from a 100 years sleep and perhaps this is not far from the mark. I am like a zombie, she confided. I cant wake up in the morning. But I hate to go to bed at night. I need about eight hours of sleep. Sometimes I just dont get up. I just watch Golden Girls on television. I do get up most of the time. But there are some days I take it slow. 

Thank heavens it was not one of those days Tuesday. Between her being a zombie and Pierce in her trance it would have been like a scene from Shaun of the Dead.

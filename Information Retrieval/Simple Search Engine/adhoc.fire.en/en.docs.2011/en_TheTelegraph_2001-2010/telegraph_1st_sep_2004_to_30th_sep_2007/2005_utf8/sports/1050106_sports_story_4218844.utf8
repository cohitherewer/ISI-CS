The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sohail, Ahmed tip scales for Hyderabad Sultans

 - Premier Hockey League 

 - Baljit Singh Saini gets berth in Jalandhar outfit 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Saini set for a small-stage return 

Hyderabad: Pakistani superstar and world record-holder hockey player Sohail Abbas will be playing for Hyderabad Sultans in the Premier Hockey League which starts at the Gacchibowli hockey complex here from January 13. Hyderabad Sultans is being led by national captain Dilip Tirkey. 

That makes this team look rather strong, what with two more Pakistanis, goalkeeper Ahmed Alam, and former Pak skipper Wasim Ahmed also in fray. Abbas and Ahmed retired after the just-concluded Lahore Champions Trophy. 

The teams were announced here today by Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill. 

The surprise of surprises will be the return to the top class fold of Baljit Singh Saini, playing for Sher-e-Jalandhar, a team that also includes India team reject Baljit Singh Dhillon. And if that was not enough, Dhanraj Pillay, on whom rumours were around even Monday that he will skip the League, was named in the Maratha Warriors squad. 

Jalandhar seems to be a resurrection team. Even Deepak Thakur seems to have recovered enough, suddenly, to be part of the squad. 

The Viren Rasquinha-led Maratha Warriors, irionically, will have Kashif Jawwad of Pakistan to boot. 

In comparison, the other teams somewhat dim. 

Bangalore Hi-Fliers, led by Arjun Halappa, for example, have Muddassar Ali Khan from Pakistan and Kuhan Shanmuganathan of Malaysia. Isn?t a really explosive mix. 

The Ignace Tirkey-led Chennai Veerans also has Spain?s Juan Pablo Escarre in its ranks. 

In the first year of the League the IHF had maintained that it would itself decide on the composition of the players in each team to get a balance of power, so the competitiveness of the league comes to the fore. 

Gill did not disclose the money that the foreign players will be getting. 

The Premier League will be held here, while the tier II matches will be held in Lucknow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Next goal is 600: McGrath

 - Aussie quick surpasses Courtney Walsh 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Glenn McGrath is mobbed by teammates after surpassing Courtney Walsh on Saturday 

Sydney: The legend thats Glenn McGrath keeps growing bigger and bigger. On Saturday, the second day of the Super Test, the 35-year-old New South Welshman became the most successful quick ? surpassing Courtney Walshs record of 519 wickets. 

He did so in style: Drawing level by getting Rahul Dravid (for a duck) with an almost unplayable ball and, then, moving ahead with Brian Laras scalp. The latter decision, leg-before, was taken by Rudi Koertzen after consulting the third umpire. 

McGrath, playing his 113th Test, didnt speak to the Media separately but a statement bearing his signature was made available to The Telegraph. It read: 

Its a big honour because Courtney was a cricketer I looked up to and admired ? a freak of a player who competed for 19 years straight without a break. I cant see myself catching the next two (Shane Warne, Muttiah Muralidharan), but without doubt my next goal is to take 600 Test wickets. 

 McGrath is in no hurry to lead a retired life.

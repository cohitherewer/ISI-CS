The Telegraph - Calcutta

 East Bengal drop Juliano

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal left for Turkmenistan (via New Delhi) Saturday evening without Brazilian striker Juliano Martins. That isn?t the end of his penalty. The club has taken a tough stand against the player?s misbehaviour and Martins is likely to be kept out of the National Football League match vs JCT as well. 

This was punishment for ?misbehaving? with coach Subhas Bhwomick during the AFC Cup match against Muktijoddha Samsad of Bangladesh. 

Martins, thus, is out of East Bengal?s AFC Cup away match against Turkmenistan side Nebitchi FC on Wednesday. 

He will also be out vs JCT on March 21. The club will wait for the coach?s decision before anything is decided on Juliano?s fate. 

Meanwhile, Dipankar Roy, Subhas Chakraborty and Sasthi Duley will join East Bengal side in Delhi for the JCT match. 

Midfielder Chakraborty had been out of action for over nine months after he damaged his ligament.

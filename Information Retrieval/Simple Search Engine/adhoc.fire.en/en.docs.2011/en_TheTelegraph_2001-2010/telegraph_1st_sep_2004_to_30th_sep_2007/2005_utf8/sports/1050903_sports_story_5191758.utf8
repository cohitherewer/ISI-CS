 Jeev Milkha makes cut 

 Jeev Milkha carded a one-over 72 in Round II 

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh carded a one-over 72 in the second round and made the cut comfortably at the 150-million-yen Fujisankei Classic Golf here on Friday. 

The Chandigarh pro had a par round on the first day and was tied for 34th place at the Fujizakura Country Club. 

Jeev opened with a bogey but soon made up with a birdie on the second. Two more bogeys on seventh and ninth saw him turn in two over. 

On the back nine, Jeev seemed to have found his touch as he had three birdies in five holes between 11th and 15th. 

Then came the disaster with two straight bogeys on the closing holes for a days work of 72. His putter just did not do his bidding and took 31 putts for the round. 

The sole leader is Ike-Je J Chang, who after a modest one-under on Thursday exploded with a seven-under 64 and took the top place at eight-under 134. 

Thai star Prayad Marksaeng (65) and overnight co-leader Daisuke Maruyama (68) were tied for second at seven-under 135. (PTI)

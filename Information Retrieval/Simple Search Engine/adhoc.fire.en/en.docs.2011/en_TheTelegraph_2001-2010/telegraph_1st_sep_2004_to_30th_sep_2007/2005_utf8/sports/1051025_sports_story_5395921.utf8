 Corner starts with 6 trainees 

 STAR RACER

 Corner

 Calcutta: RCTC formally communicated Robin Corner the granting of training license under category A on Sunday evening. The jockey-turned-stipendiary steward had applied for it last Tuesday.

 However, Robin did not rue the unduly delay. Yes, Ive a licence to train now. The process does take time. In any case, I dont have a runner for the opening day races, he said.

 The season starts from Thursday. Corner already has six horses in his care and two more from outstation will join his yard soon.

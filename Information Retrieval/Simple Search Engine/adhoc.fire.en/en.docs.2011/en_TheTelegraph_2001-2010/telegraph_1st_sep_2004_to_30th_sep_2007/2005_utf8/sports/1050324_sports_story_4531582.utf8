 Rooney assault charge under probe

Manchester: Police Wednesday began investigation into allegations that England and Manchester United star Wayne Rooney assaulted a student in a night club. 

Greater Manchester Police said they were investigating claims by 22-year-old Patrick Hanrahan that Rooney punched him three times in the head early Tuesday morning in the Tiger Tiger bar. 

?He went absolutely crazy and swung his arms at me,? Hanrahan was quoted as saying in a local newspaper. ?He landed three punches ? two on top of my head and one on the right side of my forehead.? 

Rooney?s spokesman, Ian Monk, said the player was approached by a man ?in a menacing and threatening manner? about his transfer from Everton to Manchester United last August. He denied Rooney assaulted the man. 

?At no stage did Wayne respond,? Monk said. ?The man was immediately asked to leave the night club in the company of security guards.? 

Rooney had been in the bar with United teammates Rio Ferdinand, Wes Brown and Roy Carroll. The alleged incident occurred on the day Rooney, Ferdinand and Brown joined their England teammates at training for Saturday?s World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland.

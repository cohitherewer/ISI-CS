 Aikik grabs Day I spotlight

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Aikik Das of Hooghly grabbed the Day I limelight with a couple of new sub-junior national marks in the state age-group aquatic championships at Subhas Sarobar swimming pool on Thursday. 

In 50m backstroke heat, Aikik clocked 33.06 seconds en route to reaching the finishing tape. That timing helped him better the existing record, held by Maharashtras Sagar Patil by 0.01 second. 

The Hooghly boy continued his fine run in the 50m breaststroke heat as well when he surpassed the mark set by Manipurs Santosh T. Aikiks 35.85 second was enough to erase Santoshs timing of 37.03. 

Meanwhile, Triparna Pal of Hooghly and Riya Sen of Howrah also enjoyed some high-five moments. 

Triparna created a new meet record in 800m freestyle in the girls group I on way to winning the gold. She clocked 10:40.89 seconds. Amrita Das and Mohua Biswas won the silver and bronze, respectively, in the event.

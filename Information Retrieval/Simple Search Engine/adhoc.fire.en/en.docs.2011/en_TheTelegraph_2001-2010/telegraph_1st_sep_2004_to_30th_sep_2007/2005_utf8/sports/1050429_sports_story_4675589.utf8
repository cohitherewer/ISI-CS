 Sourav alone not to be blamed: Wadekar

A STAFF REPORTER

 Ajit Wadekar 

Calcutta: Former captain and coach Ajit Wadekar feels that Team India members, including coach John Wright, have to share the blame for the six-match ban on captain Sourav Ganguly. 

?As a captain of the side, one has to keep track of many things. It may not always be possible to keep an eye on the over-rate. Bowlers needed to be careful and are to be blamed. The coach, who has a laptop, could also have sent word to the captain,? Wadekar said at Deshbandhu Park, where he was present as a guest at the under-16 cricket final. 

Wadekar, sympathetic to Sourav, termed the incident as unfortunate, but hoped to see him back in form very soon. ?I think he should immerse himself in practice. He should concentrate hard at nets to get over the prolonged bad patch,? he said. Wadekar felt that the break would help him get back into rhythm. 

On whether it would be easier for Sourav to return to form if he was back as opener in the ODIs, Wadekar said when a batsman was attuned to a certain batting position, he should stick to it. ?Being a skipper he had to sacrifice his position for players like (Virender) Sehwag.? 

The former India coach-cum-manager reminded that all greats from Sir Don Bradman to Sunil Gavaskar have gone through bad phases and Sourav is also going through one. ?The only thing is his run drought has been extended, may be because being the captain he could not concentrate that much on batting,? he opined. 

Wadekar disagreed that a County stint can help him get back to form. ?He has already played for Lancashire and so he has passed that phase.? 

Reverting to the topic of foreign coach, Wadekar felt no need for a foreign coach as the Indian coaches are quite competent enough. 

According to Wadekar, when a captain loses form it also has an impact on the team. ?It does affect captaincy, because in his sub-conscious state, he may be thinking about it,? he said.

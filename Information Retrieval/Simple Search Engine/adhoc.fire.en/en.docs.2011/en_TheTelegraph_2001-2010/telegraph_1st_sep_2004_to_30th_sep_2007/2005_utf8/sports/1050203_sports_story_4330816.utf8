 Wellington to host 4th ODI

Wellington: Wellington?s Basin Reserve will host the fourth of five limited-overs cricket Internationals between Australia and New Zealand on March 2, New Zealand Cricket said on Wednesday. 

The match was transferred from Hamilton?s Westpac Park because of concerns about pitch conditions. 

The Basin Reserve, which has a capacity of 9,500, was replaced as an ODI venue in Wellington six years ago by the larger Westpactrust Stadium. The stadium is already scheduled to host one match in the five-match series. 

?The Basin was a nice fit and being the fourth game of the five-match series it has the makings of a special occasion,? NZC chief executive Martin Snedden said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No need to head for drawing board

 - Learning from mistakes is important: Greg Chappell 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Colombo: The almost unimaginable defeat at Sri Lankas hands on Wednesday notwithstanding, coach Greg Chappell isnt returning to the drawing board. Not yet. 

Its not necessary... I accept we had a result which wasnt pleasant, but theres no need to head for the drawing board... Learning from mistakes is important, he told The Telegraph after a soul-searching session by the Taj Samudra pool on Thursday evening, a few hours after arriving from Dambulla. 

Chappell added: Theres disappointment, not despair. 

Despite having the hosts gasping at 95 for six, in the 26th over, India lost the tri-series match by four wickets. At this point, to make the August 9/10 final, beating the West Indies is an absolute must. 

Chappell didnt dwell on the nearly hour-long soul-searching, but one learns he talked of (a) the need to take responsibility; (b) the pain of failing to convert a strong position into a winning one and (c) allowing an Upul Chandana to post an excellent finish. 

Apparently, there was also a discussion over the failure of the non-regular fifth bowler(s). It has cost us dear, yet its to be seen whether Chappell and Rahul Dravid have the courage to drop a batsman and field Anil Kumble. 

Sadly, thus far, our most experienced bowler has been a passenger. 

Sourav Ganguly, meanwhile, looked far happier at having entered the 10,000 club. The night before, he wasnt anywhere remotely close to being over the moon. 

After losing from that position, how could I have been happy? Today, I can sense the achievement more and Im delighted at getting to where I have... I havent proved a point to anybody, though, Sourav said, speaking exclusively. 

The former captain even insisted his omission from the Asia squad was now a thing of the past: For me, that chapter is firmly closed... I wont gain by continuing to talk about it... 

Sourav did well to get 51 on his post-ban comeback. Much, however, is to be done ? by him and Team India. 

On the fitness front, both Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan are available for selection. They missed the return match against Sri Lanka, though Yuvraj was rushed as a substitute when Mahela Jayawardene and Chandana were scoring at will. 

Bus, dawai kha ke field mein chale gaye... Zaroorat thi, Yuvraj quipped.

 Sasi starts with win

Hyderabad: Top seed Krishnan Sasikiran scored an easy victory over Pavel Gnusarev of Kazakistan in the opening round of the 5th Asian Chess Championsip at the KVBR Indoor Stadium here on Thursday. 

Playing white pieces with Nimzo Indian defence, Sasikiran dominated the proceedings to suffocate his opponent with a sharp strategic middlegame. He won in an hour and 19 minutes, requiring just 26 moves and justified his top billing. 

The other Indians ? P. D. S. Girinath and Ponnuswamy Konguvel ? went down to their respective rivals. 

Girinath lost to Anh Dung Nguyen of Vietnam, while Konguvel lost to Sushanto of Indonesia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan face uphill task vs Md. Sp. 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Beleaguered Mohun Bagan will be hoping to keep alive their IFA Shield semi-final hopes when they take on Mohammedan Sporting in a crucial tie on Tuesday. 

Having been routed 1-4 by arch-rivals East Bengal ? who have almost made it to the semi-finals ? Mohun Bagan coach Amal Dutta faces an uphill task at a time when the club is still debating goalkeeper Subrata Pals role on Sunday. 

The coach refused any comment on the Pal controversy, but the goalkeeper didnt take part in practice. A senior official reiterated that till Pal didnt reply to the showcause notice, he wont be allowed to practise. 

The Mohammedan Sporting camp is also yet to get over coach Biswajit Bhattacharyas sudden resignation, but they know a draw will help the team emerge group winners. That would help them avoid a clash with Bayern Munich ? who are landing in the city on Tuesday ? in the semis. 

In Tuesdays other match, JCT will clash with Ever-Ready.

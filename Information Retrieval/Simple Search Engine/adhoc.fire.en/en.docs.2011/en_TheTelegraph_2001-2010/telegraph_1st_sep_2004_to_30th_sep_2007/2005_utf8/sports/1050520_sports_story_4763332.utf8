New Delhi: Mohinder Amarnath, Greg Chappell, Desmond Haynes, Tom Moody... That was the batting order for the Team India coach interviews on Thursday. The Telegraph caught up with each candidate and the following are excerpts from the one-on-ones as also the quartets interaction with the Media in general: 

Mohinder: I did have a nearly two-hour interaction, but Im used to playing a long innings! I always gave a hundred per cent on the field and it wasnt any different this afternoon... Im satisfied with the presentation I made and the interaction was healthy... My experience was, I would say, the USP of my presentation... Yes, the remuneration bit was touched upon, but money is secondary. For me, thats not an issue... I didnt ask for either an assistant or a specialist bowling coach as one should be good enough to do the job all alone. 

Chappell: The vibes were positive and the questions encouraged me... I know I had to wait over an hour-and-half, but I kept calm ? it was like waiting for my turn to bat as the opener was making runs! I didnt get worked up, because things werent in my hand... I wouldnt say my presentation was cut short because two of the interviewers had to leave just after five clock... Our interaction could have continued, but we would probably have touched upon the same points... Ive applied knowing the calendar is going to be tight (till the 2007 World Cup). Was this interaction different from the one in 2000? No. 

Haynes: The colour of my skin sure makes me the dark horse! Seriously, though, I think Ive got the best credentials if the focus is on the next World Cup... No one knows conditions in the West Indies better than I do... Coaching India is a very big job, but Im a good communicator and communication plays the biggest role... This call from the BCCI did surprise me... I felt honoured as well. Did I have time to prepare? Actually, most of my time went in procuring the visa! Ive been following Indian cricket and Im aware India squandered a 2-0 lead in the recent ODIs against Pakistan... Look, irrespective of who gets the job, Indian cricket will benefit. 

Moody: Im happy with the interview and presentation... If I look tired, its because of the wait and not what happened inside closed doors... I cant, of course, say what the committee made of my presentation... The Indian team has experienced and exciting batsmen; young and talented bowlers... Blending them is going to be the challenge... My age (39) isnt a disadvantage as Ive got coaching experience... Im aware that Steve Waugh endorsed my candidature ? its nice to have the backing of somebody with his stature.

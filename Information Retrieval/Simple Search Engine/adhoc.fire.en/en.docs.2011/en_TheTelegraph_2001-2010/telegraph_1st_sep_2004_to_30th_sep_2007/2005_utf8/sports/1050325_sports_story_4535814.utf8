 Bennet King tries to remain optimistic

 - West Indies coach feels absence of 7 players opens up doors 

 King wants to pay attention to the personal as well as the technical side of things 

London: West Indies coach Bennet King tried to remain optimistic for next week?s first Test against South Africa, despite the contract dispute robbing him of seven players, including skipper Brian Lara. 

Lara was left out of the squad by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) after failing to reach agreement over personal endorsement contracts. 

Lara, like vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan, Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, Dwayne Smith, Fidel Edwards and Ravi Rampaul, has a personal sponsorship deal with Cable amp; Wireless, meaning a potential clash with the West Indies? main sponsor Digicel. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul will lead the team in Lara?s absence for the first Test starting in Georgetown next Thursday. 

?I think it?s disappointing that the seven (the Cable amp; Wireless players) are not there, whatever the reasons, but it opens up opportunities for other players to show what they?re worth,? Australian King told a local daily. 

The depleted squad of 14 arrived in Barbados for a pre-series training camp, with negotiations regarding their participation still on. 

?We?ll be working hard over the next five days to get everyone as properly prepared as possible for what is going to be a tough series,? King added. 

?In the circumstances, we?ll pay attention to the personal as well as technical side of things.? 

Meanwhile, South Africa captain Graeme Smith says his team will make the best of a difficult situation when they take on a depleted West Indies side. 

?It is obviously a very difficult situation for all concerned,? Smith said in a United Cricket Board media release in Durban on Wednesday before the squad left for the Caribbean. 

?I just hope they reach a settlement soon. But rest assured that whoever we face on the tour we will be giving 100 percent at all times, because the West Indies can never be underestimated on their home soil.? 

South Africa lost their first home Test series to England in 40 years in January before bouncing back to win the one-dayers. 

They then achieved an emphatic but expected win in a home series against Zimbabwe earlier this month. 

?It?s important that we take the momentum gained from the end of the England tour and the Zimbabwe series and use it to build a really cohesive, powerful unit,? Smith said. 

?We have a had a tough summer at home, but have moved forward in many areas. 

?It has been good to see new players like A.B. (de Villiers) and Charl (Langeveldt) make names for themselves as well as those who have returned to the national set up like Monde Zondeki and Ashwell Prince. 

?They now have a chance to prove themselves under very different conditions in the Caribbean.? 

The tour of the West Indies will be South Africa?s third. 

In 1992, Kepler Wessels? side lost all three one-day Internationals and a one-off Test ? South Africa?s first after 22 years of isolation due to Apartheid. 

Shaun Pollock then led South Africa to a 2-1 triumph in the Test series and a 5-2 win in the one-day matches in 2001. 

Pollock has remained in Durban to receive treatment for chronic tendinitis in his left ankle. 

The all rounder has been ruled out of the first test, and will join the tour once he has recovered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bengal Tigers blasted again

Hyderabad: Big cats no more, Bengal Tigers were again thrashed in the Premier Hockey League?s tier-II, this time at 7-0, and by Chandigarh Dynamos. 

The match petered to nothing after the first two quarters and there was no stopping the table toppers (12 points from four encounters) at the Gacchibowli Stadium in Hyderabad Friday. 

The team from Bengal did give a fight in the first two quarters, but their forwards were wayward in their shooting. 

Rajpal Singh scored in the fourth minute, finishing an attack which started from the middle of the circle. 

Jugraj Singh made it 2-0 with a clever penalty corner conversion as he moved one step in to avoid the first runner, and flicked into the right corner of the net in the 10th minute. 

Then Harbhajan Singh deflected a Navdip Singh back-centre into the circle from the right in the 25th minute before Rajpal struck once again for an opportunistic goal from top of the circle. 

In the third quarter and Navdip Singh scored a peach of a goal. 

He went on a solo from the 25-yard line on the left flank and shot a superb reverse hit from a difficult 45 degree angle which brooked no answer from substitute Bengal goalkeeper. 

Then Sardar Singh went on a solo, and after a return pass, found the mark with ease and Ravi Pal Singh rounded off the tally 7-0 deflecting a ball which was initiated by Olympian SS Gill.

 Thorpe to play for NSW

London: England batsman graham Thorpe could be set to play his last Tests on home soil having announced Wednesday he had agreed a contract with Australian state side New South Wales. 

Left-handed batsman Thorpe, who is set to make his 99th Test appearance against Bangladesh at Lords Thursday, has been widely expected to announce his retirement from international cricket after this seasons home ashes series against Australia. 

He is not due to arrive in Sydney until January, meaning he would be available for the tour to Pakistan but out of contention for Englands post Christmas tour of India. 

Thorpe, 36 in August, said: at this stage of my career, it makes sense to start planning for the future and this is an excellent opportunity for me to develop my career in a new environment. 

I informed (England coach) Duncan Fletcher and (England chairman of selectors) David Graveney of my plans yesterday and have also assured them that as far as this summer is concerned, I will be giving all my attention to the forthcoming Test series against Bangladesh and Australia. 

An England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) statement also said Thorpe would play for an unnamed Sydney Grade club side.

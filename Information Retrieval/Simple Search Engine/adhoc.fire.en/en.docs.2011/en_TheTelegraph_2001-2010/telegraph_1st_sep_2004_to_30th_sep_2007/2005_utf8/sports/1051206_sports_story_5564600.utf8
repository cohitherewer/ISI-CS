 Two Zimbabwe cricketers arrested

Harare: Police arrested two Zimbabwe national cricket team players and an official on charges of violating foreign exchange regulations, a state daily reported on Monday. 

The newspaper reported that long-serving national team manager Mohammed Meman and players Vusi Sibanda and Waddington Mwayenga were arrested on Saturday. 

Sources within Zimbabwe cricket said last night they had been informed that the police were also interested in questioning at least six more players over their offshore foreign currency accounts and transactions, the newspaper said. 

The paper said the arrests followed investigations by Zimbabwes central bank into the cricket leagues financial affairs. 

Problems at Zimbabwe cricket led to the resignation of the teams captain Tatenda Taibu. (AFP)

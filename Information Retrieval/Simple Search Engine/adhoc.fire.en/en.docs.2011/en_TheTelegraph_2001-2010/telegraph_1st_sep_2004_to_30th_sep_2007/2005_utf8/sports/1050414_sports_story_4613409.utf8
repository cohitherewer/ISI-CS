The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tolly keep fingers crossed

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Despite the threat of relegation hanging over their shoulder, Tollygunge Agragami coach Biswajit Das is hopeful that they will be able to remain in the elite National League provided they tread cautiously. 

?I don?t have the bench strength nor the players to launch an all-out attack. We have to play according to our potential and I believe that will see us through,? Das said on Wednesday, the eve of their 17th round National Football League for ONGC Cup match against Salgaocar SC. 

?We won?t be playing defensive football, but will look to play to our strength. If that means getting only one point, then also I will be satisfied.? 

Tollygunge will miss injured Suman Dutta, while goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh too is doubtful. Suley Musah is likely to play as inside half. 

Salgaocar, also struggling to avoid relegation with 19 points ? four more than Tollygunge ? will miss the services of Bernard Pires and Roberto Fernandes from injury. They had hammered Tollygunge 5-1 in the first phase, but coach Savio Medeira feels that it will be a tough match Thursday.

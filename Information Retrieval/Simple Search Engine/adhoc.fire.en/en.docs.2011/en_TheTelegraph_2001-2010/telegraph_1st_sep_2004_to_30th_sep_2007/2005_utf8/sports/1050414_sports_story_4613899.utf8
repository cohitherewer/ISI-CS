Calcutta: The title once again eluded Army XI as they went down 1-2 to BSF Jalandhar in the final of the 110th Indian Oil all-India Beighton Cup at the CC amp;FC on Wednesday. 

Harpinder Singh and Marianus Lakra scored for the winners, while Dhanujay Mahadik found the net for Army XI. 

The armymen, who were runners-up to Punjab and Sind Bank last year, failed to convert the chances that came their way. And they were ready with their excuses, not comfortable playing on grass. 

The tenacity they showed in the come-from-behind semi-final win against Indian Oil was largely missing this day. Yet, they earned eight penalty corners, but to no avail. 

However, it was the team from Bangalore, led by Indian international Ignace Tirkey, who took the lead after barren first two quarters. Harpreet Singh, latching on to a ball at their own half, raced up to the opposition box. 

He played a one two with Binay Kujur before rolling it on to the path of Dhanujay Mahadik. Mahadik dribbled past one defender, entered the D and fired home in the 40th minute to give army the lead. 

The goal seemed to spur BSF on as they went in search of an equaliser. Allowing the armymen to do all the running in the previous quarters, the team from Jalandhar gradually started showing better adaptability to grass. Man of the Match Harpinder Singh, Sushil Kujur, Marianus Lakra and captain Habil Topno started using the flanks, interchanging positions and sending long balls to the opposition 16-yard box forcing the army team to defend deep. 

The equaliser came in the 44th minute. Harpinder picking up the ball in a goalmouth scramble and pushing it just out of reach of Palaksha. 

With the scores tied at the end of third quarter, one hoped the army team to come out with all guns blazing. But it was BSF who seized the initiative as Marianus deflected a corner to make it 2-1. 

The winning team was richer by Rs 1,25,000 while the runners-up received Rs 75,000. Indian Oil was given the Fair Play award.

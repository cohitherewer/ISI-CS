Lahore: After below-par performances against Pakistan in the first two matches, India would be looking to score a comprehensive victory in the third and last match to win the National Bank football series in style. 

Though India dictated terms in the first match, the hosts ended up with a creditable 1-1 draw in Quetta. The second match played Thursday again saw the Indians dictating terms but in the end only managed a solitary goal win, scripted by substitute Abdul Hakim in the 66th minute. 

On the other hand, Pakistanis must be hoping that if they can gain more control in the midfield then they could trouble the visitors ranked 35 places above them at 135 in the latest Fifa ratings. 

The Pakistanis managed to stretch the Indians with quick counter attacks in Peshawar Thursday but such periods were few and far in between long spells of Indian superiority. 

India would again be looking for another inspired display from their skipper S Venkatesh, who was voted by the AIFF as the best player in the last season. 

Venkatesh excelled in both the matches and it was his long ball that was converted into the winning goal by Hakim in Peshawar. 

Despite being billed as the Friendship Series, Pakistan Football Federation officials said they are thinking of a penalty shoot-out to determine the series if it ends in a deadlock. 

PFF officials said a final decision will only be taken at a managers meeting before the start of the floodlit match.

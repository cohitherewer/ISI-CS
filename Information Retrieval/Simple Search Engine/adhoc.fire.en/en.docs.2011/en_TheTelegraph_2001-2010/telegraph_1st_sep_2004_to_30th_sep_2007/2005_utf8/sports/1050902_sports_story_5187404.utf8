 Narain: Fast corners a big challenge

Monza: Narain Karthikeyan, who will not be driving the new Jordan car in the Italian Grand Prix here, on Thursday said that he would concentrate on finishing the race to see the difference between the old and the new cars. 

He also said that he would not take Fridays free practice casually, and instead, would use it as a preparation for race day. 

I would like to finish the Monza race. It will be interesting to see the difference between our two cars, Karthikeyan said. 

After driving last week, I am ready for at least 60 laps for the qualifying practice, to prepare for the race here. I hope Ill have a less miserable weekend than in Turkey where I had only 20 laps or less on the track to prepare the car for race day, he said. 

The 28-year-old Indian arrived on Thursday at the historic Monza circuit, near Milan, for the 15th race of this F1 season. He tested with the new EJ15B for three days, covering almost 1400 kilometres, at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza. 

The four drivers of the team ? Narain Karthikeyan, Tiago Monteiro, Nicolas Kiesa and Nicky Pastorelli ? all contributed to the programme. 

I am brave and crazy for sure, the Italian GP is known for the highest average and top speeds of the season. In Monza, a fast lap time requires very high straight-line speeds and therefore low drag and hence a low down force configuration, Karthikeyan said. 

He added that it would be a challenge to drive on the circuit with increased competition within the team as Monteiro drives the new, modified EJ15B. He added that it was quite encouraging to see that his team had been able to close the time gap with other teams. 

I really like the fast and quick corners on this track as opposed to slower tracks. 

Karthikeyan also said the track would be a real test for the efficiency of engines and brakes of the cars.

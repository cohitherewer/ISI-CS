 Jeev tied 11th in Japan meet

Kochi (Japan): A closing birdie on the 18th hole ensured a sub-par round for Jeev Milkha Singh on the opening day of the 140 million yen Casio World Open, the penultimate event on the Japanese mens Tour. 

Jeev, who missed out on making it to the US Qualifying Schools final stage, was lying in the tied 11th position at the end of the first day at the Kochi Kuroshio Country Club. 

The lead is shared by Toshimitsu Izawa and Yoshiaki Kimura. 

Jeev, starting out on the first, bogeyed the third but birdies on seventh and ninth meant he made the turn in one-under. 

But a bogey on 16th brought him to par again before a birdie in the par-five closing hole gave him some satisfaction.I was still having problems with putting, said Jeev, who took 30 putts to complete his round. 

Michelle Wie, playing in a mens tournament for the first time since turning professional, turned in an impressive one-over 73 and was lying 42nd, as the cut looked like coming at three-over. 

This is Wies first event since she was disqualified last month in her pro debut at the LPGA Tours Samsung World Championship. She was penalised and disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard after dropping her ball closer to the hole.

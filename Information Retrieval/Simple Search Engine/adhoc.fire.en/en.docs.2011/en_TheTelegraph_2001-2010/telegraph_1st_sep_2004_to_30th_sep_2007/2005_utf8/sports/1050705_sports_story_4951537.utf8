 Bala Devi, Sushmita, Shanthi shine

Bangalore: Tamil Nadus S. Shanthi set a national record in womens 3000m steeplechase on the second day of the 45th national and inter-state senior athletics championship here on Monday. 

The 24-year-old, who had won the 1,500 silver on Sunday, came home in 10 minutes, 44.65 seconds at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium. He thus erased the 10:52.12 mark of Karnatakas L. Manjula, set in New Delhi in March 2004. 

Bengals Y. Bala Devi set a meet mark in womens 20km walk, clocking 1 hour, 44 minutes, 37 seconds to better Yasmin Kaurs 1::45:28.36. Bala Devis performance was below-par as she fell short of her own national mark (1:45:06.03). 

Sushmita Singha gave Bengal the second gold in womens high jump. Her leap of 1.73 metres was good enough to push Tamil Nadus M. Sangeetha (1.70) and D. Karupuramala (1.65) to second and third places, respectively. 

Delhis Sandeep Sarkaria bagged gold in the mens 100m clocking 10.45 seconds. Tamil Nadus H. Jayachandran and Vilas Neelagund of Karnataka both finished in 10.47. 

Keralas K.M. Greeshma emerged the fastest woman, breasting the tape in 11.94 seconds. 

Shakti Singh expectedly won the mens shot put with a below-par effort of 18.80 metres. Shamsher Singh of Rajasthan won the mens long jump gold with an effort of 7.66.

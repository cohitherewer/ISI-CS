Bridgetown: Brian Lara smashed a majestic 130 (as reported in Fridays Late City edition) to lift the West Indies to a total of 345 on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan at the Kensington Oval on Thursday. 

Pakistan struck back in the final session, however, claiming the last six West Indies wickets before Shahid Afridi and Salman Butt took the touring side to 22 without loss at the close. 

The 36-year-old Lara raced to his 29th Test hundred and third in four matches, helping his team recover from 45 for three along with captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul who made a gritty 92. 

Lara, rested for the recent one-day series which Pakistan swept 3-0, faced just 120 balls and hit 16 fours and four sixes, reaching his century by lifting leg-spinner Danish Kaneria over the long-off boundary. 

The duel between Lara and the 24-year-old Kaneria dominated the afternoon session in which only one wicket fell as the prolific left-hander added 169 runs for the fourth wicket with Chanderpaul. 

Lara hit Kaneria for several fours and four sixes but the leg-spinner had the last laugh when he bowled the former West Indies captain through the gate with a ball that turned a long way. 

It was Laras second successive hundred at the Kensington Oval following his 176 against South Africa last month. 

 The West Indies resumed after tea on 246 for four, but Wavell Hinds was run out for 28, Kaneria dismissed Chanderpaul and Courtney Browne, Daren Powell, Reon King and Fidel Edwards fell cheaply as the hosts collapsed. 

Kaneria finished with three for 114. Seamers Abdul Razzaq and Shabbir Ahmed also claimed three wickets. 

Shabbir had struck two early blows in the morning session, removing Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan to leave the West Indies struggling on 25 for two after choosing to bat. 

Razzaq sent back Devon Smith as the home side slumped to 45 for three before Lara and Chanderpaul fought back.

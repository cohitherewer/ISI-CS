 Best pleads innocence 

 - CHILD ASSAULT CASE 

London: George Best is totally innocent over allegations he indecently assaulted a young girl, the former Manchester United stars agent insisted Tuesday. 

The retired Northern Ireland winger, now 59, was arrested last week on suspicion of having assaulted a girl under the age of 13, police said Monday. 

Best, who last week was also questioned by police over a separate claim he punched a friend of his ex-lover, is alleged to have attacked the girl last month. 

We have received an allegation of indecent assault against a 59-year-old man who was arrested on June 9, a spokesman for Surrey police said. The allegations concern a girl under the age of 13, and the incident is said to have taken place in May, the spokesman said. Were not prepared to discuss details of this investigation any further. 

Bests agent Phil Hughes described the claims as outrageous and totally unfounded. 

George is totally innocent, he said. We will defend this vigorously. 

There have been so many lies printed about George that we have let slip through because you cannot sue everybody. (But) we will certainly be suing the people who made these allegations once we have proven his innocence. 

Last week Best spent more than nine hours at a police station being questioned about an incident when he allegedly punched a 34-year-old woman outside the home of his ex-lover, Gina Devivo.

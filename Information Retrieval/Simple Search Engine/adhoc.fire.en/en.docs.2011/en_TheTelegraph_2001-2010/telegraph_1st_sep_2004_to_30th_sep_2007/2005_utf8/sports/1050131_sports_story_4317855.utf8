Madrid: Leaders Barcelona produced a devastating second-half display to power their way to a 4-0 win over Sevilla on Saturday and inflict a first home defeat of the season on the Andalucian side. 

Inspired by a rejuvenated Ronaldinho, the Catalans got the crucial breakthrough in what had been a delicately balanced encounter when leading striker Samuel Eto?o scored his 16th goal of the season with a top-class finish early in the second half. 

An own goal by Julio Baptista, a clever shot by Ronaldinho and a drilled finish from Ludovic Giuly completed what was a much harder victory than the scoreline would suggest. 

The win against fourth-placed Sevilla left Barca 10 points clear at the top over rivals Real Madrid, who can narrow the gap to seven if they win at basement side Numancia. 

Earlier, Atletico Madrid won their first game in five outings when they came from behind to notch a 3-1 victory at home to Albacete that took them up to ninth in the table. 

Visitors Albacete scored the goal of the day as Francisco gave them the lead when he beat Atletico keeper Leo Franco from 45 metres after collecting the ball inside his own area after a corner. 

But it was to no avail as a Fernando Torres penalty, a precise shot from playmaker Ariel Ibagaza and a fine header from former Albacete defender Pablo Ibanez allowed the home side to wrap up a comfortable win before halftime. 

Although Barcelona were subjected to some heavy pressure in the opening minutes, they had the better chances at the start of a pulsating encounter at the Sanchez Pizjuan. 

Sevilla keeper Esteban produced several excellent reflex saves to stop early efforts from Eto?o and Ronaldinho, but the home side responded well and gave the Catalans a series of scares midway through the half. 

The 45,000 capacity crowd was left seething soon after when the referee turned down successive penalty appeals after Antonito appeared to have been brought down in the area and Juliano Belletti handballed as he tried to head away a cross. 

But it was Eto?o who broke the deadlock early in the second half as he made the most of his electric pace to scorch past two defenders and latch onto a superb through-pass from Ronaldinho. 

The Cameroon international rounded Esteban and then threaded the ball between two diving defenders and the near post to put the visitors ahead. 

Barca were gifted a second six minutes later when Brazilian striker Julio Baptista headed into his own net after he was caught off guard by a Rafael Marquez flick-on from a corner. Sevilla were still reeling from the setback when Eto?o and Ronaldinho combined once more to deal the knockout third. 

Giuly had his shot blocked after Eto?o cut back a neat pass from the byline but the ball fell to Ronaldinho who dinked it back across the area and into the top corner. Giuly wrapped up the win as he helped himself to the fourth goal 17 minutes from time when he glided onto a through ball from Xavi and drilled an angled shot inside the far post. 

3rd loss for Udinese 

Udinese suffered their third Serie A defeat in a row, when they lost 0-1 to Parma on Saturday, add reports from Milan. The defeat, which followed losses to AC Milan and Reggina, meant Udinese remained a distant third in the standings on 34 points, 13 behind leaders Juventus. 

Udinese fell behind after 34 minutes, when Italy striker Alberto Gilardino nodded a deflected cross past keeper Morgan De Sanctis for his 10th goal of the season. 

In an earlier match, Chievo Verona climbed six points clear of the relegation zone with a 1-0 win over Livorno. 

The result lifted Chievo to 13th on 25 points in the 

20-team division.

 RCTC miffed at betting impasse 

 STAR RACER

 Daniel Davids Wayward King and Native Son had gone to the start as 7-4 and 8-10 favourites in the their respective events at the RCTC ground on August 3.

 Odds offered on the two horses at the Bangalore off course betting were almost identical. However, it was not the case with the stables another runner, Generous Gift, who remained a firm favourite at 6-4 in the citys betting ring while there were no takers for him in Bangalore.

 The closing price of the horse there was 7-1, which clearly indicated that there was something amiss that the city punters were unaware of. In the race, the Defenders of Sea Handicap, the four-year-old fully justified his Bangalore odds by finishing a poor fourth.

 The RCTC, too, did not take to the whole affair very kindly. The clubs secretary, Boman Parakh, expressed stewards concern about the bizarre turn of events but no immediate remedy was at hand, he felt.

 The possible way to stop such a menace, which may safe guard the RCTC punters interest, could be the announcement of the closing odds in the Bangalore ring.

 But RCTCs business manager, Subir Dasgupta, was unsure if the MoU between the host and the off course centres would allow such a practice. Parakh may take up the matter with the Turf Authorites of India (TAI) in a meeting next month.

 The competition, in rest of the seven-event card, was otherwise of high order, though trainer Errol Bhungards priced double ? scored through Bold Display and Supreme Chancellor, both ridden by B. Gurang ? was hardly welcomed by the students of form.

 The two horses won their respective events ? the Riders of The Sea handicap and the Nausena Handicap, practically from the start.

 Jockey Ross on Wayward King also adopted similar tactics to out-pace Seeker who had matched the formers odds in the betting. In fact, Wayward King never faced any threat from Seeker who was hard put to place third behind Destinys Trick.

 Equally facile was the victory of Native Son in the Eastern Naval Command Cup, though the horse was ridden in a check till the half-way stage of the race before Ross gave a little rein to the five-year-old who sailed away from early leaders Frontier Flame and Majestic Hills.

 Express Rose complimented her trainer Javed Khan with a brilliant victory over a 1,400m trip. The up and coming apprentice, Afzal Khan, hardly needed to do anything special on the Libor-Speedwell daughter when the filly was shown the daylight 600m from home. She simply skated past the leader, Star Stature for a shade under nine-length victory.

 It always pays to take a chance against Daniel and Bharath Singhs favourites. 

 Therefore, the courageous efforts of trainer Deepak Karki paid off with a handsome double notched up through Sea Legend and Thoughtful.

 It was Bharaths The Polynesian in the afternoons feature event, the 1,400m INS Netaji Subhas Cup, who started as an 11-10 favourite but found the speedy Sea Legend too hot to touch.

 In fact, the favourites lost even the second slot to Compassionate who finished full of running after losing considerable ground at the start.

 Thoughtful, on the other hand, was kept in check till approaching the final turn and apprentice Malcom Maseyk kept the five-year-old going for rest of the journey to keep Cambridge Blue at bay.

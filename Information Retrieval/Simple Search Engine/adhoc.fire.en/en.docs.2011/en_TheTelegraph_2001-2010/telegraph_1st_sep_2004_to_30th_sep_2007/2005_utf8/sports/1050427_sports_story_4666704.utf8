 Warne in sledging row 

Southampton: Shane Warne has become embroiled in a sledging row while playing for Hampshire in the English county championship. 

The Australian leg-spinner has been accused of trying to humiliate opposing players during Hampshire?s drawn Division I match with Sussex last weekend. 

Sussex captain Chris Adams says Warne abused England hopeful Matt Prior, whom he dismissed in both innings. 

?Matt Prior came in for quite a bit of verbal abuse,? Adams said. ?I have told matt that is because he is seen as a threat and he should take it as a backhanded compliment. 

?Because of what he has done in the game Shane Warne will always be considered a great. Off the field he was outstanding and the first person to congratulate us and say what a great game it was. But I have lost a lot of respect for him because of the way he behaved in the match. 

?I have played for 18 years with and against some of the greatest players in the world, legends like Michael Holding, Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner and Steve Waugh. Not one of these guys ever felt the need to disrespect people or disrespect the game.? 

Hampshire manager Paul Terry refused to be speak about Adams? accusations. ?I cannot really comment,? he said. 

Warne seemed to be leading Hampshire to a dramatic victory after being set a target of 285 to win their second innings. They notched 136 in their first twenty overs but fell 18 short of their victory target. 

Warne, however, had nothing to say of the sledging. 

?We played extremely well to get ourselves into a winning position and to come so close to victory was a fantastic effort,? he said. ?We showed we are a tough side to play against over four days and there is a fair bit of spirit and fight in us. 

?Sussex play pretty well at home and they fought hard so this is a pretty good indication to where we are at.?

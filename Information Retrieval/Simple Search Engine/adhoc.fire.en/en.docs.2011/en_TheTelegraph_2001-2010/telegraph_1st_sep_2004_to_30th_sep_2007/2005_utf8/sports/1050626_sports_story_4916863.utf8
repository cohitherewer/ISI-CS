The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Matches from Aug. 15-21

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The inaugural three-match limited overs Asia versus Africa series will be hosted by South Africa between August 15-21. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, this was decided after the first meeting of the newly-formed Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation, in London, late on Saturday. 

Johannesburg and Cape Town were being talked about as the venues (with one getting two matches), but the latter has been ruled out owing to weather-related problems. 

Now, Johannesburg could get two matches, with one possibly going to Benoni. 

The ICC is being moved for official status.

 Daniel set to ruleDaniel 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh is banking heavily 

on Acrostic?s win in the baby race on Wednesday, the concluding fixture of the 

winter season. Still, Daniel David may make it to the top of the championship 

table. 

 In the seven-event card, Daniel has some potential winners like Beauchamp Hero, Generous Gesture, Ocean Spirit and more to push his tally up. If they fail, there are back-up horses, in most of races, to look after the stable?s interest. The championship concludes after the fifth race. Presently, Vijay tops the table but only a point separates the two trainers.

 Tension will ease up before the main event, the 1,400m Romantic Memories Cup which is the sixth race. It may see a close contest among Say It Loud, Mythical Star, Pacific Jewel and Nominate. But Mythical Star?s last run is best ignored. He was a very fluent winner in his earlier start.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

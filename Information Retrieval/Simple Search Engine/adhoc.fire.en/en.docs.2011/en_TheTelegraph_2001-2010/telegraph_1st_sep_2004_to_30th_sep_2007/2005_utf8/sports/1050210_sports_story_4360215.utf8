Saitama: Substitute Masashi Oguro snatched an injury-time winner as Japan beat North Korea 2-1 in the first match of the final round of Asian 2006 World Cup qualifiers on Wednesday. 

Oguro stabbed home from close range to give Japan a fortuitous victory after the group B game in Saitama looked to be heading for a draw. 

Japan took the lead in the fourth minute when Mitsuo Ogasawara curled in a free kick from 25 metres following North Korea captain Ri Myong-sam?s trip on Brazilian-born Alex. 

North Korea equalised after 61 minutes when substitute Nam Song-chol smashed home a left-foot shot from an acute angle that beat goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi at his near post. 

The match was played amid tight security because of fears that bitter political divisions between two countries could spill over. 

Japan had mobilised over 4,000 police and security officials but the crowd of 59,000 respectfully applauded the North Korean national anthem before the match. 

North Korea fought back bravely after Ogasawara?s early strike and midfielder Mun In-guk?s diving header forced a superb save from Kawaguchi six minutes into the second half. 

Nam?s equaliser was a just reward for North Korea?s efforts, though substitute Naohiro Takahara squandered two gilt-edged chances to restore Japan?s lead before Ogura?s late winner. 

The teams last met in a World Cup qualifier in Doha in 1993 which Japan won 3-0. 

North Korea had vanished from the international scene after their shock appearance in the 1966 World Cup quarter finals. 

However, the reclusive Communist state has lavished cash, modern apartments and cars on its players in a bid to qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. 

 South Korea win 

In Seoul, Striker Lee Dong-gook scored with a stunning 24th-minute volley to help South Korea beat Kuwait 2-0 in their Asian zone qualifier on Wednesday. 

Lee Young-pyo clinched the victory with a goal in the 81st minute for the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists playing their first game in the final qualifying round for the 2006 tournament in Germany. 

South Korea, who have qualified for every World Cup since 1986, also face Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait in group A. 

Substitute Anvar Soliev salvaged a point for Uzbekistan with an injury-time goal to earn his side a 1-1 draw against Saudi Arabia in an Asian Zone Group A World Cup qualifier in Tashkent on Wednesday. 

Soliev, who plays for leading Uzbek side Pakhtakor, upstaged his more established foreign-based teammates Maksim Shatskikh and Vladimir Shishelov by cancelling out veteran Sami Al Jabers 77th-minute opener for the visitors. 

Al Jaber, 32, who retired after the 2002 World Cup, was recalled to the Saudi squad by Argentine coach Gabriel Calderon.

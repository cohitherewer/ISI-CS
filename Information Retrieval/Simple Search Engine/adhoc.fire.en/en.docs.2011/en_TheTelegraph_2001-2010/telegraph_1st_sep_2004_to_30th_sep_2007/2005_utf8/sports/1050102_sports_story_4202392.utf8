The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Captains wary of fatigue

 - SA VS ENGLAND 3RD TEST

 It would be a good toss to win, says Vaughan 

Cape Town: South Africa captain Graeme Smith and his English counterpart Michael Vaughan agree fatigue could be an important factor going into the third Test, which starts at Newlands on Sunday. 

The teams have had only two days to prepare for the match after the second Test in Durban ended in a draw, leaving England 1-0 up in the series. 

?I think recovery in between the back-to-back Test matches is always key especially after the heat we had in Durban,? Smith said. 

?It took its toll on both sides and I think it is going to be pretty warm here over the next few days. 

?Starting the Test well is crucial and getting momentum up front is vital especially as you?ll be carrying some fatigue through the match because neither side is going to be fully recovered.? 

Vaughan said: ?We talk about back-to-back Tests all the time but we are getting used to it. It?s tough on the body and it is tough on the mind but we have to just get out there and deliver.? 

The importance of winning the toss and choosing to bat to give the bowlers a little more rest not lost on either captains. 

?It would be a good one (toss) to win,? Vaughan said. ?The bowlers have already told me not to come back to the changing room if I lose it. 

?I think I know which way I?ll go if I win it but if you bat you have got to do a good job and make sure you get a big total because if you don?t you allow the opposition back in.? 

South Africa, who grimly hung on to draw the second Test after dismissing England for 139 in the first innings, believe their strong finish has left them in good spirits. 

Smith said. ?I think we fought nicely at the end of the second Test and that left us feeling really upbeat going into this match.?

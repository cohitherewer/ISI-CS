 UCB, sponsor part ways

Durban: The United Cricket Board of South Africa and its major Test cricket sponsor have fallen apart after a disagreement on the sponsorship deal leading to speculation that the board would be bankrupt. 

Cellphone giant, MTN, pulled out after a seven-year association with the UCB taking away its total annual contribution of 20-million Rand. 

MTNs sponsorship manager Victor Rahkale said in a statement that the cricket board wanted too much money.

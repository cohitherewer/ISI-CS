 India?s problem was in mind

 - Defensive Sachin cast a spell of fear among fellow batsmen 

JAVED MIANDAD

 Even somebody like Shahid Afridi (seen here being congratulated by Inzamam-ul Haq after taking Sachin Tendulkar?s wicket in Bangalore on Monday) was a demon personified 

Just two sessions to go, nine wickets in hand and a bowling attack they had unfailingly milked for over 400 runs in each innings of the series. Then what went wrong? 

India?s problem was in the mind. A batsman of Sachin Tendulkar?s class suddenly decided to treat each ball as if it was a matter of life and death. He could have provided direction to a batting line-up consisting of bowlers, a young wicketkeeper and two senior batsmen struggling for form, but instead, he cast a spell of fear in their heart. 

No wonder the Indians collapsed. They forgot the age-old maxim of cricket: you can play for a draw for 20 overs, but doing so for 90 overs is out of question. That?s the surest way to embrace disaster. The Indians must be kicking themselves. 

Suddenly, every Pakistan bowler looked a matchwinner. Even somebody like Shahid Afridi was a demon personified. Kudos are coming the way of Mohammed Sami, but what can a bowler do wrong if you don?t take him on and he is secure in the knowledge he won?t go for runs? 

If the Indians were indeed looking for a draw, the last thing they needed was for bowlers to find their line and length and hem them in with eight close-in fielders. The way to go about it was to bat normally, hit balls which deserved to be hit and scatter the fielders. Anil Kumble did it so admirably and taught the top order a thing or two about batting. 

I remember in our times we used to go hard at our opener Shoaib Mohammed for batting so defensively. We used to tell him: ?you are allowing the bowlers to find their rhythm and gain in confidence and they would create problem for us?. 

I remember even on a minefield of a pitch, Sunil Gavaskar on-driving against the spin with aplomb. He did so because he read the ball in the bowler?s hand. 

Somebody like Sourav Ganguly is today choosing his movement only after the ball has landed on the pitch. Even Rahul Dravid batted against his grain in this Test. 

Indians deserve the fans? ire, but not in the second innings alone. I thought they were equally terrible in the first innings. But for Virender Sehwag, who else batted well? The negative mindset was all too apparent. That was the period when they should have shut the game on Pakistan. Tendulkar played an airy-fairy shot on 41 when better application was required. If you are a high-quality bat and well set, you don?t do that. 

Not that Pakistan were without a fault. I thought they batted too long on the fourth evening. They needed to give more than six overs to the Indian openers. When they knew they were not going to be all out, they ought to have promoted Abdul Razzaq for quick runs and given Indian more overs to negotiate. Again there was this negative mindset in play. 

Pakistan played out of their skins in this Test because they knew a backlash awaited them back home. I would like to see them similarly aggressive at all times. 

Somehow, we in the sub-continent allow pressure to get the better of us rather than back ourselves and play the ball on merit. The ?white? countries, let?s give them credit, play cricket as it should be. Just a game and an exhibition of skills and your mental resoluteness. 

More than celebrating a team?s win or wallowing in the sorrow of a loss, the lesson from this series is that the teams from the sub-continent are still not able to absorb pressure. It worries me. 

The gains for Pakistan were obvious: Younis Khan and Danish Kaneria. Both have taken important strides in their careers. 

The profits for India were less obvious except for the impressive comeback of Lakshmipathy Balaji. India look a side which needs a bit of a shake-up: maybe it?s time to recall somebody like Mohammed Kaif who is in good nick and whose energy in the field gives the side a leg-up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pole for Alonso

Silverstone: Narain Karthikeyan on Saturday produced a sparkling drive under difficult conditions to clinch the 17th position on the grid for the British Grand Prix here. 

Narains performance made up for the disappointment of his Jordan teammate Tiego Monteiro being relegated to back grid as a penalty for engine change during the practice sessions Friday. Monteiro will start 20th last after he completed a formal one lap at the qualifying. 

 Championship leader Fernado Alonso 

 of Renault took the pole while contender Kimi Raikkonen 

 too was penalised for an engine change and dropped ten places 

 12th in the starting order despite a second place finish. 

 Bar-Hondas Jenson Button and Raikkonens teammate 

 Juan Pablo Montoya occupied the second row in that order.

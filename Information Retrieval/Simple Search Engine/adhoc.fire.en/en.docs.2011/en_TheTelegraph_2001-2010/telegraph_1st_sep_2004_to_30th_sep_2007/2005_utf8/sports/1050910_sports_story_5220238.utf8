New York: There were ominous signs for Australian Lleyton Hewitt at the US Open on Thursday. 

While the third seed fiddled his way to a five-set quarter final win over Finlands Jarkko Nieminen, his semi-final opponent Roger Federer made 11th seed David Nalbandian look like a park player. 

Defending champion Federer thrashed the Argentine, who once held a 5-0 win-loss record over him, 6-2, 6-4, 6-1 in his most impressive display of the tournament so far. 

I played great, thats exactly how it should be at this stage of the tournament, said the Swiss top seed. I found some great rhythm against David. Im surprised it went so quick. 

Time flies, of course, when youre having fun and Federer was detained for a mere 100 minutes on Arthur Ashe Court. 

The days when Nalbandian, whose last win over Federer was in the 2003 fourth round at Flushing Meadow, held the upper hand in their rivalry are long gone. 

The match, played out at the scene of Andre Agassis dramatic five-set win over James Blake the previous evening, had the air of a practice match by comparison, despite Nalbandian going a break up in both the first two sets. 

Federer reeled off the required winners to break back each time, and a fizzing backhand that sealed the second set prompted Nalbandian to smash his racket in half ? although he even needed two attempts to achieve that. 

Federer said he still expected a tough battle against Hewitt. He knows hes not far away. I know if Im not on top of my game, Im losing to Lleyton and he knows that. I expect a tough match. 

Hewitt, however, meandered through to the semi-finals with a disjointed 2-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 win over Nieminen, almost as if he wanted to delay having to contemplate playing Federer again for as long as possible. 

The Swiss demolished Hewitt 6-0, 7-6, 6-0 in last years final and has won their last eight matches, six of them in straight sets including their Wimbledon semi-final two months ago. I was just struggling a little bit with my movement, said Hewitt. I just felt a step slower, a bit sluggish out there. It was patchy. 

Nieminen was making history as the first Finn to appear in the quarter finals of a Grand Slam. The left-hander caught Hewitt cold in the first set, his varied pace of shot disrupting the Australians rhythm on a half-full Arthur Ashe Court. The world number 57, however, was eventually out-manoeuvred by the 2001 champion who won the last two sets with relative ease. 

I was a little bit surprised that he didnt feel so confident on the court, said Nieminen. I felt many times that I could win this match. But he played the important points better in the end.

 Gold for Pampa; new mark for Chetna 

New Delhi: Uttar Pradeshs Chetna Solanki set a national record in womens pole vault on the opening day of the ONGC Federation Cup athletics championships here Wednesday, while Bengals Pampa Chanda won gold in the womens 10,000m. 

Solanki cleared 3.80m in her second attempt at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium to erase Tamil Nadus V. S. Surekhas mark of 3.70m set at the same venue a fortnight back. 

The two athletes, both trained by P. C. Tyagi, were way ahead of the competition and above 3.50m (the height cleared by third-placed Geetanjali Bora) there was none to challenge them. 

The first title to be decided in the championship went to Pampa, the 10,000m being held in the morning session. Pampa returned a time of 36:32.26 while Beant Kaur (Punjab Police, 36:51.86) and Preethi L. Rao (Karnataka, 37:34.73) came second and third. 

The events stood out of otherwise ordinary performances with the exception of Anil Kumar and Poonam Tomar who emerged the fastest man and woman of the meet. 

National record holder Anil Kumar firmly put forward his claim for a berth in the Indian team for the Asian Grand Prix Circuit meet, winning the 100 in 10.36 seconds. 

In the womens 100, favourite Poonam won in 11.70 seconds. (PTI)

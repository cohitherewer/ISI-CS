The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI, CA reach 4-yr agreement

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Cricket Australia (CA) are understood to have reached an agreement over bilateral programmes spread over four years. 

According to The Telegraphs sources in New Delhi, where the key men of both boards met on Monday, if four Tests feature in one year, then the next is going to see ten ODIs. It will be the same in the third and fourth years. 

Apparently, Australia have a backlog of five ODIs and, so, theyre going to play more in India. 

The arrangement will be on a home-and-away basis and the action may begin in 2006 itself.

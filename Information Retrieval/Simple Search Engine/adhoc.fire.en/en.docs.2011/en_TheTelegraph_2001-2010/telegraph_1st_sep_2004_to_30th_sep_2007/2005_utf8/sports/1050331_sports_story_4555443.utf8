 Chetan Sharma falls 5 short

Gurgaon: Opener Chetan Sharma missed a century and Haryana reached 264 for four on the opening day of the Plate division final on Wednesday 

Sharma (95) and Bageshwar Bisht (50) justified their captain?s decision to bat first as the left-right hand combination gathered 129 runs in an opening stand. 

Bisht was first to depart when he was caught by P M S Reddy off Arun Sharma. But Chetan Sharma, who hit seven fours and a six in his 200-ball knock, continued to pile on the agony of the Services bowlers as he added another 48 runs with Sunny Singh (52) before falling to Yashpal Singh. 

Though haryana lost Sunny and Ishan Ganda (9) with the addition of just 45 runs, Shafiq Khan (28 batting) and Joginder Sharma (13 batting) ensured no more setbacks till stumps. 

Arun Sharma (two for 94) and Yashpal (two for 46) shared the spoils for Services. 

Both Haryana and Services are assured of a spot in the Elite Group next year by reaching the final.

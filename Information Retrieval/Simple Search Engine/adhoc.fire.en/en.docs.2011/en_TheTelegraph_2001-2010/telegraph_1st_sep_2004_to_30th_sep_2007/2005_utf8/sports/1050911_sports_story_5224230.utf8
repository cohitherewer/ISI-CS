 Dravid falls to 20th spot, Sachin 17th

Dubai: Indian vice-captain Rahul Dravid slipped six places in the latest International Cricket Council (ICC) one-day International rankings following his low average in the recently concluded tri-series in Zimbabwe. 

Dravid, ranked sixth in May, was pushed to the 20th spot on account of averaging a mere 12.80 with the bat in the tri-series involving New Zealand and Zimbabwe. 

Incidentally, Sachin Tendulkar, who is out with an elbow injury, was the only other Indian to accompany Dravid in the top 20. The batting maestro has slipped two places and is at 17th. 

Vireder Sehwag, who belted out some impressive scores in Zimbabwe, moved up three places to be 26th, while Yuvraj Singh was sitting pretty on 30th. 

The list of top 10 batsmen however remains unchanged with Australians Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting and West Indian Chris Gayle maintaining the first three slots. 

Among the bowlers, Indian pace duo Irfan Pathan and Ashish Nehra went down three and two places to be 13th and 20th, respectively. 

Shane Bond continued to be in 14th place . (PTI)

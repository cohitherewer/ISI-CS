 Warne?s wife breaks silence

 Simone says she couldn?t believe Warne could be so stupid 

Sydney: Breaking her silence, the estranged wife of Aussie spin great Shane Warne has said she was shocked to know about the misadventures of her ?stupid? husband and was forced to take the heartbreaking decision. 

An infuriated Simone explained the decision to leave her celebrity husband, triggering off what could be another off-field distraction for the champion leg spinner. 

?I was in shock. I was numb. I said to him: ?how could you be so stupid??? she said in an interview to a magazine. 

?I told him there and then that I was leaving,? an Australian website quoted her as saying. 

Warne, the world?s highest Test wicket taker, has been linked to five women in England in the past month. 

A British tabloid last week published allegations that he had most recently become involved with a 20-year-old archaeology student named Rebecca Weedon. 

Weedon alleged Warne had begged her to persuade his wife into having a threesome in a bid to ?save? their 10-year-old marriage. 

Simone has returned to Melbourne since separating from her husband, whereas Warne is now part of the Australian team for the Ashes series. 

In the interview, the mother of three tells why she kept forgiving Shane and taking him back. She also talks about what happened on their final holiday together in Spain when it appeared as if a reconciliation was possible with her 35-year-old husband. 

Simone had last year vowed to leave her husband if he played up again following past alleged indiscretions. 

?I?d be pretty shocked if he did go down that road again,? she said at that time. ?But there?ll be no family and no wife at the end of it.? 

The couple became engaged when Warne was on his first of four Ashes tours in 1993.

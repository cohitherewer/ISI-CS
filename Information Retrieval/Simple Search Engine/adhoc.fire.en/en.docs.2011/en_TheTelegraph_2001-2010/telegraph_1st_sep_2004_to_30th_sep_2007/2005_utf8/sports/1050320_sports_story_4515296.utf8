The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Draw should be Pak goal: Sohail

 - Just a bad patch for Sourav, says Rameez 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Former captain Aamer Sohail gave Pakistan a 10 per cent chance of winning the second Test. He, however, added that Pakistan should use the ?confidence gained from a brilliant start? in their battle to save the match. 

?The way the match stands now, I think it is 10 per cent in favour of Pakistan, 30 per cent for a draw and 60 per cent for India. But Shahid Afridi and Taufeeq Umar gave the team an excellent start and the team should draw confidence from this tomorrow,? Sohail said on Saturday. 

He had a piece of advice for Inzamam-ul Haq and Co. ? not to lose any wicket in the first session. ?Pakistan shouldn?t get carried away thinking they have an outside chance of win. The objective must be to keep wickets intact. Draw should be their first goal,? Sohail observed. 

?The final day Eden pitch holds the key. Low bounce and slow turn are not easy to handle. Plus, India have the home advantage,? he added. 

Sohail felt Afridi was under-bowled in India?s second innings. ?The bowlers couldn?t keep the tempo going after Sami?s initial bursts. They also let India move to a position of strength by pitching the ball too wide. But one shouldn?t take credit away from Dravid? He?s simply majestic,? remarked the former opener. 

Sohail, however, joined Rameez Raja in backing Sourav Ganguly. Both feel the Team India captain?s bad phase with the bat is a ?natural phenomenon.? 

?It could happen to any batsman. Even Sachin was out of form. Sourav has to stay focussed. Everything will fall in place soon,? Sohail said. 

Raja, on the other hand, said Sourav needed to spend more times at nets. ?It?s a peculiar situation for Sourav, because when are out of form, everything you do will invite criticism. It?s purely a bad patch and practice at nets will help him recover.?

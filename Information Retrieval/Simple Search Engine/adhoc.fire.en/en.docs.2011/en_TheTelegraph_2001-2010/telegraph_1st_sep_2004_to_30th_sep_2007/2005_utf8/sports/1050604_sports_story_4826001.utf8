 Brotherly love

Paris: French Open doubles finalists Bob and Mike Bryan say their strategy for successful social lives is to date women who are friends with each other. 

And that what the 27-year-old twins are doing. 

Bob has been seeing American television actress Joanna Garcia for the past year and a half. 

Im dating her best friend, said Mike, adding that theyve tried introducing women who dont know each other into their lives, but that it doesnt work. 

Its best when theyre best friends, Mike said, explaining that competitiveness has been a problem in the past. Weve had numerous times where our girlfriends hate each other.

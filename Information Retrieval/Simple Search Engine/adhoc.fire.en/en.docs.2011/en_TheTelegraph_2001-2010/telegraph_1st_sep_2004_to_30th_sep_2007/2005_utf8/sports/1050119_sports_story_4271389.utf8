 Double crown for Advani 

Mumbai: Bangalore-based Pankaj Advani expectedly crushed Punjab youngster Aayush Kumar in straight frames to retain his junior snooker crown and complete a fine double in the national billiards and snooker tournament on Tuesday. 

Advani, representing the PSPB, whipped the 15-year-old 82-12, 72-19, 84-1, 105-18 for his third straight win in the four-player round-robin final to decide the junior snooker crown. 

The 19-year-old former world amateur champion rifled in breaks of 60, 72 and 66 against the hapless Kumar to romp home in style and add the snooker title to the billiards crown he had won earlier, thus repeating his feat of the last nationals. (PTI)

 Karthikeyan hopes to do a ?decent job? 

Sydney: Narain Karthikeyan, all set for his maiden Formula One race, said his fans must not expect ?too much? although he is hoping to do a ?decent? job. 

?The response from India has been great, they?re all supporting me,? said Karthikeyan, who is almost certain to drive for Jordan Honda in Sunday?s season opening Australian Grand Prix. ?My news is on the front page of every newspaper. There?s been a lot of coverage back home for me so hopefully I can do a decent job,? he said. 

Karthikeyan admitted of being under some pressure before the big day, but was confident of coping with it. 

?There?s going to be some pressure but I can cope with it, no problem. As long as they don?t expect too much,? he was quoted as saying by an Australian website. ?The goal is to finish races, then try to get points along the way.

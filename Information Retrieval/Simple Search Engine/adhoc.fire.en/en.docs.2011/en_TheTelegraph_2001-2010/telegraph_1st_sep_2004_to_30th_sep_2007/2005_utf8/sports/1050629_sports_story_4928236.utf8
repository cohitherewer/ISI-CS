 CRICKET ONLINE - RAVI SHASTRI

 Positive thinking key to mental toughness

 Work hard at nets and believe in your abilities to overcome a bad patch

 I am a right-handed batsman and always get out to a yorker. Please help.

 (Subhabrata Dey, 15, Calcutta-47)

 Watch the ball coming out of the bowlers hand like a hawk. Also check the backlift.

 I am a leg-spinner. Whenever I try to bowl a faster delivery I end up bowling wide or full toss. Why does this happen?

 (Vivek Kr Sah, 19, Calcutta-7)

 Get you balance right at the time of delivery and watch the spot where you want the ball to land. Dont let your head fall away at the time of delivery.

 I am a right-arm pacer. I am going through a bad patch and not getting wickets. How can I break out from this?

 (Arka Das, 15, Calcutta-44)

 Work hard at the nets and believe in your abilities. Always remember there is no short cut to success.

 I am a mediumpacer. I often end up bowling a wide when trying an outswinger. Please help.

 (Yashraj Sharma, 14, Sundargarh, Orissa)

 Keep a still head and again focus on the spot you want the ball to land.

 I am a wicketkeeper. I often fail to intercept balls going down the leg side. Please help.

 (Tamal Das, 18, Calcutta-10)

 Work on your fitness and footwork.

 I am an opener. I often fail to negotiate the moving ball and end up getting caught at slips. Do I need to improve on my footwork?

 (Roktim Pal, 19, Calcutta-42)

 Allow the ball to come to you. And yes, work on your footwork.

 I am an off-spinner. How does one bowl the straighter?

 (Suresh Jain, 17, Jamshedpur)

 Slight change in grip and less leverage with the fingers.

 I am an allrounder. There is lot of talk of mental toughness in todays cricket. How can one be strong in the mind? Is it inborn?

 (Arijit Pal, 23, Calcutta-41)

 It is inborn to an extent. You can work on it as well. Clarity of thought and solid positive thinking where there is no room for excuses is the key.

 I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try to hit a pacer over the bowlers head I end up getting caught and bowled. Please help.

 (Rathin Roy, 17, Calcutta-71)

 You might be getting too close to the pitch of the ball and lifting your head.

 I am a left-handed batsman. Often while offering a defensive shot to a left-arm spinner I get caught at silly point. Why does this happen?

 (Brajesh Chakraborty, 21, Calcutta-15)

 Defend with the bat slightly in front of the pad and play with soft hands.

 WI confident despite problems

 - 2007 World Cup 

 Even Brian Lara must show his passport to travel between the islands 

St Johns: On an average weekday morning in Barbados the drive from Bridgetowns prestige hotel district to Kensington Oval can take 45 minutes. 

The journey is less than seven kilometres. 

Kensington Oval is scheduled to host the 2007 World Cup final, when around 20,000 cricket fans from across the globe will add to an already crippling load on the narrow, clogged and, in places, crumbling roads. 

Plans are afoot to alleviate the potential crisis, with the building of elevated freeways the latest idea put forward. 

The Kensington Oval is due to be knocked down in June after Pakistans tour of the West Indies, and is due to be rebuilt, World Cup organisers say, by the end of 2006. 

Despite the problems, many people are confident the Caribbean will be ready. 

?I do fully believe that not only will the West Indies and Caribbean region be ready to host the next World Cup, but I expect that the world would be shocked into understanding that we in the Caribbean are as special as they come when it comes to putting on a wonderful show,? Colin Croft, former West Indies fast bowler said. 

?I do have my reservations about our attitudes of accelerating at the last minute to get it all done, but despite the traumas that we have suffered, I also know that Caribbean people, individually and collectively, are tremendously resilient ones. 

?I know that we will be ready, spectacularly so.? 

Cricket fans hoping to find answers to their questions by going to www.worldcupbarbados.com, the website published on official World Cup promotional material, are informed that they have reached the future home of a travel industry site. 

When former West Indies captain Brian Lara, perhaps the most recognised person in the Caribbean, travels from his home in Trinidad to Guyana, he is required to present his passport to an immigration official. 

He has to pay departure tax and if he needs to change Trinidad dollars for the Guyanese variety. 

That is because Guyana, which is just an hours flight from Trinidad, is a sovereign state, as are Barbados, Antigua, Jamaica and the other seven countries where World Cup matches are scheduled to be played. 

The 2007 World Cup is expected to pump approximately $300 million into the Caribbean economy but the region may have to pay an even higher price for the privilege of hosting the showpiece tournament.

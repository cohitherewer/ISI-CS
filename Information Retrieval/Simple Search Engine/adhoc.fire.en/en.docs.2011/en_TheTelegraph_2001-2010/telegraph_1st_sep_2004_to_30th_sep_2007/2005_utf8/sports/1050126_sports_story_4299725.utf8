Calcutta: The wheel of fortune swung Mohun Bagan?s way at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday, giving the green-and-maroons their first win in three National Football League (NFL) games. 

Mohun Bagan hung on for 83 minutes after Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? scored from the penalty spot. 

Sporting Clube de Goa deserved at least a point and would have got one if Dudu Omagbemi?s 73rd-minute penalty not been blocked by Prasanta Dora. There was another man who stood firmly in the visitors? path ? central defender Eduardo Coelho, who was rightly adjudged Man of the Match. 

In an otherwise drab game, it was the Goans who saw more of the ball and had the better scoring chances. 

?A win was important, doesn?t matter how it came,? said Subrata Bhattacharya. ?We didn?t have some key players and I had to do some shuffling. Considering all that, the boys showed some good fight, I can?t complain.? 

Desperate for full points after a draw and a loss, Mohun Bagan kicked off on an aggressive note. Full-fledged strikers Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? and Sunil Chhetri were on duty up front, while a third one ? Ashim Biswas ? was asked to operate from the midfield. 

Jerry Zirsanga started as a medio but effectively functioned as the third striker. And he was quite a terror for the Sporting defence in the early minutes. 

Ashim, who revelled in his new role, worked his way through the middle and put Jerry through just wide of the box. As Jerry cut in and got into scoring position, a Sporting defender pushed him off possession. It looked a penalty but referee P. Bhaskar blew for an indirect free-kick. 

Two minutes later, Jerry was again at the receiving end of a nasty foul. He trapped a fine Beto back-heel ? the Brazilian?s most important contribution besides the penalty conversion ? and moved into the box only to be felled by Felip Gomes. This time, Bhaskar pointed to the dreaded spot and Beto found the mark with a powerful grounder. 

Ashim then put the ball in the path of the advancing Mehtab Hussain down the left. Jerry, however, couldn?t guide the left-back?s cross into an untenanted goal after custodian Luis Bareto had misjudged the flight. 

Mohun Bagan were done for the first half. Sporting took charge thereafter but lacked variety in attack. The one-point agenda of the wing-backs and medios was to float in balls for strike-duo Dudu Omagbemi and Chidi Edeh. The Nigerians were well taken care of by Coelho. 

The Goan outfit tested the rival defence from set-piece situations, but there wasn?t anyone to come up with a final pass. A Dudu header was cleared from the goalline by Dharamjit Singh. Bibiano Fernandes then saw his header off a corner-kick go inches wide. 

Early in the second session, Jerry found himself in a favourable position after Ashim and Beto had done the spadework. Jerry delayed in taking a shot, went wide and was dispossessed by Vincent Pires. 

At the other end, Wilton Gomes came across the afternoon?s easiest opportunity. Noel Wilson, filling in as stopper-back for Mehrajuddin Wadao, saw his headed clearance land straight into Gomes? path. He had a clear look goal and, with none to challenge, directed his right-footer two feet wide of target. 

Sporting earned the penalty when Palash Karmakar, within a minute of coming on for an off-form Chhetri, hacked Chidi inside the box. Dora anticipated Dudu?s shot well and palmed it away diving to his right. 

Minutes from the final whistle, Beto hit the ball into the sidepost to end a forgettable match for him and his team.

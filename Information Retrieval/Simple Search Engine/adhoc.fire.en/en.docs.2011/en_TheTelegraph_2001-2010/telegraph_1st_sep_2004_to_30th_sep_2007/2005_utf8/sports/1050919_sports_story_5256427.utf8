 Jeev finishes tied 19th 

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh faltered once again in the final round, carding a two-over 74 to finish a disappointing tied 19th in the 200 million yen Ana Open on the Japan Golf Tour. 

Jeev finished with a tally of seven-under 281 at the par-72 Sapporo Golf Club Wattsu Course. 

The Indian pro had a bothersome front nine with bogeys on second, seventh and ninth holes, and just one birdie on fifth, which he birdied each day and eagled it in second round. On the back nine, he birdied the 12th and bogeyed the par-three 16th. He took 29 putts, but it was his iron play that let him down.

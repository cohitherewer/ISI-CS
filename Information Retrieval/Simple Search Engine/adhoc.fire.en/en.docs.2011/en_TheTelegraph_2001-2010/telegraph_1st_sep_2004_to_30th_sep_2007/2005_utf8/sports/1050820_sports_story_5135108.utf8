 Pak, Aussies in title-clash

Amsterdam: Pakistan steamrolled world champions Germany 5-0 to set up a summit clash against Australia on Sunday in the RaboBank Cup at Amstelveen here on Friday. 

Leading 1-0 at the break, Pakistan scored twice through winger Rehan Butt and once each from Mudassar Ali Khan, Shabbir Hussain and captain Mohammed Saqlain. 

Pakistan went up in the 18th minute when Mudassar found the mark from atop the circle after a rebound. 

With Spain also on seven points, Pakistan needed to win by at least three goals in this game to advance to the final. (PTI)

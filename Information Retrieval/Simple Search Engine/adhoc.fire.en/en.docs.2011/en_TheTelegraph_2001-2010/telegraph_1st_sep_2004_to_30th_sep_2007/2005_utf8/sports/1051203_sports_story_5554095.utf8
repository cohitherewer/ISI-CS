 1st-innings lead for Bengal

New Delhi: Rohan Gavaskar scored a patient half century and forged a crucial 92-run stand with Manoj Tewari to bail out Bengal from a precarious 109 for six and give the visitors a 63-run first innings lead against Delhi on the second day of the elite group A Ranji Trophy match here on Friday. 

Opener Akash Chopra and Shikhar Dhawan wiped out the deficit of 41 as Delhi were 22 for no loss at stumps after Bengals innings folded up at 211 at the Jamia Milia University Grounds. 

Leg spinner Chetanya Nanda (six for 67) proved to be the nemesis for the Bengal team and saw that the home team is still in with a chance after they were bundled out on Thursday for a paltry 148 in their first innings. 

Gavaskar (54) played a determined and gutsy 179-ball innings after Delhi struck two crucial blows in the morning to leave the rival team reeling at 56 for four. The left hander was ably supported by youngster Manoj Tewari, who hit a fluent 45 off 92 balls.

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan finally woke up to the immediate need of the hour and produced something of a show that might have given them more than the lifeline in the ninth National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup. 

A 4-0 demolition of Tollygunge Agragami at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday ? engineered by Sunil Chhetris brilliant hattrick ? took the three-time champions out of the relegation zone, as of now. After the penultimate round, Amal Duttas team are at par with Churchill Brothers on 22 points, but placed eighth (one above Churchill), thanks to a better goal differential. 

Chhetris three and Jerry Zirsangas opening goal ensured that Mohun Bagans 13-18 goal differential remains better than the Goan outfits (22-32). It also means Duttas side should start on an advantageous terrain when they host Churchill Brothers in their final round encounter in that a draw will see Mohun Bagan stay on in the premier tier. 

On the flip side, Tollygunge (17 points from 21 matches) have joined SBT (15) and Vasco SC (17) in the demotion ditch, provided the AIFF sticks to its decision to relegate the last four teams of the NFL. Reacting to Churchill Brothers threat of going to court, the AIFF has deferred a final decision on this till its next working committee meeting, next month. 

Coming back to Thursdays match, it was sheer desire to survive that marked Mohun Bagans biggest victory so far in the league. Both sidebacks Dulal Biswas and Rishi Kapoor were moving up freely, providing more teeth to the attack and creating more chances in and around the rival box. 

Crosses from both flanks started landing in the Tollygunge box thick and fast and the first goal was the direct result of one such move in the eighth minute. Jerry snapped up a rebound, after Tollygunge custodian Arindam Ghosh partially managed to thwart a low intended cross from Rishi Kapoor. 

Again in the 16th minute, only a timely tackle from Isiaka Awoyemi checked Jerrys progress inside the box. In the challenge, he broke his right hand, was taken to a nearby hospital and will be out of action for a good deal of time. 

Sunil came in as his replacement, saw and conquered the battle for his team in scintillating fashion. 

Ten minutes after his arrival, he flung himself to the path of another wing-borne cross (from Dulal) with a deft header. 

The second goal virtually took the fighting steam out of Tollygunge as they started going through the motion, with absolutely no communication between their midfield and attacking line. 

Predictably, it was Mohun Bagan all over in the second half and Sunil duly completed his hattrick in the space of just two minutes. 

His 30-yard thumping left-footer, in the 59th minute, gave no chance to Proloy Dutta, who substituted Arindam under the bar and in the very next attack, he was bang on target after a Tomba pass set him free on the left.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gains and losses...

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: The inaugural Premier Division came concluded on Saturday. Looking back on the gains and losses of the championship, The Telegraph spoke to three key figures of the Big Three. 

The following are excerpts 

Biswajit Bhattacharya (coach, Mohammedan Sporting): We have brought back the lost glory of the club and that is the biggest gain for us till date. Our players are also getting their rhythm back slowly. 

But one thing which has affected us is the injury problem. We have suffered a lot for the niggling injuries to our key players. 

It is obviously a good sign that Saturday we played total football with everyone doing his job superbly. Now the players must take the weight of the jersey and perform accordingly. 

Mehtab Hussain (captain, Mohun Bagan): Our plus point is that our players are determined to do well. Thats why we rallied to hold Mohammedan Sporting on Saturday after having conceded a brace quite early in the match. 

But we have to do away with the complacency factor. We had won all the matches but failed to cross the final hurdle on Saturday. 

This determination will obviously help us to fare well in the forthcoming all-India meets. Our players are in good shape, so, at the moment, we dont have any major grey area. 

We finished the league with an unbeaten record, but it would have been better had we finished on 42 points. 

Dipankar Roy (captain, East Bengal): Though we havent got the league our strength has increased with Mike Okoros availability. The scoring ability of the team is bound to increase. We didnt get a full strength side because of injuries and office assignments and that is one weak point which we will overcome shortly. 

We have players who can make the team in any national level tournament. What we need to do is to try and practice hard to overcome our shortcomings before the Federation Cup and National League.

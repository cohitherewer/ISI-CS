Mumbai: Despite some disparaging remarks about Sourav Ganguly in his autobiography, former Australian captain Steve Waugh and the deposed India skipper still have mutual respect for each other, said Waughs twin Mark on Friday. 

I have not read the book. A few things that happened between the two rankled Steve. But Steve and Ganguly have mutual respect for each other, Mark told newsmen here. 

In his autobiography, Out of my comfort zone, Steve has slammed the former Indian skippers bickering over pitches which, the former has described, as not too different from match-fixing. 

Mark, who is on a promotional visit to Mumbai, said in Australia curators prepare pitches as per the soil characteristics of that particular venue, irrespective of Australias opponents. 

The former Test batsman, who was also one of the finest slip-catchers, felt there was nothing wrong in choosing Ganguly to play under Rahul Dravid if hes still one of the top six batsmen in the line-up. 

Gangulys still got a lot to offer Indian cricket. He should be happy that hes still in the team and score runs and support Dravid, he added. 

Mark felt coach Greg Chappells alleged finger salute to the Calcutta fans was too trivial to talk about. Its a small thing in the bigger context. It has given you (media) people something to write about, he said.

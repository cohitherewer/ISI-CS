 Miami: Ivan Ljubicic was preparing for his third-round match at the Nasdaq-100 Open on Sunday when he found something totally unexpected in his locker, naked fellow player Michael Llodra.

 French prankster Llodra decided to surprise Ljubicic by taking off his clothes and squeezing into the Croatian?s locker, much to the amusement of the other players in the changing rooms. ?I went to open the locker and I was completely shocked,? 13th seed Ljubicic told reporters. 

 Dublin: The international equestrian federation (FEI) has stripped showjumper Cian O?Connor of Ireland?s only gold medal from last year?s Athens Olympics after his horse Waterford Crystal failed a dope test.

 Following a hearing in Zurich, the FEI judicial committee said in a statement that there had been a breach of regulations ?relating to the presence of the prohibited substances of fluphenazine and zuclopenthixol in the horse?. 

 London: Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone lost his wheels at the weekend after thieves struck outside his London home.

 British newspapers reported on Monday that the British billionaire?s new silver Mercedes had been jacked up and left on two wheels.

 ?It?s a real nuisance. It was only the first 

 night I had the car,? Ecclestone said. The papers said the 

 car, a CLS55 AMG V8, was the first of its kind in Britain.

 NZ dump Tuffey 

Wellington: Struggling pacer Daryl Tuffey has been made the scapegoat for New Zealand?s ineffective opposition to Australia in the one-day series, being dropped Sunday for the fourth match along with injured batsman Michael Papps. 

International newcomer Lance Hamilton replaces Tuffey, while batsman Craig Cumming has been recalled in place of Papps who took a fearful knock on the head from Brett Lee in Auckland Saturday where Australia sealed the five-match series with their third consecutive win. 

Tuffey was omitted after he delivered a 14-ball first over ? including four wides and four no balls.

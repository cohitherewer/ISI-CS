 Inzamam denies rift with Shoaib

 Shoaib?s fitness training has been left in the lurch 

Islamabad: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has denied any rift between him and express pacer Shoaib Akhtar and said that the fast bowler was key to the team?s success on its upcoming tour of India. 

Inzamam rubbished media reports that some of the players did not want Shoaib in the team, and said the decision to whether include the player or not should be based on form and fitness. 

?I am surprised to read reports that we have threatened to boycott the tour if Shoaib (Akhtar) is in the side, it?s not true. We have never had any such discussions,? the captain was quoted as saying in a newspaper. 

?If he (Shoaib) is fit ? and that is for the doctors and selectors to judge ? he should be in the touring side because he is our main strike bowler and will be valuable to us on the Indian pitches and against their batsmen. 

?We need to take our best side to India and I would want Shoaib and (Mohammad) Sami if hopefully they are fit.? 

Inzamam denied that his relations with ?The Rawalpindi Express? was strained. 

?There are no problems between us. He is there to perform, likewise it is the same with me,? he said. 

?If it has been suggested that he should reduce his run-up, it is in the team?s interest but it?s a suggestion and not an order.? 

Meanwhile, there?s a fresh crisis in Pakistan, this time it?s on the fitness front. And the person worst affected is none other than Shoaib. 

All three foreign trainers under PCB payroll left for home leaving Shoaib?s fitness programme in the lurch. Physiotherapist Darryn Lifsun and biomechanist Murray Stevenson left for London Tuesday night along with coach Bob Woolmer after returning from Australia earlier in the day. 

South African trainer Greg Compton, under whose supervision the pacer was supposed to undergo rehabilitation on his hamstring injury, also left for home Tuesday evening. 

The PCB has asked Shoaib not to seek treatment from his personal physio Dr Tauseef Razzak, insisting that he report only to Compton. 

?The situation now is that Shoaib is all alone at the NCA wondering who will supervise his rehabilitation process before the tour of India,? a source said. (PTI)

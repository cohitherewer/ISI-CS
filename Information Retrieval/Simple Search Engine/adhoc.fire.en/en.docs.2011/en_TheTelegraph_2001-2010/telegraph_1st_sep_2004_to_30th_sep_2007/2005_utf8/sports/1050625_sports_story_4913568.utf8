 No further action against Symonds: CA

Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) said on Friday that no further action would be taken against Andrew Symonds, but they would examine further the management of internal team disciplinary issues. 

In response to media reports here that Symonds faced further repercussions over his boozy night out in Cardiff, CA chairman Bob Merriman said the majority of CA directors wanted no further action taken against Symonds. 

The 30-year-old allrounder was banned for two games and fined for a drinking binge the night before Australias shock loss to Bangladesh in Cardiff last weekend. 

There were media reports that some CA officials were concerned that Symonds may have breached the conditions of his lucrative playing contract. 

But Merriman, in London for International Cricket Council meetings, issued a statement which said there would be no further action against Symonds. 

However, Merriman said the CA board would review the formal link which underpins the management of internal team disciplinary issues which has operated since late 2003. 

He said the board would also look at the requirements of the code of behaviour and player contracts. 

An Australian paper on Friday said the CA was advised of Symonds penalty ? decided by skipper Ricky Ponting, coach John Buchanan and team manager Steve Bernard in Cardiff ? after it was handed down. 

A number of principles have been raised which need clarification or reconfirmation at a board level, Merriman said in the CA statement. 

These include the boards very strong commitment to managing Australian cricket in a manner which is open, honest and timely. 

Symonds, one of the worlds leading one-day cricketers, is said to be on an annual retainer of Aus $200,000 ($156,000).

 Australia get past India 

New Delhi: Australia defeated India 2-0, to set up a final clash with the hosts in their crucial last league match of the Indira Gandhi Gold Cup hockey tournament on Friday. 

India have already booked a final berth with three straight wins before Fridays encounter. Australia finished their league proceedings at the top of table with 10 points. 

The Aussies, rode on a brace by Rivers Megan (32nd, 56th) to keep her sides title hopes alive. Although the match was inconsequential for the hosts, their only loss in the tournament so far has handed over an phsycological advantage to the Aussies before the final on Saturday. 

The Indian team was off-colour and failed to take on the challenge of the spirited Aussies. 

The Indian, forward line, which had in their last match against New Zealand displayed enough promise, was particularly disappointing as they could not create openings, and let slip whatever opportunities came their way.

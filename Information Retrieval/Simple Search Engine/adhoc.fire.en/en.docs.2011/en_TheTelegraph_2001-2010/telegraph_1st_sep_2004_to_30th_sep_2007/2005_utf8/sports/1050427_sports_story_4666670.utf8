 Week?s rest may recharge Nadal

 Nadal has a long way to go to catch up with Federer 

Barcelona: A week of rest before the Rome Masters may just give red-hot Rafael Nadal the extra energy he needs to threaten the reign of Roger Federer. 

The 18-year-old Spaniard has been on fire this season, with the flames most recently burning Juan Carlos Ferrero in straight sets at last week?s Barcelona Open final. 

Back-to-back titles in Monte Carlo and Barcelona have moved the teenaged Nadal to within 110 points of Federer in the season points race while landing him on a career-best seventh in the rankings with a first-ever breakthrough into the top ten. 

The raging bull of the clay has won his last 11 matches to stand 35-6 ? the same number of victories as Federer. He?s already in possession of four titles in 2005, one less than the Swiss. 

But Nadal has also been schooled in the realities of tennis. 

?I?m aware that a bad run could come,? he admitted as he took the week off before travelling to Rome as the run-up to Roland Garros starting May 23 turns serious, with the Masters in Italy and Germany. 

?Maybe there will be more required of me now, but I?ll just go out and play my tennis. It?s not normal to win so many matches,? added Nadal, one of whose uncles Miguel played in the 1994, ?98 and 2002 World Cup finals. 

Nadal?s run of form began in February with back-to-back trophies in Brazil and Mexico on clay. 

He then took a week off before reaching the final on hardcourt in Miami, where he led Federer two sets and was 4-1 up before the Swiss world-beater recovered for the victory. 

Nadal, coached by his uncle and grounded in the realities of the game, knows that his spell of good fortune cannot be guaranteed. 

?If I want to be the number one I?m going to have to improve a lot of things, including my serve. Everyone is fighting for the same thing ? and Federer is well ahead of everyone else right now.?

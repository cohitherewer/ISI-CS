 Wenger a voyeur: Mourinho

 - I dont know if he wants my job, but he loves Chelsea 

 NICK SZCZEPANIK and GARY JACOB

 All Wenger can think about is Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea, says Mourinho 

Jose Mourinho, the Chelsea manager, has aimed a swipe at Arsene Wenger, accusing the Arsenal manager of being an obsessive Nosy Parker. 

Wenger had suggested that Chelsea would have lost some of their belief after drawing with Everton and losing in a penalty shoot-out to Charlton Athletic in the Carling Cup. 

But Mourinho retaliated after his teams 4-2 victory over Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. 

I think he is one of these ? how do you call it in English? ? voyeurs, Mourinho said. He is someone who likes to watch other people. 

There are some guys who, when they are at home, they have this big telescope to see what happens in other families. He must be one of them. He speaks and speaks and speaks about Chelsea. It does bother me because he is speaking all the time, all the time, all the time, but he never speaks about Arsenal. 

He is always speaking about other families. It is a sickness ? being a voyeur is a sickness. Now and again you have to speak about your opponents, you have to answer a few things ? it is part of the game. You have to try and put pressure on them and send a message but when you do it all the time in the same direction it looks like a sickness. 

Mourinho was quick to spell out that the Premiership leaders are 14 points clear of Arsenal, who have lost three of their five league away matches this season. 

You can do it when you have big morale but when you are on game number 11 and you still cant win away from home and when, without Thierry Henry, you cant win a game, he should be worried about them, he said. 

But he is worried about us because he is always speaking about us ? Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea. I dont know if he wants my job, but he loves Chelsea. 

I have spoken to him when Ive met him and hes always correct, no problem. But I think he must have a problem. You have to solve your own problems. I must be worried that my team made defensive mistakes (against Blackburn) and I shouldnt be worried about what Arsenal did at Tottenham. I dont care what Arsenal did. 

Mourinho could not resist another dig at Arsenals bungled penalty against Manchester City last week, when Robert Pires failed in his attempt to roll the ball into the path of Henry, who was running in. For a better picture, they wanted be part of the show-off story and take the ball with them to the goal, Mourinho said. 

I remember an FC Porto game with Varzim when we were winning well. I ordered the goalkeeper Nuno to step forward to shoot a penalty. 

That night I arrived home thinking, If the score was 0-0 I wouldnt do it, so why did I? Because it was four or five nil? I didnt feel so well, despite my intention of giving some morale to a player. Today I shouldnt do it.

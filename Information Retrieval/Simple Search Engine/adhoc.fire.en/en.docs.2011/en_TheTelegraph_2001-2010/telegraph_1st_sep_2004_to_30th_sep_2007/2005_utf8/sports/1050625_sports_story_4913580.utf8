 Spurs deadline on Arnesen issue

Tottenham Hotspur are demanding that Chelsea agree to their compensation proposal by Saturday for the impending loss of Frank Arnesen. If not, they claim that they will make a complaint to the FA Premier League over what they believe was an illegal approach for the Dane. 

Tottenham are seeking ?8 m, or the transfer of Wayne Bridge, the Chelsea left back, who is recovering from a broken ankle, in addition to a cash sum to settle the dispute over their sporting director, who was suspended from his duties on June 4 after he told the club that he wanted to leave for Stamford Bridge. 

Relations between the clubs worsened on Thursday after photographs were published of Arnesen relaxing with Roman Abramovich on the Chelsea owners yacht off the coast of Sardinia. Over the past two weeks, Tottenham have sought a resolution that might include a player leaving Chelsea for White Hart Lane. 

Chelsea will be keen for a swift and amicable resolution after the club was fined ?300,000 and given a suspended three-point deduction over the tapping-up saga involving Ashley Cole, the Arsenal left back. THE TIMES, LONDON

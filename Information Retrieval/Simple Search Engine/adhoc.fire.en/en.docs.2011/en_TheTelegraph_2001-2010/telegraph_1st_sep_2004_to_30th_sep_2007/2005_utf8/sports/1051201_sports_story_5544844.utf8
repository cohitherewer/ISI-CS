 Sasikiran defeats Russian GM

Khanty-Mansiysk (Russia): Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran out-maneuvered GM Sergei Rublevsky of Russia in the first game of the second round of the Chess World Cup here. 

National champion GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly was held to a draw by Georgian GM Levan Pantsulaia while former world junior champion P. Harikrishna lost to Giovanni Vescovi of Brazil. 

In the biggest upset of the event so far, top seed Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine was beaten by young Bulgarian GM Ivan Chaparinov while another high-flier, Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan was outdone by GM Murtas Kazhgaleyev of Kazakhstan. 

Sasikiran now just needs a draw in the return game to advance to the third round of the Cup. Starting with the queen pawn game, Sasikiran faced the Queens Gambit Accepted. 

Right from the opening, Sasikiran kept looking at opportunities to complicate the battle and it was this attitude that reaped high dividends. 

The middle game was highly complex with Sasikiran having double bishops and a fractured pawn structure against Rublevskys double knight and a seemingly impregnable position that was ripped apart in quick time. 

Launching his counter-play on the king side, Sasikirans bishops spat fire all over the board and the Indian caught Rublevsky off-guard in the tactical complexities to win the queen for just a rook. 

Simplifying immediately after, Sasikiran was happy with an extra piece when Rublevsky got dejected and resigned on his 31st move. (PTI)

 New Delhi: Top golfer Jeev Milkha Singh was on Friday roped in as the brand ambassador to promote Indian handicrafts and master crafts across the globe by the ministry of textile.

 Jeev would be part of a promotional campaign ? ?Real life, real heroes?, aimed at creating global awareness about Indian handicrafts, and would be joined by some other sports personalities of the country.

 ?I feel that handicrafts have always been a part of our rich cultural heritage but neither have we promoted it in the global market nor helped the craftsmen, who are primarily from villages and put in so much of hard work behind these products,? said Jeev.

 ?They have done our country proud like any sportsperson and their products are highly appreciated in foreign markets and we are going to project this rich art of India.?

 Paris: Australian Open champion Serena Williams pulled out of the Paris Open with gastro-enteritis on Friday.

 The American top seed was to meet Russias Dinara Safina in the quarter finals but was unable to play because of stomach problems.

 quot;Im not playing today because Im sick and mentally Im not well, quot; she told the Parisian crowd in French on court. quot;I wanted to play here because its the first tournament I won and its very important to me. quot;

 Williams won her first WTA Tour victory at the Parisian indoor tournament in 1999.

 London: Formula One could see another independent team change ownership after the recent takeovers of Jordan and Jaguar, FIA president Max Mosley hinted on Thursday.

 ?I think there are negotiations going on with one of the remaining independent teams as I understand it,? he said.

 Minardi boss Paul Stoddart said his team was not for sale. Sauber were not available for comment.

 Jordan were bought by the Midland Group of Russian-born Canadian businessman Alex Shnaider last month while Red Bull purchased Jaguar from Ford in November and changed the name.

 Madrid: Real Madrid have denied reports that they are interested in an exchange deal involving England striker Michael Owen and Arsenal forward Jose Antonio Reyes. ?Real Madrid are not considering any exchange deal involving Michael Owen and Arsenal?s Jose Antonio Reyes,? the Primera Liga side said on Friday.

 Reports of a exchange deal between the two clubs have surfaced in recent weeks, with the speculation reaching fever pitch after Reyes told an impersonator from the Cope radio station in Spain that he was not happy in London and was keen on a move to Real. 

 Vienna: Austrian police are to launch an investigation into whether a goalkeeper at Austrian club SW Bregenz was involved in a match-fixing scandal that has rocked neighbouring Germany, police said on Thursday.

 Austrian police said referee Robert Hoyzer, the man at the centre of Germany?s biggest match-fixing scandal in 30 years, told German authorities there was a link between his accomplices and Bregenz, who are bottom of the Austrian first division.

 ?There is the suspicion that there were links between this group and Bregenz and that in particular a goalkeeper was involved,? the head of police in the western Vorarlberg province, Elmar Marent, said in a telephone interview.

 He added that it was not specified which goalkeeper may have been involved. ?The criminal division (of the police) has been charged with launching the investigation. It will start tomorrow.?

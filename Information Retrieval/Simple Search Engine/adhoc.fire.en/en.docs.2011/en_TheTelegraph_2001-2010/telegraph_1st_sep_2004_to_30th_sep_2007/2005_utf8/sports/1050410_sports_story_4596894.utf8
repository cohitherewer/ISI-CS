 New Delhi: National champion Anup Sridhar, Arvind Bhat and Thomas Kurien registered contrasting wins to move into the pre-quarter finals at the Polish Open badminton championship in Spala, Poland.

 While Sridhar needed just 35 minutes to beat Zeon Aabenhuus of Denmark 15-10, 15-1, Bhat was stretched well over an hour by another Dane, Jasper Ipsen, before winning 9-15, 15-9, 15-11 in the third round of this grade A event, according to information received here on Saturday.

 The third Indian in the fray, Kurien, defeated local boy Dariusz Zieba 15-11, 15-13. 

 London: The pavilion at Lord?s, one of cricket?s most well-known landmarks, was re-opened after an ? 8 million refurbishment project.

 The building was re-opened on Friday by Tom Graveney, the former England batsman and now president of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) together with England A batsman Alistair Cook.

 Organisers of London?s bid for the 2012 Olympics hope to stage the archery competition at Lord?s.

 However, for all the money spent on updating the pavilion, one tradition remained intact. There was no play at Lord?s on Friday, the first day of a four-day match, because of rain. 

 London: Winger Ryan Giggs is likely to miss Manchester United?s FA Cup semi-final against Newcastle on April 17 through injury.

 United manager Alex Ferguson told MUTV on Friday that the Welsh international was ?very doubtful? for the game at Cardiffs Millennium stadium because of a hamstring injury.

 ?I don?t think he will make it,? Ferguson said.

 Giggs, who picked up the injury against Blackburn last weekend, will definitely miss United?s trip to bottom club Norwich City on Saturday. 

 Bogota: A Colombian football fan has won the right to change his name to his favourite club but only after a tortuous seven-year legal battle.

 The ruling handed down on Friday by the country?s constitutional court allows the 55-year-old supporter to call himself Deportivo Independiente Medellin Giraldo Zuluaga.

 Giraldo is Medellin?s number one fan ? he never misses a game in company with the club?s mascot, his dog, who wears the club?s red and blue colours...And barks to celebrate a goal.

 ?I?ve been waiting for my dream to be realised for seven years,? said Giraldo, who has also decked his house out in Medellin colours.

 ?Medellin is the team I support with pride in my soul and in my heart,? he added. ?I?ve made sacrifices to get to this point. Now you can call me Deportivo Independiente Medellin or DIM.?

 Medellin put an end to a 45-year trophy famine in 2002, lifting the Colombian league title. 

 London: English Premier League referee Mike Dean has been suspended for the rest of the season after an investigation into his involvement with a betting website.

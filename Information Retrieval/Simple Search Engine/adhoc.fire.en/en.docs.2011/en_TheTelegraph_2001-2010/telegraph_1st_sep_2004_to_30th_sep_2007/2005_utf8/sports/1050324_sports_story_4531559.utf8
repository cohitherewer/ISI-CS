 Greek duo not to race again

Athens: Greek sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou will not race again despite being acquitted of charges of missing three dope tests, Greek athletics head Vassili Sevatis said. 

?I believe Kenteris and Thanou won?t race again,? Sevatis told Parliament on Tuesday. ?It does not matter if they are found guilty at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the current decision is reversed. The damage to their commercial interests has already been done.? 

Kenteris, the 2000 Sydney Olympics 100 m champion and Thanou, the Sydney women?s 100 m silver medallist, withdrew from last year?s Athens Olympics after missing a doping test on the eve of the Games. 

They were cleared by a Greek athletics federation disciplinary commission last Friday which ruled that the athletes were victims of incorrect procedures. 

The commission decided Kenteris was guilty of missing one test while Thanou had missed two. According to IAAF rules, athletes must miss three or more tests in the space of 18 months. (Reuters)

 Mudassar interim coach

New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain and coach Mudassar Nazar was named as Kenya?s interim coach on Monday following the resignation of Andy Moles on Saturday. 

Mudassar was already working with the Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) being in charge of the KCA Academy. 

?In the interim basis, we have appointed Mudassar to coach the national team besides running the academy,? KCA chairman Sharad Ghei was quoted as saying by a website. However, Ghei did not comment on Moles? departure soon after he had committed his future to Kenya. 

?He finishes his contract with KCA on February 28,? Ghei said. ?He will spend this time handing over and then proceed to take up his new post in March.?

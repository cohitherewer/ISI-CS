 Ponting warning to Vaughan amp; Co.

 - Brett Lee brightens Test chances 

 Lee will be over the moon if he gets the Test call 

London: Australias comprehensive one-day win over England on Sunday should act as a warning that the world champions are at last finding their form just before the Ashes, according to Ricky Ponting. 

Asked if the seven-wicket victory, built on five wickets from Brett Lee and a Ponting century, should be seen as an important pointer, the Australian captain replied: Yes, I think so. 

The good thing is that it also proves to us what we can do. We havent come out today and done anything differently, weve just done the little things better, which has been missing from the first few weeks of the tour so far. 

The sides are now level at 1-1 with the deciding one-dayer at The Oval on Tuesday. The Ashes begin at Lords on July 21. 

Ponting accepted that the toss has helped his bowlers get the best of the early seam movement at Lords but said he felt the key to the result had been an intense training session on Saturday. 

We spoke a lot about those things. It was a pretty big game for us. We billed it that way before the game. Im not surprised at all that Im sitting here having won the game so convincingly. 

I felt there was a little more spark about us over the last couple of days. 

He was also delighted with his own return to form after a run of poor scores. 

It was nice to score a hundred at Lords. I havent exactly set the world on fire yet and its my first century at the home of cricket, and Bretts first five-wicket haul. Its a nice milestone. 

Meanwhile, Lee did his chances of a Test recall no harm at all by taking five wickets . 

Despite his standing as one of the worlds quickest bowlers, Lee hasnt played Test cricket for over a year since appearing against India in Sydney in January last year. 

 Lee could well feature instead of Jason Gillespie whose lacklustre start to the tour continued Sunday with seven wicketless overs costing 42 runs. 

Its always great to take early wickets, said Lee, whose figures were the best by an Australian in a one-day International at Lords. 

On a personal note, I trained very hard Saturday in the nets and worked on some different balls. To take five wickets at Lords is special. 

I was pretty disappointed I missed out, but I have put that right behind me now. Im not worried about looking to the future anymore. Im just focussed on what I am doing right now, said the 28-year-old New South Wales quick. 

Im not looking too far ahead but if I get the call to play in the XI come Lords on July 21 Ill be over the moon, to say the least.

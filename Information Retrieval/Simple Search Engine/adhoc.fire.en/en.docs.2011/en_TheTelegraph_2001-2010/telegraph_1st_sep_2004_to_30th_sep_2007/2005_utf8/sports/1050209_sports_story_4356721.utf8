 Agassi in Davis Cup after five years

San Jose: Captain Patrick McEnroe used his powers of persuasion to convince Andre Agassi to return to the US Davis Cup team after a five-year absence. 

The 34-year-old Agassi said on Monday that McEnroe had told him he would not necessarily have to commit to playing every tie this year for the Americans, who have not won the Davis Cup since 1995. 

Agassi will join world No. 3 Andy Roddick and the doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan in taking on Croatia in a World Group first-round tie at Carson, California, from March 4 to 6. 

?Over the last few weeks, I have had several conversations with McEnroe and all the members of the Davis Cup team,? said Agassi. ?As a result of those discussions, and their unwavering support, I have decided to play Davis Cup in 2005. 

?The captain and players know that my life will not allow me to play every tie at this stage of my career. Still, they all expressed encouragement which is very much appreciated. I look forward to joining the team.? 

Before McEnroe travelled to Agassi?s Las Vegas home for a meeting last week, the veteran American had expressed doubts about the possibility of making a Davis Cup comeback. 

?Andre was having a dilemma about committing to play every single tie, something that he always felt was extremely important when it came to Davis Cup, and the reality was that it was going to be very difficult for him,? McEnroe said. 

?I told him, ?listen, I?m not asking you to do that, nor are any of the guys on the team, nor does anybody expect that you?re going to do that?. ?I said to Andre, ?don?t cut off your options by saying it?s all or nothing, because to me it?s not?,? McEnroe added. 

?We?ve never had a year when we?ve had the same four guys every match. It?s too unrealistic, with injuries, with different surfaces, with schedules.?

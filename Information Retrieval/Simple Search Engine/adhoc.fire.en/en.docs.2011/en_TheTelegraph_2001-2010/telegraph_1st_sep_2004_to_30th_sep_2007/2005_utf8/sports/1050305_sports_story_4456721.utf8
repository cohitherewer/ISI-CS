 Ramesh sees room for improvement in Sania game

Bangalore: Sania Mirza?s ?meteoric? rise has 

signalled the dawn of a new era in Indian tennis, feels former Davis Cupper Ramesh 

Krishnan, but says the teenager needs to work on her game to face all kinds of 

situations. 

?In the last six weeks or so Sania?s rise has been 

meteoric?, the former Davis Cup captain said. A veteran of many Davis Cup battles, 

Krishnan felt there is room for improvement as far as Sania?s game is concerned. 

?From the little I have seen, she seems to prefer a high bouncing court. She should be ready for all situations?. 

Krishnan described Sania?s performance this week as ?outstanding?. 

On her way to the quarters 97-ranked Sania defeated world No. 36 Jelena Kostanic of Croatia and then overpowered US Open champion and world No. 7 Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia. 

She, however, lost to world No. 28 Jelena Jankovic of Serbia in the last eight. 

On Sania?s ability to break into the top 50 Krishnan noted: ?That would be premature to talk at this point in time?. 

Sania, who aims to be among the top-50 by the end of the year, could see her ranking climb to 77, after her great run at the Dubai Open. The former Davis Cup captain observed that India needs many more ?Sanias? to promote tennis in a big way. 

 ?You need good infrastructure ? be it training or competition so that any outstanding talent will come through?. 

Meanwhile, a day after her dream run at the Dubai Open came to an end, Sania was in a philosophical bent of mind. 

?Tennis is such a game that you win some and lose some. Jelena (Jankovic) played a great match and did not allow me to settle down,? Sania said, looking back at her 2-6, 2-6 defeat in the quarter finals. 

However, she was satisfied with her performance. ?I 

don?t think that it was a bad day. Overall, I?m satisfied with the way I had played 

this week,? she added. 

Meanwhile, Serena Williams quit her Dubai Open semi-final with an arm injury on Friday while trailing Jankovic 0-6, 3-4. 

Jankovic will play top seed Lindsay Davenport who overcame Patty Schnyder 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 earlier in the day.

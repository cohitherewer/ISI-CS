The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Morozevich holds Anand

 Anand leads in all 3 sections 

Monaco: Viswanathan Anand?s winning spree was finally halted by last year?s joint winner Alexander Morozevich as the Russian proved equal to the Indian ace in both blindfold and rapid games of the sixth round of 14th amber chess meet here at Monte Carlo Grand. 

Despite his first drawn result, Anand increased his lead to a staggering 3 points after the blindfold games finished and the lead is likely to at least remain at 2.5 points even though three games in the rapid section were still in progress. 

The Indian stalwart is, in fact, in sole lead in all the three sections, rapid, blindfold and combined. 

Anand, who scored victories in first five mini-matches here, showed no complacency in handling Morozevich who has been a star performer here in the last three editions. 

The Russian, known in the world over for his uncompromising chess, was in full swing in the blindfold game as he went for an audacious variation with black pieces in the French defence. 

Anand secured a better position after the dust subsided but in the middle game, cautious and pragmatic approach by him led the game to a draw after 38 moves. (PTI)

 Sania eager for Grand Slam debut

 It will be another milestone for me, says Sania 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza is only hours away from creating history as she readies to play her first Grand Slam tennis match at the Australian Open in Melbourne Monday. 

The 18-year-old Hyderabad girl will become only the second Indian woman to play in a Grand Slam when she takes on home challenger Cindy Watson in the women?s singles first round. 

Nirupama Vidyanathan registered India?s only win on the Grand Slam stage when she won the first round in the 1998 edition of the Australian Open. 

?I am feeling very good and excited about my match... It is tough to describe. This is what you play for. It will be another milestone for me,? Sania said from Melbourne. 

She won the junior Grand Slam title in the girls? doubles at the Wimbledon two years ago. Incidentally, Sania, as did Nirupama seven years ago, has entered the main draw, courtesy a wild card. The Indian was extended the offer after reaching the women?s singles final of the Asian tennis championships last year. 

Signs are positive for Sania to emulate Nirupama as she is drawn to play another wild card. Twenty-seven year old Watson is ranked 294 on the WTA Tour and has competed four times in her home Grand Slam. Her best performance came in 2002 when she reached the third round. That was also the year when she had her best ranking of 131. 

While Watson has experience, Sania has more titles to her credit. She has already won 12 tournaments ? five more than her rival. And her ranking has shot up to 169 as she maintained her form through the close of last season when she reached her maiden final in a $50,000 event. 

But Sania has her feet firmly on the ground. 

?It is a good draw for me. But it is who plays the best tennis on the day wins. I am concentrating on playing my best game and give my heart out,? she said. Sania had a minor scare ahead of the tournament as she hurt her left ankle during a match a few days ago. But she confirmed that she had fully recovered. 

?I am fully fit now,? she said. Sania arrived in Australia two weeks ago and played in the qualifying rounds of a WTA event in Hobart where lost in the second round. 

Her clash with Watson would be the first on court 6 at 11.00 am local time (5.30 am IST). The teenager is drawn in the bottom quarter that features Serena Williams, whom she could meet in the third round. ?I hope I do,? she gushed. 

?But let me first get through the first round.? (PTI)

 5-hour surgery on Di Stefano 

Madrid: Surgeons carried out a quadruple bypass surgery on Real Madrid great Alfredo Di Stefano on Wednesday and said the operation was normal. 

The 79-year-old Argentine football legend was admitted to hospital after a heart attack on Saturday. Wednesdays operation at Valencias La Fe hospital took five hours, the hospital said in a statement. 

The operation went normally and his heart performed within the expected parameters, it said. 

Di Stefano had been transferred to the resuscitation unit where he was receiving ventilatory assistance, but had no significant complications. These first 24 hours are important because it is the time when complications can appear more frequently, the statement said. (Reuters)

 Loss no setback, insists Federer

 - It took me a few minutes to realise I had won, says 18-year-old Gasquet

Monaco: World No. 1 Roger Federer insists his bid to add the French Open to his glittering Grand Slam collection is still on track despite his sensational defeat at the hands of French teenager Richard Gasquet at the Monte Carlo Masters here (as reported in Saturday?s Late City edition). 

The 6-7 (1-7), 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) quarter final loss to the world No. 101 was only his second in his last 53 matches, a run stretching back to the US Open last year. It also threw into turmoil his build-up to the French Open, which gets underway in five weeks and is the only Grand Slam title which has eluded him. 

Federer insisted on Friday he has plenty of time to put his game in shape. 

?This is not a setback at all,? said the Swiss superstar, whose epic defeat brought to an end his 25-match winning run in 2005 and was just a second loss in 53 matches since the US Open last year. 

It was also particularly frustrating as he wasted three match points in the nerve-shredding final set tie-break. 

?It?s still too early. If I had won here, it wouldn?t help me much because at the French Open it?s the best of five sets and only there we will really see how good I am playing. 

?I still think it?s a good start to the clay court season. I always hope to play well and it would have been nice to keep the streak alive but I have won three matches here so it?s a good result for a first tournament of the season on clay. 

?I know what I have to work on and I know where I can still improve. I think it was the right choice to come to Monaco,? Federer said. 

Gasquet, who is just 18 and had to qualify to reach the main draw, admitted he was stunned by his win. ?To beat the best player in the world is fabulous,? said Gasquet. ?When I won the match, it took me a few minutes to realise I had won. It?s difficult to realise what has happened and where I am but I know that I have to keep going.? 

Two weeks ago, Federer was having all sorts of problems subduing another 18-year-old in the shape of Spain?s Rafael Nadal who led two sets to love and 4-1 in the final of Miami Masters. 

Ironically, Nadal and Gasquet face each other here in the semi-finals here. 

?Nadal has played more big matches, a Davis Cup final for example. Has Gasquet played a 27,000-seater? I don?t think so. Nadal has got that little bit of advantage over Gasquet. But they both have got a great game.? 

However Federer believes Gasquet can use this result as a launchpad for better things. 

?I?ve hardly seen him play on surfaces other than clay,? said Federer. ?He stands very far back and he?s got a great backhand, probably one of the best single-handed backhands I have seen. He can hit it really hard on both sides, up the line and crosscourt. 

?He returns really well, especially off the second serve but I don?t know how that will work on hard courts. He?s dangerous. He?s got the tools, it?s a matter of consistency. I think a result like this at Monte Carlo should boost his motivation,? Federer said. 

He admitted that the end of his 25-match winning run could turn out to be a blessing in disguise. ?It?s tough to wake up every morning knowing you have to defend a streak. I feel like I am playing against history, against the other players, so it?s not easy.?

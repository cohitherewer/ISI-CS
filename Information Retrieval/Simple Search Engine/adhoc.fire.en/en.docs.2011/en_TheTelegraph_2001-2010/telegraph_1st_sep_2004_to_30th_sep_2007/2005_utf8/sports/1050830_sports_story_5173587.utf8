The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England cant believe in their 

 superiority over old enemy 

 - Lee and Warne have shown they have the stomach for battle 

 at any time

 Fear of failure is a familiar 

 demon for all athletes, but many of them know that fear 

 of success is still more ferocious. Fear of ultimate success 

 ? the culminating triumph that will satisfy all your cravings 

 in one moment of perfection ? is the most fearsome demon 

 that can be found in the entire panoply of sport.

 On Sunday, England were savaged 

 by that demon and what looked at one stage like a walk in 

 the park became a journey of hard and bitter agonies. But 

 they did it, somehow stumbling over the line to beat Australia 

 by three wickets after being set only 129 to win. That gives 

 England a 2-1 lead in the series with one match to go ? 

 the first time they have not lost an Ashes series since 

 1986-87. Triumph indeed. 

 The snag is, of course, that to 

 win back the Ashes they need to win the series outright, 

 so they must win or draw at The Oval if they are to fulfil 

 what has been the ultimate dream of English cricket for 

 all but two decades. The going has been tough enough so 

 far, Lord knows what kind of heavy weather England will 

 make of things on the five days that begin on September 

 8.

 Just when Wimbledon was safely 

 over, the England cricket team has set out to outdo Tim 

 Henman as a cause of national neurosis. One unbearable climax 

 has followed another as England have repeatedly outplayed 

 Australia and have repeatedly found it hard, if not impossible, 

 to make the killing stroke. The finger freezes on the trigger, 

 the hand on the hilt of the knife. England simply cannot 

 believe in their own superiority over the old enemy.

 The Australia side are a shadow 

 of their former selves, but two men ? and two men alone 

 ? have repeatedly shown that they have the stomach for battle 

 at any time, of any kind, at any odds. Brett Lee and the 

 incomparable Shane Warne ran England ragged in what should 

 have been a triumphal march.

 Twist after twist after twist: 

 just when you think that the plot of this summer can find 

 no further complexity, another rich and savage day emerges, 

 bringing with it new heroics, new heroes, more men savouring 

 the taste of failure for the first time. It is all getting 

 to be more than the nation can bear. Thank God there is 

 only one more match to come, and we can get back to something 

 safe such as football.

 England had Australia down and 

 defeated before play began, but neither side was prepared 

 to accept that obvious fact ? especially not England. They 

 took the last six Australia wickets with tentative, nerve-racking, 

 attritional cricket, never quite putting the boot in. It 

 lasted too long: Australia got too many runs. It gave Australia 

 a forlorn hope of victory. But for some athletes, there 

 is no such thing as a forlorn hope.

 Warne is one of those men. He 

 seized control of the ball and, it seems, of the Australia 

 team, taking over the bowling at the sixth over and ripping 

 out the super-confident Marcus Trescothick with his first 

 ball. Seven balls later, still without conceding a run, 

 he had the England captain, Michael Vaughan. The demons 

 were unleashed, and they ran amok through the England side.

 Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen 

 put on 46 together and seemed to bringing the match to sanity. 

 But nothing in this utterly exceptional series is sane for 

 long. The two of them went in quick succession and Lee got 

 them both, bowling at express pace and with a mad belief 

 that the impossible was well within his grasp. Especially 

 against the Poms.

 Hysteria had got among the England 

 batsmen and, in the end, it was down to the bowlers to finish 

 the job. They needed 13 more runs: a nugacity, a mountain. 

 There was blood in the water and the Australians were in 

 feeding frenzy. Ashley Giles and Matthew Hoggard to get: 

 the miracle was on. 

 But Giles and Hoggard stuck it 

 out in a cheer-every-run nerve-stretcher and that, perhaps, 

 was most appropriate of all. This has been a team performance 

 in a summer of team performances, and the pattern has been 

 throughout that when one English player fails, another stands 

 up for his time of glory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Port Trust hold Md. Sp.

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting shared points with Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) at the Kalyani Stadium on Thursday. The black-and-white brigade, after winning its first three CFL Premier Division matches, have managed just one point in the next three. 

Not a goal may have been scored in 90 minutes, but there was no dearth of action, according to information received here. A quarter of an hour into the match, Mohammedan Sporting striker K.P. Zubair put the ball into the CPT net. 

Referee Kashinath Sen, however, pulled Zubair up for pushing goalie Sandip Guha and disallowed the goal. 

CPT had reasons to be aggrieved as well. Striker James Ogu was tripped by Madhusudan Majumdar as he was about to aim for goal from an advantageous position. CPTs claims, though, fell on deaf ears.

In mens compound, two Indians ? Naresh Damor and Vivek Kumar ? reached the last four, assuring at least one medal in the category. 

In the recurve section, Tarundeep Rai and Jayant Talukdar among men, and Reena Kumari among women made it to the last-eight before losing out narrowly to the Koreans.

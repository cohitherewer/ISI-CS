 I dont visualise any awkwardness

 Calcutta:The other day, 

 Jawagal Srinath spoke about Rahul Dravid always being politically 

 correct. The new Team India captain certainly 

 lived up to that reputation when The Telegraphcontacted 

 him, on his cellphone, Tuesday. 

Please dont lob questions which could put me in trouble, Dravid pleaded, laughing. 

Not that he lands into controversies, but the desire to be a million miles from anything controversial is understandable. 

Dravid, after all, has just been made full-fledged captain. The appointment is for the July 30-August 9/10 tri-series in Sri Lanka, but who knows what the future holds? 

From Bangalore to Cardiff (Sourav Gangulys temporary home), nobody is quite sure. 

Captaining the country is an honour? Ive done it in the past (five Tests, 12 ODIs) and, so, it wont be something new, Dravid remarked, adding: However, be it one match or a tournament, the honour element never changes? 

But, surely, he must be happy theres nothing provisional about his captaincy? 

Well, yes, everybody can do with a bit of time and clarity? This holds good for individuals and teams? It helps to be able to put thoughts together in a clear frame of mind, Dravid answered. 

In the past, there have been instances when he didnt get too many hours to prepare for a job regarded as the toughest after the Prime Ministership. 

Mark Taylor remains Dravids favourite captain. Steve Waugh, Nasser Hussain and Stephen Fleming have also made an impact on the Bangalorean. 

His own approach is simple: Whether one is leading a cricket team or an organisation, one has to do so by example? The challenges have to be met head-on. 

Asked whether there would be awkwardness if Souravs ban got lifted and he joined the squad, Dravid replied: Weve been teammates and friends for many years? I dont visualise any awkwardness. 

Sourav and Dravid, it may be recalled, made their Test debut together ? at Lords, in 1996. 

Dravid didnt talk at length on the composition of the tri-series squad, but did say: The rookies (Suresh Raina and Yalaka Venugopal Rao) and J.P.Yadav have been rewarded for consistency in domestic cricket. 

Im sure they have much to offer at the international level as well? Their presence does give us options. 

Dravid wont forget Monday in a hurry, but insisted he didnt celebrate being handed Team Indias independent charge. 

I have, at some point or the other, already told you I dont believe in celebrations? I stayed at home and hit the bed early, he informed, laughing again. 

 Incidentally, thanks to hundreds of congratulatory 

 calls, Dravids cellphone had called it a day before 

 he did! 

 Footnote: Its not clear 

 whether Sourav and Dravid have spoken to each other, since 

 Monday, but coach Greg Chappell apparently called the former 

 (in Cardiff) soon after the squad was picked.

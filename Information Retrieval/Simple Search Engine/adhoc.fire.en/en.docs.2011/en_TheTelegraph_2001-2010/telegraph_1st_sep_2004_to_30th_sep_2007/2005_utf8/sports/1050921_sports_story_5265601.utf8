The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mike Okoro raring to go

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Nigerian Mike Okoro, who played a stellar role in East Bengals ASEAN Cup victory three years ago, is back again to don the red-and-gold colours. Having spent a season playing for third division Polish outfit Sparta, Okoro will be looking forward to boost East Bengal for the upcoming National League. 

I have scored 27 goals in 32 matches for Sparta last season, but now I need to train with my teammates to attain the required level of fitness, Okoro said on Tuesday . 

Asked whether he would prefer to play upfront or in the midfield, the Nigerian said he was ready to play in any positions. Okoro revealed that it was his Irish girlfriend Barbara who convinced him to play for East Bengal. When I went to Sweden for trials, they were delaying my registration and by that time the date of transfers in Polish League was over. Then I got a call from East Bengal and I decided to come here again, Okoro said.

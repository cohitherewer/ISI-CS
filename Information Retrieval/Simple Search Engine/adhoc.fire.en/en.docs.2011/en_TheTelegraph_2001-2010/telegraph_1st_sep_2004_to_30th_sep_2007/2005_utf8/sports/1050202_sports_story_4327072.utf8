Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami managed to hang on to their slender lead against Fransa Pax Football Club in their fifth round match of the ninth National Football League for the ONGC Cup on Tuesday. 

In a drab encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium, the home team won 2-1, Man of the Match Dinesh Swar scoring once in each half and Sebastiao Endro pulling one back for the visitors in between. 

The home team, though saddled by injuries to Akeem Abolanle, Gouranga Dutta and Surajit Bose, did start on a positive note. 

Surajit let fly a right-footer on the half turn that just missed the target in the 12th minute and Akeem failed to connect a Dinesh floater six minutes hence. 

But, from then on, the match seemed headed for only one destination ? a draw. 

Fransa coach Norbert Gonsalves was lamenting after the match that they missed out on a point and he was quite right. The match remained confined mostly to the midfield where aimless passes and miss-passes dominated. 

Akeem injury robbed Tollygunge of the pace that they needed, but the visitors failed to make use of that advantage. Foreigners Joseph Ogor, Benjamin Ansah and Louis Aniweta were of not much help to the Goans, thus making Tollygunge defenders? task a lot easier. 

That the home side took the lead was more due to a defensive lapse. Gouranga rounded off Saikhon Singh on the right and squared to an unmarked Dinesh inside the box, who slotted home in the 28th minute. 

However, the visitors equalised two minutes later ? an unmarked Sebastiao heading home a Saikhon corner. 

The Goan outfit showed a little more enterprise after the breather and could have gone ahead had Benjamin been able to trap in front of an open goal in the 73rd minute. 

Instead, Tollygunge took the lead five minutes on when rival goalkeeper Rajat Guha failed to fist away a powerful Akeem shot from outside the box. The ball landed close to Dinesh, who did not make any mistake. 

The visitors came close to drawing level in the dying moments of the match. A beautifully executed free-kick from the left by Benjamin was tipped to the post by an alert Tollygunge custodian Arindam Ghosh.

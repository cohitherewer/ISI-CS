 Sourav hands captaincy to Deep

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly, who stepped down from captaincy before the tie against Maharashtra, also made it clear that he will not lead the Bengal squad either in the match against Tamil Nadu starting on Wednesday. Sourav was included as the 15th member. 

Devang Gandhi and Sanjib Sanyal were rested from the squad which was announced on Friday. Left arm spinner Murtaza Lodhgar and batsman wicketkeeper Subhajit Paul have been named as replacements. 

 We have decided to rest Sanjib and Devang. They will play the CAB league matches and will hopefully be fit for the next match, chairman of the CAB senior selection committee Pranab Roy said. 

In the last match against Gujarat, Devang himself opted out, having informed the team management that he needs a break. 

Captain Deep Dasgupta feels that Souravs presence will always be an added advantage. I think Devang has set an example. He knew he was not performing well, so he needed a break. Devang will play the local matches and will hopefully find his rhythm. 

Meanwhile, Sourav was also present at the Eden on Thursday where he practised at the nets and then worked out at the gym for a couple of hours. 

THE SQUAD: Deep Dasgupta (captain), Sourav Ganguly, Arindam Das, Subhamoy Das, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul, Sourashish Lahiri, Shib Sagar Singh, Manoj Tewari, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Murtaza Lodhgar, Subhajit Paul, Asok Dinda. 

Coach: Paras Mhambrey; Manager: Samir Dasgupta.

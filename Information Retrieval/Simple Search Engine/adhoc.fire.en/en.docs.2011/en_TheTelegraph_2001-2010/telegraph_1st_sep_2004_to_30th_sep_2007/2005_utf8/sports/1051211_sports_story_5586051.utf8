 India pip Bhutan to reach last 4

 - SAFF CUP 

 Bhaichung Bhutia drew first blood 

Lahore: India booked a semi-final berth in the South Asian Football Federation Championship when they beat Bhutan 3-0 in their group encounter in Karachi on Saturday. 

India, who led 1-0 at half-time, thanks to a fine goal by skipper Bhaichung Bhutia just before the break, scored through Mahesh Gawli and Abdul Hakeem in the 52nd and 66th minutes, respectively to register their second successive victory in the eight-nation tournament at the Peoples Sports Complex. 

The winners of the 1993, 1997 and 1999 editions of the SAFF Cup joined hosts Pakistan and Maldives in the last four of the competition. 

In their first match, two goals by Mehtab Hussain were enough for India to get the better of Nepal 2-1. 

Coach Syed Nayeemuddins side takes on defending champions Bangladesh on Monday in their final league encounter.

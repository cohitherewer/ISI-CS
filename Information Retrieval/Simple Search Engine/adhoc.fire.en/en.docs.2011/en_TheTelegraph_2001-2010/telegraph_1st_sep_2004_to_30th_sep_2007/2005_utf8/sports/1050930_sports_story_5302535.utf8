 Silver for Shaileja

New Delhi: Indian women weightlifters put up an impressive show by winning two silver medals along with four bronze at the Asian Weightlifting Championships in Dubai. 

Pujari Shaileja bagged the silver medal in the 75kg category while Nansita Devi won three bronze medals in 69 kg, Indian weightlifting federation said. 

Shaileja lifted 239 kg overall for her silver winning effort. Chinas Zang Shaoling won the gold medal hoisting 244 kg while Kazakhistans Irina Valkova also lifted 239kg but had to be satisfied with a bronze as the Indian had a lighter body weight, IWF president H. J. Dora said. 

Shaileja also claimed the bronze in the snatch and a silver medal in the clean and jerk event. 

Earlier Nansita won three bronze medals in the womens 69 kg class. She hoisted 93 kg in the snatch and 110 kg in the clean and jerk for a combined lift of 203kg on Wednesday. 

In the mens section, Indias four-member team failed to impress with a sixth place finish being the best performance among them.

 Emotional help too for Gilmour

 - Balls rolling, says ACA president Healy

Dambulla: The Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) support for ailing Gary Gilmour wont be limited to a financial hand-out, but includes emotional help as well. 

Thats what we intend doing... I cant give you specifics, yet the ball is rolling, ACA president Ian Healy, who is here as a tri-series commentator, told The Telegraph. 

Healy, also Test crickets most successful wicketkeeper, added: Our Hardship Fund will take care of the financial component, with the members themselves handling Garys emotional needs... 

As reported in these columns on Sunday, former captain Ian Chappell has taken the lead in ensuring Gilmour undergoes a liver transplant and remains comfortable thereafter. 

The Hardship Fund is overseen by a committee which includes a Cricket Australia (CA) representative. In fact, the ACA is dependent on the national body for much of its funding. 

The players only want a fair deal and the ACA plays its part... Recently, we reached another (five-year) understanding with CA covering employment conditions, remuneration and playing conditions, Healy remarked. 

He expressed surprise that the Indian Cricket Players Association, formed almost three years ago, doesnt have the Boards recognition. Its another matter that the body itself has done next to nothing. 

Its old fashioned to think the players are going to do anything which can impact on the game... The players and administrators need to understand and respect each other, Healy said. 

Incidentally, Rodney Marshs son Paul has just taken over as the ACA chief executive.

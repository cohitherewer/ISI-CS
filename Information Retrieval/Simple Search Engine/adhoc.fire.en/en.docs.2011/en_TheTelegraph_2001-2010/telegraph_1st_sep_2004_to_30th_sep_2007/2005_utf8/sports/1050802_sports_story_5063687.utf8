The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India stay at 7th spot

London: Indias indifferent form in the shorter version of the game (the last six-wicket victory over the West Indies not included) has ensured that they continue to languish at seventh place after the annual update of the ICC one-day International ratings. 

India compiled 95 points in the latest ratings, two less than the previous ratings. Only the West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh trail the men in blue in the annual update. 

World champions Australia remain comfortably clear at the top of the table with an unchanged tally of 136 points. 

They have always been the top side in the ICC ODI championship since the official ratings were introduced in October 2002. 

However, second-placed Sri Lanka gained three points to cut the Australian lead at the top to 16 points. 

Pakistan are the major mover in the annual update, climbing from fifth to third in the table. 

Their tally has improved from 112 to 116. 

New Zealand trail Pakistan only when the ratings are recalculated to three decimal places. If the kiwis win their next ODI, they will move above Pakistan into the top three position. 

South Africa and England are ranked fifth and sixth, respectively, in the update. 

Kenya have not been accorded a ranking as they have played only two ODIs since August 2003.

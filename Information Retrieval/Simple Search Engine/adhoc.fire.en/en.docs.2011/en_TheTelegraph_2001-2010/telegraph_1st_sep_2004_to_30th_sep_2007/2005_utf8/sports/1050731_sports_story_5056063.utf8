 Lebedeva, Arron in jackpot contention 

Oslo: Frenchman Ladji Doucoure held off a strong field including four-time world champion Allen Johnson to win the 110m hurdles at the Bislett Games on Friday in the final meeting before the World Athletics. 

On a good night for France, the contest for the million dollar Golden League jackpot narrowed to French sprinter Christine Arron and Russian triple jumper Tatyana Lebedeva after American Lashinda Demus lost in the 400m hurdles. 

Doucoure, 22, beat three Americans in one of the strongest high hurdles fields this year in a time of 13.00 seconds. Joel Brown trailed in 13.22 and Terrence Trammell, the Olympic silver medallist from Athens and Sydney, finished third in 13.27. 

Johnson, the 1996 Olympic gold medallist returning after a four-week injury break, could manage only fourth in 13.34 in the refurbished Bislett Stadium which included Norways King Harald among the spectators. 

Doucoure, the most recent addition to an exclusive club who have clocked under 13 seconds, said the World Athletics in Helsinki from August 6 to 14 would bring different pressures. Its another race, and the game begins again, he said. 

Demus stumbled at the line in the 400m hurdles to be overtaken by compatriot Sandra Glover, the 2003 world silver medallist, and Polands Anna Jesien. The 22-year-old American finished third, putting her out of the jackpot race with three of the six Golden League meetings remaining. 

I stumbled. I think my legs kind of gave out on me and I got over-excited and tripped over myself, and caught myself before I actually hit the ground, Demus said.

Adelaide: Australia were on course for a 3-0 sweep against the West Indies after a controversial fourth days play in the third and final Test on Monday. 

The hosts ended the day on 76 for two, needing a further 106 runs for victory with a full day to go at the Adelaide Oval. 

They were set 182 to win after leg spinner Shane Warne and fast bowler Brett Lee combined to dismiss the tourists for 204 just after tea. 

Warne, turning the ball at alarming angles, took six for 80 (his best in this ground) while Lee grabbed the remaining four for 46. 

However, television replays indicated at least three West Indian batsmen were wrongly given out. 

Paceman Corey Collymore then gave the West Indies more cause for optimism when he dismissed opener Justin Langer for 20 and then Australian captain Ricky Ponting for three, just before another decision from Dar went against them. 

Hayden survived and went on to finish the day unbeaten on 38 with Brad Hodge batting on 10 and Australia inching closer to a third straight victory after wins in Brisbane and Hobart. 

Despite the controversy, Warne still succeeded in tormenting the West Indians to complete his 34th five-wicket haul in Tests and break Dennis Lillees record for the most Test wickets at Adelaide Oval. 

The master wrist-spinner and world record holder in Tests also closed to within one wicket of Lillees 1981 world record of 85 in a calendar year. Warne seems certain to break that with Australia due to play two more Tests this year against South Africa. 

Lara (17), playing possibly his last Test on Australian soil, left the field to a standing ovation, stopping twice before he reached the gate to raise his bat and acknowledge the crowds applause. 

Meanwhile, Warne appeared before an International Cricket Council (ICC) judiciary panel on Monday after being charged for dissent. 

The Australian leg spinner was reported by umpires Aleem Dar and Billy Bowden after showing dissent over an appeal against them.

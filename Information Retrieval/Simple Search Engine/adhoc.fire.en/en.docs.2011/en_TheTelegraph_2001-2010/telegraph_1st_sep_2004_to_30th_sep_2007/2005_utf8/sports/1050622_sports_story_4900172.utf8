 England face the Pietersen dilemma

 - In picking the Test squad, selectors may have to ignore a man averaging 162 in ODIs

THE TIMES, LONDON')+]

The England selectors, reduced to an official panel of only three Monday by the resignation of Rod Marsh, suddenly have it in their power to exercise the ultimate in cricketing one-upmanship: not to pick, for the first Test against Australia next month, a man averaging 162 from ten innings in one-day Internationals. 

It is difficult not to be swept away by the manner in which Kevin Pietersen bided his time before pulverising Australias bowlers in Bristol on Sunday and by his record since he first became eligible to play for England in South Africa this year; but Test cricket and 50-over cricket are related no more closely than first cousins. 

Pietersens technique will be searched in five-day cricket by fast bowlers who will be allowed to hound him with close fielders and short-pitched bowling, a far cry from the scattered fields in the later stages of most one-day Internationals. 

Continuity has been the watchword since David Graveney and Geoff Miller began to work with Duncan Fletcher in 1999. If the decision had to be made immediately, which it does not, they might still be inclined towards starting against Australia with Ashley Giles for Gareth Batty as the only change from the side that played Bangladesh in Durham. Pietersen will make his first Test appearance at some point before the Ashes series has finished in September ? providence is almost certain to see to that ? but it is still far from a racing certainty that he will get his first cap at Lords on July 21. 

Memories are still fresh, for some, of the last batsman to come into the England side after an upbringing in southern Africa. Graeme Hick had to wait seven years to qualify for England (part of his problem, certainly) before he made his first appearance against the Australia of the day ? West Indies ? in 1991. By then he had created new records and destroyed bowling attacks, reaching 10,000 first-class runs faster than any other county player and broadening his experience by cutting almost similar swathes through domestic attacks in both New Zealand and Australia. His first seven Test innings produced two ducks, three other single-figure scores and a top score of 43. His final Test average was 31. 

Hick, too, had played a barnstorming one-day innings of 86 not out against West Indies at Lords that first summer of his elevation to the ultimate form of the game. Pietersen is temperamentally quite different and there is a strong case, of course, for deciding now to pick him at the outset of the Ashes series, at the expense of either Ian Bell or Graham Thorpe. 

It is possible that it might have become an unanswerable one by the time that the selectors announce their decision on July 15, but the rough edges in his technique will need to be ironed out gradually in his early years as a Test cricketer. Before that the evidence that he is a bad starter ? he has an unusually high number of low scores ? will have to be weighed against his 21 first-class hundreds. 

Pietersen will be 25 in six days and it seems a pity to wait when he seems so ready, but it can happen when there is an embarrassment of riches. Half a dozen Australia batsmen of recent vintage ? the likes of Law and Love ? would have played far more in other eras. I side with the majority in feeling that Pietersens combination of God-given talent, ambition and single-minded dedication will make him a very successful Test batsman indeed, sooner rather than later, but if Thorpe feels fit and in form by July 15, he might still be the better bet at least to start the series. 

Thorpe badly needs to hit his best form in Surreys only championship match before the selection, against Gloucestershire, by coincidence at Bristol, starting on July 8, but he is a hardened campaigner who has scored five hundreds since his return to the Test side at The Oval in September 1993. 

Bell had a disappointing county match last week after his brilliant maiden hundred against Bangladesh but he has a tighter, more polished technique than Pietersen, whose bottom hand dominates. Nor will Glenn McGrath have failed to notice a tendency to chase the ball outside his off stump too early in an innings when it is moving about. Everyone will be a little wiser when he has batted a possible six more times before a final decision is taken. Rather than be a party to it himself, Marsh, one of the toughest cricketers that Australia have had, resigned as an official selector but remains happy to be consulted as he works with his successor, Peter Moores, to choose this years intake for the National Academy at Loughborough. 

If England win the Ashes, Marsh will expect some more ribbing when he returns home in October. Having admired Pietersens skill and professionalism on the England A tour to India last year, there is not much doubt about what he would advise ? ditch Thorpe and show faith in Bell and Pietersen.

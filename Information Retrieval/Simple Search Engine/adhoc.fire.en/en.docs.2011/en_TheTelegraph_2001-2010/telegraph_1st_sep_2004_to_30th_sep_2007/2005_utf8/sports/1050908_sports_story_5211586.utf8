 Now is the time for serial losers to step up

Such has been the depth of Australias domination that it comes as a genuine surprise to be reminded that I have witnessed England winning the Ashes six times in my years as a journalist. In three of them, what is more, I had the privilege of being on air at the moment of victory. 

When it happened, no one could read the long-term significance of the writing daubed in red paint on the walls of Headingley after Allan Borders 1989 team had won the first Test. Between that match and the one which starts at The Oval on Thursday, there have been 46 encounters, of which England have won only nine ? all but three of them (one in 1997 and two this season) relatively hollow successes when the rubber had been decided. No wonder a nations tummy has been rumbling with hunger these past few weeks. 

Reporters are trained to be objective and it is only when the Ashes go to the less deserving side, as they did in the first series I watched in a professional capacity, in 1968, that impartiality is tested. That series, like the one in 1972 ? when, by contrast, Australia were clearly developing a younger and stronger side ? was drawn, but in both cases the Ashes were retained by the holders. It could happen again this time. Certainly no one should count chickens before the eggshells start to crack. 

There is, however, something dangerously close to national expectation that Englands long drought is about to end. If it does, even now, it will come as a shock to Australians. 

In my youth in the 1950s, one expected England to win as a matter of course, with heroes such as Bedser, May, Cowdrey, Trueman, Tyson, Statham, Lock and Laker. Their defeat by Richie Benauds young side in 1958-59 was the first lesson that the tide always turns eventually. 

The feeling of elation has to be savoured for that reason. In 1972 it was induced by the skill of another great spin bowler, Derek Underwood, who, to much Australian indignation, exploited a grass disease on the square at Headingley. Fusarium oxysporum was suddenly a national talking-point as Deadly became the third bowler, after Laker and Trueman, to take ten wickets in a Test in Leeds. Ray Illingworth, the captain, offered canny support and the Ashes were made safe by the third evening of the fourth Test. 

There was more than a twinge of sympathy for Australia on that occasion, but none five years later on the same ground, when England, again in the fourth Test but this time on the fourth day, won back the Ashes after losing them in a series of dramatic matches in Australia in 1974-75. 

The Chappell bothers, Rod Marsh, Doug Walters, above all Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, were the main substance of a mighty side that maintained control in England the next summer. 

They found their nemesis in Mike Brearley and Ian Botham. There was more than a trace of Duncan Fletchers single-mindedness about Brearley. Under his astute man-management, England made absolutely the most of their resources in 1977. 

They avoided their customary defeat against Australia at Lords, won at Old Trafford and Trent Bridge and then insured themselves against defeat at Headingley . 

 The time and place were perfect for him. What I said then is still on a tape somewhere in Broadcasting House, but I know exactly the words I used at 4.40 pm on the fourth afternoon of the game, because they were reproduced in the book on the series by Brearley and Dudley Doust: And heres Hendrick again, running in to bowl to Marsh; 63 not out. Marsh swings, high on the off side. Randalls underneath it. This could be the Ashes for England. Hes caught it! Theyve won! Randall turns a cartwheel. The stumps are seized by the players. The crowd comes on to the field and England have regained the Ashes. 

Retaining them in 1978-79 was a matter for less euphoria because Australia were so weakened by Kerry Packers ruthless commercial initiative. 

The series in 1981, of course, was the stuff of legend; the well-documented and never-to-be forgotten summer of Bothams triumph. 

Twenty years is a long time to wait for a reprise. It did not seem likely to be so lengthy a wait when Gattings side won all the prizes in Australia in 1986-87, but complacency had something to do with Englands defeat in the final Test of that tour, when the Ashes were already won. 

The first blocks in the side rebuilt by Border and Bobby Simpson were soon in place. They have not looked back, but Nasser Hussain and Michael Vaughan have planned no less assiduously with Fletcher. If England manage to win another epic match in the next few days, this will have been the best series of all.

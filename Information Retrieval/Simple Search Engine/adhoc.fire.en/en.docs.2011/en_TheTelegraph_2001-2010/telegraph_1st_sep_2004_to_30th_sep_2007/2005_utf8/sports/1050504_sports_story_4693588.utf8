 Speedy turnaround surprises Ernie Els 

London: Confidence restored after winning his third title of the year, Ernie Els is still coming to terms with how quickly he has transformed his game following the disappointment of last month?s US Masters. 

The world number three romped to victory by 13 shots at the Asian Open in China on Monday just three weeks after finishing a career-worst 47th in the opening major of the year. 

?I?m a little surprised it happened as soon as it did,? the 35-year-old South African said on his official website. 

?Mentally and physically, I?ve made a total about turn in the space of a week. 

?I?ve been working hard on putting right a few technical faults in my game, and I could see things turning around in the Johnnie Walker Classic in Beijing. 

?But to be honest with you, my confidence wasn?t there yet and I was basically still searching for my golf swing.? 

Els tied for sixth at the European Tour sanctioned Johnnie Walker, which was played the week before the Asian Open. Once he arrived in Shanghai for last week?s event, however, everything appeared to be falling into place for him. 

?Right from the start of the tournament, I felt like my game was in nice shape,? he said. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I did my best, but Czink was better

My loss in the second round of the Sunfeast Open is disappointing. I am aware that people all over the country are feeling low, but then, there are certain things beyond your control. I did my best, but my opponent played better. 

It is no secret that several players hate to win a set 6-0, particularly at an early stage of the match. Andre Agassi I believe, prefers to win a set 6-1 or 6-2. Taking the first set 6-0 puts a certain amount of pressure, in that you feel that you cannot improve further. If you are up against an opponent who possesses the game and ability to come back into the game, you know you are in a spot of bother. Czink is a player who belongs to this category. Hats off to her. 

Even as Czink staged a comeback, my game dropped. I know a lot is being said about my loss to a player who was ranked lower than me, but this is how it is at the top level. Havent I beaten players who were ranked higher than me? Rankings cease to matter at this level of the sport once you enter the playing area. 

In my earlier column, I had stated that a few points here and there make all the difference. That is exactly what happened. There was a stage in the second set when I was leading 3-2 and on breakpoint, notwithstanding Czinks backlash. If I would have won that point, I would have gained a 4-2 lead and it could well have been a different story. But Czink played fabulously to save the breakpoint and make it 3-3. Something similar happened in the third set when scores were level at 4-4. Czink raised her game when it mattered. 

I am looking forward to having a good run in the doubles. Shikha Uberoi is doing well. It would be great if she can pull off an upset over Myskina, who in terms of experience and ranking, is the favourite. But then, the only thing predictable about tennis is its unpredictability!

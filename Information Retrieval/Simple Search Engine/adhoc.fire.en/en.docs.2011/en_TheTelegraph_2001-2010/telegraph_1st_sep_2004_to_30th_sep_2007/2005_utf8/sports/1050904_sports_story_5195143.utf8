 BCCI invites Pak to play

Islamabad: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has offered Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to play in a triangular one-day tournament with India and world champions Australia in September next year. 

BCCI is planning to host a triangular tournament involving Pakistan and Australia, and theyve sounded us off to schedule our future programme accordingly, director cricket operations, PCB, Saleem Altaf was quoted as saying in a daily on Saturday. 

He said the offer to accommodate the series in their next years schedule came during the International Cricket Council meeting held in Dubai last week. 

At the meeting, Pakistan and other countries had asked the ICC to start the new five-year calendar of international cricket programme from 2007 and not to disturb the current Future Tours Programme (FTP) until end of 2006. 

The PCB is already facing scheduling difficulties due to the hectic international programme and has to accommodate some unscheduled one-day events, he said. 

He added that already the PCB had rescheduled its teams tour to Sri Lanka next year with the new programme now including just five one-day Internationals and no Test matches. (PTI)

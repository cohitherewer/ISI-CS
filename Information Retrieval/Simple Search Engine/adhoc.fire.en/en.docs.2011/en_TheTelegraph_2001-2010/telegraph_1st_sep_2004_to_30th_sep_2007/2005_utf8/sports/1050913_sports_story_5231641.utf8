The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 McGraths lack of match practice 

 showed

Guest Column 

Geoffrey Boycott

 Sunday gave us one of the most 

 fantastic mornings of cricket I have ever seen. It was unbelievable. 

 Ive never been to a game and felt the atmosphere so 

 electric from the first ball. 

 The crowd were up for it right 

 from the start, trying to lift England. They knew, we all 

 knew, that somebody needed to produce something special, 

 otherwise Australia were going to bat themselves into an 

 impregnable position.

 England were lucky that the dark, 

 overcast conditions made it perfect for bowling. There had 

 been tremendous overnight rain and the outfield was damp 

 ? and Ive never known rain or bad light to help batsmen. 

 Then Andrew Flintoff and Matthew Hoggard got stuck into 

 them straight away. The ball swung and seamed and Flintoff 

 just got the bit between his teeth.

 Its amazing how a side can 

 be the best in the world for so long and yet throughout 

 this series the only time theyve adapted to swing 

 was when Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer were putting on 

 a century partnership on Friday and Saturday.

 Before the series started, you 

 might have thought that Australia had such high-calibre 

 batsmen ? six of them averaging over 50 and one in the high 

 40s ? that they would be able to deal with swing bowling. 

 I simply cant believe that quality players can produce 

 such ordinary batting, as if theyve never seen it 

 before in their life.

 They play too soon, they play 

 with hard hands, they play on the up ? they do everything 

 wrong and get themselves in a right tangle. 

 That is what Flintoff and Hoggard 

 exploited so brilliantly. It was one of the most dramatic 

 and exciting passages of bowling Ive enjoyed in Test 

 cricket, and for once we were winning it.

 Thinking back, it often feels 

 as if England have been the ones suffering from those inspired 

 spells, at the hands of Curtly Ambrose in Trinidad, or Wasim 

 Akram and Waqar Younis in 1992. This time, Flintoff and 

 Hoggard were unstoppable. 

 England needed some big performances 

 and they got them. Sure, we had a slice of luck with conditions 

 but you still have to have the ability, commitment and desire 

 to take advantage.

 The Oval has a very fast outfield 

 and the pitch is still good. Sunday was a fabulous day for 

 England, they couldnt have imagined in their wildest 

 dreams that they would get a six-run lead.

 Australia will rue being over-cautious 

 in their batting and coming off twice for bad light. Hayden 

 has made a fine hundred in the old-fashioned way, but throughout 

 this innings Australia havent attacked the bowling 

 the way they usually do. 

 They took the cautious approach, 

 because they wanted to make sure they got a big enough lead 

 to bat once in the game. 

 Australias pattern over 

 the past decade or more has been to get that big lead and 

 then let Warne and Glenn McGrath bowl with the opposition 

 under serious pressure. Theres nothing wrong with 

 that, but they have become inflexible. Sticking to a single 

 gameplan can be risky in England, where the weather is not 

 guaranteed the way it is in Australia.

 Their other problem is McGraths 

 lack of match practice. I dont care how great you 

 are, its always a risk to go into a Test unprepared, 

 as he has had to do after suffering two injuries on this 

 tour.

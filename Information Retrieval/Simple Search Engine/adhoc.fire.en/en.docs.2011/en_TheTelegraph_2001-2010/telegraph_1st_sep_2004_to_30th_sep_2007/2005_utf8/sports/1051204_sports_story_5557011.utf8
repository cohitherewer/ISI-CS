Bratislava: Dominik Hrbaty came to Slovakias rescue with a stunning defeat of Croatias Mario Ancic on Friday, just when it looked like his countrys quest for a first Davis Cup crown was fizzling out. 

The Slovakian No. 1 levelled the best-of-five tie at 1-1 with a 7-6, 6-3, 6-7, 6-4 defeat of the towering 21-year-old at the Sibamac Arena. 

The day had begun miserably for the hosts when No. 2 player Karol Beck was ruled out with a knee injury less that three hours before the start. His stand-in Karol Kucera was then overpowered and outclassed by Ivan Ljubicic. 

Ljubicics 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory made him the first player to win 10 consecutive live rubbers in a Davis Cup season since World Group play started in 1981. 

The 26-year-old is now just two wins short of equalling John McEnroes 1982 Davis Cup record of 12-0, although three of the Americans victories were in dead rubbers. 

Honestly, I am not thinking about breaking any records, he told reporters. Although Im really glad that I broke today 10 live rubbers. Thats better than 12 in a row. 

Becks withdrawal was a huge blow to the hopes of Miloslav Mecirs team. His replacement, former world No. 6 Kucera, has slumped to 297 in the world rankings, winning just three matches on the main Tour this year. 

With Kucera facing a near-impossible task against Ljubicic, Hrbatys match against Ancic was vital if Slovakia were not going to head into the weekend 0-2 down. 

He responded in style. 

Neither player offered up a break point in the first set but it was Hrbaty who found inspiration in the tie-break, winning a long baseline exchange at 4-2, then pummelling an ace to carve out four set points. 

The world No. 19 moved up a gear in the second set, breaking serve for the first time in the seventh game when Ancic shunted a backhand into the net. 

Croatia are also appearing in their first final and the occasion appeared to get to Ancic, the 21-year-old gifting Hrbaty the second set with a double fault. 

Ancic dug deep to force the third set into a tie-break and this time it was Hrbaty who wavered, a backhand error and a double fault allowing his opponent to take it to a fourth. 

With the 4,000 capacity crowd cranking up the volume to deafening levels, Hrbaty regained control when he broke Ancic at 2-2 courtesy of a sizzling forehand winner. 

This time he made no mistake, closing out the match in three hours and 13 minutes. 

It was very difficult. I dont really like this kind of game when its all about serving, said Hrbaty, who has been the mainstay of Slovakias run to the final. I think I served perfectly today. 

Ljubicic also benefited from some ferocious serving on the medium-paced indoor surface, giving Kucera precious little chance to make any impression. 

Every thumping winner was met with huge roars from the Croatian fans, for whom Ljubicic has become a hero on a similar level to former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic who yelled out encouragement from courtside. 

Ljubicic put Kucera out of his misery with a flashing crosscourt winner to end a one-sided contest a minute short of two hours. 

I was very, very careful out there. Kucera was once number six in the world and knows how to play at a very high level, said world No. 9 Ljubicic. 

Kucera, Slovakias most successful Davis Cup player, said there was nothing more he could have done. 

I gave it everything I could but he gave me no chance with his service. I only got one break point in the whole match, said the 31-year-old, who is expected to announce his retirement before the end of the year.

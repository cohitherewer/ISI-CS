 Steves no to politics

Melbourne: Former Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh has ruled out plans to enter politics, despite an approach from the opposition Labour party and an association with Prime Minister John Howard. 

Howard launched Waughs autobiography, entitled Out of My Comfort Zone, on Sunday. 

I was asked about my interest in politics but Im not a politician, Waugh told reporters at the launch in Sydney. 

Im not qualified; I dont think I have the knowledge to be a politician. Youve got to know something about everything and its a tough job. My passion lies elsewhere. You never say never but its certainly not on the radar. 

Waugh, 40, was asked to contest a federal seat in Sydney by former Labour leader Mark Latham, though he said the approach did not indicate his preference for either political party. 

I have had different politicians launch books on different occasions but thats not to say Im strong for one side or the other, Waugh said before adding: That was a good political answer actually.

 Sarwan in recovery act

 - SECOND TEST 

- Boje, Ntini strike early blows 

 Sarwan, who batted defiantly for his unbeaten 93, found an able ally in Dwayne Bravo 

Port-of-Spain: Ramnaresh Sarwan stood firm as West Indies struggled to 170 for five at the close on the fourth day of the second Test against South Africa on Monday. 

The hosts, who lost Brian Lara cheaply, were just 119 runs ahead with Sarwan unbeaten on 93 and Dwayne Bravo on 30 following an unbroken sixth-wicket partnership of 78. 

South Africa were earlier dismissed for 398 in reply to West Indies? 347, part-time off-spinner Chris Gayle wrapping up the tourists? innings with four quick wickets. 

Gayle was first out when West Indies batted again, pushing at a slanting delivery from fast bowler Makhaya Ntini and finding the hands of AB de Villiers in the gully. 

South Africa wasted an opportunity to dismiss Sarwan when Jacques Rudolph at short leg failed to reach a looping chance off Ntini. 

Wavell Hinds was dropped by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher off Jacques Kallis before left-arm spinner Nicky Boje broke through, trapping the opener leg before for 22 to end a second-wicket stand of 65 with Sarwan. 

Boje then bowled Lara, who made 196 in the first innings, for four with a delivery that turned sharply and kept low before Ntini struck again with the last ball before tea by trapping Shivnarine Chanderpaul lbw for one. 

West Indies sank to 92 for five in the fourth over after the interval when Ntini yorked Donovan Pagon off his inside edge and they would have been 118 for six if Rudolph had not dropped a straightforward chance at square leg offered by Bravo off fast bowler Monde Zondeki. 

Sarwan batted defiantly, however, facing 190 balls and hitting nine fours, and he found a useful ally in promising all-rounder Bravo as the pair took the hosts through to the close without further loss. 

Earlier, after South Africa had resumed on 370 for six, Gayle struck with his first ball when Boucher, on 28, offered a tame return catch to end a seventh-wicket stand of 71 with Ashwell Prince. 

Three balls later Gayle had Prince caught by Chanderpaul at short extra cover for 45 and Gayle took his third wicket when he bowled Ntini for four. 

The spinner ended the innings six overs later by bowling Andre Nel for six to finish with figures of four for 50. 

Kallis cleared 

Meanwhile, Kallis has been cleared of showing dissent. Kallis was summoned to a hearing on Sunday to explain his reaction to being dismissed in the last over of the second day?s play on Saturday. 

Television cameras captured Kallis venting his frustration verbally after he was trapped in front for 39 by Bravo in South Africa?s first innings. 

?On all the evidence presented the actions of the player did not breach the International Cricket Council Code of Conduct,? Match Referee Jeff Crowe said in a statement Monday. 

The charge was brought by umpires Aleem Dar, David Shepherd and third official Billy Doctrove.

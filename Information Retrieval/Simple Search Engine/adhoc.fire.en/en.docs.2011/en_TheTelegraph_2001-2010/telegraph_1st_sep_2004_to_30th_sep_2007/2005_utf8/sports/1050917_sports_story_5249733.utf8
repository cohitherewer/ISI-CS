 England need a Warne to emulate Aussies: Imran

Karachi: Former Pakistan cricket great Imran Khan on Friday said that he doubted England would ever emulate Australias success and become the worlds top team because they lacked a quality spinner like Shane Warne. 

England are a young emerging side and exude the confidence of Australia, but for them to emulate Australia-like success is difficult because they do not have a spinner of Warnes quality, Imran said. 

Michael Vaughans team closed the gap on world champions Australia when they regained the Ashes with a 2-1 victory on Monday, their first win over Australia since 1986-87. 

Imran praised Vaughan and allrounder Andrew Flintoff for their roles in Englands success. 

Flintoff is the pivot around which the England team revolves. He is a genuine allrounder, he said. 

In Vaughan, England have a very determined sort of character as captain, quite unpretentious, he added. 

But Imransaid England would struggle on the sub-continents slow pitches.They have a fast-maturing pace attack but when they come up on wickets which do not have support for pace then they do not have the variety like Warne provides, Khan said.

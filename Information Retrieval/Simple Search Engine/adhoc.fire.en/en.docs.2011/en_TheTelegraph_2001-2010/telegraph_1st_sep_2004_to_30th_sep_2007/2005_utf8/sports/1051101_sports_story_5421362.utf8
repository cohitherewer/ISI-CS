 Downfall of United empire

 - Sub-standard signings, Chelseas prosperity have added to Fergusons woes 

 OLIVER KAY

 The Glazers have not uttered even a word of support for Ferguson 

Take your pick from selling Jaap Stam, signing Juan Sebastian Veron, deciding that retirement was not such a good idea after all, picking a fight with the clubs biggest shareholders over a horse and in doing so opening the door for a takeover bid by an American family who have yet to offer any evidence that they have the financial means to put United back on top. 

A series of substandard signings has not helped, but the biggest factor has been the arrival of Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, which no one could have foreseen. Malcolm Glazer may be a rich man, but compared to the Chelsea owner, he is a financial pygmy. 

Will Ferguson have the money to put things right in the January transfer window? 

He will have some money, with the Glazers eager to win over the fans, but making big-money signings is not easy in January when few top players are available and judgement can be swayed by the ineligibility of certain targets for European competition. 

On recent evidence, Ferguson needs a holding midfield player to replace Roy Keane in addition to the more attack-minded Michael Ballack, whom he hopes to sign from Bayern Munich next summer, and at least one centre half, to judge from the fact that Rio Ferdinand and Mikael Silvestre are playing like clowns. 

What on earth has happened to Ferdinand? 

When Ferguson described him as the best centre half in the world a year ago, it seemed unmerited but, 12 months on, it sounds positively ludicrous. 

Ferdinand has been in a comfort zone ever since he joined United in 2002. There was a time when such behaviour at Old Trafford would have been addressed before it became a problem, but it took Sven-Goran Eriksson to give Ferdinand a kick up the backside. 

At United, he has been indulged from the moment he missed a drugs test two years ago and has rarely performed like someone trying to repay a debt of loyalty. He has a new ?100,000-a-week contract, though, so it is not all bad. Paul Scholes, a shadow of his old self, has also been rewarded for his poor form with a new four-year contract. 

What about the tactics and the infamous 4-5-1 formation? 

That formation, designed to preserve the ageing Keane, was in fact a carbon copy of the 4-3-3 formation used to such devastating effect by Jose Mourinho at Chelsea. 

At times, with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo in support for Ruud van Nistelrooy, it was very effective and, with the right men alongside Keane in midfield, it could be devastating. 

But, apart from the fact that Mourinhos side are more organised all over the pitch, Uniteds midfield cannot match Chelseas in terms of either goal threat or physical strength. 

This might be one reason why the system was dropped recently in favour of a 4-4-1-1 formation, with Rooney just behind Van Nistelrooy. The fans were happy with that, but results have got worse. 

Is Carlos Queiroz the problem? 

No, but considering that Ferguson has twice chosen to work without an assistant manager in recent seasons, the amount of influence wielded by Queiroz is extraordinary. 

Far from keeping a low profile, he has become even more prominent since, accusing the United supporters of stupidity, a comment that lost nothing in translation. According to Ryan Giggs, Ferguson has given Queiroz the responsibility to train us, prepare us for games, organise the team and decide the things we need to work on. 

So what, as someone asked recently, does Ferguson do, apart from fall out with the media? 

Is Fergusons job in danger? 

How could it not be when, under the terms of his 12-month rolling contract, his position is reviewed at the end of each season? 

David Gill, the chief executive, said in March that the manager is sackable and, while he was only stating the obvious under duress, it will be increasingly hard to justify Fergusons position if, at the end of the season, he is a 64-year-old who, with one Premiership title in five years, has been outwitted by Mourinho. 

The Glazers have not uttered a word in terms of publicly supporting him and, while that is in part owing to their reticence, their reverence for Ferguson might not be what it was. 

So who would replace him? 

The absence of an obvious successor might be the one thing in Fergusons favour at present. Ottmar Hitzfeld and Martin Neill may be keen to return to management next summer, while the grapevine suggests that Fabio Capello and Eriksson will be looking for new jobs, but there are few Mourinho types and, in any case, the United job is far bigger than most people would imagine. Bigger than ever, you could say.

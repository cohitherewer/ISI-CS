 There was double delight for Sania as her ranking went up to No. 77 following her Dubai Open exploits. 

 Madrid: German long jumper Bianca Kappler refused on Sunday to retake her sixth and final attempt from Saturdays European indoor womens final after officials conceded there had been a mistake in the measuring.

 Kappler was astounded on Saturday to find she had been credited with a winning jump of 6.96m. Her indoor best before the three-day championships had been 6.71. After consultations, European Athletics Association officials said Kapplers final jump had been measured wrongly and that she would have to take another jump on the final day of the three-day championships but the 27-year-old German refused.

 The operation that was performed in the Colombian city of Cartagena on Saturday has been successful, according to surgeon Carlos Chaux.

 ?We did not have to open Diego?s abdomen,? Chaux explained. ?His stomach was reduced by 95 per cent with the help of small incisions.? 

 London: Italian Pierluigi Collina will referee the Champions League first knockout round second-leg match between Chelsea and Barcelona on Tuesday, Uefa said on Sunday.

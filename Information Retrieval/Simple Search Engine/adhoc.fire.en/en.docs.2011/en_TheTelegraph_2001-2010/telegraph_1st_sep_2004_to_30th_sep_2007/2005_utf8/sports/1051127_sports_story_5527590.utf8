 Eusebio: Ive lost a great old friend

Lisbon: Portuguese great Eusebio has paid a glowing tribute to George Best, calling the former Manchester United superstar a genius. 

Eusebio witnessed first hand two of Bests most memorable performances for United, the 5-1 defeat of Benfica in the European Cup quarter final in 1966 and the 1968 final when Best scored a great solo goal as United beat the Portuguese club 4-1. 

For me today (Friday) is not good for me, my family, for everyone who knows George Best, who knows football. George Best was the best player in the world, not just England, and a good friend of mine, Eusebio told a TV chanell on Friday. 

The football world has lost a great, said the 63-year-old. Personally, Ive lost a great old friend. He was fabulous. 

I remember one day he played against Benfica in 1966 in Lisbon, we lost 5-1 and George Best was spectacular, a genius. 

I remember in the final in 1968 against Manchester United at Wembley. George Best for me continues to be my friend in my heart. I am very sorry. 

Antonio Simoes, the former coach of Benfica, said he was a magical player. 

He was a man who savoured life every day but wasnt capable of finding a balance, said Simoes.

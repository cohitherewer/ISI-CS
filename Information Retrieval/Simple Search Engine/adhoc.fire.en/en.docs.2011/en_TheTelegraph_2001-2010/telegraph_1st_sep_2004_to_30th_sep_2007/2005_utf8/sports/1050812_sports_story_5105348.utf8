Helsinki: Rens Blom of the Netherlands won the mens pole vault gold medal at the world championships on Thursday. Brad Walker of the United States took the silver and Pavel Gerasimov of Russia the bronze. 

American Allyson Felix upped the ante in her rivalry with Olympic champion Veronica Campbell as both eased into the womens 200 metres final on Thursday. Paired in the second semi-final, the 19-year-old Felix, second to Jamaican Campbell at the Athens Games last year, cruised down a soggy home straight to clock 22.90. 

Campbell took the third of four automatic final places from the heat. 

Meanwhile, Estonian Andrus Varnik won world javelin gold medal, on Wednesday to give his country the first world title. Varnik, thus, dashed Finland hopes as local hero Tero Pitkamaki failed to even make the podium. 

In contrast to the 1983 Helsinki championships, when Tiina Lillak won the womens title with her final throw, Pitkamaki could manage only fourth. It feels like the end of the world, fourth place does not cheer me up at all, Pitkamaki said. 

Varnik, the 2003 world silver medallist, took gold with his fourth round throw of 87.17 metres to give Estonia its first world title. 

Rain fell steadily throughout the afternoon after gale force winds in the morning had persuaded organisers to switch the womens pole vault final to Friday. 

I felt like I was being blown backwards, groaned four-time world high hurdles champion Allen Johnson. 

Johnson is likely to be disappointed with further cold, wet weather forecast for the 10th World Championships after a violent thunderstorm interrupted competition for 90 minutes on Tuesday. 

The mens 1,500 final, staged without defending champion Hicham El Guerrouj or Olympic silver medallist Bernard Lagat, was won by pre-race favourite Rashid Ramzi to give Bahrain its first world medal. Ramzi moved to Bahrain from Morocco in 2001 after failing to find work in his home country. 

American Bryan Clay was rewarded for a two-day slog through the wind and rain to win the decathlon ahead of Olympic champion Roman Sebrle of the Czech Republic. 

Clay, the silver medallist at last years Athens Games, scored 8,732 points in the 10-discipline event, setting personal bests in the shot put, 400 metres and javelin. 

Olympic gold medallist Tonique Williams-Darling won the first individual world track title for Bahamas by taking the womens 400 metres ahead of the American champion Sanya Richards. 

To be able to pull off the Olympic title and then pull off the world championship title, its an historic moment for me and the Bahamas, she said. 

American teenager Tianna Madison took the world womens long jump gold medal with a personal best of 6.89 metres. 

Frances defending champion Eunice Barber, who finished second in the heptathlon on Sunday, took the bronze medal. Indias Anju Bobby George finished fifth.

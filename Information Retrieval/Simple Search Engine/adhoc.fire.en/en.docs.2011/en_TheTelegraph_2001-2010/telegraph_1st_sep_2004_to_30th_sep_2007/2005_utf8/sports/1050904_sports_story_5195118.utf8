 Doubles players sue ATP

New York: A group of leading mens doubles players, including Mahesh Bhupathi, sued the ATP on Thursday in a bid to prevent the professional circuit from changing scoring rules and qualifying methods for doubles competitions at Tour events. 

The complaint, filed in US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, seeks an injunction to stop the ATP from implementing the changes and charges the organisation and its directors with anti-trust violations and breaches of fiduciary duties, according to a news release distributed at the US Open. 

The changes, including a streamlining of scoring in doubles intended to shorten the matches, are scheduled to be phased in later this season. 

Besides former world No. 1 Bhupathi, others to have filed the suit are American twins Bob and Mike Bryan, Bahamanian Mark Knowles and Canadian Daniel Nestor. (Reuters)

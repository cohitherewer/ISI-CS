 Rio De Janeiro: Former World Cup forward Romario apologised to Pele on Saturday for telling him to put a shoe in his mouth.

 ?I would like to take this chance to apologise to Pele for what I said,? he told reporters before taking part in a friendly match in Rio de Janeiro. ?I didn?t mean to say what I said. He?s still the King.?

 The controversy began earlier this week when Pele was reported as suggesting that Romario, who will be 39 at the end of this month, should retire now to avoid blighting a career which includes winning the 1994 World Cup.

 On Friday, Romario hit out at Pele. ?When Pele?s quiet, he?s a poet,? Romario told reporters. ?But he just talks shit. On the field, he was the greatest player in history, he was our king. But he should put a shoe in his mouth.?

 Earlier on Saturday, Pele tried to defuse the situation. ?I?m a Romario fan,? said Pele from Spain.

 ?I don?t know what they told him but it?s true that I was asked in an interview when the time to retire was and I said when you are at the top of your career,? he said. 

 ?Although I could have played on longer I left Cosmos, Santos and Brazil when I was a champion. Romario misunderstood what I said and got upset. I apologise if he took it the wrong way. He?s small and highly strung, but I?ve got nothing against him.?

 Tokyo: Feyenoord midfielder Shinji Ono left for Holland on Sunday, three weeks after ankle surgery here, but said he was still hoping to make a World Cup qualifier against North Korea next month.

 ?It is best if I make it,? he said, referring to the February 9 match in Saitama near Tokyo. ?But I will try to take my time in an effort to perform the way I want.?

 The 25-year-old underwent surgery on his left ankle at a hospital in Saitama, home to his former J-League club Urawa Reds, on December 27.

 He started running last Friday and was expected to resume kicking the ball on January 24.

 Cape Town: The vice-president of SA Rugby has accused his president of being a bully and ?in the pocket of Afrikaners?, according to a South African Sunday newspaper.

 Mike Stofile, the black African vice-president of the organisation, launched an attack on the coloured president Brian van Rooyen.

 ?He is more of a bully than (controversial former union president Louis) Luyt because he acts as an executive president. He wants to control everything,? Stofile told the Sunday Times. Stofile maintained that Van Rooyen ?was in the pocket of Afrikaners? because one of the president?s closest allies and deputy president is former Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff.

 A spokesman for Van Rooyen said the president did not want to be drawn into the debate.

 New Delhi: Over 500 cyclists from across the country would vie for honours in the Hercules national road cycling championships 2005 to be held in Pune from January Wednesday to Sunday.

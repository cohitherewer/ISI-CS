The Telegraph - Calcutta

 S.S. Das eyes return

A STAFF REPORTER

 S.S. Das 

Calcutta: Former India opener Shiv Sundar Das has his eyes firmly set on a return to national duty. But, he is taking things one at a time. And right now his immediate goal is to seal berth in the India A squad. 

?I had one bad series in the West Indies in 2001-02, but I was never short on confidence. The only thing which I can do is to improve my strokeplay,? Das said on Tuesday. 

?I am looking forward to the domestic scene to improve my repertoire and get back into the reckoning,? he admitted. 

According to Das, things didn?t go right for him in the last few years, but he certainly hopes to make a return to the Team India fold. 

The Orissa batsman, who has opened for India in 23 Tests, doesn?t want to be drawn into any sort of competition with other openers ? Gautam Gambhir or Akash Chopra. 

?I don?t see anyone as my competitor, they have played well and that?s why they are in the team,? he stated. 

But he is aware of the fact that he missed out on the opportunity which came his way when both he and Akash Chopra got the chance to play for Board President?s XI against the touring New Zealanders a couple of years back. ?Yes, had I scored in that match, it could have been a different story,? he admitted. 

Das, coming at No. 3 managed just 16, while Chopra, who opened with Virender Sehwag, went on to get an unbeaten 103, that proved decisive. 

The fact that his state is still playing in the Plate group of the Ranji Trophy doesn?t make him unduly perturbed. 

?It?s not a hindrance for me to reach the highest level from a state which is not in the Elite Group. If I perform well it will surely be counted,? he remarked. 

Meanwhile, former India medium-pacer and Orissa captain Debasish Mohanty doesn?t want to focus on his comeback to the national squad as he knows it is a difficult task. 

?I will have to keep on performing and the rest will hopefully follow,? he said. 

But he feels that India have good fast bowlers at present, with Zaheer Khan being the pick of the lot. 

?Zaheer is my best bet because of his aggression. Whenever he has the ball in his hands he makes the batsmen think about him,? Mohanty felt.

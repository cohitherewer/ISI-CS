 More changes likely in qualifying

Nuerburgring: Formula One bosses saw the fourth change in qualifying format in three years here on Saturday but they are already preparing to vote through further modifications within the next two months. 

The changes, which saw aggregate qualifying and the Sunday morning session scrapped and replaced by one single session on Saturday afternoon, proved a popular move with most of the teams and drivers. 

But the change, agreed at the last race in Monaco, has already been deemed a temporary solution and McLaren boss Ron Dennis believes teams must make a quick decision on the general outline of the next instalment. 

I do believe that qualifying will change for next year and I would say the teams need to know certain elements of qualifying within four to eight weeks, said Dennis. 

That is mainly because we need to start determining the designs of our cars for next season, specifically the size of our fuel tanks that is very often linked to qualifying. 

We dont need the whole definition of qualifying but we do need to define those elements that impact on fuel tanks. I think there will be dialogue, but whether it will fit in that timeframe we will have to see. 

The problem with the format has been a lack of agreement over the final solution as the ten team bosses all have different ideas about what is the best way to decide the grid. 

The current system sees cars qualify on the fuel they race with, which influences the size of the fuel tanks they choose, but also makes pole position only a part of the overall race strategy.

 Gagan Ajit slams Kanwalpreet

Jalandhar: Star Punjab Police player Gagan Ajit Singh Sunday condemned the conduct of teammate Kanwalpreet Singh who bashed up rival player Deepak Thakur during a league match of the Maharaja Ranjit Singh hockey tournament in New Delhi. 

?Although Deepak and Kanwalpreet are good friends, I don?t know what prompted Kanwalpreet to beat him,? Gagan Ajit said. 

?I strongly condemn the incident, which is a black spot on Indian hockey. It has earned a bad name for Punjab Police team,? he said. (PTI)

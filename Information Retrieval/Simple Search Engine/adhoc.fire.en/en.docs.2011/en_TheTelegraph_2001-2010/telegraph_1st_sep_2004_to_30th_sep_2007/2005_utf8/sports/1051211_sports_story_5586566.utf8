 National mark by Soudaminee

 Hyderabad: Soudaminee Gavankar of Maharashtra on 

 Saturday upset Olympian Anjali Bhagawat in the main event 

 to win the gold on the final day of 49th National Shooting 

 Championships at the Central University Shooting Range here.

 Gavankar created a national record in junior womens 

 10m rifle event individual championship by notching up 498.1.

 Maharashtra won the team event with 1685 points ahead of 

 Army (1681) and Navy (1663).

 Snigdha of Andhra Pradesh notched up 396, while Juthika 

 Bhonsle of Maharashtra earned bronze with 393 points.

 In the mens 25m standard pistol individual event, 

 Samresh Jung of CISF scored 572 to win the gold, while Ronak 

 Pandit of Maharashtra won the silver with 570 and Jaspal 

 Rana (ONGC) was relegated to bronze. 

 Ponomariov in semis

 Khanty-Mansiysk (Russia): Former world champion 

 Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine worked on the chequered board 

 like a man with a mission and defeated Evgeny Bareev of 

 Russia in a keenly contested game to move into the semi-finals 

 with a 1.5-0.5 victory.

 Ponomariov who had drawn the first game on Friday gave an 

 exemplary display to keep Bareev out of contention for the 

 top slots.

 Alexander Grishcuk remained the only Russian in with a 

 chance of clinching the title after he matched the skills 

 of Boris Gelfand of Israel to take the two games mini-match 

 to the tie-breaker. 

 Another Russian, Sergei Rublevsky, was ousted after he 

 lost to second seed Etienne Bacrot of France in the return 

 game of the quarter finals.

 Mahindra upset

 New Delhi: T. Akum Ao struck twice as the constables 

 of Assam Rifles caused a major upset by turning the applecart 

 of Federation Cup champions Mahindra United in the 118th 

 Durand Cup football tournament here on Saturday.

 The team, consisting mostly of youngsters from north-eastern 

 states, scored two goals in the first half to get the better 

 of their rivals, studded with the likes of Brazilian striker 

 Jose Ramirez Barreto.

 Mahindra United, who next play Mohammedan Sporting, were 

 thus ruled out of the reckoning for a semi-final place.

 In the other match of the day, Calcuttas Ever-Ready 

 and Tata Football Academy played out a dull 0-0 draw.

 Mahindra started on the offensive and it looked only a 

 matter of time before they opened scoring. But Barreto, 

 Yakubu and Gabriel Umeh proved wasteful in front of the 

 goal while Sinam L. Singh in the Assam Rifles goal produced 

 some fine saves.

 Akum scored against the run of play in the 31st minute 

 when his right-footer from outside the penalty box eluded 

 S. Roy Chowdhury before finding the top right-hand corner 

 of the net.

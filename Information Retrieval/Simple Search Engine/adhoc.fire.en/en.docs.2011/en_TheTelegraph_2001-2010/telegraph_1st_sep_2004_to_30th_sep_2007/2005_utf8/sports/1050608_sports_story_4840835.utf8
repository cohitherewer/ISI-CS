 Uefa backs Liverpool in vote 

London: Uefa president Lennart Johansson wants Liverpool to defend their Champions League trophy as European soccers ruling body prepares to vote on the issue. 

Johansson told BBC radio on Tuesday that Uefas executive committee will arrange a telephone conference in the next few days, with members voting on whether Liverpool will be allowed in next seasons competition after their win over AC Milan. 

Under current rules, Liverpools fifth-placed finish in the Premier League means they have qualified only for the much less prestigious Uefa Cup. 

Asked if he was in favour of Liverpool being allowed in the Champions League, Johansson said: Yes, I am...but I want people to know that they are free to have their own opinion when they are voting. 

I think a champion should have the chance to defend its title. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gibbs, Boje may be in India-bound party

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Sydney: Theres a possibility that Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje, who havent toured India after their names figured in the match-fixing scandal of 2000, will be included in the South African squad which is to play five ODIs next month. 

Were looking at that... After all, if they dont tour this time as well, then whats going to happen when India hosts the Champions Trophy next year? Surely, then, we will have to field our best, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

The South Africans have been seeking assurances that Gibbs and Boje wont either be questioned or arrested by the Delhi Police, which exposed the match-fixing soon after the 1999-2000 tour of India by South Africa. 

Both players skipped last years two-Test series. 

Meanwhile, South African coach Mickey Arthur has arrived here and could watch all six days of the Super Test. 

Its a preparatory trip... After all, were going to be in Australia (after the series in India) for three Tests and the tri-series... Just want to get a feel of things, he remarked. 

Significantly, if needed, Arthur can call upon the services of Gary Kirsten and/or Allan Donald to help lift his teams performance. Its a nice option to have.

 I dont know how high I can jump

 - Isinbayeva rewrites pole vault world record for 14th time

Lausanne: Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva lived up to a pre-meeting promise at Lausannes Super Grand Prix on Tuesday ? setting a world record for the 14th time in her career (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). 

The 23-year-old Olympic champion comfortably cleared 4.93 metres, adding a centimetre to the previous best mark which she herself set in Brussels last September. 

Its fantastic for me, Im so happy, Isinbayeva said. Its not easy, even if it looks easy. 

Despite that claim, the former gymnast says she has already cleared five metres in training though she intends to take her world record attempts one centimetre at a time. 

Her long-term aim is to surpass the haul of Ukrainian Sergey Bubka who set 35 world records during his career. 

I dont know how high I can jump, the Russian added. Maybe 5.10 or even 5.15. I just dont know my potential. 

Tuesdays performance earned Isinbayeva her seventh outdoor world record, with the other seven achieved at indoor meetings. 

While the world record dominated the night, there were plenty of other strong performances, as well as the odd upset. 

French sprinter Ronald Pognon provided perhaps the biggest shock by winning the mens 100 metres ahead of Ghanas Aziz Zakari and American Olympic champion Justin Gatlin. Posting a personal best of 9.99 seconds, Pognon finished 0.03 ahead of Zakari with Gatlin a further 0.01 away. 

My left leg felt a little tight and I didnt want to push it too much, said Gatlin, adding that he still intended to compete at Fridays Golden League meeting in Rome. 

Gatlins compatriot and fellow Olympic gold-medallist Jeremy Wariner was never in danger of suffering a similar upset as he cruised to victory in the 400 metres in 44.96. 

Bahamas sprinter Chandra Sturrup was also in commanding form as she stormed through the womens 100 metres to set a years best of 10.84. 

Americas Lauryn Williams finished second, 0.07 seconds behind, while last weeks Paris Golden League winner Christine Arron of France took third, a tenth of a second behind Sturrup. 

I got off to a flying start, but my run wasnt perfect, Sturrup insisted. I will be ready for (next months world championships) in Helsinki. 

Fellow-Bahaman Tonique Williams-Darling had less to smile about after finishing second in the womens 400 metres. The Olympic champion and 2004 Golden League jackpot winner lost out by 0.19 seconds to Americas Sanya Richards, who crossed the line in 49.95 

Chinese Olympic champion Liu Xiang was forced to share victory in the 110 metre hurdles after tying with Americas Terrence Trammell in 13.05 seconds. 

The much-anticipated face-off between Liu and American world champion Allen Johnson failed to materialise after a reported knee injury forced Johnson to pull out just before the start. (Reuters)

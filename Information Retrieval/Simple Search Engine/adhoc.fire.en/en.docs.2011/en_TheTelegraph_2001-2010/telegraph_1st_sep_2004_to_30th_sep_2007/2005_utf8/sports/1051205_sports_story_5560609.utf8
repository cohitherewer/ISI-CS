 Third Test in Ahmedabad

Mumbai: Ahmedabad will host the third and final Test between India and Sri Lanka from December 18 to 22. 

Mohali will now host the Test against England while the ODI against England in Mohali would shift to Jamshedpur, BCCI sources said after the meeting of the working committee concluded here on Sunday. 

Following the inability of Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) to conduct the third and final Test (between India and Sri Lanka) in Kanpur, the match had been allotted to the Gujarat Association and it will be held at the Motera in Ahmedabad, BCCI president Sharad Pawar said. 

The committee also ratified the decision of its programmes and fixtures committee taken on Saturday and confirmed that during the February 25-April 22 tour by England, Mumbai, Nagpur and Mohali would host the Test matches. The seven ODIs between the two countries will be held in Indore, Goa, Delhi, Guwahati, Kochi, Faridabad and Jamshedpur. 

The two three-day warm-up games prior to the Test series will be held at the CCI in Mumbai and Baroda. 

 The complete itinerary for the tour would be finalised in a day or two, Pawar said. (PTI)

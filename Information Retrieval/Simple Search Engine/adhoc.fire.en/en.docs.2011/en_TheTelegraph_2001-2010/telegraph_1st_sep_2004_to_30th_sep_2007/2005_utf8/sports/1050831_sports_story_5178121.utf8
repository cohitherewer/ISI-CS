New York: Defending champion Roger Federer hammered out a warning to his rivals for the US Open title, beating Czech Ivo Minar 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 on Tuesday to reach the second round at Flushing Meadow. The world No. 1 and top seed needed just over an hour to clinch victory. Minar, the world number 77, was given no chance to settle on his first US Open appearance. 

Federer rattled through the first two sets in 36 minutes. The Czech put up a little more resistance in the third set until the fourth game when he dropped his serve and the champion romped to victory. 

Britains Tim Henman slumped to a dismal first-round defeat, beaten 4-6, 2-6, 2-6 by Spains Fernando Verdasco. The 12th seed, a semi-finalist last year, looked sluggish and error-prone on Louis Armstrong Court and the loss means he is likely to tumble down the mens rankings. 

Henman has been suffering from a back problem and Verdasco, ranked 48, swept through the first two sets before the Briton lost his temper in the third set. 

The 30-year-old was furious that the umpire failed to over-rule a Verdasco forehand that looked long. He immediately lost serve to trail 2-1 and subsided meekly after that. 

A year after winning her maiden Grand Slam title at the US Open, Svetlana Kuznetsova suffered the humiliation of becoming the first defending womens champion to lose in the opening round on Monday. 

By contrast, fellow Russian Maria Sharapova and mens second seed Rafael Nadal started their campaigns in irresistible style. 

An out-of-sorts Kuznetsova stomped off court stony-faced after being thrashed 6-3, 6-2 by little-known compatriot Ekaterina Bychkova. 

Sharapova, the womens top seed, demolished Greeces Eleni Daniilidou 6-1, 6-1 with a pugnacious display of hitting on Arthur Ashe Court. Spanish teenager Nadal beat American wild card Bobby Reynolds 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. 

Argentine ninth seed Gaston Gaudio suffered a premature exit, losing 6-7, 2-6, 4-6 to US wild card Brian Baker but Andre Agassi and womens contenders Kim Clijsters and the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, recorded impressive first round victories. 

Fifth seed Kuznetsova has struggled to live up to her success last year, failing to win a single title in 2005 and the 20-year-old looked burned out on Louis Armstrong Court. 

Bychkova, also 20 but ranked only 97 and making her Grand Slam debut, dominated from the start while Kuznetsova ballooned errors from all angles. 

Of course Im disappointed, Kuznetsova said. But things like this happen. I just didnt play my game. I will learn from it. I just want to have some time off. 

Her defeat gave Russia a disappointing Grand Slam double in 2005. Anastasia Myskina also lost as defending champion in the first round of this years French Open. 

 Sharapova has never been beyond Round III at Flushing Meadows, but was clinical in her disposal of Daniilidou, who upset Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne in the Wimbledon first round in June. 

Reigning French Open champion Nadal, the 19-year-old Spaniard who has won nine titles this year and risen to No. 2 in the world, displayed flashes of his usual panache in beating American wild card Bobby Reynolds 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. 

The first match is never easy, the teenager said. I didnt play very, very well today, but the most important thing is to win the match. 

Gaudio, the 2004 French Open champion, offered little resistance after losing the first set tiebreak 9-11 to Baker, who took advantage to record his first victory at a Grand Slam event and only the fourth win of his career. 

Seventh seed Agassi, now 35 and embarking on his 20th US Open campaign, recorded a sprightly 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win in the final night session match in only 69 minutes against Romanias Razvan Sabau.

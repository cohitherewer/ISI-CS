The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No group is the odds-on favourite in 

 this blockbuster

 Guest Column

 The BCCI elections will soon take 

 centrestage. It will provide a welcome relief from the media 

 blizzard of the happenings in cricket and the fading fragrance 

 of Sania Mirza due to the Khusboo affair. The BCCI elections 

 have no equivalent worldwide. Political parties, cabinet 

 ministers, legal luminaries, industrialists and even the 

 Supreme Court are drawn into a fracas unbecoming their stature.

 Thank God that so far human rights 

 bodies and the UN have not been involved. The Supreme Court, 

 besieged with petitions, has been forced to nominate the 

 chief election commissioner, T.S. Krishnamurty, to observe 

 and oversee the elections. 

 Furthermore, there is talk of 

 total coverage of the meeting by video to settle disputes 

 that will inevitably crop up. If there were women and sex 

 involved, it could easily develop into a Hollywood blockbuster! 

 Interpretation of the rules and regulations in the articles 

 of association require the sharpest legal brains to unravel.

 Fifty or so years ago, I attended 

 a meeting of the then All India Lawn Tennis Association. 

 I was talked into attending the meeting by one of the states 

 and given a letter of nomination which I duly handed over. 

 Strutting into the meeting with lofty visions of unleashing 

 my rehearsed rhetoric on how to save the game, I got a rude 

 shock. In the first few minutes, it was ruled that my nomination 

 was invalid as an overriding nomination by the president 

 of the association had been received. As a benevolent gesture, 

 I was allowed to stay on in the meeting. I sat in a corner 

 like a pricked balloon.

 I travelled to the venue with 

 the group I was supposed to support, and saw with amazement 

 the intensity and high levels of campaig- ning. 

 Our group was led by a dynamic 

 leading industrialist, a real tycoon, who could handle just 

 about everything! 

 As one of the sheep in his flock, 

 I gathered that the result of the election hinged on one 

 single vote! If the Railways vote, which was in the opposite 

 camp, could be elimin-ated, our group would be a sure winner.

 We were at the airport ready to 

 board the flight when I saw a passenger screaming at an 

 airline official. It was the railway representative who 

 had been offloaded from the flight! 

 He was told that bad weather was 

 forecast and the pilot had decided to take more fuel on 

 board! We stepped out of the terminal and saw a clear blue 

 sky with not a single cloud. 

 The tycoon sat triumphantly in 

 his allocated VIP seat with his alert assistant next to 

 him, faithfully ready to carry out the next job.

 His next assignment, he was told, 

 was to proceed just after landing to the railway headquarters 

 and persuade the divisional superintendent to leave immediately 

 in his saloon on an inspection tour. I do not know what 

 happ- ened, but our group lost the elect- ion.

 Even the tycoon with all his influence, 

 experience and shrewd thinking was no match for the firmly 

 entrenched old khiladis ? a breed that 

 can mutate like stem cells. 

 I felt like a minnow and decided 

 to steer clear of association politics and took the easy 

 route of taking pot-shots from the out side.

 Though the media has made the 

 Pawar group hot favourite, I would hesitate to consider 

 them as odds-on favourite to win the election. Cloak-and-dagger, 

 googlies, chucking and doosras may embell- ish the 

 subterfuge of this mega event. 

 With the recent discovery of the 

 infidelity gene, office bearers in future may well be screened 

 through DNA tests before induc- tion into important positions 

 in office.

 I must clarify that the All India 

 Lawn Tennis Association, which is now called the All India 

 Tennis Association, is presently one of the best-run associations 

 in Indian sport. 

 The late Mr R.K. Khanna toiled 

 hard for many, many years and has built up a splendid organisation 

 which enjoys high respect in Asian and international circles.

Mohali: It was a night of the young guns as India A upstaged the star-studded India Senior to clinch a nail-biting one-wicket win in the opening match of the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy at the PCA Stadium on Monday. 

Faced with a challenging target of 290, the A team, led by VVS Laxman and comprising of the second best in Indian cricket, romped home with two balls to spare to pull off a memorable upset in the floodlit encounter. 

India A teams chase centred around no single big knock but a collection of valuable contributions including from their captain Laxman (48) and Hemang Badani (46). 

Laxman and Badani shared a 66-run stand for the fourth wicket from 86 balls but the team still needed the cameo knocks of Niraj Patel (37), Dinesh Karthik (26), Ramesh Powar (15) and VRV Singh (25 not out) to see them home. 

Needing 90 runs of the last 12 overs, A team kept chipping away through some hearty performances from the lower order. With nine runs required off the last six balls, the underdogs came through with Rudra Pratap Singh (11 not out) hitting two fours off Zaheer Khan. The Man of the Match though was Yalaka Venugopala Rao who narrowly missed out on a fine century after playing an enterprising innings that laid the foundation for the Seniors total. 

The hype surrounding Sachin Tendulkars return to competitive cricket turned out to be a damp squib with the maestros innings lasting only 15 balls while some of the other star performers also failed to deliver with bat and ball. Perhaps the strain of recent turn of events was showing but while the international stars struggled some of the sparkling moments of the day came from the aspiring youngsters. 

The 23-year-old Rao hit a 99-ball 98 that helped the senior overcome a sluggish start and the cheap dismissal of Sachin who was returning after a five-month injury lay-off in the floodlit match. Rao shared a 105-run stand for the seventh wicket with Ajit Agarkar who produced a cameo half-century of his own to provide the senior the final kick towards their closing stages. Agarkars 54 came from 42 balls and contained three fours and a six. 

Raos knock overshadowed a fine 50 by local hero Yuvraj Singh who was instrumental in guiding the recovery after the senior had slumped to 70 for three at one stage. Yuvraj added 79 runs for the fourth wicket with Rao as he laid the foundation for a big total before succumbing to his attacking instincts. 

Rudra Pratap Singh was economical for India A while India seamer Lakshmipathy Balaji was the most expensive with two for 76. 

The A team was off to a great start with Gautam Gambhir and Dheeraj Jadhav taking the senior new ball bowlers Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan head on.

 We can surprise anybody: Bashar 

 Fans celebrate in Dhaka after Bangladesh upset world champions Australia 

London: Spontaneous street parties erupted throughout Bangladesh after Habibul Bashar and his men produced one of the most astonishing upsets in the history of the game on Saturday. 

Bangladesh, whose place in international cricket has been increasingly questioned after their dismal record in both the Test and one-day arena, defeated world champions Australia by five wickets in Cardiff during a triangular series with England. 

Hundreds of residents poured out of their homes in Dhaka, banging pots and pans, and students at the capital?s university staged a victory parade in the campus. 

?We have been struggling,? captain Bashar told BBC radio on Sunday. ?But one thing we knew was if we could put together a score and keep batting and not give up we might start beating people. 

?We didn?t think we could win the match, but after winning it we know that if we can work hard we can surprise anybody.? 

Earlier in the post-match press meet, Bashar said: ?I am the happiest man in the world today. This win can take us a long way.? 

Bangladesh?s spirited run chase after Australia had posted a moderate 249 for five resulted in a win to rank with any since one-day International cricket started in the 1970s. 

Saturday?s victory was just their 10th in 108 one-day Internationals and only their third against a major Test nation following the victory over Pakistan and one over India last year. 

The hero for Bangladesh was Mohammed Ashraful, who struck an even century from exactly 100 balls after exiting first ball in the opening match against England. ?To score a century against Australia was a dream but I was bitterly disappointed to get out, he said.? 

?The effects of this will reach far and wide, among 140 million people,? said Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore in a reference to the population of Bangladesh. 

Whatever happens in the remainder of the series, Bangladesh can return home with their heads held high. ?This is such a huge moment,? said their first Test captain Animul Islam. ?This was not a fluke. Australia were full strength. We just played better on the day. 

Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia was quick to congratulate the players, saying she believed they would keep the winning spree going. 

?It?s my worst loss as captain,? a bemused Ricky Ponting said. ?It?s probably one of the biggest upsets in the history of the game. 

?I wouldn?t call it complacency. I don?t think anyone was not prepared. We have to work out what happened, it?s a bad start to the series but it?s not that bad yet.

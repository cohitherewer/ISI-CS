Auckland: Australia beat New Zealand by 44 runs in their historic Twenty20 international at Eden Park here on Thursday. 

Ricky Ponting finished stranded on 98 not out off 55 balls after helping Australia recover from 54 for four to pile on 214 for five from their 20 overs. 

New Zealand were bowled out for 170 on the last ball of the match despite 66 from Scott Styris and 36 from Brendon McCullum. Australian paceman Michael Kasprowicz captured four for 29. 

Thursday?s match was the world?s first 20-over international amid speculation that the abbreviated form of the game, which enjoys strong public support in England, could become a regular part of the international calendar. 

The Australians, who also won the first Test and 50-overs Internationals, made a flying start, smashing 46 runs off the first four overs, but were forced to settle down after losing Michael Clarke (7), Adam Gilchrist (1) and Andrew Symonds (32) early. 

Man of the Match Ponting reached his half-century off 35 balls when he whacked former New Zealand rugby player Jeff Wilson for six and finished with eight fours and five sixes off only 55 balls. 

The skipper was at the non-strikers? end with two balls to go and might have reached his hundred had Hussey taken a single off the penultimate ball instead of belting it for six. 

New Zealand made a strong start to their reply with McCullum and captain Stephen Fleming cracking 49 off the first five overs when things suddenly went wrong. 

Kasprowicz bowled Fleming for 18 and then had Matthew Sinclair caught for a golden duck. He missed his hattrick but claimed the wickets of McCullum and Cairns to finish with four for the match. 

Styris briefly threatened to lead a New Zealand revival, striking five boundaries and three sixes off 39 balls before Brett Lee bowled him in the penultimate over.

 WICB chief mulls yearly contracts

Port-of-Spain: The West Indies must offer yearlong contracts to top players to foster the commitment and motivation needed to pull the team from the pits, the new West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) president has said. 

Ken Gordon said the board had sought advice from cricket experts in Australia and Britain, all of whom recommended yearlong contracts, saying the move had helped their own countries build committed teams. 

We feel that is the only way for us to go, said Gordon, who was elected WICB president on Sunday. 

In his first major action as president, Gordon established a committee that will work to revive West Indian cricket and secure a third World Cup victory for them in the World Cup, in March 2007. 

He has asked former captain Clive Lloyd to head the committee. Lloyd was considering the offer, Gordon said. 

According to Gordon, the top 10 West Indies players should receive yearlong contracts. The current practice for the West Indies players is to sign fresh contracts before every tour. (AP)

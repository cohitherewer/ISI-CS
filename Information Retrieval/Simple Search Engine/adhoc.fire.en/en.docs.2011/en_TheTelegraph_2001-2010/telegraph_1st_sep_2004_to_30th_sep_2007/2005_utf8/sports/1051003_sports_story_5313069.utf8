Karachi: The Indian womens cricket team wrapped up their week-long tour of Lahore by winning the fourth one-dayer by 99 runs to sweep the series 4-0. 

The Indians maintained their fine form with the bat and the ball to once again outclass their inexperienced and controversially selected opponents. 

Electing to bat, Indians made 215 for four in 40 overs that included fine half centuries from Thirush Kamini and skipper Karuna Jain. 

Kamini scored 63 that came off 96 balls and included 11 boundaries, while Karunas innings was spiced up by four boundaries. 

The target proved to be too much for the Pakistani girls who were bundled out for 116 for nine. Taskeen Qadeer scored 26. 

For India, Diana David snapped up three for 38 and Sradanphi Naidu picked up three for 16. 

Kamini was adjudged Player of the Match, while Karuna was named Player of the Series. 

This was the first-ever tour by an Indian womens side to Pakistan.

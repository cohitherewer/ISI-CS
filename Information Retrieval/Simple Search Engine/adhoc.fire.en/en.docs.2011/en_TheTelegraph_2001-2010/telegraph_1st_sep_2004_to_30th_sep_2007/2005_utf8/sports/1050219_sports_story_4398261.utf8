Calcutta: A match under lights is a rarity in Indian soccer. Despite the amount of sponsors? money at All India Football Federation?s disposal, it has rarely gone ahead and held a match in the evening. 

However, Friday?s National Football League (for the ONGC Cup) encounter between East Bengal and Mahindra United at the Salt Lake Stadium showed that given the right ambience, football in India too can reach greater heights. 

The match result, a 1-1 draw shouldn?t be a pleasing one for home fans, and especially after Douglas da Silva broke his right shin bone after going for a needless header in the 85th minute. He will be operated upon on Saturday. It is learnt that he will be out for four to six months. 

But, the thousands present at the stadium witnessed an entertaining brand of soccer which also pointed to a vulnerability in red-golds defence. 

Mahindra United should have taken the lead with their Brazilian imports Rodrigo Almeida and Flavio Rodrigues combined well to open up the backline for the latter in the eighth minute. Flavio?s rising shot rebounded off the crosspiece and from the ensuing move East Bengal took the lead. Man of the Match Alvito D?Cunha?s corner, his fourth during that period, took a deflection off Covan Lawrence?s head to bury into the net. 

Despite the own goal, the visitors showed remarkable spirit to storm the opposition citadel. S. Venkatesh, Kalia Kulothungan and Jatin Bisht led a flurry of attacks. With Flavio being in irresistible form, cracks began to appear in the red-golds defence. Playing short passes and rapid interchanging of positions created a host of problems for Douglas and Co. 

The home side, on the other hand, was not to be outdone. Playing on the counter, they could have increased the tally had Bijen Singh been on target from inside the box. 

But, it was the Mumbai outfit who cancelled out the early lead when Jatin and Rodrigo combined to set up Kulothungan in the open inside the box. Instead of going for the goal, he squared across the face of the goal for Venkatesh at the back post, who didn?t make a mistake. 

The teams carried on the tempo after the breather and between 66th and 69th, any one could have scored. Kulothungan blasted a shot over the bar in front of an open goal, while Alvito and Bhaichung Bhutia?s minus went unattended across the goalmouth. 

By this time, the Mumbai side had a fair measure of their opponent and Flavio started blossoming. Not even Madhab Das?s inclusion as marker could stop the Brazilian from showing his skill. His quick turns and off the ball movements and rapid acceleration reminded one of Jose Ramirez Barreto. 

However, just as it looked that Mahindra could go in front, coach Syed Nayeemuddin made the mistake of replacing Flavios? partner Rodrigo with Abhisekh Yadav. The lanky striker, like East Bengal?s Earnest Jeremiah, is a liability, and Mahindra lost the thrust upfront. 

Still, the red-golds had a chance of earning three points. But Bhaichung?s tap-in from a Jeremiah minus went over the bar in the 81st minute. 

Despite the draw, East Bengal remain on top with 21 points from nine matches, while Mahindra have 13 from eight.

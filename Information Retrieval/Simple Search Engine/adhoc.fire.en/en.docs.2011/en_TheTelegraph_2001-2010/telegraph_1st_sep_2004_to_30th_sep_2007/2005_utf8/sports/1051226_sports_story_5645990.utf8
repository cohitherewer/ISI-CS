 India, Vietnam share lead 

 - ASIAN TEAM CHESS 

 - Surya Sekhar held by Sharbaf Mohsen 

 Surya Sekhar 

Isfahan (Iran): India emerged as joint leaders along with Vietnam after another 3.5-0.5 triumph over Afghanistan in the sixth round of Asian Team Chess championship here on Sunday. 

Both India and Vietnam have 28 points apiece, while Iran A is on the third spot with 16 points. The fourth place is held by Turkmenistan on 9.5 points, Iran B is fifth on 8 points while Afghanistan has just 2 points. 

The Indian men may have clawed their way back to the lead position in this double round robin contest between six teams but certainly lost the initiative after dropping another half point against Afghanistan. 

In the previous encounter against Afghanistan too, the Indian men had dropped half a point and now they will have to bank on the encounter against Vietnam in the next round to retain chances of winning their maiden Asian team title. While the rest of the Indians coasted to victories against Iran B, national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly was held to a draw by Sharbaf Mohsen. 

It was, in fact, one of the most exciting games of this round with Ganguly first winning a pawn and then a sacrificed piece in the Sicilian Sveshnikov by Mohsen. Later amidst wild complexities, Mohsen won white queen for two rooks to force a draw. 

For Vietnam, the Services teenager Le Quang Liem is working wonders. So far Liem has scored 5.5 points out of a possible six and has a whopping rating performance of 2622 elo points. 

In the sixth round as well, Liem came good against Amanov Mesgen of Turkmenistan while in the fifth round, he had provided the vital full point against Iran A accounting for Darban Morteza on the fourth board. 

Earlier in the fifth round, the Indian men had scored a 3.5-0.5 victory over Iran B. 

The Vietnamese, in fact, did their part better by scoring a smashing 4-0 victory over Turkmenistan in the sixth round game after earlier scoring a needful 2.5-1.5 victory over Iran A in their previous outing. 

The fact that Vietnam is yet to play Afghanistan and India, who are yet to tackle Turkmenistan, effectively renders Vietnam a slightly better contender for the title with just four rounds to go. 

The womens event had a rest day, as there are only six rounds in all among four teams this time. The Indian eves are currently leading this section with 5 points to their credit after three rounds while Vietnam and Iran B are on their toes with 4.5 points apiece. Iran A are fourth with 4 points to back them. In the next round, the Indian eves will play against Vietnam. 

In the first encounter against Afghanistan, International Master S Kidambi had dropped half a point against Farazi Khaiber and he was dropped in the return game of round six. 

However, this time grandmaster Abhijit Kunte, who is clearly struggling with his form here, was in the firing line against Fidaeyee Habibullah who took the half point after salvaging a draw from a nearly lost position. 

Kunte has so far played five games here and has scored 2.5 points for a rating performance of 2220 elo points, way below his current 2553 rating.

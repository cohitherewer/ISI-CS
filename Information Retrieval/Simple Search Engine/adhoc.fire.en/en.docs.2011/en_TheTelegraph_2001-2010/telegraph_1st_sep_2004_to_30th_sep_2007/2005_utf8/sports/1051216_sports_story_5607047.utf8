 Paes to don double role

 - CHENNAI OPEN 

New Delhi: Ace tennis player Leander Paes on Thursday confirmed his participation in the doubles event of the $400,000 Chennai Open to be held in the southern metropolis from January 2 to 8. 

Paes, who has been a regular at the tournament since its inception, will also be seen in the role of the commentator for the matches after he comfortably took the responsibility in the recently concluded Shanghai Masters Cup. 

Paes will partner Czech Republics Martin Damm in the event which is South Asias only ATP International series, to be played at the Nungambakkam Tennis Stadium in Chennai. 

We are thrilled to announce that Leander Paes has confirmed his participation for the Chennai Open 2006 doubles draw, Ravi Krishnan, managing director, South Asia, IMG/TWI said in a release. 

Top-notch players including French Open champion Rafael Nadal, defending champion Carlos Moya, Asias top ranking player Paradorn Srichaphan and Radek Stepanek of Czech Republic.Paes, who had a consistent season with three ATP titles and quarter final appearances in the French Open and Wimbledon, said it was always exciting to play in Chennai, but opted out of the singles so that youngsters could get a chance to face some of the best opponents at home. 

Im really pleased to be back in Chennai. I have always played here. This is not only Indias biggest tennis tournament but also the most prestigious annual sporting event, Paes said. 

I love coming back here because I think the event requires unconditional support from all Indian tennis players, he said. 

I have decided not to play in the singles draw in order to provide promising youngsters a chance to compete with some of the best players in the world, the Indian Davis Cup captain said. 

The Calcutta-based player had partnered Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia last year to reach the semi-finals where the duo lost a three-setter to Rainer Schuettlr and Yen-Hsun Le. 

Paes partner Damm also had a consistent last year. The Czech, who had career-high ranking of eight in the doubles in 2002, has played in the event in 2000 when he reached singles semi-final and doubles quarter final.

 Jeev Milkha now tied 39th

Tokyo: Putting woes continued to trouble Jeev Milkha Singh as he shot a one-under 71 with the aid of two birdies on the front nine to stay at tied 39th with a total of four-under 212 in the ?100 million Asahiryokuken Yomiuri Memorial golf meet at the Asoiizuka Golf Club on Saturday. 

The lead was shared by three players, Shingo Katayama, Satoru Hiroto and Nozomi Kawahara, all at 14-under 202. Katayama had a round of 68, while Hiroto and Kawahara shot 67 each. 

I have been hitting the ball fine and reaching the greens in regulation. But once there my putter is just not working, said Jeev at the end of the round. 

Once again he had over 61 per cent greens in regulation but took 28 putts. 

That was a little better than the 34 I had on second day, which was frustrating, Jeev, who began the week with a seventh place in first round, said. 

Jeev started on the tenth tee and had bogeys on the 14th and 15th and recovered with a birdie on 18th. 

He played more steadily on the second nine with birdies on first and sixth and pars on all others for a round of 71, which gave him a total of four-under 212. 

Liang Wenchong, Dinesh Chand and A. Yano share the fourth spot, one shot behind the leaders at 203.

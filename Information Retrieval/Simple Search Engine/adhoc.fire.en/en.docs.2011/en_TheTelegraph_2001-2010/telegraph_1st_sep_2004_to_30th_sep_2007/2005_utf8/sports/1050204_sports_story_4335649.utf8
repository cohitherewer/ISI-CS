The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Inzamam will keep captaincy for India

 - Shoaib Akhtar set to be show-caused 

 Pakistan prefer Chennai to Ahmedabad 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

Calcutta: Despite reports suggesting Inzamam-ul Haq is set to be replaced as Pakistan?s captain, he will remain at the helm on the forthcoming tour of India. 

In fact, according to The Telegraph?s sources, there?s every likelihood of his being retained till the June-July tour of the West Indies. 

?Informally, it has already been decided not to effect such a big change in the lead-up to a huge tour. Moreover, that Pakistan have made the tri-series finals (in Australia) has given Inzy a boost,? remarked a well-placed source in Lahore. 

Apparently, the move to ?not disturb? Inzamam was taken even before Pakistan made the best-of-three finals ? in all probability during Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan?s book release last week. 

There was, it seems, a ?lengthy discussion? between Shaharyar, chief selector Wasim Bari and former captain (and chief executive) Rameez Raja at that function in Lahore. 

That Inzamam ought to be retained was probably suggested by Rameez. Whatever, an announcement is a mere formality. 

Nobody sees Inzamam as highly inspirational, but the timing-factor is definitely to his advantage. 

Yousuf Youhana, though, could lose the vice-captaincy. Top contenders, at this moment, are Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik. 

Meanwhile, temperamental speedster Shoaib Akhtar is set to be show-caused for breaching his contract. The showcause, one learns, is going to be served within a couple of days. 

Shoaib has violated two clauses: Visiting a nightclub while on tour (in Sydney) and speaking to the Media (well, just about everywhere) without the team management?s permission. 

Approval is required for any interaction with the Fourth Estate up to six months from the end of a tour. 

Shoaib, of course, returned home ? to recover from yet another injury ? within days of the tri-series getting underway. 

According to another Lahore-based source, it?s likely that, eventually, Shoaib will be picked only for the three Tests and not the five ODIs as well. 

He is, to say the least, under much pressure. 

Footnote: The PCB?s reservations over Ahmedabad being a Test venue remain. Apparently, a formal request is going to be made for a shift to Chennai.

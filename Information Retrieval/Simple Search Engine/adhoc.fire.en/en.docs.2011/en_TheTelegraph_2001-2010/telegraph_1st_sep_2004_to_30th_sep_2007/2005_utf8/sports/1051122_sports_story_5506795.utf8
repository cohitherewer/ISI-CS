 Daniel, Aman reap harvest 

 STAR RACER

 Trainer Daniel Davids treble, including the Cup-double with the help of apprentice Amandeep Singh, and fellow schooler Robin Corners first winner were the two positives in last Thursdays races, which were held on the winter track for the first time this season.

 Disappointments were many but jockey C. Alfords handling of the two favourites in the trophy events topped the list on a day, which also saw a number of strongly fancied runners biting the dust. Thanks To All and Russian Valour were the only saviours in the seven-event card.

 Corner was all delight following the flawless victory of his trainee Acrostic in the 1,400m Ave-roff Handicap. The jockey-turned-stipendiary steward, now in his new role, failed to hide his emotions at the lead-in custom. He had reasons to do so because the well-backed 3-1 chance Acrostic gave a handsome thrashing to the last outing runaway winner Aguilas and the Bangalore-challenger Sven.

 Alford, who made it all happen, had the topweighted three-year-old in third behind Royal Contender and Sven till the top of the final turn, before kicking clear of the opposition.

 Thanks To All never disappointed whenever right money came on the five-year-old. His victory in the Flash Toy Handicap, despite his weight constraints, was a smashing one. Mark Reuben held back the 8-10 favourite in the mid-bunch till 250m from home before releasing brakes on the Javed Khan-trainee.

 Daniel had to wait until the fourth race before his juggernaut rolled on. In the opener, the 2,000m Adelina Handicap, his King Is Born had let down a big following with apprentice Amandeep Singh faltering on the pace-issue. The King was also disturbed by the joint-favourite Annotate upfront, and as a result, the tiring duo set the stage for Rheinhearts victory ? his third in-a-row.

 The start of Daniels treble was not an easy thing either as Russian Valour found a perfect match in the western India migrant Aag, who went stride for stride with the even-money favourite in the last furlong of the 1,200m Gabarnac Handicap.

 Russian Valour got the camera-verdict in his favour and also paved way for stables treble. But it may not be out of turn to mention that Alford contributed amply to the Daniel-Amandeep-cause in the following events ? the BOL Publication Cup and the RWITC Cup. Alford failed to take a level jump out on each occasion giving opportunity to Wayward King and Noble Flash to cash in on.

 Bharath, the master craftsman, pulled off another sizzler in a quietly-fancied Azinger to claim the 1,100m Pentire Handicap. The horse was systematically brought down on the weight-scales, and though the slated trip was too sharp to the liking, his superior class told in the race. He destroyed the opposition with an eight-length win to suggest he could surprise again.

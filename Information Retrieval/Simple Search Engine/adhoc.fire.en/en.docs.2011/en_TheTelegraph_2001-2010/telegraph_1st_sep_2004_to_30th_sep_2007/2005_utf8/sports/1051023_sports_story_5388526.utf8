 Security team to arrive in Pakistan today

Karachi: Two security experts from England will arrive in Pakistan on Sunday to review safety arrangements for next months Test and one-day series between the two teams, a Pakistan Cricket Board official said. 

England are due to arrive on Wednesday to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals. 

These experts will visit all the match venues, team hotels and hold meetings with interior ministry officials to review arrangements for the tour, said the board official. 

England are not playing any match in the North West Frontier Province, which borders Afghanistan, and have also refused to play a Test match in the volatile southern city of Karachi because of security concerns. 

The tour is going ahead despite the October 8 earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people in Pakistans northern mountains. The earthquake did not cause any damage in the cities where England will play.

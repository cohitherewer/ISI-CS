 Betting coups aplenty 

 STAR RACER

 Betting coups were aplenty in last Wednesday?s seven-event race card and each one clicked. The biggest of all was perhaps on Majestic Hills, in the concluding event, the Mother?s Boy Handicap.

 The T.N. Jaiswal-trained horse was backed from 3?s down to 5-4 after a mad rush targeted the horse in the betting ring.

 The eight-year-old, despite his all drawbacks ? age, weight and long lay-off ? treated the opposition with scant respect in the hands of apprentice Vinay Jaiswal. Majestic Hills led from the start and won drawing away from the field.

 Story was no different in the Bookmakers? Association Cup, which saw another solidly fancied Pacific Jewel delivering the goods.

 The Daniel David-filly was, however, held back in third by apprentice Gajender Singh, till the distance-post before brakes were released on her to win the way she liked.

 Secret Desire won a made-to-order race as none of her four rivals looked to be keen on winning the Jujube Handicap.

 But Serrafina, an easy winner of the1,200m Navy Cup, had form by her side. She was brought back to the sprint after her humiliating fourth over a mile. The Vijay Singh-trainee may strike again before the season ends in another three weeks.

 Vijay?s another ward, Awesome Star, an even-money favourite in the 1,100m Apar Shakti Plate, is another one who come good but just about.

 It was a lucky win for the three-year-old against the joint-favourite, Pay Check, whose jockey was learnt to have dropped his whip when the heat was on.

 Sergeant Slipper?s back-to-back victory in the day?s feature, the Goodfellas Cup, was hard earned, despite the fact that Ever Lasting Love took a circuitous route and yet tried to fight back.

 A well-backed Still In Love, on the other hand, cashed in on her paddock looks, winning the 1,200m Bold Gesture Plate from the start. Incidentally, it was the debut run of the Farley Rodrigues-trained filly.

 Earlier on March 12, despite efforts starting from pumping of heart to administrating oxygen, had failed to save last winter?s Nanoli Stud Million winner, Calorific, following a massive attack.

 Calorific had taken a little more than three minutes to win the 2,800-metre Calcutta St Leger trip, and build up a reputation as a thorough stayer. But trainer Vijay Singh-ward hardly survived for another three minutes after the next attack, which proved to be a fatal one.

 The Leger-pace in a two-horse race was never a genuine one ? it was neither very hot and nor subtly gentle one as Calorific established a three-length lead over his stablemate, Anzello, a 30-100 hot favourite.

 The lead increased with every passing post but the pace improved to necessity only after the leader crossed the halfway mark.

 Thereafter, she never allowed the favourite to recover from early manoeuvrings. S. Shanker partnered the winner.

 Sanskara, too, was hardly pressed for her easy win in the Acorn Stakes. However, she was seen shifting out of a straight course on a rain-soaked track, thanks to intermittent overnight rain, which also spread into Saturday morning. C. Rajendra partnered the filly to victory.

 The 2,000m Indian Air Force Cup was a mere formality for another of Vijay?s ward, Bountiful Pleasure. Kept a handy third behind El Cid and Say It Loud till the top of the home stretch, the Razeen-Treasure?s Nest colt went about his task from that point onwards.

 The afternoon, otherwise, belonged to trainer-jockey combination of Sanjeev Charan and D. Singh, who notched up a priced double through Magic Mantra and Frontier Flame in their respective events.

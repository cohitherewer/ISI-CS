 Mob damages Youhanas car 

Karachi: Pakistan middle-order batsman Yousuf Youhanas Mercedes Benz was attacked and severely damaged by a mob of youngsters in a posh locality of Lahore on Thursday evening. 

Youhana was unhurt in the incident but the windows of his recently imported vehicle were shattered while the body of the car was also damaged. 

No immediate reason was known for the violent act but police sources said the arrested youngsters, who were later released, belonged to respectable and well-off families. 

The reason for the attack has not been disclosed because the complainant agreed for a compromise, a police source said. 

The identified youngsters were arrested but later released because no official complain was lodged, they added. 

Youhana was also diplomatic and didnt clearly spell out the reasons for this crazy act. 

There was some misunderstanding. But all is well, he said. 

The incident, in which Youhanas car ? estimated to be worth around Pakistani Rs five million ? almost became crippled, has led to a series of conspiracy theories, including an attack by the underworld. 

Youhana, 31, returned from the West Indies after the one-day series because of his fathers illness who has been diagnosed with stone in his kidneys. 

He is also expected to undergo surgery on a chronic problem in his right shoulder.

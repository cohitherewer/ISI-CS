 Tennis aces to do their bit

 - ATP Players? Council will discuss tsunami aid in next weekend?s meeting 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Whoever he got the chance to talk to, has agreed to donate, says Jonas Bjorkman 

Chennai: Twelve days after nature?s fury devastated south Asia, the killer tsunami continues to monopolise headlines the world over. 

Even as the affected countries keep counting their dead, the focus is now on relief and rehabilitation of those who survived Black Sunday?s disaster but have been left homeless, bruised or orphaned. 

Like the rest of the global community, the sporting world too is pitching in for the millions crying out for food, shelter and medicines. 

Starting from Michael Schumacher to the NBA and our cricket icons, everyone?s doing their best to raise the massive amount of funds required to restructure lives. 

Tennis and its entire cast have not failed to pledge their support. 

But five days into the first week of the ATP calendar, the general feeling is that the response has been a trifle muted. 

Every player at the Chennai Open expressed his willingness to support the cause of tsunami victims ? and a handful of them have kept their word too ? but a lack of co-ordination has hurt the funds mobilisation process. The other problem is, some players are not at all sure which trust to put their money into. 

Tour veteran Jonas Bjorkman, who along with his partner Mahesh Bhupathi were the first to announce that they would donate their Chennai prize-money, had planned to appeal to all the players here to do likewise. 

But, as the 32-year-old Swede explained, he didn?t get a chance to get all players together. 

?Whoever I got the chance to talk to, agreed to donate but due to the different practice and playing schedules, I couldn?t arrange a meeting among all the players,? Bjorkman said. 

The players will get the chance to set that right before the year?s first Grand Slam, the Australian Open, gets underway on January 17. The ATP Players? Council will meet next weekend in Melbourne, where ways and means to help the tsunami victims will be discussed. 

German Rainer Schuettler, the third seed who was knocked out in the first round by Olivier Patience here, is the president of the players? council. 

?It?s important for the players to put their heads together and come up with some concrete ideas?the meeting in Melbourne should serve that purpose,? said American Justin Gimelstob who donated $2,000 after initially saying he hadn?t thought how to help? 

A Grand Slam brings together the top 250-300players in the world and is the best place to take a collective decision. 

There is even talk of the ATP doing something jointly with the WTA Tour. 

Of course, there are those who prefer doing their bit their own way. For example Leander Paes, apart from contributing his prize-money, is also helping the hundreds of children affected by the tragedy. 

?What we are trying to do is no big shakes? it?s our basic duty to help these people. ?It?s these people who backed us and made us who we are today, now we have to support them,? Paes said. 

That?s precisely the sentiment society expects every public figure to share.

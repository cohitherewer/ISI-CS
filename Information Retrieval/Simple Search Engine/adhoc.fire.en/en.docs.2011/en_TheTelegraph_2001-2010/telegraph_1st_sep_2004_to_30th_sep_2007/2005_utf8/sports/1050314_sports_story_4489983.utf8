 Ernie Els masters Qatar too

Doha: World number three Ernie Els fired a seven-under 65 to storm to a one-shot win over Sweden?s Henrik Stenson at the Qatar Masters on Sunday. 

It gave the South African, who carded eight birdies and one bogey, a 12-under aggregate 276 and a second victory in seven days after his third Dubai Desert Classic success last week. 

?I wanted to give myself a low score and as it turned out, I shot low which you don?t normally do. I got lucky and got a win,? Els told reporters. 

Els, who languished in joint 81st place after an opening 73, began his final round five shots down on overnight leader Stenson. 

The former world number one started with a flourish, almost chipping in for an eagle at the first. After dropping a shot on the short third Els went on a birdie spree for a front-nine 33 before adding four more birdies on his return. 

?I really feel good. My rhythm is really good at the moment and I?m in a good position at the top of the backswing. When that happens, I can freewheel it and go for the ball,? added Els. 

?My iron play was a lot better. I feel like my game is right there and I cant wait to get to America.? 

Els next plays at the Bay Hill Invitational in Orlando, Florida nest week. 

Swede Stenson began well with two birdies in the opening three holes, but two bogeys and then a double-bogey at the 14th dropped him down the leaderboard before he rallied with three birdies to finish second on 11-under. 

Australian Richard Green and Swedens Pierre Fulke tied for third on nine-under-par.

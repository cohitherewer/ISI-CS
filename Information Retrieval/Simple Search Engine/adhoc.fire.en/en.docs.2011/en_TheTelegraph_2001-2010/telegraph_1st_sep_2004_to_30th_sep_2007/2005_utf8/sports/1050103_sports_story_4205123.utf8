The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Contest is still open: Sourav 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sourav?s disappointment is gone 

Calcutta: The disappointment doesn?t show now on Sourav Ganguly?s face. The disappointment that was visible Saturday late afternoon. His classy 121 at the Eden against Madhya Pradesh on the penultimate day of the crucial Ranji Trophy Elite Group match Sunday ensured that. 

?I was pretty disappointed yesterday as we lost too many wickets and didn?t play well at all, but today our (with Devang Gandhi) 167-run partnership has thrown the contest open,? Sourav said. 

He admitted, though, that the hosts would have been in a much better position had he remained in the middle till the stumps were drawn. ?It would have been better had Bengal finished the day at 300 for five and I was still at the wicket,? he said. 

Bengal finished the day at 294 for six, still needing 99 to get past Madhya Pradesh?s first innings score of 392 and gain the much-needed two points to stay in the Elite Group. 

Sourav is optimistic. ?Devang is still there along with Laxmi (Ratan Shukla). Laxmi has been in good form all through the season, it will not be so difficult for Bengal,? he said. 

When asked if he ranked this 121 as one of his best Ranji innings, Sourav, who has played very few Ranji Trophy matches in last 10 years, said: ?I cannot remember when I scored my last ton in Ranji, but it must be nearly a decade back.? 

Devang, on the other hand, will be looking for another big stand with Shukla and in the process andcomplete his 17th first class ton. 

?We still have to get 99 more to avoid relegation and so only half the work is done,? Devang said. 

Devang doesn?t want to think about his century. ?A century at this point of time doesn?t mean anything to me, but I am concerned about two crucial points for us.? 

Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh captain Amay Khurasia believes 

that Sourav Ganguly was out in the 64th over. He felt that this might turn out 

to be the turning point of the match. quot;We were standing close and he (Sourav) 

surely got an edge, but the umpire was unmoved,? Khurasia said.

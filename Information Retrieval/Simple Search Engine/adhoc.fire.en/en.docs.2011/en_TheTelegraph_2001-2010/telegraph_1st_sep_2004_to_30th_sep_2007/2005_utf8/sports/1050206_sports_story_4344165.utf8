 Aussies look to seal title

Sydney: Pakistan will have to go all out to prevent Australia from clinching the tri-series when they take on the world champions in the second match of the best-of-three finals on Sunday. 

The home side had won the first match on Friday by 18 runs. If Pakistan win, the decider will be played in Adelaide on Tuesday. 

It was the failure of their top-order that cost Pakistan the match on Friday. 

Inzamam-ul Haq?s boys will need to bat with confidence and authority if they are to nurture any hopes of forcing a third final. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan allrounder Abdul Razzaq has been found not guilty of dissent in the opening final in Melbourne. 

Razzaq faced the charge under the ICC?s Code of Conduct ?for showing dissent? after a wide was called off one of his deliveries Friday. 

But in a statement, the ICC said a panel of Match Referee Chris Broad, umpires Steve Davis and Billy Bowden and third umpire Bob Parry had decided the charge should not be upheld.

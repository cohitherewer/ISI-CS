Memphis: Arjun Atwal had his worst day on the course this season, as he ended with a final round six-over 76 and ended tied 52nd in the Fedex St Judes Classic. 

Atwal, who has now made the cut in the each of the eight starts he has had this season, made just over $ 11,000 Sunday for his effort at the par-70 TPC of Southwind Golf Course after being in contention for a top-ten finish at one stage. 

Meanwhile, Justin Leonard, who started the final day with an eight-shot lead had a tense three and-a-half foot for a bogey on the final hole to barely hold on for a one-shot win over two-time champion David Toms. 

Leonard came in with a three-over 73 and Tomas shot a seven-under 63 to make the contest a thriller. If Leonard had missed, he was going to a play-off and his name would be in the record book for surrendering the biggest lead ever on the PGA Tour. 

The Texan made the putt and then fell onto the green in relief after pulling out a one-stroke victory, the first wire-to-wire win of his career. Leonard closed with a three-over 73 to finish at 14-under 266 and earn his second title of the year and 10th of his career. 

Atwal, who had three bogeys on three straight holes between fifth and seventh, had his awful stretch at the same juncture. He dropped shots on fourth, fifth and seventh and another one on eighth to be four-over in a space of five holes after parring the first three of the day. 

Then he steadied for a series of pars, before a double bogey on the closing 18th. He had no birdies and needed 30 putts and even his driving was short, just over an average of 283 yards. He had just five out of 18 greens in regulation. In terms of score in relation to par, at six-over it was his worst of the season in US. (PTI)

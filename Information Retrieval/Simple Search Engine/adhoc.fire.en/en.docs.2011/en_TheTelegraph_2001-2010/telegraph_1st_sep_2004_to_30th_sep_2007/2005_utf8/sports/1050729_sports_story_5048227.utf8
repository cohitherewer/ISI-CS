New Delhi: Lucky loser Sania Mirzas run was cut short by Wimbledon champion Venus Williams at the $ 585,000 WTA Tour event in Stanford on Wednesday. 

According to information received here, the Indian teenager crashed 3-6, 2-6 against the second-seeded American in front of a sellout crowd of 4,353 which had assembled to watch the night-session second-round match. 

Williams will next play seventh seed Serbian Jelena Jankovic who routed American Amy Frazier 6-0, 6-3 in another quarter final. 

After Sania dropped in the second game of the first set, Williams unfurled her powerful serves to win easy points against the youngster who captured the imagination of the tennis world by running Serena close in a second-round match at the Australian Open. 

Sania made too many mistakes and couldnt keep in touch with the world No. 9. The American hit three straight aces in her first service game of the second set and broke Sania in the first, fifth and seventh games. 

I had a lot of chances and should have capitalised on those a bit more, said Sania, who is nursing a pulled stomach muscle. 

I think it was much closer than what the scoreline suggests. In the second set, I would hit a winner on the first point and she would hit three aces. I guess thats why she won Wimbledon? she plays better on the important points, Sania remarked. 

Sania lost to Israeli Shahar Peer in the final qualifying round but got lucky when American Chanda Rubin withdrew because of an inflamed left ankle. 

Williams, who was returning to the Tour for the first time since her Wimbledon triumph, paid her Indian opponent a compliment. She played quite well, but its not something I havent seen before, she said: Im always ready. Im ready for whatever comes at me because I feel like Ive seen it all at this point. 

My serve definitely picked up, she added. I played a lot better today than what I expected, but also feel like I didnt play that well either.

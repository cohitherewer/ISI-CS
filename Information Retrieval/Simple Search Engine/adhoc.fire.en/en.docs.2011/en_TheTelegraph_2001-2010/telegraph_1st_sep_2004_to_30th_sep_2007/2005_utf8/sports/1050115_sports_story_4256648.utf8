 CA mulls Twenty20 at state level 

Sydney: Full houses in the two Twenty20 matches played in Perth and Melbourne have inspired Cricket Australia to take the format seriously and consider introducing it at the state level from their next domestic season. 

?The signals we?re getting in these last two days is that it?s something the fans are interested in seeing more of and we need to look at the way in which we can introduce it on perhaps a more formal basis next season,? CA chief James Sutherland was quoted as saying by the AAP. 

?For an unofficial match between two state teams to have a capacity crowd is just a phenomenal result,? Sutherland added. 

Of late, the CA was a little bothered about the declining interest of people in cricket but an overwhelming turnout to watch the matches between Western Australia and Victoria followed by Australia A and Pakistan on Thursday indicated a renewed interest in the game with still shorter version of 20-overs-a-side. 

?It?s a fantastic response. You can?t fail to be impressed or excited about the potential,? Sutherland said. 

?As a state player, how could you not enjoy playing in front of a capacity crowd when you?re used to playing in front of a few hundred people?? Sutherland said. (PTI)

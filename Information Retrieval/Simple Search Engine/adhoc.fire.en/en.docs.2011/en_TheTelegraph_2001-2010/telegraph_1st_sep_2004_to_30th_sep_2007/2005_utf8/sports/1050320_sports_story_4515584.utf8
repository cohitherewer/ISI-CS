The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Thin lead for Railways

New Delhi: Hyderabad wasted a golden opportunity to take control of the Ranji Trophy elite division semi-final tie against Railways after suffering a top-order collapse in their second innings on the second day. 

The visitors, who were bowled out for 166 in the first innings, came back strongly to restrict the hosts for 180 in the morning. 

Later with openers T. Suman (32) and Daniel Manohar (63 not out) in fine flow, it just looked like the young Hyderabad side would bat the former champions out of the contest. 

But instead, they once again suffered a batting collapse to finish the day at 131 for five. They now have a lead of just 117 runs with five wickets in hand. 

Suman and Manohar added 68 for the first wicket, but the former?s departure started a collapse. Captain Sanjay Bangar claimed two wickets in successive balls. 

Brief scores: Hyderabad 166 amp; 131/5 (Daniel Manohar 63 n.o.; Murali Kartik 2/43, Sanjay Bangar 2/18). Railways 180 (J.P. Yadav 40, Pragyan Ojha 5/55, P.S. Niranjan 2/4). (PTI)

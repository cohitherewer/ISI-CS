 Karthikeyan finishes 11th

Sepang: Narain Karthikeyan clinched a creditable 11th position in the seventh Malaysian GP, won by Spain?s Fernando Alonso, here Sunday. Jarno Trulli (Toyota) was second. German Nick Heidfeld of Williams was third. 

?Finishing in 11th position here was very good, especially because of the hard weather conditions. The car was very reliable but the race was a bit boring for me,? Narain said. 

Unlike in Melbourne (where he finished 15th) Narain was off to a smooth start, as did his teammate Tiago Monteiro. Although they could do little against the superior teams, the two rookies capitalised on the track incidents to improve their positions on the grid. 

Monteiro (who finished 12th) managed to stay on the course despite a spin after his tyres were caught by some oil on the track. ?I had a good start and took a few positions. I could have almost caught Villeneuve but this manoeuvre would have maybe been a bit risky,? Monteiro said. 

Narain and Monteiro, in fact, completed two trouble-free pit stops. The rest of the race was a matter of maintaining concentration. 

Narain and Monteiro had started 17th and 18th on the grid. 

?The car felt different from Saturday as it was heavier with fuel load. It definitely makes a big difference as you go from quit a light car to a much heavier one,? Narain said after the race. 

A gala welcome awaits the Indian ace at the oil-rich 

gulf kingdom of Bahrain. Narain has received a special invitation from the crown 

prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamed al Khalifa. (PTI)

 Favourites lift Sprinters?, Stayers? trophies 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Favourites were at their task where it mattered most ? the 1,200m Hindu Sprinters Cup and the 3,000m Poonawalla Stud Farms Stayers? Cup, the star events in the Invitational weekend bonanza which began on Saturday. 

 If the Western India-challenger, Blue Horizon, was just about lucky to deliver the goods, in the sprint, after Coral Gables unleashed a mind-boggling run from the rear of the field but missed the winning honour by half-a-length, Star Of Windsor was simply classic and salvaged the Chennai-pride. The MAM-Ramaswamy-owned horse was ridden to victory by B. Prakash for trainer S.Ganapathy.

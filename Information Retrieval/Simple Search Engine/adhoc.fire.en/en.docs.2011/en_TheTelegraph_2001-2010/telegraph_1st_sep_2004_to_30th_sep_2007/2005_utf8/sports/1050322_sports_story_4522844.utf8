 New Delhi: Indian wrestlers won two gold and three silver medals to finish runners-up at the Fila international female junior wrestling tournament IN Riga, Latvia.

 Geeta (48kg) and Geetika Jakhar (63kg) won the gold medals, while Rachna (44kg), Meena (51kg) and Sunita (55kg) claimed silvers in the three-day event that concluded on Sunday, a Wrestling Federation of India release said on Monday.

 Madrid: Real Mallorca midfielder Juan Fernando Arango has regained consciousness after being knocked out in a collision with Sevilla defender Javi Navarro during a Primera Liga match on Sunday.

 ?He has returned to consciousness and is in a better condition now, but he is suffering some amnesia,? Fernando Barturen, head of the Policlinica Miramar?s emergency department, told a news conference on Monday.

 The Venezuelan international went for a 50-50 ball with Navarro but as the players collided, Navarro?s raised elbow connected with Arango?s head.

 Medical teams were quickly on the scene as the 24-year-old midfielder had convulsions, and he was rushed to hospital in Las Palmas. Arango has a broken right cheek bone.

 Navarro received a yellow card for the challenge. He has since apologised for the tackle.

 Zagreb: Dinamo Zagreb have fired coach Ilija Loncarevic after they failed to qualify for Croatia?s championship playoffs and must now fight for first division survival, a club spokesman said on Monday. ?Loncarevic is no longer coach,? the spokesman said, adding that Dinamo would announce a replacement on Tuesday.

 Loncarevic took charge at Dinamo in November after Nenad Gracan, who had succeeded Nikola Jurcevic in September, stepped down.

 London: Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Chelsea, their manager Jose Mourinho, assistant manager Steven Clarke and club security official Les Miles on charges of bringing the game into disrepute.

 The charges, announced on Uefa?s website on Monday, follow the first leg of the Champions League knockout round game in Barcelona when the Spanish side beat Chelsea 2-1.

 In a statement Uefa said they had opened the case ?for making false declarations....?

 After the Barcelona game Chelsea accused referee Anders Frisk and Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard of meeting in a dressing room at halftime. 

 Mourinho sent his side out late for the second half and refused to attend the mandatory post-match news conference.

 Frisk announced his retirement from refereeing 10 days ago after he said he received death threats from fans. 

 Frankfurt: Bayern Munich are interested in signing Chelsea defender Robert Huth to replace Robert Kovac, who plans to leave at the end of the season.

 Zagreb: Glasgow Rangers? Croatia forward Dado Prso plans to quit international soccer after the 2006 World Cup.

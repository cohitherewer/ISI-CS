 Police raid SLC office

 - Chief executive Duleep Mendis resigns 

Colombo: Police and officers of Sri Lanka?s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Tuesday entered the premises of the Sri Lankan cricket board, a cricket official and witnesses said. 

The reason for the raid was not immediately known. There were about 60 to 70 staff members working at that time, board spokesman Ray Illangakoon, said. 

In a related development, Sri Lanka Cricket?s (SLC) chief executive Duleep Mendis quit his post late last week. However, according to a PTI report, the former captain?s resignation has not been accepted. 

Mendis handed over a letter of resignation to SLC?s executive committee. His decision followed questioning by the CID with regard to an alleged refusal to relinquish documents to sports ministry officials. 

?I have handed over my letter of resignation but at this stage I do not want to go into the reasons for my decision,? Mendis said on Tuesday. 

Caught in the middle of the cricket board crisis, Mendis said that he would outline the exact reasons for his decision later in the week. 

Illangakoon, however, said: ?He (Mendis) feels harassed by the interim committee and the police as he is called for so many inquiries.? 

In March, SLC?s registration was suspended by sports minister Jeewan Kumaratunga on the grounds of alleged financial mismanagement. 

A complicated legal dispute ensued as the board?s elected executive committee, headed by president Thilanga Sumathipala, challenged the decision in court. 

Sumathipala?s group obtained a temporary injunction that prevented the minister from dissolving SLC or taking control of the board?s headquarters. However, SLC was compelled to hand over all ?movable property?, including documents, to an interim committee appointed by the minister to run the game. 

An alleged failure to hand over all documents led to a complaint being lodged with police and Mendis being summoned to appear before the CID department. The sports minister?s decision to suspend the board was later followed by a parliamentary gazette designed to change the sports law. 

Sumathipala?s group have objected to the proposed amendments, which include a ban on officials with links to the gambling industry, and are challenging the gazette in court. 

The confusion created by the legal dispute has delayed the appointment of a new coach, the completion of player contracts and stalled a bidding process for the team?s sponsorship rights. 

Sumathipala has claimed that his executive committee remains in charge of all SLC?s infrastructure and the management of the domestic game. 

However, the ICC advised all its members last week to recognise the interim committee, headed by Jayantha Dharmadasa, as the official body.

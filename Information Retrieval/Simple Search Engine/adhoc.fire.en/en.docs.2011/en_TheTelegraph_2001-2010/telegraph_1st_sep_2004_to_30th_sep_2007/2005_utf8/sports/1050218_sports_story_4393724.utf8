The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Randhawa in 25th place

Kuala Lumpur: Defending champion Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand carded an eight-under-par 64 to set the pace in the first round of the storm-hit Malaysian Open Thursday. 

Thongchai was three shots clear of five players ? Swedes Niclas Fasth and Pelle Edberg, Australians Jarrod Moseley and Terry Pilkadaris and Italy?s Emanuele Canonica ? who all carded 67s. 

Ireland?s Padraig Harrington bogeyed three of his last four holes after the two hour late afternoon stoppage to end with a 71. 

India?s Jyoti Randhawa, even with a two under 70 first round, was tied at 25th spot. He was way up, compared to Jeev Milkha Singh?s 71 at tied 43rd, and Gaurav Ghei?s three over for a tied 114th. Rahil Gangjee?s card was delayed and he was tentatively tied at around 60th position. 

Pilkadaris was the only player in the leading six who competed in the afternoon half of the draw which was disrupted by a storm. When bad light stopped play a total of 45 players had still to complete their first round. (Reuters)

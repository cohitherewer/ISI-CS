 Karthikeyan: Russia, like India, likely to host Formula One in future

Moscow: Jordan gave Russians a taste of Formula One on Friday with the launch of their 2005 car on Moscow?s snow-speckled Red Square. 

The British-based team, bought by Russian-born Canadian businessman Alex Shnaider last month, will be renamed Midland next year. 

The steel magnate has promised the team will adopt a Russian flavour and drop its former rock-and-roll image. Jordan say this season will be about trying to finish races and picking up the odd point rather than podiums and champagne. 

Team principal Colin Kolles said the team?s all-rookie line-up of Portugal?s Tiago Monteiro and India?s Narain Karthikeyan ? his country?s first Formula One driver ? could still spring some surprises however. 

?The team is in better shape than we expected,? Kolles said. ?We think they are very strong and fast drivers and I think that they will be quite a surprise for a lot of people.? 

Karthikeyan?s arrival on the scene has triggered Formula One fever in India, where his every move is being closely watched. ?It?s a proud moment for me and my country,? he said. ?The whole of India is supporting me. I hope I can live up to their expectations and do a good job.? 

Karthikeyan was elated to visit Russia and said the country, like India, had the necessary ingredients to be on the F1 map. 

?I think Russia, like my home country India, is a nation which would very much like to host a race in future,? Karthikeyan said. ?There are many similarities between us, although the climate is certainly not one of them. 

?It?s such a great business opportunity for sponsors and with the sport attracting interest in new countries, the fans are increasing in number day by day,? added Karthikeyan. 

Karthikeyan also made known his displeasure over the instruction that the national flag may not be displayed by sportsmen. ?I think it?s blown out of proportions. All countries display their national colours in this or that form,? Narain said. 

The season starts in Melbourne on March 6. 

With modest ambitions for the season, the launch was all about the location. Jordan?s trademark yellow car was parked on the cobblestones just in front of the multi-coloured onion domes of St. Basil?s Cathedral, overlooked by the Kremlin and just metres away from revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin?s mausoleum. 

A military band warmed up the small crowd who had braved sub-zero temperatures to view the Toyota-powered car. 

Flamboyant team founder, Irishman Eddie Jordan, was happy to take a back seat for the first time in his 14 years in Formula One. (Agencies)

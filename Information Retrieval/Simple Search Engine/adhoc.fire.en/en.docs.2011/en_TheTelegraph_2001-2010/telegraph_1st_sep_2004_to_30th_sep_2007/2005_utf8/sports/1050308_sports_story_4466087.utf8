The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Got to keep it simple? Every session will be crucial? The more focused the better? 

 - Team India captain Sourav Ganguly talks about the Indo-Pak series and leadership ahead of starting his 6th year at the helm 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Chandigarh: Be it a one-on-one with Steve Waugh 

or ?crowning? Sania Mirza or even a pep talk to in-the-dumps Mohun Bagan footballers, 

Sourav Ganguly has done it all in Team India?s two-and-half month break from engagements. 

Come Tuesday, though, and the action ? potentially explosive ? begins with the start of the three-Test series against Pakistan. Incidentally, Day-II (March 9) will mark the beginning of Sourav?s sixth year at the helm. 

Despite the heavy demand on time, Sourav spoke to The Telegraph at the team hotel on Monday afternoon ? the one-on-one, by the way, got delayed as the captain mulled over which bat to use in his first Test innings of 2005. 

The following are excerpts 

Q What are your thoughts on the eve of such 

a big series? 

A That we?ve got to keep it simple and 

play well... Every session is going to be crucial... The more focused, then, the 

better. 

As captain, is this your biggest series at home? 

No... It isn?t bigger than the one versus Australia, 

in 2000-01. The excitement will, perhaps, be more because it?s a series involving 

Pakistan, but that?s about it. 

How should high pressure series? be handled? 

By not treating them differently from the rest... 

Of course, every session becomes more important. 

Many feel this is about the weakest Pakistan 

side in recent years. Do you agree? 

The experience may not be much, but the players are 

talented and have the ability to become matchwinners... It?s a young team... I?m 

not underestimating anybody. 

Could the Australia-factor ? which worked for 

us when we toured Pakistan, after a trip Down Under ? this time benefit Inzamam-ul 

Haq and Co.? 

(Grins) But isn?t there a difference? I mean, 

we outplayed Australia in the drawn Test series, whereas Pakistan lost all three 

matches...

in Rawalpindi last year

You?ve consistently maintained the past is history. 

But, surely, the immediate past does have some value in a big series? 

Perhaps... However, we aren?t assured of winning this 

series just because we won the last time... As I said at the Media conference, 

matches aren?t won on paper... But, yes, the history element gives confidence... 

To talk specifically of Pakistan, everybody is aware we beat them even when they 

had Shoaib Akhtar. 

Is too much being made of Shoaib?s absence? 

Pakistan, I suppose, are going to miss him... Beyond 

that, I?ve got nothing to say... 

Are you in agreement with Glenn McGrath that 

Shoaib is more of a showman? 

It won?t be proper to make a comment. 

Looking back, what gave us the winning edge 

in Pakistan last year? 

Our batting... 

How much of a difference can leadership make? 

Depends... But leadership is a factor. 

You must be pleased that Ian Chappell and Mushtaq 

Mohammed have placed you well in front of Inzy... 

It?s nice that such gifted former captains think so 

highly .... At the same time, personally, I?ve never been influenced by how others 

have judged me... I?ve always assessed myself independently. 

Okay, but have the high marks put you under 

more pressure? 

No. 

How do you rate Inzy as captain? 

Inzy?s good... He?s not demonstrative, but that?s 

because his style is different... Actually, I don?t think it?s proper to make 

comparisons. 

Given that the tour wasn?t many days away, were 

you surprised when Inzy ranked you as the No.1 captain? It meant he was conceding 

psychological points... 

(Laughs) I don?t think I showed any emotion 

when I read that... 

 What should be the dos for Team India over the 

next few weeks? 

Be disciplined and be positive. 

And, the don?ts? 

We must not be complacent... 

Are you disappointed that the passion-enhancing 

India flag can?t be displayed on, for example, the helmet... 

Well, there?s a government directive... It?s not for 

me to speak about it. In any case, it?s a sensitive issue. 

Is there a ?fear? that Sania and Narain Karthikeyan 

will end the cricketers? monopoly over sports headlines? 

It?s good for sport, isn?t it? 

The last question: Despite being superstitious, 

you?re back in the same room as on your last Team India-related visit to Chandigarh 

(October 2003) when surgery forced you to miss that Test against New Zealand... 

(Grins again) I only realised that after checking-in!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Confident batting anywhere 

 - I made good use of opportunities that came my way: Gambhir 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Chennai: Gautam Gambhir faced one of the biggests tests of his career when he was asked to open the innings against Sri Lanka in Ahmedabad. He came out with flying colours, after a two-and-a-half year hiatus from the one-day side, scoring a superb 103. 

He has delivered in the limited opportunities since. In Bangalore, the other day against South Africa, he scored a quickfire 38. Gambhirs success has meant India have another viable option at the top. 

The Delhi opener spoke to The Telegraph on Sunday evening. The following are excerpts: 

Q You knew it would be very tough to make it to the one-day squad. How did you motivate yourself? 

A I firmly believed my time would come. The aim was to score runs and make optimum use of opportunities that came my way. Form of the game didnt matter, the runs were important. The good thing was that I could score quickly both in Tests and one-dayers. With the runs behind me, I was certain the selectors wouldnt ignore me for long. 

You seem to have displaced Virender Sehwag from the top in one-dayers? 

You cannot say that. He is a class player and has proved himself for so long. In Bangalore, he was back among runs. You can never write him off. I have only made good use of the opportunities that came my way. 

Are you comfortable batting lower down the order too? 

That is for the team management to decide. I can only say that I am confident batting at any position. 

 Did you believe you would be an instant hit in one-dayers since you were labelled a Test specialist? 

I have always been a positive kind of a person? Never allowed any negative thoughts to hinder me. I knew there would be opportunities and I had to utilise them. That has helped me achieve success in these few matches. 

Any technical adjustments? 

Nothing to really talk about? As I told you, its basically staying positive and playing my natural game that have come in handy. 

Has Ahmedabad opened up new opportunities? 

It has? Making a comeback after two-and-a-half years, and a century to begin with? It was just unbelievable. A great feeling and I just enjoyed the moment. My teammates were very supportive all along. 

You seem to have sealed your seat at least for sometime in the one-day side. Do you feel any wrong step might prove disastrous? 

I have never thought on those lines. I always look to perform better. I believe theres always room for improvement. Theres no point creating pressure by negative thoughts. 

As Delhiites, you and Sehwag hit off really well. How does this chemistry work? 

Weve played a lot together. Be it for ONGC or Delhi or North Zone, were used to each others style of play. In a way we complement each other. 

Veeru can help a lot in building your confidence. As a senior, he gives me a lot of advice, which helps me in moulding my game. At times, just watching him bat from the other end can be very encouraging. He can help a lot in easing the tension and his aggression might just rub off on you. 

What has been Greg Chappells contribution in your transformation? 

Greg has been a constant source of motivation and gives you a lot of confidence. He makes you feel important even if you are not in the team. Hes very useful in helping you stay in fine nick. He has helped me stay positive and play my shots. The assurance makes things a lot easier. 

And Rahul Dravid? 

Hes doing a great job. The team is doing well and that is most important. 

Who has been the toughest bowler youve faced? 

Undoubtedly Shaun Pollock. I first faced him in my debut series in Bangladesh and then the Tests last year. He hasnt lost that probing line, variation and ability to spring surprises even now. 

Your favourite batsmen? 

Brian Lara. Among the Indians, Dravid. 

What is your biggest asset? 

To be really positive about myself. Then my family members ? mom, dad, mama, grandparents and friend. Their support and guidance have been invaluable.

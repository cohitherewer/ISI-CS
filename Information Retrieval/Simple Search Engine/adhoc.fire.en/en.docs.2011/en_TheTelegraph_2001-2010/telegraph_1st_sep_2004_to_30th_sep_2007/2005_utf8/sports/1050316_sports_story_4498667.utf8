The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bucknor is no Frisk

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bucknor says standing in four World Cup finals is his real achievement 

Calcutta: Steve Bucknor is not keen on doing an Anders Frisk. The ICC Elite Panel umpire, just hours away from standing in his 100th Test, is unfazed by any threat. 

Sweden?s Frisk, one of the world?s top soccer referees, announced a few days ago that he was quitting after receiving death threats. The cricket umpire from Jamaica, who has also got similar threats in South Africa, claims such intimidation hardly moves him. 

?In Jamaica, threats come day in and day out. On the sidelines of local matches, there are people with firearms, telling you what to do and what not. Some of these threats are genuine and some are alcohol-driven. I?m not really worried about all this,? said Bucknor, at the Eden on Tuesday. 

Nicknamed ?Slow Death Bucknor? (for taking a long time to make his decisions), the 58-year-old has reasons to counter it. ?True, you?ve to take split-second decisions in soccer, but there?s time to deliberate in cricket. While giving a verdict, I ask myself many questions and once the answers come out positively, I arrive at a decision,? remarked Bucknor, who has officiated a World Cup qualifier. 

For him, standing in four World Cup finals is the real ?achievement?, bigger than the 100-Test landmark which he will be touching at the Eden on Wednesday. His explanation: ?As far as 100 Tests are concerned, I?m working to feed my family and so it?s something that happens on the way.? 

Steve Waugh, according to Bucknor, was the toughest captain to deal with in his illustrious career. ?Sourav is also very tough,? he pointed out, adding that Inzamam-ul Haq is ?one of the easiest captains to handle.? 

He described some players? decision to walk as ?personal?, but is averse to the idea of sledging on the field. ?I won?t mind if a bowler tells something to a batsman and the batsman replies and everything ends in a smile. But if there is anything unfair going on, it?s my duty to get involved,? commented Bucknor. 

The Pakistan team, meanwhile, will welcome Bucknor to the field with a huge cake.

Beijing: Adam Scott fired a course record nine-under-par 63 to set the pace after first round play resumed at the Johnnie Walker Classic on Friday. 

The Australian was three under after 10 holes when heavy gusts halted play in Beijing on Thursday and he continued in the same vein despite having to wake up before dawn. 

South African Retief Goosen, New Zealand?s Michael Campbell and Swede Peter Hanson were all tied with Scott having played 36 holes. 

Scott?s 63 matched the best round at the meet . 

The world No. 10 resumed with successive birdies and finished birdie-eagle-birdie, chipping in at the last to leave himself four strokes clear of playing partner Sergio Garcia. 

Hanson, who won his maiden European Tour title in San Roque last weekend, also fired a 65 in the afternoon. 

Garcia improved his overnight score of one under par to five under with a solid first-round 67. 

Among the Indians, Jyoti Randhawa looks likely to be the only one keeping the challenge going, and that too only just. Randhawa, one-under for the first round, carded a one-over 73 and tied 57 and par for two rounds. 

The cut was likely to come at par, as only 42 players have completed their second round. 

Amandeep Johl, four-over 76 for first round, would need to shoot at least four-under to keep chances alive. 

He was yet to start the second round and Rahil Gangjee, seven-over for first round, would have to come up with one of his best-ever rounds on Asian Tour to make the grade. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, three-over for first round, was one over after 15 holes and had little chance of getting to par for the tournament in remaining three holes. 

Harmeet Kahlon, five over for first round, was also yet to start his second round.

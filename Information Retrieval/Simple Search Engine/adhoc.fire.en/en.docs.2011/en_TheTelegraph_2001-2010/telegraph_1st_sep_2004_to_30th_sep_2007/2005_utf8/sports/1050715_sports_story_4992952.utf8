The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dalmiyas no comment on Bajpai issue

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya has refused to comment on former city police commissioner Dinesh Bajpais decision to contest the presidents post at the annual general meeting of the Cricket Association of Bengal on July 27. 

Its too early to say anything, the CAB president said on Thursday. 

Bajpai ? who is the Bengal Hockey Association president ? is expected to file his nomination papers before Tuesday. 

Dalmiya is too busy with national and international cricket politics and has no time for Bengal, Bajpai said. He has no heart for Bengal. Clubs have been approaching me for quite sometime now. Initially I was reluctant but when the pressure grew I decided to contest. 

The high profile elections may also see contests to the post of joint secretaries. The ruling group is likely to put up Amitava Banerjee and Arun Mitra as candidates.

 It was an average race: Narain

Suzuka: The heavens did not open up and Narain Karthikeyan could not make his best qualifying race count to finish a disappointing 16th in the Japanese Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the Formula One season, here at the Suzuka Circuit on Sunday. 

Karthikeyan had on Saturday clocked his best in qualifying to finish 11th ahead of other leading drivers of the season. 

I made a good start but got it a little bit wrong in the first corner because it was the first ever lap for me on these race tyres owing to my problems on Friday afternoon? Also the grip level was not perfect, a disappointed Narain said. 

After the safety car went in I was able to hang on behind Massa until my first stop. The front tyres were gaining a lot and after the second pit stop, I really struggled with the car balance, as it was under-steering. 

Near the end of the race, I had to change my right front tyre, which unfortunately cost me some time. In general, it was an average race. 

For the twenty cars at the start of the Grand Prix on the dry circuit, a 5,807 km-long track, the weather changed radically overnight from heavy rain to bright sunshine. 

And Narain was glad that he finished a good race despite the conditions not exactly to his liking. 

When I saw the bright sun this morning, I knew I would not be able to maintain Saturdays excellent momentum. 

Right away, on lap one, I let through both Kimi Raikkonen and Michael Schumacher who were both behind me, he said. 

Then at the end of the first lap, we had the first problem between Montoya and Jacques Villeneuve. I was wise and was able to avoid Montoyas spectacular accident in the last turn from lap one. Luckily, I did not run over debris which could have damaged my tyres at that point. 

With the two fast German and Finnish drivers from Ferrari and McLaren ahead of Narain, he automatically lost two positions in the Grand Prix classification and a bit of time but was still running a good pace in 13th position.

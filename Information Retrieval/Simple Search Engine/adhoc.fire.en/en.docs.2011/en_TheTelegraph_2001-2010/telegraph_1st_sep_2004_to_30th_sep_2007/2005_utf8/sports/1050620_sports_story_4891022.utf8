 Korchnoi let off hook by Sasi

Paks: Krishnan Sasikiran missed out on his chances and drew with GM Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland in the sixth round of the third Marx Gyorgy Memorial Grandmasters tournament here. 

With his fifth draw in six games, Sasikiran improved his situation a little as Zoltan Almasi of Hungary outplayed top seed Emil Sutovsky of Israel to join Korchnoi in lead on 4.5 points. 

With four rounds to go, Sasikiran moved to third with Sutovsky (2.5 each) while Ferenc Berkes and Peter Acs stayed bottom (2 each). 

Sasikiran is almost out of title race now, but in the sixth round he troubled Korchnoi with black pieces. 

The 74-year-old legend who was a world championship contender before Sasikiran was born, started off with the English opening and could get nowhere as Sasikiran neutralised whites initiative with well-crafted manoeuvres. 

Sacrificing a pawn in move 12 and recovering it back five moves later, Sasikiran ensured white only had to defend for the remaining part as Korchnoi had a wrecked pawn structure on the queenside. 

Sasikiran knocked down one pawn on the queenside and the game soon drifted to an endgame with same side pawns. The experienced Korchnoi went for correct exchanges to deny Sasikiran the decisive advantage. The Indian could have done better but it was not easy to convert his extra pawn to a full point. The peace was signed after 91 moves.

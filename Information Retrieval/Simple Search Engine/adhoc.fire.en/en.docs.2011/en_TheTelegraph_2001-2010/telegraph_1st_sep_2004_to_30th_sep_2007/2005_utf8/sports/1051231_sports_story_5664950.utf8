 And, controversy 

 No. 1...

 This was the mother of all explosions! 

 It rocked our cricket and threatened to divide Team India 

 down the middle. It began in Bulawayo, venue of the first 

 Test against Zimbabwe, when Sourav Ganguly went public with 

 the sensational bit about coach Greg Chappell having asked 

 him to step down on the eve of the series. A patch-up (without 

 meaning) ensued, but Chappells confidential e-mail 

 to the BCCI brass got leaked and, for a while, everything 

 was out of control. Eventually, Sourav not only lost the 

 captaincy, but his place in the one-day team. He was there 

 for the first two Tests against Sri Lanka, but got dropped 

 for the last a decision which sparked a national 

 uproar. However, Sourav ended 2005 by being selected for 

 the Test series in Pakistan

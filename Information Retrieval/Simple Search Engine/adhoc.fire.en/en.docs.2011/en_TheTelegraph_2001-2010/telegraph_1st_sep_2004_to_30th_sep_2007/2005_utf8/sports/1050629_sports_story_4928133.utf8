 Australia post 261/9

Birmingham: Englands pace bowlers checked Australia with a late rally as the world champions were pegged back to 261 for nine in their triangular series day-nighter on Tuesday. 

Andrew Symonds crafted 74 off 75 balls and a 101-run stand with Mike Hussey. 

But Darren Gough, smashed to all parts early on, and Steve Harmison combined in perfect fashion as five wickets fell for 30 runs during the final 10 overs. 

Gough ended with three for 70 off nine overs while Harmison took two for 38 off 10. (Reuters)

 Bhupathi-Bjorkman in title-round

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Mahesh Bhupathi and Jonas Bjorkman upped the tempo just when they had to Friday night, en route to the Chennai Open doubles final. 

The high-profile top seeds (Bjorkman is world No. 3 and Bhupathi No. 5) overcame a slow start in the second set to shut out the unseeded US-Czech pair of Kevin Kim and Jiri Vanek 6-2, 6-3. 

Having swept Kim and Vanek off their feet in the first set, the top seeds trailed 1-3 in the second (Bjorkman was broken) before reeling off five games on the trot to win in style. 

This is Bhupathi and Bjorkman?s third final entry in as many ATP meets. The pair won the title in Bastad (Sweden) and finished second-best in Moscow, both in2004. 

?I think we have been playing quite well this week? there have been a few ups and downs, but by and large I?m happy with both Mahesh?s and my form,? Bjorkman said. ?It?s my singles performance which disappointed me.? The fourth-seeded Swede lost in round 2 to Justin Gimelstob. 

Bhupathi and Bjorkman now await the winner of the Leander Paes-Nenad Zimonjic versus Yen-Hsun Lu-Rainer Schuettler semi-final. On the prospect of that dream Sunday clash, Bhupathi played down the hype. ?See, we all know each other?s game, so whoever plays well that evening will win,? he remarked. 

Paes on the mike 

Paes, enjoying an off day, spent some time in front of the microphone, doubling up as TV commentator. The ?vacancy? was due to Vijay Amritraj?s one-day trip to Mumbai to address the NRI conference. 

?I quite enjoyed my stint? I?ve done it before and would love to do it again,? Paes quipped before leaving the stadium.

 Merchant, Advani lose 

Mumbai: The Chinese pair of Jin Long and Tian Pengfei outplayed Indian pair Yasin Merchant and Pankaj Advani 1009-620 in the final of the Reid and Taylor Bombay Gymkhana Insta Snooker Doubles Tournament here on Saturday. 

The Chinese pair was behind Merchant and Advani 216-269 even after four frames, but they lifted their game a few notches as Long rifled a break of 85 in the fifth game. 

He followed it up with breaks of 67 in the seventh, 80 in the ninth and Pengfei got a 76 in the 10th as the Indians were reduced to mere passive spectators. 

The difference of 389 points at the end reflected the standards of the two teams. It were the Indians who found the early rhythm, with Advani potting well but Yasin struggled, as he did in the semi-finals as well. 

A break of 58 in the second frame by Advani contributed for the Indian teams prospects, but the Chinese, were always pouncing in when the slightest opportunity arose. 

Both the times it was Yasin, who gave them the break, missing relatively easy pots to lay the path for the Chinese resurgence. 

Jin Long and Tian Pengfei chose to play down their victory, saying it was more of an exchange programme between the two countries rather than a competitive final. 

But the manner in which they decimated the challenge of the Indians told a different story.

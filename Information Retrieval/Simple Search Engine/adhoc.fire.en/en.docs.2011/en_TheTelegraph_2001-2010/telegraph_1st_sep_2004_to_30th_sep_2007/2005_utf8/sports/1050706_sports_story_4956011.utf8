 Mainline pacers in fine fettle: Lillee

Chennai: Dennis Lillee on Tuesday said that the mainline Indian fast bowlers ? Zaheer Khan, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Irfan Pathan, Ashish Nehra and Ajit Agarkar ? are in fine fettle ahead of the start of the new season. 

Lillee, who returned here from the Bangalore camp after interacting with Indian coach Greg Chappell and the players at the formers request, said that both he and T. A. Sekar (chief coach of MRF Pace Foundation) had analysed video footage of all 15 bowlers. The adjustments to be carried by each of them on their bowling had already been given to Greg. 

Remember they all have come out of a off-season. So they are just trying to bowl a line and length. It is good I had the chance to see them just before they start of a new season, Lillee said. 

He felt that the players are doing the right things. Must say that they are doing the things they should be doing. Somewhere if someone had few a things, I did correct. On the whole, it was a good opportunity and timing. 

After all, all of them had been with me at different times earlier on. I only needed to make slight adjustments, he said. 

There would be frequent sessions of analysing the bowlers progress, Sekar said, adding that Lillee would leave for home this weekend and be back in August. I think the bowlers are happy being monitored by Lillee before the start of the new season. 

On more youngsters taking to fast bowling, Lillee felt they understood the rigours of bowling better. Let me compare the time that I first came here in 1987. I had difficulty in getting youngsters in the 14-17 age group. This was mainly because India did not have role models. Kapil Dev was there, but he was not among the top. Kapil became a great bowler and one of the greatest ever from India, but he was not in the same league as Brett Lee or Jeff Thompson. 

The boys I see now are better prepared to bowl fast. Out of the blue they can come up one-day and bowl genuinely fast. (PTI)

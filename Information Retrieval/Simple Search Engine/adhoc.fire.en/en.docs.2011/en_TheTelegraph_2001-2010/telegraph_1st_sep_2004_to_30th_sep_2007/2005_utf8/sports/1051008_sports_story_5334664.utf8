 Mariano Hood tests positive

Buenos Aires: Argentine doubles specialist Mariano Hood has admitted testing positive for a banned drug at the French Open. 

I have been informed that there was a positive result in the doping (test), Hood said. 

Argentine media reported on Friday that Hood had been informed by the ITF and that the substance he took was finasteride. According to the reports, Hood had been taking the substance for nine years in pill form to prevent hair loss and it was added to the ATPs list of banned drugs last November as a masking agent.

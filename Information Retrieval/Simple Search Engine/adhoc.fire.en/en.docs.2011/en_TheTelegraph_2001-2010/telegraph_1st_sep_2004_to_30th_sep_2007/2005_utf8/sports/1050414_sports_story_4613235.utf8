The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India rely too much on part-timers

 - This enforced break can be a blessing in disguise for Sourav 

JAVED MIANDAD

 Inzy?s innings was a classic for youngsters who want to learn art of one-day batting 

It?s time for India to address some critical issues. They haven?t got the bowling to pull them through, especially in the sub-continent. 

A good one-day side must have five wicket-taking bowlers. It is accepted that out of these five, at least a couple would be smashed around the park. In the next match, it could be the turn of other two. An extra bowler gives you an extra option. 

India made a mammoth 315 and yet were defensive in the field. They themselves didn?t trust their bowling options and ended up doing all the running. The message was evident in the way the field was set in the middle overs. It was neither defending singles nor stopping boundaries. 

To Pakistan?s credit, they quickly sized up the Indians and their confused state of mind. India are banking far too much on their part-timers; it would expose them in the ring and stop them from becoming a good one-day side. 

Inzamam, on the other hand, showed the value of the captain for teams who hail from the sub-continent. Teams from our region need strong leaders for the rest to play out of their skin. If the captain loses authority, the rest allow themselves to drift without remorse. 

India, at the moment, are trying to bury the opposition under the mountain of runs their batsmen can plunder. But what happens when they are dismissed for 240? They stand little chance for they haven?t invested in bowlers. 

It implies there is an imbalance in the side and any good opposition only needs to build decent partnerships. The science of one-day cricket is exact in its law; it is a game of 100 overs and not 50, and all 11, rather than just one or two, need to pull their weight. 

Sourav Ganguly has already copped enough from the Ahmedabad tie for me to twist the knife further in his wound. But speaking from a larger perspective, he slowed up the momentum of his team while batting. It was a classic case of wretched form intimidating the captain within him. Those 15-20 runs missed at the crease could have panicked Pakistan, who have never been successful in chasing a 300-plus total. 

It was a critical moment for India. They lost the momentum and a chance to open up a two-match advantage. 

The shadow of this blight could be as dark and long as the hour of madness India exhibited in the Bangalore Test. Both could cost them from being overwhelmingly superior to now sharing the podium or even losing in this topsy-turvy series. 

Inzy?s innings was a classic for those youngsters who want to learn the art of one-day batting. He kept one end going when the quick dismissals of Yousuf Youhana and Younis Khan had put the skids under Pakistan?s feet. The stand between Abdul Razzaq and Shoaib Malik acted as the foundation. 

Sachin Tendulkar played an innings which befitted his stature. He batted with composure, style and lot of common sense. He showed the value of singles in one-day cricket. Yuvraj Singh too rediscovered his touch and that?s what Ganguly needs to do.

 Contests likely to be close today 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: It is hard to envisage the piping-hot favourite Knowledgeables defeat in Thursdays first race but the rest of the five events in the frame hold some promise for RCTC punters. 

 The presence of the Mumbai-based jockey, P.S. Chauhan, in most of the events, ensures that the gold-and-brown brigade is back in the serious business after a virtual boycott of the sport last week. Contests are, therefore, going to be close, and odds offered on favourites in the ring are expected to be respectable.

 Alarico takes on Remarquable in the chief event, the 1,400m Robin Hood Cup. Its a toss up between the two youngsters, and make no mistake, either of the two is capable of landing the trophy. 

 The Alcinia-Aguilas and Regal Romance-Star Memories-contests are also going to be close in the Topspin Handicap and the String Of Pearls Cup, respectively.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

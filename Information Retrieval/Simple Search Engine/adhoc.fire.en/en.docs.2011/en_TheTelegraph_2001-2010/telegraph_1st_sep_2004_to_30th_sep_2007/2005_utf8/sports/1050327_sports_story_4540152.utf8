The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Records don?t drive me... it?s the desire to get the team out of difficult situations?

 - If needed, I?m going to open... Equally, I won?t mind batting at No.10: Younis Khan

Bangalore: Younis Khan has done better than the best who have taken guard in India. In pure black-and-white, his 267 in the first innings here is the highest by a visiting batsman. Till Friday afternoon, the masterly Rohan Kanhai held that record (256 at the Eden, 1958-59). 

Powered by the 27-year-old Pathan?s showpiece effort, Pakistan reached a high of 570. 

?Records don?t drive me... Rather, it?s the desire to get the team out of difficult situations... Agar phas gayi hai, to nikalna hai... This approach won?t change,? Younis, who promptly offered sajda on reaching his maiden double century, told The Telegraph. 

Younis, who had learnt of his appointment as vice-captain many hours after the selectors took that speculation-triggering decision, failed in Mohali (9 and 1) but posted a superb 147 in innings No.1 at the Eden. 

?I rate that as the more satisfying century... Frankly, I?m not thrilled I scored 267 in 504 balls... I would have been happier had I got the runs in 404 deliveries... But, then, I had to play according to the circumstances,? he pointed out. 

Among others, that elicited high praise from Pakistan?s first superstar ? Hanif Mohammed. In the city for the ongoing Test, he said: ?Younis has shown he isn?t just a strokemaker, but can build a shandaar innings...? 

Hanif continues to head Pakistan?s highest scorers? table with his 337 at the expense of the West Indies five decades ago. 

To return to Younis, given what drives him, it?s no surprise he doesn?t regret failing to become the only Pakistani to take a triple off India. His CV, of course, will show eight centuries in 35 Tests. 

Younis, it may be recalled, wasn?t picked when India toured Pakistan last year and, in Imran Khan?s opinion, that contributed to the hosts losing the Test series 1-2. 

?It?s nice to know Imranbhai thinks so highly of me... In fact, he?s my hero... Attitude, approach... Being positive... I?ve learnt everything from him... Sab kuch unhi se seekha hai,? Younis revealed. 

[Incidentally, word is that the selectors (with Wasim Bari in the chair) gave him the vice-captaincy after the iconic Imran declared he was suited for the captaincy!] 

Among the present-day cricketers, Younis admires Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara and Ricky Ponting besides his own captain ? Inzamam-ul Haq. 

Even if that ?selection? is predictable, Younis doesn?t otherwise fit a stereotype. That came through when he took questions from the Media (after Day II). For example, he acknowledged ?kuchlog? did suggest he opt for a ?safer slot? instead of No.3. 

The one-drop position is, perhaps, the most difficult. 

?However, I didn?t go along because, then, Asim Kamal pe jyatti hoti? I didn?t want him to face what I had to when we toured the West Indies soon after my debut in 1999-00... Despite seniors being around, I was sent at No.3,? Younis explained. 

He continued, grinning: ?Tomorrow, if needed, I?m going to open... Equally, if the requirement is such, I won?t mind batting at No.10 or wherever... I don?t have an ego... Mere liye koi masla nahin hai.? 

Younis and Kamal are buddies with a capital B, but 

Pakistan can only benefit from the vice-captain?s attitude.

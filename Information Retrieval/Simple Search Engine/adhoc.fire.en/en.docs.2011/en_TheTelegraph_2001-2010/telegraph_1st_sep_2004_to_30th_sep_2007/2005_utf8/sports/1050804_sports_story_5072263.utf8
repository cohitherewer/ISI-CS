 Sania to face Petrova

New Delhi: Sania Mirza took another giant stride towards her goal of making it to the top-50 in world rankings with a 6-2, 6-2 thumping of Italys Tathiana Garbin in the first round of the $1.3-million Acura Classic womens tennis event in San Diego (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). 

Up against a 78th-ranked player, Sania had an unexpectedly easy outing at the La Costa Resort and Spa venue on Tuesday, according to information received here. 

The win, combined with her two qualifying round victories, would give 59th ranked sania 43.5 Tour points (including bonus points) and push her ranking at least by another four places up on the WTA charts. 

The 18-year-old Indian will be up against fourth seed Nadia Petrova of Russia in the second round. 

Petrova is ranked eighth in the world but yet to win a WTA Tour title. A win against the top-10 player would give Sania that many bonus points and speed up her entry into the top-50 bracket.

 New test for us: Vaughan

 - England arrive in Pakistan 

Islamabad: England players will have to adapt quickly to very different conditions if they are to make a success of their tour of Pakistan, captain Michael Vaughan warned on Wednesday. 

The tourists are buoyant after reclaiming the Ashes with their home series triumph against Australia, but Vaughan said: This is going to be a challenging series for us playing in different conditions. 

The players will have to make some technical changes to do well after their win at home, he told reporters after the England squad arrived in Islamabad amid tight security. 

These are new turf for a lot of our lads and they are excited about trying to do well here in Pakistan, who have improved in the last year. 

The tourists are without injured pace bowler Simon Jones, who played a big part in Englands Ashes success. 

He is an important member of the side and played an important role in the Ashes win, Vaughan said. But it is an opportunity for other guys to grab their chances. 

England play three Tests and five one-day Internationals on a 58-day tour. They have four days to get acclimatised before facing a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Patrons XI in a three-day game in Rawalpindi starting on October 31. 

Vaughan said in order to displace Australia as the No.1 team in the world, England would have to start winning away as consistently as at home. This tour and the one to India after Christmas is part of our bid to become the No.1 side in the world as we are still not there, he said. 

On their last tour of Pakistan five years ago, England won the Test series 1-0. The last series between the two teams in 2001 was drawn 1-1 in England. 

Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is keen to involve the touring England side in fund-raising activities to help the earthquake victims. 

However, a senior PCB official ruled out any chance of England visiting earthquake-ravaged areas. 

Another official said the England players had planned golf events in Islamabad and Lahore to raise funds. 

 They may also visit some 

 of the victims in hospitals, he added. (REUTERS)

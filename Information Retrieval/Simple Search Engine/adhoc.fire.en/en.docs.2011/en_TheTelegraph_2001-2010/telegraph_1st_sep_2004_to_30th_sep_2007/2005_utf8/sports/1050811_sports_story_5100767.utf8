The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England are now Australia

 - A spot of role reversal is going on? in terms of change 

 in attitude

 England have won a live Test match 

 against Australia. Its one victory each with three 

 games to come. This is not only a prospect to relish, it 

 is also something that should make every England cricket 

 supporter proud to be Australian.

 As for Australia, they took their 

 defeat decently, philosophically, sportingly, vowed to do 

 better next time, talked about their respect for the England 

 cricketers and then went and had a beer with them. Almost, 

 one might think they were English. Is there a spot of role 

 reversal going on?

 Its not an inadvertent thing, 

 not on Englands part. For the better part of a decade, 

 England have been coldly and deliberately trying to be more 

 Australian. They have stopped short of Vegemite sandwiches 

 and singing Two Little Boys, but only just.

 Turning into Australia has been 

 the England masterplan. Why not? Every painter wants to 

 be Vincent van Gogh without the sad bits, so England cricket 

 has tried to be like Australia without the sad bits.

 They have sought to create a culture 

 of excellence, of purposeful progress towards being the 

 very best in the world. Obviously, the easiest way to do 

 this is to steal as much as you can from the best in the 

 world.

 So they did things such as setting 

 up an academy and putting an Australian in charge of it. 

 Rodney Marsh, former Australia wicketkeeper, former holder 

 of the Sydney-to-London tinnie-drinking record and former 

 dedicated insulter of English cricket, has been teaching 

 our boys to be better pie-throwers.

 But above all, it is the Australian 

 attitude that England have sought to steal, the notion that 

 nothing is compromised in the pursuit of excellence and 

 that when it comes to matchplay, you play with your guts 

 on show and you play to win. Above all ? and this is the 

 really difficult bit ? you expect to win.

 This business of expecting to 

 win was at the heart of Australias extraordinary fightback 

 from a situation in which all was apparently lost. Even 

 when it was absurd to continue, they believed that they 

 could win. And they near as damn it did.

 But despite the return of the 

 old self-doubt in the final stages of that unforgettable 

 match, the fact is that England did manage to win, that 

 Stephen Harmison did manage to produce a rearing beast to 

 finish things off.

 Perhaps England are beginning 

 to work out which bits of Australia they want to keep and 

 which they can jettison. England have at times adopted vindictive, 

 bitter sledging, as if bad manners alone made you a better 

 cricketer. The fact is that purposeful banter is a symptom, 

 not a creator of confidence. Without the confidence it is 

 bluster that fools no one.

 But the second Test was played 

 in a notably gentlemanly fashion, barring the odd bit of 

 over excitement. One of the great sporting moments came 

 when Andrew Flintoffs first thought in victory was 

 to console Brett Lee, the devastated Australia batsman.

 The tone of this series, it seems, 

 has been set by Flintoff: uncompromising on the field, positively 

 busting with self-confidence, but devoid of hatred and bitterness. 

 He is, you must say, Australian ma non troppo. He 

 has taken the best things Australia have brought to cricket 

 and made them his own.

 As for the Australia cricket team, 

 they are not as greatly loved in their country as you might 

 expect. Many Australians were hoping for a tight series, 

 rather than the usual canter.

 The team has responded to this 

 by becoming less grudging. One or two of them, Adam Gilchrist 

 in particular, have taken to walking when edging a ball 

 to the wicketkeeper, instead of waiting to see if the umpire 

 noticed.

 This had become a practice as 

 rare as the purple-crowned Fairy-wren of Australia. But 

 Australia, filled to satiation on mere victory, have brought 

 it back from the brink.

 During the past decade, Australia 

 have made cricket more intense than ever but have restored 

 at least some of sports traditional decencies. These 

 are decencies traditionally associated with ? if no longer 

 much practised by ? England and they make sport a more rewarding 

 spectacle.

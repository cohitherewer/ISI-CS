 Wanted to deliver under pressure: Laxman

 - My batting has improved a lot, says humble Pathan 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 V.V.S. Laxman after reaching his century in Ahmedabad on Monday 

Ahmedabad: V.V.S. Laxman is ready to bat at any position. Despite considerable success at No. 3 ?? be it that historic 281 at Eden Gardens or the ninth hundred achieved at Motera on Monday ?? he had been relegated to No. 6 in the order. Rahul Dravids illness provided him the opportunity to be back at his favourite No.3 here. 

As far as slots are concerned, I dont mind batting anywhere in the middle-order, Laxman said. I have always maintained that I am ready to bat at any position in the middle-order where the team wants me to. No.3 has been very good for me since I have batted there from my schooldays. Luckily, I got a hundred at a crucial stage. Numbers dont really matter. 

The superb 104 has left him satisfied. I am extremely pleased with this knock. There was a lot of pressure, and the situation demanded that I play a long innings. It was a sort of sheet anchor role, something that I always wanted to do. I wanted to deliver under pressure, and I am delighted I did that today. 

Laxman felt batting was comparatively easier on the second morning. Yesterday, there was a lot of moisture on the surface and the ball was gripping and turning. Today, the management decided to use the heavy roller, which brings the moisture out and dries up the surface. The ball was coming on nicely, but once the effect of the roller wore off, the ball started to grip and bounce like on the first day. 

The Hyderabad batsman said it was important for the Indians not to relax at this stage. We need to clean up the tail and put pressure on them. 

Irfan Pathans batting, with whom he shared a record 125-run stand for the seventh wicket, has been impressive. Irfan batted really well. He is stroking the ball well. I have seen him grow as an international cricketer, I have seen how much hard work he has put in. If you can have guys coming in at No. 8 and contributing, it puts pressure on the opposition. Irfan needs to be congratulated for the hard work, said Pathan. 

Pathan enjoyed both his knocks in Delhi and at the Motera. I enjoyed both the knocks? though they came in different situations. In Delhi, we had lost the first wicket cheaply, and I had to play my shots. Here, we were in a more difficult situation, which demanded that to be a bit more positive too. II enjoyed this innings a little more because we were under more pressure. 

Pathan doesnt rue missing a hundred a second time. It would have been great if I had got a hundred, but thats how it is? Most importantly, both my knocks were very important for the team, and thats what has been satisfying. I am performing regularly and scoring more than usual. I wont say I batted like a batsman today, but my batting has improved a lot, and that is good for the team. 

Laxman, however, did not forget to mention Mahendra Singh Dhonis contribution. Dhonis was a very important knock. It was essential that he comes out to bat positively.

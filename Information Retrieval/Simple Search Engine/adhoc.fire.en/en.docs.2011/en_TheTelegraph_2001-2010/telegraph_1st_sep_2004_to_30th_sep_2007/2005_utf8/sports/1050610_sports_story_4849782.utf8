 3 Pak pacers likely to train in Chennai

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board is planning to send three promising fast bowlers to India for a stint at the MRF Pace Foundation. 

The matter of sending bowlers to train in India has been discussed in the PCB brass meeting and most of the PCB officials including the selectors favoured the idea of sending the bowlers to the academy, a PCB official said in a local daily. 

There is no doubt that when it comes to talent, Pakistan pacers are much higher placed than that of India. However, what they need is proper coaching and guidance from a renowned coach and expert in the field. 

If we consider this aspect then there is no better place around than the academy in India, the official said. 

The training in Chennai would be cheaper when compared to the Australian academy. Training three or four fast bowlers at the Australian academy and looking after all their expenditure would definitely cost very high. 

However, the training expenditure at the foundation would be cheaper in comparison, the official said. 

The official declined to divulge the name of the players who would be sent to India for training under Dennis Lillee. 

Those who are knocking at the doors of Test cricket or played one or two Tests and are improving day by day would be sent for training.

Shoaib fails date with PCB doctor

- Pak can edge out hosts, says Imran; Majid bets on India 

 Shoaib?s absence might further anger PCB officials 

Islamabad: Pakistan?s controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar failed to appear before a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)-appointed doctor, who examined the fitness of three other bowlers ahead of the tour of India. 

Sports physician Meesaq Rizvi, who has been included in the PCB medical commission as a visiting member, had on Thursday called Shoaib and three other bowlers ? Mohammed Sami, Shabbir Ahmed and Mohammed Khalil ? for fitness tests. Shoaib is suffering from a hamstring injury and his non-appearance might further anger the PCB officials. 

He, however, appeared before the inquiry committee Thursday to explain his position about the charges levelled on him by the PCB, a report in a local daily said. 

Shoaib?s personal doctor Tauseef Razzaq, who had examined the bowler soon after he came back from Australia owing to fitness problems, had reportedly said the paceman needed four weeks to recover, making his availability for the India tour doubtful. 

However, Sami, who was suffering from a heel injury had been given a fitness certificate. Shabbir needed three more weeks to be fully ready for international cricket. 

Meanwhile, former cricket great Imran Khan on Friday said Pakistani fast bowlers could edge out India in the forthcoming series. 

?Pakistan must depend on pace, because it?s pace which can earn them a win in India, not spin. The world?s best spinner Shane Warne has been a failure there,? the former Pakistan captain said. ?I would like to see Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami firing on all cylinders,? Imran said. 

Former captain and Imran?s first cousin, Majid Khan, however, touted India as the clear favourites in the forthcoming Test and one-day series, saying while the hosts had proven match winners, years of selectorial apathy had left Pakistan unprepared for one of the toughest tours. 

?For the last four years, we have not been able to prepare a team that can consistently win matches... I am afraid, Pakistan?s chances don?t seem to be bright,? Majid said on Friday, adds another report from Karachi. ?On the contrary, India have proven match-winners. I mean they have bowlers who can take 20 wickets in a match,? he said. (AGENCIES)

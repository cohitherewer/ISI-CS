 PCB extends Inzy contract 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) rewarded skipper Inzamam-ul Haq and vice-captain Younis Khan for their team?s fine performance in India by extending their tenure for another year. 

?The PCB has decided to extend the terms of Inzamam-ul Haq as Pakistan captain and Younis Khan as vice-captain for another year,? a PCB spokesman said after the conclusion of the ad-hoc committee meeting of the board in Islamabad. 

The PCB also decided to retain Saleem Altaf as the manager of the team for next month?s tour of the West Indies while the selection committee of Wasim Bari was given the mandate to announce the 16-man squad for the series. 

?The Pakistan cricket team for the the West Indies tour will be announced next Monday and the selection committee of Bari has been directed to select the squad in consultation with the captain,? a PCB spokesman added. 

Inzamam was earlier appointed captain till the West Indies tour while Younis had taken over from Yousuf Youhana for the Indian tour. 

The extensions mean that the two would be at the helm of affairs when India tour Pakistan early next year. 

?The PCB wants continuity and believes that Inzamam has matured as a captain. He is making a good combination with Younis and Bob Woolmer. As we set our sights on the 2007 World Cup, we take every decision in that spirit,? the spokesman said. 

Inzamam was pleased with the announcement and said the move would give a boost to his confidence. 

?It?s a good news. The PCB wanted continuity and I also wanted the same. So, it?s a win-win situation for both,? the 35-year-old said. 

?Captaincy is a big challenge and I am grateful to the pcb who have kept faith in me. I am still learning the art and any support and assistance I get from the board will surely increase my confidence,? Inzamam said from Lahore.

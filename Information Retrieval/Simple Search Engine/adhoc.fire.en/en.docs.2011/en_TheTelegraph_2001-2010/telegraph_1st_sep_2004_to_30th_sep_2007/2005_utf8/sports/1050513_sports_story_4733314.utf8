 Coach isnt a magician: Gavaskar

Bhopal: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar Thursday said that the performance of a team did not depend on the coach but on the players themselves. 

A coach cannot perform magic. He is not a magician. Performance depends on every team member, Gavaskar, one of the six members in the committee formed by the BCCI to appoint a coach for the Indian team, said. 

Former Australian Test players Greg Chappell and Tom Moody besides former Indian cricketers Mohinder Amarnath and Sandeep Patil have been shortlisted for the post left vacant by John Wright of New Zealand. 

On the outgoing coach, Gavaskar said Wright was a good man. 

On lack of consistent performance by Indian team, Gavaskar said teams like Australia play with a different temperament. There is a stiff competition among players to gain foothold in the team. They dont relax, unlike their Indian counterparts who tend to become complacent, he said. 

He lashed out at the media for allegedly adopting double standards on Sourav Ganguly. A month ago, the media wanted him (Sourav) out. Now the media is questioning his exclusion, he said, adding a bad patch comes in everybodys carreer. 

Stating that Sachin Tendulkars bad form was temporary, Gavaskar said the Indian team was nowadays playing under less pressure with players like Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid among others, contributing well. 

Stating that the tour of the West Indies in 2006 would be a shot in the arm for the Indian team, the cricket legend said the players would get the opportunity to familiarise with the weather conditions, wicket and players, which would assist greatly in their World Cup campaign in 2007. (PTI)

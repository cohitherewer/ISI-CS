Melbourne: Twice former champion Jennifer Capriati has withdrawn from next week?s Australian Open because of an injury to her right shoulder, organisers said on Wednesday. 

The American, winner at Melbourne Park in 2001 and 2002, had previously pulled out of this week?s Sydney International, having earlier been forced to miss an exhibition tie with Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova on December 17. 

The news is a major blow to Australian Open organisers, who were already without injured Belgians Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters, last year?s champion and runner-up. 

 The year?s first Grand Slam starts 

 Monday. 

 Johansson doubtful 

 Meanwhile, in Sydney, Joachim Johansson faces an anxious wait before learning if he will be fit for next week?s Australian Open after a hamstring injury forced him out of the Sydney International on Wednesday. 

The big-serving Swede was trailing Max Mirnyi of Belarus 1-4 when he had to retire from their second round match, leaving Australia?s Lleyton Hewitt as the clear favourite to win the tournament. 

Hewitt eased his way into the quarter-finals with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Frenchman Arnaud Clement. 

Third seed Johansson told a news conference he had initially pulled the muscle in his first round win over Briton Greg Rusedski on Tuesday and did not want to risk further damage against Mirnyi. 

?I tried to go out there for a few games but I felt I couldn?t give 100 percent, and at this level there?s no way you can win,? he said. ?If it had felt good I would have kept playing but obviously it doesn?t so that?s why I stopped.? (Reuters)

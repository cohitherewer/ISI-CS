 U-19 side to play in 5-nation meet 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Indian under-19 boys will have a hectic schedule ahead of their under-19 World Cup assignments in February. 

India will feature in a five-nation Afro-Asian Cup meet in Visakhapatnam, instead of the previously-planned quadrangular meet (involving the Asian outfits solely). 

Apart from the hosts, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe will take part in the competition. The dates of the meet are yet to be finalised, since this will be done in consultation with the participating nations. South Africa, it has been learnt, have made themselves unavailable for the meet. 

Prior to the Afro-Asian meet, the Indian juniors will play five limited overs matches against Australia in late September. Indians will get an opportunity to play the Aussies before the World Cup, a BCCI official said. 

Decisions were ratified in the BCCIs working committee meeting held in New Delhi.

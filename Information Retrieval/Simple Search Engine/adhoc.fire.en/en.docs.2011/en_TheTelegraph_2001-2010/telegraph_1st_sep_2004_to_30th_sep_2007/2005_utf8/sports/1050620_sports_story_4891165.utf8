 Luciano gives Pekerman striking options

Nuremberg: Argentina coach Jose Pekerman believes he has discovered a new attacking jewel in Luciano Figueroa. 

The Villarreal striker scored a hattrick in the 4-2 win over Australia on Saturday, a result that confirmed Argentinas place in the semis. 

If they win their showdown with hosts Germany on Tuesday they will top the group and avoid the prospect of facing arch-rivals Brazil, who are favourites to win group B. 

Figueroa, who also scored twice in Argentinas World Cup qualifying win against Bolivia in March, is now a serious challenger to Hernan Crespo and Carlos Tevez. 

Im very, very happy with the way he played, said Pekerman of Figueroa, who once played for English club Birmingham City. Hes an excellent player. He has the character and precision thats required. Hes very fast. 

That wasnt always as apparent in earlier matches. Luciano had a very good match and that will obviously be considered in our decision-making. 

Figueroa said he was delighted to be given his chance. Its a beautiful thing for me to be among those getting a try-out, he said. It was a super opportunity for me. 

Pekerman, however, defended his teams display against Australia, saying he was delighted with the way they stayed composed after squandering a big lead. Im very satisfied because our team had a good match, with a very good performance, Pekerman said. There were some wonderful developments and we were very efficient, scoring four goals, he added. 

Being efficient in front of the goal is very important because you can be better but not score goals. The lead was getting smaller at the end but the final result was quite nice and very satisfying. 

Its not always possible to keep up the same high level throughout the match and our opponents had excellent players, he said. They were wearing us down physically. But we didnt rest. We did what was possible and scored another goal at the end. (Reuters)

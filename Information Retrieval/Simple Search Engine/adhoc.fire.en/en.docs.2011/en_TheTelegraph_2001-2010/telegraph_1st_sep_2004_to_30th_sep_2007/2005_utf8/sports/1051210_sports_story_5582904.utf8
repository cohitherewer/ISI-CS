 Captaincy issue...

In pressing circumstances, my feeling is that the selectors would have offered the job to Sachin, the senior-most around. Had he declined, then alone somebody else could come into the picture, the source pointed out. 

More hasnt been favourably disposed towards Sourav and it would surprise if the selectors thought of him unanimously. 

Kumble, one assumes, would have been the favourite for what really is a stop-gap role. 

For the record, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah simply said: Dravid is playing and, so, the question of a new captain doesnt arise? If both the captain and vice-captain werent available, then a tele-conference between the selectors would settle the captaincy. 

Adding that just five minutes would have been needed to sort things out, Shah indicated the BCCI brass wouldnt have got involved in something so touchy.

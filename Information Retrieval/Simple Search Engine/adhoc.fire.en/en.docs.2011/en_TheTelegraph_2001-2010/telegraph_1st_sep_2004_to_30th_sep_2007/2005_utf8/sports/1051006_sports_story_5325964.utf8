 Cole injury rocks Erikssons plans

 - For England not to reach the World Cup would be a disaster

 Ashley Cole 

What was already a tense and testing week for Sven-Goran Eriksson grew in complexity on Tuesday when he lost Ashley Cole to a stress fracture in his right foot ? a significant blow, given the magnitude of the forthcoming matches, the lack of an established deputy and the fact that Gary Neville is missing at right back. 

As the England squad gathered in Manchester before what Eriksson described as huge, extremely important World Cup qualifiers against Austria and Poland, the head coach was considering whether to pick Kieran Richardson, Phil Neville or Jamie Carragher as a replacement for Cole, whom he rates as the best left back in the world. 

Eriksson must have been harbouring serious concerns about the other flank, where Luke Young looked shaky during the 1-0 defeat by Northern Ireland last month. Phil Neville or Carragher would be far more reliable, even though neither plays regularly at full back in the Barclays Premiership. 

Richardson, who has impressed in defence for Manchester United, would be the bold choice to fill in for Cole, who will be sidelined for a month. Stephen Warnock, the uncapped Liverpool defender, has been drafted in as cover. 

Eriksson can call on most of his first XI for two matches that England must win to be sure of automatic qualification for next summers finals in Germany, but he will be deprived of the suspended Wayne Rooney for the first match, against Austria on Saturday. He must also wait until Thursday at the earliest to greet David Beckham, his captain, who has stayed in Madrid because his middle son, Romeo, is unwell. 

The three-year-old was kept in hospital on Tuesday night for tests after suffering a third bout of convulsions and Beckham asked to stay with his family. He is scheduled to fly to England this afternoon and start training on Thursday. Michael Owens continued recovery from a dead leg will also prevent him from joining a full practice session until Thursday. 

Eriksson needs Beckham and Owen to be available because he already has enough selection issues. The absence of both senior full backs is unwelcome, but the Swede has a surfeit of quality centre halves. 

Finally we have the problem which we talked about for a long time, Eriksson said, referring to the availability of Rio Ferdinand, John Terry and Sol Campbell. On form, Terry has to be regarded as the most secure. Ferdinand should be concerned, given his sloppy performances, but the suspicion is that he will survive the axe. 

Thats a big decision I have to make, but I am here to do that job, quot; Eriksson said. He claimed that Ferdinand was playing well, which was met with raised eyebrows. Campbell has played only five matches since returning from injury, which may prove a convenient excuse for leaving him out. 

They are not decisions that Eriksson can afford to get wrong. Although England have the safety net of the play-offs, they will be anxious to avoid that lottery. We are playing for a ticket to the World Cup and that is not a little thing, Eriksson said. For England not to reach the World Cup would be a disaster.

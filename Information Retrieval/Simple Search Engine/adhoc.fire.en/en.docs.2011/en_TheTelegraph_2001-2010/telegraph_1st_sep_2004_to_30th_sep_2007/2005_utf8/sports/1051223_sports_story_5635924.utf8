Calcutta: Sanjeev Mehra pulled off a remarkable win over the higher rated Jaskeerat Dullet in the last 16 stage of the Goodricke East India Amateur Golf Championship at the RCGC course on Thursday. 

Mehra, whose strokeplay was not so impressive, went on to show that he is a good matchplayer, as he got past Dullet, who has been one of the most promising names on the Royal Challenge Amateur circuit. 

While top seed Gaganjeet Bhullar had easy sailing into the quarter finals, Simarjeet Singh got the better of L. Selvadurai 3 and 2 to make the last eight. The manner in which matchplay can ambush the best of players, was displayed here as quite a few top players either fell on the wayside, or were stretched. 

Manav Das could not live up to his rating, and went down to Vikram Rana 4 and 2. Shaurya Singh showed the exit door to Chirag Kumar, winning 3 and 2. 

Among the other winners were defending champion Joseph Chakola, who overcame Akshay Butta on the 19th hole, while Gagan Verma, fresh from his wins in the IGU event, beat Manav Jaini. Himmat Rai, just back from a coaching stint in the US, beat Ranjit Singh 2-up. 

The quarterfinals on Friday pitch Bhullar against Chakola. Verma will meet Mehra, while Simarjeet plays Rana. The last quarterfinal will see Shaurya facing Himmat.

 Vieira close to leaving for Juventus

OLIVER KAY and GARY JACOB 

One annual transfer saga concluded this week when Steven Gerrard decided to stay at Liverpool, where he may soon be joined by Luis Figo, but that other summer soap opera, the one in which Patrick Vieira comes within a whisker of leaving Arsenal, took an unexpected twist Thursday when it emerged that the London club had entered negotiations to sell their long-serving captain to Juventus. 

Arsenal supporters will reassure themselves that they have heard it before about Vieira, who has delighted them by turning down Real Madrid at the last moment in each of the past two summers, but this time it seems that a parting of the ways may be the preferred option for all concerned. 

Arsenal are understood to have entertained a delegation from Juventus on Wednesday night and Thursday afternoon, with the Italian club being told that an offer of ?18 million will be enough to secure the 29-year-olds services. 

Juventus are believed to have made an opening offer of about ?8 million plus Stephen Appiah, the Ghana midfield player, who is the subject of strong interest from Middlesbrough. 

That bid holds no appeal for Arsenal, who are demanding a significantly higher cash sum. If a make-weight were required, their preference would be for a player such as Jonathan Zebina, the French defender, rather than Appiah. 

Arsene Wenger, the manager, has identified Mahamadou Diarra, of Lyons, as the most suitable replacement if Vieira is sold. 

Even if negotiations go no farther, it is clear that, having entertained and haggled with Roberto Bettaga and Luciano Moggi, respectively vice-president and director-general of the Italian club, Arsenal will consider selling Vieira. 

The captain was not at his most influential last season and may be sacrificed as Wenger seeks to reshape his team with younger midfield players such as Francesc Fabregas and Mathieu Flamini. 

A new centre forward is also a requirement, with the club still confident of signing Julio Baptista, the prolific Brazil striker, from Seville, as his hopes of joining Real Madrid appear to be ill-founded. 

Vieiras thoughts on a move to Italy are unclear, given that he has previously said he would not return to Serie A after encountering racism during an unhappy spell with AC Milan at the start of his career. But he is understood to have shown little enthusiasm for the prospect of signing an extension to his contract at Highbury, which expires in 2007, and may be tempted by the likely offer of a four-year contract with Juventus.

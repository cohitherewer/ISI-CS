The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tirkey will be missed

Stickwork

 Gurbux Singh

 Tirkeys experience cant be 

 compensated

The news of Dilip Tirkey missing 

 the Champions Trophy due to illness is a huge setback for 

 India. He was not only the captain, but the seniormost player 

 in the squad.

 The fact that the India defender 

 had to pull out at the eleventh hour will affect the team 

 psychologically. Its no excuse, but most of the players 

 in the Indian squad are young. Tirkeys experience 

 cannot be compensated.

 Im saying this because I 

 strongly believe the Champions Trophy is the toughest tournament 

 in the world of hockey. Its tougher than the World 

 Cup and the Olympics, because you have to be on your toes 

 from the very beginning.

 Just look at the line-up: there 

 will be Olympic champions Australia, World Cup champions 

 Germany, Champions Trophy holders Spain, The Netherlands, 

 Pakistan and India.

 In other tournaments, the build-up 

 to peak form comes slowly and you have time to regroup. 

 But in the Champions Trophy, you must be bang on target 

 from the first game if you have high aspirations.

 As per the revised fixtures, India 

 play Spain and Pakistan on the first two days (Saturday 

 and Sunday). The pressure is bound to be immense on the 

 home team from the word go.

 I would be satisfied if our team 

 finishes among the top-four. But as we are hosting the championship, 

 we should strive to find a place on the podium.

 Like India, Pakistan would also 

 have been dealt a body blow had they lost captain Mohammad 

 Saqlain for the first part of the meet. He was slapped a 

 three-match suspension, but had it overturned by the FIH 

 jury, and so now can play from the start.

 Saqlain is such a fine player 

 and I find it difficult to comprehend how he gets into trouble 

 in almost every tournament. He has to keep his cool because 

 in his absence, the team will suffer the most.

 India will find Pakistan tough 

 to crack as the latter are coming off a tournament triumph 

 (RaboBank meet in Amstelveen).

 In my book, though, Spain will 

 be the team worth watching. They are also in a building 

 stage like India, but out of all European teams today, Spain 

 are the most improved side and brimming with confidence.

 Much of the credit must go to 

 their Dutch coach Maurits Hendricks. They are the ones in 

 Europe, besides The Netherlands, who try to play enterprising 

 and open attacking hockey, and results are showing. They 

 have not only been the Champions Trophy winners but are 

 also the reigning the European champions.

 Germany, as always, will be a 

 compact defensive side like their football outfit. Unfortunately, 

 I have never appreciated the type of hockey Germany play. 

 They rely on methodical defence and attack, with an over-dependence 

 on penalty corners.

 The powerhouse of world hockey 

 for the last 10-15 years have been The Netherlands. I believe 

 they have kept world hockey in fine shape, its worth 

 going miles to watch them peform.

 Australia, on the other hand, 

 have kept the style of the Dhyan Chand era still in mind. 

 They still follow the 2-3-5 system, when even the subcontinent 

 teams have adapted to modern methods for better results. 

 I must add here that the teams here have not been consistent 

 in the international arena due to paucity of top-class players 

 in defence and forwardline.

 Coming back to Pakistan, its 

 interesting to note that they have not fallen back on two 

 previous captains Sohail Abbas and Mohammad Wasim, and instead, 

 kept faith on young penalty corner specialists like Imran 

 Warsi and Mohammad Imran.

 Its difficult to find the 

 favourites in a meet of such supreme quality, and so, Im 

 not venturing into predicting the champions.

 However, I hope India have a satisfactory 

 outing and once again have a good game against Pakistan.

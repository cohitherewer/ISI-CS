 More women in Warne closet

London: Australias ace leg-spinner Shane Warne, who has just separated from wife Simone, has been caught cheating with yet another woman when he was also trying to save his marriage, a London tabloid claimed on Tuesday. 

Warne had sex with Kerrie Collimore, 31, on the bonnet of his BMW and sent her raunchy text messages even as he tried to save his marriage, the tabloid reported. 

The 35-year-old assured the blonde that he had separated from his wife during his two-month fling. A friend found 48 messages from Warne on Kerries phone. 

Warne, father of Brooke, Jackson, and Summer, split last weekend from Simone after ten years of marriage. 

The last straw came when student Laura Sayers, 25, claimed the cricketer begged her to have sex with him in a London hotel. 

Warne, who is lying low in Spain, could not be contacted. His manager Michael Cohen reportedly said: We have no comment to make.

 Karun, Armaan to drive for India

 Karun Chandhok

New Delhi: Come September, and motorsports lovers will be treated to a new genre of car racing ? the A-1 Grand Prix ? which will pit drivers against drivers and country against country, unlike Formula One. 

Billed as the World Cup of Motorsport, the Grand Prix, set to flag off on September 25 in England, will bring together 25 nations, including India, to compete on a level-playing field. 

India will be represented in the race by two young drivers, Karun Chandhok and Armaan Ebrahim, team manager Akbar Ebrahim said here Saturday. Akbar Ebrahim hinted that talks were on with Narain Karthikeyan on joining the Indian team, but a report from Budapest quoted Narain as refuting it. I am certainly focused on F1 racing only and not on other racing disciplines, Narain has said. 

The best thing about the A-1 Grand Prix, he said, was that it would provide a level-playing field to all the drivers who will use same engines and similar tyres in the races. 

Each country will have two drivers but in the main race only one will participate. 

There will be a qualifying on Saturday that will determine the positions for Sundays one-lap race which in turn will decide the grid positions for Sundays race, Akbar Ebrahim said. 

The teams can field separate drivers in the qualifying as well as in the one-lap race, but the points earned will be recorded against the name of the country. 

There will be 15 races in a season with none of them clashing with the dates of the F-1 races, the organisers said adding the first one will be held on September while the 15th and final race will be held in Beijing in April. 

There will be $ 1 million as prize money to be split among the top ten finishers with the winner claiming ten points and the tenth place holder one point. Drivers will need international B licence to run in the race, and those with F-1 super licence will obviously be also eligible.

 Pierce faces Mauresmo in all-French title clash

Los Angeles: The WTA Championships final will be an all-French affair for the first time in history. 

Mary Pierce of France shocked top-ranked Lindsay Davenport 7-6, 7-6 to reach the final on Saturday and was joined by compatriot Amelie Mauresmo, who took down defending champion Maria Sharapova 7-6, 6-3. 

Its the second final-round appearance for both players, but neither has come through a winner. Pierce reached the final in 1997 before falling to Jana Novotna, while Mauresmo made it to the final two years ago before going down to Kim Clljsters. 

Sharapova appeared to be on her way to her second straight final in the first set when she raced out to a 5-2 lead, but the veteran Frenchwoman began to mix up her attack and confused the 18-year-old, who couldnt contend with Mauresmos high bouncing topspin or deft low slices. 

Towards the end of the set, Sharapovas right pectoral muscle injury began acting up again and she was never the same after that. 

In a high quality match in which both players brought out their best form, Pierce racked up 40 winners, with only 10 unforced errors, to eliminate the American. 

During her fourth straight victory at the Championships, Pierce served amazingly well, making 70 percent of her first serves while blasting 10 aces. 

Both women raised their level of play in the second set, when there were no breaks of serve forcing another tie-break. 

But the 30-year-old Pierce, who has reached the French and US Open finals this year, was again the more cool-headed and ambitious player, registering five winners.

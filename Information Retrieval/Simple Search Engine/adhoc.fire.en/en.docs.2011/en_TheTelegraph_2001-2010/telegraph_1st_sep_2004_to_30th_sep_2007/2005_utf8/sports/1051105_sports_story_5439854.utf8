Brisbane: Glenn McGrath gave the new generation of West Indies pacemen a lesson in accuracy to put Australia in complete control of the first Test on Day II on Friday. 

McGrath ripped through the tourists batting with a perfect display of line and length bowling, leaving them struggling at 182 for six in reply to Australias 435. 

Shane Warne and Brett Lee also captured a wicket each after making identical scores of 47 as Australias lower order piled on the runs. 

The only West Indian batsman to offer any sustained resistance was diminutive opener Devon Smith, who scored a courageous 88 despite being thumped on the helmet when he ducked into a vicious bouncer from Lee. 

The 24-year-old left-hander sank to his knees and was treated by the team doctor but recovered to bat for more than four hours and register his second highest test score. 

Smith was eventually dismissed in the last half hour of play, shouldering arms to McGrath who finished the day with figures of four for 58 from 18 overs. 

Warne and Lee had also put on 75 for the eighth wicket, while Bracken kept the tail wagging with an adventurous 37 in the rain-delayed morning session. They were aided by some wayward West Indian pace that conceded 46 extras, including 22 no-balls and six wides.

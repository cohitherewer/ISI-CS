 Form favours Rasalas 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Rasalas is all set to lift the 1,400m Calcutta Colts Trial Stakes on Wednesday. The Storm Trooper-Ruddles son has been showing consistent improvement since carrying his topweight victory in the 1,600m Grand Annual Handicap last winter.

 Old timers still believe that the mile race points to the Classic potential of a horse and not many three-year-olds can boast of winning the race with a heavy impost of 60-kg. B.Prakash partners the Daniel David-trained prized horse.

 Rasalas main rival in the three-horse field is Vijay Singhs Raging Tide. The winter form of the Brave Hunter-Loud Water son has been impressive, though each time he beat the likes of Imperial Dynastys, Pay Checks and Quintets. His recent victory over High Chief being a belaboured one, it leaves him to show much improvement to beat a form horse like Rasalas.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

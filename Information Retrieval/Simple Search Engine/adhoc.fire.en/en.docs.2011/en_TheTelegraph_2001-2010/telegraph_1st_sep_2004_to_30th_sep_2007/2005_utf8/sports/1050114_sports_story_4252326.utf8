 Memorable NFL debut by Fransa

Margao: A brace by Sebastiao Endro guided Fransa FC to a 2-0 win over Vasco in the opening round of the ninth ONGC National Football League (NFL), at Nehru Stadium here Thursday. 

Fransa, palying their first maiden senior division NFL, took the lead in the 38th minute. Medio Jules Dias played a ball from the centre to Endro, who got the better of rival defender and took a shot from the top of the box that beat custodian Rogerio Ramos. 

The goal boosted Fransa?s morale as they dictated terms in the second half and increased the lead in the injury time when Endro, accepting a pass from the middle, essayed a shot that was deflected in by defender Thapa. 

Endro was declared Man of the Match. 

Mahindra United will take on Churchill Brothers in their opening NFL match at the Cooperage, Mumbai on Friday.

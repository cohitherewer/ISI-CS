 Davydenko injury hits Russian plans

Moscow: Russia could be without two top players for this weeks Davis Cup quarter-final against France with Nikolay Davydenko possibly joining injured Marat Safin on the sidelines. 

Well wait until Thursdays draw to decide who is going to play, Russia captain Shamil Tarpishchev told a news conference on Tuesday. 

The 2002 champions, who had already lost Australian Open champion Safin with a knee injury, could also be without Davydenko, who is nursing a painful wrist injury. 

The French Open semi-finalist, however, said he would be fit for the tie on clay at Moscows Olympic Stadium. 

Ill be ready to play come Friday and unlike Wimbledon, Ill finish the match no matter what. I can promise you that, said Davydenko, who retired injured from his second-round match against Swedens Jonas Bjorkman at Wimbledon last month. 

But Russias world No. 7, who also retired from his opening match at last weeks Gstaad Open with the same problem, would not disclose the details of his injury. 

No, I wont go into the specifics, he said. All I can say is that it is being treated on a daily basis. I was told that I dont have any ligament damage. Its just an inflammation of a joint, so I should be okay for Friday. 

If Davydenko is unable to play, Tarpishchev would have to look to Mikhail Youzhny to reproduce his 2002 heroics. 

Then, Youzhny came from two sets down to beat Paul-Henri Mathieu in the deciding fifth rubber in Paris to clinch Russias first Davis Cup title. 

France captain Guy Forget, who is looking to rising teenage talent Richard Gasquet to spearhead the French challenge, refused to accept that the injuries gave his team the edge. 

I dont think you can call us favourites, he said. With Marat in the team, Russia are one of the best teams in the world but even without him, theyre still an unbelievable team, no question about it. 

We have a young, ambitious team, added Forget. If we play good quality tennis, then we have a chance. 

The tie will be the first meeting between the two nations since Russias victory in the 2002 final at Bercy.

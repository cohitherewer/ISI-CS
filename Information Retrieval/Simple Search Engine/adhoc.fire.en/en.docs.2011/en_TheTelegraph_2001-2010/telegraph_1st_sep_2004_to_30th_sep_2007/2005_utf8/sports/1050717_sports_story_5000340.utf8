 BALCO key figures in plea bargain

San Francisco: The key figures charged with distributing steroids from the BALCO lab in a scandal that damaged the reputations of top athletes agreed on Friday to plea deals that will result in little or no time in jail. 

The pleas in US federal court could spare some of the worlds top athletes the embarrassment of possible subpoenas or revelations had the case gone to trial in September. It is not known whether prosecutors, in securing the pleas, gained information vital for other steroid cases. 

BALCO owner Victor Conte admitted to one count of conspiracy to distribute steroids and a money laundering count. Other charges will be dropped. Under the agreement the gregarious former bass guitar player turned nutritionist faces four months in prison and another four months home confinement. 

I agreed with others to distribute steroids between December 1, 2001, and December 1, 2003, while I was the president of BALCO, Conte, 55, told Judge Susan Illston. I knew at the time steroid distribution was an unlawful activity. 

Greg Anderson, 39, personal trainer to baseball slugger Barry Bonds, told the court he had distributed steroids to athletes he did not name and admitted to laundering money. 

He could end up serving up to six months in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for October. (Reuters)

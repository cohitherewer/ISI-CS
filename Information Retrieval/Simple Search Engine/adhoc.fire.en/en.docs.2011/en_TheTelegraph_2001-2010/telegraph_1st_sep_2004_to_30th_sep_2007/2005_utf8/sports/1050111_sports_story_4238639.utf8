 Doshi for ?early? use of technology

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India left-arm spinner Dilip Doshi feels that technology should be used at the early phase of one?s career as it will help the cricketer to learn properly. ?If we make use of the technology when a cricketer is in his learning phase, it will yield results,? Doshi said, when he suddenly turned up at the Eden on the eve Bengal-Jharkhand national one-dayer on Monday. 

Reverting back to Bengal cricket, Doshi, who has taken 114 wickets in 33 Test matches, felt there is something seriously wrong in the structure of local cricket and that?s why Bengal has been struggling in the national scene. ?Though I don?t stay here and it is not fair for me to comment, I still believe that we are going wrong somewhere, as a result of which we are suffering,? he opined. 

Calcutta University winning the Rohinton Baria Gold Cup has pleased him a lot. ?I was in the team when we won it 37 years ago, it?s a nice feeling to know that we have won it again,? he said.

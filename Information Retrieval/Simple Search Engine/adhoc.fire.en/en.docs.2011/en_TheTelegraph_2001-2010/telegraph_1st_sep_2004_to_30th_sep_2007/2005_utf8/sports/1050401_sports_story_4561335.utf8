Important to know where off stump is

Cricket Online 

Ravi Shastri

I am a right-handed batsman. Often I fail to 

judge an outswinger and get caught behind. Why does this happen?

(Siddhartha Bhattacharjee, 14, Durgapur)

Work on your footwork. Keep a still head, watch the 

ball and don?t go hard at it. It?s important to know where your off stump is.

I am a left-handed batsman and very weak on 

the off side against spinners. Please help.

(Mahesh Kumar, 22, Murshidabad)

Check your grip with your coach. The problem may lie 

there.

I am a right-handed batsman. I often fail to 

perform in matches, though at nets I remain impressive. Please help.

(Jubin Gupta, 19, Darjeeling)

Take your time in the middle. Work on your concentration 

by talking to yourself. You need one big score and you will be on your way.

I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try 

to play the square cut I get caught at point, gully or deep cover. Please help.

(Anshu Sharma, 16, Kharagpur)

Get into the right position to play the shot and ensure 

that you roll your wrists at the time of impact. Your body weight should also 

go into the shot.

I am a right-handed batsman and would like to 

know the right way to play the square cut. Also, please advise on the selection 

of the ball for executing this stroke.

(Utsav Tiwary, 14, Dhanbad)

You got to get back and across using the depth of 

the crease so that you have more time. The ball has to be short and wide. You 

need to have the room to free your arms. Ensure you roll your wrists at the time 

of contact as that will help you keep the ball on the ground.

What is the difference between a medium pacer 

and a fast bowler?

(Srijit Dutta, 16, Calcutta-15)

A medium pacer bowls at 75 to 80 miles per hour. A 

fast bowler is 90 and upwards.

I am a medium pacer. How does one bowl the slower 

delivery? (Arnab Bhattacharya, 16, Calcutta-64)

Spread your fingers a bit and roll your fingers across 

the seam at the time of delivery.

I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try 

to pull a short ball, I end up being hit wicket. Please help.

(Mainak Mukherjee, 12, Jamshedpur)

Get your balance at the crease right. Check your guard 

as well. Make sure the ball is short enough to give you time to go back and across. 

Don?t hurry into the shot.

I am a right-handed batsman. I often get caught 

at backward short leg or get bowled against a leg-spinner. Please help.

(Arnab Roy, 12, Calcutta-60)

Wait for the ball and don?t push at it with hard hands.

I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try 

to defend a spinner, I get caught at silly point. Why does this happen?

(Rajib Dutta, 18, Calcutta-16)

Pick the right line and don?t keep your bat behind 

the pads. Meet the ball with the bat just in front of the pads.

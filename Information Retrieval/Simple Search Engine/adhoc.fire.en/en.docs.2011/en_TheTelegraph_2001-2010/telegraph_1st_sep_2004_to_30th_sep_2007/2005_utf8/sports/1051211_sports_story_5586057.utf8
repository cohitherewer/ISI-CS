 Exciting draw for Asian nations

Tokyo: The World Cup draw threw up some enticing encounters for Asia-Pacific nations, with newcomers Australia and Asian champions Japan drawn in the same group as holders Brazil. 

South Korea, semi-finalists four years ago, have an easier ride, in a group that pits them against Switzerland and Togo but also 1998 winners France. 

Saudi Arabia Will play perennial underachievers Spain, and also Ukraine and African champions Tunisia, while Asias other representative, Iran, has its work cut out against seeded side Mexico, Portugal and debutants Angola. 

Japan and Australia, who also play Croatia, begin group f action with a clash against each other in Kaiserslautern on June 12, but it is the prospect of meeting five-time champions Brazil that has mouths watering in Asia. 

Perhaps Japan and Croatia have other ideas, but realistically we are looking for the spot behind Brazil, said Australias coach Guus Hiddink, who has helped spark huge interest in football in Australia. 

They are the favourites and the toughest draw we could have had, added the Dutchman, who steered South Korea to the last four in 2002. Australia are competing at their first World Cup finals since 1974. 

Japan, recently voted Asias team of the year by the Asian Football Confederation, are more of an unknown entity for Hiddink, but he is not underestimating them. 

For Japans Brazilian coach Zico, who took over from Frenchman Philippe Troussier after 2002, being drawn against his home country is a dream come true, and he is ready for the challenge.

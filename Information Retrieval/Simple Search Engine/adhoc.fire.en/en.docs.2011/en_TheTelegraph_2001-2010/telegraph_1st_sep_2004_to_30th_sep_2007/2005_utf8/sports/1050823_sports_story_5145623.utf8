 Mongia steers Leicester to 5-wkt win

London: Dinesh Mongia slammed an unbeaten 92 off 93 balls and also snared two wickets to guide Leicestershire to a five-wicket victory over Sussex in a Totesport National League division II match on Sunday. 

Chasing 187 for victory against the league leaders at Grace Road, Leicestershire lost the wickets of Darren Robinson, Darren Maddy and Hylton Ackerman early on but the Indian batsman steered his side to the target with seven balls to spare. 

Mongia had his share of luck though when he was dropped by Murray Goodwin at point off Robin Martin-Jenkins when he was on 42. Leicestershire were floundering on 111 for five at that time. 

These were welcome runs for Mongia who had scored just one run in his last three innings in the competition. 

He was ably supported by Paul Nixon, who scored 26 not out and shared an unbroken stand of 88 with the Indian batsman. 

Sussex have also risen to the top of the County Championship this week. (PTI)

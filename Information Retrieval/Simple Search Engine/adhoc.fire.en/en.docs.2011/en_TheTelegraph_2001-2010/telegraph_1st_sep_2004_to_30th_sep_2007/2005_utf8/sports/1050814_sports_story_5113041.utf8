 Kumble, Laxman out of ODIs

 - UPs Rudra Pratap Singh gets maiden call-up 

 Mumbai: The national selectors Saturday wielded the axe on ageing non-performers in limited-overs games like Anil Kumble and VVS Laxman, and laid emphasis on youth while naming the 15-member squad for the upcoming triangular series in Zimbabwe. 

The selection panel, headed by Kiran More, which met here on Saturday along with national coach Greg Chappell and captain Sourav Ganguly, also omitted mediumpacers Lakshmipathy Balaji and Zaheer Khan for the event beginning August 24. 

But all four players, who were members of the ODI squad to Sri Lanka recently, were included in the team for the two-Test series to follow from September 13 against Zimbabwe along with Sachin Tendulkar, subject to his becoming fit by that time, wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik and opener Gautam Gambhir. 

Laying emphasis on fit and young players, the selectors included Uttar Pradeshs 19-year-old left-arm pace bowler Rudra Pratap Singh in the one-day squad to take on New Zealand and hosts Zimbabwe while retaining two other young batsmen who toured Lanka ? UPs Suresh Raina and Andhras Venugopal Rao. 

Right-arm pacer Ajit Agarkar and left-arm spinner Murali Kartik were recalled to the one-day squad after missing the series in Lanka. 

Ajit Agarkar returns to the ODI side. 

Announcing the two teams, BCCI secretary S K Nair said that Tendulkar, recuperating after undergoing an elbow surgery in May last in London, is progressing well. 

Tendulkar is expected to be fit by the middle of September. His fitness would be assessed before the tri-series final (September 6) and in case hes found not fit to play, a replacement would be named. 

Nair said that Pathan, who suffered a shoulder injury in the tri-series final against Lanka last Tuesday, is undergoing treatment and, according to Gloster, should be fit in time for the tri-series in Zimbabwe. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Harbhajan likely to be let off

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Indias most successful off-spinner, Harbhajan Singh, is likely to get away with his outburst against Greg Chappell, but the Board is clear that any lack of action wont be precedent-setting. 

Far from it. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the gag-order is, for now, good enough and punishment could see more unpleasantness. 

The coach, though, may have an entirely different view ? his patch-up with Sourav Ganguly notwithstanding. 

Its unclear whether Sourav (the outbursts beneficiary) pleaded Harbhajans case when he met the Board mandarins in Mumbai on Tuesday, but he did have a session with the offie. 

Apparently, the captain spent at least 20 minutes with him at a hotel near the airport. 

Harbhajan, whose career got revived in the Sourav-John Wright era, was in Mumbai for a commercial shoot.

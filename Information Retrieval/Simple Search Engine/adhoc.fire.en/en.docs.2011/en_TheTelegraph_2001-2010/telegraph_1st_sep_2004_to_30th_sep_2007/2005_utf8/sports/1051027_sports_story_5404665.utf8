The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tendulkar showed hes still the 

 best in business

Straight Talk 

 Arjuna Ranatunga

 The return of Sachin Tendulkar 

 reconfirmed what I have always believed to be the difference 

 between great and merely good cricketers. A good cricketer 

 would take time to find his bearing after a long lay-off 

 while a great one would slip into his cast as if he had 

 never ventured out of it. On the basis of what I saw in 

 the first one-dayer in Nagpur, Sachin is still the very 

 best in the business.

 Sachins riposte to speculation 

 on his future has been nothing less than stunning. He lashed 

 out on the offside, executed those pick up strokes which 

 had all but disappeared from his repertoire and made Muttiah 

 Muralidharan appear mortal. His all-out aggression, the 

 sprint between the wicket left even his younger colleagues 

 breathless.

 However, more than Sachin, I think 

 it was Irfan Pathan who took the game away from the Sri 

 Lankans. Some poor tactics by the visitors also helped him. 

 It was frustrating to see an orthodox 

 leg-spinner bowl his stuff to a left-hander who had specifically 

 been sent to go hell after the leather. You speak to acknowledged 

 left-handers such as Brian Lara and Sourav Ganguly and they 

 would admit their preference to see a leggie dish up his 

 stuff. Pathan took an instant liking to such an offering 

 and the momentum irrevocably shifted away from the visitors.

 In my view, Sri Lankans have not 

 played this bad for a long time. There was hardly any stand-out 

 feature, be it in batting, bowling or fielding. You dont 

 come to a party after eight years and be cavalier about 

 it. Reverses such as this can ring in your ears for long. 

 In next two weeks, we will come to know the character of 

 Atapattus men.

 The old bogey of being poor travellers 

 would raise its head again. In recent times, we have truly 

 believed in the intrinsic value of this side which is not 

 subject to the conditions in which they are playing. 

 They have risen to number two 

 in world rankings on merit and better things looked in store. 

 Now the old doubts will resurface again.

 I wonder if playing against the 

 West Indies or Bangladesh injected a false sense of belief 

 in this side. They could also have been fooled by the new 

 look Indian team whose mentor had been out in cold for six 

 months and doubts were freely in the air if his best was 

 not already behind him.

 Dravid showed how well he knows his game

Rahul Dravid provided a stirring 

 finish to the innings but it must be said he could not have 

 found a better platform. One of the noticeable aspects about 

 his batting is the way he shifts gears. He nearly always 

 is dependent on ones and twos at the start of his innings 

 and nearly always provides a great flourish in the end. 

 It shows how well Dravid knows 

 his game and how confident he is with his methods. He climaxed 

 his innings with nearly every shot in the book ? lofted 

 strokes over the infield, ferocious pulls and square drives 

 backing away towards the leg-stump. 

 One sweep off Vaas from the middle 

 stump defied belief.

 His captaincy too conveyed a man 

 who had come well prepared to the middle. He brought on 

 his spinners at the precise moment and his field placements 

 were thoughtful. It also appeared to me that the team backed 

 him to the hilt. He made a great statement of intent and 

 India seem ready to leap into the arms of future.

 I just hope the momentum has not 

 shifted away from the Sri Lankans at right angles. They 

 would need to put their indifference aside and think deep 

 and hard about the matches ahead.

 I sincerely feel the openers need 

 to be tinkered with since it has been an ordinary association 

 between the two of late. I would love to be proved wrong 

 but Sri Lanka can ill afford to start on the wrong foot 

 and then play a catch-up game for the remainder of the series.

 Recovery for them has to be made 

 on all counts and the support bowling staff to Chaminda 

 Vaas and Murali need to show their fangs quickly. Fervez 

 Mahroof and Dilhara Fernando need to pull their weight and 

 push Indians on the backfoot.

 Before the game started, there 

 was more than a mild query about the quality of the Indian 

 middle-order. There would still be some now but largely 

 on positive note as the likes of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Jai 

 Prakash Yadav, Y. Venugopal Rao hardly got to bat enough 

 in the centre. When Ganguly and Mohammad Kaif return, there 

 would be options in excess.

 It is a good situation to be in 

 for the firm of Dravid and Chappell.

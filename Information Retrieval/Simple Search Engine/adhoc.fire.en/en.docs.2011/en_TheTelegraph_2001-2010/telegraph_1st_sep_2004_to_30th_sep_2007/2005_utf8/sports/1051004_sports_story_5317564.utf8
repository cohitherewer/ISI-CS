 Anand faces an uphill task

 - WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 

San Luis: World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand has an uphill task on hand if he has to keep pace with Bulgarian Veselin Topalov in the World Chess Championship. 

The Indian ace suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of defending champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan in the fourth round and now stands third in the $1 million tournament, behind Topalov and Russian Peter Svidler. 

Topalov has already collected 3.5 points out of a possible four and Svidler is half a point behind. 

Anand was in joint lead before the fourth round and the loss proved costly as he remained on 2.5 points. 

However, with 10 rounds to go in the eight-player double round robin meet, not much has been lost for Anand if he can get back to winning ways. 

Topalov has been the man of the championship so far with three sparkling victories and a draw with Anand, but the Bulgarians high-risk style can get him into trouble against anyone here. 

Leaving aside the loss to Kasimdzhanov, Anand must have reason to be pleased. 

Starting off with a brilliant victory against Judit Polgar of Hungary, Anand had showcased his defensive skills to hold Topalov from a lost position in the second round. In the third game, Michael Adams of England was subjected to a whirlwind attack leading to convincing victory.

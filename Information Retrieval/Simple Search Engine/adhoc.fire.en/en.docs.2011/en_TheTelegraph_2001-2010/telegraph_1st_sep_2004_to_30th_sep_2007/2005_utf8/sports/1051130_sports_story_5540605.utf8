 Romantic Liaison was a cut above rest 

 STAR RACER

 Romantic Liaison was a cut above the rest in the fillies Classic on Sunday. The Vijay Singh-trainee was, however, lucky that she was up against very mediocre rivals who were about two classes inferior to her. Therefore, the racing adage that Class and Classic horses complement each other was the ideal billing she got in the betting ring where she received enormous support even at crammed odds of quarter-money.

 Jockey C. Alford did not need to do anything special on the Razeen-Veenas Pet daughter. He had her settled behind Clockwork, a stablemate, till 600m from home before kicking clear of the field to fight it out for minor placings.

 Another horse, Aperitivo, charmed his way to victory in the 1,400m Mayfowl Cup to suggest champions are made of sterner stuff. The all round weight disadvantage was no handicap for the last winters Derby winner as he went on to prove a point that he is almost number one in the business not only in the city racing but also in the country.

 Formal Invitation, who, at the level terms had finished a respectable second to Aperitivo in the Derby, was again reduced to a non-entity despite his 9kg pull.

 Earlier in the day, Vijay had the satisfaction of seeing Aristotle coming good against Rasalas, albeit at 7kg pull at the weights in the 1,600m Burning Fire Cup. However, long winning verdict was a comfort zone for the sparingly raced colt eyeing the 2000 Guineas next month.

 Aristotles emphatic victory followed last weeks bad news when Vijays Aleksei bled from nostrils signalling the end of his campaign for the shorter classic.

 Vijay-Alford, however, started their day on a wrong foot when Watergate, a heavily fancied two-year-old debutant, surrendered his winnings to her stablemate Elusive Glow. The Brave Hunter-Loud Water was up with the field after a slow start and appeared to be cruising until Alford took the victory for granted and stopped riding out the favourite.

 Apprentice Mark seized this opportunity on Elusive Glow, and thus the defeat, though Alford tried to re-alert Watergate in vain.

 Mark revealed his opportunistic nature again atop Robin Corners Aptitude who stole a march, at the top of the turn, over speedsters like Zephyr, Thoughtful and Common Spirit in the 1,200m Altimara Handicap.

 Daniel David saddled a brace of winner and ? both Sky Bullet and Proud native won their respective events with authority.

 Earlier on November 24, the Darius Byramji-trained Artura had also stamped his authority over nine rivals in the Aphroze Cup. The Steinbeck-Wandering Star son, is also a live Deepak Khaitan-contender for the December 10 Guineas.

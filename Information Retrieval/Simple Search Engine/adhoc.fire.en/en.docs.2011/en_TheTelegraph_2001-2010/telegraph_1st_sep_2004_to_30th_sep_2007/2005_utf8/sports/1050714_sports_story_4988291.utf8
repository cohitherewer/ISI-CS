 Gilchrist takes a dig at critics

London: Adam Gilchrist, having pulverised Englands attack on Tuesday, could not resist turning on Australias critics with equal relish after the world champions eight-wicket victory gave them a 2-1 ODI series win over their hosts ahead of next weeks first Ashes Test. 

The wicketkeepers commanding 121 not out, at better than a run a ball, saw his side cruise at The Oval with more than 15 overs to spare. 

But the real damage was done by Australias bowlers, who earlier reduced England to 93 for six. 

Following their seven-wicket win at Lords on Sunday, this result suggested Australia ? who had an uncertain start to their tour with a shock defeat against Bangladesh followed by two losses against England ? were hitting form at just the right time as they aimed for a ninth successive Ashes series win. 

That was very special for a lot of reasons ? getting the job done for the team and my first one-day hundred for quite a while, Gilchrist said. 

Australias start to their tour inevitably led to some mocking copy in the British press. But Man-of-the-Match Gilchrist, who faced 101 balls and hit two sixes, 17 fours in his 11th one-day International century but first in over a year, said victory had been a vindication of Australias resolve. 

We had a slow start and we have copped it on and off the field, with stories made up about us, handbags put on our hands and people laughing at us, the vice-captain added. 

It takes character to make sure all that is irrelevant and that we are focusing on our cricket ? and we have done that. 

Captain Ricky Ponting, named Man-of-the-Series following his century at Lords and a fluent 43 at The Oval, said: Thats very satisfying ? the result of a lot of hard work and talking about our games and where we were going wrong. 

These last two games have been pretty comprehensive wins for us. Today was as close as it gets to perfect for one-day cricket for us ? to restrict them like we did early on and then be able to peel those runs off with some 16 overs to go. It is a very, very big win. 

A couple of weeks ago, or a couple of days ago it didnt look too bright for us. 

England captain Michael Vaughan insisted the result would have no bearing on the Ashes. 

On Thursday we won at Headingley, and everyone was saying the momentum was with England. I didnt believe that either and I dont believe now the momentum has swung with Australia. 

One-day cricket is a totally different concept, and history suggests it has no impact on the five-day game.

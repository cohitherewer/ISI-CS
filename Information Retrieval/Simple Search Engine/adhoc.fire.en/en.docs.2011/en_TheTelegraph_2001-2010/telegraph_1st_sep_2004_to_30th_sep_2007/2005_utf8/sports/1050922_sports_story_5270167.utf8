 Inzamam may replace Sachin

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Wednesday opted out of the Super Series between Australia and World XI under instructions from Dr Anant Joshi. He is likely to be replaced by Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq. 

Dr Joshi, who has been supervising the rehabilitation programme, has advised that Sachin should participate in at least one domestic game to evaluate his recovery before participating in competitive cricket. 

Therefore Sachin has opted out of the Super Series, a media release from BCCI executive secretary Ratnakar Shetty said here on Wednesday. 

Sachin had been included in the 13-strong Test squad and the 14-man ODI squad. 

Inzamam, who has played 101 Tests and 347 one-day Internationals, confirmed his availability for the matches Down Under on Wednesday. 

I have just been told by the board to give my confirmation for the Super Series, Inzamam said. I am available to play because it is a big honour to play alongside the worlds best. 

Vote for Aussies 

Meanwhile, in an interview to an Australian magazine, Sachin said he does not think the world champions are on a decline following their Ashes humiliation and says they would remain a superpower even when their top players retire. 

Australia are the best team in the world. Theyve been playing at a different level for almost two decades now, he said. 

You just have to see the way they express themselves on the field. Theyre very passionate and very aggressive. he said. (Agencies)

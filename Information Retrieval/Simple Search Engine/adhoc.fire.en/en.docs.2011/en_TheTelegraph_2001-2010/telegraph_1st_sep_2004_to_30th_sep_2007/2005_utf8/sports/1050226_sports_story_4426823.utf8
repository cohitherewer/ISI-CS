The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We didn?t play badly, says Subrata

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Another loss, another round of abuses hurled at the coach-players-officials, some missile-throwing, a couple of lathicharges outside the stadium, a few fans getting injured. It?s become a routine affair involving Mohun Bagan?s matches and Friday was no different. 

With the fans in a militant mood, the Mohun Bagan contingent opted to stay back in the dressing-room for over an hour before leaving the stadium in the team bus. A police picket was posted at the Mohun Bagan tent till late evening. 

The mandatory post-match conference was delayed as the coach had a tough time controlling tempers in the dressing-room . 

Subrata Bhattacharya had a simple explanation for the team?s fourth defeat in nine NFL matches. ?We didn?t play badly. We created many chances but couldn?t score? A coach can only teach his wards how to create openings, he can?t score the goals himself,? said a remarkably unflustered Bhattacharya. 

?The players are feeling the pressure playing at home? I think we?ll do better in the away games,? he argued.

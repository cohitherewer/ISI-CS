 Surface to play a key role: Wilander

New Delhi: Swedish captain Mats Wilander said on Saturday the nature of the grass courts would be a key factor in the upcoming Davis Cup tie against India. 

Wilander, an eight-time Grand Slam champion and world No. 1 of the 1980s, said while the doubles rubber would be crucial, the singles matches would be dictated by how his players adjusted to the surface. 

Singles would depend on how good the courts are. With grass, it is really difficult to make a good court in one week. Even Wimbledon will not be able to do that. It is going to dictate the style of play, Wilander said. 

(Thomas) Johansson (Swedens No. 1 singles player) does not serve and volley. At Wimbledon, he was playing mostly from the baseline, the visiting captain added. 

The discussion on surface assumes significance in the light of heavy rain that have lashed the city for four days, forcing the AITA to prepare a new court at the R. K. Khanna Stadium. (PTI)

 Madrid: Real Madrid denied media reports on Monday they had been trying to arrange an exchange deal between Ronaldo and Inter Milan striker Adriano.

 ?In the light of the reports about a possible deal involving Ronaldo and Adriano, Real Madrid would like to reiterate that they will not listen to any offer nor will they negotiate the sale of Ronaldo,? read a statement on the club?s website.

 ?The club would like to make it absolutely clear that neither the president (Florentino Perez) nor any representative of the club will consider an offer for the Real Madrid player.? 

 London: Fulham lost their bitter legal battle with ex-manager Jean Tigana at London?s Court of Appeal on Tuesday.

 The court dismissed the Premier League club?s appeal against a landmark High Court ruling that left them facing a damages payout of at least ? 2 million ($3.48 million) to Frenchman Tigana.

 Last November Fulham, whose chairman is Mohamed Al Fayed, lost its High Court claim for damages against Tigana, whom it had accused of overpaying millions of pounds for two signings. Tigana won a counter-claim that he was contractually entitled to payments and share options worth over ? 2.1m. 

 Tokyo: Argentine Osvaldo Ardiles has been fired as coach of Tokyo Verdy following a string of humiliating results, the Japanese club said on Tuesday.

 The 52-year-old took charge in June 2003 and led the club to the 2004 Emperor?s Cup title, but the once-mighty Verdy have failed to mount a serious challenge for the J-League championship.

 The two-time champions were crushed 0-6 at Jubilo Iwata at the weekend, extending their winless streak to nine games. Verdy have conceded 23 goals in their last five games.

 Sydney: Australian cyclist Amy Gillett was killed and five other members of the Australian women?s road cycling team were badly hurt when they were hit by a car while training in Germany, officials said on Tuesday.

 Gillett, a former Olympic rower, was killed when a car struck the six riders near the town of Zeulenroda, about 80 km south of Leipzig on Monday.

 The injured cyclists were named as Katie Brown, Lorian Graham, Kate Nichols, Louise Yaxley and Alexis Rhodes.

 ?It is with deep regret that the Australian Sports Commission and Cycling Australia confirm that Australian road cyclist, Amy Gillett, has been killed and five of her team mates seriously injured in a tragic accident in Germany,? the two sports bodies said in a joint statement.

 Gillett was a member of Australia?s World Cup and Commonwealth Games teams and took up competitive cycling in 2000 after she rowed for Australia at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where she was a member of the eight that finished fifth.

 Federer plays dream-wrecker

 - Hes the best Ive ever played against, SAYS ANDRE Agassi

It was one of Andre Agassis finest performances in a US Open final, and it was the latest unmistakable sign of Roger Federers tennis greatness that Agassi still lost in four sets on Sunday. 

The match was an inter-generational tussle and contrast in styles between Federer, the flowing 24-year-old from Switzerland who is dominating the sport, and Agassi, the 35-year-old father of two from Las Vegas who remains, despite his fragile back, the games strongest personality. 

As the shiny-domed, tightly wound Agassi race-walked along the baseline between points in his familiar pigeon-toed fashion with his fans shouting encouragement at him on a first-name basis, Federers body language was much quieter as he languidly shook his hair out of his eyes and picked at his strings. But once the ball was smacked into play, each was in a spectacular hurry to break down the others defenses. 

The top-seeded Federer did not play his best in this 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (1), 6-1 victory, but he played close enough to his best in the critical phases of the third and fourth sets to win his second consecutive US Open and run his record in Grand Slam finals to 6-0. 

It is disappointing to lose, but the first thing you have to assess is why you did lose, and I just lost to a guy whos better, Agassi said. Hes the best Ive ever played against. 

Agassi, the oldest mens finalist at the US Open in 31 years, had experienced something similar here as a younger man: giving his all and finding himself with the runner-ups silverware against a clutch-serving opponent with a beauty of a running forehand. 

Federer has moved seamlessly into the larger-than-life space left behind by Pete Sampras, Agassis now-retired rival, who beat him here in the final in 2002. And at 24, Federer is going places with his smooth-moving game that Sampras never managed to reach. 

Pete was great, Agassi said. But there was a place to get to with Pete. You knew what you had to do. If you do it, it could be on your terms. Theres no such place like that with Roger. 

Agassi speaks from plenty of hard-won, or better put, hard-lost experience. This defeat was his eighth straight against Federer, and though it was considerably closer than his three lopsided losses earlier this year, he was fortunate to win a game in the final set. 

Federer is well aware of his special powers, and though he generally does an effective job of negotiating the delicate line between honesty and diplomacy, it is becoming difficult for him to avoid the obvious. He has now won his last 23 finals, something no other man has done in the 37-year Open era. He is the first in the Open era to win Wimbledon and the US Open back to back in consecutive years. He also reached the semi-finals at the other two Grand Slam events this year, the Australian Open and the French Open. 

Ive always looked much more up to Sampras than to Agassi, Federer said. Didnt pay much attention to Agassi, but thank God he was around longer so I got to know him better: for his results, for him as a person. Now I enjoy playing as much against him like when I did against Pete. 

Over the years, and there have been 20 of them now at the Open, Agassi has often been tight-lipped and caustic in defeat. But there was no trace of bitterness in his voice after this Grand Slam final. 

He arrived here with a suspect back, But he fought his way through a draw that opened up nicely for him and reached the final by beating three unseeded yet dangerous shotmakers in a row in five sets: Xavier Malisse, James Blake and Robby Ginepri. But Federer is the most dangerous shotmaker. 

He was ready for the battle, but I think wed be kidding ourselves if we totally ignored the fact that its a 35-year-old body, Gil Reyes, Agassis fitness coach, said. 

Still, 35 has its advantages. Old enough to appreciate the significance of this latest run, Agassi walked on the court before each match savouring the atmosphere, making eye contact with fans, some of whom with memories good enough to recall his long-haired, quick-tempered younger years, when he did now-unimaginable things like spitting on the chair umpire Wayne McKewen. 

But the ambivalence about him has evolved into genuine warmth, and as Agassis name was announced during the warm-up with Federer, most of the 24,797 fans in attendance stood and applauded. 

Over the last 20 years Ive come full circle, Agassi said. Its been an amazing journey and discovery of each other as Ive grown up out here. And to be here at an age where I can take in that sort of love and be at an age where I can embrace it is a tremendous feeling. 

To Agassis credit, this match was not defined by nostalgia. It brimmed with low-trajectory, high-velocity winners, timely first serves and lunging defense. With Agassi leading by 4-2 in the third set, it was beginning to seem possible that he would win a third singles title here. 

But in the next game, Federer accelerated at 30-30 and produced consecutive winners to break Agassis serve. Federer won his next service game at love to get back to 4-4. Though Agassi managed to save four break points on his serve at 5-5, they were soon in a tie-breaker. 

Agassi won the opening point with a backhand drop shot, but on the next point he missed a forehand return off a high-bouncing second serve. Federer reeled off the next six points, taking a two-sets-to-one lead. 

It had happened so quickly that the crowd needed more time to realise that its favourite had lost control of his destiny. Agassi postponed the inevitable at 0-5 in the fourth set by saving two match points and holding serve. But in the final game, Federer held at love, finishing off the victory with a kick serve that Agassi returned long with the two-handed backhand that had played a vital role in his eight major titles. 

It remains to be seen whether Agassi will play in another major. He has had three cortisone injections in the last eight months to calm the lower-back pain caused by an inflamed sciatic nerve. He was the oldest man in the singles draw here and the oldest finalist in any Grand Slam event since Ken Rosewall reached the final here in 1974 at age 39. But Agassi made it clear that he would like to continue playing next season. As of now, my intention is to keep doing what it is I do, he said. You know, the only thing better than the last 20 years will be the last 21 years.

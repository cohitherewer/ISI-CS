 Aussies next up for India

Chennai: Bolstered by their stunning come-from-behind win against Pakistan, India would be keen to perform even better and keep the momentum going against a formidable Australian side in the Champions Trophy hockey tournament here on Tuesday. 

The dramatic 3-2 win on Sunday over Pakistan, who led 2-0 until the 60th minute, signals that India may have finally got their combination right in this elite six-nation tournament. 

However, Australia, already leading the table with a maximum six points from two matches with wins over holders Spain and Germany, are a different customer as they play a combination of both Asian and European hockey. 

Hence, the hosts would have to overcome their weakness in first time finishes and defence if they are to stop the Olympic champions from registering another rout. 

The failure of the frontline, spearheaded by captain Gagan Ajit Singh, the top Indian scorer in the history of the championship with nine goals in his two appearances, should be a cause for worry.

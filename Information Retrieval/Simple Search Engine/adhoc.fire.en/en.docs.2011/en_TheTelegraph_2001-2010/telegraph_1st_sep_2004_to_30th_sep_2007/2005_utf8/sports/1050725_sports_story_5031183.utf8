 McGrath, Warne and four ducks

 - Aussies romp home with 239-run win 

 McGrath, who scalped four, at Lords on Sunday 

London: Glenn McGrath took four wickets for three runs and nine victims in the match as Australia crushed England by 239 runs in the first Ashes Test at Lords on Sunday. 

Englands only realistic hope of avoiding defeat, having limped to 156 for five on the third evening with 420 needed for victory, lay with the weather and their prayers were answered as Sundays first two sessions were washed out. 

When the fourth day finally got underway with 42 overs left to play, the home side collapsed to 180 all out without a fight. Englands last five wickets tumbled for 22 runs in just under eight overs. 

McGrath, who claimed five wickets for two runs in an extraordinary spell in the first innings to pass 500 Test wickets, took four for 29 to complete match figures of nine for 82. Shane Warne took four for 64 in the second innings. 

The last four batsmen, Ashley Giles, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison and Simon Jones, all made ducks. Kevin Pietersen permitted English supporters a thin smile, completing his second half-century on his debut and finishing on an unbeaten 64. 

Ricky Ponting opted to open hostilities with McGrath at the Pavilion End and Warne from the Nursery. 

McGrath made the breakthrough in his second over. 

Geraint Jones, on six overnight, played an inexplicable shot. Two balls later it was 158 for seven as Giles drove off the backfoot and edged to Matthew Hayden at gully. It was all over when Jones slogged at McGrath and was caught by Warne at first slip.

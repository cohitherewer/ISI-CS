Bristol: Englands Steve Harmison took a career-best five-wicket haul and Kevin Pietersen blasted 91 not out as world champions Australia crashed to a second consecutive triangular series one-day defeat at Bristol on Sunday. 

The Australians, whose reverse against Bangladesh in Cardiff on Saturday was one of the greatest upsets in ODI history, produced a much-improved display but lost out by three wickets as Pietersens extraordinary knock sealed the win with 15 balls to spare. 

The South-African born Pietersen hammered his runs off 65 balls, including eight fours and four sixes. His last 52 runs came off 23 deliveries. 

Harmison seemed to have set up victory with five for 33 as Australia were restricted to 252 for nine after opting to bat but Glenn McGrath then led the fightback, taking two early wickets and strangling the England top-order. 

England needed seven an over off the last 15 to win and 76 runs off the last 10 as the wickets continued to tumble but Pietersen, in his first one-day innings against the world champions, and Vikram Solanki rattled through several gears to put on 54 for the seventh wicket in just five overs. Pietersen then hit 17 off the 46th over from Jason Gil-lespie to make certain of victory. 

Earlier, Harmison took five wickets in a ODI for the first time as England kept the pressure up on the world champions. Harmisons hau- surpassed his previous best of four for 22 against India at Lords last year, as England looked to build on their series-opening 10-wicket win vs Bangladesh at The Oval. 

Michael Husseys one-day International best 84 was the centrepiece of Australias total. 

Harmison sparked an Australia collapse to 63 for four before a stand of 105 in 118 balls between Michael Clarke (45) and Hussey revived their innings after captain Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. 

The 26-year-old Durham quick did early damage with a spell of four wickets for two runs in 15 legitimate balls. 

He began in the 12th over, his third, when he took three wickets for no runs in four balls. Adam Gilchrist went first, caught behind on 32, to leave Australia 57 for one. 

Next ball Ponting, whod been lbw for one against Bangladesh, went in similar fashion when once more looking to play across the line. 

Damien Martyn deliberately left the hattrick ball alone as it went past off stump. But he went for a two-ball nought when his uppercut shot off the fourth ball of the over flew straight to Kevin Pietersen at thirdman. 

Matthew Hayden had looked in good touch launching Jon Lewis, on his Gloucestershire home ground, for six and fiercely cutting Darren Gough off the front foot for four. 

England captain Michael Vaughan brought himself on for a rare bowl and at the other end introduced fellow part-time off-spinner Vikr-am Solanki for his first overs in a one-day International. 

Hussey should have been out for 59 when a square cut off Flintoff went through Collingwoods hands at backward point ? a far easier chance than the one hed held. 

Hussey eventually fell in sight of a hundred when he was yorked by Harmison having faced 83 balls with 11 fours. (AFP)

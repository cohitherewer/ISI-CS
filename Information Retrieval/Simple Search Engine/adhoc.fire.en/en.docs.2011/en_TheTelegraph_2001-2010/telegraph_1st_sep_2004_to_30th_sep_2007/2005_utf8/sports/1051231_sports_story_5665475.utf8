 8 GMs in unique field 

 - CPAI to celebrate first anniversary in the city today 

A CORRESPONDENT

 Dibyendu Barua, Abhijit Kunte, Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda, the key members of Chess Players Association of India 

Calcutta: The city is all set for a new chess record when eight Grandmasters will take on 300 players at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Saturday. The city, which has seen birth of highest number of Grandmasters in India, will again be the first one to witness tandem simultaneous exhibition of such a magnitude, to be organised by the Chess Players Association of India (CPAI) to mark its first anniversary. 

Six Grandmasters ? Surya Sekhar Ganguly, Sandipan Chanda, Abhijit Kunte, Dibyendu Barua, R.B. Ramesh and Tejas Bakre ? along with two Women Grandmasters Nisha Mohota and Swati Ghate, will play in tandem from 12 noon on Saturday. 

In a tandem simultaneous match each GM will make his move against a player and move on to the next board and so on. After some time the other GMs will follow and the process will continue. 

Explaining this to The Telegraph GM Abhijit Kunte, who arrived in the city on Friday, said: It will give all the players a unique opportunity to play against eight Grandmasters simultaneously. But it will make our task very difficult as each Grandmaster will have his own set of ideas and strategies. We will not only have to foresee our opponents plans, but also have to think what the previous GMs intention was. 

Perhaps, we should sit together before the match and chalk out our strategies, Kunte added with a smile. 

When asked why the CPAI chose the city as the venue, he said, Calcutta is the birthplace of CPAI and moreover, chess is very popular here and the people here are very keen followers of the game. It is also the city of our mens and womens national champions. 

National champion Surya Sekhar, who had recently set a record by playing a game against 700 players consulting together in Pune in September, was equally keen on Saturdays match. Our main intention is to take the game to the masses. This will be something new and interesting, he said. 

The CPAI president Dibyendu said: We want to give an opportunity to as many players as possible and can even exceed the number 300. Players of any age should come to the venue at least by 11.00 a.m. and register themselves.

 Sydney: Lleyton Hewitt found himself in court on Monday in an unusual dispute with his former best friend over aboriginal cultural rights. Andrew McLeod, an indigenous star player for the Australian Rules Football team in Adelaide, took the world No. 4 to court over a documentary film Hewitt hopes will show the world his softer side. The film included footage of Hewitt and McLeod visiting aboriginal sacred sites in Australia?s northern territory last year.

 McLeod later sought an injunction to block the marketing of the DVD, claiming Hewitt had not sought his permission before including culturally sensitive footage in his film.

 But when the pair arrived at Melbourne court on Monday, Hewitt and McLeod quickly closed themselves up with their lawyers and hammered out a settlement. The film is expected to be on store shelves before Christmas. 

 Athens: Greece coach Otto Rehhagel has agreed to stay on with the European Champions for another two years, a senior Greek FA official said on Monday.

 ?The two sides have agreed on a new deal until 2008 and the FA board has approved it,? the official said, ending weeks of speculation over the Germans future. Rehhagel took over an unfancied Greece side in 2001 and led them to a stunning European Championship victory in Portugal last year. His side, however, failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup finals after finishing fourth in their group last month.

 Rome: AC Milan captain Paolo Maldini has announced he intends to quit football at the end of next season. ?I?ll stop in 2007, when my current contract expires,? the 37-year-old defender was quoted as saying on Monday. He also revealed he had turned down a move to Real Madrid. ?Three years ago (Real Madrid president) Florentino Perez made me an offer, but I didn?t want to leave Milan,? he said.

 Frankfurt: Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn will consider extending his international career beyond next years World Cup.

 ?It?s not at all certain that I?ll call it quits after the World Cup,? the 36-year-old Kahn said in Kicker magazine on Monday.? I want to see how I feel. ?At the moment I?d like to play two more years in any case.?

 Kahn is battling it out with Arsenal?s Jens Lehmann for the right to keep goal for the hosts at the 2006 World Cup.

 Coach Juergen Klinsmann recently confirmed that he sees Kahn as the number one but he will not make a final decision on the goalkeeping position for the tournament until February.

 Kahn?s contract with Bayern Munich runs out at the end of the season. Bayern plan to discuss a possible extension over the mid-season break. 

 Bratislava: Slovakia coach Dusan Galis will be missing from the bench for the second leg of their World Cup playoff against Spain on Wednesday after receiving a one-match ban from Fifa, Slovak news agency TASR said on Monday. Galis was sent off in the first leg on Saturday for protesting against decisions to an assistant referee. Slovakia, whose hopes of qualifying for the World Cup were virtually ended by a 5-1 defeat, also had defender Marian Had sent off for protests.

 Princess triumphs 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The Ladies Derby, the 2,400m Calcutta Oaks, sponsored by Usha Stud farm, was an easy pick on Saturday for the much improved Daniel David-trained filly Supreme Princess.

 However, the Razeen-Eminence daughter was left to beat nothing of consequence following the withdrawal of Sanskara who would have tested her stamina to the fullest. Sanskara was unruly at the start.

 The mantle of challenging the half-money favourite, therefore, fell upon Ardennes shoulders who was hardly a match for the Princess prowess. Ardennes was learnt to have burst blood vessels during the race.

 Daniel, who saddled four winners, was in command from the start. He was ably assisted by visiting jockeys B. Prakash whos tally of three included the Oaks winner, and also Pacific Beauty, trained by Farley Rodrigues ? his first winner for MAM Ramaswamy in last six months.

 NZC: Tour of Zimbabwe on

Wellington: New Zealand crickets governing body said on Friday the planned tour to Zimbabwe in August will go ahead despite strong public and political opposition amid human rights abuses by president Robert Mugabes government. 

New Zealand Cricket (NZC) chief executive Martin Snedden said it was impossible for New Zealand to withdraw from the tour without being hit with a fine of at least $ 2m, as well as compensation for lost revenue. 

Its a fact of life we have no choice, we have to proceed with this tour. The fact is we have a contractual commitment to Zimbabwe cricket and to the other eight Test playing countries, Snedden told a news conference in Christchurch. 

He said he had discussed the tour with other members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) at the annual meeting earlier this week but it was clear its policy would not change. 

But New Zealand foreign minister Phil Goff said he accepted NZCs position. As Ive said on many occasions, they are between a rock and a hard place, Goff said. 

The government has indicated it is likely to refuse visas to Zimbabwe for a return tour to New Zealand scheduled in December. (Afp)

Paris: Roger Federer kept alive his dream of winning the French Open while Spanish teenager Rafael Nadal strongly suggested he could triumph at his first attempt on Wednesday. 

The two big favourites, playing at the same time, easily survived the second round and Nadal was arguably the more impressive. 

The gifted 18-year-old with the amazing forehand hit astonishing winners almost at will to brush aside Belgian Xavier Malisse 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 in under two hours, extending his winning streak on clay to 19 matches. 

The burly fourth seed, trying to become the first player to win the French Open on debut since Swede Mats Wilander in 1982, was never in trouble and delighted the crowd. 

World number one Federer, chasing the only Grand Slam to elude him, was never really threatened by Spanish baseliner Nicolas Almagro on his way to a 6-3, 7-6, 6-2 win. 

Swiss Federer, who could meet Nadal in the semi-finals, showed signs of nerves, notably when he was broken while serving for the second set. 

The versatile 23-year-old wasted no time in regaining control, however, taking the tiebreak 7-0. 

Almagro, who bowed out by hitting a forehand wide on the second match point after an hour and 47 minutes, never recovered. 

Nadal will be tested in the next round by fellow teenager Richard Gasquet of France, who pushed the Spaniard all the way in last months Monte Carlo semi-finals. 

The 18-year-old Gasquet, Frances best chance in the mens singles, thrilled his fans, serving superbly on his way to a 6-3, 7-6, 6-1 over Dutchman Peter Wessels. 

Obviously its going to be a complicated match, Nadal told reporters. Clearly hes in top shape, and its going to be his fans out there. 

It can be a positive or negative. Its also pressure, and youve got to overcome that pressure when youre playing in front of your own public. 

Im going to go out there and try to play my best tennis. 

Im sure I have a chance to win. Thats the only thing Im thinking of. 

If he plays better and wins, you know, thats it... Ill just go home. 

Tim Henmans dream of repeating his great 2004 run had earlier evaporated in the Paris sunshine when tough Peruvian baseliner Luis Horna beat him 7-5, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4. 

The British number one, who reached the semi-finals last year, found no answer to Hornas powerful baseline play. 

The usually cool Briton seemed distracted by the atmosphere and was warned by the umpire for swearing. He also appeared to be suffering from a recurrent back problem but insisted neither factor affected the outcome. 

Its disappointing but I feel he played better than me and deserved it, he said. 

The excited youngsters shrieking in the alleys around the courts on the traditional childrens day ? there is no school in France on Wednesday ? saw no major upsets. 

Top seed and world number one Lindsay Davenport survived a scare, clawing back from two points from defeat to beat Chinese teenager Peng Shuai 3-6, 7-6, 6-0. 

The 28-year-old American, rarely at ease in her least-favourite Grand Slam, looked leaden and ponderous on court one and was in deep trouble when Peng served for the match at 6-3, 5-4. 

I just didnt play that well, Davenport said. God, it was funny. Normally, you know, you have one aspect of your game that you dont feel is going that well. I really felt not that great about almost every part. 

The last two matches I felt have been not at a high standard for me and (at 5-4 down in the second set) I was just not thinking too much actually. 

The American added: She made a couple big errors. I finally got a little bit more focused in my game plan and strategy and was able to turn it around. 

Despite sporting a heavily strapped right knee, Kim Clijsters eased into the third round with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Slovakias Ludmila Cervanova. 

Clijsters, considered doubtful for the tournament because of sprained ligaments, moved effortlessly to record her third successive victory over Cervanova. 

A runner-up here in 2001 and 2003, the Belgian 14th seed next meets another Slovakian, Daniela Hantuchova, or Catalina Castano of Colombia. 

It was a memorable day for the local fans with not only Gasquet shining but also Mary Pierce, the 2000 champion, rolling back the years with a 6-1 6-0 demolition of Croatias Jelena Kostanic. (Reuters)

 Creditable show by Karun Chandhok

 Chandhok feels he is moving in right direction 

Chennai: India?s Karun Chandhok put up a creditable performance in his first two races in the World Series event, held in Zolder circuit in Belgium on Sunday. 

Forced to begin from the 22nd and 25th position in the starting grid due to a disappointing show during the Saturday qualifiers, the 21-year- old showed his grit to finally finish 12th and 11th. 

?To finish 11th after starting at the back is about as good as you can expect really and I passed more cars than anyone else. I am ashamed about my qualifying because of which I was not able to gain points,? Chandok said. ?Still, at least the speed has been encouraging and it shows that I am moving in the right direction,? Chandhok, who drives for RC Motorsport, said. 

Chandhok was on course for a top six position in the qualifiers but a bump at the 135 kmh chicane unsettled his car leading him to crash onto the wall before a record 52,000 spectators. 

In the opener, the Indian blasted from outside at the first turn to pass three cars and improved upon his position. After gaining speed once he passed Czech driver Tomas Kotska, Chandhok caught up with Eurointernational?s Italian driver Matteo Meneghello and finally lunged down the inside, forcing the Italian wide to finish 12th ? 10 places up from his starting position. 

?Karun has certainly shown very positive signs. I am looking forward to the rest of the year. He could become regulars in the points and perhaps get some podium finishes as the season goes on,? Chandhok?s team manager Francesco Rivera said in a press release on Tuesday. 

At the start of the warm-up lap in the second race, Chandhok encountered an electronic problem with the new Formula One spec gearbox which prevented him from selecting the gear and resulted in his starting at the back of the grid in 25th place. 

After a solid start, Chandhok was able to move to the 20th spot and disposed off pastor Maldonado and Milos Pavlovic and went after the Italian, Damien Pasini. Here a risky pre-race strategy planned by his team management making Chandhok stay out for longer than most of the other drivers before the mandatory pit stop paid off. 

The plan called for some fast laps in the middle of the race and the Indian driver put pressure on Pasini in front and passed him, setting himself up into a fast and consistent rhythm. This allowed Chandok to move up two more places after his pit stop. 

 However, his impressive progress was cut short with the race officials stopping the event early following a crash involving Chandhok?s team mate Giovanni Tedeschi and Meneghello. At this stage, Chandhok was in 11th spot after starting at the back. (Pti)

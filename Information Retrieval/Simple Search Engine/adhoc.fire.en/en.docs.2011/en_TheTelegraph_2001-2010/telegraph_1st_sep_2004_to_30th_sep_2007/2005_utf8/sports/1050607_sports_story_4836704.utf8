 Coe cites IOC report

London: Former gold medallist Sebastian Coe hailed a report from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday as proof that London is on course to win its bid to host the 2012 Games. 

Coe, chairman of Londons bidding committee, said that while the IOCs glowing write-up of Londons candidacy was not enough to bring the Games to the city, it would be a big help. 

It will act as a springboard for the next 30 days, he told a news conference, referring to the final month of campaigning before the IOC announces the name on July 6. (REUTERS)

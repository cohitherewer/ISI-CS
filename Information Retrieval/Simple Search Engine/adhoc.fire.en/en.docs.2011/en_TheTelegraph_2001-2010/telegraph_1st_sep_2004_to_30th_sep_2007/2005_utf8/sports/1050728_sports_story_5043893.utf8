 J-League stands by Verdy player

Tokyo: Japanese officials said on Wednesday that there was no way of proving that Tokyo Verdys Kazuyuki Toda spat at David Beckham in a pre-season game. 

Beckham was involved in a heated tunnel bust-up after accusing Toda of spitting in his face during Real Madrids match against the J-League club on Monday. 

The England captain and several of his Real teammates reacted furiously after Beckham clashed with Toda in the first half. 

Toda said spit flew but denied spitting directly at Beckham. 

The J-League contacted Verdy on Tuesday to verify the facts and were told that Toda continued to protest his innocence. 

It was not in the referees report or the match commissioners, J-League general secretary Kazuki Sasaki said. 

There is no video evidence so its a case of who said what at the moment. 

Sasaki promised that Toda would be summoned to explain himself if evidence was forthcoming. 

We will of course call him in to answer his case if that happens, said Sasaki. 

At this stage all we know is Beckham complained about being spat at but Verdy clarified that Toda said he didnt. 

After Mondays game Beckham fumed: He spat in my face. Its horrible. Our players saw it and werent happy. 

Real Madrid take on Jubilo Iwata in the second of two friendlies in Japan later on Wednesday before finishing their lucrative six-match pre-season tour with a game in Bangkok. 

Reals players have complained of fatigue after playing two games in the US and two in the Far East and Tuesdays training was cancelled as a result.

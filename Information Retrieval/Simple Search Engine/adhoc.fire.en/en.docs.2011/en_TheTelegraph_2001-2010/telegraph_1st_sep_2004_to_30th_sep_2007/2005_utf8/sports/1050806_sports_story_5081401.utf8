The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The doosra side of Harbhajan

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Colombo: Sanjay Manjrekar and Vinod Kambli havent been part of the Indian dressing room for years ? the former, in fact, retired in 1998 ? but its not that nobody in the current lot sings. 

After beating the West Indies in Dambulla, Harbhajan Singh did reasonable justice to rang barse. On Friday evening, at India House, he actually partnered Sri Lankan Army band crooner Nadeeka to sing an even older blockbuster ? chura liya. 

They did well and our high commissioner, Ms Nirupama Rao, led the applause. 

Harbhajan, who is a big fan of Jagjit Singh, showed no nerves. Back at the team hotel, he told The Telegraph: When Ive never been nervous bowling the first ball, whatever the situation, mike pe gaana koi badi baat nahin... 

Thats confidence.

Bangalore: Mediumpacer Ajit Agarkar is of the view that having a full time bowling coach could be of great help to the team. 

Pointing out that the presence of Bruce Reid during the teams tour of Australia two years ago helped them a lot, Agarkar said it was probably not a bad thing to have a bowling coach. 

The 27-year-old, who is here attending the pre-season pace bowlers camp, said: Reid being an Australian, it helped in those conditions. We havent had a full time bowling coach after that really. 

Its probably not a bad thing to have (a bowling coach), said Agarkar, who made his Test debut in 1998 against Zimbabwe. 

Because you never had a full-time bowling coach, its tough to say whether it helps or not. But in Australia, Bruce Reid being an Australian, was a help. 

The Mumbaikar is also not comfortable with the tag of all-rounder attached to him and makes no secret of it. 

I bat at No. 9. My primary job at the moment is to bowl. If I can contribute with the bat, its always good, added Agarkar, who has played 22 Tests and 135 ODIs. 

Being an all-rounder, you need to be consistent and try and win games for the team either with the bat or ball. That makes you an all-rounder. So every contribution with the ball is very important for me. I dont think I can be classified as an allrounder, said Agarkar, who has scored a century at Lords and has rattled up a half-century in just 21 balls against Zimbabwe. 

Agarkar said its good for the team that there were many fast bowlers who were vying for slots, adding, the competition was pretty healthy. 

Lot of guys are pushing each other; this will help the team. Its always going to be tough (to be in the team). You have to push yourself further, take up the challenge and perform better, he said. 

Agreed punjab fast bowler Gagandeep Singh, who is also part of the group of 15 fast bowlers attending the camp. 

New crop of fast bolwers are working hard; and its a tough competition. If ten bolwers are trying hard to get into the team, its for sure that India would get 4-5 good bowlers, he told reporters. 

Meanwhile, Haryanas nippy medium pacer Joginder Sharma, who made his odi debut last December during Indias tour of Bangladesh, said he is working hard to be in the team by positioning himself as an all-rounder.

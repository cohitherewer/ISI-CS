 Paris: Real Madrid midfielder Zinedine Zidane says he will be fit to play in France?s World Cup qualifier against Switzerland on October 8 after being sidelined for three weeks with a groin injury.

 ?I?m happy because barring a disaster I shall be able to play for France in Switzerland,? the France captain was quoted as saying by a sports daily on Tuesday. Zidane strained his groin during France?s 1-0 victory over Ireland on September 7 in a European Group IV qualifier. 

 France and Switzerland are joint leaders of the group with 16 points from eight games. Israel are third, one point adrift, but have played one more game. ?I had a light training session today (Monday). I ran, kicked the ball around and didn?t feel any pain,? Zidane said. 

 Madrid: Celta Vigo midfielder Everton Giovanella has been banned for two years for a positive drug test but the player is unlikely to serve the punishment immediately as his club is appealing against the decision.

 The Spanish Football Federation?s Competitions Committee followed the recommendation of judge Jose Luis Carretero who was investigating the case and decided to approve a two-year ban.

 The 35-year-old Brazilian tested positive for a metabolite of the banned steroid nandrolone in December 2004 in a random test after a second division match against Pontevedra.

 London: Stringent anti-doping measures launched on Wednesday by the Rugby Football League will set new standards in combating drug cheats, say UK Sport.

 Full, no-notice, out-of-competition testing is central to the measures which will work alongside existing squad training and post-match testing programmes.

 Britain?s Super League players must now provide UK Sport with details of where they will be for at least one hour a day, five days a week.

 ?Having full, no notice, out-of-competition testing is essential in any successful anti-doping programme,? head of the National Anti-Doping Programme at UK Sport Andy van Neutegem said.

 London: Former winners Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley will represent Ireland at the WGC-World Cup in Portugal in November, the European Tour said on Wednesday.

 World No. 13 Harrington selected 29th-ranked McGinley to partner him at Victoria Clube de Golfe in Vilamoura from November 17 to 20 when they will attempt to repeat their 1997 victory at Kiawah Island, South Carolina.

 Last year, the Irish duo finished third behind champions England and hosts Spain when the World Golf Championships team competition was held in Seville.

 Other team line-ups confirmed on Wednesday included Spain (Sergio Garcia and Miguel Angel Jimenez), South Africa (Trevor Immelman and Tim Clark), France (Thomas Levet and Raphael Jacquelin) and Sweden (Henrik Stenson and Niclas Fasth).

 London: Brazilian Antonio Pizzonia will drive for Williams in the last two races of the season in Japan and China next month, the Formula One team said on Wednesday.

 The 25-year-old has stood in for German Nick Heidfeld in the last three races, finishing seventh at Monza before crashing in Belgium and in Brazil last weekend.

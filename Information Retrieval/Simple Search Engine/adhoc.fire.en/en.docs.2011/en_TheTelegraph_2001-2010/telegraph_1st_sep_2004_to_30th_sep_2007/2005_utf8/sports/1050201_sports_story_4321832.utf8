 Murali to have 2nd shoulder surgery

Colombo: Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan faces up to 10 weeks on the sidelines after his surgeon recommended an immediate second surgery on his shoulder injury to avoid long-term tendon damage. 

Muralidharan visited Melbourne-based surgeon Dr David Young straight after playing the three-match tsunami fund-raising series in New Zealand during which he complained of severe pain on his bowling shoulder. 

When the shoulder, which was operated on last August to drain a painful cyst, was scanned, Young identified a torn muscle tendon that needed to be operated on swiftly to prevent a longer lay-off from the game. 

?Murali has a torn tendon in his shoulder and he will be having surgery in the next 24-48 hours in Melbourne,? said Kushil Gunasekera, Muralidharan?s manager, on Monday. 

Muralidharan, who missed several tours in 2004 because of shoulder problems, has been told he will be out of action for another eight to 10 weeks. That means he is doubtful for the rescheduled tour of New Zealand in April. 

The 32-year-old spinner will hope to be fit enough by mid-April to start his third season of County cricket in England with Lancashire.

London: England put the finishing touches to Bangladeshs Lords misery as they captured their last five wickets to seal an innings-and-261-run walkover on the third morning of the first Test on Saturday. 

Bangladesh, outclassed throughout and who had conceded a 420-run first-innings deficit after being steamrollered for 108 on the opening day, resumed on 90 for five, clinging to the hope of putting on some sort of show. 

Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison, however, shared three wickets in the first nine balls to put an end to that day dream. England wrapped up the innings for 159, half an hour before lunch. 

Simon Jones took three for 29 and Andrew Flintoff three for 44. 

Before the game I mentioned the word banana skin but apart from the first 10 overs of the match, I thought we were excellent, home captain Michael Vaughan said. 

We were ruthless in the field and very dominant with the bat. The important thing is to repeat it in the second Test. We can only play whoever is in front of us. 

Englands win ? the 10th biggest innings victory in Test history ? was their 13th in 17 Tests, set against one defeat. For Bangladesh, playing at Lords for the first time, it was their 32nd defeat in 37 starts. 

Spinner Gareth Batty, though, brought in for the injured Ashley Giles, did not bowl a single ball or get a bat.

Brimming with breath-taking, chance-taking football, this extraordinary game was Arsenals biggest victory under Arsene Wenger, a reminder of the enduring class in the deposed champions ranks, and a warning to Manchester United that they can expect the most testing of afternoons in the FA Cup final. 

Goals from Robert Pires twice, Robin van Persie, Patrick Vieira, Edu, the outstanding Dennis Bergkamp and Mathieu Flamini brought rich and deserved reward for such a joyous commitment to attack. 

Thierry Henry also returned from injury, adding even more pace and attacking variety, and showing no ill-effects from his recent groin problem. 

Time after time, relentless waves unleashed by Bergkamps clever feet rolled through Everton, bringing superb goals for Van Persie, Pires and Vieira before half-time. 

Everton fans were in good-natured mood, delighted to have qualified for the Champions League, although this chastening experience will simply have reminded David Moyes over-achieving side the depth of danger awaiting them in Europes elite competition. 

And Arsenal never impose their undoubted talent on Continental sides with the style they so often do in the Premiership, partly because Bergkamps fear of flying precludes him from most European away ties. 

Here, on the green grass of his Highbury home, Bergkamp was at the heart of all that was good about Arsenals fluent football. 

Until Henrys arrival at the break, Wenger had partnered Bergkamp with Van Persie, going double Dutch. Similar types of support strikers, the pair dovetailed impressively. Within minutes, Bergkamp was taking a pass from the lively Jose Antonio Reyes and teasing the ball between Joseph Yobo and David Weir. The ball was perfectly weighted for Van Persie who guided it first time left-footed past Richard Wright. 

Arsenal were in party mood, accepting that their title has deservedly gone to Chelsea but thrilling to the knowledge that they are hurtling towards an FA Cup final with Manchester United bristling with good form. 

Bergkamp, inevitably, was involved in Arsenals second, sending Reyes speeding behind Tony Hibbert, Evertons usually capable right-back who was outclassed and bypassed here. 

Reyes drove the ball across, Pires drew a fine save from Wright and then met the rebounding ball with a looping header that cleared the Everton keeper and dropped in. 

Missing the menacing dimension from midfield of the injured Tim Cahill, Everton still had their first-half moments, Jens Lehmann saving well from Mikel Arteta and James Beattie, but otherwise the force was with Arsenal. 

The deposed champions third was little short of sensational. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Edu and freed Van Persie, who immediately ushered Vieira through. Arsenals captain lifted the ball effortlessly over Wright: 3-0. Stunning. 

Game over. But not the scoring. Henry sped into the fray and immediately combined with Bergkamp to release Pires into the box, via a fortunate deflection off Lee Carsley. Pires was presented with a straightforward chance, which he duly tucked away. 

The spree continued in the 69th minute when Henry walked confidently into the box from the right and flicked the ball forward, straight into Carsleys right arm. 

There seemed little the Everton midfielder could do to remove his arm in time. Alan Wiley pointed to the spot, the whole Arsenal team pointed to Edu to take the penalty on his final appearance at Highbury before departing for pastures new in Spain. Wright got a hand to Edus low spot-kick but nothing was going to ruin the Brazilians night. 

Amazingly, Arsenal still had not finished. Bergkamp added a sixth, beating Wright at the second attempt. 

Then Henry raced in from the left, crossed to Reyes at the far-post and the Spaniards cutback was turned in by Flamini.

 Pakistani assurance for Azad

Karachi: The Sindh government on Monday assured the Indian delegation of fool-proof security when the Indian cricket team arrives here next month to play the third and final cricket Test at the National Stadium. 

The five-member delegation, headed by Yashovardhan Azad, called on home secretary Brigadier Ghulam Mohammed Mohtaram in the Sindh secretariat on Monday afternoon during which the visiting team was given an extensive briefing on the security plans for the Indian cricket team during their stay in Karachi. 

The only concern the Indian delegation had was of remote control devices. But we have assured them that we are equipped and capable of countering these situations professionally, said Brigadier Mohtaram. 

The home secretary said the Indian delegation didnt make any special demands, although the cricket team would be staying in Karachi for nearly a week as compared to less than 40 hours when they toured the city last year for a one-dayer. 

We have briefed them on security in hotel, movement to and from stadium and other issues. It was a good session in which we have also informed that there is minimum threat in Karachi in general and to the visiting sports teams in particular, the Brigadier said. 

Azad, after his meeting with the home secretary, told the media that his team was here as part of the normal procedure. (PTI)

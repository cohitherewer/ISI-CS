 Advani makes short work of Wilcock

New Delhi: Former world champion Pankaj Advani made short work of Paul Wilcock of the Isle of Man for yet another win in a junior section league match of the IBSF under-21 and senior snooker championship in Manama, Bahrain. 

Advani romped home with a 64-21, 45-35, 78-1, 76-66 scoreline in his favour in the group UD match, according to information received here on Friday. 

That the Indian took his opponent rather casually was obvious from the fact that he gave Wilcock, who is placed sixth in the group, ample space to score but managed a safe distance for a clean record. 

The tournament is being played in a league-cum-knockout format among the junior (under-21) and senior (over-40) participants. 

Among the seniors, former world billiards champion Geet Sethi defeated Mustafa Ali Atta of Egypt 3-1 in group SB. Sethi scored 65-37, 64-33, 31-61, 55-48. He will take on Mohammed Buainnein of Qatar in the next match.

Calcutta: It was an ironic tale of Tollygunge Agragami proposing and then disposing the verdict of a match, one they would like to forget as soon as possible. 

Against Dempo SC, the current National Football League (NFL) leaders, Biswajit Das? wards played a highly tactical game, outwitting and outmanoeuvring their fancied opponents in almost all departments on Friday. 

They sparkled in gloomy conditions at the Salt Lake Stadium (till floodlights were on). But poor finishing and lack of application from their striking force, in the end, became the bane of their hugely disappointing goalless draw. 

After four rounds, Tollygunge, however, did well to be on five points (including a win in their three-match Goa-leg) while Dempo with 10, would return home still atop the ONGC Cup table. 

?Yes, we were lucky to escape with a draw,? Dempo coach Armando Colaco later admitted. ?We failed to function as a unit. It was a close call,? he told reporters after the match. Das justified the result, insisting that ?one point was my target from this match?, but in retrospect he must be ruing the fact that he failed to take home full points. 

Isiaka Awoyemi (who was later adjudged Man of the Match) and Debkumar Sasmal stood firm in the backline. And last but not the least, sudden rain (following a two-minute stoppage owing to poor visibility) turned the ground all the more difficult for Dempo?s free-flowing play. 

They are the playing the tournament wearing black arm-bands in memory of Cristiano Junior. But Dempo clearly missed the service of a goal-poacher, someone like the late Brazilian. 

Gauranga and Dinesh Swar, on the other hand, ruled the wings with some of their trademark runs. Musah also overlapped, breaking the shackle of a marker?s role. 

Well, full credit to them and their efforts. But it was not just Tollygunge?s day.

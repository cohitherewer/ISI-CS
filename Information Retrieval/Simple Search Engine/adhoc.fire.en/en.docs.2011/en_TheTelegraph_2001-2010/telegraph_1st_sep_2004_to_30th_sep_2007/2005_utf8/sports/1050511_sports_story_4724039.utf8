 Wont underestimate WI: Woolmer

 Woolmer says he has no differences with Shoaib 

Karachi: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said on Tuesday his team was riding high after a successful tour of India but would not take the weakened West Indies lightly when they travel to the Caribbean this week. 

?It would be nice to cap the first year as coach with a win in the Caribbean, but we will not underestimate the West Indies and have to play at our best,? Woolmer said. 

Pakistan fly out on Wednesday to the West Indies, where they play three ODIs and two Tests. 

Woolmer, who played 19 Tests for England and also coached South Africa, said recent good performances in India had boosted his sides confidence. 

?Its not only the confidence of the India tour, but the team on the whole is playing well.? 

Woolmer, who turns 57 on Saturday, admitted his team would miss quicks Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami, who are out with injuries. 

?Of course, the extra pace of Shoaib and Sami would have been handy, but its unfortunate that both are missing through injury and we have to make do with the best available bowlers,? said Woolmer. 

Woolmer denied differences with Shoaib had led to his exclusion. 

?I have no differences with Shoaib,? Woolmer said. ?I have never said anything derogatory against him. What I had said was that he can come back to the team on showing match fitness.? 

Woolmer said he was not bothered by the fact Pakistan failed to win a series in the West Indies on their five previous tours. 

?Every series is a new series. What has happened in the past does not bother me. This team stands a good chance of winning if they play as they did in India,? said Woolmer, who took over as coach in June. 

However, Woolmer disagreed with the assessment that the West Indies are a one-man team, which relies heavily on Brian Lara. 

?Lara is a phenomenon, but others like (Chris) Gayle, (Ramnaresh) Sarwan, (Shivnarine) Chanderpaul and (Wavell) Hinds are also good players, so we would not take them lightly.? 

Pakistan open the tour with a limited overs practice match on Sunday in Antigua before playing the first ODI in St Vincent on May 18. 

The second and third ODIs are scheduled for St Lucia on May 21 and 22 before the Tests in Bridgetown (from May 26) and Kingston (from June 3).

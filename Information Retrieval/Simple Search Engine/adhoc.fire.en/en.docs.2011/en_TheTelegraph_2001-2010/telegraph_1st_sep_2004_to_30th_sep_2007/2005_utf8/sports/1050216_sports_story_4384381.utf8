Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami have put up a creditable performance this season but that was not enough to halt East Bengal?s awesome run in the ninth National Football League for the ONGC Cup. The red-and-gold brigade ? helped largely by Bhaichung Bhutia?s deadly form ? thrashed Tollygunge 5-0 in their eighth match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. East Bengal now have 20 points. 

They led by a Shylo Malsawmtluanga strike till the breather. Climax Lawrence, Chandan Das and Bhaichung (2) made it 5-0. 

East Bengal seemed a mediocre bunch in the first half despite scoring as early as in the 12th minute. Dipankar Roy?s cross from the left was headed home nicely by Malsawmtluanga. 

Tollygunge, after conceding a goal early, tried to push things but their efforts didn?t pay off in the absence of two foreigners ? Suley Musah and Isiaka Awoyemi. Musah?s absence was badly felt as he was the one who lifted the team from difficult situations. 

East Bengal increased the lead in the 53th minute through Lawrence, whose immaculate header was on target following a superb corner by Man-of-the-Match Chandan. This was Lawrence?s fifth goal in the NFL. 

Four minutes later, the defending champions added one more through a planned attack. It was Chandan, whose forward pass was intercepted by Dipankar just outside the box, who again placed it for an advancing Bhaichung. A sheer flash of brilliance from the Indian captain again set the ball for an unmarked Chandan, who pierced the net from hand-shaking distance. 

The East Bengal forwardline never looked satisfied despite the 3-0 lead. The stage was set for Bhaichung to show his prowess. 

His goal in the 64th minute showed why he is considered as the most dangerous of Indian strikers. Bhaichung dodged past Tollygunge defender Deb Kumar Sashmal inside the box and unleashed a right footer which crashed into the roof of the net. 

Bhaichung scored his fifth goal of the meet after latching on to a pass from Chandan. The star striker deceived custodian Sudip Sarkar and placed the ball to the far post. 

Coach Subhas Bhowmick and Bhaichung echoed similar sentiments. ?I?m not bothered with the margin, but happy to have got three points,? said Bhowmick. According to Bhaichung, the team?s win was most important, not his goals. 

Bhaichung would have got his third, had Ernest Jeremiah not wasted sitters in his bid to find his name among the scorers.

 Sachins best is gone

 - Chappell must be given time to settle down, says Kapil 

 Kapil Dev 

Chandigarh: Joining the debate whether Sachin Tendulkar was past his prime, former India captain Kapil Dev on Tuesday said the best days of the batting maestro were behind him. 

His youth is not coming back as he is 32 years old and his best is gone, the former India allrounder told reporters here on the sidelines of a blood donation programme. 

Asked if there was pressure on Tendulkar to perform, Kapil said: there is always pressure on a big player, that is why he is such a big player. I think he should stand up to the occasion and say I will perform. 

To a query whether Tendulkars career had come to a stage where he should call it a day, Kapil said it was for the player to decide. 

He is too great a player. If he is an honest player, which I believe he is, then I think he will take this decision by himself, the Wisden Indian Cricketer of the Century said. 

I wouldnt like somebody pushing him out. Whenever he calls it a day, may be two years or five years from now, he should go with grace and we should love him for that. 

Kapil declined to comment on the batting form of Sourav Ganguly, saying it was the lookout of the national selectors and the coach. 

They should do things keeping the interest of the country in mind, Kapil said, evading a direct reply to whether Sourav should continue to lead Team India or not. 

Kapil said the new coach Greg Chappell must be given time to settle down. 

Now that he (Chappell) has been selected it would only be fair to give him some time to settle. Give him three months and may be then we can say, but at the moment he should be given support. 

Asked if the Indian team should have a regular bowling coach, Kapil, who had 434 Test wickets to his credit, said, if the country gets benefitted out of anything, it must be done. He, however, did not state his preference in this regard and maintained that the BCCI must know if there was a requirement for this or not. 

On the injury concerns of several fast bowlers, Kapil, who enjoyed a long and injury-free career as a medium pacer, said: If they discuss it with me, may be I can help. 

A cricketer should know his body and work accordingly. If I say what suits me should be applied on him as well, it wont be a correct thing to say. There are always different requirements for every player and they should work accordingly, he said. 

Kapil did not agree that the current lot of fast bowlers in the Indian team was playing lot of cricket. I dont think they are overplaying. It is a profession they have willingly taken up, remarked the legend. 

According to him, if at any stage a pacer feels that he is tired, he should say it clearly. 

Commenting on world champion Australias performance in England, Kapil said he was surprised to see them losing to Bangladesh in a NatWest Series one-day International. 

They have been dominating the scene for the past 10-12 years. I think they are still a very good team, though their loss to Bangladesh was amazing.

Durban: Zimbabwe fell to a 131-run defeat after limping to 198 for seven against South Africa in the second of three one-day Internationals today. 

South Africa lead the series 2-0. 

Set an unlikely target of 330 for victory in 50 overs after South Africa reached 329 for six, Zimbabwe?s young batsmen played carefully for the most part. 

There were good efforts in the Zimbabwe innings ? opener Barney Rogers hit an aggressive 47 before holding out to Nicky Boje off the bowling of Albie Morkel and Sean Williams hit 33 in 43 balls towards the end of the match. 

Morkel was the best of South Africa?s bowlers, taking two for 27 off seven overs, and Adam Bacher took two for 36 in 10 with his wobbly little seamers. 

Earlier, Graeme Smith?s 117 sparked a south African run spree. 

It was the South African captain?s highest ODI score, but it seemed a timid affair after some of the big hitting it inspired at the Kingsmead Stadium. 

Put in to bat , Smith found a good partner in Herschelle Gibbs, and his former fellow opener smashed 75 off 73 balls in a record fourth-wicket partnership against Zimbabwe of 134 runs. 

Gibbs? departure brought Ashwell Prince to the wicket, and he scurried to 30 off 32 balls as Smith moved to his final total off 129 balls with five fours and four sixes, his third century in one-day Internationals. 

Then the agony really started for Zimbabwe as Justin Kemp bludgeoned his way to a half-century off just 19 balls, finishing on 53 off 21, with two fours and five sixes as South Africa reached the highest total ever scored at Kingsmead. 

In the face of such hitting, none of the visiting bowlers looked particularly good.

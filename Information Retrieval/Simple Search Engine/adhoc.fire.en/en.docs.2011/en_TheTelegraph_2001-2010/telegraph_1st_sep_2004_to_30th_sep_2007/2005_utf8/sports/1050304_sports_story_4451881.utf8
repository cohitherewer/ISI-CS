 Anand, Adams share point

Linares: Viswanathan Anand could do little against the solid play of Briton Michael Adams and settled for a draw (as reported in Thursday?s Late City edition) in the seventh round of the 22nd Linares Super Grandmasters tournament here on Wednesday. 

Garri Kasparov, the world?s top-rated player, maintained his slender half-point lead with an easy draw against Bulgarian Veselin Topalov in his eighth-round game. 

The other game of the day was a quick draw as well ? lasting just 13 moves ? between Francisco Pons Vallejo of Spain and Hungarian Peter Leko. 

Kasparov, with four points from six games, is top of the table at the halfway stage in this Euro 2,97,000 prize-money tournament being played on a double round-robin basis. 

Both Anand and Bulgarian Topalov (3.5) remained within striking distance of the leader. 

With six games left for each participant, Leko and Fide world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov (Uzbekistan) are in the third pack with 3 points each. Adams is not too far behind, on 2.5, while there is little hope left for local star Vallejo (1.5). 

First to sign the peace treaty was Vallejo. Playing in white against Leko, the Spanish drew in just 13 moves leaving little room for his illustrious opponent. 

The next game to end was between Kasparov and Topalov and there was enough indication for the hopefuls here that the No. 1 was content enjoying his leader status. It was a Ruy Lopez wherein the Russian got little playing white and signed peace in just 21 moves. 

Anand?s game against Adams did not demand much from the Indian ace. Playing with black, Anand had to make correct moves only in the middlegame to maintain the balance after Adams decided to play it safe in the Sicilian Nazdorf opening. The game lasted 28 moves.

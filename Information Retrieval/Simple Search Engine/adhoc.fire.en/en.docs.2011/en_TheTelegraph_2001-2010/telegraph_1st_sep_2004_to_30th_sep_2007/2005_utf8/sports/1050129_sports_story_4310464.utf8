The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Serena gaga over Federer

Melbourne: Serena Williams isn?t just a tennis player, she?s also a fan ? especially of top-ranked men?s player Roger Federer. 

So she was watching TV nervously as Federer and Marat Safin fought it out for four hours on Thursday night in a classic match that featured eight match points before the fourth-seeded Russian emerged victorious. 

?I was dying,? Serena said. ?I couldn?t watch at one more point. I turned (the channel) when Federer was down 5-2 in the fifth, and then I turned back, and I was like, ?Oh, I hate to see him lose.? I turned back, and it was 6-6. I?m like, oh, my God. But then I turned again because I couldn?t bear to watch.? 

Serena sounded like a charter member of the Swiss star?s fan club. 

?I think he?s an amazing athlete, just his ability is second to none. I learn so much from his game. He?s just so smooth and so solid, effortless. So I look for a lot of things from him.?

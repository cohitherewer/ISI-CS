The Telegraph - Calcutta

Don?t abandon Sourav

Guest Column

The 2-4 loss in the recent one-day series against 

Pakistan left not only sporting fans but the whole nation devastated. A star-studded 

team launched into orbit, by experts stoking the media, crashed with an almighty 

thud.

In the build-up to the series, the two captains squared 

off on TV in full medieval armour promising a battle royale which in the end proved 

to be a total washout. It was a humiliating loss which sent kept India at No. 

8 in the world rankings. To the prolific number of the causes of defeat endlessly 

debated on television, I would like to add a dimension which in my view has not 

been given much consideration.

The Indian cricketers are by far the highest paid 

in the world. The team consists of established stars who enjoy the luxury of not 

being discarded after even one, two or three poor performances. The second lot 

consists of young but not established promising talent, who are in and out of 

the team in the revolving doors of indecision. Selection, unfortunately, is not 

always influenced by performance but by various other unpalatable considerations.

The prospect of defeat is unnerving even for the stoutest 

of hearts. But add to this the cranked-up expectations of a whole nation while 

chasing a daunting total, the financial consequence of failure, and non-selection 

in future matches. It is more than a crushing burden. It would not be an exaggeration 

to say that their whole life is at stake. One freak bounce or injudicious jab 

at the ball, and the curtain comes down on your career. Youngsters all over the 

world have to learn to stand up to these conditions if they want to make it to 

the top, but in India the pressure is multiplied by the factors mentioned above.

 A couple of good scores will restore Sourav Gangulys 

confidence

The collapse of the middle order was one of the distressing 

features of Indian cricket, till an aggressively bare-torsoed Ganguly twirled 

his shirt on the balcony of Lord?s like a helicopter rotor after a stirring triumph 

when the team successfully chased a mammoth 326! The team went on to win a Test 

in Australia and great things were expected from them.

The fiery confident skipper performed and led by example, 

exuding confidence interpreted by many as arrogance. By contrast, in this series 

Ganguly was an under-performing pale and shaky captain under attack from all quarters. 

His place in the team was vociferously challenged. He shuffled his position in 

the batting order which affected the morale of the team and pumped up the Pakistanis.

A good captain is a rare commodity. Experience is 

very valuable. Even more so is knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the players 

in the team and of other world-class players. In sport, every great player has 

his ups and downs. Ganguly is having a lean spell. A couple of good scores will 

restore his confidence and put him back in the saddle. In my view, he should not 

be abandoned but persevered with not only as a team member but captain as well.

Even though India lost, the Indo-Pak series was one 

of the most significant events in history of Indian sport. It was a milestone 

in Indo-Pak relations. One cricket series has achieved more than 50 years of diplomacy. 

The power of sport is not confined to political mileage. Substantial financial 

gains are also a potent stimulant bringing friendship in its wake.

The series was played in a unique atmosphere of friendliness 

and mutual respect. One cannot recall seeing such an ambience in 50 years of sport. 

Happily, the government and others were quick to realise the potential and seize 

the opportunity. Two political heavyweights, Sheila Dikshit and Arun Jaitley from 

different camps, put their shoulders to the wheel and made what seemed impossible 

happen by getting the Kotla ready in time.

The ugly side of the series was the infighting shown 

on TV channels of meetings of the Delhi District and Cricket Association. The 

government must, in all haste, enact laws and enforce a standard constitution 

which makes sports bodies accountable to the nation.

The 16-minute stoppage in the Delhi one-dayer due 

to fans throwing things on the field is also of some concern. Our crowds must 

learn to accept defeat gracefully. This cannot be achieved overnight and will 

take time. The media can play a constructive role along with the sports bodies 

to educate the fans to develop acceptable spectator norms.

Though India were defeated, the series was a resounding 

success and India reaped a rich harvest.

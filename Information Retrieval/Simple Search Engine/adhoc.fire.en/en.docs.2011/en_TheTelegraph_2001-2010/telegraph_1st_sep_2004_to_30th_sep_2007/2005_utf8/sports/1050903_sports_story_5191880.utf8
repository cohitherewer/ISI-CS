Calcutta: Revenge is in the air. 

One is not talking about a handful of die-hard supporters who braved the scorching sun to witness East Bengal practice early on Friday and bayed for Mohun Bagans blood. 

One is also not talking about the supremely gifted I.M. Vijayan, who for a change, looked quite serious while knocking the ball around. 

Rather it is coach Subhas Bhowmick, who, choosing his words carefully in the post-practice press conference, nevertheless admitted to having lost the crown and going into the match without the burden of invincibility. 

Still smarting from the August 18 loss to arch-rivals, the East Bengal coach went out of his way to explain why this should be considered as just another derby. But in between an air of cultivated indifference, tension surfaced when asked whether a loss on Saturday would put him in jeopardy. 

My coaching career doesnt depend on the outcome of tomorrows match, he retorted. 

The coachs aggression, however, was missing during the morning session among his wards, which predictably, lasted a little over 50 minutes and saw a lot of set piece moves being practised. 

Vijayan delighted with his deft touches and Syed Rahim Nabi, target of much spectator interest and sloganeering, seemed determined to make a mark. Admitting that Vijayan would very much be in his scheme of things, the East Bengal coach refused to divulge more. 

He was also guarded in his reaction to the new Maidan sensation, Gley Yao Rodrigue. 

He is a good player, the Togolese, Bhowmick said, adding one has to think about him, but there are 10 others to think about in Bagans ranks as well. 

Having a fit and full squad at his disposal, without any card-related problems, Bhowmick knows Saturday will present the best chance to wrest back his lost crown, and it will also put East Bengal back in title contention to boot. 

And this precisely what Mohun Bagan coach is guarded about. With a comfortable cushion to lay on, Amal Duttas priority is not to lose three points. 

A tall ask, more so because the injured Basudeb Mondal has very little chance of playing. Dutta however, put up a brave front on Friday, Mehrajuddin will start, and I have the ammunition to replace Basu anyway, he said. 

 With a goalmachine called Rodrigue under his belt, who will probably be partnered by Manjeet Singh upfront, Dutta knows East Bengal will have to do the risk-taking, and therein lies his chance. 

Incidentally, the green-and-maroons have been offered an incentive of Rs one lakh by a club official, should they end up on the winning side. 

LIKELY TEAMS 

Mohun Bagan: Subrata Pal; Sanjay Parte, Mehrajuddin Wadao, Eduardo Coelho, Subhashish Roy Chowdhury, Tomba Singh, Mehtab Hussain, Noel Wilson, Dharamjit Singh, Manjeet Singh, Gley Yao Rodrigue. 

East Bengal: Naseem Akhtar; Sasthi Duley, Covan Lawrence, Arun Malhotra, Gurpreet Singh, Debabrata Roy, Dipankar Roy, Bernard Pires, Jatin Bisht/I.M. Vijayan, Alvito DCunha/Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Syed Rahim Nabi.

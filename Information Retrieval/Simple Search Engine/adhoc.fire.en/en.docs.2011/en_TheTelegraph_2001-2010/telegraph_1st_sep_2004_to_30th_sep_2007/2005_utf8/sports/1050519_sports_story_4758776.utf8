 Pakistan fall for 192

Kingstown: Pakistan were bowled out for 192 in the first one-day International against the West Indies at the Arnos Vale ground here on Wednesday. 

The home team, whitewashed 0-5 by South Africa in the one-dayers which finished on Sunday, took the last seven wickets for only 59 runs to give themselves a good chance of maintaining their outstanding record at Arnos Vale. 

West Indies have won 14 of their 15 previous games at the ground, the only defeat coming against Pakistan in 1992-93. 

Pakistans batsmen failed to post one half-century partnership after being asked to bat first. 

All the bowlers stuck to a disciplined line and length, with Chris Gayle (three for 48) the best of the bunch. 

Off-spinner Gayle claimed two important wickets in the 34th over when he removed captain Inzamam-ul Haq and vice captain Younis Khan in the space of three balls. 

Yousuf Youhana was earlier run out for 30 in an unusual manner. 

Youhana dabbed defensively at Gayle and walked out of his crease, only to find wic-ketkeeper Courtney Brow-ne removing the bails in a flash. 

Gayle then bowled Inzamam round his legs for 23 before taking a stunning one-handed return catch to dismiss Younis for nine. 

Pakistan slumped from 133 for three to 153 for six and never recovered. 

Opening batsman Salmat Butt top-scored with 43, sharing the best partnership of the innings (42) for the third wicket with Youhana.

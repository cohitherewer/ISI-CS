 Anderson, Collingwood in squad

London: Fast bowler James Anderson and allrounder Paul Collingwood have been drafted into the England squad for the fifth Ashes Test, which starts at The Oval on Thursday. 

Anderson or Collingwood could replace Simon Jones in the final line-up against Australia if the pace bowler does not recover from an ankle injury. 

The 11 players who featured in Englands win in the fourth Test at Trent Bridge, which gave the hosts a 2-1 series lead over the world champions, have all retained their places. 

Uncapped seamer Chris Tremlett was, however, dropped from the squad announced on Sunday. 

We feel that James Andersons inclusion in the squad will give the captain and coach another bowling option in the event of Simon being unfit to play, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman of selectors David Graveney said. 

Simon is continuing to make progress in his recovery from injury and we will give him as much time as he needs in order to prove his fitness. 

He will continue to receive treatment over the next 48 hours and be re-assessed by the medical team at practice on Tuesday. 

THE SQUAD 

Michael Vaughan (captain), Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones, Ashley Giles, Simon Jones, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, James Anderson, Paul Collingwood. 

McGrath fit 

Meanwhile, Australia pace spearhead Glenn McGrath has declared himself fit and ready to play at The Oval. 

Ankle and elbow injuries ruled the 35-year-old out of the second and fourth Tests but McGrath insists he will be ready to help Australia try and claim victory next week and retain the Ashes. 

He told a newspaper on Sunday: Its back to business as usual for the fifth Test. Ive made a full recovery and will definitely play at The Oval. 

It has been so frustrating sitting out two of the first four Tests, but now I can get at the England batsmen in the decider.

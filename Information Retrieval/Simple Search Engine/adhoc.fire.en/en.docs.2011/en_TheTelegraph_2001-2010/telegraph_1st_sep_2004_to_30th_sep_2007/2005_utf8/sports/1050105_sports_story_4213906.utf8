 ?Queen? fancied to win in Mysore 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Victory Queen, hailing from Amit Caddy?s yard, is fancied to lift the 1,200m Victory Zone Cup here on Wednesday.

 Last time out in a close contest over 1,400m, the five-year-old mare had gone down by a ?nose? to Super Chieftan. Working extremely well and also maintaining her forward form, the Young Senor-Rose Amour daughter may make amends for the failure in the hands of a 2-1/2 kg allowance apprentice V. Jagadeesh.

Calcutta: East Bengal are on the rampage, but coach Subhash Bhowmick, before their crucial tie vs Mahindra United Friday, appeared in no mood to take anything for granted. 

As the players stepped out for practice early on Thursday, Bhowmick ? from pulling up the Earnest Jeremiahs for not maintaining the ?dress code? to making the boys function like a well-oiled machine ? seemed like a man on a mission. 

And why wouldn?t he? Having collected 20 points from eight matches, East Bengal are the team to beat. Yet the coach seemed cautious as ever. ?With the best reserve bench in the league, Mahindra United are the aspiring champions. They are a very good team,? asserted Bhowmick. 

Not wanting to take any chances, the East Bengal coach ruled out Shylo Malsawmtluanga (muscle spasm) for Friday?s match, but said Jeremiah (with a not-too serious ankle injury) is available. Alvito D?Cunha too is completely fit, he said. Bhowmick however, said a marker?s role is set for Madhab Das. ?Madhab, if required, will play as a marker,? Bhowmick said, adding, ?I?ll have to use Debjit (Ghosh), who can co-ordinate well with him.? 

Coming after a 5-0 trouncing of Tollygunge Agragami, the East Bengal coach sought to play down the pressure factor, saying, ?The supporters must understand that it isn?t possible for any team in the world to keep playing consistently well. After all, the teams have just a minor difference between them.? 

Talk about being cautious and you have another in Syed Nayeemuddin, coach of the Mumbai outfit. ?I can?t talk much,? he said, adding, ?This match is pretty crucial for us.? 

Despite a well-balanced team, Mahindra United have often failed to gel. A 1-1 draw vs Tollygunge Agragami at home has put pressure on Nayeemuddin?s boys. However, the coach is in no mood to accept that. ?We will be going out in a positive frame of mind. We have done well against Mohun Bagan, hope we do that against East Bengal as well,? the Dronacharya maintained. 

Mahindra United are currently fourth on 12 points, but have played a game less. 

Meanwhile, in the absence of Mike Okoro, the club has roped in another Brazilian, Marcos. His international transfer certificate has arrived but he will not be available for Friday?s match, the coach said.

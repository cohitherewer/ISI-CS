 ?Tough to choose between Harsh and Prakash?

 Paes feels his lay-off will not affect 

 performance

New Delhi: Indian Davis Cup captain Leander Paes on Saturday said the two-month layoff from injury would not hamper his performance and he looked to ?pace himself? against China in the Asia Oceania zone group 1 first round tie to be held here from March 4 to 6. 

Paes, who played his first match this week since injuring his ankle in a Sydney event prior to the Australian Open, said he felt a bit rusty but was confident he would get back into the groove fast. 

?I was a bit rusty. But tennis is not going to take long. I just need to pace myself into the tie,? said Paes who lost in the first round doubles of the Dubai Open. 

Paes had his first hit on grass courts in months with Vishal Uppal and Vivek Shokeen at the NSCI courts here Saturday morning. ?I had a good session. I am playing after a long time on grass but surely it does not take a long time to get back on grass,? he added. 

The Indian captain said selection of second singles player would be a tough job given the good form of Harsh Mankad, who won the satellite circuit in Britain this week. 

?Harsh is the player in form and Prakash (Amritraj) is a good serve and volley player. So it (selection) will be a difficult job for me.? 

Meanwhile, the Chinese team will arrive here on Sunday, an AITA release said. (Pti)

 Jenson Button handed deadline

 - Bar driver given a week to make up mind on Williams move

KEVIN GARSIDE in HOCKENHEIM 

Jenson Button has been given a week to declare his hand. The 25-year-old Briton holds the key to a driver merry-go-round that could mean as many as five drivers change teams next year, including his BAR colleague, Anthony Davidson. 

Buttons employers at BAR are desperate to keep him but have no contractual claim. That privilege passed to Williams when it became clear that Button could not reach the number of points needed to activate a clause in his contract that would keep him at BAR in 2006. 

Button was keen to return to Williams a year ago and would have done so were it not for the intervention of the Contracts Recognition Board, which ruled he must stay at BAR. 

The subsequent acquisition of half the team by Japanese engine manufacturer Honda, which rates Button highly, has been used as a lever by BAR to persuade him to pursue his world championship ambitions with them. 

Williams appear equally determined to exercise their contractual claim and partner Button with Mark Webber. 

To keep him, BAR need Button to make his preference known, so negotiations with Williams or alternative drivers can begin. 

BAR team principal Nick Fry said: Jenson knows he can end his career with this team but the decision is his and we need him to make it quickly for everybodys sake. 

None more than Davidson, who will slot into Buttons seat should he leave. 

Whichever way Button decides to jump, a new face appears likely at BAR in 2006, with Rubens Barrichello strongly favoured to replace Takuma Sato. 

Though Barrichello has a year to run on his contract with Ferrari, his departure would allow fellow-Brazilian Felipe Massa to make the switch from Sauber. 

Massas departure would in turn create a coveted seat at the new BMW team, which Davidson would be well placed to take should Button remain at BAR. 

Meanwhile, team principals attached to manufacturer-led teams will meet to finalise plans for the future of the sport. 

It is understood some of the proposals made by F1s governing body, the FIA, have been assimilated into their plans, making a political settlement likely between the factions vying for power. 

The FIA world motor sport council ratified the decision of the FIA senate to cancel the guilty verdicts imposed on the teams for their roles in the Indianapolis tyre affair. 

With the FIA and the manufacture-led teams in a conciliatory mood, the peace pipe could soon be passed around, ending a feud that threatened to tear the sport apart. 

We are a business. There are a lot of people 

working in this industry. It is important we get it right. Everybody wants a better 

Formula One, Flavio Briatore, Renault team principal, said.

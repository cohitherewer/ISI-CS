The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Objections galore before big fight 

 - BCCI observer having a tough time 

New Delhi: With the BCCI AGM set to be held in Calcutta on November 29 and 30, former Chief Election Commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy, the observer appointed by Supreme Court to oversee the elections, is having a tough time with objections pouring in from both the Sharad Pawar and Jagmohan Dalmiya camps. 

Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA), belonging to the Pawar camp, has questioned the election process itself, while a few other units have stressed that only a voter should be allowed inside the meeting hall once the elections are announced. A decision on the objections raised by the units will be decided on November 23 at a meeting here between the observer and the units representatives, BCCI sources said. 

The following are the objections raised before the observer: 

According to some units, a candidate should be a voter and only a voter should be allowed inside the meeting hall once the elections are announced. This issue may put spokes in the wheels of convention of the BCCI, as this will mean that Prof Ratnakar Shetty of Mumbai and Gautam Das Gupta of Calcutta will have to be voters to contest the elections, affecting the presence of both Pawar and Dalmya when the elections are held. If this proposal is agreed to by the observer, it will also affect Rajiv Shukla and Jyoti Bajpai from seeking re-election to the posts of vice-president and treasurer, respectively. 

The VCA, in a letter to Krishnamurthy, has asked him as to how the nominations could be filed by candidates on the same day when the units have been asked to submit their voters names by November 27. The letter has said that if a voter, who proposes or seconds a nomination, was disqualified, the candidate should also stand invalidated. The VCA has suggested that nominations be asked only after the voters list was made public. 

Objections have been also raised over Bihars membership and the issue of Jharkhand. Last September, Jharkhand was extended the affiliation in a special general body in place of Bihar, since Jamshedpur was the official address of the Bihar unit. (PTI)

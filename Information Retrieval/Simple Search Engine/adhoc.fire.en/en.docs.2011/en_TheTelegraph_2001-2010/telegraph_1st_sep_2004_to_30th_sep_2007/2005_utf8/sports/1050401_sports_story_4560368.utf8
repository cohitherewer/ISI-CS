The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sukhwinder Singh back as India coach

A STAFF REPORTER

Sukhwinder will take charge from June

Calcutta: Sukhwinder Singh will be back as India?s football coach. According to All India Football Federation president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Singh will take charge of the squad for Doha Asian Games from June. 

Stephen Constantine?s term ends in June. ?His contract will not be renewed,? Das Munshi reiterated. 

The AIFF president, however, did not rule out the possibility of a foreign coach, saying he could look after the senior and other age-group sides. 

It may be recalled that only three players above 23 years are allowed in the squad for Asian Games. 

The AIFF will hold an exhibition match at the Salt Lake Stadium on June 4 to contribute to the FIFA/AFC tsunami fund ? titled Football for Hope ? for construction of a training centre at Lapaty village of Car Nicobar. 

I.M. Vijayan XI and Bhaichung Bhutia XI will battle it out and a move is afoot to have few former international stars ? Bebeto, Lothar Matthaeus and Marco van Basten are among others being thought of ? as guest players on either side. 

Das Munshi informed that the Nehru Cup will be held in December and the AIFF has signed a MoU with Kerala Football Association for staging the event. 

He informed that the AIFF will be forced to stage professional league from 2006, following pressure from AFC. The National League format will also undergo a change from next year.

 Serena fails to meet her destiny

 Liz Clarke at Wimbledon

Since she arrived in England last week, two-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams had been operating on the conviction that her will to win was strong enough to overpower the combined talent, skills, hard work and desire of whatever opponent she faced. 

And through her first two matches Serena was vindicated, pulling out victories ? albeit sloppy ones ? that propelled her one step closer to a much-anticipated fourth-round meeting with elder sister Venus and to a womens final that she repeatedly referred to as her destiny. 

Serenas fanciful theory slammed headlong into reality Saturday in the unlikely form of 30-year-old Jill Craybas, the worlds 85th-ranked player, who sent her packing from the tournament she once ruled, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). It was the fourth-ranked Serenas earliest Wimbledon defeat since her debut in 1998. 

Though the loss reduced her to tears and caused her to interrupt her post-match interview several times to dab her eyes, Serena ? who refused to use her injured left ankle as an excuse ? needed only to look in a mirror to find the cause. 

Craybas surely did her part in notching the biggest victory of her career, landing 66 per cent of her first serves, handling the pace of Serenas vaunted groundstrokes and, most importantly, keeping her composure as Serena ratcheted up her power, as well as her grunts and glares, in a vain attempt to force a third set. 

But in the end, Serenas role in the outcome was larger than that of Craybas. Im just used to wining these kind of matches, Serena said afterward. Its just hard when you go out there and you cant make a shot, and youve been making them for years. Its like ? its a battle. 

Part of the reason for Serenas ineffectiveness is that female tennis pros are more fit and strong than even five years ago, working harder in the gym and investing more power in their games. The other part is that Serena hasnt kept up. 

Faced with the most embarrassing loss of her career, she uttered the critical words on Saturday that suggest she may be ready to set her acting bug aside and rededicate herself to the sport that made her famous. I definitely think its important for me to practice harder than Ive been practising, Serena said. 

If the outcome was a wake-up call to Serena, it was the sweetest possible reward for Craybas. 

While Saturdays victory was absolutely fantastic, Craybas said, it meant even more because of the work she and her coach had devoted these last months to the mental aspect of her game. 

The two previous meetings when I played (Serena), I dont think I believed that I could actually win the match ? no matter how well I was playing, she said. When she walked on court on Saturday, Craybas felt she was Serenas equal.

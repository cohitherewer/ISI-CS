 ?Warne pondering comeback?Shane Warne

Melbourne: Australia skipper Ricky Ponting and vice-captain Adam Gilchrist believe Shane Warne could break his retirement from one-day Internationals in time to play in the 2007 World Cup. 

?If I was a betting man, would I think he has any chance for the World Cup? It would probably be a toss of the coin thing at the moment,? Ponting told a news conference at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday. 

?Shane would love to play in the World Cup. (But) Shane?s always got it in the back of his mind about what sort of effect playing one-day cricket could have on his Test career.? 

Ponting, speaking on the eve of Friday?s triangular limited-overs series opener against West Indies in Melbourne, said Australia wanted to promote younger spinners into their one-day team, like 23-year-old Nathan Hauritz, who has 27 caps, and 21-year-old Victoria captain Cameron White. 

?If those guys don?t come along as we would like, I think Shane would consider it (a comeback) more,? Ponting said. 

?It?s extremely tempting for him. After Monday night?s game, he loved being back out there again and playing one-day cricket. 

?I know he is thinking about it.? 

Gilchrist said: ?I?m sure it?s a definite option and Warney is to-ing and fro-ing in his mind. 

?I?m certain Warney is still good enough to be very, very successful in one-day cricket.? 

The 35-year-old Warne took two for 27 for the ICC XI against Asia XI in Monday?s charity game in Melbourne for victims of the south Asian tsunami disaster. 

Warne, Test cricket?s leading wicket-taker with 566 victims, told reporters he enjoyed the charity match but would remain retired from one-day Internationals to give his body a break and avoid the constant travelling. 

However, the leg-spinner added: ?Who knows down the track? You never know.? 

Warne said in January 2003 he would retire from one-day Internationals following the World Cup, but after travelling to South Africa for the tournament later in the year it was announced that he had tested positive for a banned diuretic. 

The Australian was suspended for 12 months, missed his country?s successful World Cup defence and returned to Test cricket in March 2004, taking 26 wickets in three Tests in Sri Lanka. 

Warne is the eighth leading wicket-taker in one-day Internationals with 293 victims in 194 matches. 

He was one of six Australians named in a World XI squad earlier this week for three one-day games in New Zealand on January 22, 24 and 26 in aid of tsunami victims.

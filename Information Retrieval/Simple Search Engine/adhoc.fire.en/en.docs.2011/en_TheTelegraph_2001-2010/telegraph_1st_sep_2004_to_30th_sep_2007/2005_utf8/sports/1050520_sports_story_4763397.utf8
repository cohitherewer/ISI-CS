 Narain finishes 21st at practice

Monaco: Narain Karthikeyan struggled on the challenging street circuit of Monaco Grand Prix to finish 21st in both the practice sessions on Thursday in which McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya and Renault driver Fernando Alonso dominated, respectively. 

Karthikeyan, Indias rookie F1 driver, clocked 1 hour and 21:879 minutes while his Jordan teammate Tiago Monteiro of Portugal was one place ahead at 1:20.284 in the second session of the day. 

The 28-year-old Karthikeyan, who was 1.22.521 in the first practice session, completing 32 laps between the two sessions ahead of the sixth GP marking the beginning of the European Tour. 

On this 15-bends Monaco track drivers are always in alert with over 2000 gear changes on their plate for the Grand Prix, Karthikeyan said. 

On the 3.340 kilometres long circuit, where we will race Sunday for 78 laps, there are several key factor to success in first line the reliability of the machines, the engines and the tires even if unlike other tracks, the speeds are relatively low, he said. 

Finally, the driver needs to behave with precision and perfection because the run-off areas are very limited. 

Karthikeyan said he experienced a small incident in the morning session when the suspension of his car collapsed. 

The Jordan Grand Prix team used the first part of the afternoon session to fix it successfully and I was able to complete twelve laps in the afternoon session with a time of 1.21.879. Learning is hard and challenging in Monaco! 

Meanwhile, Toyotas Ralf Schumacher was ordered to add half-a-second penalty to his Sundays aggregate qualifying time after he was found to have used in free practice a left front tyre that had not been officially allocated to him. Supplier Michelin blamed human error. 

Bernie offered job 

Bernie Ecclestone is, meanwhile, considering quitting as Formula Ones commercial supremo for a new job with the sports governing body, FIA president Max Mosley said Thursday. 

Mosley saw every possibility of the 74-year-old Briton accepting an offer that would involve him steering the sport from the other side of the fence. 

It would be a very major step for him but I think, yes, he might do it, said Mosley.

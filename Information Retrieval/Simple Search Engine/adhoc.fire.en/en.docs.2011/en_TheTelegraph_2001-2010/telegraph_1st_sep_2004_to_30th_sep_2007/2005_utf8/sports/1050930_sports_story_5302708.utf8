 Pollock banking on English ploy

 - Super Series

 - World XI gear up for the Australian challenge 

Melbourne: The World XI will tap into Englands successful Ashes strategies when they take on Australia in three one-day Internationals here next week, captain Shaun Pollock said Thursday. 

England upset the odds when their well-executed tactics unhinged the fancied Aussies to regain the Ashes in an unforgettable series earlier this month in England. 

Weve got Tim Boon from England, whos the analyst for them, whos bringing over some of the footage, some of the ideas that they used against Australia, Pollock told a press conference here. The guys should be pretty well prepared. 

The South African allrounder said the presence of match-winning English allrounder Andrew Flintoff and batting sensation Kevin Pietersen would bolster the World XIs chances against Ricky Pontings team. 

Pollock said the pairs form, confidence and tactical insights would be useful for the all-star world team. Hopefully, that rubs off onto the other guys, he said. 

Pollock said the international combination needed to apply the same sort of pressure on Australia as England had, but noted there were some important differences. 

This is in a different country, different conditions, and being at home Im sure theyll (Australia) be a lot more comfortable, he said. 

Pollock said the biggest challenge would be gelling as a team before the opening match at Docklands Stadium, but said given the individual experience it should not be a problem. The ODIs will be played on October 5, 7 and 9, while a six-day Test match starts on October 14.

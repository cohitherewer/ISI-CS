The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I will prove critics wrong, says Sunita

 Sunita hopes to recapture form in 2-3 months 

Patiala: Two-and-a-half years ago she was caught and tried, before being finally cleared of charges of using performance-enhancing drugs. 

Sunita Rani has not forgotten those testing times when she fought back from near-total mental breakdown. The girl from Punjab now wants to put all the suffering, after a positive dope test during the Busan Asian Games, behind her. 

Everyone said I was on dope and thats how I won. So now I will win again and show them, Sunita said. 

Refusing to recall the dark days immediately after 1500m gold and 5000m bronze wins in Busan, Sunita said: What has happened has happened, lets look at the future. It happened a long time ago and Im tired of answering questions on that topic. 

Sunita recorded an easy win in the 10,000m race in the second national Circuit meet on Saturday. 

In her first race in almost eight months, the 1500m national record-holder was just trying to test herself and in the process nearly broke the national record. I went for the record but the heat made it tough. The 10,000 is not my event, I ran it just to test my fitness and stamina. 

Her target this year is to do well in the Asian Track and Field meet in September. Sunita is hopeful of recapturing her peak form with a few more months of training. In two to three months, I will be back to my 2002 form, she said. (PTI)

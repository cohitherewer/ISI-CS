St Andrews: Tiger Woods lived up to his billing as red-hot favourite for the 134th British Open by moving two strokes clear midway through Thursdays first round. 

The world No. 1, bidding for a 10th career major, reeled off seven birdies in nine holes before completing a six-under-par 66 on an overcast and breezy morning at St Andrews. 

Three-time winner Jack Nicklaus, making his final appearance at the Old Course at the age of 65, produced a few moments of magic on his way to a battling 75. 

Americans Nicklaus and Woods joined the other players in pausing during their rounds for two minutes silence in memory of the victims of last weeks London bombings. 

A run of four consecutive birdies from the par-four ninth put Woods three ahead at seven under but he lost ground with bogeys at 13 and 16, on both occasions ending up in pot bunkers. 

He signed off in style, though, chipping to six feet for a birdie at the last and his best start at an Open since he fired a 65 at Royal Birkdale in 1998. 

I feel like Im playing really well, the US Masters champion told a news conference. My last three events Ive performed well and Im just trying to build on that. 

Even though I had it going and was seven under through 12 holes, finishing at six (under) is a great start to the tournament, added the 29-year-old, who won the 2000 Open at the Old Course by eight shots. 

I made some putts today and that never hurts. I am very happy. 

Twice US Open champion Retief Goosen, British Ryder Cup player Luke Donald, Spains Jose Maria Olazabal, American Scott Verplank and Australias Peter Lonard were among a group of seven tied for second after carding 68s. 

Frenchman Thomas Levet, who lost out in a four-way playoff for the 2002 title at Muirfield where Ernie Els triumphed, was a further shot back with US Open champion Michael Campbell. 

Best of the late starters was Britains Steve Webster, who eagled the fifth and ninth and joined Woods on six under at one stage. 

Among the other late starters, Els, world No. 2 Vijai Singh and last years Masters champion Phil Mickelson were locked at one under ? after 10, six and eight holes, respectively. 

Woods parred the first three holes before rolling in a 20-footer at the par-four fourth and reaching the green in two at the par-five fifth to get to two under. 

Although he was bunkered off the tee at the seventh, he splashed out to five feet for birdie No. 3. 

He then holed an eight-footer at the ninth to reach the turn in four-under 32. 

At the par-four 10th, he struck his approach to eight feet and calmly sank the putt. 

A curling 15-footer followed for birdie at the par-three 11th before Woods stretched his lead to three with an eight-foot birdie putt on 12. 

Nicklaus, who made his debut at Royal Troon in 1962, sparked warm applause from a huge gallery when he pitched to eight feet at the opening hole to set up his first birdie. 

Although the Golden Bear stumbled at two of the next three holes, he recovered at the par-four seventh where he manufactured a deft bump-and-run from behind a greenside bunker that ended up just five feet from the cup for birdie No. 2. 

Nicklaus, whose last two British Open victories in 1970 and 1978 came at St Andrews, bogeyed 11, 12 and 13 to lose ground before being cheered all the way down the last to complete his round.
